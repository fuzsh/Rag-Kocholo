        "text": "The best player on the best team.\n\nIt's a fairly simple formula most years for picking California's Player of the Year. One problem for the 2022-23 season is that the best team, CIF Open Division champion Harvard-Westlake, had such beautifully balanced and talented team.\n\nOn any given night, the Wolverines could be led in scoring by four or five different players, as told by Wolverines' coach David Rebibo immediately after his team's 76-65 state-title win over St. Joseph-Santa Maria at Golden 1 Center.\n\n\"I'm so incredible proud of this group,\" he said. \"We showed character all year. We're selfless. We had a different leading scorer the majority of the nights. Great group. Great chemistry.\"\n\nBut we picked the one who seemed to stir that chemistry during every key moment of the banner, near-perfect 32-2 season: Trent Perry is SBLive's 2022-23 California boys basketball Player of the Year.\n\nPerry headlines a 50-player All-State team below that also feature POYs in each section, for each grade and adds 6-player teams for each year.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 junior guard, voted Most Valuable Player of the vaunted Mission League, averaged 16 points, seven rebounds and six assists a game.\n\nThose aren't earth-bending numbers, but on this team, they were considerable.\n\nIn the state-title game, the long and slender do-everything Perry recorded an Open title-game record 10 assists to go with 16 points and eight rebounds.\n\nHe orchestrated a balanced, versatile squad that finished No.6 nationally. He made big shots and big plays all season, including scoring a game-high 25 in the Southern California Open Division final, a stunning 80-61 win at defending state champion and then No. 1 ranked Corona Centennial.\n\nThat night, he outdueled Jared McCain, the Los Angeles Times’ Player of the Year and a McDonald’s All-American, who scored 21 points.\n\nPerry also edged McCain, Los Angeles Daily News Player of the Year Caleb Foster, of state champion Notre Dame (Sherman Oaks), high-scoring Dougherty Valley guard Ryan Beasley, and St. Joseph super sophomore Tounde Yessoufou, for the Golden’s State’s top basketball prize.\n\nIt was a close call. But that, of course, where Perry seemed to shine brightest. At the end of quarters, halves and games. In the tightest of contests and circumstances, the constant state in Southern California basketball.\n\nConsidering Perry played with All-State performers Brady Dunlap, Jacob Huggins and sophomore Nikolas Khamenia, it would be easy for Perry to get lost.\n\nEspecially wearing the number “0.”\n\nBut it seemed he always delivered either with a big shot — from all three levels — rebound or pass. He also deflected numerous passes with a long reach and a quick first step. He’s been described as “crafty,” and “under control,” yet he wore his heart on his sleeve with demonstrative celebrations with teammates during winning time, which was often.\n\nThe team’s only losses were to Liberty of Henderson (Nev) 59-56 on Dec. 30 and 62-55 to St. John Bosco in pool play of the Southern Section’s Open Division playoffs, costing the Wolverines a shot to face Corona Centennial in the finals.\n\nPerry went from having just one college offer before the season to 13 after, including ones from UCLA, USC, Oklahoma, Rice and Minnesota. His big improvement helped the Wolverines to completely turn around a 20-point loss to Centennial in the Southern Section finals of 2022 en route to the state title and No. 1 state ranking.\n\n“He’s just a stud — a great kid, hard-worker, a big-time player who embraced all the moments, the most vital and most mundane,” Rebibo said. “It doesn’t surprise me (he’s picked as the Player of the Year). I’m so proud of him. He’s just grown up and evolved and bought into everything we’ve asked him to do. He’s a special, special player and person.”\n\nAsked for details about Perry’s personality, Rebibo said. “Very smart, very funny and outgoing. He’s always smiling. He’s the guy everyone wants to be around. Again, just a special, special young man.”\n\nHere are the remaining players joining Perry:\n\nThe 2022-23 SBLive All-California boys basketball team is a by-product of endless feedback, numerous evaluations and loads of fact checking.\n\nIt includes three teams of 10, a 20-person honorable mention list, Players of the Year in each section and for each year with an additional five-member teams for each grade.\n\nIt's rather exhaustive and just over a month after the state championships were completed.\n\nWe eyeballed and considered all the experts opinions in each region — see All-Area teams from other media outlets at bottom — contacted coaches, watched NFHS streams and of course used our own eyeballs and judgements to pick the squads.\n\nThey most certainly aren't perfect and we're not perfectly objective. By all means, if obvious omissions or differences of opinions, please let us know at mitch@scorebooklive.com\n\nSBLIVE CALIFORNIA ALL-STATE TEAMS\n\nFirst Team\n\nF Marcus Adams, Narbonne, Sr.\n\nThe 6-8 senior and Kansas signee averaged 29 points, seven rebounds and five assists per game.

The 6-4 combo guard averaged 21 points, 6.8 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. He has another season before playing at Duke.\n\nF Aaron McBride, Corona Centennial, Sr.\n\nBesides pulling off the Play of the Year — a steal and breakaway dunk at the buzzer in a 58-56 Southern Section Open Division title win over St. John Bosco — the 6-7 senior wing and LMU signee averaged 13.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and shot over 60 percent from the field.\n\nG Jared McCain, Corona Centennial, Sr.\n\nThe 6-2 point guard and Duke signee averaged 18 points, seven rebounds and four assists for the three-time defending Southern Section Open champion that finished 30-4 and ranked No. 10 nationally by SBLive.\n\nG Dusty Stromer, Notre Dame-Sherman Oaks, Sr.\n\nThe 6-6 Gonzaga signee averaged 18 points and six rebounds for the state Division I champions.

The stout 6-6 wing had high games of 40 points, 23 rebounds, seven steals and four blocks. Ranked the No. 15 sophomore in the country, Yessoufou has seven college offers including UCLA and Arizona.\n\nSecond Team\n\nF Bryce Bedgood, Valencia, Jr.\n\nThe Los Angeles Daily News’ Defensive Player of the year was pretty good on offense too, averaging 16.2 points to go along with 10.1 rebounds and 2.2 blocks for the state Division 4 championship. The 6-9 standout had 22 points (11 of 14 shooting), 13 rebounds and seven blocks in the state title game.\n\nF Alec Blair, De La Salle, So.\n\nA long, rangy 6-6 wing averaged 16 points, five rebounds and nearly two steals a game for the state’s 20th-ranked team (22-9). Also a national baseball recruit, Blair shot 52 percent from the field and is considered an elite defender.\n\nG: BJ Davis, Modesto Christian, Sr.\n\nThe Sac-Joaquin Section’s Player of the Year averaged 18.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 1.9 steals per game for the Crusaders (27-7), who finished ranked No. 10 in the state. The 6-1 San Diego State-bound standout had 49 points against John Paul II and 38 versus St. Joseph.\n\nF: Mike Davis Jr., San Joaquin Memorial, Sr.\n\nThe 6-7 standout was dominant throughout the season but particularly the postseason, leading the No. 22 Panthers (26-9) to their first state title. Davis had 17 points and 14 rebounds in the state-title win and was the Fresno Bee Player of the Year. He averaged 17 points and 11.5 rebounds per game.\n\nG Keyon Kensie, Taft-Los Angeles, Sr.\n\nVoted the Los Angeles City Most Valuable Player, the 6-7 Kensie averaged 24.1 points and 7.4 rebounds per game, leading the Toreadors to a City Open Division title. He has offers from New Mexico, San Diego and Washington State.\n\nF Elzie Harrington, St. John Bosco, So.\n\nThe Trinity League Player of the Year averaged a team-best 15.3 points per game for the Southern Section Open Division finalists. Bosco ended No. 4 in the final state rankings thanks largely to the development of the 6-5 Harrington.\n\nG Bronny James, Sierra Canyon, Sr.\n\nA first-team talent/performer when healthy, the 6-3 all-around guard averaged 14.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.7 steals per game. The son of LeBron James missed seven games with a knee injury and was a McDonald’s All-American.\n\nF Andrew Meadow, West Ranch, Sr.\n\nThe Foothill League MVP averaged 16.5 points and 8.1 rebound per game for the state’s No. 6 team that finished 29-3.\n\nC Andrew McKeever, Granada, Sr.\n\nThe 7-foot post was absolutely dominating down the stretch, carrying the Matadors to a Northern California Division I title.

He averaged 23 points and 9.1 rebounds per game.\n\nG Jake Hall, Carlsbad, So.\n\nAveraged a staggering 26.4 points per game to go along with 6.8 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.5 steals per game for the 24-7 Lancers. Has scored more than 1,500 points in his career.\n\nG Mercy Miller, Notre Dame, Jr.\n\nLights out shooter and scorer for state D1 champions who averaged 17.1 points per game. The 6-4 standout was also a very aggressive and good rebounder at 8.8 per game.\n\nG Ryder Mjoen, Simi Valley, Jr.\n\nThe Los Angeles Daily News’ Offensive Player of the Year averaged 20.6 points leading his team to a share of the Coast Canyon League title. The 6-2 guard had high games of 41, 35 and 34 points.\n\nF Derek Sangster, Archbishop Mitty, Sr.\n\nThe do-everything 6-7 standout averaged 17.7 points, 8.8 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game and was named the West Catholic Athletic League Player of the Year. He’s headed to Princeton.\n\nG Connor Sevilla, Dougherty Valley, Sr.\n\nOne of the most improved players on the list, his growth as a scorer, defender and ball hawk led the Wildcats to a state No. 11 ranking. The 6-1 guard averaged 21.9 points per game and teammed with Beasley to make one of the state’s top guard tandems.\n\nG Andrej Stojakovic, Jesuit, Sr.\n\nLike James, a first-team talent and McDonald’s All-American but missed 13 games due to an injury. The Stanford-bound 6-6 super shooter averaged 24.1 points and 6.9 rebounds per game.\n\nG Money Williams, Oakland, Sr.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle’s East Bay Player of the Year led the Wildcats — the alma mater of Damian Lillard — to a first state title by averaging 17.4 points, 5.9 rebounds and 1.9 steals per game.\n\n20 very honorable mentions\n\nG Courtney Anderson, Dublin, Sr.\n\nG Alijah Arenas, Chatsworth, Fr.\n\nG Kaiden Bailey, Crean Lutheran, Fr.\n\nG/F Christian Brown, La Costa Canyon, Jr.\n\nG Carson Brown, Tesoro, Sr.\n\nG Ben Eisendrath, Oakwood, Sr.\n\nG/F Isaiah Elohim, Sierra Canyon, Jr.\n\nG Aidan Fowler, JSerra, Jr.\n\nG Eric Freeny, Corona Centennial, Jr.\n\nC Jazz Gardner, West Ranch, Sr.\n\nF Kellen Hampton, Moreau Catholic, So.\n\nF Jacob Huggins, Harvard-Westlake, Sr.\n\nF Joey Kennedy, University-SF, Sr.\n\nF Nikolas Khamenia, Harvard-Westlake, So.\n\nG Nasir Meyer, Agoura, Jr.\n\nG Yaqub Mir, Granite Bay, Sr.\n\nF Sam Norris, Sacred Heart Prep, Sr.\n\nG Lolo Rudolph, St. Augustine, Jr.\n\nF JJ Sanchez, Montgomery-San Diego, So.\n\nG Parker Strauss, Pacific Christian, Sr.\n\nSBLive Section Players of the Year\n\nSan Diego: Dixon\n\nSouthern: Perry\n\nLos Angeles City: Adams\n\nCentral: Yessoufou\n\nSac-Joaquin: B.J.
