The only ones still in Ethiopia, as far as can be determined, are those who had been converted to Christianity and are now seeking to reclaim their ancestral identity. Some three thousand of these people are still in camps in Addis Ababa waiting for favorable decision from Israel. In Israel, the debate about whether to let them come in or not is continuing. Whether the new Labor government headed by Prime Minister Rabin will be favorably disposed remains to be seen.\n\n2.

However, the number of Jews who have migrated to Israel is disappointing to those who had hoped for mass relocation. As R. B. Schmerl observed after reading this chapter: “That hasn’t happened. By far the largest Jewish community in the world is American, with over five million Jews. Only an insignificant number of American Jews have emigrated to Israel. I suspect that more Israelis have come to the U.S. than Americans have moved to Israel.”\n\n7. Smooha, Israel: Pluralism and Conflict, p. 381.\n\n8. S. N.

Such groups include the Karaites and the Samaritans. It is not clear from my sources, however, how these groups are classified for census purposes. The details of the history, beliefs, and practices of the two sects are found in Alan D. Crown, “The Samaritans in 1984,” Yod 10, 20 (1984): 9–31; and Mordecai Roshwald, “Marginal Jewish Sects in Israel II,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 4 (1973): 328–34.\n\n13.

The Jewish and Arab populations agree that they prefer having separate systems of education for their communities to accommodate their respective linguistic, religious, and cultural traditions. Hence, with the exception of tertiary-level education, the two communities send their children to their own schools. Arabs comprise 17 percent of the total population of Israel. Among the Arab population, 80 percent are Muslim and the remainder are Druze and Christian. The languages of instruction in the Arab schools are Arabic and English; Hebrew is taught as a third language. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that at the university level, Hebrew is the primary language of instruction and examination. As a result, Arabs are under represented at this level. Because of a lack of qualified teachers, insufficient teaching-learning aids, and inadequate buildings and facilities, the quality of Arab education in Israel is below the standard enjoyed by the Jewish population. National laws such as compulsory education and the education of girls as well as boys apply equally to the Arab and Jewish populations.\n\n34. Eisenstadt, Israeli Society, p. 267.\n\n35. Adler, “School Integration.”\n\n36. Smooha, Israel: Pluralism and Conflict, p. 265.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\n1. The term Falasha has been commonly used within and outside Ethiopia; it derives from the Ge’ez or Amharic word meflas, “to remove.”\n\n2. The monarchy was periodically challenged by some agew usurpers such as those of Lalibela fame who ruled between the tenth and thirteenth centuries. In 1270, the throne was restored to the Solomonic line and, with a few exceptions in the nineteenth century, continued until the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and his mysterious death while under house arrest a year later.\n\n3. The Ethiopia of that time, or Abyssinia proper, was confined to highland Ethiopia, which became the strong home base of the two major monotheistic peoples, the Jews and Christians.\n\n4. One of the difficulties for the Beta Israel people has been and continues to be this lack of total recognition of their full Jewishness both by the people in their land of origin and by other Jews in Israel. The continued controversy over reconversion issues in Israel is directly linked to this vital question.\n\n5. Some speak of the Beta Israel versus the Amharas. This contrast is misleading. The Jews are Amhara. It should be, rather, the Jews versus the Orthodox Christians.\n\n6. The Beta Israel as a minority were for the most part landless. In a society where land was highly valued not only for its economic worth but for its psychological importance and prestige as well, to be without land was more than being poor; it made one subject to severe exploitation. To compensate for their poverty, the Beta Israel concentrated on developing and perfecting skills in areas in which the other members of society were not interested but which were vital to the community and appreciated as such. Nonetheless, the perfection of skills also aroused other types of problems, such as the taib syndrome mentioned above.\n\n7. The Democratic Charter, announced in 1976, simply states that all religious, linguistic, and ethnic groups of Ethiopia will enjoy freedom and equal rights without any interference by the government. This means that the power of the state church was no more and that the Beta Israel, as one such group, presumably would enjoy equality in all sectors of national life. See Teshome Wagaw, “Emerging Issues of Ethiopian Nationalities: Cohesion or Disintegration,” Journal of Northeast African Studies 2, 3 (1980–81): 69–75; and Teshome Wagaw, The Development of Higher Education and Social Change: An Ethiopian Experience (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1990).\n\n8. See David Kessler, The Falashas: The Forgotten Jews of Ethiopia (New York: Schocken Books, 1985).\n\n9. For the politicization of the students and their roles in social change, see Teshome Wagaw, “The Burden and Glory of Being Schooled: An Ethiopian Dilemma,” in Seven Rubenson, eds, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, University of Lund, 26–29 April 1982 (Uppsala: Scandinavian Institute of African Studies, 1984), pp. 487–96.\n\n10. The strength of the armed forces has grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade. For instance, in 1974, the combined total was fifty thousand men, including the police force. By the mid-1980s, that number had grown to a three-hundred-thousand-man standing force, making one of the poorest countries in Africa the first in military power after Egypt.\n\n11. Payne and Parafit both assert that during this period, the Israeli government also was assisting in development projects among the Beta Israel areas until it was frightened by what this might eventually entail, i.e., the desire on the part of the Ethiopians to want to immigrate en masse to Israel, for which it was not prepared even to imagine. Eric Payne, Ethiopian Jews: The Story of a Mission (London: Olive Press, 1972), pp. 30–60; and Tudor Parafit, Operation Moses (London: Widenfeld and Nicholson, 1986) pp. 39–41.\n\n12. As noted above, under the new Marxist government of Ethiopia, the special privileges of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church as a state church were done away with. From now on, presumably all religions would be treated on the same footing without any partiality. This change might have inspired hope on the part of the minority religious communities, including the Beta Israel.\n\n13. This information was provided in July 1985 by Michael Baruch Eshkol, who was part of the leadership, and is now living in Kiryat Gat, Israel. Ironically, ORT’s activities (improving the lot of the Beta Israel in Ethiopia) also were opposed by certain Jewish organizations, such as the American Association for Ethiopian Jews, for trying to subvert the plans to help the Ethiopians migrate to Israel. Also see Leon Shapiro, The History of ORT (New York: Schocken Books, 1980), pp. 321–24.\n\n14. Payne, Ethiopian Jews.\n\n15. Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to the Country and People (London: Oxford University Press, 1972) pp. 110–12; Wolf Leslau, Falasha Anthology (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1951) p. xli; G.J. Abbink, The Falashas in Ethiopia and Israel: The Problem of Cultural Assimilation (Nijemegen, Neth.: Institute for Cultural and Social Anthropology, 1984) doctoral thesis, pp. 110–11.\n\n16. The term legal here is used in the sense that the act was carried out with deliberate cooperation of the constituted government even if that government itself was not constituted legally. Otherwise, there was no statute that provided for the act of emigration.\n\n17. Parafit, Operation Moses, pp. 35–62.\n\n18. These early conflicts continue to influence current alliances and government policies in the region. See “In Sudan, Tide Turns against the U.S.,” New York Times, April 29, 1986.\n\n19. The maltreatments are reportedly from Sudanese camp officials as well as from non-Jewish Ethiopians. To the extent that they were identified as Jews in an Arab country, perhaps this was not surprising. The motive of the Ethiopians who might have participated in the maltreatment of the Beta Israel may lie in the need to survive amid very limited resources and/or may be a result of traditional religious prejudices brought with them from Ethiopia.\n\n20. Interviews with the survivors in Jerusalem, July 1985.\n\n21. Major Melaku Teferra was born and raised in Debre Tabor, Gondar region, and is a graduate of the elite Harar Military Academy. His relatives were important government officials throughout the reign of Haile Selassie. He, however, is not only one of the original members of the Derg but a very fanatical one. This might have stemmed from either his need to prove himself a radical Marxist in the eyes of other Derg members or, as some have suggested, his will to avenge past grievances his relatives might have had against the Beta Israel. At any rate, in his positions as governor of Gondar and, more recently, regional representative to the Communist party, he has done more physical, mental, and property damage in the area than any of the other Derg members, with the exception of Lieutenant-Colonel Mengistu Hailemariam, the Derg’s chairman and later president of the country. When the Mengistu government was overthrown in May 1991 and he fled to Zimbabwe as a refugee, many of his cronies were apprehended and as of June 1992 were languishing in prison awaiting trial. Melaku Teferra, however, escaped, and his whereabouts are unknown.\n\n22. The Reagan administration already had committed some resources for the operation, but these were neither large nor public up to this time.\n\n23. Nimeiri was right to fear what this might entail. As a member of the Arab League, he could not have taken steps that might seem cooperative with Israel and hope to stay in power. His country was not Egypt, and Egypt, though it might have sympathized with his conditions, could not openly have supported his actions. How much empathy he was getting from the American and Israeli governments was never clear.\n\n24. Parafit, Operation Moses, p. 96.\n\n25. This exchange was dramatized during the official trial of Momar Tayeb in the fall of 1985 in the Sudan. See note 37 below.\n\n26. Most of the major Israeli and international papers scrambled for the news. See “An Airlift to the Promised Land,” Time, February 14, 1985; “Politicians Wrangle over Secrecy Breakdown,” Jerusalem Post, January 7, 1985; “An Unfinished Rescue,” Jerusalem Post, January 6, 1985; “Ethiopians Upset and Bitter over Airlift Halt,” Jerusalem Post, January 6, 1985; “Airline Stops Ethiopian Rescue,” “U.S. Officials Angered by Lifting of Censorship,” and “Belgian Charter Firm: ‘Publicity Stopped Us.’” Jerusalem Post, January 7, 1985.\n\n27. “An Exodus Mired in Politics,” Macleans, January 21, 1985.\n\n28.

In December 1985, at an international conference in Nigeria, I had a chance to discuss the issue of the trials with one university chancellor and two professors of political science. They were unanimous that the cooperation of Sudan in the airlift was wrong. But each gave different reasons. The chancellor maintained that Sudan should not have helped Israel in any way. The second man maintained that the major crime was making the Sudanese security apparatus available to the service of foreign governments. The third one, admitting that the trials were the most popular entertainment in the country then, said that for Nimeiri’s government to have accepted money for cooperation in the airlift was an insult to the Sudanese people. All three said they had nothing against the Ethiopian Jews themselves.\n\n33. See, for example, “U.S. Fearing ‘Another Tehran’ Plans Partial Pullout from Sudan,” New York Times, April 17, 1986; “Embassy Threatened,” New York Times, April 17, 1986, p. 9; and “Sudan: Qaddafi Calling,” Newsweek, April 14, 1986.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\n1. In May 1991, another massive airlift known as Operation Solomon, brought about 14,500 more immigrants to Israel. This latest addition is not treated in this book. It will be mentioned in the final chapter.\n\n2. In some of the youth centers where the two groups live together, the differences are apparent. On occasion, there have been fights between the two groups. The rural youth accuse those coming from the urban centers of wanting to have it both ways. That is, because of their good education and the modernizing influences of the cities, the urban youth were relatively well off and well accepted in Ethiopia; now, once in Israel as Jews, they continue to enjoy relative advantages over youth of rural background. The latecomers also tend to maintain greater positive feelings and pride for their cultural heritage, and tend to maintain more attachment to Ethiopia in general. Where such misunderstandings occur, the authorities at such centers have tended to side with the majority, those who originate from the rural areas, on the grounds that they are more genuine Beta Israel than the others. However, veteran Ethiopians brought in to deal with such cases have warned the authorities against such discriminatory attitudes.\n\n3. Demographic information is based on the 1986 report of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem.\n\n4. Once in Israel, the traditional skills men possessed, such as farming, masonry, weaving, and the like, have become nonfunctional. Therefore, in the new situation, the lack of usable skills applies to men as well as women.\n\n5. Based on data obtained from a publication of the Jewish Agency and the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, Government of Israel, titled, “The Absorption of Ethiopian Jews: A Master Plan,” Jerusalem, August 1985, pp. 23–26. The total 1988 Ministry of Immigrant Absorption estimate of the Beta Israel population was sixteen thousand. This total takes into account, as the document does not, the number of Beta Israel already in the country before 1980 (about four hundred), those who arrived in small groups or individually since 1985, and those born in Israel subsequent to immigration.\n\n6.

Joseph Halevy, Travels in Abyssinia, 1867, translated from the French and published in English by James Picciotto, 1877. The passage quoted here is from the English version, p. 227. Halevy visited some of the Beta Israel villages in the Lake Tana area in the winter of 1864. He seems to have mastered the Amharic language well enough to understand and converse with the local population. Since his stay in Ethiopia did not exceed a year, it can be presumed that he had studied the Amharic language and perhaps Ge’ez as well (the language of liturgy at the time) before arriving in Gondar.\n\n9. See, for instance, Donald Levine, Wax and Gold (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965).\n\n10. For studies regarding values and practices associated with child rearing in rural Ethiopia, see Teshome Wagaw, “Attitudes and Values concerning Children among the Menz in Rural Ethiopia,” Journal of Psychology 94 (1976), pp. 257–60.\n\n11. A considerable body of literature exists in this area. In the case of Ethiopia, see Teshome Wagaw, “The Burden and Glory of Being Schooled: An Ethiopian Dilemma,” in Sven Rubenson, Proceedings of the Seventh International Association of Ethiopian Studies (Lund, Sweden: University of Lund, 1982), pp. 487–96.

Although these skills are not actively taught to young women in Israel because of lack of time on the part of the girls, the older women who practice them receive a handsome price for the products.\n\n14. Rachel Astman, in charge of the planning and research department of the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, gave these estimates. The information is consistent with that from the Jewish Agency. See the plan document of the Government of Israel, “The Absorption of Ethiopian Jews: Master Plan,” Jerusalem, Summer 1985, pp. 1–151.\n\n15. Although the establishment of the committee was known to the public, its reports remained confidential. The information was supplied to me by a committee member.\n\n16. For the significance of this loss, see, for instance, Emanuela T. Semi, “The Beta Israel (Falashas): From Purity to Impurity,” Jewish Journal of Sociology 27, 2 (December 1985) pp. 103–14.\n\n17.

These accounts are based on data supplied by individual informants and the Jewish Agency and, more importantly, on the report of the comptroller’s office of the Israeli government, a watchdog of departmental activities. The part of the latter document entitled “Initial Absorption of the Ethiopian Immigrants,” pp. 127–68, was released in 1986. Information was updated to 1987–88 by way of telephone interviews with people who have continued to be closely involved with the absorption and adaptation processes in Israel.\n\n4. This is in addition to the forty-four or so Youth Aliyah villages that house and educate young people of high school age. (See Chapter 8 of this book.) Several other centers were especially established to care for younger orphaned children as well.\n\n5. The authorities were acutely aware of these realities, at least at the planning stage. See Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, “The Absorption of Ethiopian Jews,” pp. 3–4.\n\n6. This analysis benefits from the evaluation of the Office of the Comptroller as outlined in its 1986 report entitled “Initial Absorption of Ethiopian Immigrants,” pp. 127–68, and the reply to the same document by the Jewish Agency under the same title, February 1987, pp. 29–35.\n\n7.

For the major religious works of the Beta Israel, see Wolf Leslau, Falasha Anthology (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1951).\n\n3. When they are told that the kind of Judaism they practiced in Ethiopia is outdated or has been modified by the teachings of the Oral Law, some Beta Israeli mischievously reply, “We did not know that we were to add to God’s Law.” They say this in spite of the fact that they made their own modifications. (Ibid.)\n\n4. See David Kessler, The Falashas: The Forgotten Jews of Ethiopia (New York: Schocken Books, 1985), pp. 106–29.\n\n5. Ibid., pp. 74–80.\n\n6. It has been said that the resistance to grant the Beta Israel the right to immigrate to Israel for so long relates to race more than any other single factor. Other communities such as the Samaritans and the Karaites, which not only are non-Talmudic but actively refuse to be instructed in Talmud, have been accepted in Israel. The Ethiopians, while admitting that they were not versed in the Halakah or Oral Law, were at least willing to learn about it. See Kessler, The Falashas, pp. 58–73.\n\n7. The contents of the memorandum and the letter are reported to exist in the files of the chief rabbinate’s office. Although I was not able to review the original letters, I have no doubt that they exist and that the contents conveyed by the spokesman of the rabbinate, Rabbi Eliahu Ben Dehan, are, barring translation errors, accurate. However, as an anthropologist who has followed the case closely stated, those were very hard days for Ethiopian Jewry. They might have promised anything. See Haim Shapiro, “Chief Rabbinate Says Documents from ‘66 and ‘71 Show: Ethiopian Jews Promised to Convert,” Jerusalem Post, November 17, 1985.\n\n8. Tamrat Emmanuel, a highly learned Beta Israel, suggested in the 1950s that mass migration was inadvisable. He favored sending select youth to Israel and other countries for the purpose of education and training; other changes would follow.\n\n9. Actually, in relative terms, the lot of the Beta Israel and other minorities in Ethiopia improved. The 1976 charter established the equality of all religious and linguistic or ethnic groups in Ethiopia and abolished state support for any religious group. For a time, optimism among the Beta Israel and their supporters prevailed. Implementing the ideals embodied in the Charter proved difficult, however.\n\n10. Secular scholarship maintained that the Beta Israel were one of a number of groups found in Ethiopia whose religious beliefs had elements of Judaism. Among the secular scholars who are often cited are Edward Ullendorff of the University of London and Wolf Leslau of the University of California. The rabbinate used this position when it demanded conversion of the olim in the 1980s. See Yedidya Atlas, “Rabbinical Perspective,” Jerusalem Post, November 8, 1985.\n\n11. For a more complete analysis, see Teshome Wagaw, “Ethiopia, Israel, and the Resettlement of the Falashas,” CAAS Newsletter (Winter 1986): 1–11.\n\n12. See Haim Shapiro, “Goren Himself Had Ethiopians Convert,” Jerusalem Post, February 28, 1985.\n\n13. See Teshome Wagaw, “The Emigration and Settlement of Ethiopian Jews in Israel,” Middle East Review 20, 2 (1987/88): 41–48.\n\n14. Ibid.\n\n15. Dr. Michael Corinaldi, an Israeli lawyer who specializes in the legal affairs of marginal Jews and represents them in Israeli courts, asserted, in an interview, that the Jewishness of the Beta Israel is not the question. Their physical characteristics and religious books are similar to those obtaining in earlier Jewish traditions. The only difference is that, for a long time, the Ethiopians lacked a spokesperson who could defend their interests effectively.\n\n16. In 1985, when the issues of conversion surfaced, two new chief rabbis—Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Avraham Shapiro and Sephardi Chief Rabbi Mordecai Eliahu—were installed. The two former chief rabbis, Ovadia Yosef (Sephardi) and Shlomo Goren (Ashkenazi), concurred between 1973 and 1975 that the Ethiopians were Jews. Both rabbis based their judgment on the works of Eldad Hadani and, more importantly, Rabbi David Ben Zimra. Also during the tenure of Yosef and Goren giyyur (certificates of conversion) were issued. However, when the former chief rabbis declared in 1985 that the Ethiopians did not have to undergo mass conversion, their successors said they had contradicted themselves. The former chief rabbis denied that they had reversed themselves; if they had issued giyyur, it was only to certify the facts already in existence. See, for instance, Shapiro, “Goren Himself Had Ethiopians Convert.”\n\n17. For a more complete explanation of the chief rabbinate’s position, see the article written by the spokesman for the chief rabbinate, Yedidya Atlas, “Rabbinical Perspectives.”\n\n18. The early wave of immigrants were persuaded that since they did not have the Talmud or Hebrew in their tradition, and since there might have been irregularities regarding marriages and divorce, it would be to the immigrants’ long-term advantage to accept mass conversion, which they did. But even then, the Israeli public was fully aware that other immigrants, such as the Russians, who intermarried and knew nothing about Judaism, were unconditionally accepted as Jews upon arrival in Israel. Such discrepancies contribute to ill feelings. For a more complete discussion, see Louis Rapoport, “Black Jews in Crisis,” Jerusalem Post, international edition, April 19, 1986. For an explanation of the position of the chief rabbinate, see Atlas, “Rabbinical Perspective.”\n\n19. By now, young Beta Israel youth such as Addisu Messele, who had migrated a few years earlier with the first wave and had gone through the rituals as required, were having second thoughts about the whole issue. They began to urge the newcomers to refuse the reconversion demands.\n\n20. The ordination of Adane antedated the migration of the Beta Israel. It was also logical that he should be consulted by the rabbinate. But politically, it proved lethal for him. The Beta Israel viewed him as a lackey of the chief rabbinate and effectively rejected his services. This was unfortunate for the community and for this intelligent, unassuming, and pleasant young man. For Adane’s views of his position in relation to the Beta Israel community, see Rapoport, “Black Jews in Crisis.” Adane is a young, very highly educated Beta Israel. However, since he sided with the chief rabbinate in its decisions to require the Beta Israel to go through the ritual immersion, he was effectively excluded from having any kind of influence on the immigrants. The rabbi complains that his advice is completely ignored by the Ethiopian community. See Haim Shapiro, “Ethiopian Rabbi Laments ‘Strike’ Damage,” Jerusalem Post, international edition, January 18, 1986.\n\n21. The report and recommendations of the blue-ribbon committee are in, “Public Statement,” Jerusalem Post, September 29, 1985.\n\n22. Ibid.\n\n23. Actually, some of the more thoughtful citizens thought that, contrary to reports in the media dominated by liberal secularists, “there was no groundswell of support for the Ethiopian cause.” For an articulate assessment of this and other aspects of the controversy, see Rapoport, “Black Jews in Crisis.”\n\n24. This assertion is only partially true. As the rabbinate points out, some five hundred immigrants a year undergo the conversion requirements. Also, in the 1960s, the Benei Israel (Jews from India) were required to undergo reconversion. After bitter protests, however, the requirement was dropped. Many Russian immigrants who intermarried with Gentiles and knew very little, if anything, about Halakah and other aspects of Judaism, were admitted without the conversion requirements. The Beta Israel are aware of these cases and effectively use them to advance their cause. See S. N. Eisenstadt, Israeli Society (New York: Basic Books, 1967), pp. 312–16; and Elizer Jaffe, “Ethiopian Politics,” Jerusalem Post, October 1, 1985.\n\n25. I was in Kiryat Arba, a Jewish settlement in the historic city of Hebron, when the protests were beginning to emerge. The Ethiopians were confused. Some veteran Israelis were urging them not to sit and wait but to get up and march.\n\n26. See “Ethiopians Threaten Suicide,” Jerusalem Post, July 19, 1985.\n\n27. Judy Siegel, “Ethiopians Meet Peres,” Jerusalem Post, July 22, 1985.\n\n28. Haim Shapiro, “Ethiopians Are Cautious about Peres’ Formula,” Jerusalem Post, July 24, 1985.\n\n29. The question of who is a Jew is the subject of much discussion and disagreement. The generally accepted definition is that anyone born of a Jewish mother is a Jew. But there are problems involving conversion. Until 1989, the Israeli rabbinate resisted recognition of anyone converted by Reform and Progressive branches of Judaism. Yet the overwhelming majority of Diaspora Jews are members of these movements. The case of Shoshanna Miller, who was converted to Judaism in the United States and wanted to migrate to Israel, is instructive. The Israeli minister of interior refused to register her as a Jew. After months of legal battles, the high court ruled in her favor. It was not until 1989 that the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that persons converted to Judaism by non-Orthodox rabbis have the right to migrate to Israel as Jews. See “Israeli Supreme Court Rules on ‘Who Is a Jew’ Argument,” Ann Arbor News, July 25, 1989.\n\n30. It is standard procedure that all Jewish women are immersed before marriage. It is the immersion of the prospective groom that is problematic.\n\n31. The Beta Israel must have gotten their inspiration from the Benei Israel, who had similar grievances in the 1960s. See Eisenstadt, Israeli Society, pp. 312–14.\n\n32. Jaffe, “Ethiopian Politics.”\n\n33. Abba Eban, “Religious Challenge,” Jerusalem Post, July 19, 1985.\n\n34. The rabbinate was always sensitive to what it considered its prerogatives vis-à-vis the office of the prime minister. See Atlas, “Rabbinical Perspectives”; and Eban, “Public Statement”\n\n35. Many supporters of the Ethiopians now believe the strikers made a gross blunder by not accepting the terms offered. With the holy days coming, the rabbinate was more likely to be conciliatory, and the strikers would have gained much more public support. In part, this is attributed to the lack of sophistication about political realities in Israel on the part of the strike leaders.\n\n36. “Till the Next Time,” Jerusalem Post, October 4, 1985.\n\n37. In Israel, for a long time, only the Orthodox stream of Judaism had the right to interpret, decide, and implement the rules governing marriage and divorce and determining who is a Jew. The others, including the Reform and Conservative branches, remained powerless. In 1987, the highest court of Israel ruled that persons converted to Judaism by non-Orthodox rabbis have the right to come to Israel as Jews. See “Israeli Supreme Court Rules.”\n\n38. In addition, mostly in highland Ethiopia, there are other names given to older brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, grandparents, and older people. See Susan Hoben, “Kin Terms of Reference and Kin Terms of Address in Amharic of Menz,” in Harold Marcus, ed., Proceedings of the First U.S. Conference on Ethiopian Studies, East Lansing, Mich., 1973, pp. 279–89.\n\n39. Some Ethiopians continue to use their original names when they introduce themselves to strangers. Others use both names. A few have reverted entirely to their original names.\n\n40. Eisenstadt, The Absorption of Immigrants, pp. 1–26.\n\n41. When I visited Bogale at his home in July 1985, he let me feel and understand that he was very concerned with the plight of the immigrants in Israel. He said leadership was lacking and the immigrants were adrift. As in Ethiopia, the Ethiopians in Israel were ungrateful and suspicious of the motives of others. He compared his efforts on behalf of the Beta Israel to those of Haile Selassie on behalf of Ethiopia. With dedication, both did what they could for their people, though the efforts were not appreciated. I came to feel that he wished the Israeli authorities would give him some well-deserved recognition for his accomplishments and allow him to continue to provide leadership. This feeling of not being recognized in Israel has been mentioned by others. See, for instance, Ruth Gruber, Rescue (New York: Atheneum, 1987), pp. 99–133.\n\n42. Leslau, Falasha Anthology.\n\n43. For an interesting analysis of the relationships and significance of rituals and leadership, see T. E. Semi, “The Beta Israel (Falashas): From Purity to Impurity,” Jewish Journal of Sociology 27, 2 (December 1985): 103–14.\n\n44. Official announcements and declarations by the emperors, including Haile Selassie, began with “Mo anbessa Ze-imnegede yihuda. . . . Kibuae egziabher, nigusa-negest Ze-Ethiopia” (“Of the tribe of Judah. . . . Anointed of God, king of kings of Ethiopia”).\n\n45. The leaders of student organizations in Ethiopia were leftist, and some individuals may have been communists. It would not be surprising if the Beta Israel youth now leading their respective organizations in Israel are of similar persuasion. One of the leaders, Addisu Messele, did not disavow the claim.\n\n46. There are exceptions, of course. For instance, some young people are conservative and nonliterate, and some older nonliterate members are progressive in their outlook. In general, however, the categorization applies. It should be remembered that the schooled youth are still in the minority—they represent about 37 percent of the relevant age groups and an even smaller percentage of the entire Beta Israel population.\n\n47. See Leslau, Falasha Anthology, p. xxiii.\n\n48. As of 1985, seven such amutot, or nonprofit, organizations were registered with the Ministry of Interior.\n\n49. Jaffe, “Ethiopian Politics.”\n\n50. This can be explained in terms of ethnic disharmony and conflict of interest. The Tigray and other groups had arrived in Israel before 1984. They went through immersion and other requirements and had some additional time to adjust to the environment. As a result, their concerns are a little different from the others, and they are less involved in many of the activities.\n\n51. These views were expressed during a series of interviews with the respective leaders in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv in the spring of 1987.\n\n52. See Jaffe’s excellent analysis of the leadership dilemma in “Ethiopian Politics.”\n\n53. Ibid.\n\n54. Addisu Messele’s critics maintain that he exploits the sentiments of the uneducated segment of the Beta Israel population; they also challenge his estimations of the number who support him.\n\n55. At one juncture, some Knesset members expressed a need to investigate the communist influence among the leadership. The idea was quickly rejected by other politicians.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\n1. Several of the seven universities have teacher-training components. The most important for the religious system is Bar Ilan University, which is a religious institution. Most of the religious secondary schools are supplied with teachers educated by this institution.\n\n2. Before I discovered the reasons for this disproportionate representation in religious schools, I shared my observation with one of the school principals;. He responded that it is God’s will; “we have no say in that matter.”\n\n3. The phenomenon of religious fundamentalism in the Middle East is not limited to Islam. Israeli youth also are moving in that direction.\n\n4. Israel’s population is composed of Jews and Arabs. Within the Arab group there are Muslims, Druze, and Christians.\n\n5. Information provided by David Pur (Ashkenazi), director of pedagogical services, Ministry of Education and Culture, Jerusalem; and Amram Melitz (Oriental), director of the religious schools of the southern region. Their views are identical regarding the general operational structure of the educational systems, although their philosophies differ for the obvious reason.\n\n6. Israel is a democratic state within the Green Line (pre-1967 boundary) and for the Jewish segment of society. Being made up of Jews and Arabs, the State permits different types of obligations and responsibilities for Muslim, Druze and Christian citizens. For instance, for obvious reasons the Muslims do not serve in the Israeli Army.\n\n7. The interview with Eli Dayan took place in his office in Ashkelon with the help of a translator on March 28, 1987.\n\n8. The only exception I noticed was an American who taught English in a high school in Kiryat Arba, who insisted that the children address her as “Doctor.”\n\n9. The relationships between the northern Africans and the Ethiopians are not consistent. In the northern settlement towns, northern Africans consistently refer to the Ethiopians as “they,” and this is not always said in favorable tones. Orientals in the southern region are more likely to point out the cultural affinities between themselves and the Ethiopians. They are of the opinion that the Beta Israel children are better off in schools attended mostly by Oriental children, most of whom attend religious schools. The Beta Israel do not express any preference between the Ashkenazim and Sephardim or Orientals, at least not at the verbal level.\n\n10. Adler, one of Israel’s most knowledgeable senior scholars, has studied migrant education and thinks that segregated learning, at least in the initial periods, may not be bad in itself. However, it is bad if the Beta Israel children are not exposed to the sort of stimulating experiences that come from peers who are socially different and motivated to learn.\n\n11. In traditional Ethiopia, students were not supposed to call attention to themselves by investing time in making themselves physically attractive. Such attitudes might have spilled over to modern times.\n\n12. The religious schools are losing students without the additional complication brought about by the presence of the Beta Israel. Personnel in the religious schools are therefore careful to avoid any situation or decision that may alienate veteran parents. But these political and practical survival considerations do not help fulfill the urgent learning needs of the Beta Israel.\n\n13. A report issued by the government comptroller’s office in 1986 indicated that although research has shown that early integration in housing resulted in an accelerated rate of absorption, the Jewish Agency kept the Ethiopians in the sheltered, protected environment of the absorption centers for too long.\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\n1. See Teshome Wagaw, “Education and Society in Contemporary Ethiopia,” Proceedings of the Ninth International Congress of Ethiopian Studies, Moscow, 1986, pp. 34–43.\n\n2. Birth records are not kept in the parts of Ethiopia where most of the Beta Israel come from. School records are not available because many left the country secretly.\n\n3. B.

Rabbi Cohen and his wife were awarded the Knesset Speaker’s Prize in 1985 for their leadership in the institution that contributed the most to the quality of life in Israel, specifically for services to the Ethiopian youth and children.\n\n7. In May 1987, this occurred in the context of Jerusalem Day as a part of the celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the reunification of the city following the 1967 war and the defeat of Jordan.\n\n8. No one says these institutions are adequate substitutes. But in the absence of the primary educative forces that intact homes usually provide, institutions such as Youth Aliyah may represent the next best alternative.\n\n9. See Teshome G. Wagaw, “Ethiopia, Israel, and the Resettlement of the Falashas,” CAAS Newsletter 2, 2 (1986): 1–11.\n\n10. In addition, other vital documents such as marriage and divorce records were lacking which caused havoc and confusion in the delineation of legal family relationships, lineage, etc.\n\n11. Using expressions like group-think, this complaint is commonly made by personnel in many of the villages.\n\n12. The rabbinate calls it conversion; the Beta Israel and the media call it reconversion.\n\n13. This question was raised because in some of the other institutions controlled by religious institutions, including one university, Beta Israel students had reported that faculty had become hostile toward them as a result of their refusal to follow the rabbinate requirements for reconversion. The ultra-Orthodox organization Agudat Israel has refused to accept Beta Israel students to its primary schools because of doubts raised about the authenticity of their Jewishness.\n\n14. The Moroccans regret the loss of their culture. They came in the 1950s, when the country was under great stress, and they feel now that they were unfairly required to adopt European culture of the state and that they gave in too readily to the seduction. Today they are trying to revive their former culture which is no easy task. They hope the Ethiopians do not succumb to the “melting pot” trap.\n\n15. The changing of names may have some rationality if done properly, that is, in consultation with the person involved or, better yet, if the concerned person initiates the change. The official reason given for the name changes is that many of the names reflect the conditions of the Diaspora, and so, once a person is in Israel, the name should fall in line with the new realities. Many well-known Israelis, such as David BenGurion and Golda Meir, changed their names. Others changed their first names but retained their surnames. In the case of the Beta Israel, however, the change was complete, including those who already had Hebrew names such as Abraham, Yakov, and Sara. In retrospect, many Beta Israel consider the act an affront to their person and culture.\n\n16. Like any other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel believe that through the intervention of the right people nearly any policy or decision can be changed. In this case, the situation was compounded by the fact that the concept of ability to learn or intelligence was not in their vocabulary. Anyone can learn, or at least earn a passing grade, goes the assumption, if only the teacher is understanding or is well disposed toward the individual. Seldom do the children or their parents say an examination was failed for lack of ability or study. Instead, phrases such as “The teacher failed me” or “The teacher failed my child” are used.\n\n17. Those Beta Israel who migrated before 1984–85 were relatively more able than the latecomers to mix and interact with veteran Israelis perhaps because they were fewer and the circumstances of their migration were much less traumatic. This also may reflect the cultural expectations and other differences between the two groups. Most of those who came early were members of ethnic minorities in Tigray.\n\n18. Since this observation was made, I heard (in a telephone conversation with Haim Rosen at the end of April 1989) that the Beta Israel youth who have joined the IDF are doing so well that some have been subjects of a documentary film. In a society that values its armed men so highly, this kind of distinction will serve the Ethiopians very well in terms of public relations and acceptance in the mainstream of society.\n\n19. This is not exceptional. Although most schoolteachers and center workers are women, it is rare to find them in administrative positions. When a question about this was posed to the village director, he smiled and said nothing. I have heard no one complaining about the absence of women in administrative positions.\n\n20. Actually, this is much more complicated than it appears. By tradition, almost all young people enter into marriages arranged by their elders. Is one then to conclude that all marriages are “forced” upon the couples and therefore subject to renegotiation at a later time?\n\n21. As a rule, the absorption center social workers are young and progressive in many respects, including regarding sexuality. They do openly tell women how to practice family planning and avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\n22. It is a common phenomenon reported by many center personnel that the Ethiopians often get headaches or stomach aches. These ailments are associated with their emotional states.\n\n23. Among the general population of Beta Israel, thirty-two people, most of whom were young, took their own lives between 1985 and 1987. Most informants think this is a higher incidence than that among the larger Jewish population in Israel.\n\n24. Aleka (Amharic, meaning “chief,” “learned,” or “leader”) is a respected title usually given to a man of high learning in the religious or secular realms. But it is also used by sorcerers, or tenuity or balezar, who as a rule also claim to have a higher calling because they can communicate with the spirit world and heal the sick. The three men mentioned in the text are highly respected personalities in the Beta Israel community. A tenuity, by the way, could be a man or a woman, but the woman does not assume the title Aleka, only the practice. Psychiatric experts do not discount the merit of such practices for the people who believe in them.\n\n25. I am grateful to the authorities in Israel for letting me have access to the archives for scholarly purposes.\n\n26. At the end of the letter, besides the names of the senders, a Muslim name is listed, which perhaps serves as a code name for purposes of bank account transactions between Ethiopia and outsiders.\n\n27. The names of the mother, the father and the one who composed the letter (most likely a relative) are listed as senders.\n\n28. The ferenj referred to here is most likely a white Israeli or American who had come as a tourist or through some other guise to assess the situation of the Beta Israel in Ethiopia and carry some money from the Jewish Agency to the people stranded there.\n\n29. This refers to the fact that at one time in the mid-1980s, many of the Beta Israel community sold their animals and belongings thinking they would come to Israel. When they failed to get out, they were faced with formidable problems. The Jewish Agency tried to send money to help them become reestablished. The children and relatives who made it to Israel were very helpful in supplying the necessary information so that the monies would get to the right people.\n\n30. The father, mother, a sister, and a brother are listed as senders of this letter. Usually, the one who composes such letters is one of the younger members of the family who, as a rule, may be the only literate one. The adults either dictate or tell what they want to convey to the young writer. As a general rule, the writer identifies himself or herself by adding “written by” at the end of the letter.\n\n31. When, for political reasons, it is impossible to send money directly from Israel to Ethiopia, third countries such as the United States are used. Even with this route, the problems of nondelivery persist.\n\n32. There are institutions serving similar purposes in other societies, such as the United States, but these are often local ventures sponsored by religious organizations, not national commitments as in the Israeli case.\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\n1. My categorization of the immigrants is similar to that used by the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption in, “The Absorption of Ethiopian Jews: Master Plan,” Jerusalem, August 1985. Also refer to Table 1 in Chapter 4.\n\n2. This dismal lack of even rudimentary education affects all groups of Ethiopians—Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others—in the traditionally conservative regions of Tigray and Gondar, where the vast majority of Beta Israel lived before coming to Israel. Yet these very regions, particularly the cities of Gondar and Axum, are renowned for their eminence in classical literature, theology, music, and the arts. For background on the problems of literacy, see Teshome Wagaw, “Appraisal of Adult Literacy Programs in Ethiopia,” Journal of Reading 21, 6 (1978): 504–8; and, in the same journal issue, Fay Starr and Deretha Starr, “Learning to Read in Ethiopia,” pp. 509–13.\n\n3. In speaking of the generation of those older than forty-five, Uri Gordon, the director-general of Youth Aliyah used the term lost generation, by which he meant that these people would not be able to learn the skills related to language, society, and the world of work.\n\n4. This problem exists in much of the Third World, where large segments of the population are nonliterate. The Israeli approach is interesting in its own right and for its possible application in other societies facing a similar challenge.\n\n5. Since that time, for fear of conscription and more importantly because of a loss of hope in the future of Ethiopia, young people have been leaving the country in droves. As one Ethiopian official recently stated, “Ethiopian youth, even those in the fourth grade, talk and dream of nothing else except to leave the country.” This is a new phenomenon that indicates the unbearable political and social conditions in the country since the mid-1970s. Up to that time, Ethiopians have always preferred to stay home; the “brain drain” that afflicted many other Third World countries was never a problem for Ethiopia.\n\n6. Haim Rosen, his wife Esther, and I traveled to a number of Beta Israel settlements together. Esther is of Yemeni background, and Haim speaks some Tigrigna and Amharic. Both are well accepted by the Beta Israel.\n\n7. Although the rules exclude married people from participating in the Youth Administration Project programs for reasons that their participation may interfere with family life, a few have managed to slip in.\n\n8. The Ethiopian Jews, like many others in the area, kept slaves. When slavery was abolished during the reign of Haile Selassie, the practice de facto continued. Although it has been almost completely eliminated in recent decades, the offspring of the former slaves are identifiable. It is reported that the Jews who were left behind in the Sudanese camps when Operation Moses was interrupted were mostly members of this ex-slave group.\n\n9. Traditionally, this kind of situation did not arise too often because of close supervision, the social stigma attached to a girl’s loss of virginity, and the lack of privacy, among other things.\n\n10. The administrator in charge said that she did not have the budget or the instructors to allow such activity.\n\n11. This relates to another problem I observed in the field. The young adults (ages eighteen to twenty-eight) who had become literate for the first time learned the vocabulary of their trade in Hebrew. Although many of these terms have Amharic or Tigrigna equivalents, those who had not attended school in Ethiopia were not familiar with them. Now, when they tried to converse in their native languages, they included many of the Hebrew terms, and after a while the communication would become tiring or unintelligible.\n\n12. The term the school principal is reported to have used was the Hebrew word for “uncircumcised.” The Beta Israel are very sensitive to such nuances, because they were challenged in Israel that some irregularities in the area of religious rituals might have taken place during the long centuries of isolation from the mainstream of Judaism. The fact of the matter is that the Beta Israel are circumcised on the eighth day after birth, as are their Christian and Muslim counterparts.\n\n13. For background on the Ethiopian education system, see Teshome Wagaw, Education in Ethiopia (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1979). Issues pertaining to higher education are more fully discussed in Teshome Wagaw, The Development of Higher Education and Social Change: An Ethiopian Experience (East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1990). Changes since the 1974 revolution are analyzed in Teshome Wagaw, “Ethiopia: Systems of Education,” in T. Husen and T. Postlethwaite, eds., The International Encyclopedia of Education (New York: Pergamon Press, 1985), pp. 1723–29.\n\n14. For detailed analysis of the kinds of problems this group faced initially, see Teshome Wagaw, “Ethiopia, Israel, and the Resettlement of the Falashas,” CAAS Newsletter (Winter 1986): 1–11; and T. Wagaw, “The Emigration and Settlement of Ethiopian Jews in Israel,” Middle East Review 20, 2 (1987/88): 41–48. For the reaction of the regional and international community to the immigration, see T. Wagaw, “The International Political Ramifications of the Falasha Emigration,” The Journal of Modern African Studies 29, 4 (1991): 557–81.\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\n1. As anthropologist Bronislow Malinowski observed, once a community has opened itself to interaction with other communities, the resulting culture is neither like the first nor like the second. Rather, it assumes a character of its own. So it is with the case at hand. By virtue of the fact that Israel has brought in the Beta Israel community, and in spite of the fact that the paradigm of incorporation is assimilatory by design, the Beta Israel community will leave its imprint on the host society.\n\n2. The Jews from northern Africa are classified as either Orientals or Sephardim. Both terms are inadequate, but since they have been used almost universally in the literature, I followed the established appellations.\n\n3. The fact that other people of color had migrated to Israel does not mean the Ethiopians are not conspicuous. On the whole, most of them are darker in skin color than most of the other Israelis, and the texture of their hair is different. Anyone who wants to discriminate based on such superficial nuances will find ample opportunity to do so.\n\n4. Estimates of the number of Beta Israel who lost their lives in the refugee camps in the Sudan or during the journey range from thirty-five hundred to five thousand or more.\n\n5. The separation of the immigrants from relatives and some of the other hardships endured by the Ethiopians were also the experience of most of the European Jews who migrated between 1939 and 1945, and even later.\n\n6. When I travel to different parts of the world, the first question many people ask is how the Falasha are doing. Are they discriminated against because they are black? Most often, such questions come from Africans or African-Americans. When I respond to such queries, some conclude that there must be more than I am willing to divulge. The assumption is that racial discrimination must be very flagrant in Israel. The position I take, based on my research, is that, yes, race is a factor and racism exists, but this is mitigated by the fact that the Ethiopians are Jews. In the eyes of most Israelis, it is unacceptable to discriminate against fellow Jews on account of the color of their skin. Further, the olim have not been in the country long enough for prejudicial attitudes, on both sides, to emerge and solidify their positions.\n\n7. The prevailing view in Israel is that a Jew cannot possibly lead a truly Jewish life as long as he or she lives among a majority of Gentiles. According to this conception, fulfillment can be found only by making aliyah to Israel.\n\n8. See, for instance, David Kessler, The Falashas: The Forgotten Jews of Ethiopia (London: George Allen & Unwing, 1985), p. 154. Kessler argues that the situation for the Falashas was a great deal harder because they not only were innocent of rabbinic teachings but also did not conform to the popular notion of racial purity. Yet, in April 1987, when I interviewed Michael Corinaldi, a noted lawyer in Jerusalem who defends the rights of the Beta Israel in Israeli courts, he suggested that the Ethiopians’ physical features do conform to the notion of Jewishness.\n\n9. The American Association for Ethiopian Jews has used this line of argument several times in its effort to get the attention of the Israeli government. Other writers, including journalists, have argued similarly. See, for example, Louis Rapoport, “Black Jews in Crisis,” Jerusalem Post, international edition, April 19, 1986; and Kessler, The Falashas, pp. 66–67.\n\n10. It was extremely difficult to support the objections of the rabbis in the case of the Jews from India who had some knowledge of Halakah and were not as isolated as the Beta Israel for such a long time. Even then, the Indians were required to undergo conversion. They refused, and the matter was left at that. See Kessler, The Falashas, p. 154; and S. N. Eisenstadt, Israeli Society (New York: Basic Books, 1967) pp. 312–14.\n\n11. Eisenstadt, Israeli Society, pp. 312–14.\n\n12. Some Ethiopian Jews have married Canadians, Americans, and Israeli veterans. Two men who married North American women left Israel to live in their wives’ country of origin. I am aware of two Ethiopians (a woman who had lived in Israel for a dozen years and a man) who married veterans and live in Israel.\n\n13. This is in reference to the controversy over reconversion. Ethiopians are accepted as Israelis the moment they arrive. But to get there in the first place, they must have been accepted as Jews. Once in Israel (for reasons given in Chapter 4), however, they were required to go through ritual reconversion. In the eyes of many religious Jews, this requirement might have cast doubt on their authenticity or fidelity to their religious principles.\n\n14. For discussion of the Moroccan immigrants, see Rivka Bar-Yosef, “The Moroccans: Background to the Problem,” in S. N. Eisenstadt, Rivka Bar-Yosef, and Chain Adler, eds., Integration and Development in Israel (New York: Praeger, 1970), pp, 419–28. See also, Harvey Goldberg, “The Mimuna and the Minority Status of Moroccan Jews,” Ethnology 27, 1 (1976): 75–87.\n\n15. Micha Feldman worked in the department of the Jewish Agency responsible for the settlement of the Beta Israel. He is fluent in Amharic and very much respected among the olim. He also has visited the Beta Israel villages in Ethiopia on more than one occasion. Feldman’s views were corroborated by Sarah Rachmani, a school psychologist in Afula.\n\n16. Kaplan’s views were given in an interview with Greer F. Cashman and appeared under the title “Recording a Culture,” Jerusalem Post, January 11, 1985.\n\n17. Ibid.\n\n18. Ibid.\n\n19. The study group, under the auspices of Professors for Peace in the Middle East, included American professors from a number of different universities. We visited a variety of institutions where talks were given by distinguished politicians, academicians, and private individuals in Israel proper and in the West Bank. The two-week tour was intended to help the professors become acquainted with the issues of war and peace in the Middle East.\n\n20. Ethiopians in general, and those in the highlands in particular, have been spared the humiliating experiences other Africans were subjected to during the period of European colonialism. Hence, it is possible that when confronted with the issue outside their land of origin, either they fail to be sensitive enough to notice it or they are unwilling to admit racial discrimination.\n\n21. People in Ethiopia use the small branches of plants known as yettirs mefakiya to clean their teeth. Modern science is now telling us that some of these plants have the effects of fluoride. Not only do they clean the teeth, they also provide some protection against certain diseases of the gum.\n\n22. This is not quite true, since the Benei Israel and the Yemenites have been settled in Israel since the early 1950s. She might have been referring to the area where she was now working.\n\n23. The Beta Israel who came in 1979 were not as destitute as those who came in 1984–85. The latter had devastating experiences in refugee camps. Yet the issues of race and health were of concern to the veteran community, especially the parents.\n\n24. Beta Israel children were integrated into schools with veteran children, but this does not mean they attended the same classes. This is a first step toward eventual integration at all levels. The rate of progress is dependent on the readiness of the Beta Israel children and local circumstances, including the willingness of the school headmaster and the veteran parents.\n\n25. There are some problems connected with this, as observed in the field. Some of the brightest children, who could have been placed in more advanced classes, were held back because places were not found for them.\n\n26. This is the so-called independent branch or the third part of the school system. Although it gets government subvention, it operates its school very much on its own terms. It is under the control of the ultra-Orthodox religious wing which barely recognizes the validity of the Rabbinate Council. Nonetheless, it used the excuse of the council when it wanted to exclude the Beta Israel. The other branches of the educational system regard the Beta Israel as Israelis and Jews who are entitled to enroll in their schools. For the controversies surrounding the case, see, “Habad School Still Won’t Register Ethiopians,” Jerusalem Post, March 14, 1985; “Beersheba Fights Habad,” Jerusalem Post, May 5, 1985; “Parents Taking City to Court,” Jerusalem Post, August 25, 1985; and “Habad School Must Take Ethiopians,” Jerusalem Post, August 30, 1985.\n\n27. “Habad School Still Won’t Register Ethiopians.”\n\n28. See “Parents Taking City to Court in Row over Habad School,” Jerusalem Post, August 8, 1985.\n\n29. Eisenstadt, Israeli Society, p. 313.\n\n30. This report was given on November 19, 1986, by a group of Beta Israel students attending classes at Boys Town, Jerusalem, but commuting from another center. Haim Rosen, who was with me, thought the other boys rejected the Beta Israel because they thought they were better off materially than the others and this aroused jealousy. Rather, the problem was that the Beta Israel were finding it difficult to catch up with the activities required both in the classrooms and outside, and this reflected negatively on them.\n\n31. My informant did not deny the possibility that the reason could have been racial or cultural prejudice. But he feels these prejudices could have been minimized had the ministry acted prudently.\n\n32. As is the case with many other attitudes, racial attitudes are often learned in context. Unless the two groups have lived in close proximity, opportunities for forming opinions are few. So the Israeli veterans might not have been racists, and may still not be, but the roots of racism are taking hold.\n\n33. Kiryat Arba is located near the historic city of Hebron in the West Bank. The five thousand Jewish settlers, most of whom came from North America and Europe, are politically conservative and ideologically motivated. When the first group of Beta Israel were settled there in 1985, the United States and Egypt protested. Since then, some Beta Israel families have settled there permanently, others temporarily. Under the leadership of the dynamic Yanai Elchanan, an immigrant from South Africa, the integration of the olim is proceeding very well.\n\n34. Ami Bergman, who made the comment on November 25, 1986, is the head of the American Joint Distribution Committee in Jerusalem.\n\n35. This is UN Resolution No. 3379 of November 10, 1975, which refers to the Jewish and Arab communities of Israel and Palestine. This resolution has been decried by World Jewry and its supporters but still remains on the books.\n\n36. On November 6, 1986, in the city of Afula, Aleka Tiruneh, a highly respected member of the Beta Israel community, informed me that in Ethiopia he had nine oxen, many cattle, and was a highly respected upper-middle-class neftegna (a leading member of the Ethiopian resistance forces during the short-lived Italian occupation of 1936–1941). He said he lost all this when he came to Israel. He added that in Israel they look upon him as one of the illiterate Africans who happens to be living there in comfort. He said that although he was one of the few lucky ones—he lost no close relatives in the process of migration—he regrets coming to Israel. I asked him if he had plans to return to Ethiopia. He replied that it was unlikely he would return. He was not necessarily referring to racial discrimination; he was concerned with cultural deprivation and loss of status.\n\n37. Project Renewal is supported by American Jewish organizations to rehabilitate and revitalize depressed areas so that their inhabitants can become healthy and self-sufficient.\n\n38. There have been complaints of racial discrimination by other olim. See, for instance, Ernest Krausz, ed., Studies of Israeli Society (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1980), pp. 147–63, 165–81. A number of my informants, however, seem to be unaware of historical antecedents. They think that incidents are unrelated to the issues of race or they tend to forget about them.\n\n39. The concept of government as a father image, certainly as it pertains to education, is in part a carryover from the earlier years in Haile Selassie’s reign in Ethiopia. Parents were induced to send their children to “modern” schools, and sometimes payments were made to parents to do so. But in recent years, as the demand for education accelerated, that kind of largesse was withdrawn. Public education for those who can get in, however, remains free in Ethiopia. The Beta Israel expect even more from the government in their new home.\n\n40. Stephen Donshik, the United Israel Appeal’s director of program evaluation, expressed concern that the training the Beta Israel are getting may prove inadequate for a changing world and called for a reassessment of training methods and programs. See his article, “Ethiopian Immigrants—Completing the Task,” Jerusalem Post, July 13, 1986.\n\n41. Plenty of manual and construction jobs in Israel are held by the Arab segment of the population. The Beta Israel could do these jobs, but since other Jews have shunned that kind of work, the immigrants may consider the jobs unfit for persons of their cultural background.\n\n42. This information was supplied by Amnon Nave, an official in the Ministry of Labor.\n\n43. Regarding the life of the peasant in highland Ethiopia, see Donald Levine, Wax and Gold: Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965); Joseph Halevy, Travels in Abyssinia, 1877; Teshome Wagaw, “The World of Work in Ethiopian Culture,” unpublished paper, Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, October 1971.\n\n44. In the parts of Ethiopia where the Beta Israel lived, more than 90 percent of the general population owned land. The landless were primarily the Muslims, Addis Christians (New Christians), and Beta Israel. The landholding system was communal, and no single individual balabat (landlord) derived much benefit from tenants. Since the land tenure reform in 1975, individuals now may rent land from the state, but no one owns land in perpetuity.\n\n45. Still, many Beta Israel think the government, in its benevolence and generosity, wants to continue to support them at the levels they enjoyed during their first year in Israel. Idmae lemengist, or “Long live the government,” is the expression they frequently use. They cannot say enough good things about the government (Israel) and America, whose population, they think, is mostly Jewish.\n\n46. Many think it is this realization that prompted the Jewish Agency to terminate their stay in the absorption centers abruptly in the winter of 1986. This sudden act precipitated much rancor on the part of the Beta Israel community and many of the workers.\n\n47. In the early period of immigration, it was thought best to encourage employment of Beta Israel in the production rather than the service sector of the economy. In reality, this is not possible, at least at this stage.\n\n48. Although efforts are made to break the news during weekends or other holidays, it is not always possible to do so. Even if it is, the individual may stay away for more than a day or two, depending how closely he was related to the deceased. If a relative or friend dies in Israel, tradition requires that a large number of community members must attend, and the close relatives sit in ritual at home for about seven days. This latter custom is also observed in Israeli Jewish tradition.\n\n49. One of the criticisms leveled against the olim by the veterans is that they spend too much money on televisions and furniture, which the veterans claim are unnecessary.\n\n50. Among the male workers, it is possible that Gondar pride enters the picture. The Gondarese are known to take pride in asserting their independence. In Israel, where they are told what to do and how to do it and are required to report their comings and goings to a ferenj (Amharic for a white or strange person) supervisor, they may feel affronted. This is my interpretation based on knowledge of how the Gondarese male ego operates. At any rate, the smallholder in Ethiopia is self-directed and self-regulated and may find working in a bureaucratic situation a nuisance at best, unacceptable at worst.\n\n51. This is not unlike what is happening among the black minorities in the United States, African-American females are obtaining more higher education, better employment, and higher wages. At least in the short term, this trend tends to disrupt family relations.\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\n1. The Chicago-based American Association for Ethiopian Jews continued its effective work: raising the necessary funds, recruiting some facilitators within Ethiopia (both government officials and private individuals), and pressuring the Israeli and U.S. governments to maintain diplomatic pressure on Mengistu through the United Nations and its member governments.\n\n2. Rachmim Elazar was brought to Israel in 1972 when he was a very young boy. Since then, he has graduated from Tel Aviv University and become very fluent in Hebrew as well as his native language, Amharic. He is one of the few Beta Israel who are very well acculturated to Israeli society. For some time, he was in charge of the Amharic radio program produced for the new immigrants.\n\n3. This set the tone for subsequent State Department actions. For instance, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, pressed the Mengistu government at every opportunity to release the Beta Israel if it wanted improved relations with Washington. It must be recalled that George Bush had been very active during 1984 and 1985 in persuading the Sudanese leader to permit, even to facilitate, the exodus of the Ethiopian Jews to Israel.\n\n4. The American Association for Ethiopian Jews, which has been active on behalf of the Beta Israel for a long time, often has been accused of ignoring the physical safety and political considerations associated with its work. But it has continued its activities in Israel, the United States, and Ethiopia. It asserts, with a measure of justified pride, that without its lobbying of Congress, the administration, and other private organizations and its fund-raising efforts, the migration outcome would have been very limited at best. For example, the association’s newsletter, Release: A Report from AAEJ, vol. 9, no. 1, lists many successful activities. While some of this information may be self-serving, most of the achievements on the list are true. For an updated list of the AAEJ’s achievements and the tasks remaining, see a letter sent to the membership of the association from its president, Nate Shapiro, dated December 1990. For the meeting at the White House, see Joel Rebibo, “A Long Way from Gondar,” Moment, 4, 5: 44–45.\n\n5. “Ethiopians Exploited,” Michigan Daily, vol. 1C, no. 80.\n\n6. Mesfin Woldemariam, “An Ethiopian Peace Initiative,” presented at the Xlth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, April 1–6, 1991, Addis Ababa.\n\n7. There were about seventeen thousand immigrants by 1987. With an increase of approximately five hundred per year over four years, the total reached the vicinity of twenty thousand.\n\n8. I have not been able to verify this, but I have in my files numerous letters, obtained in the field in Israel, in which Beta Israel complain about their situation in graphic detail. See also the description of a prominent, controversial leader, Addisu Messele, in Rebibo.\n\n9. The reader must keep in mind that there has never been an accurate census of the Beta Israel.\n\n10. In April 1987, I witnessed a march by a large number of Beta Israel to the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem. The marchers, men and women, young and old, carrying placards with signs saying “Let my people come,” shouted repeatedly for reunion with mothers, children, and other relatives in Ethiopia. Such demonstrations occurred frequently. See Elizabeth Brown, “Waiting in Gondar,” Reform Judaism (Winter 1989): 6–7.\n\n11. I heard about the resumption of diplomatic relations when I was in Philadelphia on a research fellowship. There were Israeli professors there as well, so the Israeli consulate transmitted a series of messages from Israel. On November 6, 1989, Giddeon Allon reported in Ha’aretz that a special delegation from Ethiopia, led by Kassa Kebede, the Israeli-educated uncle of Mengistu Hailemariam, had been received by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and the defense minister, Moshe Arens. According to Allon’s report, Shamir expressed appreciation for Ethiopia’s desire to establish formal relations, noting that the two countries had been friends for a long time, and a resumption of formal relations was proper and timely. This meeting was held just as the Ethiopian president declared a national mobilization to resist rebel forces marching toward the capital from the north. The implication surrounding the hasty reestablishment of relations was that Ethiopia was desperately hoping Israel would serve as a significant asset by providing military hardware and advice, and that it would urge the U.S. administration to agree to an exchange of ambassadors between Washington and Addis Ababa.\n\n12. Indeed, on January 17, 1990, Prime Minister Shamir stated that as soon as the Israeli embassy was organized in Addis Ababa, all the fifteen thousand (sic) would emigrate to “their country.” See Almishmar, January 17, 1990.\n\n13. The Ethiopian public was told repeatedly by the government-controlled media that the Beta Israel had been abducted by the Israeli government and that given a chance they would like to return to Ethiopia. As far as the general Ethiopian public was concerned, the thought that groups of Ethiopians were leaving the country because they found life unbearable was another, perhaps most disgusting, manifestation of the government they were living under. Even the intellectuals who were aware of the government propaganda to the contrary objected to the way in which the Beta Israel were leaving the country. See Woldemariam, “An Ethiopian Peace Initiative.”\n\n14. See Mary A. Fitzgerald, “How Ethiopian Rebels Turned Struggle Around,” San Francisco Chronicle, July 4, 1990; “Ethiopia Mulls Exodus of Black Jews,” Washington Times, June 12, 1990.\n\n15. Ibid.\n\n16.

For a detailed account, see Flora Lewis, “Ethiopia Peers West,” New York Times, January 30, 1990; “Friends Like Us,” Economist, January 27, 1990, p. 39.\n\n19. The whole operation of bringing the Beta Israel from Gondar and placing them in Addis Ababa for proper certification and exit purposes was done in an extralegal manner. See the very useful article by Jane Perlez, “Strain on Ethiopian City: Stranded Jews,” New York Times, July 14, 1990, p. 3.\n\n20. Ibid.\n\n21. Ibid. Kassa Kebede, one of the most prominent government officials (and Mengistu Hailemariam’s uncle) during the reign of Haile Selassie, served as the main link between Mengistu and the Israeli authorities. He traveled to Israel to reestablish diplomatic relations and later bypassed the government’s normal channels to transport the Beta Israel to Addis Ababa. He was later rewarded, just in the nick of time. He and two other officials were taken to Israel during Operation Solomon. For the circumstances of their fight, see Joel Brinkley, “Two Ethiopian Officials Given Asylum by Israelis,” New York Times, May 30, 1991, p. 7.\n\n22. Most of this information was obtained through private communication with Ethiopians and Americans who worked directly with emigrants in Addis Ababa. Also, information was obtained from some of the volunteer organizations at headquarters in Washington or Chicago and from their regular publications. I am grateful for the information provided by Gary Miller of the Jewish Distribution Committee of America, who visited the Beta Israel between January and February 1991. His untitled report, which he kindly made available, was very extensive and informative. . .\n\n23. Rebibo, “A Long Way from Gondar,” p. 42.\n\n24. Larry Derfner, “Forgotten Immigrants,” Jerusalem Post international edition, March 31, 1990, p. 10.\n\n25. Yaiel “Jack” Edelstein, who returned to the United Stated after spending a few months in Israel, communicated this to me on May 5, 1991, in Ann Arbor, Mich. For a brief but otherwise excellent account of the issue, see Rebibo, “A Long Way from Gondar,” pp. 42–55.\n\n26. See Derfner, “Forgotten Immigrants.”\n\n27. But the Israeli government should have known that whoever might assume power in Addis Ababa would wish to establish and maintain good relations with the United States and the Bush administration would sooner or later use its good offices to influence the Addis Ababa regime.\n\n28. This news was a surprise in that many people assumed that Mengistu would commit suicide rather than flee. See Clifford Krauss, “Ethiopia’s Dictator Flees; Officials Seeking U.S. Help,” New York Times, May 22, 1991.\n\n29. I was in direct telephone contact with Addis Ababa during Operation Solomon. One excellent source of information was a nurse in the Addis Ababa refugee camps. See Clifford Krauss, “Israel Begins Airlift of Ethiopia’s Jews,” New York Times, May 25, 1991; also, in the same issue by the same reporter, “Eritrea’s Capital Reported Seized.” See also Clifford Krauss, “Ethiopian Jews and Israelis Exult as Airlift Is Completed,” New York Times, May 26, 1991.\n\n30. This issue also was raised by the United States and Egypt during the 1985 exodus of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. Although very mindful of this, some families eventually settled in at least one occupied area, Kiryat Arba, near the historic city of Hebron."
