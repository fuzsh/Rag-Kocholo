        "text": "Anti-semitic propaganda was a marginal phenomenon in the Arab world for a long time, but unfortunately it has been gaining strength in several countries over the past three years. This worrying development is linked with the worsening situation in Palestine.\n\nThe failure of the Camp David summit in July 2000, the outbreak of the second intifada, and escalating repression by the Israeli army strongly affected public opinion in the Arab countries. Ultra-nationalist and religious movements are spreading the poison of anti-semitism on this fertile ground, with the connivance of the authorities.\n\nIn 2002 an Egyptian television series, The Horseless Rider, caused a stir; in it a virtual horseman slays the Zionist dragon and denounces a “Jewish conspiracy against Palestine” inspired by the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. That old Tsarist forgery just won’t die.\n\nIn November 2003 Robert Fisk, whose commitment to the Palestinian cause is well-known, wrote in The Independent (1) about his disgust at finding a new edition of the Protocols in a Beirut bookshop: “I’m always careful about accusing Arabs of antisemitism. They are themselves a Semitic race . . . But how come this vicious little tract can turn up in a sophisticated country such as Lebanon? Just take the beating of breasts still reverberating over the decision by Hizbullah television to show a series during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan called Al-Shatat (the Diaspora), which purports to be a history of Zionism 1812-1948. It refers to a Jewish plot to take over the world.” The series featured a pseudo-ritual murder.\n\nLast November the old forgery re-appeared in Tunis, where a weekly news- paper claimed the recent World Zionist Congress proved that the Protocols had “lost none of their freshness and relevance. Not a wrinkle. Not a trace of rust” (2). Earlier in 2003 the Saudi newspaper Al-Watan had ridiculously reported that “Israeli rabbis recently issued a fatwa (sic) stating that Iraq is part of Greater Israel” (3).\n\nIn Morocco incitement to hatred of Jews, denounced by the Tangiers weekly Le Journal, was accompanied by physical attacks; people were killed. Nine people received long prison sentences in 2003 for the murder of Albert Rebibo, a Casablanca Jew (4). Not only the courts reacted. In Morocco a petition was launched against attacks on Jews, which are alien to the country’s traditions. Arab intellectuals organised protests elsewhere.\n\nAn appeal against a Holocaust-denial conference being held in Beirut in 2001 was published in Le Monde (5). The Palestinian American writer Edward Said commented in Le Monde diplomatique: “The notion that the Jews never suffered and that the Holocaust is an obfuscatory confection created by the Elders of Zion is one that is acquiring too much, far too much currency. Why do we expect the world to believe our sufferings as Arabs if (a) we cannot recognise the sufferings of others, even of our oppressors, and (b) we cannot deal with facts that trouble simplistic ideas of the sort propagated by bien pensants intellectuals who refuse to see the relationship between the Holocaust and Israel . . . by recognising the Holocaust for the genocidal madness that it was, we can then demand from Israelis and Jews the right to link the Holocaust to Zionist injustices towards the Palestinians” (6).\n\nHis courage stimulated others. The Egyptian Horseless Rider series was heavily criticised by journalists, associations and distinguished people; the television channel that showed it was forced to change the presentation of the series and challenge the veracity of the Protocols.\n\nOsama al-Baz, for a long time adviser to President Hosni Mubarak, published significant articles in Al Ahram (7) in which he restored the historical truth about the Protocols, the Nazi genocide and the nature of the struggle in the Middle East: “Each of us must understand that to attack Jews as a race or people - and so advocate an inhuman, racist approach - is to damage the cause of the nation . . . Those who criticise Israel have no need of anti-semitism to denounce its policies.”\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, many were allowed to settle in the Arab world. It offered them, and Christians, the status of dhimmi, which, though inferior to that of Muslims, was much more favourable than the treatment they would have received in Europe at that time. It saved them from the recurrent persecutions suffered by European Jews. ( Auschwitz is hardly an Arabic name.)\n\nWith the exception of Iraq, where there was a kind of pogrom in 1941 under the regime of Ali Rashid, there was no violence and no mass attacks against Jewish commu nities until after the second world war and the birth of Israel (which was not accompanied by that of the Palestinian state envisaged in the United Nations partition plan). Similar anti-Jewish violence happened when the peoples of the Maghreb achieved independence.\n\nThe current anti-semitic propaganda is retrogressive for the Arab world and will do it untold harm."
