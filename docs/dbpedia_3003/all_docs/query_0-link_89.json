Our partnership – a community of home, school and synagogue working together- ensures that\n\neach child receives the best possible preschool experience. This partnership is based on the mutual respect of all partners and supports each child as\n\nhe or she grows emotionally, socially, cognitively and physically. Because of this, each child is confident to learn about his or her world through play,\n\nexperimentation and creativity in his or her own way and time. And, of course, a big dose of love never hurts!\n\nSherry Smith, Director, Foundation School\n\nTHIRD ANNUAL WEAR A PYJAMA/GIVE A PYJAMA FUNDRAISER\n\nBENEFITTING AUBERGE SHALOM\n\nSuDnanyyCDaamyps 2TO4YEARSOLD\n\nDAILY CAMP PROGRAM\n\n• Low camper-to-staff ratio • Theme days JUNE 18 - AUGUST 10\n\n• Sports • Guest animators 9:00 AM - 1:30 PM\n\n• Outdoor water play • Shabbat\n\n• Art, music and science • Weekly pizza lunch\n\nREGISTER TODAY [email protected] 514.937.9475 shaarhashomayim/sunnydays\n\n18 | www.shaarhashomayim.org\n\nSHAAR B'NEI MITZVAH\n\nSADIE JACOBSON, daughter of Ronit Amsel and Dr. Avi Jacobson, will celebrate her Bat Mitzvah on March 1, 2018,\n\nreading the Megillat Esther.
