See About archive blog posts.\n\nWoodland Hills El Camino Real has lost the architect of its turnaround in boys’ basketball.\n\nDavid Rebibo, who guided the Conquistadores to their first City Section Division II championship two seasons ago and to a runner-up Division I spot this past season, has resigned after six years as coach to become an assistant at San Francisco.\n\nJV Coach Joe Wyatt will take over as head coach.\n\n‘It was a great opportunity for me,’ Rebibo said. ‘It was a dream I couldn’t pass up.’\n\nEl Camino Real was considered one of the favorites for next season’s Division I title with the return of standouts Julian Richardson, Evan Wardlow and Maleke Haynes, all of whom have college scholarship offers.\n\nWyatt is a former Granada Hills Kennedy player who played in college and overseas.\n\n-- Eric Sondheimer"
