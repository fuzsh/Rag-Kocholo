        "text": "Switching to lopinavir/ritonavir with or without abacavir/lamivudine in lipoatrophic patients treated with zidovudine/abacavir/lamivudine.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernardino, J I; Pulido, F; Martinez, E; Arrizabalaga, J; Domingo, P; Portilla, J; Ocampo, A; MuÃ±oz, J; Torres, R; Arribas, J R\n\n2013-06-01\n\nDiscontinuation of thymidine nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tNRTIs) is the only proven strategy for improving lipoatrophy. It is unclear whether switching to NRTI-sparing or to non-thymidine NRTI-containing therapy has differential effects on body fat recovery. This was a 96 week, open-label, randomized study in suppressed patients with moderate/severe lipoatrophy and no prior virological failure while receiving a protease inhibitor and who had their triple NRTI regimen (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir) switched to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine for a 1 month run-in period and then randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine versus lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. The KRETA trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00865007). Of 95 patients included, 88 were randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine (nâ=â44) or lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy (nâ=â44). Median (IQR) baseline limb fat was 2.5 (1.6-3.7) kg in the lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine group and 2.5 (2.0-5.4) kg in the lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy group. Six patients in the triple therapy group and 13 in the monotherapy group had discontinued study drugs by week 96. Although there were limb fat gains in each group at weeks 48/96 (+324/+358 g in lopinavir/ritonavir plus abacavir/lamivudine, Pâ=â0.09/0.07, versus +215/+416 g in the lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy group, Pâ=â0.28/0.16), differences between groups were not significant [difference +109 g (95% CI -442, +660)/-57 g (95% CI -740, +625)]. In lipoatrophic patients treated with zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir, switching to lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy had no additional benefit in limb fat recovery relative to switching to lopinavir/ritonavir with abacavir/lamivudine. These data suggest that non-thymidine nucleosides such as abacavir/lamivudine are not an obstacle to limb fat recovery.\n\nLamivudine\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... older.

All patients on lamivudine (biovudinÂ®) therapy at a dose of 100 mg/day, who showed seroclearnace between March 2001 and September 2011 were recruited. The main evaluation parameters were duration of HBsAg seroclearance and duration of HBsAg seroconversion. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were evaluated using standard methods. HBsAg seroclearance was defined as two consecutive negative serums HBsAg at least 6 months apart, whereas HBsAg seroconversion was defined as the disappearance of serum HBsAg and the presence of anti-HBs for >6 months. A total of 203 chronic HBV patients treated with lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg/day were included in the study. HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion were observed in 11 patients after the initiation of the lamivudine therapy. Overall, in lamivudine responder patients, the mean time to HBsAg seroclearance was 26.90Â±10.93 months (range: 12-48 months). Furthermore, the responders showed seroconversion after a mean time of 26.90Â±11.08 months from the initiation of lamivudine therapy. When comparing the characteristics of those who have responded to lamivudine and those who have not responded, baseline HBV-DNA levels was significantly lower in responder than non responder patients (p<0.001). Meantime, there was no difference in age, sex, baseline ALT, AST and liver biopsy score between lamivudine responder and lamivudine non-responder patients. Despite introduction of tenofovir and entecavir as first line treatment for chronic HBV infection, lamivudine remains to be a low cost, safe and effective drug for HBsAg seroclearnace.\n\nShort-term overlap lamivudine treatment with adefovir dipivoxil in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNam, Soon Woo; Bae, Si Hyun; Lee, Seung Woo; Kim, Yeon Soo; Kang, Sang Bum; Choi, Jong Young; Cho, Se Hyun; Yoon, Seung Kew; Han, Joon-Yeol; Yang, Jin Mo; Lee, Young Suk\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAIM: To evaluate the efficacy of short-term overlap lamivudine therapy with adefovir in patients with lamivudine-resistant and naÃ¯ve chronic hepatitis B, we compared patients receiving overlap therapy with those receiving adefovir alone. METHODS: Eighty patients who had received lamivudine treatment for various periods and had a lamivudine-resistant liver function abnormality were enrolled. Forty of these patients received adefovir treatment combined with lamivudine treatment for â¥ 2 mo, while the other 40 received adefovir alone. We assessed the levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA at 0, 12 and 48 wk and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels after 0, 12, 24 and 48 wk of adefovir treatment in each group. RESULTS: We found serum ALT became normalized in 72 (87.5%) of the 80 patients, and HBV DNA decreased by â¥ 2 log10 copies/mL in 60 (75%) of the 80 patients at the end of a 48-wk treatment. HBV DNA levels were not significantly different between the groups. The improvements in serum ALT were also not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest short-term overlap lamivudine treatment results in no better virological and biological outcomes than non-overlap adefovir monotherapy.

Methods This study enrolled 73 antiviral-naÃ¯ve patients who received 0.5-mg ETV as an initial therapy and 54 patients who received ADV add-on LAM combination treatment as a rescue therapy from July 2006 to July 2010. Results During 24-month treatments, the decreases in serum log10HBV-DNA values (copies/mL) were significantly greater in the antiviral-naÃ¯ve patients treated with ETV than the patients receiving ADV add-on LAM combination treatment. The biochemical response rates for alanine aminotransferase normalization at 6 months (ETV) and 12 months (ADV add-on LAM) were 90.4% (66/73) and 77.8% (42/54), respectively (P=0.048). A Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the rates of serologic response, viral breakthrough, and emergence of genotypic resistance did not differ significantly between the two patient groups. There were also no significant intergroup differences in the rates of disease progression (PD) and new development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conclusion The long-term clinical outcomes of antiviral-naÃ¯ve patients treated with ETV and LAM-resistant patients receiving ADV add-on LAM combination treatment were comparable in terms of the emergence of HCC and disease progression.

According to the report, 13 out of 15 patients treated with lamivudine survived and were declared free from Ebola virus disease. In this study, the anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) activity of lamivudine and another antiretroviral, zidovudine, were evaluated in a diverse set of cell lines against two variants of wild-type EBOV. Variable assay parameters were assessed to include different multiplicities of infection, lengths of inoculation times, and durations of dosing. At a multiplicity of infection of 1, lamivudine and zidovudine had no effect on EBOV propagation in Vero E6, Hep G2, or HeLa cells, or in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. At a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, zidovudine demonstrated limited anti-EBOV activity in Huh 7 cells. Under certain conditions, lamivudine had low anti-EBOV activity at the maximum concentration tested (320 Î¼M). However, lamivudine never achieved greater than 30% viral inhibition, and the activity was not consistently reproducible. Combination of lamivudine and zidovudine showed no synergistic antiviral activity. Independently, a set of in vitro experiments testing lamivudine and zidovudine for antiviral activity against an Ebola-enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter virus was performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No antiviral activity was observed for either compound. A study evaluating the efficacy of lamivudine in a guinea pig model of EVD found no survival benefit. This lack of benefit was observed despite plasma lamivudine concentrations in guinea pig of about 4 Î¼g/ml obtained in a separately conducted pharmacokinetics study. These studies found no evidence to support the therapeutic use of lamivudine for the treatment of EVD.\n\nDolutegravir-lamivudine as initial therapy in HIV-1 infected, ARV-naive patients, 48-week results of the PADDLE (Pilot Antiretroviral Design with Dolutegravir LamivudinE) study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCahn, Pedro; RolÃ³n, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Figueroa, MarÃ­a InÃ©s; Gun, Ana; Patterson, Patricia; Sued, Omar\n\n2017-05-09\n\nA proof-of-concept study was designed to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of a two-drug regimen with dolutegravir 50Â mg once daily (QD) plus lamivudine 300Â mg once daily as initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients. PADDLE is a pilot study including 20 treatment-naive adults. To be selected, participants had no IAS-USA-defined resistance, HIV-1 RNA â¤100,000 copies/mL at screening and negative HBsAg. Plasma viral load (pVL) was measured at baseline; days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28; weeks 6, 8 and 12; and thereafter every 12Â weeks up to 96Â weeks. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL in an intention to treat (ITT)-exposed analysis at 48Â weeks (the FDA snapshot algorithm). Median HIV-1 RNA at entry was 24,128 copies/mL (interquartile range (IQR): 11,686-36,794). Albeit as per protocol, all patients had pVL â¤100,000 copies/mL at screening as required by inclusion criteria, four patients had â¥100,000 copies/mL at baseline. Median baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 507 per cubic millimetre (IQR: 296-517). A rapid decline in pVL was observed (median VL decay from baseline to week 12 was 2.74 logs). All patients were suppressed at week 8 onwards up to week 24. At week 48, 90% (18/20) reached the primary endpoint of a pVL <50 copies/mL. Median change in CD4 cell count between baseline and week 48 was 267 cells/mm 3 (IQR: 180-462). No major tolerability/toxicity issues were observed. Nineteen patients completed 48Â weeks of the study, and one patient (with undetectable VL at last visit) committed suicide. One patient presented a low-level protocol-defined confirmed virological failure at week 36, being the only observed failure. This patient had pVL <50 copies/mL at the end-of-study visit without having changed the two-drug regimen. Observed failure rate was 5%.

The liver disease patients were divided into two groups, the treated group (n=64) was given Lamivudine 100 mg once a day for one year and was additionally given liver protection drugs according to their liver function, while the control group (n=30) was given common liver protection drugs. The blood routine test, liver function and the viral markers were detected at defined times. The results showed that after one year treatment of chronic hepatitis B with Lamivudine, the recovery rate of ALT was 90.7%, the negative conversion rate of HBV DNA was 73.1% showing a significant difference as compared with the control group (P<0.05). The negative seroconversion rate of HBeAg was 50%, HBeAg/anti HBe changing rate was 38.2%, that had no significant different as compared with the control group (P<0.05). The percentage for disease relapse and second elevation of ALT was 3.1% in therapeutic group that was significantly different from that of the control group (P<0.05). Two cases with severe hepatitis in the treated group were all alive. Lamivudine could effectively control HBV DNA replication, making ALT normal, it also could decrease the relapse rate of chronic hepatitis B and raise the survival rate of the patients with liver disease.\n\nHepatitis B reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine in patients with haematological malignancy on completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHui, C-K; Cheung, W W W; Au, W-Y; Lie, A K W; Zhang, H-Y; Yueng, Y-H; Wong, B C Y; Leung, N; Kwong, Y-L; Liang, R; Lau, G K K\n\n2005-11-01\n\nThe hepatic outcome of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing chemotherapy after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine is unknown. To examine the occurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. Pre-emptive lamivudine was started one week before initiation of chemotherapy in 46 consecutive HBsAg positive patients and continued for the entire duration of chemotherapy. Pre-emptive lamivudine was stopped at a median 3.1 (range 3.0-3.4) months after completion of chemotherapy. Patients were longitudinally followed up after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. Median time of follow up after withdrawal of lamivudine was 25.7 (range 5.7-75.7) months. Eleven of the 46 patients (23.9%) developed HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. Eight of the 16 patients with high pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA (> or =10(4) copies/ml) compared with three of the 30 patients with low pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA (<10(4) copies/ml) developed HBV reactivation (50.0% v 10.0%, respectively; p<0.001). Hepatitis B e antigen positive patients were also more likely to develop HBV reactivation (5/11 (45.5%) v 6/35 (17.1%), respectively; p = 0.041). A high pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA (> or =10(4) copies/ml) was the most important risk factor for HBV reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine on Cox proportional hazards analysis (relative risk 16.13, (95% confidence interval 2.99-87.01; p = 0.001). HBV reactivation is more likely to occur in patients with high pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine. A more prolonged course of antiviral therapy may be necessary in these patients after completion of chemotherapy in order to reduce post-chemotherapy HBV reactivation.\n\nHepatitis B reactivation after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine in patients with haematological malignancy on completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHui, C-K; Cheung, W W W; Au, W-Y; Lie, A K W; Zhang, H-Y; Yueng, Y-H; Wong, B C Y; Leung, N; Kwong, Y-L; Liang, R; Lau, G K K\n\n2005-01-01\n\nBackground: The hepatic outcome of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients undergoing chemotherapy after withdrawal of pre-emptive lamivudine is unknown.

We compared the outcomes of patients from the SPIRAL trial receiving either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine at baseline who had taken at least one dose of either raltegravir or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors. For the purpose of this analysis, treatment failure was defined as virological failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA â¥50 copies/ml) or discontinuation of abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir/emtricitabine because of adverse events, consent withdrawal, or lost to follow-up. There were 143 (72.59%) patients with tenofovir/emtricitabine and 54 (27.41%) with abacavir/lamivudine. In the raltegravir group, there were three (11.11%) treatment failures with abacavir/lamivudine and eight (10.96%) with tenofovir/emtricitabine (estimated difference 0.15%; 95% CI -17.90 to 11.6). In the ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor group, there were four (14.81%) treatment failures with abacavir/lamivudine and 12 (17.14%) with tenofovir/emtricitabine (estimated difference -2.33%; 95% CI -16.10 to 16.70). Triglycerides decreased and HDL cholesterol increased through the study more pronouncedly with abacavir/lamivudine than with tenofovir/emtricitabine and differences in the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio between both combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) tended to be higher in the raltegravir group, although differences at 48 weeks were not significant. While no patient discontinued abacavir/lamivudine due to adverse events, four (2.80%) patients (all in the ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor group) discontinued tenofovir/emtricitabine because of adverse events (p=0.2744). The results of this analysis do not suggest that outcomes of abacavir/lamivudine are worse than those of tenofovir/emtricitabine when combined with raltegravir in virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults.\n\nThe Triple Combination Indinavir-Zidovudine-Lamivudine Is Highly Synergistic\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSnyder, Stuart; D'Argenio, D. Z.; Weislow, Owen; Bilello, John A.; Drusano, G. L.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nAdministration of the combination of indinavir-zidovudine-lamivudine has been demonstrated to cause a large fraction of treated patients to have a decline in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) copy number to below the detectability of sensitive assays. A recent investigation (G. L. Drusano, J. A. Bilello, D. S. Stein, M. Nessly, A. Meibohm, E. A. Emini, P. Deutsch, J. Condra, J. Chodakewitz, and D. J. Holder, J. Infect. Dis. 178:360â367, 1998) demonstrated that the durability of the antiviral effect was affected by combination chemotherapy. Zidovudine-lamivudine-indinavir differed significantly from the combination of zidovudine plus indinavir. We hypothesized that the addition of lamivudine might alter the regimen, producing a synergistic anti-HIV effect. In vitro analysis of drug interaction demonstrated that zidovudine-indinavir interacted additively. The addition of lamivudine in concentrations which suppressed viral replication by 20% or less by itself demonstrated marked increases in the synergy volume, increasing the synergy volume 20-fold with the addition of 320 nM lamivudine (which does not suppress HIV by itself) and 40-fold with the addition of 1,000 nM lamivudine (20% viral inhibition as a single agent). A fully parametric analysis with a newly developed model for three-drug interaction confirmed and extended these observations. The interaction term (Î±IND,AZT,3TC) for all three drugs showed the greatest degree of synergy. This marked synergistic interaction among the three agents may explain some of the clinical results which differentiate this regimen from the double-drug regimen of zidovudine plus indinavir.

However, the main problem with prolonged use of lamivudine is the development of viral resistance to the treatment. Mutations in the YMDD motif of the hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase gene have been associated with resistance to drug therapy. So far, there have not been many studies in Brazil reporting on genotype-dependent development of resistance to lamivudine. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the possible correlation between a certain genotype and increased development of resistance to lamivudine among chronic hepatitis B patients. HBV DNA in samples from 50 patients under lamivudine treatment was amplified by means of conventional PCR. Samples were collected at Hospital das ClÃ­nicas, FMRP-USP. The products were then sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 29 (58%) patients were infected with genotype D, 20 (40%) with genotype A and one (2%) with genotype F.

At admission, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were normal, but he tested positive for HBs antigen. The titer was 64-fold by radioimmunoassay. We initiated lamivudine at a daily dose of 75 mg to prevent HBV proliferation during chemotherapy. By September 2000, he had received six courses of rituximab at 375 mg/m(2) and four courses of fludarabine and mitoxantrone. No hepatic damage was observed from the initiation of treatment until March 2001. At present, four months after the completion of chemotherapy, he continues lamivudine, and the titer of HBs antigen is low at 4-fold. Rituximab is usually associated with mild toxicity, usually limited to infusion periods. The drug is not generally associated with increased incidence of opportunistic infections. However, some case reports have been recently published on severe viral infections following administration of rituximab. These include fluminant hepatitis caused by HBV, pure red cell aplasia due to parvovirus B19 and fatal varicella-zoster infection. While it remains unknown whether rituximab can be safely administered in patients with chronic HBV infection, this case report suggested that prophylactic administration of lamivudine is beneficial for suppressing reactivation of HBV during chemotherapy including rituximab. Rituximab should be used cautiously for patients with HBV infection, but prophylactic administration of lamivudine may be beneficial for preventing reactivation of HBV.

The use of prophylactic antiviral agents in cancer patients may result in a reduced HBV exacerbation. The purpose of the current study was to assess the efficacy of prophylactic lamivudine in reducing the incidence and severity of HBV reactivation in post-operative breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. The medical records of patients undergoing anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy at Samsung Medical Center between January 2001 and September 2008 were reviewed. From the database, 1912 breast cancer patients who had received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were identified. Of 131 patients who were HBV surface antigen positive, 55 and 76 did and did not receive prophylactic lamivudine, respectively. In all, 30 patients (23%) developed hepatitis during doxorubicin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. Of the 30 patients, 5 (9%) were in the prophylactic lamivudine group and 25 (33%) in the control group (P=0.001). In the prophylactic lamivudine group, there was significantly less HBV reactivation (1 patient (2%) vs 20 patients (16%); P=0.002), less disruption of chemotherapy (7 vs 14%; P=0.04), and less severe hepatitis (0 vs 17%; P=0.002). Prophylactic lamivudine significantly reduced the incidence and severity of HBV reactivation in breast cancer patients undergoing anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nAbacavir, Lamivudine, and Zidovudine\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired ... doctor.Abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it.

Developmental changes in lamivudine pharmacokinetic disposition were assessed by combining data from 7 studies of lamivudine (Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 300, 353, 356, 358, 386, 1056, and 1069) representing subjects across the pediatric age continuum. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to identify factors that influence lamivudine disposition. Age and Thai race were independent predictors of apparent clearance (CL/F), whereas the use of a fixed drug combination formulation (GPO-VIR) was an independent predictor of bioavailability, with CL/F more than doubling from birth to adolescence. Serum creatinine was not associated with CL/F. Monte Carlo simulations were used to compare the lamivudine exposure achieved with World Health Organization (WHO) weight band and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label dosing recommendations. WHO dosing yielded higher exposure during the first few months of life, but this difference was less pronounced between 6 months and 14 years of age. Overall, both FDA and WHO dosing provided similar AUC values to those previously reported in HIV-infected adults. Lamivudine WHO weight band dosing results in therapeutic exposure in infants and children and may improve drug dosing in resource-limited countries.

We aimed to investigate whether up to 10 years lamivudine treatment achieves liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression in AdLF-CHB patients. Improvement of hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, virological response and disease progression were evaluated in 28 AdLF-CHB patients with up to 10 years lamivudine treatment. Liver biopsy was performed in all of the 28 patients at baseline, but only 19 patients had second biopsy at year 10. There were 24 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and 4 HBeAg-negative patients within the original 28 AdLF-CHB patients. At the end of 10 years lamivudine treatment, 20 of the 24 HBeAg-positive patients had HBeAg loss. HBeAg seroconversion was detected in 10 of these 20 HBeAg loss patients. HBsAg loss was observed in 4 of the original 28 patients. Among these four HBsAg loss patients, three had HBsAg seroconversion. All patients achieved hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) undetectable. Histopathology was evaluated between paired original and final liver biopsies among 19 patients as follows: 4/19 achieved complete liver fibrosis/cirrhosis regression; 9/19 improved in Ishak fibrosis score; whereas 6/19 showed no fibrosis improvement. About 75% patients achieved inflammatory/fibrotic improvement. No significant disease progression was observed in 24/28 patients. Furthermore, no significant difference in histopathology improvement, cirrhosis regression, disease progression between non-resistance and rescue for resistance was observed. Long-term lamivudine therapy achieves regression of fibrosis/cirrhosis and improvement of histological and disease progression in AdLF-CHB patients.

There are about 400 million people affected worldwide with HBV, and over 300,000 die every year from HBV-related diseases. Oral antivirals like lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, and tenofovir are commonly used to treat chronic hepatitis B. In this study, we tried to evaluate the comparative efficacy of these drugs alone and in combination. Materials and Methods: Chronic hepatitis B patients with HBV-DNA more than 104 Copies/mL irrespective of their HBeAg status (n = 60) were enrolled in a prospective study. 21, 20, and 19 patients were treated with lamivudine (100 mg/day) plus adefovir (10 mg/day) combination entecavir monotherapy (0.5 mg/day) and tenofovir monotherapy (300 mg/day), respectively and were followed up for 24 weeks with their virological, serological, and biochemical markers measured at 12 and 24 weeks. Results: After 24 weeks of treatment, there was no significant difference between the 3 groups in suppressing HBV-DNA to undetectable levels. The median decrease in HBV-DNA levels from baseline was better with tenofovir and entecavir monotherapies than lamivudine and adefovir combination, which was statistically significant. There was no significant difference between the 3 groups in HBsAg and HBeAg seroconversion and normalization of biochemical parameters. Conclusion: Entecavir and tenofovir monotherapy were found to be more effective than lamivudine plus adefovir combination in reducing the HBV-DNA levels. However, lamivudine plus adefovir combination was not too inferior, especially when cost of treatment was taken into consideration.

METHODS: A total of 72 patients with chronic HBV infection were included in this study. All patients were confirmed to have the following conditions: above 16 years of age, elevated serum alanine amonotransferase (ALT), positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), positive HBV DNA in serum and PBMCs, negative antibodies against HAV, HCV, HDV, HEV. Other possible causes of chronic liver damages, such as drugs, alcohol and autoimmune diseases were excluded. Seventy-two cases were randomly divided into lamivudine treatment group (n = 42) and control group (n = 30). HBV DNA was detected both in serum and in PBMCs by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), during and after lamivudine treatment. RESULTS: In the treatment group, HBV DNA became negative both in serum and in PBMC, of 38 and 25 out of 42 cases respectively during the 48 wk of lamivudine treatment, the negative rate was 90.5% and 59.5% respectively. In the control group, the negative rate was 23.3% and 16.7% respectively. It was statistically significant at 12, 24 and 48 wk as compared with the control group (P < 0.005). The average conversion period of HBV DNA was 6 wk (2-8 wk) in serum and 16 wk (8-24 wk) in PBMC. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine has remarkable inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in serum and in PBMCs. The inhibitory effect on HBV DNA in PBMCs is weaker than that in serum.

The NRTIshave consistedof Zidovudine (AZT) or Stavudine (d4T) with Lamivudine (3TC); the NNRTI component hasbeen Nevirapine (NVP) or Efavirenz (EFV). There exists few data indicating if Vonavir is more effective in increasing CD4+ T cell counts or other first-line drugs of ART.Immunological outcomes of 134 individuals who just started antiretroviral therapy with Vonavir or Zidovudine/Lamivudine and Efavirenzanalyzed. Immunological response was then assessed during 28 weeks and indicated significant CD4+ T cell increase in both groups. The increase in CD4+ T cell counts was greater in Zidovudine/Lamivudine and Efavirenz treated group. A rapid CD4+ T cell increase occurred after the first 12 weeks of therapy in Vonavir treated group with initial CD4+ T cell counts â¤100 despite the individuals with higher CD4+ T cell counts. As previous studies, we observed the noticeable increase rate of CD4+ Tcells is in the first three months of therapy. A rapid CD4+ Tcell increase occurred shortly after beginning anti retroviraltherapy using either Vonaviror Zidovudine/Lamivudine and Efavirenz. Late increases in CD4+ T cell counts are more pronounced in therapy using Zidovudine/Lamivudine and Efavirenz.

Lamivudine is a relatively recent alternative to alpha interferon for the treatment of HBV infection, but unfortunately, resistance to lamivudine commonly develops during monotherapy. Lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants display specific mutations in the YMDD (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate) motif of the viral polymerase (reverse transcriptase [rt]), which is the catalytic site of the enzyme, i.e., methionine 204 to isoleucine (rtM204I) or valine (rtM204V). The latter mutation is often accompanied by a compensatory leucine-to-methionine change at codon 180 (rtL180M). In the present study, a novel sequencing method, pyrosequencing, was applied to the detection of lamivudine resistance mutations and was compared with direct Sanger sequencing. The new pyrosequencing method had advantages in terms of throughput. Experiments with mixtures of wild-type and resistant viruses indicated that pyrosequencing can detect minor sequence variants in heterogeneous virus populations. The new pyrosequencing method was evaluated with a small number of patient samples, and the results showed that the method could be a useful tool for the detection of lamivudine resistance in the clinical setting.\n\nPilot study of once-daily simplification therapy with abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine and efavirenz for treatment of HIV-1 infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuane, Peter; Lang, Joseph; DeJesus, Edwin; Berger, Daniel S; Dretler, Robin; Rodriguez, Allan; Ward, Douglas J; Lim, Michael L; Liao, Qiming; Reddy, Sunila; Clair, Marty St; Vila, Tania; Shaefer, Mark S\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this pilot study was to explore the efficacy and safety of the abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine fixed-dose combination tablet administered as two tablets once daily (qd) versus one tablet twice daily (bid) in combination with efavirenz (EFV). This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study with a 24-week treatment period in 7 outpatient HIV clinics in the United States. Patients currently receiving an initial regimen of abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine bid plus EFV qd for at least 6 months with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 3 months and a screening CD4+ cell count > or = 200 cells/mm3 were eligible. Thirty-six patients enrolled, and 35 (97%) completed the study. Participants were randomized to switch to 2 tablets of abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine qd plus EFV qd (QD arm) or continue current treatment (BID arm) for 24 weeks. Efficacy, safety, and adherence were evaluated. Median baseline CD4+ cell count was 521 cells/mm3. At week 24, HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL was achieved for 94% of participants in the QD arm and 89% in the BID arm by intent-to-treat, missing = failure analysis (95% confidence interval for difference: > or = 0.29 to +0.18, p = 1.000). At week 24, median CD4+ cell count change from baseline was +26 cells/mm3 for the QD arm and -39 cells/mm3 for BID arm. One patient randomized to the QD arm met virologic failure criteria (confirmed HIV-1 RNA >120 copies/mL) at week 20 and viral genotype showed M184V. After failure, this patient revealed he never took EFV throughout the entire study after randomization, effectively receiving only abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine qd alone. Median adherence was slightly higher in the QD arm, although both arms had broad variability and overlapping interquartile ranges. Adverse events were infrequent and occurred with similar frequency between arms; treatment-related adverse events were abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, headache, and abnormal dreams (1 patient [3%] for each adverse event\n\nEconomic analysis between entecavir and lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Kenneth K C; Wu, David Bin Chia; Chow, Pui Yu; Lee, Vivian Wing Yan; Li, Hong\n\n2012-07-01\n\nTremendous healthcare resources have been spent on the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and its related complications. Therefore, a proper evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy is vital in aid of decision-making. The aim of the present study was to examine the long-term economic and clinical influence if lamivudine was replaced by entecavir in a group of CHB patients. A recently published decision analytic model was adapted to study the cost-effectiveness of 2 years of treatment of entecavir in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative CHB patients from a public hospital perspective. Compensated cirrhosis (CC) and de-compensated cirrhosis (DC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events were projected to 10 years. Hong Kong-specific health care costs were used. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility values obtained from a local study. In the base case analysis, compared with lamivudine, the use of entecavir was expected to reduce the incidences of CC, DC and HCC by 41.8%, 57.1% and 49.3%, respectively, and lead to a saving of $US 1.17 million in medical cost. The overall disease management cost for entecavir, which was 67.7% higher than lamivudine for 2 years treatment was reduced to 17.2% after projecting 2-year treatment duration to 10 years. The incremental cost per QALY gained for entecavir compared with lamivudine was $US 13 759. Based on the recommended cost-effectiveness threshold of the World Health Organization, entecavir is considered cost-effective compared with lamivudine in treating CHB in Hong Kong when long term medical consequences were considered.

METHODS: In this retrospective, multi-center trial, 318 Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis B received 100 mg of lamivudine daily for up to 36 (median 21) mo. Virological response was a decline to a serum HBV DNA level less than 3.7â log copies/mL. Virological breakthrough was defined as the reappearance of a serum HBV DNA level to more than 10-fold the minimum during treatment. RESULTS: Lamivudine produced virological response in 86.8% of the 318 patients at 6 mo, in 80.2% of 252 patients at 12 mo, in 69.2% of 133 patients at 24 mo, and in 53.6% of 28 patients at 36 mo. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis showed an HBV DNA level less than 6.8â log copies/mL (Pâ <â 0.0001), HBeAg negativity (Pâ <â 0.0001), a platelet count of 100â Ãâ 109/L or more (Pâ =â 0.0162) at baseline, and a decline of the HBV DNA level of more than 3.2â log copies/mL as compared with the baseline level at 3 mo after the start of treatment (Pâ =â 0.0003) to be significantly associated with virological response. Among patients with a virological response, virological breakthrough was seen in 5.3% of 19 patients who responded virologically at 1 mo, in 20.7% of 203 patients at 3 mo, in 27.5% of 51 patients at 6 mo, in 33.3% of 12 patients at 9 mo, and in 100% of 3 patients at â¥15 mo. A virological breakthrough was found significantly more often in patients with delayed virological response. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine treatment could suppress serum HBV DNA in most of the tested Japanese patients. Long-term efficacy might be seen in patients without HBeAg at baseline, in the absence of cirrhosis, and in patients with a decline in HBV DNA level soon after the start of treatment.

The importance of this problem and the efficacy of lamivudine treatment has not been defined in areas with a high prevalence of positivity to antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (Anti-HBc). To define the characteristics and the clinical impact of de novo HBV infection in OLT recipients and to evaluate the efficacy of lamivudine treatment in this context, 229 HBsAg (-) donors (145 men, 84 women) were retrospectively evaluated between June 1994 and June 2000. Forty-eight recipients were excluded for various reasons. The final study population included 181 patients that were prospectively followed up for more than 6 months after OLT. When de novo HBV infection was detected, liver allograft biopsy was performed and treatment with lamivudine was indicated if patients were HBV-DNA-positive with elevated ALT levels. Survival time was defined as the interval between diagnosis of HBV infection and death or last follow-up visit. Thirty-one of 229 liver donors (13.5%) were anti-HBc(+). After a mean follow-up of 54.4+/-30 months, 9 of the 181 recipients (5%) developed de novo HBV infection; 8 of 27 recipients (29.6%) of livers from anti-HBc(+) donors as compared with only one of 154 recipients (0.6%) of livers from anti-HBc(-) donors P < 0.005). Liver biopsies performed in 8 of 9 cases showed chronic active hepatitis in 7 patients and acute hepatitis in one patient who cleared HBV spontaneously during the first 3 months. Seven patients were treated with lamivudine for a mean period of 24.5 months; HBV-DNA became negative in 5 of 7 (71.4%), and HBeAg became undetectable in 3 of 6 patients (50%).

Jan; Daar, Eric S.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND The use of fixed-dose combination nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor is recommended as initial therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but which NRTI combination has greater efficacy and safety is not known. METHODS In a randomized, blinded equivalence study involving 1858 eligible patients, we compared four once-daily anti retroviral regimens as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection: abacavirâlamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)âemtricitabine plus efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The primary efficacy end point was the time from randomization to virologic failure (defined as a confirmed HIV-1 RNA level â¥1000 copies per milliliter at or after 16 weeks and before 24 weeks, or â¥200 copies per milliliter at or after 24 weeks). RESULTS A scheduled interim review by an independent data and safety monitoring board showed significant differences in virologic efficacy, according to the NRTI combination, among patients with screening HIV-1 RNA levels of 100,000 copies per milliliter or more. At a median follow-up of 60 weeks, among the 797 patients with screening HIV-1 RNA levels of 100,000 copies per milliliter or more, the time to virologic failure was significantly shorter in the abacavirâlamivudine group than in the tenofovir DFâemtricitabine group (hazard ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 3.72; P<0.001), with 57 virologic failures (14%) in the abacavirâlamivudine group versus 26 (7%) in the tenofovir DFâemtricitabine group.

Attempts to achieve seroconversion in patients who have previously failed alpha-interferon have proved disappointing. Combination chemotherapy (alpha-interferon with a nucleoside analogue) might provide a treatment alternative for these patients. We have undertaken a phase 2 study in 20 patients who had previously failed at least one course of alpha-interferon. The study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination. All patients were treated for 16 weeks with alpha-interferon in combination with 12 or 16 weeks of Lamivudine (3'TC). Patients were followed for 16 weeks post-treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to identify/exclude significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction. The combination was well tolerated, and side-effects of the combination were indistinguishable from the recognised side-effects of alpha-interferon. Pharmacokinetic studies performed on days 1 and 29 did not show any significant interaction. All patients achieved HBV DNA clearance during treatment, but 19 relapsed at the end of treatment. HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion was observed for four patients, but was sustained for a single patient (who also had sustained DNA clearance). Combination therapy with alpha-interferon and lamivudine given for 16 weeks appears safe and is well tolerated. However, for this group of patients who had previously failed interferon monotherapy, the efficacy of combination interferon/lamivudine therapy appears disappointing, and other treatment strategies should be investigated.\n\nApplication of PCR-LDR-nucleic acid detection strip in detection of YMDD mutation in hepatitis B patients treated with lamivudine.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Gaolian; You, Qimin; Pickerill, Sam; Zhong, Huayan; Wang, Hongying; Shi, Jian; Luo, Ying; You, Paul; Kong, Huimin; Lu, Fengmin; Hu, Lin\n\n2010-07-01\n\nChronic hepatitis B virus (CHBV) infection causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lamivudine (LAM) has been successfully used to treat CHBV infections but prolonged use leads to the emergence of drug-resistant variants. This is primarily linked to a mutation in the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the HBV polymerase gene at position 204. Rapid diagnosis of drug-resistant HBV is necessary for a prompt treatment response. Common diagnostic methods such as sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis lack sensitivity and require significant processing. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of a novel diagnostic method that combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase detection reaction (LDR) and a nucleic acid detection strip (NADS) in detecting site-specific mutations related to HBV LAM resistance. We compared this method (PLNA) to direct sequencing and RFLP analysis in 50 clinical samples from HBV infected patients. There was 90% concordance between all three results. PLNA detected more samples containing mutant variants than both sequencing and RFLP analysis and was more sensitive in detecting mixed variant populations. Plasmid standards indicated that the sensitivity of PLNA is at or below 3,000 copies per ml and that it can detect a minor variant at 5% of the total viral population. This warrants its further development and suggests that the PLNA method could be a useful tool in detecting LAM resistance.

In this randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we recruited patients from 32 HIV units in hospitals in Spain and France. Eligible patients were HIV-infected adults (aged â¥18 years) with HIV-1 RNA of less than 50 copies per mL, for at least 6 months on triple treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir (twice daily) plus lamivudine or emtricitabine and a second nucleos(t)ide, with no resistance or virological failure to these drugs, and no positive hepatitis B serum surface antigen. Investigators at each centre randomly assigned patients (1:1; block size of four; stratified by time to suppression [<1 year or >1 year] and nadir CD4 cell count [<100 cells per Î¼L or >100 cells per Î¼L]; computer-generated random sequence) to continue triple treatment or switch to dual treatment (oral lopinavir 400 mg and oral ritonavir 100 mg twice daily plus oral lamivudine 300 mg once daily). The primary endpoint was response to treatment in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients) at 48 weeks. The non-inferiority margin was 12%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01471821. Between Oct 1, 2011, and April 1, 2013, we randomly assigned 250 participants to continue triple treatment (127 [51%] patients) or switch to dual treatment (123 [49%] patients).

Data were pooled from several clinical trials and therapeutic drug monitoring datasets from different countries. The number of children/observations was 505/3667 for efavirenz. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using a non-linear mixed-effects approach. For abacavir and lamivudine, data from 187 and 920 subjects were available (population pharmacokinetic models previously published). Efavirenz/lamivudine/abacavir FDC strength options assessed were (I) 150/75/150, (II) 120/60/120 and (III) 200/100/200 mg. Monte Carlo simulations of the different FDC strengths were performed to determine the optimal dose within each of the WHO weight bands based on drug efficacy/safety targets. The probability of being within the target efavirenz concentration range 12 h post-dose (1-4 mg/L) varied between 56% and 60%, regardless of FDC option. Option I provided a best possible balance between efavirenz treatment failure and toxicity risks. For abacavir and lamivudine, simulations showed that for option I >75% of subjects were above the efficacy target. According to simulations, a paediatric efavirenz/lamivudine/abacavir fixed-dose formulation of 150 mg efavirenz, 75 mg lamivudine and 150 mg abacavir provided the most effective and safe concentrations across WHO weight bands, with the flexibility of dosage required across the paediatric population.

We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in suboptimal responders to lamivudine plus adefovir. Charts were reviewed for LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who visited the Zhejiang Province People's Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, from June 2009 to May 2013. Patients whose serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA remained detectable despite at least 6 mo of LAM plus ADV combination therapy were included. Patients with a suboptimal response to LAM plus ADV were randomized to switch to TDF monotherapy (300 mg/d orally; TDF group) or to continuation with LAM (100 mg/d orally) plus ADV (10 mg/d orally; LAM plus ADV group) and were followed for 48 wk. Serum HBV DNA was determined at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48. HBV serological markers and biochemistry were assessed at baseline and weeks 12, 24, and 48. Resistance surveillance and side effects were monitored during therapy. Fifty-nine patient were randomized to switch to TDF (n = 28) or continuation with LAM plus ADV (n = 31). No significant differences were found between the groups at baseline. Prior to TDF therapy, all patients had been exposed to LAM plus ADV for a median of 11 mo (range: 6-24 mo). No difference was seen in baseline serum HBV DNA between the two groups [5.13 Â± 1.08 log10 copies/mL (TDF) vs 5.04 Â± 31.16 log10 copies/mL (LAM + ADV), P = 0.639]. There was no significant difference in the rates of achieving complete virological response (CVR) at week 4 between the TDF and LAM + ADV groups (17.86% vs 6.45%, P = 0.24).

Pharmacological studies in cell and animal model suggest that Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have anti-hepatitis B virus effect. Observational studies offer mixed results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between the use of CHMs and outcome in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving lamivudine treatment and further estimate the association of Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-Sang (JWXYS) use with mortality of those patients. We conducted a cohort study among patients age 20-90 years within a National Health Insurance Healthcare system. Information on the use of CHMs and covariates were obtained from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for all-cause mortality among CHMs users compared to nonusers. Among 1037 patients studied from 2004 to 2011, median follow-up time 5.3 years and 88 deaths were identified. During the study period, 49% of patients used CHMs and the median duration of use was 2.4 years. We found that significant difference on all-cause mortality among CHMs users (aHR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76) compared to CHMs nonusers. All-cause mortality also differed by JWXYS use (aHR=0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.83). This study reveals that the use of CHMs may lower the risk of death in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving lamivudine treatment. Further randomized-controlled trials are required to validate these findings. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At baseline, patients were randomized 1:1 to switch to atazanavir/ritonavirâ+âlamivudine or to continue the previous regimen. Here, we report the 96âweek efficacy and safety data. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01599364. Overall, 266 subjects were enrolled (133 in each arm). At 96âweeks, in the ITT population, patients free of treatment failure totalled 103 (77.4%) with atazanavir/ritonavirâ+âlamivudine and 87 (65.4%) with triple therapy (difference +12.0%, 95% CI +1.2/+22.8, Pâ=â0.030), demonstrating the superiority of dual therapy. Two (1.5%) and 9 (6.8%) virological failures occurred in the dual-therapy arm and the triple-therapy arm, respectively, without development of resistance to any study drug. Clinical adverse events occurred at similar rates in both arms. A higher frequency of grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia (66.9% versus 50.4%, Pâ=â0.006) and hypertriglyceridaemia (6.8% versus 1.5%, Pâ=â0.031) occurred with dual therapy, although this never led to treatment discontinuation.

To determine hepatitis B virus genomic evolution during antiviral therapy we characterized the HBV quasi-species in a patient who did no respond to therapy following lamivudine breakthrough for a period of 14 years. Case Presentation The polymerase and precore/core genes were amplified and sequenced at determined intervals in a period of 14 years. HBV viral load and HBeAg/Anti-HBe serological profiles as well as amino transferase levels were also measured. A mixture of lamivudine-resistant genotype A2 HBV strains harboring the rtM204V mutation coexisted in the patient following viral breakthrough to lamivudine. The L180M+M204V dominant mutant displayed strong lamivudine-resistance. As therapy was changed to adefovir, then to entecavir, and finally to entecavir-tenofovir the viral load showed fluctuations but lamivudine-resistant strains continued to be selected, with minor contributions to the HBV quasi-species composition of additional resistance-associated mutations. At the end of the 14-year follow up period, high viral loads were predominant, with viral strains harboring the lamivudine-resistance signature rtL180M+M204V. The precore/core frame A1762T and G1764A double mutation was detected before treatment and remaining in this condition during the entire follow-up. Specific entecavir and tenofovir primary resistance-associated mutations were not detected at any time. Plasma concentrations of tenofovir indicated adequate metabolism of the drug. Conclusions We report the selection of HBV mutants carrying well-defined primary resistance mutations that escaped lamivudine in a fourteen-year follow-up period. With the exception of tenofovir resistance mutations, subsequent unselected primary resistance mutations were detected as minor populations into the HBV quasispecies composition during adefovir or entecavir monotherapies.

The recent introduction of entecavir in Australia for the treatment of CHB patients in the naive treatment setting has triggered significant optimism with regards to improved clinical outcomes for CHB patients. To estimate, from an Australian healthcare perspective, the cost effectiveness of entecavir 0.5 mg/day versus lamivudine 100 mg/day in the treatment of CHB patients naive to nucleos(t)ide therapy. A cost-utility analysis to project the clinical and economic outcomes associated with CHB disease and treatment was conducted by developing two decision-tree models specific to hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg+ve) and HBeAg-ve CHB patient subsets. This analysis was constructed using the Australian payer perspective of direct costs and outcomes, with indirect medical costs and lost productivity not being included. The study population comprised a hypothetical cohort of 1000 antiviral treatment-naive CHB patients who received either entecavir 0.5 mg/day or lamivudine 100 mg/day at model entry. The population of patients used in this analysis was representative of those patients likely to receive initial antiviral therapy in clinical practice in Australia. The long-term cost effectiveness of entecavir compared with lamivudine in the first-line treatment of CHB patients was expressed as an incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) or QALY gained. Results revealed that the availability of entecavir 0.5 mg/day as part of the Australian hepatologist's treatment armamentarium should result in significantly lower future rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) events (i.e. 54 fewer cases of CC, seven fewer cases of DC, and 20 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg+ve CHB patients, and 69 fewer cases of CC, eight fewer cases of DC and 25 fewer cases of HCC over the model's timeframe for HBeAg-ve CHB patients\n\nIntentional overdose of dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine (Triumeq) in a 26-year-old man.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Dam, Paul Mel; van Geffen, Mark Wl; Havenith, Thomas Ra; Posthouwer, Dirk\n\n2018-03-13\n\nTriumeq is a single-tablet regimen for patients with HIV infection comprising dolutegravir, abacavir and lamivudine.

There are three combinations of these drugs which have been approved by different guidelines, each with divergent results in terms of efficacy and safety. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of these three combinations. Methods: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing fixed doses of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate / Emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), Abacavir / Lamivudine (ABC/3TC) and Zidovudine / Lamivudine (ZDV/3TC). Results: Seven clinical trials met the eligibility criteria. The results suggested higher efficacy with TDF/FTC vs. ABC/3TC at 96 weeks and vs. ZDV/3TC at 48 weeks. However, there is clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis were performed by third drug and by level of viral load prior to treatment, and found no differences in virological control. Network meta-analysis could only be carried out with TDF/FTC vs. ZDV/3TC, and the proportion of patients with virological response, with no differences at 48 weeks nor at 96 weeks. Direct comparisons showed an increased risk of bone marrow suppression of ZDV/3TC vs. TDF/FTC and of ABC/3TC hypersensitivity reactions vs. ZDV/3TC Conclusions: The results did not show differences in effectiveness among the interventions. However, due to the heterogeneity of the third drug and the follow-up time between the included studies, this result is not definitive. The results raise the need for further studies to help improve treatment recommendations in patients infected with HIV.

We conducted an open-label, randomized study to compare the noninferiority of ddI/3TC/EFV with the lamivudine-zidovudine tablet and EFV (COM/EFV), both administered with food to improve tolerability and convenience. Patients were stratified by HIV-1 RNA level of <5.0 log(10) or > or =5.0 log(10) copies/mL. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with an HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL at week 48, determined by intention-to-treat analysis. Three hundred sixty-nine patients were randomized: 186 for ddI/3TC/EFV treatment and 183 for COM/EFV treatment. Both groups were well matched in terms of baseline characteristics; 19.3% of patients received a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assessment of clinical category C, median HIV RNA level was 5.0 log(10) copies/mL, and median CD4(+) cell count was 208 cells/microL. At week 48, by intention-to-treat analysis, 70% of patients in the ddI/3TC/EFV group and 63% of patients in the COM/EFV group had an HIV-1 RNA level of <50 copies/mL (treatment difference, 7.1%; 95% confidence interval, -2.39% to 16.59%). Fourteen patients (8%) in the ddI/3TC/EFV arm (not the COM/EFV arm) and 26 patients (14%) in the COM/EFV arm (not the ddI/3TC/EFV arm) [corrected] discontinued the study medication because of adverse events (P = .046). One patient (1%) in the ddI/3TC/EFV arm and 11 patients (6%) in the COM/EFV arm discontinued medication because of hematological toxicity (P = .003). At week 48, ddI/3TC/EFV administered once per day with food did not have results inferior to those of COM/EFV treatment. A statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in the COM/EFV arm than in the ddI/3TC/EFV arm discontinued therapy because of adverse events, mainly because of hematological toxicity.

Currently recommended regimens for initiating HIV treatment consist of either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) combined with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). However, there may be some patients for whom NNRTIs and PIs may not be appropriate. This is an update of the review published in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2009. To evaluate the effects of any fixed-dose combination of three NRTIs (co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine) for initial treatment of HIV infection. Between December 2010 and July 2011, we used standard Cochrane methods to search electronic databases and conference proceedings with relevant search terms without limits to language or publication status. We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum follow-up time of six months which compared co-formulated abacavir-lamivudine-zidovudine with either PI-based or NNRTI-based therapy among antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients aged at least 13 years. Three authors independently selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving discrepancies by consensus. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), as appropriate, with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and conducted meta-analysis using the random-effects method because of significant statistical heterogeneity (P<0.1). We identified 15 potentially eligible RCTs, four of which met our inclusion criteria. The four included RCTs were conducted in the United States of America (USA); USA, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, and Panama; USA and Mexico; and Botswana, respectively.

Children were followed for median 114 weeks. At week 48, 242/331 (73%) twice daily vs 236/330 (72%) once daily had viral load less than 80 copies/ml [difference -1.6% (95% confidence interval -8.4,+5.2%) Pâ=â0.65]; 79% twice daily vs 78% once daily had viral load less than 400 copies/ml (Pâ=â0.76) (week 96 results similar). One grade 3/4 adverse event was judged uncertainly related to abacavirâ+âlamivudine (hepatitis; once daily). At week 48, 9% twice daily vs 10% once daily reported missing one or more ART pills in the last 4 weeks (Pâ=â0.74) and 8 vs 8% at week 96 (Pâ=â0.90). Carers strongly preferred once-daily dosing. There was no difference between randomized groups in postbaseline drug-resistance mutations or drug-susceptibility; WHO 3/4 events; ART-modifying, grade 3/4 or serious adverse events; CD4% or weight-for-age/height-for-age (all Pâ>â0.15). Once-daily abacavirâ+âlamivudine was noninferior to twice daily in viral load suppression, with similar resistance, adherence, clinical\n\nBioequivalence of a dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine fixed-dose combination tablet and the effect of food.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeller, Stephen; Chen, Shuguang; Borland, Julie; Savina, Paul; Wynne, Brian; Piscitelli, Stephen C\n\n2014-08-01\n\nThe integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and nucleoside analogues abacavir and lamivudine are once-daily treatment options for HIV. This study (NCT01622790) evaluated, first, the bioequivalence (BE) of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg (dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC) vs coadministered dolutegravir 50 mg and abacavir/lamivudine combination tablets (Epzicom) and, second, the effect of food on the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC tablet. Study part A (66 healthy subjects) was a single-dose, open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study to evaluate the BE of the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC tablet and dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine tablets in the fasted state. In study part B, 12 subjects from part A received the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC tablet with a high-fat meal. BE and food effect were assessed by analysis of variance to determine the ratio of geometric least squares means and associated 90% confidence intervals for key pharmacokinetic parameters for each of dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine. Sixty-two subjects completed part A. The dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine tablet was bioequivalent to the dolutegravir + abacavir/lamivudine tablets; 90% confidence intervals for the geometric least squares mean ratios fell within the 0.8-1.25 BE criteria. The effect of food on the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC tablet was similar to previous food effects observed with the separate formulations. The safety profile was comparable between treatments, with no observed serious or grade 3/4 adverse events. The BE of the dolutegravir/abacavir/lamivudine FDC tablet was demonstrated; it may be administered without regard to meals.\n\nResponse by gender of HIV-1-infected subjects treated with abacavir/lamivudine plus atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, for 144 weeks.\n\nPubMed\n\nSquires, Kathleen E; Young, Benjamin; Santiago, Lizette; Dretler, Robin H; Walmsley, Sharon L; Zhao, Henry H; Pakes, Gary E; Ross, Lisa L; Shaefer, Mark S\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe 144-week results of the open-label, multicenter Atazanavir/Ritonavir Induction with Epzicom Study (ARIES) were stratified by gender to compare treatment responses. A total of 369 HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naÃ¯ve subjects receiving once-daily abacavir/lamivudine + atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) whose HIV-1 RNA was <50 copies/mL by week 30 were randomized 1:1 at week 36 to maintain or discontinue ritonavir for 108 subsequent weeks. Between- and within-treatment gender-related efficacy and safety differences were analyzed. Subjects were 85% male; 64% white; and had a mean age of 39 years, baseline median HIV-1 RNA of 114,815 copies/mL, and median CD4+ cell count of 198 cells/mm 3 . Gender (ATV [n=189]: 29 females/160 males; ATV/r [n=180]: 25 females/155 males) and most other demographics were similar between groups; more females than males were black (65% vs 25%) and fewer females had baseline HIV-1 RNA â¥100,000 copies/mL (41% vs 58%). At week 144, no significant differences between genders were observed in proportion maintaining HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL (ATV, 79% vs 77%; ATV/r, 60% vs 75%) or <400 copies/mL (ATV, 83% vs 84%; ATV/r, 68% vs 82%) (intent-to-treat-exposed: time to loss of virologic response analysis); median CD4+ change from baseline (ATV, +365 vs +300 cells/mm 3 ; ATV/r, +344 vs +301 cells/mm 3 ); proportion with treatment-related grade 2-4 adverse events (baseline to week 144: ATV, 41% vs 31%; ATV/r, 36% vs 43%; weeks 36 to 144: ATV, 14% vs 13%; ATV/r, 24% vs 23%); or proportion developing fasting lipid changes. Female and male virologic failure rates (ATV, 0 vs 5; ATV/r, 2 vs 4) and proportions completing the study were similar during the extension phase. Primary withdrawal reasons were loss to follow-up and pregnancy for females and loss to follow-up and other for males. Over 144 weeks, no significant gender differences were observed in efficacy, safety, or fasting lipid changes with abacavir/lamivudine +ATV or abacavir/lamivudine +ATV/r.\n\nSelection of drug-resistant HIV-1 during the early phase of viral decay is uncommon in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients initiated on a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen including lamivudine.\n\nPubMed\n\nBergroth, Tobias; Ekici, Halime; GisslÃ©n, Magnus; Loes, Sabine Kinloch-de; Goh, Li-Ean; Freedman, Andrew; Lampe, Fiona; Johnson, Margaret A; SÃ¶nnerborg, Anders\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTherapy failure due to drug resistance development is a common phenomenon in HIV-infected patients. However, when the drug pressure leads to the earliest selection of drug-resistant HIV-1 populations is still unclear. In this study, the extent to which selection of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase M184I/V mutations occur during the initial phase of viral decay in treatment-naÃ¯ve HIV-1 infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) was examined. Plasma virus from three cohorts of treatment-naÃ¯ve patients initiating quadruple (n = 43), triple (n = 14) or dual (n = 15) lamivudine-containing ART were analyzed for M184I/V during the first 6 months of therapy using direct sequencing and a sensitive selective real-time PCR method. Among quadruple ART patients, who all were treated at primary HIV-1 infection, only one patient developed M184V after 6 weeks of therapy, having had wild-type virus at baseline. No mutations were found in chronically infected patients on triple ART. In patients on dual therapy, M184I/V mutants were found frequently. Selection of M184I/V mutants was found to be rare during the initial phase of viral decay after initiation of ART in adherent patients given a three or four-drug combination, in contrast to those receiving a less potent regimen. The results suggest that triple and quadruple lamivudine + PI or PI/r containing ART given to treatment-naÃ¯ve adherent patients is potent enough to prevent development of resistance during the first months of therapy.\n\nCost-effectiveness comparison of lamivudine plus adefovir combination treatment and nucleos(t)ide analog monotherapies in Chinese chronic hepatitis B patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Chi; Ke, Weixia; Liu, Li; Gao, Yanhui; Yao, Zhenjiang; Ye, Xiaohua; Zhou, Shudong; Yang, Yi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLamivudine (LAM) plus adefovir (ADV) combination therapy is clinically efficacious for treating chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in China, but no pharmacoeconomic evaluations of this strategy are available. The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of LAM plus ADV combination treatment compared with five other nucleos(t)ide analog monotherapies (LAM, ADV, telbivudine [TBV], entecavir [ETV], and tenofovir [TDF]). To simulate the lifetime (40-year time span) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for different therapy options, a Markov model that included five initial monotherapies and LAM plus ADV combination as an initial treatment was developed. Two kinds of rescue combination strategies (base-case: LAM + ADV then ETV + ADV; alternative: direct use of ETV + ADV) were considered separately for treating patients refractory to initial therapy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore model uncertainties. In base-case analysis, ETV had the lowest lifetime cost and served as the reference therapy. Compared to the reference, LAM, ADV, and TBV had higher costs and lower efficacy, and were completely dominated by ETV. LAM plus ADV combination therapy or TDF was more efficacious than ETV, but also more expensive. Although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of combination therapy or TDF were both higher than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,466/QALY gained for the reference treatment, in an alternative scenario analysis LAM plus ADV combination therapy would be the preferable treatment option. ETV and LAM plus ADV combination therapy are both cost-effective strategies for treating Chinese CHB patients.\n\nEffectiveness and safety of generic version of abacavir/lamivudine and efavirenz in treatment naÃ¯ve HIV-infected patients: a nonrandomized, open-label, phase IV study in Cali-Colombia, 2011-2012.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalindo, Jaime; Amariles, Pedro; Mueses-MarÃ­n, HÃ©ctor F; HincapiÃ©, Jaime A; GonzÃ¡lez-AvendaÃ±o, SebastiÃ¡n; Galindo-Orrego, Ximena\n\n2016-10-03\n\nGeneric drug policies are often associated with concerns about the quality and effectiveness of these products. Phase IV clinical trials may be a suitable design to assess the effectiveness and safety of generic drugs. The objective of this study was to describe the effectiveness and the safety of the generic abacavir/lamivudine and efavirenz in treatment-naÃ¯ve HIV-infected patients. A monocentric, nonrandomized, open-label, phase IV study in treatment naÃ¯ve HIV-infected patients 18Â years or older with indication to receive abacavir/lamivudine and efavirenz were recruited from a program that provides comprehensive outpatient consultation and continuing care. The primary end-point was to achieve viral load <40 copies/mL at 12Â months after baseline to assess effectiveness. Secondary end-point of the study were 1) to asses increasing in T-CD4 lymphocytes levels as accompaniment to asses effectiveness, and 2) to assess both gastrointestinal, skin, and central nervous system symptoms, and lipid profile, cardiovascular risk, renal, and hepatic function as safety profile. Data were determined at baseline, 3, 6, and 12Â months. Close clinical monitoring and pharmaceutical care were used for data collection. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare proportions or medians. Sixty patients were invited to participate in the study; 42 were enrolled and 33 completed the follow-up. Of the nine patients excluded from the study, only one was withdrawn due to adverse events. At 12Â months, 31 of 42 patients (73.8Â % in intention-to-treat analysis) achieved a viral load of HIV1 RNA <40 copies/mL. There was a significant increase (172 cells/mm 3 ) in the median for CD4 T lymphocyte count. The adverse events were mild and met the safety profile for this antiretroviral regimen, mainly of central nervous system symptoms, skin rash, lipid abnormalities, and an increase of 2Â % in the median of the percentage of cardiovascular risk. The clinical outcomes of generic\n\nAbacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine single-tablet regimen: a review of its use in HIV-1 infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreig, Sarah L; Deeks, Emma D\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen comprising the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir and the nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) abacavir and lamivudine (abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine; TriumeqÂ®) is now available for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults (SINGLE), once-daily dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine had noninferior efficacy to once-daily efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF)/emtricitabine with regard to establishing and sustaining virological suppression over 144 weeks, and subsequent superiority testing significantly favoured dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine. This outcome was predominantly driven by more favourable rates of discontinuation due to adverse events versus the efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine group. These data were generally supported by findings from other phase III trials in ART-naive adults receiving dolutegravir plus either abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir DF/emtricitabine (SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO). Dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine is generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile that appears to be more favourable than efavirenz/tenofovir DF/emtricitabine. In the SINGLE trial, there were no major treatment-emergent INSTI or NRTI resistance-associated mutations in dolutegravir plus abacavir/lamivudine recipients with protocol-defined virological failure, indicating a high genetic barrier to resistance. Thus, triple combination therapy with abacavir, dolutegravir and lamivudine is an effective, generally well tolerated option for the management of HIV-1 infection, with the convenient once-daily fixed-dose tablet providing the first single-tablet regimen option without tenofovir DF.\n\nPharmacokinetic interactions between lersivirine and zidovudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine.\n\nPubMed\n\nVourvahis, Manoli; Davis, John; Langdon, Grant; Layton, Gary; Fang, Juanzhi; Choo, Heng Wee; Hansson, Arne G; Tawadrous, Margaret\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo investigate pharmacokinetic interactions associated with coadministration of lersivirine with zidovudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)/emtricitabine (Truvada(Â®)) or abacavir/lamivudine (Epzicom(Â®)/Kivexa(Â®)).
