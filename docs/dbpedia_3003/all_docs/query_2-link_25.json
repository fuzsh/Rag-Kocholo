        "text": "The Vanguard men’s basketball program welcomes Caleb Martin in his first year as an assistant coach.\n\nMartin replaces Selle Hann, who accepted an assistant coaching position at UT Martin.\n\nMartin joins the Lions after spending two years as an assistant coach at Harvard Westlake High School under David Rebibo. The Wolverines won back-to-back California State Open Division championships during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons, finishing with a cumulative 66-5 record. Martin helped mentor several Division I talents, including Trent Perry, who became the California Gatorade Player of the Year and a McDonald’s All-American.\n\nHe also served as the Head Junior Varsity coach for Harvard Westlake from 2022-24, leading those teams to 25-plus wins and league championships in both years.\n\n“It is really difficult losing someone of Selle Hann’s caliber and character on our coaching staff,” said Vanguard Head Coach Rhett Soliday. “We’ve tried to be very deliberate about finding the person who would be aligned and talented enough to keep us moving forward as a program into the Division II ranks. Caleb Martin is an absolute rising star in the coaching ranks. He has experience in all facets of the game at both the high school and college levels both as a student-athlete and as a high school coach. He is hungry to compete, motivated to impact, and built to lead. We could not ask for a better fit in terms of his deep faith and his desire to share that with the student-athletes he will lead.”\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Martin previously worked five years at Oaks Christian High School. He eventually was elevated to the lead assistant role under both Mark Amaral and current VU assistant coach Jordan Wild. Martin played an integral part in propelling the program into the playoffs.\n\nHis coaching experience also involved working with the prestigious travel AAU program – BTI of Pasadena – where he helped train the 15u through the 17u age groups on the Puma Circuit. BTI is renowned for developing several former NBA and elite Division I players on the West Coast.\n\nAs a player, Martin competed collegiately at Pepperdine under head coach Marty Wilson. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Sports Administration with a certificate in Conflict Management in 2020.\n\nHe graduated from the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks as a high school player, winning a CIF Division title and earning Liberty League MVP and CIF Division 4 First Team.\n\n“I am incredibly blessed to join Vanguard University and Coach Rhett Soliday’s men’s basketball program,” said Martin. “It is an institution of great faith, community, and excellence on and off the court. I love this game and choose to use basketball as a vehicle to teach the good news. I will give every ounce of energy to our players and staff.”"
