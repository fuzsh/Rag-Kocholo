        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- University of San Francisco head coach Rex Walters has announced the appointment of David Rebibo to the position of assistant coach.\n\nRebibo comes to the Hilltop after serving as the head coach at El Camino High School in Woodland Hills Calif. for the past six years.\n\nEl Camino reached the semifinals or finals of the Los Angeles City Section Division II Championship in four of Rebibo's six seasons at the helm, claiming its first title in school history in 2012. Last season, Rebibo guided the Conquistadors to a 28-4 record and an appearance in the City Section Division II title game. El Camino's four losses on the year came against state playoff participants Chaminade, Brentwood, Westchester and Mater Dei.\n\nRebibo received coach of the year honors for the greater Los Angeles Area following the 2012 and '13 campaigns. Six of his former players went on to play on the collegiate level.\n\n“We are very excited to add David Rebibo to our coaching staff,” said Walters. “He is rising young coach and has already accomplished so much at both the high school and AAU levels. I believe Dave will add a great deal to our staff in terms of teaching, scouting and recruiting. I'm looking forward to working with him.”\n\nRebibo played junior college basketball at Valley College for two seasons (2003-04) before transferring to Cal State-Northridge, where he received his undergraduate degree in psychology in 2006. He also completed course work to obtain his teaching credential and earned his master's degree in education from National University.\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Rebibo currently resides in San Francisco."
