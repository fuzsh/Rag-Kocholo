        "text": "RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA - Harvard-Westlake coach David Rebibo has a reputation of being one of the top high school boys basketball coaches in the country.\n\nHe's won six straight Mission League titles. He's sent a bevy of players off to big collegiate programs. He's tactful. His teams are always prepared. The Wolverines are the defending CIF State Open Division champions.\n\nIt's felt like Harvard-Westlake has won it all. Not until Friday night.\n\nDespite earning five straight Open Division playoff berths, the Wolverines finally won the CIF Southern Section Open Division crown that's eluded them after defeating Eastvale Roosevelt 54-47 at Cal Baptist University.\n\n\"When you approach the season, you're trying to win your league, then you try to win your section, then you're trying to win state and, and it's in that order,\" Rebibo said. \"The Southern Section is arguably one of the toughest sections in the country and to win it says a lot about your program.\"\n\n(photos by Andy Holzman)\n\nMcDonald's All-American Trent Perry scored 13 points. Nik Khamenia and Robert Hinton each had 15 points for the Wolverines.\n\nIt's Harvard-Westlake's 11th Southern Section title in program history and first Open Division title in its second appearance after falling short to Corona Centennial in 2022. Wolverines claim their first section title since 2017 (Division 1A).\n\nRoosevelt's Darnez Slater hit two 3-pointers in the final three minutes that kept the Mustangs within striking distance. His first 3-pointer made it 48-44 with 2:40 to play. His second made it 50-47 with 40 seconds left.\n\nThere was drama in the final 15 seconds with Harvard-Westlake holding onto a 50-47 lead. Trent Perry missed free throws before a foul was called on Roosevelt attempting to rebound Perry's second miss.\n\nMost of the arena filled with Roosevelt fans erupted in disagreement.\n\nHinton then made two free throws with 13 seconds left to extend the Wolverines' lead to 52-47.\n\n“It’s extremely difficult,” Roosevelt coach Stephen Singleton said about how those final seconds played out. “Our boys were playing and battling against a great team in Harvard-Westlake. When calls are not going your way all night long, it’s that much tougher to take. It just seemed like they (the Wolverines) were getting into the bonus very quickly and easily.”\n\nSingleton added: “I’m disappointed because I don’t think our guys were given a good opportunity to compete.\"\n\nHarvard-Westlake earned 31 trips to the free throw line (making 21). Roosevelt was 13 of 16 from the charity stripe.\n\nSlater led Roosevelt with 18 points (and six rebounds). Star junior Brayden Burries had 14 points and Issac Williamson had nine.\n\nFULL BOXSCORE"
