        "text": "Imaging technique for the complete edentulous patient treated conventionally or with mini implant overdenture\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMeleÅcanu Imre, M; Preoteasa, E; ÈÃ¢ncu, AM; Preoteasa, CT\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRationale. The imaging methods are more and more used in the clinical process of modern dentistry. Once the implant based treatment alternatives are nowadays seen as being the standard of care in edentulous patients, these techniques must be integrated in the complete denture treatment. Aim. The study presents some evaluation techniques for the edentulous patient treated by conventional dentures or mini dental implants (mini SKY Bredent) overdentures, using the profile teleradiography. These offer data useful for an optimal positioning of the artificial teeth and the mini dental implants, favoring to obtain an esthetic and functional treatment outcome. We proposed also a method to conceive a simple surgical guide that allows the prosthetically driven implants placement. Material and method. Clinical case reports were made, highlighting the importance of cephalometric evaluation on lateral teleradiographs in complete edentulous patients. A clinical case that gradually reports the surgical guide preparation (Bredent silicon radio opaque), in order to place the mini dental implants in the best prosthetic and anatomic conditions, was presented. Conclusions. The profile teleradiograph is a useful tool for the practitioner. It allows establishing the optimal site for implant placement, in a good relation with the overdenture. The conventional denture can be easily and relatively costless transformed in a surgical guide used during implant placement.

Part 1: Clinically Related Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlzoubi, Fawaz; Bedrossian, Edmond; Wong, Allen; Farrell, Douglas; Park, Chan; Indresano, Thomas\n\nTo assess outcomes of treating completely edentulous patients with a fixed implant-supported profile prosthesis utilizing a graftless approach for the maxilla and for the mandible, with emphasis on clinically related outcomes, specifically implant and prosthesis survival. This was a retrospective study with the following inclusion criteria: completely edentulous patients rehabilitated with a fixed implant-supported profile denture utilizing a graftless approach. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were asked to participate in the study during their follow-up visits, and hence a consecutive sampling strategy was used. Data regarding implant and prosthesis cumulative survival rates (CSRs) were gathered and calculated. Thirty-four patients were identified with a total of 220 implants placed. An overall CSR of 98.2% was recorded with an observation of up to 10 years. For tilted, axial, and zygomatic implants, CSRs of 96.9%, 98.0%, and 100%, respectively, were observed for up to 10 years. For provisional prostheses, CSRs of 92.3% at 1 year, and 84.6% at 2 years were observed. For final prostheses, a CSR of 93.8% was observed at 10 years. The results suggest that treating completely edentulous patients with a fixed profile prosthesis utilizing a graftless approach in the maxilla and the mandible can be a reliable treatment option.\n\nOK-432 (Picibanil) sclerotherapy for recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint in elderly edentulous patients: Case reports.\n\nPubMed\n\nMatsushita, Kazuhiro; Abe, Takae; Fujiwara, Toshikatsu\n\n2007-09-01\n\nDislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a thorny problem not only for a patient but also a doctor. Especially for the elderly edentulous patients, it is very hard to treat the condition although there are many surgical and non-surgical procedures. We successfully treated it in two elderly edentulous patients by injection of OK-432 as a sclerosing agent.\n\nImplant rehabilitation of partial maxillectomy edentulous patient\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGowda, Mahesh E.; Mohan, Murali S.; Verma, Kamal; Roy, I. D.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nEdentulous patients with maxillectomy defects present a significant challenge for prosthetic rehabilitation and the adaptive capabilities of the patient as retention is highly compromised. Hence, the option of using endosseous implants to increase obturator retention has been used. A patient of mucormycosis of the left maxilla was treated with surgical excision. After satisfactory healing, definitive implant supported magnet retained prosthesis was fabricated for the patient. Implants with magnetic units offer a practical method of improving the retention of obturators provided acceptable prosthetic protocols are followed for the rehabilitation.

The advent of osseointegrated implants would seem to provide a new means of treating these cases. Accordingly, the cases of six patients for whom either fixed partial dentures or over-dentures supported by BrÃ¥nemark implants were provided, are reviewed. Three of the mandibles were normal and three had bone grafts. Results so far indicate that this is a viable alternative for treating such cases.\n\nTransition from a fixed implant dental prosthesis to an implant overdenture in an edentulous patient: a clinical report.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Bolouri; Bhavani, Venkatachalam\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe lack of planning before implant placement and restoration in edentulous patients can lead to a number of problems. Prosthodontists are often faced with the challenge of re-treating patients who have only recently been treated. Although many reports discuss retreatment by fabricating all new prosthetic components, few discuss salvaging parts of the patient's existing prosthesis. This report details the treatment of an edentulous patient who presented with an implant-retained fixed dental prosthesis in the maxillary arch and no opposing prosthesis. The transition from an implant-retained fixed dental prosthesis to a removable implant- and tissue-supported overdenture that uses the patient's existing computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing milled titanium substructure is described.

However, it is still a major challenge to fully restore oral function to edentulous adult patients with ectodermal dysplasia (ED). The aim of this study was to determine an effective treatment protocol for restoring oral function using ZIs and CIs to edentulous adult ED patients. Ten edentulous adult ED patients were treated in this study. The treatment protocol involved the following: (1) bone augmentation in the region of the anterior teeth; (2) placement of two ZIs and four CIs in the maxilla, and four CIs in the mandible; (3) fabrication of dental prosthesis; and (4) psychological and oral education. Following treatment of these patients, implant success rates, biological complications, patient satisfaction, and psychological changes were recorded. Although there was evidence of bone graft resorption in the maxilla, bone augmentation of the mandible was successful in all patients. Nine CIs in the maxilla failed and were removed. All ZIs were successful, and the CIs success rates were 77.50% in the maxilla and 100% in the mandible, with a mean of 88.75%. The mean peri-implant bone resorption for the CIs ranged from 1.3âÂ±â0.4âmm to 1.8âÂ±â0.6âmm, and four cases exhibited gingival hyperplasia in the maxilla and mandible. One hundred percent of the patients were satisfied with the restoration of their oral function, and >50% of the patients exhibited enhanced self-confidence and self-esteem. This study demonstrates that oral function can be restored in edentulous adult ED patients using a comprehensive and systematic treatment protocol involving psychological and oral education, bone augmentation, implant placement, and denture fabrication. Despite these positive outcomes, bone augmentation remains challenging in the anterior region of the maxilla for edentulous adult ED patients.

The efficacy of nasal ventilation in edentulous patients has been cited in case reports but has never been investigated. Consecutive edentulous adult patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, during a 17-month period, were prospectively evaluated. After induction of anesthesia and administration of neuromuscular blocker, lungs were ventilated with a standard anatomical face mask of appropriate size, using a volume controlled anesthesia ventilator with tidal volume set at 10 ml/kg. In case of inadequate ventilation, the mask position was adjusted to achieve best-fit. Inspired and expired tidal volumes were measured. Thereafter, the face mask was replaced by a nasal mask and after achieving best-fit, the inspired and expired tidal volumes were recorded. The difference in expired tidal volumes and airway pressures at best-fit with the use of the two masks and number of patients with inadequate ventilation with use of the masks were statistically analyzed. A total of 79 edentulous patients were recruited for the study. The difference in expiratory tidal volumes with the use of the two masks at best-fit was statistically significant (P = 0.0017). Despite the best-fit mask placement, adequacy of ventilation could not be achieved in 24.1% patients during face mask ventilation, and 12.7% patients during nasal mask ventilation and the difference was statistically significant. Nasal mask ventilation is more efficient than standard face mask ventilation in edentulous patients.\n\nNasal mask ventilation is better than face mask ventilation in edentulous patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKapoor, Mukul Chandra; Rana, Sandeep; Singh, Arvind Kumar; Vishal, Vindhya; Sikdar, Indranil\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground and Aims: Face mask ventilation of the edentulous patient is often difficult as ineffective seating of the standard mask to the face prevents attainment of an adequate air seal.

The aim of this report was to propose a new bite block for panoramic radiographs of anterior edentulous patients that better addresses these two issues. A new panoramic radiography bite block similar to the bite block for dentulous patients was developed to enable proper positioning stability for edentulous patients. The new bite block was designed and implemented in light of previous studies. The height of the new bite block was 18 mm and to compensate for the horizontal edentulous space, its horizontal width was 7 mm. The panoramic radiographs using the new bite block were compared with those using the conventional chin-support device. Panoramic radiographs taken with the new bite block showed better stability and bilateral symmetry than those taken with the conventional chin-support device. Patients also showed less movement and more stable positioning during panoramic radiography with the new bite block. Conventional errors in panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients could be caused by unreliability of the chin-support device. The newly proposed bite block for panoramic radiographs of edentulous patients showed better reliability. Further study is required to evaluate the image quality and reproducibility of images with the new bite block.\n\nPatterns of Mortality in Patients Treated with Dental Implants: A Comparison of Patient Age Groups and Corresponding Reference Populations.\n\nPubMed\n\nJemt, Torsten; Kowar, Jan; Nilsson, Mats; Stenport, Victoria\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLittle is known about the relationship between implant patient mortality compared to reference populations. The aim of this study was to report the mortality pattern in patients treated with dental implants up to a 15-year period, and to compare this to mortality in reference populations with regard to age at surgery, sex, and degree of tooth loss. Patient cumulative survival rate (CSR) was calculated for a total of 4,231 treated implant patients from a single clinic. Information was based on surgical registers in the clinic and the National Population Register in Sweden. Patients were arranged into age groups of 10 years, and CSR was compared to that of the reference population of comparable age and reported in relation to age at surgery, sex, and type of jaw/dentition. A similar, consistent, general relationship between CSR of different age groups of implant patients and reference populations could be observed for all parameters studied. Completely edentulous patients presented higher mortality than partially edentulous patients (P < .05). Furthermore, implant patients in younger age groups showed mortality similar to or higher than reference populations, while older patient age groups showed increasingly lower mortality than comparable reference populations for edentulous and partially edentulous patients (P < .05). A consistent pattern of mortality in different age groups of patients compared to reference populations was observed, indicating higher patient mortality in younger age groups and lower in older groups. The reported pattern is not assumed to be related to implant treatment per se, but is assumed to reflect the variation in general health of a selected subgroup of treated implant patients compared to the reference population in different age groups.\n\nFabricating a stable record base for completely edentulous patients treated with osseointegrated implants using healing abutments.\n\nPubMed\n\nRungcharassaeng, K; Kan, J Y\n\n1999-02-01\n\nA stable record base is essential for accurate interocclusal centric relation records in a completely edentulous patient. In implant prosthodontics, several procedures have been suggested for the fabrication of a stable record base. However, these procedures necessitate removal of the healing abutments during the interocclusal record procedure and the trial denture placement, which makes the procedures tedious and time-consuming. When the implant-prosthesis interface is subgingival, the patient may also experience discomfort during these procedures. This article describes a procedure for fabricating a stable record base that uses the healing abutments, which eliminates the necessity of the healing abutment removal and its consequences. Advantages and disadvantages of this procedure are also discussed.\n\nA cephalometric study to determine the plane of occlusion in completely edentulous patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nHindocha, Amit D; Vartak, Vikas N; Bhandari, Aruna J; Dudani, Mohit T\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDetermination of the plane of occlusion in completely edentulous patients with the help of the ala-tragus line (Camper's plane) may be questioned. An attempt to devise an alternative method to determine the orientation of the plane of occlusion was made. Cephalometric analysis was used to identify whether a correlation exists between the plane of occlusion of dentulous Indian individuals and other stable cranial landmarks. A negative correlation was found to exist between the occlusal Plane-FH plane angle and the porion-nasion-anterior nasal spine (PoNANS) angle. From the derived mathematical correlation, it was concluded that the angulation of the occlusal plane in completely edentulous subjects may be determined by taking a cephalogram at the diagnostic stage. Further, the clinical applicability of the derived mathematical formula (while determining the plane of occlusion) was tested on completely edentulous patients.\n\nA Case of Systemic Infection Caused by Streptococcus pyogenes Oral Infection in an Edentulous Patient.\n\nPubMed\n\nInagaki, Yumi; Abe, Masanobu; Inaki, Ryoko; Zong, Liang; Suenaga, Hideyuki; Abe, Takahiro; Hoshi, Kazuto\n\n2017-08-18\n\nInfections in the oral and maxillofacial region can sometimes extend beyond the oral cavity, with serious consequences. Most oral infections are odontogenic, occurring through the root apex of the tooth or the periodontal pocket. It thus makes sense that edentulous patients have a much lower risk of oral bacterial infection. For this reason, while there are many reports on systemic infections caused by oral infections, few of these describe such infections in edentulous patients. We present a case of oral and maxillofacial cellulitis followed by sepsis due to Streptococcus pyogenes infection in an 89-year-old Japanese edentulous woman. S. pyogenes was detected in the wound of left maxilla and the blood sample. S. pyogenes has been reported to be one of the most common and influential aerobic bacteria associated with deep neck infection and subsequent systemic infection. Left maxillary sinusitis was observed, and this could be the origin of the S. pyogenes infection. S. pyogenes derived from the sinusitis and leaked to the oral cavity might have caused systemic infection through wounding of the oral mucosa. Fortunately, intensive antibiotic therapy was effective, and the patient recovered without any surgical procedures. We experienced a rare case of oral and maxillofacial cellulitis followed by sepsis due to a Streptococcus pyogenes infection in an old edentulous woman. This result indicated that, while edentulous patients are considered to have no risk of odontogenic infection, they still carry a risk of bacterial infection.\n\nEconomic Evaluation of Implant-Supported Overdentures in Edentulous Patients: A Systematic Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Qi; Jin, Xin; Yu, Mengliu; Ou, Guoming; Matsui, Hiroyuki; Liang, Xing; Sasaki, Keiichi\n\nEdentulous patients benefit significantly from implant-supported overdenture prostheses. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implant-supported overdentures (IODs) for edentulous patients. The search was limited to studies written in English and included an electronic and manual search through MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to November 2015), Embase (Ovid, 1966 to November 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to November 2015), and PubMed (to November 2015). Two investigators extracted the data and assessed the studies independently. No meta-analysis was conducted due to the high heterogeneity within the literature. Of the initial 583 selected articles, 10 studies involving 802 participants were included. Of these, 6 studies had a high risk of bias and the rest had an unclear risk of bias. Implant-supported prostheses were more cost-effective when compared to conventional dentures and fixed implant-supported prostheses. Overdentures supported by two implants and magnet attachment were reported as cost-effective. Implant-supported overdentures are a cost-effective treatment for edentulous patients. More clinical studies with appropriate scientific vigor are required to further assess the cost-effectiveness of implant-supported overdentures.\n\nEffects of a denture adhesive in edentulous patients after maxillectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSumita, Yuka I; Otomaru, Takafumi; Taniguchi, Hisashi\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of a denture adhesive in edentulous patients after maxillectomy. Maxillectomy patients suffer from functional impairments. Denture adhesives (DAs) are the solution in such patients. However, little is known about DAs in maxillectomy patients. Eight edentulous patients who had undergone maxillectomy were included and divided into three groups. Group 1 (half â¤ remaining residual maxilla), Group 2 (quarter < remaining residual maxilla < half) and Group 3 (remaining residual maxilla â¤ quarter). They were evaluated by a speech intelligibility test and a mixing ability test, respectively. A cream-type DA called New Poligrip(Â®) (GlaxoSmithKline, Tokyo, Japan) was used. Applying the DA, speech intelligibility showed a higher score than the data without DA. The effects of using a DA depend on the amount of the remaining residual maxilla. Our study showed that if the remaining residual maxilla is less than a quarter (Group 3), it is difficult to have confidence in the effectiveness of the DA to improve masticatory function. On the other hand, the use a DA showed improved speech intelligibility test values in all groups.

Arun; Taruna, M.; Kumar, M. Pavan; Reddy, M. Ramu\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Several methods, some physiological, some radiographical and some merely based on experience are taken upon by the practitioner to get him/her close to VDO in the edentulous patients. No single method can however claim to be the perfect answer. Lateral cephalograms have been a standard mode of determining the vertical dimensions in dentate and edentulous patients since the past. Due to unavoidable manual errors, there are chances of variations in the radiographic method too. Advancement in the digital technology has made recording jaw relations faster, simpler and more precise. Aim This study compared the vertical dimension of occlusion in edentulous patients recorded by using three different physiological methods with the aid of digital cephalometric tracings using indigenously developed PRO-CEPH V3 software. Materials and Methods For the present study a total of 50 dentulous and 25 edentulous patients were selected through inclusion and exclusion criteria. A lateral cephalometric radiograph was taken for all the 50 dentulous subjects at Maximum Intercuspation (VDO) whereas three lateral cephalometric radiographs were obtained for all edentulous patients at the VDO following three different techniques- the Niswongerâs method, Phonetics method and Swallowing threshold method. Cephalometric tracings were carried out using indigenously developed PRO-CEPH V3 software. Linear and angular measurement were made and analysed. Conclusion The indigenously developed software PRO-CEPH V3 is capable of making both the linear and angular measurement and therefore provide with relative credibility information regarding the possible VDO in the edentulous patients through cephalometric radiography. PMID:26155550\n\nLack of dental insurance is correlated with edentulism.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimon, Lisa; Nalliah, Romesh P; Seymour, Brittany\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe correlation between insurance status and edentulism has not previously been reported in a population with known access to a dentist, and little is known about patient demographics in corporate dental settings. This study investigated patient demographics of a former dental franchise in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and examined a correlation between dental insurance and edentulism in this group. The correlation of edentulism with age, gender, and dental risk factors (diabetes, temporomandibular disorder, trouble with previous dental work, or oral sores and ulcers) was also examined. This was a retrospective case study. Age, gender, and presence of dental risk factors were recorded from the patient medical history intake form. Dentate status was recorded from patient odontograms. Dental insurance status was obtained from billing records. Data was aggregated and deidentified. Descriptive and bivariate statistics and logistic regression models were used to identify associations (p-value â¤ 0.05 significance). Of 1,123 records meeting inclusion criteria, 52.54 percent of patients had dental insurance, 26.27 percent had at least one dental risk factor, and 18.17 percent were edentulous. Age and insurance status were significantly correlated with edentulism. Correcting for age, individuals without insurance were 1.56 times as likely to be edentulous. This case study provides insight into patient demographics that might seek care in a corporate setting and suggests that access to a dentist alone may not be adequate in preserving the adult dentition; dental insurance may also be important to health. As the corporate dental practice model continues to grow, these topics deserve further study.\n\nImplant-Retained Obturator for an Edentulous Patient with a Hemimaxillectomy Defect Complicated with Microstomia\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPatient. A 68-year-old man was operated on for squamous cell carcinoma (T3N3M0) of the maxilla creating the hemimaxillary surgical defect on right side. The remaining arch was completely edentulous. There was remarkable limitation in the oral opening with reduced perimeter of the oral cavity due to radiation and surgical scar contracture. This article describes prosthetic rehabilitation by modifying the design of the obturator and achieving the retention with dental implant. Discussion. Severe limitation in the oral opening may occur in clinical situations following the postsurgical management of oral and maxillofacial defects. The prosthetic rehabilitation of the surgical defect in such patients becomes a challenging task due to limited access to the oral cavity. This challenge becomes even more difficult if the patient is edentulous and there are no teeth to gain the retention, stability, and support. Conclusion. In severe microstomia prosthesis insertion and removal can be achieved with modification of the maximum width of the prosthesis. Dental implant retention is useful treatment option in edentulous patients with maxillary surgical defect provided that sufficient bone volume and accessibility are there for implant placement.

Besides, we will try to discuss among the different treatment options in such patients and to analyze their validity when ISOs are compared with other clinical modalities. At the same time, we will try to suggest clinical guidelines supported by current clinical studies. We performed a Medline search and review of pertinent articles on the mentioned subject from 1986 to 2011. As a searching strategy, we used the following words: implant-supported overdentures, attachment systems, Locator attachment, cantilever, fixed prosthesis. Implant-supported overdentures constitute an accurate and predictable treatment option and achieve a higher patients' satisfaction. This type of treatment constitutes a cheaper treatment than fixed prostheses and in some patients, with loss of lip support or with an interoclusal space larger than 15 mm, the choice of implant-supported overdentures seems to prevent future aesthetic or phonetic problems. Key words:Overdentures, implant occlusion, implant rehabilitation, total edentulous rehabilitation, fixed prosthesis.\n\nRehabilitation with implant-supported overdentures in total edentulous patients: A review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSegura-AndrÃ©s, Gustavo; Faus-LÃ³pez, Joan; AgustÃ­n-Panadero, RubÃ©n\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives: The main aim of this review article is to discuss implant-supported overdentures (ISOs) as treatment in edentulous patients.

Under some circumstances, it might be difficult to perform, such as in edentulous patients, due to inadequate mask seal. We developed a new device called NIPARA and studied its use For ventilation optimization in edentulous patients. This randomized controlled trial included edentulous adults who had no other predictors of difficult airway, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia. Patients were assigned either to the NIPARA device group or to the control group (oral airway only). The primary outcomes were peak inspiratory pressure and tidal volume values of the first 14 breaths. The secondary outcome was the incidence of complications. Data from 37 patients were collected during a one-year period (twenty in the NIPARA device group and 17 in the control group). The difference in mean PIP was not statistically significant. The tidal volume was 1.5 times greater in the NIPARA group than in the control group. One patient from the intervention group had minimal oral trauma. In the administration of face mask ventilation, NIPARA is an effective device that significantly improves the tidal volume administered in edentulous patients.\n\nDigital Workflow for Computer-Guided Implant Surgery in Edentulous Patients: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Ji-Hyeon; An, Xueyin; Jeong, Seung-Mi; Choi, Byung-Ho\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this article was to describe a fully digital workflow used to perform computer-guided flapless implant placement in an edentulous patient without the use of conventional impressions, models, or a radiographic guide. Digital data for the workflow were acquired using an intraoral scanner and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The image fusion of the intraoral scan data and CBCT data was performed by matching resin markers placed in the patient's mouth. The definitive digital data were used to design a prosthetically driven implant position, surgical template, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing fabricated fixed dental prosthesis. The authors believe this is the first published case describing such a technique in computer-guided flapless implant surgery for edentulous patients.

Although the aetiology of TMD has not been fully understood, in general it is considered to be multifactorial. The signs and symptoms of TMD which present in patients with natural teeth may also occur in edentulous patients. These symptoms may appear in various combinations and degrees. TMD has attained a prominent role within the context of dental care due to its high prevalence. The present paper is a review of the current literature on TMD in edentulous patients; with an attempt to propose a classification for the same.

Occlusal forces from the opposing natural teeth may cause fractures in the maxillary prosthesis and also result in advanced bone loss of the edentulous maxilla. With the presence of extreme gagging reflex, the treatment may become more complicated. This article describes and illustrates the 2-stage surgical and prosthetic treatment of a patient with an edentulous maxilla opposing natural teeth. In the beginning, the patient was treated with 4 implants and a maxillary implant-supported overdenture. The extreme gagging reflex and the occlusal forces from the mandibular natural teeth obligated the team a second stage surgical and prosthetic treatment, which included increasing the number of implants after bilateral sinus lifting in the posterior maxilla and fabricating a maxillary fixed hybrid prosthesis made of micro-ceramic composite that yielded a satisfactory result.\n\nTorus palatinus and torus mandibularis in edentulous patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl Quran, Firas A M; Al-Dwairi, Ziad N\n\n2006-05-01\n\nTo determine the prevalence of tori in Jordanian edentulous patients, the sex variation in their distribution, and their clinical characteristics. Three hundred and thirty eight patients were examined in the Prosthodontic Clinic in the Department of Restorative Dentistry at Jordan University of Science and Technology. The location, extent, and clinical presentation of tori were recorded related to the age and sex of patients. The overall prevalence of tori was 13.9%. The prevalence of torus palatinus was 29.8% (14/47), while that of torus mandibularis was significantly higher 42.6% (20/47). Both types of tori were associated with each other in 27.7% of cases (13/47). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of tori between males and females. There seems to be a strong association between mandibular and palatal tori.\n\nVariations in rest vertical dimension: effects of standing posture in edentulous patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nMakzoume, Joseph E\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe orientation of a patient's head changes, depending on whether he or she is sitting or standing in a relaxed upright position. An edentulous patient's vertical dimension at rest may show variations that can result in an inaccurate determination of his or her occlusal vertical dimension. This study recorded the rest vertical dimension (RVD) established among 60 totally edentulous subjects who were standing in the position of greatest comfort (self-balance position) and compared it with the patients' RVD when they were seated in a relaxed upright position, with the Frankfort Plane parallel to the horizontal. The RVD was measured (in mm) between two dots located on the midline of the face. Two measurements were made: one when the patient was seated upright and relaxed (with the Frankfort Plane parallel to the horizontal) with no head support, and the other when the patient was standing relaxed on both feet in a self-balance position. Five alternated measurements were made for each subject in each position. A mean RVD was calculated for each subject in each body posture and the mean values from both positions were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test (alpha = 0.05). No significant differences were noted between the RVD of the seated and standing positions (P = 0.67).\n\nA Technique for Digital Impression and Bite Registration for a Single Edentulous Arch.\n\nPubMed\n\nFang, Yiqin; Fang, Jing-Huan; Jeong, Seung-Mi; Choi, Byung-Ho\n\n2018-03-09\n\nFew studies have reported the application of digital technology for the process of impression and interocclusal recordings in edentulous patients. This article describes a digitizing system for generating digital edentulous models with a jaw relationship by taking direct digital impressions and a virtual bite registration using intraoral digital scanning. A specialized scan retractor was used to make digital impressions of edentulous jaws in patients' mouths using an intraoral scanner. Virtual bite registration was obtained with optical scanning of the buccal surfaces of both jaws at the occlusal vertical dimension. The registration was then used as a reference for aligning both jaws. Digital edentulous models that include the jaw relationship would be clinically beneficial for the fabrication of complete dentures in edentulous patients.

Several options have been used for implant-supported overdenture attachments. Among these, bar attachment system has greater retention and better maintainability than others. SFI-BarÂ® is prefabricated and can be adjustable at chairside. Therefore, laboratory procedures such as soldering and welding are unnecessary, which leads to fewer errors and lower costs. A 67-year-old female patient presented, complaining of mobility of lower anterior teeth with old denture. She had been wearing complete denture in the maxilla and removable partial denture in the mandible with severe bone loss. After extracting the teeth, two implants were placed in front of mental foramen, and SFI-BarÂ® was connected. A tube bar was seated to two adapters through large ball joints and fixation screws, connecting each implant. The length of the tube bar was adjusted according to inter-implant distance. Then, a female part was attached to the bar beneath the new denture. This clinical report describes two-implant-supported overdenture using the SFI-BarÂ® system in a mandibular edentulous patient.

A stone cast of an edentulous mandible with five implants was fabricated to serve as master cast (control) for both implant- and abutment-level impressions. Digital impressions (n = 10) were taken with an intraoral optical scanner (TRIOS, 3shape, Denmark) after connecting polymer scan bodies. For the conventional polyether impressions of the master cast, a splinted and a non-splinted technique were used for implant-level and abutment-level impressions (4 cast groups, n = 10 each). Master casts and conventional impression casts were digitized with an extraoral high-resolution scanner (IScan D103i, Imetric, Courgenay, Switzerland) to obtain digital volumes. Standard tessellation language (STL) datasets from the five groups of digital and conventional impressions were superimposed with the STL dataset from the master cast to assess the 3D (global) deviations. To compare the master cast with digital and conventional impressions at the implant level, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe's post hoc test was used, while Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for testing the difference between abutment-level conventional impressions. Significant 3D deviations (P < 0.001) were found between Group II (non-splinted, implant level) and control. No significant differences were found between Groups I (splinted, implant level), III (digital, implant level), IV (splinted, abutment level), and V (non-splinted, abutment level) compared with the control. Implant angulation up to 15Â° did not affect the 3D accuracy of implant impressions (P > 0.001). Digital implant impressions are as accurate as conventional implant impressions. The splinted, implant-level impression technique is more accurate than the non-splinted one for completely edentulous patients, whereas there was no difference in the accuracy\n\nRehabilitation strategies for partially edentulous-prosthodontic principles and current trends.\n\nPubMed\n\nD'Souza, Dsj; Dua, Parag\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe prosthetic considerations for treatment of partially edentulous patients involve evaluation of important aspects such as presence of certain functional or skeletal deficits, orientation of the occlusal plane, free-way space, size and location of edentulous areas, number, strategic location and quality of the likely abutment teeth, vertical dimension, and the type of occlusion. A comprehensive evaluation, multidisciplinary approach and a sequential treatment plan, worked out in harmony with the patient's perceptions are important factors to ensure a successful outcome.

Fully edentulous orally handicapped older adults have been neglected because removable acrylic dentures have been the classic therapy for complete edentulism but are only rehabilitative, not therapeutic. Not replacing missing teeth with stable dentures could prevent adequate food intake. Osseointegrated endosseous implants used as a therapeutic adjunct can reduce the problem of long-term bone resorption to less than 0.1 mm per year. Implant-borne prostheses substantially increase the overall health and quality of life of orally handicapped fully edentulous older adults. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-five edentulous adult patients scheduled for elective surgery were included in the study. After induction of anesthesia, two direct laryngoscopies were performed alternately using a standard-sized Macintosh curved blade (No. 4 for men and No. 3 for women) and smaller-sized Macintosh curved blade (No. 3 for men and No. 2 for women). During direct laryngoscopy with each blade, two digital photographs of the lateral view were taken when the blade tip was placed in the valleculae; the laryngoscope was lifted to achieve the best laryngeal view. Then, the best laryngeal views were assessed using the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score. On the photographs of the lateral view of direct laryngoscopy, the angles between the line extending along the laryngoscopic handle and the horizontal line were measured. The POGO score was improved with the smaller-sized blade compared with the standard-sized blade (87.3% [11.8%] vs. 71.3% [20.0%], P<0.001, respectively). The angles between the laryngoscopic handle and the horizontal line were greater with the smaller-sized blade compared to the standard-sized blade when the blade tip was placed on the valleculae and when the laryngoscope was lifted to achieve the best laryngeal view (both P<0.001). Compared to a standard-sized Macintosh blade, a smaller-sized Macintosh curved blade improved the laryngeal exposure in edentulous patients. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, restoring oral function of adult edentulous patients with ED using zygomatic implants (ZIs) or conventional implants (CIs) remains challenging for dentists because of the severe atrophy of these patients' alveolar ridges. This report describes 2 cases of adult edentulous siblings with ED; they exhibited severe alveolar bone atrophy and were treated with ZIs and CIs as bases to augment the bone in their anterior jaws. For these patients, bone augmentation was completed with an autogenous fibular graft. Although there was mild evidence of bone graft resorption in the maxilla, the bone augmentation procedures were successful in the 2 patients. Effective osseointegration of the implants was obtained. After placement, the functional and esthetic results of the oral rehabilitation were acceptable. More importantly, restoration of the patients' oral function enhanced their self-confidence and self-esteem. Therefore, restoring oral function in adult patients with ED and edentulous jaws using ZIs and CIs as the bases for bone augmentation is an effective approach. Crown Copyright Â© 2015.

This study aims to investigate rugae patterns in dentulous and edentulous patients of both sexes in South Indian population and to find whether palatoscopy is a useful tool in human identification. Four hundred outpatients from Sree Balaji Dental College and Hospital, Chennai, were included in the study. The study group was equally divided between the sexes, which was further categorized into 100 dentulous and edentulous patients, respectively. The edentulous male showed the highest mean of wavy pattern and total absence of circular pattern while the edentulous female group showed the highest mean of curved pattern and total absence of nonspecific pattern, while dentate population showed similar value as that of the overall population such as straight, wavy, and curved patterns. The present study concludes that there is similar rugae pattern of distribution between male and female dentate population while there is varied pattern between the sexes of edentulous population. However, the most predominant patterns were straight, wavy, and circular patterns.\n\nFace mask ventilation in edentulous patients: a comparison of mandibular groove and lower lip placement.\n\nPubMed\n\nRacine, StÃ©phane X; Solis, Audrey; Hamou, Nora Ait; Letoumelin, Philippe; Hepner, David L; Beloucif, Sadek; Baillard, Christophe\n\n2010-05-01\n\nIn edentulous patients, it may be difficult to perform face mask ventilation because of inadequate seal with air leaks. Our aim was to ascertain whether the \"lower lip\" face mask placement, as a new face mask ventilation method, is more effective at reducing air leaks than the standard face mask placement. Forty-nine edentulous patients with inadequate seal and air leak during two-hand positive-pressure ventilation using the ventilator circle system were prospectively evaluated. In the presence of air leaks, defined as a difference of at least 33% between inspired and expired tidal volumes, the mask was placed in a lower lip position by repositioning the caudal end of the mask above the lower lip while maintaining the head in extension. The results are expressed as mean +/- SD or median (25th-75th percentiles). Patient characteristics included age (71 +/- 11 yr) and body mass index (24 +/- 4 kg/m2). By using the standard method, the median inspired and expired tidal volumes were 450 ml (400-500 ml) and 0 ml (0-50 ml), respectively, and the median air leak was 400 ml (365-485 ml). After placing the mask in the lower lip position, the median expired tidal volume increased to 400 ml (380-490), and the median air leak decreased to 10 ml (0-20 ml) (P < 0.001 vs. standard method). The lower lip face mask placement with two hands reduced the air leak by 95% (80-100%). In edentulous patients with inadequate face mask ventilation, the lower lip face mask placement with two hands markedly reduced the air leak and improved ventilation.\n\nEpidemiological survey on edentulousness.\n\nPubMed\n\nReddy, N Simhachalam; Reddy, Nallala Amarendra; Narendra, R; Reddy, Sashi Deepth\n\n2012-07-01\n\nIndia has a large geriatric population of 77 millions, comprising 7.7% of its total population. One of the major handicaps in the elderly is loss of teeth, affecting their mastication, dietary intake and nutritional status. The present study was planned to assess the level of edentulousness, cause of edentulousness, denture wearing and denture needs of the middle and elderly in the society and study was correlated between habits and socioeconomic variables, diet and body mass index (BMI). A total of 500 subjects (random sampling) from dental outpatient were studied. A prepared questionnaire was developed, explained, interviewed and questions were filled personally. The level of edentulousness was found to be high in the subjects with low socioeconomic status and in advancing age with no significant difference between male and females. Another finding was very low level of denture wearing of 62% needing complete denture and partial denture only 10.4% of subjects wearing dentures. Mixed diet population had higher level of edentulousness compared with vegetarians. The BMI was correlated with level of edentulousness. The study clearly showed that there is lack of dental awareness, so dental education and motivation in very important. The study concludes that the need for prosthodontics care will increase due to the increase in life span. This study is clinically significant with regard to knowing the root cause of edentulism, either partial or complete. Out of 62% tooth loss, dental caries (37.4%) topped the cause for tooth loss followed by combination of dental caries and periodontal disease (12.2%).\n\nA Comparative Rugoscopic Study of the Dentate and Edentulous Individuals in the South Indian Population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRajguru, Jagdish Prasad; Somayaji, Nagaveni S.; Masthan, K.

To present a simple method that helps achieve a predictable aesthetic result when alveoplasty of the anterior maxilla is needed to place implants apical to the presurgical position of the alveolar ridge. The maximum smile line of the patient is recorded and carved on a thin silicone bite impression as a soft tissue landmark. During the three-dimensional radiographic examination, the patient wears the silicone guide loaded with radiopaque markers. The NobelClinicianÂ® software is then used to bring the hard and soft tissue landmarks together in a single reading. Using the software, a line is drawn 5 mm apical to the smile line; it dictates the position of the crestal ridge to be reached following the alveoplasty. Subsequently, the simulated implant position and the simulated residual bone height following alveoplasty can be simultaneously evaluated on each transverse section. An alveoplasty of the anterior maxilla was performed as simulated on the software, and implants were placed accordingly. The PSTJ was always under the upper lip, even during maximum smile events. The aesthetic result was, therefore, fully satisfactory. This simple method permits the placement of the PSTJ under the upper lip with a predictable outcome; it ensures a reliable aesthetic result for the edentulous patient with a gingival smile.

This retrospective clinical study involved patients with maxillary edentulism who were fitted with implant-supported overdentures from January 2004 to June 2007. During a 5- to 8-year follow-up period, the implant survival and success rates, biologic and mechanical complications, prosthodontic maintenance, and patient satisfaction were retrospectively analyzed. The data were evaluated statistically and P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Forty-four patients with maxillary edentulism received implant-supported removable overdentures. Twenty-one patients chose telescopic crown overdentures and 23 patients chose bar overdentures. A total of 41 patients and 201 implants were available for follow-up. The implant survival and success rates, average bone resorption, and subjective patient satisfaction scores showed no difference between the telescopic crown and the bar overdenture group at follow-up. However, there were higher values for Plaque and Calculus Indexes in the bar group compared with the telescopic crown group, and these values showed a statistically significant difference annually from the 3-year follow-up (P < .05). Each year, the number of prosthodontics maintenance procedures per patient did not significantly differ between the telescopic crown (approximately 0.36 to 0.58) and bar groups (approximately 0.30 to 0.49) (P = .16). Although there were higher plaque and calculus levels in the bar group and more maintenance was required for the telescopic crown group, overdentures provided a healthy peri-implant structure for implants in both groups. Implant-supported telescopic crown or bar overdentures can provide a good treatment option for patients with edentulous maxillae.\n\nEdentulism in high poverty rural counties.\n\nPubMed\n\nMitchell, Jordan; Bennett, Kevin; Brock-Martin, Amy\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo examine the differences in oral health status among residents of high-poverty counties, as compared to residents of other rural or urban counties, specifically on the prevalence of edentulism. We used the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the 2006 Area Resource File (ARF). All analyses were conducted with SAS and SAS-callable SUDAAN, in order to account for weighting and the complex sample design. Characteristics significantly related to edentulism include: geographic location, gender, race, age, health status, employment, insurance, not having a usual source of care, education, marital status, presence of chronic disease, having an English interview, not deferring care due to cost, income, and dentist saturation within the county. Significant associations between high-poverty rural and other rural counties and edentulism were found, and other socioeconomic and health status indicators remain strong predictors of edentulism.

Fourteen edentulous patients were randomly selected from the Department of Prosthodontics, at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, \"Victor Babes\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania. The changes that occurred in the lower third of the face after prosthodontic treatment were assessed quantitatively by measuring the vertical projection of the distances between two sets of anthropometric landmarks: Subnasale - cutaneous Pogonion (D1) and Labiale superius - Labiale inferius (D2). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA model design was carried out to test for significant interactions, main effects and differences between the two types of measuring devices and between the initial and final rehabilitation time points. The main effect of the type of measuring device showed no statistically significant differences in the measured distances (p=0.24 for D1 and p=0.39 for D2), between the initial and the final rehabilitation time points. Regarding the main effect of time, there were statistically significant differences in both the measured distances D1 and D2 (p=0.001), between the initial and the final rehabilitation time points. The two methods of measurement were equally reliable in the assessment of lower face morphology changes in edentulous patients after prosthodontic rehabilitation with bimaxillary complete dentures. The differences between the measurements taken before and after prosthodontic rehabilitation proved to be statistically significant.\n\nIndividual- and community-level social gradients of edentulousness.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Kanade; Aida, Jun; Yamamoto, Tatsuo; Ohtsuka, Rika; Nakade, Miyo; Suzuki, Kayo; Kondo, Katsunori; Osaka, Ken\n\n2015-03-11\n\nCommunity-level factors as well as individual-level factors affect individual health. To date, no studies have examined the association between community-level social gradient and edentulousness. The aim of this study was to investigate individual- and community-level social inequalities in edentulousness and to determine any explanatory factors in this association. We analyzed the data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES). In 2010-2012, 112,123 subjects aged 65 or older responded to the questionnaire survey (response rate = 66.3%). Multilevel logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the association between community-level income and edentulousness after accounting for individual-level income and demographic covariates. Then, we estimated the probability of edentulousness by individual- and community-level incomes after adjusted for covariates. Of 79,563 valid participants, the prevalence of edentulousness among 39,550 men (49.7%) and 40,013 women (50.3%) were both 13.8%. Living in communities with higher mean incomes and having higher individual-level incomes were significantly associated with a lower risk of edentulousness (odds ratios [ORs] by 10,000 USD increments were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.22-0.63]) for community-level and 0.85 (95% CI [0.84-0.86]) for individual-level income). Individual- and community-level social factors, including density of dental clinics, partially explained the social gradients. However, in the fully adjusted model, both community- and individual-level social gradients of edentulousness remained significant (ORs = 0.43 (95% CI [0.27-0.67]) and 0.90 (95% CI [0.88-0.91]), respectively). One standard deviation changes in community- and individual-level incomes were associated with 0.78 and 0.84 times lower odds of edentulousness, respectively. In addition, compared to men, women living in communities with higher average incomes had a significantly lower risk of edentulousness (p-value for\n\n[Systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of implant supported overdentures on the oral health related quality of life of edentulous patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, S S; Zhang, Y; Di, P; Lin, Y\n\n2017-05-09\n\nObjective: To evaluate the effect of implant related treatment on the oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) of edentulous patients. Methods: The CNKI, Wanfang database and Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases that include randomized clinical trials comparing implant supported overdentures with conventional complete denture for edentulous patients were retrived. Nine studies involving 769 cases were included and meta-analysis was conducted. Results: The standardized mean difference (SMD) of oral health impact profile (OHIP) score was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.25-2.02) and improved after implant related treatment, which was significantly better than the conventional complete denture (0.87, 95% CI: 0.54-1.20). Conclusions: Implant supported overdentures improved patient's OHRQoL and showed better performance compared to the overdentures complete dentures.\n\nA systematic review of implant outcomes in treated periodontitis patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSousa, Vanessa; Mardas, Nikos; Farias, Bruna; Petrie, Aviva; Needleman, Ian; Spratt, David; Donos, Nikolaos\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTo investigate the effect of treated periodontitis on implant outcomes in partially edentulous individuals compared with periodontally healthy patients. Longitudinal studies reporting on implant survival, success, incidence of peri-implantitis, bone loss and periodontal status, and on partially dentate patients with a history of treated periodontitis were included. The search yielded 14,917 citations. Twenty-seven publications met the inclusion criteria for qualitative data synthesis. Implant success and survival were higher in periodontally healthy patients, whilst bone loss and incidence of peri-implantitis was increased in patients with history of treated periodontitis. There was a higher tendency for implant loss and biological complications in patients previously presenting with severe forms of periodontitis. The strength of the evidence was limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of study design, population, therapy, unit of analysis, inconsistent definition of baselines and outcomes, as well as by the inadequate reporting of statistical analysis and accounting for confounding factors; thus, meta-analysis could not be performed. Implants placed in patients treated for periodontal disease are associated with higher incidence of biological complications and lower success and survival rates than those placed in periodontally healthy patients. Severe forms of periodontal disease are associated with higher rates of implant loss. However, it is critical to develop well-designed, long-term prospective studies to provide further substantive evidence on the association of these outcomes. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Clinical and radiographic parameters should be considered separately to make the right choice between an endodontically or periodontally compromised treated tooth and implant. Therefore, in order to decide whether the tooth is safe or not, data that have to be collected are specific parameters of both the patient and the clinician. In addition, the presence of periodontal, prosthetic, and orthodontic diseases requires patients to be set in multidisciplinary approach. The aim of this case report is to describe how the multidisciplinary approach could be the best way to manage difficult cases of implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. How to rehabilitate with fixed prosthesis on natural teeth and dental implants a smoker patient who presents with active periodontitis, multiple edentulous areas, dental malocclusion, and severe aesthetic problems was also described.

Although periodontal therapy was shown to improve periodontal health, it does not completely arrest the disease. Almost all subjects compliant with periodontal maintenance continue to experience progressive clinical attachment loss and a fraction of them loses teeth. An oral microbial transplant may be a new alternative for treating periodontitis (inspired by fecal transplant). First, it must be established that microbiomes of oral health and periodontitis are distinct. In that case, the health-associated microbiome could be introduced into the oral cavity of periodontitis patients. This relates to the goals of our study: (i) to assess if microbial communities of the entire oral cavity of subjects with periodontitis were different from or oral health contrasted by microbiotas of caries and edentulism patients; (ii) to test in vitro if safe concentration of sodium hypochlorite could be used for initial eradication of the original oral microbiota followed by a safe neutralization of the hypochlorite prior transplantation. Sixteen systemically healthy white adults with clinical signs of one of the following oral conditions were enrolled: periodontitis, established caries, edentulism, and oral health. Oral biofilm samples were collected from sub- and supra-gingival sites, and oral mucosae. DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA genes were amplified. Amplicons from the same patient were pooled, sequenced and quantified. Volunteer's oral plaque was treated with saline, 16Â mM NaOCl and NaOCl neutralized by ascorbate buffer followed by plating on blood agar. Ordination plots of rRNA gene abundances revealed distinct groupings for the oral microbiomes of subjects with periodontitis, edentulism, or oral health. The oral microbiome in subjects with periodontitis showed the greatest diversity harboring 29 bacterial species at significantly higher abundance compared to subjects with the other\n\nDual jaw treatment of edentulism using implant-supported monolithic zirconia fixed prostheses.\n\nPubMed\n\nAltarawneh, Sandra; Limmer, Bryan; Reside, Glenn J; Cooper, Lyndon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis case report describes restoration of the edentulous maxilla and mandible with implant supported fixed prostheses using monolithic zirconia, where the incisal edges and occluding surfaces were made of monolithic zirconia. Edentulism is a debilitating condition that can be treated with either a removable or fixed dental prosthesis. The most common type of implant-supported fixed prosthesis is the metal acrylic (hybrid), with ceramo-metal prostheses being used less commonly in complete edentulism. However, both of these prostheses designs are associated with reported complications of screw loosening or fracture and chipping of acrylic resin and porcelain. Monolithic zirconia implant-supported fixed prostheses have the potential for reduction of such complications. In this case, the CAD/CAM concept was utilized in fabrication of maxillary and mandibular screw-retained implant-supported fixed prostheses using monolithic zirconia. Proper treatment planning and execution coupled with utilizing advanced technologies contributes to highly esthetic results. However, long-term studies are required to guarantee a satisfactory long-term outcome of this modality of treatment. This case report describes the clinical and technical procedures involved in fabrication of maxillary and mandibular implant-supported fixed prostheses using monolithic zirconia as a treatment of edentulism, and proposes the possible advantages associated with using monolithic zirconia in eliminating dissimilar interfaces in such prostheses that are accountable for the most commonly occurring technical complication for these prostheses being chipping and fracture of the veneering material.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to substantiate construct validity. To date, the model proposed by Locker has been tested on edentulous elders using structural equation model (SEM) analysis. However, cross-sectional designs and the Short-Form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) cannot adequately express cause-effect relationships and distribution in edentulous patients. Accordingly, the authors investigated Locker's model using an interventional design that included complete denture replacement using the OHIP for edentulous subjects (OHIP-EDENT). A total of 265 edentulous participants who visited the Dental Hospital of Tokyo Medical and Dental University (Tokyo, Japan) for new complete dentures were recruited. Locker's model was investigated, and CFA was performed using the change in subscale scores in the Japanese version of the OHIP-EDENT before and after complete denture replacement. CFA demonstrated an excellent model fit after adding several covariates. The Locker model also met the criteria of fit in all indices after 1 nonsignificant path was omitted. All path coefficients were significant. The findings of the present interventional study demonstrated an empirical fit to Locker's model in edentulous elders using SEM analysis, which included complete denture replacement. It is anticipated that clarification of causal mechanisms of oral health-related quality of life will lead to improvement of overall quality of life, thus maintaining or improving the activities of normal daily life for edentulous elders.

The purpose of this study was to find out the frequency of partial edentulism, its arch distribution status, awareness to restore, and the ratio of removable to fixed prosthesis among a student sample aged 18-25Â years. The methodology selected was a questionnaire survey followed by clinical examination of the student community from Tirur taluk, Malappuram district, Kerala. The results showed that the frequency of partial edentulism among the surveyed group was significant with predominance in maxillary posterior edentulousness in men and mandibular posterior edentulousness in women. Though there was not any significant gender difference in the partial edentulism, women were more aware than men to restore it. All restored cases were with fixed bridges and no anterior edentulousness was found. The study also revealed a lack of awareness and need to educate the population.\n\nPartial Edentulism and its Correlation to Age, Gender, Socio-economic Status and Incidence of Various Kennedy's Classes- A Literature Review.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeyapalan, Vidhya; Krishnan, Chitra Shankar\n\n2015-06-01\n\nPartial edentulism, one or more teeth missing is an indication of healthy behaviour of dental practices in the society and attitude towards dental and oral care.

In this study, we report a novel method for the reduction of the edentulous mandible fracture, via fabrication of modified Gunning splints using existing dentures and SMARTLock hybrid arch bars. This technique dramatically simplifies the application of an arch bar to dentures, obviates the need for the fabrication of impressions and custom splints, and eliminates the lag time associated with the creation of splints. Furthermore, this method may be used with or without adjunctive rigid internal fixation. The technique described herein of creating Gunning splints with SMARTLock hybrid arch bars provides surgeons with a simple, rapid, single-stage solution for reduction of mandibular fractures in the edentulous patient.

Rehabilitative treatment is only successful when patients are motivated and aware of correct prosthesis use and hygiene. Questionnaires were distributed to 150 complete denture users at the Federal University of Bahia School of Dentistry, the Esmeralda Natividade Health Center, the Bahian Science Development Foundation and a Salvador nursing home. The questionnaire included information on gender, age, length of prosthesis use, cleaning methods and materials, etc. The data were analysed using EpiInfo version 6 software. The chi-squared test was used for statistical analysis, with a significance level of 5%. Questionnaire results showed that 78% of the subjects, with an average age of 67.3 years, had used the same complete denture for over 5 years. 64% slept with their prostheses and 44% removed them from the mouth only for cleaning. None of the patients interviewed knew anything about brushes designed specifically for complete dentures. 37.3% had a restricted diet and 44% believed that a complete denture would last for more than 10 years. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the edentulous patients surveyed had limited awareness of prosthetic hygiene and long-term oral care despite extended periods of denture use.\n\nFunctional benefits of implants placed during ablative surgery: A 5-year prospective study on the prosthodontic rehabilitation of 56 edentulous oral cancer patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nWetzels, Jan Willem; Koole, Ron; Meijer, Gert J; de Haan, Anton F J; Merkx, Matthias A W; Speksnijder, Caroline M\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe timing of placement as well as the functional benefit of interforaminal implants in edentulous patients treated for oral cancer is unclear. Fifty-six patients were recruited at 2 institutions. In 1 institution, interforaminal implants were placed during ablative surgery, the other institution used conventional prosthodontics with optional placement of implants postsurgery (postponed-placement). Masticatory performance, bite force, and subjective masticatory function were assessed before and 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery. Implant-retained overdentures (IODs) demonstrated the highest bite force and the least problems with solid food and food choice. Masticatory performance was equal for IODs and conventional dentures. After 5 years, IODs from patients in the during-ablative-surgery cohort tend to have higher bite force and masticatory performance than those from patients in the postponed-placement cohort. IODs produce the highest overall masticatory function. Implant placement during ablative surgery seems to be functionally beneficial. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E2103-E2111, 2016.

The trend toward tissue-integrated prostheses has been a monumental step in restoring edentulous patients to function; however, this treatment can be out of reach for those who fail to qualify or those who do not have sufficient resources to afford it. In these cases, conventional dentures remain an important primary course of treatment. Attention to detail when diagnosing, treatment planning, and performing treatment for these patients is still a prime consideration for the best possible outcome. In particular, many experienced denture wearers are afflicted with chronically inflamed denture-bearing mucosa. Clinicians must recognize the need for tissue conditioning, choices of impression materials, and accepted fabrication techniques that can have favorable outcomes when matched with patients who are philosophical and realistic in their expectations. The purpose of this article is to review impression philosophies, associated materials, and methods of tissue conditioning. Retention and stability of the denture bases can be augmented by the routine use of denture adhesive, and indications for use of denture adhesive will be discussed.\n\nEdentulism and quality of life among older Ghanaian adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nHewlett, Sandra A; Yawson, Alfred E; Calys-Tagoe, Benedict N L; Naidoo, Nirmala; Martey, Pamela; Chatterji, Somnath; Kowal, Paul; Mensah, George; Minicuci, Nadia; Biritwum, Richard B\n\n2015-04-09\n\nEdentulism affects the quality of life and general health of an individual. But in ageing individuals, it has been observed to have greater impact, manifesting in functional, psychological and social limitations. With an increasing older adult population in Ghana, its burden is likely to increase. This study was thus carried out to explore the association between edentulism and quality of life among older Ghanaian adults. Secondary analysis of WHO's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 in Ghana was conducted using self-reported edentulism as the dependent variable. Participants included a nationally representative sample of adult's aged 50 years and older living in Ghana. Quality of life was measured using the 8 item WHOQOL measure and a single item measure which was a question \"How would you rate your overall quality of life?\". To assess the association between edentulism and the independent variables, a bivariate analysis was carried out. A Poisson regression model was then performed, adjusting for age, sex, income, education and the diagnosis of a chronic disease condition. A Spearman's correlation analysis was also carried out between the single and multi item measure of quality of life to assess how well they correlate. Edentulism was observed to be associated with significantly lower levels of SWB among older adults using both the single-item and multiple-item measure (WHOQOL). It, however, showed no association with happiness. Among edentulous respondents, females and those with no formal education reported significantly lower quality of life. The WHOQOL correlated positively and strongly with the single-item measure. Edentulism may not be life threatening and yet it has been shown to have a negative effect on the quality of life of older adult Ghanaians. More emphasis may thus need to be placed on the oral health of the aging population in Ghana to avoid it.\n\nOcclusal plane location in edentulous patients: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nShetty, Sanath; Zargar, Nazia Majeed; Shenoy, Kamalakanth; Rekha, V\n\n2013-09-01\n\nOcclusal plane orientation is an important factor in the construction of a complete denture.

Ageing, trauma, tooth loss and neuromuscular disorders have a high impact on tonicity of facial musculature, elasticity of skin as well as function of muscles. Patients affected with Bellâs palsy face functional, aesthetic as well as psychological impairment. Common problems are the partial closure of upper eyelid, sagging of lower eyelid and drooping of angle of mouth leading to facial asymmetry, along with difficulty in eating, drinking and speaking. The key to aesthetic restoration is to support and harmonize the collapsed facial musculature with the help of various prosthodontic treatment approaches.

The aims of this study were to investigate the ridge contour anterior to the nasopalatine canal, and the difference between the incidences of the nasopalatine canal perforation in dentate and partially edentulous patients by cone-beam computed tomography. Methods. Cone-beam computed tomography scan images from 72 patients were selected from database and divided into dentate and partially edentulous groups. The configuration of the ridge anterior to the canal including palatal concavity depth, palatal concavity height, palatal concavity angle, bone height coronal to the incisive foramen, and bone width anterior to the canal was measured. A virtual implant placement procedure was used, and the incidences of perforation were evaluated after implant placement in the cingulum position with the long axis along with the designed crown. Results. Comparing with variable values from dentate patients, the palatal concavity depth and angle were greater by 0.9 mm and 4Â°, and bone height was shorter by 1.1 mm in partially edentulous patients, respectively. Bone width in edentulous patients was narrower than in dentate patients by 1.2 mm at incisive foramen level and 0.9 mm at 8 mm subcrestal level, respectively. After 72 virtual cylindrical implants (4.1 Ã 12 mm) were placed, a total of 12 sites (16.7%) showed a perforation and three-fourths occurred in partially edentulous patients. After replacing with 72 tapered implants (4.3 Ã 13 mm), only 6 implants (8.3%) broke into the canal in the partially edentulous patient group. Conclusions. The nasopalatine canal may get close to the implant site and the bone width anterior to the canal decreases after the central incisor extraction. The incidence of nasopalatine canal perforation may occur more commonly during delayed implant placement in central incisor missing patients.
