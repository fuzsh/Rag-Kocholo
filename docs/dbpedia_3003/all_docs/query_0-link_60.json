This document provides a summary of a 187-page report examining the feasibility of using photovoltaic solar power systems to help rebuild Iraq's electrical infrastructure. The report begins by analyzing Iraq's current infrastructure needs and the coalition's reconstruction efforts to date. It then reviews examples of successful solar power implementations in the U.S., Australia, Mexico, and South Africa to identify best practices. Finally, the report proposes several solar power system configurations for Iraq and considers their technical requirements, security vulnerabilities, and potential benefits. The overall goal is to provide decision-makers with information to determine if solar power should be included in reconstruction plans.",
