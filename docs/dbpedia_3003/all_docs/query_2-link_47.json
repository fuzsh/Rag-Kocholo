        "text": "PREP BASKETBALL: Rebibo siblings help lead Conquistadores teams to City finals appearances.\n\nEven when David Rebibo was uncertain if his players were listening to his instructions, he knew his sister, Sarah, always was.\n\nWhen the El Camino Real of Woodland Hills boys’ basketball coach questioned whether his student-athletes were willing to make the necessary sacrifices in order to build a winning program, Sarah continued to follow her older brother’s advice by spending extra hours shooting in the gym.\n\nAnd while junior J.T. Nemit has developed into a talented point guard for the Conquistadores, 26-year-old David’s biggest influence has been in helping Sarah, 17, play the position with passion and tenacity the past four seasons for the girls’ varsity team.\n\nAs a result, the Rebibo family will have an opportunity to lead ECR to a pair\n\nof City Section basketball championships this weekend at Roybal Learning Center.\n\nThe Conquistadores, who captured the Invitational girls’ title in 2008, will take on West Valley League rival Granada Hills in the Div. II final at 6 p.m. today.\n\nECR, which hasn’t won a City boys’ basketball championship at any level in at least three decades – according to school records – and possibly since the school opened in 1969, will face Verdugo Hills of Tujunga in the Div. III title game at 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\n“It’s always been an unspoken goal of ours,” David Rebibo said. “But when the playoffs started, I challenged Sarah to get her team to the championship. And in a lot of ways, she came after me and challenged me to get my team to the championship game as well. We’re each other’s biggest fans, but right now, for both of us, it’s all business because we’re focused on competing for a City title.”\n\nDespite humble beginnings at ECR for David and Sarah – the oldest and youngest among four siblings, along with Jason, 24, and Evan, 18 – that focus hasn’t wavered in their attempt to have the Conquistadores recognized in the City Section for more than just their baseball, soccer, tennis and softball programs.\n\nSarah was one of four freshmen starting on varsity when ECR finished 8-19 in 2006-07.\n\nBut with the nucleus of Brooke Amenta, Amanda Popish, Bahar Rohani, Dani Rosenthal, Marie Umeda and Rebibo, the Conquistadores won the Invitational crown as sophomores and reached the City Div. I quarterfinals last year, before capturing their first West Valley League championship since 1999 this season.\n\n“It’s always been soccer that was winning City and basketball has never been up there,” Sarah Rebibo said. “It was our goal to get to that level, to be up at the top with them. It has definitely been a struggle because we had a lot to prove. But we wanted to show that we are the best and we can beat the best.”\n\nWith injuries and illness sidelining six of its top eight players in December, ECR girls’ coach Raquel Alotis was forced to submit to City officials the Conquistadores’ intent to compete in the Div. II playoffs instead of Div. I, uncertain as to when, or if, they would return in time for the postseason.\n\nThe lack of personnel led to some frustrating early season results for Alotis and her players.\n\n“It’s been an emotional roller coaster with so many ups and downs and it definitely takes its toll, but right now we’re at a high point on the roller coaster,” Sarah Rebibo said.\n\n“I definitely had to step up and after going through that, it made me appreciate my teammates so much more. I have complete trust in them and I don’t have any doubt they’ll be there for me.”\n\nThanks to Sarah Rebibo’s leadership and the development of sophomores Shannon Kingery and Alexis Tanner, along with freshman Cora Chan, the top-seeded Conquistadores (22-7) have won 12 of 14 entering the final, including a pair of victories over Granada Hills.\n\n“The last two years, her maturity and leadership have completely blossomed. Sarah is double the player mentally and physically that she was last year,” Alotis said. “It takes a real unique and special individual to play the position and she’s been doing it since she was a freshman, which has allowed us to mold her into our system and our program. She’s led this team for four years and she’s led by example and it’s been fantastic.”\n\nAlthough David Rebibo posted a9-20 record in his first season in 2007-08, he has orchestrated a turnaround the past two years, leading ECR to 15 victories and a second-round playoff appearance last season.\n\nAlthough the Conquistadores (16-13) suffered through a stretch of five consecutive losses in January, ECR has rebounded to win eight of 10, with the only two losses coming against City Div. I finalist Taft of Woodland Hills.\n\n“This is one of the most talented teams I’ve ever coached, but talented individuals can’t win games. Talented teams will always beat talented individuals and something finally clicked with them,” David Rebibo said.\n\n“All the credit goes to the guys. They finally bought in to what we’ve been talking about all along. And I think seeing that also sparked a fire in Sarah to get her going to lead her team to the finals.”\n\nAnd Rebibo has responded, rebounding from a one-point effort Feb. 5 in a 64-52 loss to Chatsworth to score in double figures four of the past five games. The 5-foot-5 standout leads ECR in scoring (11.8 points per game), assists (2.7) and steals (1.6).\n\n“If we’d lose, my brother would always know the right thing to say, so if I didn’t have him around, things would definitely be a lot harder. Having that support system really means a lot,” Sarah Rebibo said. “My brother’s heart is really into coaching, so if he loses, I can relate to how he feels. He prepares his teams really well, and in the playoffs, it all starts with coaching, so I know they’ll be in a position to win.”\n\nDavid’s tireless work ethic, both in preparing his team and spending hours after practice refining Sarah’s game, has the ECR basketball program on the verge of school history.\n\n“There’s basketball talent everywhere in the valley, so I’ve always said `Why not El Camino? Why not now? And why not us?”‘ David Rebibo said. “That would obviously be a great legacy to leave behind.”"
