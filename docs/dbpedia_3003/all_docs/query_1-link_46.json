I will 100% be jealous of the person who gets this role although I'll channel it into unwavering support! Here's a bit about the role (link to apply below and DM me with any questions!): About the Company: ðŸŽˆ Draftboard is a marketplace where companies publicly post what they'll pay if someone successfully refers them a new hire and Scouts (referrers) compete to earn that referral bonus by scouring their networks for the best talent they know. ðŸŽˆ They're a well funded startup with a really incredible team (I do not say this lightly) of ~10. About the role: âœ¨ Draftboard is a double sided marketplace, and you'd be playing an incredibly integral role in building up one of the two sides (the scouts). âœ¨ You'll be responsible for identifying and building relationships with super connectors and engaging them in using Draftboard to help people in their network get jobs (and help them get paid for it!) âœ¨ I have a feeling the person for this role is already doing this as their hobby and will totally get it when they see it. They cant help themselves but send job postings to friends and they feel like getting paid to do that would be a dream. âœ¨ The role ties together online community management, marketing, social media savvy and sales so your day will be interesting and dynamic and your network will grow tenfold along the way When I think about this job, I think about people who aspire to be like/or are already...
