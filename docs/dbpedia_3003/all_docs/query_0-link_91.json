Fireworks: JULY 3RD & 4TH Visit: NJFAIR.COM SUPPORTED IN PART BY A GRANT FROM the NEW JERSEY DEPartment OF STATE, DIVISION OF TRAVEL & TOURISM Free Entertainment: JUNE 23to JULY 10 Local JS-16 16 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 Why it matters to be gay and Jewish Lawyer-turned-historian Rachel Tiven looks at Harvey Milk and Ed Koch for Pride Shabbat in Livingston JOANNE PALMER Ed Koch was a Jewish guy from Manhattan; he was born in 1924, grew up in Newark, and became mayor of New York City in 1978. Harvey Milk was a Jewish guy from Long Island; he was born in 1930 and became San Francisco City Supervisor in 1978. Both men were gay; Mr. Milk openly, Mr. Koch not. Mr. Milk died by assassin’s bullet in 1978; Mr. Koch died in 2013, of natural causes. Their similarities and differences are fascinating (and heartrending). Rachel Tiven, a lawyer who’s worked at nonprofits advocating for immigration and LGBTQ rights, and now is well into a doctorate program in history at CUNY Graduate Center, will talk about them as part of an in-person and streamed Shabbat service for Gay Pride month at Temple B’nai Abraham in Livingston. (See box.) Ms. Tiven talked about why she made the move from activism to history, and how one informs and supports the other. “In a roundabout way, I came to realize that I really needed to zoom further out to understand why this place is the way it is,” she said. “I had been looking very close up for a long time, and trying to make it better, but the way we are stuck now requires looking a little further back.” There’s a great advantage to going back to school in your 40s, she added; you can use what you’ve learned about the world and yourself to figure out where your skills and natural intellectual inclinations fit best. “In college” — Harvard — “I concentrated in comparative religion and English,” Ms. Tiven said. “In retrospect, I probably should have concentrated in history, but I didn’t understand it, the way you don’t understand when you’re 18. “You can study the same topics, but the difference is methodology. I was interested in understanding how religion and culture shaped the United States. Now I know that for me, the best approach is using primary documents. And I get to do it again.” Ms. Tiven is passionate about her work; as she talks about history, and her new ability to study the documents that bring it to life, her intensity blazes. Although she’ll talk about two men at B’nai Abraham, “most of my work is about women, and about women’s long search for full citizenship in the United States, to have responsibility both politically and economically,” Ms. Tiven said. “A lot of my work is about the women’s suffrage movement, and how women took no power and nurtured it into power. “We still really don’t understand enough how what I call the largest nonviolent revolution in American history happened. It resulted in more power for more people, without violence, at least from the women.” Ms. Tiven doesn’t know why the American suffragists chose to be nonviolent, while their counterparts in England made a different choice. “There is a tradition of class-based political violence in the UK, and women used it as a tactic. They thought the tradeoffs inherent in using it were worth it. It was a very considered decision. They threw rocks and burned down buildings. “American suffragists knew that violence was available as a tactic, but they chose not to use it. That was a very considered decision. It’s fascinating.” Her dissertation will be the political history of the 19th Amendment, which allowed women to vote. The amendment, ratified in 1920, reads, in its entirely: “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” We know the general public history about the amendment’s passage and ratification — we know which legislators voted for it, and when — but we do not know the smaller details, the private motivations and conversations and conversions, that led them there. That’s what a historian gets to unearth. “Why did men ultimately agree to dilute their own power by half?” Ms. Tiven asked. “Political theory says that usually you agree to give up power either because it is in your interest to do so — the Republican party backed the enfranchisement of Black men because they wanted their votes — or if the cost of continuing to resist is too high. “Most of the suffragist history we have is about what the suffragists did and how and why they did it, but we don’t have a lot about it from the perspective of the allwhite, all-male legislators who were the only ones in position to decide.” Relatively few historians have studied women’s suffrage, Ms. Tiven said. “There are an estimated 100,000 books written about the Civil War, and maybe between 100 and 300 about women’s suffrage.” What we do know is that the northern states were in favor, “the Deep South states were dead set against it, but the border states were movable. “It passed in Tennessee by one vote. Its passage was not a foregone conclusion. It passed by a hair.” When it comes to deep, legislated social change, the tactics matter, but the human motivations are both less accessible and more telling. “You can ask me how we won marriage equality, and I could tell you what we did,” Ms. Tiven said; she was active in that fight. “But if you want to ask me what worked, you have to ask the people whose minds were changed.” That brings her to her talk at B’nai Ed Koch in 1988; he still was mayor then.

Store) The Torah parasha on that Shabbat is Beha’alotecha, when the Israelites, for a change, complain, and Aaron and Miriam criticize their brother Moshe “for his choice of wife and the way he manages his personal life,” Ms. Tiven said. “What happens when a leader has complaining followers and your closest intimates criticize your choices about your personal life? “That will be the frame for the discussion of Harvey Milk and Ed Koch. “I will talk about the relevance of being gay and Jewish,” Ms. Tiven said. “Why is it important? Listing great gay Jews is like the opposite of listing great Jews in sports. You could do a very long book about great gay Jews. But why is it meaningful? “The question that interests me is about the role of a leader. To whom are you accountable? Koch had the good fortune to live a long time; their lives are comparable up until the point where Milk’s ends. “Milk was totally out; two good biographies of him say that he left New York intentionally, to move someplace freer and more embracing. San Francisco always was more gay than New York. “And San Francisco is much much smaller. The voting base there is a tiny fraction of New York’s. If you want to be mayor of New York, you have to cater to a lot a lot a lot of people. There are a lot of voters in San Francisco, but not nearly as wide a swath.” Ms. Tiven talked about a recent piece in the New York Times, “The Secrets Ed Koch Carried,” “which gave us not so much a confirmation that he was gay — everyone knew that — but that he was lonely. I don’t know if you could call what he felt was regret, but it shows the tradeoffs.” Those two men were “figures who came of age during and immediately after the war, shaped by the American Jewish midcentury consciousness. It shaped them in ways that are highly constitutive of American Judaism. “What does it matter to us as Jews? Why are we interested in identifying them as Jews? As gay? Why does it matter to us that someone is gay and Jewish?” Those are “substantive questions,” Ms. Tiven said. “And I hope that we will have substantive answers.” Who: Rachel Tiven What: Will talk about Harvey Milk, Ed Koch, and being gay and Jewish in mid 20th-century America When: At Shabbat services on Friday, June 17, at 6:30 Where: Live at Temple B’nai Abraham in Livingston and online on the synagogue’s website, tbanj.org; just click on the “streaming” link at the top.

Others may not need assistance until they are hospitalized. “There can be a medical emergency, and the family needs someone to be with the parent in the hospital and to help facilitate the discharge process,” Ms. Beth-Halachmy said. “We also help people transition from independent living to having a caregiver in the home or moving to a nursing home.” Kaila Wruble Shimshak, who grew up in West Orange and made aliyah from Teaneck in 2008, is a licensed social worker who worked with the National Jewish Council for Disabilities as well as at a nursing home and a psychiatric rehabilitation treatment program in New Jersey. She has been a B’Lev Shalem care manager for five years. “This service provides a level of comfort and reassurance that family members who are very far away do not have,” Ms. Shimshak said. “Knowing that someone is close by and checking in on their loved ones is the number-one reason. Number two is they know their parents are being well taken care of or well advised, depending on their needs. Some need only guidance, because they are not as familiar with services here. “Language plays a big part in the dayto-day managing of care in Israel, and I always make sure my clients go to doctors who speak English. But they may need assistance to converse with a pharmacist or nurse at the health clinic, and they depend on us to help with that.” Deena Forman Schechterman, who grew up in Teaneck and made aliyah in 2001 with a master’s degree in social work, is one of B’Lev Shalem’s newest care managers. It feels rewarding to “help people feel more independent and empowered, and to advocate for themselves with a little assistance,” Ms. Schechterman said.

All proceeds from the sale will be dedicated to JFNNJ’s fund to aid victims of the war in Ukraine. The fund provides housing, food, medicine, clothing, security, and transportation and other humanitarian aid to refugees. Holocaust survivor and artist Herb Stern grew up in Germany. Shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938, after a harrowing brush with the Gestapo, the family fled Germany and settled in Washington Heights. While the immediate family survived, the Sterns left behind grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. After graduating from Bronx High School of Science in 1948, Mr. Stein attended the New York Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, where he trained to be a graphic designer, working mainly as creative director for Ziff-Davis Publishing until he retired in 1999. In the early 1960s, he took painting and printmaking courses at the Art Center of Northern New Jersey, working in watercolor, oil, and acrylics, and learning the skills of silkscreen, etching, and lithography. Today, at 91, he continues to work in painting, printmaking, and Judaica papercuts and has exhibited in many solo and group shows throughout New York and Bergen County. As a survivor, Mr. Stein has a special empathy for victims of war and political strife. This is what prompted him to approach the leaders of his synagogue, Kol HaNeshamah, and the federation to propose mounting an exhibition of his work dedicated to Ukrainian relief. The solo exhibition running through the end of June, will include prints, watercolors, and papercuts. A meet-the-artist reception will be at the library on Thursday, June 23, at 6:30 p.m. All displayed items will be available for sale either at the reception or online up until June 30. All proceeds will go toward the JFNNJ’s fund for Ukrainian relief. For information, email: [email protected] or call (201) 816-1611.

How straightforwardly wonderful that sounds. Camp is starting again! Every summer at camp is brand new, fresh, and sparkling, and every camper is excited, eager, and incapable of homesickness. And will never be bitten by a mosquito. And will never get bored or whiny. And every counselor will be a teenage saint. Let’s try again. Camp is starting again. It’s thrilling and it’s also scary. It’s been a hard year, after a hard summer last year and an even harder year before it. Kids and counselors and staff come with both hope and history. Camps in general — and the New Jersey Y Camps, the focus of this story, in particular — are looking forward to the start of the summer with both joy and a real understanding of the challenges they face. “Last summer was a really positive experience for the kids, but it was really challenging for the adults,” Michael Schlank, the Jersey Y Camps’ CEO, said. “We really wanted to get kids back to camp, and it was really successful. Our staff worked probably as hard as they ever have worked in their entire lives, but it’s what they really love doing. “Still, it was a really hard summer.” Many of us are adrift in a sea of timelessness, but sometimes hard numbers help. Last summer, the summer of 2021, saw most kids back at camp, but in fairly impermeable bubbles. No one could go in or out of camp. They got to camp after a school year spent either entirely onscreen alone at home, or from a masked, socially distanced school. The virus was an unchecked threat then; vaccines, remember, weren’t widely available to adults until the beginning of 2021, and kids between 12 and 15 couldn’t get them until May of that year. They weren’t available to 5- to 11-year-olds until November 2021, seven months ago. This year’s been closer to normal at school, but still odd, and there has been a great deal of pent-up anxiety. Some kids have been acting out. We are not just a camp, but a Jewish camp. We are not just a community, we are a kehilla. We create a place where we live our Jewish values every day. These happy — and exhausted — campers are at the color war finale at Cedar Lake last summer. ALL PHOTOS FROM SUMMER 2021. COURTESY NEW JERSEY Y CAMPS Last year, Mr. Schlank said, “we had a group of kids who for the most part hadn’t spent significant time in groups with other children for almost two years, and there were a lot of small and sometimes big issues that reared their heads. That was true for staff also. “The thing about camp is that some of them went from zero, from just being at home, to being with 1,500 other people. “That was a challenge.” And then there were supply chain issues, and behind everything the question of how to deal with this still mysterious virus. But still, it was an uplifting summer, Mr. Schlank said. “By the end of the summer, everyone who got to participate in it felt both tired and privileged. I know I felt that. “Spending all the time we did working with each other and with the children was what we had been looking forward to. It was enormously rewarding.” All in all, he said, “warts and all, it ended up being a fantastic summer.” “From the New Jersey Y’s perspective, it was an important milestone.” The system’s centennial should have been in 2020, but that’s when the camps were closed, so “this was the system’s 100th summer, and we got to do what we love to do,” he said. From the financial side — because although the camps are nonprofit, they must bring in enough money, including from donors, to stay afloat — this has been a surprisingly successful year. The camps are prospering, and enrollment is way up this summer. “It’s enormous,” Mr. Schlank said. “The agency is probably in as good a position as it has been, certainly for the last generation, and going back as far as anyone can remember.” The camps survived a financial scandal a few years ago, but a new board came in and cleaned it up. Now, that board has transitioned out and a new one has taken over. “The transition has been really healthy,” Mr. Schlank said. The outgoing board chair, Steve Seiden, handed the job over to Suzanne Albin Tucker; both of them are active members of the MetroWest and larger Jewish communities. “From a governance place, we are super healthy,” Mr. Schlank continued. “We have done some reorganization at the staff level, and the narrative in the community is that NJ Y Camps are where you want to be if you’re a Jewish kid, and where you want to send your kid if you’re a Jewish family.” Philanthropy has done well, too; Cover Story JS-23 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 23 These Cedar Lake campers are having fun beading.

Grants and fundraising have brought in new sources of income for new projects. “We are really proud that we got a Yedid Nefesh grant from the Foundation for Jewish Camp, so we can bring in another mental health expert,” Mr. Schlank said. “This is a multiyear, yearlong program that allows for training and support for someone who will be focused on mental health, particularly at the teen level. We have another grant that will allow us to provide help in similar ways to the staff. “We have recognized that mental health is as important as physical health. We want to be able to de-stigmatize it, to talk about it openly. Just as we have doctors and nurses, we have mental health experts. We believe that we are in the forefront of thinking and talking about mental health issues in a way that makes everyone comfortable.” Staff training protocols “are being formed almost from the day that we leave camp the summer before,” Mr. Schlank said. “It goes on all year round. We have outside consultants who work on it all year round, and we start training our staff in the spring, and it runs all the way through our senior staff training, in the first week of June. “Part and parcel and integral to who we are is making sure that every member of our staff, whether they are counselors or caretakers or work in the kitchen or at the pool, feels that they are in a safe space, that camp is JS-24 24 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 CALL SAM FRIED (203) 253 3635 GOLDREFINER.COM 275 ROUTE 4 WEST PARAMUS, NJ (PARAMUS JEWELERS EXCHANGE) 24 0 LACROC TURNPIE FAIRFIELD, CT WE ARE BUYING!

Whatever the issue — sexual abuse or social-emotional health or whatever — we are being proactive in trying to create a community that does not tolerate abusive behavior. “Sometimes things happen; we are prepared and trained to deal with them. We have procedures and policies in place, and we have training to create a community in which those behaviors are not tolerated, and where people can share if they feel that they are feeling unsafe physically, psychologically, or emotionally.” Staffing levels are another vast improvement from last summer. Then, not only was it hard to recruit North Americans, because of covid, but also camps were not allowed to hire the overseas workers — other than Israelis — upon whom camp generally depends. They were able to bring in Israelis, though, “and we learned how successful we can be with our Israeli staff,” Mr. Schlank said. Israelis “are integrated into camp,” he continued. “They do everything. Some staffers from other countries work in Nesher campers develop strong friendships. More Camp Nesher girls smile together.

This year, the camps also are offering preand post-summer camps; last week, there was a Shavuot camp. “We have Tzofim — Israeli Scouts — and family camp all up and running,” he said. “We have come a long way in a short time.” The camps’ leaders have worked to intensify the Jewish content. (One of the camps, Nesher, is for Orthodox children; its Jewish content is specifically Orthodox.) “The staff has spent a lot of time thinking about how we integrate our Jewish values and culture into camp life, not only on Shabbat or days with Jewish meaning built in” — days like Tisha b’Av. “I think that this summer folks will see a marked difference on how we focus on it. “We know that families send their children to camp to get a rich Jewish experience and we are doing it in ways that make everyone comfortable, whether you are a day school family or you get your Jewish values and meaning mainly from camp.” The Jersey Y Camps have developed a Jewish curriculum that blends core Jewish values with camp life. It focuses on one value each week — courage, curiosity, patience, leadership, creativity, understanding, and confidence – and uses examples and emotions that affect camp life to bring them to life. The first week is devoted to courage — ometz in Hebrew, and the word is both spelled in Hebrew and transliterated into English in the curriculum — and acknowledges that it takes courage to leave everything familiar to come to camp for the first time. Exercises involve recognizing and rewarding courage. By the last week, the curriculum focuses on confidence — bitachon — as it looks at the progress campers will have made, and how it hopes they will leave camp. “We are not just a camp, but a Jewish camp,” Mr. Schlank said. “We are not just a community, we are a kehilla.” A Jewish community. “We create a place where we live our Jewish values every day.” Meanwhile, there’s still covid to deal with, of course. It’s changed — it keeps changing — but it’s not gone. “We have an internal medical committee, and we support jobs, and others are bunk counselors or specialists or arts and crafts counselors. They’re not necessarily Jewish, but most of them are. “We are very fortunate to have folks from Australia and New Zealand, who generally end up on the waterfront. They’re usually a little older.” This summer, everyone can come back. “For the first time in three years we could do overseas recruiting in Mexico and in England and in Israel,” Mr. Schlank said. “It was great to really meet the staff, not over Zoom but by sitting and talking with them. “It’s the same thing with recruiting families. We did some of it on Zoom, but many parents wanted to meet our camp directors in person.” Camp Nesher boys are ready for Shabbat. So the camp provided both Zoom and actual It’s twilight at Cedar Lake Camp — a great time to be on a jet ski.

We’re nimble. “Staff has to be vaccinated, and so do children traveling out of camp,” he said. “We are not requiring vaccinations for the kids who are not traveling; our medical folks have made our decisions based on what we’re comfortable with.” That said, Mr. Schlank continued, “we recommend that everyone gets vaccinated, and the vast majority of our kids — well north of 95 percent — are. We really feel very comfortable knowing that the community will be as safe as it would have been if we had mandated vaccines for everyone, because people are listening to the smart science.” Everyone will be tested before getting to camp, he added.

There is consternation over the continuing presence of covid.” Last year, he said, bubbling kept covid away; this year, the virus is far less deadly but frustratingly ineradicable. Large gatherings always seem to yield a few people with the infection. “Last week, the CDC issued an updated protocol for camps and immersive summer experiences,” Mr. Fingerman said. “I am not an expert, but I think that camps are now re-evaluating their not-yet-finalized covid protocols in light of that. There are likely to be more tests throughout the summer then they previously had thought necessary.” In fact, he said, “I am limiting the number of camp visits that my staff and I will make this summer. Normally I’d be at 30 camps. We are cutting back significantly, because we don’t want to add an additional burden to the camps.” Mr. Fingerman, like just about everyone else at the foundation, loves visiting camps. “We can’t wait for 2023!” he said. This year, he said, staffers will have to have a different experience than the one the virus imposed on them last year. They cannot be kept in a bubble, apart from the outside world. “In order to recruit successfully, camps had to promise that there would be time off duty and off campus,” Mr. Fingerman said. “That will require more guidance, testing, and care. Counselors work really hard, and they are very careful in the way they protect their campers, so they need time to keep building their resilience and to recharge their batteries. “And it’s not just about covid,” he continued. “There is an increased concern over mental health, which has only gotten worse among younger campers and counselors. So this is yet another area that’s adding to directors’ concerns. And then with the tragedies in Buffalo and Texas and Tulsa, there is an increased concern about security.” There have been no threats, he added; the concern is not specific. But it’s real. “New Jersey Y Camps have done a really good job of refreshing their security procedures and protocols,” Mr. Fingerman said. “They’re working with Secure Community Network,” the North American Jewish community’s security agency. “And then there’s a concern over the dramatically rising costs of operating this summer,” he continued. “Food, fuel, and staffing costs all have gone through the roofs. Many of the camps set their tuition prices in September or August, when we were facing a totally different level of inflation. We never anticipated that it would be at this level. “These concerns are weighing on camp professionals.” But still there is much room — and much need — for joy. Mr. Fingerman, like Mr. Schlank, talked about the high enrollment numbers at the Jersey Y Camps. “It’s tremendously helpful to know that families have returned. The retention rates are very strong at NJ Y Camps. That is a compliment to the staff and the quality of the program. “There are also a high number of new campers. Last year we had very many, because that basically was two years of new campers.” That’s because there was no camp in 2020. “But we are ahead in numbers of new campers versus 2019. So there is a buoyancy in families’ enrollment participation, and in their confidence in the camps. And there is a record number of Israeli shlichim” — counselors — “who will be spending their summer in camp creating connections with campers and other counselors.” Mr. Fingerman, again like Mr. Schlank, talked about the Yedid Nefesh grants that his foundation gives to camps. Yedid Nefesh — the words mean “beloved soul,” and are the opening words to a hauntingly beautiful Shabbat melody — “which is funded by the Marcus Foundation, is to add new social workers or have them get additional qualifications. We awarded grants to more than 60 camps to help address the social, emotional, spiritual, and mental health issues.” Then he focused on one specific set of camps. “NJ Y Camps continues to be a bright star in the constellation of Jewish camps in North America,” Mr. Fingerman said. Camp FROM PAGE 27 Jewish World JS-30 30 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 Moscow’s chief rabbi in exile after refusing to back Putin’s war on Ukraine, relative says CNAAN LIPHSHIZ As the head of a large European rabbinical group, Pinchas Goldschmidt regularly travels in and out of Moscow, where he has worked as the city’s chief rabbi since 1993. But when he left most recently, two weeks after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on February 24, he did so without a firm plan to return. And now he is officially working in exile after coming under pressure by Russian authorities to support the war, according to his daughter-in-law. “Can finally share that my in-laws, Moscow Chief Rabbi @PinchasRabbi & Rebbetzin Dara Goldschmidt, have been put under pressure by authorities to publicly support the ‘special operation’ in Ukraine — and refused,” Avital Chizhik-Goldschmidt tweeted on Tuesday. Chizik-Goldschmidt, a journalist who lives in Manhattan, shared a report from the French newspaper Le Figaro that detailed her father-in-law’s experience, which included a fundraising stint in Western Europe followed by a visit with his own father in Israel, where he remains today. Goldschmidt declined to comment or to answer questions about whether he believes that he will return to Russia, where he was reelected as the leader of the Moscow Choral Synagogue on Tuesday. Goldschmidt has not been a vocal critic of the war, though Le Figaro reported that he was concerned enough about it that he reached out to rabbis in neighboring Moldova in mid-February, days before Russia invaded Ukraine, to warn of a potential flood of refugees. Other top rabbis in Russia, including the country’s chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, have stayed in the country even after criticizing the war. But Goldschmidt’s status in Russia already has been shaken by politics in the past. In 2005, Goldschmidt, who has had a presence in Moscow since 1989, suddenly was denied entry into Russia. It took several weeks before he was allowed back in. Authorities gave no official explanation, but some officials made unspecified references to “national security issues.” Goldschmidt has declined to comment Learn how to spend less on groceries and travel to exotic places using credit card points • Learn about making money while saving money • Spend less on groceries and earn credit card points • How to maximize your dollar and get free cash • Frugal spending and traveling, can they co-exist?

About the presenter on it, but the affair coincided with a power struggle that ended with Lazar and his Chabad-affiliated rabbis dominating the landscape of Russian Jewish institutional life. Goldschmidt, a Swiss-born rabbi who is not affiliated with Chabad, eventually was allowed to enter Moscow, but the trajectory of his career increasingly centered on Western Europe. He has been the head of the Conference of European Rabbis since 2011. According to the Jerusalem Post, Goldschmidt is staying in Israel. The Ashkenazi and Sephardi chief rabbis of Israel, David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef, wrote a letter to leaders of Russian Jewish communities asking them to respect Goldschmidt’s authority, even though he is “unable to stay in his congregation,” the Post revealed on Tuesday. “The rabbinic court he headed continues to operate under his guidance and provides a proper response to those in need,” the two chief rabbis wrote. Back in Moscow, Lazar’s Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia has set itself apart from other religious groups in its open opposition to the war. Lazar wrote in a statement: “Stop the madness so that no more people die.” And he criticized Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, for saying Adolf Hitler was of Jewish descent. (The unfounded claim was Lavrov’s attempt to draw analogies between the leader of Nazi Germany and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish.) “It would be nice if he apologized to the Jews and simply admitted that he was mistaken,” Lazar wrote about Lavrov. It was an unusual rebuke by Lazar, who is widely thought of as enjoying strong ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a member of the dictator’s inner circle. The fact that it happened in the context of the Ukrainian war, which has touched off a witch hunt against supposed traitors in both countries, only further highlighted the tensions around this issue.

Heads of Russian Muslim groups, representing millions of congregants, also have endorsed the war. Those leaders include Talgat Tajuddin, the head of the Central Spiritual Muslim Board of Russia; Ismail Berdiyev, the head of the Coordination Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus; and Albir Krganov, the head of the Spiritual Assembly of Muslims of Russia. Both Lazar and Goldschmidt have confirmed that thousands of Jews have left Russia since the war broke out. In an interview with Deutche Welle last week, Goldschmidt said a “very significant part” of Russian Jewry, Financial firm Morningstar admits to errors on Israel in bid to quell boycott controversy ASAF SHALEV Pro-Israel activists are declaring a victory against the Israel boycott movement after a financial services company vowed to make changes to avoid inadvertently steering investors away from Israel. The company, Morningstar, had been targeted by a two-year campaign by Israel advocates who believed it was waging a so-called soft boycott of Israel. The company denied the allegations but asked a law firm to conduct a review of its practices. The company released the resulting 117-page report last week. Morningstar said that while the investigation uncovered no evidence of systemic bias against Israel, it would change certain practices that could have had inadvertent impacts on its advice to clients looking to screen their investments based on environmental, social, and governance factors, known as ESG factors in the investing world. Morningstar is one of the leading firms in the field of ESG investing, so the changes enacted under pressure from pro-Israel activists will watched be closely. Ideological groups opposed to the concept of ESG — buoyed by Elon Musk’s recent swipe against it — will look for leverage in their campaign on the issue. Meanwhile, advocacy groups focused on issues such as human rights or the environment likely will worry about whether the Morningstar announcement spells a setback for their efforts. The company said it would decide on standard language to discuss Israeli and Palestinian affairs in its research in order to avoid “inflammatory” terminology. It also said it would provide more transparency to its sources of information. According to the report, in 2019 Morningstar added pro-Palestinian outlets Electronic Intifada and BDSMovement.net to its list of unreliable sources. Meanwhile, the company said it has eliminated its Human Rights Radar service, which was used for tracking developments in regions affected by political violence. The service, offered to investors by Morningstar’s subsidiary Sustainalytics, was found to “exhibit bias” by focusing to much on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. which had 155,000 members according to a 2020 demographic survey, already has left, and that another “significant part is thinking of leaving.” Other rabbis in Russia also have spoken publicly about the circumstances driving the emigration. Boruch Gorin, who is an influential Chabad rabbi, lives in Moscow, and is a spokesperson for Lazar, is on record as citing “a very worrisome political and social climate.” Chasing away rabbis and potentially shuttering synagogues, something that Russian authorities have done in the past to retaliate against dissent, would not help the popularity of the war, which already is having an increasingly polarizing effect on Russian society. But even Russia’s Chabad rabbis aren’t untouchable under Putin. Since 2008, at least eight of them, all of them foreigners staying in Russia on clergy visas, have been deported or have had their visas rescinded or not extended on various grounds — including that they are a threat to national security. Those rabbis were pushed out of Russia despite public protests by Lazar’s organization, demonstrating both the limitations of Lazar’s influence on policy and the vulnerability of Jews and their communal leaders to the whims of the Russian judiciary or the politicians who control it. But punishing rabbis or any other clergy for not toeing the party line would not be a good look for Putin right now. Externally — and perhaps more crucially, internally — his government has said that it invaded Ukraine to “denazify” it, citing what Putin said was a prevalence of far-right ideas and supporters in Ukraine. Gorin, Lazar’s spokesperson, said authorities in Russia have not been targeting foreign rabbis since the war broke out. He said that he is not aware of any pressure applied directly to Goldschmidt or any other rabbi, and that he was surprised by the reports about Goldschmidt. “It would be surprising to learn that Rabbi Goldschmidt was being pressured,” Gorin said. Goldschmidt’s daughter-in-law’s account told a different story. “The pain & fear in our family the last few months is beyond words,” she tweeted.

They may have retired from high-level careers, built businesses, and lived well until now with little or no assistance. They don’t feel “too old” to take care of themselves and the senior living residences they have seen in the past may not appeal to them. While respecting their concerns, however, the reality is quite different. Today’s best senior assisted living residences emphasize living a full and meaningful life on your own terms. Residents decide how they want to get involved and choose the options that suit them best. Tradition at MorseLife, a luxury rental assisted living facility in West Palm Beach, is one of those unique residences that goes far beyond the ordinary to bring people comfort and care in extraordinary ways. Unlike other assisted living residences, Tradition at MorseLife offers seniors everything they need and want with all levels of care included in their monthly rent. Their preferences or level of care needs might change, but their rent stays the same. A broad spectrum of activities, amenities and services are part of Tradition’s all-inclusive care. “What makes Tradition so exceptional is its elegant warmth, all-inclusive care and youthful energy” said Keith Myers, president and CEO of MorseLife Health System. “We welcome prospects to visit us, talk to our staff and residents, and see for Rethinking the art of living well at any age themselves what makes Tradition so special.” Residents live in designer apartments with full kitchens, washers and dryers, balconies, and ample room for personal furnishings and treasured belongings. Outside, there are beautiful tropical gardens, scenic lakes, and landscaped paths for peaceful walks. Residents may cook at home, dine in the elegant dining room that serves gourmet kosher meals, or order room service. Complimentary transportation throughout the Palm Beaches is also included in the monthly rent. It is a safe, gated campus with 24-hour security, hurricane resistant construction, and bio-fuel generators for uninterrupted power. Tradition is all about more life, with activities ranging from yoga and swimming to movies, educational seminars and musical performances, as well as the use of the library, computer lab, indoor pool and more. Religious, cultural, and community services are held regularly at the on-site synagogue. Even as we age, surrounding ourselves with positive energy, social interaction and a healthy lifestyle is the difference between simply living our lives and enjoying lives well lived.

For example, JLens — a Jewish investor network —repeatedly had accused the company of improperly inflating Israel’s risk and controversy ratings, arguing that such behavior amounts to an antisemitic boycott of the country. In March 2021, Morningstar said an internal investigation into the practices of its newly acquired subsidiary Sustainalytics found JLens’ claims to be false. “We stated then—and reaffirm today—that neither Morningstar nor Sustainalytics supports the anti-Israel BDS campaign,” Morningstar’s executive chairman, Joe Mansueto, and its CEO, Kunal Kapoor, said in a public statement announcing the investigation results. “However, in retrospect, our initial review was overly dismissive of the serious bias concerns raised by the organization JLens, the Illinois Investment Policy Board, and other entities. We consider bias unacceptable in any form and concluded that the concerns warranted a thorough, independent review.” Getting Morningstar to this point has been the years-long goal of JLens. The group was among the first to highlight the potential for trouble for Israel from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, as investors have become increasingly interested in ethical guidance on financial decisions. “This is a victory in the fight against the anti-Israel BDS campaign,” JLens CEO Julie Hammerman said in a statement. “Morningstar’s commitment to implement the many recommendations in their report will eliminate a key source of BDS support in the economic arena.” A group of activists opposite JLens on the BDS issue lamented the announcement from Morningstar, pointing to the finance world as an important lever for putting pressure on Israel. “As organizations committed to justice for Palestinians, we are of course disappointed, not only because of the harm caused to Palestinians but also because of the overall potential weakening of human rights standards in investing, that under pressure from JLens and the Illinois Investment Policy Board, Morningstar has decided to discontinue its Human Rights Radar,” Lesley Williams, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace and co-coordinator of the Illinois Coalition For Justice Equality and Free Speech, said in a statement. But Williams rejected Israel advocates’ declaration of victory, arguing that Morningstar has not made significant changes to its practices other than restricting the use of certain sources. “Companies that violate the human rights of Palestinians or who benefit from the violation of those rights can be rated accordingly,” Williams said. JEWISH TELEGRAPHIC AGENCY Morningstar FROM PAGE 31 of the principles of Hasidut discussed above — that God seeks a personal relationship with individual Jews, that God’s hashgahah” — oversight— “is all-encompassing, and that a Jew needs to struggle to do God’s will — bear a close resemblance to articles of faith found in contemporary American Evangelical Christianity.” Englewood’s Rabbi Reichman, in his essay, described chasidism as a response “to a world dominated by materialism. “The way to cure a society of deeply entrenched physicality is to teach about great spirituality,” he wrote. “Hasidut is able to transmit kabbalistic teachings in a way that is accessible and spiritually edifying to the common person, not just the specialist. In today’s era of spiritual malaise, we need this antidote, Hasidut, now more than ever.” He said he has seen the pay-off in that approach with his congregants. “In synagogue, when I share a Hasidic lesson, many congregants say they feel encouraged and invigorated. Were it not for Hasidut they would view Judaism as a series of impersonal and frightening mandates, but through Hasidut they are able to joyfully pursue religious growth.” He conceded that the there are dangers on the chasidic path, writing that “by focusing on spirituality, we risk forgetting that mitzvah observance is paramount. Judaism requires complete self-surrender.” He further counseled that “It is sometimes hard to tell the difference between a pious mystic and a welltrained charlatan — especially for the layman whose learning is limited. We must emphasize that a tzaddik must be a Torah scholar, a person who fears and reveres God, and someone who hates material excess. ‘Rabbis’ who insist on always traveling first class, staying in five-star hotels or in the homes of wealthy donors every night, and give more of their attention to the wealthy than to the needy, are probably not genuine. Excess talk about belief in tzaddikim might lead to individuals believing in the wrong people, with disastrous ultimate results.” Neo-Chasdism FROM PAGE 15 Jewish World JS-38 38 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 Spanish & Portuguese Restaurant Why Go to Newark?

Summers there meant frolicking on the beach under the hot sun, playing on the streets of the Jewish quarter of the capital city, Tunis, where their families lived — and plenty of glorious Sephardic dishes that those grandmothers made with recipes handed down and perfected over generations. There, the childhood friends made a vow. “We said that as soon as we grow up we’d open a restaurant together and serve those dishes in the center of Paris,” David, 35, said. It took a little longer than they expected, but that childhood dream is finally a reality at Mabrouk, a kosher-style restaurant they opened in 2019 that aims to make Sephardic Tunisian dishes accessible to the modern Parisian diner. Mabrouk, which has received glowing reviews in major publications, including Elle magazine and Mabrouk is near Le Marais, Paris’s historically Jewish district.

While couscous and merguez have been available in immigrant communities and niche eateries since immigration from North Africa first swelled in the 1950s, the new generation of restaurants offer a wider array of dishes, aimed at a broader cross-section of eaters. This trend includes 1000 & 1 Signes, which opened in 2013 and whose mission statement includes supporting deaf people, and Kous Bar, a well-designed eatery where customers choose their own couscous toppings as they would at a salad bar. But Mabrouk may be the only outspokenly Jewish player in this culinary new wave, with a menu that reflects the habits and sensibilities of North African Jews. Mabrouk diners can order pkaila — a typically Jewish Tunisian dish that some say is a local variant of cholent — and sabayon, an egg-based ice cream popular with observant Jews because it contains no dairy, and therefore can be eaten with meat. At Mabrouk, it is served with lemon zest that contrasts exquisitely with the yolky creaminess. “We serve Sephardic dishes with a modern French twist,” Alexandre David said. The menu distills the dishes that his and Memmi’s grandmothers served to their families in Tunis, said David, who has been waiting tables during the lunch rush hour lately because of labor shortages due to Mabrouk — whose name is an Arabic-language greeting that is said to congratulate someone on an achievement — looks nothing like the typical couscous eateries that dot Paris.

One dish, a starter called Boutargue Memmi — a slab made up of salted and cured fish roe — is named for the grandmother who inspired it. Alexis Memmi, 32, a self-taught entrepreneur who skipped college and had worked for several years at an Asian restaurant called Beau Café in New York, where he began working as a waiter and eventually as the manager. (It has since shut down.) His childhood friend Alexandre also went into the food business, running a brasserie in the Marais, historically a heavily Jewish district of Paris. The two friends, who are both secular but have “a lot of respect for Jewish traditions,” as David described it, went into business together at Mabrouk immediately after Memmi’s return from New York in 2018. Another dish at Mabrouk, the Djerba Bowl, is named for the island in southern Tunisia that had been a center of Tunisian Jewry for centuries. Served poke-style, it contains a tartar of bream fish, peas, beans, and cauliflower served on semolina, rice, or even quinoa, which is rarely found in other Tunisian restaurants. And a third, the AbitBowl, combines spicy meatballs (keftas), sesame cream, and caramelized onion. Its name is a play on words — Abitbol is a typically Jewish Sephardi last name common in North Africa, France, and Israel. The meat at Mabrouk is certified kosher and the methods of preparation generally observe kashrut and also halal rules, but the restaurant is neither certified nor supervised for kashrut or halal, David said. Obtaining a kosher certificate would require closing on Friday Mabrouk serves “Sephardic dishes with a modern French twist.” CNAAN LIPHSHIZ Jewish World JS-41 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 41 Dining · Catering · Take-Out Experience Preeminent Michelin Star Chef and Restauranteur Laurent Tourondel’s (LT) innovative culinary cuisine. 10% Off In Restaurant Dining Valid until 7/31/22 Must bring a copy of this ad LT Bar & Grill & LT Above Event Space Lunch • Happy Hour • Sunday Brunch • Dinner LT Bar & Grill The Shops at Riverside 390 Hackensack Avenue, Hackensack, N.J. www.ltbarandgrill.com | 551.287.6333 | @ltbarandgrill m m evenings and Saturdays, which would mean changing the affordability at the core of the restaurant’s business model. (Main courses cost between $14 and $22.) But it also would change something about the place’s character. “We want to leave communitarianism. Mabrouk needs to be a place where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and Budhists can all call their own,” David said. Using kosher meat satisfies many if not most French Jews and Muslims, he added, because most French Jews are not very observant and most Muslims view kosher meat as halal. The owners neither hide nor highlight the restaurant’s Jewish aspects, he added. “Our mission was to take Sephardic Tunisian food and to make it 2.0. To make it trendy, to make it hipster-like,” David said. “And we do this by taking the dishes and adapting them to the cultural codes of the French restaurant culture.” Mabrouk — whose name is an Arabic-language greeting used to congratulate someone on an achievement — looks nothing like the typical couscous eateries that dot Paris. The interior design is heavy on Mediterranean blue and mosaic motifs, but otherwise it looks and sounds like a typical brasserie, featuring none of the traditional kitchenware or background music commonly used in traditional couscous restaurants. “The food is authentically Tunisian, authentically Sephardic, but this is a French restaurant in the middle of Paris,” David said. The main design inspiration for Mabrouk is the quintessentially Parisian Café de Flore, one of the city’s oldest and best-known cafes, famous for being a favorite hangout for intellectuals and artists such as Georges Bataille and Pablo Picasso. “At no point did we wish to make the patrons feel like they’re in Tunisia. That’s unnecessary,” David said. Laura Ventura, a regular at Mabrouk and a restaurant owner in Paris, said the understatedness of the vision is exactly what draws her. “It’s different from other couscous restaurants because it’s not kitsch. It’s Jewish Tunisian without reminding you constantly that this is what it is,” said Ventura, who is a Sephardic Jew of Tunisian and Moroccan descent. “I love the food, which I know from my own home, and I love that it’s in a restaurant that speaks to me in the center of Paris, where I work,” she added. Muslim Tunisians also patronize Mabrouk, including Malika Bouchareb, a 60-year-old design shop manager from Paris. “It’s a very welcoming place, I like hanging out with friends there, and I like that I have dishes that speak to me culturally,” she said, adding that while she loves the pkaila, her favorite dish is the mechouia, a grilled vegetable salad rich with eggplant and garlic, sometimes served with a cooked egg. “I don’t observe halal and I don’t mind eating kosher or Jewish food, I’m quite oblivious to all that, frankly.” For Mabrouk to succeed in Paris, the grandmothers’ recipes did need some adjustments. “We needed to lighten things up,” David said, noting the oiliness of traditional Tunisian food. David’s grandmother, Aline, 85, “begins cooking by pouring olive oil generously into a pan. Only then she thinks about what she wants to cook,” her grandson said. To help with that task, they hired Daniel Renaudie, a French-Israeli former journalist who has become a well-known chef in Paris. David and Memmi knew they hit the mark when even Japanese tourists, who David said tend to be averse to fatty foods, came away satisfied. “When we saw that, we thought: mission accomplished,” David said. Mabrouk is doing very well generally. It’s often packed to capacity, with patrons standing in line to be seated. It has the owners thinking about opening up additional franchises: first in New York, then London and then perhaps in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. The pandemic, which forced the restaurant to shut down for months shortly after it opened, made David and Memmi wonder whether they had chosen the wrong time to realize their dream. “We really wanted to become ambassadors of Tunisian Sephardic food in the broader French society because we’re passionate about it,” David said. “It’s great to see that it’s really taking off.” JEWISH TELEGRAPHIC AGENCY The Frazzled Housewife JS-42 42 JEWISH STANDARD JUNE 10, 2022 Kosher Crossword “REVERSE MITZVOT” BY YONI GLATT, [email protected] DIFFICULTY LEVEL: MEDIUM Week two — Shavuot I think the last time my parents were by me for a Jewish holiday, it was for Shavuot. Shavuot is the holiday when we eat a lot of dairy food because we have not yet received the Torah that came with a free, autographed copy of a Susie Fishbein cookbook, which taught us how to make kosher meat dishes. Wow, those kosher cookbooks have really stood the test of time. Anyway, I am pretty sure that the last Shavuot they were here, it was also a three day holiday and we had a bar mitzvah. I remember pushing my dad down the hill and praying that we could make it to the bottom without him flipping out of the chair like in one of those movies. Funny in a movie, not so funny in real life. And then there was the walk back. Pushing my adorable father back up the hill was going to be a challenge. Fortunately, we ran into a young man, fresh off the boat from his spiritually enlightening year in Israel, all ready to do some mitzvahs — and mitzvahs he did! He pushed my dad all the way up the hill with nary a complaint. God bless him. I might still be pushing him up that hill if that fine young man hadn’t been walking next to us. This Shavuot was a little strange for me. I got up from shiva on Tuesday and immediately delved into the shopping-cooking-cleaning process involved in preparing for the marathon holiday. Add to the mix my mom, Appiah-the-Saint aide, Son #1 who doesn’t eat dairy, Dil #1 and my little yummy Strudel, who is, of course, a cholov yisroel strudel. As for my grief, as I have said to many people during shiva, I find it easier to talk to my dad now. Now, when I go on and on, I believe that he can hear me and I know what he is responding. Before, when I could look into his eyes and hold his hand, I never knew if he could hear me, and if he did, if he could understand what I was saying or if what I was saying was frustrating him because he couldn’t answer. Now I like to picture him talking to Duke Snyder from the Brooklyn Dodgers, telling him about how we all went to Cooperstown, to the Duke’s induction ceremony into the baseball hall of fame, and stayed at the owner of Marcal paper towels’ country house. Whose son, fun fact, was allergic to eggs, so my brother and I had to eat tuna fish made with lemon juice. Not yummy, I tell you. Not yummy at all. But in my scenario, Duke Snyder is patting my dad on the back saying, “Thanks for coming, Rich, and because you were there, come play some ball with me and the guys.” Doesn’t that sound nice? Of course, my dad was a much better spectator than player, but I am sure things are different up there. Or I hope they are. It’s funny what you start believing is real after you lose someone who you loved so much that even though you realize it is so for the best, it still feels really, really bad. Okay, enough of that. Let’s get back to the holiday that just ended. Can we discuss how hard it is to cook for this holiday? One person likes quiche. One person likes ziti. One person likes salad. Three people only eat cholov yisroel. One person doesn’t/can’t eat dairy. One person doesn’t like dairy. One person wants meat for every meal. One person needs an omelette at every meal. And because I am such a kind, wonderful, and compassionate person, I try to make everyone happy. My dad liked everything I made for him. I can’t remember him every complaining about what I made and what I served. But since he was not here this year, I knew I was not going to receive any full-hearted appreciation. So when I kept looking up at him saying, “Dad, how’s it going up there?” I know that he is saying, “Banj, you are doing great. Just keep being nice to your mother and tell Husband #1 that I say he should be a little more helpful.” Yup, that was my dad, always looking out for me. Hope you all had a wonderful holiday.
