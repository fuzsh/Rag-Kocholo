        "text": "One of the San Fernando Valley’s best young coaches is coming home.\n\nFormer El Camino Real head coach and University of San Francisco assistant David Rebibo has been named boys basketball coach at Harvard-Westlake.\n\nRebibo replaces longtime successful coach Greg Hilliard, who has stepped down after 30 years at the North Hollywood campus.\n\n“I am beyond excited for the great opportunity and challenge at Harvard-Westlake, one of the finest institutions in the country,” Rebibo said. “It is going to be wonderful. We are going to get to work right away. It is a very exciting time for Harvard-Westlake basketball.\n\nRebibo spent the past two years working under under former Kansas guard Rex Walters at San Francisco.\n\nRebibo helped guide the Dons to a second place finish in the West Coast Conference and a postseason berth in 2013.\n\nBefore that, Rebibo built a successful program at El Camino Real.\n\nRebibo guided the Conquistadores to three L.A. City Section championship game appearances from 2010-2013, including a heartbreaking setback against Westchester in Division 1 in 2013.\n\nRebibo has large shoes to fill.\n\nHilliard won more than 615 games, 13 league championships, nine Southern Section championships and two state championships.\n\n“What coach Hilliard has built at Harvard-Westlake is what every coach aspires to build and we only hope to continue the trend on and off the court and throughout the community,” Rebibo said. “His accomplishments and longevity are truly amazing. We plan to continue to work hard every day and achieve success on and off the basketball court.”\n\nRebibo also has work to do to restore Harvard-Westlake to the top of the league standings.\n\nThe Wolverines haven’t finished higher than third since sharing the league championship with Loyola in 2011.\n\nThe last 20-win season came in 2012 and the program is 45-41 in the past three years.\n\n“We will work the hardest we possibly can every single day,” Rebibo said. “The Mission League is one of the best leagues in Southern California and there is no reason we shouldn’t be competing for league championships and more every year.”\n\nThe cupboard isn’t totally bare despite the graduation of Yale bound guard Alex Copeland.\n\nHigh-scoring guard Wolfgang Novogratz returns with fellow senior Parsa Shoa.\n\nThree promising juniors will be Ali Iken, Carter Begel and Aaron Glazer."
