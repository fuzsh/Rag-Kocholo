        "text": "And Napoleon, you mentioned that the Germans were going to get northern territories from the French around then. Did I miss their post in here where you put it in canon or is it in the sidecanon FAQ sort of thing?\n\nI think I mentioned it in a chapter. I *think...* I'll mention it again in the future to cover my butt.\n\nNice updates, Nappy! As usual the Unionites manage to spread about their particular brand of racist/nationalist bug-f**kery in highly amusing ways (A moral outrage over absinthe? Really? Buncha prudes ). As an aside, it's interesting how they called their *Tommygun a \"rifle\" given the pistol caliber used. Then again, bug-f**k craziness and genocidal antics in Korea and Mexico...\n\nAlso regarding the Beatty Building, you do realize that OTL's Warren Beatty is a Virginia native, right? Did you have that in mind when you wrote that little segment or just happy coincidence? .\n\nAnd finally, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that \"C.E.M.A.\" can properly hold together at least long enough to kick the RUA's walnuts out through their ears down the road...oh, and Stonewall Jackson's Shakespeare paraphrasing with the RUA reference had me rolling\n\nThanks, Fleet!\n\nI was actually totally basing the absinthe bit on OTL. It really happened. If I remember right, the USA didn't relegalize absinthe until the... 1970s was it?\n\nThe Tommy gun \"rifle\" was definitely unintentional and shows how little I know about guns. I kind of like it though. I mean, not much else they could call it, and it's an \"assault\" rifle, which might allow pistol rounds by Imperial standards.\n\nI was totally unaware that Warren was Virginian. Beatty just sounded fancy and \"old-timey,\" so I chose it randomly.\n\nNext chapter (Brave New World II) should cover the South forming the CEMA. And that was Stonewall Jackson III. Stonewall I would never use such language.\n\nGotta go to bed guys, but here's a good amount of the new chapter. The CEMA is formed, and we get to know Bernard Beauchamp Bullivant better, and I think he's shaping up into a neat character. And I revised the list of Georgian PMs. I made a small calculation error last time. Let me know if you still see any date errors.\n\nâ€‹\n\nTHE BRAVE NEW WORLD: PART TWO\n\nSymbol of the Columbia Dollar\n\nIn the 1920s, the Southron nations were getting very, very nervous about the Republican Union. Everyone thought Custer might try to make one last move on the North American chessboard before he died, and if he didn't they thought his successor would try to prove himself by doing so. Thus, in September, 1925, the representatives of the Republic of Virginia, Chesapeake Republic of Maryland, Republic of Georgia, and the Confederation of the Carolinas met in Kingston, Jamaica to discuss the long-anticipated economic union between their nations. In the \"Kingston Accords,\" the Big Four agreed to \"found a mutually-beneficial currency and economy.\" The Columbia Dollar was born. All the citizens of the Big Four could use their old national paper currencies for a year, giving people time to get their money exchanged at any bank or courthouse for Columbia Dollars. If they did not exchange their cash within a year, the cash became worthless. Metal coins were to be exchanged within two years, after which they would reflect the value of the metal they were made of. When the governments acquired the old coins, they smelted them down into Columbia coins. Cuba and the Virgin Islands Confederacy, as technically independent entities though completely controlled by Virginia and the Carolinas in that order, were also automatically entered into the new Columbian Economic Alliance.\n\nColumbia Dollars - Paper Money\n\nOne Dollar - Thomas Jefferson\n\nFive Dollars - Andrew Jackson\n\nTen Dollars - Samuel Chase\n\nFifteen Dollars - James Madison\n\nTwenty Dollars - Archibald Bulloch\n\nTwenty-Five Dollars - William Bradford\n\nFifty Dollars - Earl Van Dorn\n\nEighty Dollars - Henry Clay\n\nOne-Hundred Dollars - Nathan Bedford Forrest\n\nOne-Thousand Dollars - Christopher Columbus\n\nColumbia Dollars - Coins\n\nOne Cent - Picture of the Santa Maria\n\nFive Cents - Andrew Jackson II\n\nTen Cents - Picture of the Citadel of Columbia\n\nTwenty-Five Cents - Thomas Bragg, first Governor-General of the Virgin Islands Confederacy\n\nFifty Cents - George Bonaparte Towns\n\n100 Cents (One Dollar Coin) - Thomas Jefferson\n\nChief players in the negotiations were tycoons Bernard Bullivant, Chester Chiswick IV, and Buford Lodge Beatty, who presented numerous benefits from economic unity between the nations. All three were also warming up for political careers. Just a few years later, Bullivant would be Prime Minister Bullivant. Their corporations and businesses saw stocks soar as the new economic stability kicked in.\n\nJamaica joined the Columbian Economic Alliance as the seventh member shortly after the Big Four worked everything out with the terms (which took about a month). Jamaica was already an economically successful country, with numerous banking companies running very famous establishments in Kingston. Chester Chiswick IV bought all the banks in the city immediately after Jamaica joined the CEA, which made him go from multimillionaire to one of the world's only billionaires.\n\nNext came the discussions of a military alliance. In late 1925, all the nations in the CEA agreed to add to the terms of the accords so that \"if any nation which has entered into this alliance is ever attacked by any foreign power, all the members shall take this as an act of war on the entirety of the Alliance and appropriate actions shall be taken to meet the aggression.\"\n\nThus, the Columbian Economic and Military Alliance was born. Plans for a CEMA flag were dropped when the governments showed fear of losing sovereignty. The Republican Union normally would have been livid about such a turn of events, but Custer's health was failing, and the people were all riveted on that instead. The Catholic-majority Republic of Gran Colombia joined the CEMA in 1926 out of fear of Union aggression launched from Mexico and Central America (Custer even staged war games in 1922 simulating an invasion of Gran Colombia).\n\nSigning of the Kingston Accords, 1925\n\nREPUBLIC OF GEORGIA:\n\nPrime Minister Bernard Beauchamp Bullivant's official portrait\n\nGeorgia in the 1920s, as discussed before, was an exciting place. Rapid expansion triggered by the skyscrapers going up in Savannah, Atlanta, Birmingham, and St. Augustine created an era of big business. In the 1910s, the ultra-nationalist Patriot Party and the more liberal Log Cabin Party destroyed themselves in a series of debate debacles and ugly, ugly campaigns where candidates threw every piece of dirt they could at each other. It devolved to such a point that in the 1912 Prime Ministerial election, Patriot Jeremiah T. Codd physically attacked threatened to shoot Log Cabinite Wilson Spooner in the face over an insult.\n\n\"My opponent, Mister Spooner here, is out to help his friends in the railroad business. He's a railroad man. And that's fine, but one should not be in the position of Prime Minister of our Republic to help one's friends or make money.\"\n\n\"Well, Senator Codd, your mother had more gentlemen callers than the telephone operator.\"\n\n\"You son of a gun, I'm going to shoot you in the face for that, you lying low-down piece of dirt!\"\n\n-Transcript of the 1912 Debate\n\nCodd jumped the podium and lunged at Spooner and proceeded to beat him with a cane. Codd was arrested but won by a narrow margin because Spooner \"looked like a weakling and it was exceedingly dishonourable for a Southron gentlemen to insult another gentlemen's mama, even though she was a whore.\" Codd won reelection four years later thanks to fact that everyone feared him and refused to run against him (and the fact that many discouraged voters stayed home and didn't vote). Codd became known as \"Emperor Jerry,\" and everyone breathed a sigh of relief after his second term was over. The newly-reorganized Liberty Party made a roaring comeback, and smooth-talking Kenneth Kirby represented the Liberty Party's ultra-rich but patriotic base. He was charismatic enough to win over the poor, as well, and he sank Log Cabinite Johnson Adams and Patriot Peter Schmidt in the 1920 elections. Eight years later, debonaire billionaire Bernard Beauchamp Bullivant was elected in a landslide, continuing the resurrection of the Liberty Party. He had been influential in forming CEMA, and both his election and reelection campaigns promised to \"keep the good times rolling and the party boppin'.\" He celebrated his reelection by opening the world's largest bottle of champagne which was accompanied by several cakes with showgirls popping out the tops.\n\nCartoon depicting \"Emperor Jerry\" beating Wilson Spooner into unconsciousness in the 1912 Debate\n\nThe Brick Palace of Atlanta, home of the Georgian Prime Ministers.
