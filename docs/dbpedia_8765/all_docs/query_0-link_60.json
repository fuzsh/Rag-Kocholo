        "text": "Historical Geography\n\nGeography of Ancient Times (Plates 8, 9, 10)\n\nThe first geographical accounts, or rather indications, are due to the oldest Greek poets, of whom Homer in particular presents us with numerous geographical and ethnographical accounts, for which reason he may be looked upon as the oldest geographer. He supposed the earth to be a circular disk, inclosed by a great body of water, the ocean. In its midst lay the mainland of Hellas. Above the earth was placed the brazen vault of the heavens, and beneath the earth a similar vault, inclosing Tartarus, or the lower regions, situated as far below the earth as this was below the heavens. Of all the regions of the earth, Homer was only acquainted to any extent with Greece and Asia Minor, although he refers to Thrace, Phœnicia, Egypt, Lybia, Ethiopia, and some few islands in Western Europe. Hesiod (800 B. C.) had more knowledge of this subject than Homer; in his writings we find the first mention of Modern Italy, as also of Spain, under the name of the Garden of the Hesperides. Æschylus and Pindar distinguished three parts of the world, bounded by the Phasis and the Nile. The philosophers of the Ionian school (founded by Thales of Miletus, 640–548 B. C.) endeavored to attain a knowledge of the shape and physical features of the earth by deductions from hypotheses; it was the school of Pythagoras, however, that first broached the idea of the sphericity of the earth. The so-called logographers, or the oldest Greek historians before Herodotus, extended the knowledge of geography to a considerable extent. Among them may be especially mentioned Hecataeus of Miletus (549–486 B. C). Certain projectors and historians of (at that time) great voyages of discovery, as Scylax (509 B. C.) and Hanno of Carthage (500 B. C), also deserve honorable mention. (For the idea of Geography, as possessed by the ancients, see pl. 8.)\n\nHerodotus of Halicarnassus (484–408 B. C.) is, however, to be looked upon as the true father of ancient geography, having travelled extensively for years at a time, and published the results in historical works, many of which are still extant. He returned to the first idea of a terrestrial disk resting in the centre of the universe, and assigned to the disk an elongated or oval outline, and an encompassing ocean. A division into two great halves appeared to him more appropriate than that into three parts; these were separated by the Mediterranean, the Black, and the Caspian seas; the northern division included Europe with Northern Asia to the Phasis; the southern, the rest of Asia and that portion of it forming the peninsula of Libya (i. e. Africa). In his works we first find the name Italia. The last inhabited land of Europe, according to him, is Thrace. Scythia forms a square, each side of which amounts to 4000 stadia; to the north, next to Scythia, dwell the Agathyrsoi, Androphagoi, &c., and the Sauromatoi, north of the sea of Azof (Mseotis). Asia, separated from Europe by the Phasis, and divided by the Halys into two principal portions, is as large as Africa. Along the Mediterranean, inhabited by the Colchians, Saspeirians, Medes, and Persians, are two great peninsulas, the one containing Asia Minor, the other Persia, Syria, and Arabia. The latter is the most south-western land in Asia; India the most south-eastern land in the world. Africa, or Libya, was divided by Herodotus into three portions: the valley of the Nile or Egypt, Libya in its restricted sense, and the land of Ethiopia, or the most south-western inhabited region. (See the map of the world according to Herodotus, on pl. 8.)\n\nAfter Herodotus, the following are the Greek authors who added to the science of Geography: Ctesias of Cnidos, whose works are lost; Thucydides, in his history of the Peloponnesian war; Xenophon, in the Anabasis and other works; Theopompus; Scylax, in his Periplus; Pytheas; Aristotle, who asserted the sphericity of the earth from observations on lunar eclipses, and on the general principles of Gravity; Theophrastus, &c.\n\nGeography was first placed on a systematic basis by Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276–194 B. C.); he it was who wrote the first scientifically arranged work on the subject. This, however, has entirely disappeared, excepting a few fragments. He also constructed the first chart of the earth, accordino; to astronomical and mathematical principles. He considered the northern half of the earth to be alone inhabited, and supposed that the portion thus occupied amounted to about one eighth of the whole surface. He found an ardent opponent to many of his views in the great astronomer of antiquity, Hipparchus of Nicaea.\n\nA new era in the history of Geography begins with Strabo (66 B. C. to 24 A. D.). To him we owe the first extensive and complete work on the science (in seventeen books), almost entirely extant at the present day. In its preparation he passed many years in study and travel. In his view, the whole earth is inclosed by a great Atlantic Ocean, which forms four large gulfs; the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Gulf, and the Mediterranean, the largest of all. The great island of the earth he divided into a northern and a southern half, assuming, however, for greater convenience, three grand divisions, Europe, Asia, and Libya: the limits of those are the Straits of Hercules (Gibraltar), the Arabian Gulf, and the Tanais (the Don). Iberia or Spain lies furthest west. East of this is the land of the Celts or Gauls (France), between the Pyrenees and the Rhine, parallel to these mountains. Britain has the shape of a triangle, north of which is the island lerne (Ireland), the most northern part of the inhabited earth. Germany is only known at the mouth of the Albis or Elbe: further east, the entire northern coast of the earth is unknown. The Alps rise along the boundary between Gaul and Italy, and to them are opposed the Apennines. Asia, separated from Europe by the Tanais and Mseotis, is divided into a northern and a southern half by the mountains of Tauris. The largest and most eastern portion of the earth is India. Libya, which is not as large as Europe, and with Europe in addition, is less than Asia, is of a triangular shape, the northern shore along the Mediterranean constituting the base; Egypt and Ethiopia constitute its most eastern portion. (For a map of the world according to Strabo, see pl. 8.)\n\nAmong subsequent geographers, one of the most distinguished is Claudius Ptolemæus, who flourished about the middle of the second century, He wrote a geographical work, which up to the sixteenth century continued to be the universal manual. He presents to us the most advanced stage of the knowledge of Geography as possessed by the ancients. The chief peculiarities of the Ptolemaic system are as follows (see the map of the world according to Ptolemy on pl. 8). Ireland (luernia) is no longer to the north, but to the west of Britain (Albion); to the north of Albion lie the Orcades, and still further north the Island of Thule. Scandinavia (Scandia) is an island smaller than Ireland. Even the Danish islands are mentioned, as Jutland (the Cimbrian Chersonese). The Caspian (Hyrcanian) Sea is inland. Ptolemy extends Asia to the east far beyond the Ganges, and speaks of the land of the Sinse (Chinese). Asia and Africa, he supposed to be connected, the Indian Ocean intervening simply as a great Mediterranean sea. Ceylon (Taprobane) he imagined to be the largest island on the earth; next to it extended from north to south, a group of 1378 islands. He makes mention of the Mountains of the Moon and the sources of the Nile in the interior of Africa, the River Niger, &c.; and on the western coast he laid down the Happy Islands, through which he drew his first meridian.\n\nIn the time of Herodotus the measure of length employed was the stadium, or the length of the Olympian racecourse. Various estimates have been made of the exact length of the stadium. From the best sources of information it would appear that this, the longest measure of length made use of in classical antiquity, contained 600 Grecian or 625 Roman feet. As the Roman foot contains nearly eleven French inches, this would make the stadium 570\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) French or Paris feet, equivalent to about 607\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) English feet, or less than \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) of an English mile (\\(\\frac{1}{10}\\) of an English geographical mile of 2025 yards). We may therefore count 600 stadia to a degree. A Roman mile contained 5000 feet, and was equivalent to eight stadia, so that 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of these go to the geographical mile, and 75 to a degree of the equator. The Persian parasang has been estimated at thirty stadia or \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\) of a geographical mile, so that there are twenty to a degree. An Egyptian schœnos contained two parasangs or sixty stadia; according to some authors, however, only thirty or forty. A gallic hour or leuga (leuca) contains 1500 Roman paces or twelve stadia: consequently, there are fifty to a degree.\n\nThe circumference of the earth, as is well known, amounts at the equator to 21,600 geographical miles, or 216,000 stadia. Eratosthenes estimated it at 252,000 stadia; Hipparchus at 275,000: Posidonius at first at 240,000, but subsequently at 180,000 stadia, or \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) of its actual size. The last-mentioned estimate was accepted by most of the subsequent astronomers and geographers, even by Ptolemy.\n\nThe Greek compass or wind card (on pl. 8, according to Aristotle) is divided into eight main winds, which, from west round by north, are as follows: Zephyros, Argestes, Boreas or Aparctias, Csecias, Apeliotes, Euros, Notes, Lips. Between Boreas and Argestes blow Thrascias or the north-north-west wind, and between Boreas and Csecias, Meses, or the north-north-east wind. Two additional winds were subsequently added to these ten; phœnicias or south-south-east wind, and Libonotos or south-south-west; the twelve winds then divided the card into equal parts, so that excepting the four main winds, the rest had an entirely different signification from those on our card. Vitruvius enumerates twenty-four winds (see the wind card of the Romans on plate 8).\n\nPlate 9 represents the kingdom of Alexander the Great. This renowned conqueror was originally only a king of Macedonia, a country of small extent, bounded on the east by Thrace and the Egaean Sea, south by Epirus and Thessaly, west by Illyria, and north by Dardania and Moesia; it now constitutes part of Turkey in Europe. Philip, the father of Alexander, had already subjected numerous Thracian, Illyrian, and Dardanian tribes, and in fact all Greece, by the battle of Chaeronea (338 B.C). Alexander, after ascending the throne in 336 B.C., conquered the Thracians, Triballi, Getas. and Illyrians, reduced Thebes, and first commenced his victorious career as Emperor of Greece, by his expedition against the Persians in 334 B.C. After the battle of the Granicus, he overran Asia Minor, passing through Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine, to the borders of Egypt: Egypt he conquered without any difficulty, and founded, in 332, the city of Alexandria. After a pilgrimage to the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, in the Lybian desert, Alexander took up his march towards Central Asia, overthrew the Persian empire by the victory at Gaugamela or Arbela (331), and afterwards conquered Media, Parthia, Hyrcania, Margiana, Aria (329), Arachosia, Bactriana, and Sogdiana. In 327, Alexander crossed the Indus, Hydaspes, Acesines, and Ilydraotes, as far as the Hyphasis (Sudletsch), until his warriors refused to go any further. He now returned by another route to the Hydaspes, embarked on the Acesines. and passing into the Indus, ultimately gained the great ocean. Erom the mouth of the Indus he returned by land through the deserts of Gedrosia and Carmania (Nearchus conducting his fleet through the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, and the Euphrates) to Babylon, where he died in 323. After his death his empire fell to pieces, forming several smaller kingdoms, as: 1, the Macedonian Greek; 2, the Syrian or kingdom of the Seleucidae (founded by Seleucus Nicator), which included the principal portion of the old Persian empire, and by whose downfall there arose various minor governments, as Bactria, Parthia, Armenia, Judsea, &c.; 3, the Egyptian empire under the Ptolemies; 4, Pergamos in Asia Minor, Pontus, Bithynia, &c. (See the small chart on pl. 9.)\n\nPl. 10 represents the Roman Empire under Constantine the Great. This monarch, in 330 A. D., divided his colossal dominions into four great prefectures: Italy, Gaul, Illyria, and the East. Each of these was divided into dioceses, which again were subdivided into provinces; of these there were 117 in all.\n\nItaly the First Prefecture, consisted of three dioceses: Italy with Rome as its capital, Illyria with the capital Syrmium, and Africa with the capital Carthage. The Diocese of Italy was divided into three principal portions, Gallia Cisalpina (Upper Italy, excepting Savoy, but including a part of the Tyrol, and of Middle Italy); Italy proper (Middle Italy), and Græcia Magna (Lower Italy). In Cisalpine Gaul we have the provinces of Carnia (now Friaul, with the towns of Tergestum, now Trieste; Vedinum, now Udine; Aquileia): Venetia (towns Patavium, now Padua; Vicentia; Verona); Istria (Pola), Gallia Transpadana (Brixia, now Brescia; Cremona; Mantua; Bergamum, now Bergamo; Comum, now Como; Mediolanum, now Milan; Ticinum, now Pavia; Augusta Taurinorum, now Turin); Gallia Cispadana (Placentia, now Piacenza; Parma; Mutina, now Modena; Bononia, now Bologna; Ravenna); Liguria (Genoa; Lucca; Nicæa, now Nice). In Italy proper we have the following divisions: 1, Etruria, the present Tuscany, with a part of the Papal States (Pisa; Sena Julia, now Sienna; Portus Herculis Libronis, now Livorno: Perusia, now Perugia); 2, Umbria ( Ariminum, now Rimini; Sena Gallia, now Sinigaglia; Urbinum Hortense, now Urbino); 3, Picerium (Ancona); 4, Sabina, with the provinces of the Marsi, Peligni, &c.; 5, Latium (Rome; Tusculum, now Frascati; Tibur, now Tivoli: Præneste, now Palestrina; Terracina VelitrjTe, now Velletri; Cajeta, now Gæta). Groicia Magna, or Lower Italy, was divided into the following provinces; 1, Campania, now Terra di Lavoro (Capua Neapolis, now Naples; Herculaneum; Pompeii; Stabia; 2. the Land of the Picentini (Salernum, now Salerno): 3, Sainnum (Beneventum); 4, Land of the Hirpini, and 5, of the Frentani; 6, Lucania, now Basilicata and Principato citra (Pæstum and Sybaris, now \"no longer in existence); 7, Bruttii, now Calabria (Rhegium, now Reggio); 8, Apulia (Venusia, now Venosa; Barium, now Bari); 9, Messapia or Calabria (Brundusium, now Brindisi: Ilydruntum, now Otranto; Tarentum, now Taranto). Here belong also the three great islands of Sicily (Messina; Catania; Toormina; Syracuse; Agrigentum, now Girgenti; Panorraus, now Palermo); Sardinia (Calaris, now Cagliari) and Corsica.\n\nThe Diocese of Illyria consisted of Illyria proper, or the east coast of the Adriatic Sea (now Dalmatia, most of Bosnia, and a portion of the present Croatia and Albania). Illyria was subdivided by the River Drilo into two parts, Barbarian and Grecian Illyria, the latter of which, with the cities of Durazzo and Albanoplis, was subsequently assigned to Macedonia; Barbarian or Roman Illyria consisted of the provinces Japydia, Liburnia, and Dalmatia. Pannonia, which included the eastern part of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, the whole of Hungary between the Danube and the Sau, Sclavonia, and parts of Croatia and Bosnia, was divided into upper (or western) and lower (or eastern). Particular provinces were Interamnia between the Sau and the Drau, Ripensis or Savia on the Sau, and the province of Valeria between Raab, the Danube, and the Drau. To Upper Pannonia belonged the cities of Vindobona (now Vienna), and Emona (now Laibach); to Lower Pannonia the cities of Arabona (now Raab). Acincum (now Ofen), Acimincum (now Peterwardin), Taurunum (now Semlin), Sinnium, the Largest town in Pannonia, now in ruins. Noricum divided into Noricum Ripense in the north, and Noricum Mediterraneum in the South, including the greater part of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Salzburg, and embraced the cities of Lentia (now Linz), Juvavia (now Salzburg), Noreja, Celeja (now Cilly), Laureacum (now Lorch). Here belonged in addition the following provinces: Vindelicia, subsequently called Rhsetia Secunda, including north-eastern Switzerland, south-eastern Baden, the most SDuthern portion of Wurtemberg and Bavaria, with the northern part of Tyrol, and Rhætia (Augusta Yiudelicorum, now Augsburg; Regina, now Regensburg or Ratisbon; Campodunum, now Kempten: Brigantium, now Bregenz: Batavia Castra, now Passau); Rhætia prima, now Graubünden and Tyrol, with a part of Lombardy (Tridentum, now Trient; Yeldidena, now Wilten; Teriole Oeni Pons, now Ipnspruck: Clavenna, now Chiavenna; Curia, now Chur).\n\nTo the Diocese of Africa belonged the following provinces; Cyrenaica or Pentapolis (Ptolemais, now Tolometa; Arsinae, now Tochira; Berenice, now Benegasi; Cyrcne the capital); Syrtica, or Tripolitana (with three capitals, Leptis Magna or Neapolis, now Lebida; Oea or Oeca, now Tripoli; Sabrata). Africa proper, or the province of Africa, divided into the districts of Byzacium in the south (Adrumetum; Tysdrus; Capsa) and Zeugitana in the north (Tunes, now Tunis; Carthage, once the capital of the mighty Carthagiuian nation, but long since in ruins; Utica next in importance to Carthage. Numidia, the present Algiers (Thabraca, now Tabarca; Hippo Regius, now Bona; in the interior, Zama, and Cirta, now Constantine). Mauritania divided into two provinces; the eastern, M. Cæsariensis (capital Cæsarea); and the western, M. Tingitana (capital Tingis, now Tangiers). Under Diocletian or Constantine, Mauritania Cagsariensis was divided into two provinces, Caesariensis in the west, and Sitifensis in the east: M. Tingitana was united with the Diocese of Spain.\n\nThe Second Prefecture of Gallia consisted of three dioceses; Gallia in its restricted sense, Hispania, and Britannia. Gallia (the present France, with Belgium, Holland, and parts of Germany, Italy, and Switzerland) was divided by the Emperor Augustus into the four provinces, Narbonensis, Aquitanica, Lugdunensis, and Belgica, which, however, were divided by Constantine the Great or even by Diocletian into fourteen, and still later into seventeen provinces. Gallia Narbonensis or Braccata, the oldest Roman province before the time of Julius Cassar, was separated into five provinces: Narbonensis Prima et Secunda, Alpes Maritimse, Viennensis, Alpes Graiæ, and Penninæ; it also included the provinces of Languedoc, Roussillon, Provence, Dauphiny, with the greater part of Savoy, Piedmont, and the cantons of Geneva and Yalais (Narbo Mantius, now Narbonne, the capital; Tolosa, now Toulouse; Massilia, now Marseilles; Telo Martius, now Toulon; A relate, now Aries; Geneva Valentia, now Valence). Aquitania was divided into the three provinces, Novempopulana, Aquitania Prima, and A. Secunda; it embraced the districts of Gascony, Beam, Auvergne, Guienne, Poitou (Burdigalia, now Bordeaux: Besunna, now Perifoux; Limonum, now Poitiers; Avaricum, now Bruges). Gallia Lugdunensis, previously Celtica, the largest of the four provinces, was divided into the four lesser provinces, Lugdunensis Prima, Secunda, Tertia, and Quarta, and included the provinces of Burgundy, Normandy, Brittany, Champagne, Maine, Touraine, Anjou (Lugdunum, now Lyons; Augustodunum, now Autun; Cabillonum, now Chalons on the Saone; Lutetia Parisiorum, now Paris; Kotomagnus, now Rouen; Genabum or Aurelianensis Urbs, now Orleans; Cæsarodunum, subsequently Turoni, now Tours). In conclusion, Gallia Belgica was divided into the five provinces, Belgica Prima et Secunda, Germania Prima et Secunda, and Maxima Sequanorum; it embraced the present Lothringia, a portion of Champagne, Picardy, Belgium, the left bank of the Rhine, southern Alsace,Tranche-comtc, and v.estern Switzerland. The most important towns embraced within these limits were in the land of the Helvetii, Lacus Lausonius, now Lausanne; Eburodurum, now Yverdum; Salodurum, noAV Solothurn (Soleure); Turicum, now Zurich: in the land of the Sequani, their capital Yesontio, now Besangon; Tullum, now Toul, in the land of the Leuci; Devodurum, now Metz, principal town of the Mediomatrici; Argentoratum, now Strasburg; Noviomagus, now Spires; Mogontiacum, capital of Germania Prima or Superior, now Mayence; Borbeto Magnus, now Worms; Augusta Trevirorum, capital of Belgica Prima, now Trier: Confluentcs, now Coblentz; Colonia grippina, now, Cologne; Bonna, now Bonn: in the country of the Batavi, called Insula Batavorum; Lugdunum, novr Leyden; Arenacum, now Arnheim; Noviodunum, now Nimwegen; Traiectum, now Utrecht; also Cortoriacum, now Courtray; Gesoriacum, subsequently Bononia, now Boulogne; Samarobriva, now Amiens; Csesaromagus, now Beauvais; Noviodurum or Augusta Suessonum, now Soissons; Durocortorum or Remi, now Rheims; Durocatelauni or Catelauni, now Chalons sur Marne.\n\nThe Diocese Hispania, including the present Spain and Portugal, was divided by Augustus into three provinces: Bsetica, Lusitania, and Tarraconensis. To these Constantine added the four provinces, Galhiecia, Carthaginiensis, Baleares, and Mauritania Tingitana in Africa. Bætica embraced the southern part of Spain, the present Andalusia, or the provinces of Sevilla, Granada, and Cordova, the western half of Jaen, the eastern part of the Portuguese province Alemtejo, and the southern part of Estremadura (capital Hispalis, now Seville). Other towns are Gades, now Cadiz; Corduba, now Cordova; Malaca, now Malaga. Lusitania, embraced the greater part of Portugal, and the Spanish provinces Estremadura and Salamanca (capital Augusta Emerita, now Merida; also Ebora, now Evora; Olisipo, now Lisbon, Salmantica, now Salamanca). Hispania Tarraconensis, the largest province, included the present Navarre, Arragon, and Catalonia, as also parts of Valencia and Castile: according to Pliny, it contains 179 cities (capital Cassaraugusta, now Saragossa; Carthago Nova, now Carthagena: Yalentia; Tarraco, now Tarragon; Barcino, now Barcelona; Pompelon, now Pampelona). Gallæcia embraced the Spanish province of Galicia, the Portuguese province Entre Douro e Minho, and the western part of Leon and Asturia, subsequently the whole of Asturia (principal towns, Braga; Brigantium, now Corunna). On the Balearic Islands (Major and Minor, now Majorca and Minorca) we find the towns Palnia and Pollentia, now Pollenza.\n\nOf the British Islands, Britannia and Hibernia, the former only, and of that only the southern part of England, was in the possession of the Romans, who divided it into two provinces, Britannia Superior and Inferior (Scotland was known as Caledonia or Britannia Barbara). Four provinces were subsequently established: Britannia Prima, or the southern part; B. Secunda (Wales); Maxima Cagsariensis (the land between the Thames and the Ilumber); and Flavia Casariensis (the country north of the Humber to the Roman wall); to these was subsequently added a more northern province of Valentia. The principal towns of Roman Britain were Londinum or London; Amenta, now Winchester; Dunium, noAV Dorchester; Camalodunum, Colchester; Lindum, now Lincoln; Ratse, now Leicester; Eboracum, now York; Luguvallum, now Carlisle, &c.\n\nThe Third Prefecture of Illyricum (the eastern Illyria) included all the country of Greece to the Danube, excepting Thrace and the true Illyria; it consisted of the Diocese of Macedonia (capital Thessalonica) and Dacia. To the former belongs not only Macedonia proper, but also the whole of Greece; Macedonia proper being divided into two smaller provinces, Macedononia Prima, including the coast, country, and the western mountain region, and Macedonia Secunda or Salutaris. embracino; the northern mountain region; the capital of the former was Thessalonica, now Salonica, that of the latter, Stobi, now destroyed. Pella and Philippi are the only other towns worth mentioning.\n\nHellas, or Greece, was called Achaia by the Romans, and is naturally divided into three great sections. 1. Northern Greece, in the north of the isthmus of Corinth, and including the following provinces: 1. Thessalia, the largest of all the Grecian pro\\inces (towns, Pharsalia Larissa; 2, Acharnania (towns, Ambracia, now Arta; Actium); 3, Ætolia (Elseus, now Missolonghi): 4. Doris; 5, Locris (Amphissa, now Salona; Naupactus, now Lepanto); 6, Phocis (Delphi, now Castri); 7, Bœotia (Thebæ, now Thiva; Platæa; Leuctra; Lebadea, now Lavadia: Chæronea; Coronea, near the present Granitza: 8, Attica (Athens, the capital of the kingdom of Greece, with the three harbors, Piræus. Munychia, and Phalerus); Megaris (Megara, the only city now a village of the same name). There also belongs here the province of Epirus, not included with Achaia (towns Buthrotum, now Butrinto; Nicopolis, now Prevesa; Anion or Aulona, now Balona). II. The Peninsula of Peloponnesus, subsequently called the Morea, and embracing the following ten provinces: 1, Corinthia. (capital Corinth); 2, Sicyonia (Sicyon); 3. Phliasia (Phlius); 4, Achaia (Patræ, now Patras); 5, Elis (Elis): 6, Messenia (Massene; Corona, now Coron; Methona, now Modon); 7, Laconia (towns Sparta or Lacedaemon, near the present Mistra); 8, Cynuria (Thyrea): 9, Argolis (Argos, still extant; Nauplia, now Napoli di Romania); 10, Arcadia (Megalopolis; Mantinea; Orchomenos). III. The Grecian Islands. In the Ionian Sea may be noticed, Corcyra, now Corfu; Paxi, now Paxos and Antipaxos; Leücas or Leucadia, now Santa Maura; Ithaca, now Thiaki; Cephallenia, now Cephalonia; Zacynthus, now Zante; Cythera, now Cerigo; Aegina, now Eghina. Eubœa, still of the same name, but formerly called Negroponte (towns, Chalcis; Eretria: Carystus: Histiæa). Crete was the largest of the islands of Greece; it was called Candia by the Turks (the Isle of Cyprus belonged to the Prefecture and Diocese of the East). Among the Cyclades, so called from their lying in a circle about Delos, may be mentioned Delos, Pares, Melos, Andros, Tenos, Syros, Myconos, Ceos, Naxos, Gyaros, Cythnos, Siphnos, and Seriphos. Among the Sporadian Islands were included: Thasos, Samothrace, Imbros, Lemnos, now Stalimene, los, Thera, Astypalgea, Amorgos, &c. The other Sporadian Islands, as Rhodes, belonged to Asia. To the Diocese of Macedonia also belonged the so-called Grecian Illyria, Illyria in its most restricted sense, likewise Epirus Nova, which embraced a large portion of Modern Albania. The capital was Epidamnus, subsequently called Dyrrhachium and now Durazzo.\n\nThe Diocese of Dacia included the central part of Mœsia, south of the Danube, and by Aurelian called Dacia Aureliani. In it was not included the true Dacia to the north of the Danube, embracing Hungary beyond the Theiss, Siebenbürgen, Bukowina, Moldavia, and Wallachia. Subsequently there was distinguished a Dacia Secunda, or Ripensis, the region along the Danube, from the Dacia Interior or Prima, the southern strip in the interior to the borders of Macedonia; also Dardania Prævalitana and Mœsia Prima.\n\nThe Fourth Prefecture of the East was divided into five dioceses: Thracia, Pontus, Asia, Egypt, and the Orient or East in its more restricted sense. The Diocese of Thracia. with Constantinople (previously called Byzantium) for its capital, embraced a large part of the present Turkey in Europe, and was subdivided into the provinces, Moesia Secunda, Scythia, Hæmimontus, Thracia, Rhodope, and Europa. In addition to the capital it contained the following towns: a, In Mœsia Secunda; Nicopolis on the Hsemus, now Nikopoli; Durostorum, now Süistria; Odessus, now Varna; b, in Scythia; Tomi, or Tomis, now Temeswar; Constantiana, now Costendsche; c, in the Hæmimontus; Adrianopolis, or Orestias, now Adrianople, or Edrene; d, in Thracia; Philippopolis, now Philippopoli; e, in Rhodope; Abdera, now Polystilo, or Asperosa; Ænus, now Enos; f, in Europa, besides Constantinople; Selymbria, now Selivria; Bisanthe, Rodosto, Perinthus.\n\nThe Diocese Pontus embraced eleven provinces; Bithynia, Galatia, Cappadocia Prima and Secunda, Paphlagonia, Honorias, Galatia Secunda, or Salutaris. Pontus Polemoniacus and Helenopontus, Armenia Prima and Secunda. Bithynia. the eastern part of which was named Honorias, had for its capital Chalcedon; Bithynium, subsequently Claudiopolis, was the capital of Honorias. Constantine divided Galatia into a northern part, G. Prima, and a southern, G. Secunda; Ancyra, now Angora, was the capital of the former, Pessinus that of the latter. Cappadocia, the most eastern province of Asia Minor, and now the Turkish province of Caramania, was separated into two provinces, Cappadocia Prima in the north, and Cappadocia Secunda in the south; the former had Caesarea (previously Mazaca) for its capital, and the latter Tyane, now Kills Hissar. Pontus, the most northern part of Asia Minor, included the present Pachalics of Trebisonde and Siwas; it was divided into an eastern part, P. Polemoniacus, and a western, Helenopontus (previously Pontus Galatlcus): chief towns, Trapezus, now Trebisonde, under Trajan, the capital of Pontus Cappadocius; Amasia, capital of Helenopontus; Neo-Cæsarea, capital of P. Polemoniacus. The Provinces of Armenia Prima and Secunda together, constituted Lesser Armenia.\n\nThe Diocese Asia or Asiana formed eleven provinces; Asia Proconsularis, Hellespontus, Insulæ, Pamphylia, Lydia, Caria, Lycia, Lycaonia, Pisidia, Phrygia Salutaris, and Pacatiana. The Province Asia Proconsularis included the western coast of Asia Minor, from Cape Lectum to the mouth of the Mseander, or the greater part of the old districts of Æolis and Ionia, with the neighboring parts of Mysia and Lydia (towns, Pergamum, now Pergama or Bergama; Smyrna, Clazomenæ, Colophon, and Ephesus). The Province Hellespontus embraced Troas and most of the northern parts of Mysia. The Province Insulæ included all the islands belonging to Asia Minor, with Rhodes, situated on an island of the same name, for the capital. The most important of these islands are: Tenedos on the coast of Mysia, and Lesbos (capital Mitylene) on the coast of Ionia; Chios, now Scio; Psyra, now Ipsara; Samos, Icaria; on the coast of Caria, Patmos, now Patmo; Leros, Calymna, Cos, Nisyros, Telos, and Syme. The Province of Pamphylia was a narrow strip of coast in the south of Asia Minor, with Syde for its capital. The Province of Lydia contained only the southern part of ancient Lydia, the northern and smaller portion having been added to Phrygia under the name of Mæonia. The Province of Caria, the south-western part of the peninsula, embraced the present Turkish province of Alidinella and Mentechseli; in it was situated the town of Miletus. The Province of Lycia, a peninsula on the southern coast of Asia Minor, now forms the western part of the district Tekeh. Lycaonia had for its capital Iconium, now Konieh or Kunjeh. Pisidia included the district of Isauria. Phrygia, the most western of the interior divisions of Asia Minor, was divided into the Province, P. Salutaris, or Salutaria, the largest and most central portion of the country (capital Synnada), and P. Pacatiana (subsequently Capatiana), a long and narrow strip in the west, with Laodicea or Lycos as its capital. The most northern part of Phrygia was called P. Epictetus, the south-eastern P. Parorios.\n\nThe Diocese Egypt contained the following as the more important towns: 1. Lower Egypt; Alexandria, capital of the Empire of the Ptolemies, now Scanderick; Canopus; Athribis: Babylon, now Baboul, on the boundary between Middle and Lower Egypt; Pelusium. 2. Middle Egypt; Memphis, capital of the whole of Egypt; Oxyrynchus, now Behnese; Ilermopolis Magna, now Achraimim. 3. Upper Egypt, or Thebais; Tentyra, now Denderah; Captos, now Keft; Thebes, one of the oldest towns in Egypt and the whole world; Syene, now Assuan.\n\nThe Diocese Orient (in its more limited sense) was divided into fifteen provinces: PaljBstina Prima, Secunda, and Tertia or Salutaris; Phoenicia; Phoenicia Libani; Syria Prima and Salutaris; Cilicia Prima and Secunda; Cyprus, Euphratensis, Osrhoene, Mesopotamia, Arabia Petræa, and Isauria; Palaestina or Judsea was divided into the region this side and beyond the Jordan. The former was cut up by the Romans into three districts, Galilæa in the north, Samaria in the middle, and Judæa in the south (the southern part of the latter was sometimes called Idumæa). The land beyond Jordan or Peræa was divided into six districts, Trachonitis or Trachon, Ituræa, Gaulanitis. Auranitis, Batanæa, Peræa. Of these provinces subsequently erected, Palæstina Prima embraced the largest and most northern part of Judæa with Samaria: P. Secunda. Galilæa and the northern part of Peræa; P. Tertia, southern Peræa, the southern part of Judæa and a portion of Arabia Petræa. Prominent towns besides Jerusalem the chief capital, are Cæsarea; Joppa. now Jaffa; Jericho, now Richa Ascalon, now Askalan; and Gaza; all in Judaea. In Phœnicia are Tripolis now Tripoli or Tarablus; Berytus, now Beirut: Sidon, now Saida; Tyre the most important city of all; Aca, subsequently Ptolemais, and now Acca or St. Jean d’Acre. Syria, the present Soristan, was divided into two principal portions. Upper Syria, or Syria proper, and Lower Syria, usually called Cœlosyria; the latter was the more southern portion, and, in a wider sense, likewise included Phœnicia and Palæstina. The Romans divided Upper Syria into ten provinces, Comagene, Cyrrhestica, Pieria, Seleucis, Chalcidice, Chalybonitis, Palmyrene, Laodicene, Apamene, Cassiotis. Constantino the Great, however, united the two first into one province, Euphratensis; and Theodosius the younger divided the rest of the land into Syria Prima (the northern part, capital Antioch) and S. Secunda, or Salutaris (the southern part, capital xA-pamea). The most important towns were Samosata, capital of Comagene; Hieropolis, or Bambyce, capital of Cyrrhestica, and subsequently of the whole province Euphratensis; Seleucia in Seleucis; in Palmyrene, Palmyra, now Tadmor; in Apamene, Apamea, capital of Syria Secunda; Emesa. now Hems, capital of Phœnicia Libanesia; in Cassiotis, Antiocha on the Orontes, now Antakia: in Cœlosyria, Damascus, now Damaschk, and Heliopolis, now Baalbec. Cilicia, the most south-eastern coast land of the peninsula of Asia Minor, was separated into two parts, Cilicia proper, or level Cilicia, the largest and eastern portion, now Adana; and rugged Cilicia, or Tracheotis, the western portion, now called Itschil. Theodosius II, divided the former into two provinces. Cilicia Prima (the western part) and C. Secunda (the eastern). The original capital of Cilicia was Tarsus, now Tarso. Rough Cilicia became an appendage to Isauria. The province of Cyprus included only the island Cyprus (capital Salamis, subsequently Constantia). Mesopotamia, the region between the Euphrates and the Tigris, was divided into two parts, Osrhoene in the west (capital Edessa, now Orrlioa or Orfa) and Mesopotamia proper, in the east, also called Mygdonia (capital Nisibis or Antiocha, now Nisib). Arabia was divided by Ptolemæus into A. Deserta, Petræa, and Felix. The northern part, A. Petræa, alone was in possession of the Romans. Here dwelt the Amalekites, Edomites or Idumaeans, the Moabites, Ammonites, and Midianites. Petræa was the capital city.\n\nSuch was the extent and arrangement of the Roman Empire under the first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great (305–337 A. D.), who, in 330, changed his residence from Rome to Constantinople, the ancient Byzantium, thereby making the distinction into an eastern and a western Roman empire. The first actual division of the empire took place under the emperor Diocletian (284–305). Diocletian, in 285 A. D., took Maximian as his colleague, who nominated Constantius Chlorus as associate, Diocletian nominating Galerius; the empire had thus four rulers (from 291 A. D). Of these, Diocletian governed all the eastern provinces beyond the Egagan Sea; Maximian took Italy, Africa, and the intermediate islands; Galerius, Thrace and Illyria; and Constantius, Britain, Gaul, Spain, and Mauritania. To the latter emperor succeeded his son Constantine the Great, in 306, who, in 312, after the victory over Maxentius, son of Maximian, became master of all the western provinces excepting Mauritania and North Africa. In 323 he conquered Licinius, and thereby came into possession of all the eastern provinces, and thus again united the whole empire under one sceptre. After his death in 337 A. D., the empire was divided again among his sons Constantine II., Constans, and Constantius 11. The latter was sole emperor from 353–361, and to him succeeded Julian the Apostate to 363. In 394 A. D., Theodosius the Great again united the empire, but shortly before his death divided it among his sons Honorius and Arcadius, the former taking the western, and the latter the eastern empire. This division was permanent. The former empire (the capital of which, for a long time, was Ravenna) met with its downfall in 476, by the irruption of innumerable hordes of barbarians who swept over Europe towards the west and south. These consisted of the Turcilingi, the Goths, the Heruli, the Alans, the Scyri, and the Rugi, with Odoacer, king of the Turcilingi, at their head: this prince then ruled the whole of Italy. The last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, son of the general Orestes, and by him elevated to the throne in 476 A. D., hardly attained to the government; his predecessor, Julius Nepos, the last recognised emperor of the western empire, died in 480, after which Odoacer became king of Italy. The eastern Roman empire, also called the Byzantine or Greek empire, fell away by degrees, but lingered out a miserable existence until 1492, when Constantinople, with the remains of the empire, fell into the hands of the Asiatic Turks.\n\nGeography of the Middle Ages(Plates 11 and 12)\n\nIn Plate 11 we present to our readers a map of Europe in the time of Charlemagne. The empire of the Franks was the most powerful in existence at that period, extending over France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and great part of Hungary. The basis of the empire of the Franks was laid by Clodio, their first historical king, who, about 437, conquered the northern provinces of France. He was succeeded by his son Merovteus, from whom the first royal race of the Franks received the name of Merovingian. After ruling from 447 to 456. he was succeeded by Childeric, 456 to 481, after whom came his son Chlodvig I. (Clovis), king of the Salian Franks, and real founder of the Frankian monarchy. By his victory over Syagrius at Nogent, not far from Soissons, Clovis put an end to the Roman dominion in the now Frankish Empire. The battle of Tolbiacum, now Zulpech, in 496, gave him the sovereignty over the Allemanni; in 508, he conquered all Aquitania, and all the West Gothic provinces in Gaul; and in 510 enlarged his empire by murdering all the other kings of the Franks.\n\nOn the death of Clovis, in 511, his dominions were parcelled out among his four sons, Clodomir, Childebert, Lothar I., and Theodoric, forming four kingdoms, with Paris, Orleans, Soissons, and Metz, as the capitals. The fourth kingdom was called Austrasia, and included, in addition to the original region, the Ripuarian Franks, the Duchies of Friesia, Thuringia, and Bavaria; the three first were subsequently united under the name of Neustria, to which was afterwards attached Britannia Minor or Armorica, the Brittany of the present day. In addition to Austrasia and Neustria, Gaul included two other principal countries, Burgundy and Aquitania. Burgundy, from 443 to 534, constituted a separate government, but was conquered in 534 by the British kings, and united with the kingdom of Orleans; it embraced Burgundy proper, the provinces taken in 544 from the east Goths, western Switzerland, and Dauphiny. In 508, Aquitania, the south-western part of France, was taken from the west Goths: in it were included the provinces of Auvergne and Gascony. Theodebert, the son and successor of Theodoric, destroyed the government of Thuringia, and turned it into a Frankish province. From 558 to 561, Clothar or Lothar L, son of Clovis, reigned alone; after his death, however, the kingdom was divided among his four sons. Subsequently we find only the two kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria (with Burgundy) which Dagobert I. again united in 628, his brother Charibert residing at Toulouse as king of Aquitania., Fresh partitions again occurred, but in 687 Pepin of Heristal became actual ruler of the three kingdoms, under the title of Major Domus, subsequently a Duke and Prince of the Franks: Dietrich III. and his successors being kings only in name. To Pepin succeeded his natural son Charles Martel, who elevated himself to the position of Duke and sole lord of Neustria and Austrasia, after the death of Dietrich IV., in 737, and converted Friesland on the North Sea into a Frankish province. His sons Pipin the Short and Carlmann divided the kingdom; the latter, however, entering the cloister, and Childebert III. having been deposed, Pipin was crowned king of the Franks by St. Bonifacius in 752, and subsequently by Pope Zacharias. Shortly after, he conquered Septemania: this was the former Gallia Narbonensis, the region between the Cevennes, Pyrenees, the Rhone, and the Mediterranean, whose western portion had already been snatched from the west Goths, by Clovis, in 511. The strip along the coast from the Pyrenees to the Rhone, with the capitals Carcassone and Narbonne, still, however, remained in their possession, subsequently falling into the hands of the Arabs. Shortly before his death, Pipin, in 768, divided the kingdom betw-een his two sons, Carlmann and Charles (the Great), the former receiving Neustria and Burgundy, the latter Austrasia; Aquitania was completely subjected, in 769, and divided between the two. After the death of Carlmann, in 771, Charlemagne reigned alone; ultimately, however, he gave Aquitania to his son Louis I. and Italy to his other son Pipin. By the death of Pipin in 810, his son Bernard became ruler of Italy. This prince, in 774, conquered the entire Longobardian kingdom of Italy, with its capital Pavia, and in 778, Pamplona and a part of Northern Spain as far as the Ebro. In 785, the greater part of Germany, namely Saxony and Bavaria, fell into his hands; Hungary, as far as the Theiss, followed in 796, and Brittany in 799; in 800 he was crowned at Rome, Roman Emperor. In 804, the Saxons surrendered themselves entirely, and the Eider was recognised as the northern boundary of Bernard’s dominions. Charlemagne died in 814; his son Louis the Pious (814–840) in 817 divided the kingdom between his sons Pipin (Aquitania), Lothar (co-ruler and future superior), and Louis (Bavaria, Carinthia, and Bohemia); his youngest son Charles the Bald, in 829, received Alemannia and Rhaetia, in 837 Neustria, and after the death of Pipin, in 838, Aquitania also. At the conference of Verdun, in 843, Charles the Bald received West Franconia and the kingdom of France; Lothar I. (from 820, king of Italy, and emperor from 823) took the middle provinces, Lothringia, Elsace, Upper and Lower Burgundy, while Louis II. (the German) had East Franconia, or the kingdom of Germany. Charles the Stout (882–884) united all the states of the Carlovingian monarchy, but was deposed in 887 by the Germans.\n\nEurope at one time consisted of the following monarchies. The Greek Empire, limited to the greater part of the present Turkey, Greece, Asia Minor, a part of Lower Italy and Sicily. 2. The Bulgarian kingdom, in what had previously been Lower Mœsia. 3. The kingdom of the Avari, much enfeebled by the attacks of Charlemagne subsequent to 791, and in 807 entirely overthrown by the Bulgarians. 4. The kingdom of the Chazari in Eastern Russia, much harassed in the ninth century by the inroads of the Petschenigenes or Patzinacites, a Turkish tribe, and in 1016 entirely subjected by the united powder of the Russians and Greeks. 5. The kingdom of the Slavi in Western Russia, Poland, Prussia, Bohemia. Moravia, and Northern Germany as far as the Elbe. 6. The kingdom of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. In Sweden, the posterity of Sigurd II. (794–824) ruled as kings in chief until 1060; King Harold Haarfager or the Fair-haired (863–933) first in Norway, founded a separate kingdom. Gorm the Old (855–936) is to be looked upon as the true founder of the Danish government, although in the time of Charlemagne, Gottfried or Gottrich, king of South Jutland, possessed considerable powder in Denmark. 7. The Seven Anglo-Saxon Monarchies in England: Kent, Wessex, Sussex, Northumberland (previously divided into Bernicia and Deiria), Mercia, Essex, and East- Angles; these were all united in 827 into one, by Egbert, king of Wessex, who called himself king of England. In addition to these, there were the dominions of the Britons in Western England (Cornwallis, Cumberland) and Wales (North Wales or Cambria, South Wales or Damnonia); also of the Picts in Eastern Scotland, and of the Scots or original inhabitants of Ireland, in North-western Scotland, both united in 838 by King Kenneth II., together with many small powers in Ireland. These last-mentioned were divided into four sub-kingdoms: Ulster, Connaught, Leinster, and Munster. 8. In Spain and Portugal there existed at this time two governments; one the Arabic kingdom of Cordova (Al Hakem, 796–822), established by Abderahman I. in 756, and embracing the greater part of Spain and the whole of Portugal; the other, the Christian kingdom of Asturia or Oviedo, in the north-west (Alphonso the Chaste, 791–835). Count Garcias (853–870) first established the small kingdom of Navarre, after the Gascons in Navarre had in 831 withdrawn from the Frankish rule. 9. In Lower Italy, after the downfall of the Longobardian kingdom, there existed an independent principality, Benevent, established by Arigis, who, in 787, submitted to Charlemagne. Nevertheless, his son Grimoald revolted in 793, and died in 806, unconquered. His successor again submitted to a stronger power in 812, but in 818 Benevent was again independent. About 840 was established the Principality of Salerno.\n\nPlate 12 represents Europe at the time of the Crusades (1100–1250). In the centre of Europe, in Germany and the neighboring countries, we find the Roman-German Monarchy, whose kings, since the time of Otto the Great (962), had, for the most part, been crowned emperors and kings of Italy. Subject to them were the Duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, Carinthia, Saxony, Lothringia, &c. The kingdom of Burgundy and Arelat, in 1 032, came into the possession of the Emperor Conrad, who was crowned in Geneva, king of Arelat; subsequently, however, the greater part of the kingdom broke up into independent governments, or came under the rule of the French. The north and largest portion of Italy belonged to the Monarchy, only the smaller part of Lower Italy to the Greek Empire. By degrees there arose in Upper Italy the Republics of Milan (1056), Pisa, Genoa, Pavia, &c. Lower Italy, however, excepting Naples and Benevent, became subject to the Normans, who erected several new states. These were: 1. The county Aversa and principality Capua, the latter established in 1062 by Count Richard I. 2. Apulia, a county from 1043, and a duchy (in connexion with Calabria and Sicily) from 1060. 3. Sicily, snatched by Count Roger in 1060–1090 from the Arabs. The universal supremacy of the Pope dates from the gift of the Marcgravine Matilda of Tuscany, who, in 1077 or 1079, bestowed upon the Church all her extended possessions and properties, consisting of Tuscany, Mantua, Parma, Reggio, Piacenza, Ferrara, Modena, and a part of Mark Ancona. Nevertheless, after the death of the Emperor in 1115, only a small portion of her goods went to the Pope, and even after the addition of vast temporal possessions to spiritual supremacy, the Popes for a long time recognised the superiority of the Emperor. The boundaries of the present Papal States were assigned in 1209 by Emperor Otto IV. Since the time of Innocent III. (died 1206), the reigning Pope has been Primate of Rome and her territories; these, however, did not increase materially before the fifteenth century.\n\nIn eastern Europe we find the following governments: 1. The continually decaying Eastern or Greek Empire. From 1081–1185, the race of the Comneni had possession of the throne, but in 1185, Isaac Angelus established a new dynasty. From 1204-1261 there existed a Latin dynasty in Constantinople, established by Count Baldwin of Flanders, who, in 1204, captured Constantinople, at the head of the Crusaders: this was limited to the vicinity of the capital. 2, Serbia, after the death of the powerful Emperor, Emanuel I. Comnenus (1143–1180), became independent, and the Zupan (Prince) Stephan Venceanus (1195-1224) was in 1217 crowned king of Rascia. 3. In 1186 a new Wallachian- Bulgarian kingdom was established. John Asan I. (1217–1241) conquered Macedonia and the greater part of Thrace, and immediately assumed the imperial title. 4. The kingdom of the Hungarians or Madschars was ruled by Princes of the house of Arpad up to 1301. At this period Stephan I. the Holy received the royal crown from the Pope (about 997), and obtained Siebenbürgen; he introduced Christianity among his people. Kings Ladislaus I. (1077–1095) and Colomann (1095–1114) conquered the whole of Croatia, Sclavonia, and Dalmatia, although the latter province subsequently fell into the hands of the Venetians. 5. The duchy, and afterwards kingdom of Poland, which, since 1130, had extended over Pomerania and Silesia, but, since 1163, had had a separate duke. For more than five centuries, from 840–1370, the race of Duke Piast, called from the plough to the sceptre, ruled over the land. In 965, Mieczyslaw I. embraced Christianity, and in 999 his son Boleslaw I. (992–1025) assumed the title of king. Boleslaw III., in 1138, divided the land among his four sons; but Wenzeslaw II., in 1305, again united most of the provinces. The principality, and subsequently the duchy of Lithuania, was independent of Poland. 6. The Grand Principality of Russia, under Wladimir I., who introduced Christianity, in 1015, among his twelve sons. The government descended to his son Jaroslaw I., who, in 1015, divided his dominions among his five sons, who held their residences in Kiew, Tschernigow, Perejoslawl, Wladimir, and Smolensk. Division after division subsequently took place, until there were fifty principalities, of which, however, the Grand Principality of Kiew was the most powerful, and claimed the supremacy. About the middle of the twelfth century, George Dolgoruki, the founder of Moscow established a new principality in Western Russia, with Wladimir as the seat of government, which soon became more potent than all the rest; in 1155 he united Wladimir and Kiew, but in 1157 both principalities were again separated. From 1237–1477 Russia came under the rule of the Mongolian Tartars, and was tributary to the Khan of Kaptschak. The seat of government, from 1015–1169, was held at Kiew; fit Wladimir, from 1169–1328, and after that at Moscow. Prussia and Livonia were ruled, from the thirteenth century, by the German Order, called into being by Duke Conrad of Masowia, in 1230, to fight against the heathen Prussians; this Order, in 1237, became united with the Order of the Brethren of the Sword, and in 1243–1247, conquered Courjand and Semgallia.\n\nIn Northern and Western Europe there existed the following governments: 1. The kingdom of Denmark. This attained the zenith of its power under King Canute II. the Great (1016–1035) who was at once king of Denmark, Norway (conquered 1031, lost 1036), and England (conquered in 1013 by his father, Sven), as also of Schleswig, ceded in 1035 by Conrad II. Under Magnus I. the Good, king of Norway, Denmark became a Norwegian province, but in 1044 Jarl Sven Magnus Estritson assumed the royal title, and established a new dynasty, which ruled Denmark up to the fifteenth century. Canute Laward, son of King Erik Eyegod, was, in 1115, the first Duke of South Jutland or Schleswig. Waldimar I. the Great conquered Rügen in 1168, Stettin and a part of Pomerania in 1173. King Canute IV. (1182–1202) subjected the Princes of Mecklenburg and the Duke of Pomerania, named himself king of Wenden, and in 1200 conquered Holstein. 2. The kingdom of Norway, with its capital Drontheim (since 1019); with the exception of the period of Danish dominion under Canute the Great, the race of Hakon ruled here up to 1319. 3. Kingdom of Sweden. The Swedish Prince Olof II., Skaut-Konung (993–1024), no longer called himself king of Upsala, the title which had been borne by his predecessors since the fifth century, but king of Sweden. In 1060, the dynasty of Yngling became extinct, from which time, up to 1127, the House of Stenkil held the sceptre, and afterwards, up to 1250, the Houses of Swerker and Bonde alternately. King Swerker, in 1137, united the whole country into one monarchy. 4. In England, after Hardicanute (son of Canute), Edward the Confessor (1041–1066), the last king of the Saxon dynasty, held sway; after him the Normans, under William the Conqueror, came into power. Henry I. (1100–1134) united Normandy with England, and thereby sowed the seed of perpetual war with France. The House of Plantagenet reigned from the year 1154. Henry II., the first of the line, acquired the dukedom of Brittany in 1169. In Scotland, which at that time also embraced Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Northern Northumberland (up to 1157), Macbeth became king in 1040, after the murder of Duncan, but in 1057 was replaced by Malcolm III., son of Duncan. Malcolm IV. surrendered Cumberland and Westmoreland to England, in 1157, and William the Lion-Hearted of Scotland (1165–1214) was obliged to yield up the whole country, although it soon seceded again. Ireland was governed in part by the Danes, whose chief points were in Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, and Limerick. In 1166, the English began the invasion of Ireland, at that time divided among many rulers, and in 1172, Henry II. took possession of the country in person. Nevertheless, the dominions of the English extended only over the southern and south-eastern parts of the island, together with a narrow strip of the north-east coast, while the whole north and north-east, Ulster and Connaught, remained under the native sway. About the middle of the eleventh century, the Hebrides and neighboring islands withdrew from the Norwegian rule, and were united into a kingdom of the Islands, or of Man (Fingali king from 1066). 5. In France reigned the third dynasty of the Capetians from the time of Hugo Capet (987–997). At that time the king of France had little power over his more powerful subjects. The whole western part of France, from the shores of the Channel to the Pyrenees, Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Touraine and Maine, Aquitania, with Auvergne and Gascony, were either immediately, or as fiefs, in the power of the English kings, whose French dominions were most extensive under Henry II., far exceeding those in England. The south of France belonged partly to Spain: the Count of Toulouse possessed Septimania, and the Tolousanian Gau, but after 1067, Count Raymond of Barcelona, by the purchase of Carcassone and Rasez, came into possession of part of his dominions. The remnant of the great kingdom of Burgundy, in connexion with France, formed a single dukedom. Robert, grandson of Hugo Capet, opened the line of Dukes of Burgundy, who ruled on to the fifteenth century. The royal dominion proper embraced only a part of the former dukedom of France, the counties Clermont, Dreux, Paris, Corbeil, Orleans; the vicomtes Bourges, Etampes, and Melun; the bishoprics of Noyon, Laon, and Beauvais. After the year 1200, Philip Augustus (1180–1223) became possessed of Touraine, Maine, Anjou, Normandy, a great part of Poitou, also of the counties Artois, Vermandois, Alençon, Amiens, Evreux, and Valois. His son Louis VIII. acquired Niort, Rochelle, and Avignon; while Louis IX., son of Louis VJIL, obtained the dominions of the Counts of Toulouse, Beziers, Carcassone, Bourbon, Boulogne, &c. Thus within these short limits, the power of the French crown increased more than two-fold. Provence came likewise into possession of the royal house, by the marriage (in 1245) of the heiress Beatrice with Charles of Anjou, brother to Louis IX.\n\n6. In Spain we find at this period the following great Christian powers: Castile, Leon, Arragon, and Navarre, in addition to that of the Arabs. Sancho the Great subjected all the Christian dominions in Spain, excepting Leon and Barcelona, which he then divided amongst his four sons, into Castile, Navarre (with biscaya and Alava), Arragon, and Sobrarbe. The latter, in 1038, became attached to Arragon; as also Navarre, in 1076, this remaining attached until 1134, when Garcias IV. was chosen king. One of his successors, Sancho VII. the Wise (1194–1234), in 1200, lost Alava, Biscaya, and Guipuzcoa, to Castile. In 1037, Leon likewise became united to Castile, but Ferdinand I. of Castile, who inherited the throne, divided his dominions in 1064 amongst his sons, thus giving rise to three kingdoms, Castile, Leon with Asturia, and Galicia with Portugal. These, however, became again united in 1073, under Alfonso VI. In 1084, Toledo was snatched from the Moors, and converted into a royal possession; this people likewise lost all the land north of the Tagus (New Castile). After the death of Alfonso VI. in 1109, Galicia, Leon, and Castile, fell to Alfonso I. of Arragon, who married Urraca, daughter of Alfonso VI. After the death of Alfonso I. in 1134, Alfonso VII., son of Urraca, by her marriage with Count Raymond of Galicia, was recognised king of Galicia, Leon, and Castile: he conquered the whole of La Mancha, as also Calatrava, was crowned Emperor of Spain in 1135, at Leon, and died in 1157. His dominions again became divided into the kingdoms of Castile and Leon, this separation lasting until 1230, when Leon, after the death of Alfonso IX., became permanently united to Castile. The Moors now lost Cordova in 1236, Murcia in 1243, Jaen and its territory in 1246, Seville in 1248, Xeres, Cadiz, Sidonia, &c., in 1256. The kingdom of Arragon, separated in 1134 from Castile, was in 1137 united to Barcelona, whose Count, Raymond, became king, as son-in-law of Ramiero II. king of Arragon. This kingdom was enlarged by the acquisition of Tudela in 1114, Saragossa in 1115, Tortosa 1138, Lerida 1149, Majorca 1229, Minorca 1233, and of the kingdom of Valencia in 1232–1245. The Moorish part of the peninsula likewise fell into numerous principalities, the most important of which were: 1, That of the Edrisides, Malaga, Algesiras, Ceuta, and Tangiers, 1015-1086; 2, that of the Abadides in Seville, to which were added Cordova in 1044, Malaga, Algesiras, Alicante, Murcia, &c., in 1086 (1026–1094); 3, that of the Beni-Alaftas in Badajoz to 1094; 4, that of the Dilnunides in Toledo, 1036–1085, and later in Valencia, 1085–1092; 5, that of the Alamerides in Valencia, Cuença, &c., 1021–1085. In addition to these, there was the territory of Saragossa; subject to the Emirs residing there, were the vicegerents of Lerida, Tortosa, Huesca, and Tudela. All the Arabian kingdoms, except Saragossa, were, in 1097, subject to the race of Almoraviden or Morabethun, from which they were wrested fifty years later, by the race of Almohaden. Nevertheless, one province after another fell into the hands of the Christians, until there remained to the Moors only the kingdom of Granada, established in 1238 al Arjona, and the territory of Alicante. 7. Portugal was established as an independent country by King Alfonso VI. of Castile, in 1094, for Couni Henry of Burgundy, the husband of his natural daughter Theresa; Alfonso L, son of Henry, acquired Lisbon in 1147, Evora in 1166, and called himself king, in 1139, after a great victory over the Arabians at Ourique. Alfonso III., who came into power in 1244, took Algarbia from the Arabians in 1250.\n\nThe Crusades. Our limits permit us to present only a very brief outline in reference to the geographical history of the Crusades. The first took place in 1096, excited by the enthusiast, Peter of Amiens, sometimes called Peter the Hermit. Under Peter, his friend Walter the Moneyless, the priest Gottschalk, and Count Enrico of Leiningen, several hundred thousand crusaders, principally from the Rhine country, collected together, and marched through South Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, towards the Greek empire (Alexius Comnenus, Emperor). Having lost fully half their number by the attacks of the Hungarians and Bulgarians, the remnant was sent across the Bosphorus into Asia, by Alexius. Here they entered the dominions of Kilidsche Arslan, Sultan of Iconium, who nearly annihilated them at the battle of Nicsea, and in other contests. Subsequently appeared on the stage, the main army under Godfrey of Bouillon, and his brother Baldwin of Flanders; Hugh the Great, Count of Vermandois and brother of the King of France; Duke Robert of Normandy, son of William, King of England; Count Raymond of Toulouse; Count Robert of Flanders; Count Stephen of Blois; Bohemund, Prince of Tarent, son of Robert Guiscard. &c. Godfrey of Bouillon, with his two brothers, Baldwin and Eustachius, set out on the 15th of August, 1096, and marched through South Germany and Hungary towards Thrace: Count Hugo of Vermandois, however, passed through Italy, and suffered shipwreck on the coast of Greece, thereby losing the greater part of his forces; the other leaders, with their divisions, followed subsequently. In May, 1097, the whole army, with its baggage, was collected before Nicaea in Bithynia, which soon surrendered. A victory at Dorylseum opened the way to Syria. Baldwin went towards the Euphrates, and established a sovereignty in Edessa, while the other crusaders besieged Antioch, gaining possession of the city on the 3d June, 1098, after a siege of nine months. The crusaders set out for Jerusalem in May, 1099, passing between Lebanon and the coast, and subjugating the Turkish Emirs of Tripolis, Tyre, Sidon, Ptolemais, and Caesarea. They first beheld Jerusalem, on the 6th of June, 1099, and on the 15th of July the city was taken by storm. A Christian state was then established, and Godfrey of Bouillon chosen as its head, who maintained it at the siege of Askalon against the Sultan of Egypt. At the same time, Tancred set up a government in Tiberias, Raymond of Toulouse one in Laodicea, &c. The harbors of Ptolemais, Tripolis, and Sidon, were subsequently taken, with the assistance of the Genoese, and afterwards Tyre also. In 1144, the Christians lost Edessa, the bulwark of their dominion in Asia; this started the second crusade, preached by Abbot Bernard of Clairveaux.\n\nThe second crusade commenced in 1147. At its head were the Emperor Conrad III., and King Louis of France; who were followed by 140,000 knights and about a million of foot. The German army set out in the spring of this year, and passing through Hungary and Greece, sailed across to Asia. Conrad selected the shortest but more dangerous way through Iconium; but the incessant attacks of the Turks wasted away his army, and with but a feeble force he escaped to Constantinople. Louis, who started later, reached Attalea in Pamphylia, with but a small part of his force, with which he set out for Antioch. Meeting with Conrad and Baldwin III., they laid siege to Damascus in 1148, which, however, remained unsubdued. In 1149, the European princes returned to their homes.\n\nThe third and fourth crusades were incited by the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin, in 1187, after having previously taken Sidon, Joppe, Berytus, Ptolemais, &c., and conquering the Christian army under Guido, at the battle of Tiberias. This time, the cross was taken up by Frederick I., Henry II. of England (who, dying soon after, his place was supplied by his son Richard the Lion-Hearted), and Philip Augustus of France. In January, 1189, the German army set out from Ratisbon: the emperor being accompanied by his second son Duke Frederick of Swabia, as also by Duke Berthold of Meran, and Ottokar of Styria, Markgrave Herman of Baden, Counts Adolf of Holstein and Rupert of Nassau, the Bishops of Wiirzburg, Münster, Osnabriick, Meissen, and others. The route through the Grecian empire had to be forced at the point of the sword, and the Emperor Frederick reduced PhilippopoHs, Adrianople, NicopoHs, Demotica, &c., until the Greek Emperor, in March, 1190, granted the right of way. The army crossed the Hellespont to Asia in Grecian ships, and May 17, attacked the residence of the faithless Sultan of Iconium, passing then through Cilicia to the city of Seleucia on the River Calycadnus: here the emperor, having imprudently thrown himself into the water, was drowned by the torrent on the 10th of June, 1190. His army then passed by Tarsus, Antioch, and Tyre, to Ptolemais, which had been besieged since 1189, by King Guido. The kings of France and England went to Palestine by sea. Philip Augustus, accompanied by Duke Hugo III. of Burgundy, the Counts of Poitou, Flanders, Blois, Perche, Rochefort, Champagne, Sancerre, Dreux, Clermont, Soissons, Vendome, &c., sailed in the summer of 1190 from Genoa, and King Richard of England from Marseilles. In Messina, the armies of both united, and after spending the winter in Sicily, landed near Ptolemais, in April and June, 1191, this place capitulating on the 13th July, 1191. The titular king of Jerusalem, Guido of Lusignan, transferred his claim to Jerusalem, to Count Henry of Champagne, nephew of King Richard, himself establishing a new kingdom on the Island of Cyprus, which lasted nearly three hundred years. In September, 1192, Richard returned to Europe: Philip Augustus, as well as the German army, had left long before.\n\nThe Emperor Frederick II. undertook the fifth crusade. This prince had made a vow to that effect on ascending the throne, to which he was doubly pledged, having married the daughter of the titular king of Jerusalem (the Count of Brienne), and having himself assumed the title of king of Jerusalem. His expedition of 1227 was a failure, but in 1228 it was again repeated, and the emperor made a successful debarkation at Ptolemais, reached Joppe in November, and in February 18, 1229, concluded a truce of ten years with the Sultan of Egypt; in this time, Jerusalem, and most of the region belonging to it, fell into the hands of Frederick. This monarch entered Jerusalem, placed the crown on his own head on the 18th of March, and by the end of May, returned to Brundusium. Jerusalem was again lost in 1244, by the inroads of a troop of Chowaresmians, who fled before the Mongols.\n\nThe sixth crusade was undertaken by Louis IX. of France, in 1248. On the 25th of August, the crusaders embarked at Aigues-Mortes, and reached Cyprus by the middle of September: here they remained until the spring of 1249. After Pentecost, 1249, the army anchored before Damietta, and captured the town. Here it remained until the 20th of November, when it set out along the Nile for Cairo. This city, however, was never reached, the whole French army, with its king, having been taken prisoners in April, 1250. In consequence of a treaty of peace with the Sultan, Louis returned to Damietta, went thence to Ptolemais, and finally returned to Europe, in April, 1254. A second crusade, undertaken by Louis, in 1270, became converted into an expedition against Tunis.\n\nThe Christians still possessed a few fortified towns in Palestine and the coast of Syria, namely, Antioch, Tripolis, and Ptolemais. In May, 1291, the latter, and the most important, fell into the hands of the Sultan of Egypt, after which the remainder either surrendered peaceably, or were captured.\n\nGeography of Modern Times (Plate. 13)\n\nPlate 13 represents Europe before the French Revolution (1789). The political arrangement of Europe in the above-mentioned year, differed essentially from that which prevails at the present day.\n\nGermany, with Joseph II. for it’s head, consisted at that time of more than three hundred greater and smaller states, most of which were distributed in the ten circles of Maximilian I. Six of these were defined by this emperor in 1500, at the imperial diet of Augsburg, namely, those of Franconia, Bavaria, Swabia, the Upper Rhine, Westphalia, and Saxony; the remaining four were added at the diet of Cologne, in 1512, viz. those of Austria, Burgundy, the Lower Rhine, and Upper Saxony: this arrangement was confirmed at the diet of Worms and Nürnberg, in 1521 and 1522. The distribution into circles was, however, very incomplete, owing to its not including all the positions in the empire. The components of the individual circles were as follows:\n\nThe Austrian Circle, the largest of all, had only the following nobility: the Archduke of Austria (who, for centuries, was both Roman emperor and king of Germany), the Bishops of Trent and Brixen, the German Orders and the Princes of Dietrichstein.

7, several places owned and ruled in common by more than one family; 8, six free villages, and the free people in Swabia occupying thirty-nine villages and hamlets.\n\nBesides Germany, Europe in 1789 contained the following states, of which eight (including the Electoral Monarchy of Poland) were republics, and one under the order of St. John; the remainder were ruled by two emperors, one Grand Sultan, nine kings, one pope, one grand duke, three dukes, and one prince.\n\nThe Kingdom of Portugal, in its present extent, only arranged differently.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain, likewise of its present limits, and divided into twenty-nine provinces: Madrid, Toledo, Cuenca, Guadalajara, and LaMancha (New Castile); Burgos, Soria, Segovia, Avila (Old Castile); Leon, Palencia, Toro, Valladolid, Zamora; Salamanca (kingdom of Leon); kingdom of Granada or Upper Andalusia; kingdom of Galicia; Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Jaen (Lower Andalusia);

They consisted of seven smaller republics or sovereign states: Guelderland, Holland, Seeland, Utrecht, Friesland, Oberyssel, and Groningen, with Drenthe. In addition to these were portions of Brabant (cap. Herzogenbusch), Antwerp (cap. Breda), Guelderland (cap. Venloo), and Flanders, which had been conquered by the seven united provinces, A hereditary Stattholder stood at the head of the common republic.\n\nThe Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in its present extent and arrangement, although not united into a single government with one parliament. The islands of Helgoland and Malta at that time did not belong to England.\n\nThe United Kingdom of Denmark and Norway, each in its present arrangement and extent. Of the latter, only the Faroes remain to Denmark. The Island of Helgoland, now English, belonged to Denmark up to 1814.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden, at that time united with Finnland and not with Norway, was divided into five sections; 1, Sweden proper, subdivided into Upland, Sodermannland, Nerike, Westmannland, and Dalarne or Dalecarlia; 2, the Gothic dominion, divided into eastern, western, and southern; 3, Norrland or Nordland; 4, Swedish Lapland; 5, Finnland. In addition to this, the crown held in Germany a portion of Pomerania, with the island of Rügen, and Wismar, at present a town of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe Russian Empire. The extent of this empire, in 1789, was much less than at the present time, as it did not include the following countries: Finnland, with a part of Lappland, Curland, Poland with Lithuania, Volhynia with Podolia, Bessarabia, Moldavia east of Pruth, and the greater part of the region of the Caucasus, It was divided into the following sections: 1, St. Petersburg or Ingermannland; 2, Riga or Livonia; 3, Reval or Esthonia; 4, Wiburg or Carelia, with a part of Finnland; 5, Olonetz; 6, Archangel; 7, Novogorod; 8, Pleskow; 9, Twer; 10, Jaroslau; 11, Wologda; 12, Kostroma; 13, Wjatka; 14, Perm; 15, Tobolsk; 16, Moscow; 17, Tula; 18, Kaluga; 19, Smolensk or White Russia; 20, Polozk, and 21, Mohilew (these two were taken from Lithuania in 1772); 22, Orel; 23, Novogorod-Sawersk; 24, Tschernigow; 25, Charkow; 26, Kursk; 27, Woronesch; 28, Rjasan; 29, Wladimir; 30, Tambow; 31, Saratow; 32, Pensa; 33, Nischnei-Novogorod; 34, Simbirsk; 35, Kasan; 36, Ufa, with the province of Orenburg; 37, Koly wan; 38, Irkutsk; 39, Kiew; 40, lekaterinoslaw; 41, Tauria or the Krimea; 42, Caucasus, consisting of the provinces Caucasus (cap. Asow), and Astrachan.\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia (at one time a duchy, but a kingdom since 1701). This was divided into East and West Prussia, the latter consisting of the portion of Poland ceded to Russia in 1772.\n\nThe Republic or the Elective Monarchy of Poland was divided into three principal portions: 1, Great or Lower Poland containing the Vayvode-ships of Posen, Kalisch, Gnesen, Sieradz, Wielun, Rawa, Lenczyc, Brzesc, Inowraclaw, and Dobrzin (these three formed the district Cujavier), Plock, Masuren, also the town of Dantzig (almost entirely independent, however), and Thorn; 2, Lesser or Upper Poland, with the Vayvodeships of Cracow, Sandomir, Lublin, Podlachia (capital Bielsk), Chelm, Volhynia (cap. Luck), Podolia (cap. Kaminiec Podolski), Lithuania, and Kijow (part of the Ukraine); 3, Grand Duchy Lithuania, consisting of Lithuania Proper (cap. Wilna), Lithuanian Russia (Podlesia, Black Russia, and a part of White Russia), and Samogitia.\n\nThe Duchy of Courland and Semgallia had its own duke, but was subject to Poland.\n\nThe Austrian Dominions beyond Germany and Italy were much as at present, excepting that Galicia was smaller, and the greater part of Dalmatia was wanting: 1, the kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (previously the principalities Halitsch and Wladimir, forming Red Russia, and torn in 1772 from the Repiiblic of Poland) excepting Cracow, but including Bukowina taken from the Turks in 1777; 2, kingdom of Hungary with the kingdoms of Slavonia and Syrmia, Croatia and Dalmatia, arranged in ten provinces; Raab, Pesth, Neutra, Funfkirchen, Agram, Grosswardein, Neusohl, Munkatsch, Kaschau, Temesch (Banat); 3, the Croatian and Slavonian Military Limits; 4, the Grand Duchy Siebenbürgen.\n\nThe Republic of Ragusa under the protection of the Grand Turk, and tributary to him, now belonging to Austria as a part of Dahnatia.\n\nThe Turkish Empire, whose European dominions at that time embraced Bessarabia and that portion of Moldavia lying on the left or eastern bank of the Pruth, both subsequently ceded to Russia; also, the present kingdom of Greece. The now nearly independent Principality of Servia, at that time (to 1801) formed a viceroyalty.\n\nItaly, with which we here conclude, embraced the following states, excluding the island of Corsica, which belonged to France. 1. Kingdom of Sardinia, consisting of the Duchies of Savoy (embracing Chablais, Faucigny, Genevois, Tarantaise, and Maurienne) and Montserrat, the Principality of Piedmont (with the Duchy of Aosta and the County of Nizza), a portion of the Duchy of Milan, and the island of Sardinia. 2.

Her dominions embraced, in Italy, the Duchy of Venice, the provinces of Padua, Bassano, Verona, Vicenza, Brescia, Bergamo, Erema, the peninsula Rovigo, the Mark of Treviso, the District of Friaul and Istria. Out of Italy the Venetian possessions consisted of parts of Dalmatia (Zara, Sebenigo, Trau, Spalatro, and islands), Albania, and the seven Ionian Islands: all these, excepting the last, are Austrian. 7. The Republic of Genoa: her territory was divided into the Riviera di Levante or the eastern part, the Riviera di Ponente or the western part, and Finale; it now constitutes the Sardinian Duchy of Genoa. 8. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany, divided into the old state or the Grand Duchy proper (Florence, Pisa, and Livorno), and the new state or Siena, acquired in 1557. 9.

The Republic of Lucca, and 11, Republic of San Marino. 12. The kingdom of the two Sicilies, consisting of the kingdoms of Naples and of Sicily. The former was divided into twelve districts: Terra di Lavoro, Principato Citra, Principato Ultra, Basilicato or Matera, Northern Calabria, Southern do.. Terra d’Otranto, Terra di Bari, Capitanata, the Abruzzi, Teramo. Sicily was divided into three districts, Val di Mazzara (cap. Palermo), Val Demone (cap. Messina), and Val di Noto (cap. Catania). Besides these, the king of the Sicilies possessed the Stato degli Presidi, consisting of the Principality Piombino and the island Elba, now united to Tuscany. 13. The Islands of Malta, Gozzo, and Comino, possessed by the Order of Knights of St. John, to whom they had been given by Charles V.\n\nSpecial or Political Geography\n\nEurope (Plate. 14)\n\nThe greater portion of the population of Europe belongs to the Indo-European race, and is divisible into the following families: 1, the Germanic or Teutonic, over sixty millions, in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Denmark, Scandinavia, &lc.; 2, the Grseco-Latinic, over seventy-two millions, in Greece, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Portugal: 3, the Slavonian, over seventy-eight millions, in Russia, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, &c.\n\nLess numerous families are the Celtic (about nine millions, in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales); the Lettonian (Lithuania, Livonia, Esthonia, about two millions), the Semitic (two millions and a half, Israelites, and 60,000 Moriscoes, or descendants of the Spanish Moors), the Basques in Spain, and the Gipsies or Zigeuni (300,000).\n\nTo the Tartar stock belong the Turks (about two millions), and the Tartars (in Russia).\n\nTo the Ural stock belong the Finns (with the Lapps) and the Hungarians or Magyars (about eight millions in all).\n\nIn its political division, Europe embraces fifty-five independent states, namely: 1. Three empires: Russia, Austria, and Turkey. 2. Fifteen kingdoms: Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands, Great Britain and Ireland, Sweden and Norway, Denmark, Prussia, Hanover, Saxony, Bavaria, Wiirtemberg, Sardinia, the two Sicilies, and Greece. 3.

Eight Republics: France, Switzerland, Hamburg, Bremen, Lübeck, Frankfort on the Maine, San Marino, and the Ionian Islands. To these should properly be added the semi-sovereign states of Servia, Moldavia, Wallachia, the Republic of Andorra in the Pyrenees, &c.\n\nPortugal (Plate. 21)\n\nPortugal extends from 6° 15′ to 9° 30′ longitude west of Greenwich (8° 9′ to 12° longitude east of Ferro, as given in the map), and from 36° 55′ to 42° 13′ N. Lat. It is bounded on the north and east by Spain, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean; and including the Azores, occupies about 27,552 square geographical miles.\n\nThe greater portion of the land forms a highland, with rugged mountains; the most northern part, however, is an elevated terrace. Some of the individual mountains are: in the north, Serra de Suazo, S. de Santa Lucia, S. de Gerez, S. de Cahreira, S. de Marao, S. de Quadrasal, S. de Noguiera; in the centre, S. de Acoba or Caramujo, S. de Estrella (the highest), S. Mansa, S. de Anciao, S. de Moradal, S. Brava, S. de Melrica, S. Aire, S. Albardos, Monte Cantaro, M. Junto, S. Patelo, S. do Minde, S. Montachique, S. de Portalegre, S. de Arrabida; in the south, S. de S. Joao, S. de Ossa, Monte Maro, S. Aboleira, S. de Grandola, the Algarbian boundary mountain, S. de Cadeiro, S. de Monchique, S. de Figueira, M. Figo.\n\nThe principal rivers are as follows: 1. The Minho, which forms the northern boundary between Portugal and Spain, 2. The Douro, upon which Oporto is situated. Tributaries on the right, Sabor, Tua, Tamega; on the left, Coa, Tavoa, Pavia. 3. Tagus or Tejo, the most important stream, with Lisbon situated at its mouth: it is navigable as far as Abrantes. Tributaries on the right, Ponsel, Zezere; on the left Zatas or Sorraya, Canha. 4. Guadiana, which in its lower part forms portion of the boundary between Spain, navigable to Martola. Rivers along the coast: 5. Lima empties at Viana. 6. Cavado. 7. Bouga. 8. Mondego. 9. Sado.\n\nSouthern fruits of various kinds form the principal products, also wine and grain. Sheep are raised in considerable numbers, and the fisheries are important. Mining is almost entirely unknown.\n\nIn 1836, the population, excluding Lisbon and the islands, amounted to 3,061,684, divided into 380 Concelhos or congregations, 4034 parishes, and 791,492 families or hearths. The census of 1838 gave 3,224,174 inhabitants in 382 congregations, 3692 parishes, and 827,947 families: that of 1841, 3,412,500 heads, in 386 congregations, 3737 parishes, 847,343 families. The Azores, with the islands of Madeira and Porto Santa, have 330,500 inhabitants in 11 comarcas, 34 congregations, 163 parishes, 76,430 families. This makes 3,743,000 souls for the entire European population. These are mostly of Jewish or Moorish descent, speak a language closely allied to the Spanish, but mixed with many Arabic words, and abounding in nasal sounds. The religion is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe kingdom of Portugal is a constitutional monarchy, ruled by prinees of the House of Braganza (at present Maria II., born 1819), under the constitution granted in 1826 by Don Pedro. The supreme ruler shares the government with two chambers, which assemble annually, and which consist, the one of members chosen by the crown, the other of members elected by the people.\n\nThe state revenue, according to the estimates of 1848–49, amounts to about sixteen millions of dollars. The army embraces 28,100 soldiers, of which only 18,000 are m service. There are 9000 soldiers in the colonies. The navy consists of two ships of the line, six frigates, eight corvettes, eleven brigs, seven schooners, two steam- vessels, &c.\n\nSub-divisions. I. Kingdom of Portugal with six provinces: 1. Estremadura, with 780,000 inhabitants, divided into the three circles, Lisbon, Santarem, and Leira. Here is situated the capital city and royal residence, Lisbon or Lisboa, on the right bank of the Tagus, with 260,000 inabitants. 2. Lower Beira, population 330,000. 3. Upper Beira, population 290,000; circles, Coimbra, Aveiro, Lamego, Guarda. 4. Entre Minho e Douro, population 1,300,000; circles, Porto, Braga, Viana.

Flores, population 15,000. 9. Corvo, population 1000.\n\nPortugal owns the following islands, which, however, belong geographically to Africa. 1. Madeira, capital Funchal, and 2, Porto Santo, the two with 116,000 inhabitants. 3. The ten islands of the Cape de Verdes, population 70,000.\n\nThe colonies of Portugal are: 1. In Africa, settlements on the west coast (Guinea) with the island Bissago; the islands of St. Thomas and do Principe, with 20,000 inhabitants; the islands of Mozambique on the east coast, and the eleven Admiralty Islands. 2. In Asia: East Indies (coast of Malabar), Goa, the towns of Diu and Damaun; Macao, on the coast of China, population 38,000, and the greater portion of Timor.\n\nSpain (Plate. 21)\n\nSpain is situated between the parallels of 36° and 43° 46′ N. lat., and the meridians 3° 17′ east and 9° 30′ west from Greenwich. It is bounded on the north by the Bay of Biscay and France, west by the Atlantic and Portugal, south and east by the Mediterranean and Atlantic. The area amounts to about 183,600 square statute miles.\n\nThe interior of Spain is a highland of from 2000 to 3000 feet, traversed by mountains, and separated by one grand range into a southern and northern portion, the plateaus of New and Old Castile. About the highland are districts of less elevation, also surrounded by mountains. A range of mountains, about 360 miles in length, traverses the extreme north of Spain, the boundary between this country and France being lormed by a portion of about two hundred miles in length, and known as the Pyrenees. The western continuation of the Pyrenees cor-stitutes the Cantabrian Mountains, to the west of which join on the Asturean. To the north-west, west of the Minho, we find the mountain terrace of the Paranneras. The principal mountain in the interior is the Sierra de Guadarama, separating the Duero from the Tagus, to which are joined on the west, the Sierras de Gredos, de Bajar, and de Gata: to the east, the Sierras de Ayllon, de Solorio, de Cuena, de MoHna, and de Albarracin. Between the Tagus and Guadiana are situated the mountains of Toledo, the Sierras de Guadalupe, de San Mamed, &c. The Sierra Morena forms the water-shed between the Guadiana and Guadalquiver, in conjunction with the Sierras de Aroche, de Almaden, de Alcaraz, de Constantina, Sagra, &c. Lastly, in the southern parts of Spain exist the loftiest mountains in the whole country, the Sierra Nevada or the mountains of Granada. Particular portions of the Sierra Nevada are: in the west. Sierras de Ronda, de Malaga, de Almijaras; in the east, the Alpujarras, the Sierras del Rallo, de Filabres, de Cabrera, de Aljamilla, &c.\n\nSpain possesses six principal rivers, of which five empty into the Atlantic, and one into the Mediterranean. This latter is the Ebro, which rises in the Cantabrian Mountains, is navigable to Tudela, and empties into the sea below Tortosa. Tributaries, Aragon, Xalon, Gallegro, Segre. The Atlantic streams are: 1. The Miño (Portuguese Minho), which, like the last, rises in the Cantabrian Mountains, and in the lower part of its course forms the boundary between Spain and Portugal. 2. The Duero (Portuguese Douro) rises in the Castilian range, and flows through Portugal to the ocean. Tributaries, Pisuerga, Esla, Tormes. 3. The Guadiana comes from the Sierra de Albarracin, and empties into the ocean at Lisbon. Tributaries, Xarama, Alagon. 4. The Guadiana rises in the Sierra d’Alcaraz, has its course partly in Portugal, and is not navigable. Tributary, Giquela. 5. The Guadalquiver rises in the Sierra Sagra, and is navigable to Cordova. Tributaries, Guadalimar and Xenil.\n\nThe climate of Spain is as unequal as its elevation above the sea; rude in Galacia, mild in Valencia and Murcia, and oppressively hot in Andalusia and Granada. The principal exports are wines, raisins, grapes, oranges, figs, almonds, and oil. The usual grains are wheat, rice, Indian corn, and barley. Sheep and horses are raised in large numbers, mules and goats are abundant. The silkworm is much cultivated in the south. The most important metals are silver, mercury, lead, and iron: there are also stone coal, salt, alum, vitriol, saltpetre, marble, and alabaster.\n\nThe inhabitants amounted, in 1836, to 12,386,841, at present the number is about 14,000,000. The interior provinces are much less thickly inhabited than the northern. The population is distributed among 16,990 towns, villages, and hamlets, forming 18,871 parishes. The Spaniards are a mixture of aborigines, Romans, Phoenicians, West-Goths, Arabians, Vandals, &c. There are also over 500,000 Basques in the north-east, about 60,000 Moriscoes in the south, and above 40,000 Zigeuni. The principal language is the Spanish, a branch of the Romanic; of its dialects, the Castilian is used in writing. The Basques have a very peculiar language of their own. Prevailing religion the Roman Catholic.\n\nForm of Government. The kingdom of Spain is ruled by a line of the House of Bourbon (now Isabella II., born 1830). The constitutional government dates from 1837, although it experienced important modifications in 1844. The Cortes or Chamber of Lawgivers is divided into a Senate and a Congress.\n\nThe revenues of the state amounted, in 1848, to 1,257,780,000 reals, or about 62,890,000 dollars.\n\nThe army consists of 99,000 troops of the line. The navy, in 1846, embraced three ships of the line, six frigates, five corvettes, six brigs, two brig-galliots, six galliots, six steamships, &c.\n\nDivisions. Since 1833, the monarchy, with the exception of the Canary Islands, has been divided into forty-nine provinces, which, in the following exposition, we shall classify under the arrangement which prevailed prior to 1833. They have most generally names similar to those of their capitals, for which reason the latter are mentioned only when the name is different.\n\nNew Castile. 1.
