        "text": "Soundtrack: Johann Simon Mayr - Le Due Duchesse - Overture\n\n*Exterior* *Chateau de Compiègne* *cut to seeing the royal hunting party-led by the comte d'Artois- crashing through the trees in pursuit of a deer* [1]\n\n*Cut to a carriage bowling along with Louis XVIII [1]* *opposite the king sits the little Napoléon II* *between two leading members of the Bonaparte court: Josèphine and Hortense de Beauharnais* *in a calèche, some ways behind follows Hortense's sons alongside Ferdinand, Duc de Chartres and Louis, Duc de Nemours*\n\n*Both women seem to be enjoying whatever conversation they're having with Louis [2]*\n\n*Cut to interior of the chateau* *clearly the council room* *present are all the senior males of the royal family- Artois, both his sons, the aged princes de Condé and Conti [3] and his son, the duc de Bourbon- less the duc d'Orléans*\n\nLouis XVIII: as your Highnesses are no doubt aware, the time is drawing near for our emissaries to depart for Vienna and there is an important matter to discuss before we do-\n\nArtois: should the Duc d'Orléans not be present?\n\nLouis XVIII: so he can tell the czar what we wish to do ahead of time?\n\nArtois: and yet you trust Prince Talleyrand to speak for us?\n\nLouis XVIII: we do not trust Talleyrand, but he is far more in tune with what is happening in Europe than any of us can claim to be.\n\n*clear grumbles about this*\n\nLouis XVIII: since we have discussed the matter at length and we grow weary of this repetitive topic, are we all in agreement that Monseigneur François is not to be returned to Austrian custody if it can be helped.\n\nAngoulême: your Majesty is not concerned that the English will support the Austrians in this matter?\n\nLouis XVIII: while I have no doubt that the English may...prefer to keep an ace up their sleeve in the form of Monseigneur François, my talks with both Lord Aberdeen and Castlereagh, and the duke of Wellington suggests that they are weary of war. They no more want a Napoléon to return to power in France than we do.\n\nAngoulême: *nods*\n\nLouis XVIII: which brings us to the matter of General Bonaparte himself.\n\nArtois: the matter of money?\n\nLouis XVIII: *looks at his brother in surprise*\n\nArtois: he is demanding the two million francs he is promised. *to Louis* General Tascher de la Pagerie [4] told Charlot [5] that that both his cousin and his wife's uncle [6] had received letters to that effect from General Bonaparte.\n\nLouis XVIII: *looks at the duc de Berri, clearly annoyed at having his moment stolen*\n\nBerri: *looks completely unbothered by this*\n\nLouis XVIII: the question of this...bribe- and let us be clear, this is a bribe-\n\nCondé: it's a mark of tribute, sire. As though to some Asiatic khan.\n\nLouis XVIII: *nods*\n\nArtois: *to Conti* when Bonaparte was First Consul, what was the pension he settled on your Serene Highness?\n\nConti: *produces a notebook* *he's clearly written this down* *he pages to the right entry* in 1797, the Directoire awarded me an annual allowance of fifty-thousand francs. *looks up* seldom paid and often late. *pages on* in 1804, First Consul Bonaparte awarded me double that, one hundred thousand francs annually. But it too was seldom paid and when there were French troops in Spain, it wasn't paid at all [7]. Even when I had to billet those troops in my own house.\n\nLouis XVIII: is there a point to this, brother?\n\nArtois: during our exile, we had no island to call home, we lived in the health-and-well-being of the sovereign as any vizier does the sultan. The Prince Regent of England refused to receive us, the emperor of Russia turned you out at Mittau as soon as it became inconvenient for him...and by God's grace we were able to undertake necessary economies to survive. And now General Bonaparte is whining because his allowance of two millions is late?\n\nLouis XVIII: they were promised to him, brother.\n\nBourbon: if I may...your Majesty...the emperor currently has an army of a thousand men on Elba. Those thousand men must...quite naturally...be paid. He has ships ...which...quite naturally...are expensive. He holds his court in Elba as a miniature of that he held in Paris...that is expensive. He was allowed [8] to ship all his carriages and his horses to the island, in order to reside in the state to which he has become accustomed. [9] That is a further expense. We were given no province we could tax in order to pay for our livelihood. We paid our troops as best as we were able, and when we are no longer able to support them, many loyal soldiers were forced to seek employment in other armies. It is my fear, that should your Majesty decide to pay this allowance- as would be your Majesty's right- it will only encourage men to flock to Bonaparte's side. And when he is able to recruit enough men...he will leave Elba and march on Paris. Whether your Majesty pays or does not pay, the result will be the same.\n\n*several murmurs of agreement*\n\nBerri: *slowly* and it would also not be wise to forward so much money when the treasury is empty and the Prussians are talking of demanding reparations from France\n\nLouis XVIII: *irritably* was that we promised to rename the Pont d'Iena not enough [10]? *aside* The do not wish to kill the injured cow, simply bleed it dry. *to the table* which brings us to the matter of what to do with the Bonapartes.\n\nConti: I understood that your Majesty had closed this topic with the decision of the usurper's son.\n\nLouis XVIII: there are still other Bonapartes, cousin. And Bonaparte allies- the Murats and the Bernadottes-\n\nBerri: General Tascher de la Pagerie's joining our side would be an indicator to the Clary's- and Bernadotte- that we will not challenge the choice of the king of Sweden by supporting King Gustaf.\n\nLouis XVIII: *sighs* we had no intention of challenging the choice- however distasteful we find it.\n\nArtois: and what of his brother-in-law in Spain?\n\nLouis XVIII: what of him?\n\nArtois: does your Majesty intend to support him against our cousin, King Charles?\n\nLouis XVIII: Cousin Conti...how much support did King Charles lend you during your stay in Barcelona?\n\nConti: not a sou, sire.\n\nLouis XVIII: we will not support Bonaparte's brother, but we see no reason to support that fat buffoon or his idiot son-\n\nAngoulême: is that also why your Majesty is in favour of Murat in Naples?\n\nLouis XVIII: Murat in Naples is a good way of ensuring that the south of Italy remains on friendly terms with France.\n\nBerri: I am told that the grand duchess of Tuscany is currently at Montpellier...she is hoping that your Majesty will agree to support her in her efforts to retain Lucca [11] if she cannot hang on to Tuscany.\n\nLouis XVIII: to what end?\n\nAngoulême: the same reason as Murat in Naples, uncle. At present, from what I've heard, Prince Metternich wishes to colour the entire north of Italy- excepting Savoie- Habsburg. Lucca being a French-friendly state in the region could certainly be useful.\n\nLouis XVIII: it's coastline also means that should the usurper leave Elba- as Cousin Condé suggests seems likely- landing in Lucca is the most likely place.\n\nBourbon: her other request is for the principality of Piombino, which is further from France but nearer to Elba.\n\nLouis XVIII: *clearly irritable* money, land, titles...these Bonapartes behave as if somehow they are owed all of this by mere dint of their nephew being in my care. At least the Beauharnais requests [12] are manageable.\n\n*fade to black*\n\n[1] both habits they were known for. Charles was nicknamed \"Robin des Bois\" (Robin Hood) by his subjects for spending so much time in the woods hunting. And Louis XVIII was known as what would nowadays be termed a \"speed freak\" as he loved going for drives with the fastest teams of horses in the stables.\n\n[2] Napoléon wasn't exactly known for his drawing room skills. The sort of man- like Pierre from War and Peace- who \"had not the slightest idea of how to enter a drawing room. Still less how to leave one.\" Louis XVIII was known as a witty conversationalist. Even if both mother and daughter ARE pretending or sucking up, it's no doubt considerably less than they had to with Napoléon.\n\n[3] the prince de Conti died in March 1814, but I can't find a cause of death (i.e. that he'd been ill before that), so it's not impossible he gets a few months longer. Condé was two years younger than him and made it to 1818.\n\n[4] Jean Henri Robert Tascher de la Pagerie, cousin of Josephine and a general in the army. At the Restauration, the duc de Berri attempted to coax both Jean \"Bon-Amour\" and his brother, Pierre \"Fanfan\" to remain in France and join the royalist army. Jean was reportedly considering it before the Hundred Days.\n\n[5] the duc de Berri\n\n[6] Jean's wife is Marcelle Clary, niece of both Désirée and Julie Clary\n\n[7] I can't find if either of these allowances were paid (promptly or not), but given that the French state regularly needed the money elsewhere, I imagine paying an allowance to an old prince wasn't top of priorities. Bathilde d'Orléans, Duchesse de Bourbon, was promised the same allowances and they were never paid (although she refused to accept the 1804 increase from her son's murderer), so she had to resort to running a sort of pharmacy out of where she was staying in Barcelona. Her home in Barcelona was also used to billet French troops, so it's not impossible that her uncle, the prince de Conti, was subject to the same indignity\n\n[8] yes. Napoléon also had a \"mini-fleet\" of several ships, although the \"flagship\" was a two-masted brig \"L'Inconstant\"\n\nthe two things of quintessential importance on Elba were the household and the military administration, the household costing only 10% less than the military. The remaining civil administration (‘intendance’, tribunals, the imperial receiver, post office, church, roads, mine administration, and tax collection) was funded at 90% less than either of these.\n\nand\n\nloyal soldiers of the elite Garde impériale (both infantry and cavalry) came from France and represented by far the biggest expense on the island.\n\n[9] Pons l’Héraut writes, in a chapter on Napoleon’s coaches on Elba, the Frenchman noted that “the emperor brought in his train a quantity of fine coaches and horses, which could only have been an annoying complication and excessive expense for a temporary establishment”\n\n[10] OTL, when the Prussians were in Paris, they planned to blow up the Pont d'Iena. Louis sent one of his people to \"sit there\" the whole day to prevent them doing it, while he convinced the czar that he'd \"rename it\". Also, Prussia was the only one of the allies who were proposing reparations- 1.2 billion francs- from France at the congress of Chatillon already. The later sum agreed between the allies was originally 800 million and argued down by the French to 700 million.\n\n[11] Elisa was in Montpelier in May and Graz in August (where she gave birth to her son, Fédéric). It's not impossible that, with her nephew in Louis XVIII's custody, she puts off travelling\n\n[12] Hortense's main request OTL was that she be allowed to remain in France and keep custody of her sons. Eugène wrote that he had resolved to \"peaceably the fate that the allied powers would be pleased to grant [him].\" And his main concern was not for his own future, but for that of his wife \"As for me, I came up by such a humble staircase that I will suffer no harm going back down. I feel sorrow only for my wife, who was born and brought up a Princess.\" Not sure what Josèphine's request would be, but I imagine it would be similar to Hortense's: she be allowed to remain in France, perhaps be allowed to return to Malmaison (from whence she'd been banished when Napoléon married Marie Louise; despite it being her house, she was only allowed to stay in Paris at the emperor's suffrance).\n\nSoundtrack: Joseph Weigl - Die Jugend Peter des Grosses - Heil mir! Ich werde liebe finden\n\n*Vienna* *we see Emperor Franz, Empress Marie Luise and Metternich returning to Vienna to cheering crowds* *the way the city is set up is as though they had just returned from a victorious military campaign*\n\n*cut to them in the imperial box at the Kärntnertortheater [1] for a production of Beethoven's Creatures of Prometheus* *preceded by the audience singing in full throat \"God Save the Emperor Francis\"*\n\n*cut to the next day* *Metternich's carriage, followed by a baggage train, on the road to Baden bei Wien [2]*\n\n*Vienna* *Palais Questenberg-Kaunitz* *we see Talleyrand's carriage stopping outside on the Johannesgaße* *we see two servants lifting a box from a cart* *next thing we see that the box is lying in the street and there is straw and...pots- rather than documents or something \"valuable\"* *the servants are being scolded by a man in French*\n\nTalleyrand: *calmly as he descends from his carriage* *to the man scolding them* Monsieur Carème [3], I fully share your distress- I told his Most Christian Majesty that I have no need for instructions, only saucepans [4] when embarking- but there is no need to cause such a scene. I'm sure there is no damage to the pans and if there is, I doubt we shall have to send to Paris for replacements.\n\n*Compiègne* *we see Napoléon II at the desk in the chateau's salon circulaire [5]* *he is clearly concentrating hard on whatever it is he's drawing at the desk* *Madame Royal and Auguste Amalie of Bavaria [6], Vicereine of Italy, are seated at the table playing cards* *Angoulême and Eugène de Beauharnais are playing chess, Berri is seated on a chair alongside them, keeping up an obliging chatter about the army*\n\n*cut to Compiègne's throne room [7]* *Louis XVIII is sitting on the throne, with the rest of a sort of mongrel court of both Napoléonic names- Ney and Berthier- and the faubourg Saint-Germain- Richelieu and Montmorency- gathered around him* *amongst the crowd, we also see both Josephine and Hortense de Beauharnais, the duc and duchesse d'Orléans and Désirée Clary, Hereditary Princess of Sweden* *Désirée seems to be perfectly charmed by the conversation that she is having with the comte d'Artois [8]*\n\nFootman: his Excellency, the Russian ambassador, Comte Pozzo di Borgo!\n\nArtois: *to Désirée* it's a funny old world. To see one of our subjects, born in Corsica [9], and now the emissary of his most barbaric majesty, the tsar of all the Russias\n\nDésiréee: be warned of this one, your Royal Highness, he hates Bonaparte even more than you and your family does. When Bonaparte was in Russia, he was the one behind the suggestion from the tsar that Jean divorce me to marry the tsar's sister [10]\n\nArtois: divorce a delightful woman such as yourself, Madame? *conspiratorial grin* Perish the thought.\n\n*Pozzo di Borgo bows low before Louis XVIII*\n\nLouis XVIII: your Excellency, we bid you welcome to Paris\n\nPozzo di Borgo: I am most grateful to be here, sire. To see you, once more, seated on your rightful throne.\n\nLouis XVIII: we thank you for your kind words. We trust you will reassure our most beloved brother, the tsar, of our warm wishes and noble intentions towards him. *slightly sharper tone* And that we harbour no ill will towards him for his behaviour towards us [11]. Especially since, like ourselves and France, he has suffered the predations of the usurper's armies.\n\nPozzo di Borgo: my master thanks your Most Christian Majesty for his warm wishes, and hopes that he is able to be of service in any manner towards your Majesty.\n\nLouis XVIII: *makes motion like \"continue\"*\n\nPozzo di Borgo: his Majesty wishes to propose a union between our two families. So as to cement the bonds of friendship between us, and that we may both look together towards a shared future\n\nLouis XVIII: we should be happy to oblige his Majesty inasmuch as we are able to do so\n\nPozzo di Borgo: *takes a miniature from his pocket and hands it to the duc de Blacas to give to the king* his Majesty would suggest a match between his youngest sister, the lovely Anne, and your Majesty's nephew, the duc de Berri. To symbolize our bond of friendship to the entirety of Europe.\n\nJosephine: *to Hortense behind her fan* isn't that the same sister that Bonaparte wanted?\n\nHortense: it is. -still, better her than the Princess Oldenburgsky...according to some of Louis' men in Amsterdam, she has her cap set at the Prince of Orange's son [12].\n\nLouis XVIII: and what would his Majesty wish from us- aside from our nephew's hand in marriage, of course- in exchange for this...deepening of the bonds of friendship?\n\nPozzo di Borgo: both Prussia and Austria are planning- nay plotting- against my master. To force him to make concessions that he feels are well within his rights to refuse-\n\nLouis XVIII: *sly smile* would these concessions be regarding the matter of Poland?\n\nPozzo di Borgo: *clearly surprised but presses on* both Prussia and Austria wish to push for a complete renunciation of all Russian territories in Poland, to return to the borders of 1795-\n\nLouis XVIII: in this, his Majesty is not alone. They wish for France to return to her borders of 1789 as well.\n\nPozzo di Borgo: then your Majesty agrees with how unjust it is to suffer punitive actions at the hands of your enemies when you have done nothing to deserve such punishments.\n\nLouis XVIII: of course, Monsieur l'Ambassadeur. *hands miniature back to Blacas* how could we possibly side with the Prussians- who so lately have not only expressed their animosity towards us by wishing to destroy buildings in Paris and attempting to side with the emperor [13]-\n\n*several shocked gasps*\n\nLouis XVIII: but also that they wish to absorb the entirety of our most beloved mother's homeland of Saxony and drive our cousin, the king of Saxony, from his court yet again as they did in her lifetime [14].\n\n*more shocked gasps*\n\nLouis XVIII: and still they wish to impose financial obligations on our crown for dues they say we owe to them. Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, we understand your master's concerns regarding the Prussians entirely.\n\n*cut to Elba* *we see Napoléon having his usual \"salon\" after Mass, with Madame Mère and Princess Borghese flanking him on either side*\n\n*Cut to his return to his apartments*\n\nMéneval: there is a letter from Paris, your Majesty.\n\nNapoléon: from that fat pig?\n\nMéneval: from your son, sire.\n\nNapoléon: *grabs letter from Méneval eagerly*\n\nV/o: bonjour papa, comment? Ça va. Things are different now that mama has gone home to Vienna. Bomma Josèphine et Tante Thérèse still take me for drives in the Bois de Boulogne. Sometimes Bompa Gros lets me go with him. Oncle Toinon [15] was talking about how next summer he wants to teach me to ride my own pony so I can go with he and Oncle Eugène to inspect the soldiers comme ton papa. Tononcle Charles said that if I can ride by when Oncle Charlot gets married, I can ride in the parade by myself.\n\n*We see Napoléon's frown deepening as he reads further*\n\nV/o: Papa, please find enclosed fifty gold francs. I heard Maréchal Berthier saying you didn't have enough money. This is all my savings from selling vegetables from my garden [16]. Please take it, my most cherished papa, and I will try to send more when I have. Much love, Monseigneur le Roi de Rome.\n\nNapoléon: *watches as Méneval empties a purse of gold coins onto the table*\n\nMéneval: *starts arranging the coins in piles of ten*\n\nJosephine v/o: *postcript* The tsar sends you his best wishes, Bonaparte. His sister, Anne, is to marry the duc de Berri. Yours, Josèphine. Please find enclosed a drawing your son did*\n\nNapoléon: *unfolds the drawing* *while it's little more than stick figures, we can see that an adult (Josèphine?) has taken the time to caption each*\n\n*In the drawing, Napoléon II is standing between two grown ups* *both with blond hair and labelled \"Madame Royal\" and \"Msgr D.Angoulême\"* *flanking them is a man, denoted as fat by his \"figure\" being two circles one on top of another, like a snowman* *on the other side of him are two stick figures labelled \"Artois\" and \"Berri\"* *on the opposite flank of Napoléon II with Madame Royal and Angoulême, are three more women and another man* *labelled Josèphine, Tante Hortense, Tante Auguste, Oncle Eugène* *finally, at the extreme edge of the page, separated by a blue squiggle symbolizing the sea, stand a man and a woman labelled \"Mama\" and \"Papa\"*\n\nNapoléon: *glares down at the page* *his face flitting from angry to hurt to furious*\n\n*Fade to black as we see the emperor dash the coins from the table in a rage*\n\n[1] until the Burgtheater was built in the reign of Franz Joseph, the court theater was at the Kärntnertor. And the Creatures of Prometheus was written for their return with runs extended when the allies came to town in September.\n\n[2] for most of the summer of 1814, Metternich retired to Baden bei Wien to avoid the countless petitioners, the \"all Europe is in my antechamber\" complaint dates from this time, at the Chancellery in Vienna. Also, he was reportedly \"exhausted\" due to the events of Paris. With him, he took his mistress, with whom, over the summer, he had several corking rows over the indiscretion of her affair with Frederick Lamb (yup, Melbourne's little brother), and his secretary, who had second-stage PTSD due to having to listen to both sides repeating the fights to him.\n\n[3] Antoine Carème, creator of \"caramel\", was Talleyrand's personal chef and accompanied him to Vienna OTL\n\n[4] this is was Talleyrand's response when Louis XVIII presented him with his instructions for Vienna\n\n[5] this is likely to be the biggest \"change\". At Compiègne, the designated \"appartements du roi de Rome\" (in the Aile de la Reine), were formerly the apartments of Marie Antoinette. Madame Royal isn't likely to set foot there for love or money. The \"appartements de l'Impératrice\", on the Cour des Pompes, however, were her and her brother's childhood rooms (the salon circulaire was her brother's study). That aside, in the absence of a queen and being the highest ranking female at the Restauration court, Madame Royal taking over Marie Louise's apartments doesn't seem unlikely.\n\n[6] firstly, Auguste Amalie is a princess, so it's not like Madame Royal can be as \"snobby\" towards her like she might be towards the other Beauharnais. Secondly, however briefly, the pair did likely know one another while still at Versailles. Louis XVI was Ludwig I of Bavaria's godfather and Auguste's mom and dad were both friends of Marie Antoinette\n\n[7] this would be the OTL Salon de Réception. It was originally the king's bedchamber, then briefly a throne room, before becoming the Salon des Princes under the Restauration and the Salon de Réception either during or after the Second Empire\n\n[8] Artois might not have been a wit or an intellectual, like Louis XVIII, but neither was Désirée from what I can make out. Besides, Artois was still \"as handsome at sixty-five as what he was at twenty\" meaning that I doubt even if the conversation is dull, Désirée minds especially\n\n[9] Pozzo di Borgo was actually born four years before the French acquired Corsica\n\n[10] this would be at the Abo Conference of 1812 between Alexander I and Bernadotte. It's unlikely that Pozzo di Borgo was the brains behind this- it strikes me as one of Alexander's half-witted ideas- but Désirée could simply be chalking it up to the fact that she's Napoléon's ex-fiancée. She herself admitted she didn't know much about other countries\n\n[11] i.e. the expulsion from Mittau\n\n[12] Ekaterina Pavlovna had her sights set on the future Willem II of the Netherlands before the Congress started\n\n[13] Napoléon's emissary in Berlin wrote in January 1814 that not only would Prussia remain loyal to the emperor but also that Friedrich Wilhelm III was entertaining the thought of marrying his son, the future Friedrich Wilhelm IV, to a princess of the Bonaparte family to cement the alliance between the two courts. And shortly thereafter, the Prussian ambassador arrived in Paris\n\n[14] referring to the Seven Years' War where there was Prussian occupation- Friedrich the Great even helping himself to the spare change the Saxons had lying around- of Dresden\n\n[15] Bompa Gros (fat grandpa) = Louis XVIII\n\nOncle Toinon (Uncle Tony i.e. Angoulême).\n\nTononcle (not sure if its just in Lorrain dialect, but tononcle/tatante are words used to designate \"your grandparents' siblings\" (i.e. your great-uncle, i.e. Artois)\n\nOncle Charlot (Uncle Charlie i.e. Berri)\n\n[16] both the king of Rome and Madame Royal's late brother had a small garden on one of the terraces at the Tuileries Palace. How much actual cultivation they were responsible for I have no idea, but I could see Madame Royal encouraging him to keep up this gardening habit. As to him \"selling\" vegetables, he doesn't take a little wheelbarrow down to market (as adorable as that image could be), but Louis XVI used his son's garden (he had one at Versailles before 1789) to teach him about money and responsibility. The king, queen and Madame Élisabeth would buy vegetables or flowers from their son and then the queen and Madame Élisabeth would distribute them (the vegetables) to the poor and needy. Usually taking the dauphin and Madame Royal with on their visits. Before this sounds too Ancien Regime, Prince Albert had a similar policy at Osbourne for he and Victoria's children's garden. Although I'm not sure what happened to the produce there. Ergo, Madame Royal turning a \"harmless\" hobby into something productive doesn't sound anywhere remotely close to ASB. So much the better if he's got green-fingered Josèphine to help him."
