Also, the religious differences would make flat out vassalization nigh on impossible. I will, however, offer your merchants control over the main port city of (TBD).\n\nTo Rex: Cut the crap. I got there three years before you did - spent more time on the disorganised state - and got the leader to sign a vassalage act after a long time of sorting out his nation. You spent one year - not allowed - on it and thus cannot claim as yours. And religion does not matter if I made him sign a vassalage treaty.\n\nThe Jurchens continue on their great migration. A large tribe settles down just south of Lake Baikal, expelled the Northern Yuan chieftains living there. They form a small Jurchen state.\n\nThe Ainu continue to raid Date as they centralise to a greater degree.\n\nThe Quimbaya chieftains begin migrating northward, toward the land of the Aburráes and Nutibas in OTL Medellín.\n\nIn the chaos that is the Middle East, two states consolidate in the Levant, Damascus and the Levantine Kingdom north and west of it. The Jalayirids and the Black Sheep Turks retake much of their lost territory with Basra declaring independence and Baghdad and Mosul declaring themselves as city-states. Meanwhile, the White Sheep Turks continue to hold strong to Timur. Azeria and Armenia reform while Georgia regains its lost territory and full independence. The revolts in Northern Persia are crushed but take a toll on the Timurid armies.\n\nBy a treaty with the Timurids last year, these provinces of Syria were returned to the Mamluks. Therefore, I should regain control over the Syrian provinces. Note that they never wanted full on independence but simply to be restored to their place as a part of the Sultanate. If you mods do not want to change the event, then here is my diplomacy: The Mamluks invite the Levantine states of Damascus and the Kingdom back into the Sultanate. We assure the current rulers that they will remain under their current ruler, but will be vassals of the Sultan in Cairo. They also will be untaxed for at least ten years, and Aleppo and Damascus will still be considered as among the chief cities. To sweeten the deal we send gifts of gold and remind our ethnic, religious and linguistic countrymen of the invasion in 1400 and show evidence of our future plans to return Syria to our realm. (There really is no reason for either of them to decline.)\n\nAn earthquake strikes in Shaanxi crippling the Ming authorities there. Taiyuan is devastated.\n\nThe portion of the treasure fleet destined for mapping Papua lands in OTL Cape York. It hits a reef on the way back, however, leaving the secret of Australia untouched.\n\nA typhoon strikes Taiwan sending the natives back to their mountains while destroying all colonies on the island. Xiamen and Fujian sustain a storm surge. The remnants of the storm sweep across Japan leaving mudslides and devastation in its wake. Several daimyo’s territories in Kyushu and Shikoku collapse into disorder while Date lose their southern portion.\n\nRupert, King of Germany and Count Palatine dies at his castle of Landskrone near Oppenheim. He is buried at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Heidelberg. All electors of the Holy Roman Empire are asked to meet to elect the new emperor (on the Holy Roman Empire page).\n\nThe increasingly inconsistent actions of the Pope in Rome, recently topped off with an alliance offer to the Timurids, after the missionaries sent there previously failed, continue to undermine the credibility of the Roman Papacy. Rumours that John XXIII is going senile start to spring up.\n\nIn Avignon, Benedict XIV dies, and the Provençal Pierre Girard is elected Pope, taking the Papal name of Pius II. He still is deemed an Anti-pope by Rome. The Hessian and some other HRE nations’ support slightly re-invigorates the Papacy at Avignon, whose support at Benedict XIII’s death was restricted to Aragon, Cyprus and Provence. With this newfound support, Pius II knows that the present situation is an improvement, but still isn’t ideal, so he attempts to capitalize on the failings of the Roman Papacy, and seek more support to his cause, particularly in England and in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe “Moundville” Civilization discovers how to work copper and begins using it for weapons.\n\nThe Mapuche Civilization in OTL South America unites into a tribal confederation, and it begins to expand rapidly across the Patagonian plains.\n\nThe daimyo of Kono dies, and his daughter, who is married to the Hosokawa ruler, is forced to give her lands to her husband, merging the two Daimyos under the Hosokawa.\n\nPrussia: The Prussians officially vassalize the nations of Riga and Dorpat, though the two nations are officially merged under the control of Riga. The Prussians continue their efforts to vassalize Courland and Osel-Wiek. The Prussians begin developing their economy to recover from the Polish War. The Prussians also begin to rebuild their military from the Polish War. The Prussians continue construction on the grand capital city of Marienburg, with Emperor Konrad intending it to be a shining jewel on the Vistula. The Prussians have finished the first stage in the construction of a Prussian Parliament, which has its first session on the first of April. While it is mostly a rubber stamp to the Emperor, it shows great promise for reform in the far future. For now most of the Empire's power lies in the hands of the Emperor and his Imperial Council.\n\nTHE UNC requests a military pact with Prussia.\n\nThe Prussians respectfully decline the requested pact, as the Prussians have decided to stay neutral for the time being.\n\nIt's a non-aggression pact, so ...\n\nMasovia: The Kingdom of Masovia also continues recovering their economy, and continues building a new national army. The Masovians continue construction of their capital at Czersk.\n\nRiga: The Archbishopric of Riga begins building their economy, and begins the formation of a new national army. There are people in Riga's government who wish to found a secular monarchist government in Riga.\n\nAustria: We train and expand our military using new experience from the war. We also begin developing hand cannons as a future weapon in warfare after seeing its implementation on a small scale. We continue influencing the states of Salzburg, Gorizia, and Patria del Friuli. Albert V of Austria is unexpectedly elevated to his position at an early age after receiving a good education, with Leopold IV reluctantly recognizing his rule. With the recent death of Rubert II of the County Palatine, Albert senses the upcoming election as an opportunity to finally elevate Austria to a position of power, living up to the dream of his ancestors to make Austria a significant part of the empire. He uses his favor and influence to become a valid candidate among the electors, with many of which he has already retained positive relations and alliances which he inherited from his father’s rule, after of years of growing relations among German states. Albert asks for his allies to support his efforts to become emperor. Following the recent uproar over the collapse of Genoa, Albert promises to many nobles that he will become a strict ruler of the empire to prevent such a thing happening again. In the meantime propaganda is posted falsely noting that the government of Genoa was the true “false catholic” government, having seemingly harbored an Anti-pope. Despite the possible inaccuracies, the effort works to quell some criticism, and even helps Albert gains support and legitimacy.\n\nFlorence: The economy and military both expand as Florence expands its influence in Italy. The House of Este is vassalized, Modena coming under Florentine control. With the renovations in Florence come infrastructure improvements. Florence begins working on vassalizing Padua and Sovana.\n\nSiena: The military and economy are improved\n\nPisa: The military and economy are improved.\n\nNovgorod: We continue the production of Koch boats, cannons, hand cannons, advanced crossbows, swords, and composite bows, increasing our military capabilities in case of war. The nation’s training and advancement of military continues. We expand north (by 8 pixels) into undiscovered land. The new class of koch ships being manufactured in Novgorod is made with wider decks and larger sides, created to allow for the possible implementation of firearms. Modified hand cannons cast in the city’s foundries are mounted to this new line of ships, which seem to be able to be supported adequately. Crews are trained in the use and maintenance of these weapons on board ships, leading to the creation of a cycle for quick reloading and firing. The wooden fort of St Patriksburg’s population grows slightly as conditions improve. The early dirt paths are developed to create a clear crossroad of streets in the center of the settlement. With the dock having been completed outside the fort walls ships begin to dock at the fort, bringing settlers and explorers, trading goods, and other supplies. Construction continues on the wooden kremlin born from the early fortifications in front of the fort to protect the dock and the settlement’s inhabitants in case of an attack. Guard towers are designed to house stationery cannons that in an invasion would be able to strike small ships with moderate efficiency during a hostile raid. Patrik’s Kremlin is expected to be completed within a few years. We continue the talk of unifying the Rus’ with Muscovy. More schools have been introduced to the Russian language. We continue helping Tver with the construction of the trade road, looking to finish around the year of 1413.\n\nScotland: All is well in the Kingdom of Scotland. Relations with England and Irish nations are on the rise and are doing well. Paving is near completion.\n\nGrand Duchy of Moscow: The nations of Oka, Rostov and Yaroslavl are now officially our vassals as well as Pereslavl-Ryazanski (Some of these nations aren’t on the nation list, but have existed during this time period; Source: http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1400/index.html). Brick and mortar is continuously being used to build the kremlin surrounding Moscow. Russian starts to become a more popular language within our nation. Hand cannons continue to be placed on the Moscow Kremlin walls. Ballistas and catapult emplacements are constructed at the strong points of the walls. Economic development continues. Supplies continue to be sent to Wallachia, Moldavia, and Hungary in their coalition against the Ottomans. Trading goods from new roads constructed with Tver allow trade to grow within the nation. Vassalization of Vietka begins (Three turns).\n\nOther mods correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you can not vassalise that many nations at once.\n\nThere is no rule regarding how many nations you can vassalize in a turn on the rules page, so I assumed I could. If not I'll just take Pereslavl-Ryazanski. Furthermore I've been doing this for the past three to five turns. User:Edboy452 (talk) 20:02, February 11, 2014 (UTC)\n\nKöln: We continue upgrading our military capabilities to serve the Holy Roman Empire and the German people, and to defend Catholic peoples of Europe from outside invasion. We continue to influence Heinsberg. We place our vote among the Holy Roman Empire electors for Albert V from Austria based on our long standing alliance and friendship and his promise to protect the empire.\n\nWallachia: The development of better crossbows continues. Trade continues to grow as mining picks up speed, several more iron and salt mines open. The boyars are lending record amounts of money, and they are continually encouraged by the prince. Michial, the son of Mircea reaches the age of 13 years, and begins to be trained for rule by his father. Michial has a talent for speaking, and negotiation which is being honed by the best tutors available, he will learn Latin, Greek, Romanian, Russian, and Polish to some degree.\n\nMoldavia: The fleet improves under the guidance of the Venetian shipmaster, and another batch of ships is built, three more galleys, each equipped with two fore-mounted Springalds. The new ships are significantly faster, and much more modern in design than the older ten. Also the Prince thanks the Muscovite crown for the goods, which will be put to use building up the navy.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: The Venetian master offers to start a school in the largest port city to build the knowledge of shipbuilding as well as keep the development constant. The school would be simply called the Venetian School as it would teach the art which Venice is most known for (and possibly allow for further Moldavian and Venetian co-operation especially concerning knowledge).\n\nPrincipality of Tver: Tver continues to build the road network through Novgorod. In the same time the country starts receiving revenue from the road system developing in Muscovy.\n\nThe Jochid Ulus continues to develop in its sedentarisation tendencies. The cities across the city - specifically those in the Volga and Ruthenia - begin growing quickly, as more and more people flock to these cities. Nomadic herding grass begins to be taken over for agricultural production, especially in Ruthenia and the Steppe. New small cities and towns begin to dot the Volga, Ob and Kama rivers, although none are much over two hundred inhabitants. Even then, the Ulus' Kurultay begins to make efforts to connect all of these, and the infrastructure improves. The agricultural boom of Kazakhstan and Ruthenia continues, and the economy therefore continues on the rise. The territory on the Yamal expands by 2000 sq km, especially in the northwest corner, where the main settlements exist. Reindeer flesh and fur begin spreading in the markets across the Ulus. Some ulus begin collapsing, as their leaders settle down and begin drawing down official borders, and begin morphing into feudal appanages. The Mordvin and Chuvash mythos continue to be written, as the literary versions of these langusges continues to spread across the merchants of the land. Even then, Catholic, Orthodox, Sunni and Shi'ite priests come into the nation, trying to evangelise the Pagans. Small amounts of violence rises between the priests of these faiths. Shadi Beg Khan appears from his voyage from Siberia, wounded and deeply ill. He is taken care of throughout the year. In the same year, Borte, his daughter, dies of pneumonia. Ïdegay Jochid continues to be raised in Manguday's court, taught to believe that he's Temür-Hachiun's younger brother. The buying of handgonnes continues, and a few begin to be armed into the officers in the court. It is estimated that one in every 1000 officers have a handgonne. A new port is planned in the coast; its name will be Ŝačè, and it will exist in order to create an independent Jochid port, not controlled by Venice like Caffa and Azov. However, Venice is assured that they will be given trade rights in Ŝačè. Just south of Ŝačè, the Circassians continue to be influenced, with five Adyghe tribes finally joining together into the 200 sq km Principality of Adyghea.\n\nthe Principality of Great Perm continues to build their military and economy. Kolvakvar continues building, as new mosques and palaces are unveiled. However, after complaints about surviving boyars, Orthodox churches are also allowed in Kolvakvar. Officers continue to be armed with handgonnes; it is estimated now there is 20 people with handgonnes in the nation. The secret to building them properly continues to be researched. The Qur'an begins to be translated to Komi.\n\nthe Principality of Adyghea is created early in the year, with Asl''an, an Adyghe ruler, joining with another three Adyghe tribes, and expands by 200 sq km in the border with the Golden Horde. Other Adyghe hordes mostly remain unruly.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Venice is glad and in return grants favourable tariffs and subsidies for traders from the Jochid Ulus so that trading through Kaffa and Azov is profitable.\n\nThe Kingdom of England: Ties with Scotland and the Irish states continue to grow. England begins seeing an influx of wealth due to investments in the Bank of Holland and the Roscal Bank of Venice. The Kingdom of England begins to formally the process of unifying the isles. The First official act of the peace is the signing of the Articles of Union, bringing England and Ireland together, the offer to join the Articles is presented to Scotland to finally begin the long process of forming the United Kingdoms of Greater Albion. Those that support the House of York begin to gain more favour as the king continues to lose his mind. The government begins the process of rebuilding infrastructure in the region. The cities of London and York begins to see upgrades to security and infrastructure. England's military is expanded.rations throughout Wales as the remaining rebel forces are rounded up. After constant ill health and rumours of insanity, the King, Henry IV, dies in August of 1410. With no suitable heir left for the House of Lancaster, and major public support shifting toward the House of York after years being ruled by what some have dubbed \"the Mad King\". In September The Duke of York, Edward of Norwich is crowned Edward IV of the Kingdom of England, Protector of the realm and unifier of the Isles, Supporter of the Holy Faith most August. One of King Edward's first acts was to begin the process of ending the war in France. The Archbishop of Canterbury approaches the French in Avignon, discussing his, and the English displeasure at the erratic behaviour of the Holy See in Rome and begins to propose the English and French repair relations and separate from the corrupt and decadent Rome. Archbishop Keen is certain that others would follow in the steps of England and France, whom are following the true words of God, and not of a deranged infidel lover in Rome. English military and Navy is expanded with many new war cogs being added to the English Fleets.\n\nCrown Dependency Dublin: Dublin expands its influence and rebuilds its port massively to accommodate the influx of Venetian merchant ships. Ulster and Desmondic whiskey becomes a popular export from the city.\n\nWales: Infrastructure and military are improved. Welsh ports undergo massive expansions to accommodate the growing English navy.\n\nCastilian Dip: Due to the erratic and nearly insane actions of the church and the fact Castile has been one of the largest proponents of Christianity and one of the nations more knowledged in converting infidels, we wish to throw our support behind the creation of a new Catholic sect of Christianity. The Pope while previously a respected position has deteriorated recently and we cannot ourselves continue to devote our service to a corrupted offices which has violated our sovereignty in Morocco, and wishes alliances with infidels.\n\nEnglish Dip: We thank our ally Castile for their support in the endeavour. While it has saddened the hearts of true Catholics everywhere, the continued atrocities committed in Rome cannot stand.\n\nDesmond Diplomacy: We pledge ourselves to your cause to eventually come back to the true Christian faith and away from the false preachers in Rome.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Venice asks that England and Venice set up a building to act as a diplomatic link between the two nations, as England has greatly helped develop the Roscol Bank. This is an act put forward by the Doge to cement support to the Kingdom. Further co-operation and unity between the English and Venetians is sought and so Venice offers to purchase a section of land to build a small but lavish Venetian style building to act as a political and economic centre for Venetians in England and to act as the chief communicator with the English crown. The building would be owned by the Roscol Bank and be called the Roscol House.\n\nRoman Empire: The Roman Empire begins to enter a period of economic and political stabilization following the capture of Sinope and other territories. To patrol these territories, the army is doubled from 7500 troops to 15,000. These troops begin to organize campaigns inside Roman territory to hunt down any bandits or brigands that might pose a threat to trade or travelers. The shipyard at Sinope expands the Roman navy by twenty ships, as that is the max that the Roman economy can support at this time. Trade expands in cities like Sinope, Corinth, and Famagusta, increasing the revenue of the Empire, especially with expanded trade with Hungary. A dock is lent out to the Dutch to expand trade further. The Emperor now considers the possibility of once again minting gold coins for the Empepor to use, but it is likely that this will not be done for several years. The Empire continues to increase its influence on Theodoro by increasing its trade and political relations with the nation. The Empire also begins to interact more with the Kingdom of Cyprus. Orthodox priests in Famagusta request permission to interact with the Orthodox Greek serfs there. While this request is denied at first, Cyprus eventually allows the priests to interact with other Orthodox priests and monks on the island. The royal family is overjoyed at the news that Maria is soon to be a mother.\n\nEmpire of Trebizond: The Empire expands its trade with the Roman Empire and other nations like Theodoro and Venice. The Empire sends tacit aid to the Timurids, but asks that the general welfare of the Orthodox Armenians and Georgians is considered diligently. The Empire begins to renovate the defenses of the capital.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: The Doge, seeing he may have neglected his alliance with the Romans in recent years, sends a large cog with a great capacity for luxurious travel as well as several cannons and other weapons for a threatening warship. They propose that the Emperor use this ship to ensure his safety and to act as a symbol of the re-invigorated strength of the Empire. Further trade with Trebizond is welcomed and treated as Roman trade, to both help their ally and to help integrate Trebizond back into the western sphere.\n\nZapotec: Emperor Tlaco expands Danibaan's influence in the surrounding city-states by way of the Zapotec Alliance. Roadways connecting cities in the alliance help merchants and soldiers move more freely between them. In the coastal regions under Danibaan's influence, more boats are created. Tlaco orders more to be manufactured to bring in goods from the sea. Daibaan continues expanding into the surrounding city-states north along the gulf coast.\n\nNavajo: With the discovery of precious metals a few years ago we began to fight amongst ourselves and then nearby tribes began to attack us. Out of this chaos a new leader named Tooh (River) rose up and we were able to unite as one tribal people to defeat the invaders. We all now agreed that we were better off united in peace than divided in war, and now that we were united we believe we will accomplish great things. Because of this we begin to federate around the Colorado River and its tributaries in and around the OTL Four Corners Region. With access to the Colorado River we fish and gather berries for food and we mine precious metals in order to trade with nearby tribes. With this trading not only comes the spread of resources, but the spread of ideas, such as the war strategy and tactics of the Apache, the architecture of the Pueblo, the nomadic lifestyle of the Comanche, and the ideas of the Pima. With the trade of nearby tribes we trade our precious metals and our Navajo culture and thus we begin influencing them. We also expand toward the center to the Hakhwata (Colorado River, OTL Page Arizona) in order to control trade of it and we centralize our tribal government under Chief Tooh. The military is also reorganized and upgraded and a team of explorers are sent up and down the Colorado River to discover new tribes and new resources. Victory and peace totems are also set up so that this date will be forever remembered as the year that the Navajo united in peace and brought prosperity to everyone surrounding us.\n\nOttoman Empire: The Ottoman Empire continues to watch over the revolutions in the Middle East, and the Sultan decides to send minimal financial aid to the White Sheep Turks, and will indeed recognize the independence of the new break-away countries from the Timurid Empire, while maintaining the non-aggression pact. He does focus his energy to the north of the Empire in Serbia, where many are alarmed at the increase of troops and back-up at the Hungarian border. Many troops are sent to Serbia and the border with Wallachia to ensure they are not defenceless in the event of an attack. The Sultan makes an attempt to vassalize the small territory of Dukagjini in order to increase naval and military presence in the Adriatic Sea as a precaution (and considering it’s a very small territory compared to the Empire, it should be vassalized within a year or two, right?) Meanwhile, in the midst of chaos, the Sultan decides to go to Mecca during Hajj season to get away from the politics for a week and purify his soul. Evidently, he comes down with a bad flu on his way back ...\n\nNo. They are Christian. The only way you can vassalize them is through war.\n\nPortugal continues a notable buildup in military strength and allows for a vigorous training program on the existing military forces attempting to train them up heavily. Meanwhile, the administration continues to be reformed, and agriculture and commerce are encouraged. Meanwhile, Portugal continues to develop its navy. Meanwhile, Margaret of Navarra gives birth to a boy, who is named Carlos, who dies after some days. Meanwhile, Duarte de Avis, second son of João I, is betrothed to Urraca de Moscoso, daughter of Rodrigo Sanches de Moscoso, Lord of Altamira. Meanwhile, fter the Infantes Pedro, Duarte and Henrique reach majority, they are created Dukes of Aveiro, Coimbra and Viseu, respectively. Meanwhile, with the recent events transpiring in the dispute between the Rome and Avignon Popes, including England and Castille's lean toward Avignon, João I declares neutrality on the schism, ceasing to publicly support the Roman Pope due to his recent actions, but still not going as far as to support Avignon. Meanwhile, Portuguese traders continue visiting the Castilian settlements in the Canaries.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Eager to pick up on the lucrative Portuguese markets, Venice asks for a trade agreement and hopes that the existing trade agreement both nations have with Castile encourages them to accept.\n\nCounty of Oldenburg: The Count is saddened by the news of Emperor Rupprecht's death but looks forward to the election results with great anticipation. The Count, on the advice of the Bishop, declares Oldenburg's continued support for the Roman Papacy and accepts His Holiness' offer of an alliance (however, he states that Oldenburg would probably not be able to do that much to aid the Pope). Work begins on the first of the so-called \"Island Forts\". The first one is on the island of Borkum; our Westernmost populated island. It is set to be completed and occupied by soldiers next year. The coast-guarding ship continues to do a good job, it has even apprehended a pirate boat. Frisia continues to be settled by Oldenburg families. To aid in administration, Frisian chiefs who have shown their loyalty to the Count are given the title of \"Lord\" and allowed to maintain a degree of their power. However, their titles can be revoked at any time by the count, and they are answerable to the count and council at all times.\n\nUm - you do know the islands are also divided. Now I have the westernmost island. Your islands reach 'til the border with mine. Nkbeeching (talk) 10:32, February 11, 2014 (UTC)\n\nYes, I do know. Hence why Borkum is my \"westernmost island\". It is the most westerly of Germany's Frisian Islands. Callumthered (talk) 20:40, February 11, 2014 (UTC)\n\nBrabant-Hainaut-Holland: Wilhelm continues to integrate Brabant into the lifestyle of his other states as he finishes moving his place of residence to Brussels. Plans are made to unite the Duchy of Brabant and the County of Hainaut upon his death. As his daughters continue to grow their education is increased as well. Artisan and metalwork production expand greatly now that things have calmed down. Trade continues to grow stronger as Dutch merchants solidify their position as the main trader in Western Europe and one of the main traders in parts of the Mediterranean though still behind the Venetians by far, and the largest individual traders in the Baltics. Banking grows immensely as peace sets in in the lowlands. Influencing over the disorganized Duchy of Guelder. The establishment of serfdom continues to debilitate as trade and production grow in importance. The Council of Estates is renamed the General Estates and reorganization of the institution begins. The navy continues to grow. The lordship of Frisia gains two new ports. With the continuous inconsistencies of the Pope and the Emperor along with the growing desire to limit the power of the clergy in the lowlands The aristocracy and Wilhelm continue to distance themselves from Rome and from the Emperor, while officially supporting the institution.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Seeing that the Venetians and Dutch are beginning to dominate most trade routes in Europe, Venice decides to extend to them the offer of establishing a formal trade pact to solidify their dominance of trade. The pact would be known as the Dutch-Venetian Trade Pact and would be effectively a customs union between the two nations as well as an agreement by the merchants of the two nations to abide by as well as enforce the Trade Pact. The Trade pact would eliminate completely direct and indirect tariffs as well as non-tax barriers to trade. Further the Trade Pact would be supported by the two banks, the Dutch Bank and Roscol Bank, who would agree to encourage their partners to abide by the Trade Pact. On another note, Venice would share knowledge concerning business practices that allow it to avoid being bound to artisan practices that are used in most of the world and Brabant-Hainaut-Holland still. The combined efforts of the Venetians and Dutch would surely make for an unrivaled and unparalleled control of trade power.\n\nWith the chaos engulfing many regions, matters are only made worse for the Mamluk Sultanate as Ahmad Jalayirid dies in August. In order to protect the claim of his son, al-Mansur Mostafa Hazem, Nasir-ad-Din Faraj claims the title of Regent of the Jalayirid Sultanate. With the Syrian region of the Sultanate returned (one way or the other, see mod event above), emphasis shifts east, toward Persia. With the claim on the Mesopotamian throne backed by the Caliph of Mecca, the army is marched to the border and prepared for war. We ask Timur to accept the claim of al-Mansur as heir to the Mesopotamian region. The Sultan continues to influence Mogadishu (Mogadishu was known by the Venetians and even Chinese at this time, had been recorded by Ibn Battuta, and even earlier Arabic explorers, not to mention having a strategic location and being a large exporter of goods, so it is not even remotely far fetched to puppetize them). Meanwhile, missionary efforts in Madagascar (which was known by Mogadishans and Zanzabaris since the 9th century, and had been visited by some Egyptians in antiquity) continue to spread Islam. Business continues to influence Cyprus (No, not vassalize, just influence.) Meanwhile, Ibn Khaldun dies from age, but Halil bin Sana, a national hero takes over the university, redubbed the Khaldun University of Alexandria.\n\n'It might have been known, but don't you think that there is a reason why it wasn't colonized then?and you still don't seem to notice that your country would be terribly overextended of expanding from Nubia to Madagascar in only four, five years.\n\nMecca and Medina (They were both stabilized, and thus vassalized by the Mamluks; Medina by the Emir of the Negev and Mecca by placing the most powerful Imam in the Muslim world, with the backing of the next three most important imams, as ruler and has since fully stabilized the realm) both welcome the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire on his Hajj. We ask that he recognize the Caliph of Mecca as the true Caliph of Islam. Meanwhile, the military is prepped for war.\n\nRex, a mod told you that you didn't control Mecca or Medina and that you vassalized them after a single year and that wasn't gonna fly. Check the previous turn.\n\nNeed more time to vassalize the region. Sine dei gloriem \"Ex Initio Terrae\" (talk)\n\nMakuria and Alodia are both prepared for war, even as more and more displaced Moroccans arrive and make both nations grow 10,000 sq km apiece. The standard of living improves as technologies spread from the Sultanate proper.\n\nIfat expands 10,000 sq km to the south, along the coast, as the nation's military capacity increases , focusing on the navy. Socotra also grows it military, but focuses on a large navy to protect the mouth of the Red Sea from pirates and enemies. The Moroccan culture continues to thrive.\n\nBanu Sulaym continues to be settled as nomads settle in the city of Sirte, which is designed by leading architects from Egypt. The state expands by 10,000 sq mi toward Egypt. Ramazan merges with Karaman as the Emir of Ramazan dies and is replaced by the Sultan of Karaman, Mehmet II, who agrees to continue as a vassal of ad-Din after years of good relations.\n\n​No Rex. This is PMIII - new game, new rules.\n\nGrand Empire of the Timurid Dynasty: The Empire crushes the remaining rebellions in Persia, Central Asia, and most of southern Azer. We continue to station troops throughout the reconquered areas in order to hold them down. The Indian vassals continue to send troops to aid as do the other vassals. The Timur manages to keep living, as even though he conquered the lands, no rebel wanted to go near his armed guards. Stocking up of food continues while construction of new roads begins in the war torn regions, and Amjad officially designates his capitol as Tehran, even though advised against, he states that the people need to know the rebels will not frighten him into submission. Draka turns nine, and growing up in the bloodshed begins to have an effect, he begins to enjoy battle scenes, watching armies clash, victories won, and he begins to become more and more like his grandfather, the Timur, becoming obsessed with the military while at the same time seeing the effects of slaughter, and deciding against the slaughtering of peoples that have surrendered. His father doesn't see this, an act which will one day lead to his undoing. Draka also begins considering changing the country's name to something more suitable.\n\nSultanate of Delhi: Building of public works continues, while the military is built up and the economy is worked on. Investments from the Timurids are helping nicely as well, helping to rebuild roads and connections within the country. Stocking up of food continues. Troops are sent to crush the rebellion.\n\nSultanate of Multan: Military is built up, and stocking up of food continues. The Sultan agrees to build a road to connect Delhi to the Ersincans, as well as allow new traders from other nations. Troops are sent to crush the rebellion.\n\nEmirate of Jangledesh: The Emir continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. Troops are sent to crush the rebellion.\n\nEmirate of Sind: Sind continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. Troops are sent to crush the rebellion.\n\nSultanate of the Eastern Turks: The military is built up, while public works continue throughout the country. Stocking up of food continues. Troops are sent to suppress the rebellion.\n\nJapana (Hosokawa clan): The integration of the Kono daimyo's lands into the Hosokawa daimyo prove to be useful, although there was resistance in some parts. The catastrophic events that destroyed parts of the clan's coastline have affected the shipyards, destroying two shipyards and six ships. The integration is to be maintained peaceful, while the clan works on the issue of the loss of ships. Even though there have been casualties and losses, the storm helped with some Japanese pirates, as some who were close to the coast tried to flee from the storm by landing, after which they were soon imprisoned for their crimes against the Empire. In order to keep the land safe from anyone who might try to abuse the situation, more workers are sent to stone mines and to finish forts. With four already finished, mostly in the north-eastern parts, five more are currently being built. The Hosokawa clan also sends messengers to other daimyo's affected by the typhoon in order that all of them appeal to the Imperial Court to help them dealing with the damage caused by the event.\n\nMajapahit: We accept all offers from the Chinese. After careful preparations, the Emperor declares war on the Sunda kingdom. The professional army quickly attacks the ill-prepared troops of the Sunda. Trade is disrupted after the declaration but the Majapahitian navy quickly destroys the few ships of the Sunda. The heir to the throne gets sick but luckily he gets well again. A progressive advisor suggest to educate the children of the higher nobility in Arabic mathematics and astronomy. It doesn't get much support, but he keeps seeking support for his idea.\n\nHamburg: The people of Hamburg are saddened by the death of King Rupert, and a time of mourning is declared. Hamburg also expresses its confidence in the electors to pick a new ruler. In the meantime, the economy is built up and a trade offer is sent to Prussia.\n\nBengal Sultanate: The decrease in taxes on the landed elite do their job in most areas of the Sultanate, decreasing the tax load on the peasantry and earning him their support. The tax cuts on the merchant class allow for more trade to be conducted, and a recent lax on some of the quota laws allows for more goods to be shipped from Bengal, greatly increasing trade income. The influence on Orissa and Arakan continue due to the alliance signed by both powers, and the previous agreement by them that made us their only trade partner. The Sultanate begins to increase influence on Garjat, asking Garjat for a trade agreement. The money gained from the trade continues to arm the various levies of the Sultanate, the landed elite, Orissa, and Arakan. Some of the money gained from trade is also put toward the construction of a few Islamic temples in various large cities in the Sultanate.\n\nBengali Diplomacy (Needs mod response): We ask the nation of Orissa to set apart a small portion of their northern border for Islamic immigrants, offering to pay for any accommodations and supplies they need so that Orissa deals less with religious clashes in their northern border.\n\nBengali Diplomacy (Needs mod response): We ask the nation of Garjat for a trade agreement.\n\nOrissa (MOD): We accept.\n\nGarjat (MOD): We accept.\n\nUlster: We continue as we have before. The Earl announces that the port will be completed to a higher standard, as expected by traders. We continue to expand the range of alcohols produced, and several merchants begin to produce several different types of whiskey, to appeal to different people. The Berries of Cattle Hedges are pricked, and immersed in vats of gin to produce the Flavoured Sloe Gin. Another year of longbowmen begin training, and at the same time, a year's worth of longbowmen stop training. We expand once more.\n\nProvence: Is given a new impetus to the economy and especially trade, taking advantage of the port of Marseille. Similarly, more mercenaries to protect the royal's territories are recruited. The Count of Provence moves his influence and complete the vassalization of Avignon and the Anti-pope Pius II. The Count starts the influence on Britanny. A military alliance is sent to Aragon and Swiss Confederacy.\n\nAnjou: Follows the model of Provence and improves existing military elements.\n\nBritanny is under English influence.\n\nFrance: The military and navy are built up. John of Burgundy and France begins enacting several tolerance policies of religious local tolerance and continues to be neutral toward the Avignon and Rome Papacy. While this, Berry and Bourbon begin to be vassalized, and as the Burgundians were originally offered, they are offered of joint control of France under the creation of a council between the highest French families in control (such as the Bourbons, Burgundians and Orleans), the colony in Lanzarote continues thriving as the government begins endorsing the situation. Continues expanding southward to assure control of the Pyrenees, And we accept the French offer of OTL Spain's borders.\n\nBurgundy: Military and navy are built up, the same policies begin to be made and followed within the domination of Flanders and Burgundy, Lorraine begins to be vassalized by the Burgundians\n\nFlanders: Military and navy are built up, economy expands.\n\nBlois: Military, economy expands.\n\nDunois: Military and economy expands.\n\nAngouleme: Military and economy expands.\n\nParthenay: Military and economy expands.\n\nPerigord: Military and economy expands.\n\nSaluzzo: Military and economy expands.\n\nVijaynagar: Begins to influence Kozhikode and Venad. The Emperor expands into Jaffna (can a mod figure out how many sq m?) The military focuses more on its navy and the kingdom focuses on bringing better irrigation practices to its people. The Emperor begins to fortify the city of Vijayanagara.\n\nCastile: King Henry, now capitalising on his success in Morocco, manages to highly pacify the nobility. Taking his most trusted advisors and nobles King Henry allows his son, John II named after his father now aged five, to partake in a royal education system built around helping create a stable and capable ruler rather than letting an unprepared monarch from taking power. While this is happening the trade of Castile now booming shows the economy on a sharp upswing as the flood of wealth coming from the Castilian dominated trade in gold, ivory, and other precious things coming through the Saharan routes. Along with this, the military is allowed to relax and many nobles are allowed to bring their less professional troops home. With the war in Morocco coming to a close and the treaty signed, Castile pushes its trade outpost and merchants through Morocco, Fez and the Algiers. This allows for Castile's majority domination of the area - including the Algiers - when it comes to trade. The Castilian navy is improved technologically to incorporate new weaponry and other technology. The continued designing of a rifle continues but remains highly inconclusive. Cannons, however, are now able to be domestically produced. The Christianization of Morocco now split into Fez and Morocco continues with a sizeable population of former Muslim Berbers jumping up due to the failure of \"Allah\" to provide a victory. Muslims still remain the majority but it is noticed that Castilians have been setting up churches or converting Mosques into churches. Rather than anger the population Castile uses only abandoned mosques to be turned into churches. The infrastructure of Castile is also expanded more. Castile, in order to facilitate more conversions to Christianity, imposes higher taxes on non-Christians in the areas it controls personally or by proxy through its vassals. Castile expands its Canaries colony by 750 sq km. Castiian nobility unable to prevent large amounts of exodus from their feudal estates begin to hire the men for their valued labor skills rather than keep them tied to the land. This is done to keep them around. While highly frowned upon, most of the nobles have to do this in order to produce food enough for the populace - as well as keep many things up and running and meet quotas. This allows for the beginning developments of merchants, artisans and others to begin actually making more money from their efforts. The Castilians officially sign a trade agreement with Hungary following years of negotiations and the Ambassador delivering letters between the monarchs of both countries show that both of them have much in common and wish to have even better foreign relations.\n\nGranada: Granada, gaining territory from Castile and Venetia's conflict with Morocco and its allies, begins to settle the area it took more thoroughly but is noticing settlements of Christians popping up rather than settlements of Muslims. The Christianization of Granada, however, remains relatively low as many converts or native born Castilian Christians are going to the new settlements in Morocco. The Granadan Emir begins to doubt his faith in private but maintains public face to keep morale of the Granadan people going. The economy of Granada is improved thanks to the removal of Genoan influence from the area. The infrastructure is improved as is the military's organization.\n\nFez: The new Emirate of Fez begins to reorganize itself and begins working on infrastructure to expand existing cities. The new Emir of Fez addresses his people reassuring them of their futures and with the influx of Castilian merchants he begins to see economic improvement. Fez is allowed a token amount of troops by Castile for peacekeeping. But considering the country's economic situation the Emir is more than willing to focus on the harder issues of rebuilding the country and addressing the issue of rebuilding a population that has been shattered by years of disorganization followed by a war in which their new centralized government was outright destroyed and nearly 50,000 Moroccans killed. The Emir manages to pull together funding to conduct a census and is surprised to find that Fez barely has 350,000 people with many previously leaving, or dyng. Some Fezians closer to Castilian Gibraltar begin to convert at an alarming rate but the core Islamic areas in the country remain Muslim. The Castilian populace reaches about 12,000 with native population still fleeing.\n\nMorocco: The new Emir of Morocco works on re-organization of the country now split in half. The country looks to the Saharan trade routes and Castilian shipping to bring in an economic revival. This is somewhat successful. Infrastructure is somewhat improved with the funds that can be scraped together and Morocco relies heavily on remaining Castilian troops to provide for its security but does raise a token force of about 5000. The Emir, an extremely open man, begins looking at ways to gain the further favor of Castile rather than watch his new country live in squalor and searches for options. The country, itself, begins to turn inward to mining iron and other minerals for Castile to also jump-start the economy more. The Christianization of Morocco is undergone with the new churches and missionaries converting people. Islam, however, remains the dominant faith. The country sees a decrease in native population as many of the most devout of unhappy with the government begin the long trek to the Muslim world. The Castilian populace in Morocco reaches nearly 9000.\n\nJapan (Ashikaga Clan): Our settlement in Taiwan is destroyed by the typhoon. We begin to rebuild our port city and other small towns destroyed. The Shogun continues the building of the biggest Shinto shrine in the country. We build more ships to add to our navy. Guns are replacing crossbows and bow and arrows in the military. The Isshiki, Hatekeyama, and Imagawa clan join our empire after talking in a meeting in secret. We send an assassin to Hosokawa to kill their Shogun and scouts to look around to help out the assassin not get caught. Military bases are being built on all of the islands we own. We add more troops to the military and border control.\n\nIf no one else objects, I have crossed out parts of this turn. I don't think Japan would be using guns, and you can't annex rival clans peacefully.\n\nWhy not peacefully in a meeting?\n\nBecause it was an assassination and I don't know yet that you sent the assassin(s). But please, did you edit out my turn?\n\nThe meeting happened in 1409. So it was already done with. I just posted the results.\n\nI ask again, did you edit out my turn?\n\nNo I did not.\n\nMangut Nivkhgu: Mang Hangut's nascent empire continued to expand up the Amur river by 1000 sq km. The two monks in Beijing had not yet returned - although we must reiterate at this point that there is absolutely NO evidence that they had become pastry chefs and originated the Nivkh Tiger's Hand pastries. The insistence of nationalist pastry chefs in insisting they invented that delectible item is without historical merit, and this historian would declare that such chefs should immediately cease and desist in sending hate-mail. Still awaiting Ming response.\n\n​Chiribaya: We finished constructing our small fortifications and continue to train soldiers.\n\nIroquois Confederacy: the Mohawk and Oneida tribes launch a final attack on the Confederacy, and on the site of OTL Buffalo, NY, the Confederacy meets the aggressive tribes and a great battle is waged for three days. By the third day, with many of the best warriors and chiefs on both sides dead or wounded, the Confederacy launches a final attack and shatters the Mohawk and Onedia tribes, killing the last of their chiefs. With this final attack, the Iroquois Tribal War is over with the Confederacy of Seneca, Wnro, Cayuga and Onondaga victorious, and the defeated Mohawk and Onedia accepting the decision made on the battlefield. The casualties have been extremely heavy, and it is estimated that it would take years to repair the damage. However, the Iroquois Tribes are finally unified. With the battle out of the way, The Great Council at last sends forces to meet the Cahokians on our lands to negotiate a peace treaty.\n\nMilan: Work continues on the Certosa di Pavia, the Castle Visconteo, and on the extensive Milan Cathedral. We continue training a proper standing army, utilizing Swiss mercenaries and local recruits. With border disputes now settled between the nations of Austria and Switzerland, we continue opening friendly relations with both nations in hopes of repairing our diplomatic relations and protecting our northern border. We continue constructing cogs and galleys to strengthen our navy and protect our interests on the seas.\n\nHesse: As Hermann II reaches the border of Brandenburg, he waits for the Saxon army. As the days go by, he falls ill, and is confined to bed. His son, Prince Ludwig, will lead the army until Hermann II recovers. A man named Claus Weniger in Marburg begins to sell new higher quality pillows.\n\nYemen: The Emir continues increasing the size of the navy and the army. The Emir tasks the navy to patrol further south and to fight pirates to help increase combat experience in the navy and protect the Emirate's trade interests further south. The Emir continues expanding into the disorderly fragments of Mecca by 250 sq km. The Emir also continues influencing the disorderly fragments of Mecca. He also continues influencing Oman. The Emir accepts the offer of a trade deal from the Oyo Empire. More expeditions are sent to Socotra and the Emir also decides to fund some explorers that are planning to further map areas to the south.\n\nThe UNC: Continues to influence the HRE states around Holstein and Hamburg, such as Mecklenburg. The military is expanded and the Dodsfald Baestyr is used more and more. The use of the hand cannon continues to spread, and new tactics evolve around a mixture of Pike and Shot, with flanking cavalry and DBs as defensive weapons and reserves. Trade through the Øresund now gives massive profits to the government, as well as boosting trade to Germany, as much of this money is used to fund CM voyages to the Med, the Black Sea, and even as far as Africa. A young shipwright in Stockholm improves on the design of the Korekor, making it faster and stronger, with larger sails, such that rowing is no longer even required at all. We once again ask for trade treaties with Venice and Castille. We continue to use trade to force cities on the Baltic, of the Hanseatic League, to declare themselves CM Free Ports. A major renovation of Stockholm and Oslo is suggested by the Crown, and is accepted by the Grand Council. Fortifications on the Øresund grow. We continue to expand into the lands of the Saami. Our trade in all seas grows. Meanwhile, the crisis over the Pope continues to grow, with supporters of the Roman and Avignon Pope clashing in the Grand Council. After several weeks of debate, the Council agrees to abide by the decision of the Council at Pisa.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Venice agrees to a trade treaty and begins to further stretch its reach of trade power into the north eastern European nations.\n\nDesmond: Construction on Tomasdun Castle continues, and all that needs to be done is to finish up the walls and the moat, which is smaller than average, due to the castle being on cliffs on the coast. Following England transferring her Irish possesions (sans Dublin) to us, we begin to announce plans for the eventual unification of Ireland (sans Dublin), and the nation will be divided into four subdivisions controlled by the King, but they will have a noble put in place to enforce the laws and collect the taxes. The nobles will have a reletively high amount of autonomy within local affairs. In return, however, the dukes are required to pay above-average taxes and provide slightly more troops for the kingdom's levy. The subdivisions will be Munster, Connaught, Leinster, and Ulster. We continue to use the manor system, and the King's farms continue to produce grain for laborers. The port is now finished, and ships are sent out again for trade with other nations. Drinking songs rise in popularity. We continue to be fed up with the current Papacy, and begin to open negotiations with Avignon. The hulk is converted into a warship, and the King, pleased with the design orders several to be built. Westmeath is put under the control of a regent for now, and we tighten control over the other regions.\n\nVenetian Republic: As the Roscol Banks trade fleet begins to expand Venetian trade power as well as threaten the stranglehold of the Nobility on Venetian trade, others begin considering serious use of the new business model of the bank to create long-lasting enterprises with large capital reserves for investment. The Doge considers creating a copy of the model to be used by the state. His suggestions on the matter provoke a small uproar, many Nobles feel he is trying to undermine the position of the old families. He retorts saying that \"this is not an action of my making, but rather one of your own. We have let Venice stay stuck in the past for too long, we are still ahead but must keep moving. Our choice is to continue complaining that the boat is sinking and let it sink while we do so or to take up the tools we have and fix the ship.\"\n\nThe Pieromo family after strife from the death of Giovanni finally re-centres with the grandson of Giovanni, and bearing the same name, taking charge of the family through sheer force. He directs his efforts to opposing the Roscols and starts funding a small retinue for his family's personal protection. He knows that Roscol has more men, money and official power than he but hopes that the Pieromo's alliances with some of the older families can help level the field. For the moment he focuses on building the wealth of the family, looking for funding he finds some from his allies and begins with a small group of ships but uses only the most profitable routes, not caring for the risks they might pose. Further he enlists the help of his brother, a well learned man in law and numbers, to help run the Pieromo trade fleet.\n\nThe Venetian workshops in Croatia are halfway through being finished, and should be done in 1402, the overseer of the project for the Venetians informs the Croatians that it will be at least another year after that before they can start manufacturing ships at the rate of one a week as the assembly line must be dry run to ensure each stage of manufacture is prepared properly. Eco-turn\n\nAegina: Develops economically.\n\nAthens: Develops military.\n\nCorfu: Develops military.\n\nEpirus: Develops economically.\n\nKaffa: Develops military.\n\nNaxos: Develops military.\n\nNegroponte: Develops economically.\n\nOyo Empire: The second census of the Oyo Empire takes place, with a total population of 2,314,553 subjects living throughout Oyo's lands. The growth of Oyo-Ile continues with the core part of the Alaafin's palace completed, allowing Oranyan and the imperial family to move out of their military encampment outside of the city, and into the city center. Beautiful gardens, fountains, canals, and bridges have been built throughout the city as part of the Alaafin's beautification program, ensuring all of the main streets have trees and stone streets and walkways, and that there is enough room for wagons and goods to be moves in opposite directions without causing major congestion. The development of Lagos continues just as well, with 45% of the harbor finished and 38% of the shipyard finished. The construction of the caravel Imọlẹ ti Shango is completed, and it is sent off on its first trade to Angola by Alaafin Oranyan. Oyo navigators trained by those sent to Oyo by Castille, have graduated from their training and are the first to staff the ship, along with sailors trained in Lagos as well. The navigator school built by Oranyan begins training new navigators as three more caravels are built in Lagos in light of the Alaafin's declaration to establish a seafaring nation in West Africa. The segun begin their return trip from Yemen to Oyo, making a stopover in Mombasa, which many relics are purchased from the locals as gifts to the Alaafin to highlight their success in mapping out the coastline of Africa. They plan to use the map in the future as the centerpiece of their planned trading network. Multiple copies of the map are made, one for the Alaafin, one for the segun captain, and two for the navigator school in Lagos for the two classes in training. The Ikorira has completed its modernization, with most of the military possessing knowledge of European warfare and weaponry, and the Eso possessing knowledge of European cavalry tactics. The small corps of warriors armed with hand cannons serve as the centerpiece of the new army. The goal of the navy to possess new ships of European caliber is new underway. The development of numerous shops and tradesmen in Oyo have come to highlight the growth of the Oyo economy in their trade with Castille and Mali, and the huge gold reserves of the country form one of the three pillars of the Oyo economy. Elsewhere, 90% of the Oyo population have converted to Catholicism, though it has been merged with local traditions as part of the missionaries tactic to gain more followers for the young churches in the region. Oranyan is pleased with the report that his Westernization programs are proceding as planned, and celebrates the successes with his nobles. He makes sure to record all of his goals for his son, who watches closely so as to emulate his father and his goals. Following the fifth year of vassalization in the year before, Ife is integrated into the empire as an autonomous province, though plans to convert and indoctrinate Ife people procedes as planned, with much acceptance from the locals as they have watched in awe at the wealth and power of the neighbors grow dramatically.\n\nAustria: We train and expand our military using new experience from the war. We also begin developing hand cannons as a future weapon in warfare after seeing its implementation on a small scale. We continue influencing the states of Salzburg, Gorizia and Patria del Friuli. Albert V thanks the electors of the Holy Roman Emperor for their support and is officially elected as emperor. We improve relations with Bohemia and as a personal gesture, Albert donates 1000 soldiers to help quell uproar in our their nation, and as a gift for their support in his election. Acting on his promise to protect states of the empire from foreign invasion or influence, Albert issues a formal demand to the nations of the Kalmar Union, stating that the United Norse Crown should immediately cease expansion and influence into the north German states of the empire. Our alliance with Bremen, Luneburg and Lübeck is confirmed, strengthing our ties to the north.\n\nMainz: Archbishop-Elector Johann II von Nassau decides to place his vote in the Holy Roman Empire election for Albert V of Austria after being persuaded by the other electors. We develop military.\n\nAragon, Navarre and Sardinia expand the military and infrastructure. The outpost in Libya expands farther inland. Note: I only control the coast of the formerly unorganized/gray land. Not the black land. Aragon extends a friendly hand to England. Aragonese noble children begin to learn from governesses and the like in groups to ensure that noble families are more strongly connected in the future.\n\nMoravia: We begin to develop our milltary and start to make crossbows for powerful troops. Our economy grows with increased trade.We ask for an alliance with Bohemia even though we already in a union. Our military is about 10,000 people. More swords and bows are made to arm troops.\n\nBrandenburg: Our military has 10,000 people. Industry is making more goods to trade and such. Our king is sadened by the death of Rupert II, and doesn’t know who to vote for.\n\nLuxembourg: We ask for an alliance with the nations of Trier and Mainz, to whom our families are closly related diplomatically. We expand our economy.\n\nPskov: Works on building up its navy and the military grows to 10,000 soldiers (the Prince's Druzhina (retinue)). The traders stay in the company of the Yongle Emperor until he answers to the call to treasure ships. Pskov continues to be an economic powerhouse.\n\nKingdom of Naples: King Ladislaus I continues the reforms. Continues the construction and improvement of shipyards, and production of new boats to combat the pirates of the Mediterranean. Territorial defense continues being built based on border forts. The king continues sending ships to patrol the trade routes of the Byzantine Empire. The king stops sending help to the Papal States. The new Naval Academy in Taranto continue the technological research with Venice. The King of Naples following the advice of his personal advisers, continue to give new impetus to the culture within the kingdom and its vassal states. The King is happy for the birth of his firstborn. Born on a rainy night in april and called Charles, like the grandfather.\n\nFerrara: Improves the economy. In a small workshop in the city an inventor named Pietro Panucci, and his little son Giacomo, begin working on a new project that will change the world. Seeing that the King Ladislaus I promotes the transmission of culture, and copying of books and transcripts, looking for a new way to make this process less time, through a machine.\n\nMantua: Improves the economy.\n\nGenoa: The Duchy of Genoa with great vigor renews its commercial strength, from the Black Sea to the Straits of Gibraltar, using new models of ships with cargo holds of more spacious and allow greater profit. With the help of Neapolitan military fleet, try to force richest commercial rights in Tunisian ports.\n\nCorsica: The exploitation of salt mines and silver intensifies, and becomes one of the major trade products in this area of the Mediterranean. In the same way the vine crops increases in extension and quality, and the manufacture of wine each year improvement in quality and quantity, being recognized as the best European wines.\n\nZeta: Improves the economy. Knowing that the Ottomans are trying to turn Dukgjini into vassals, the Prince of Zeta calls the Neapolitan troops to prevent any intervention of Muslims in those areas. While these lands are disorganized, with the military presence of Zeta and Naples, Dukgjini domestic situation will stabilize, and will begin the process of vassalage.\n\nIs Zeta the one in the Balkans?\n\n​Hungary, Croatia and all the vassals of Hungary see a greater number of military fortifications made. They also increase trading with each other.\n\nPoland continues to work on increasing its economic capacity, looking to rebuild from a shattered war.\n\nBayern-Landshut: Bavaria-Landshut expands its military. Heinrich XVI completes the vassalization of Bayern-Straubing, and he continually influences the lords of Bayern-Ingolstadt. In other news, the population continues to rise. Heinrich and his council continue to allow the training of new troops. After the University of Wurzberg is founded, Heinrich's interest is piqued and he begins planning an education system of his own in Bavaria. He meets with his council and decides to pursue the construction of a university in Landshut once the economy can support it. By 1410, the economy develops enough to support such an idea, considering the trade agreement with the French and Castilians as well as banking with Holland-Hainaut. In January, the curriculum for the university is written, including extensive classes in French, English, Latin, and Greek, as well as clergy training. Construction on the building itself gets underway. (Also, my internet was out yesterday, so I couldn't make this turn.)\n\n1411[]\n\nIn the aftermath of the typhoon, the Taiwanese begin to form several states along the coastline. The most significant of which is Tainan which controls the southern coastline. The interior mountains remain lawless and unsettled.\n\nThe Timurid Civil War begins to wrap itself up, with the Timurids having secured Persia, and Central Asia as well as a majority of its eastern empire while losing Iraq, Syria, Georgia, Armenia, and Azeria to rebels.\n\nWith the King of Dai Viet reaching 18, the terms of Ming vassalisation an suzerianship end, although a close alliance and mutual trade and economic pacts remain. The Vietnamese Tran Dynasty claims to be eternally indebted to the Ming Dynasty for restoring their throne from the court advisors who seized power in 1400 as the Ho Dynasty.\n\nDue to increased activity in Wallachia. The Translyvania region asks for greater autonomy. The Garay family’s power and prestige begins to decline.\n\nNews that Aquileia is plotting against Venice finds its way to the Doge.\n\nMuch plot, such scheme, so fail, very wow.\n\nBayern-Munchen and Bayern-Landshut enter into personal union.\n\nThe situation of France continues to represent a threat against the government of John as regent of France and duke of Burgundy, the current ruler of Orleans and of the Anti-Burgundian coalition, Charles of Orleans leads the opposition of the French alliance (Bourbon, Orleans, Parthenay and some nobles of loyal France). However, the situation seems to change as some of the leaders of the alliance begin to see that their fears seem to have no reason. However for the most part, the leadership of the Alliance remain strongly against the Burgundian government. They still accept John as regent - mostly for the people's wish of a unified France and fears of an English incursion into France due to the crisis.\n\nI was given authorization by Ms to change the event. Sine dei gloriem \"Ex Initio Terrae\" (talk)\n\nHow many times do I have to say to you that putting John of Burgundy as king of France and say that this is legitimate is completely implausible, since Charles VI is still alive, and there are more people with more of a claim to the throne than the Burgundian duke?-- Collie Kaltenbrunner (talk) 07:17, February 12, 2014 (UTC)\n\nSine explained me what happened. I shall reword this event accordingly.--Collie Kaltenbrunner (talk) 07:00, February 13, 2014 (UTC)'\n\nMerchants in the upper Baltics begin to complain about the growing monopoly of the United Crown merchants and their control of the straits near Denmark. Many Hanseatic nations grow angered in their loss of profit, starting in cities of Prussia, Novgorod and northern Germany.\n\nI have one problem with this, and that's that the Hansa nations can still have profits, just by joining the CM ... sort of economic vassalization, if you will. Also, though they may control some trade, I control the large majority, and if there are problems, then their economies will hurt a hell of a lot more than mine ...\n\nAlso, I want to point out that Prussia would not be affected since their main trading city, Danzig, declared itself a Free Port for the CM. I don't remember doing that!\n\nAnd finally, Damn it, Austria, Lubeck is under UNC economic vassalage as of a mod event. AN event that has been followed by giant economic gains. They are NOT your allies ...\n\nPrussia: The Prussians officially vassalize the nations of Riga and Dorpat, though the two nations are officially merged under the control of Riga. The Prussians continue their efforts to vassalize Courland and Osel-Wiek. The Prussians begin developing their economy to recover from the Polish War. The Prussians also begin to rebuild their military from the Polish War. The Prussians continue construction on the grand capital city of Marienburg, with Emperor Konrad intending it to be a shining jewel on the Vistula. The Prussians have begun work on the next stage of the Prussian Parliament. The Teutonic Castle at Marienburg has become the Prussian Imperial Palace. The main port at Danzig also sees growth, as the money flowing in from the Crown Merchants makes the city a very profitable trade node.\n\nMasovia: The Kingdom of Masovia also continues recovering their economy, and continues building a new national army. The Masovians continue construction of their capital at Czersk.\n\nRiga: The Archbishopric of Riga begins building their economy, and begins the formation of a new national army. There are people in Riga's government who wish to found a secular monarchist government in Riga.\n\nNovgorod Diplomacy: We join Prussia in their war against the United Nordic Crown against their aggressive actions specifically meant for the Hanseatic League. Tens of thousands of troops, supported by local mercenaries and mobs, charge into Finland, marking the entry of our war. We ask our Russian brothers in the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Pskov and the Ukraine for assistance.\n\nMuscovite Diplomacy: We accept Novgorod’s request for entry into the war, and bring indirect military support such as troops and supplies from our vassals Ukraine and Pereslavl-Ryazanski.\n\nWHAT NORDIC STRANGLEHOLD? After the agreement at Danzig, your ships pass through freely. And of course, I'm not letting you sail a giant military fleet through my nation. What more can you POSSIBLY want?\n\nTo answer your question, I assume your demise.\n\nSo basically you admit that this is just an ASB land grab conducted for OOC reasons, right? Because there is NO reason at ALL for Prussia to attack a nation that increased its wealth massively.\n\nI erase all Prussian involvement with any potential war.\n\nTver: We send supplies of Novgorod to assist.\n\nBy \"stranglehold\", I believe he's referring to your control of \"90% of Baltic trade\", and \"monopoly\", and \"economic vassalization\" of the Hanseatic league.\n\nPrincipality of Tver: Tver develops a rapid messaging service though its road networks and cavalry. Tver also decided to remain neutral in the conflict ahead, but prepares cavalry and army just in case. Tver's mining operations are told to halt due to the conflict. As a sign of neutrality Tver will let the UNC through Tver as long as they don't disrupt anything.\n\nGrand Empire of the Timurid Dynasty: The Empire crushes the final reblels in the empire, having given up on Armenia, Azer, Georgia, and Erzincan as well as Syria and Iraq. Stocking up of food continues while construction of new roads continues in the wartorn regions, and Amjad offically recognizes the newly formed nations on his border. It is decided to enter dynastic union with Delhi, changing them from a vassal to an equal of the Timurid Empire, while at the same time almost part of it. Draka turns 11, and continues to be heavily interested in military and politics, as well as social policies in stable countries. By the middle of the year the treaties have been signed with the new nations, and with the empire again at peace, the Timur has his son read a speech for him, stating that \"we have gone through God's test, and while scarred, we have made it through and continue to hold our heads up high. For even if I had died during the war, the fighting spirit would have continued. I am not the state, I only lead it for a time. Therefore, I state that when I die, this empire will not die with me. It will live on, through the line of my sons and their sons, until the day heaven and earth meet once again.\n\nSultanate of Delhi: Building of public works continues, while the military is built up and the economy is worked on. Investments from the Timurids are helping nicely as well, helping to rebuild roads and connections within the country. Stocking up of food continues. Delhi enters Dynastic Union with the Timurids. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nSultanate of Multan: Military is built up, and stocking up of food continues. The Sultan agrees to build a road to connect Delhi to the Timurids, as well as allow new traders from other nations. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nEmirate of Jangledesh: The Emir continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nEmirate of Kangra: The Emir continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nEmirate of Ladakh: The Emir continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nSultanate of Kashmir: The Sultan continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nEmirate of Sind: Sind continues to build roads around the country, as well as military installations and new forts across the land. Food continues being stocked up. We declare war on Bengal to aid Jaunper.\n\nSultanate of the Eastern Turks: The military is built up, while public works continue throughout the country. Stocking up of food continues.\n\nHamburg: Under the condition of freeing Hamburg from the 1403 treaty, Hamburg joins the UNC in a recently formed military alliance. A few days later, at night, Hamburgs shipyards go up in flames. The fire claims three merchant ships and one of Hamburgs warships. An in-depth investigation concludes with sabotage as the most likely cause. The blame fall on anti-UNC protesters that crowded the street in protest of the alliance. Meanwhile, the Prince of Hamburg dies unexpectedly. A member of the House of Welf, with many merchant connections, is able to get enough support to back his ascendancy. He becomes Henry II, Prince of Hamburg in May.\n\nPrussia is no longer at war with the UNC.\n\nVijaynagar: The Emperor keeps moving farther into Jaffna (200 pixels). The influence of Kozhikode continues. The fortification of Vijaynagara continues. The Emperor starts to vassalise Venad. The Emperor starts the expansion construction of the Virupaksha Temple. The Emperor allows trade between merchants of many nationalities and sets up a bazaar in the city of Vijaynagara. The military sends 200 war elephants to the border with the Bahmani Sultanate and begins to fortify the border (not attacking, just setting up defense). The military and economy continue to expand.\n\nBrabant-Hainaut-Holland: The recent rise of war between the UNC and the Russian state come as shock to Wilhelm and his family. While he remembers his obligations to Scandinavia he wants to avoid getting dragged into a war that could endanger his estates, for now he makes no comments on the conflict. Wilhelm calls upon his allies to back him should anyone try to go to war with B-H-H over the issue. Financial aid is sent to Denmark and vague promises about possible Dutch-Walloon support is made, while we request that the HRE not involve itself in another Eastern European conflict reminding the members of the HRE that war outside the HRE is of little business to its members. Distancing from HRE politics continues to grow as Wilhelm looks to strengthen his position and build up ties with his neighbors. A process of integration between Hainaut and Brabant begins. Brabant and Frisia begin to show large growth as the local economies begin to integrate into that of Holland and Hainuat. Production continues to grow as more artisans and metal workers emerge in the Walloon territories. Plans to begin levying troops if necesary are drafted but not issued yet so not to cause alarm. The General Estates continue to gain more duties as Wilhelm starts to age. Wilhelm begins to support the arts and sciences with increasing fervor leaving the running of the estates mostly in the hands of Engelburt and the general estates. The courts and universities of WIlhelm's estates are rapidly growing into cultural and economic centres due to the strong focus on material development. Influencing over Guelders continues as it becomes increasingly subordinate to the economic and political domination of Holland within the Dutch states. Dutch trade continues to grow and proves absurdly lucrative as the co-operation with Venetian traders allows it to be unmolested in Southern Europe and the continued decline of the Hanseatic allows it to continue overshadowing the German states in trade. Wilhelm and Engelburt begin to support the anti-Burgundians in France as they fear the expansion of Burgundy might place the lowlands estates at risk. Naval expanison continues. Work into improved firearms begins along the lines of Arquebus type weapons.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: SEE LAST YEAR'S DIPLOMACY. Venice supports its trade ally in the north, stating that despite the distance Venice will send forces should a war occur.\n\nB-H-H Dip: Wilhelm agrees to a plan over five years, and a customs-free zone but not an economic union (the idea is unheard of at the period, remember that). Also, what does the artisan part mean? You confused me there.\n\nVenetian Diplomacy: Firstly, it is a customs union, which is basically what the Hansa was, not an economic union (whatever you mean by that), basically we make our trade laws more similar which combined with our trade power means others have to abide by them by and large, which gives us a huge trade advantage. On the Artisan part, most of Europe operated throughout the middle ages and up to just before the industrial revolution on individuals who learned an entire craft and lived off it. They would craft individual items and that would take some time and be inefficient - especially when you want a big order. You have to use craftsmen from all over the place and transfer all of the items to where you need them. Guilds were basically an organised group of artisans, a bit like a trade union. They were better as they normally organised together, however, normally were protectionist of their craft and further still took time and couldn't fill big orders quickly. There are few to no organised businesses that operate to produce items in quantity or that could if they would. Venice operates by more business like practices, having partnerships, which are basically a business structure under which people can invest into an enterprise. Further, the arsenal is a true factory, with a single place of production with resources nearby. Venice can push a ship out every day, each almost identical and with replaceable parts, whereas almost everywhere else in Europe will have to rely on several different groups of artisans to work together to produce ships which could be of varying quality and would require you to hire more artisans to fix any problems you might have.\n\nBasically we're offering to share the business advantages with you in the hopes that we can work together and secure each others positions.\n\nAll right, B-H-H: We agree to the offer but suggest it be implemented over a period of five years.\n\nRoman Empire: The increased trade of the nation is used to seriously rebuild the infrastructure and housing of Constantinople, which previously had become small hamlets separated by fields. With the population of the city growing once again, the city needs new houses to house its new residents. More houses are therefore constructed. Population growth is furthered by following the ideas of Venetian quarantines in their cities for victims of disease. The economy increases due to an effective trade triangle forming in the Black Sea between the ports of Trebizond, Sinope, Constantinople, and the nation of Theodoro. This further increases the Roman trade influence with Theodoro. THe port of Famagusta begins to dominate trade in the Eastern Mediterranean and this furthers positive relations with Cyprus, as a portion of the city's trade profits go to the island's government.
