From Gross Opoczkzo it shall pass by Chlewiska, which shall remain to Prussia, to the village of Przyhyslaw, and from thence by the villages of Piaski, Chebmce, Witowiczki, Kobylinka, Woyezyn, Orchowo, to the town of Powidz.\n\nFrom Powidz it shall continue by the town of Slupee to the point of confluence of the rivers Wartha and Prosna.\n\nFrom this point it shall re-ascend the course of the river Prosna to the village of Koscielnawies, to within one league to the town of Kalisch.\n\nThen leaving to that town (on the side of the left bank of the Prosna) a semi-circular territory measured by the distance from Koscielnawies to Kalisch, the line shall return to the course of the Prosna, and shall continue to follow it, re-ascending by the towns of Grabow, Wieruszow, Boleslawice, so as to terminate near the village of Gola, upon the frontier of Silesia opposite Pitschin.\n\nART.

VI. The town of Cracow, with its territory, is declared to be for ever a free, independent, and strictly neutral city, under the protection of Austria, Russia, and Prussia.\n\nART. VII.

VIII. His majesty the Emperor of Austria, wishing particularly to facilitate as much as possible on his part, the commercial relations and good neighbourhood between Galicia and the free towns of Cracow, grants for ever to the town of Podgorze, the privileges of a free commercial town, such as are enjoyed by the town of Brody. This liberty of commerce shall extend to a distance of 500 toises from the barrier of the suburbs of the town of Podgorze.\n\nIn consequence of this perpetual concession, which nevertheless shall not affect the rights of sovereignty of his Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, the Austrian custom-houses shall be established only in places situated beyond that limit. No military establishment shall be formed that can menace the neutrality of Cracow, or obstruct the liberty of commerce which his Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty grants to the town and district of Podgorze.\n\nART. IX.

The districts and territories thus ceded, shall be separated from the rest of the kingdom of Saxony by a line, which henceforth shall form the frontier between the Prussian and Saxon territories, so that all that is comprised in the limit formed by this line, shall be restored to his Majesty the King of Saxony; but his Majesty renounces all those districts and territories that are situated beyond that line, and which belonged to him before the war.\n\nThe line shall begin from the frontiers of Bohemia near Wiese, in the neighbourhood of Seidenberg, following the stream of the river Wittich, until its junction with the Neisse.\n\nFrom the Neisse it shall pass to the circle of Eigen, between Tauchntz, which shall belong to Prussia, and Bertschoff, which shall remain to Saxony; then it shall follow the northern frontier of the circle of Eigin, to the angle between Pulsdorf and Ober-Schland; thence it shall be continued to the limits that separate the circle of Gorlitz from that of Bautzen, in such a manner that Ober-Mettel and Neider-Schland-Olich, and Radewitz, remain in the possession of Saxony.\n\nThe great post-road between Gorlitz and Bautzen shall belong to Prussia, as far as the limits of the said circles.

Fichtenberg shall be the property of Prussia.\n\nFrom the Elbe to the frontier of the country of Merseburg, it shall be so regulated that the bailiwicks of Torgau, Eilenburg, and Delitsch, shall pass to Prussia, while those of Oschatz, Wurzen, and Leipsic, shall remain to Saxony. The line shall follow the frontier of these bailiwicks, dividing some inclosures and demi-inclosures. The road from Muhlberg to Eilenburg shall be wholly within the Prussian territory.\n\nFrom Podelwitz (belonging to the bailiwick of Leipsic, and remaining to Saxony) as far as Eylra, which also remains to her, the line shall divide the country of Merseburg in such a manner that Breitenfeld, Haenichen, Gross and Klein Dolzig, Mark-Ranstadt and Knaut-Nauendorf, remain to Saxony; and Modelwitz, Skenditz, Klein-Liebenau, Alt Ramstadt, Schkohlen and Zietschen, pass to Prussia.\n\nFrom thence the line shall divide the bailiwick of Pegau, between the Floss-graben and the Weisse-Elster; the former, from the point where it separates itself above the town of Crossen (which forms part of the bailiwick of Haynsburg) from the Weisse-Elster, to the point where it joins the Saale below the town of Merseburg, shall belong, in its whole course between those two towns, with both its banks, to the Prussian territory.\n\nFrom thence, where the frontier touches upon that of the country of Zeitz, the line shall follow it as far as the boundary of the country of Altenburg, near Luckau.\n\nThe frontiers of the circle of Neustadt, which wholly falls under the dominion of Prussia, remain untouched.\n\nThe inclosures of Voigtland, in the district of Reuss, that is to say Gefall, Blintendorf, Sparenberg, and Blankenberg, arc comprised in the share of Prussia.\n\nART.

XVII. Austria, Russia, Great Britain, and France, guarantee, to his Majesty the King of Prussia, his descendants and successors, the possession of the countries marked out in the 15th Article, in full property and sovereignty.\n\nART. XVIII. His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, wishing to give to the King of Prussia a fresh proof of his desire to remove every object of future discussion between their two courts, renounces for himself and his successors, his rights of sovereignty over the Margraviates of Upper and Lower Lusatia, which belonged to him as King of Bohemia, as far as these rights concern the portion of these provinces placed under the dominion of his Majesty the King of Prussia, by virtue of the Treaty with his Majesty the King of Saxony, concluded at Vienna on, the 18th of May, 1815.\n\nAs to the right of reversion of his Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty to the said portion of the Lusatias united to Prussia, it is transferred to the House of Brandenburg now reigning in Prussia, his Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, reserving to himself and his successors, the power of resuming that right in the event of the extinction of the said reigning House.\n\nHis imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty renounces also, in favour of his Prussian Majesty, the districts of Bohemia inclosed within the part of Upper Lusatia ceded by the Treaty of the 18th of May 1815, to his Prussian Majesty, which districts comprehend the places of GÃ¼ntersdorf, TaubentrÃ¤nte, Neukretschen, Nieder-Gerlachsheim, Winkel, and Ginkel, with their territories.\n\nART. XIX. His Majesty the King of Prussia and his Majesty the King of Saxony, wishing particularly to remove every object of future contest or dispute, renounce, each on his own part, and reciprocally in favour of one another, all feudal rights or pretensions, which they might exercise or might have exercised, beyond the frontiers fixed by the present Treaty.\n\nART.

They may also remove their property without being subject to any fine or drawback (Abzugsgeld).\n\nART. XXI.

XXII. No individual domiciliated in the provinces which are under the dominion of his Majesty the King of Saxony, any more than an individual domiciliated in those which by the present Treaty pass under the dominion of the King of Prussia, shall be molested in his person, his property, rents, pensions or revenues of any kind, in his rank or dignities, nor be prosecuted or called to account in any manner, for any part which he, either in a civil or military capacity, may have taken in the events that have occurred since the commencement of the war, terminated by the Peace concluded at Paris on the 30th of May 1814.\n\nThis Article equally extends to those who, not being domiciliated in either part of Saxony, may possess in it landed properly, rents, pensions or revenues of any kind.\n\nART. XXIII.

The commission, which the Prussian and Hanoverian governments shall name without delay, to proceed to the exact regulation of the limits, shall be particularly charged with the execution of this provision.\n\nHis Prussian Majesty renounces in perpetuity, for himself, his descendants and successors, the provinces and territories mentioned in the present article, as well as all the rights which have any relation to them.\n\nART.

Whenever fundamental laws are to be enacted, changes made in the fundamental laws of the Confederation, measures adopted relative to the Federative Act itself, and organic institutions or other arrangements made for the common interest, the Diet shall form itself into a General Assembly, and, in that case, the distribution of votes shall be as follows, calculated according to the respective extent of the individual states:\n\nVotes\n\nAustria shall have 4\n\nPrussia 4\n\nSaxony 4\n\nBavaria 4\n\nHanover 4\n\nWurtemburg 4\n\nBaden 3\n\nElectoral Hesse 3\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse 3\n\nHolstein 3\n\nLuxembourg 3\n\nBrunswick 2\n\nMecklenburg-Schwerin 2\n\nNassau 3\n\nSaxe-Weimar 1\n\nSaxe-Gotha 1\n\nSaxe-Coburg 1\n\nSaxe-Meimingen 1\n\nSaxe-Hildburghausen 1\n\nMecklenburg-Strelitz 1\n\nHolstein-Oldenburg 1\n\nAnhalt-Dessau 1\n\nAnhalt-Bernburg 1\n\nAnhalt-Kotthen 1\n\nSchwartzbourg-Sondershausen 1\n\nSchwartzbourg-Rudplstadt 1\n\nHohenzollern-Heckingen 1\n\nLicbtenstein 1\n\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen 1\n\nWaldeck 1\n\nReuss, (Elder Branch) 1\n\nReuss, (Younger Branch) 1\n\nSchaumburg-Lippe 1\n\nLippe 1\n\nThe Free Town of Lubeck 1\n\nââââââââFrankfort 1\n\nââââââââBremen 1\n\nââââââââHamburgh 1\n\nTotal Votes 69\n\nThe Diet in deliberating on the organic laws of the Confederation, shall consider whether any collective votes ought to be granted to the ancient mediatised States of the empire.\n\nART. LIX. The question, whether a subject is to be discussed by the General Assembly, conformably to the principles above established, shall be decided in the ordinary assembly by a majority of votes.\n\nThe same Assembly shall prepare the drafts of resolutions which are to be proposed to the General Assembly, and shall furnish the latter with all the necessary information, either for adopting or rejecting them. The plurality of votes shall regulate the decisions, both in the Ordinary and General Assemblies, with this difference, however, that, in the Ordinary Assembly, an absolute majority shall be deemed sufficient, while, in the other, two-thirds of the votes shall be necessary to form the majority. When the votes are even in the Ordinary Assembly, the President shall have the casting vote; but when the Assembly is to deliberate on the acceptance or change of any of the fundamental laws, upon organic institutions, upon individual rights, or upon affairs of religion, the plurality of votes shall not be deemed sufficient, either in the Ordinary or in the General Assembly.\n\nThe Diet is permanent: it may, however, when the subjects submitted to its deliberation are disposed of, adjourn for a fixed period, which shall not exceed four months.\n\nAll ulterior arrangements relative to the postponement or the dispatch of urgent business, which may arise during the recess, shall be reserved for the Diet, which- will consider them when engaged in preparing the organic laws.\n\nART. LX. With respect to the order in which the members of the Confederation shall vote, it is agreed, that while the Diet shall be occupied in framing organic laws, there shall be no fixed regulation; and whatever may be the order observed on such an occasion, it shall neither prejudice any of the members, nor establish a precedent for the future. After framing the organic laws, the Diet will deliberate upon the manner of arranging this matter by a permanent regulation, for which purpose it will depart as little as possible from those which have been observed in the ancient Diet, and more particularly according to the Recess of the Deputation of the Empire in 1803. The order to be adopted shall in no way affect the rank and precedence of the members of the Confederation, except in as far as they concern the diet.\n\nART. LXI. The Diet shall assemble at Frankfort on the Maine. Its first meeting is fixed for the 1st of September 1815.\n\nART. LXII. The first object to be considered by the Diet after its opening, shall be the framing of the fundamental laws of ths Confederation, and of its organic institutions, with respect to its exterior, military, and interior relations.\n\nART. LXIII. The States of the Confederation engage to defend not only the whole of Germany, but each individual State of the Union, in case it should be attacked, and they mutually guarantee to each other such of their possessions as are comprised in this Union.\n\nWhen war shall be declared by the Confederation, no member can open a separate negotiation with the enemy, nor make peace, nor conclude an armistice, without the consent of the other members.\n\nThe confederated States engage, in the same manner, not to make war against each other, on any pretext, nor to pursue their diffeiences by force of arms, but to submit them to the Diet, which will attempt a mediation by means of a Commission. If this should not succeed, and a juridical sentence becomes necessary, recourse shall be had to a well-organized Austregal Court (Austregal instanz), to the decision of which the contending parties are to submit without appeal.\n\nART. LXIV. The Articles comprised under the title of Particular Arrangements, in the Act of the Germanic Confederation, as annexed to the present General Treaty, both in original and in a French translation, shall have the same force and validity as if they were textually inserted herein.\n\nART. LXV. The ancient United Provinces of the Netherlands and the late Belgic provinces, both within the limits fixed by the following Article, shall form, together with the countries and territories designated in the same article, under the sovereignty of his Royal Highness the Prince of Orange-Nassau, sovereign prince of the United Provinces, the kingdom of the Netherlands, hereditary in the order of succession already established by the Act of the constitution of the said United Provinces. The title and the prerogatives of the royal dignity are recognised by all the Powers in the house of Orange-Nassau.\n\nART. LXVI. The line comprising the territories which compose the kingdom of the Netherlands, is determined in the following manner:âIt leaves the sea, and extends along the frontiers of France on the side of the Netherlands as rectified and fixed by Article III. of the Treaty of Paris of the 30th May, 1814, to the Meuse; thence along the tame frontiers to the old limits of the duchy of Luxembourg. From this point it follows the direction of the limits between that duchy and the ancient Bishoprick of Liege, till it meets (to the south of Deiffelt) the western limits of that canton, and of that of Malmedy, to the point where the latter reaches the limits between the old departments of the Ourthe and the Roer; it then follows these limits, to where they touch those of the former French canton of Eupen, in the duchy of Limburg, and following the western limit of that canton, in a northerly direction, leaving to the right a small part of the former French canton of Aubel, joins the point of contact of the three old departments of the Ourthe, the Lower Meuse, and the Roer; parting again from this point, this line follows that which divides the two latter departments, until it reaches the Worm (a river falling into the Roer), and goes along this river to the point where it again reaches the limit of these two departments, pursues this limit to the south of Hillensberg, (the old department of the Roer), from whence it reascends to the north, and leaving Hillensberg to the right, and dividing the canton of Sittard into two nearly equal parts, so that Sittard and Susteren remain on the left, it reaches the old Dutch territory; from whence, leaving this territory to the left, it goes on following its eastern frontier to the point where it touches the old Austrian principality of Gueldres, on the side of Ruremonde, and directing itself towards the most eastern point of the Dutch territory, to the north of Swalmen, continues to inclose this territory.\n\nLastly, setting out from the most eastern point, it joins that part of the Dutch territory in which Venlpo is situated; that town and its territory being included within it. From thence to the old Dutch frontier near Mook, situated above Genep, the line follows the course of the Meuse, at such a distance from the right bank, that all the places within a thousand Rhenish yards (Rheinlandische Ruthen) from it shall belong, with their territories, to the kingdom of the Netherlands; it being understood however, as to the reciprocity of this principle, that the Prussian territory shall not at any point touch the Meuse, or approach it within the distance of a thousand Rhenish yards.\n\nFrom the point where the line just described reaches the ancient Dutch frontier, as far as the Rhine, this frontier shall remain essentially the same as it was in 1795, between Cleves and the United Provinces. This line shall be examined by a commission, which the governments of Prussia and the Netherlands shall name without delay, for the purpose of proceeding to the exact determination of the limits, as well of the kingdom of the Netherlands, as of the grand duchy of Luxembourg, specified in Art. LXVIII.; and this commission, aided by professional persons, shall regulate every thing concerning the hydrotecnnical constructions, and other similar points, in the most equitable manner, and the most conformable to the mutual interests of the Prussian states, and of those of the Netherlands. This same arrangement refers to the fixing of limits in the districts of Kyfwaerd, Lobith and in the whole territory as far as Kekerdom.\n\nThe enclaves of Huissen, Malburg, Lymers, with the town of Sevenaer and lordship of Weel, shall form a part of the kingdom of the Netherlands; and his Prussian Majesty renounces them in perpetuity for himself, his heirs and successors.\n\nART. LXVII. That part of the old Duchy of Luxembourg which is comprised in the in the limits specified in the following Article, is likewise ceded to the sovereign prince of the United Provinces, now King of the Netherlands, to be possessed in perpetuity by him and his successors, in full property and sovereignty. The Sovereign of the Netherlands shall add to his titles that of Grand Duke of Luxembourg. His Majesty reserving to himself the privilege of making such family arrangement between the princes his sons, relative to the succession to the Grand Duchy, as he shall think conformable to the interests of his monarchy, and to his paternal intentions.\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, serving as a compensation for the principalities of Nassau Dillenburg, Siegen, Hadamar and Dietz, shall form one of the States of the Germanic Confederation; and the Prince, King of the Netherlands, shall enter into the system of this Confederation, as Grand Duke of Luxembourg, with all the prerogatives and privileges enjoyed by the other German Princes.\n\nThe town of Luxembourg, in a military point of view, shall be considered as a fortress of the Confederation: the Grand Duke shall, however, retain the right of appointing the governor and military commandant of this fortress, subject to the approbation of the executive power of the Confederation, and under such other conditions as it may be judged necessary to establish, in conformity with the also renounces the principality of Fulda, and future constitution of the said Confederation\n\nART. LXVIII. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall consist of all the territory situated between the kingdom, of the Netherlands, as it has been designated by Art. LXVI, France, the Moselle, as far as the mouth of the Sure, the course of the Sure, as far as the junction of the Our, course of this last river, as far as the limits of the former French canton of St. Vith, which shall not belong to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nART. LXIX. His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, shall possess in perpetuity, for himself and his successors, the full and entire sovereignty; of that part of the duchy of Bouillon, which is not ceded to France by the Treaty of Paris; and which, therefore, shall be united to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nDisputes, having arisen with respect to the said duchy of Bouillon, the competitor who shall legally establish his right, in the manner shall possess, in full property, the said part of the duchy, as it was enjoyed by the last duke, under the sovereignty of his Majesty the King of the Netherlands, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis decision shall be made by arbitration, and be without appeal. For this purpose there shall be appointed a certain number of arbitrators, one by each of the two competitors, and others, to the number of three, by the courts of Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia. They shall assemble at Aix-la-Chapelle, as soon as the state of the war and other circumstances may admit of it, and their determination shall be made known within six months from their first meeting.\n\nIn the interim, his Majesty the King of the Netherlands, Grand Duke of Luxemburgh, shall hold in trust the property of the said part of the Duchy of Bouillon, in order that he may restore it, together with the revenues of the provisional administration, to the competitor in whose favour the arbitrators shall decide; and his said Majesty shall indemnify him for the loss of the revenues arising from the rights of sovereignty, by means of some equitable arrangement. Should the restitution fall to Prince Charles of Rohan, this property, when in his possession, shall be regulated by the laws of the substitution which constitutes his title thereto.\n\nART. LXX. His Majesty the King of the Netherlands renounces, in perpetuity for himself his heirs and successors, in favour of his Majesty the King of Prussia, the sovereign possessions which the house of Nassau-Orange held in Germany, namely, the principalities of Dillenburg, Dietz, Siegen, and lludamar, with the lordships of Beilsteiu, such as those possessions have been definitively arranged between the two branches of the house of Nassau, by the Treaty concluded at the Hague on the 14th July 1814. the said Articles shall have the same force and validity as if they were inserted, word for word, in the present Instrument.\n\nART. LXXIV. The integrity of the nineteen Cantons, as they existed in a political body, from the signature of the Convention of the 29th December 1813, is recognised as the basis of the Helvetic system.\n\nART. LXXV. The Vallais, the territory of Geneva, and the principality of Neufehatel, are united to Switzerland, and shall form three new cantons. The valley of Dappes, having formed part of the canton of Vaud, is restored to it.\n\nART. LXXVI. The bishoprick of Baste and the city and territory of Bienne shall be united to the Helvetic Confederation, and shall form part of the canton of Berne. The following districts, however, are excepted from this last arrangement:\n\n1. A district of about three square leagues in extent, including the communes of Altschweiler, Schonbuch, Oberweiler, Terweiler, Ettingen, FÃ¼rsteintein, Plotten, Pfeffingen, Aesch, Bruck, Reinach, Arlesheim; which district shall be united to the canton of Basle.\n\n2. A small enclave, situated near the village of Neufchatel de Lignieres, which is at present, with respect to civil jurisdiction, dependant upon the canton of Neufchatel, and with respect to criminal jurisdiction, upon that of the bishoprick of Basle, shall belong in full sovereignty to the principality of Neufchatel.\n\nART. LXXVII. The inhabitants of the bishoprick of Basle and those of Bicnne, united to the cantons of Berne and Basle, shall enjoy, in every respect, without any distinction of religion (which shall be maintained in its present state) the same political and civil rights which are enjoyed, or may be enjoyed, by the inhabitants of the ancient parts of the said cantons: they shall, therefore, be equally competent to become candidates for the places of representatives, and for all other appointments, according to the constitution of the cantons. Such municipal privileges as are compatible with the constitution and the general regulations of the canton of Berne, shall be preserved to the town of Bienne, and to the villages that formed part of its jurisdiction.\n\nThe sale of the national domains shall be confirmed, and the feudal rights and tithes cannot be reestablished.\n\nThe respective Acts of the Union shall be framed, conformably to the principles above declared, by commissions, composed of an equal number of deputies from each of the directing parties concerned. Those from the bishopric of Basle, shall be chosen by the canton, from amongst the most eminent citizens of the country. The said Acts shall be guaranteed by the Swiss Confederation. All points upon which the parties cannot agree, shall be decided by a court of arbitration, to be named by the Diet.\n\nART. LXXVIII. The cession, made by the 3d Article of the Treaty of Vienna of the 14th October 1809, of the lordship of Raziins, inclosed in the country of the Grisons, having expired; and his Majesty the Emperor of Austria, being restored to all the rights attached to the said possession, confirms the disposition which he made of it, by a declaration, dated the 20th March 1815, in favour of the canton ef the Grisons.\n\nART. LXXIX. In order to ensure the commercial and military communications of the town of Geneva with the canton of Vaud, and the rest of Switzerland; and with a view to fulfil, in that respect, the 4th Article of the Treaty of Paris of the 30th May 1814, his Most Christian Majesty consents so to place the line of custom-houses, that the road which leads from Geneva into Switzerland by Versoy, shall, at all times, be free, and that neither the post nor travellers, nor the transport of merchandize, shall be interrupted by any examination of the officers of the customs, nor subjected to any duly. It is equally understood, that the passage of Swiss troops on this road shall not, in any manner, be obstructed.\n\nIn the additional regulations to be made on this subject, the execution of the Treaties relative to the free communication between the town of Geneva and the jurisdiction of Peney, shall be assured in the manner most convenient to the inhabitants of Geneva. His Most Christian Majesty also consents that the gendarmerie and militia of Geneva, after having communicated on the subject with the nearest military post of the French gendarmerie, shall pass on the high, road of Meyrin, to and from the said jurisdiction, and the town of Geneva.\n\nART.

A free communication shall also be at all limes granted for the Genevese troops, between the territory of Geneva and the jurisdiction of Jussy, and such facilities shall be allowed as may be necessary for proceeding by the lake to the road of the Simplon.\n\nOn the other hand, an exemption from all duties of transit shall be granted for all merchandize and goods which, coming from the states of his Majesty the King of Sardinia and the free port of Genoa, shall traverse the road called the Simplon in its whdle extent, through the Vallais and the state of Geneva, This exemption, shall, however, be confined to the transit, and shall extend neither to the tolls established for the maintenance of the road, nor to duties levied on merchandize or goods intended to be sold or consumed in the interior. The same reservation shall apply to the communication granted to the Swiss between the Vallais and the canton of Geneva; and the different governments, shall for this purpose take such measures as, by common agreement, they shall judge necessary, either for taxation or for preventing contraband trade in their territories, respectively.\n\nART. LXXXI. With a view to the establishing of reciprocal compensations, the cantons of Argovia, Vaud, Tessin, and St. Gall, shall furnish to the ancient cantons of Schwitz, Unterwald, Uri, Claris, Zug and Appenzell (Rhode Interior) a sum of money to be applied to purposes of public instruction, and to the expenses of general administration, but principally to the former object, in the said cantons.\n\nThe quota, manner of payment, and division of this pecuniary compensation, are fixed as follows:\n\nThe cantons of Argovia, Vaud, and St. Gall, shall furnish to the cantons of Schwitz, Unterwald, Uri, Zug, Claris, and Appenzell (Rhode Interior) a fund of 500,000 Swiss livres.\n\nEach of the former cantons shall pay the interest of its quota, at the rate of five per cent, per annum, or have the option of discharging the principal either in money or funded property.\n\nThe division, either of the payment or receipt of these funds, shall be made according to the scale of contributions laid down for providing the federal expenses.\n\nThe canton of Tessin shall pay every year to the canton of Uri, a moiety of the produce of the tolls in the Levantine valley.\n\nART.
