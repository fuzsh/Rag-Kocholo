        "text": "Several years ago I saw the 1987 film \"Black Widow\" which was about two women, Debra Winger as an FBI analyst and Theresa Russell as a woman who marries men for their money and then kills them. Debra begins following Theresa hoping to catch her.\n\nTheresa is working on her next target, a wealthy Seattle man who collects coins. She has gotten some coin catalogs from libraries and book stores and is reading them.\n\nCoin catalog page showing ancient coins\n\nThe page is Plate 28 of Carthaginian Gold and Electrum Coins by G.K. Jenkins and R.B. Lewis, published in 1963 by the Royal Numismatic Society of Great Britain.\n\nTheresa meets the Seattle man and when he shows her a coin from his coin collection:\n\nSeattle man's coin magnified\n\nTheresa tells him that \"That's Felice Baciocchi and his sister Elisa.\"\n\nThe coin is a silver 5 Franchi (francs) crown of the Italian Principality of Lucca and Piombino.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte gave the provinces of Lucca and Piombino to his sister Elisa and her husband Felice Baciocchi in 1805 and the couple held them from 1805 to 1814. These coins were minted from 1805 to 1808.\n\nWell, I had to have one and now I do:\n\nItaly Lucca and Piombino 5 Franchi 1805\n\nSilver, 37.0 mm, 24.83 gm, minted at Florence\n\nObverse:\n\nBusts of Felice Baciocchi and Elisa Bonaparte\n\nFELICE ED ELISA PP DI LUCCA E PIOMBINO\n\n(Felice and Elisa Prince and Princess of Lucca and Piombino)\n\nReverse:\n\nPRINCIPATO DI LUCCA E PIOMBINO 1805\n\n(Principality of Lucca and Piombino)\n\nI agree, I managed to work it out a while after I posted.\n\nNumista shows three different obverses for the 5 Franci, and the one in the film is the middle one."
