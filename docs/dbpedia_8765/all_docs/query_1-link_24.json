The sea became a majorÂ theatre of warÂ against Napoleon's allies. During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies. On land the major battles includedÂ Battle of Raszyn,Â Battle of Aspern-Essling, andÂ Battle of Wagram.\n\nSurrender of Madrid (Gros), 1808. Napoleon enters Spain's capital during the Peninsular War\n\n( Click image to enlarge)\n\nOn land, the Fifth Coalition attempted few extensive military endeavours. One, theÂ Walcheren ExpeditionÂ of 1809, involved a dual effort by the British Army and the Royal Navy to relieve AustrianAustrian Empire was a Central-Eastern European and multinational great power from 1804 to 1867, created by proclamation out of the realms of the Habsburgs. During its existence, it was the third most populous monarchy in Europe after the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom. Along with Prussia, it was one of the two major powers of the German Confederation. The empire was proclaimed by Francis II in 1804 in response to Napoleon's declaration of the First French Empire.Austrian forces under intense French pressure. It ended in disaster after the Army commander,Â John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, failed to capture the objective, the naval base of French-controlledÂ Antwerp. For the most part of the years of the Fifth Coalition, British military operations on land (apart from the Iberian Peninsula) remained restricted to hit-and-run operations executed by the Royal Navy, which dominated the sea after having beaten down almost all substantial naval opposition from FranceFrance, officially the French Republic is transcontinental country predominantly located in Western Europe and spanning overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. France and its allies and blockading what remained of France's naval forces in heavily fortified French-controlled ports. These rapid-attack operations were aimed mostly at destroying blockaded French naval and mercantile shipping and the disruption of French supplies, communications, and military units stationed near the coasts. Often, when British allies attempted military actions within several dozen miles or so of the sea, the Royal Navy would arrive, land troops and supplies, and aid the coalition's land forces in a concerted operation. Royal Navy ships even provided artillery support against French units when fighting strayed near enough to the coastline. The ability and quality of the land forces governed these operations. For example, when operating with inexperienced guerrilla forces in SpainSpain or the Kingdom of Spain, is a country primarily located in southwestern Europe with parts of territory in the Atlantic Ocean and across the Mediterranean Sea. A major country of the Age of Discovery, Spain began the colonization of the New World in 1492 developing one of the largest empires in history and underpinned the emergence of a global trading system primarily fuelled by precious metals.Spain, the Royal Navy sometimes failed to achieve its objectives because of the lack of manpower that the Navy's guerrilla allies had promised to supply.\n\nEconomic warfare continued: the FrenchÂ Continental SystemÂ against the British naval blockade of French-controlled territory. Due to military shortages and lack of organization in French territory, many breaches of the Continental System occurred as French-dominated states tolerated or even encouraged trade with British smugglers. In terms of economic damage to Great BritainThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was a sovereign state in Northwestern Europe that comprised the entirety of the British Isles between 1801 and 1922. The United Kingdom, having financed the European coalition that defeated France during the Napoleonic Wars, developed a large Royal Navy that enabled the British Empire to become the foremost world power for the next century.Great Britain, the blockade was largely ineffective. As NapoleonNapoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon Bonaparte Â»Napoleon realised that extensive trade was going through Spain and RussiaRussian Empire was an empire and the final period of the Russian monarchy from 1721 to 1917, ruling across large parts of Eurasia. The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighbouring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth, Qajar Iran, the Ottoman Empire, and Qing China. Russia remains the third-largest empire in history, surpassed only by the British Empire and the Mongol Empire.Russia, he invaded those two countries. He tied down his forces in Spain, and lost very badly in Russia in 1812.\n\nBoth sides entered further conflicts in attempts to enforce their blockade; the British fought the United States in theÂ War of 1812Â (1812â15), and the French engaged in theÂ Peninsular WarÂ (1808â14) to prevent smuggling into Spain. The Iberian conflict began when Portugal continued trade with Britain despite French restrictions. When Spain failed to maintain the Continental System, the uneasy Spanish alliance with France ended in all but name. French troops gradually encroached on Spanish territory until they occupiedÂ Madrid, and installed a client monarchy. This provoked an explosion of popular rebellions across Spain. Heavy British involvement soon followed.\n\nAustria, previously an ally of France, took the opportunity to attempt to restore its imperial territories in Germany as held prior to Austerlitz. Austria achieved some initial victories against the thinly spread army of MarshalÂ Berthier. Napoleon had left Berthier with only 170,000 men to defend France's entire eastern frontier (in the 1790s, 800,000 men had carried out the same task, but holding a much shorter front).\n\nAfter defeats in Spain suffered by France, Napoleon took charge and enjoyed success, retaking Madrid, defeating the Spanish and forcing a withdrawal of the heavily out-numbered British army from the Iberian Peninsula (Battle of Corunna, 16 January 1809). But when he left, theÂ guerrilla warÂ against his forces in the countryside continued to tie down great numbers of troops. Austria's attack prevented Napoleon from successfully wrapping up operations against British forces by necessitating his departure for Austria, and he never returned to the Peninsular theatre. The British then sent in a fresh army underÂ Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington)Â whom the French could not stop.\n\nThe Peninsular war proved a major disaster for France. Napoleon did well in when he was in direct charge, but that followed severe losses, and was followed by worse losses. He severely underestimated how much manpower would be needed. Spain proved to be a major, long-term drain on money, manpower and prestige. Historian David Gates called it the \"Spanish ulcer.\"Â France lost the Peninsular War; Napoleon realised it had been a disaster for his cause, writing later, \"That unfortunate war destroyed meÂ ... All the circumstances of my disasters are bound up in that fatal knot.\"\n\nThe Austrians drove into theÂ Duchy of Warsaw, but suffered defeat at theÂ Battle of RaszynÂ on 19 April 1809. The Polish army capturedÂ West GaliciaÂ following its earlier success.\n\nNapoleon assumed personal command in the east and bolstered the army there for his counter-attack on Austria. After a few small battles, the well-run campaign forced the Austrians to withdraw from Bavaria, and Napoleon advanced into Austria. His hurried attempt to cross theÂ DanubeÂ resulted in the majorÂ Battle of Aspern-EsslingÂ (22 May 1809) â Napoleon's first significant tactical defeat. But the Austrian commander,Â Archduke Charles, failed to follow up on his indecisive victory, allowing Napoleon to prepare and seize Vienna in early July. He defeated the Austrians atÂ Wagram, on 5â6 July. (It was during the middle of that battle thatÂ Marshal BernadotteÂ was stripped of his command after retreating contrary to Napoleon's orders. Shortly thereafter, Bernadotte took up the offer from Sweden to fill the vacant position of Crown Prince there. Later he actively participated in wars against his former Emperor.)\n\nThe War of the Fifth Coalition ended with theÂ Treaty of SchÃ¶nbrunnÂ (14 October 1809). In the east, only theÂ TyroleseÂ rebels led byÂ Andreas HoferÂ continued to fight the French-Bavarian army until finally defeated in November 1809; in the west the Peninsular War continued.\n\nIn 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. On the continent, the British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon (behind their impregnableÂ lines of Torres Vedras) and toÂ besieged Cadiz.\n\nThe French Empire in Europe in 1812, near its peak extent\n\n( Click image to enlarge)\n\nNapoleon marriedÂ Marie-Louise, an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir (something his first wife, Josephine, had failed to do). As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included:\n\ntheÂ Kingdom of Denmark\n\ntheÂ Kingdom of SpainÂ (underÂ Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's elder brother)\n\ntheÂ Kingdom of WestphaliaÂ (JÃ©rÃ´me Bonaparte, Napoleon's younger brother)\n\ntheÂ Kingdom of NaplesÂ (underÂ Joachim Murat, husband of Napoleon's sisterÂ Caroline)\n\ntheÂ Principality of Lucca and PiombinoÂ (underÂ Elisa BonaparteÂ (Napoleon's sister) and her husbandÂ Felice Baciocchi);\n\nand Napoleon's former enemies, Sweden, PrussiaThe Kingdom of Prussia was a German kingdom that constituted the state of Prussia between 1701 and 1918. It was the driving force behind the unification of Germany in 1871 and was the leading state of the German Empire until its dissolution in 1918. Although it took its name from the region called Prussia, it was based in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Its capital was Berlin.Prussia and Austria.\n\nOutline of the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815)\n\nHISTORIC BATTLES\n\nNapoleonic Wars (1803-1815)\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. View Historic Battle Â»\n\nOverview: Britain ended the Treaty of Amiens and declared war on France in May 1803; one reason for this was Napoleon's changes to the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.\n\nPolitical Effects: In most European countries, subjugation in the French Empire brought with it many liberal features of the French Revolution including democracy, due process in courts, abolition of serfdom, reduction of the power of the Catholic Church, and a demand for constitutional limits on monarchs.\n\nMilitary Legacy: The scale of warfare dramatically enlarged during the Revolutionary and subsequent Napoleonic Wars.\n\nBritain and France 1803â1814: Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803.\n\nThird Coalition 1805: In response, Napoleon seriously considered an invasion of Great Britain, and massed 180,000 troops at Boulogne.\n\nFourth Coalition 1806â1807: In July 1806, Napoleon formed the Confederation of the Rhine out of the many tiny German states which constituted the Rhineland and most other western parts of Germany.\n\nFifth Coalition 1809: During the time of the Fifth Coalition, the Royal Navy won a succession of victories in the French colonies.\n\nInvasion of Russia 1812: But Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810, and the Russian war with Britain effectively ended. In April 1812, Britain, Russia and Sweden signed secret agreements directed against Napoleon.\n\nSixth Coalition 1812â1814: Seeing an opportunity in Napoleon's historic defeat, Prussia, Sweden, Austria, and several German states re-entered the war.\n\nSeventh Coalition 1815: The Seventh Coalition (1815) pitted Britain, Russia, Prussia, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and several German states against France.\n\nHISTORY"
