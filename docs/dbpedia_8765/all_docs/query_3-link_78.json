        "text": "Entrepreneurs, merchants, boat owners and masters, fishermen, privateers, etc. involved in coral fishing business in southern Europe The present release 1.4 of this document differs from the previous release 1.3 for the insertion of new information mainly concerning - involvement of some coral people in the French religious wars and related consequences (end 16th century); - reasons for the change of the Ligurian fishermen's villages of origin (18th century).\n\nThe relationship between humans and marine resources was important in the past and remains so in the present. Herring represented one of Europe’s largest commodity trades around ad 1400. Stockfish linked the far north with urban Europe. Changes in the fortunes of the herring and cod trades had major economic, social and political ramifications. Today, when c. 17% of the world’s animal protein supply is provided by fish, and per capita fish consumption is growing, cod are already vulnerable to overfishing. Research on the history of fishing and the archaeology of fish bones is thus far from esoteric. Yet there is a need for better temporal and geographical coverage, improved chronological resolution and greater comparability between data – combined with continuing methodological development and a humanist’s sense of the contingencies of history. These are achievable objectives. They must also be priorities if we are to understand the past in its own terms, without the back-projection of teleological thinking, and if we are to accurately comprehend how much the Anthropocene differs from conditions of the (not so distant) Middle Ages.\n\n\"Current concerns about the survival of marine life and the fishing industry have contributed to a rising interest in their past development. While much of the scholarship is focused on the recent past, this collection of essays presents new interpretations in the pre-industrial history of the fisheries by highlighting the consequences of the northern fisheries through an interdisciplinary approach, including the environment, economy, politics, and society in the medieval and early modern periods. A wide variety of topics related to the fisheries, such as settlement and spatial organisation, processing methods, trade, profitability and taxation, consumption, communication and cooperation, ranging from the Viking Age until industrialisation are dealt with in a long term perspective, offering new insights in the intriguing relationship between marine life and humanity.
