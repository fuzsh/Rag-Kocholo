        "text": "Since Finley’s ‘World of Ulysses’ gift-exchange has been widely used by classicists to explain social relations and interactions in Greco-Roman society. It has been interpreted as the underlying rationale of Greek philia and Roman amicitia, of ritualized guest-friendship, patronage, inter-state relations, political alliances, credit and sureties, and so forth. In this paper, I argue that the explanatory force of the concept has been overstretched. Although gift-exchange was important both morally and practically it was not the only or even the dominant principle of interpersonal relations in Greco-Roman society. In many cases it was no more than a symbolic frame of reference actively used to justify social claims and actions that had little to do with gift-exchange as such.\n\nThe Burgundian duke Charles the Bold (1433-1477) was not particularly well known for his liberality. According to De Barante, the nineteenth century historian of the Burgundian dukes, he was seen by his officers and the nobles as ‘bien avare et peu liberal pour un prince si jeune et si nouveau’. One of this article’s purposes is to investigate this claim, but my larger concern is to make sense of the patterns of gift-giving evidenced by the available sources. Although we do not have complete records of all Charles’s gift giving, the account of the highest financial officer, the argentier, combined with the household ordinances and a few narrative sources, provide a good overview of the importance and nature of gift-giving in Charles’s court. These texts reveal a charged and unstable culture of gift-giving, one in which the category of ‘gift’ itself is in some disarray and where bureaucratic pressures both distort the gift and ntensify Charles’s need to deploy gifts in order to secure his power."
