        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History of Pooja\n\nPooja is a popular and meaningful name deeply rooted in Indian culture and tradition. It is a name predominantly used among Hindus and is commonly given to baby girls. Pooja carries a beautiful and profound meaning. In Sanskrit, Pooja is derived from another name, Puja, which means ‘worship’ or ‘honor.’ Therefore, the name can mean ‘offering of reverence.’ It reflects the deep spiritual and religious values that are prevalent in Indian society.\n\nWhile there are no widely recognized historical figures named Pooja who have achieved international fame, the name has been borne by countless contemporary individuals who have contributed to their communities and professions. One such figure is Pooja Hegde. She is a popular Indian actress and model who has worked in Telugu and Hindi films. She was awarded the SIIMA Award for Best Actress – Telugu for two separate movies in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe name Pooja is typically pronounced as POO-jah. The pronunciation is quite simple and follows the natural phonetics of the English language. Pooj, Poo, and Poochie are some of the cutest nicknames you can consider for your little one.\n\nIn the world of fiction, the name Pooja has not been used as extensively as other Indian names. However, certain films in the Indian film industry have left a mark on people, and therefore, the name Pooja. It is the name of four separate Indian movies from 1940, 1967, 1975, and 2010. Pooja “Poo” Sharma is a well-recognized character from the Indian movie Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, where Kareena Kapoor essayed the role. In the movie Dream Girl, Karamveer Singh is a middle-class man who can impersonate a female voice and, thus, adopts the name Pooja while working at a call center. Another notable character is Pooja from the Indian movie Dil Toh Pagal Hain, portrayed by the celebrated actress Madhuri Dixit. These fictional characters named Pooja come from diverse backgrounds and serve various roles in their respective stories.\n\nHow To Pronounce Pooja?\n\n‘Pooja’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Pooja\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Pooja famous with their contributions in various fields.

However, in popular culture, it is often narrowed down to the sun sign, which depends on the person’s birth date.There are 12 zodiac signs, each having dominant traits, planetary rulers, elemental connection, and more.\n\nZodiac sign or Sun sign\n\nThe Earth’s orbit around the sun is divided into 12 zodiac signs covering 30-degree sectors. According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year.
