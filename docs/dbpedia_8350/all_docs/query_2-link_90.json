        "text": "Poojaâ€™s long term goal is to find a position in France as a full time researcher in Astrophysics.\n\nWhy choose to stay in France ? France offers the life balance she was hoping for. Furthermore, she is learning French and has a nice working environment at the University of Strasbourg. Leaving would mean starting all over again, including learning a new language. Meanwhile, she is considering applying for French citizenship to avoid the need to renew her residence permit, as India does not yet allow dual nationality.\n\nWhy not choose the private sector ? Pooja is aware of her two options between the private sector and the academic sector. Nevertheless, transitioning to the private sector would mean leaving astrophysics, the field she is passionate about. Although positions could be more stable in the private sector, she wants to continue doing astrophysics research."
