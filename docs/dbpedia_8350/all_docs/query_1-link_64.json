        "text": "Miss Pooja Sharma is a devoted career counsellor and counselling psychologist. She has a passion for counselling and guiding others for their highest good. She dedicates ample time to learning more about new emerging career fields to guide others to the best. After hitting rock bottom in life she herself rose like a phoenix after getting a career counselling session.\n\nShe is aware of the importance of career counselling and guidance and does her best to be a beacon of light to those who feel lost on their way to success. She completed her certifications from ISCHS Bangalore in September 2022 began her own unique journey and is moving forward. Also, she has noticed a significant rise in anxiety and fear among youngsters and parents regarding the career selection process and she does her best to bring awareness to individuals as well as parents.\n\nIn this era of cut-throat competition it's difficult to rely on Google and school teachers for career guidance and selection as individuals are limited to few options and Google talks about all those fields that may or may not serve you well in the future so to solve this issue Miss Pooja uses A.I. based psychometric assessments which guides a person not in just understanding themselves better but also in choosing long term career satisfaction. She hopes to guide as many students and professionals as she can."
