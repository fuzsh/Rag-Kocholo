Her past training experiences have included work with homeless adults with severe mental illness and trauma, community mental health, school-based therapy for children, and outpatient clinic work with families and children. She has pursued training in play therapy in both her pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training at the Ann Martin Center, respectively. While at Ann Martin Center she worked with children who have suffered trauma, children on the Autism Spectrum, high-conflict separations, and couples work.\n\nPrior to attending the Wright Institute, Dr. Sharma worked at Mills College as a Career Counselor. During this time, Dr. Sharma created an internship program for students, and helped students refine their career and academic interests. Dr. Sharma also worked for the Canadian Federal Government for several years as an assessor for executive level employees seeking career advancement.\n\nHer clinical interests are broad, and include culture, immigrant identity and experience, issues related to motherhood and parenting, early emotional experience, attachment, intergenerational trauma, non-directive play therapy, grief and loss, and high-conflict separations. She is consistently curious about the interactions between gender, the internalization of oppression, and the immigrant experience."
