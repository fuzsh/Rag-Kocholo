        "text": "Jimmy Fallon and his wife of 12 years, Nancy Juvonen, are raising two beautiful children together, daughters Winnie, 6, and Franny, 5— a duo viewers of “The Tonight Show: At Home Edition” have gotten to know well in recent weeks.\n\nBut there was a time the couple wasn’t sure when or how kids would ever be in the cards for them. That’s a topic they discussed candidly during the latest installment of “Ask the Fallons.”\n\nWhen a viewer sent in a question about when they knew they were ready to have children, the couple both agreed that it was a foregone conclusion from the start.\n\n“That was always the plan, right?” Fallon said.\n\nJuvonen agreed, adding, “It wasn’t even an: ‘Are you ready?’ It was just like, ‘Now how are you going to do this?’ and that was a whole other question.”\n\nIt’s a question that took years to answer, as they faced a long series of fertility struggles. Or, as she put it, “Five years of really, really, really, really, really deciding not to give up.”"
