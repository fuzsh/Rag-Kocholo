Like many people they have an emotional connection to the lake. Still think the PTB are pushing Leno out too early for Fallon, but it is what it is:)\n\nAguamenti\n\nApparently he vacations at the lake. Wondered where?\n\nI have heard they have a home on Sewell Road in Wolfeboro.

He was at the 4th of July parade in Wolfeboro this year.\n\nJimmy's wife Nancy parents have a home at point of Sewell Road. Jim dated Nancy several summers at the her parents home. Jimmy is also good friends with Drew Barrymore who stays at a home not far from Nancy's parents. If you come around the lighted marker at the very Sewell Road point there is a flag pole on a dock and that is where the folklore says Jimmy proposed to Nancy. Very nice story now that they named their daughter after their favorite lake."
