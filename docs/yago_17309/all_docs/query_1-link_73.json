        "text": "Jimmy Fallon is now a father, thanks to the recent arrival of daughter Winnie Rose, but the \"Late Night\" host says that becoming parents was not easy for him and his wife.\n\nIn an interview that aired on Tuesday's \"Today\" show, Fallon revealed that before he and Nancy Juvonen welcomed Winnie via a surrogate, the couple struggled for five years to start a family.\n\n\"We've tried a bunch of things,\" he said. \"Anyone who's tried will know, it's just awful.\"\n\nSpeaking with \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie, Fallon explained that after sharing past attempts and disappointments with friends and family, they decided not to tell anyone they were expecting this time.\n\n\"We tried before, we told people and then it didn't happen,\" he recalled. \"And it's just really depressing. It's really hard on everybody.\"\n\nBut Winnie is now here, and the future \"Tonight Show\" host says the 3-week-old baby girl has turned him to \"mush.\" He also revealed the inspiration behind her name.\n\n\"It's not Winnie-the-Pooh at all ... though I do love Winnie-the-Pooh,\" he said. \"My wife and I got engaged in New Hampshire at this lake house that her family's had forever, and it's on Lake Winnipesaukee. And so we went there every summer as we were dating.\"\n\n\"And yeah, Winnie from 'The Wonder Years' is the coolest girl in any TV show ever,\" he added. \"And also, she's a 'win' for us.\""
