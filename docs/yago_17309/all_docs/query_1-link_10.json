        "text": "Jimmy Fallon is married to Nancy Juvonen.\n\nThe two tied the knot in 2007.\n\nNancy is a film producer who helped produce The Tonight Show when Jimmy hosted it from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSome wondered if Jimmy would do the same following the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\nJimmy Fallon, 48, is often cracking jokes on his late-night talk show, but one thing that’s definitely no joke for Jimmy is his marriage to Nancy Juvonen, 56. The Tonight Show host and Nancy, a film producer, got married in 2007, and they will celebrate their 16th wedding anniversary this coming December. The couple has since expanded their family by welcoming two children: daughters Winnie Rose and Frances Cole.\n\nOver the years, Jimmy and Nancy have enjoyed a blissful marriage filled with lots of love and lots of laughs. “You really want to pick someone who you don’t have to like every single thing the same, but you kind of have to have the same values in a way,” Jimmy said on The Tonight Show in June 2020. “What makes you both laugh is fun because then you laugh together at the same stuff.”\n\nIn May 2023, Jimmy was poised to spend a lot more time with his wife and kids. The Tonight Show, along with the rest of late-night – The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel! Live – went dark after the Writers Guild of America went on strike. The guild was demanding better compensation from studios and streamers, and Jimmy showed solidarity with the union.\n\n“I wouldn’t have a show if it [weren’t] for my writers, and I support them all the way,” he said when speaking to Variety when attending the 2023 Met Gala. “They’ve got to have a fair contract, and there’s a lot of stuff to iron out. … Whatever I can do to support the guild. I’m actually in the guild as well, so yeah. I couldn’t do my show without them. I support my whole staff.”\n\nBelow, learn everything you need to know about Nancy and her marriage to Jimmy.\n\nHow Did Jimmy & Nancy Meet?\n\nNancy was born in Connecticut on May 18, 1967, and raised in Mill Valley, California. She graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in sociology in cooperative education. In the early 2000s, Nancy met Jimmy on the set of Saturday Night Live when she was accompanying close pal Drew Barrymore, who was hosting that week’s episode. “I kind of crept in quietly, and all of a sudden Jimmy goes, ‘Hey, Nancy! You’re Nancy? Hi, it’s so nice to meet you, welcome!’ “Nancy recalled of meeting her husband on The Tonight Show when she appeared in 2020. “And I felt just so embraced and cool, like, ‘Thank you! Thank you for welcoming me in.”\n\nBut Jimmy and Nancy’s romance did not heat up until the two worked together on the 2005 rom-com Fever Pitch. The movie starred Jimmy and Drew and was produced by Flower Films, the production company that Nancy started with Drew.\n\n“We were on location, and that really creates this, like, camp feel for everybody,” said Nancy during an Ask The Fallons segment during the COVID-19 pandemic. “And he was just so friendly and fun and welcoming, and he loved music. When I really developed a crush was when [co-producer] Bradley Thomas’ kids came to set. He had a little girl named Lucy and a little boy named Charlie. I played with Lucy and Jimmy played with Charlie and really played, like really into it, as if they’d come to visit us, and so, I think that’s when my heart just sort of melted even more.”\n\nAfter the film wrapped, Nancy and Jimmy kept in touch. They eventually reconnected in London while promoting the film. From there, the romance was officially a go.\n\nWhen Did Jimmy & Nancy Get Married?\n\nAfter roughly two years of dating, Jimmy proposed to Nancy at her family home in New Hampshire in August 2007. On December 22, they got married on Necker Island in the Caribbean. The island is owned by billionaire Richard Branson, who just so happened to be a big fan of Jimmy. The wedding guest list included around “12 people,” the couple said on a “Ask the Fallons” Tonight Show segment, and they had a “rager time.”\n\n“It was so much fun,” Jimmy said of his wedding day. Nancy explained that two days after the wedding, all the guests left, with the exception of Drew, who remained on the tropical island with the couple and staff to keep the celebrations going. “Hands down, one of the best days and nights of my life,” Jimmy gushed.\n\nJimmy & Nancy Have Two Children\n\nJimmy and Nancy expanded their family from two to three when they welcomed their first child, daughter Winnie Rose in 2013. The following year, they welcomed a daughter, Frances Cole. Both kids were born via surrogate due to Nancy struggling with fertility. “We’ve tried a bunch of things. Anyone who’s tried will know, it’s just awful,” Jimmy said on Today after Winnie was born.\n\nSince welcoming their two bundles of joy, Jimmy and Nancy have been so happy to have their family of four complete. Winnie and Frances have occasionally appeared on their dad’s late-night talk show, leading to many adorable and hilarious family moments. In May 2020, Jimmy told PEOPLE that he even “bribes” his kids to stop them from interrupting his interviews. “There’s no sense in me going, ‘Hey, listen to Daddy. We’re doing a monologue here.’ They’d just be like, ‘What? What are you talking about?'” Jimmy said.\n\nNancy Is A Film Producer\n\nWhile Jimmy is obviously successful with his Emmy Award-winning talk show, his wife is no slouch in the entertainment industry either. Nancy co-founded the production company Flower Films, which she started with Drew. The two met in 1993 through Nancy’s brother Jim, a writer and producer who was working on the 1995 film Mad Love, which Drew starred in.\n\nFlower Films is based in L.A. and has produced several hit films. Among them are Never Been Kissed, Charlie’s Angels, 50 First Dates, He’s Just Not That Into You, How to Be Single, and The Stand In. Flower Films also produced Drew’s Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet and Drew’s ongoing daytime talk show, The Drew Barrymore Show.\n\nJimmy Fallon’s Top Moments With Nancy Juvonen"
