        "text": "Hollywood has been known for long as the glitzy world of flashy dreams and shattered romances. And more often these two happen together, as young faces struggle to make a name for themselves in the industry, while making new bonds and leaving old ones behind. Comedian and actor Jimmy Fallon’s rise to stardom is one such inspirational story, but his obliviousness to romantic hints is just as hilarious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he married Nancy Juvonen in 2007, Fallon had associations with a number of beautiful actresses, such as Nicole Kidman and Kate Hudson. However, the comedian failed to pick up on their clues, either due to being too focused on his career, or flat-out believing he never had a chance.\n\nLet’s have a look at how Jimmy Fallon missed out on his chances of dating two of the most alluring women in Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicole Kidman thought Jimmy Fallon was “gay”\n\nWhile building up his career as a comedian, Jimmy Fallon also took up a bunch of roles in the acting industry. Now he has his own talk show, and back in 2015, he invited actress Nicole Kidman for an interview. During the chat, Kidman recalled how she had a crush on him back in 2005, when she was filming for Bewitched.\n\nThe host was visibly shocked, admitting that he had no idea it was a date. He exclaimed, looking at the audience, “Did I date Nicole Kidman? Did we go on a date?”\n\nKidman then reminisced how a mutual friend had arranged the meet, the actress going over to Fallon’s house for a chemistry read. However, it was a disaster of a date, as she described,\n\n“Well it was like a hang and then you put a video game on or something and I was like, ‘This is so bad. And you didn’t talk at all. So after about an hour and a half, I thought, ‘He has no interest, this is so embarrassing.’ And I kind of left, and went, ‘OK, no chemistry.’ And then I was like, ‘Maybe he’s gay!’”\n\nDespite laughing it off at the moment, Jimmy Fallon still feels the embarrassment to this day, and recently talked about it on 20 Questions: On Deadline.\n\nJimmy Fallon also blew his chance with Kate Hudson\n\nJimmy Fallon must have been quite the handsome hunk back in the day, as he attracted not just Kidman but more Hollywood hotties. The second most famous example of this is actress Kate Hudson, whom he met on the set of the 2000 comedy film Almost Famous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two got close and spent a lot of time together. However, Jimmy Fallon’s classic obliviousness made him lose his shot with the LA-born beauty. Back in December 2018, Fallon admitted to Margot Robbie he had a crush on Kate Hudson during those days while playing a game. Hudson visited The Tonight Show in 2020 (online) where she recalled seeing that clip, and said:\n\n“I had like 100 people send me that clip. Can I just tell you what happened to me as I was listening to [it?] I was like… I had no idea. I wish people could have been in my body to watch you and I’s relationship and friendship because you gave me no indication [that you were into me].”\n\nHudson went on to reveal she was into Fallon too at the time, which further crushed his spirits. Poor Jimmy Fallon!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Fallon is happily married to Nancy Juvonen right now and shares two daughters, Winnie, aged 10, and Frances, aged 9, with the film producer.\n\nWatch The Tonight Show episodes on NBC."
