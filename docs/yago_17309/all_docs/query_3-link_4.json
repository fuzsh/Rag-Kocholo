        "text": "Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen met on “Saturday Night Live” in 2004.\n\nThey met again during filming of “Fever Pitch,” where Juvonen was a producer.\n\nTheir friendship turned romantic, leading to a brief engagement and marriage in 2007.\n\nJimmy Fallon, the famous late-night TV host, met his wife, Nancy Juvonen, on the set of “Saturday Night Live” in 2004. At the time, Fallon was a cast member and Juvonen was there supporting her friend Drew Barrymore, who was hosting.\n\nThey met again while working on the movie “Fever Pitch,” where Juvonen was a producer and Fallon was co-starring with Barrymore. Their friendship quickly turned into a romantic relationship, leading to a brief engagement and marriage in December 2007 on Sir Richard Branson’s private island.\n\nToday, Fallon and Juvonen live in New York with their two daughters, Winnie Rose and Frances Cole, and their dog, Gary.\n\nJuvonen became friends with Drew Barrymore in 1993, thanks to her brother Jim. He introduced them while working as a producer’s assistant on the film “Mad Love.” Juvonen later moved to Los Angeles and started a production company with Barrymore.\n\nIn 1995, Juvonen and Barrymore founded Flower Films. The production company produced several successful films and TV shows starring Barrymore, including “Never Been Kissed,” “Charlie’s Angels,” and “Santa Clarita Diet.”\n\nBefore becoming a producer, Juvonen worked various jobs, including on a dude ranch in Wyoming, cleaning houses in San Francisco, and being a flight attendant.\n\nJuvonen met Fallon on “Saturday Night Live” in 2004. Their paths crossed again during the filming of “Fever Pitch,” where they bonded over their love of music and friendly nature. Seeing Fallon interact with another producer’s kids made Juvonen fall for him even more.\n\nFallon proposed at Juvonen’s family home in New Hampshire, and they married on Necker Island in 2007. They have two daughters, Winnie Rose and Frances Cole, born via surrogate in 2013 and 2014.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Juvonen created a pod school for their daughters and some neighbors. She transformed their home into a school with old lockers and materials from eBay, making it a productive learning environment."
