        "text": "Jimmy Fallon had huge shoes to fill when he took over for Jay Leno on The Tonight Show. Since then, he's made us laugh uncontrollably! Thankfully, he's had a great woman by his side the entire time to help him with his transition from Saturday Night Live to late-night talk show host, Nancy Juvonen.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum has been married to wife Nancy Juvonen since 2007, and it's clear he absolutely adores her. Who is Jimmy Fallon's wife? Get to know her and we bet you'll see why he can't get enough of her.\n\n1. She has a colorful job history.\n\nNancy Juvonen has seemingly had more careers than Barbie. She went to USC and studied sociology and cooperative education. She used those smarts for a wide array of odd jobs, including working on a dude ranch (we can hear Jimmy Fallon saying \"Duuuude!\" about that), at a mortgage firm, and as a flight attendant. (She'd later use her flight attendant experience in an uncredited cameo in Donnie Darko.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. She got her big break from a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.\n\nJuvonen became an assistant for the Boss' saxophone player, the late Clarence Clemons, in the 1990s.\n\n3. Her big brother helped her score her dream job.\n\nJuvonen's older brother, Jim, is a writer and producer. When he was working on the movie Mad Love in 1995, he introduced Nancy to Drew Barrymore. What an awesome big brother!\n\n4. She's produced some of your favorite movies.\n\nBarrymore convinced Juvonen to move to Los Angeles and get into film. They partnered for their production company, Flower Films, and have helped Barrymore star vehicles like Never Been Kissed, Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, Fever Pitch (in which Fallon co-starred) and He's Just Not That Into You.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. She and Jimmy Fallon had a whirlwind romance.\n\nJuvonen and Fallon were dating for only four months when he proposed, and they married just three months later. (He calls her the \"coolest girl in the world.\" Aw!) After years of struggling to have a child, they welcomed their beautiful baby daughters Winnie Rose Fallon in 2013, and Frances Cole in 2014, both born via gestational surrogate."
