Opening up to Savannah Guthrie on the Today Show soon after Winnie's birth, Jimmy said: \"My wife and I had been trying [for] a while to have a baby. We tried a bunch of things – so we had a surrogate.\"\n\nJimmy and Nancy have been married for over 15 years, but the pair would never have crossed paths if it wasn't for Nancy's friend and Flower Films co-partner, Drew Barrymore.\n\nMORE: Nicole Kidman and Jimmy Fallon recall their awkward 'first date' in hilarious throwback video\n\nBack in 2005, Drew and Jimmy co-starred in a baseball-themed romantic comedy called Fever Pitch. The film was produced by none other than Flower Films, which introduced the comedian to his future wife.\n\nJimmy and Nancy enjoyed a whirlwind romance, with the actor popping the question in the summer of 2007. They went on to tie the knot in December 2008 in the British Virgin Islands' Necker Island – Richard Branson's private island.\n\nSEE: Jimmy Fallon's marvellous $5.7m home looks like a theme park – see inside\n\nAway from the spotlight, the family-of-four enjoy a wholesome life in the Hamptons in their home complete with six bedrooms and five bathrooms.\n\nTheir home boasts a farmhouse, two cottages, two barns and an apple orchard, and it even has a slide! Nancy explained the rationale behind the slide, explaining in an at-home segment on the Tonight Show: \"The slide is in an old barn, and the only thing I knew that we wanted to do with the barn was put a slide in the middle of it.\""
