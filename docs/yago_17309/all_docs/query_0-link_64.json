        "text": "American talk show host and comedian (born 1974)\n\nJames Thomas Fallon (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, television host, actor, singer, writer, and producer. Best known for his work in television, Fallon's breakthrough came during his tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live from 1998 to 2004. He was the host of the late-night talk show Late Night with Jimmy Fallon from 2009 to 2014 and became the anchor of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon following his departure from Late Night.\n\nFallon grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to Los Angeles at 21 to pursue stand-up comedy. He was commissioned to join Saturday Night Live as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. During his six years on SNL, Fallon co-hosted the program's Weekend Update segment. He left the show in 2004 to star in films such as Taxi (2004) and Fever Pitch (2005).\n\nFollowing his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC in 2009, where he became known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that show to become the sixth permanent host of The Tonight Show in 2014. In addition to his television work, he has released two comedy albums and seven books, mainly aimed at children.\n\nEarly life\n\nJames Thomas Fallon was born in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on September 19, 1974, the son of Gloria (n√©e Feeley) and James Fallon.[1][2] His paternal grandmother was a German immigrant from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, while his maternal grandmother's father was a Norwegian immigrant from Fredrikstad.[3] Another set of his great-great-grandparents were an Irish couple from County Galway, with this great-great-grandmother herself being born to an Irish couple in France.[4][5]\n\nFallon's father spent his adolescence singing in street-corner doo-wop groups then served in the Vietnam War.[6] Shortly after his son's birth, he started working as a machine repairman for IBM in Kingston, New York.[7] In preparation, the family moved nearby to Saugerties, New York. Fallon has described his childhood as idyllic, while his parents have been described as overprotective.[8] He and his sister, Gloria, were unable to leave their home[9] and had to ride their bicycles in the backyard.[10] Fallon attended the Roman Catholic school St. Mary of the Snow. He considered becoming a priest, inspired by his experiences as an altar boy,[10][11] but became more interested in comedy instead. He spent many nights listening to the radio program The Dr. Demento Show, which exposed him to both comedy and music; he often recorded it on a reel-to-reel recorder.[8]\n\nAs a teenager, Fallon developed an obsession with the late-night comedy program Saturday Night Live. He watched it religiously, although he was only allowed to see \"the clean parts\" that his parents taped for him. He and Gloria would re-enact sketches such as \"The Festrunk Brothers\" with friends.[12] In his teens, he impressed his parents with impersonations, including of actor James Cagney[13][14] and comedian Dana Carvey.[15] He was musically inclined and started playing guitar at age 13, going on to perform comedy and music in contests and shows.[14] By his junior high years, he was labeled a class clown but was also described as \"nice and well-mannered\".[16]\n\nAt Saugerties High School, Fallon was a performer in most stage productions and was twice a class social director.[16] He won a young comedian's contest with an impression of Pee-wee Herman.[12] He graduated in 1992 and then attended The College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York, where he was a computer science major before switching to communications in his senior year. He was an average student who would perform stand-up comedy on weekends.[8] He would often board buses from his aunt's house in Fort Hamilton to perform sets at Carolines on Broadway in Times Square.[17] He did not graduate, leaving college a semester early to pursue a comedy career.\n\nFourteen years later, in May 2009, Fallon returned to receive a Bachelor of Arts in communications, awarded by Saint Rose officials who granted him experiential learning credits for his television work. He joined his classmates at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center to collect his degree, where along with his BA, he was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.[18][19]\n\nCareer\n\nComedy beginnings\n\nFallon dropped out of the College of Saint Rose in 1995 to move to Los Angeles and pursue comedy full-time.[20] He secured a manager and got bookings by the age of 21.[citation needed] He often did stand-up at the Improv, earning $7.50 per set,[6] and he joined classes with the Groundlings, an improv comedy troupe.[16] He appeared in the feature film The Scheme (originally entitled The Entrepreneurs). His one line in the 1997 film Father's Day was cut, but he can still be seen in the background. In 1998, Fallon appeared briefly on the show Spin City in the second season as a man selling photographs.[21]\n\nHe remained fixated on joining Saturday Night Live. After two years of working with the Groundlings,[22] he auditioned for the program in 1997 but was unsuccessful.[16] When he was cast in a pilot presentation for The WB, Fallon made sure to include a clause in his contract specifying that if he were to join SNL he would be released from his contract.[9] His manager sent videotapes to Marci Klein and Ayala Cohen, producers for SNL.[23]\n\nThis was my ultimate goal. If I ever cut into a birthday cake and made a wish, I would wish to be on SNL. If I threw a coin into a fountain, I would wish to be on SNL. If I saw a shooting star, I would wish to be on SNL.[23] ... I remember saying to myself, 'If I don't make it on [the show] before I'm 25, I'm going to kill myself.' It's crazy. I had no other plan. I didn't have friends, I didn't have a girlfriend, I didn't have anything going on. I had my career, that was it.[9]\n\nFallon landed his second audition at the age of 23. At the \"notoriously difficult audition,\"[24] he was told by several people that creator Lorne Michaels almost never laughed during auditions. He feared being outshined by the comic before him, who came armed with an arsenal of props. Despite this, Fallon went onstage and did well,[23] performing a \"celebrity walk-a-thon\" with impressions of Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Bill Cosby, and Adam Sandler, an SNL alumnus who had recently left the show.[25] Michaels and others laughed.[26]\n\nHead writer Tina Fey, who was in the room, later said, \"He's one of two people I've ever seen who was completely ready to be on the show. Kristen Wiig is the other one.... And Jimmy was ready‚Äîlike, if there had been a show to do that night.\"[24] He rushed through his original characters in order to arrive at his musical impressions, which he felt were stronger. Three weeks passed, and despite his feeling that he had not gotten the position, he was asked to meet with Michaels at the Paramount lot in Los Angeles. Michaels informed him that they wanted him for the show, and Fallon characterized the moment as being in \"slow motion\", remarking to Michaels before he left, \"I'm going to make you proud.\"[23]\n\nSaturday Night Live years\n\nEarly seasons (1998‚Äì2000)\n\nFallon debuted on Saturday Night Live as a featured player at the beginning of the show's twenty-fourth season in September 1998.[27] He became a star by his fourth episode, when he performed Halloween-themed versions of songs by popular artists, as well as his Sandler impression.[9] Fallon became a celebrity, considered charming by his largely female fan-base, receiving numerous letters from fans, and becoming the subject of numerous fan-sites.[6] He became the program's most featured mimic, doing popular impressions of Robert De Niro, Jerry Seinfeld, and Howard Stern. He also starred as many original characters, including Nick Burns, an IT support nerd, Pat \"Sully\" Sullivan, one of the Boston Teens with Rachel Dratch, and in Jarret's Room, a fictional webcast hosted by stoner college students Jarret (Fallon) and Gobi (Horatio Sanz). He was promoted to repertory player in his second season.[6]\n\nIn his off-time, Fallon released a book comprising e-mail exchanges with his sister Gloria, titled I Hate This Place: A Pessimist's Guide to Life (1999), and played a minor role in the film Almost Famous (2000).[6] During their time at SNL, Fallon and Horatio Sanz often drank together. Sanz has described himself and Fallon as \"super-functioning alcoholics\", and said, \"They say that kind of goes hand-in-hand with SNL, some kind of substance-abuse issues, because it's so stressful you easily find yourself blowing off steam a lot.\"[17] On one occasion, they spent a Friday night watching The Strokes perform a midnight show, staying up drinking until the early morning, despite having to do SNL that night.[28] \"We actually took what we thought being on SNL was, what people think is awesome about it, and we made it happen,\" said Sanz,[28] who said that he and Fallon got in more than a few bar fights.[17]\n\nLater years (2001‚Äì2004)\n\nFallon initially planned to spend three years at SNL, like John Belushi, but he was persuaded to stay on for three more when given the reins to Weekend Update.[17][29] His co-hosting of Weekend Update with writer Tina Fey further increased his profile.[10] During this tenure, he formed a close relationship with Michaels, whom he'd consult on dating, career advice, and more.[24] Fallon called a December 2001 sketch, in which he imitates Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger in a mirror opposite Jagger, his favorite thing he had done up to that point.[10]\n\nIn his later years on SNL, Fallon co-starred in a skit, \"The Barry Gibb Talk Show\", in which he and musician Justin Timberlake portrayed Bee Gees brothers Barry and Robin Gibb. It marked the beginning of a long-running friendship and collaboration with Timberlake.[30]\n\nFallon became known for his tendency to break character in sketches, an attribute he, as well as Michaels, disliked.[31] It began in the famous \"More Cowbell\" sketch, when Will Ferrell wore a tighter shirt than expected, causing Fallon to crack up. After this, other cast members would try to get Fallon to break.[9] Some cast members believed he was attempting to steal the moment, to make the sketch about himself. The joke became near-constant during Fallon's final year on the show.[9] During this time, Fallon parlayed his SNL success into co-hosting the 2001 MTV Movie Awards[32] and 2002 MTV Video Music Awards,[33] and recording his debut comedy album, The Bathroom Wall (2002), which was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. He also modeled for Calvin Klein.[22] Fallon was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in 2002, an honor Fallon found embarrassing.[34]\n\nFallon appeared in blackface in a 2000 episode of Saturday Night Live, impersonating Chris Rock.[35][36] After the sketch resurfaced online 20 years later, Fallon issued a tweet apologizing for an \"unquestionably offensive decision\".[37]\n\nFilm career (2004‚Äì2008)\n\nFallon began to pursue a film career in 2004. He had spurned most major roles due to lack of time and disinterest in the dozens of scripts he read.[16] He signed on for his first lead role in Taxi, a remake of a French film, after co-star Queen Latifah became attached to the project. He was also attracted to the film's action comedy tone, seeing comparisons with SNL alumnus Eddie Murphy's first big film, 48 Hrs. (1982).[38]\n\nIn the fall of 2003, he split his time between shooting the film in Los Angeles and returning to New York City for SNL.[16] With his contract ending, his sixth season at SNL was his last; Fallon signed off at the conclusion of the show's twenty-ninth season in May 2004.[39]\n\nWith big expectations from the studio, Taxi premiered in the fall of 2004. A flop with critics and audiences, it was Fallon's first failure.[9] 20th Century Fox had already signed him for his second major role, starring opposite Drew Barrymore in the 2005 romantic comedy Fever Pitch.[16] Fever Pitch fared little better than Taxi, receiving mild reviews and tepid box office returns.[40] He met his wife, producer Nancy Juvonen, during production of the film, and the two wed in December 2007.\n\nFallon began receiving fewer film offers. He had entered what he has called a \"lost period\", drinking more alcohol and beset by confusion over his next career moves.[8] Fallon moved back east to New York, spending \"a couple of years aimlessly knocking around.\"[17] He wrote a screenplay during this time \"about a guy in a goth band who has to pretend to be a country-music star.\"[9]\n\nBefore leaving SNL, Michaels had told Fallon that he would be a good fit to take over NBC's Late Night franchise when then-host Conan O'Brien left for The Tonight Show. Michaels urged NBC to give Fallon a holding deal in February 2007 so that he could not be lured elsewhere.[40]\n\nTo prepare for the role of a late-night host, Fallon toured college campuses and comedy clubs for eight months, where he tested out a new 50-minute routine.[41] He also began watching the comedy of Chevy Chase, Dick Cavett, and Johnny Carson, as well as The Larry Sanders Show.[9] In May 2008, Fallon was announced as the successor to O'Brien's Late Night.[42][43][44]\n\nFallon was considered an odd choice for the job, both by executives at NBC (who \"hated\" the idea and predicted it to be a failure) and among the general public. This was alluded to in an early promo for the series: \"You loved him on SNL! You hated him in the movies! Now you're ambivalent.\"[31][45]\n\nBack to television and Late Night (2009‚Äì2013)\n\nLate Night with Jimmy Fallon premiered in March 2009 to mixed reviews. Producer Michael Shoemaker felt that the show's style solidified when it used Susan Boyle as a joke. While other late-night programs had centered on her appearance, Fallon's Late Night debuted a sketch in which Boyle's emotional performances could \"salve any affliction.\"[45] It was this style of humor, that Adam Sternbergh of New York dubbed \"the comedy of unabashed celebration,\" that led to the program's success.[45]\n\nFallon proved himself different from other late-night hosts, with more of a reliance on music, dancing, impersonations, and games.[9] Between his own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band, hip-hop collective The Roots, Fallon's incarnation of Late Night \"evolved into the most deeply musical of TV's musical-comedy variety programs,\" with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online.\n\nFallon's show found its footing in 2010, during The Tonight Show debacle.[8] The program embraced social media and the Internet, and online interaction and its presence on the show became crucial to its success.[46] In 2010, the show scored its first viral clip: Fallon and Timberlake performing a \"History of Rap.\"[45]\n\nFallon also hosted the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2010.[47][48] In 2012, Fallon released his second comedy album, Blow Your Pants Off, which compiles many of his musical performances on Late Night.[49] The album won a Grammy in 2013 for Best Comedy Album.[50] Discussions for Fallon to take over The Tonight Show began in early 2013.[51]\n\nAs of August 2013 , Fallon was earning a salary of $11 million a year for his work on Late Night.[52]\n\nThe Tonight Show (2014‚Äìpresent)\n\nOn April 3, 2013, following a period of speculation, NBC announced that Fallon would succeed Jay Leno, following the 2014 Winter Olympics, to become the sixth permanent host of The Tonight Show.[53][54] Fallon and Leno sang a parody of the song \"Tonight\" about The Tonight Show together. Fallon's Tonight Show debut on February 17, 2014, on NBC's network engaged 11.3 million viewers.[55]\n\nFallon's third book, Your Baby's First Word Will Be Dada, a children's book, was released in June 2015.[56][57]\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Fallon hosted Donald Trump on The Tonight Show during the United States presidential election.[58][59] Following the appearance, Fallon was criticized by some media critics and viewers on social media for the uncontroversial questions he asked of Trump.[60][61] David Sims, writing in The Atlantic, called the interview an \"embarrassment.\"[58] In response to the criticism, Fallon said to TMZ: \"Have you seen my show? I'm never too hard on anyone. We'll have Hillary [Clinton] on tomorrow, and we'll do something fun with her too.\"[62] Fallon apologized in March 2017 for the interview, saying \"I didn't do it to humanize him. I almost did it to minimize him. I didn't think that would be a compliment ... After this happened, I was devastated. I didn't mean anything by it. I was just trying to have fun.\"[63] He again apologized for the interview in June 2018 on a podcast with The Hollywood Reporter, saying that he \"made a mistake\" and added \"I did not do it to 'normalize' him or to say I believe in his political beliefs or any of that stuff.\"[64]\n\nIn 2020, Fallon and pacifier company WubbaNub created limited-edition pacifiers based on the penguin and cow characters from his children's books.[65][66]\n\nIn January 2022, Fallon was criticized for discussing NFTs (and promoting one of his own) on his show during an interview with Paris Hilton, which may have breached conflict-of-interest policies set by NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast; his own NFT was deduced to have most likely been purchased in November 2021 for about $216,000, and his promotion of it on the show could have boosted its asking price.[67] NBC responded to the criticism by stating that it did not believe Fallon had broken its conflict-of-interest rules.[68]\n\nOn November 16, 2022, a Twitter hoax spread with the hashtag #RIPJimmyFallon, which started trending nationwide. Fallon asked Twitter owner Elon Musk for help, who joked \"Say something that only the real Jimmy would say...\" On his show the following day, Fallon made fun of the rumors in a skit described by Vulture as \"tent revival-esque.\"[69]\n\nOn August 30, 2023, Fallon began hosting the comedy podcast Strike Force Five with Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Jimmy Kimmel, and John Oliver to support their staff members out of work due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.[70][71][72]\n\nIn September 2023, Rolling Stone published an article about Fallon and The Tonight Show workplace culture titled \"Chaos, Comedy, and 'Crying Rooms': Inside Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show'\", based on interviews with 16 former and then-active employees. It alleged that Fallon mistreated his staff, acted erratically, was prone to outbursts, and contributed to a toxic workplace culture. According to former employees, Fallon's behavior on a given day seemed to be related to whether he was allegedly hungover from the previous night. The abuse led to many employees referring to the special guests' dressing rooms as the crying rooms because that is where the employees would go to let out their emotions. NBC released a statement, defending the program, but they did not address the allegations against Fallon.[73] The day of the article's publication, he apologized to his staff on a Zoom call, saying: \"It's embarrassing and I feel so bad. Sorry if I embarrassed you and your family and friends.\"[74]\n\nInfluences\n\nFallon told David Steinberg on the Showtime series Inside Comedy that as a child he and his sister would imitate Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd's \"Wild and Crazy Guys\" routines from Saturday Night Live, and that he listened to comedy records, learning to imitate Rodney Dangerfield from them.[75] In 2009 he spoke on the influence of Monty Python when he appeared in the television documentary, Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut).[76]\n\nPersonal life\n\nFallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen on December 22, 2007.[77] They initially met on the set of Saturday Night Live,[78] but they did not become friends until later on the set of Fever Pitch. Fallon proposed in August 2007 with a Neil Lane‚Äìdesigned engagement ring on the dock of Juvonen's family home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. They were married four months later. Their daughters were born via surrogate in 2013 and 2014.[79][80][81][82] They live in Sagaponack, New York,[83] previously living in Gramercy Park, Manhattan,[84] they also have a female English cream Golden Retriever named Gary Frick that has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.[85][86][87]\n\nOn November 4, 2017, Fallon's mother Gloria died from undisclosed causes at the age of 68 at NYU Langone Medical Center.[88] Scheduled tapings of the following week's Tonight Show episodes were canceled.[89] One week later, Fallon paid tribute to his mother following that night's monologue, becoming emotional and calling her \"the best audience\".[90]\n\nFallon was raised Roman Catholic. In a 2011 interview with NPR, he expressed his fondness for the Latin Mass, but he stated he was no longer a regular churchgoer.[91][92][93]\n\nHealth problems\n\nOn June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion injury when he tripped over a rug in his home and tried to break his fall by holding onto a countertop, causing his finger to nearly get torn off by his wedding ring. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. He spent 10 days in the ICU before going home. He discussed this on the July 13 episode of The Tonight Show and thanked the doctors and nurses who helped him. A month later, he was still expecting to spend another eight weeks without any feeling in his finger.[94] In an interview with Billboard magazine in September 2015, he explained that his finger still had limited mobility and that another surgery would be required.[95] He reiterated this point at the 67th Emmy Awards on September 20, 2015, when he appeared in public without his finger bandaged for the first time since the accident.[96]\n\nOn January 4, 2022, Fallon announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 over the holiday season. He thanked medical professionals and credited the COVID-19 vaccine with making him \"lucky enough to only have mild symptoms\".[97]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2000 Almost Famous Dennis Hope 2002 The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch Reporter 2003 Anything Else Bob 2003 The Scheme Ray Filmed in 1998 2004 Taxi Det.
