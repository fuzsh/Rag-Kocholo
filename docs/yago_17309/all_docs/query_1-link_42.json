        "text": "The host of the “Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” has been spending a lot of time with his wife Nancy Juvonen while social distancing and hosting his talk show from his home. But who is Fallon’s wife? He and Juvonen have a famous mutual friend to thank for their introduction.\n\nSome may be surprised to learn Drew Barrymore plays a large part in the romance of Fallon and Juvonen. It all started back before Fallon had his own show when he was a cast member on “Saturday Night Live,” and Juvonen walked onto the set of the show to support her friend and producing partner Drew Barrymore who was hosting one evening, People reported.\n\n“She and Jimmy were practicing a sketch,” Juvonen said. “I kind of crept in quietly, and all of a sudden Jimmy goes, ‘Hey, Nancy! You’re Nancy? Hi, it’s so nice to meet you, welcome!' And I felt just so embraced and cool, like, ‘Thank you! Thank you for welcoming me in. This is so nice, it’s so intimidating [here].’”\n\nJuvonen and Barrymore co-founded Flower Films production company together in 1995, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The company produced many of Barrymore’s popular movies like “Charlie’s Angels,” “Never Been Kissed” and “50 First Dates.”\n\nThey also produced “Fever Pitch” in 2005, which was responsible for rekindling the already budding romantic relationship between Fallon and Juvonen. Juvonen remembers wondering at the movie’s filming conclusion whether it was “just a cute little flirt” or if she and Fallon might pursue a romantic relationship.\n\n“I’m like, ‘He’s probably dating like 30 women,’ I don’t know,” she joked to her husband. “I know now how funny that is, but at the time I didn’t know.”"
