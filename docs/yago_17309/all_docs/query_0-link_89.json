        "text": "Lydia Harvey, Times Staff Writer\n\nWednesday, December 3, 2014 10:40pm\n\nWhâ€¦ what? We officially have to crown Jimmy Fallon as King of Secrets Week.\n\nFirst, we found out Scarlett Johansson secretly got married. Then we learned Rosario Dawson adopted a 12-year-old a couple months ago. Now this: Fallon has welcomed his second child in 16 months.\n\nSurprise!\n\nThe 40-year-old Tonight Show host announced the birth of his daughter with wife Nancy Juvonen on Wednesday via his rep.\n\n\"Frances Cole Fallon officially entered the world at 8:45 a.m. on Dec. 3, weighing 5 lbs., 11 oz. and is 18.5 inches long,\" the statement said. \"Their new addition joins big sister, Winnie Rose, [16 months]. The couple opted to keep their baby joy to themselves until their new daughter made her official debut. Both Fallon babies were born via surrogate.\"\n\nThe Tonight Show will take a break for a couple of days to accommodate the new dad.\n\n\"Due to unexpected but delightful circumstances,\" NBC announced, \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon has had to cancel tapings for today and tomorrow.\"\n\nFallon, who recently wrote his first baby book, has had quite a year.\n\n\"This has been the craziest year of my life,\" Fallon told People magazine in June. \"But being a father is the most exciting, amazing thing that ever happened to me. And everything's going well on the show. My life has never been this cool.\"\n\nFallon is also on the cover of this week's Entertainment Weekly as the mag's 2014 Entertainer of the Year, so envy him. Envy him now."
