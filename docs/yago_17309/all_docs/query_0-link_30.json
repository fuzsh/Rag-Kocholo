        "text": "Jimmy Fallon may seem like a happy-go-lucky single guy on The Tonight Show, but he has been wed to wife Nancy Juvonen since 2007. As their marriage is in crisis following a series of setbacks, she’s still a powerful career woman and loving mom, and fans want to know more about her.\n\nWhat Does Nancy Juvonen Do for a Living?\n\nDo Nancy Juvonen and Jimmy Fallon Have Children?\n\nThe couple share two daughters. They welcomed daughter Winnie Rose via surrogate in 2013 and the following year again used a gestational carrier to add second child Francis “Franny” Cole to their family.\n\nThe same year Franny was born, Jimmy took over hosting The Tonight Show. “This has been the craziest year of my life,” Jimmy told People at the time. “But being a father is the most exciting, amazing thing that ever happened to me. And everything’s going well on the show. My life has never been this cool.”\n\nJimmy credited Nancy for him being able to keep The Tonight Show going during the COVID-19 pandemic while being a supermom to their girls.\n\n“My wife is the brains behind this whole thing,” he told People in May 2020. “She’s the production scout, the producer, the lighting person, the editor, the director. I could not do any of this without my wife. She is everything.” Nancy also coordinated their kids’ schooling and helped them with art projects and other activities to occupy their time while making sure her husband’s show stayed on the air.\n\nWhat Is the Status of Nancy Juvonen and Jimmy Fallon’s Marriage?\n\nThe couple’s “marriage is in crisis” as the pair are dealing with a myriad of issues, sources told In Touch exclusively on October 20.\n\n“Jimmy and Nancy have always had a contentious relationship, but it’s been particularly bad recently,” an insider exclusively revealed. “Especially during the writers’ strike they were fighting a lot, arguing over money, living arrangements and his drinking. She’s very, very controlling and it’s taking a toll.”\n\nJimmy moved from New York City to Mill Neck on Long Island with no “clear reason why,” a second insider explained. ​“Nancy and the kids spend summers and a lot of weekends at Sagaponack.” The source detailed how the late night personality liked to hit up local hotspots and was “always drinking and rowdy” when he hung out with the locals in town. “He would jump on stage and sing, take pics, he was not subtle,” the ​second source added.\n\n“Nancy has let him get away with murder in the past,” the insider added. “She partied hard with him back in the day. And he always had a lot of freedom. But this is different, they’re never together.”"
