        "text": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FARmeIXWrDY\n\nJimmy Fallon has been filming “The Tonight Show” from the safety of his own home, welcoming guests like Joe Biden and Demi Lovato via satellite. But he did manage to have one in-person guest on Tuesday’s show: Nancy Juvonen, his wife.\n\nFallon and Juvonen, a film producer, took a walk through their Hamptons neighborhood and discussed the origins of their relationship, which blossomed during the months they spent working on the 2005 film “Fever Pitch” in Boston.\n\nFallon described a gray, rainy day on set in Boston that was brightened when Juvonen, who runs a production company with “Fever Pitch” co-star Drew Barrymore, arrived, providing a splash of color.\n\n“You had white pants, a pink sweater, and a green backpack… and blonde hair and your white teeth,” Fallon said. “You just stood out in this gray. It was almost like a painting.”\n\nJuvonen, in turn, recalled a day when “Fever Pitch” producer Bradley Thomas brought his kids to set that made her fall for Fallon.\n\n“I played with Lucy and Jimmy played with Charlie — really played, really into it, as if they’d come to visit us,” Juvonen said. “So, I think that’s when my heart just sort of melted even more.”\n\nJuvonen described the “Fever Pitch” set as being similar to summer camp, with the pair, who got married in 2007, getting a chance to experience adolescent crushes as adults.\n\n“We got to flirt and hang out and get to know each other without having to go on a date or anything like that,” Juvonen said. “For months we got to just be pals and have crushes, which is so hard and so fun. It shouldn’t just be limited to high school.”"
