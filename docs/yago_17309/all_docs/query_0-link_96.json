        "text": "How they met:\n\nJimmy and Nancy met on the set of “Fever Pitch,” which he starred in and she co-produced. Mutual pal Drew Barrymore set the two up in May 2007, after inviting both to the birthday party she threw for Nancy.\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe proposal took place in New Hampshire on August 15, 2007 “on the dock at sunset at the Junoven’s family home in Wolfeboro on Lake Winnipesaukee, where On Golden Pond was filmed,” a friend of the couple told People magazine. “He presented her with a one-of-a-kind ring designed by Neil Lane.”\n\nOn the proposal:\n\n“It was serious,” Fallon said. “I did the one knee thing. I tried not to cry before she did. I was definitely breaking down a little bit. I don’t even remember what I said.”\n\n“I’m just really excited right now and just happy. I’m the luckiest guy on earth. She’s the coolest girl in the world.”\n\nOn wedding planning:\n\n“Oh, I have to be [involved],” he says. “We’re trying to get a guest list together. But it’s all fun stuff. She’s a cool girl and it’s no stress at all.”\n\nOn setting a wedding date:\n\n“We’re still planning it,” he says. But “the sooner the better for me. I’m in love.”\n\nThe Wedding:\n\nJimmy Fallon & Nancy Juvonen were married on December 22, 2007 in the British Virgin Islands on Richard Branson’s Necker Island.\n\nWhat HE says about HER:\n\n“We both took each other’s name, and I’m proud to say that my new name, now and forever, will be Mr. Jancy Falvonen.”\n\n“I’m still getting used to the [wedding] ring. I haven’t worn jewelry since my embarrassing Mr. T phase in seventh grade.”\n\n“It’s phenomenal. I love it. I love being married. She’s the coolest. I really lucked out.”\n\n“It was awesome. I got to meet a beautiful girl. I got to date her, and I got to get married.”\n\n“Thank God she loves the sense of humor. I’m not good in the looks department.”"
