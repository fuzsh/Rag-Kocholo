        "text": "It is common for many people today to work and train himself or herself in different fields. For all those who have been watching television for decades, they are well aware of this man named Jimmy Fallon. It doesn’t matter if someone is a kid or an adult, everyone knows about him considering that his flawless work as a host is popular among the public.\n\nWhile he is flawless as an actor and singer, he is also a good husband. This has been proved due to the bond that he has shared with his better half, Nancy Juvonen, since 2007. Juvonen is active in the same field where she works as a producer.\n\nJimmy Fallon’s love story with Nancy dates back to 2004\n\nThings started almost 20 years ago when Nancy was a visitor on Saturday Night Live. The meeting happened to be the best moment for the duo as they got to know each other and Jimmy secretly popped up in front of Nancy. However, Juvonen did not react aggressively and was instead happy to see him.\n\nThey met for another time on a show named Fever Pitch which managed to strengthen the bond a little bit more. It even marked a collaboration between the duo and Nancy recalled in an interview that her husband was in love with music at the time.\n\nWhile speaking on The Tonight Show, Nancy said that she soon started to develop feelings for Jimmy. This happened when the children of Bradley Thomas came on set and she saw Jimmy playing with them.\n\nJimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen’s engagement and marriage were organized in the same year\n\nUsually, people wait for some time to prepare perfectly for the marriage. But Jimmy and Nancy were not willing to do the same considering that they were too successful enough to plan the best for the wedding ceremony. There was a gap of only five months between both events.\n\nTalking about the duo’s wedding, it must be noted that it was luxurious, and all the arrangements were done on the private island of billionaire Richard Branson, named Necker Island. But after this, they decided to take a long break before expanding the family.\n\nThey had a daughter through surrogacy in 2013 along with another child the following year and using the same process. Apart from all these, Fallon sometimes takes the opportunity to praise his better half for being by his side over the years.\n\nNancy Juvonen created a lot of films since the 90s\n\nThe Connecticut, U.S. native enrolled at the University of Southern California for her higher studies. She was born to William H. Juvonen, who was a former student of Stanford University and served as a Marine Aviator in the past.\n\nBefore her career as a producer, Nancy was employed at various other jobs and was also a flight attendant at one point. She soon formed a company called Flower Films after joining Drew Barrymore. Her first film was Never Been Kissed, which turned out to be successful and this was followed by many other projects."
