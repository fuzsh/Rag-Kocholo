        "text": "The Washington Wizards will reward free agent forward Martell Webster for his stellar play last season with a four-year, $22 million contract. Webster is very pleased with the deal, it appears. Per the WaPo: “When the season ended, Webster didn’t hide his desire to return, believing that he had found, in his eighth season, a good fit with the Wizards. The Wizards also wanted him back, as president Ernie Grunfeld, owner Ted Leonsis and even John Wall all spoke of the need to make sure that he didn’t get away in free agency. With the full mid-level exception at its disposal, Washington used the entire amount to get Webster to agree to terms on a four-year deal worth $22 million, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. ‘It’s very reassuring. I’m secure. My family is happy about the situation. They love the city. So glad to be here,’ Webster said in a telephone interview shortly after reaching the agreement. Webster cannot sign the deal – which is only partially-guaranteed for the fourth year – until July 10, when the NBA moratorium on signings and trades comes to an end. But he anxious to build upon a career year in which he averaged career-highs of 11.4 points, 3.9 rebounds and shot 42.2 percent from beyond the three-point line, which ranked 12th in the NBA. Webster notched career-highs of 34 points and seven made three-pointers in a March 16 win over Phoenix and served as vocal locker room presence, keeping his teammates loose through some early struggles with his playful banter. He also suited up for 76 games, including 62 starts, which was a significant accomplishment after enduring two injury-plagued seasons in Minnesota, where he never played more than 47 games in either campaign because of two back operations that had him contemplating retirement.”"
