        "text": "Today's meeting with doctors and the Wovles medical staff has cleared Martell Webster to return to game action.\n\nNow the big question is:\n\nWhen?\n\nWednesday night against Oklahoma City?\n\nFriday against Detroit or Saturday at Chicago?\n\nThe team says no return date has been set yet. The Wolves didn't practice today so there was no chance to ask Kurt Rambis.\n\nWe'll know more tomorrow.\n\nAlso, Darko Milicic is listed as day to day with that quad contusion he got last night.\n\nBy the way he grimaced and walked after the game in New York, I'd be surprised if he plays tomorrow, but again, tomorrow morning's shootaround should bring more clarity."
