        "text": "TUALATIN -- Martell Webster struts onto the Trail Blazers' practice court for a workout and stops in his tracks when he spots someone dribbling a basketball.\n\n\"Let me see your jumper,\" Webster says with great skepticism, before watching the person brick a baseline shot. \"Man, that's ugly.\"\n\nMoments later, Webster scoops up the ball and fires his own shot, which is anything but ugly. Swish. Someone passes the ball back to Webster and he shoots again. Swish.\n\nAlthough he's missed all but five minutes this season because of an injured left foot, one thing is clear: Webster's still got it.\n\nDuring the next hour, with his teammates thousands of miles away on a five-game trip, the fourth-year NBA player provides a subtle glimpse at what the Blazers have missed this season in his absence. That picture-perfect jumper, superb athleticism and budding potential are all revealed as he hoists hundreds of shots and pushes himself in the latest phase of his rehabilitation.\n\nTeam doctors examined Webster's surgically repaired foot last week and reported that it continues to heal nicely. He has not yet been cleared for high-impact activity, but he continues to lift weights, do cardiovascular work that doesn't involve running and shoot.\n\nWebster says he will return in April, and while he refuses to give more specifics -- April 1, April 15? -- he doesn't have to. While the team has said Webster will not return for the regular season, it's clear he has different plans.\n\n\"I haven't given up hope on myself; I know there's still a chance I can come back,\" Webster said. \"The year's not over. I can still show some spark. I can show everybody what would have been going on the whole year if I had played.\"\n\nHis return would be the culmination of patience-testing months of tedious, behind-the-scenes workouts and could provide the Blazers with a late-season spark as they attempt to reach the postseason for the first time since 2003.\n\nWebster's season came to an abrupt halt after the Blazers' first exhibition game on Oct.7, when he suffered a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal on his left foot. He had surgery to insert screws and did not play again until Dec.7, when, after logging just five minutes, he suffered another stress fracture in the same spot. He hasn't played since.\n\nWebster wore a protective boot until March3, when he was cleared to resume low-impact activities. During his workout last week, Webster could not say for sure when he would return to practice, let alone when he would be cleared to run. But during the shooting portion of his workout -- which followed an hour's worth of lifting weights -- Webster appeared game-ready.\n\nWhen he worked on dribble moves, he shifted the ball effortlessly between his legs as he repeatedly and forcefully alternated them forward and backward -- something he couldn't do a few weeks ago. His body, which he says weighs 236 pounds, or roughly 10 pounds over his playing weight, looks to be in midseason shape. And every now and again, when Webster would wander toward the basket, he elevated high for a layup and landed pain-free.\n\nThere have been countless frustrations over the past few months, but Webster, who refuses to focus on the negatives and what-ifs of his season, said he never lost hope that this moment would come.\n\nThis month, his fiancee, Courtney Clarke, gave birth to his second daughter, Nylah Grace.\n\nHe says the pregnancy and birth were a nice distraction and reminder about what is important in life.\n\nAnd even during the down times, Webster would simply utter a phrase that was embedded into his \"membrane\" at an early age by his great aunt, Beulah Walker, the woman who raised him and whom he calls his grandmother: \"Everything's gonna be all right.\"\n\n\"That's what my grandma always says,\" Webster said. \"So I know everything's gonna be all right if she says so. It's that simple. It's what I live by. And it hasn't failed me yet.\"\n\nTeammates say Webster has been as positive and upbeat as at any point during his career. But those who know him the best acknowledge this season has been rocky.\n\n\"He's struggling,\" said Blazers assistant coach Monty Williams. \"Any guy who's been out for a year is struggling. He may have a different way of outwardly expressing it, but he's still struggling just like most guys would. He's not playing, he's been unhappy, but the one thing I've seen from him is he's always on that bench cheering for guys. He's never negative, and that's just a sign of his character and the kind of guy he is.\"\n\nUnlike some players who are sidelined for most of the season, Webster has stayed close to his team through his rehab. He participates in most meetings and film review sessions, has attended most practices and shootarounds, and regularly watches film on his own.\n\nWhen he was forced to wear a protective boot, Webster often was spotted at the practice facility launching free throws and midrange shots while sitting in a chair.\n\nNow that he appears to be poised for a return, the question begs: What kind of impact can he make?\n\nWebster stared 70 games last season, when he averaged a career-high 10.7 points and led the Blazers with 123 three-pointers. He signed a four-year, $20 million extension in October that could keep him in Portland through the 2012-13 season, and he entered camp as the leading contender to start at small forward.\n\n\"He was my pick to kind of have a breakout year,\" Williams said.\n\nBut the Blazers have long since moved on from depending on Webster. Rookie Nicolas Batum has started 65 games at small forward and continues to exceed expectations. Veteran Travis Outlaw has regained his reputation as one of the NBA's most dependable sixth men. With 12 games remaining, the Blazers' player rotation is set and the team's rhythm is fluid as they fight for a playoff seeding.\n\nOne school of thought is that Webster, even with all his ability, could throw a late-season wrench into the team's postseason plans. As Webster puts it, he could come in \"and mess it up.\" But the Blazers aren't worried.\n\n\"Martell's a type of guy who doesn't come in and demand shots,\" All-Star guard Brandon Roy said. \"I think the biggest thing is getting his legs and understanding he's coming into a tight situation. But Martell won't mess up anything. We can just fit him right in because of his style of play. I don't worry about Martell coming in at all.\"\n\nAdded Blazers coach Nate McMillan: \"I would love to have him back. Just having him adds to the team, adds to the depth of the team, and could give us some freshness that could provide some good energy.\"\n\nWebster said he will fill whatever role McMillan asks of him, promising to be content regardless of how much playing time he gets. After a trying season of watching, simply being a part of the team is enough.\n\n\"It's going to be an overwhelming accomplishment knowing that I've been told to my face that I will be out the rest of the season and I didn't let that get the best of me,\" Webster said. \"I'm not going to lie and say the whole time I was Chipper Young Kipper. There were times when I felt a little discouraged. That (stuff) is hard man. I'm not going to lie. But I didn't let it get the best of me.\""
