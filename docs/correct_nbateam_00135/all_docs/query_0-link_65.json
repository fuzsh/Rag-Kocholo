He has played for the Portland Trail Blazers and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\n---Veteran forward/center Sean Williams was waived by the Houston Rockets on Wednesday, general manager Daryl Morey announced.\n\nWilliams, 25, was acquired from the Boston Celtics as part of the Courtney Lee sign-and-trade on July 20. He has averaged 4.2 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 137 career games with the New Jersey Nets, Dallas Mavericks and Boston."
