        "text": "I first want to preface this post with the premise that about a month ago, I asked for the Blazers or Nuggets as good match ups for a Suns playoff series. Many of the BSOTS brethren respectively disagreed and instead went with OKC or Dallas as preferable substitutes for Portland. At face value, Portland is the type of team that Phoenix should not want to face, especially in the tightened pace of the playoffs. The margin for errors simply isn't there against this sort of team. While the Suns are clearly a more talented team, Portland operates on a more deliberate and disciplined stype of execution.\n\nThe good news is that the Suns have been playing some great ball as of late and while we all know that Portland has suffered some injuries (Part of NBA life...), there are still some pitfalls that Alvin Gentry and need to plan for in a series with the Blazers.\n\nThe first pitfall has already arisen in the form of a bulging disk for Robin Lopez. Having a healthy Rolo would probably put this series in the \"unwinnable\" category for the Blazers, but his loss has been mitigated somewhat by the improved play of Channing Frye off the bench and Jarron Collins doing what he does in the paint (I am still not sure what that is...). Having Lou come off the bench with instant energy and having A play like a rampaging Sasquatch doesn't hurt either.\n\nMy assessment is that LaMarcus Aldridge and Marcus Camby while capable players, are not bruising post players like Carlos Boozer. Bottom line, they will do some good work in the paint, especially on the boards, but by-in large, Collins & Co will play these guys to a standstill. If Amare can get Camby in foul trouble consistently, this series will be over faster than Derrick Rose crossover. Overall, I rate Rolo's absence as a fairly mitagable issue...for now. We probably will lose the rebounding battle, but I think our offensive efficiency with Frye dropping threes is more than good enough to compensate.\n\nAnother pitfall can easily come upon us is foul trouble. We know Collins collects them like books, and Lou Amundsen racks them up fairly quick as well. The problem arises if Amare gets a couple of quick ones early, it changes the complexion of the way the Suns run out and operate in the the pick and roll. Without the threat of Robin or Amare on the pick and roll, or even the occasion Grant Hill/Jason Richardson drive, teams can play the Suns for the perimeter jumper. I am not particularly worried about this scenario because Amare generally understands his importance to the team and always elevates his already beastly game to a new level in the playoffs. The key is to guard LMA well but not to commit silly fouls on him in the process. I rate this as an fair to easily mitagable issue, especially since the Suns are used to Collins picking up two fouls in the first three minutes of the game...\n\nThat brings us to the foremost pitfall that can arise; the physical breakdown of our two elder statesmen. We'll start with Grant - he has been a godsend this year, playing more games than he has since the 1999/2000 season. It is hard to believe how much the Suns rely on the 37 year old geezer for defensive intensity, ball handling, rebounding helpo and overall leadership. It simply amazing to watch Grant clamp down with a defensive assignment on a stud like Carmelo Anthony or to dunk on a unsuspecting young fella. If he goes down for any reason, Gentry has a difficult decision...Should he start Jared Dudley or go small and slide JRich over to the three? Somebody would have to guard Martell Webster or Nicolas Batum. Anyway you look at it, it disrupts the substitution patterns and dramatically affects how the Suns rebound, and operate on the second unit (which is a strength). I rate this a a moderate problem on the mitigation scale.\n\nAs problematic as having Grant Hill go down, having Steve Nash go down for any prolonged length of time is incrementally worse. Simply put, Nash makes the Suns go...without him, it's like tossing some sludge laden kerosene into your gas tank...it ain't gonna work for too long. Compounding the issue is that the Suns only have one legitimate point guard back-up in the form of Goran Dragic. While Goran has made tremendous strides this year, he doesn't have the savvy, will, or play-off experience that safely entrust this team into his hands should Nash go down. Grant Hill could provide some help, but it would not be the same as having a two time MVP orchestrating the offense. Portland would enjoy a serious advantage at point guard with Andre Miller if this happens. I rate losing Nash as a serious problem that the Suns probably could not mitigate.\n\nThere we have it...I know there are a lot of other scenarios that I could have addressed, but I felt these were the most likely or ones that could raise the most problems...Let me know what you think."
