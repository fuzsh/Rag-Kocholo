        "text": "The Match-Ups:\n\nPoint Guard\n\nBrooks - He is playing really well since Rafer has left, improving on his first game performance. Steve Blake can't keep up with him but Jerryd Bayless can.\n\nvs.\n\nBlake - One of my favorite \"average\" point guards. He's one of the guys, along with Lowry and Hinrich that Dave and I have plead for the Rockets to find a way to get. He's a great fit for the Blazers as well, a very good calming source for the team.\n\nEdge: Even based on the speed of Blake and the inexperience of the other three\n\nShooting Guard\n\nBattier - He'll have his work cut out for him tonight playing a top 2-3 SG in the NBA. Shane can definitely frustrate Roy, but Brandon is the type of player that can overcome great defense. This is going to be the match-up of the night\n\nvs.\n\nRoy - He of the last second three point shot from early this season, robbing Yao Ming of his own basketball heroics. It's no secret that I love this guy, he's everything that is right about the NBA, kind of like Chris Paul. It still makes me sad that the Rockets missed out on him.\n\nEdge: Blazers\n\nSmall Forward\n\nArtest - FINALLY, the Ron has come back to destroy the league. Cannnnn you smellllllll what the RONNNNNNN is cooking.\n\nThe contract year play has begun\n\nvs.\n\nBatum - Frenchy that isn't named Tony Parker, enough said\n\nEdge: Rockets\n\nPower Forward\n\nScola - Quitely dominating opponents\n\nvs.\n\nAldridge - I can't be rationale as I'm a Longhorn and LA fan\n\nEdge: Even - Aldridge has the talent edge by a good margin, but Scola will out hustle him all night. This match-up could go either way, with Scola capable of shutting Aldridge down and Aldridge capable of going off. LaMarcus' lack of consistency and Scola's complete consistency make this even\n\nCenter\n\nYao - Getting his shots, making his shots, leading this team to victory\n\nvs.\n\nPryzbilla - Infinitely better than I expected him to be,but not in Yao's class\n\nEdge: Rockets - This match-up should swing the game wildly in the Rockets favor\n\nInjuries\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nOUT - Tracy McGrady, for the season it appears"
