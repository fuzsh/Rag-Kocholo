        "text": "Here is an analysis of the Blazers' roster, 1-15 (in no particular order). This team is, in my opinion, the deepest and most talented in the league and one of the deepest and most talented ever.\n\nThey have a superstar (Roy), a good second option (Aldridge), good young players that still have plenty of potential (Batum, Oden, Fernandez), veteran leaders (Miller, Howard, Udoka), strong sixth men (Outlaw, Webster), strong role players (Blake, Przybilla), and more young talents, who are still wildcards (Bayless, Cunningham, Pendergraph, Mills).\n\nThis team can be good this season, and into the future.\n\nBrandon Roy\n\nThe former Rookie of the Year and two-time All-Star has proven himself to be one of the premier players in the NBA. Barring injury, he should be a lock to make the All-Star team once again.\n\nBecause the Blazers will likely be in the top four teams in the West, Roy may even make the All-NBA first team. Roy has established himself as the third best shooting guard in the league.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge\n\nPower forward Aldridge has seen steady improvement. He’s quick and athletic, has a great mid-range jumper, and is a good offensive rebounder as well. I expect to see more improvement from him this year.\n\nLast year, he got off to a slow start and finished very strongly. If he can have a good start this year, he will likely make his first All-Star appearance. His inside game and defensive rebounding can use some work, but all around he is becoming one of the top power forwards, and a great complement to Roy.\n\nGreg Oden\n\nMany people have been quick to label Oden a “bust” or a “disappointment” because of his injuries and foul problems. I think that people are writing him off too quickly though.\n\nSure, he may not be the next Ewing, Olajuwon, or Robinson, but he can become one of the top centers in the conference. While the Blazers don’t need him to put up a lot of points, I think he will post solid numbers this season, averaging around 10.5/9/2 while shooting 55 percent or so from the field and be a difference maker on the defensive end.\n\nAndre Miller\n\nMiller was a good acquisition for the Blazers, better in my opinion, than Millsap or Turkoglu would have been. He provides veteran leadership to a young team and his playmaking skills should help take some of the pressure off of Roy.\n\nI am also looking forward to seeing him throw a few lobs to Oden, Outlaw, Aldridge, and Fernandez and using his inside game to draw defenders away from some of the three-point shooters on the squad.\n\nNot sure where he will end up, but I think he may be a better fit with the bench lineup than with the starters\n\nNicolas Batum\n\nBatum had a good rookie season that took many people by surprise, showing that he is a good perimeter defender, very athletic, an all around hustle player, and a decent three-point shooter when he is open.\n\nHe played well in the Eurobasket tourney this summer and looks to improve this year. His offense needs improving and he may want to get stronger to become an even better defender.\n\nSome have dared compare him to Scottie Pippen. I don’t see him becoming quite that good offensively, but I’d like to see him become the next Shane Battier someday.\n\nTravis Outlaw\n\nAfter having a disappointing playoff series against the Rockets last year, Outlaw will be looking to prove himself anew. While some may question his shot selection and interior game, nobody can question the fact that he is a great clutch player (having several game-winners both of the last two seasons).\n\nI expect him to have a decent season this year, though he will probably not get too much playing time. I’m hoping he re-signs with the team next year.\n\nSteve Blake\n\nBlake is a solid point guard with good passing and shooting skills. He is a good complement to Roy and other Blazers. He is a great role player.\n\nHis playing time will certainly fall after adding Miller, but I can guarantee he will be solid when he does play. He won't having huge scoring nights, but not making many mistakes either and helping the team in other ways besides just scoring.\n\nMartell Webster\n\nLast season, many people expected Webster to have a breakout year. That was before he got injured and missed all but five minutes of the season.\n\nWebster has since been working hard to recover and appears eager to play again. With his athleticism and sweet shooting, he will be a valuable part of the team. He could surprise some people with his play this year.\n\nRudy Fernandez\n\nFernandez is one of the most exciting players on the team and a fan favorite. His incredible passing, three-point shooting, and dunking were a boost to the Blazers off the bench last year, especially in the absence of Webster.\n\nHe may see less playing time this year with the return of Webster and the acquisition of Miller. The team, however, plans to put the ball in his hands more often, giving him the opportunity to be more of a playmaker and take advantage of his passing more.\n\nJoel Przybilla\n\nPrzybilla gives the Blazers a tough, hard-working, defensive big man to back up Oden (or maybe vice versa). “The Thrilla” provides defense, rebounding, and blocked shots and is, if he isn’t the starter, one of the best backup centers in the league, even if he doesn’t get much attention.\n\nJerryd Bayless\n\nBayless has shown promise occasionally, but has been inconsistent and not received enough regular playing time to be a big difference maker. And his playing time could take a hit this year with the acquisition of Miller.\n\nHe is not consistent or a good passer or shooter for a PG, but has shown that he is a hard worker, so he could improve and eventually start for the Blazers\n\nDante Cunningham\n\nThe rookie Cunningham was the surprise on the Blazer summer league this time, scoring about 18 PPG. He will not see much playing time this season in all likelihood, but he has a good mid-range shot and his explosive dunking could help make him a fan favorite this year and for years to come.\n\nJeff Pendergraph\n\nThe other rookie, Pendergraph, was unfortunately injured and will miss the first part of the season. In summer league play, he demonstrated toughness, good defense, and hustle.\n\nJuwan Howard and Ime Udoka"
