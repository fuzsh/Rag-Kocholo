        "text": "When Paul Millsap missed a wide-open layup as the regulation buzzer sounded, it looked like the Wolves might actually steal this one from the Jazz. They had trailed Utah 92-80 with only 4 minutes to go before pulling off a miraculous comeback to force overtime. After a Pekovic basket tied the game with 0.7 seconds left, the Jazz ran a brilliant out of bounds play that nearly ended the Wolves hopes with a heroic shot. Instead, Paul’s heroics would come from steals in overtime (8 total for the game!) that sealed a win that Utah probably deserved all along.\n\nThings were actually looking good for the first part of overtime. Wes Johnson (after a HORRENDOUS first four quarters of action) hit a pair of jumpers and pulled down a tough rebound, and had the Wolves leading 105-103 with 1:31 to go. But, the next Wolves possessions were as follows:\n\n* With game tied, Luke Ridnour pass stolen by Paul Millsap.\n\n* With Wolves down by 2, Martell Webster misses wide-f***ing-open corner trey.\n\n* With Wolves down by 4, Paul Millsap steals ball from Kevin Love.\n\nEach blunder was followed by Jazz points. Each blunder was inexcusable. So it goes.\n\nA whole bunch of bullets:\n\n* Ridnour, that last turnover notwithstanding, made A LOT of nifty assists in this game. He seemed to look for Pekovic frequently and found him rolling or sealing at the right times. Luke finished the game with 13 assists.\n\n* Anthony Randolph Sighting! AR15 had 5 points and 3 steals in 12 minutes off the bench. He took the ball hard to the basket twice in the second half, each time not getting a call that could have been made. His biggest weakness right now is the rotation of big men that lie in front of him on the depth chart. All things considered, his play isn’t that bad. Those that incessantly rip on this guy are off base to some extent. Sure, his decision making will leave you shaking your head at times. But that happens with every player. Every other player doesn’t get you 17 & 8 per 36 on 50 percent shooting and hyperactive defense.\n\n* Speaking of AR15 getting minutes, Coach went 10 deep tonight despite Mike Beasley being out with a sore toe. This cut deep into D-Thrill’s minutes. The rook played 16 total, while Randolph and Tolliver each played 12.\n\n* This was Kevin Love’s best game of the year against Paul Millsap and the Jazz. But that isn’t necessary saying much. He took 23 shots to get his 25 points, numbers not befitting of his renowned efficiency. In three games versus Utah, he’s shooting just 29 percent from the field. Still, he did plenty of good things in this game (like pull down 16 rebounds) and can hardly be blamed for the result.\n\nI’ll wrap this up with a brief take on the trade deadline (in)activity. The rumor mill had me and everyone else convinced that Mike Beasley was headed to Tinseltown in a three-teamer that would bring back two-guard chucker, Jamal Crawford. Jamal has plenty in common with Beasley as a jumpshooting player. One notable difference is that while Beasley at times seems conflicted about gunning, Jamal is unapologetic and perhaps unaware. He just chucks. And chucks. Would he have helped this team? Maybe. Maybe not. I have no idea.\n\nBut the reason that the deal did not happen is that one version had Portland requiring Luke Ridnour to come their way. If you have watched Luke play this year, you realize that this would not be a good thing. The other version had us taking on Derek Fisher’s contract, adding over $3 million to next year’s payroll. No thanks. There are legitimately-good wing players available in this coming free agency. Ray Allen, Eric Gordon, O.J. Mayo, Nic Batum. I don’t know which the Wolves prefer most, but I have to believe they’ve got eyes on those guys and want as much dough as possible to toss their way. With Ricky out for this season, a rash decision to run at the 8-seed–particularly one that might not even be an upgrade over what Beasley provides–would have been a mistake. No trade was fine with me.\n\nSeason Record: 22-22\n\nThe early season narrative for the TWolves has been that Ricky Rubio and Kevin Love are amazing players who need some help. Other starting players, most notably Wesley Johnson and Darko Milicic, have failed to provide meaningful production or consistent play that breeds any confidence in the two stars’ supporting cast.\n\nMichael Beasley led last year’s team in scoring per minute (21.4 per 36; 19.2 per game) but didn’t make himself many fans after ankle sprains on each leg derailed what looked like a promising season. In 73 games, he surpassed 30 points 8 times, and 40 points once. But the way he scored those points, often isolation sets with some ball-stoppage, isn’t popular or always fun to watch. Also, and much more significantly if we’re being fair, his defense was often times lazy and always incoherent. A plausible retort to this would be that he was simply “joining the club” of Rambis-coached wings who had no idea how to rotate defensively. Beasley had serious flaws to be addressed if he were going to be an impact player on an up-and-coming team led by Rubio and Love.\n\nThis season, some fans and analysts expected a breakout year from Supercool Mike, both because of Rubio’s playmaking but more so because Rick Adelman would devise schemes to get him the ball closer to the hoop. A problem with the Rambis triangle was that it often resorted to clearing out for Mike 24 feet from the basket for everyone else to stand and watch. This wasn’t good for Mike’s efficiency or the Timberwolves win/loss record. In the early going this year, he showed flashes of improved play. His defense was been better. Night and day. He’s played respectable defense on LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and even Kobe Bryant. If you watched Wellington try to guard Kevin Martin (or if you remember the days of Shaddy McCants trying to defend Baron Davis or LBJ) you’ve seen an outmatched defender in a Wolves uniform. This is not Michael Beasley. If he’s focused and coached, he’s an adequate-or-better defensive wing. His shot was colder than we’ve ever seen it in the early going. He put together stinkers of 11-27, 2-6, 5-16, and 4-12 before spraining his foot and missing the next 11 games. It should be noted that the Wolves were probably playing their best basketball in that early going against a brutal schedule. They trounced the Spurs and Mavs (with Dirk, unlike the second time they beat them without Mike) and held late-game leads on title-favorites OKC and Miami. But Mike needed his shot to fall like it used to before things could really take off for he and the team.\n\nOf course, the schedule weakened right around the time of the injury and the team ripped off an 11-game stretch of over-.500 basketball, going 6-5. THEY’RE BETTER WITHOUT BEASLEY! LOOK AT THE BALL MOVEMENT! Only, if you watched the Toronto or Atlanta games, you saw what happened against a respectable foe when the game slowed down and shot creating became a necessity. The Wolves have exactly one shot creator on the team, and he was sidelined for those games. You might also look at those 6 wins and notice that they came against either garbage competition (Wizards, Hornets, Kings, Pistons) or good teams that were without future Hall of Famers (Clippers without Chris Paul, Mavericks without Dirk Nowitzki). The record was inflated by an easy schedule. Despite what some desperately wanted to believe, the team was NOT better without its best scorer.\n\nFast forward to tonight’s game at Houston. The Rockets (who recently spanked the Mike-less Wolves at Target Center) held a mighty 9-2 home record heading into this game. Minnesota had no rest, traveling overnight into Houston after a hard-fought loss against LA. Houston rested last night in their beds at home. This was not a game the Wolves should have won.\n\nOh, but they did win, and they pummeled the Rockets behind Mike Beasley’s 34 points on 14 shots. Mike had his jumper going, his dribble penetration game going, and he was getting to the line where he hit all 12 attempts. His monster scoring performance led the way in this one, increasing the lead throughout the second half. The Ricky & Love show became a Minnesota Big 3, as Rubio damn-near f’d around and got a triple double (18 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds) and Love added 29 & 7 of his own.\n\nIs Mike going to score like this every night? Of course not. But he will some nights, and on those nights Minnesota will be almost unbeatable. When he’s clanking shot after shot? Sit him down, or watch Kevin Love collect rebounds. Beasley draws extra defenders, a skill that doesn’t show up in a box score but is essential to consistently-successful offense in the NBA. He also complements the team’s best players by adding a skill that neither possesses: a dominant one-on-one game that will foul out opponents, allow teammates to get some rest on offense, and challenge opposing coaches into lineup decisions they might not prefer.\n\nI hope this isn’t a one-game fluke, and an amazing coach like Adelman can draw as much of Beasley’s natural talent as is possible. He’s a restricted free agent this off-season and the forward duo lauded by John Hollinger last year could be really something, especially with the Spanish floor general leading the way.\n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\n* Martell Webster’s feisty defense in the second quarter turned the game. He plays D on a slightly-different level than his teammates. Watch a Memphis Grizzlies game for comparable effort and approach. This is an asset, for sure, especially from a guy that the team can afford to get in foul trouble (because he will, if he plays this way). Webster should be the starting shooting guard very soon. Let’s all hope his back stays healthy. No more of these.\n\n* Derrick Williams is frozen out of the rotation. TRADE DERRICK WILLIAMS will become a common meme. That could be wise, depending on the deal, but let’s not lose sight of the talent here, and how similarly-awesome college players with talent took their licks en route to NBA improvement. James Harden and Evan Turner took time to adjust, as Williams will. Biggest reasons for NOT trading him: (1) He’s on the rookie scale; and (2) He’s insurance against Love getting injured or Love bolting after 3 years. If he continues to improve as a power forward, and he will, those are not insignificant factors. A shooting guard can be signed in free agency this off-season, if need be.\n\n* Kyle Lowry versus Ricky Rubio could be an All-Star debate in the next few years. Lowry bested him at Target Center, and Ricky took this match. Very different players. Very good players.\n\nSeason Record: 10-11\n\nThe Wolves eked out an 87-80 win Friday night over the Hornets. There were no two ways about this one: it was either going to be a much-needed win or a bad loss against an already sub-par Hornets team whose best player, Eric Gordon, was out with an injury.\n\nThe Wolves were shorthanded. J.J. Barea and Michael Beasley stayed in Minneapolis. Martell Webster won’t be available for a few weeks. Or a few months. Or maybe never. Any could be true. Martell might not even know. Adelman leaned heavily on Ridnour at the two (not ideal), Johnson at the three (bad), and Rubio at the point (good). Rubio started (good) and played 44 minutes (good). Johnson played 34 minutes and Tolliver and Williams only 16 apiece (bad)\n\nThe victory was ugly. No one could get shots. Rubio served them on a silver platter. Teammates sometimes converted, often didn’t. His 9 assists should’ve been closer to 20. Johnson shot 1-8 from distance. Darko couldn’t catch. The Wolves won’t win many playing like this.\n\nLove got to the line 18 times–the same number of attempts as the entire Nola squad. He made 17. His final line read 34 & 17. Yawn.\n\nLove’s production is appreciated, don’t get me wrong. But against the Hornets, his numb#rs were lower-quality than in his other big games earlier in the season. He looked tired. He wasn’t closing out on D. He won’t get 18 throws every game.\n\nAdelman needs to keep him fresh. Incorporating Williams and Tolliver and Randolph more would be a starting place. They play power forward too.\n\nThe takeaway is simple: no Rubio, no win. Love would’ve had about the same line with or without him. But no one else would’ve been able to get buckets. Like last season, after Beasley hurt his ankle. Adelman not only played Ricky a lot, he started him. That’s progress.\n\nLet’s hope he tries to build on that progress tonight in Atlanta. Take baby steps.\n\nDistributing Johnson’s minutes between Tolliver and Williams would be a start.\n\nOr get really wild and crazy. Give 12 or 13 of Darko’s minutes to Randolph. He’s way better.\n\nIt’s staggering how much better we are when Randolph and Tolliver are on the floor and how much worse we are when Darko and Johnson are on the floor.\n\nHit us up in the comments.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nSeason Record: 4-7"
