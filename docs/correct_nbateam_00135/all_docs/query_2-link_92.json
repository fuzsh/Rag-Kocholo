        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Stephen Curry scored 42 points and the depleted Golden State Warriors finished their season with a 122-116 victory over the playoff-bound Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night.\n\nThe short-handed Trail Blazers finished as the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference and will face the third-seeded Phoenix Suns when the first-round series kicks off on Sunday night.\n\nThe Suns defeated the Utah Jazz 100-86 in their regular-season finale. Portland is 2-1 against Phoenix this season.\n\n“I think we’ll match up against them well,” said Blazers rookie Jeff Pendergraph, who had a career-high 23 points. “Going into that series – almost any series – we’re going in as underdogs. I think that plays to our favor. We’ve been that the whole season so it’s really nothing new for us.”\n\nMonta Ellis finished with 34 for the Warriors, who were down to just five players because of injuries.\n\n“Bottom line is that we played a spectacular, a great performance from all five guys that could play,” Warriors coach Don Nelson said. “Like the guys said, they want the video. They thought it was the greatest game they ever played in, to do something like that. You know what? They might be right.”\n\nPortland was without forward LaMarcus Aldridge, who was hospitalized the night before with a gastrointestinal virus. It is not expected the virus will keep Aldridge out of the playoffs.\n\nPortland guard Brandon Roy, the team’s top scorer, missed his second game after doctors discovered he had a torn meniscus in his right knee.\n\nAlthough he will require surgery, Roy said he would try to play with the injury during the playoffs. Doctors have told him he cannot make the injury worse, but he didn’t know if pain would prevent him from being effective.\n\nRoy will likely be evaluated on Friday.\n\nThe Warriors head home after the game to a somewhat uncertain future.\n\nOwner Chris Cohan has formally put the franchise up for sale. Coach Don Nelson has said he plans to return next year, the final season on his contract, and general manager Larry Riley said that would be the case barring any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nNelson has said he is committed to developing this young team to pave the way for an easier transition for his successor.\n\nPortland, plagued by injuries this season, started a completely different lineup than it began the season with.\n\nGone are centers Greg Oden and Joel Przybilla, who both sustained injuries that required season-ending surgery. Forward Nicolas Batum missed the first half of the season after shoulder surgery, and swingman Rudy Fernandez had midseason back troubles.\n\nRoy missed more than a dozen games with a sore hamstring earlier this year, before the meniscus tear was discovered.\n\nIn all, 13 Blazers have missed a combined 311 games because of injuries, second only to the Warriors this season.\n\nPortland trailed much of the first quarter until Batum dunked to tie it at 33 going into the second quarter. Fernandez hit a 3-pointer to put Portland ahead 38-35.\n\nThe Warriors stayed in it, paced by Ellis’ 18 first-half points, to lead 60-58 at the break.\n\nFernandez hit a 3-pointer to put Portland up 78-73 in the third quarter, before Pedergraph’s dunk and Martell Webster’s 3-pointer made it 91-85 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nBut Curry’s 3-pointer put Golden State back in front at 98-96, and Ellis’ layup made it 108-104 with 5:34 left.\n\nWebster gave Portland back the lead with a layup and a free throw that made it 109-108 with 3:45 left.\n\nNelson argued at length with the officials after Devean George apparently fouled out – and the Warriors had no available healthy players. George was eventually allowed to return, but it cost the Warriors a technical.\n\nCurry came back with his 3-pointer that made it 113-110, and after Pendergraph scored for Portland, Curry’s baseline jumper made it 115-112 with 1:49 left.\n\nCurry added a pair of free throws with 1:07 to go and the Warriors led the rest of the way.\n\nNOTES: Portland players came down from the seats during introductions, part of fan appreciation night. The team wore their “Rip City” white uniforms. The term dates back to the early 1970s, when it became the trademark of broadcaster Bill Schonley. … Portland has won four straight against the Warriors at the Rose Garden. … Blazers center Marcus Camby was replaced by Dante Cunningham in the starting lineup just prior to tipoff."
