Drafted in the second round in 1984, Kersey quickly established himself as an aggressive rebounder and defender, often outworking opponents with his relentless hustle. His high-flying dunks and fearless shot-blocking ability earned him the nickname \"Mercy\" Kersey, as well as two trips to the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. Although never an All-Star, Kersey left an indelible mark on the franchise as a beloved fan favorite and key component of those perennial playoff teams.\n\nBirthplace : Wiesbaden, Germany\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks, Los Angeles Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: 1984–1989\n\nA prolific scorer with a silky-smooth jumper, Kiki Vandeweghe joined the Trail Blazers in 1984 through a trade. His offensive versatility and scoring ability made him an integral part of an up-and-coming Portland squad. An adept shooter from both mid-range and beyond the arc, Vandeweghe averaged over 20 points per game during his tenure in Portland. His impressive scoring efforts earned him back-to-back All-Star selections in 1986 and 1987, making him one of the most revered small forwards in Trail Blazers history.\n\nBirthplace : Hamburg, Arkansas\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Chicago Bulls, Portland Trail Blazers, Houston Rockets\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: 1999–2003\n\nOne of the greatest two-way players in NBA history, Scottie Pippen brought championship pedigree to Portland when he was traded to the Trail Blazers in 1999. Known for his defensive prowess, versatility, and unselfish play, Pippen was a critical piece in the team's deep playoff run in the 1999-2000 season. A six-time NBA champion and seven-time All-Star, Pippen provided veteran leadership and invaluable experience to the talented roster. Though his stint in Portland was brief compared to his illustrious career with the Chicago Bulls, Pippen's impact on the Trail Blazers' competitiveness remained undeniable.\n\nBirthplace : San Pedro, Los Angeles, California\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: 1975–1982\n\nAn unsung hero among Portland Trail Blazers legends, Bob Gross played an essential role in the team's lone championship season in 1977. Drafted in the second round in 1975, Gross quickly became known for his versatile, blue-collar play style that helped anchor the Blazers' defense. Capable of guarding multiple positions, Gross' tenacity and grit were instrumental during the team's title run. Although he never garnered individual accolades, his tireless work ethic and commitment to team success solidified Gross as a beloved figure in Portland basketball lore.\n\nBirthplace : Monroe, Louisiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: 1979–1984\n\nAn explosive leaper with a relentless motor, Calvin Natt joined the Trail Blazers in 1979 after being traded from the New Jersey Nets. Despite his modest 6'6\" frame, Natt was a tenacious rebounder and inside scorer, often outmuscling taller opponents in the paint. His hard-nosed play style and undeniable hustle endeared him to the Portland fanbase, earning him an All-Star selection in 1985. Natt's high-flying dunks and gritty play helped solidify the Blazers as a tough, competitive squad during his tenure.\n\nBirthplace : Lisieux, France\n\nNationality : France\n\nTeam : Los Angeles Clippers, Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trailblazers\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nPortland Trail Blazers: 2008–2015\n\nDrafted by the Trail Blazers in 2008, Nicolas Batum quickly established himself as a versatile wing capable of contributing in various aspects of the game. Known for his length and defensive instincts, Batum often guarded the opposing team's best scorer and excelled as a help defender. On the offensive end, his ability to stretch the floor and make timely cuts made him a valuable asset. Despite not earning major individual accolades, Batum's all-around game and selflessness made him an essential component of the Trail Blazers during his seven-year tenure."
