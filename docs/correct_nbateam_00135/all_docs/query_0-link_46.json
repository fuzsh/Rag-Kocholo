While the NBA star (formerly on the Washington Wizards and Portland Trail Blazers) is currently recovering from a hip injury and expected to return to the league in the fall, the Seattle native has kept busy with his own label EYRST (pronounced Air-st). Reared on rock, rap and R&B, Webster has been a music junkie since he was seven. He recorded his first raps alongside his close cousin Rodney on the Fisher Price cassette player/recorder with blue, red, green and white keys. \"We would dub over Nat King Cole cassette tapes and Rodney would use a butter knife and his fists for percussion,\" he recalls with a laugh."
