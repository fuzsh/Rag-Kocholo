        "text": "The five most interesting stories, rumors and notes in the NBA:\n\n1. Career day season:\n\nAfter the 2008-09 season, when he was still with the Trail Blazers,\n\n, from the 8 he had worn since coming to Portland out of Seattle Prep in 2005 to 23, his old high school number, and, of course, one that has great meaning in the NBA as it was worn by Michael Jordan.\n\nOn Saturday, Webster -- wearing No. 9 with Washington -- channeled Jordan with an amazing performance as\n\nwhile shooting 7 for 10 behind the three-point arc to lead the Wizards past the visiting Suns.\n\nAfter he made his seventh three,\n\nas his towel-waving teammates cheered, the Washington Post's Michael Lee reports. And if there was any question it was a Jordan thing, teammate Bradley Beal cleared that up in the locker room.\n\n“He studies Jordan all the time, too. He thinks he’s Jordan,” Beal tells Lee with a laugh. “I might have to start calling him Jordan; he’s dropping 30.”\n\nAs Blazers fans know, Jordan's shrug came in Chicago's Game 1 against Portland in the 1992 NBA Finals, after Jordan made his sixth three-pointer, which gave him a Finals record 35 first-half points, and Chicago went on to win 122-89.\n\nShrug or no shrug, it was a heck of a performance by Webster, whose previous career-high was 28 points, accomplished twice, both in his final season in Portland. The first was on Jan. 23, 2010, when\n\nto help the Blazers make up for the absence of Brandon Roy (out with a hamstring injury) and win at Detroit.\n\nA few weeks later, on Feb. 16,\n\n, this time at home against the Clippers as he shot 7 for 11 behind the arc. (The game was supposed to be Roy's return game from the hamstring injury, but he could only play 15 minutes, although he soon returned to form for what turned out to be the last great stretch of his career).\n\nFour months and eight days later, Webster's Portland run ended when he was traded to Minnesota in a draft-day deal that brought Luke Babbitt to Portland. The deal, made by GM Kevin Pritchard before he was fired the same day, brought the Blazers enough under the luxury tax threshold that they could sign an offer sheet through which their acquired Wesley Matthews.\n\nAs for Webster, his two Minnesota seasons were rough as he missed 55 games, mostly with back issues. Last summer, the Timberwolves, in a flurry of moves through which they hoped to acquire then-restricted free agent Nicolas Batum,\n\n, who had this season at $5.7 million left on his contract, but with only $600,000 guaranteed.\n\nWebster -- who still lives in Portland in the off-season -- landed a one-year deal with Washington for $1.75 million, and has had a terrific season. He is averaging a career-best 11.6 points, and his 45.3 percent three-point shooting ranks No. 3 in the league.\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota is dead last in the league in three-point shooting at 29.9 percent. The players the Timberwolves signed after waiving Webster -- Chase Budinger, Andrei Kirilenko and Brandon Roy -- have missed a combined 136 games this season because of injuries.\n\nEarlier this month, Webster was back in Minnesota for a game, and revealed that he\n\n, 1500ESPN.com's Dana Wessel reported.\n\n\"It just would have been more respectful if I would have gotten a phone call (from GM David Kahn) instead of seeing it on the ESPN ticker,\" Webster said. \"That is just me. Maybe that is the way it is done, but I think it would have been a bit more tasteful if I would have gotten a phone call.\"\n\nTimberwolves Rick Adelman said of Webster: \"He is a good player and he having a very good year for them. He is shooting in the (40 percents) from three. He still shot 35 (percent) last year which would be historic for us (this year).\"\n\nWebster's good play is well-timed as he will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. The Wizard's franchise player, point guard\n\n, the Washington Examiner's Craig Stouffer reports.\n\n\"I already talked to Ted (Leonsis, team owner) about that one,\" Wall tells Stouffer. \"That's an easy, hands down question about trying to get [Webster] back here because him being a free agent, there's a lot of people that are going to come after him.\"\n\n2. The Larry Sanders show:\n\nMilwaukee's Larry Sanders is gaining quite a reputation this season, and it isn't for\n\n, which he does.\n\nNope, Sanders is gaining a reputation for being a hothead who seems to have no respect for officials, who in turn have seemingly lost all patience with him. On Wednesday,\n\nafter receiving two technical fouls, first for arguing a foul call, then giving all three officials a thumb's-up gesture.\n\nOn Friday, Sanders did it again, getting thrown out late during the Bucks' loss to Miami after arguing a call. After the game, he made comments that seemed to suggest favoritism toward the Heat, saying:\n\n\"I can imagine it's hard for a referee to ref a Miami Heat game. It's hard for me to take that sometimes. I feel like things are kind of swayed. Maybe (I should) care a little less.\"\n\nThat was apparently enough for the league, which\n\n\"for using a derogatory and offensive term and publicly criticizing the officials.\"\n\nThe fine, which was quite large by league standards, had a cumulative feel to it. Sanders has been ejected four times and this season. He had already started getting a reputation as a player who can fly off the handle, especially after this incident late last season:\n\n3. Keeping it together:\n\nThe Lakers remain comfortably in eighth place in the\n\nat a time that spot seemed in danger with Kobe Bryant out with an ankle injury. Instead, they continue to win without Bryant, which is bad news for the teams hoping to run them down (Utah, Portland and Dallas).\n\nAfter spraining his left ankle in the final seconds of a loss to Atlanta, Bryant tried to play against Indiana on Friday but only lasted 12 minutes. The\n\n, beating the No. 2 team in the East.\n\nBryant didn't bother Sunday, and the Lakers really didn't need him to beat Sacramento, and\n\n, the Orange County Register's Kevin Ding reports.\n\nAfter that, the Lakers don't play again until Friday, giving Bryant three days to recover. By that time, they could also have back Pau Gasol, who has missed 19 games with a foot injury.\n\nSaturday during a two-on-two scrimmage, the L..A. Daily News' Mark Medina reports. That setback shelved plans for Gasol to return tonight, but he could be back Friday.\n\nIn fact, there's even an outside chance that big man\n\nin late April or early May, possibly providing the Lakers a playoff boost. It would be a long shot, but then, the Lakers even making the playoffs seemed a long shot for a while.\n\n4. Boo sequel:\n\nLast week's\n\nhad a sequel Sunday. Dallas fans let Oklahoma City's Derek Fisher have it when he entered the game in Dallas with 1:45 left in the first quarter.\n\nLikely\n\n, who told reporters before the game he would do so, ESPNDallas.com's Tim MacMahon reports.\n\n\"I'll just boo him like hopefully everybody else,\" Cuban said.\n\nCuban is holding onto a grudge after the Mavericks abided by Fisher's request to release him after he spent less than a month with them. At the time, Fisher said he wanted to be with his family, although he has since revealed he was suffering from a\n\n--"
