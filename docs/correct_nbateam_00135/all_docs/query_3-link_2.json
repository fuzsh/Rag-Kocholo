        "text": "Martell Webster, who last played in the NBA in 2015 for the Wizards, is attempting a comeback. Webster has had multiple back surgeries, and hip surgery led to him being waived by Washington. If healthy, Webster could be a long-range shooter and veteran presence off the bench. Webster, drafted sixth overall by the Trail Blazers in 2005, is a 38.2 percent 3-point shooter in his career.\n\nWith not too many free-agent options available to replace Hill’s production, the Pelicans are apparently working out Josh Smith, who had his best years with the Atlanta Hawks but has also played with the Detroit Pistons, Los Angeles Clippers and Houston Rockets. On his latest podcast episode with Bobby Marks, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Smith was recently working out for the team. Via The Woj Pod: “They have a workout there, with, I’m told, Josh Smith, Chase Budinger, Martell Webster.”"
