You Never know,\" Webster wrote Friday when asked on Reddit about a potential comeback.\n\nWhile all the money available in free agency with the skyrocketing cap is \"nice,\" money \"isn't a driving factor\" for Webster, who's earned over $44 million in salary over 11 seasons.\n\n\"It's the experience over all,\" Webster wrote, adding that if every team in the league made him the same offer, he'd choose the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n\"The day I don't (feel nervous stepping on the court), I would retire,\" wrote Webster, who last saw the floor in the 2015 playoffs.\n\nThe former sixth overall pick of the Portland Trail Blazers has career averages of 8.7 points, 3.1 rebounds, and one assist per contest, while shooting 41.8 percent from the field and 38.2 percent from deep.\n\nHe also reflected on his career, which included encounters with some legends.\n\n\"(Kobe Bryant) is a killer but a major goof ball off the court,\" Webster dished. \"He probably created the most infamous alter ego the game has ever seen. It was only developed to concentrate while going through the case.\"\n\nHe believes Bryant is tied with Allen Iverson for the most difficult to player he's ever had to guard.\n\nAs for his favorite basketball memory, it was his 24-point quarter versus the Utah Jazz in January 2008.\n\n\"I met my wife the night before that game,\" he added.\n\nEight years later, Webster, his wife, and their family are faced with deciding whether he'll play again.\n\nIn terms of his odds of signing with a team this offseason, he wrote, \"It's up to me honestly.\n\n\"Don't count me out just yet, bro bro.\""
