        "text": "Webster missed the first two months of the 2014-15 season after back surgery, and he never really got back into the rotation. The 6-7 small forward played in 154 games in his first two seasons with Washington but was limited to 32 games off the bench last year. He played just 11 minutes per game and provided 3.3 points, 0.3 three-pointers, 1.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, and 0.2 steals. For his career, Webster has hit 38 percent of his three-pointers, but he hit just 23 percent from long range last year. If climbing back into minutes after back surgery weren't enough, Webster is faced with a daunting roster of three-point shooters. In the offseason, the Wizards added Jared Dudley, Alan Anderson ,and Gary Neal to go along with starter Bradley Beal and rookie Kelly Oubre. Webster will need to show that he can knock down three-pointers at a proficient rate again to earn any burn. He has reportedly dropped 20 pounds over the offseason to stay healthier in the 2015-16 season. Webster has faced this climb after previous back surgeries, but the 28-year-old may be running out of time in his NBA career.\n\nMartell Webster is in danger of missing the start of his 10th NBA season, after he underwent surgery to repair a herniated disc in his lower back in June. With the procedure carrying a timetable of three-to-five months, Webster will likely be ready to play sometime between late September and early December. Last season, he averaged 9.7 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 0.5 steals, 0.2 blocks, and 1.3 three-pointers over 28 minutes per game, while shooting 43 percent from the field, 39 percent from beyond the arc, and 84 percent from the line. Long known as an above-average shooter from distance, Webster saw his three-point percentage decline from his previous season's career-best mark of 42 percent. His stats were down across the board in 2013-14, even though he only played one less minute per game than in 2012-13. The decline was mostly a result of poor play after the All-Star break, as Webster struggled to adapt to a decreased role, which was largely the result of Bradley Beal and Trevor Ariza eating up so many minutes. Ariza, who averaged 35 minutes, has been replaced by Paul Pierce, who is unlikely to match that mark. However, with 2013 third-overall pick Otto Porter possibly entering the rotation, Webster may still see a decline in minutes for the second straight year. If Webster doesn't make it back for the start of the season, and Porter impresses early on, the veteran could be looking at a bigger drop off than expected.\n\nAfter drafting Porter, the Wizards then committed to Webster for four more years. He should be the starting small forward to begin the season but should gradually lose playing time to Porter. Last year was a semi-breakout season for Webster, which included 42 percent shooting from 3-point-land and a career-high 11.4 points per game. Expect those numbers to drop slightly with the Porter addition and a healthy Beal at shooting guard.\n\nWebster was signed just before the start of training camp and is slotted to back up Ariza at small forward. He brings some offense and some veteran experience.\n\nWebster underwent surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back before the start of last season and it remained an issue all year as he missed 36 games. When healthy, he showed he could be the outside shooter the team has been lacking (.417 from three-point range). The T-Wolves are again in need of a consistent scorer at shooting guard and an outside shot, so Webster has upside to win a bigger role. However, he had the same back issue again which required surgery and he's out indefinitely. It's not clear if he'll every be healthy enough to be a regular contributor.\n\nFor the last couple years, rostering a Portland wingman has been a bit of a fantasy headache – even though players like Nicolas Batum, Travis Outlaw, and Webster himself all possess talents that, with a full 35 minutes per game, would very likely reward their respective owners. For a while, from November 21st to February 16th of last season, Webster had something like that chance, averaging 31.5 minutes per game amidst injuries and rotation uncertainties in the Rose City. Over that stretch, Webster averaged 2.3 threes per contest – really the only category in which he distinguished himself. That excellent mark, coupled with a decent overall line, placed Webster in the low-100s overall in terms of value. The concern with Webster in Minnesota, where he was traded on draft day, is that fourth-overall pick Wesley Johnson shares his position.\n\nWebster was the expected starter at small forward last season but suffered a fractured foot while training. That injury proved to be the end of Webster's season; he managed to log only five minutes of court time before suffering a setback. His rehab has gone well since then, and Webster should be back at full strength for camp. Before his lost season, Webster was the Blazers' top three-point threat and could once again provide fantasy value as a long-range specialist if he can find a regular spot in the rotation.\n\nThe 22-year-old swing man set career highs of 10.7 points and 3.9 rebounds while starting in 70 of 75 appearances last season. He has shown gradual improvement in his first three seasons and is slowly becoming a decent threat from long range, hitting 123 3-pointers at a 38.8 clip last season. Webster is still slotted in as the starter at small forward, but will have to improve his all-around play to hold on to the position. With the emergence of Outlaw and the arrivals of Fernandez and Bayless, Webster will have a hard time duplicating last year's production.\n\nWebster proclaimed that he would be an all-star in three years when he was a rookie. Well guess what; this is now his third year in the league, and chances are slim that he'll get to that point this year. One bright spot of his sophomore year was that he started the last five games averaging 11.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and one three a game, while shooting 45 percent from the field. He's currently penciled in as the starter at small forward but has Travis Outlaw, a more versatile player, breathing down his neck for playing time.\n\nThe drafting of Webster gives the Blazers a big time perimeter player that they have been lacking. But since he is coming straight out of high school, it might take time to get used to the NBA game. Webster could battle Juan Dixon for the shooting guard spot, but that seems to be a lot for an 18-year-old."
