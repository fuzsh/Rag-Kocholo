        "text": "The Washington Wizards are keeping swingman Martell Webster around for four more years, reports say.\n\nSources tell Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski that the veteran guard/forward will sign a four year, $22 million deal to stay with the Wizards.\n\nWebster appeared in 76 games in 2012-13, his first season with Washington, averaging 11.4 points and just under 4 rebounds per game. His 42.2 percent three-point percentage was the highest of his career as well.\n\nHe joined the Wizards on a one year contract last August after two seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He spent the first five seasons of his career with the Portland Trail Blazers after being drafted 6th overall in 2005 out of high school."
