He also is a father, a husband to-be and grateful for the chance to compete for minutes on a team desperate to add scoring and athleticism.\n\nNot to mention reverse its status as a perennial loser.\n\n“It’s just a chance,” Webster said during a news conference at Target Center. “Not to say I didn’t have one in Portland. Now the opportunity is a little bit bigger. This is something that means a lot more — coming in here trying to change the identity and make this organization a winning organization.”\n\nThe Wolves acquired Webster last week in a draft-night trade that sent forward Ryan Gomes and the 16th overall pick to Portland, which used the selection on Nevada forward Luke Babbitt.\n\nWebster is scheduled to earn $4.8 million next season and $5.25 million in 2011-12. He has averaged 8.5 points and 3.8 rebounds in his career. He shoots 40.7 percent from the floor, but Webster’s value is in his three-point accuracy (37.2 percent) and athleticism.\n\nHe will compete for playing time with rookie swingman Wesley Johnson, another sharpshooter whom the Wolves drafted fourth overall out of Syracuse.\n\nCoach Kurt Rambis has been scouting Webster for years, since Rambis was an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers. Wolves president of basketball operations David Kahn said Webster’s experience and ability to run the floor made him an attractive investment.\n\n“I think Martell has a lot of room to grow,” Kahn said. “We’ve been eyeing Martell for some time from afar. I thought he was somebody who had the potential to fit in well with the style of play we’re developing here.”\n\nA Naismith Award finalist as one of the country’s top high school players, Webster thrived at Seattle Preparatory School and was expected to play for the University of Washington, but instead entered the 2005 draft, where the Trail Blazers selected him sixth overall.\n\nHe started a career-high 70 games and averaged 10.7 points in 2007-08. Then, in October 2008, he suffered a stress fracture during the preseason, an injury that ultimately sidelined Webster for all but one game in 2008-09 and stunted his development.\n\nStill, Webster finished fifth all time for Portland with 408 three-pointers made and improved his defense considerably.\n\nKahn recalled Webster effectively holding his own last season during three consecutive matchups against NBA superstars LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Carmelo Anthony.\n\n“Martell’s a pretty darn good defensive player,” Kahn said. “We were not a good defensive team last year. We need to become better — as individuals and have a better defensive scheme as a team.”\n\nWebster likened how the Timberwolves, who are coming off a 15-win season, are using young, athletic players to build an up-tempo team that pushes the basketball to how the Trail Blazers evolved during his tenure in Portland.\n\nIn his first two seasons, Portland won just 21 and 32 games, respectively, before adding stars Brandon Roy and Greg Oden, who led a resurgence under coach Nate McMillan that has the Blazers coming off consecutive 50-win, playoff seasons.\n\n“The night is darkest just before the dawn,” Webster said. “That’s not to say it’s going to get better right away here. But it’s important we go through that together. We have to have the mind-set that this is all we have. We have to do it ourselves.”\n\nThey might not have to, however.\n\nThe most anticipated free-agent season in recent years starts at 11:01 p.m. Wednesday, and Kahn has vowed that the Wolves will be players in the annual talent bazaar.\n\nKahn reiterated Monday that the frenzy is legitimate for a class that includes the trifecta of James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, not to mention elite-level players such as Carlos Boozer and Amare Stoudemire.\n\nSuitors and contract proposals are expected to grow exponentially once the market opens.\n\n“We have a strategy of how we want to approach it, but sometimes external forces may make you change strategy in midstream,” Kahn said. “The most important thing is to remain nimble.”\n\nTeams have a week to negotiate deals, and Kahn said he wants to schedule a couple of visits for prospects to tour the Wolves’ facility and meet owner Glen Taylor.\n\n“We have a decent little story to tell. It’s one that’s building as opposed to one that’s already there,” Kahn said.\n\nMARTELL WEBSTER FILE\n\nBorn: Dec. 4, 1986, Edmonds, Wash.\n\nHigh school: Seattle Preparatory\n\nPosition: Guard/forward\n\nHeight, weight: 6 feet 7, 235 pounds\n\nExperience: Five NBA seasons\n\nAcquired: From Portland Trail Blazers for 16th overall pick and forward Ryan Gomes on June 24. … Selected by Portland sixth overall in 2005 NBA draft.\n\nStatistics: Posted career highs of 10.7 points and 3.9 rebounds in 70 starts in 2007-08. … Stress fracture limited Webster to just one game in 2008-09. … His 42 three-pointers in January 2010 tied for the most by any player that month. … Averaged 9.4 points and 3.3 rebounds last season.\n\nDid you know? He’s the cousin of Jason Terry of Dallas Mavericks.\n\nHe said it: “My range is pretty much unlimited. It’s just how much I work on it. I know they definitely need some shooting here, and I’m glad to offer that to this team.”\n\nOriginally Published: June 28, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
