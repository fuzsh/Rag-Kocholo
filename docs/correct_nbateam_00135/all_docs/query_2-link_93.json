        "text": "LOS ANGELES – The Lakers lost Sunday for the 11th time since the All-Star break, with two regular-season games still to go.\n\nThe past two Lakers teams lost 15 such games combined.\n\nBoth those teams reached the NBA Finals, and though this one still remains favored to do so, its 91-88 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers cast further doubt on its worthiness.\n\n“A little bit concerned,” Lakers forward Pau Gasol said. “But I think we’re going to get it right soon enough.”\n\nKobe Bryant missed four of those post-All-Star Games (two being losses), but he was back Sunday and no better with his shot than before sitting out two games to recharge his legs. Bryant shot 8 for 23 from the field and left two free throws short with a chance to put the Lakers ahead with 6.8 seconds to play.\n\n“I’m a little rusty, a little stiff from not playing, not being active,” Bryant said. “I’ll be fine.”\n\nThe loss cost the Lakers home-court advantage over Orlando if the two teams meet in the NBA Finals – unless the Lakers can gain a game on the Magic in the final two regular-season games.\n\nThe Trail Blazers, who played most of the game without star Brandon Roy because of what is believed to be a minor knee bruise, are in position to avoid a first-round series with the Lakers now. Oklahoma City looms as the most likely Lakers opponent, although it could still be San Antonio or Portland.\n\nAfter Bryant’s missed free throws, Derek Fisher missed another foul shot.\n\n“Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying,” Fisher said about the co-captains faltering.\n\nFisher then misread Martell Webster’s move at the other end and fouled Webster on a running 3-point attempt. After Webster made all three shots, Lakers coach Phil Jackson turned not to Bryant, but to Gasol to try a tying 3-point shot that was too long.\n\nGasol had another strong game (23 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three blocks), but the Lakers were not sharp in running their offense and the bench players were criticized again after the game by Jackson."
