Quickly realising his true passion was for painting, he transferred from architecture to the painting department.\n\nArtistic Style\n\nVasily Polonov, a professor at the Moscow School, first captured Korovin’s fascination for the emerging Paris technique beginning to be known as impressionism. It was while studying with Polonov that Korovin painted Portrait of a Chorus Girl (or The First Swallow) for which he later became known as the first Russian Impressionist.\n\nKorovin divided his time between Paris and Okhotino, north of Moscow, where his home’s glass-enclosed terrace became the artist’s studio and social salon. One of his most famous works, The Terrace captures a social moment in this room. This is one of many works in which he has suspended in time a simple scene in the company of friends.\n\nOccupation and Remuneration\n\nIt was in the theatre that Korovin made his living. He applied his artistic talents in costume design and onto larger canvases as a stage designer at both the Moscow Bolshoi and the St Petersburg Mariinsky theatres, as well as at La Scala Opera in Milan. He was so admired for his theatre design work on ultra-large canvases that the Russian Army consulted with him during the First World War for camouflage security for their headquarters.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nWant to Learn More?\n\nYou might be interested in my Painting Academy course. I’ll walk you through the time-tested fundamentals of painting. It’s perfect for absolute beginner to intermediate painters.\n\nThanks for Reading!\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read this post and I hope you found it helpful.
