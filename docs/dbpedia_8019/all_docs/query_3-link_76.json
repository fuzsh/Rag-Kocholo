        "text": "A dedication ceremony to officially open the Vandal Healing Garden and Memorial will be held at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 21, on the University of Idaho Moscow campus. Our students worked diligently over the last year and summer to design and build the garden as a place of healing and reflection and to honor the memories of all Vandals who have died while enrolled at the university. A memorial sculpture within the garden will specifically memorialize Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen, the victims of homicide in November 2022. “The garden is an incredible reflection of our students and how much they have cared about this project,” Dean of Student Blaine Eckles said. “It is a legacy that will outlast any of our time here. This student-led project shows the dedication, care and resilience of our student body. It truly showcases what it means to be a Vandal and honors our lost Vandals in a beautiful manner.” The garden is on MacLean Field, between the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences Building and the Physical Education Building. The dedication is open to the public. No access will be allowed within the memorial structure after 3:30 p.m., through the end of the dedication. During the dedication ceremony, the name plates inscribed with the names of Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Kaylee Goncalves and Maddie Mogen for the memorial sculpture will be unveiled. We will also remember the students we lost since the healing garden project began. At the ceremony’s conclusion, attendees can write notes of remembrance for anyone and leave them at the memorial site.\n\nVandal Healing Garden and Memorial dedication set for Aug. 21 A dedication ceremony to officially open the Vandal Healing Garden and Memorial will be held at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 21, on the University of Idaho Moscow campus.
