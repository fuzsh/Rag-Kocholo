        "text": "No. 3. Ryazan metochion\n\nIn the 15th century this building housed the Godunov chambers, and later on the Ryazan metochion, where the Ryazan bishops lived. Under Catherine the Great it was home to the Secret Expedition, something akin to the secret police, which investigated a variety of issues of state. There were rooms where defendants, including Emelyan Pugachev, were held.\n\nThe plans for the house, designed in a pseudo-Russian style, were brought to life in 1895 by the architect V. E. Sretensky, who served in this building during its construction. He also designed numerous churches across the capital, including Kazan Cathedral on Red Square.\n\n#Literary Myasnitskaya #Academic Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya\n\nNo. 7 Bldng 2. Chertkov House\n\nDolkorukov estate, in the 18th century ownership passed to the Saltykovs.\n\nPrince Alexei Dolgorukov a tutor to young emperor Peter II, inherited the estate. In 1742 ownership passed to Nikolai Saltykov and his heirs. In 1831, the property was acquired by Col (Rtd) Alexander Chertkov, Moscow Province Marshal of Nobility and renowned bibliophile who built up a priceless library.\n\nIn the mid 1890s, the halls of the main building at the Chertkov estate were leased out by their new owner, Claudia Nikonovna Obidina, to the Moscow Architectural Society, which brought together leading Moscow architecture professionals and was headed by academic, architect, and tutor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, Konstantin Mikhailovich Bykovsky.\n\nBykovsky was behind the design for the construction of a university clinical town at Devichye Pole (Bolshaya Tsaritsynskaya, now Bolshaya Pirogovskaya, Street), and the Zoological Museum. Bykovsky himself advocated the restoration of old monuments and personally restored a number of them, including the Cathedral of the Assumption at the Moscow Kremlin. Bykovsky also restored the Church of Frol and Laurus, at Myasnitskaya 23. Before the 20th century, the Church housed numerous antiquities, 17th century icons, and the paintings that decorated its interior included depictions of Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Solon, holding scrolls.\n\n#Literary Myasnitskaya #Academic Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya #People\n\nNo. 13. Income-bearing property owned by S. Davydova, Kh Spiridonov, buildings dating from the 18th-20th centuries\n\nIn the 1860s, the estate was acquired by well-known Moscow merchant Kh. D. Spiridonov, who wanted to build additional floors. The architect Karl Vasilievich Treiman took up the project to build 4 floors. In 1889 Treiman won a competition to build the main Nizhegorod market, was the architect who worked on the Moscow Fire Insurance Association. He was involved in numerous projects on Moscow estates, such as that owned by banker and industrialist A. L. Knop on Bolshaya Nikitskaya street.\n\nIn the early 20th century his daughter, Serafima Davydova, inherited the estate. She chose to carry out more work on the building and turned to the famous Moscow architect, who had done the designs for the Choral Synagogue, Semen Eibushits. That is how the building we see today came into existence.\n\n#Academic Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya #Artistic Myasnitskaya #People\n\nNo. 6. Building rented out by N.D. Stakheev, architect M.F. Bugrovsky, 1897 (extension 1986)\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, according to census information, this building was owned by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan P. Leontiev.\n\nIn the late 1830s the property was transferred to Moscow merchant I. I. Ferster, after which its next new owner took charge in 1896. This was Nikolai Dmitrievich Stakheev, philanthropist and gold industrialist, who became the main advocate of the art of I. I. Shishkin. Stakheev commissioned the construction of 11 buildings in Moscow, including the building at Myasnitskaya, and Mikhail Fedorovich Bugorovsky worked on many of them.\n\nBugorovsky studied at the Moscow School for Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture alongside Shekhtel, and later carried the title ‘Honorary Citizen’, one of the most privileged positions in the Russian empire’s urban centers. Thanks to him, a higher-rise building with flats and shops was built on the site of the old building.\n\n#Literary Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya #People\n\nNo. 8. Porcelain House\n\nIn the 18th century the building was owned by the Zybin family, and later by Prince Tyufyakin, and even served as a finishing school for noblewomen in the years before 1825. From the mid 19th century it was rented out to paying guests.\n\nThe current building was constructed in 1898-1903, by the architect F. O. Shekhtel, for the Association of Porcelain and Faience Producers by Matvey Sidorovich Kuznetsov. It became a tradition followed to this day that the building should house a porcelain shop. Shekhtel was also behind the initiative to renovate the income-bearing properties at the Stroganov School of Technical Drawing in 1906. The architect was the leading light in the modern school in pre-revolutionary Russia and the world, and Shekhtel was also one of the founders of the Moscow Literary and Artistic Circle. He was also the permanent chair of the Moscow Society of Architects and honorary member of the Society for British Architects, and the Architectural Associations of Rome, Vienna, Glasgow, Munich, Berlin and Paris.\n\n#Academic Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya #People\n\nNo.20. Building rented out by the heirs of the merchant Ananov\n\nIn the 18th century the property was owned by Koltsov-Mosalsky princes, their manor house is preserved to this day in the courtyard.\n\nThe existing building, which looks out onto Myasnitskaya, was built in 1900 by the architect Alexander Ivanov, who designed the hotel National. The reconstruction was initiated by the merchant’s heirs, who rented out the property. It was rented by, among others, ‘Chief Office of Engineer Alexander Bari’, one of the first engineering companies in Russia, which employed the outstanding engineer and architect Vladimir Shukhov as technical engineer.\n\nIn the mid-1920s the building was transferred to the USSR Oil Syndicate and an additional two stories were added. This took place under the engineer Ivan Rerberg, architect and teacher at MUZhVZ. It currently houses HSE’s main building. Rerberg’s architectural successes range from the construction of Moscow’s sewer system and the Pushkin Museum to the Central Telegraph Building on Tverskaya Street. The building currently houses the HSE Main Building.\n\n#Academic Myasnitskaya #Architectural Myasnitskaya #People"
