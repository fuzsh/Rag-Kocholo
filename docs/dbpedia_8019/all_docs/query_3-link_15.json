        "text": "VKHUTEMAS (Higher Art and Technical Studios) was the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow. The workshops were established by a decree from Vladimir Lenin with the intentions to prepare master artists of the highest qualifications for industry, builders, and managers for professional-technical education. The school had 100 faculty members and an enrollment of 2,500 students.\n\nVKHUTEMAS was formed by a merger of two previous schools: the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture and the Stroganov School of Applied Arts. The workshops had courses in graphics, sculpture, architecture, printing, textiles, ceramics, woodworking, and metalworking. It was a center for three major movements in avant-garde art and architecture: constructivism, rationalism, and suprematism. In 1926, the school was reorganized and in 1930 dissolved, following political and internal pressures throughout its ten-year existence. The school's faculty, students, and legacy were dispersed into as many as six other schools. However, many of the materials produced by students and faculty of VKHUTEMAS survived and are now part of extensive archives owned by Moscow Architecture Institute, MARKHI."
