Dormitories rooms are comfortable, good furnished, central heated and have all necessary facilities for living.\n\nMoscow City\n\nMoscow is the capital of Russia, the largest city in the country and Europe, and one of the largest cities in the world. Moscow refers to global cities having a great influence on the world because of its high economic level and population. It is the main transport hub of Russia, its political, economic, cultural, and scientific center.\n\nMoscow features\n\nMoscow is located in the center of the European part of Russia, between the rivers Oka and Volga. The climate is moderate continental: heavy frosts and extreme heat are rare. The average temperature in January – minus 7.2 degrees Celsius, in July – plus 20.4 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe city has the status of a separate federal subject of the Russian Federation. It is the smallest federal subject by land area.\n\nThe name of the city as well as the names of many other cities around the world, is bound with the name of the river it is standing on (the Moskva River). The river was called this way long before the settlement appeared. It is unknown who named it and what this name means. There are two main versions: Finnio-Ugric and Slavic.\n\nAccording to the first one, the word “Moskva” is derived from the Finno-Ugric language group which means “river-bear”. The Slavic theory points to the stem “mosk” denoting “marshy” or “moisture, liquid, marshland, dampness”.\n\nThe city is surrounded by 6 airports, 9 railway stations, and 3 river ports. Moscow has developed a fabulous metro (subway) system. The first stations were built in 1935.\n\nMoscow is the largest Russian financial center. About half of Russian banks are located in Moscow. Most of the largest companies are registered and have head offices in Moscow, although their manufactures might be located thousands of km from the city.\n\nThe city is the most important center of retail sales in Russia. Moscow represents about 30% of all commodities sold in Russia.\n\nMoscow is also a large scientific center. There are a lot of scientific research institutes carrying out research in many branches, such as nuclear power, microelectronics, space exploration and other promising directions."
