        "text": "Ivan Shishkin (1832-1898) was a late nineteenth century Russian landscape painter. He is revered in Russia and has steadily become better known in the West. Shishkin received a classical painting education in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and also was the recipient of Imperial scholarships for study abroad. He was a contemporary of Isaac Levitan (my other favorite Russian) and they exhibited together as part of a group called the Itinerants.\n\nShishkin is best known and loved for his forest scenes and was often referred to as “the poet of the forest”.\n\nThe Mast Tree Grove\n\nThis massive painting, approximately 65 x 99, was painted in the last year of the artist’s life!\n\nEnjoy!"
