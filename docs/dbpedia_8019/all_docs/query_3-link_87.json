It is an excellent example of classical style architecture built during the Progressive School Era, with classic details in brick and white terra cotta that are unique to the area.\n\nThis landmark is the home of Moscow's first multigenerational, multipurpose community center. The 1912 Center was purchased from the school district by the City of Moscow in 1997 from funds donated entirely by private citizens. Phase I of the project (Great Room, Kitchen and Pall Plaza) opened to the public in October 2001. Phase II (Senior Center and Friendship Hall) opened in June of 2002.\n\nThe West Wing of the building was opened to the public for use in November of 2008. This project added a public meeting space (The Fiske Room), an arts workshop and a dressing room/restroom to the existing spaces in the facility.\n\nThe Second Floor Project, opened in January 2021, adds the Lecompte Auditorium, the Reception Gallery to the building. In fall of 2021 the Chin Lew Green Dragon Game Room and the Community Living Room became usable spaces in the 1912 Center. Two more classrooms were added in the fall of 2022: the Book Room and the Barr Family Historic Classroom. Another 10,000 square feet of space remains to be renovated on the third floor and plans for that are underway!\n\nFor more information or to get involved with future renovation projects, contact Heart of the Arts, Inc. anytime at (208) 669-2249 or by email at 1912center@gmail.com.\n\ntop"
