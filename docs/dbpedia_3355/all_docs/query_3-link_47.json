        "text": "DAVID BROOKS:\n\nA little. I mean, he's showing he is aggressive. But it's all on the Fed now. There was a lot of hope, I think, earlier in the year that the stimulus package and the fiscal policy would be able to boost some demand. When the thing was passed, the Obama administration projected that unemployment would be coming down quite substantially by now. That didn't turn out to be true.\n\nThen they had another set of projections where they called this the summer of recovery and Joe Biden said we're going to be creating up to 500,000 jobs a month. That's clearly not happening. And, so, it has been disappointing, what has happened to the stimulus package. So, now the fiscal policy, as my colleague Paul Krugman said earlier in the show, there is no political will. I think there is no reason to do it. It's just not effective. And so now it is all on monetary policy.\n\nAnd I think what we have to expect is what financial crises are like, long, slow recoveries. And just one final thing — the number that to me crystallizes this is the amount of personal debt that is floating out on individual households. For decades, it was like 45 percent of GDP.\n\nAnd then, as we went through the consumption boom, it went up to like 133 percent of GDP, huge amounts of household debt. And we had to wind that down. We're only down to about 122. So, that's just going to take a long time to get down. And that's why I think this is going to be a long, slow, grinding recovery.\n\nMARK SHIELDS:\n\nOn the Obama folks. And it was a self-inflicted wound. They are the ones who dubbed it. No one had ever heard of recovery summer before. And it reminded me of the rosy scenario and Ronald Reagan 30 years ago when cascading tax revenues were going to come in, and the economy was going to jump, and there would be no inflation, and the budget would be balanced, and rosy scenario emerged, not an interpretive dancer at a gentlemen's club, but an overly optimistic projection of the future.\n\nThe problem with making something like the recovery summer statement or rosy scenario is, it's one thing to say what is going to happen in the long-term or in the next generation. Don't ever say it's going to happen this summer, you know, or in the next six months, I mean, because that's when you really get caught on predictions.\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\nIt was the intellectual foundation for the whole policy. They had these models. And the models were based on what they call the multiplier effect. You put a dollar in and you get $1.4 of stimulus or $1.2, whatever the model is.\n\nAnd that was the model on which the whole policy is based. And it seems — and there is a big debate about this, but it seems that, to me, that the multiplier is not that high, that the effect is not that big. And that's why it is not just a policy — or a political mistake, though it is — it is a policy mistake.\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\nAnd that I guess is the theme of the speech: No. Obama is doing this. We're not going to do that. Obama is creating all these programs. We're not going to do that. But how the Republicans are going to address the long-term problems, there — there are two issues here. There is the fiscal crisis. But then there — we have had problems in labor markets for a long time. We have had wage stagnation for a long time. I don't think the Republicans are there yet.\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, on the show earlier, said we have slow growth. How are we going to improve the growth? John Boehner said nothing about that. So, basically, what he said was a political message: You don't like what the Obama folks are doing. We won't do that stuff.\n\nThat was a political speech. I expected a little economic thought going into the speech, whether it is supply-side thought or fiscal conservatism, something. But I would say, substantively, the speech was pretty thin.\n\nMARK SHIELDS:\n\nIt was an elevation of vagueness and generality to high economic policy. I mean, it was really nothing short — any time a politician — and I say this as somebody that likes John Boehner — says things like, we're going to have to make tough choices, and never tells you what the tough choices are, might be, ought to be, and that's — that is the kind of speech it was. It was — he came out strongly for tax cuts and against regulation of business. But there was no real hook upon which to hang any kind of…\n\nMARK SHIELDS:\n\nShe had endorsed Joe Miller against Lisa Murkowski. It's an old blood feud. She beat Frank Murkowski, her father, in 2006. Just — it's that recent, 2006 Republican primary in — for governor of Alaska. And she won, obviously, the governorship, and then resigned the governorship, at which time Lisa Murkowski gratuitously offered the comment she was abandoning the people of Alaska, she Sarah Palin. Sarah Palin settled the score by embracing Joe Miller, a veteran, graduate of Yale Law School, but a total unknown, and a real Tea Partier, I mean, somebody who doubts the constitutionality of unemployment benefits for out-of-work workers.\n\nAnd it's — she did that. At the same time, she insulated, inoculated John McCain against the charge on the right early on down in…\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\n… pro-life, to say the least, yes, in Alaska. And then to me the most interesting thing is, Murkowski is on the Appropriations Committee. She stands for the old Ted Stevens style of politics it: I'm going to bring some money out — up here to Alaska.\n\nAnd voters aren't liking that this year. The Appropriations Committee is being decimated. Robert Bennett, many others are losing from that committee. So, people want a more — we don't want the pork anymore. We just want no spending, and at least in the Republican primaries.\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\nYes, although, if you had asked me six months ago, was I sure? No. And I think smart people were not sure. And I think there were a couple factors that went into that. McCain was really aggressive. He didn't take anything for granted. He ran against J.D. Hayworth before Hayworth even started. Hayworth, as we knew, was a flawed candidate, hurt very badly by an infomercial he did saying, \"I can get you some free money from Washington,\" which is not what the Tea Party people want to hear.\n\nAnd — but McCain was a sign that, if you are an establishment candidate, and if you run hard, and in some ways not necessarily true to your best self, that you can win this thing. And he just campaigned hard and won.\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\nWell, the question will be whether Al Sharpton is going to be there with a group, and how many people find it extremely distasteful that he is doing it on this day, on that site. You know, one of the things to me, though, that I'm beginning to think more and more about is sort of the demographic chasm between people in the Tea Party movement and who they perceive as the elites, and they feel that both parties, the media, all of Washington and New York, is controlled by people with a tiny sliver from America, of highly educated, more affluent, and that those people feel completely unrepresented by the entire system.\n\nAnd so there is a political element, which we have talked about a lot, an economic element, an anti-government element. But there is also a class element in this. And that has the potential, I think, to get much more nasty and long-lasting, if that class element is really there. And, frankly, I think there is some basis to it. I do think a lot of people in the country look at a lot of people in Washington and say, those people are not me. And that's one of the newer themes I will be looking for. I'm going to try to go tomorrow and see what it is all about.\n\nMARK SHIELDS:\n\nNo, I plan to go. I disagree with David in this sense, that I think that the Tea Party is really a nation apart. I mean, nationally, Americans were asked, how do you feel about Barack Obama personally? And this is David's own paper's poll of Tea Party members and the general public.\n\nAnd they were 3-2 favorable on Obama, his personal qualities, and 88-7 unfavorable among Tea Party members. And they — Glenn Beck is 10-1 their hero. I mean, he's a figure who gets very middling and divided feelings in the country.\n\nAnd I just — I think that, tomorrow, the test will be — there's only two speakers of really national prominence, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin — will be the optics and the atmospherics of this, as much as anything else, not that either one of them is going to say anything that schoolchildren will be learning and reciting a generation from now, like Martin Luther King did.\n\nBut I think it will be whether, in fact, there will be the signs, whether there will be the buttons, whether there will be the disparaging and sometimes racially charged placards that have showed up at other Tea Party events. I hope it is not the case. They are trying to prevent it. They have said there will be no guns there, which is reassuring. That's — that — so — and would be in violation of Washington, D.C., law anyway. But — so I think it is — I think it is important. But I think this is a group apart. And to the degree that it becomes the face of the Republican Party in 2010…"
