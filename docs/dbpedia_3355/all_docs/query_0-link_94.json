        "text": "This article originally appeared in my Newsmax Column on March 5, 2020\n\nIn 2016, like many lifelong Republicans, I was a hesitant Trump supporter. The firebrand candidate's lackluster character, past Democrat affiliation, and polarizing rhetoric made it difficult to believe he could preserve the future of the Republican Party. Dedication to the party motivated my vote more than anything.\n\nHowever, one term later, President Trump has achieved unprecedented conservative success unseen since the Reagan Era.\n\nThe economy is booming. The President's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and across-the-board deregulation have led to more investment in the American economy than was even possible under Obama. Stock markets are surging, with the S&P hitting a decade-long high last year with a 31.5 percent return. Home sales and manufacturing are growing as well.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in over 50 years at 3.6 percent. The economy added 6.7 million jobs in Trump's first term. And wages grew by 3.1 percent through 2019.\n\nMore so than his economic success, Trump's remaking of the federal judiciary could be his most enduring legacy. Trump has appointed the most conservative judges to the federal bench in decades. In just over three years, Trump has appointed 192 federal judges — 137 of those judges are district court judges, 51 are appellate judges, and two are Supreme Court justices. Most notably, Trump has appointed an unprecedented 10 judges to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, dramatically shifting the ideological lines of the nation's most liberal appellate court.\n\nThese life-tenured judges will protect the values enshrined in our federal Constitution and ensure it is applied in light of the original meaning of the text, not how some activist judge thinks it should be applied.\n\nMoreover, Trump has been a staunch supporter of the pro-life movement. He lent the movement the most national recognition it has received in decades by becoming the first president to attend the annual March for Life in January.\n\nHowever, Trump's conservative successes are not the only forces that led to my enthusiastic support of the president. The degeneration of the Democratic Party into a pandemic of radical left-wing socialists makes the need for a unified conservative opposition even more paramount than in 2016.\n\nDemocrats no longer represent the majority of Americans' values or beliefs. Instead they continually pander to the radical socialist wing of the party, propping up the candidacy of the likes of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ilhan Omar whose platforms are antithetical to traditional American moral and political values.\n\nIn a CNN Townhall Debate at the begining of the 2020 election cycle, Democratic presidential candidates openly expressed their disdain for religious groups and the free exercise of religious beliefs. The candidates threatened to withhold the tax-exempt status of religious institutions that do not conform to the government's moral beliefs and openly mocked those who hold traditional beliefs of marriage and family.\n\nMany Democrats openly support the nationalization of private industries such as healthcare and energy. Their precarious \"Green New Deal\" is essentially a plan for the government to take over the energy sector and radically alter the nation's transportation industry. Of course, all of this government overreach will require a massive tax hike, which Democrats are quick to label as a Robin Hood-esque transfer from the rich to the poor.\n\nHowever, Americans are not too eager to have a party who cannot even run a successful caucus control their access to healthcare and energy. Only one-third of Americans have a favorable view of socialism, half of those being Democrats.\n\nDespite being out of touch with two-thirds of the American population, the active radical wing of the Democratic Party is sure to nominate a candidate with much a more progressive platform than many Americans are comfortable with. That is why it is more imperative now than ever that Conservatives have a unified front heading into 2020 to preserve the fundamental freedoms and values that our nation was founded on.\n\nPresident Trump's record success and dedication to Conservative principles make him the best candidate to stand up to out-of-touch Democrats in 2020.\n\nAlso, even though Biden had a good Super Tuesday, the policies he supports are not that different from Senator Sanders and I still believe Sanders has the easier path to victory. In 2016, we didn't know whether Trump would be a conservative or not. In 2020, Trump has shown that he has governed even more conservatively than President Reagan and the Democratic Party has shown that they are open socialist.\n\nDemocrats offer Americans where everything is free ... except for us. I would encourage my Republican friends to get involved in 2020 because this is the most important election of our lifetime.\n\nThis article first appeared on my Newsmax Column on February 18, 2020\n\nThe race to take back the Alabama Senate seat reluctantly handed to Democrat Doug Jones in 2017 is heating up and has assembled some of the most qualified conservative leaders to run for national office in the state’s recent history.\n\nTwo years ago, Alabama conservatives — if they voted — were forced to hold their nose and choose between someone alleged to have sexually touched a 14 year old girl, or a liberal Democrat who did not represent their political values.\n\nIn 2020, a pantheon of principled conservative candidates is poised to unite the state’s conservatives in a strong repudiation of Jones’s alignment with radical Democrats.\n\nThe three candidates currently receiving the most attention are Former Senator and U.S. Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions, Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., and celebrated college football coach Tommy Tuberville. While Tuberville quickly surged in popularity, he has not demonstrated the same command of the issues as other candidates.\n\nSessions and Byrne appear to be the two candidates most poised to battle for the Republican nomination.\n\nSessions is running a crusade to reclaim the seat he held for over 20 years before serving as President Trump’s first Attorney General. According to internal polls conducted in December, Sessions has gained the support of 44 percent of Alabama Republican primary voters.\n\nMany Alabamians are eager to send a familiar face with a known conservative track record to Washington to protect their rights and values in a turbulent and divided Congress.\n\nAdditionally, Sessions’s complicated history with the President may actually work to his advantage. The animosity between the President and his former Attorney General only ever went one way, and Sessions continues to praise the administration’s agenda. However, his perceived distance from the President may unite the few never-Trumpers left in the state who are increasingly lending their support to the President as a result of his economic achievements and shameful attacks by Washington Democrats.\n\nHowever, Byrne commands a strong conservative record in the House of Representatives and would be a refreshing face to the Alabama Senate delegation. According to recent polling, he boasts a 64 percentfavorability rating.\n\nIn his four terms in the House, Byrne established himself as a staunch supporter of conservative policies, advocating for the repeal of Obamacare, working to improve infrastructure, and championing the President’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nHe also worked to secure additional funding for construction of Littoral Combat Ships and ease government restrictions on Gulf Coast fishing, accomplishments praised by his coastal constituency.\n\nMost recently, Byrne earned a coveted shout-out in the President’s post-impeachment acquittal speech, calling Byrne and his fellow Republican House members \"incredible warriors.\"\n\nThis comes after Byrne was seen alongside Trump at the Alabama-LSU football game in November. In a race that could hinge on the President’s coveted endorsement, many see Byrne as the most likely candidate to earn Trump’s approval.\n\nHowever, given the President’s track record in making endorsements in Alabama elections, the White House may be better served by staying silent.\n\nAs an Alabama attorney and lifelong conservative, I would gladly support either candidate in the general election. However, Byrne is too essential to House Republicans to lose him at such a critical point in the history of the party and the nation.\n\nSessions has served Alabama with dignity and distinction and will return to the Senate with the same determination to protect the values of Alabamians while working with those across the aisle to achieve results for the American people, particularly in areas like infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, Sessions’s name recognition will give him a crucial competitive advantage over Jones in the general election — a vital opportunity for Republicans to regain a Senate seat and continue their record success in appointing judges to the federal judiciary.\n\nTwo excellent candidates, Sessions and Byrne will restore legitimacy in the Alabama Republican party tainted by the marred candidacy of Roy Moore.\n\nAs the race inches closer to the March 3 primary, all eyes will be on Alabama and a race that has massive implications for the future of the state and the Republican party.\n\nThis article first appeared on my Newsmax Column on November 1, 2019\n\nTo say Beto O’Rourke went too far in suggesting eliminating the tax exempt status of religious institutions is an understatement. He not only proposed the essential destruction of many community organizations, but he completely disregarded the meaning of religious freedom. Beto’s comments are an insult not only to religious Americans who hold genuine beliefs in their faith, but also to the LGBT community for which he is trying to advocate.\n\nLast month, LGBT activists attended CNN’s “Equality” town hall debate, at which Democrats espoused their views on civil and religious rights. When asked whether the tax exempt status of religious institutions should be eliminated if these institutions oppose gay marriage, Beto responded “there can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone, or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.”\n\nClearly O’Rourke has little understanding of the meaning of a fundamental right. Freedom of religion does not mean only the freedom to believe what the government says is acceptable to believe. Americans should be tolerant of each other and respectful of each other’s views and choices, but this does not mean that they must affirm those choices and accept other ideologies as their own.\n\nBeto’s comments make unfair assumptions about members of religious congregations and disregard the good that many religious organizations do for surrounding communities. Punishing religious institutions for fundamentally disagreeing with the moral facets of gay marriage assumes that people who do not believe in gay marriage also discriminate against LGBT individuals. It paints believers who love and respect their Lord and his teachings as bigots and perpetrators of hate crime.\n\nThis is simply not the case. Many among Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Americans who oppose gay marriage do so as an ancient, moral, and sacramental conviction. They do not oppose it because they are outright prejudiced towards LGBT individuals. In fact, many LGBT Americans are members of these same congregations. Democrats claim to be inclusive of Islam, but while some Christian and Jewish sects embrace gay marriage, barely any mosques do, and the law would be particularly restrictive on Muslims. His stance also assumes that everyone in religious congregations has the same views, which is a narrow-minded take on the complexities of many American’s faiths. People worship and believe in their own ways and have individual relationships with God — this freedom is what the Constitution seeks to protect.\n\nPete Buttgieg, another Democratic candidate present at the debate, stated that religion should not be used as an “excuse to harm other people.”Certainly this holds true in many situations — consider the practices of human sacrifice or genital mutilation. But the definition of “harm” has been overextended by Democrats, who have tried to block Americans from expressing their religious opinions in the most peaceful of ways. Respectful refusal to bake someone a cake, for example, should not be punished as a harmful act.\n\nWhat would be undoubtedly harmful is stripping religious institutions of their tax exemptions. Such a move could cause churches and other places of worship to be unable to pay property taxes and lose their property, and could bankrupt religious organizations because it would dissuade contributions. Obliterating the tax exemption would also affect religious charities that help Americans across the country; the Catholic Church feeds more hungry people every day than any other institution, including the government. Such a change in the law could also be potentially harmful to the LGBT community. Gay rights activists do not want others to believe that they are so insecure that they support punishing those who disagree with them.\n\nBeto’s comments speak to a greater issue in the Democratic Party: the inability to tell outlandish activists no, and the disturbing willingness to support anti-American positions. At the same town hall debate, Elizabeth Warren openly mocked old-fashioned religious beliefs, a theme that has not been uncommon among candidates on the left. This could prove to be detrimental for the Democrats, giving religious conservatives powerful ammo to use against them. There are also many Democratic voters that are members of religious institutions, a seemingly forgotten faction for many Democrats.\n\nAs the Democrats charge along their war path against President Trump, the party wants voters to believe that impeachment is right for the American people, and that it’s the president who embraces anti-American ethics. But voters should not be distracted by this smoke and mirrors show. If anyone doesn’t deserve to hold office, it’s any Democrat who is so willing to restrict Constitutional rights and constrain American freedoms.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Gage Skidmore\n\nThis article first appeared on my Newsmax Column on September 26, 2019.\n\nOver a year after Christine Blasey Ford first incited drama surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats and the media remain unwilling to allow the Supreme Court justice to live down these allegations.\n\nThe persistent media attention on false accusations of sexual misconduct is harmful not only to the sanctity of the Supreme Court and Justice Kavanaugh’s ability to perform his duties, but also to the entire culture of sexual assault reporting.\n\nLast week, The New York Times released an article accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his time at Yale. It was soon revealed that The New York Times released a correction.\n\nFord’s story was never corroborated by any witnesses, her own memory gave no concrete details, and the FBI investigation failed to provide any evidence of wrongdoing. Ford’s father reportedly supported Kavanaugh’s confirmation.\n\nAs an attorney, I want to put in perspective how ridiculous it would look if I attempted to support a case in court with no corroborating witnesses and one witness who did not recall the incident and questioned its truth. Such a case would simply be laughed out of court.\n\nIn addition to tainting the transparency of sexual assault reporting, the publicity of false allegations speaks to the irresponsibility of the media.\n\nThe New York Times issues a list of corrections for its articles every day. These corrections may often be insignificant, but for stories that carry the weight of disgracing a public official, the tenets of investigative journalism cannot be thrown aside simply to publish a hot story. It should be noted that the FBI performed a thorough investigation into Kavanaugh’s past, and outlets like The New York Times should question how one journalist managed to uncover a bombshell the FBI could not. The media should be a check on the government, but one individual’s story cannot and should not be enough to support national news.\n\nThe veracity with which the media pursues these types of claims calls into question the independence of media outlets.\n\nSuspicions abound that politicians, like Congressman Jerry Nadler, use the media as a tool to advance their campaigns against political opponents. It’s not a far cry to imagine Congressman Nadler and others manipulating minions in the media to bolster senseless impeachment efforts against Kavanaugh and the President.\n\nIt’s concerning that society seems so insistent on crucifying people for decades old mistakes. I don’t mean this in the context of serious sexual assault — victims should have justice for acts no matter how far in the past. But everyone inevitably makes mistakes in their youth, and people should not be instantly fired or made to resign based on childish acts they likely regret. Bill Maher recently emphasized this point, commenting that people’s mistakes from high school should not burden them for life.\n\nMaher, though vocal in his dislike for Kavanaugh, maintained that such accusations make Democrats look bad to the American people.\n\nSix of the Democratic presidential candidates called for impeachment before the truth behind the story came out and none of the six have changed their position, which is why many speculate that Democrats will pursue impeachment of Kavanaugh.\n\nThis article first appeared on my Newsmax Column on July 19, 2019\n\nThe future of the Democratic Party looks bleak for those Americans who still believe in individual liberty, natural rights, and the benefits of a market-based economy.\n\nThe party has shifted so far to the left that presidential candidates prefer to be referred to as Democratic-Socialists and House members pull the race card on members of their own party when they are criticized for their socialist agenda.\n\nIn fact, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) recently implied that Nancy Pelosi's critique of the \"Squad\" of four was solely based on the fact that they were woman of color. The leftists can’t defend their policy ideas so instead of having reasonable debates about the merits of a particular piece of legislation they simply just call anyone with a different idea a racist.\n\nTheir ideas can be summed up with the slogan “ask not what you can do for your country but what your country can do for you.”\n\nThe left continually poisons the mind of younger Americans with the idea that they are all victims, which only breeds hatred and resentment.\n\nAs someone who has a rare form of Arthritis which causes chronic pain, nervous system problems, and many other health complications, I fully understand what it means to have an obstacle in life that sometimes feels overwhelming. However, if I sat around and viewed myself as a “victim” I would never be motivated to find a way to make the most out of my life. That is why the message AOC and her squad are pushing is so dangerous because it fails to encourage people to find a way to overcome adversity.\n\nOn a rational level, it is difficult to figure out exactly what Progressive Democrats are even advocating for.\n\nDespite record low unemployment, a continuing economic recovery, and a declining poverty rate, their talking points make it seem as if America is in the midst of the Great Depression. Rather than find ways of creating better jobs for Americans and continuing current economic growth, their policies increase job killing regulation and taxes.\n\nThey offer “free” healthcare and “free” tuition without addressing how astronomically high taxes would have to be to fund such programs. They support paying reparations even though the overwhelming majority of Americans are opposed to it, including Hillary Clinton and Obama. They claim to have the solution to every environmental problem, but their Green New Deal would bankrupt the foundation of the American economy. In fact even if America stopped producing carbon tomorrow, the earth's temperature would only be reduced by 0.14 degrees Celsius by 2100, according to the UN report which the left so frequently cites.\n\nInstead of presenting carefully crafted policies to solve problems faced by every American, they offer free stuff to attract votes and gain power.\n\nHowever, it is not just radical policy proposals that threaten our system of government. The radical socialist ideals that have slipped their way into the Democratic platform are fundamentally inconsistent with the ideals that this nation was founded on.\n\nThe American founders created a democratic republic with a government limited by the God-given rights of the people. The Bill of Rights outlined ten ways in which the government could not infringe upon an individual’s liberty, not because that liberty was to be protected by the government, but because it is a natural right inherent in every human being.\n\nHowever, the ideals that drive Democratic-Socialists’ radical policies state that rights come from the government, not from the individual. Therefore, you are entitled to free healthcare because the government says you have a right to healthcare. You are entitled to free tuition because the government says you have a right to a college education. You are not entitled to your hard-earned money because the government says someone else has a right to your money.\n\nIt is interesting that these policies have quickly gained such popular appeal. As recently as 2016, the Democratic Party was reluctant to adopt any socialist agenda in its party platform. Therefore, it is important to recognize the factors that have led to such a dramatic change in the past four years.\n\nMost Americans, especially millennials and younger people, have never lived during a time that American capitalism was not successful. Even throughout the Great Recession, Americans were drastically better off than their grandparents and great-grandparents had been. This narrow lens through which many Americans view the world is often susceptible to ideas that today’s problems can be solved through collectivist and socialist policies.\n\nIf Americans wish to continue our system of republican governance that has protected individual liberty, promoted innovation, and improved the quality of life of its citizens for over 250 years, they should completely reject Democratic Socialism in 2020.\n\nTrump may have his flaws and I have been critical of him when he deserved it. But there is no arguing that President Trump's policies have led to the best economic growth we have seen as country in nearly a century.\n\nHis judicial appointments have also ensured that religious liberty and individual freedom will be protected for a generation and it was the Trump administration which defeated ISIS in a manner no one thought possible a few years ago. I hope in 2020 that Americans vote against socialism and for capitalism because the future of our nation depends on it.\n\nThe opioid crisis in America is still very real. In 2016, an astonishing 65,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. In Alabama, combatting the opioid epidemic has proved a difficult task. There were 343 opioid related deaths in Alabama in 2016, and the state has one of the highest opioid prescribing rates in the country. In 2015, there were more opioid prescriptionsissued in Alabama than people in the state—5.8 million.\n\nTwo of the state’s Congressional districts rank in the top five nationally for number of opioid prescriptions. Alabama’s 4thCongressional district has the highest prescription rate in the nation; 166 prescriptions per 100 people, more than twice the national average. The 1stCongressional district has the 5thhighest rate.\n\nOpioid abuse is not just an issue for Alabama. Other districts rounding out the top 5 are Kentucky’s 5thCongressional district, and the 1stand 3rddistricts in Tennessee. Experts believe that the areas where opioid use runs rampant correlate with places where people have felt neglected by the government; many of Trump’s blue-collar supporters who have lost their jobs and opportunities.\n\nThe problem has not been lost on Congress; last month, the House passed a legislative package meant to combat the nationwide opioid crisis. The plan focuses on treatment and recovery, prevention, protecting communities, and fighting fentanyl. In March, Congress passed a funding bill that delegated $4 billion to directly fighting the opioid epidemic, with $130 million set aside specifically for rural communities.\n\nFederal intervention is helpful, but it’s important that Alabama politicians actively combat the opioid crisis in their own state. As statewide elections loom, candidates’ stances on opioid regulation should be scrutinized. It’s a bipartisan issue; Congress crossed party lines to fight it, and Alabama politicians should work together as well.\n\nIncumbent governor Kay Ivey expressed her intentin January to work with the Alabama Opioid Overdose and Addiction Council to find a solution to the state’s opioid crisis, a team that she herself createdin 2017. However, she has offered very little in terms of a specific plan to keep opioid abuse in check. Ivey is the 3rdmost popular governorin America, with an approval rating of 67%, and will likely prove victorious in November. If Ivey does stay in office, it would be refreshing to see her adopt a clearer strategy to take on the opioid epidemic.\n\nIvey’s challenger is Democrat Walt Maddox, mayor of Tuscaloosa. In April, Maddox unveiled a clear planto combat the opioid crisis. His plan includes expanding Medicaid to address the crisis, creating a cabinet-level official to oversee substance abuse issues, and increasing the availability of treatment and counseling. Regardless of whether Maddox wins the election, aspects of his plan may prove helpful in fighting the opioid epidemic, and Alabama politicians should take notice.\n\nThe Alabama Attorney General is a co-chairman on the Opioid Overdose and Addiction Council, so the outcome of that election could also prove integral to the battle against opioids. Steve Marshall, the current AG, has emphasized fighting the opioid crisisin his campaign. Marshall’s plan of attack includes establishing better data sharing among multiple agencies so that problem areas are clear.\n\nThe opioid epidemic is not the only area of drug policy in which Alabama could improve. Drugs like heroin, cocaine and meth also pose a problem. The Sinaloa drug cartel, active in the U.S. in general, uses Alabama ports to bring in shipments of up to 100 pounds of meth and 50 kilos of cocaine that are then transported north. The cartel has been linked to a number of grisly killings in the state; the point being that the drug trade is active in Alabama and illegal drugs are widely available, and availability links directly to addiction.\n\nAn obvious elephant in the room for Alabama and other more conservative states is marijuana. Legalizationof the drug is supported by more than 60% of Americans. The medical benefitsof marijuana are proven; not only can it treat pain, but it can be effective in treating mental illnesses like clinical anxiety and depression. Those against marijuana legalization argue that it is a gateway drug, and that legalizing it would increase not only addiction to marijuana but other drugs, including opioids.\n\nHowever, some speculate that loosening marijuana laws could actually help solve the opioid crisis. Marijuana could provide health benefits for people who would otherwise be prescribed opioids, thus lowering Alabama’s opioid prescription rate. The state could also use money from taxation of recreational marijuana to help fight the opioid crisis and improve public education and awareness about drugs. Additionally, less strict marijuana regulations would lessen strain on the courts and the prison system, which is currently operating at 173% capacity.\n\nAt the moment, legalization of recreational marijuana in Alabama is a pipe dream. But, the state has shown some progress in other areas of marijuana law. CBD, a naturally occurring cannabis compound, became legalin Alabama in 2014. Studies show that CBD may help people trying to stay away from prescription medication. The substance has been met with positive feedback so far in Alabama, and medical research shows great promise.\n\nAlabama penalties for marijuana possession may also soon be reduced. A proposal to make possession of an ounce or less of marijuana punishable by a fine instead of jail time cleared its first hurdle in the Alabama legislature in February. Marijuana legislation faces a tough road in Alabama, but it being on the minds of politicians may be a promising sign.\n\nAlabamians will have to keep an eye on the November elections to see if their results affect drug reform in the state. Issues like the opioid crisis and marijuana regulation will be difficult to tackle, but candidates with hardened resolve could make a difference.\n\nThis article was written by Chris Reid and Katie Pickle. Katie is Reid Law's clerk and is in her third year at Emory School of Law.\n\nThis article originally appeared in my Newsmax column on July 12, 2018\n\nOn Monday night, President Trump announced his pick for Anthony Kennedy’s replacement — D.C. Circuit judge, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThe announcement was highly anticipated, and it’s not surprising that Democratic leaders spoke out immediately against Kavanaugh’s nomination. Sen. Chuck Schumer remarked, “I’m going to fight this nomination with everything I’ve got” while Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) stated that Americans must rise up so they could “win this battle” and derail Kavanaugh’s appointment.\n\nDemocrats would have headily opposed any candidate that Trump selected, fueled not only by their disdain for the president but also by their lingering frustration that Senate Republicans blocked President Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016. However, Democrats should think again before so fervently attacking Kavanaugh. As compared to Trump’s other potential picks, Kavanaugh’s core beliefs, solid record, and commitment to the Constitution suggest Democrats’ fears are unbased.\n\nKavanaugh’s background shows his qualifications and outstanding character. He is well-adapted to Beltway culture and politics, having lived in D.C. for the better part of his adult life. A family man first and foremost, Kavanaugh has two daughters, whose basketball teams he coaches, and first met his wife while the two worked together for the George W. Bush White House. In his speech following the president’s announcement, Kavanaugh shared that his mother inspired him to follow in her footsteps and become a judge.\n\nTrump expressed his desire to nominate someone with an Ivy-League background, and Kavanaugh meets this standard, receiving both his undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. Kavanaugh was a clerk for Kennedy in the early 1990’s, and many believe that he will follow in the path of Kennedy in his judicial reasoning. Following his clerkship, he worked for the independent counsel that investigated President Clinton, and in 1998 co-wrote the report that served as the basis for Clinton’s impeachment.\n\nKavanaugh went on to work with President George W. Bush for a number of years. In 2003, Bush tapped Kavanaugh for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Over his 12 years as a D.C. Circuit judge, Kavanaugh has written over 300 opinions, many of them dissents that went on to be considered by the conservative Supreme Court justices in their majority opinions on the same issues. He has run in the same circles as the other justices, participating in speaking engagements with them, and was hired by Justice Kagan to work at Harvard while she was dean there.\n\nIn addition to his impressive background, Kavanaugh’s approach to interpreting the law and upholding justice is admirable. He is a textualist in the tradition of Scalia, remarking that judges “must interpret the law, not make the law.” Trump described him as “one of the finest and sharpest legal minds in our time” and said he believes that Kavanaugh would set aside his political views and apply the Constitution “as written.” Mark Tuohey, who hired Kavanaugh at the office that penned the Clinton report, said his “most vivid memory of Brett was his thoughtful approach to an issue, not impulsive, not off the cuff. He had a very engaging ability to discuss both sides of an issue when we had to resolve something.”\n\nKavanaugh’s record supports this praise. Though he is a devoted Catholic, he is seen as less of a social conservative and more of a pro-business, law-and-order judge. Many Republicans had hoped for a stronger social conservative, but Kavanaugh’s proven ability to restrain his personal beliefs from affecting his interpretation of the Constitution will serve as advantage in the nomination process, because Democrats will be hard-pressed to show that he is a serious threat to abortion precedent. There is no real evidence in anything Kavanaugh has said or written that he would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. He has sided with the government in upholding abortion restrictions, but he has largely taken a middle ground approach. For example, in an ACLU case concerning a minor undocumented immigrant obtaining an abortion, Kavanaugh argued that no decision could be made until the government found the girl an adult sponsor.\n\nKavanaugh is a champion of small business, and many hope he will continue the deregulatory tone of the Trump administration. The NFIB has come out in support of his nomination. Kavanaugh has ruled consistently against regulatory agencies that exceed their statutory authority, and he will likely keep out overreaching policies that could hinder small businesses.\n\nThere is speculation that Kavanaugh could raise tensions on the healthcare front, specifically with regard to Medicaid and Obamacare. Kavanaugh was in line with Justice Robert’s reasoning in Sebelius, and it’s possible that he could go either way on cases addressing other aspects of the ACA. The uncertainty about Kavanaugh’s votes on these types of cases may not wholly please conservatives, but it shows his commitment to analyzing each case thoroughly and reasoning in line with what the text says, unjaded by his political beliefs.\n\nA main concern raised by Democrats is Kavanaugh’s position on sitting presidents and ongoing criminal investigations. The 1998 Starr report on Clinton, which Kavanaugh co-wrote, laid out the grounds for impeaching President Clinton for lying to his staff and the American people. The report reasoned that a president who lied, even if not under oath, could be impeached. In a Minnesota Law Review article in 2009, however, Kavanaugh expressed regrets about the Clinton investigation. He wrote that sitting presidents should be shielded from criminal investigations while they are in office, because such investigations are a distraction to the president in fulfilling his duties to the American people. Democrats argue that this article, along with Kavanaugh’s other scholarship, demonstrates a commitment to strong executive power.\n\nHowever, Democrats’ fear that Kavanaugh would protect President Trump against potential prosecution is exaggerated. Though Kavanaugh did argue presidents should not be investigated or prosecuted while in office, he said that a president could be investigated and prosecuted after his term. Kavanaugh’s disagreement with investigating a sitting president was based on his belief that impeachment was the proper process for removing a president. Kavanaugh remarked that a judge or judges should not take on the task assigned in the Constitution to Congress.\n\nDemocrats worry that because Kavanaugh is Trump’s appointee, he would be bound to support Trump in any case against the White House. But this accusation is not supported by history. In 1997, for example, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the lawsuit against President Clinton should be allowed to proceed while he was still in office. Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were appointed by Clinton, and still ruled against him. The Supreme Court also ruled unanimously against President Nixon in U.S. v. Nixon, though three of the justices, Powell, Blackmun, and Rehnquist were appointed by Nixon.\n\nLike all nominees, Kavanaugh will face a hard road to confirmation, especially considering the breadth of his legal scholarship. However, his background and record show that he is an upstanding advocate of justice, and Democrats should consider the totality of the circumstances before claiming they have a smoking gun.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Katherine Pickle, my third year law clerk at Emory law school who helped research, write and edit this article.\n\nThis article first appeared in my Newsmax column on July 6, 2018\n\nWhite House officials are working around the clock to ensure that President Trump is able to fulfill his promise to announce a Supreme Court nominee on Monday.\n\nLast Wednesday, the president expressed his intent to choose a candidate from a list of 25 individuals, and this week Trump interviewed 4 to 6 candidates from that list.\n\nMuch drama surrounds the nomination, as Democrats fearfully ruminate on what Trump’s pick will mean for the future of decisions like Obergefell and Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans eagerly await the decision, but not without hesitation. GOP faithfuls worry that whoever Trump chooses will not live up to expectations and fail to strictly adhere to the conservative agenda of sticking with the original intent of the Constitution.\n\nIn fact, in a recent interview Scott Beason and I conducted with John Malcolm, Director of Heritage's Meese Center for Legal & Judicial Studies, he stated that many conservatives remember the consequences of famous appointment disasters like William Brennan and Earl Warren.\n\nThough it’s no doubt a momentous occasion when there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, since it happens so infrequently, the country may not change as drastically as some Democrats believe. Based on the list of candidates, the Supreme Court will take a more conservative, originalist turn, but this will not be a departure from the Court’s direction of the past few years.\n\nIn reality, it should not be such a dreaded event for liberals.\n\nThe appointment is so highly anticipated because of Kennedy’s significance on the Court as the “swing vote.” Though Kennedy did side with the more activist justices in high profile social issue cases like Planned Parenthood v. Casey and Obergefell, it is forgotten that more often than not, Kennedy sided with the conservatives.\n\nHe had an expansive view of the First Amendment, as demonstrated in cases like Texas v. Johnson and Citizens United. Kennedy was also a strong advocate for conservative federalism, and leaned conservative on Second Amendment rights cases, like District of Columbia v. Heller and MacDonald v. Chicago.\n\nIn fact, in his last term, Kennedy voted with the conservative majority in 15 of 20 cases. He handed the conservatives important victories, including exalting religious freedom in Masterpiece Cakeshop and upholding Trump’s travel ban. The short-term impact of replacing Kennedy should therefore not be exaggerated. For the most part, Kennedy was a conservative justice who voted the same way as his replacement will likely vote.\n\nDon’t forget, Kennedy is not the only swing vote on the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts has been known to slink away from the conservative majority, on occasion siding with the more liberal justices in cases like Sebelius (the Obamacare decision). Additionally, Justice Kagan has sometimes joined the opinions of more staunch conservatives, for example in Lucia v. SEC. Kennedy’s absence will not mean no more swing votes.\n\nThese swing votes are key in some high-profile cases, but on the whole, most cases decided by the Supreme Court are not 5-4 decisions. Liberal and conservative justices vote together more often than you would think. In a typical term, about 80 percent of votes are in support of the majority opinion, and only 20 percent of decisions are 5-4. The cases publicized by the media are the hot-button issues, but in general the Supreme Court addresses more mundane, legally technical questions. Less exciting issues like which stock tips should be considered insider trading, how credit card fees should be phrased, and patent disputes often garner unanimous decisions.\n\nDemocrats are concerned that Trump’s nominee will be a firebrand conservative who will turn legal precedent upside down. But this concern is vastly overblown. What is clear from the list put together by John Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation and others is that Trump’s pick will be an originalist. A justice adhering to originalism should not be cause for concern.\n\nOriginalism does not mandate that justices strictly follow the GOP platform, nor does it declare that decisions like Roe v. Wade should be overturned. What originalist judges are committed to is interpreting the Constitution and ensuring that Americans’ fundamental rights, as they were expressed by the Founders, are not violated.\n\nLiberals worry that a conservative, originalist appointee would shake up the Court, but that would mean that the new justice would be a judicial activist. This is contrary to the tenets of originalism. An originalist justice would follow the Constitution and the law, not seek to drastically change them. Liberals worry about the future of previous court decisions that they know were not based on the Constitution. They worry that unconstitutional precedents could be overturned.\n\nTake Antonin Scalia — the epitome of a conservative, originalist justice.\n\nScalia pioneered textualism. Before his tenure, justices were reasoning wildly, making decisions that didn’t seem to be rooted anywhere in the text of the law. Scalia rebelled against these interpretive methods, arguing that it was not the Court’s role to make law. He insisted that justices should adhere to the law, even if what it said was “stupid.”\n\nScalia made clear that in being originalists and looking to the text, justices should not be partisan. Sometimes, what the text said would be contrary to what they believed, and they should rule with the text, not their beliefs.\n\nScalia remarked, “The judge who always likes the results he reaches is a bad judge.”\n\nHe emphasized that judges should not “tinker with the Constitution to 'do what the people want,' instead of what the document actually commands” because then politicians appointing new judges wouldn’t choose the best candidates but “only those who agree with them politically.”\n\nSo, what would another conservative, originalist justice like Scalia mean for the future of the Court? It would mean that, for the most part, precedent would be preserved. First Amendment freedoms will be expected to win. “Equal protection” will mean exactly what it says, and the Court will be more color-blind with regard to issues like affirmative action. There will be resistance against the Chevron doctrine, and federal agencies being able to make their own law.\n\nDespite the speculation that the Court would automatically overturn decisions like Roe v. Wade, there doesn’t seem too much of an appetite for this to happen in judicial circles. It has been the most notable abortion case, but there have been countless others; it would take more than a broad anti-abortion decision to erase all that precedent. Similarly, there has been no indication of a desire to approach the Obergefell decision, regardless of how thinly reasoned it may have been. The bottom line is that sweeping change will not happen overnight.\n\nThe apparent nominees whom Trump has already met are vastly qualified.\n\nAmy Coney Bennett, a former clerk for Scalia and judge for the 7th Circuit, proved her tough backbone when she was harshly questioned by Sen. Diane Feinstein in her appointment hearing. Other top candidates include two judges who clerked for Kennedy, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Raymond M. Kethledge, and Amul R. Thapar of the 6th Circuit, who has a solid conservative track record.\n\nJohn Cardillo, host of \"America Talks Live\" on Newsmax TV, addressed the concerns by some conservatives who were worried about Kavanaugh not being conservative enough and made a great point that if you examine his rulings it is evident that Brett Kavanaugh would be a Scalia conservative not a Sandra Day O'Conner moderate.\n\nThese individuals, among others, are staunchly conservative, and would likely bring an originalist, textualist, perspective to the Court. This should not be a cause for concern for Democrats who believe the Constitution is a set of rules that are changed by the people and not the courts. Sticking to the Constitution is not a bad thing. Our rights are defended by that document and are preserved in it, not in the philosophical musings of the judicial activists of the day.\n\nChristopher Reid is an attorney out of Birmingham who owns his own general practice law firm, which handles Business, Family, and Probate Law and high-end litigation throughout the state of Alabama.

He quickly earned the respect of his Republican colleagues and shepherded the House through major legislative successes such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts. However, his critics often accused him of spinelessness, especially in his refusal to stand up to President Trump’s often inflammatory and unconventional leadership. Ryan’s departure sends a huge blow to the Republican Party just months before the 2018 midterm elections that threaten to ruin their majority and will likely dust up a storm of candidates vying to fill Ryan’s shoes.\n\nBattleground\n\nDespite rumors circulating for months that Ryan had soured on his position as Speaker, the Congressman’s announcement was a major shakeup in the ranks of the GOP. Nearly 30 other House Republicans have announced their outright retirement, while Democrats need just 23 seats to regain the majority. Adding Wisconsin’s first district to the list of up-for-grabs seats threatens to invigorate Democrats and force Republicans to invest much more time and money in races once thought to be safe for the GOP.\n\nWith Ryan tapping out, Republican candidates for Wisconsin’s first Congressional district include an anti-Semitic white nationalist who has been banned from Twitter, and a politically inexperienced ex-Green Beret with a vendetta for career politicians. On the other side, Democrats’ best shot at flipping the deeply red seat lies in a union ironworker nicknamed “IronStache.” Democrats already average an 8-point advantage in the generic ballot, and the recent shakeup paired with a precarious group of Republican candidates has them feeling good about their chances in 2018.\n\nRyan’s departure also sends a major blow to Republican fundraising efforts for the midterm elections. Ryan has broken nearly every fundraising record to date and regularly attends a fundraiser a night when he is in Washington. While some have called for the Speaker to step down immediately and initiate a smooth transition for his replacement, Ryan has argued that it would be detrimental to put the GOP’s biggest fundraiser on the sidelines in 2018. With Ryan’s announcement, the battleground for the 2018 midterms shows no sign of quieting down anytime soon.\n\nWho’s Next?\n\nWhether or not Ryan steps down early or Republicans win the majority in November, they will be faced with the daunting task of appointing a new party leader. While many candidates will likely compete for the position, the new Speaker must have what it takes to balance a continually divided party and work closely with a constantly unpredictable president. While Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) have emerged as the frontrunners for the position, Scalise appears to be the man best suited for the job.\n\nScalise and Ryan developed a strong relationship over their years working together in the House. When Scalise returned to Congress after recovering from a gunshot wound suffered during the shooting at a Congressional baseball team practice last summer, Ryan tearfully welcomed his colleague back to Capitol Hill. The majority whip also received a standing ovation upon his return to the chamber, revealing the level of respect he has earned from his Congressional colleagues. In fact, the way he has dealt with his recent gun injury has set an example to the country that we can be hopeful and find ways to make the most out of difficult situations we face.\n\nScalise has been heralded as a hero since his return, but his ability to stare down a bullet is not the only thing that elevates him above the rest for the position of Speaker. As Whip, Scalise has earned the respect of both Republican caucuses, evidenced by his ability to mobilize voters to pass the recent tax bill. A strong conservative, Scalise would work to continue to push much needed conservative legislation through Congress and could easily step into Ryan’s legacy as the preeminent Republican fundraiser.\n\nHowever, Scalise has maintained that he won’t run against his “good friend” Kevin McCarthy should the Majority Leader choose to run for the position. While equally conservative as Scalise, McCarthy does not seem to have earned the same respect across the Republican ranks. His cozy relationship with the president — perhaps best reflected by his grandiose gift of Starbursts last October — has been questioned, as many inside and outside of Congress believe that the Speaker should serve as some sort of balance to Trump’s unpredictable legislative behavior.\n\n“Fleeting”\n\n“Long ago, I decided that I was going to make the absolute most of my time in Congress, knowing that my opportunity to improve the course of our country is fleeting. But I also know there are other things in life that are fleeting as well, like the time that your kids are at home,” Ryan said in a statement Wednesday. The outgoing Speaker’s words reflect the strenuous reality of such a position. With almost no time to spend with family, Ryan stated he feared becoming a “weekend dad or husband.”\n\nIt takes a unique character to assume the position second in line to the presidency, and Republicans’ time is fleeting to find party unity leading into midterms. While many members of the GOP are sure to compete for the role, Steve Scalise may be the best man for the job. A Congressional hero and strong conservative is just what Republicans need to lead the party into the future.\n\nSpecial thanks to Daniel Bruce, a member of my firm, for his help in writing, editing, and researching this article.

When the results come in, the right will inevitably claim that dead people are voting and the left will drone on about big businesses rigging the election.\n\nHowever, there is one thing that both parties can agree on- libertarians are ruining elections. Both sides will claim that libertarian candidates are stealing votes from their side and handing the election to their opponent.\n\nThis tactic is nothing but a tired excuse to cover up the failings of outdated and poor policy proposals. Instead of exiling the Libertarian party, both major parties should try and extend an olive branch. Compared to other very minor third party groups, libertarianism has a substantial and viable following.\n\nWhile the GOP has not yet been willing to acceptlibertarians as competent candidates, the Republican party voters have done so. New voices like Thomas Massie (R-KY), Justin Amash (R-MI), and Rand Paul (R-KY) rising on the national stage show Republicans’ voters willingness to endorse libertarian views. Additionally, the libertarian party has shown the ability to put aside some differences it has with the Republican party and endorse candidates that run under the GOP name.\n\nMassie, Amash, and Paul arguable lean the most libertarian out of all members of Congress. Unfortunately, they are not popular on Capitol Hill. But the GOP can learn a lesson from their struggle. Though they may not be popular with Congress, their message has resonated with voters- perhaps because they support new ideas and endorse policies different from the norm.\n\nMuch of what the GOP has put forth as policy in recent years has been more focused on what people think the Republican party should be and has been historically, rather than actual, concrete substance. New voices and new ideas from ideologies like libertarianism can mix in with classic Republican party ideals to reinvigorate the party platform and help the GOP compromise and build on certain issues.\n\nTo show the appeal that Libertarian values could have in the Republican party, look no further than Austin Petersen. Petersen is running for U.S. Senate in Missouri, and was a former libertarian presidential candidate in 2016. He has slowly worked his way into favor with Missouri voters, despite his third party views. Petersen has been able to use the animosity that voters have toward establishment politics and has run as the “anti-establishment candidate.” Who better to be anti-establishment than a man who was the presidential candidate for the party both Dems and Republicans despise?\n\nPetersen was considered a long shot and still has some work to do. He is running against incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). A very active candidate not shy from public criticism, he has openly advocated for Libertarian ideals while running under the Republican banner. For example, he has not hidden that he would like to see the income tax repealed but would settle for a flat tax of 15%. He openly flaunts his strict adherence to the Constitution by arguing for unfettered gun rights, going so far as raffling off an AR-15.\n\nMany Republicans in Missouri are finding Petersen’s libertarian views to be a new, invigorating voice among the monotonous campaign diatribes coming from other candidates. A new pollshows that this voice is being met with open ears among Missouri voters- the incumbent McCaskill is polling behind both other candidates. McCaskill trails Austin Petersen’s competition, Attorney General Josh Hawley, by 7 percent and trails Petersen by a margin of 16 percent.\n\nPetersen, along with Massie, Amash, and Paul, have found ways to connect with Republican voters and really bring a new life to a party that relies of images of the glory days of Ronald Reagan to garner support. These new voices are showing that Republican voters and Libertarian voters are willing to put aside some differences they have and accept a new voice and a new solution to issues. While the Libertarian party is considered as having unrealistic ideals by the GOP, voters in Michigan, Kentucky, and Missouri disagree. American voters know that the GOP needs to move forward to be successful against the Democrats, and embracing new ideals like those of libertarianism may be the road to victory.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dallas Coleman and Katie Pickle for their help in writing, researching, and editing this article.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Flickr user justgrimes\n\nJake Tapper is not an easy man to label. like so many of his colleagues at CNN, he does not wear his politics prominently on his sleeve. Though he has worked for Democrats in the past, and for liberal organizations, he was one of very few members of the mainstream media who maintained a somewhat adversarial relationship with the Obama administration. David Axelrod, a former Obama administration and campaign official, remarked on Tapper’s journalistic tenacity when Tapper joined him on his CNN podcast. Of course, compared to the kid gloves with which the Obama administration was treated by the media, any question tougher than, “what enchants you most about this job?” (A real thing that happened) might be viewed as the pinnacle of journalistic integrity. However, Tapper has made his reputation as one of exceedingly few newsmen who can be trusted to tell the truth regardless of the party in power. He joins Bret Baier as one of the last honest men in news.\n\nTapper grew up in a Jewish family in Philadelphia. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth University with a B.A. in History. Following his graduation from Dartmouth, he briefly attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts. He began working in politics as the campaign press secretary and later the congressional press secretary for a powerful Philadelphia Democrat. He has also worked for a prominent PR firm and what is now the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. As such, his path to media has been long and winding. He began his full-time journalism career in 1998 at the Washington City Paper, where he wrote a now-famous piece about going on a date with Monica Lewinsky, in which he denounced Washington’s love of scandal at the expense of a sweet girl like Lewinsky. The piece lent some insight into Tapper as a man; honest (some might say brutally so), straightforward, kind-hearted and passionate for the truth. He has since said that he regrets calling her “chubby” in the piece, showing a bit more how he has matured and grown into his role as America’s real alternative to otherwise fake news.\n\nAs a conservative, I have always been met with audible groans when I mention my respect for Tapper. The tribalism that we so virulently denounce in the left can affect us in equal measure. Our immediate distrust and dislike for anyone and anything on CNN is, quite simply, no more than partisan trash. Rather than taking individuals and stories on a case by case basis, we too often dismiss an unflattering bit of news or a journalist who is reporting facts that contradict a particular narrative simply because they appear on a network which we (rightfully) distrust as a whole. Distrust is one thing; dismissal is quite another. Conservatives are right to treat CNN and other partisan media outlets with extreme skepticism, but to deny that there are good journalists and even the occasional good story that come from an otherwise detestable source seems imprudent.\n\nNo, I have not always agreed with him, and find his looks into the camera while condemning the President a bit melodramatic. But as a man with a full body of work, Tapper remains a fantastic example of what the news should be, and how those who provide the news should behave. Yes, he skewered Stephen Miller, but he also skewered Sheriff Scott Israel for crediting his own “amazing leadership” following the shooting in Parkland, FL. Tapper is a respectable and honorable man, who encompasses many of the best traits of newsmen. Conservatives should be open to, occasionally, giving credit where it is due and recognizing him as one of the prudent leaders of an otherwise dishonorable industry.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce for their help in writing, researching, and editing this piece.

Matt Walsh, of the Daily Wire, is just the reminder the doctor ordered. Perhaps less afraid of controversy than anyone else in conservative media today, Walsh is a tireless advocate for the Christian faith. He has shown an utter disregard for the potential fallout of plainly and bluntly stating his beliefs and remains willing to inject himself into any debate or start one himself.\n\nOne of the most recent examples of his willingness to buck the status quo and engage in a firefight over a topic which others might consider trivial was his denouncement of yoga as a form of Hindu worship, claiming Christians should have nothing to do with it. In all fairness, the ensuing hell storm of angry responses was wildly disproportionate to his actual statements. Accusations of his being “obsessed” with yoga were wildly overblown. His Tweet read,\n\n“It’s kind of amazing to see all of the Christians who think nothing of going to a yoga class. There are so many excellent ways to get in shape that do not involve participating in Hindu worship.” He continued, “The best comparison for Yoga would be the Ouija board. Yes, you can play it ‘just for fun’ without any ill intent, but still you are participating in something that was designed to conjure spirits. Better to just play Monopoly or something. Why mess around with it.”\n\nThese terribly incendiary opinions actually led to something of a bizarre alliance, as Vox published a piece examining whether yoga was, in fact, cultural appropriation and questioning whether Christians should practice it at all. They take the scenic route, but end up at the same place.\n\nThe most telling thing about this “controversy” wasn’t the Tweet itself, nor the predictable reaction from many on the left. What was more telling was what the Tweet revealed about its author—Matt Walsh is a man who is not afraid to think outside the box, nor is he afraid to make enemies in pursuit of his beliefs and in his advancement of God’s message. Personally, I had never stopped to think about the origins of yoga and the implications that it’s practice might have on my Catholic faith. If we are to obey God’s commandment to have no gods before him, surely engaging in an activity designed to worship the pagan Hindu gods conflicts with it in some measure. This thought-prompting examination of an ultimately trivial pursuit is something that is entirely lacking in modern American life. Pastors and religious leaders have led their flocks astray following the “gospel of prosperity” or, perhaps worse, the gospel of Trumpism. Joel Osteen would never be willing to endure flack Walsh puts himself in, in the name of God’s will. Whether or not one believes that doing yoga is de facto taking part in Hindu worship, what cannot be denied is that Walsh is worthy of the respect afforded to anyone who is willing to take an extremely unpopular position and accept the Earthly consequences.\n\nI do not always agree with Matt Walsh on substantive issues. But what cannot be denied is that he is a stand-up guy, a genuine and honest Christian, and a man of immense moral character. He is worthy of great respect, and we conservative Christians would do well to imitate him more in our daily lives. We should begin each day with a simple question: “how can I best serve God today?”\n\nNick Briscoe is the manager of the Reid Law Firm and a recent graduate of the University of Alabama.

Those familiar with his work can attest to his brilliance and capability with the written word, however those familiar with his personal story can attest to much more—his deep sense of compassion, duty, and honor.\n\nA graduate of Harvard Law, French has spent much of his career in the depths of academia, having served as president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), and as a lecturer at Cornell Law School. In 2005, however, French retired as president of FIRE, citing plans to serve in the United States Army Reserve. Though a successful author, academic, and attorney, French sacrificed his career and time with his family in order to serve our country as an Army lawyer in the JAG corps. He was awarded a Bronze Star following his deployment to Iraq in 2007. However, his numerous accomplishments throughout his career as both a civilian and Army officer still do not reveal the full story of a truly one-of-a-kind man.\n\nIn 2010, French and his wife, Nancy (an accomplished and talented writer in her own right) adopted an Ethiopian girl named Naomi. In the pro-life movement, we often cite adoption as the no-brainer alternative to abortion, yet how many of us are willing to put our money where our mouth is and take part in such a blessing? My guess is fewer than are willing to glorify it as a perfect solution to a horrifying problem. The Frenches, however, were able to recognize that what many of us might see as a tremendous burden is actually one of the greatest blessings God can bestow. As French argues in a 2016 piece for National Review, an “available” foster child is only available because of a series of dreadful events, and these dreadful events will almost inevitably lead to some form of trauma later in life. Despite the challenges and complexities that arise through the process, the Frenches made the decision to adopt, and their lives have been eternally blessed by the addition of an angelic young girl. However, such a blessing does not come without its trials, and even the best of hearts are not repaid in kind.\n\nIn 2013, French wrote a scathing denouncement of the hypocrisy of some who insist that a white, conservative, Christian family cannot raise a black child. He describes the disgusting attacks he and his wife received following Naomi’s adoption, ranging from online comments to in-person confrontations at the hands of angry progressives. French mentions that not only has his family become a beautiful example of interracial bliss, but the congregation at his conservative church (he and his wife are Evangelical Christians) has become an idyllic representation of a group of people who truly do not see color, but only humanity. He remarks that, while the progressives who tout their own virtue by claiming to support ethnic and racial diversity responded to their practicing of such lofty ideals with hatred and contempt, the supposedly bigoted, backwards conservatives responded only with love and acceptance. Though one might assume that the adoption of a child would be a point around which all people could gather and rejoice, French’s experience is yet another example that nobility and virtue rarely avoid controversy.\n\nThe hallmark of goodness is doing good even, and especially when, it is the more difficult path down which to embark. David French did not have to give up a cushy career at the top of academia. He did not have to surrender a steady and rewarding legal practice. He did not have to serve our country overseas in significantly greater danger and for significantly less pay than he was making in private practice. He did not have to accept the overwhelming responsibility of adopting a child into his family that already included two children. He did not have to sacrifice so much for his fellow man, yet he did. David French is the kind of man we should all emulate—selfless, courageous, brilliant, and noble. It is my greatest hope, and my absolute expectation, that one day little Naomi grows up to recognize what an incredible blessing her father is to her, and she to him. The world is changed by men and women who see beyond difficulty and recognize duty. Though we all have the potential, David French is one of those men.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce who assisted in writing, researching, and editing this article.

This elite group of thinkers, diverse in ideology and ultimately uninterested in political pettiness, have revolutionized the media industry, providing respite from the shallow nonsense offered by cable news.

As a result, Rubin has enjoyed fiercely loyal support among those who have been starved of genuine, productive conservation in the political sphere. He has attracted followers from across the ideological spectrum, but often acknowledges that he receives the warmest welcomes from conservatives, and the vast majority of hate from liberals.\n\nWhy is it that an openly gay, self-proclaimed liberal has become the hero of so many conservatives and drawn the ire of his supposed liberal companions? As Rubin himself predicted, strange political times have led to strange political alliances and rivalries. He is good friends with fellow intellectual dark web staple Ben Shapiro. In the past, one might never have expected a friendship to blossom between an Orthodox Jew and an agnostic, gay liberal. However, this is 2018, and the only things that make sense anymore are those that defy all traditional logic and norms. Rubin has recognized the increased radicalism among those who self-identify as “liberal”, and the paternalism they seem to crave. He hasn’t quite abandoned liberalism, rather, it has abandoned him.\n\nThis phenomenon is becoming increasingly common as we undergo the most radical political shift of recent history. Conservatives who feel as if the GOP has left them for the more populist pastures of Trumpism, Trump supporters who feel as if the GOP hasn’t sufficiently supported them, liberals who feel that Bernie Sanders’ socialist revolution has led their movement off the rails, socialists who feel that Hillary’s people-pleasing nomination was a slap in the face—they have all remained constant, while the world has spun out of control all around them. Rubin might be the penultimate example of this phenomenon—a classical liberal who has come to recognize perils of progressivism and value the virtues of a laissez faire approach to government intervention. As a gay man, he supported Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop’s right to freedom of association, and he does not subscribe to the identity-driven politics of progressivism, which dictate that he must support strictly the pre-approved leftist talking points.\n\nIn order to move beyond the maddening news cycle in which we seem to be trapped like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, the world must recognize and appreciate the rare talent and dignity of people like Dave Rubin. He is not interested in devolving his show into a cage match, despite the ratings that might follow. He is not interested in blindly the following the partisan talking points that the old guard of identity politics prescribe. He is interested only in providing a crucial public service that has otherwise almost completely disappeared—true, thoughtful information on big ideas that are almost entirely removed from the political fray. In the age of the Trump obsession and hostile polarization on both sides, we must insist that more follow in Rubin’s mold. America would be well served to engage in the kinds of thoughtful conversations modeled by the Rubin Report.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce for their help in writing, editing, and researching this article.

Jesus hired a demon possessed traitor to handle his money for 3 years. He can use the President if He so desires. Take a seat people.” Walking the line between God’s tendency to use imperfect vessels to advance His ministry and one’s outright support of even a man’s worst vices is where many religious leaders have gone astray.\n\nThough Jesus repeatedly used the morally bereft in order to advance his cause, there was a general theme of repentance that accompanied each case. Saul repented, converted, and became Paul. Mary Magdalene abandoned a life of sin (though the degree to which her life was sinful is a matter of constant biblical debate) in order to follow Christ until the end. Without repentance, the endorsement of anti-Christian behavior by supposed Christian leaders is purely a politically driven exercise. In the midst of such politicization even in the halls of our most sacrosanct religious institutions, Christians are desperately searching for a leader who represents their values, their religion, and their culture without waving like a flag in the wind in order to appease the society at large.\n\nPastor Harry Reeder has spent a lifetime serving Christ and His followers. Since his arrival at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, AL, the faithful knew that Pastor Reeder was a kind and loving soul, a true Christian role model in these times of great moral peril. Natives of Charlotte, North Carolina, he and his wife, Cindy, have three children: Jennifer, Harry IV, and Abigail. They are also proud grandparents of eight grandchildren. As a man driven and dedicated so fully to family and to Christ, Pastor Reeder has led Briarwood Presbyterian to its position as a widely-recognized home for droves of Christians seeking solace in Christ’s word.\n\nAt a time where nearly every aspect of society has seemingly been co-opted by one faction or another for some political purpose, Pastor Reeder has kept himself and his church defiantly out of the political fray. While many pastors and religious leaders have compromised their most deeply held convictions in support of presidents, policies, and the like, Mr. Reeder’s steadfast refusal to enter the mud to appease his base is a refreshing breath of air. For those of us who wish to keep our politics and our religion as separate as is possible, his refusal to compromise the dignity of his church or its members in order to advance his own political interests or ambitions is a much welcome change. Like all great religious readers, and like Jesus the Shepherd, he has put the needs and concerns of his flock above his own.\n\nWe’ve seen recently the nation’s visceral reaction to the passing of Billy Graham. Graham, though a more public figure and more closely tied to the political world, managed to remain, himself, relatively apolitical. He counseled Presidents of both parties and various ideological leanings with equal wisdom and spiritual guidance. Despite his charming personality, strong spiritual character, and apolitical nature, some stooped to demonizing Graham upon his death – they slandered and smeared America’s pastor as a false prophet of God’s word.\n\nGraham’s fate is a reminder to all who serve God’s mission not to expect kindness or acceptance, and never to seek such things if it requires an abandonment of His principles. Mr. Reeder recognizes that his adherence to Godly values will not win him many friends in today’s cultural arena. Those who believe, like Pastor Locke, that the mystery of God’s plan mandates blind, hypocritical support for wicked behavior simply because the person caught in sin agrees with their political views will denounce Reeder for his insufficient support of their cause. Those who believe that Billy Graham was a false prophet will never acknowledge the true holiness of any public figure devoted to the Lord’s work. The only friends Harry Reeder will be making are, ultimately, the only ones he needs; his flock and the Good Lord.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce for their help in writing, researching, and editing this article.

He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, riding a wave of small government conservatism all the way through his re-election in 2016. Palmer has served the people of Alabama’s sixth district honorably, voting and speaking every bit as conservatively as he campaigned. While most Republicans campaign like libertarians and govern like big government statists, Representative Palmer has a solid record of conservative governance and is the kind of Republican that gives the party hope going into 2018.\n\nRepublicans live much of their electoral lives in the non-existent fantasy land between their electorate’s conservative leanings (especially for midterm elections) and their hopes of appeasing the media and appearing pragmatic. The constant battle between appeasing extreme-right constituents and extreme-left media is too real for many Republican representatives. As a result, Republicans often fear media reprisal for voting for a bill they campaigned on supporting, such as the long-promised Obamacare Repeal. However, this political strategy is ultimately fatally flawed. There is virtually no realistic upside—the media and the Democrats will not suddenly become enamored by Republicans’ attempts at wooing them, as evidenced by all of political history.\n\nThere is, however, a tremendous downside—Republican voters will abandon their constituents, especially in off year elections when Republicans are in power. The best hope for Republicans who employ this strategy is to ride into the sunset as a rhetorical hero of the left and the media, and retire once it becomes plain that their voters won’t be turning out to support them – much like Jeff Flake. If seeking reelection, Republicans must abandon this sleight of hand and commit fully to realizing the conservative promises they made to their constituencies. Representative Gary Palmer is one of few Republicans who, combining ideological integrity with political savvy, has remained true to his conservative campaign promises. As a result, he enjoys sky-high approval ratings and is on his way to a relatively easy reelection in 2018.\n\nPalmer has spent his time in the House actively securing his conservative bona fides. Most recently, Palmer cast a courageous “nay” vote on the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, the latest in a long line of egregious omnibus spending packages rammed through congress with little consideration, almost no debate, and virtually zero forethought. The GOP establishment rammed through the spending package, demanding support from it’s constituents. The Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative and libertarian representatives of which Palmer is a part, stood boldly to limit spending, reign in the bloated federal budget, and shed some light on the dark rooms in which these negotiations often take place. Unfortunately, Palmer’s effort and those of the rest of the Freedom Caucus were not enough to slow the runaway train of pork and waste that passed through the halls of congress last week.\n\nPalmer and the Freedom Caucus understand a fundamental truth that too many politicians are happy to ignore—rhetoric and promises only work until people feel the hits in their wallet. While virtually all conservatives agreed that tax breaks were an essential step to drive an economy out of historically low growth, very few advocated for the timeless stance of fiscal conservatism. The problem, as Palmer and others realized, is that one cannot increase spending, lower revenue (however egregious it may be that the word “revenue” references taxation), and expect to speed up a lagging recovery. One might argue that the spending and taxation might reach equilibrium, citing some tortured analysis of the Laffer Curve. The Freedom Caucus is wise enough to recognize that not only are the figures and statistics leading to that conclusion highly questionable, but Americans will never live to see the results of such a balancing even if it were to occur. People—rightfully so— are not patient when their wallets get thinner due to preventable government incompetence.\n\nGary Palmer is not only a good and honorable conservative, but he is a shrewd politician. He understands the way that GOP voters think and react, while understanding that appealing across the aisle is largely a waste of time and political capital. We need more Republicans like him in Washington—pragmatic, wise, and savvy. I would humbly recommend to Paul Ryan that he hit the recruiting trail like Nick Saban… Get us more Gary Palmers!\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce, members of my staff, for their help in writing, editing, and researching this article.

Both plan to attend law school in 2019.\n\nYet again, the old political order is being disturbed by the pesky grassroots that simply refuse to go away. This time, the culprit is a young, charming Missouri firebrand named Austin Petersen. Petersen burst onto the political scene when he nearly pulled off what would have been considered the biggest electoral upset of 2016—defeating Gary Johnson for the Libertarian Party’s Presidential nomination. He is now running for Senate in Missouri as a Republican with hopes of ousting incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill. While his betrayal of the third-party outsiders infuriated some, Peterson hopes the Republican party will afford liberty a greater platform and an opportunity to unseat an establishment Democrat accused of being too cozy with Obama and Clinton.\n\nAt the start of his 2016 campaign, Gary Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, had been criticized for years on his switch to the Libertarian Party. He proceeded to play into every Libertarian stereotype one could think of, whether wagging his tongue like a crazed dog on national television or making any of a series of cringe-worthy gaffes. In addition to his many foibles, Johnson had a fatal flaw that would doom his Libertarian candidacy—he wasn’t terribly Libertarian. He supported carbon taxes, opposed freedom of association, and generally found himself on the wrong side of every Libertarian issue. Petersen, a true champion for liberty, gave him a much-needed challenge.\n\nPetersen did not take the traditional route to political prominence. As it says in big, bold letters at the top of his campaign website, he was “Born in Independence and raised in Peculiar—near a town called Liberty.” He did not attend an ivy league university or enjoy a top tier law school education. He attended Missouri State University, where he graduated with a degree in musical theatre. You will not find think tanks or judicial clerkships on his resume, as he opted instead for modeling and demonstrating at the famed New York toy store FAO Schwartz. While working there, he even appeared in a Late Night with Conan O’Brien sketch.\n\nLater, Peterson delved into politics, working for the Libertarian National Committee and the Atlas Network, in addition to the Ron Paul campaigns for President in 2008 and 2012. He moved from there into television, working as an associate producer for the Fox Business program Freedom Watch with Judge Napolitano. He then worked as director of production at the advocacy group, FreedomWorks. In addition to running for Senate, Petersen is the owner and CEO of a photo and video consulting firm called Stonegait LLC, named after the family farm, and is founder of The Libertarian Republic and Liberty Viral—libertarian news and commentary websites. So really, he is just your everyday musical theater buff turned model, turned operative, turned TV producer, turned media consultant, turned Senate candidate.\n\nPeterson has gained a cult following among lovers of liberty, as he is unafraid to challenge conventional political norms or advocate fiercely for his most deeply-held beliefs. Naturally, his fierce engagement in the time-honored Libertarian tradition of sharing memes and trolling absolutely everyone has earned him the respect of liberty lovers everywhere.\n\nBut now, Peterson has shed the stench of the Libertarian Party and embraced the once-villainous two party system. He now embraces conservative and classically liberal thought leaders like Ben Shapiro and Dave Rubin, while strongly condemning the utter chaos of the Libertarian sideshow. His move to the Republican Party drew the ire of many Libertarians, as doctrinal a group of people as you will find who lack a central doctrine. Some accused him of selling out, others of abandoning his lifelong principles. These same people accuse Rand Paul of being a closet statist, but are happy to cast a vote for interventionist and anti-gun Bill Weld, former governor of Massachusetts. In other words, the dogmatic hardliners who demonize anyone who blindly tows the party line are often willing to sacrifice a great number of their own principles in order to blindly tow the party line.\n\nAustin Petersen has done an extraordinary job of exposing hypocrisy while maintaining his own dignity and integrity. His decision to leave the circus sideshow disguised as a functioning political party in order to give liberty a greater platform was one that he knew would be met with controversy and indignation, but ultimately was the only decision that could be made for the greater good—the advancement and diffusion of liberty.\n\nIn a deeply red state like Missouri, Peterson might just have a chance, even against an incumbent Democrat. McCaskill is sure to have the full support of the DNC, which sees 2018 as an opportunity seize Congressional control from stagnant Republicans. However, in today’s political climate – where voters seem to be fed up with the bickering and lackadaisicalness in both parties – former Libertarians like Peterson have their best shot in years to rule the day.\n\nSpecial thanks to Nick Briscoe and Daniel Bruce for their help in writing, editing, and researching this article.

In a furious tweet, Trump publicly denounced Sessions’ decision not to unleash the power of the Justice Department on the president’s enemies, calling the attorney general \"Disgraceful!\"\n\nWhile Sessions has traditionally remained silent on such criticism, he stood his ground in the midst of Trump’s latest tirade responding, \"As long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\"\n\nSessions should be applauded for standing up to his boss, who in this case acts more like a 71-year-old child rather than the leader of the free world. In fact, one must go back to some of the Founders to find a sitting president launching a public attack against members of his own cabinet. Perhaps most notably, John Adams was known for a fuming temper, one often wielding its head against members of his own party — such as his Secretary of War James McHenry and former Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.\n\nConsequently, Adams’ quickness to burn his bridges cost him a second term — a fair warning for any attempt by Trump to start a cabinet war in Washington, D.C.\n\nHowever, Jeff Sessions’ stand reflects much more than the consequences of childish inter-office bickering; it’s a stand for the sovereignty of American constitutional law. The U.S. Constitution gives the president the sole power to pick the members of his cabinet, and there is a long-standing adage that cabinet members \"serve at the pleasure of the president.\" However, the Framers also ensured that the people had an ability to check the president’s appointment power and instilled Congress with the duty of confirming the president’s appointees. Thus, the president chooses his cabinet, and the people — through their duly elected representatives — approve them.\n\nIn the political world, this process is known as the concept of checks and balances. It is an integral aspect of the Framers’ vision of a constitutional republic. It also puts cabinet officials in the sometimes unfortunate position of serving as an extension of the president, while acting on behalf of the people.\n\nIn Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ case, Trump has repeatedly given him the choice to follow the law that he has sworn to protect or cave to the political pressures of his hot-tempered boss. If the U.S. attorney general — the chief law enforcer — becomes merely a pawn of the president, we become a nation ruled by the passions of men rather than the timelessness of law. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has its first loyalty to the rule of law and we must never politicize prosecutions. By doing so, we chip away at the things and ideals separating our country from places like Venezuela and Russia.\n\nIt is this timelessness that has allowed the U.S. to peacefully transition power to different figures and parties for over 200 years — without conflict.\n\nSessions has received some support from his colleagues in the legislature but many elected leaders in my state of Alabama have failed to defend the good name of their friend of 20 years!\n\nSome have told me that they can’t defend sessions because if they say anything against Trump it may hurt them in the primary and to them I say you don’t deserve to lead anyone.\n\nIf elected leaders aren’t willing to even stand up for their friend of two decades, whom they know personally, then who are they willing to stand up for? These officials not only know Sessions publicly but they know his family as well; their children know one another.\n\nSessions has reached out to them when their family was dealing with tragedy, and they fought for conservative principles together for years. Everyone in my state who knows Sessions doesn’t question him at all. They realize if he is doing something that Trump doesn’t like its only because Sessions will always try and do the right thing no matter what the cost. I am so proud of him for being a man of character. Sadly, a large portion of the Republican party has aligned with the Always-Trumpers, claiming that the attorney general’s sole duty is to do what the president commands — regardless of legality.\n\nIn our polarized culture, it seems that we have forgotten that humans are not infallible. Even ones with whom we agree with the most have their faults.\n\nIt's not treason or betrayal to push back when members of our own party do something wrong. There is no need to make excuses when our leaders let their egos blind them to reality. Instead, we should encourage them to do better.\n\nAfter all, even the president serves at the pleasure of the people.\n\nThis is not all to say that Jefferson Sessions does not have his faults. He does, and I have openly disagreed with him. Yet even in disagreement he has always listened to my concerns and made a thoughtful argument for his viewpoint. I love that about the man.\n\nSessions had to recuse himself from the Russia investigation because there are clear rules which govern this. Sessions even said during confirmation process he would recuse himself. So, Trump knew this, but somehow he blames Sessions? Trump has repeatedly asked his attorney general to defy the law his office is designed to uphold, and Sessions has repeatedly responded with respect — even to the point of submitting his resignation. However, our current attorney general — and the American people — must now show Trump that he is not king; that no one is above the law.\n\nIn closing, I don’t advocate we support the Democrats as a way to push-back in 2018, as we shouldn’t vote for people whose vision we fundamentally oppose.\n\nHowever, if the voters don’t know what we stand for and see us putting any elected member of our party over our principles then we will ensure our defeat in 2018.\n\nLet us praise our president for the things he does well, critiquing him when he goes against our conservative beliefs. We cannot continue to excuse anything he says or does and continue to beleive that we will not be a minority party in 2018. Let’s be fair and reasonable. This way we will win the argument, and the voters will support us in 2018.\n\nNote: Special thanks to Daniel Bruce, a member of my firm, who helped write, research, and edit this piece.

He plans to attend law school when he graduates.\n\nThis article originally appeared on my Newsmax column.\n\nThis August, Paul Ryan will once again face an unorthodox challenger in his Congressional primary in Wisconsin — eccentric businessman Paul Nehlen. The two men have met in a primary once before: in 2016, Ryan trounced Nehlen by nearly 70 points. Despite this loss, Nehlen is at it again, and though his chance of victory is no better, he’s making headlines for his outspoken, radical views.\n\nNehlen is not a politician; he’s an equipment manufacturer who has never held any public office. Normally, a run like Nehlen’s would not be significant enough to garner national coverage. However, Nehlen got some media attention during his last run because of praise from the president, and he’s challenging the most powerful member of Congress. What’s more, it’s rumored that Ryan might be retiring from the House.\n\nThe main explanation for Nehlen’s unlikely place in the public eye is the nationalist, anti-Semitic propaganda that he spews. In recent weeks, he has taken to Twitter and launched vicious attacks toward minorities, especially Jews. Nehlen once observed, “Poop, incest, and pedophilia. Why are those common themes repeated so often with Jews?” He recently tweeted that lawyer Ari Cohn should “fill a Jesus-shaped hole” in his heart, and frequently declares “it’s okay to be white” a popular white supremacist tagline. Nehlen was once a tool of Steve Bannon, but Bannon has since denounced Nehlen’s comments.\n\nUnfortunately, these types of comments from alt-right politicians are not uncommon. It’s concerning that we have almost come to expect this discrimination from members of an increasingly popular political sect. Although most of America sees these views for what they are, backwards, vulgar, and despicable, the media can’t get enough of the alt-right circus. Nehlen, though he is not a serious threat to the seat in any way, has had articles written about him in major publications such as HuffPost, Buzzfeed, The Washington Post, and Vox.\n\nIt’s important to remember that Nehlen and his cohorts, though all over the news, are only at the political fringe. To denounce them is the right thing to do, but we can’t allow the media to be consumed with their stories. Nationwide coverage only adds fuel to their fire, whether it is coverage condemning them or not.\n\nMore likely than not, it’s the media attention that is behind Nehlen acting out. Though he probably does believe in the comments he’s making, to some degree, he no doubt also sees radicalism as a winning political strategy. Nehlen refuses to call himself a white supremacist or a nationalist, perhaps because he doesn’t fully embrace those views. But he would not be getting any attention at all were it not for his outrageous rants. It’s disturbing that some politicians have come to think of demeaning others as a path to victory, and it should not be acceptable by any account.\n\nIt’s especially crucial for the Republican Party to remind Americans that it does not embrace these radicals, and that the views they espouse are not Republican views. Candidates like Nehlen see an opening — the GOP is vulnerable to radical attack because it has failed to unite its voters. These candidates aren’t Republican, they’re power hungry and need a major political party to get them in the door.\n\nNehlen is getting no love from his so-called party, but neither, really, is Ryan. When denouncing Nehlen, and other reprobates like him, Republicans need to flip the script to focus on party positives. In Nehlen’s case, Republicans should be praising Ryan, and rallying around the leadership he has shown and the party values he represents. Criticizing the alt-right isn’t enough; the GOP needs to show that not only are the Nehlens of America not Republicans, but that being Republican means something admirable and worth believing in.\n\nThough Nehlen and the alt-right should not be garnering so much media attention, the GOP needs to use this coverage to its advantage, rather than letting it hurt the party’s reputation. There is media interest in the Republican Party, but right now it’s that people like Nehlen are representing it. If the Republicans can respond to every news story about a nationalist radical with a story about a Republican triumph, they will have a much better chance in 2018 and beyond.\n\nSpecial thanks to Katherine Pickle, My chief law clerk who is a second year law student at Emory, for helping me research, write, and edit this article.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Flickr user Gage Skidmore."
