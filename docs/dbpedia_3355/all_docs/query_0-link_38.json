        "text": "Charles Goyette is the Host of \"Ron Paul's America\" radio show. He joins the podcast to give his dramatic solution to prevent the coming financial ruin.\n\nGoyette believes the longstanding practice of crony capitalism strangles our economy. He thinks we need to reign in overseas spending and end American interventionism.\n\nGoyette then explains whether it is fair for younger people to subsidize older people.\n\nNew York Times bestselling author Charles Goyette spent many years as an award-winning and popular Phoenix radio personality. Admired for his \"Fearless Talk Radio,\" Charles was named Best Phoenix Talk Show Host by the New Times. Because of his insistence on holding all poiticians - regardless of party - accountable to the same strict standards, Charles was widely known as “America’s Most Independent Talk Show Host.” His years of experience as a financial professional have served his listeners well as he sounded the alarm about the mortgage bubble well in advance of the calamity and described the consequences of the governments reckless economic behavior in his clear, easy to understand manner.\n\nCharles is no newcomer to the national economic debate. In fact, more than 25 years ago Charles arranged for a then little-known Texas Congressman named Ron Paul to be the keynote speaker at a series of monetary conferences he hosted. Goyette has often been called on to share his views with television audiences nationally on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, PBS, CNBC and Fox Business Channel, including on the Glenn Beck Show and The O’Reilly Factor with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News; NOW with Bill Moyers on PBS; and on Lou Dobbs Tonight on CNN, where he repeatedly warned before the current turmoil the \"economic calamity the Republicans and Democrats\" were creating. He has written for a number of magazines including The American Conservative and Gannett magazines, and for LewRockwell.com, CNBC.com, WorldNetDaily.com, and TheStreet.com."
