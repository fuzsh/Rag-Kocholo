        "text": "Each year, HPU honors 10 outstanding alumni who graduated within the last 10 years. Pictured from left are Kenneth Marshall, Gabrielle Wanek, Molly O’Brien, Tyler Blackshaw, Tyler Heaggans, Michaela Burns, Thomas Langford and Shayla Fletcher. Honored but not pictured are Summer Tonsfeldt and Michaela Mucha.\n\nHIGH POINT, N.C., Nov. 17, 2023 – High Point University recognized outstanding alumni during the 2023 Homecoming Weekend from Nov. 3-5, with thousands of HPU alumni participating in a variety of events on campus.\n\nThe surrounding community benefits from the influx of visitors during HPU’s Homecoming Weekend in addition to sporting events and more, says Melody Burnett, president of Visit High Point.\n\n“HPU Homecoming Weekend continues to grow and make an impact on our local economy,” said Burnett. “The event drew 2,000 attendees, resulting in an estimated economic impact of $470,393. As enrollment grows on campus, so does homecoming, where community businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and retail, enjoy that economic boost each fall.”\n\nOne highlight of the weekend was the annual Alumni Awards, hosted by the Alumni Association. The ceremony honors HPU alumni who have made outstanding accomplishments and demonstrated a commitment to their community and the university.\n\nLifetime Achievement Award – the Honorable William D. “Bill” Goldston Jr., Class of 1947, was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and graduated from Leaksville High School at the age of 16. Encouraged by his parents to seek more education, Goldston enrolled in Oak Ridge Military Academy, working on campus to pay his expenses.\n\nGoldston served in the U.S. Air Force at the end of World War II before entering High Point College in 1945, where he studied Accounting. He was a drum major for the High Point College marching band and tutored another student in American history while he and his wife, Beverly, lived in married student housing.\n\nUpon graduating, Goldston joined his father in the trucking business until his father’s death in 1952. Now with two families to support, Goldston began leasing transfer trucks, using a garage so small the driver had to let air out of the tires and take off the exhaust stack to get the truck through the door. Nevertheless, Goldston inspired confidence and attracted the support of mentors who helped him. An early customer was businessman Luther Hodges, who later became governor of North Carolina and gave Goldston’s company the necessary permits to become North Carolina’s first statewide trucking company.\n\nGoldston sold Goldston, Inc. to Daniel Construction in 1972, remaining in charge while the company grew into a national firm with 26 terminals. When Fluor International acquired Daniel in 1977, Goldston served on Fluor’s management team until 1983.\n\nGoldston was an active community leader in Eden and Rockingham County. He served as president of Morehead Memorial Hospital’s Board of Trustees, was president of the local Rotary Club, and served nine years on the local school board. He was Eden Jaycees Boss of the Year in 1970 and North Carolina Boss of the Year in 1971.\n\nAfter retiring from Fluor, Goldston was elected to the N.C. Senate in 1984. In his eight years of service, Goldston led efforts to reform the state budget process and enact the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund, which created dedicated funding to bring a four-lane road within 10 miles of every county seat. In the 1990s, the governor asked Goldston to manage the N.C. State Port in Wilmington, where he made major operational changes, always seeking worker input.\n\nGoldston always nurtured ties to his alma mater, HPU. He has served on the Board of Visitors (now the Board of Ambassadors). In 1995, the Goldstons endowed a scholarship in memory of their deceased son, Richard. Before Beverly died in 2016, the Goldstons also joined the Sterling Society by making provision for HPU in their financial plans. Because of his enduring achievements in business, service to the state of North Carolina, and steadfast presence as a proud alumnus, Goldston was presented with the 2023 Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nAlumnus of the Year Award – Levan Z. Seperteladze, Class of 1995, grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the former Soviet Union. He came to the United States in 1993, and earned a Presidential Scholarship at High Point University, where he received an undergraduate degree in business administration in 2015, and a graduate degree in international management.\n\nAfter HPU, Seperteladze found consistent success in the automotive sales industry, having successfully managed dealerships over a 16-year career representing Volvo, Nissan, Toyota, GM and Honda. While managing Van York Toyota in High Point, Seperteladze earned the Prestigious President’s Award on nine separate occasions.\n\nSeperteladze began managing his own investments and trade stocks, futures and options, eventually leaving the car business to pursue trading as his full-time business. In 2021, he received the coveted Certificate of Achievement for finishing fourth place in the United States Investing Championship, a real money verified competition that gives up-and-coming traders an opportunity to showcase their talent on the world stage. In 2023, Seperteladze continued to move his trading career forward and launched his own hedge fund, Disciples Capital.\n\nThrough each of these successes, Seperteladze has remained committed to the success of his alma mater. In 2021, he joined the HPU Board of Ambassadors, and continues to provide leadership level philanthropic support each year to further the work of the HPU Center for Community Engagement and Bonner Leader program.\n\nSeperteladze married the former Elizabeth Anne Barger, who is also an HPU graduate from the Class of 1999. They are active in their church, Hope City in Wallburg, North Carolina, and have three daughters: Natalie, Catherine and Anna. In gratitude for his generosity, professional success and constant advocacy for High Point University, Seperteladze was recognized as the 2023 Alumnus of the Year.\n\nPresident’s Award – Richard W. and Toye Payne, Class of 1975, are mentors, friends and a constant source of inspiration for many in the High Point and HPU community.\n\nToye graduated from High Point College in 1975, with a major in Mathematics. In 1976, she joined the certified public accounting firm Dixon Hughes Goodman, which would eventually become Forvis, a Top 10 accounting firm in the country. She became a partner of the company in 1985 and continued her professional career as a CPA until her retirement in 2010.\n\nRichard served in the U.S. Navy, is a 1972 graduate of Pfeiffer College in Misenheimer, North Carolina, and a 1999 graduate of Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, with his Master of Divinity. As an ordained minister, he serves as the Team Chaplain for Richard Childress Racing, where he is responsible for the spiritual needs of the racing team’s 450 employees.\n\nPrior to his work in racing, Richard recruited, trained and implemented outreach programs in prisons throughout the United States as national director for Prison Fellowship ministries, and director of Feed My Sheep ministry in High Point.\n\nSince 1998 Toye and Richard have owned Quail Creek Farm, where they raise Angus cattle, donkeys, hens and have 16 honeybee hives. The Paynes have also continually served their local communities and given back through volunteering and leadership roles across a variety of organizations.\n\nToye is a member of the American Institute of CPAs and remains involved in the civic life of her community, having held board positions for the Rotary Club of the Triad, Hospice of the Piedmont, American Red Cross, High Point Community Theater, the String and Splinter, Furnitureland Antique Auto Club and High Point Central Alumni Association. She also volunteers annually in the internal audit department of Samaritan’s Purse, an international aid organization, specifically working on the internal audits for their Operation Christmas Child shoebox distribution project, helping deserving children all around the world.\n\nOver the years, Richard has served in volunteer and leadership positions of the Billy Graham Emergency Response Team, Motor Racing Outreach, the Horneytown Volunteer Fire Department Board, Childress Institute Board and the Furnitureland Antique Auto Club.\n\nAt HPU, Toye and Richard are members of the Panther Club, and Toye has been a long-time member of the Steel Magnolias, and the Alumni Board. Richard has served since 2009 as the volunteer sports chaplain for the HPU varsity athletic teams, and recently as director of the HPU Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\nTheir generosity to HPU is felt in many areas, from athletics to scholarship programs and as members of the Sterling Society. Richard and Toye have made plans for two scholarships to be established in their name to support accounting students and student-athletes at HPU.\n\nEach year, HPU also honors 10 young alumni who graduated within the last 10 years. This year’s Top 10 Under 10 are:\n\nTyler O. Heaggans, Class of 2013, earned his bachelor’s degree in finance and accounting, completed his master’s degree in information technology at N.C.

He has served as president of the Young Alumni Council, mentored students within the Phillips School of Business and contributed to alumni panels for various events. Professionally, Heaggans has worked for notable industry leaders, such as Credit Suisse, Target and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Currently, he works as director of Sales Data Strategy at Compass Group in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThomas G. Langford, Class of 2014, earned a degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics. While at HPU, Langford presented research at multiple conferences, including the Mid-Southeast Association for Computer Machinery Conference, and the Big South Undergraduate Research Symposium.
