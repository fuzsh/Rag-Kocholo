        "text": "You have to think that none of this would have happened had John McCain still been living.\n\nIt's been one week since SB 1070 became the law in Arizona, and now 30 percent of the state's population has been relegated to the status of second-class citizens, and are open to harassment and arrest, all in a horribly misguided effort to crack down on illegal immigration. (And this 30 percent doesn't include any Latino or otherwise dark-skinned person who just happens to be in Arizona, for whatever reason one might be in Arizona — in an open society, one is theoretically free to roam, without being asked for one's \"papers.\")\n\nCertainly illegal immigration is a long-standing problem, and that can't be discounted. And it's a problem over which good people can disagree. But it's impossible to see how this bill could have gone through the committee process and been debated and passed in both houses of the legislature and considered by the governor's counsel and signed by the governor without anyone realizing that one inescapable feature of this new law is that all brown people in the state would now automatically be suspects for a crime that they did not commit, and that the police would be required to harass them without any cause but their skin color, having been granted and compelled by new, open-ended police powers to stop and interrogate any person they \"suspected\" of being in the state illegally. This just happened, in 2010. Imagine if the demographic situation were reversed, and Mexico were predominantly populated by fair-skinned people who look like J.D. Hayworth, and such a law were passed by a majority-Latino state government to crack down on the white menace pouring across the border. Thought of this way, perhaps the discrimination this law engenders — requires would be more plain to its unthinking sponsors. (Come to think of it, maybe a law criminalizing J.D. Hayworth is not such a bad idea.)\n\nOf course, by contemporary standards, we are all in this country illegally. And we have a fine tradition of immigrant demonization in America, with spasms of bashing such as the one we're living through presently coming once each generation or so. What could be done to solve this problem? People on both sides of this argument point to the failure of the federal government to enact comprehensive immigration reform as the reason such a reactionary law even became possible.\n\nBut once upon a time, all the way back in 2005, Senator John McCain of Arizona teamed with Ted Kennedy to write just such a comprehensive immigration-reform bill that would have obviated the atrocious new Arizona law. But then John McCain ran for president and tacked hard to the worst nativist elements of his party and he got amnesia and disavowed the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill as if he had no idea who that other McCain fellow with his name on the bill even was. If only that old John McCain were still alive and in his right mind, that immigration bill that bore his name would have had a real chance of passage, and if that old John McCain had still been of influence in his state, maybe he could have said something reasonable to effect the debate on immigration going on in Phoenix, where the leadership class seems to have gone batshit crazy.\n\nBut in times like these, the truly brave show themselves. There must be something in the water in Tucson, because a couple days ago the Pima County sheriff, a crusty old white guy named Clarence Dupnik, said he had no intention of enforcing the law, calling it \"racist\" and \"disgusting.\" And the Tucson native and congressman, Raul Grijalva, last week called for an economic boycott of his own state, in order to put the issue in terms the more reactionary forces in Arizona might understand — the bottom line. Grijalva is pressing his boycott aggressively, and has also asked the White House to refuse federal cooperation in the enforcement of the law.\n\nI spoke to Congressman Grijalva yesterday:\n\nESQUIRE: Congressman Grijalva, how has passage of this new state law galvanized Latinos?\n\nCongressman Raul Grijalva: Profoundly. This is something we've been warning about for a long, long time. That is, the Federal government, i.e. Congress and [the] administration, did not move on immigration reform, shift the debate to a national debate. That you were going to let, you know, in our state the very extremist individuals that run the state to begin to dictate that. We saw in Arizona Sheriff Arpaio's mentality begin to take over, Russell Pierce's mentality begin to take over, and they were defining the immigration debate. And we were always reacting to their craziness defensively, those of us who were pro-comprehensive reform. Now we find ourselves in this catch-22 where the state has done it and now we need to react to it. We need to overturn it, number one, and number two, continue the pressure for a national agenda on immigration reform.\n\nSo, what has it done for the Latino community? It is the sense of urgency, and more importantly the sense that you're under siege, regardless of whether you are undocumented or not. All of a sudden, this has become a racial issue and not just an immigration issue. That was always underlining the debate, but now it's up front and center. And I think that's unified so many people to resist that.\n\nESQ: Congressman, yesterday Bill Clinton says he doesn't like the law but gets why it happened. Do you understand the political and social conditions that made SB1070 possible?\n\nRG: Yeah, absolutely. The frustration, the sense of insecurity. That kind of tension is there, it's been in Arizona, in the sense that nothing's being done about their insecurity. But there's also another underlining reason, and that's a more dangerous motivation that President Clinton should be aware of, too. The threat of \"Who are these people? Why are there so many of them? Why are they here taking my job?\" This does not just extend to immigrants. It extends to the Latino population in general. And that unseemly attitude, for lack of a better word, is part of the motivation. And you can't ignore that in this debate, that there is a racial component to this debate. And so while I see that and understand and know that's part of the debate, I certainly don't appreciate it and I certainly don't condone it. So we're going to confront that, because now, with 1070, that part of the debate is front and center.\n\nESQ: Congressman, it's funny, I grew up in south Texas, with Latinos whose families had been there for eight generations, much longer than my family, yet under this law they could be suspects.\n\nRG: In Southern Arizona, there are plenty [of families] like that. The Alia family has been there for ten generations. But they are all subject to the mandate: You better have your papers with you, and if you don't you're subject to arrest.\n\nESQ: What kind of relationship do you have to the people who passed this?\n\nRG: None. And I say that not because I don't want to. But publicly I have to be their adversary. So when they're talking about whether it was Prop 200, that teachers should turn kids in if they think they're undocumented, to, you know, I have to publicly say no and debate 'em. So there was — it's hard to find a middle ground.\n\nESQ: I read one Republican who voted for it saying he was rueful he had done so, saying that \"We're gonna be like Alabama in the '60s,\" but he was afraid to vote against it. Have any of the supporters of the law shown any willingness to work with you to change it?\n\nRG: Well, I hope so. I think the man who made that comment, there was a couple who made that comment. I think there was a state rep out of the Yuma sector that said \"I voted for it but I didn't want to.\" Yeah, what's left of the moderate wing of the Republican Party in Arizona — they were more than willing to sit down and deal with this law.\n\nESQ: Congressman, what response have you gotten from the White House regarding your letter to the president last week?\n\nRG: Well, I think the responses have been the public comments by Attorney General Holder, by the President, and the review that is ongoing on the supremacy clause, and the potential civil rights issues. On the noncooperation issue, we haven't heard anything.\n\nESQ: So what happens now here? What's the legal strategy?\n\nRG: The legal strategy is, groups are going to go after it. MALDEF [Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund], ACLU, et cetera. What would be a powerful tool in this is the Department of Justice. That would put immediacy on it, urgency, and the resource support for it. So we're hoping that they join in this battle, and not only join but become the lead in challenging the constitutionality of it. That's what we're waiting for. That part of the legal strategy is essential.\n\nThe consequences strategy [is this]: as soon as this law was coming, and I was convinced that the governor was going to sign it, I began thinking about nationalizing this issue and not just leaving it a little problem with Arizona, and \"They're weird anyway, so what the heck?\" So we talked about the targeted sanctions. Don't bring your conventions here. Don't bring your conferences here. And there's been good response to that. And other groups are gonna be in charge of that.\n\nAnd just nationalizing it, making sure that the rest of the country understands the Pandora's box that's being opened here. I was doing an online response with the [Washington] Post, and somebody wrote, the question was \"I grew up in Latin America, I speak Spanish fluently, love the music, love the culture, but I support the law. Therefore am I a racist?\" And my online response was, \"I'm glad you like the music. Second, no, I don't think you're a racist. But I do think that as an American citizen you should be very concerned about passing a law that fundamentally violates the Constitution. As a Constitutionalist you should be very, very concerned about it.\" So it's two levels. It's the racial affront and then there's the constitutional issue. This is — we already fought Jim Crow. We don't need to fight that again.\n\nESQ: The invitation to unlimited police power is really something [and explains why the police groups in Arizona opposed passage of this law]. Congressman, can you tell me about the process of the boycott strategy — how it came about and when?\n\nRG: It happened — we started talking about it when [the bill] went to her [Governor Jan Brewer's] desk.\n\nESQ: Just in your office, among your staff?\n\nRG: Yeah, and folks back home. We really didn't deal with a lot of national people, colleagues, because it had to come from Arizona. It couldn't come from outside. And we assessed the heat we were going to get — and we're getting plenty — the consequences. But that was outweighed by the fact that we felt this would put a huge light on Arizona and that there would be a real response. The response I think is minuscule — if a couple of conventions don't go to Phoenix, the economic loss would be minuscule compared to the damage inflicted by the governor signing this legislation. She took Arizona into a deeper economic hole than it is already in. The money that's going to be lost, independent of any boycott, from Mexico alone in terms of consumers, retail sales, tax revenue, is tremendous. That fact that truckers are now going to use Tijuana and Laredo as the entry point for their imports — tremendous loss for this state. And, you know, the immigrant community that pays about $700 million in taxes to the state of Arizona and is responsible for about $10 billion of the economy of the state — that's going to be severely damaged. So whatever the symbolism of \"Don't come to this state\" produces politically would be great, but the real damage was done when this bill was enacted.\n\nESQ: You would say this is not the time for conciliation, this is the time for resistance.\n\nRG: Absolutely. I think right now, if you fight this thing around the edges, you're never going to win. It has to be confronted and overturned. And the last agenda is political, and that is a lengthier process, but eventually it'll change the power structure in the state.\n\nESQ: I know you've gotten threats. How are you responding to them?\n\nRG: Capitol Police, FBI, U.S. Marshals. They've been terrific. Usually we ignore these. Most of the threats I get have to do with my ethnicity so we kind of consider that as just crazy stuff, but these last few days, beginning last Friday, they became much more serious, much more threatening, so we took the advice of the police. The precaution was to close our office for a day, institute different security procedures, be more careful. And it's just — I personally think it's idle threats, but in these things I think for the sake of everybody, you err on the side of caution.\n\nESQ: This effort is not going to go away any time soon."
