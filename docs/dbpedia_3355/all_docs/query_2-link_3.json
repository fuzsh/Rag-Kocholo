        "text": "Orlando Henry \"Tubby\" Smith (born June 30, 1951) is an American college basketball coach. He was recently hired as the men's basketball coach at High Point University, his alma mater. Smith previously served in the same role at the University of Tulsa, the University of Georgia, the University of Kentucky, the University of Minnesota, Texas Tech University, and the University of Memphis. With Kentucky, he coached the Wildcats to the 1998 NCAA championship. In his 28 years as a head coach, Smith has achieved 26 winning seasons. In 2005, he joined Roy Williams, Nolan Richardson, Denny Crum, and Jim Boeheim as the only head coaches to win 365 games in 15 seasons or fewer. With Texas Tech's invitation to the 2016 NCAA Tournament, Smith became only the second coach in history to lead five different teams to the NCAA tournament.Smith's three sons are following in their father's coaching footsteps. G.G. Smith, who played for his father at the University of Georgia, was formerly the head coach at Loyola (Md), and is currently the associate head coach at High Point. His middle son Saul Smith played for his father at the University of Kentucky and was an assistant coach for his father at Memphis. Brian, his youngest son, was a point guard at Ole Miss and is the head coach at Saint John Paul II Academy in Boca Raton, Florida.\n\nDonna Fargo (born Yvonne Vaughn, November 10, 1945, in Mount Airy, North Carolina) is an American country singer-songwriter, who is best known for a series of Top 10 country hits in the 1970s. These include \"The Happiest Girl in the Whole USA\" and \"Funny Face,\" both which became crossover pop hits. The former in 1972, and the latter in 1973.Fargo has won major awards since her debut in the late 1960s, including one Grammy Award, five awards from the Academy of Country Music and one award from the Country Music Association.\n\nJacklyn Harrell \"Jack\" Lucas (February 14, 1928 â€“ June 5, 2008) was an American Marine in World War II who was awarded the Medal of Honor at the age of 17 years as a private first class in the Marine Corps during the Battle of Iwo Jima. During a close firefight in two trenches between Lucas and three Marines with 11 Japanese soldiers, Lucas saved the lives of the other three Marines from two enemy hand grenades that were thrown into their trench by unhesitatingly placing himself on one grenade, while in the next instant pulling the other grenade under him. The grenade he covered with his body exploded, and wounded him severely; the other grenade did not explode. He is the youngest Marine and the youngest serviceman in World War II to be awarded the United States' highest military decoration for valor. He later reenlisted in the United States Army and reached the rank of captain.\n\nRobert Martin (born January 6, 1973), better known by his nickname \"50\", is a streetball player whose fame rose during his years on the AND1 Mixtape Tour. He is 6'8\" tall and weighs 210 lbs. He was given the name \"50\" because people said he has a 50-inch vertical jump. Martin, born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, graduated from Tri-Cities High School in 1991. He attended Middle Georgia College from 1991 to 1993 before transferring to High Point College (now High Point University). In 1995, he joined the Atlanta Trojans of the USBL. From 1995 to 1998 he played in Europe, then in 1998 he played for the Rochester Skeeters of the IBA. In 2001, Martin was offered on a spot on the AND1 Tour. Martin is the cousin of NBA player Kenyon Martin."
