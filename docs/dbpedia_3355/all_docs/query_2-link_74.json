Her mother’s family provided her with a deep love of the blues, jazz, and soul, particularly those seminal women of the jazz era like Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Sara Vaughn, and of course Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nHer passion for making music however, did not manifest itself more formally until she Joined her college a capella group, The Tigerlilies, providing her with many opportunities to sink into a mean base line as a second alto, and grow her confidence to even step out of the shadows and make her own individual voice known.\n\nAfter college, singing took a backseat to other creative endeavors like spoken word, although performance always remained at the center.

Noah is currently performing throughout the triangle and beyond with units of his choosing\n\nDiana Tuffin\n\nDiana’s musical journey has landed her in front of a most prolific composer, arranger, piano accompanist and vocal coach, Mr. Norman Simmons, who was the power driver behind the likes of Joe Williams, Carmen McCrae, Sarah Vaughn, Betty Carter, Anita O’Day, Dakota Staton and now Diana.

There were very few car rides with her dad and sister, or family get togethers that did not involve the joyful rising up of voices in tight familial harmonies. Her mother’s family provided her with a deep love of the blues, jazz, and soul, particularly those seminal women of the jazz era like Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, Sara Vaughn, and of course Ella Fitzgerald. Her passion for making music however, did not manifest itself more formally until she Joined her college a capella group, The Tigerlilies, providing her with many opportunities to sink into a mean base line as a second alto, and grow her confidence to even step out of the shadows and make her own individual voice known.\n\nAfter college, singing took a backseat to other creative endeavors like spoken word, although performance always remained at the center. It was only when she joined her 9-year-old son on the stage in a musical, that Lalenja reconnected with her own love of singing beyond family functions. That first production opened the flood gates, and since then she has enjoyed a number of lead roles in local productions like Rent, Children of Eden, Born Bad, and her most challenging musical role as Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill.

The multivoiced Powell is capable of radical, off-the-cuff reworkings of whatever he sings, abruptly changing tempos and dynamics, or rearranging the lyrics into distinctive, off-the-beat rhythmic patterns. He can scat at lightning speed, or drive home an emotion with wordless, vocal gestures . Yet as much as Noah Powell is fascinated by pure, abstract sound, he is also a sensitive lyric interpreter of the ballad when he chooses. Noah Powell is a native of Kinston NC and a graduate of North Carolina Central University (1983). As a working musician he has collaborated with some of the finest musicians in his native North Carolina. From 1984-86 Noah worked with Chip Crawford and in 1985 he replaced Nina Freelon as the vocalist for the William McLaughlin quartet later to be renamed Mastertrax.

She spent years honing her technique in Los Angeles and New York City, where she moved in 1994, and instantly bonded with trumpet legend Doc Cheatham, “the first musician I played with in New York.” Attending one of his regular Sunday brunch performance’s at Sweet Basil, her husband convinced pianist Chuck Folds to let Partridge sit in. Her version of “Every Day I Have the Blues” went over well and Cheatham told her “You can come anytime you want,” Partridge recalls. “After that, I sat in regularly and we did some gigs together. I learned so much from him musically, just seeing the obsessive dedication he had. He was a real inspiration.” Partridge released her debut I’ll Be Easy to Find in 1998, a widely acclaimed album (“She’s a pleasure to hear in any emotional guise, whether one of regret or exaltation”—Billboard) featuring veteran jazz greats like Frank Wess, Bucky Pizzarelli, and Gene Bertoncini. She has grown exponentially with each new recording: Blame It on My Youth, 2004; You Are There, Songs for My Father, 2006; Perspective, 2010; and the long-awaited I Never Thought I’d Be Here, 2015 (“Ms. Partridge consistentlystretches both herself and the music. It would not be surprising if a few of her songs became standards in the future”). And now Bright Lights & Promises: Redefining Janis Ian captures an artist fully in command of her craft. Surrounded by an enviably sympathetic cast of collaborators, Partridge has expanded the possibilities for fellow vocalists, bringing the work of an American original firmly into the jazz fold.\n\nLori Williams Acclaimed international Jazz vocalist Lori Williams has a most impressive resume as a performing artist, music educator, songwriter, producer, musical theater actress, radio voice announcer, business owner (PositiveMusicPM.org), and artist-in-residence with over 30 years of experience.

Featured on VH1’s Top 20 Countdown, a portion of the EP goes directly to NextAid, where the proceeds are helping build a community center in the slums of Nairobi. Change follows previously released Always and Second Chances. The albums were recorded during breaks from his touring and recording schedule with multi-platinum and award winning rock band Daughtry, of which he was a member from 2007-2010. Beyond writing his own music, Joey uses his talents to produce music for other artists on the Nascent Republic label and beyond. Joey’s abilities are becoming more widely known around the world, as he was chosen to be sponsored by Vic Firth drumsticks and Paul Reed Smith guitars. He is also a featured artist on Matchless Music, an independent music placement company, and has songs in rotation on iHeartRadio’s New! Uncover and Discover station. Joey’s music was also chosen by Pandora Internet Radio to have its own station. In addition, his albums can be found on over 40,000 TouchTunes jukeboxes across the country.

People dig that.” He concedes that he has no problem getting onstage and bleeding for hours during a performance.
