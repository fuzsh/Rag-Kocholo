        "text": "NASCAR\n\nDenny Hamlin and Michael Jordan have created a new racing team, 23XI Racing, which will feature Bubba Wallace in the NASCAR Cup Series. They announced plans to build the team headquarters in Huntersville. The mixed-use project will include commercial space, 300 apartments, a hotel and flex space.\n\nThe Lake Norman area is home to an abundance of NASCAR drivers as it's close to Charlotte, the home of racing. There are many drivers that currently live or have lived on or around the lake. Brad Keselowski is no stranger to the area as he's even held an autograph session at the Galway Hooker Irish Pub.\n\nDale Earnhart Jr. owns a 200-acre home right outside of Mooresville, which puts the NASCAR star close to the heart of Lake Norman. Other popular names in the racing world like Justin Haley, Tony Stewart, and reigning Cup Series champion Kyle Busch have lived on Lake Norman.\n\nYou might have seen Michael Waltrip on Season 19 of Dancing with the Stars, but you can catch him around the lake as well. The Joe Gibbs Racing Fan Fest happens the Friday before the Fall races where you can get autographs from the JGR team. Other notable drivers that have been seen around the area include Kasey Kahne, Danica Patrick, Rusty Wallace, Joey Logano, and Chris Buescher. You never know, you might happen to pull up beside them at a stoplight!\n\nCareful What You Wish For (2016) featuring Nick Jonas, is another movie filmed in the area. Fans spotted him in several different restaurants around Birkdale Village. He frequented Bad Daddy's Burger Bar so often, they even offered a Slick Nick Burger for a limited time! In case you were wondering, the delicious turkey burger came on a whole wheat bun with Monterey Jack Cheese, Jalapeno Bacon, Fried Egg, lettuce, and pickles. The Lakefront Bargain Hunt airs on HGTV and features episodes on Lake Norman during Season 3 Ep. 2 and Season 10 Ep. 12.\n\nThe Today Show on NBC did a special following meteorologist Dylan Driver last year on her vacation here in Lake Norman. While staying in Lake Norman, they enjoyed the beautiful area and enjoyed a boat ride with some tubing with Captain Matt from Carolina Cruising Charters. Dylan Driver continuously bragged about the fantastic beauty this area has to offer! Carolina Cruising Charters was also featured on both Jersey Shore Family Vacation and Netflix's Formula 1 series: Drive to Survive.\n\nParty Pontoon Featured on F1: Drive to Survive\n\nFootball\n\nFormer West Virginia Mountaineers and former Carolina Panthers QB Will Grier, and his brothers, Nash and Hayes, all grew up in the town of Davidson. Nash and Hayes Grier were one of the most popular \"Viners\" just a few years ago! Other popular names include the legendary NFL coach, Marty Schottenheimer who's a homeowner on Lake Norman, and the late Reggie White who passed away in his home in the Peninsula in Cornelius.\n\nNew and upcoming star, Drake Maye, is a talented American football quarterback who gained attention for his impressive performances in high school at both William A. Hough High School and Myers Park. He then went on to play for the North Carolina Tar Heels in college, showcasing strong passing abilities and leadership on the field. Known for his accuracy and arm strength, Maye has been a promising prospect in football circles. This past April, Maye was picked for the NFL draft to join the New England Patriots which marked a new chapter in his football career.\n\nNotable Appearances\n\nReese Witherspoon and Emma Roberts have both ate at the nationally renowned, Kindred Restaurant. Witherspoon happened to be in Charlotte for a book tour and had to try Kindred! You might say she's getting pretty familiar with Davidson as she even posted a photo of her reading local Davidson author Megan Miranda's book, The Last Guest House. Miranda's book was selected as the book of the month for Witherspoon's Book Club!\n\nMain Street Books hosts many authors each year during book tours which gives avid readers a chance to meet & greet them. Some even come out with autographed books. Davidson College has brought along several notable guest speakers including Susan Rice, former United Nations Ambassador and National Security Adviser to Former President Obama.\n\nRenee Rapp\n\nA native of the town of Huntersville quickly became a popular figure in the entertainment industry. Renee Rapp attended Hopewell High School and North West School of the Arts, where she was an active member of the school's theater programs. Renee won Best Performance at the 2018 Jimmy Award by an Actress, representing The Blumey Awards. She soon began to gain recognition for her compelling voice, leading her to Broadway where she was cast as Regina George in Mean Girls the Musical. She is now known as a promising new voice in the pop music industry with her Album Snow Angel being rated 44 on US Billboard's Top 200."
