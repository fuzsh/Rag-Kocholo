        "text": "Furniture Shopping in Hickory, High Point & Beyond\n\nBefore earning its reputation as the world's go-to furniture shopping destination, North Carolina’s presence in the furniture industry began in the 1890s with just six furniture plants. Since then, the industry has expanded in many ways, and today many of the world’s foremost names in furniture call North Carolina home.\n\nIf you’re looking for top-quality handcrafted furnishings at bargain prices, the concentration of factories, outlet stores and craftspeople make North Carolina (especially around Hickory and High Point) the ultimate furniture shopping destination. Here are some places to consider for your furniture-shopping excursion. Plus, be sure to check the visitors centers in Hickory, High Point and beyond for great “shop-and-stay” specials.\n\nPlan Your Visit"
