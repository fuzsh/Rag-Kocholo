        "text": "Citizens who helped shape the city and the region\n\nWho built Wilmington? Who made it what it is today?\n\nAt the StarNews, celebrating our newspaper's 150th anniversary this year, we've been thinking a lot about our community's past.\n\nWilmington and the Lower Cape Fear were home to a lot of famous people: David Brinkley, Michael Jordan, Charlie Daniels, Meadowlark Lemon, Roman Gabriel and Sonny Jurgensen. But they all moved away for their achievements.\n\nWho stayed, or moved here, and did the heavy lifting of changing this community?\n\nWe combed through the area's history and came up with 15 people who helped shape the Cape Fear region over the past 150 years:\n\nJack Barto\n\nIn 12 years as CEO of New Hanover Regional Medical Center, retiring earlier this year, Jack Barto oversaw the completion of the Betty H. Cameron Womens' and Children's Hospital and a new surgical pavilion, as well as major renovations to the emergency department and the Zimmer Cancer Center.\n\nBeyond that, Dick McGraw, chairman of the center's board of trustees, credited Barto with creating a climate of teamwork and inculcating a \"patient-first\" philosophy. Patient mortality rates declined on his watch.\n\n\"There was a time when many patients went to Duke or UNC hospitals for care,\" McGraw wrote in a tribute. \"Now patients come from Durham and Raleigh to our hospital.\"\n\nHeyward Bellamy\n\nAs superintendent of New Hanover County schools from 1968 to 1981, Bellamy oversaw the most turbulent period in the school system's history, including the closing of all-black Williston High School, court-ordered desegregation and racial violence that climaxed with the “Wilmington Ten” case.\n\nDuring that period, Bellamy was attacked by both sides. Angry black students once shouted him down at a school assembly. The anti-desegregation group Rights of White People demonstrated on his lawn and let the air out of his car’s tires.\n\nYet Bellamy earned respect as a conciliator who tried to treat all sides fairly. “I thought he was outstanding in the midst of our turmoil,\" said Wayne Moore, a student protest leader at the time and a Wilmington Ten member. \"He dealt with it the best way he could.”\n\nBellamy confronted such crises as vandals putting sand in the school buses' gas tanks and the massive destruction of records in the 1971 arson of Hemenway Hall, the school system's headquarters. He set up alternative education programs for students who had been suspended or expelled during the disturbances, and he launched an \"extended day\" program so working students could take high school classes after hours instead of dropping out.\n\nHannah Block\n\nThe first woman elected to the Wilmington City Council and the first women to serve as mayor pro tempore, Hannah Block played a variety of roles in the community.\n\nIn the 1940s, she was the first woman to serve as head lifeguard at Carolina Beach, teaching hundreds of locals to swim through the local Red Cross.\n\nDuring World War II, she recruited dozens of volunteers for the local USO and used her talents as a former cabaret singer to organize entertainments for GIs training in the area. Her multiple efforts earned her the unofficial title “Mrs. World War II Wilmington.”\n\nBlock was active in the pageant scene, organizing the first Azalea Festival coronation in 1948. In 1947, she organized the first Miss North Carolina pageant at Carolina Beach. Over the years, she coached and managed a number of pageant contestants, most notably Maria Beale Fletcher, who became Miss America in 1962.\n\nDan Cameron\n\nWilmington's mayor from 1955 to 1957, Cameron's influence extended well beyond city hall. After the Atlantic Coast Line announced plans to move its headquarters from Wilmington, during his single term, he helped form Wilmington Industrial Development (later the Committee of 100) to recruit new businesses to the region.\n\nOthers have credited him with a major role in convincing General Electric and DuPont to locate major plants near Wilmington. When Corning officials were scouting the area, Cameron and cousin Alex Trask took the team fishing off Masonboro Island. (The Corning plant opened here in 1966.)\n\nWith his brother Bruce, Cameron played a major role in developing Figure Eight Island and other residential and business complexes around the region. He was a major donor to the University of North Carolina Wilmington, to the Community Boys and Girls Club and to Lower Cape Fear Hospice. For many years, he was president of Wilmington TV station WECT.\n\nBen Chavis\n\nA field officer for the United Church of Christ's Commission for Social Justice, Ben Chavis came to Wilmington after black students boycotted New Hanover County over a variety of grievances related to desegregation. Chavis quickly became spokesmen for the students.\n\nIn 1972, he, eight black students and a white social worker were convicted of arson and conspiracy to fire on law enforcement officers in connection with the burning of a neighborhood grocery. The resulting controversy over the \"Wilmington Ten\" and questions about their prosecutions led to an eight-year campaign to clear the group. Their sentences were overturned in 1980 by the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2012, Gov. Beverly Perdue gave Chavis and surviving Ten members pardons of innocence.\n\nOrdained in 1980, Chavis went to on serve as executive director of the NAACP and was among the organizers of the 1995 Million Man March.\n\n\"Champ\" Davis\n\nAs president of the Atlantic Coast Line railroad, Champion McDowell \"Champ\" Davis was arguably the most powerful man in Wilmington for decades, heading the city's largest single employer.\n\nDavis joined the railroad as a messenger boy in 1893 and -- except for brief service in the Spanish-American War -- remained with it until his retirement in 1957, serving in almost all business capacities.\n\nAfter his retirement, Davis used his foundation to launch the non-profit Cornelia Nixon Davis nursing home, now The Davis Community in Porters Neck, offering an array of assisted living, nursing care and rehabilitation facilities.\n\nDavis was an early trustee of both Wilmington College (now UNCW) and Cape Fear Technical Institute (now Cape Fear Community College). An Episcopal lay leader, he was finance chairman for the church's National Council from 1946 to 1952.\n\nDino De Laurentiis\n\nThe Italian-born film producer brought the film industry to the Wilmington area in 1983 when his company shot \"Firestarter\" at Orton Plantation and other locations. De Laurentiis liked the area so much, he chose to open a \"mini-major\" film studio in Wilmington and shot some 20 films in Southeastern North Carolina under the rubric \"De Laurentiis Entertainment Group.\"\n\nDEG went bankrupt in 1989, but the studio (now known as EUE Screen Gems) continued to operate, and Wilmington was known for a time as \"Hollywood East.\" De Laurentiis and his wife Martha maintained a house on Wrightsville Beach for many years.\n\nDr. Hubert A. Eaton Sr.\n\nA Wilmington physician, Eaton was a plaintiff or lead complainant in most of the region's major civil rights cases.\n\nIn 1951, he and Dr. Daniel Roane sued New Hanover County under Plessy v. Ferguson, documenting that the county's black schools were manifestly inferior to white schools. In 1964, acting for his daughter, Eaton sued the county again under Brown v. Board of Education, which would lead to the complete desegregation of the county school system.\n\nEaton joined other black doctors in suing for equal staff privileges at the former James Walker Memorial Hospital, and he led efforts to desegregate Wilmington College (now UNCW), the Wilmington YMCA, the Municipal Golf Course and the county library system.\n\nA nationally ranked amateur in the old American Tennis Association, Eaton also served as guardian and mentor to Althea Gibson, while the future tennis star was attending Williston High School. Gibson would go on to win both the women’s Wimbledon title and the U.S. Open in 1957 and 1958.\n\nFred Eshelman\n\nA High Point native, Fred Eshelman turned a one-person pharmaceutical consulting firm into Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) which moved to Wilmington in 1986 and became a global contract research organization, with a payroll of more than 18,000 worldwide, including some 1,500 in the Port City.\n\nPPD's decision to locate its 12-story corporate headquarters building on the Cape Fear River helped ignite a development boom in downtown Wilmington and the city's Northside.\n\nA 1972 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Eshelman has donated more than $130 million dollars to his alma mater, where the school of pharmacy now bears his name. Under his leadership, PPD also endowed the University of North Carolina Wilmington to start a bachelor's degree program in clinical research.\n\nClaude Howell\n\nA Wilmington native who studied under Elisabeth Chant, Claude Howell worked for years as a clerk and secretary with Atlantic Coast Line while studying and honing his skills as an artist. Although he never earned a college degree, he launched the visual arts program at Wilmington College (now UNCW) and taught there for decades, influencing generations of local artists.\n\nHowell's rooms in the Carolina Apartments functioned as a virtual salon for Port City lovers of art and culture. He was instrumental in launching and nurturing St. John's Museum of Art, now the Cameron Art Museum.\n\nA world traveler and raconteur, Howell gave a series of popular commentaries on public radio station WHQR.\n\nHuge MacRae\n\nA mining engineer and developer, Hugh MacRae launched the Tide Water Power Co., the area's first electric utility. To build business for its electric trolley line, he developed suburbs in the Winter Park, Audubon and Oleander communities and built the famous Lumina pavilion at Wrightsville Beach.\n\nMacRae also attracted immigrant farmers to Southeastern North Carolina to farm colonies in Castle Hayne, St. Helena, Delco, Van Eeden and other locations. He experimented with cattle breeding on his farm in Rocky Mount.\n\nMacRae was a key conspirator in the violence of Nov. 10, 1898, which led to the overthrow of Wilmington's biracial elected municipal government. He donated the park that bears his name to New Hanover County, but the bequest specified that the land was for the use of the county's white citizens. During the Depression, however, MacRae worked with former Tuskegee Institution architect Robert R. Taylor on plans to resettle unemployed black urban workers as farmers.\n\nHugh Morton\n\nHugh MacRae's grandson, Hugh Morton inherited Grandfather Mountain from his grandfather and developed it as a major North Carolina tourist attraction.\n\nIn his hometown, however, Morton was the first president of the Azalea Festival in 1948, and his promotional savvy is credited with making it an annual event In 1961, as chairman of the USS North Carolina Battleship Commission, he spearheaded a statewide fundraising campaign to bring the decommissioned World War II battleship to Wilmington as a floating war memorial.\n\nMorton was also famed as a nature photographer; an exhibit of his work is currently on display at the Cape Fear Museum.\n\nTony Rivenbark\n\nA fixture on the Port City stage since his days as a Wilmington College student, Tony Rivenbark has been executive director of what is now the Thalian Hall Center for the Performing Arts since 1977. In that position, he has seen two multi-million dollar renovations to the historic theater.\n\nRivenbark has acted in or directed hundreds of local theater productions. His annual performance as Ebenezer Scrooge is a Port City holiday tradition.\n\nIn 1975 and 1976, Rivenbark was director for \"The Liberty Cart,\" an outdoor historical drama in Duplin County, where he grew up.\n\nJames Sprunt\n\nA former purser on Civil War blockade runners, Sprunt used his proceeds to launch Alexander Sprunt & Sons with his father, a major brokerage in cotton and naval stores (tar, pitch and turpentine). At one point, they were the largest cotton brokers in the world.\n\nSprunt used much of his cotton money to support Presbyterian causes in Wilmington -- a mission station in China was named for him -- and to pay for orthopedic treatments for crippled children. For many years, he was both the British vice consul for Wilmington and the German consul as well.\n\nIn his spare time, Sprunt wrote prolifically on local history; his \"Chronicles of the Cape Fear\" are still consulted. He was also a pioneer in historic preservation; he and his wife, Luola owned both the Gov. Dudley Mansion in Wilmington and Orton Plantation.\n\nBertha Todd\n\nA career educator, Bertha Boykin Todd spent 39 years in the New Hanover County school system before retiring in 1992.\n\nAfter years as the beloved librarian at Williston High School, Todd found herself transferred to John T. Hoggard High School in 1968, when county schools fully desegregated and Williston was closed. She served as assistant principal at Hoggard until 1985.\n\nDuring the racial tensions of 1970 and 1971, former Superintendent Heyward Bellamy credited her with providing a voice and an ear for minority students and for helping defuse tense situations. In 1985, she was transferred to the schools’ central office.\n\nTodd helped desegregate the Wilmington YWCA and co-chaired the 1898 Centennial Foundation, which oversaw a year-long reassessment of the city’s history of racial violence.\n\nReporter Ben Steelman can be reached at 910-343-2208 or Ben.Steelman@StarNewsOnline.com.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThese are the 15 people we think shaped the Cape Fear region over the past 150 years.
