        "text": "CBPR process\n\nProviders in the Pediatric Department of a large academic hospital had been frustrated for a long time with diabetes self-management with their adolescent patients. While some teens adhered to prescribed regimens of physical activity, diet, blood sugar monitoring, and insulin administration, a large proportion of individuals were managing their disease poorly. Conventional approaches to improving diabetes management such as teaching community classes about diabetes and self-care, and diabetes-related fairs and public forums were not effective for enhancing diabetes management. Similarly, warnings during standard care visits about a variety of long-term consequences associated with poor metabolic control were reported to be ineffective. Adolescents continued to evidence unhealthy physiological indicators of diabetes control, such as elevated hemoglobin A1c and body mass index, and they demonstrated little apparent motivation to change. Parents complained about being “nags” to teenagers who wanted to be left alone. Adolescents complained about adults (parents, providers) who would not “get off their backs” or allow them to have the same freedom and spontaneity as their peers. Providers felt triangulated into family conflicts, oftentimes while in the exam room, without any clear idea about what to do other than go over the same old information and cautionary warnings.\n\nInitial conversations between the director of Pediatrics and University researchers ensued to identify new ideas for this old and increasing problem. The researcher suggested that a community-based participatory research approach be applied to this problem because it would move efforts beyond the conventional top-down services these adolescents and their families were resisting. The director had strong buy-in because he had seen numerous traditional attempts fail, but was optimistic that there was still an unknown solution yet to be found (action strategy #1; see ). Not being familiar with interventions involving active individual and family participation in partnership with providers, but maintaining an investment to address the problem with an openness to try new solutions, the director mobilized other providers to meet (action strategy #2; see ), learn about CBPR, and decide whether and how to proceed (action strategy #3; see ).\n\nEarly meetings between researchers and providers addressed how to engage patients as collaborators in the design of supplemental services to standard care (action strategy #4; see ). This would tap a variety of resources previously untapped, including individuals’ and families’ lived experience and wisdom of living with diabetes on a day-to-day basis. The Citizen Health Care Model was introduced as a guiding framework. The model views providers as citizens with specific knowledge and skills who work actively with other citizens who also possess important knowledge and skills. The model also argues that citizen partners must recognize and value the contributions that each member brings to the common mission, and that members must consciously and explicitly avoid conventional provider-consumer dynamics or hegemonic advantage to “experts”. Likewise, families are viewed as active producers and co-creators of action and change and do not function in a conventional consumer or patient role.\n\nSix families, through their providers, were then invited to meet with providers and researchers to discuss ideas regarding the building of a citizen initiative that would benefit families whose adolescents were unsuccessfully managing their diabetes (action strategy #5; see ). Adolescents and parents were enthusiastic about creating something new through CBPR, with the larger vision of developing a model of care by and for its citizens with all participants functioning as stakeholders in the process. Adolescents, in particular, were very active in the process because they felt listened to and valued. The group collaboratively identified key areas of concern and developed solutions within the contexts of the hospital and surrounding community’s resources. As adolescents, parents, providers, and researchers met over the following 6 months as the action planning group, an exciting new program was named by the group and began to take root (action strategy #6; see ).\n\nThrough the ANGELS (A Neighbor Giving Encouragement, Love, and Support), adolescents and their parents who have lived experience with diabetes (called “support partners”) were connected with other families (called “members”) who were struggling with the illness. These efforts begin at the time of diagnosis, which occurs almost universally in the context of emergency hospitalization. It is during this time that the initiative’s teens maintained that they wanted the ANGELS to connect with members, because the motivation to adopt healthy lifestyles is the highest at a time of crisis. Support partners and members met at the time of hospitalization in a variety of combinations (e.g., adolescents with adolescents, parents with parents, families with families), and then continued to meet off hospital grounds (or via telephone, e-mail, internet discussion boards) after initial hospitalization. Sometimes members simply needed a pep talk; other times ongoing support was offered for several months. Adolescents and parents in the ANGELS program worked democratically with providers and researchers throughout every stage of its development – from initial brainstorming regarding the program’s mission, naming process, training design, public-visibility efforts, implementation, and ongoing problem-solving and maintenance (action strategy #7; see ).\n\nCBPR process\n\nUniversity of Minnesota (UMN) researchers, already situated within a health care clinic, and leaders in the St. Paul Department of Indian Work, already patients at the same clinic, had several informal conversations about the diabetes problem in AI families and the wider AI community. As they talked about the concerns regarding the sense of defeat, the researchers and community members decided to approach this challenge with a community-based participatory research paradigm, using Citizen Health Care as a guide. AI families in the community who were patients at the clinic were invited to participate in the action planning group. This was done by providers in the clinic nominating families who were managing diabetes well (though not perfectly). During the first six months of meeting together as an action planning group, considerable effort was spent in designing a partnership with providers that was very different than conventional top-down models of care. AI family community members succeeded in sensitizing clinical researchers regarding the process, pace, and importance of building trust within AI circles. As the team engaged in the ongoing meetings, discussions, and AI community events, this trust evolved. Researchers learned about AI culture, the diversity of cultures and tribes within this larger frame (e.g., Dakota, Ojibwe, Hocak), the importance of family, cultural belief systems, and manners. In turn, AI family community members gained more insight regarding how Western medicine is oriented and thereby gained insight into providers’ habitudes and perspectives in health care delivery.\n\nAfter 6 months of the action planning group meeting, doing stakeholder interviews and creating an intervention, the Department of Indian Work’s (DIW) Family Education & Diabetes Series was implemented by community AI families, providers, and researchers as a supplement to standard care for families within the AI community who were touched by diabetes. Families (spouses, parents, children), the family member(s) with diabetes, and providers (physicians, nurses, dieticians, mental health personnel) came together every other week for an evening of fellowship, education, and support. Generally 6-7 providers, 4-5 tribal elders, and 12 families (approximately 35-40 community members) attended. Meetings began with all participants checking and recording each other’s blood sugars, weight, body mass index, and conducting foot checks. Families cooked meals together that were consistent with AI culture and traditions, and a great deal of discussion was put forth regarding the meal’s ingredients, portion sizes, and relevance to diabetes. Family meals were emphasized during this aspect of the project in order to address the common problems of: (a) eating individually or (b) the female head of household doing all the meal planning and cooking. Planning the menu and meal preparation were discussed as a “we” responsibility in order to help promote diabetes friendly meals and family connection. Educational sequences followed and took place in talking circles and across a variety of lively activities (e.g., traditional and modern music, chair dancing and aerobics, impromptu theater and role-plays). Instructional topics were similarly diverse, e.g., basic diabetes education, obesity, foot care, stress management, exercise, family relationships, retinopathy, dental care, and resources for medical services and supplies. FEDS evenings concluded with time for informal sharing and support. These bi-weekly series were scheduled to last for three hours, but most families arrived early and stayed late.\n\nResearch process\n\nAt the beginning of the CBPR process (approximately 3 months into the process), the action planning group discussed the research elements of the project. It was determined early on that hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, blood pressure, knowledge of diabetes, and psychosocial stress would be measured. These outcomes were identified by determining which issues each member of the action planning group was most worried about for AI families who were dealing with diabetes. As the issues were discussed a list was created and variables that could potentially measure these concerns were identified (e.g., concern = heart attack as complication of diabetes, variable to measure = blood pressure, weight, & A1c; concern = family stress, variable to measure = psychosocial stress). During this CBPR process one stakeholder’s perspective was not given advantage over another’s thus, outcome variables were not included unless all parties agreed. All assessment measures being utilized in the study were also examined and approved by the action planning group comprised of AI families, providers, and researchers. One example of the importance of using this CBPR process was made overt when the psychosocial assessment instrument was being discussed. The AI family community members identified that there was very sensitive material regarding sexual intimacy on the instrument. The providers and researchers were told that this would not be respectful to AI culture and that families may become suspicious of the research, or may not even participate, if the entire instrument was used. The action planning group decided to remove the subscale that involved sensitive material and use the rest of the instrument. This decision was beneficial because it did not alter the research question(s) being answered but did increase the likelihood of participation.\n\nData collection was also collaboratively done. The action planning group decided that AI family community members would be more trusting of data collection if other AI families were involved in the collection process. The action planning group also wanted to promote diabetes self-management skills, and by having AI family members collect each other’s data, they would also be learning how to improve their diabetes self-management skills. Thus, AI family members collected data that was appropriate to collect (weight & BMI, foot checks, exercise logs, blood sugars), and the providers and researchers collected data that was specialist-specific (paper assessments, A1c levels, and blood pressure). AI family community members, providers, and researchers were all present at the FEDS meetings in order to promote the idea of a partnership and co-creation of health.\n\nAs analyses were run by the researchers, the action planning group discussed the results and next steps. Many positive changes were seen related to weight, A1c, and psychosocial stress. One area that was not showing improvement, and in some cases was getting worse, was diabetes knowledge. The action planning group decided to investigate potential problems with this variable. The instrument itself was re-visited, how the information was being taught was looked at, and how the instrument was administered to the participants was examined. It was decided that how the information was being taught was not translatable into laypersons language. In the next series an AI elder taught the session about diabetes 101 and the diabetes knowledge score for participants went up or stayed consistent (rather than decreasing or being inconsistent).\n\nAs the project evolved, the action planning group discussed presentations and publications. It was decided by the action planning group that each time a presentation or publication was submitted, a conversation would ensue regarding who should be involved and in what capacity. Over 15 presentations have been done to-date, in which about half have been with family members of the AI community, providers, and researchers, while the other half have been done by researchers themselves or by AI family community members. Several publications have also resulted from this work. The action planning group decided that communicating the results of the project to a broad audience was important. Thus, some of the publications have been in academic peer reviewed journals, and others have been in newsletters, newspapers, or reports. Authorship was determined beforehand and followed a pre-set pattern. For example, the first author must be directly connected to the venue in which the article will be published (e.g., academic journal = researcher, medical newsletter = provider, newspaper, or community report = AI community family member). Grants have also been written collaboratively. The action planning group determined that the researchers would write the initial drafts of the grant; the AI community family members and providers then gave feedback on the draft, and final approval of the grant was given by the entire action planning group."
