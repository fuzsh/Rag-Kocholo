        "text": "Anthony David Miles (born November 8, 1971) is an American actor, writer and comedian. He was head writer for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon from 2014 to 2017, which he helped to develop. As an actor, he is best known as step-dad Gary on the Fallon skit Ew! and as Marty Shonson on Comedy Central's Dog Bites Man. He has also appeared in multiple other Fallon sketches, such as a member of the Ragtime Gals and Mr. Fletcher in the sketches in which Fallon and Justin Timberlake sing songs at their childhood camp. He also appeared in recurring roles on both Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!.Miles' film work includes Bamboozled, The Believer, Wet Hot American Summer, Thirteen Conversations About One Thing, Uptown Girls, The Baxter, The Ten, Role Models, and Wedding Daze. Miles is a regular on David Wain's internet series Wainy Days and the creator and star of Horrible People, a show on the website My Damn Channel. He served as the head writer on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and often appeared in the show's comedy sketches, before moving with Fallon to The Tonight Show. Miles is a frequent collaborator with comedian and director David Wain and the comedy trio Stella (of which Wain is a member), appearing in the Stella shorts and the 2005 Stella TV series, and acting in many of Wain's projects (Wet Hot American Summer, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, The Ten, Role Models, Childrens Hospital, Wainy Days) and in Stella member Michael Showalter's The Baxter. As of season five, Miles is credited as a \"consulting producer\" on Arrested Development. Miles is married to artist and clothing designer Katie Miles. The couple have two daughters and live in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nRapper-comedian Affion Crockett first gained attention for his eerily accurate impersonations of rap-stars and celebrities on fellow comic Nick Cannon's improv-comedy game show for MTV, \"Wild 'n Out.\" After the show's cancellation, he turned his efforts towards creating videos for the Web. The rising comic's talents did not go unrecognized. As his following on YouTube exploded, he got the chance to work with the Wayans Brothers in the 2009 spoof \"Dance Flick\" and with his hero, the late Bernie Mac, when Crockett played an inept rapper in the 2008 musical buddy-comedy \"Soul Men.\" A video showcasing his impression of Russell Simmons caught the attention of the hip-hop mogul himself and led to the Web-based miniseries \"Hustles With Russell.\" Oscar-winning \"In Living Color\"-alumnus Jamie Foxx spearheaded a crack production team that included \"Arrested Development\" co-creator Mitch Hurwitz in support of the Crockett's first starring credit, the short-lived, hybrid improv-sketch series \"In the Flow with Affion Crockett.\" The 2011 series featured contributions from his frequent collaborator Robin Thede, a veteran of the Los Angeles improv scene. Crockett's career has been peppered with appearances on Adult Swim, including guest spots on the post-modern sketch show \"Robot Chicken\" and on outspoken comic artist Aaron McGruder's unflinching animated series, \"The Boondocks.\""
