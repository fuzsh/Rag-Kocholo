Her father served in the Navy, so they moved frequently, finally settling in Pfafftown in 1969. She graduated from West Forsyth in 1970. She worked at Old Salem in the Single Brothers’ Dye Shop, which inspired her to attend UNCG to enhance her skills in the art of weaving. She also studied to be an interpreter for the deaf, passing her love of sign language and deaf culture on to her children. In early 1995, she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and underwent a lengthy experimental treatment protocol. She was declared cancer-free in 2008, but was re-diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2015. This did not stop her from volunteering at Feel Good Friday, encouraging other cancer patients. She loved and appreciated her church family at Grace Bible Church who helped her grow in her faith in Jesus Christ. In the early hours of Valentine’s Day, she went home to her Savior. She was predeceased by her youngest brother, Mark Kilner Rice; her mother, Ruth Elizabeth Tuttle Rice; her stepmother, Louise Hester-Rice; her father, Howell Barbee Rice; and many much-loved pets.
