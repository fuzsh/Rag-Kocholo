        "text": "Since North Carolina A&T's first graduating class in 1899, it has sent more than 60,000 alumni into the world, where many have gone on to great success, making singificant contribution in government, STEM professions, sports, academia, business and more. Here are the stories of some of the most prominent Aggies. Scroll the page or use the bulleted list of anchor-linked date spans to navigate the list of alumni who graduated during those periods.\n\n~ 1891 – 1941 ~\n\nAdam Watson (1870 – 1908)\n\nOf the \"Superior Seven\" of 1899 -- the first graduating class of A&T -- the one who received the most acclaim at commencement was Adam Watson. His thesis was a working steam engine that was promoted as the first engine built by a person of color in North Carolina. Watson became head of the Department of Mechanics at A&T from 1902 until ill health forced him to resign in 1906. He designed the South Dormitory (later renamed Old Vanstory Hall), completed in 1907. That building, which stood where the parking lot next to the former Morrison Hall is today, is believed to have been the first structure on campus designed by an alumnus and person of color.\n\nFrances Grimes Runner Bryant (~1884 – 1952)\n\nThe first woman to earn a bachelor’s degree from A&T was Frances Grimes, a schoolteacher from Asheville Township, Buncombe County, N.C., who received her degree in 1901. Grimes was a strong student and active alum, and history shows that she attended some of our earliest known aalumni reunions. She taught at schools in Asheville and Charlotte. Later in life, she married Charles L. Bryant, a 1900 graduate of the preparatory department.\n\nFlorence A. Garrett (~1860 – 1916)\n\nA schoolteacher, prohibitionist and lecturer, Florence A. Garret was one of the last three women to graduate from A&T until women were readmitted in 1928, earning her degree in 1902. She was a schoolteacher in Greensboro at the Percy Street Colored Graded School where fellow alumnus H.H. Falkener was principal. A member of the Thurman Women Christian TempeFrance Union, she was an outspoken opponent of alcohol consumption. In 1886, she delivered a speech to an audience of white female temperance workers, and was said to have been the first woman of color in North Carolina to address a white female audience.\n\nErkwood Logan (~1876 – ?)\n\nDescribed as a student with \"a special aptitude for invention,\" Erkwood Logan is the earliest known A&T student to file a patent. A 1901 graduate of the old preparatory department, Logan developed a biscuit-cutting machine in 1903 while still enrolled at A&T. It was patented as a \"Cutting Machine For Plastic Materials\" on Nov. 29, 1904, while he lived in Philadelphia. In 1911, Logan also filed a patent for a children’s toy.\n\nDr. Boisy Winslow Barnes (? – 1978)\n\nA graduate of the class of 1909, B.W. Barnes became a legend in the A&T community. As a student, he chauffeured A&T First Lady Susie B. Dudley and acted in her commencement plays. He was an instructor in bacteriologyy at A&T before becoming a dentist. A supporter of A&T, the Alumni Association, civil rights and health care, he was ultimately honored by having Barnes Hall on the A&T campus named for him.\n\nEdward Richard Merrick (1888 – 1967)\n\nAn outstanding Aggie in the field of civics and business was E.R. Merrick. After graduating from A&T in 1908, he began a long and prosperous career in the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in Durham, N.C. He began as an administrative assistant and worked his way up to vice-president/treasurer beginning in 1934. Merrick served in that role until his retirement in 1957.\n\nHe was also a trustee at A&T and one of the founders of the A&T College Alumni Scholarship Fund, for which he was also the first treasurer. Shortly after his death in 1967 at the age of 78, and as part of A&T’s 75th Anniversary, it was announced that the new mathematics and business school building would be called the Edward R. Merrick Hall.\n\nDr. Roscoe C. Ward (1893 – 1954)\n\nRoscoe Cassius Ward ('15) became a prominent figure in the African-American community of Port Chester, New York. He was regionally and national famous for his estate and work in the field of dentistry. A dedicated alumnus of A&T, he became the namesake for Ward Hall on the A&T campus, which today houses the University Police Department. It originally served as the home of the A&T dairy department.\n\nSimon Alexander Haley (1892 – 1973)\n\nIn 1979, millions of TV viewers watched \"Roots: The Next Generation,\" the sequel to the 1977 epic miniseries, “Roots.” Based on the genealogical research of author Alex Haley, the sequel featured actor Dorian Harewood portraying the author’s father, Simon A. Haley ('18). Simon Haley was of one several Aggies who saw combat in France during the first World War. He became a professor of agriculture in Arkansas, and the legacy of the Haley family is honored today with the Haley Hall dormitory on the A&T campus.\n\nJohn Dudley Wray (1885-1937)\n\nA pioneering agriculturalist, John D. Wray ‘1909 was also North Carolina’s first African-American Farm Makers Club (now 4-H) agent, appointed in 1915. After graduating from A&T, he worked for two years at Tuskegee Institute under Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver. He returned to the A&M College in 1912 and increased the crops and acreage of the old A&T Farm.\n\nFor his accomplishments, Wray was awarded an honorary master's degree in agriculture from A&T in 1913. From 1915 – '25, he served A&T and black farm families statewide as extension agent, professor of agriculture, columnist and one of if not the earliest known presidents of the National A&T Alumni Association.\n\nNora Foster Dowdy (1910 – '75)\n\nAfter A&T readmitted women to its bachelor’s degree programs, one of its outstanding students was Nora Foster. In 1931 she became the first female editor of the A&T Register campus newspaper. Foster helped to launch the A&T chapter of Delta Sigma Theta. She married Dr. Haywood Dowdy, a dentist, and served the community of Washington, N.C., as a longtime teacher and librarian.\n\nLonnie Pfunander Byarm, Sr. (1889– 1955)\n\nLonnie P. Byarm Sr., ‘1911 was an outstanding athlete as a basketball player, serving as both captain and manager of the old A&T College football team during the 1910-11 season. After graduating, he became an instructor of mechanics and an athletics coach at A&T. He was one of five A&T faculty/staff who served in France during World War I in the Armed Expeditiary Forces (AEF). As an athletics coach, he led A&T into the Colored (Central) Intercollegiate Athletics Association and emerged with our first football championship in 1927.\n\nHe left A&T in 1930 to coach Johnson C. Smith University, but his legacy for transforming our football team remains. After his death in 1955, Byarm may have been the first Aggie veteran buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His son, L.P. Byarm Jr., was also an athletics director at A&T.\n\nCharles W. Fairely (1919 – '92)\n\nCharles W. Fairley was born in Greensboro, graduated from James B. Dudley High School and earned his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education and Mathematics at N.C. A&T. He served in the U.S.. Army during World War II. After his military service, he began teaching in the Greensboro Public School system and started a string of “firsts” in the region.\n\nHe was the first African-American Greensboro citizen employed by the Boy Scouts of America as a scout executive. In 1945, he was the first African-American employed by Greensboro as a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal System. In 1968, he was appointed executive director of the City of Fayetteville and Cumberland County’s Redevelopment Commission. He was Fayetteville’s first African-American executive director and is reported to have been the second in that capacity in the Southeastern United States. In 1983, he received NAACP’s “Man of the Year Award,” and in 1985, its Martin Luther King Award.\n\nMargaret Tynes (1919 - ?)\n\nInternationally renowned African American opera, concert and oratorio soprano and singing actress Margaret Tynes earned her bachelor's degree from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in 1941. She was also Miss A&T, 1939-40. Tynes continued her studies at Juilliard School in New York City and later earned a Masters in Music Education from Columbia University.\n\nShe performed in the United States, Canada and throughout Europe. Tynes appeared with leading opera companies of the United States and Europe, including the Metropolitan Opera and the Vienna Staatsoper. Her roles range from Lady Macbeth (Macbeth), Carmen (Carmen), Aida (Aida) and Dido (Dido and Aeneas). She gained international acclaim for her role as Salome at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. She became the first American to perform behind the Iron Curtain when she went to Russia with Ed Sullivan for the U.S. State Department. In 1957, Tynes was a guest at the NAACP Freedom Fund Dinner where she was joined by Rose Morgan, Steve Allen, Jackie Robinson and Cab Calloway. The event honored Duke Ellington and Branch Rickey, the baseball executive who brought Jackie Robinson to the Major League.\n\nThe hon. Elreta Alexander-Ralston (1919 – '98)\n\nAn academic prodigy who graduated high school at 15, Elreta Melton Alexander-Ralston earned a B.S. in Music from A&T in 1937 at the age of 18. She taught high school for six years before being admitted to Columbia Law School in 1943 at the age of 24 – the first black woman to enroll in the iconic Ivy League institution and, two years later, the first to graduate. She passed the bar two years later, becoming the first Black woman to practice law in North Carolina.\n\nWithin a few short years, she and three white partners formed the first integrated law practice in the nation. In 1968, she became North Carolina’s first elected black judge and the first Black woman to be elected a district court judge in America; she was subsequently re-elected three times. She ran for the Republican nomination for chief justice of the N.C. Supreme Court in 1974, but lost in the primary. Today, the Judge Elreta Alexander-Ralston Courtroom in the Guilford County Courthouse — where her portrait hangs — bears her name.\n\nEllis Franklin Corbett (1910 – '71)\n\nRemembered affectionately as “Mr. A&T,” Corbett had a zeal and drive for promoting A&T that few have ever equaled. In his undergraduate years, Corbett took one class in journalism and was elected the first student editor-in-chief of the A&T Register. After 20 years as circulation manager for the Norfolk Journal and Guide, Corbett returned to A&T as a media relations director. He worked tirelessly to promote A&T in the regional and national press, and later would serve in university development. The Corbett Sports Center is named in his honor.\n\nDr. Charles Herbert Flowers (1918-2011)\n\nA student at A&T from 1934-36, Flowers went on to become a pilot, one of the first Tuskegee Airmen and the first Black flight instructor at Tuskegee Air Force Base in World War II. Charles Herbert Flowers High School is named in his honor in Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\nLt. Samuel \"Sam\" Martin Bruce (1915 - 1944)\n\nTuskegee Airman, Air Force lieutenant in 99th Fighter Squadron in World War II and all-star athlete are just a few of honors in the life of alumnus Sam Bruce, who enrolled in A&T in 1933. When the federal government created the Tuskegee Airmen program, he was one of the first volunteers to enter flight school.\n\n~ 1942 – '71 ~\n\nU.S. Representative Alma Adams (1946 –\n\nCongresswoman Adams (’69, ’72) earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Art Education at A&T before completing a Ph.D. at Ohio State. She served on the Greensboro City Council and School Board, as well as in the state House of Representatives, before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for a partial term in 2014 and for four successive full terms since.\n\nAmong her many accomplishment, Adams is the founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus and of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, both among the largest caucus groups in Congress. She has been a strong, vocal and persistent advocate for HBCUs throughout her tenure in Washington.\n\nAlvin Attles (1936 –\n\nA native of New Jersey, Attles came south to A&T to earn his B.S. in Physical Education (‘60) and start his legendary basketball career. A fifth-round pick in the 1960 NBA draft, he went to the Philadelphia Warriors, playing alongside Wilt Chamberlain. When the team moved to the San Francisco Bay area in 1962, becoming the Golden State Warriors, he went along, playing until 1971.\n\nHis defensive prowess earned him the title “the Destroyer.” In 1969-70, he became player-coach of the team – one of the NBA’s first Black coaches – and continued as head coach once his playing days ended, guiding the Warriors to the NBA championship in 1975. He coached for 14 seasons and served as general manager, becoming one of if not the first HBCU graduate to serve as a GM in professional U.S. sports. He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and has been on the Warriors payroll for 58 years, the longest uninterrupted streak in pro sports by far.\n\nChief Justice Henry Frye (ret.) (1932 -\n\nAfter graduating from A&T ('53) and serving in the U.S. Army in Korea, Frye returned home and sought to register to vote, only to find that he would have to pass a series of tests aimed at keeping him and others who looked like him from voting. That is when he decided to become a lawyer. In 1959, he became the first African American to complete a full law degree from the UNC Cchapel Hill.\n\nHe went on to accomplish many other historic firsts including becoming the first African American assistant U.S. District Attorney, the first African American to be elected to the North Carolina General Assembly in the 20th century, and first African American chief justice appointed to the N.C. Supreme Court.\n\nMamie \"Peanut\" Johnson (1935-2017)\n\nA South Carolina native who grew up in Washington, D.C., Mamie Johnson was a phenom on the baseball field, pitching and hitting every good as the boys -- perhaps even better. She tried out for the All American Girls Professional Baseball League -- the inspiration for the movie, \"A League of Their Own\" -- in the 1940s, but was turned down because of her race. But a scout later watching her play immediately signed her to the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro Leagues in 1953, and for three seasons, she more than held her own against such luminaries as Satchel Paige and Hank Bayliss, becoming one of only three women to play in the all Black league.\n\nShe amassed a pitching record of 33-8, thanks to an array of pitches including a knuckleball, a mean slider, a curveball that Paige helped her master and what has been described as a \"deceptively hard\" fastball. She also batted a respectable .262 to .284.\n\nFollowing the 1955 season, she retired and enrolled at North Carolina A&T, where she earned a B.S. in Nursing before embarking on a 30-year career in health care. She was richly celebrated upon her death, and the Mamie \"Peanut\" Johnson Little League in Washington, D.C. is named in her honor.\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson (1941 –\n\nAn icon in the U.S. Civil Rights movement, Jackson got his academic start at A&T, where he also served as student body president and quarterback of the football team, graduating in 1964 with a B.S. in sociology. He went on to attend Chicago Theological Seminary before being ordained as a minister. Heavily involved in civil rights activism, he was famously with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis when King was assassinated.\n\nJackson became the first major Black candidate to run for the U.S. presidency in 1984 and 1988, winning four Democratic primaries/caucuses in the first race and 11 in the second, along with 6.9 million votes. He served as “shadow senator” for Washington, D.C., from 1991-'97. He continues to serve as president of the social change organization Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which he founded in 1971.\n\nDr. Ronald E. McNair (1950 – '86)\n\nA towering intellect who refused to let the Jim Crow South hold him back, even as a child, McNair earned a B.S. in Engineering Physics, magna cum laude, in 1971. He went on to earn a Ph.D. at MIT while undertaking prominent research in laser physics. After a stint at the Hughes Research Lab in California, he was chosen for NASA’s astronaut program.\n\nIn his second space shuttle mission, he perished in the Challenger tragedy at the age of 35. In death, he has become a major figure across the country, with dozens of schools, labs, centers and programs named in his honor, most notable the U.S. Department of Education’s Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, which has prepared thousands of minority candidates for Ph.D. programs.\n\nEthel Mae Carmack Benton (1925 – 2007)\n\nEthel Mae Benton was a graduate of James B. Dudley High School and attended N.C. A&T. Prior to the Woolsworth sit-in demonstrations, she was arrested twice for sitting at a dining table in a “white only” restaurant in downtown Greensboro. It is reported that it was reading of her arrest that helped inspire the four A&T students David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair and Joseph McNeil to sit down at the segregated lunch counter.\n\nBrig. Gen. Jimmy “Mac”McMillian\n\nNow working for the U.S. Dept. of Energy, McMillian ('81) served 31 years in the Air Force in multiple assignments including director of Security Forces, and deputy chief of staff for Logistics, Installations and Mission Support.\n\nHe was the focal point for ensuring physical security of nuclear assets and protecting resources from terrorism, sabotage and acts of war. He retired from the Air Force in 2012, having achieved the rank of Brigadier General.\n\nElvin Bethea (1946 -\n\nThe first Aggie to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Bethea ‘68, played for 16 seasons with the Houston Oliers. As a standout defensive end at A&T, he was drafted to the Oilers in the third round.\n\nDuring his career in Houston, Bethea played in 210 games, including a stretch of 135 consecutively. He played at defensive end and guard in the 1968 season and didn't miss a game until breaking his arm in a game against the Oakland Raiders in 1977. He led the team in sacks six times, finishing his career with 105 unofficial sacks.\n\nHis career high was in 1973 with 16 sacks, which still ranks as the best in Oilers/Tennessee Titans history, a feat made more remarkable by the Oilers' 1-13 record.\n\nEdolphus \"Ed\" Towns, Jr. (1934 –\n\nA United States congressman for 30 years, Towns served in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 2013. A Democrat from New York, Towns served on several caucuses including the Congressional Black Caucus, and was Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2009 to 2011.\n\nKnown for serving the people of Brooklyn and focusing on the best for his constituents, Towns also sponsored and co-sponsored bills for ethical student-athlete practices, healthcare reform, and advocating for minorities.\n\nThe A&T Four: Ezell Blair, Jr., Franklin McCain, Joseph McNeil & David Richmond\n\nOn the afternoon of Feb. 1, 1960, four N.C. A&T students walked from campus to the downtown Greensboro Woolworth, sat down at its whites-only lunch counter and asked to be served. That simple action touched off a wave of similar sit-ins throughout the south, grabbing the attention of the nation. The actions of Blair ('63), McCain ('64), McNeil ('63) and Richmond not only led to the desegregation of the Woolworth's lunch counter five months later, but to integration in other public accommodations across the United States. In many ways, their activism served as an emotional catalyst for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned racial discrimination in public accommodations, as well as in education, employment and voting.\n\nThe example of A&T Four also spurred an explosion in student activism at historically black campuses nationwide. Just 2 1/2 months after their sit-ins began, Black college leaders gathered at Shaw University in Raleigh to form the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, over two days of meetings that included young people who would go on to hold positions of great leadership in the Civil Rights movement: John Lewis, Stokely Carmichael, Diane Nash, Julian Bond, Marion Barry and many more, including the A&T Four.\n\nThe legacy of the Four is celebrated each Feb. 1 at A&T with a major ceremony that concludes with a mass visit to the statue commemorating the legendary freshmen in front of historic Dudley Hall. The statue resides in a Historic District listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nBrig. Gen. Clara L. Adams-Ender (1939-\n\nClara Leach Adams-Ender ('61) was the first woman to receive her master's degree in military arts and sciences from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.\n\nShe was Chief of the United States Army Nurse Corps from September 1987 to August 1991 and is also the first African-American nurse corps officer to graduate from the United States Army War College.\n\nDuring her time at A&T, she participated in the Woolworth sit-ins to desegregate their whites-only lunch counter.\n\nShe is the recipient of the Army Distinguished Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, of the Roy Wilkins Meritorious Services and of the Gertrude E. Rush Award for Leadership. In 2019, she was inducted into the U.S. Army Women's Hall of Fame.\n\nRobert Herman “Stonewall” Jackson (1921 – 2010)\n\nRobert “Stonewall” Jackson (‘50) was one of A&T’s most outstanding athletes and a history maker in African American Sports. After earning All-CIAA and All-American honors in 1946, 1948 and 1949, he became the first football player from an HBCU to be drafted into an NFL team, the New York Giants, in the first round of 1950.\n\nAfter his playing career ended, he became a football coach, faculty memberr and trainer at North Carolina Central University, Shaw University and Texas Southern University.\n\nDr. Albert Westley Spruill (1926 - 2004)\n\nA professor, lecturer and dean of graduate studies at A&T for 23 years, Dr. Albert W. Spruill (‘49) was also one of A&T’s best historians.
