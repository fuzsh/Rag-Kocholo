Still, Born averaged 20.0 points per game in the 1953 NCAA tournament and recorded a triple-double (26 points, 15 rebounds, 13 blocks) against the Hoosiers.\n\n1952: Clyde Lovellette — Kansas\n\nClyde Lovellette was leading scorer of the 1952 NCAA tournament with 141 total points over four games. He dominated in the national championship against St. John's (N.Y.), scoring 33 points (12-of-25 shooting) and grabbing 17 rebounds to clinch the Jayhawks' first title.\n\n1951: Bill Spivey — Kentucky\n\nBill Spivey averaged 18.0 points and 16.3 rebounds over four games and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1951 NCAA tournament. Spivey's 22-point, 21-rebound performance in the national championship game helped the Wildcats defeat Kansas State 68-58.\n\n1950: Irwin Dambrot — CCNY\n\nIrwin Dambrot (No. 5 in the picture above) was named Most Outstanding Player of the 1950 NCAA tournament, as CCNY won both the NCAA and NIT tournaments that year — the only team to ever accomplish that feat. Dambrot only scored 36 points in the NCAA tournament. But he finished with a team-high 15 in the championship game against Bradley.\n\n1949: Alex Groza — Kentucky\n\nGroza became the second person to repeat as Most Outstanding Player in 1949. Once again, he finished with more points in the NCAA tournament (82) than any other player. His Wildcats also became the second men's basketball program to win back-to-back titles.\n\n1948: Alex Groza — Kentucky\n\nAlex Groza was the leading scorer of the 1948 NCAA tournament, finishing with 54 points over three games. He also posted a game-high 14 points in the championship game against Baylor.\n\n1947: George Kaftan — Holy Cross\n\nThanks to a tournament-high 63 points and a national championship, George Kaftan of Holy Cross was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1947 NCAA tournament. Kaftan scored a team-high 18 points in the championship game against Oklahoma.\n\n1946: Bob Kurland — Oklahoma A&M\n\nKuralnd and the Aggies made history in the 1946 NCAA tournament. Not only was Oklahoma A&M the first school to win back-to-back men's basketball championships, Kurland was the first person to be named Most Outstanding Player in consecutive seasons. He was also the tournament's leading scorer yet again, this time finishing with 72 points.\n\n1945: Bob Kurland — Oklahoma A&M\n\nBob Kurland (No. 90 in the picture above) led Oklahoma A&M, now known as Oklahoma State, to its first national championship in 1945. He was the leading scorer of the NCAA tournament with 65 points, 22 of which came in the title game against NYU. He's also responsible for the first known dunk in college basketball history.\n\n1944: Arnie Ferrin — Utah\n\nUtah's Arnie Ferrin (seen with the ball in the image above) became the first freshman to be named Most Outstanding Player after the 1944 NCAA tournament. Ferrin scored 22 of Utah's 41 points in the title game against Dartmouth. The Utes needed every last bucket too, winning 42-40.\n\n1943: Ken Sailors — Wyoming\n\nKen Sailors, who helped popularize the jump shot, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1943 NCAA tournament. Sailors' 16 points in the championship game against Georgetown easily led all scorers. No other player finished in double figures.\n\n1942: Howie Dallmar — Stanford\n\nHowie Dallmar (pictured during his tenure as Stanford's head coach) led all scorers with 15 points in the championship game, as Stanford took care of Dartmouth 53-38. Dallmar was named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1942 NCAA tournament.\n\n1941: John Kotz — Wisconsin\n\nJohn Kotz (No. 40 in the picture above) averaged 12.3 points per game during the 1941 NCAA tournament and posted double figures in all three contests. He scored 12 points in the championship game as the Badgers narrowly beat Washington State 39-34.\n\n1940: Marvin Huffman — Indiana\n\nIndiana's Marvin Huffman scored just 24 points in three games during the 1940 NCAA tournament. But his team-high 12 points (Jay McCreary also scored 12) against Kansas in the title game helped the Hoosiers win their first national championship. Huffman was the first Most Outstanding Player from the team that won the title. This trend would continue for the next 12 years.\n\n1939: Jimmy Hull — Ohio State\n\nWhile his Buckeyes lost to Oregon 46-33 in the championship game, Jimmy Hull was named the Most Outstanding Player of the inaugural NCAA tournament. He was the tournament's leading scorer, finishing with 58 points over three games and a scoring average of 19.3.\n\nFinal Four Most Outstanding Player: Facts, figures and trends\n\nBob Kurland became the first player to win the award twice when he guided what's now known as Oklahoma State to back-to-back titles in 1945 and 1946. Kurland is one of five players to win the accolade multiple times. The others are Alex Groza (Kentucky, 1948-49), Jerry Lucas (Ohio State, 1960-61), Lew Alcindor (UCLA, 1967-69) and Bill Walton (UCLA, 1972-73).\n\nWalton's second time winning the award in 1973 bares significance both in his performance and in the year itself. The Bruins' big man put together one of the best performances in college basketball tournament history, hitting 21-of-22 shots and finishing with 44 points to lead UCLA to the title. Additionally, that season was the the last of of the Bruins' seven consecutive championships and was also the first year in which freshmen were granted varsity status in college basketball.\n\nHISTORY: Every NCAA DI men's basketball champion since 1939\n\nFollowing the NCAA rule change on the athletic status of freshmen, it'd be another 13 years before one would be named Most Outstanding Player of a Men's Final Four. Louisville's Pervis Ellison took home the honor in 1986, just the second freshman to do so at that point — Arnie Ferrin (Utah, 1944).\n\nSince then, a number of star freshman have captivated college basketball audiences with show-stopping highlights and deep NCAA tournament runs. However, only three other first-year players have been named Most Outstanding Player:\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Syracuse (2003)\n\nAnthony Davis, Kentucky (2012)\n\nTyus Jones, Duke (2015)\n\nTo this day, freshmen remain the least-represented demographic overall. But in the last 20 years, sophomores have produced the fewest winners. Joakim Noah is the sole sophomore on the list this century. He was named the 2006 recipient after the first of Florida's back-to-back titles.\n\nIt's been 13 seasons since a sophomore was the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. The two streaks longer than that are players winning multiple times (see above) and the award going to a non-champion. Hull was the first of a dozen players to be named Most Outstanding Player despite not winning a national championship. Hakeem Olajuwon is the last to do it, claiming the honor for Houston after the Cougars finished as national runner-up in 1983."
