        "text": "Lula Ruth Udall Patterson, 92, passed away peacefully at her home in St. Johns, Friday, 5, 2021. She was born May 14, 1928 in Eagar, the daughter of Karl Gaius Udall and Blanche Septema Layton.\n\nRuth attended the University of Arizona where she met and married Charles A. Patterson. Together they raised 7 children. She was a dedicated wife and mother and an active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She was a contributing member of the community and an especially enthusiastic Republican. She served as Republican Precinct Committeeman and throughout her service became friends with many politicians. Her kids laugh about a political event she attended at a fancy hotel. Unfortunately she forgot her ID and the young attendant would not check her in. John McCain and John Kyl showed up and vouched for her. They had ID’s. The young, vigilant attendant wouldn’t budge so the two Johns found management.\n\nAnother source of much enjoyment for Ruth was ranching. Throughout her life she worked with cattle and continued riding, gathering and vaccinating into her seventies. Ruth also served on the Arizona Parks Board and was especially proud of her involvement in the opening of the Kartchner Caverns State Park.\n\nRuth is survived by her children, Joe (Zonia) Patterson, Patty (Brent) Hanks, Charley (Sharla) Patterson, Lisa (Ethan) Trickey, Michelle (Bart) Udall, Suzanne (Shane) Davis, 29 grandchildren, 68 great grandchildren and 3 great, great grandchildren.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Charley, daughter, Nancy Gay and other beloved family members.\n\nFuneral services will be held Saturday, February 13, 2021 at 11 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, St. Johns Downtown building, with visitation beginning at 9:30 a.m. Interment will follow the funeral services at the St. Johns Westside Cemetery."
