Yet many people in High Point often overlook the growth and progress taking place right before our eyes. I used to be baffled by this, until one night in 2016 around my family’s kitchen table during dinner, all of that changed. My husband and our two children began asking ourselves, “What if people could see High Point through our eyes? What if they could see the hardworking small businesses, the growing university, the generous changemakers, the global High Point Market, the thriving artists and creatives? What if they could see High Point through a rose-colored lens?”\n\nThat night an idea was born. Our community is filled with artists, makers, families, entrepreneurs, educators, and places worth discovering. Maybe we just needed to bridge the gap between what needed to be discovered and the community of High Point.\n\nToday we embrace and celebrate the fact that High Point Discovered is indeed transforming the way people see High Point.
