        "text": "Mrs. Peggy Ann Atwell Ferrell, 88, of Winston-Salem, NC, passed away peacefully surrounded by her family on Monday, June 17, 2024, at her home.\n\nPeggy was born on August 18, 1935, to the late William R. Atwell and Mary Magdalene Bowman Atwell of Leckie, West Virginia.\n\nPeggy loved her Lord Jesus Christ. She enjoyed camping, but most of all spending time with her family, including her extended family in Mocksville, NC, which she loved dearly. Peggy loved any and all babies and has kept many throughout the years, to which she was known as “Mama Peg”! One special young lady, Kayla Whisenhunt, became a part of her family and still is today.\n\nIn addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her husband, William (Bill) Ferrell; brothers, William (Jr) Atwell and Joseph (JD) Atwell; and sister, Elvira Spangler.\n\nThose left to cherish her memory include her daughters, Deborah “Chris” Pitts and husband Dave and Billie Wells and husband Doug; grandson, Jack Wells; her “special” girl, Kayla Whisenhunt (Michael) and their precious daughter whom she loved like her own granddaughter, McKenna Saige; and several precious nieces, nephews, great nieces and nephews. One particular niece, Dianne O’Dell Griffis and husband Wendel, were faithful to visit and bring her gifts regularly.\n\nA funeral service will be held on Thursday, June 20, 2024, at 11:00AM at Hayworth-Miller Silas Creek Chapel with Pastor Nathan Becker and Pastor Dennis Bledsoe officiating. The family will receive friends the night prior, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, between the hours of 6:00PM – 8:00PM at Hayworth-Miller Silas Creek Chapel. Burial will immediately follow the funeral service at Parklawn Memorial Park.\n\nWe also would like to thank Linda (Clay) Hundley, her dear neighbor that visited regularly, and Dale Spaugh, a neighbor that sat by her side and comforted the family during the last hours.\n\nThank you to the Atrium Home Health nurses, Jennifer Price of Palliative Care, and her dedicated doctor who cared for her for many years, Ted Nifong.\n\nHayworth-Miller Silas Creek Chapel is assisting the Ferrell family.\n\nOnline condolences may be made at www.hayworth-miller.com"
