        "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nContact:\n\nJudith Ingram\n\nAugust 9, 2010\n\nJulia Queen Christian Hilland Mary Brandenberger\n\nFEC TAKES FINAL ACTION ON SIX CASES\n\nWASHINGTON â€“ The Federal Election Commission recently made public its final action on six matters under review (MURs). In one matter, respondents agreed to pay a civil penalty of $30,000 and in another matter, respondents agreed to pay a civil penalty of $2,200. In three matters, the Commission found no reason to believe a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), occurred in connection with one allegation and exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the other allegations. In another matter, the Commission found no reason to believe a violation occurred.\n\nUnder the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or MURs, through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group. Additional information regarding MURs can be found on the FEC web site at http://www.fec.gov/em/mur.shtml.\n\nThis release contains only summary information. For additional details, please consult publicly available documents for each case in the Enforcement Query System (EQS) on the FEC web site at http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate."
