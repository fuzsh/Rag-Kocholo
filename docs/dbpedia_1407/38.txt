TV Show Taping Schedules:

Short Window Shows

Some TV shows come into New York City to tape a lot of shows in a very short time. They book a TV studio and shoot a large amount of shows in a small time window to minimize their studio costs. Sometimes they can shoot 25 shows in one week. They may not return to NYC to tape again for several weeks. These types of shows are usually where the subject is not time sensitive or newsworthy, IE court shows, chef shows and game shows.

Daily Taping Shows

Other TV shows may tape every day and the show may be broadcast soon after taping, if not live. These TV shows maintain a permanent TV studio in the city. These shows have feature news, interviews, weather forecasts and special-interest stories. Late night talk shows, daytime talk shows and morning shows fit into this category.

Both types of these TV shows have free tickets which are available to the general public.

Some TV Shows Pay The Audience to Attend

Some of the short-window TV shows want to get a a reliable audience for a whole day of taping during a single day shoot. They will often pay audience members to attend these types of shows. The non-union pay rate is about $15/hour. The gig can last for up to 8 hours. Food and drinks are provided.
