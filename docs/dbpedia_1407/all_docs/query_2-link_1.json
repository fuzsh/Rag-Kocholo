Produced by BYUtv, the show aims to be a clean, family-oriented comedy for a national audience.\n\nThe show traces its roots to the Brigham Young University sketch comedy troupe Divine Comedy, which shares some cast members with Studio C. The show's name is a reference to the studio in the BYU Broadcasting Building where the show is primarily taped.[1][2]\n\nAs of May 2023, the Studio C YouTube channel had over 2.7 million subscribers and had received more than 2.6 billion total views.[3]\n\nIn August 2018, it was confirmed that Studio C would have a 10th season but the ten original cast members would be leaving after the 9th season to create and star together on a new family-comedy network called JK! Studios.[4] In addition to Johnson and Pence's return, the 10th season and onward feature all-new cast members.\n\nIn October 2020, it was announced that Jason Gray would return to Studio C as a permanent cast member in the fourteenth season during Fall 2021.[5][6]\n\nOn July 19, 2023, JK! Studios released a full length movie titled \"Go West\" in Utah theaters, containing the original 10 cast members of Studio C. It was released nationally on August 11.[7][8][9] In 2024, many of the members of JK! Studios, in conjunction with Canadian improvisational comedian Colin Mochrie (of Whose Line Is It Anyway? fame), announced plans to release Villains Inc., a self-funded production with plans to use crowdfunding to pay for independent distribution.[10]\n\nOn April 27, 2024, Studio C announced that Matt Meese would be returning for seasons 19 and 20 of the series, which will air Fall 2024 and Spring 2025.\n\nCast Cast member Seasons 1–4 5–7 8–9 10–13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Jason Gray Main Featured Main — — Mallory Everton Main — — — — Featured — — Whitney Call Main — — — — — Featured — — Matt Meese Main — — — — — Featured Main Adam Berg Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — Stacey Harkey Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — Natalie Madsen Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — Stephen Meek Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — James Perry Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — Jeremy Warner Featured Main — — — — — Featured — — Aaron Fielding — — Featured — — — — — — — — Dalton Johnson — Featured Main Tori Pence — Featured Main Featured — Main Garet Allen — — — Main Jessica Drolet — — — Main — — — — — Ike Flitcraft — — — Main Featured — Featured — — Matthew Galvan — — — Main — — — — — — — Tanner Gillman — — — Main Featured — — — — Jetta Juriansz — — — Main — — — — — Arvin Mitchell — — — Main — — — — April Rock — — — Main — — — — — — Austin Williams — — — Main — Featured — — Naomi Winders — — — — Featured Main — Featured Main Megan Rico — — — — Featured Main Featured — — Joe Balanza — — — — — Featured — — — — Gabby Moore — — — — — — Featured Main — — Jericho Lopez — — — — — — Featured Main Kiri Case — — — — — — — Main Carl Foreman — — — — — — — Main Aleta Myles — — — — — — — Main Michelle Knapp — — — — — — — — — Main Hugh Clark — — — — — — — — — Main\n\nN/A = Actor does not appear in those series.\n\nThe 10 original cast members of Studio C left after Season 10 to start their own comedy group, JK!

In this segment, Meegan is shown in the form of a puppet, interviewing the members of the Studio C cast to see if they are good enough at their jobs for him to renew their contracts. The interviews normally entail awkward, silly, and mostly improvised conversation between the cast members and a puppet.\n\nA series of short sketches showing Benjamin Franklin (played by Ike Flitcraft) at a desk writing in his journal. Franklin starts by going off on some humorous and seemingly random rant. He then states an actual adage from the writings of Benjamin Franklin that is funny in the context of what he'd said before.\n\nA fictional sitcom starring Garret Allen, Tanner Gillman, and Matthew Galvan as three teenage boys that snuck onto a farm one day to cow-tip. To their dismay, there were only goats on the farm, but they tried to tip them anyway. The farmer wizard who lived on the farm was angered and half-turned them into myotonic (fainting) goats as punishment. The show always ends in the boys being scared by something and fainting, causing an outburst of canned laughter."
