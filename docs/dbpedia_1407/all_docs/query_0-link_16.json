He has two best selling LP’s under the belt in “Stranger On The Shore” and “Above The Stars” and is currently attracting attention with his latest single “Only You” c/w “A Taste Of Honey.” The Atco label, which is- sues Bilk recordings in the U.S., is releasing, this week, a new “Only You” LP by the gent whose bowler has become his trade mark.

Cash Box Vol. XXIV— Number 22 February 9, 1963 A FRIEND INDEED While pressures of keen compe- tition in the record industry attract one’s attention to new areas and methods of merchandising, all too often the old reliables are over- looked and at times may even be forgotten. But when a soft singles period hits the industry, such as the one we are currently (not) enjoying, everyone seems to count his bless- ing that there is such a phenome- non as the JUKE BOX ... a mecha- nism which must be fed new single records whether the market be soft or swinging. However, it is unfair to think of the juke box as only a steady cus- tomer who must buy records from the disk industry whether he cares to or not. The juke box of today is playing a tremendous role in popu- larizing both singles, albums and artists through many new and in- ventive methods unheard of only a few years ago. New Rock-Ola machines offer a “Featured Star” idea which dis- plays sleeves of singles in the unit, in a sense an advertisement for the specific single displayed. Rowe-AMI machines feature a “Top Talent” program whereby a new disk pack of five 7\" singles at 33 rpm are released each week. The package consists of ten cuts from a top LP plus a color repro scaled to fit the phono’s display space. Seeburg offers an “Album of the Month” feature made up of six selections from an LP (three on a side of a 7\" 33 rpm single) which can be played by the customer by pushing a single button. The ma- chine also features a ten album dis- play panel. Wurlitzer today offers a “Top Ten Tunes” idea whereby the con- sumer can play the top ten hits of the day by pushing a single button. This machine also displays colorful disk sleeves and in addition high- lights “Music Of The Week” a gim- mick which features certain spe- cific selections each week. We are no longer living in an era in which the only attention getting factor in the juke box is the revolv- ing mechanism which always seems to stop on the right number— the one you selected. Today’s new machines are very colorful. They are display master- pieces. They feature 33 and 45 rpm disks. And while attracting the public’s attention they promote songs, records and artists for the music industry. The juke box market should not be considered an outlet to which the industry turns in time of need, in time of soft sales. It is a valuable and progressive field very closely related to the record industry and more eager than ever for any sup- port it can derive from the disk in- dustry.

Sides are “Eternally” and “Swamp Water.” The new label is the product of a distribution and production agree- ment signed last year by the three parties. Ludix maintains its headquarters in New York City at Capitol’s eastern operations offices, 1730 Broadway. Dixon, ofrmer A&R head at Screpter Records, tops A&R as executive pro- ducer, while Project president Simon Rady is handling the business side of the new firm. Lennie McMillan, formerly with Cameo-Parkway Rec- ords, has been named national pro- motion director of the label. (Continued on page 36) NEW YORK — The unveiling of its “Dimensions in Jazz” line (see sepa- rate story for details) and albums by Bobby Darin and Peggy Lee spotlight the release of 16 new LP’s and two re-issues this month from Capitol Records. “JAZZ MOMENTS,” by The George Shearing Trio, featuring the late bassist Israel Crosby and drum- mer Vernel Fournier, is the banner album in the new “Dimensions In Jazz” series. (The long-range modern jazz line also introduces next month qualifies him to direct and supervise this new and vitally important activ- ity.” The creation of the marketing ac- tivity will make for a more cohesive and effective overall operation, with decision-making functions closer to the source of any questions that arise requiring' policy decisions, Racusin said. Also, the exec noted, by co- ordinating all marketing activities into (Continued on page 36) Adler To ASCAP Board After Harbach's Death NEW YORK— Cleffer Richard Adler has been appointed to the board of di- rectors of ASCAP to fill out the term of the late Otto Harbach, the famed lyricist-librettist who died recently at the age of 89 (see last week’s issue). Adler, a member of ASCAP since 1950, is the writer of such musicals as “Pajama Game,” “Damn Yankees,” both in collaboration with the late Jerry Ross, and “Kwamina.” He has also been active in creating musical commercials. Mercury-Wing Issues 6 LP's For Feb. NEW YORK — The low-priced Mer- cury-Wing catalog gets six additional albums this month . They include Sarah Vaughan’s “Sassy,” Louis Jor dan’s “Somebody Up There Digs Me,” Eddie Howard’s “Words of Love,” Jerry Murad’s Harmonicats’ “South American Nights,” Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s “Gospel Train” and “Sweet & Spanish” by The Lourdes, a Span- ish singing group. Tops Files Chapter 11 NEW YORK — Tops Records, one of the pioneer low-priced LP lines, has gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy pro- ceedings, it was reported last week. Cy Leslie, president of Pickwick International, another low-priced LP firm, has been appointed by the Fed- eral Court to administer Tops in conjunction with James Talcott, Inc., one of the biggest commercial lenders in the country and the major Tops creditor. The present management, sales force and clerical staff of Tops will be retained and the firm’s accounts will continue to be serviced without interruption, an announcement said. While efforts will be made to further and to enhance the business of the company, a statement added, where practical, economies will be effected and if needed, service and sales will be improved. Tops personnel will henceforth re- port to Leslie, who will personally supervise all phases of the firm’s ac- tivities. Tops, a subsid of Precision Radia- tion Instruments, acquired the disk- ings of the late Eli Oberstein a year ago, taking over such Oberstein low- priced LP lines as Rondo, Rondo-lette, Ultraphonic, Hudson, Allegro, Acorn, Evon and Galaxie. Tops’ own lines in- clude Golden Tone, Craftsman, Benise, Kimbei'ly and Mayfair. the voice and piano of Jimmie Rowles in KIND A GROOVY! and the big band organ of Joe Bucci in WILD ABOUT BASIE 1). Peggy Lee’s “I’M A WOMAN” takes its title and theme from the blonde vocalist’s click single in the same manner that Bobby Darin groups a batch of country-flavored tunes around his hit, “YOU’RE THE REASON I’M LIVING.” The Lettermen are showcased in a fourth Capitol LP, this one tagged “COLLEGE STANDARDS.” Better- known gospel themes get the Jonah Jones treatment in “THAT RIGHT- EOUS FEELIN’.” Capitol is re-issuing Van Alex- ander’s classic survey of the Swing Era in “SAVOY STOMP,” originally titled “The Home of Happy Feet.” A second re-issue is an LP version of Alan Livingston’s adaptation of Walt Disney’s “Lady and the Tramp,” fea- turing members of the original cast, and supplemented with selections from two other Disney productions, “Icha- bod and Mr. Toad” and “Rob Roy.” (Continued on page 36) CAPITOL SETS JAZZ DRIVE, “DIMENSIONS IN JAZZ” LINE BOWS, 4 JAZZ PERFORMERS INKED HOLLYWOOD — Capitol Records is launching a long-term “full-scale re- emphasis” on jazz. Label is bowing a “Dimensions in Jazz” series this week with three LP’s among its Feb. releases and four jazzists have been inked to the label (see below). This long-range repertoire and mer- chandising specialty will be desig- nated by a special “Dimensions in Jazz” trade-mark, which all upcoming packages in the series will combine with the Capitol logo. Dave Cavanaugh, Capitol’s execu- tive A&R director for album product, stressed the new series will be aimed primarily at exploiting new jazz names. “New in the sense of needing their rightful exposure to the record-buy- ing public,” he explained, “though certainly not new to the jazz scene. All have long-standing reputations on the jazz circuit.” One prominent exception to the “new name” concept, however, is the February release of George Shear- ing’s last sessions with the late bas- sist Israel Crosbv and drummer Vernel Fournier. These trio dates, dubbed “JAZZ MOMENTS,” are sharp jazz departure from recent best-selling Shearing Quintet albums. “Shearing is one of the most re- spected and durable names in modern jazz; so we considered his “JAZZ MOMENTS” a natural and necessary headliner for our jazz line,” Cava- naugh said.

NEW YORK — The Federal Trade Commission’s anti-trust suit against Columbia Records entered its third week last week with representatives of the music publishing business and manufacturers testifying on behalf of the federal government. Representing the pubberies were Mickey Scoop of the Big 3 Music Co., and Hennan Starr of Music Publishers Holding Corp., a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Arnold Maxim, head of MGM Records also testified. The counsel for the FTC asked Scoop if the Columbia Record Club received a discount on royalties paid for material used, and if so, why. Scoop replied that Columbia received a 25% discount because untapped marketing areas would be developed Rondo Capriccioso and Chopin’s An- dante Spianato and Grande Polonaise. The release also includes pianist Ru- dolf Serkin in performances of Bar- tok’s Piano Concerto No. 1 with George Szell conducting the Columbia Symphony Orchestra ; and Prokofieff’s Piano Concerto No. 4, with Eugene Ormandy directing The Philadelphia Orchestra. February’s three new Latin Amer- ican releases in Columbia’s “EX” series are “Sarita Montiel Sings From The Film ‘Pecado de Amor’,” tunes from the star’s latest motion picture; “Besos Brujos — Kisses of Sorcery,” the record debut of an exciting Argen- tine tango singer, Blanca Mooney; and “La Guitarra de Mexico,” the second Columbia LP by Mexico’s famed guitarist, Antonio Bribiesca. HOLLYWOOD — Liberty Records has unveiled a “Follow the Sales Leader” plan for Feb. It’s highlighted by a 15% cash discount off the face of the invoice on all dealer orders of Liberty & Dolton product, including six new Move To Form Promo Assn. NEW YORK — A new music industry association — Recording Industry Pro- motion Association, Inc. — is being- blueprinted in New York. Initiated by Bob Kerr, who is acting executive-director and is head of Kerradio, a programming & promotion service, the organization has been in- corporated in New York state. Kerr has been conducting a series of lunch- eons in New York with various label reps to finalize the set-up of RIPA. At the first two luncheons reps of the following labels formed a steer- ing committee: Amy-Mala, Cadence, Capitol, Colpix, Decca, Dimension, Mercury, MGM, 20th Fox, United Artists’ Victor and Vista. Membership, according to a pro- posed constitution and by-laws, would involve four categories; Voting Mem- bers, who have the exclusive right to vote in all business meetings and elections of the association, with one voting member for each label; Affili- ate Members ; non-voting promo staffer of a label; Allied Members: indie promo men, publishers, artist management agencies, retail stores, distribs, etc. ; Associate Members : reps of businesses allied to the disk industry, including indie disk pro- ducers, industry associations, trade papers, jukebox operators, ad agen- cies, etc. by the club, and that the over all good to be gained by the music industry was just cause for the reduced rate. The government counsel also asked Scoop if the record dealers would be hurt by the operations of a record club, and Scoop replied that dealer- sales were unaffected. The FTC counsel then asked if the Big 3 Music Co. gave the same dis- count to the other record clubs (RCA Victor and Capitol) and Scoop veri- fied that all the record clubs received the same discount on royalties. The publishers representatives were questioned as to the amount of royal- ties paid for free records such as those used for promotion and those given as bonuses to record club mem- bers. Both Scoop and Starr admitted NEW YORK — Decca Records’ “Mar- quee ’63” product release program moves into Feb. with eight albums — five on Decca, three on Coral — that Decca execs feel comprise one of the strongest collections ever released at one time by the label. Sidney N. Goldberg, sales veep, stated that the sales of these eight albums will assure that Feb. will be one of the largest volume months in the history of the company saleswise. Decca factories have been geared for maximum production levels in line with the anticipated volume. Featured in the Decca release are Brenda Lee’s “All Alone Am I,” albums and three re-packaged items. Deal also features a 100% exchange privilege, merchandise exchangeable after July 1, 1963 and deferred bill- ing, with payments scheduled for 'V2 April 10, V2. May 10. Easel displays and ad mats have been prepared and are available from distribs. The new LP’s are: “Latin In A Satin Mood,” Julie London; “The Night Has A Thousand Eyes,” Bobby Vee (named after his hit); “Manhat- tan Beat,” Eddie Heywood; “Best of Timi Yuro,” “Waltz In Jazz Time,” Si Zentner; and “The Power & The Glory,” Voices of the Heavenly Choir. The re-packaged merchandise con- sists of two John Duggy organ LP’s — “I Hear A Rhapsody” and “Carousel Music in HiFi.” Third entry is Dol- ton’s “The Ventures Twist Party, Vol. 2” (former tag was “Dance with The Ventures). C-P Execs-Distribs Meet In N.Y. This Week NEW YORK — Cameo-Parkway Rec- ords holds its national sales meet at New York’s Americana Hotel this Thurs. (7). C-P execs will tell distribs of new releases and future plans. In addition, a number of “surprise” guest speakers will be heard from, an announcement said. that royalties were not paid on pro- motional records that were clearly marked for that purpose, but that royalties were paid on bonus records given away by the record clubs. Scoop, when asked if Columbia paid the royalties on other labels distrib- uted through the Columbia Record club, replied that he did not know. Herman Starr of the Music Pub- lishers Holding Corp. gave substan- tially the same testimony to these questions as Scoop did. Starr agreed with Scoop that the emergence of a record club by Columbia was a stim- ulant to the industry. Starr also in- formed the members of the hearing that his publishing company gave the same 25% discount on royalties to all three record clubs, and that the roy- ( Continued on page 38) which features her title hit plus a bill of standards. Burl Ives’ “Burl,” Earl Grant’s “Midnight Sun” and Carmen Cavallaro’s “Waltzing In The Dark,” which should remind fans of the ivory artist of his almost 20-year-old best- selling Decca album, “Dancing In The Dark.” The Coral sessions are Tiny Little’s “Movin’,” Pete Fountain’s “Plenty Of Pete,” which contains eight tracks, each of 4-6 minutes duration, and “Reminiscing” with the late Buddy Holly. Latter LP contains previously unreleased Holly sides. Since addi- tional musicians were added to the original masters, out before stereo disks, the LP is also available in a true-stereo addition. The new issues are part of an over- all incentive plan being offered to dealers by the label since the debut of ’63 product on Jan. 7. Dealers are to contact their local Decca distribs for details on the plan, which ends Feb. 28. To kick off the release, a task force of Decca execs met in Chicago last week to introduce the Feb. product to all the branch and division managers. The New York contingent included Sydney N. Goldberg, vice-president in charge of sales, Claude Brennan, na- tional sales manager, Lou Sebok, as- sistant national sales manager and Jack Kiernan, sales promotion and Lenny Salidor, director of promotion and publicity. The field managers then returned to their respective branches and held meetings with their individual per- sonnel last Friday (1). Beginning this week (4) the release will be offered to dealers all over the country.

Deck has the sounds that’ll make the platter spinners sit up and take notice. ELVIS PRESLEY (RCA Victor 8134) These two new tunes, from Elvis’ forthcoming pic, “It Happened At The World’s Fair,” should quickly be added to the artist’s fantastic smash collection. One half’s a captivating rock-a-rhythmic weeper tagged “One Broken Heart For Sale” while the companion piece is a soft and extremely pretty sentimental opus titled “They Remind Me Too Much Of You.” The Mello Men, this time, supply the stellar vocal backdrop. (B) “MARGARITA” (2:21) [Spare Rib — Kirkland, Friday, Sarah] This end’s the ‘south-of-the- border’ variety and it also can stir up a heap of attention. Pleasant two- sider. MIKE JARRE'TT (Express 2101) “LETS LIMBO SOME MORE” “TWENTY MILES” (2:15) (2:12) [Wyncote, Kalmann ASCAP — [Kalmann ASCAP — Mann, Appell] Mann, Lowe] CHUBBY CHECKER (Parkway 862) Checker, who’s coming off a two-sider sales-giant in “Limbo Rock” and “Popeye (The Hitchhiker),” can make it a repeat performance with this pairing. On one half he brightly continues the current dance craze as he calls out “Let’s Limbo Some More.” On the other end he happily walks off “Twenty Miles.” Great vocal and instrumental showcase on these two powerhouses. “HE’S GOT THE POWER” (2:32) [Trio BMI— Greenwich, Powers] “DRAMA OF LOVE” (2:20) [Sylvia BMI— Blueston, Medley] THE EXCITERS (United Artists 572) The Exciters, who had a bust-wide-open deck in their initial UA stand, “Tell Him,” continue the exciting pace with this new one. It’s a fantastic driver, tagged “He’s Got The Power,” that never lets up from the opening bar. Great Teacho Wiltshire support on a sure-fire chart entry. Backing’s a dramatic beat-ballad stand. “JUST A SIMPLE MELODY” (2:40) [Ross Jungnickel ASCAP — Tepper, Bennett] “PRETTY BOY LONELY” (2:18) [January BMI— Nader, Radcliffe] PATTI PAGE (Columbia 42671) (B-)-) “DEVIL’S HAND” (2:02) [Merico BMI — Jarrett] Jar- rett has an appealing folk-like way with this haunting, quick moving weeper. Potent vocal-instrumental showcase provided by the Allen K. Roberts Trio. Deejay exposure could send it on its way. (B) “GOLD WEDDING BAND” (2:02) [Merico BMI — Jarrett] The artists warmly blend on this lilt- ing crying towel undercut. ANDRE TALOFF (A.N.R. 250) (C) “THE HAPPY GYPSY” (2:45) [BMI— Taloff] Taloff’s in a happy frame of mind as he runs thi-u this toe-tapper filled with an as- sortment of vocal tricks. Artist ac- companies himself on guitar. (C) “HERE ARE YOU” (2:45) [BMI — Taloff] This slow mov- ing affair finds Taloff ii* a dramatic mood. BILLY STRANGE (Vista 417) Patti Page’s Columbia bow has what it takes for fast chart recog- nition. It’s a very pretty, easy-goin’ sentimental weeper, tabbed “Just A Simple Melody” (not the oldie), that the lark dual-tracks with telling effect. Pine Bob Mersey ork support. The thumpin’ shuffler, “Pretty Boy Lonely,” can also make the chart grade. “THE PUZZLE” (2:09) “CRY BABY CRY” (1:56) [Regent BMI — Dean, Savorese, [Century XXI BMI — Taylor] Crofford] GENE McDaniels (Liberty 55541) McDaniels follows his recent chart outing, “Spanish Lace,” with a release that looks good from both ends. On one side he tries to figure out “The Puzzle” of love in a catchy cha cha beat fashion. On the other end he packs loads of emotion into a driving, steady beat shuffler tagged “Cry Baby Cry.” Top notch assists from the Johnny Mann Singers and Hank Levine’s musicians on both halves. “NO OTHER LOVE” (2:32) “HEARTACHE OH HEART- [Walt Disney ASCAP— Russell, ACHE” (2:43) Weston] [Robin Hood BMI — Crane, Lewis] THE LETTERMEN (Capitol 4914) The Lettermen (Jim, Tony & Bob) turn in two more first rate per- formances on their newest Capitol offering and both rate as hot con- tenders for chartdom. One half’s a lilting love affair (based on the beautiful Chopin “Etude” melody) labeled “No Other Love” (side’s in their “College Standards” LP) while the other’s a touching beat-ballad weeper tabbed “Heartache Oh Heartache.” Fellas’ oh-so-smooth readings are a listening treat. (B-k) “DAY BY DAY” (2:00) [Han- over-Barton BMI — Cahn, Stor- dahl, Weston] The youngsters have a solid reading of the worthy evergreen in both the Strange vocal and rock-a- string setting. This can be a big chart run for the number. (B) “JOHNNY SHILOH” (2:00) [Wonderland BMI — R.M. & R.B. Sherman] Martial sound for a tale of a Yankee drummer during the Civil War. GLORIA LYNNE (Everest 2023) (B-f) “RECORD COMPANY BLUES” (2:55) [Glo-Mor BMI — Lynne] Fine stylist offers a basic blues item with an interesting idea: disk companies don’t make records as long as the one needed to tell this gal’s sad story. Performer is backed by a brisk combo backdrop. (B) “I’LL BUY YOU A STAR” (1:45) [Chappell ASCAP — Fields, Schwartz] Intimate swinging for the lovely showtune, from the score of “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.” ROCKY GUNN (Da-Mar 2005) “THOSE EYES” (2:20) “HUM DIDDY DOO” (2:00) [Travis BMI — Guidry, [Travis BMI — Domino, King] Bartholomew] FATS DOMINO (Imperial 5909) Fats can have his biggest duo in quite awhile with this new Imperial stand. One half, “Those Eyes,” is from the tearful, beat-ballad category. The other, “Hum Diddy Doo,” takes a happy jump-rhythm ride. Fats and his instrumentalists are at their best on this sales-dynamite pairing. (B-h) “SHIRLEY” (2:05) [MKT ASCAP — Kaye] Gunn nicely renders a “Venus”-type affectionate, also done by Tony Orlando on the Epic label. Diskery is a Hollywood outfit. (C-f) “GOTTA TRAVEL ON” (2:30) [Santa BMI — Clayton, Lazar, Six, Ehrlick] A medium-beat reading of the famed folk tune. “I’M A SOLDIER BOY” (2:36) [Conrad-Curtom BMI — Mayfield, Cobbs, Lance] “SHOOK UP OVER YOU” (2:45) [Pamtec BMI— Hunter, Bosley] DEE CLARK (VeeJay 487) Clark can easily regain his winning chart way with this new release. It’s an infectious, shuffle rock sentimental romancer tabbed “I’m Just A Soldier Boy,” that Dee delivers with loads of feeling. Potent ork and (cadence counting) choral support. The tantalizing cha cha beat lover’s lament on the flip also has that healthy chart outlook. NAPOLEON TYCE (Norwood 105) (B) “SITTING HERE” (2:25) [Nu-Lenora BMI — Tyce, Brooks] Good blues plaintive from the singer, whose other vocal assistance includes a male chorus with a deep- voiced chanter. Diskery is a Washing- ton, D.C. operation. (C) “PAPER DOLL” (2:00) [E.B. Marks BMI — Black] Sprightly blues reading of the oldtimer. JIM BOYD (Take Ten 1502) (B-f-) “DON’T ASK FOR MORE” (2:23) [Renda BMI — Fafara] The songster understandingly handles a pretty philosophical romantic (don’t ask for more than love) against a nice rock-a-cha sound. Label is based in Chicago. (B) “VICKI, THIS IS SUSIE” (1:50) [Renda BMI — War- wick] Lively item in which a guy introduces his new flame to his former love. RAUL MARRERO (Estacy 1017) (B) “MICHELE” [Nena ASCAP — Conquet, Concepcion, Mar- rero] Latin dance fans get a reliable mambo sound from the Johnny Con- quet crew, which supports the song- ster’s Spanish vocal. (B) “SIN EGOISMO” [Escobar] This is a slow mambo stint by the same personnel. Note for specialty spot on jukeboxes. DOROTHY COLLINS (Roulette 4479) (B-f-) “SWEETER THAN HONEY (Are Your Kisses)” (2:57) [Northridge ASCAP — Kent, Warren] 'Thrush hops on the Nashville-sound bandwagon with a charming tribute to the loved-one. She’s mostly multi- tracked, and there’s section in which she offers a recitation of part of the lyric. Many dejays are likely to take i\"rnc (B) “THAT SAME OLD STORY” (2:59) [Gil BMI — Levenson, Hamilton] Sad western tale relayed by the lark against a bouncy sound. ARLENE CASEY (Spiral 4392) (B-h) “BOSSA NOVA SCOTIA” (2:12) [Spiral ASCAP — Shelly, Meeks] 'The dance-rhythm craze is the subject of the happy goings-on beneath the sea on this delectable novelty that bows the in- viting stylings of Arlene Casey. Side should attract lotsa deejay activity. (B) “WICKED WESTERN” (2:09) [Spiral ASCAP — Meeks, Shelley] This end gallops in fetching fashion. JIMMY KELLY & THE OP BIRDS (Cevetone 514) (B-h) “THE OP SONG” (2:15) [Dianna ASCAP — Tepper, Bennett Kelly] is joined by speeded- up voices (a la the Chipmunks) on a charming bouncer that’s a good bet to attract a share of the airplay. (B) “THE DREAMY DOLLS OP DUESSELDORF” (2:23) [Dianna ASCAP — 'Tepper, Bennett] This Continental-flavored, all-instru- mental ditty thumps along in carefree style. BROOKS O’DELL (London International 1071) (B-f) “MAI, MAI, MAI” (2:47) [Musicalintra ASCAP — Ar- duini, Intra] Label’s new teen-marker performer invitingly portrays a very pretty affectionate. An organ is fea- tured in the attractive combo-chorus stint. With enough exposure, side could show-up. (B) “FOR YOU ALONE LUCIA” (2:07) [Bixio ASCAP — Con- nor, Lisbona, Bixio] Happy Italian- styled romantic date. GEORGIANA (Alcor 017) (B) “I’VE NEVER NEVER NEVER” (2:00) Arrowhead BMI — Zackeary, Stevens] Lark heads a lively cut about a gal who declares she has never had a love like her present beau. Her voice is over-dubbed and also used for an echo gimmick. Diskery is the Everest Records affili- ate. (B) “HELLO FOOLS” (2:33) [Arrowhead BMI — Zackeary, Stevens] Easy-beat plaintive portion with a Nashville feel. Strings are part of the attractive setting sound. 10 Cash Box — February 9, 1963 BRINGS HIS HAPPY BEAT TO A BRAND-NEW HIT SINGLE COLUMBIA m SINGLES SELL! ©\"COLUMBIAI'HmARCAS res. printed in U.S,A.

It’s a contagious swinger, tagged “Gentleman Jim,” that has a ‘grow on you’ repeating riff. Herbert Rehbein’s violin takes a featured solo slot on the engaging, quick moving “Tipsy Gypsy” delighter. “SHE’LL NEVER LOVE YOU (LIKE I DO)” (2:03) [Dickinson ASCAP — Manning] “THE THRILL IS GONE” (2:16) [MRC BMI— Singleton, Kennedy] TERESA BREWER (Philips 40095) Teresa Brewer should soon be in there battling for chart honors on Maureen Evans’ big English click (cut here on London). Lark’s Philips stand is a cha cha delight that’ll be all over the airwaves in the weeks to come. On the flip the canary shuffles thru a tearful newcomer tabbed “The Thrill Is Gone.” Strong coupler. “SAY TO ME” (1:47) “YOUNG AND IN LOVE” (2:16) [Odin ASCAP— St. John] [Odin ASCAP— St. John] DICK & DEEDEE (Warner Bros. 5342) Dick & Deedee can take a trip to chartland either end, or both, of this new Warner Bros, session.

One half’s the while-back Presley triumph, “Don’t Be Cruel,” that the lark and the ork-chorus dish up in thumpin’, shuffle beat cha cha fashion. The other’s a heartfelt, beat-ballad newcomer, labeled “You Can’t Be Satisfied.” Both ends could ride side-by- side up the hit ladder. “I’M NOT JIMMY” (2:56) [Pogo Geld, Udell] “A LOVE TO REMEMBER” (2:37) [Pogo BMI— Geld, Udell] RAY PETERSON (Dunes 2022) Peterson’s pleasing tones can wrap up another strong chart position via this new Bigtop-distributed Dunes slice.

Backing’s a lovely ballad filter that the platter spinners’ll cotton to. “COMBINATION” (2:35) [Roosevelt BMI— Weiss, Edwards, Jr.] “EVERY STEP” (2:.35) [Conrad, Karland BMI— Williams] THE DUKAYS (Vee.Jay 491) The Dukays, who had Top 100 representation awhile-back with “Nite Owl,” can have another solid money-maker in this new VeeJay offering.

The lark, who in the past has had a couple of answer noise- makers, is currently scoring- with her potent dual-market best-seller of “The End Of The World” (#26 on this week’s Top 100). Skeeter was born in Dr-y Ridge, Kentucky and showed an interest in a singing career in childhood. Her introduction to show business began on TV in Cincinnati and later she did radio and TV in Detroit. The artist started singing as a part of a sister act, the Davis Sisters. The act was broken up by the death of Betty Jack Davis. After a few years, Skeeter started as a single ancl her current Victor biggie looms as her biggest record to date. The artist now lives in Nashville Tennessee, where she is a member of WSM’s Grand Ole Opry as she is married to Ralph Emery, the all-night deejay on WSM. Steve Alaimo Steve Alaimo, who is presently rid- ing the charts with “Everyday I Have To Cry” on Checker, was born in Rochester, New York on December 6, 1940. He is the eldest of six children and attended school in Rochester until the completion of high school. At that time he organized his first profes- sional musical group and decided to take a pre-med course at the Uniyer- sity of Miami. When Steve entered the University of Miami, the three other members of his musical group, the Redcoats, also enrolled. The Redcoats quickly became the top musical and vocal group at the University. The chanter’s first nat'rrnal ex- posure was via Dick Clark’s Amei’i- can Bandstand. Upon his graduation from college, Steve m-ade the decision to shelve the scalpel for a microphone, and finally turned his talents in one major direction, the entertainment field. After a year of working in var- ious clubs around the country, he cut his current hit. The rest is history. Who said the public doesn’t listen to commercials? WWDC-Washington personality Carroll James has always had the theory that people do listen to commercials. So last week, when RCA Victor released an album by the Boston Pops Orchestra in which a medley of familiar commercial jingles was included, James put his theory to test. He held a contest for the WWDC listeners who could correctly identify every commercial. The winner re- ceived a transistor radio. The result: hundreds of letters poured into the outlet’s studios with at least 90% of the commercials correctly iden- tified. Many of the contestants even included commercials that were not played. . . . Because of the tremendous response of its listeners, WWDC’s Dick Clark Show (7 PM to 9 PM, Mon- day thi-u Friday) has added a four- hour stint on Sundays from 4 PM to 8 PM on the outlet. KQUE-Houston went on the air last week with full dimensional stereo- phonic sound on Lou Hanlon’s 6 PM to 10 PM air stanza. The outlet is now the most powei-ful FM-stereo radio station in the southwest and one of the three most powerful in the nation. The stereo progi-amming on KOUE will be backed up into other times as suitable music becomes available. The station, owned and operated by Texas Coast Broad- casters. Inc., operates at a frequency of 102.9 megacycles with a power of 280.000 watts. Plans of this move, according to David H. Morris, prexy, were begun by officers of the broad- casting company in February of 1962 when they realized the steady grow- ing interest of the public in stereo sound. Fun lines — or “unsolicited testi- monials” as they are called, have become a catch-fire fad in Chicagoland and mail has been pouring into WLS at a staggering rate of more than 10.000 cards or letters a week since the on-the-air promotion began three weeks ago. The station started the ball rolling when they combined dra- matic effects, music, and character- voices for unsolicited testimonial spots to be aired during regular pro- gramming hours. The chuckles caught and when WLS offered a silver dollar an hour for the best testimonial, the mail pulled from 13 states. Off-the-air activities are keeping WTRY-Troy afternoon music man John Mounteer hopping. John is seiw- ing as co-chairman of the annual oratorical contest presented by the Albany Council of the Knights of Columbus. He will also act as the emcee for the upcoming Junior Miss Contest presented by the Troy Junior Chamber of Commerce. KOIL-Omaha won top honors last week at the annual convention of Nebraska Broadcasters Association at the state capitol, Lincoln. The award of merit, presented by Ne- braska Civic Organization AK-SAR- BEN (Nebraska spelled backwards), was given to KOIL for “outstanding community service during 1962,” and specifically for the station’s work with the Omaha Boy’s Club. KDKA-Pittsburgh has hit a new high in its annual “Penny-A-Month” fund raising campaign for Children’s Hospital, according to the station’s general manager, L. R. Rawlins. The total for the December drive has reached $22,065.62 at the time of the outlet’s traditional “Thank You Day, ’ January 23. On “Thank You Day,” KDKA officials and talent air their gratitude to the thousands of persons who have contributed in a project that asks for only 12 cents — one penny for each month of the year — from each donor. The 1962 amount repre- sent a 35% increase over the 1961 figure of $16,391. Blue Note thrush Sheila Jordan s recently appeared with Lee Davis on WNCN-FM-New York and Alma John on WWRL-New York, plugging her new LP, “Portrait Of Sheila.” The artist is currently breaking ’em up at Page Three in the Village. j Numerous civic dignitaries and - officials have honored KHJ-Hollywood for the station’s policy of saluting | those cities and communities in the j southern California area. Bruce i Hayes, night deejay on the station, i produces a nightly segment entitled “KHJ Salutes,” in which he singles \\ out one town’s achievements, com- ! munity and civic events. . . . KHJ ' recently devoted a one-hour program -j to the rhubarb between Mayor Sam L | Yorty of Los Angeles and the L. A. P City Council. Former Mayor Fletcher b Bowron and Councilman Timberlake Sj took part in the explosive broadcast, (; produced and announced by KHJ p new chief Allan Moll. V/IL-St. Louis is conducting a pro- motional search for six family pets, j that most resemble the station’s on- the-air personalities. Listeners are being invited to suh^ji photographs of their pets and indicate which WIL personality their pet looks like. The six winners will be feted to dinner for two and the station personalities will “baby-sit” with the winner’s pets. Dick Osgood, WXYZ-Detroit’s mo- tion picture and theatre reviewer, was the man on the phone for Detroit radio, newspaper and tele-vision re- porters as they quizzed Tony Curtis on transcontinental closed circuit television. Osgood relayed the ques- i tions of his colleagues as Detroit par- ticipated with eight other cities in the unique television-telephone session. ) What does the number “25” mean ; ' to you ? That’s how KALL-Salt Lake ; ■ City launched its civic contest for the ; ’ March of Dimes — and response -was j immediate from its listeners. Replies ■■ were read over the air and tied-in ' with the 25th anniversary of the : March of Dimes with various facts p about the organization. When listeners / heard their letters over the air, they were invited to phone in, and they won j various gifts. Orchid Records sends along word that they will re-release their wax of “Mighty John Glenn” to commemorate with the Anniversary of America’s first astronaut to orbit the earth. ‘ Spinners requesting copies should do so on station letterheads by Febi-uary 11, 1963. Requests should be sent to Johnny Snyder, Distribution Dept., Orchid Records, 4139 Bronxwood Avenue, New Y'ork 66, N. Y. Jack Murray, who holds down the 9-12 noon stanza on KFJZ-Fort Worth recently received a letter from the Future Homemakers Club of Weatherford, Texas, asking his help ' in collecting cancelled stamps of all kinds and denominations. The stamps were to be sent to a National Or- ganization called TUBFRIM, who sends the stamps to Norway, where they are sold. All proceeds from the ( sales of the stamns go into research by a Norwegian Tuberculosis Founda- tion. Murray started his appeal on a ‘ Monday and by Friday collected 34,436 stamps. 1 VITAL STATISTICS: V j James Dennis Burton “Reb” Foster ^ given the gi-een light as program di- rector of KRLA-Los Angeles. ...
