        "text": "If you are experiencing a crash in Wirecast, we recommend submitting your support logs to support through Support Assistant (Wirecast > Help menu > Send Support information > Send report).\n\nThis will help gather information that the engineers can use to diagnose problems that may arise.\n\nFor more information on how to use the support assistant, click here.\n\nTo look up your order history, the status of your order, and transaction details, please see the following ecommerce partners depending on your date of purchase.\n\nYou can view transaction details, order history, and receipts for your license, subscription, or Access Plans by going to our ecommerce provider's (2Checkout) Account Management site.\n\n2Checkout – Manage My Account\n\nPlease contact our ecommerce partner, eSellerate, for an order lookup or via email: support@esellerate.net\n\nIf you purchased through a reseller, you will need to contact the reseller to recover your license.\n\nOur software End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) states that you may only have your license activated on one (1) computer at a time.\n\nYou can reset your license by:\n\nDeactivating the license on the original machine and install and activate the license on your second system.\n\nUse our new \"License Reset Tool\" where you have 24/7 access to reset your own license key.\n\nHere is some helpful information on how to deactivate and activate your license.\n\nWirecast – Activate/Deactivate your License/Serial Number Wirecast-Mac\n\nWirecast – Activate/Deactivate your License/Serial Number Wirecast-Windows\n\nYou can run your desktop product on one (1) computer at a time, per our software End User Licensing Agreement (EULA). If you have purchased multiple quantities of the product, you are authorized to install the software on that number of computers.\n\nTo activate your single license on a second computer you must first deactivate the license on the original machine and install and activate the license on your second system. How to deactivate and activate your license.\n\nIf a lecturer installs Remote Desktop Presenter on a laptop, you can broadcast their Keynote or Powerpoint presentation directly from that laptop. If the lecturer is demonstrating something using the laptop (like a 3D graphical animation), Wirecast can also broadcast this to viewers. Other programs including Excel also work perfectly with Desktop Presenter, allowing the speaker to spontaneously refer to data without having to create new slides. For more information, please see our knowledge base article.\n\nFirst you need a Green Screen. There are many variations of this to select from. Wirecast Chroma Key also supports Blue Screen. To get the optimal Chroma Key you want to have the best lighting setup. Here is one way to light a Chroma Key scene:\n\nThe main light (place just to the side of the camera - brightest light). This is what you generally think of as \"lighting\".\n\nThe fill light - so talent has no dark areas/shadows (place on other side of camera - dimmer). This is what keeps your talent from having drop-out areas on them.\n\nThe back light - to light the edges of the talent (place behind talent). This is what cleanly separates the talent from the background.\n\nMost USB webcams should work with Wirecast as long as they are supported by AVFoundation on Mac OS X and DirectShow on Windows. See our list of typical USB/Webcams.\n\nIf you run into problems, please check that you have the most recent versions of the drivers installed on your system. Your webcam maker's website should have details.\n\nYou will need to check that there is a \"DirectShow\" driver when using the camera on Windows, and a \"VDIG\" driver when using on Mac OS X. Very few webcam makers actually create a Mac OS X driver, so please check carefully before purchasing."
