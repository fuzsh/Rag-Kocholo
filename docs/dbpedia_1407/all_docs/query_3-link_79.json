If you have a project open that targets one, but the attached device is different, you may have this problem. The only available option becomes \"Custom Programming Tool\" which isn't helpful.\n\nAfter connecting the correct board, I had to revisit the Tool menu and change the selected debugger/programmer to the appropriate (only) EDBG â€¢ ATML###### option.\n\nIf you're not using an Atmel Xplained board, this may not be applicable."
