        "text": "Switcher Cast is a free screensharing program that allows you to connect a computer's display as an input in the Switcher Studio app. This type of screensharing is useful for sharing presentations, webpages, and programs. This article provides information on accessing and using Switcher Cast for screensharing on a PC.\n\nIn this article:\n\nSwitcher Cast for PC Overview\n\nRequirements for Switcher Cast on PC\n\nAdding Your PC as an Input in Switcher Studio\n\nSwitcher Cast for PC Overview\n\nFor best results, we recommend setting your computer's screen resolution to 1920x1080.\n\nYour computer must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the iOS devices you're using for Switcher Studio.\n\nScreensharing from your computer does not transmit audio. To include audio from your computer, you'll need to use an audio mixer with your production (see External Audio sources for more information).\n\nNote: Switcher Cast for Windows is currently a beta program. We recommend sharing slides, websites, and still images only. Webcams and video playback are not supported for PCs.\n\nRequirements for Switcher Cast on PC\n\nIntel Core i7 dual-core processor\n\nWindows 10, version 1607 or higher (check your Windows version)\n\n8GB DDR4 RAM\n\niTunes must be installed\n\nBonjour must be installed\n\nNote: Switcher Cast cannot be installed onto Chromebooks. In order to screen share with a Chromebook, you will need to use our Remote Guest screensharing method.\n\nInstalling Switcher Cast on your PC\n\nTo install Switcher Cast for Windows:\n\nLog into the Switcher Studio Dashboard.\n\nClick Downloads in the left sidebar.\n\nClick Switcher Cast for Windows.\n\nLocate the downloaded file on your PC (usually your Downloads folder).\n\nRight-click on the SwitcherCastWindows .zip folder.\n\nClick Extract.\n\nThis will allow you to extract the files for installation.\n\nYou will see a new folder named SwitcherCastWindows that is uncompressed.\n\nDouble-click on the new folder named SwitcherCastWindows.\n\nDouble-click the Installer in the SwitcherCastWindows folder.\n\nA windows pop-up will appear. Click More Info.\n\nClick Run Anyway option.\n\nThe installer will appear on the screen for a few seconds, then disappear. It will create a Switcher Cast icon on your desktop.\n\nAdding Your PC as an Input in Switcher Studio\n\nDouble-click the Switcher Cast icon on your Desktop.\n\nA small, white box will appear on your screen, which means Switcher Cast is open and running.\n\nOpen the Switcher Studio app on the main switcher (i.e. iPad, iPhone).\n\nTap the Inputs tab (camera icon).\n\nUnder Sources on Your Wi-Fi Network, you should see a Desktop option.\n\nTap the Desktop name to enable it as an Input in your production. Once enabled, a blue checkmark will appear next to it, and it will show up in your Sources panel.\n\nDisplaying Your PC on the Live Feed\n\nOnce you have the PC connected as an input on the main switcher, it can be displayed in the production. It is a good idea to have your computer showing the content you would like to display before selecting the PC in the live feed.\n\nTo display the your PC in the live feed:\n\nClick the Switcher Cast input in the Sources panel.\n\nThe Switcher Cast input will display in the live feed."
