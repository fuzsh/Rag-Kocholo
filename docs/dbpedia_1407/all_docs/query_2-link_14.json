        "text": "Producers also reach out to local musicians across the country and ask them to audition, according to season 1 contestant Vicci Martinez. \"What I realized is they wanted to make it a show that had real artists, people who were serious about doing music and not just people who sing in the bathroom,\" Martinez told Cosmopolitan.\n\nAfter passing the virtual casting call, it's not time to sing in front of the A-list gang just yet. The pool goes from thousands to hundreds during . That's where producers listen to live performances and determine the TV-ready group of contestants they'd like to bring onto the show.\n\nSome singers who don't make it to the blind auditions return for another chance in later seasons. Ddendyl Hoyt tried out for season 5 and didn't make the cut, but she came back and joined Shakira's team the following year.\n\nSeason 6's Kat Perkins revealed that the show provided her with training on every scenario imaginable, from getting sick onstage to handling social media attention. This seems to be something that the show has implemented over time, as season 1 contestants didn't recall receiving such training.\n\nIt may seem like the coaches listen to hundreds of singers in a single day on TV, but it's actually not that many. Blind auditions tape \"for five or six days with approximately 18 to 20 auditions per day,\" former executive producer Audrey Morrissey revealed to SheKnows.\n\nIf a contestant is lucky enough to see two (or even all four!) coaches turn around, the decision that comes next is pretty difficult. Performers have to pick the coach they want to work with the most.\n\nWhile it's not exactly a rule, it is pretty fun. The stars often have a few tricks up their sleeve from season to season. When fighting over the same singer, they'll often pull out all the stops to get someone to choose their team. From custom apparel to emotional serenades, they've tried everything.\n\nFor the most part, coaches select the songs throughout the season — even if the contestants don't always agree. \"It's always hysterical when the judges say, 'I don’t think that was a good song choice for you,' and I'm thinking, You picked that song,\" season 1's Frenchie Davis told Cosmopolitan.\n\nCoaches want to see their teams succeed, and more often than not, they make the right call. \"Sometimes he suggested things that I wouldn’t have done and then they ended up being big moments for me,\" season 16 winner Maelyn Jarmon said of John Legend when the two spoke to Country Living about the experience.\n\n\"I told her, I said, '['Hallelujah'] is gonna be the most streamed song of the finale,'\" John recounted. \"I was right about that.\"\n\nThe chairs aren't as loud as they appear to be on TV. That \"whoosh\" sound that happens when a coach hits their button and spins around? \"It's [added] in postproduction! You almost don't notice it, especially when you're focusing and singing to the crowd that's in the studio,\" Perkins told Cosmopolitan."
