        "text": "This review is going to focus on a cooking-based game show known as Guy’s Grocery Games\n\nBroadcast History: The show premiered in October 2013 on Food Network. It is still currently airing and is available via On Demand (at least with Comcast/XFinity).\n\nPersonnel: Guy Fieri (the host of NBC’s version of “Minute to Win It”) serves as the host here. Three judges rotate for each episode.\n\nRules of the Show: The contestants (4 at the start) compete in elimination style challenges each round (where the worst performer is eliminated). All of the main rounds consist of cooking dishes for the judges. These challenges may consist of any or all of the following: shopping in only 2 of the aisles of a fictitious supermarket (think like a “Supermarket Sweep” type set), bag swap (where contestants pick any ingredients they wish, but are not told until done shopping that they actually picked the ingredients for his or her opponent), or Out of Stock (where normal ingredients for a recipe would be out of stock and require the contestant to improvise). An example of the “Out of Stock” game would be if the contestants have to cook a Mexican dinner, then the store is out of taco shells, tortillas, and all beef.\n\nWhen the game gets to one contestant, that contestant is given a chance to win $20,000 cash. They are given a list of 10 items to find in the market with a total of only 2 minutes to get the items in the cart. Each item found is worth $2,000 (with it being a total of $20,000 if all 10 items are found and placed in the cart). Some items are obvious (i.e. canned oysters) while other items are more open-ended (i.e. a clear soda or something needed for salad).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 47/50 [This show has different elements to keep it interesting. It does borrow some elements from Supermarket Sweep, but the show adds enough spin on them to make the show its own. I am always curious as to how the contestants are going to work through the challenges and what they are going to make.]\n\nHost: 23/25 [Fieri is still excitable as he was with Minute to Win It. However, he makes the show his own and enjoys doing it. He is usually good with any of the food shows (i.e. Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives)].\n\nPrizes: 22/25 [$20,000 is a respectable top prize for a cable game show. Keep in mind that the show is on Food Network (which is just maybe a top 20 cable network). Most contestants who win on this show actually do get at least $10,000 (5 of the 10 items).\n\nOverall Grade: 92/100 [One of the better shows to premiere in 2013. I think the show will continue into 2014.]\n\nThis review is going to focus on the 2013 version of Minute to Win It.\n\nBroadcast History: The show premiered in June 2013 on GSN. 30 episodes have aired (yet there are 10 more taped that have to still air). It is still undecided whether a second season of this version will air. Clips are available on YouTube, while GSN does currently show repeats of this version.\n\nPersonnel: Apolo Anton Ohno (famous Olympic speed skater, Dancing With the Stars trophy holder, and frequent Subway spokesman) serves as your host here. The show is produced by Shine Media (who is responsible for shows such as “Biggest Loser” and “Masterchef”).\n\nRules of the Show: The show has very similar rules to the NBC version of 2010-2011 hosted by Guy Fieri.\n\nThis version gives 3 lives to teams of 2 (often related or already know each other). There are still 10 blueprints to complete (but the maximum payout is now $250,000)\n\nPayouts:\n\nLevel 1 = $1,000 [Guaranteed]\n\nLevel 2 = $2,000\n\nLevel 3 = $3,000\n\nLevel 4 = $5,000\n\nLevel 5 = $10,000 [Guaranteed]\n\nLevel 6 = $15,000\n\nLevel 7 = $25,000 [Guaranteed]\n\nLevel 8 = $50,000\n\nLevel 9 = $100,000\n\nLevel 10 = $250,000 [Top Prize]\n\nJust like the NBC version (or the MundoFox version for Spanish speakers), losing all 3 lives knocks you down to your guarantee, but you may quit before attempting a blueprint for the first time.\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 40/50 [The show does seem to streamline better (or move quicker) than the NBC version. Stunts do not seem to repeat as frequently. Production values seem to have stepped up.]\n\nHost: 13/25 [I’ll make this part short, since “every second counts”. I know that Ohno is trying to build up drama, but it comes across as fake and insults the audience/contestants at the same time. I didn’t know the show was hosted by Captain Obvious.\n\nPrizes: 19/25 [$250,000 is a very good top prize for GSN, but most teams are able to walk out with only $10,000 or so. This plagued the NBC version too, as no one could ever complete Super Coin.]\n\nOverall Grade: 72/100 [C] [The show does some things right, but the host is the downfall here. This is where the guy who hosts the Spanish version here in the states would have been better suited. I wonder what “every second counts” translates to in Spanish.]\n\nBroadcast History: This show premiered in April 2013 on ABC (Saturday Night Primetime) and was cancelled in June. A total of 8 episodes aired. The show is very difficult to find even on YouTube (but I did watch the first episode when it originally aired).\n\nPersonnel: The show was hosted by Melissa Peterman (best known for “Reba” and the CMT version of “Singing Bee”).\n\nRules of the Show: 5 sets of parents (each set with a toddler aged 2 to 3 years old) compete for cash to put for their kid’s college fund.\n\nEach set of parents are given a task for their child to attempt in “The Baby Dome” (a backstage area designed like a kid’s playroom). The parents will predict whether or not their kid can complete the task or how well they will perform it (depending on the task). A correct prediction earns the family $5,000 cash.\n\nAfter all 5 families play one task, they play against another in one final task. The toddlers are all placed in the “Baby Dome” and must remove stuffed animals to reveal puzzle pieces (rebus style). The first parent to solve the puzzle moves on to the bonus round to earn more money.\n\nIn the final round, 10 piggy banks are placed onstage. The parents have an opportunity to break up to 5 of the banks (each containing money to add to the college fund). Here are the piggy bank amounts: $500; $1,000; $2,500; $5,000; $7,500; $10,000; $15,000; $20,000; $25,000; and $50,000. When an amount is revealed, they are given the choice to give the money back and go for another amount or keep what was won. $50,000 is the top prize for the show.\n\nNote: All families received a $1,000 gift card to Wal-Mart and a year’s supply of Luvs Diapers win or lose.\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 10/50 [The show didn’t feel original or fair to me. In fact, I felt the show exploited the kids. How are these parents going to treat their toddler who can’t remove stuffed animals quick enough when he or she may have cost them $50,000? The tasks were rather bland and unimaginative, yet it didn’t matter whether the tasks were completed.]\n\nHost: 19/25 [Melissa is a decent host here, but she did better with CMT’s “Singing Bee”. She didn’t seem as interested in this game.]\n\nPrizes: 16/25 [$50,000 doesn’t seem like a decent top prize for a network prime-time show. But at least all families earned something useful such as money to Wal-Mart and diapers.]\n\nOverall Grade: 45/100 [F] (One of the most unimaginative, boring formats to come out this year. Hopefully, Melissa has other work to go do besides this in the future.)\n\nThis review is focused on the true definition of “Flop” known as The Rich List\n\nBroadcast History: The show aired once on November 1, 2006 on FOX. It is only the second time in TV history that a game show has been cancelled after airing only one episode (CBS’s “You’re In the Picture” hosted by Jackie Gleason in the 1960s was the first.). 6 episodes were taped of the Rich List, with this being the only time this version of the show has aired.\n\nPersonnel: British game show host Eamonn Holmes was the host here (his only show in the USA).\n\nRules of the Game:\n\nTwo pairs of complete strangers face one another. Both teams are placed in soundproof-isolation booths that can have the audio turned on or off by Holmes. A category is announced (such as Tom Cruise movies). The teams bid back and forth (think a version of the Bid-a-Note from “Name that Tune” but going higher with the bid instead of lower). When a team thinks they can’t name any more than the current bid or thinks the other team is bluffing, they may challenge. Satisfying the bid earns the team a point, while failing gives the other team the point. The first team to 2 points wins.\n\nIf each team scores 1 point, a sudden-death list is played. Both teams alternate giving an answer, with the first team to give an incorrect answer loses the game.\n\nIn the Bonus Round, another category is given (such as “Animated films released by Disney or Pixar”). A maximum of 15 correct answers can be given to the list. Every 3 correct answers increases the amount of money won.\n\n3 correct answers = $10,000\n\n6 correct answers = $25,000\n\n9 correct answers = $75,000\n\n12 correct = $150,000\n\n15 correct = $250,000\n\nAfter every 3 correct answers are given, the team may stop and take the money since a wrong answer loses any money earned for that list. Either way, the team continues to play until they lose in the main game (at least that’s what would have happened if more than one episode had aired).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 44/50 [This show had the playability factor. I actually remember watching this show when it aired and guessing answers with the contestants.]\n\nHost: 23/25 [I am shocked that Eamonn Holmes hasn’t hosted another show in the States. He had a good command of the game, wanted contestants to do well, and had some obvious talent.]\n\nPrizes: 18/25 [The show would have had a higher ranking if the show lasted beyond one episode. The winnings would have been limitless.]\n\nKrypton Factor: I am awarding 5 bonus points to the show for 2 reasons. First, the show did have success in other countries (usually as “The RIch List” or “Who Dares Wins”). Second, this is the only show I can think of to have been cancelled after one episode and then revived for another network. GSN retitled the show “The Money List” (as part of its Big Saturday Night back in 2009. Fred Roggin hosted that version played for lower stakes but still had the returning champions).\n\nOverall Grade: 90/100 [A-] (WTF? How could FOX cancel a show after one episode? This show and host deserved better.)\n\nThe next review in this month for Primetime Flops is known as “Show Me The Money”\n\nBroadcast History: The show aired November to December 2006 on ABC. Out of the 7 episodes taped, 5 episodes aired in its original run. GSN aired the show in June 2007 after picking up the repeats, but only 2 episodes aired here. There are some clips on YouTube along with the first episode aired on GSN.\n\nPersonnel: The show was hosted by William Shatner. He was backed up by his “Million Dollar Dancers” (2 of which include: Julianne Hough from “Dancing with the Stars” and Eve Torres. Eve is a former WWE Diva.)\n\nRules of the Show:\n\nBefore the show, scrolls are distributed between 12 of “The Million Dollar Dancers”). These scrolls contain amounts from $20,000 to $220,000 (in increments of $20,000) plus a $250,000 scroll. In addition, one scroll is known as the “Killer Card”. I will cover how that scroll works later.\n\nOn each question, the first half of the phrase is given. By picking choices A, B, or C, it will complete a question. A contestant may pass after viewing the question (but it is out of play). When only one choice remains, the contestant must answer the question.\n\nIf the question is answered right, the amount of the scroll is added to the player’s score. If the question is answered wrong, the scroll’s amount is subtracted from the player’s score.\n\nIf a killer card is revealed, the current question is thrown out. A sudden-death question is asked with no options to pass. A right answer keeps you in the game, while the wrong answer eliminates you from the game with no money.\n\nThe object of the game is to get six correct answers before getting six wrong. A contestant is not allowed to quit until one of these options occur (or if a sudden death question from a killer card is answered wrong). If a contestant gets 6 right or 6 wrong, then they win whatever money is left in their bank (which has a maximum of $1,150,000).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 25/50 [The vibe with this show is that it is to feel more like a Spanish-language variety show (especially a show like Sabado Gigante). Unfortunately, this show is played for very high stakes and the seriousness of the money involved doesn’t match the quirkiness of the show. The casting of contestants on this show was atrocious. They were often annoying as hell.\n\nHost: 0/25 [The show…is so terrible…because the man who talks…like the wheelchair kid from Malcolm in the Middle…is your host. He seems to make the show all about him.]\n\nPrizes: 20/25 [As I stated earlier, the prize money is too high for this show. So a contestant can win over $1,000,000 by answering only 6 questions correctly. The stakes should have been divided by 10 for this show.]\n\nOverall Rating: 45/100 [F] (Ultimately, this is prove that Shatner shouldn’t quit his day job. The show was played for laughs and fun, rather than a somewhat cerebral affair. No wonder it didn’t last.)\n\nThe next review in the Primetime Flop Month is Identity\n\nBroadcast History: The show aired on NBC from December 2006 until April 2007. The show is available to watch on YouTube and has not otherwise been repeated since the original airing.\n\nPersonnel: Penn Jillette (of Penn and Teller) is your host here.\n\nRules of the Show:\n\n12 people are placed on pedestals on the stage. The object of the game is to have one contestant predict correctly the “identities” of 11 of the 12 people on pedestals. The identities might be to guess what they are famous for (such as knowing who was the celebrity blogger or Perez Hilton in that case) or something based on looks/dress alone.\n\nFor each correct answer, the contestant moves up a money ladder:\n\n1 correct = $1,000\n\n2 correct = $5,000\n\n3 correct = $10,000\n\n4 correct = $15,000\n\n5 correct = $25,000\n\n6 correct = $50,000\n\n7 correct = $75,000\n\n8 correct = $100,000\n\n9 correct = $150,000\n\n10 correct = $250,000\n\n11 correct = $500,000 (The Top Prize)\n\nTwo helps are given along the way (in addition to some other rules to help the contestant). The first help is known as the “Tri-dentity” (this narrows the choice down on one identity to three people). The contestant must either pick one or quit immediately after using this help. The help is taken away if not used when only 4 identities remain. The second help is known as “asking the experts” (which consists of 3 people such as a body language expert, psychologist, and an FBI behavioral expert). The experts may be used at any point in the game one time (even for the final 2 identities).\n\nSome other ways the contestant is helped include “the mistaken identity” (where a contestant can be incorrect once in the game without losing all earned money). That rule is not in effect when only 2 identities remain. Family members and friends may help the contestant after the 4th identity is chosen correctly. The audience may also help out the contestant in any way possible at any time (think similar to suggesting bids on The Price is Right in Contestant’s Row).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 40/50 [To be frank, the show is very similar in style to shows like “I’ve Got a Secret”, “To Tell the Truth”, and “Figure it Out”. I do like how some contestants with special talents are asked to demonstrate the right answer when possible. However, the show does drag on and takes frequent commercial breaks for no reason.]\n\nHost: 20/25 [Penn can be fine as a host, but there are other times that he needs to be more like his magic partner named Teller. For those who don’t know where I’m going with this, Teller is always the one who DOES NOT speak in the act. However, I will give Penn credit since he doesn’t seem fake and wants to have the contestant do well. He even goes as far to point out obviously wrong identities before a contestant locks in whenever possible.]\n\nPrizes: 20/25 [While $500,000 is a great top prize, I also felt it was too easy to win. In only a matter of the 12 episodes aired, 3 contestants won the top prize. Only 2 contestants left the game with no money while many left with at least $50,000 cash.]\n\nOverall Rating: 80/100 [B-] (This show could have worked as a daytime show with lower stakes. I think a top prize of $50,000 would have been better with a safe haven of $5,000 for getting 5 identities correct. I would have had only 10 people, but 11 identities on my version of the show.)\n\nThis review will focus on the short-lived reality based trivia game show entitled Studio 7\n\nBroadcast History: 8 episodes were shown on the WB Network throughout the summer of 2004. All 8 Episodes are easily available on YouTube. (Thanks to thewhammy83).\n\nPersonnel: The show was hosted by Pat Kiernan (also known for “The World Series of Pop Culture” and GSN’s “Grand Slam”). Michael Davies was the producer of this show (see such shows as “Millionaire” and the more recent versions of “Chain Reaction” and “Pyramid”).\n\nRules of the Game/About the Show:\n\nThe show has 7 contestants (mostly college-age) who live together in New York City for 4 days prior to the actual show. They are able to sum up each others’ knowledge and personality.\n\nDuring the actual show, a series of 6 rounds are played in which one contestant is eliminated after each round.\n\nRound 1: Asks questions about 21st Century events (The questions asked are in multiple choice format, though the choices are edited out in the show).\n\nRound 2: Questions about 2004 (The year the show taped/aired)\n\nRound 3: Questions about Events 30 Days prior to taping\n\nRound 4: Specialized Subject: Materials given in advance to prepare\n\nRound 5: Reciting Items in a List in Order (This list is given to them in advance).\n\nRound 6: Questions about Events 7 Days prior to taping\n\nContestants are chosen to randomly start each round. A question is asked. A correct answer keeps the contestant in the game. A wrong answer means that contestant can be voted out in the round. However, each contestant is given a ring that can be thrown into “The Pool of the 7”. The ring symbolizes a lifeline that can be used one time in the game to ask any other contestant for help. The “helping” contestant may give the correct answer, the wrong answer, or no answer at all. When 2 contestants in the first 3 rounds get an answer wrong, the remaining players vote one out (think like “Weakest Link” except votes are given orally).\n\nIn round 4, the first player to get a question wrong is automatically eliminated. This is the last round that the ring can be used.\n\nIn round 5, an extensive list is given in advance for the players to memorize (i.e. The Names of Presidents, with types of pets and pet names; that particular list had 116 items to name). If a person messes up once, their turn is over. The other 2 contestants go off stage while the other has their turn. The person who does the worst (either least number of items correct or slowest time if needed) is eliminated.\n\nIn round 6, questions from pop culture are asked based on the 7 days previous to the taping. The winner of round 5 gets the choice of going first or second. The person who answers 7 questions correctly in the faster time wins $77,000 cash and comes back for episode 8.\n\nEpisode 8 has the 7 previous winners come back and play the game again. The winner here takes a bonus prize of $777,000 cash (for a total winnings of $854,000).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 43/50 [The show did steal some elements from Weakest Link with the voting off. However, the show was interesting to watch. The show does give a little backstory into the contestants without overdoing it. Strategy was just as important as the knowledge here. I will say that round 5 is insane though.]\n\nHost: 24/25 [Pat Kiernan does his usual good job hosting here. He seems like the straight man for hosting a trivia based game show.]\n\nPrizes: 23/25 [For the WB to even give a $77,000 guaranteed cash prize is excellent. Keep in mind that at the time they were a 5th or 6th ranked broadcast network with a smaller budget. However, I think offering the top prize of close to a million dollars guaranteed was too much for them based on the show’s ratings.]\n\nKrypton Factor: This is the only show I can remember that was a serious trivia quizzer that had a pool in the middle of it. The production and set design was remarkable (especially for a show on WB). Therefore, I am going to award 5 bonus points.\n\nOverall Grade: 95/100 [A} [The show could have lasted longer with better ratings. This show had promise but could have had some variety in contestants though.]\n\nThis review will focus on “Let’s Make a Deal”. I will note that this particular review will only focus on the 2003 version of the show.\n\nBroadcast History: The show aired on NBC for 3 weeks (3 episodes) in March 2003. One episode is available on YouTube.\n\nPersonnel: Billy Bush (of “Access Hollywood”) is your host here. Vance Degeneres (Ellen’s brother) is your announcer/co-host. The three models were: Vanessa Minillo (aka Vanessa Lachey of “Wipeout”), Nicole Pulliam (at that time was known for being a Juggy dancer on “The Man Show”), and Jayanna Wolfe (a complete unknown even after searching IMDB, Google, and Wikipedia). Monty Hall (the original host of the previous versions) serves as Executive Producer here.\n\nRules of the Game: The rules are very similar to other versions. People “come dressed as they are” in the crazy costumes with hopes of walking away with cash, trips, cars, and prizes while avoiding the Zonks. The Big Deal is played the same way as Monty’s versions (2 traders for 3 curtains).\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 30/50 [While I love the original Monty Hall versions and the current one with Wayne Brady, I felt something was missing in the gameplay here. They were going for the adult-nature variety (like Steve Harvey’s “Family Feud”) when it has almost always been a family-friendly show. In one deal from the first episode, two married couples play the deal. The two guys are given info about a potential deal from three hot-looking foreign correspondents who talk in their native tongues while flirting with the men. A second deal had three women reaching up men’s clothes to figure out what their potential deals were. Furthermore, the zonks are outright cruel. In one deal, five contestants “won” a car only to have a wrecking ball dropped on it as the zonk.]\n\nHost: 13/25 [Billy Bush is simply there. I feel that Vance might have made a better host here (though that wouldn’t be saying much). He is unemotional and doesn’t have any energy when this game requires it. In the first episode, Monty Hall is shown on camera giving tips to Bush in a skit going to a commercial break. Obviously, Bush went for the curtain when he should have taken the offer Hall was giving him. Bush received a zonk.]\n\nPrizes: 22/25 [This is the one saving grace of the show. A contestant who went for the Big Deal is almost guaranteed to earn a better deal. The lowest deal is around $10,000 in cash/prizes. The middle deal is around $25,000 in cash/prizes. The Big Deal was often over $50,000. While this Big Deal would be the biggest of any LMAD versions, this still feels cheap at times.]\n\nOverall Grade: 65/100 [C-] [The show had a lot of promise. If they had got a different host and didn’t do the risque stunts, this would have had more success. This is exactly why the current version on CBS works well and is at times equal or better to the Monty Hall versions.]\n\nThis review is of the very short-lived The Chamber\n\nBroadcast History: The show aired only 3 episodes in January 2003 on FOX. One complete episode (the premiere) is available on YouTube.\n\nPersonnel: Rick Schwartz (correspondent for “Extra”) was your host. Dick Clark’s production company was behind this show.\n\nRules of the Show: To start out, 2 contestants (a male and a female) face off against each other. A category is given (such as the 12 signs of the Zodiac). Contestants go back and forth to give a correct answer. A point is earned only when the other contestant gives a wrong answer or runs out of time and the other contestant gives a right answer to the category. 2 points puts you in the chamber.\n\nWhen a contestant is strapped into “The Chamber”, electrodes, muscle contractors, and medical equipment are attached to them. In the three episodes, either a hot or cold mode is set to the chamber for that contestant. That contestant must sign a waiver onstage or can take $500 cash to leave the game.\n\nThe object in the chamber is to answer questions (both of a multiple choice or open ended variety) while dealing with any elements in the Chamber. Each question is worth $1,000 for a correct answer. There are 5 ways in which the game can end:\n\n1) A contestant gets 2 questions wrong consecutively.\n\n2) The contestant’s “Stress Quotient” goes into the danger zone (think like the Chair’s “Red-Line”) for over 20 seconds. Blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature determine that quotient for each player.\n\n3) A doctor on stage determines the contestant can no longer continue the game.\n\n4) The contestant gives up by stating “Stop the Chamber”\n\nNote these 4 ways cost the contestant half of the earned money.\n\n5) A contestant makes it through all 7 levels of The Chamber which each last 1 minute and get more difficult. This contestant will keep all earned money. However, if a contestant does this and answers at least 25 questions correctly, then the money is tripled.\n\nIf you are curious:\n\nBoth Chambers: Muscle contractors get stronger throughout the game. A simulated earthquake will shake the player (starts out at 5.0 on the Richter Scale in level 1, eventually will become a 9.5 on that scale). Wind gusts appear at level 4 that are approximately 55 MPH. Oxygen level in the chamber will also drop (starting at 100% and eventually to about 50%).\n\nThe Hot Mode: Temperatures start at 110 degrees Fahrenheit and will rise to a maximum of 170 degrees through the game. The chair rotates starting at level 2 from a 90 degree tilt to eventually spinning in complete circles in later levels. Foul odors are also piped in starting at level 4. Air cannons shoot at the player at over 100 MPH.\n\nThe Cold Mode: Temperatures start at 30 degrees Fahrenheit and will drop to a low of -20 degrees by level 7. This mode does not rotate the player, but will shoot water and ice at the player in increasing amounts.\n\nReview of the Show:\n\nGameplay: 0/50 [This show had no variety. We had a 50/50 guess as to what chamber we would see. The opening round between 2 players was tacked on. These two chambers that were used were dangerous and could have killed someone for ratings. Supposedly, three other chambers were to be used in the unaired episodes: an electroshock mode, water torture mode, and an insect mode)\n\nHost: 0/25 [The show was hosted by Rick “Captain Fucking Obvious” Schwartz. I call him that because he was unemotional, didn’t care about the show, and only stated the obvious to the injured contestants (i.e. “you’re burning” after the female contestant comes out of the hot chamber).\n\nPrizes: 0/25 [The show seems ridiculously cheap. The highest any contestant won in the three aired episodes was only $20,000 (with surviving all 7 levels). First, all of the contestants probably ended up with just enough money to pay the hospital bills or recover. In fact, one contestant sued (the only one to survive the 7 levels in the cold chamber). That contestant was given $100,000 additional to settle out of court.\n\nOverall Grade: 0/100 [H] Here’s the dreaded “H” grade again (go check out my review of the kid’s game show “Peer Pressure”). If I wanted to give negative points here, I would. At least “Peer Pressure” didn’t risk anyone’s lives (careers, maybe?). I even gave a single point to “Thousand Dollar Bee”. There is a reason that someone with more talent in one finger as a host (Matt Vasgersian) turned this show down. It’s sickening! This is as close as you will ever get to having something like “The Running Man” ever becoming a real-life game show (except Killian or Richard Dawson would have made a better host while 6 feet under)."
