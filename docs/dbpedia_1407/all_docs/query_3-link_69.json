        "text": "There is no \"auto-tune\" in Sonar/Cakewalk.\n\nThe flanger you've highlighted does seem to be DOA. Skip it and continue down the list to \"Cakewalk > Flangerâ€¦\" and it will open.\n\nJust below 'Cakewalk' is 'Sonitusfx' so you already have those too, tho I don't see a flanger there.\n\nTo install plugins (dll files), just place them in the Cakewalk VST folder and run a scan to pick them up.\n\nTo install plugins (exe files), just double click the file and run the installer.\n\nAlso, the \"Process\" menu will 'permanently apply the effect to the audio clip. It may be better to add the flanger to the FX bin first so you can play with the settings nondestructively. Once you've settled on the right settings then you can \"process\" it if you want.\n\nEdited March 19, 2019 by sjoens\n\nThe latest, free version of Cakewalk includes the Sonitus plugins. You can install this side by side with your current version to try it out. https://www.cakewalk.com/Documentation?product=Cakewalk&amp;language=3&amp;help=Plug-ins.1.html\n\nAny plugins installed by the latest Cakewalk should then be available to Home Studio, and vice versa.\n\nCakewalk by BandLab will not replace Home Studio, but is a more feature rich, much more up to date version of Sonar, including all of the core functionality of the last Sonar Platinum version. Plus it is currently supported and updated by the BandLab team.\n\nEdited March 18, 2019 by abacab\n\nthanks for the reply, but as I stated above I'm not looking to upgrade now...and I already have the Sonitus plugin ...again I'm not sure how to install it, which I was also asking about. If you could tell me how to even istall it that would be helpful...thanks\n\nthanks for all the input. I think there was no flange in cakewalk either, but I will check again.\n\nAlso thanks for the info on how to install, I found my original manual, and it doesn't say anywhere in there how to do it.\n\nI also downloaded a couple of phone apps that do the auto tune effect perfect, I am going to play around with those as well, then just import the audio into sonar."
