        "text": "Ken Jennings\n\nAmerican game-show host\n\nThis BYU graduate and software engineer won a record 74 consecutive Jeopardy! matches before going on to become one of the game show’s hosts in 2021.\n\nWho is Ken Jennings?\n\nOr more precisely, Kenneth Wayne Jennings III, born May 23, 1974, in Edmonds, Washington.\n\nThe makings of a Jeopardy! nerd\n\nJennings is the oldest of four children born to attorney Kenneth Wayne Jennings, Jr., and elementary-school librarian Catherine Jennings. In a 2023 interview with Encyclopædia Britannica, Jennings described his parents as “bright people, big readers, fast talkers” and himself as “a weird information sponge” as a kid. He was obsessed with reading reference books, including The Guinness Book of World Records, encyclopedias, and atlases. “[The] library would never let you take home the books I wanted to read the most. I got annoyed that I couldn’t check out reference books.”\n\nHis other childhood obsession: game shows. The family moved from Washington state to South Korea when he was seven for his father’s job. There the family had access to one English-language television channel, the Armed Forces Korea Network, which aired Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy!\n\nThe family spent a decade in South Korea, during which time Jennings recognized that one of his strengths was being “a weirdly curious kid who remembered stuff. I was a pretty solid 10-year-old Trivial Pursuit player.” But the idea of ever being a contestant on the game shows he watched religiously never occurred to him.\n\nCollege and quiz bowl\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nJennings, who was raised in a devout Mormon family, attended college at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle and Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah. He served a two-year religious mission in Madrid between attending UW and BYU. He graduated from BYU in 2000 after majoring in English and computer science. But it was a flyer for the college quiz bowl team that changed his life. As he got more involved in quiz bowl, traveling to tournaments around the country, he began to recognize players on Jeopardy! as people he had met during quiz bowl competitions. “It struck me that it was the farm team for Jeopardy!”\n\nLife as a Jeopardy! contestant\n\nIn 2003, while on a road trip with a friend, Jennings auditioned for Jeopardy!, which at the time did not allow champions to appear in more than five games. But by the time Jennings appeared in his first Jeopardy! game on June 2, 2004, the show had, in a bid to boost ratings, retired the five-show maximum rule. Contestants could now play as many games as they could win.\n\nAnd boy did Jennings win. He wracked up $37,201 in the first game, and over the course of the next 74 he would buzz in with the correct answer some 2,700 times and earn $2.52 million in winnings.\n\nHe describes being a contestant as “a very intense experience that TV does not convey” but notes that the longer the streak went, the more comfortable he got. “It just became a ride,” he says, adding that there is a “strong home-court advantage” for returning champions. He also concedes the role that luck played in his run: “I should not have won 74 games. I was pushing the laws of probability.” The answer that stumped Jennings and ended his run:\n\nMost of this firm’s 70,000 seasonal white-collar employees work only four months a year.\n\nJennings’ question: “What is FedEx?” The correct question: “What is H&R Block?”\n\nThe self-effacing Jennings’s explanation for the miss, as told to The New York Times: “I do my own taxes.”\n\nHe would go on to compete in a number of special tournaments, including one in 2011 in which he and fellow champion Brad Rutter were soundly trounced by the IBM computer Watson. But in 2020 he prevailed in a “Greatest of All Time” (GOAT) tournament against James Holzhauer, a professional gambler whose aptitude for finding Daily Doubles and making extravagant wagers made him a 32-game champion in 2019, and Rutter, whose total Jeopardy! winnings (mostly from tournaments) totals more than $5 million.\n\nJennings did not go into the tournament expecting to beat Holzhauer. “I fully expected to lose GOAT. I did it because I wanted to be on the stage with Alex again,” he said, referring to legendary Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. “I was losing a step. I’m quite a bit older…but a few things went right for me, and now I can gracefully turn down a rematch,” he says with a laugh. “I don’t think I’d ever beat James again.”\n\nLife as a Jeopardy! host\n\nIf Jennings thought his GOAT win meant his days on Jeopardy! were over, he was wrong. He had been a consultant with the show for a number of years, so when Trebek was diagnosed with cancer, Jennings occasionally filled in as host. When Trebek died in 2020, Jennings was tapped as an interim host and seemed a natural successor to the beloved Trebek, who had hosted the show for 36 years. But when some distasteful tweets came to light, including one that seemed to mock disabled people, Jennings’s prospects faded. Producers tried out celebrity hosts including Aaron Rodgers, LeVar Burton, Mayim Bialik, and the show’s executive producer, Mike Richards.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Richards was named the show’s host. He would last only a matter of days, being fired when remarks he made on his podcast that were widely considered to be offensive to women, Jewish people, and the nation of Haiti became public. In July 2022 the producers announced that Jennings would permanently join Bialik as cohost of the franchise. (In December 2023, Bialik announced that she had been informed she would no longer be hosting the show. )\n\nJennings, it turned out, was just what the show needed. A 2022 article in The Washington Post was headlined: “Ken Jennings broke ‘Jeopardy!’ in 2004. In 2022, he helped save it.” Jennings is aware of the unique place Jeopardy! holds in the lives of its millions of fans. “I’m extremely mindful of the legacy and heritage of the show.…It’s a tradition for people. There used to be other shows like that—Carson and Cronkite. Most of those are gone now.”\n\nJennings acknowledges that he lacks training as a professional broadcaster. “I benefited from my connection with the show, having shared the stage with Alex. The audience wanted the show to be hosted by someone who had that connection.”\n\nWhat is an author?\n\nFilming Jeopardy! episodes is not a full-time job, as it turns out, because multiple shows are taped during one day. That means that, according to Jennings, he works for Jeopardy! “two to three days a month.” Much of the rest of his time is spent writing books, which number 13 as of 2023. His Junior Genius Guides are written for today’s Ken Jennings-type kids and focus on topics including the human body, outer space, and dinosaurs. He has also written books for adults, including Planet Funny: How Comedy Ruined Everything (2018) and his most recent, 100 Places to See After You Die: A Travel Guide to the Afterlife, published in June 2023.\n\nPersonal life\n\nJennings married Mindy Boam in 2000; they have a son and a daughter, about whom Jennings says, “Neither remembers a world in which I wasn’t the Jeopardy! guy.” In 2004 his then two-year-old son called his father “Ken Jennings” for much of that year, because that was what he heard on the television each night. Jennings and his family live in Seattle."
