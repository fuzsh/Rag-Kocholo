        "text": "The drama behind Sonyâ€™s game shows seems to be coming to a close. Mike Richards is no longer the executive producer of Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune just days after resigning from hosting Jeopardy!. A memo to staff from Sony executive Suzanne Prete wrote:\n\nWe had hoped that when Mike stepped down from the host position at Jeopardy! it would have minimized the disruption and internal difficulties we have all experienced these last few weeks. That clearly has not happened.\n\nMichael Davies from Embassy Row will be stepping in to help out for now. Michael has helped produce favorites like Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Smush, Studio 7, Chain Reaction, The World Series of Pop Culture, Grand Slam, and many more."
