        "text": "Fans of racy romance, period finery and good gossip have been kept waiting long enough: Bridgerton Season 3 arrives this month, and with it a new set of loves, rivalries and intrigue from the imaginations of author Julia Quinn and TV supremo Shonda Rhimes.\n\nThis time, after Daphne and Anthony have had their turn, it’s time for the spotlight to fall on younger brother Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and the delightful Penelope Featherington (Nichola Coughlan). But never mind the cast – what about the locations? Well, as ever, Netflix’s premier hit has scoured the UK for the finest settings to add to its already world-beating stock of stately homes. From mansion to manor house, castle to palace, every one is of the highest pedigree, whether familiar or all fresh for Season 3.\n\nWhere is the Bridgerton house located?\n\nThe Bridgerton family home, draped in wisteria, is meant to be in Grosvenor Square, a smart corner of Mayfair, London. Filming actually took place across town in Greenwich, south-east London, at Georgian villa Ranger's House on the edge of Greenwich Park, which these days is home to The Wernher Collection, a collection of more than 700 pieces of art. (You can visit when filming isn't taking place – but you need to book ahead.) For the interior, filming also takes place at Halton House near Aylesbury, a 19th-century building in the chateau style that now houses RAF Halton and was used in The Crown as the French home of the abdicated King Edward VIII.\n\nIs Bridgerton filmed in a real castle?\n\nBridgerton is filmed in lots of real locations, most of them stately homes, including palaces and castles. Although it’s not the home of the Bridgerton family, one castle used in the filming is Castle Howard in Yorkshire. This magnificent 18th-century pile starred in both the 1981 TV series and 2008 film Brideshead Revisited, and in Bridgerton, was used in Season 1 as Clyvedon Castle, home of the Duke of Hastings.\n\nWhat stately homes were used in Bridgerton?\n\nBridgerton films on location in a large number of stately homes in the UK. One of the most frequently seen is Wrotham Park in Hertfordshire, which stands in as the exterior of Aubrey Hall, the Bridgerton family’s country seat. As with many Bridgerton locations, it’s combined with other stately homes: some of the rooms are filmed at West Wycombe Park, also in Hertfordshire, the 18th-century home of notorious aristocrat Sir Francis Dashwood that’s also seen in Downton Abbey and the 2017 TV adaptation of Howard’s End, while the impressive Orangery is in fact at Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, built in the 1830s.\n\nWhere is Bridgerton filmed in London?\n\nWhile much of the action in Bridgerton is set in London, several places are used to represent the capital, including Bath’s famous Royal Crescent. However, the exterior of the Bridgertons’ home is Ranger’s House in Greenwich, south-east London, and street scenes are often filmed in the nearby Old Royal Naval College, a well-used location for period dramas, including The Crown, Les Misérables and Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nIs Bridgerton a real place?\n\nNo, Bridgerton is named after the Bridgerton family, a fictional creation by the author Julia Quinn.\n\nWhere was Bridgerton Season 3 filmed?\n\nOxfordshire\n\nOne of the most splendid new locations for Bridgerton’s Season 3 is Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. This extravagantly baroque 18th-century estate, the seat of the Dukes of Marlborough and the birthplace of Winston Churchill, is one of the UK’s most filmed stately homes, with credits including Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, James Bond and Mission Impossible. It previously appeared in the Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte as Buckingham House (later Buckingham Palace) and fills the same role in the main series.\n\nBerkshire\n\nSeason 3 introduces us to newcomer Lady Tilley Arnold, and with her comes another impressive home, Basildon Park. This 18th-century Palladian house has film credits including The Gentlemen, the 2005 adaptation of Pride & Prejudice and Marie Antoinette – and its gardens also featured in Bridgerton Season 2 as the venue for the grand Featherington ball.\n\nLincolnshire\n\nAnother new character for Season 3 is the eccentric Lord Hawkins, for whose home we’re introduced to Grimsthorpe Castle, near Grantham. This massive pile, partially redesigned on the site of a medieval fort by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1715, is the ancestral home of the Barons Willoughby de Eresby, and also featured in 2024 period drama Mary & George.\n\nMiddlesex\n\nMany of Bridgerton’s defining moments take place at its grand balls, and for Season 3 we can look forward to a visit to Osterley Park in Hounslow, on the outskirts of London. Its 18th-century design by Robert Adam includes a large central courtyard, which we see in the scene.\n\nSurrey\n\nAnother returning venue is Painshill Park near Cobham. In Season 1, it was the site for a Featherington family picnic; this time, we see the gardens landscaped under the 18th-century aristocrat Charles Hamilton with a famous lake and Chinese Bridge, as the location for an adventure under the leadership of new character Lord Hawkins.\n\nKent\n\nFor Season 3’s opening episode, we’re at a garden party in the English countryside. For this, the production took over Squerryes Court near Sevenoaks, a 17th-century manor house with gardens redesigned in the 1980s to plans dating back to 1709.\n\nBedfordshire\n\nHaving previously lent its Orangery to stand in for the Bridgerton family’s Aubrey Hall, the sprawling country estate of Wrest Park has also been repurposed, in classic Bridgerton style, as home to newcomers the Fullers. The palatial splendour of the house suggests they will be characters to be reckoned with.\n\nWhere was Bridgerton Season 2 filmed?\n\nWiltshire\n\nFor Season 2’s visits to Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), the Tudor mansion Wilton House, near Salisbury, fulfilled multiple roles. Also to be seen in films ranging from The Madness of King George to Tomb Raider, this seat of the Earls of Pembroke provided rooms for both St James’s Palace and Buckingham House, including the ball scene, which was filmed in the famed 60-foot Double Cube Room.\n\nSurrey\n\nAlso providing scenery for several settings was Hampton Court Palace, home to King Henry VIII, near Richmond. We see the Fountain Court at a tea party hosted by Queen Charlotte at Buckingham House, and the Privy Garden provides the backdrop for a meeting between the Sharma sisters.\n\nLondon\n\nThe capital gave Season 2 many of its most memorable moments, beginning with Lady Danbury’s ball, filmed in the Great Conservatory of Syon Park in Brentford. Added to the house in 1820, this metal and glass wonder has proved an attraction for many productions, including Killing Eve and 2024’s Napoleon. For the gallery visit in Episode 7, we are at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, although the interior view is of Petworth House in West Sussex, home to a considerable collection including 19 paintings by JMW Turner. Perhaps most important of Season 2’s London locations, though, is that of Anthony and Edwina’s wedding. This is St James’s Church on Piccadilly, designed and built by no less than Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nWhere was Bridgerton Season 1 filmed?\n\nBath\n\nAlthough it is mainly set in London, much of Bridgerton is filmed in Bath, the beautifully preserved city that has already served as backdrop to so much screen drama. Its Georgian splendour has graced both the 1995 and 2007 versions of Jane Austen’s Persuasion, 2004’s Vanity Fair and 2008’s The Duchess, not to mention the time-travelling episode of Sherlock in 2015. Bridgerton, as many before, makes use of The Royal Crescent, the curving row of terraced houses designed by architect John Wood and built between 1767 and 1774, to stand for the exterior of the Featheringtons’ mansion. The Bath Assembly Rooms, meanwhile, is cunningly combined by the cameras with the 19th-century Holburne Museum to become one building – Lady Danbury’s house. Elsewhere, Trim Street, Beauford Square and Barton Street were given a makeover to turn them into cobbled streets, and more filming took place in the period-perfect Abbey Green, with its famous ancient plane tree.\n\nHertfordshire\n\nFor the interiors of the Featheringtons’ London home, the production used Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, a heritage property with another enviable screen CV. Most recently, we’ve seen this 17th-century home of the 1st Earl of Salisbury in two Netflix films, Rebecca (as Manderley, no less) and Enola Holmes, and it also starred in The Favourite, two Lara Croft movies and as Wayne Manor in the Tim Burton Batman films.\n\nLondon\n\nFor Queen Charlotte’s parlour and drawing room, we are in Lancaster House, the Georgian mansion now owned by the Foreign Office that was once considered the grandest house in the capital, and which is also seen in The Crown as Buckingham Palace. Another London landmark used in Season 1 is The Reform Club, where we see Anthony Bridgerton meet Basset. The Pall Mall gentlemen’s club was founded in 1836 and was the starting point of Phileas Fogg’s travels in both Jules Verne’s novel Around the World in Eighty Days and its 1956 cinema adaptation. Since then, it has appeared in Bond films Die Another Day and Quantum of Solace as well as 2009’s Sherlock Holmes and 2014’s Paddington.\n\nBuckinghamshire\n\nFor the visit to the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the first episode, filming took place at Stowe Park, the vast 18th-century landscape garden attached to Stowe House. The starring role was taken by the Grade I-listed Temple of Venus, the site of the dancing scene. Nearby Dorney Court, a Tudor manor house that dates back to the 15th century, was used for a less spectacular but no less significant use: the coaching inn en route to Daphne and Simon’s new home, where they consummate their marriage. You can stay within the Dorney Court Estate at the two-bedroom Gale Cottage, available to rent on Airbnb.\n\nBridgerton Season 3 streams on Netflix from 16 May 2024 (Part 1) and from 13 June 2024 (Part 2)"
