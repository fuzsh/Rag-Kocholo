        "text": "2011\n\nCity Locations\n\nLos Angeles, Chicago\n\nLocation Types\n\nDiners/Coffee, Studios, Beach/Oceanview\n\nLocation Styles\n\nBeachfront, Dated/Retro, Hollywood\n\nAbout Shameless\n\nJohn Wells developed the hit comedy-drama âShameless,â which is an American adaptation of the same-titled British series created by Paul Abbott. Featuring an ensemble cast, the premise surrounds a struggling-class, dysfunctional family of seven.\n\nViewers are taken on a dizzying journey as each family member navigates the harsh realities of life while celebrating tiny triumphs and living through jarring tragedies. William H. Macy portrays Frank Gallagher who is an absentee father despite being physically present in his childrenâs life. His days are spent in a drunken stupor, caught up in various misadventures, or selfishly chasing after the next high. As the eldest Gallagher child, Fiona (Emmy Rossum) has to take care of her five siblings as well as the responsibilities around the household. Presented in an unapologetically raw, dark, and honest format, the show features the underlying subtexts of poverty, identity, and crime.\n\nJeremy Allen White portrays Philip âLip,â the eldest Gallagher son who trades sexual favors around the neighborhood in exchange for his tutoring services. Ian (Cameron Monaghan) is the middle Gallagher son who faces stigma for being gay.\n\nDebbie (Emma Kenney) is the youngest daughter who has taken to stealing. Despite being only ten years old, Carl (Ethan Cutkosky) starts displaying the markers of being an arsonist and sociopath. Liam (Christian Isaiah) is the toddler in the family, and he might actually be African American but no one is really sure.\n\nAbbott explained that the show takes on a graver level of poverty unlike what is seen in other sitcoms. Wells added that they fought off ideas to have the show set in a trailer park or somewhere in the South.\n\nShameless Locations\n\nThe well-loved series concluded its run after the eleventh season aired in 2021. That hasnât stopped fans from going down memory lane to revisit where the action happened.\n\nThe Gallaghers are said to live in Southside Chicago but the bulk of the filming took place in Los Angeles. Chicago provided some locations for certain scenes of the series.\n\nDuring the showâs ten-year-long run, the cast members reportedly traveled to Chicago about three times each year. Theyâd stay in the city for week-long periods to film various scenes. The windy city mainly was used to record the exterior scenes.\n\nOne of the unforgettable Shameless action scenes, where Mickey Milkovich jumped from a moving bus, was shot in South Chicago. However, stuntman Marcus Prado did the heavy-lifting on behalf of Noel Fisher for the Season 10 episode.\n\nSeveral other outdoor scenes, including the Gallagher home and school, were filmed on location around Chicago. The Warner Brothers Studio located in Burbank, California served as the backdrop for other Shameless scenes.\n\nThere are plenty of exciting places on the list of Shameless locations which you might want to check out. Hereâs a rundown of some of the showâs most memorable scenes alongside details about where they were filmed in real life. Some spoilers are included but the focus is on the production locations.\n\nThe show's pilot episode did a great job at introducing the Gallaghers and revealing snippets of their individualities. Off the bat, viewers know that they are in for a ride thatâs both humorous and downright shocking.\n\nIn a montage, Frank, whose idea of expenses includes âalcohol and drugs,â introduces us to each Gallagher family member. Viewers then get an insight into what a typical morning is like at the Gallagher household, and we get the first glimpse of the exterior when they all flood out of the house to go about their day.\n\nThe house itself stands as a character in the show, and several epic things happen there, particularly on the front porch. 2119 South Homan Ave is the location where the exterior scenes of the Gallaghersâ house were filmed.\n\nThereâs even a foursquare location alongside plenty of tags and photos showcasing the real-life residence. An article published on Distractify reveals that the owner welcomes Shameless fans to step inside the gate and take photos on the famous porch.\n\nA sign at the front of the house asks kind folks who drop by to also leave donations, which isnât too much to ask given how kind the owner is to keep welcoming fans more than a decade later.\n\nBus 52, 157, or 21 will get you to the Shameless filming location as well as the Pink Line and the BNSF train.\n\nChicago Filming Locations Search\n\nFrank is by all depictions a deadbeat whose main concern is getting high at his childrenâs expense. He cheats the system at any given chance for a quick buck and even shakes down his kids for some money.\n\nHis kids quickly pick up on his underhand ways, and as Fiona said âA con artist raised me, so I know one when I see one.â Frank also isnât someone who is quick to part with his ill-gained cash. In the fifth episode of season 7, he surprisingly clears his $223.75 debt at the Alibi Room Bar. The Alibi is his favorite watering hole and he often racks up a high bill which he then has to find ways to clear.\n\nThe scenes at the Alibi were recorded at the Warner Bros. Backlot in Burbank, California. In fact, most indoor scenes were filmed in custom Shameless film sets located at the Burbank lot. When Emma Kenney gave a tour of the showâs set in 2016, she gave us a sneak peek of the Gallaghersâ house set as well as the Alibi. Going on a Warner Bros. Studio Tour allows you to explore the film sets up close which have hosted several other critically-acclaimed productions.\n\nGet to the WB Studios via the Pink, 222, or 501 bus. The B Line (Red) subway will also get you there.\n\nVisit Burbank Filming Locations\n\nCarl is the sibling who is always in trouble and he displays tendencies of being a psychopath quite early. He does have a soft spot for his dad but it wanes as the story progresses.\n\nIn Season 5, Carl starts dealing drugs and it isnât surprising given that he has a dad who says things like âget hard drugs. Make daddy proud.â He even drags Chuckie Slott (Kellen Michael) into it.\n\nWhen Chuckie is eventually arrested, Sammi Slott (Emily Bergl) isnât too happy about it and she also has Carl arrested. The ninth episode titled âCarlâs Preliminary Sentencingâ features several scenes where Fiona preps Carl for his preliminary sentencing hearing.\n\nCarl refuses to sell out his dealer and ends up getting sentenced to a one-year term at a juvenile correctional facility. S. Trumbull Ave and Cermak Rd, Chicago IL is the location where they filmed the fourth episode scenes where Carl is seen selling drugs.\n\nHe isnât the only Gallagher to end up behind bars, and the scenes where Fiona leaves jail were filmed at 3015 South California Boulevard. Ian and Lipâs jail scenes were filmed at 3303 W. Ogden Ave. Bus 322 and the BNSF can get you to Cermak Rd. S. Trumbull Ave is about a seven-minute walk away from Cermak Rd.\n\nView Chicago Video Shoot Locations\n\nAfter getting off house arrest, Fiona goes back to working at the Golden House diner which has since been renamed Patsyâs Pie. Dermot Mulroney portrays Sean Pierce, who manages the diner from Season 5 before Fiona takes over the mantle in Season 7.\n\nSean is big on giving second chances, and he hires several ex-convicts to work at the diner. Alongside Fiona, he also hires Carl, Lip, and Ian to work at the diner at various points.\n\nIn the ninth episode, Ian lands a job at Patsyâs as a dishwasher after getting back on his meds. Up until that point, he was in denial about being bipolar reflected by his former words âsometimes we get so wrapped up in getting what we want, that we forget to ask ourselves why we wanted it in the first place.â\n\nMickey Milkovich (Noel Fisher) convinces him to get back on track, and things start looking up for him again. The Golden House Restaurant & Pancake House located at 4744 N. Broadway St. was the set used to film the Patsyâs Pie scenes.\n\nItâs an old-school classic diner located next to the Riviera Theatre. Bus 225 as well as the A and E trains will get you to the Golden House Restaurant.\n\nChicago Film Shoot Locations Guide\n\nIn the second episode of Season 9, Kevin âKevâ Ball (Steve Howey) and Veronica âVeeâ Ball (Shanola Hampton) are searching for a preschool for their twins. The two are the Gallaghersâ neighbors who have a passionate and tumultuous relationship.\n\nIn fact, Kevâs words best described it when he said âshe once tried to beat me to death with a frozen fish because I asked if there was more broccoli.â\n\nThe pair share several highs and lows through the series, and their battle conceiving during the third season was one such instance. Her mother even offered to be their surrogate but Vee miraculously gets pregnant.\n\nThey learn that sheâs expecting triplets, the joy is short-lived after finding out that one isnât viable. The couple eventually welcomes twin girls, and the ninth season sees them trying to find a perfect and affordable preschool for their daughters.\n\nThey checked out a daycare which in real-life is located at 2030 Colorado Blvd, Los Angeles CA.
