        "text": "Show Often Uses Show Staff As The Audience\n\nAudience members that are often seen or heard in this show are studio crew and staff from the show. Sometimes ABC office staff come down and they become the audience. The show often uses laugh tracks to fill in for when they do not have an audience.\n\nLive! With Kelly and Mark is The New Show Name\n\nMark Consuelos, Kelly Ripa's husband, confirmed that he is starting as the new Live co-host on Monday, April 17, 2023. The new show is called Live!, With Kelly and Mark. As the new show also shoots without an audience, no tickets are available to the public.\n\nLive with Kelly and Mark broadcasts Monday through Friday at 9 AM. Most shows are not live.\n\nBait And Switch on The \"Live\" Aspect\n\nThis show is often promoted as being \"live\", however it is has not been in that format for many years.\n\nThis show is mostly pre-recorded and there are long tape delays before the show is actually transmitted.\n\nThe Friday Show Frankenstein\n\nThe Friday show is actually created from segments recorded during the Monday - Thursday shows and then just edited together. Kelly and Mark change clothes during the weekday shows to record the bits and interviews for the Friday show. The show staff then edit the pieces together and pretend its a live show on Friday.\n\nDuplicitous Hosts and Producers\n\nOnce in a while, instead of recording segments throughout the week, this show will actually record another \"complete\" Friday show on a Thursday afternoon. This make the show somewhat disingenuous as the show's title would suggest or imply it is actually recorded \"live\" and most often it is not.\n\nSome Broadcast Shows Are Weeks Old\n\nSometimes a \"live\" show that is broadcast may be weeks old, so they may choose a subject to discuss that is not time sensitive and they scam the audience into believing that the show is live. Occasionally they may show the \"previously recorded\" title at the start of the show.\n\nThe disingenuous taping tactics at Live demonstrate that this show likes to treat its viewers like idiots.\n\nKelly Ripa Bio\n\nKelly Ripa has been hosting Live since 2001, when she joined Regis Philbin at the post. She has also worked extensively as an actress, with her credits including All My Children, Marvin’s Room, and The Stand-In.\n\nRipa has won several Emmy Awards for her involvement in Live, including those for Outstanding Talk Show Host and Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. She has been called one of the Most Powerful People in Media by the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMark Andrew Consuelos Bio\n\nOther than being known as Kelly Ripa's husband of 25 years, Mark Andrew Consuelos is an American actor best known for his roles on daytime TV soap dramas. Consuelos played Mateo Santos on the ABC soap opera All My Children (1995–2001; 2010) and Hiram Lodge on The CW drama Riverdale (2017–2021).\n\nConsuelos doesn't do much nowadays and with his children all grown up, the opportunity to replace Ryan Seacrest on Live is something that will get him out of the house.\n\nShow Formerly Known as Live! With Kelly and Ryan\n\nRyan Seacrest debuted on Live With Kelly and Ryan in 2017, and became a fixture of the daytime TV show. The format of the show allowed Seacrest to satisify his ego with countless celebrity interviews and the opportunity for him to impart personal anecdotes from his life behind the scenes in TV land. When he first joined the show he only meant to stay for three seasons. But he enjoyed hanging out with Kelly so much that he renewed his contract for another three seasons.\n\nFinal Ryan Seacrest Show Friday, April 14. 2023\n\nSeacrest is going to take a break from being in front of the camera and now focus more on the popular The Kardashians TV show, where he is the creator and producer of the show. Ryan Seacrest left the show on Friday, April 14. 2023, making it the only \"live\" Friday show in five years.\n\nTop Rated Show in Key Metropolitan Areas\n\nLive has regularly been the top-rated morning talk show in America. In big cities such as New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Miami and San Francisco, it often ranks number one in terms of ratings. With viewership averaging 5 million per episode, Live dominates the market in its morning time slot – and for good reason.\n\nFormat Of The Show\n\nEach day begins with a casual off-the-cuff conversation between the co-hosts, followed by the opportunity for a home viewer to win a vacation by answering a trivia question. The remainder of the 42 minute program is dedicated to a mixture of celebrity guests, musical performances, and recurring segments on a range of topics including health, fashion, food, and lifestyle.\n\nThe Show Is Often Not 'Live' At All\n\nThe producers of this show have taken the word 'Live\" and stretched the truth on the taping reality. Many weeks of the show are not live at all, some shows are just reruns and other shows are shown with a taping delay.\n\nEven more shows are spliced together, where the producers have the hosts make a costume change for a segment where they can splice it with other segments from other days to make up many 'Frankenstein' shows - the change in hairstyles is often the biggest giveaway.\n\nThe Show Host History\n\nThere have been many hosts Live over the years:\n\nRegis Philbin 1988–2011\n\nKathie Lee Gifford 1988–2000\n\nKelly Ripa 2001–present\n\nMichael Strahan 2012–2016\n\nRyan Seacrest 2017–2023\n\nMark Consuelos 2023-present"
