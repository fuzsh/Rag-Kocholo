        "text": "Having an integrated monitor allows you to see the video feeds as a multiview display, without having to connect an additional monitor. With the Ninja docked into the AtomX Cast, you can utilize its high quality 5-inch touchscreen for setup as well as use all the great Atomos monitor-assist tools for exposure, focus and image analysis to really nail your shots.\n\nOne of the benefits of using Ninja and AtomX Cast in a multi-camera setup is that you can use the Picture-in-Picture function to display two inputs at the same time. Any of the four HDMI inputs can be used for a Picture-in-Picture effect over the Program output with controls for size and location of the overlaid image. You can display a close-up of a product on your desk and add your face as a Picture-in-Picture at the same time while you talk about the product.\n\nUsing a Ninja and AtomX Cast with any camera that has a clean HDMI output, with your choice of lens, allows you to bring professional production values to any online video stream or meeting. Adding a cinematic look can boost the image and impact of your message, and put your productions head and shoulders above the average webcam event.\n\nUsing the Ninja to check your light, camera angles and sound, will all help you to make professional quality video productions. Many older HD camcorder or photo cameras can output great looking video via its HDMI port, bringing new life to camera equipment you may already own."
