        "text": "Long-running Channel 4 gameshow presented by Noel Edmonds. Attracted by our capacity to accommodate a full production ‘package’, the hit gameshow chose to relocate from its previous home at Bristol’s Paintworks to its new home at The Bottle Yard Studios in 2013.\n\nOne of our 3,000 sqm warehouse units was transformed into a fully functioning, self contained studio and post production facility. The new production facilities were designed and built by BBC Studios and Post Production, the BBC’s commercial facilities company, who worked with Endemol to provide technical services for Deal or No Deal since 2010.\n\nDeal Or No Deal’s new home came complete with technical facilities, audience-holding, costume and make-up areas, dressing rooms, production offices, catering area and edit suites. The technical fit-out was delivered in just four weeks, in time for the start of series ten which began filming in October 2013.\n\nUpon relocation, Series Producer Jim Connolly said: “From an operational point of view, Deal Or No Deal’s relocation to The Bottle Yard Studios has been really smooth and has brought a host of benefits to the show. Now that we have the production office, studio and edit all under one roof, we are able to shoot more footage per day, and spend more time in the editing suite. We are also able to logistically manage our contestants and audience members more effectively, which is a great plus. The move was a success and we look forward to the future in our new home.”\n\nIn August 2016, Channel 4 announced that studio version of the game show will finish after a final series in Autumn 2016."
