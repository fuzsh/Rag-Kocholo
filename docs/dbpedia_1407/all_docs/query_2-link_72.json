        "text": "Never has the phrase “Always a bridesmaid, never a bride” been more true than in the movie 27 Dresses, which follows a girl who loves weddings but has never had her own. However, when she meets a young and handsome upcoming journalist, that all changes.\n\nThe film was released in 2008 and earned $162.7 million at the box office. And while it might not be 27 yet, we decided to find out what the 27 Dresses cast has been up to since its release anyway!\n\nKatherine Heigl\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: Jane Nichols\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: Roswell (1999 to 2002), Grey’s Anatomy (2005 to 2010), Knocked Up (2007), The Ugly Truth (2009), One for the Money (2012), State of Affairs (2014 to 2015), Suits (2018 to 2019) and Firefly Lane (2021 to 2023).\n\nPERSONAL: Heigl has been married to Josh Kelley since 2007. They have three children together.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON 27 DRESSES: “I really related to Jane because I’m a doormat. That was really my early 20s experience, being a people pleaser, trying to make people happy, feeling like if I ever did anything wrong, feeling incredibly guilty and apologetic. So, I really understood Jane’s mindset.”\n\nJames Marsden: 27 Dresses cast\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: Kevin Doyle\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: Second Noah (1996 to 1997), X-Men (2000), The Notebook (2004), Hairspray (2007), Enchanted (2007), Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), Westworld (2016 to 2022) Dead to Me (2019 to 2022), Jury Duty (2023), and Unfrosted (2024).\n\nPERSONAL: Marsden has three children and has been married once.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON 27 DRESSES: Despite the backlash Heigl has received, Marsden still loves her, saying, “She has very strong convictions and strong opinions on certain things, and she doesn’t back down from letting you know if she feels like she’s been wronged in any way. I’ve always seen that as just strength of character.”\n\nMalin Akerman\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: Tess Nichols\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: The Comeback (2005 to 2014), The Proposal (2009), Couple Retreat (2009), Children’s Hospital (2010 to 2016), Rock of Ages (2012), Trophy Wife (2013 to 2014), Billions (2016 to 2019) and The Final Race (2023).\n\nPERSONAL: Akerman has been married twice and has one child.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON 27 DRESSES: “One of my favorite parts about playing Tess was when she got to be Bridezilla. I loved that scene in the movie. It was fun to do. I’m pretty chill as a person, very opposite from that. It’s always fun to play opposites and just get all that out.”\n\nEdward Burns: 27 Dresses cast\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: George\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Holiday (2006), Purple Violets (2007), Newlyweds (2011) and Bridge and Tunnel (2021 to 2022).\n\nPERSONAL: Burns has been married since 2003 and has two children.\n\nJudy Greer\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: Casey\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: Love & Money (1999 to 2000), The Wedding Planner (2001), 13 Going on 30 (2004), Two and a Half Men (2007 to 2015), Glenn Martin DDS (2009 to 2011), Archer (2009 to 2023), Jurassic World (2015), Ant-Man (2015), Let’s Go Luna! (2018 to 2022), Where’d You Go Bernadette (2019) and Mabel (2024).\n\nPERSONAL:Greer has been married since 2011 and has stepchildren.\n\nTHOUGHTS ON 27 DRESSES: “27 Dresses was so fun because that character was very different. She was over it. It was really fun to play someone who was constantly rolling their eyes. I thought it was fun to balance out Katherine Heigl’s manic energy and type-A personality. That was pretty cool. Plus, [director] Anne Fletcher is just a genius and everyone should be so lucky to be on set with Anne Fletcher. She’s amazing.”\n\nBrian Kerwin: 27 Dresses cast\n\nCHARACTER PLAYED: Hal Nichols\n\nBEST KNOWN FOR: The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo (1979 to 1981), Murphy’s Romance (1985), Jack (1996), Beggars and Choosers (1999 to 2001) and One Life to Live (2002 to 2011).\n\nPERSONAL: Kerwin was married to Jeanne Marie Troy from 1990 until her death in 2016 They had three children together.\n\nFor more 2000’s romcoms, keep scrolling!\n\nGet to Know the ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ More Than 20 Years Later\n\nGet to Know the ‘Miss Congeniality’ Cast 24 Years Later"
