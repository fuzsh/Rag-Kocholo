        "text": "Making its return to the high-performance Studio Stock Series, the Studio Stock 7 was expertly crafted for the player looking for a compact mid-mallet putter with strong visual cues on the greens. The attention to detail on this head makes it one of Robert Bettinardi’s most appealing, original designs to date, as the unique half-moon shape gives a curvature to the flange that allows players to effortlessly line the ball up at address. The positioning of the spud neck with a single bend shaft offers a perfectly face-balanced putter for professional-grade stability and confidence for any crucial putt.\n\nNEW FACE MILLING TECHNOLOGY - ROLL CONTROL FACE\n\nDeveloped in conjunction with the top players in the world and highest performing putters on Tour, our newest Roll Control Face™ milling was scientifically engineered with an asymmetrical design groove profile that promotes more topspin at impact, and shortens the distance the ball takes to get into a true roll with each putt.\n\nWithout the use of inserts, the Roll Control Face™ gives players exceptional feel and optimal audible feedback at impact.\n\nNEW DIAMOND BLAST FINISH\n\nOur smooth Diamond Blast finish is all-new for 2021, giving each model a fresh silver look to provide a clean appearance from address. This anti-glare finish is complemented by a crisp red and black paint scheme for a professional, sleek aesthetic to enhance any bag.\n\n303 STAINLESS STEEL\n\nAll of our production model putters are milled from a proprietary blend of 303 Stainless Steel. Because we machine all of our putters in our own manufacturing facility, we only choose the finest blends of steel that allow for exceptional machinability, and an unforgettable feel at impact when the putter is finished."
