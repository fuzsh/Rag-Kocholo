        "text": "Going to a live TV taping is one of the best tourist experiences, and there’s no better city to join the audience of a popular show than here in Los Angeles!\n\nWatching the behind-the-scenes of TV productions while getting up-close with celebrity hosts and guests is one of the best things to do in LA. And tickets are free! Whether you attend a talk show, game show, or talent contest, you’ll never watch TV the same way again.\n\nHere’s how you can apply to join the audience of 10 shows that are produced right here in LA – but plan ahead, as many have a waiting list that fills up fast.\n\nCreated by original American Idol judge Simon Cowell, America’s Got Talent is one of many shows indebted to the Idol format (albeit open to all ages and not restricted to just singing). Sign up for tickets and witness the diverse performances and famed judges, including Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel and Sofia Vergara; and host Terry Crews.\n\nTo minimize lines there are two daily ticket distributions, so be sure to choose only one arrival. If tickets are not yet available for your chosen date or all shows are full, submit your info to be notified when tickets are released. Children aged 8 and older can attend (accompanied by an adult).\n\nPasadena Civic Auditorium (300 E Green St, Pasadena 91101)\n\nDancing with the Stars is back this Fall with hosts Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough. An all-new cast of celebrities and the show's pro dancers will brave the dance floor for the very first time, including: Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino, Xochitl Gomez (Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), supermodel Tyson Beckford and Greg Brady himself, Barry Williams. Each week the celebs and their partners will perform a dance, which will be judged by a panel of experts - Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough - as well as voted upon by viewers. In the end, only one star will be crowned champion and win the coveted Mirrorball trophy.\n\nSign up for tickets and be sure to arrive early on the day, as there’s a line to join and entry is first come, first served and not guaranteed.\n\nTelevision City (7800 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles 90036)\n\nAiring since 1964, Jeopardy! is one of those shows that everyone knows – which makes being in its studio audience even cooler! Tickets for this trivia-fest are free, but also extremely limited and only available on a first come, first served basis. Jeopardy! tapes five shows a day with two different audiences, so if you’re a true fan you’ll watch the taping of either two or three episodes. Jeopardy! allows children as young as 8 (accompanied by an adult), but keep in mind that tapings take 3-4 hours from arrival to final taping, which might test the patience of youngsters.\n\nSony Pictures Studios (10202 W Washington Blvd, Culver City 90232)\n\nLong-running late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! accepts ticket requests for its studio audience and is conveniently filmed right on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. If selected, you’ll need to arrive 30-45 minutes prior to the check-in deadline. Fans are processed on a first come, first served basis and tickets are issued in excess of capacity, so arrive early. Taping typically lasts around 90 minutes. Cellphones, cameras, backpacks etc. will need to be checked with security and retrieved as you exit.\n\nEl Capitan Entertainment Centre (Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles 90028)\n\nThe first winner of American Idol and still among the most famous, Kelly Clarkson has hosted her eponymous variety talk show since 2019. Free tickets to attend a taping of the multiple Emmy Award-winning Kelly Clarkson Show are sometimes available just a week in advance (but don’t bank on it), with 200 tickets released for each of two tapings per day on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and some Fridays. Tapings are at 9:30 a.m. and 1:15 p.m., with the actual filming spanning around 90 minutes. Same day tickets are sometimes available 45 minutes before the listed times from the standby line in Universal City’s Curious George Parking Garage, Level B1.\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood (100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City 91608)\n\nTV’s longest-running game show, The Price Is Right has brightened American homes since 1956. You can play your part in this legendary production, currently hosted by comedian Drew Carey, by signing up for updates on the show’s next season. Tickets are generally released about a month in advance. A “Priority Ticket” guarantees admission as long as you arrive prior to the time on your ticket, while a “General Ticket” is first come, first served (though you’ll normally be admitted if you arrive 30-60 mins early). Group bookings (parties of 15-25 people) should contact groupbooking@ocatv.com for further information.\n\nTelevision City (7800 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles 90036)\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning musical competition series The Voice returns with vocalists from across the country competing in Season 24, which premieres on Sept. 25, 2023. The Queen of Country, Reba McEntire claims her red chair alongside last season's champ, Niall Horan, and returning superstar coaches John Legend and Gwen Stefani as they vie to discover and coach the next singing phenomenon.\n\nThe Voice tapes twice a day, at 10am and 3pm. Request tickets at the NBC website.\n\nUniversal Studios Hollywood (100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City 91608)\n\nWheel of Fortune co-hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White are one of TV's most recognizable and longstanding duos. You can join Pat and Vanna – hosts since 1981 and 1982, respectively – at twice-daily tapings (noon or 3:15pm) at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Pat has announced that Season 41, which premiered in September 2023, will be his last as host of the classic game show, so if you're a fan don't miss your final chance to see him before Ryan Seacrest takes over in 2024.\n\nTickets are often available just days in advance and can be requested for up to four people, age 8 and up. A limited number of VIP seats are available to members of the show’s Wheel Watchers Club. For larger groups, call (818) 772-6788.\n\nSony Pictures Studios (10202 W Washington Blvd, Culver City 90232)"
