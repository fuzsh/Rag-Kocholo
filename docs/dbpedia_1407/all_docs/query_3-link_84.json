Training under her mother’s direction not only built her passion for dance, but also taught her how to graciously and positively impact every single student that walks into the studio, both as a dancer and as a person. Growing up, Shaye participated in both recreational and competitive dance, which provided her with a large array of experience in all styles. Along with her own training, Shaye was able to teach alongside her mother and run acro and contortion classes, as well as teach private acro lessons. Shaye is a student of Stockton University, where she is studying Occupational Therapy and Childhood Studies with a plan to obtain her Masters Degree. Along with furthering her education, Shaye is also continuing her training on the nationally ranked Stockton University Dance Team as a team captain! Although she loves and appreciates every style of dance, she adores acro dance because of the never-ending possibilities of tricks, combos, and creativity for all levels from beginner to advanced. She is beyond excited to be able to share her expertise and love with everyone at Studio 7!\n\nSara is a professional ballroom dancer, specializing in latin dance such as Salsa, Cha Cha, Rumba, Samba, and Jive. She competes regularly and trains with top coaches at Rogers Dancesport Center, as well as names such as Tony Dovolani from Dancing with the Stars.\n\nSara is passionate about sharing her love of dance, and looks forward to each opportunity to teach students and bring out the best in them. Her philosophy is to train hard, but to still have fun and remember the joy that dancing brings.\n\nSara’s love for performing and dancing started as soon as she could walk, and she is grateful to work and spend her time immersed in what she loves.\n\nCaitlin Quinn Pittenger completed her M.F.A. in Dance from Temple University in Philadelphia and her B.A. in Dance from Goucher College, with a concentration in performance and choreography.
