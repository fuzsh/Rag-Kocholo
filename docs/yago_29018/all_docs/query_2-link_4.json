        "text": "Leonard Woolf (born Nov. 25, 1880, London—died Aug. 14, 1969, Rodmell, Sussex, Eng.) was a British publisher, political worker, journalist, and internationalist who influenced literary and political life and thought more by his personality than by any one achievement. Along with his wife, Virginia Woolf, he played a key role in the formation of the Bloomsbury group of writers and artists.\n\nWoolf’s most enduring accomplishment was probably his autobiography, an expression of the toughness of moral fiber and quality of mind and spirit that made him one of the outstanding men of his time. Its first three volumes, Sowing (1960), Growing (1961), and Beginning Again (1964), re-create the world of liberal Jewry into which he was born, the intellectual excitement of life at the University of Cambridge in the early years of the 20th century, the experience as a civil servant in Ceylon (1904–11) that made him an anti-imperialist, and the atmosphere of the Bloomsbury group. In 1917 Virginia and Leonard Woolf founded their own publishing house, the Hogarth Press, and their discerning understanding encouraged such writers as T.S. Eliot and E.M. Forster."
