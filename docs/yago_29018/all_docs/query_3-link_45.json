        "text": "That most masculine man, Leonard Woolf, has suffered a peculiarly female fate. Brilliant, socially conscious, compassionate, an influential politician both nationally and internationally, a fine writer, serious journalist and important publisher, Woolf is now best-known for his marriage.\n\nIn this biography, astonishingly the first, Victoria Glendinning seeks to restore Woolf as an individual, retrieving him from the fate he has been dealt as \"husband to the genius\". Only a third of his long and packed life was lived as the husband to Virginia: he was born in 1880 and died in 1969 and his marriage lasted from 1911 until 1941.\n\nWoolf came from one of those clever Jewish families that integrated into the middle and upper-middle classes of Victorian England. His father was a QC and his mother's family prosperous merchants. The family took their religion seriously but were Reform jews; Leonard, one of nine children, attended secular schools before winning a scholarship to Cambridge.\n\nThere, the intellectual and introspective Woolf found himself in his natural element, with a group of friends that later formed the nucleus of what became loosely known as \"Bloomsbury\".\n\nLeonard Woolf was always more complex, and more interesting, than many others who fluttered in that elaborate, effete world. Possibly because he was hopelessly heterosexual. And not just straight, but full of lust and passion. He was fiercely competitive and throughout his life crazy about any sort of sport or game. He also had an uncanny instinct with animals; most pictures of Woolf include an animal at his side or on his shoulder.\n\nOne of the fascinations of Glendinning's book is to follow Woolf's sexual interests and to marvel at the fate which had him fall unconditionally in love with a woman who could not, or would not, respond sexually to him. It is a slight shock not only to hear that Woolf was considered an \"aficio- nado of big breasts\" but also to find Morgan Forster (of all people) writing to him on the thrilling largeness of someone called Naomi Royde-Smith's breasts.\n\nWoolf's sexual lust, or \"savagery\" as his friends would have it, was mirrored in a general lust for life which differed from that of his Cambridge friends. Most of them were content to stay at home and write, to observe and discuss \"life\", but Woolf lived it. After Cambridge he went out to Ceylon and proved himself a particularly able administrator. Ceylon defined him. In Growing, the autobiographical volume that covered the Ceylon years 1904-1911, he writes how he spent as much time alone in jungles where he could have died, as he did with people who were as alien to him as Martians.\n\nCeylon fixed the carapace of the cold intellectual, although the emotional, passionate and ardent young man always glittered just beneath the surface.\n\nGlendinning puts paid to the slanders that Leonard Woolf has had to endure over the past few decades by over-excited literary theorists who wanted to see their heroine immured by some monstrous male. This man, of whom it was said would \"always be the most intelligent person in the room\", gave up his own life and ambitions to nurture what he saw as Virginia's genius. He loved her more than he loved himself and some of the most moving pages of this book are in the aftermath of her death when Leonard was bleakly and inconsolably alone. This is why it is immensely satisfying to learn that within 18 months he had fallen in love again.\n\nTrekkie Parsons was 38 when he fell in love with her. He was 62 but love made him an ardent youth once again. She was an artist, a feminist and married to Ian Parsons, a publisher who later bought the Woolfs' Hogarth Press. Trekkie remained married to her husband but she also remained \"married\" to Leonard for the rest of his life in an arrangement that suited them all. The last happy and productive third of his life was spent with a woman who wasn't \"bony and brainy\". Glendinning is discreet in her judgements but she does allow herself this: \"Trekkie, like Virginia, loved to be loved. She also knew how to love, and to care for the people she loved.\"\n\nIf you thought you knew the last word on the Bloomsbury narcissists, this understated, warm and scholarly biography will offer more than you might imagine. Leonard Woolf was always terribly attractive to women and even all these years after his death his biographer - and reader - comes under that spell.\n\nWith a compassionate eye and a spirited admiration, Glendinning writes about a man who deserves far more attention than he has had. It also opens up the wider, anguished question posed by Henry James, that of whether art is \"life\" or life is \"art\".\n\nAnyone up for a comparative biog of George Henry Lewes and George Eliot?"
