        "text": "'My birthday -- and let me count up all the things I had. Leonard had sworn he would give me nothing, and like a good wife, I believed him. But he crept into my bed, with a little parcel, which was a beautiful green purse. And he brought up breakfast, with a paper which announced a naval victory (we have sunk a German battleship) and a square brown parcel, with [Scott’s] The Abbot in it -- a lovely first edition. So I had a very merry and pleasing morning -- which indeed was only surpassed by the afternoon. I was then taken up to town, free of charge, and given a treat, first at a picture palace, and then at Buszards [Tea Rooms]. I don’t think I’ve had a birthday treat for ten years; and it felt like one too -- being a fine frosty day, everything brisk and cheerful, as it should be, but never is. We exactly caught a non-stop train, and I have been very happy reading father on Pope, which is very witty and bright, without a single dead sentence in it. In fact I don’t know when I have enjoyed a birthday so much--not since I was a child anyhow.'"
