        "text": "Leonard Woolf was a British author, publisher, civil servant who lived in Ceylon. He was the husband of Virginia Woolf.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nIn October 1904 Woolf moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to become a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service, in Jaffna and later Kandy, and by August 1908 was named an assistant government agent in the Southern Province, where he administered the District of Hambantota. Woolf returned to England in May 1911 for a year’s leave. Instead, however, he resigned in early 1912 and that same year married Virginia Stephen (Virginia Woolf).\n\nTogether Leonard and Virginia Woolf became influential in the Bloomsbury group, which also included various other former Apostles.\n\nIn December 1917 Woolf became one of the co-founders of the 1917 Club, which met in Gerrard Street, Soho. After marriage, Woolf turned his hand to writing and in 1913 published his first novel, The Village in the Jungle, which is based on his years in Sri Lanka. A series of books followed at roughly two-yearly intervals.\n\n‘Village in the Jungle’ was one of Vernon Corea’s favorite novels and was on his bookshelf in Maha Nuge Gardens. The distinguished Sri Lankan film director, Lester James Peiris released a film called ‘Baddegama’ which was adapted from Leonard Woolf’s novel ‘Village in the Jungle.\n\nRecently history was made in the House of Lords in the Palace of Westminster in London when Ameera Hussain, Chair of the Deaf and Blind Aid Lanka (a registered charity in Great Britain), presented the disability rights campaigner Lord Colin Low with the first ever translation in Braille of Leonard Woolf’s novel ‘Village in the Jungle.’\n\nSee some rare footage of Leonard Woolf speaking on camera on economist John Maynard Keynes:\n\nRead Leonard Woolf’s diaries in Ceylon from 1908 – 19011 here:"
