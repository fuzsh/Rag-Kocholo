        "text": "What moves you to stand in the presence of the house, the landscape, the objects of a writer whom you so admire? Why are literary pilgrimages so compelling? Virginia Woolf explains: “It would seem to be a fact that writers stamp themselves upon their possessions more indelibly than other people.” Certainly, each year, thousands of people visit Monk’s House, Leonard and Virginia Woolf’s sixteenth-century cottage, in Rodmell, East Sussex. It’s set right on the village street, a modest clapboard building with a big garden beyond. Inside, the small, low-ceilinged rooms are peopled with pilgrims. You move quietly among them; the atmosphere is hushed and meditative, like that in a church. You are caught up in a silent current, adrift in Woolf’s life: these are the chairs that were decorated by her sister; here is her narrow bed by the window; here are her books, tightly packed, floor to ceiling. You are very close to her here. You are speaking with her in your mind.\n\nAs a literary pilgrim, you could go to England and visit Woolf’s houses. Or you could simply go to New York and visit the Berg Collection. For decades, the collector William Beekman acquired things related to Woolf: letters, manuscripts, photographs, postcards, rare editions. The William Beekman Collection of Virginia Woolf and Her Circle, consisting of a hundred and fifty-three such objects, has just been added to the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, at the New York Public Library. Like any pilgrimage, a journey to the Berg imposes certain exigencies. Access is restricted, and you must make an appointment. You must leave your coat and bag downstairs. The atmosphere is hushed and solemn: this is the inner sanctum. Here are words that have changed history, governments, laws, morals, mores, marriages, and minds. The librarian brings things out to you, one by one. The Beekman materials are encased in beautiful clothbound slipcases, with gold titles on the spines. Opening these exquisite cases is like unwrapping treasure.\n\nThe earliest letter in the collection is one from Virginia to her sister Vanessa, on the occasion of Vanessa’s wedding, in 1907. It’s written on two big sheets of heavy paper, folded in half and stitched down the center, making four leaves. The message is whimsical and charming: “Address of Congratulation to our Mistress on her Approaching Marriage.” It’s written in the collective voice of the siblings, who are presented in the guise of animals.\n\nDear Mistress, We the undersigned three Apes and a Wombat wish to make known to you our great grief and joy at the news that you intend to marry. We hear that you have found a new Red Ape of a kind not known before who is better than all other apes because he can both talk & marry you: from which we are debarred.\n\nThey declare the Red Ape (the art critic Clive Bell) to be “clean, merry, and sagacious,” and their Mistress (Vanessa) to be “very understanding of Apes, loving & wholesome, vigilant after fleas, & scourging of all Misdoing.” The letter is signed, in a different colored ink, by Virginia, as the three apes and the wombat.\n\nIt’s hard to think of anything more playful, more intimate, more deeply familial than this handwritten, hand-sewn message to a beloved sister. Holding these pages, you hold a part of Virginia Woolf’s life. It’s odd to find yourself so deep inside it, reading this note. Do you wonder by what right you read it? But the letters are here, so you read on.\n\nAnimal nicknames were rife in the family. Vanessa called Virginia Goat, or Singe (French for “ape”). Virginia called Vanessa Dolphin. Leonard and Virginia had their own pet names for each other: he was Mongoose; she was Mandrill. An undated letter (circa 1927) from Leonard Woolf to Vita Sackville-West continues the trope:\n\nDear Vita,\n\nI am entrusting a valuable animal out of my menagerie to you for the night. It is not quite sound in the headpiece. It should be well fed & put to bed punctually at 11. It will be v. good of you if you will see to this & pay no attention to anything wh. it may try to say for itself.\n\nLW.\n\nThis letter was written during a period when Virginia was pursuing an erotic friendship with Sackville-West. Virginia suffered periodically from depression and illness, and was frequently under doctors’ orders regarding diet and rest. Leonard’s playful, affectionate request shows his trust in Sackville-West, and also his deep concern for his wife.\n\nNot all the messages are so private. A postcard to Virginia’s nephew Julian Bell reads, in its entirety, “For Heavens sake tell me where does ‘Die like a rose in aromatic pain’ come from? Pope? And what is the right quotation? And where are your poems, VW.” To a friend, Marjorie Joad, Virginia describes a chaotic day at Hogarth Press, the publishing house that she founded with her husband: “I’ve been meaning every day to write to you, but we live in a gale of wind and every feather on my head is upright . . . all the psycho-analyst books have been dumped in a fortress the size of Windsor castle in ruins upon the floor; Leonard’s in his shirt sleeves. . . . Grizzle [the dog] is making darts for peoples legs. . . . I have just counted out a ream of paper and found large hoof marks halfway through. Then you think I can write a novel!”\n\nIt’s so like Woolf to jumble these things together, the many parts of her life—intellectual, emotional, fierce, tender, and hilarious. We know the value of these scattered shards; it was Woolf herself who taught us that it’s from such shifting bits of awareness that the whole person can be revealed, or the whole world.\n\nWoolf’s writing brought her fame, but part of her appeal comes from the seductive glow of her suicide, that black comet streaking across her sky. Her final act is one we can never absorb, never forgive, never understand. She chose to leave us in a way that feels brutal; it feels personal.\n\n“Oh, the death letters,” says the librarian.\n\nThere are thirteen of them, held in an ebony case titled “Letters to Vita Sackville-West on the Death of Virginia Woolf.” These letters reveal a place so sad and private, so deep in the interior, that, although we may read them, we understand that they are not ours to know. We can only approach the mystery of another consciousness; we can’t share this passage.\n\nThe letters to Sackville-West are from Leonard and Vanessa. After Woolf’s death, by drowning, in the River Ouse, at first the body was not found. It was thought to have floated out to sea. Vanessa wrote, “There is no news of course—It seems to me likely there never will be, which perhaps is best.” But later the body was found. It was sickening news; the body was now a thing. Vanessa wrote this about Leonard: “He arranged too for cremation at Brighton yesterday & didn’t want me to go. So I didn’t. There was no ceremony, nothing. . . . But I cannot bear to think of him alone in that house—though I know he would not stand being anywhere else.” What is moving about the letters is their immediacy: Virginia’s death was still ringing in the air when the words were set down.\n\nThe most powerful letter is Leonard’s. He sat down to write on the day itself, March 28, 1941.\n\nMy dear Vita\n\nI do not want you to see in the paper or hear possibly on the wireless the terrible thing that has happened to Virginia. She has been really very ill these last weeks & was terrified that she was going mad again. It was, I suppose, the strain of the war & finishing her book & she could not rest or eat. Today she went for a walk leaving behind a letter saying that she was committing suicide. I think she has drowned herself as I found her stick floating in the river, but we have not found the body. I know what you will feel & what you felt for her. She was very fond of you. She has been through hell these last days.\n\nYours\n\nLeonard\n\nVirginia Woolf’s writing delivered the essence of what it is to be alive. She conveyed the immense possibilities of the human consciousness, in all its glancing, shimmering complexity. How shocking, then, to find that she had chosen to end that shimmer, to end the life of the body and also of the mind. How painful to learn that her life had become hell.\n\nThat day, Leonard had come home to Monk’s House, so full of her books and her presence, and there he found her letter. He followed her to the river. There was her walking stick, bobbing on the surface, evidence of the unthinkable act.\n\nOf course it was not unthinkable. In “Mrs. Dalloway,” she had warned us of the horror that the mind could make. Through the suicide of the First World War veteran Septimus Smith, she had shown us her escape plan. But her act was still shocking. Leonard’s account, set down that afternoon, makes the loss immediate, unsupportable.\n\nThe walking stick is there, too. The wooden cane with a curved handle lies behind you, on a shelf in a glass case set into the wall. How fearfully close you feel to her then. The evidence of her mind is all around you. Grief is here but also greatness. You feel both her presence and her absence—the world she so beautifully created, her intelligence, her compassion, her exquisite prose, the depth of your loss.\n\nLoss lies at the heart of Woolf’s great novel “To the Lighthouse.” It’s a book about grief, quiet and overwhelming, rather than about death. You know this book very well, and you recognize this familiar current of sorrow. Now, at the center of your pilgrimage, this current sweeps you into it. Wasn’t this the point? To swim into the middle of this book, her life, her work?\n\nAmong these objects, you may feel newly bereft, overcome by absence, like the book’s character Lily Briscoe, seeing now where Virginia is not: “the whole wave and whisper of the garden . . . flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness.” Holding Leonard’s letter in your hand, flooded by the sense of what had just happened, you might be undone. “Mrs. Ramsay,” you might say, in your mind, “Mrs. Ramsay.” The tears might run down your face."
