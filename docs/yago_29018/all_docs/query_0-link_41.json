        "text": "Leonard Woolf: A Life\n\nby Victoria Glendinning\n\n544pp, Simon & Schuster, Â£25\n\n\"I've given you all the little that I've to give,\" wrote Leonard Woolf in the dedication of his novel The Village in the Jungle to Virginia Stephen in 1913, the year they were married. What he gave her was his name: hard to imagine A Room of One's Own or Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Stephen. He also gave her her working life, because had she not married him she might have published nothing. Being Virginia Woolf's husband is what made him famous, but Leonard Woolf was more than that. When I read his memoirs in the 1960s I decided he was an exemplary figure: balanced yet passionate, practical, generous and wise. Victoria Glendinning's biography fills out the picture with a brilliant lightness of touch that takes into account the darknesses and depths of this remarkable man. And she succeeds in keeping Virginia as the secondary character, which is no mean feat.\n\nLeonard was in revolt against his own background - a prosperous London Jewish family, father a barrister who died in middle age, mother left struggling to educate the nine children, telling the boys they must win scholarships. They did. At St Paul's he was crammed with the classics and survived taunts against Jews by being good at games and very good-looking. He had a streak of melancholy - \"nothing matters\" were the words he kept in his mind like a protective amulet - and a love of literature. He won a scholarship to Trinity, arrived in Cambridge at the end of the century, in October 1899, and immediately entered a charmed world of friendship with other young men intent on clearing the air of Victorian stuffiness and hypocrisy.\n\nLytton Strachey, Toby Stephen, Clive Bell and Saxon Sydney-Turner, joined by EM Forster, Keynes and GE Moore, made up a group that became \"Bloomsbury\". Leonard was the only Jew, and anti-semitism was endemic, yet he was at the heart of the group and greatly liked. For five years they read, talked, walked, formed clubs, gossiped and wrote letters. They admired Ibsen, Shaw, Swinburne and Hardy, and they made up their minds that the 20th century should be a better one than the 19th.\n\nCambridge was the formative romance of Woolf's life. Seven years in the colonial service followed, in what was then Ceylon. The experience was penitential, but established his views on empire, made him a good administrator and gave him an awareness of human degradation. It inspired his extraordinary novel, The Village in the Jungle, which presents the brutal suffering of half-starved peasants, living almost like wild animals and not helped by their English masters. It was a brave work to come from a young colonial official, as powerful and dismaying as Hardy's presentations of the grim side of English country life.\n\nWoolf went on home leave in 1911 and left the service. Toby Stephen had died young, and Lytton Strachey urged Leonard to marry Stephen's sister Virginia. Leonard obligingly fell in love with her, wooed and won her. He was now fixed at the heart of the Bloomsbury group, an extension of Cambridge with the Stephen sisters admitted to membership. He did not know that Virginia had suffered severe mental breakdowns or that her nervousness would make it impossible to consummate the marriage. To another man these would have been insurmountable problems, but he accepted and dealt with them with unfailing devotion, organising their lives around her needs and her writing. He never doubted her genius, and against all the odds their marriage gave them both happiness to the end - even though, as late as 1935, she could complain in her diary of his not being a gentleman.\n\nHe worked as a journalist, writing and editing, gave serious support to causes such as the cooperative movement and its feminist branch, the Women's Co-operative Guild, to the League of Nations and to the Fabian Society. He stood as a socialist for parliament in 1922, unsuccessfully. He saw the barbarity of the Soviet regime and rejected it. He wrote much on international affairs and advised the Labour party on them. In the long run, he felt all his political activities had made not a jot of difference to the world, which is probably true of most political activity - in his circle, only Keynes can be said to have changed things. But he was trusted, admired and depended on by his political associates, and he stood up consistently for his belief that cruelty and barbarism must never be accepted as necessary to any struggle: something politicians need to be regularly reminded of.\n\nTo provide a calm shared activity with his wife he bought a small hand printing press they could run together and set up a publishing business that became one of the best in the country. The Hogarth Press published TS Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, translations of Gorky, Bunin and Freud, and all Virginia's books. They made money, and as the years passed their plain living was modified: a car was acquired, foreign holidays taken and a bathroom installed in their Sussex house.\n\nThe strength of Glendinning's account is that she has absorbed the great mass of Bloomsbury books, gossip and letters and emerged with her own clear view of how things were. Moreover, she writes so well that we trust her. One example, about the Woolfs' life in the 1920s, shows how subtle and wise she can be: \"Virginia could not be left for long. Their close companionship ... provided the loving and secure base which made it possible for her to take risks with herself and her writing ... It was becoming a co-dependency. Leonard had grown to need her need of him ... He did not use Virginia's vulnerability as an excuse not to do things, but her vulnerability legitimated an existing tendency in him towards self-limitation ... From his early middle-age, he had an aura of controlled or reserved potency.\"\n\nThe onset of another episode of madness brought Virginia's suicide in 1941, coinciding with the blitz and the likelihood of a German invasion. Black times, but almost at once Leonard fell in love again, with Trekkie Parsons, the wife of a fellow publisher, and they settled into a cheerful, unorthodox arrangement in which she divided her time between the two men. She gave him much happiness, sharing his passion for gardening and bringing comfort, amusement and colour - she was a painter - into his later years. He was always attractive to women, and during his last decade he also enjoyed constant visits from a much younger one, Virginia Browne-Wilkinson, whom he loved and trusted well enough to ask her to help him end his own life when he felt the time had come. She consulted a doctor, who was unable to help, and so he endured the indignity of four months' helplessness at the end. At least he was saved by Trekkie and Virginia from being sent to hospital, and so allowed to die at home.\n\nWhen the second Virginia had challenged him about the meaning of his much-repeated mantra, \"Nothing matters\", he amended it to \"Nothing matters, and everything matters\". The second version is better and truer. Like Horatio, he was a man who took fortune's buffets and rewards with equal thanks. He never sought a leading role, but lived wisely and well, and this absorbing and excellent biography does him justice."
