        "text": "Leonard Sidney Woolf was born in Kensington, London, to Sidney Woolf QC and Marie de Jongh. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he befriended Saxon Sydney-Turner, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, and Thoby Stephen (son of Sir Leslie Stephen, brother of Virginia and Vanessa). Out of these friendships of the so-called 'Apostles' the 'Bloomsbury Group' emerged.\n\nIn 1904, Woolf joined the Colonial Civil Service in Ceylon but resigned in 1912 because of his growing disillusionment with imperialism, but also because he had fallen in love with Virginia Stephen. Leonard and Virginia married in 1912 and Virginia took Leonard's family name. After Virginia's death in 1941, Woolf continued to oversee and publish her uncollected essays and a selection of her diaries.\n\nWoolf was a member of the Fabian Society and in 1916 wrote two Fabian reports that were to become part of the basis of the League of Nations. His anti-imperialism, socialism, and internationalism found expression in a number of books and pamphlets, and from 1919 to 1945 he served as secretary to the Labour Party's advisory committees on international and imperial questions. Woolf also became involved in editing the Nation, the Political Quarterly and the New Statesman. More significantly, he and Virginia established the Hogarth Press in 1917. In 1942, he provided the Introduction to Mulk Raj Anand's Letters to India.\n\nLeonard Woolf suffered a stroke and died on 14 August 1969 at Monk's House, a cottage in Rodmell he and Virginia had bought in 1919.\n\nThe Village in the Jungle (London: Edward Arnold, 1913)\n\nThe Wise Virgins: A Story of Words, Opinions, and a Few Emotions (London: Edward Arnold, 1914)\n\nCo-Operation and the Future of Industry (London: Allen & Unwin, 1918)\n\nEconomic Imperialism (London and New York: Swarthmore, 1920)\n\nEmpire and Commerce in Africa: A Study in Economic Imperialism (London: Allen & Unwin, 1920)\n\nMandates and Empire (League of Nations Union, 1920)\n\nInternational Co-Operative Trade (London: Fabian, 1922)\n\nAfter the Deluge: A Study of Communal Psychology (London: Hogarth Press, 1931)\n\nThe Intelligent Man's Way to Prevent War (London: Gollancz, 1933)\n\n(with Mary Adams) The Modern State (London: Allen & Unwin, 1933)\n\n(with Virginia Woolf) Quack, Quack!: Essays on Unreason and Superstition in Poltics, Belief and Thought (London: Leonard and Virginia Woolf, 1935)\n\nAfter the Deluge, Vol. 2 (London: Hogarth Press, 1939)\n\nBarbarians at the Gate (London: Victor Gollancz, 1939)\n\nThe Hotel (London: Hogarth Press, 1939)\n\nThe War for Peace (London: Routledge, 1940)\n\nForeign Policy: The Labour Party's Dilemma (London: Fabian Publications, 1947)\n\nPrincipia Politica: A Study of Communal Psychology (London: Hogarth Press, 1953)\n\nSowing: An Autobiography of the Years 1880-1904 (London: Hogarth Press, 1960)\n\nGrowing: An Autobiography of the Years 1904-1911 (London: Hogarth Press, 1961)\n\nDiaries in Ceylon, 1908-1911.
