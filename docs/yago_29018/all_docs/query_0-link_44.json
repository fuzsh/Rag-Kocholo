        "text": "LETTERS OF LEONARD WOOLF Edited by Frederic Spotts. Illustrated. 616 pp. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $29.95.\n\nThe world knows Leonard Woolf today best as ''Virginia's husband'' - the highly disciplined British colonial servant who came to London after seven years in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and married her in 1912; and who for three decades protected her against her moods of madness and manic depression, thus enabling her to write her novels, polemical essays and reviews. Fewer persons know him as one of the founders of the League of Nations (behind the scenes) or as adviser on international affairs to the British Labor Party or as the author of a classic novel, ''The Village in the Jungle.'' He also wrote a remarkable autobiography, edited a series of British leftist journals and founded the Hogarth Press, which published Freud, T. S. Eliot and Virginia's books. Frederic Spotts, who has judiciously edited this volume, describes Woolf as a Briton ''whose scope and variety of accomplishments were equaled by few other Englishmen of the century.'' To read these brilliant letters, 600 of them, selected from the 8,000 that survive, is to find confirmation of this view.\n\nI had the good fortune to meet Woolf on a number of occasions and talk with him in Monk's House, in Lewes, Sussex, where he and Virginia lived for many years. He spoke as he wrote: always to the point. He could be brusque and impatient - I have a memory of his voice thundering at me, ''Don't touch that dog, I'm training him,'' when I showed sympathy for one of his shaggy tail-waggers - but even when he commanded he had a distinct charm. The photographs show a lined unsmiling face, somewhat severe and even grim. Readers will discover in this volume a more relaxed countenance. He maintained tropical plants in his hothouse; he owned small jungle creatures at various times. He used to write me one- or two-sentence letters in answer to questions, and they came usually in previously used envelopes with pasted-over slips on the old addresses. (This sign of parsimony reflected his early struggles in Putney after the death of his father, a distinguished barrister.) There is, for example, in his correspondence some of this parsimony when he writes to Edward Albee giving permission for the dramatist to use Virginia's name in the title ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' But he manages in two sentences also to thank Mr. Albee for his courtesy in asking. And a bit later he writes again to say how much he enjoyed the play.\n\nIn his more controversial letters to his fellow committeemen in politics or to editors or to British Labor ministers, he was uncompromising. He never followed a party line. Fashioned at Cambridge University at the same time as Keynes, Strachey, Clive Bell and others of the later Bloomsbury, he developed from the first an acute independence. He was nobody's man, he belonged distinctly to himself, this young man who set out for the colonies with 90 volumes of Voltaire in his luggage and his pet dog for company.\n\nThis terseness and speaking to the point contrast with the dazzle and effervescent fireworks of Virginia Woolf's correspondence. Mr. Spotts, an independent scholar, accurately describes Leonard's letters as coming ''straight from the heart and head, with no frills or artifice or weasel words, and little or no desire to entertain or amuse.'' Yet they amuse by the use of irony, a quality Woolf shared with Strachey. He could be sharp or gentle; above all, we see him trying to be fair. He was a man who insisted on speaking the truth as he saw it.\n\nMr. Spotts has divided the letters into a series of chapters, each with its own chronology and each introduced with a few pages of exemplary biography. We see Woolf, the young Jew from Putney, assimilated into the British stream, traveling from Cambridge to Ceylon, where he finds himself caught up in an outpost of British imperialism. Later he will write the novel ''The Village in the Jungle,'' showing the struggle for survival between devouring nature and domineering colonialism. Woolf had to struggle against local ignorance, poverty and attrition. He was a magistrate and presided at hangings; he shot cattle that had foot-and-mouth disease, supervised pearl fishermen and on the side studied Tamil and Sinhalese as well as Buddhism. This brought him closer to the Ceylonese than to most of his drinking and tennis- and bridge-playing colleagues, with whom Woolf easily fraternized but from whom he felt alienated. This section of the volume relies almost entirely on Woolf's letters from his outpost to Lytton Strachey. ''God, how I work,'' he exclaims, adding at once, ''I have reduced it to a method & exalted it to a mania.'' The method and the mania worked so well that he ended up governing a thousand square miles and a population of 100,000. There were, too, long periods of boredom, tropical discomfort, illnesses and deep despair. In the midst of great loneliness on one occasion he loaded his gun but did not succumb to his suicidal impulse. He was equipped, we can see, for the manic moods, depressions and ultimate suicide of Virginia.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
