Find it by the use of the ^F function on that page.\n\nINTRODUCTION*\n\nReaders of my publications on both the Boeriana and Islamica pages will notice a certain perspective common to all . In most cases it is there as background. In some cases it is more explicitly spelled out as in the following publications, the texts of which are found on the BOERIANA page.\n\nChristians and Mobilization\n\nCaught in the Middle, Chapter 15\n\nMissionary Messengers...., pp. 484ff\n\nMissions: Heralds of Capitalism or Christ?, Ch. 9.\n\nStudies in Christian-Muslim Relations,\n\nVol. 1, \"Introduction\", pp. 16-24\n\nVol. 5, all of Part 2\n\nVol. 8, all of Part 2\n\nSee Point F. under What Others Say .\n\nThis perspective is known to its adherents by various names, the most common ones being \"Kuyperian(ism),\" \"Neo-Kuyperian(ism),\" \"Reformational,\" and \"Neo-Calvinist.\" It stands in the Calvinist tradition, but is a further development of it pioneered by a movement initiated by a man called ABRAHAM KUYPER (1837-1920) in The Netherlands, but now spread around the globe.\n\nBy no means all Reformed scholars are familiar with either Abraham Kuyper or with the Reformational movement, the philosophical tradition that started to develop already during his day, but has since blossomed into an international movement. Apart from those who have never heard of it, there are scholars, including Reformed ones, who oppose or reject the entire tradition. However, amongst those there is also a considerable number who recognize it as a valid and respectable philosophical tradition and will readily acknowledge Kuypers genius.\n\nIts viability is, among others, indicated by that fact that the movement includes not only an international group of individual scholars and activists, but also a respectable number of educational, social, labour, political and media institutions in The Netherlands itself, but also in Canada, the USA, South Africa, Korea, Hungary and a number of other countries.\n\nIn Canada, the home country of this website, the most effective, productive and famous social pioneering activist of this movement is the late Gerald (\"Jerry\") Vandezande, who was honoured with the Order of Canada for his efforts. You are encouraged to read:\n\nBen Volman, Gerald Vandezande: Canada's unassuming prophet-Life lessons from a Christian social activist. Citizens for Public Justice, August 4, 2009. For a shortened version go to Faith Today, the bimonthly of the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada (EFC), July/August 2009, pp. 24-28.\n\nIn a side bar to the above article in Faith Today under the title What else can we learn from Jerry Vandezande? we read the following from Ben Volman:\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp John Redekop, adjunct professor of political science at Trinity Western University in Langley, B.C., and past president of the EFC, says, Do not hesitate to tackle issues. If you believe that you are morally right, then no issue is too daunting or too controversial for a clear Christian response. Don't expect to win all the struggles but don't give up too soon. Christians are required to be faithful, not successful. Fight for causes, not against people.\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lorna Dueck, regular Globe & Mail columnist, president of Media Voice Generation and executive producer and host of the television program ListenUp, says: Jerry was persistent, tireless, kind, diligent and wise. His message was never to forget that the poor need your voice, the broken need your strength and the lost need your help in direction, and that evil can be systemic and needs to be corrected at many levels.\n\n&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Charles Pascal, executive director of the Atkinson Foundation, says: We need to learn his tenacity. A phrase that describes Jerry is visionary incrementalist. He has always had a clear vision that the future has to be safer and more just for all Canadians. But to move to that better vision requires incrementalism. How do we get to that better future? With tenacity: baby steps and giant steps. And I never saw anyone with more optimism about the human spirit. He has tenacity and optimism.\n\nAnother significant indication is the quality of the publishers who publish the steady stream of books and articles that emerges out of this tradition. They are among the most distinguished in the world: Brill – thats a sure tell-tale sign –, McGill-Queens University Press, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, Clarke-Irwin, Harvard University Press. If you dont find them on this page, you will on the Guest Articles page.\n\nSELECTIVE ENGLISH BIBLIOGRAPHY*\n\nKuyper Writings*\n\nAn Announcement: New Society to Translate Kuypers Works. CC, Dec. 26, 2011.\n\nJordan J.

This project can be accessed at: https://abrahamkuyper.com\n\nLexham Press is pleased to announce the publication of a major series of new translations of Abraham Kuypers key works in public theology. Never before available in English, these works will introduce a new audience to the thoughts of one of Christianitys most thoughtful public theologians. Comprised of 8 key works spread over 12 volumes, this series will be made available in both a high-quality hardback edition and an enhanced electronic Logos edition. https://abrahamkuyper.com/\n\nOn Islam\n\nOn Islam compiles Kuypers significant writings on Islam. This anthology will allow readers to follow Kuypers model for observing another faith and its cultural ramifications from an informed Christian point of view. It will be of particular relevance for todays readerswho live in a world where Islams role on the global scene is visible and controversial, its future so significant, and its relationship with Christianity so decisive for both faiths.\n\nAt the Manger. Acton Commentary, January 3 2018.

Grand Rapids: Piet Hein Publishers, 1950. Original title: Het Sociale Vraagstuk en de Christelijke Religie. Amsterdam: Wormser, 1891.\n\nThe URL below is that of the Jellema translation: http://www.reformationalpublishingproject.com/pdf_books/Scanned_Books_PDF/ChristianityandtheClassStruggle.pdf\n\nNotes from Jan H. Boer, the proprietor of this website:\n\n(1) On the dedication page of the Jellema translation you will see three sets of initials. They represent the names of the following highly respected scholars at Calvin College:\n\nW. H. J.  William Harry Jellema\n\nH. S.  Henry Stob\n\nH. Z.  Henry Zylstra\n\nIt is interesting that Dirk Jellema – whether related to WHJ, I do not know – chose those three scholars. Indeed, they were first-rate scholars, but this book is about fiery passion for the poor, not a characteristic for which these men were famous. I refer you to my book Nigerias Decades of Blood 1980-2002, pp. 22-23 for further thoughts along this line. Go to that book on the Islamica page of this website.\n\nIt is significant that Nicholas Wolterstorff dedicates his small but powerful book, Reason within the Bounds of Religion, to the same three scholars in these words: To one Harry and two Henrys – Jellema, Stob, Zylstra – who twenty-five years ago first gave me a vision of what it is to be a Christian scholar. (For that book itself go to the GUEST ARTICLES page on this website.)\n\n(2) It is interesting that during the very month this entry is written – September, 2016 – the Canadian magazine Macleans features an infomercial from the Christian Labour Association of Canada (CLAC) that is a direct product of the Kuyperian tradition as it has developed in Canada and can truthfully claim to represent the passion and insights Kuyper expresses in his book of so long ago. Here is a successful example of a contemporary application of the Kuyperian tradition in another culture, both philosophically and structurally (Macleans, pp. 32-35). Jellema and Stob, two of the scholars to whom this translation is dedicated, did not favour the rise of the CLAC as a culturally inappropriate transplant of Kuyperian thought to Canada that would discredit the tradition. If they could see whats on the ground today, they would have to eat their words! Apart from the power of faith and the God this tradition seeks to serve, these scholars did not realize the power of the superior logic inherent in this tradition that was able to overcome the dualistic logic of their secular Canadian challengers even in the secular (!) courts.\n\nThe Practice of Godliness. Transl. Marian M. Schoolland. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1948.\n\nThe Work of the Holy Spirit, trans. Hencdrik de Vries. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1941, 1946. This work can be accessed at: www.ccel.org AND http://www.calvin.edu/library/database/crcpi/fulltext/ctj/122693.pdf. Original title: Het werk van de Heilige Geest.\n\n\"Even though we honor the Father and believe on the Son, how little do we live in the Holy Spirit!\" Throughout the history of the Christian tradition, the Holy Spirit has been one of the most elusive aspects of the faith. During Kuyper's time, very little attention had been given to the person and works of the Holy Spirit. Kuyper recognized this void, and as the editor of the weekly religious publication entitled The Herald, Kuyper dedicated approximately one hundred short entries to the works of the Holy Spirit. The Work of the Holy Spirit is a compilation of these entries organized into three Volumes. Volume One addresses the influence of the Holy Spirit in the Church as a whole, while Volumes Two and Three focus on the works of the Holy Spirit in the individual. Kuyper's entries provide a comprehensive study of the Holy Spirit, exploring in detail how the Holy Spirit sanctifies both the Church and its members.\n\nEmmalon Davis\n\nCCEL Staff Writer (see above CCEL URL.)\n\nMore comments on the above book can be accessed at: http://stevebishop.blogspot.com/2011_08_01_archive.html\n\n\"A turning point in my life!\" – Herman Dooyeweerd\n\nThought provoking! Abraham Kuypers Pentecost is a sort of systematic theology written from the viewpoint of pneumatology. Dealing with the centrality of the human heart, that focal point of ones existence where God works within an individual, Kuyper directs his attention to the relatively lesser-read Christians. Conversational in style, short and incisive, he calls his readers to repentance by accepting the Holy Spirit as God who came to live among and within His people. His meditations include frequent quotations from the Dutch Psalter and Biblical references. Uplifting!\n\nThe Implications of Public Confession, trans. H. Zylstra.

A brief survey of Kuypers works and lectures revealed his back and forth views on the values and fears of formal liturgies in worship. Notice John H. Woods periodization of Kuypers views (from Witvliets presentation): https://centralmn.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/reflections-from-the-evangelical-theological-society-part-ii/\n\nThe following comments are from the URL below:\n\nDe Heraut from 11 Jan 1891 - 29 March 1891.\n\nFor Kuyper 'Baptism is not complete without its complement, the Holy Supper'.

It was originally published in English in 1934 by Zondervan. It has since been republished by Federation of Protestant Reformed People's Societies (1934) and by Kessinger Publishing as a print-on-demand book (2010).\n\nVoor Distel een Murt comprised 44 devotions on the sacraments, baptism, public confession and the Lord's supper. The twelve on public confession make up this booklet. They were originally written for, and published taking the 'holy supper'. In these short chapters Kuyper examines the nature of this public confession. He looks at the 'who' and 'why' questions, as well as the questions of church membership and tithing.

Prometheus (Netherlands), September 2020. Paperback 400 pp.\n\nA century ago, 1921, the most famous Dutchman died. That is to say, besides Queen Wilhelmina, Kuyper was the only Dutchman to appear on the front page of The New York Times. Kuyper was a wonder child with ten heads and a hundred arms, elected in 1906 as the most popular man next to the most vigorous woman, the young Queen.\n\nThis book or portrait opens up surprising perspectives on the seven of his colourful lives. To begin with, the adventurer: alpinist and world traveler. Then there are those for which he is better known: a celebrated orator, scientist, activist, journalist and statesman. Each chapter is based on new sources, always with biographical disclosures.\n\nTogether, these chapters offer a caleidoscopic image of a man whose multi-sidedness was surpassed only by his improbable productivity. He wrote more than two hundred books, ten thousand articles, traveled half the world and was a fanatic mountaineer.\n\nHe had more admirers than opponents, but his sworn enemies comprised of almost the complete Dutch elite, including the young Queen. At the same time, he was praised as a statesman and dined with kings and emperors.\n\nTim de Wit, Review of above in Jonge Historici, March 8, 2021.\n\nHarry Van Dyke—Bibliography\n\nAuthor unknown, transl.

I, on the other hand, regard this book as one of the most significant, most informative and most interesting of recent English-language Reformational publications. Hence I lure you into reading this book by providing you with the information below right here on this page, instead of hiding it in an attachment. Some of the chapters emphasizing the Bavinck contribution to this tradition are also found in the Bavinck section of this website, while the one about the headscarf also appears on the Islamica page.\n\nPaul Wells, Foreword, pp. x-xi:\n\nWells summarizes the naked Neo-Calvinistic truth so resented by French academia and concludes that France is a highly conservative country hidden behind libertarian rhetoric.\n\nJames Eglinton, Preface, p. xii:\n\nEglinton writes, Since the late 1990s, neo-Calvinism has enjoyed a resurgence of international scholarly interest. This has largely been centred on the ever-increasing availability of its foremost thinkers, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, in English. That having been said, this movement should not be typecast as an exclusively Anglophone occurrence. Bavinck and Kuyper are now being read in Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish, Hungarian, Russian, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese. In the global undertaking that is Christian theology, they are finding their place in often surprising contexts.\n\nThe growth of engagement with neo-Calvinism is, however, particularly strong in North America. There, numerous conferences, periodicals, websites and books encourage research on neo-Calvinism. It is home to both the Kuyper Center of Public Theology (Princeton Theological Seminary) and the Bavinck Institute (Calvin Theological Seminary). At present, North America is the scene of a great exchange of ideas between neo-Calvinism and other theological traditions. By contrast, little comparable scholarly infrastructure has been developed in neo-Calvinisms native Europe.\n\nComments by Boer, the proprietor of this website:\n\n1. The above comments give the impression that Neo-Calvinism is primarily a theological tradition. However, it is much wider: it is a total worldview tradition covering every field of academic endeavour and every aspect of life. Neo-Calvinist scholars are found in all disciplines and its activists in numerous social causes and crusades.\n\n2. Eglinton for some strange reason has failed to mention what is probably the most aggressive Neo-Calvinist institution in North America, namely the post-graduate Institute of Church & Society of Toronto, Canada. Surely, the ICS deserves pride of place in this lineup. It is, furthermore, the prime example of the broad scope of Neo-Calvinism beyond theology.\n\nChapter headings and authors:\n\nChapter 1: James Bratt, Abraham Kuyper and the French Revolution, pp. 1-12.\n\nChapter 2: George Harinck: Herman Bavinck and the Neo-Calvinist Concept of the French Revolution, pp. 13-28.\n\nChapter 3: James Eglinton, From Babel to Pentecost via Paris and Amsterdam: Multilingualism in Neo-Calvinist and Revolutionary Thought, pp. 29-60.

James E. McGoldrick\n\nIn his English-language book on Kuyper, Abraham Kuyper: God's Renaissance Man, (Evangelical Press, 2000), author James E. McGoldrick introduces him as follows:\n\nWhile common people have always been the backbone and mainstay of the church, exceptional leaders such as Augustine of Hippo..., John Wycliffe, Martin Luther and John Calvin have appeared at crucial times to serve their undistinguished brothers and sisters in the faith. Such a champion... appeared in the second half of the nineteenth century when Abraham Kuyper became the dynamic leader of Protestants in the Netherlands.\n\nKuyper was a person of massive intelligence, immense learning, terrific energy and zealous faith. He... received great adulation from...the working and lower middle classes, many of whom struggled to survive economically and few of whom could afford a higher education. Throughout his long career as a pastor, journalist, educator and political leader, Kuyper maintained close contact with the common people and communicated with them effectively, even though he was far above them in intellect and formal learning (pp. 7-8).\n\nGoldrick's list of heroes is hardly exhaustive and should certainly have included Thomas Aquinas, but the position he ascribes to Kuyper is clear. He may not be as well-known in English-speaking culture, but that is because of language problems, not because he does not deserve to be there.\n\nReviews by Jacob Aitken and others\n\nA journalist, a theologian, a pastor, a prime minister, few people can boast of having such dimensions to their careers! Yet such was the remarkable life of Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920), who played a major role in helping modern Christians to develop a consistently biblical and practical world-view, not only in his native country of the Netherlands, but throughout much of the world. All of life belongs to God. In Kuypers own words, No single piece of our mental world is to be hermetically sealed off from the rest, and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry: Mine!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Gods-Renaissance-Man-Abraham-Kuyper/dp/0852344465\n\nB. Charles Colson\n\nColson was a powerful White House personality who was involved in Nixon's Watergate and landed in prison. His prison experience led him to become a Christian. Before his death, he became a major national spokesman in the US for the Christian community with his radio programme Breakpoint and his Prison Fellowship campaign. He was a popular speaker. I have witnessed him waving Kuyper's Stone Lectures, delivered at Princeton University over a century ago, before his audiences as containing the seed perspective needed for the healing of America. Heres a man at the vortex of American culture who has seen it all; his was no pie in the sky. Here are two quotes from Colson:\n\n\"The great Dutch Calvinist Abraham Kuyper said the battle facing Christians today is between comprehensive life systems – in which principle must bear witness against principle, worldview against worldview, spirit against spirit.\" – A Dangerous Grace\n\nAbraham Kuyper was a profound theologian, an encyclopedic thinker, and a deeply spiritual man who believed that it is the believers task to know God in all his works. In a day when secular science is seeking to establish hegemony over all knowing, and when postmodern art is threatening to bring an end to art, Kuypers solid, biblical insights can help to restore perspective and sanity to these two critical areas of human life. – Founder, Prison Fellowship & Colson Center for Christian Worldview\n\nThis is the burden of Colson's writings: to develop a bibilically-grounded worldview. The name Kuyper occurs throughout his books. The development of a Biblical worldview was/is a major concern in both Kuyper's writings (Kuyperiana) and my own (Boeriana).\n\nC. Robert Butler\n\nRobert Butler is an Afro-American who sought for a perspective or platform from which to launch a ministry in the inner city. After a long search he settled on the Kuyperian perspective. He explained, \"I found the Kuyperian model to be exactly what I was looking for.\" (Calvin Mosaic, Spring 2000).\n\nD. Richard Lovelace\n\nA much-published American authority on revivals and spirituality. In a recent lecture on Kuyper, he pleaded that Christians should pray for 500 Kuypers with his intellect and Spirit-filled mind.\n\nE. H. Evan Runner\n\nThis Irish-German American philosopher who died in March, 2002, wrote the following some decades ago:\n\nAfter nineteen centuries of history the Church is here for the first time in possession of a worked-out theoretical accounting of the world of culture and of the Christian's relation to it.\n\nF. Joel Carpenter\n\nJoel Carpenter, formerly of Pew Foundation and now at Calvin College, has outlined the way this school of thought is influencing Christian higher education throughout North America and producing leading scholars. It is a world-affirming perspective that is as wide as life itself. As Carpenter put it:\n\nKuyper's solution to the problem of competing worldviews in his native Netherlands was to embrace pluralism and to emphasize the value-laden, commitment-driven nature of knowledge. He reasoned that people quite naturally formed communities of the like-minded that shared a singular view of reality, a distinctive pattern for living and a socio-political agenda. A just society would recognize this social, intellectual and religious pluralism and encourage the various communities to negotiate the common good.\n\nLikewise, Kuyper insisted, one's knowledge of the world was inevitably coloured and shaped by one's prior commitments-most fundamentally, religious commitments-concerning the nature of reality. Knowing was never value-free; science could not be completely objective. Scientific naturalism thus had no claim to a privileged position over against other worldviews.\n\nKuyper was not calling for the fragmentation of public life, however. Given God's common grace, he argued, there would be much overlap in human's efforts to understand nature and humanity, and thus opportunities for conversation, debate and negotiation, both in learning and politics. Yet the social-intellectual and religious differences that drove outlooks and agendas were real, and they should not be forced into unitary national establishments, whether religious, intellectual or political. Various communities of faith and values could play public roles, yet not feel compelled to choose between domination, accommodation or withdrawal. They would have the social and intellectual space to work out their particular convictions, but would retain the right to put their ideas into play on an equal basis.

Isaac Mutua\n\nDuring a 2011 international conference dealing with the Kuyperian perspective, the Kenyan scholar Isaac Njaramba Mutua said,\n\nWhat touched me was the heartfelt desire and the wholehearted determination to establish a relationship between faith with all sectors of life and society. This rich… (Kuyperian) tradition in which… Christians everywhere are interested, as this conference clearly indicated, contains the challenge to develop and protect….\n\nThis has forced me into the…work of Herman Dooyeweerd…. Others who have motivated me include Naugle, Plantinga, Goheen and Bartholomew, Wilkens and Sanford’s, Sunshine’s, Skillen, Kuyper, Newbigin,…Wolters and a host of important Western Scholars who offer a good critique of the Western thought. Fowler has continued to be an inspiration together with BJ van der Walt whom I am critically evaluating in my study. As I reflect on this during my study journey, I am strongly motivated by Abraham Kuyper’s confessions in Lectures on Calvinism… (http://www.cpchea.org/).\n\nAll the people mentioned in that above paragraph are either overt Kuyperians or heavily influenced by that tradition.\n\nH. James Bratt\n\nBratt is a historian at Calvin College with specialization in the Kuyper tradition. In reaction to a Kuyper conference held at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1998, Bratt pointed to Kuyper’s notion of\n\n…how to handle a plurality of religious convictions in public life. He wanted people of all faiths to be vocal in public life, in the public sphere. He said a person is one whole person; whether Christian or Islam or Marxist that set of beliefs will affect your point of view and cannot be separated.\n\nYou look at North America today, you look at Africa today … those are burning questions. How do societies deal with plurality of religious beliefs? Kuyper had some thoughts on such questions and I think we would do well to pay attention to him.\n\nBratt compared Kuyper to “such modern-day Americans as Martin Luther King, Jr., Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson, all of whom possess(ed) Kuyperian qualities such as intellect, persuasion, mass organization and political savvy.” Asked about Kuyper’s relevance today, Bratt said, “He was asking questions 100 years ago that Evangelicals and Mainline Protestants are asking today.”\n\nMore important, Kuyper answered those questions in ways that could be useful to soldiers in today’s culture wars. How to remain true to one’s faith in a multi-faith society? How to blend faith and politics coherently? How to be Christian to the core and avoid either dropping out or giving in? He makes you think about the question more and come up with your own solution…. That’s what makes him really valuable now.\n\nI. Kwama Bediako\n\nThe Ghanian scholar Kwama Bediako, during a visit to the campus of Calvin College and Seminary in Grand Rapids MI, participated in a discussion that featured a heavy emphasis on Thomas Jefferson, a major father figure in the political formation of the USA. One Calvin scholar asked Bediako whether West Africa was not badly in need of their own Jefferson, to which he responded, “What Africa needs even more today is its own Abraham Kuyper.” The person who had raised the question confessed to being “stunned, delighted and mildly embarrassed as the room broke out in applause.”\n\nJ. Iskander Saher\n\nI have in front of me a letter from an Indonesian brother, Iskander Saher, a social activist in his own (Islamic) country, who wrote, “I found that it is what we need in Indonesia,” the “it” referring to the wholism of the Kuyperian tradition.\n\nK. John Vriend\n\nThe late John Vriend – he died suddenly in February, 2002 – was a professional translator of Dutch literature that came out of the Kuyperian movement. He told me that he was getting enough letters of inquiry from all over the world that he came to the tentative conclusion that the real Kuyper century was not the 20th but the 21st. Well, the world could do worse. (For further details on Mutua, Bratt, Bediako, Saher and Vriend, go to my Every Square Inch—A Missionary Memoir, vol. 4, pp. 45-52, as listed in my Bibliography on the Boeriana page of this website.)\n\nL. Gerald Vanderzande\n\nFor close to 50 years Gerald Vanderzande, Toronto, has worked for social justice under the auspices of Citizens for Public Justice (CPJ). He did this very deliberately from a Kuyperian perspective. In 2001, he was awarded with the Order of Canada by the Governor General of Canada. See CPJ website www.cpj.ca.\n\nM. Josiah Idowu-Fearon – Bishop of Kaduna Diocese (Anglican Communion), Nigeria\n\nIn a prepared introduction to a lecture I was to deliver, he wrote:\n\n“He (Boer) has also introduced another term “Kuyper(ian), a term I came across in the year 2000 while reading up for my research at Ahmadu Bello University. As he has said and I agree with, for Nigeria to develop evenly and make any progress, we have no option but endorse this concept as the only safe future for us as a country and those coming after us.”\n\nN. David Koyzis, Kuyper's Moment. Christian Courier, December 15, 2015. 15Dec14c.pdf (christiancourier.ca)\n\nNearly a century after his death, Abraham Kuypers moment may finally have arrived. It was a long time in coming.\n\nAt a time when an increasingly aggressive secularism is challenging a biblical witness in so many areas, Kuyper once again offers the tools we need to live obediently as redeemed sinners in the public realm—every square inch of it.\n\nAfter a brief flirtation with Anabaptism and Pacifism, a friend alerted me to the writings put out by the old Wedge Publishing Foundation and the Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto. Among other things, I read H. Evan Runners Scriptural Religion and Political Task and The Relation of the Bible to Learning. Runners dictum that life is religion strongly resonated with me, as did Kuyper s commitment to the comprehensive lordship of God in Christ over the whole of life. Here was something worth celebrating. Biblical truths that had previously been in the background for me suddenly came alive and made sense in a new way.\n\nBut almost none of my Christian friends and family had heard of Kuyper or know of the vibrant intellectual tradition associated with his legacy. But the notion of a Christian statesman seeking to honour God in concrete political service was far from view.\n\n(Much of Koyzis' article describes a library of English works on and by Kuyper already published as well as those in process.)\n\nKuyper's moment may at last have come. My hope is that, with the increasing availability of Kuyper's writings in English, more North American Christians will immerse themselves in his world and in his distinctive piety. At a time when an increasingly aggressive secularism is challenging a biblical witness in so many areas, Kuyper once again offers the tools we need to live obediently as redeemed sinners in the public realm--every square inch of it.\n\n– Kuypers Moment, CC, December 15, 2015.\n\nO.

Nicholas Wolterstorff\n\nTo what does Nicholas Wolterstorff credit his vast and multiform philosophical achievements that have launched him as one of the most distinguished Christian philosophers of our day? Above all else, he points to his Dutch reformed heritage, heavily influenced by the thought of Abraham Kuyper. A Kuyperian vision of vigorous practical and intellectual Christian cultural engagement serves as a foundation and impulse for Wolterstorff, launching him into every corner of the philosophical arena, from ethics, metaphysics and epistemology, to politics, art and education. Behind it all is a sustained theological chord that keeps to the fore his concern that his work might serve people and particularly those who suffer.\n\nBio to Wolterstorffs Gifford Lectures.

Justus M. van der Kroef\n\nFew men in modern Dutch history have played such a significant role as Abraham Kuyper. A theologian of European renown, a church reformer whose activities lastingly changed the existing church order in his country, a statesman who during five decades of an active political career combined his religion with a unique theory of government, and last but not least, a journalist and outstanding man of letters, Kuyper, during the course of his long life, placed a stamp upon the civilization of the Netherlands which it never was to lose. The immense breadth of his intellect, sustained by a tremendous energy, allowed him to speak with authority on subjects ranging from Calvins concept of grace, through Islamic architecture, to the future of colonial reform and earned him the epithet of Abraham de Geweldige (Abraham the Magnificent). His greatest achievement, however, was the foundation of a system of religious dogma upon which he erected a political and social philosophy which in the Protestant Netherlands since 1850 was the only one of lasting influence.\n\nOriginally published in December 1948; online July 1, 2009 as an abstract under the title Abraham Kuyper and the Rise of Neo-Calvinism in the Netherlands. Accessed September 15, 2016.\n\nS. Nature Sings: The beautiful picture of the Seminary Pond (summer 2016) spoke to me along with the words of Abraham Kuyper quoted on the bottom of the page: In everything that lives in nature, rustles, throbs and stirs itself, we feel the pulse beat of Gods own life.\n\nIve been a pastor for over 50 years and am a great admirer of Kuyper. For six years, I pastored with Native American people and this quote reminded me of a Native American prayer that contains these words: Make my hands respect the things you have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice. Let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock. – John Helmus, Calvin College Alumni Spark Magazine, winter 2016\n\nT. Nowadays, if you want to talk to the people of The Netherlands about Abraham Kuyper, you need to explain just who he was: preacher, theologian, statesman, journalist. He was founder of the first Dutch political party, the ARP or Anti-Revolutionary Party, in 1879, as well as of the Free University in Amsterdam, 1880. In addition, he was Premier (1901-1905) and advocate for the masses, the poor Reformed people who seceded from the former state church.\n\nIn the US, Kuypers brand of Neo-Calvinism has for some years been up and kicking. Amazon markets over a hundred English-language books about him. The theological seminary of the Princeton University boasts the largest collection of Kuyperiana in the world, while it also sports an Abraham Kuyper (AK) Centre, an AK Prize, an AK academic chair and publishes the Abraham Kuyper Review. – Bert Wagendorf, Betsy Loves Abraham. De Volkskrant, February 10, 2017. Transl. Jan H. Boer.\n\nThen Bala told me his story. When he was young, he wanted to become a football player, but a pastor of the Christian Reformed Church-Nigeria (CRC-N) told him that if he chose football as a vocation, he would go to hell. So Bala stopped going to church. Somehow he ran into Abraham Kuyper, who blessed him and said that even football can be done to Gods honour and glory. Then he came back to the CRC-N and eventually to TCNN. So Kuyper (and Jesus) is his saviour.\n\nLetter from Professor Tim Palmer of the Theological College of Northern Nigeria about one of his students—December 19, 2012.
