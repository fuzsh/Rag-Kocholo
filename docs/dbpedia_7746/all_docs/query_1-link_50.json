        "text": "It is now rightly taken for granted that the Christian faith is to be professed in a post-Christendom context. The public sphere in Western democracies has become one which is a mix of the secular, the Christian, the post-Christian, multicultural and multifaith. With respect to Western civilisation Jurgen Habermas describes the present as being one which is post-secular and must now acknowledge the power of religion in the public sphere1: that religious reference for him is no longer necessarily Christian. How can it be with the rise of Islam, in particular, in his own immediate context of Europe? In a similar vein, writing on the Australian Soul Gary Bouma refers to the eclipse of the secularisation hypothesis which imagined all religions would gradually disappear and to its replacement with the resurgence of spirituality.\n\nThe theology of Dutch pastor and politician Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) is presently experiencing something of a renaissance among English-speaking evangelicals. Such an embrace of his thought by those of disparate ecclesiological traditions, however, would come as quite a surprise to Kuyper himself. While outside of the Netherlands Kuyper is known for his notions of Christian cultural responsibility and transformation, for the Dutch his ecclesiology stands as his most important legacy. Indeed, one cannot easily extricate Kuyper’s work of church reform from his public theology, for the latter emerged from the former at key points in his career. If this is the case, that Kuyper the churchman cannot be separated from Kuyper the cultural transformationist, it leads one to wonder if Kuyper is as helpful to evangelicals outside the Reformed tradition as initially thought. This is especially so for credobaptists, whose ecclesiological differences with the Reformed tradition could not be starker, especially regarding infant baptism and a believers-only church. Upon closer inspection of Kuyper’s ecclesiology as it developed across his career, however, his thought appears surprisingly friendly to those of Baptist convictions. This essay contends that Kuyper’s developing ecclesiology, formulated in response to various ecclesiastical and political debates, bears a certain arc, the trajectory of which serves to situate him in territory which Baptists could find quite amiable to their own ecclesiology. Three phases from Kuyper’s career are examined, with an eye towards his work of reform to see churches freed from state control and composed of believers only. This trajectory maps well onto Baptist hallmarks of soul competency and regenerate church membership, leading to the conclusion that a Kuyperian inheritance for Baptist public theology need not set aside questions of the nature of the church and its relation to society. Baptists may find in Abraham Kuyper an unexpectedly friendly resource.\n\nDutch theologian, journalist, and statesman Abraham Kuyper is commonly cited as an authoritative figure with regard to Christianity and politics. His example as a theologically sophisticated and politically active Christian is widely lauded and celebrated. However, his thought and impact have been rarely considered from the perspective of political theory, and his contribution to the field has largely been overlooked. There are notable exceptions to this, and some of these will be cited in this paper. None the less, due to this lack of theoretical clarity in political studies on Kuyper himself, this paper aims to provide a clearer vision of the theoretical basis of Kuyper's political thought. It will be shown that his political thought can be located in the broad streams of pluralism and Calvinism. We will first survey pluralist political thought, and then survey Calvinist political thought, focusing on John Calvin and Johannes Althusius. These surveys will lead to Dutch Calvinism and Abraham Kuyper's doctrine of sphere sovereignty. This core Kuyperian doctrine will be expounded, and will be shown to be an expression of Calvinist pluralism, thereby locating Abraham Kuyper's political theory within that stream.\n\nPublic theology is a relatively new theological field, but its themes and concerns are as old as the interaction between the Christian community and society. Different ages prompted different emphasis and approaches. This by far is not a way of pretending that public theology always existed in some form. This article is a biographical and historical investigation in tune with the defining features and interests of public theology and public theologians. The selection of the figures discussed here-without accounting for a complete history-aims to reflect the theoretical, practical, contextual and ecumenical aspects of public theology. The historical approach is one of the three directions or types of public theology, according to Harold Breitenberg 1. In following this approach, theological researcher would look for \"some key theologians and theological discourses and their contributions to the formation of public theology\" (Kim, 2017: 40). Such a task is not concerned only with legitimizing a relatively new theological field, but also with exploring themes, conceptions, actions, models, methods, seminal reflections that predate the emerging of public theology as academic discipline. For the purposes of this article, we will draw on previous undertakes such as Kim's chapter (2017: 40-66) in A Companion to Public Theology, a historical excursus of Duncan B. Forrester (2004: 5-19) or the six stories about the origins and development of public theology as told by Dirk J. Smit (2013: 11-22). In defining the meaning of public theology that will be taken into account for this paper, alongside with the perspective of \"critical, reflective and reasoned engagement of theology in society to bring the kingdom of God, which is for the sake of the poor and marginalized\""
