        "text": "Career\n\nKuyper served as a pastor at Beesd in Gelderland, in Utrecht, and later in Amsterdam. He first entered politics as a member of the lower chamber (1874-1877). After breaking with the national church and forming the Free Reformed Church in 1886, he returned to the lower house in 1894. He united the Calvinist and Catholic parties and in 1901 formed a reformist Christian Conservative ministry, serving as minister of the interior until 1905 and minister of state in 1907. He served in the upper house from 1913 to 1920. Kuyper's influence has been enormous. He was a brilliant orator and journalist. He was editor-in-chief of De Standaard from 1872 to 1919, and editor-in-chief of De Heraut from 1877 to 1920. Kuyper was a founder of the Free University (Calvinist) at Amsterdam and an important leader of the Antirevolutionary State Party, a political organization. His Stone Lectures at Princeton University in 1898 developed a scientific conception of Calvinism, based on a recognition of the unlimited sovereignty of God and on the cosmological influence of this doctrine, not only on the foundations of family and church, but also on the structure of the state and society. Among his important publications are The Encyclopedia of Theology; The Work of the Holy Spirit; and the political Our Program and Antirevolutionary Statesmanship. Kuyper died at The Hague on November 8, 1920.\n\nReligion\n\nAround 1866, Kuyper began to sympathise with the orthodox tendency within the Dutch Reformed Church. He was inspired by the robust reformed faith of Pietje Balthus, a single woman in her early 30s, the daughter of a miller. He began to oppose the centralization in the church, the role of the King and began to plead for the separation of church and state. In 1867, Kuyper was asked to become minister for the parish in Utrecht and he left Beesd. With his ideals he defended the interests of a group of middle class orthodox reformed, who were often referred to as \"the little people\". He formulated the principle of antithesis: a divide between secular and religious politics. Liberals and socialists, who were opposed to mixing religion and politics were his natural opponents. Catholics were a natural ally, for not only did they want to practice religiously inspired politics, but they also were no electoral opponent, because they appealed to different religious groups. Socialists, who preached class conflict were a danger to the reformed workers. He called for workers to accept their fates and be happy with a simple life, because the afterlife would be much more satisfying and revolution would only lead to instability. At the same time he argued that the system of unrestricted free enterprise was in need of \"architectonic critique\" and he urged government to adopt labour legislation and to inspect workplaces."
