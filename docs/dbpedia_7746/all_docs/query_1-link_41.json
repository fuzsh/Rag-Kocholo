        "text": "Co-sponsored by Liberty Fund, Inc., this program is an intellectually demanding and stimulating weekend colloquium that explores the foundations of liberty in a mixture of graduate-level text-based, guided Socratic discussion and lecture sessions.\n\nThis seminar explores the work of Protestant religious and social leader Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) while considering significant Roman Catholic and other philosophical perspectives. It will compare the different, conflicted, and complementary perspectives for evaluating the possibilities and challenges for economic life together and for social supports for a pluralistic society. To date Kuypers writing on these topics—as a pastor, theologian, educator, journalist, and political leader—have been largely inaccessible to the Anglophone world. Kuypers writings about business, economics, and the social question are also dispersed across his many essays, speeches, and other reflections and were previously only available in the Dutch language.\n\nThis colloquium will consist of 6 guided Socratic discussion sessions.\n\nThe discussion sessions are text-based and so selected participants are required to prepare appropriately and participate fully in all sessions.\n\nReadings will be provided to all accepted participants.\n\nThis colloquium is for Acton alumni who are junior scholars, professionals, and graduate students likely to assume leadership roles in academia and business, think-tanks, seminaries, or media.\n\nApplication Information"
