Het neocalvinisme langs de fundamentalistische meetlat.\" NTT Journal for Theology and the Study of Religion 69, no. 3 (July 18, 2015): 190–210. http://dx.doi.org/10.5117/ntt2015.69.190.krij.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article aims to assess whether Dutch theologian Abraham Kuyper (1837‐1920) and his adaptation of Calvinism into a systematic theological, political and social ideology, known as ‘neo-Calvinism’, can be rightfully associated with ‘fundamentalism’. First, the article outlines the constitutive elements of neo-Calvinism: the concepts of antithesis, presumptive regeneration, sphere sovereignty, common grace, ecclesial multiformity, and organic Scriptural inspiration, the differentiation between the church as organism and as institute, the erasure of a theocratic fragment in the Belgic Confession, and the idea that Calvinism is the ‘core element’ of the Dutch national character. Second, it applies recent literature on fundamentalism to neo-Calvinism and the development of the neo-Calvinist movement. Although, as this article concludes, the neo-Calvinist movement did have some ‘fundamentalist’ features, neo-Calvinism in itself did not inevitably lead to what Jan Buskes has called ‘the triumph of fundamentalism’ at the synod of the Reformed Churches in Assen in 1926.\n\nBennett-Hunter, Guy. \"Mondrian and Neo-Calvinism.\" Expository Times 131, no. 1 (August 22, 2019): 20–23. http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0014524619863981.\n\nFull text\n\nOng, Andrew. \"Neo-Calvinism and Ethnic Churches in Multiethnic Contexts.\" Journal of Reformed Theology 12, no. 3 (October 17, 2018): 296–320. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15697312-01203001.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract Despite neo-Calvinism’s thorny historic relationship with apartheid, this article retrieves from neo-Calvinism to contribute to the contemporary evangelical conversation about ethnic and multiethnic churches. Scholars of various disciplines have commonly accepted a link between neo-Calvinism and South Africa’s apartheid. Meanwhile, neo-Calvinists labor to sever this link, wishing to disentangle their tradition from apartheid’s evils, such as the enforcement of racially segregated churches. In reaction to the evils of such segregation, many contemporary Evangelicals have advocated for multiethnic churches that demographically reflect their ethnically diverse communities on the basis of Christian unity. This has implicitly and explicitly challenged the legitimacy of ethnic churches. This article contends that despite the link between neo-Calvinism and apartheid, and despite neo-Calvinist efforts to sever this link, neo-Calvinism offers good biblical and theological support for the establishment of ethnic churches in multiethnic contexts without at all denigrating multiethnic churches or falling into the evils of apartheid.\n\nHarinck, George. \"“Wipe Out Lines of Division (Not Distinctions)”.\" Journal of Reformed Theology 11, no. 1-2 (2017): 81–98. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15697312-01101025.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nRace was not a dominant factor in neo-Calvinism. Rather, stress was laid on the universal character of Christianity, especially in the case of Herman Bavinck. While some of the South African PhD students at the Vrije Universiteit’s defended apartheid with reference to neo-Calvinism, it was B.B. Keet—who would become a noted critic of apartheid—who adopted Bavinck’s views. As a professor in Stellenbosch, Keet initially accepted apartheid for cultural and practical reasons, but he became critical when South Africa officially implemented apartheid policy in 1948. This resulted in his book Whither, South Africa?, in which he rejected the theological arguments undergirding apartheid with arguments almost literally derived from Bavinck. It is clear from this case study that neo-Calvinism was employed not only to support apartheid, but also to criticize it as well. In the Netherlands his stand was recognized and shared by two more of Bavinck’s students: J.J. Buskes and J.H. Bavinck. Keet met with opposition within his own circles but stuck to his position and inspired his student, the apartheid critic C.F. Beyers Naudé.\n\nSutanto, Nathaniel Gray. \"Neo-Calvinism on General Revelation: A Dogmatic Sketch.\" International Journal of Systematic Theology 20, no. 4 (October 2018): 495–516. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijst.12333.\n\nFull text\n\nToit, André Du. \"Puritans in Africa? Afrikaner “Calvinism” and Kuyperian Neo-Calvinism in Late Nineteenth-Century South Africa.\" Comparative Studies in Society and History 27, no. 2 (April 1985): 209–40. http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0010417500011336.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAccounts of South African history and politics have been much influenced by what might be termed the Calvinist paradigm of Afrikaner history. As a model for the historical understanding of modern Afrikaner nationalism and of the ideology of apartheid it has proved persuasive to historians and social scientists alike. In outline, it amounts to the view that the “seventeenth-century Calvinism” which the Afrikaner founding fathers derived from their countries of origin became fixed in the isolated frontier conditions of trekboer society and survived for generations in the form of a kind of “primitive Calvinism”; that in the first part of the nineteenth century, this gave rise to a nascent chosen people ideology among early Afrikaners, which provided much of the motivation for, as well as the self-understanding of, that central event in Afrikaner history, the Great Trek, while simultaneously serving to legitimate the conquest and subordination of indigenous peoples; and that, mediated in this way, an authentic tradition of Afrikaner Calvinism thus constitutes the root source of modern Afrikaner nationalism and the ideology of apartheid. In fact, very little of this purported historical explanation will stand up to rigorous critical scrutiny: in vain will one look for hard evidence, either in the primary sources of early Afrikaner political thinking or in the contemporary secondary literature, of a set of popular beliefs that might be recognised as “primitive Calvinism” or as an ideology of a chosen people with a national mission.\n\nZafirovski, Milan. \"The Point of Origin before Destination.\" Comparative Sociology 15, no. 3 (May 28, 2016): 372–411. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15691330-12341393.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe paper seeks to help correct a certain imbalance in the sociological literature on Calvinism and its derivations like Puritanism, neo-Calvinism, etc. This is the literature’s centering on Calvinism’s various social consequences and decentering on its own origins and conditions in society. As a corrective to this asymmetry in the literature, the paper assumes and explores the societal roots and factors of the emergence and early development and expansion of Calvinism. This is done on the grounds that the analysis of the societal determination, i.e., the point of origin of Calvinism, like other religion and ideology, is equally and even more important than that of its social effects or destination. In formal terms, the paper considers Calvinism to be a dependent variable, function of certain societal determinants and settings as the explanatory factor, thus correcting the prevalent treatment of it as the independent variable in the sociological literature. In so doing it adopts and applies the main premises and findings of the sociology of religion and knowledge to Calvinism. Its aim is to contribute to a more complete sociology of the Calvinist religion that explores both its social conditions and its social consequences.\n\nПопов, Володимир. \"THE DOCTRINE OF «CHRISTIAN WORLDVIEW» IN MODERN NEO-CALVINISM.\" Doxa, no. 1(29) (June 15, 2018): 59–67. http://dx.doi.org/10.18524/2410-2601.2018.1(29).146518.\n\nFull text\n\nFlipse, Abraham C. \"The Origins of Creationism in the Netherlands: The Evolution Debate among Twentieth-Century Dutch Neo-Calvinists.\" Church History 81, no. 1 (March 2012): 104–47. http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s000964071100179x.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Netherlands is, besides the United States, one of the few countries where debates about creationism have been raging for decades. Strict creationism has become deeply rooted in traditional Reformed (Calvinist) circles, which is all the more remarkable as it stemmed from a very different culture and theological tradition. This essay analyses the historical implantation of this foreign element in Dutch soil by investigating the long-term interaction between American creationism and Dutch “neo-Calvinism,” a movement emerging in the late nineteenth century, which attempted to bring classical Calvinism into rapport with modern times. The heated debates about evolution in the interbellum period as well as in the sixties—periods characterized by a cultural reorientation of the Dutch Calvinists—turn out to have played a crucial role. In the interbellum period, leading Dutch theologians—fiercely challenged by Calvinist scientists—imported US “flood geology” in an attempt to stem the process of modernisation in the Calvinist subculture. In the sixties many Calvinists abandoned their resistance to evolutionary theory, but creationism continued to play a prominent role as the neo-Calvinist tradition was upheld by an orthodox minority, who (re-)embraced the reviving “Genesis Flood” creationism. The appropriation of American creationism was eased by the earlier Calvinist-creationist connection, but also by “inventing” a Calvinist-creationist tradition, suggesting continuity with the ideas of the founding fathers of neo-Calvinism. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of what Ronald L. Numbers has recently called the “globalization” of the “science-and-religion dialogue.”\n\nSpohnholz, Jesse, and Mirjam G.

But there are too many problems in the evidentiary basis to sustain this conclusion. This essay traces the historiography on the Dutch Reformation in order to isolate where and why this idea emerged. It demonstrates that no specific role for religious refugees in the development of Dutch Calvinism can be found in historical writing from the late sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. Only in the late nineteenth century, during a debate about the role of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Netherlands, did the experiences of religious refugees come to take on a specific role in explaining the development of Dutch Calvinism. The idea first emerged among Neo-Calvinists who critiqued state supervision of their church. By the twentieth century, it came to be used by orthodox and moderate Reformed Protestants, as well as liberal and secular academic historians. This paper thus demonstrates that this key interpretive framework for understanding the Dutch Reformation was the product not of developments in the sixteenth-century Habsburg Netherlands, but of religious politics in the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the late nineteenth century.\n\nAalders, Maarten J. \"Een kennismaking met Jenő Sebestyén (1884-1950).\" DNK : Documentatieblad voor de Nederlandse kerkgeschiedenis na 1800 42, no. 91 (December 1, 2019): 163–80. http://dx.doi.org/10.5117/dnk2019.91.003.aald.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstract During the interwar period, the Hungarian theological professor Jenő Sebestyén was a well-known figure in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. He regularly visited the Netherlands and gave lots of lectures to raise money for charity work in Hungary. In 1930 the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam awarded him an honorary doctorate. After his death an In Memoriam appeared in Trouw on 8 June 1950, and on 12 April 1952 George Puchinger dedicated the issue of his magazine Polemios to this Hungarian neo-Calvinist. In the Netherlands there is little attention for him anymore. In this article I deal with three questions: how did Sebestyén come to study neo-Calvinism, what activities did he develop in that context, and what was the result of his efforts?\n\nTong, David. \"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND SCIENCE: A BRIEF HISTORICAL STUDY ON DARWINISM AND THE DUTCH NEO-CALVINIST THEOLOGIANS.\" VERBUM CHRISTI: JURNAL TEOLOGI REFORMED INJILI 1, no. 2 (September 6, 2017): 134–73. http://dx.doi.org/10.51688/vc1.2.2014.art4.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe philosopher Ilse N. Bulhof's conclusion that the reception of Darwinism in the Netherlands was easy with opposition coming only from the religious quarters needs to be explained further. The fact is, opposition towards Darwinism came also from the academics and not all religious groups opposed it. The modern liberal accepted Darwinism without much reservation. Two great figures of the Dutch neo-Calvinisme, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, accepted evolution as a fact while rejecting Darwinism. Bulfhof's conclusion above should not be understood as a conflict between faith and science. The real conflict is not between faith and science, but between two diametrically opposing worldviews. This is the reason why not all scientists embraced Darwinism. It is interesting to observe that the second generation of the Dutch neo- Calvinsm (Valentine Hepp, for example) resisted all forms of evolution theories. Several possible reasons explaining the discontinuity between these two generations of neo-Calvinism will also be given in this paper.?\n\nBROCK, CORY C. \"Bavinck as Public Theologian: Philosophy, Ethics, and Politics.\" Unio Cum Christo 6, no. 2 (October 1, 2020): 115. http://dx.doi.org/10.35285/ucc6.2.2020.art6.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAs a result of the Enlightenment, the privatization of religion, and the dissociation of theology and the university, public theology has become a very pertinent topic. While public theology emerged as a discipline in the 1980s, the neo-Calvinist tradition, led by Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, was engaged in public-theological reasoning long before. Although not using the expression public theology, Bavinck offers a public theology in multiple ways. For him, it is a theology for and of the church. His main contribution, however, lies in his philosophical works, where he brings theo-logic to bear on the questions facing the various publics. Addressing current events, he sought to give answers founded on the Triune God. His essay “Ethics and Politics,” written during the Great War, is a primary example.

It is anecumenical volume in that it begins with the Catholic Church then considersseveraJ forms of Protestantism, then goes on to discus Judaism, and finallyconsiders Islam. It should be clear that the volume is predominantly \"Christian,\"but the effort to include the other monotheistic religions is very welcome.One difficulty in reviewing this volume is that many of the papers areinformative but not representative of the religious traditions they represent.Thus A. M. C. Waterman's piece describes a particular phase of Anglicansocial thought, and the same is true of the one by Paul Heyne. Perhaps anoverview is po ible only for those movements which are no longer active,a in Ronald Preston's fine contribution on Christian Socialism in Britain.I must confess some surprise on finding the vigor with which any perceiveddefect of the market was defended.For Muslims, some of the most interesting points about this volume areto be found in the instances of active politicians who took strong religiousstands. Abraham Kuyper's vision of neo-Calvinism is the outstanding examplein the paper by Bob Goudzwaard, but Waterman's presentation of PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher's views are equally revealing. Of less practicalimport, but nonetheles equally intriguing, is the account by John Yoder ofthe \"First Reformation\" in Czechoslovakia as well as the reasons for the neglectof this movement-lack of political support, linguistic distance from We ternEurope, and an ab ence of shared doctrinal formulations.The description of Judaism and the Market Mechanism by Meir Tamariprovides many parallels with Islamic market supervi ion, and there is even ...\n\nCutter, Elissa. \"Neo-Calvinism and the French Revolution , James Eglinton and George Harinck (eds.), Bloomsbury T&T Clark, 2014 (ISBN 978-0-567-65663-6), xii + 210 pp., hb £65.\" Reviews in Religion & Theology 23, no. 4 (October 2016): 480–83. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rirt.12750.\n\nFull text\n\nEwals, Leo. \"Ary Scheffer, een Nederlandse Fransman.\" Oud Holland - Quarterly for Dutch Art History 99, no. 4 (1985): 271–90. http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/187501785x00134.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nAbstractAry Scheffer (1795-1858) is so generally included in the French School (Note 2)- unsurprisingly, since his career was confined almost entirely to Paris - that the fact that he was born and partly trained in the Netherlands is often overlooked. Yet throughout his life he kept in touch with Dutch colleagues and drew part of his inspiration from Dutch traditions. These Dutch aspects are the subject of this article. The Amsterdam City Academy, 1806-9 Ary Scheffer was enrolled at the Amsterdam Academy on 25 October 1806, his parents falsifying his date of birth in order to get him admitted at the age of eleven (fifteen was the oficial age) . He started in the third class and in order to qualify for the second he had to be one of the winners in the prize drawing contest. Candidates in this were required to submit six drawings made during the months January to March. Although no-one was supposed to enter until he had been at the Academy for four years, Ary Scheffer competed in both 1808 and 1809. Some of his signed drawings are preserved in Dordrecht. (Figs. 1-5 and 7), along with others not made for the contest. These last in particular are interesting not only because they reveal his first prowess, but also because they give some idea of the Academy practice of his day. Although the training at the Academy broadly followed the same lines as that customary in France, Italy and elsewhere (Note 4), our knowledge of its precise content is very patchy, since there was no set curriculum and no separate teachers for each subject. Two of Scheffer's drawings (Figs. 2 and 3) contain extensive notes, which amount to a more or less complete doctrine of proportion. It is not known who his teacher was or what sources were used, but the proportions do not agree with those in Van der Passe's handbook, which came into vogue in the 18th century, or with those of the canon of a Leonardo, DÃ¼rer or Lebrun. One gets the impression that what are given here are the exact measurements of a concrete example. Scheffer's drawings show him gradually mastering the rudiments of art. In earlier examples the hatching is sometimes too hasty (Fig. 4) or too rigidly parallel (Fig.5), while his knowledge of anatomy is still inadequate and his observation not careful enough. But right from the start he shows flair and as early as 1807 he made a clever drawing of a relatively complex group (Fig. 6) , while the difficult figure of Marsyas was already well captured in 1808 and clearly evinces his growing knowledge o f anatomy, proportion , foreshortening and the effects of light (Fig. 7). The same development can be observed in his portrait drawings. That of Gerardus Vrolik (1775-1859, Fig.8), a professor at the Atheneum Illustre (the future university) and Scheffer' s teacher, with whom he always kept in touch (Note 6), is still not entirely convincing, but a portrait of 1809, thought to be of his mother (Fig.9, Note 7), shows him working much more systematically. It is not known when he left the Academy, but from the summer of 1809 we find him in France, where he was to live with only a few breaks from 1811 to his death. The first paintings and the Amsterdam exhibitions of 1808 and 1810 Ary Scheffer's earliest known history painting, Hannibal Swearing to Avenge his Brother Hasdrubal's Death (Fig. 10) Notes 8-10) was shown at the first exhibition of living masters in Amsterdam in 1808. Although there was every reason for giving this subject a Neo-Classical treatment, the chiaroscuro, earthy colours and free brushwork show Scheffer opting for the old Dutch tradition rather than the modern French style. This was doubtless on the prompting of his parents,for a comment in a letter from his mother in 1810 (Note 12) indicates that she shared the reservations of the Dutch in general about French Neo-Classicism. (Note 11). As the work of a twelve to thirteen year old, the painting naturally leaves something to be desired: the composition is too crowded and unbalanced and the anatomy of the secondary figures rudimentary. In a watercolour Scheffer made of the same subject, probably in the 1820's, he introduced much more space between the figures (Fig. 11, Note 13). Two portraits are known from this early period. The first, of Johanna Maria Verbeek (Fig. 12, Note 14), was done when the two youngsters were aged twelve. It again shows all the characteristics of an early work, being schematic in its simplicity, with some rather awkward details and inadequate plasticity. On the other hand the hair and earrings are fluently rendered, the colours harmonious and the picture has an undeniable charm. At the second exhibition of works by living masters in 1810, Ary Scheffer showed a 'portrait of a painter' (Fig. 13), who was undoubtedly his uncle Arnoldus Lamme, who also had work in the exhibition as did Scheffer's recently deceased father Johan-Bernard and his mother Cornelia Scheffer-Lamme, an indication of the stimulating surroundings in which he grew up. The work attracted general attention (Note 16) and it does, indeed, show a remarkable amount of progress, the plasticity, effects of light, brushwork and colour all revealing skill and care in their execution. The simple, bourgeois character of the portrait not only fits in with the Dutch tradition which Scheffer had learned from both his parents in Amsterdam, but also has points in common with the recent developments in France, which he could have got to know during his spell in Lille from autumn 1809 onwards. A Dutchman in Paris Empire and Restoration, 1811-30 In Amsterdam Scheffer had also been laught by his mother, a miniature painter, and his father, a portrait and history painter (Note 17). After his father's death in June 1809, his mother, who not only had a great influence on his artistic career, but also gave his Calvinism and a great love of literature (Note 18), wanted him to finish his training in Paris. After getting the promise of a royal grant from Louis Napoleon for this (Note 19) and while waiting for it to materialize, she sent the boy to Lille to perfect his French as well as further his artistic training. In 1811 Scheffer settled in Paris without a royal grant or any hope of one. He may possibly have studied for a short time under Prudhon (Note 20) , but in the autumn of 1811 he was officially contracted as a pupil of GuÃ©rin, one of the leading artists of the school of David, under whom he mastered the formulas of NeD-Classicism, witness his Orpheus and Eurydice (FÃ¯g.14), shown in the Salon of 1814. During his first ten years in Paris Scheffer also painted many genre pieces in order, so he said, to earn a living for himself and his mother. GuÃ©rin's prophecy that he would make a great career as a history painter (Note 21) soon came true, but not in the way GuÃ©rin thought it would, Scheffer participating in the revolution initiated by his friends and fellow-pupils, GÃ©ricault and Delacroix, which resulted in the rise of the Romantic Movement. It was not very difficult for him to break with Neo-Classicism, for with his Dutch background he felt no great affinity with it (Note 22). This development is ilustrated by his Gaston de Foix Dying on the Battlefield After his Victory at Ravenna, shown at the Salon of 1824, and The Women of Souli Throwing Themselves into the Abyss (Fig.15), shown at that of 1827-8. The last years of the Restoration and the July Monarchy. Influence of Rembrandt and the Dutch masters In 1829, when he seemed to have become completely assimilated in France and had won wide renown, Scheffer took the remarkable step of returning to the Netherlands to study the methods of Rembrandt and other Dutch old masters (Note 23) . A new orientation in his work is already apparent in the Women of Souli, which is more harmonious and considered in colour than the Gaston dc Foix (Note 24). This is linked on the one hand to developments in France, where numbers of young painters had abandoned extreme Romanticism to find the 'juste milieu', and on the other to Scheffer's Dutch background. Dutch critics were just as wary of French Romanticism as they had been of Neo-Classicism, urging their own painters to revive the traditions of the Golden Age and praising the French painters of the 'juste milieu'. It is notable how many critics commented on the influence of Rembrandt on Scheffer's works, e.g. his Faust, MarguÃ©rite, TempÃªte and portrait of Talleyrand at the Salon of 1851 (Note 26). The last two of these date from 1828 and show that the reorientation and the interest in Rembrandt predate and were the reasons for the return to the Netherlands in 1829. In 1834 Gustave Planche called Le Larmoyeur (Fig. 16) a pastiche of Rembrandt and A. Barbier made a comparable comment on Le Roi de Thule in 1839 (Note 27). However, as Paul Mantz already noted in 1850 (Note 28), Scheffer certainly did not fully adopt Rembrandt's relief and mystic light. His approach was rather an eclectic one and he also often imbued his work with a characteristically 19th-century melancholy. He himself wrote after another visit to the Netherlands in 1849 that he felt he had touched a chord which others had not attempted (Note 29) . Contacts with Dutch artists and writers Scheffer's links with the Netherlands come out equally or even more strongly in the many contacts he maintained there. As early as 1811-12 Sminck-Pitloo visited him on his way to Rome (Note 30), to be followed in the 1820's by J.C. Schotel (Note 31), while after 1830 as his fame increased, so the contacts also became more numerous. He was sought after by and corresponded with various art dealers (Note 33) and also a large number of Dutch painters, who visited him in Paris or came to study under him (Note 32) Numerous poems were published on paintings by him from 1838 onwards, while Jan Wap and Alexander Ver Huell wrote at length about their visits to him (Note 34) and a 'Scheffer Album' was compiled in 1859. Thus he clearly played a significant role in the artistic life of the Netherlands. International orientation As the son of a Dutch mother and a German father, Scheffer had an international orientation right from the start. Contemporary critics and later writers have pointed out the influences from English portrait painting and German religious painting detectable in his work (Note 35). Extracts from various unpublished letters quoted here reveal how acutely aware he was of what was likely to go down well not only in the Netherlands, but also in a country like England, where he enjoyed great fame (Notes 36-9) . July Monarchy and Second Empire. The last decades While most French artists of his generation seemed to have found their definitive style under the July Monarchy, Scheffer continued to search for new forms of expression. In the 1830's, at the same time as he painted his Rembrandtesque works, he also produced his famous Francesca da Rimini (Fig. 17), which is closer to the 'juste milieu' in its dark colours and linear accents. In the 1840's he used a simple and mainly bright palette without any picturesque effects, e.g. in his SS. Augustine and Monica and The Sorrows of the Earth (Note 41), but even this was not his last word. In an incident that must have occurred around 1857 he cried out on coming across some of his earlier works that he had made a mistake since then and wasted his time (Note 42) and in his Calvin of 1858 (Fig. 18) he resumed his former soft chiaroscuro and warm tones. It is characteristic of him that in that same year he painted a last version of The Sorrows of the Earth in the light palette of the 1840's. Despite the difficulty involved in the precise assessment of influences on a painter with such a complex background, it is clear that even in his later period, when his work scored its greatest successes in France, England and Germany, Scheffer always had a strong bond with the Netherlands and that he not only contributed to the artistic life there, but always retained a feeling for the traditions of his first fatherland. Appendix An appendix is devoted to a study of the head of an old man in Dordrecht, which is catalogued as a copy of a 17th-century painting in the style of Rembrandt done by Ary Scheffer at the age of twelve (Fig.19, Note 43). This cannot be correct, as it is much better than the other works by the twelve-year-old painter. Moreover, no mention is made of it in the catalogue of the retrospective exhibition held in Paris in 1859, where the Hannibal is given as his earliest work (Note 44). It was clearly unknown then, as it is not mentioned in any of the obituaries of 1858 and 1859 either. The earliest reference to it occurs in the list made bv Scheffer's daughter in 1897 of the works she was to bequeath to the Dordrecht museum. A clue to its identification may be a closely similar drawing by Cornelia Scheffer-Lamme (Fig. 20, Note 46), which is probably a copy after the head of the old man. She is known to have made copies after contemporary and 17th-century masters. The portrait might thus be attributable to Johan-Bernard Scheffer, for his wife often made copies of his works and he is known from sale catalogues to have painted various portraits of old men (Note 47, cf. Fig.21). Ary Scheffer also knew this. In 1839 his uncle Arnoldus Lamme wrote to him that he would look out for such a work at a sale (Note 48). It may be that he succeeded in finding one and that this portrait came into the possession of the Scheffer family in that way, but Johan-Bernard's work is too little known for us to be certain about this.\n\nKooi, Cornelis. \"The Relevance of Neo-Calvinism for Church and Theology.\" European Journal of Theology 30, no. 2 (September 1, 2021). http://dx.doi.org/10.5117/ejt2021.2.004.kooi.\n\nFull text\n\nAbstract:\n\nSummary Neo-Calvinism is increasingly popular in the United States, but far less so in the Netherlands where it originated. Written from the context of the Free University (Vrije Universiteit) founded by Abraham Kuyper, this article presents six elements of Neo-Calvinism which together establish it as an important and relevant worldview for our time. The first is that it attempts to create a ‘priestly’ connection between gospel and culture. Next there are Neo-Calvinism’s notion of the sovereignty of God, its conviction that humans are elected to something, and its belief that this world – even in its fallen state – is and remains God’s world. The last two elements are the trinitarian spread of its theology and the fact that it exercises the Christian virtues of faith, hope and love.\n\nColetto, R. \"Traces of neo-Calvinism in France and Italy.\" Koers - Bulletin for Christian Scholarship 75, no. 1 (July 26, 2010). http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koers.v75i1.77.\n\nFull text\n\nGray Sutanto, Nathaniel. \"Neo-Calvinism and the French Revolution.
