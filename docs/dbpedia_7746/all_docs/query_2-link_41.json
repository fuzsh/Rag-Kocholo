        "text": "Bavinck: A Critical Biography, James Eglinton. Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2020. Hardcover, 450 pages.\n\nIn my corner of the Reformed world, figures in church history are often categorized as heroes or villains. If you’re either one, you stand a chance of being remembered. For example, Abraham Kuyper is considered a villain because of the way his views were imposed on the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, especially in the 1940s. Klaas Schilder is a hero because of the way he resisted the imposition of Kuyper’s views. But if you can’t be neatly categorized, even if you’ve made important contributions, more than likely your name and however God may have used you will be forgotten.\n\nI’m afraid that’s been the case with Herman Bavinck (1854-1921). I had a look through my childhood church history textbook, Young People’s History of the Church by W. Meijer (published in Launceston!). Figures like Schilder and Kuyper dominate. But Bavinck isn’t mentioned at all, not even once. P.K. Keizer’s Church History, a textbook for high schools and colleges, doesn’t fare much better. Bavinck is mentioned once, just in passing. I first discovered Herman Bavinck in university by reading Cornelius Van Til, the pioneer of Reformed apologetics. Van Til claimed he wasn’t being all that innovative, just building on what others had done before, and especially Bavinck.\n\nWho was Herman Bavinck? Without spoiling the book, he was a highly-respected Dutch theologian. After a short pastorate, he first taught at the seminary of the churches established out of the Secession of 1834. Bavinck was instrumental in discussions leading up to the Union of 1892, when the churches of the Secession merged with the churches of the Doleantie of 1886. In 1902 he accepted a position to teach theology at the Free University of Amsterdam. He was also actively involved in politics, being elected as a senator to the Dutch parliament in 1911. He wrote dozens of articles and books, the most notable being his four-volume Reformed Dogmatics (which has been translated into English).\n\nI’m hopeful that this new biography by James Eglinton will spark renewed interest in this influential figure from our Reformed church history. While it’s scholarly and careful, it’s also exceptionally readable. A few years ago, James Bratt published a biography of Abraham Kuyper (Abraham Kuyper: Modern Calvinist, Christian Democrat — reviewed here). This too was a scholarly biography, but it suffered from assuming too much about the reader’s prior knowledge of Kuyper’s context. Eglinton, on the other hand, explains everything well for the reader new to Bavinck. Eglinton has helpful features, including a map, chronology, and a list of key figures, churches, educational institutions and newspapers.\n\nThis isn’t the first Bavinck biography to appear in English. In 2010 we saw Ron Gleason’s Herman Bavinck: Pastor, Churchman, Statesman and Theologian (my review is here). Eglinton’s biography is different in that it claims to be a critical approach to Bavinck – “critical” in the sense of being analytical. Eglinton presents Bavinck as a theologically orthodox believer trying to come to terms with the modern world, a world which began to change radically after 1848. The author doesn’t shy away from some of the weaknesses, inconsistences, or doubts of his subject. Eglinton also corrects some of the inaccuracies of previous biographers, not only Gleason, but also Dutch biographers such as R.H. Bremmer. Eglinton does this by going back to the original sources, especially Bavinck’s journals and letters.\n\nAs a result of this original research, some new details of Bavinck’s life have emerged. For example, Eglinton reveals the tragic obsession the young Bavinck had with Amelia den Dekker. His journals tell the story of his apparently unrequited love for Amelia and how she broke his heart. These sorts of details fill in more of the human side of Herman Bavinck.\n\nIt also becomes clear how Bavinck isn’t easily boxed. He was a “son of the Secession,” but chose to study at the University of Leiden, a hotbed of theological liberalism. Bavinck was always confessionally Reformed, yet one of his closest friends was an atheist. He was a friend and colleague of Abraham Kuyper, yet was publicly and privately critical of Kuyper. Bavinck edited and republished a classic Reformed theological textbook known as the Leiden Synopsis, but when he wrote his own dogmatics he wasn’t just regurgitating past formulations.\n\nReaders may also be surprised to discover that Bavinck was ahead of his time on some issues. For example, Herman Bavinck argued that there was no Scriptural basis on which women should be prevented from voting, whether in society or in the church. He wasn’t the first to make such arguments, but his voice did carry some heft in the Reformed Churches of the Netherlands. Eglinton adds some context to these views with his fascinating description of Bavinck’s wife Johanna, a woman who certainly had an independent spirit and a sharp mind of her own.\n\nScholars of Dutch Reformed church history are lauding this work and rightfully so. But I’d also highly recommend it to all pastors and church leaders, as well as teachers of church history in Christian schools. Not only is it informative, but it’s an enjoyable read. Best of all, it’ll leave you with a more nuanced view of how Christ has been working through complex people to gather, defend and preserve his church.\n\nHerman Bavinck (1854-1921) stands with John Calvin and Abraham Kuyper as one of the greatest Reformed theologians. He’s renowned for being biblical, confessional, and incisive. It’s been especially the publication of his Reformed Dogmatics in English that’s brought him to prominence in our day. Biographies by Ron Gleason and, more recently James Eglinton, have certainly helped as well. However, most of Bavinck’s corpus remains in Dutch. Eric Bristley’s Guide to the Writings of Herman Bavinck illustrates the vastness of this corpus, listing hundreds of his articles and books.\n\nI want to introduce to you one of these untranslated works, one that was controversial in its day, and still bears some relevance for today. In 1918, Bavinck published his book De vrouw in de hedendaagsche maatschaapij (Women in Contemporary Society). It’s a comprehensive look at questions Dutch society was wrestling with in the early 20th century, particularly under the influence of first-wave feminism. It deals with what Scripture teaches about women and how biblical teaching applies today, but also surveys church history – Bavinck’s typical approach. In what follows, I’ll summarize what he says in his chapter about women in the church. I’ll be simply reporting what he writes. In other words, this is only descriptive and not analytical/critical.\n\n“Women in the Church” is the title of chapter 10 of De vrouw in de hedendaagsche maatschaapij, the second-last chapter of the book. It begins with the pre-Reformation church, noting the role of nuns in Christian philanthropy. During the Reformation, some efforts were made to reorient this kind of diaconal service among women, but these efforts were hardly successful. In some areas, efforts were made to have deaconesses, but the Synod of Middelburg in 1581 decided that it was not advisable to reintroduce the office of deaconess in the Reformed churches of the Netherlands. In exceptional circumstances such as a time of plague, however, the work of deacons could be done by their wives or other women. According to Bavinck, this happened in places like Middelburg, Utrecht, Amsterdam, and Emden.\n\nBavinck then turns his attention to a historical overview of women as pastors/preachers. He notes that the Salvation Army was among the first to give a prominent role to women as church leaders. This was owing especially to Catherine Booth, who co-founded the Salvation Army with her husband William. Catherine Booth argued for the right for women to be preachers alongside men. Others who pioneered women’s ordination were the Quakers, Congregationalists, Universalists, Unitarians, Methodists and, in the Netherlands the Mennonites and the Remonstrants.\n\nBavinck evaluates all these developments as being unbiblical. He notes that Christ entrusted the ministry of the word to men, first to the apostles, and then to pastors and teachers. The apostolic church never had any official ministry of the word and sacrament by women, nor any government of the church by women. The apostle Paul said that women are to be silent in the congregation because to do otherwise would violate the natural order grounded in creation.\n\nBavinck has a more positive evaluation of women serving in a general diaconal role. In fact he says, the church “cannot do without women in this work.” This includes things like Sunday school, care for the poor and the sick, care for the elderly, the support of pregnant women, and more. He doesn’t think these activities need to be directly under the oversight of the church as an institution, but the church does have the calling to promote this kind of work where women use their gifts.\n\nThat leads into a discussion of the active role that women can play in missions. He notes some figures for women serving on the mission field. According to his figures, 160 women from America were serving as missionary doctors, and 2458 as “sisters in the mission” (zendingszusters). Canada had 23 and 220, while Australia and New Zealand 2 and 94. He also draws attention to the role that “missionary women’s associations” play on the home front, promoting and supporting the work of missions around the world. Bavinck presents all of this in a positive light.\n\nFinally Bavinck comes to the controversial topic of women voting for office bearers in the church. He begins this discussion with an overview of where things stand: he notes that there are many churches in America, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland where women vote. He points out that it was discussed and defended in the Netherlands as early as 1898 by Abraham Kuyper, as well as by pastors A.D.C Kok and C. Lindeboom.\n\nBavinck notes that the issue did not seem to be a pressing one in the Netherlands of his day. Unlike in other countries, men were actively involved in Dutch church life and there didn’t seem to be any desire to have women voting for office bearers. He writes that, with such indifference, it would be foolish to press the issue.\n\nHowever, he notes that if we discuss it in principle, “there is little ground to condemn it.” Bavinck argues that women are equal members of the church with men. They have just as much an interest in having good office bearers as the men do. Because of their nature as women, they tend to actually have quite a great deal of interest in religious matters. Moreover, there are large numbers of widows, women married to “religiously indifferent men,” or women married to men who belong to another church. Without being able to vote, such women are all stripped of the opportunity to have an influence on church life.\n\nBavinck strengthens his argument by noting that while women under the authority of their husbands in the home, as church members they receive the same benefits and should receive the same rights. He notes that young male communicant members who still live with their parents are subordinate to those parents, but yet they have the right to vote. This is unfair. Bavinck says the injustice becomes worse because women are allowed to raise objections to the election of an office bearer – yet they cannot vote. Then he notes that the vote in the church is not an exercise of power. The congregation only points out its preferences for office bearers; the consistory is responsible to call and appoint.\n\nHe maintains that there is only one objection with any weight: if women can vote in the church, it will not be long before the church will be forced to have women standing as candidates. In other words, women’s voting will lead to women’s ordination.\n\nBut Bavinck notes that this is an argument from fear. It is an argument that often persuades fearful minds concerned about novelties in the church. However, he points out, if the Scriptures are so strong that women may not serve as office bearers, then we have nothing to fear. The clarity of the Bible should prevent any such development.\n\nHe then points out that it’s not unusual for people to be able to vote and not be able to stand as a candidate. One does not follow from the other. The requirements for eligibility to vote are often different from the eligibility requirements to stand as a candidate. In the Dutch situation of his time, a public servant, clergyman or teacher was not allowed to be a candidate in a city council election. Writes Bavinck, “Thus eligibility to any office in Scripture is bound by certain requirements, 1 Timothy 3; but no such limits are placed on the power to vote.”\n\nFinally, Bavinck comes to a brief discussion of Scripture. In Acts 1:15, in the meeting of the 120 people to replace Judas as apostle, women were certainly there (Acts 1:14). True, Peter addresses the gathering as “Men and Brothers.” That was common practice and it still was in the church of Bavinck’s day. Even though they were present the sisters were never mentioned. It’s therefore uncertain as to whether or not the women present participated in the process. Other passages like Acts 13:3 and Acts 14:23 likewise do not shed any light. Bavinck concludes that while Scripture limits the offices of the church to men, there is no definite and clear statement about who may vote.\n\nIndeed, it seems to Bavinck, in the ancient church women were not excluded from choosing bishops or making contributions to other ecclesiastical matters. He points out that, in his day, in Germany there were Roman Catholic congregations where independent women had long been allowed to vote on the choice of a pastor. Similar situations occur in the Netherlands, he says, proving that women have not always been excluded from the voting process in the congregation just because they are women.\n\nIn his biography, Ron Gleason describes the reception of this book (pp.415-416). It was especially the matter of women voting in the church that led to some negative evaluations by men such as Dammes Fabius and Seakle Greijdanus. Gleason relates that Abraham Kuyper wrote his last letter to Bavinck about this book and indicated that the two of them had significant differences on the subject. However, a footnote surmises that these differences may have been about women’s suffrage in civil society. Given how Bavinck asserts that Kuyper defended women’s voting in the church, Gleason may be correct.\n\n(Note: I haven’t yet read James Eglinton’s biography and what he may have to offer on this – it’s on my list of must-reads for 2021.)\n\nThe following is an excerpt from chapter 17 of Aiming to Please: A Guide to Reformed Worship (available from Amazon and other retailers). The chapter begins with a consideration of the so-called Days of Commemoration (Christmas, Easter, etc.). I argue that there is liberty for Reformed churches to worship on these days.\n\n************\n\nWhat About Advent and Lent?\n\nSome churches follow not only the practice of commemorating occasions like Christmas and Easter, but also the special seasons of Advent and Lent. Advent is the four weeks leading up to December 25. Lent consists of the forty days leading up to Easter – it includes Palm Sunday, Ash Wednesday, and Maundy Thursday. This liturgical calendar (which includes far more dates and seasons) is observed in Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism, but has also made some inroads into Reformed churches as well.\n\nWe noted above that John Calvin did not practice Advent or Lent. There were services every day in Geneva and, in the week leading up to Easter, Calvin did preach on the suffering of Christ.[1] However, that is not at all the same as forty days of Lent observance or four weeks of Advent.\n\nBy the time of Abraham Kuyper, there was a diversity of practice in the Reformed Churches of the Netherlands. Kuyper noted that quite a few ministers in his time did follow the liturgical calendar, including Advent and Lent.[2] He was opposed to prescribing anything on this score, and himself expressed some reservations about it.\n\nThere are a few objections one could bring to following the liturgical calendar more broadly. To start, I appreciate what Hughes Oliphant Old wrote about this:\n\nThe recent effort to bring back the celebration of the old liturgical calendar has suspicious similarities to a revival of the nature religions, natural theology, a cyclical interpretation of life, and the resurgence of the religions of fortune and fertility. One does penance in Advent, when winter sets in, and then one rejoices at Easter, when the flowers reappear in the spring. It is all quite natural, but this fascination with liturgical seasons sometimes seems not much more than a revival of Canaanitism. The primary emphasis of any Reformed liturgical calendar should be the weekly observance of the Lord’s Day.[3]\n\nMoreover, the observance of these seasons gives the impression that we are somehow reliving all these events in redemptive history. It is as if we are spending four weeks waiting for Jesus to be born – when he was already born 2000 years ago. Or, with Lent, it seems that we are spending forty days preparing ourselves for the crucifixion on Good Friday. These events have happened and it is one thing to commemorate them, it is quite another to spend several weeks almost pretending we are waiting for them.\n\nRelated to this are the practices which usually accompany these seasons and especially Lent. I am thinking especially of the practice of fasting for Lent. This is done not only by Roman Catholics, but also by Lutherans and growing numbers of evangelical Christians. Now there is definitely much to commend fasting from a biblical perspective.[4] The problem is not with fasting as such. The problem is connecting fasting to a man-made liturgical season. Biblical fasting is voluntary and secret. Lenten fasting is sometimes mandated (as with the Roman Catholic Church) and sometimes merely encouraged. But it is always with the idea that this fasting is a preparation for observing Christ’s suffering – something he has already endured in our place. By adopting the practice of observing Lent in our churches, we could be giving the impression that the practices associated with Lent are commended for our use as well.\n\nThere is also another objection – one to which I have alluded several times already. We have agreed to go each year through the 52 Lord’s Days of the Heidelberg Catechism. As we do that, we are already covering the important events of redemptive history. If we follow the season of Advent, we spend one Sunday on Lord’s Day 14, one Christmas sermon, plus four more Advent sermons. Each year, believers in such a church would hear six sermons on Christ’s incarnation. The situation is similar with Christ’s suffering: two Lord’s Days (15 and 16) on his suffering, plus a Good Friday sermon, and then six Sundays of Lenten preaching. Is it necessary or helpful to dedicate this much of the preaching schedule to these topics? Moreover, if a preacher wishes to follow the model of serial expository preaching, these seasons of Lent and Advent are not going to allow him to make much progress through a book. After all, 10 of 52 Sundays are dealing with Christ’s incarnation and suffering.\n\nAll things considered, a good case can be made for observing the days of commemoration. But seasons of Lent and Advent are better left to the side. I will certainly respect the liberty of the church or the colleague who follows this, but it should also work the other way around. If a minister is not comfortable with the practice, no church ought to force him. When it comes to Lent and Advent, Kuyper was right: there should be no prescription. As the Belgic Confession puts it in article 32, let us be careful about having “laws introduced into the worship of God which bind and compel the consciences in any way.”\n\n[1] Elsie Anne McKee, “Reformed Worship in the Sixteenth Century,” 17-18.\n\n[2] Kuyper, Our Worship, 180.\n\n[3] Old, Worship Reformed According to Scripture, 164.\n\n[4] See my article “The Value of Fasting,” in Clarion 45.13 (June 28, 1996), 300.\n\nThis year we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of 1944. If you have no idea what that is, you’re in good company. I remember hearing about it for the first time in my Christian school and my thoughts went right away to the Canadian soldiers liberating the Netherlands during the Second World War. It’s at the same time, but this is a totally different event, something from church history.\n\nThe story begins in the early 1800s. The Reformed Church in the Netherlands was in a bad way. Scripture-denying theological liberalism was in the ascendancy. God brought about a Reformation known as the Secession of 1834. Later, in 1886, under the leadership of Abraham Kuyper and others, another Reformation happened. This was called the Doleantie, literally, “the Grieving.” In 1892, the Secession and Doleantie churches were united together in one federation. This happened through the herculean efforts of influential figures like Herman Bavinck (from the Secession churches) and Abraham Kuyper (from the Doleantie churches).\n\nUnited, but…\n\nBy 1921 both Herman Bavinck and Abraham Kuyper were gone. The Union of 1892 was something that lay almost 30 years in the past. In those thirty years, there had been tensions. It took time for Secession and Doleantie churches to learn to live with one another. That took place on a local level. Many Dutch towns and villages had both a Secession church and a Doleantie church. Now they were both in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. The old Secession church was known as the ‘A’ church, and the Doleantie church would be known as the ‘B’ church. In some places eventually they merged into one congregation, but in other places they continued their separate existence.\n\nYet deeper problems existed. The question of Abraham Kuyper’s theology continued. He had some peculiar beliefs, especially about baptism. He believed in presumptive regeneration. Kuyper argued that we baptize on the presumption that the child being baptized is born again or regenerate. If it turns out later that the child is not regenerate, then it wasn’t a real baptism. There were other doctrinal concerns as well, but it’s especially the doctrine of baptism and the covenant that becomes a matter of controversy later on.\n\nIn 1905, a Synod was held in Utrecht. This synod was asked to deal with the theology of Kuyper. It did this by means of what has come to be known as the Conclusions of Utrecht. It’s also sometimes called “the Pacification Formula” because it was meant to pacify the churches. It was meant to lay all the concerns to rest about what could and could not be taught in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. On the point of baptism, they came up with a compromise statement. It mildly rejected some of Kuyper’s formulations, while allowing for others. So Utrecht said that children “must be held to be regenerated and sanctified in Christ, until upon growing up they should manifest the contrary in their way of life or doctrine.”[1] However, Utrecht also said that it is “less correct to say that baptism is administered to the children of believers on the ground of their presumed regeneration, since the ground of baptism is found in the command and promise of God.”[2]\n\nThree Streams in the RCN\n\nSo Kuyper and his followers were gently chastened by this synod. Nevertheless, this chastening had little lasting effect. Kuyper’s followers became increasingly insistent about his formulations as time went on. They formed one stream in the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands as we get into the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThere was another stream, however. This stream originated with an organization known as the Dutch Christian Student Union. This was a broad organization that involved people from all kinds of different backgrounds. It started off with the Apostles’ Creed as its doctrinal basis, but this was soon abandoned. A statement of purpose was developed which mentioned the Trinity and this also was deemed too restrictive. Soon this organization settled on this purpose: “to introduce and build up the Christian life and worldview, which is grounded in the Bible and which, linking up with the historical development of Christianity, takes account of the needs and demands of the present time.”[3] Seminary students from both the Free University and the seminary in Kampen were involved with this organization; some were even leaders. Even ministers and seminary professors were involved. This was an organization that included the same kind of liberal thinking that had earlier led to the Secession and the Doleantie. It seemed that some people had forgotten their church history or just didn’t care. In 1920 in Leeuwarden, at the synod of the Reformed Churches, a warning was issued against membership in the Dutch Christian Student Union. However, it was just a warning. It didn’t really have any teeth. It didn’t stop further developments.\n\nOne of the developments out of this stream was the Geelkerken case. In a catechism sermon Rev. J. G. Geelkerken stated that it’s possible that there was no literal snake speaking in the Garden of Eden. The case ended up at the Synod of Assen in 1926. The Synod decided against Geelkerken; his views could not be tolerated in the Reformed Churches. However, they went further: they suspended and deposed him. His views were wrong and unbiblical. But this synod did something that contravened the agreed-upon church order. Only a local church can suspend and depose ministers and other office bearers. Still, Synod Assen went ahead and usurped the rights of the local church. This set a bad precedent for years to come.\n\nAs we come into the 1930s, a third stream was developing in the Reformed churches. These were mostly younger ministers who rejected the Dutch Christian Student Union, but also found that some of Kuyper’s views didn’t stand up to biblical and confessional scrutiny. Among these ministers was Klaas Schilder. Schilder began critiquing some of Kuyper’s views and this caused controversy. Kuyper’s devotees accused this Reformational stream of deviating from the Reformed faith.\n\nThe Unravelling\n\nThat brings us to a series of key Synods at which weighty decisions were made.\n\nThe first one is Synod Amsterdam 1936. This synod received a communication from a classis about the doctrinal disputes regarding Kuyper’s views. It wasn’t clear what the classis was asking or proposing. The synod decided to appoint a study committee made up of people from both sides. However, after the synod was over and the committee got to work, it quickly became evident that there were deep problems. One of the people in the committee (Prof. Valentine Hepp) started throwing around accusations with no proof. This behaviour drove out three of the eight other committee members, the three who were on the side of those concerned about Kuyper’s theology. The result, of course, would be an imbalanced report to the next synod. However, those concerned members also wrote their own report.\n\nThe next synod was Sneek 1939. It is usually referred to as Sneek/Utrecht and this synod actually ended up lasting until 1942. This was the synod that would deal with the doctrinal differences. The political situation comes into play here. It was tense. When the synod opened, it was the eve of the Second World War. In 1940, the synod was still on and the Germans invaded the Netherlands. It was a time of national crisis. Proposals were made to the synod to postpone dealing with the doctrinal disputes until there was more stability in national life in the Netherlands. Despite such pleas, the synod plowed forward. The majority report from the study committee was received – it made accusations that some ministers and professors, including Klaas Schilder, were deviating from Scripture and the Confessions. The synod continued through 1940 and 1941, periodically meeting. At the end of 1941, a decision was made to move the synod to Utrecht and reconvene there in May of 1942. The following month a decision was made regarding the doctrinal differences. The Kuyperian stream had scored a victory. The views of Schilder and others were declared out of bounds.\n\nThe next synod was the following year. Notice how synods here follow one upon the other. The Reformed Churches in the Netherlands had become top heavy with synodical hierarchy. Synod Utrecht 1943 received proposals and submissions requesting a reconsideration of the decision of the previous year. However, these were all rejected. This synod also maintained the position of the previous one: Schilder and others would have to fall in line or face the consequences. Synod Utrecht 1943 continued into 1944. When it became evident that Schilder would not surrender and fall in line, the Synod first suspended him and then later deposed him. They did the same with many other office bearers. According to the Reformed Church Order, this was an illegal action. Only local consistories could suspend and depose office bearers. A synod again usurped this authority. It was another classic example of ecclesiastical hierarchy.\n\nOn August 11, 1944 a meeting was held at the Lutheran Church in The Hague. It was supposed to be a meeting for all those concerned about the developments with regard to Schilder and others. Hundreds of people showed up, despite the ongoing war (the Allies had only liberated the southern part of the Netherlands) and the challenges with regard to transportation. At the meeting, after some speeches, Schilder read an “Act of Liberation or Return.” This document was modelled partly on the Act of Secession from 1834. With this Act in hand, people returned to their local churches and the Liberation (Vrijmaking) was underway. Many people freed themselves from the synodical hierarchy. Those who were liberated claimed to be the true continuation of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. They called themselves Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) or Reformed Churches maintaining article 31. Article 31 refers to an article of our Church Order which states that decisions made by synods and classes shall be considered settled and binding unless they are proven to be in conflict with Scripture or the Church Order. The Liberated believed that the doctrinal decisions of 1942 were in conflict with Scripture and the suspensions and depositions in 1944 were in conflict with the Church Order.\n\nReflections\n\nThe Liberation is a fairly recent part of our church history. Shortly after the Liberation, post-War emigration brought many Liberated church members to both Canada and Australia. They were the ones who started the Canadian Reformed Churches and Free Reformed Churches of Australia. It’s a significant part of our heritage.\n\nIt’s sometimes said that the “past is the parent of the present.” For example, if you want to know why our churches are so particular about our Church Order and its principles, you have to understand the Liberation of 1944. If you want to know why the first Dutch immigrants to Canada and Australia didn’t join with other Reformed believers, it’s related to the Liberation. If you want to know why there’s often antipathy towards Abraham Kuyper in the CanRC and FRCA, again it’s 1944. Whether we’re aware of it or not, this event has profoundly shaped the character and culture of our churches.\n\nMy Opa Vanderland was a local leader in the Liberation in his church in Marum. For him, as for many others, this event was deeply personal and any discussion of it would be emotionally charged. He was scarred by the Liberation, as well as by the Nazi occupation happening at exactly the same time. Then he immigrated to Canada. That too was a life-changing experience with hardships we can hardly comprehend. It’s easy to take a triumphalistic view of the Liberation. It’s easy to view it simplistically as an act of God to liberate his people from ecclesiastical wickedness. Yet, as time goes on, we need to also see the extensive personal pain and trouble involved. We can start to see how an intense ecclesiastical conflict like this, however necessary, can shape individuals and churches, and not always in good ways. We always have to remember our constant need for God’s grace, for the gospel, for our Saviour Jesus. After all, a “Liberated” church is still far from a perfect church, both in the past and the present.\n\n[1] Van Oene, Patrimony Profile, 230.\n\n[2] Van Oene, Patrimony Profile, 230.\n\n[3] Van Reest, Schilder’s Struggle, 33."
