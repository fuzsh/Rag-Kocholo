        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nc h a p t e r F o u r The Low Countries Stefaan blancke, abRaHaM c. fliPSe, and joHan bRaeckMan In 2009 the world celebrated the Darwin year. In the Low Countries too, the two-hundredth anniversary of Charles Darwin’s birthday and the one-hundredfiftieth anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species were commemorated by countless events, exhibits, and publications. In Belgium, these celebrations did not inspire a public debate, let alone religious protest. In the Netherlands, however, creationists organized a leaflet campaign by which they intended to inform each and every household about their creationist alternative. This response did not come out of the blue. For decades, evolution has evoked heated debates both among Dutch Christians and in the public domain. In this chapter, we highlight the most relevant historical developments relating to creationism in both countries and cautiously provide an explanation for the remarkable difference in religious responses in the two small adjacent countries. Religious Background Today, both the Netherlands and Belgium are secularized countries, but they have distinct religious traditions. In Belgium, Roman Catholicism has been a dominant cultural factor since the establishment of the country in 1830. Although the influence of the church has waned considerably, Catholicism has left its cultural mark, particularly in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of the country . Nearly 60 percent of the 10.4 million Belgians regard themselves as Catholics , but only 5 to 10 percent of the population attends church regularly. There are small Muslim and Protestant minorities of about 4 percent each, and about 40 percent of the population does not believe in God.1 In contrast, since the time of the Reformation, the Netherlands has always been a religiously divided country. The majority of the population was Protestant (Calvinist), but there was a large Roman Catholic minority, concentrated in the southern provinces, and several other smaller minorities. The privileged position of the Reformed Church in the time of the Dutch Republic explains why today the Netherlands is still viewed as a Protestant country. In the course of the nineteenth century Dutch Protestantism split into several denominations. 66 Stefaan Blancke, Abraham C. Flipse, and Johan Braeckman Around 1900, of the 5 million inhabitants, 49 percent belonged to the Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church), 35 percent to the Roman Catholic Church, and 8 percent to the smaller Reformed churches. Today 17 percent of the Dutch population (of about 16.5 million inhabitants) is Protestant, and 27 percent is Roman Catholic. In addition, 6 percent is Muslim. Almost half the population is not affiliated with any traditional religion.2 It was especially among the members of the smaller Reformed denominations and the orthodox wing of the Dutch Reformed Church—most of whom did not belong to the social, ecclesiastic, or academic elite—that creationism found fertile ground. Although, compared to the United States, the creationist movement remained numerically small, creationism has become a visible and sometimes prominent phenomenon in the twentieth-century Dutch religious landscape. The Dutch Calvinists’ Struggle with Evolution In the nineteenth century, leading theologians at the universities in the Netherlands tried to adapt Christian doctrines to modern science and to the historicalcritical reading of the Bible. These “modernist” theologians managed to reconcile evolution with their faith. However, a considerable number of Dutch churchgoers—both in the Dutch Reformed Church and in various separatist churches—were less favorable to modern science and culture. The theologian, journalist, and statesman Abraham Kuyper became the charismatic leader of this marginalized group of (orthodox) Calvinists, who had no voice either within the churches or in Dutch society, which was dominated by a liberal elite. A process of emancipation started in which the Calvinists established their own private schools, a political party, newspapers, and many other organizations and institutions, including the Calvinist Free University in Amsterdam, founded in 1880. This resulted in a powerful orthodox subculture. Most of Kuyper’s supporters were members of the seceded Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland (Reformed Churches in the Netherlands). Under Kuyper’s leadership, orthodox Calvinism experienced a revival, resulting in a worldview often denoted as “neo-Calvinism.”3 The Roman Catholics, the socialists, and other groups followed the example of the Calvinists, which produced a pattern of social organization called verzuiling (pillarization): a “vertical division” of society into various religious and ideological groups. Between 1920 and 1960 these groups existed in relative isolation, but they also adapted to the general culture and tried to meet the challenges posed by modern society..."
