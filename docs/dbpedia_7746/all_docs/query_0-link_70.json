Noting the recent collapse of the previously dominant ‘two Bavincks’ hypothesis, it explores the impact of this now defunct hermeneutic on the normative reading of Bavinck’s organic motif in the work of Jan Veenhof. In probing Veenhof’s general reliance on the failed ‘two Bavincks’ model and view of the motif through this lens, it becomes evident that a new general reading of Bavinck (which will be used to interpret specific portions of his theology) is required. One must ‘reunite’ the ‘two Bavincks’ by tracing the basis for conceptual unity in his thought. This basis for unity is located in Bavinck’s doctrine of God. In handling the divine paradigm of unity-in-diversity via both triadic and non-triadic emphases, one argues that Bavinck attempts to understand all of nature and history as a broad sweep of Trinitarian divine self-revelation. The redemption and modification of the Augustinian notion of the vestigia trinitatis enables Bavinck to see the Trinity revealed in all of life. He thus commandeers the common organic language of nineteenth-century Europe and, in so doing, loads it with Trinitarian meaning. The working hypothesis developed is that, for Bavinck, a theology of Trinity ad intra leads to a cosmology of organism ad extra. Such a hypothesis is probed in chapters on Bavinck’s doctrines of God, general revelation, Scripture and ecclesiology. In all of these, one finds that Bavinck invokes the organic motif to explain the sense in which the archetypal unity of the Godhead acts as the foundation for all consequent ectypal unity in the creation. As such, the organisch is understood to be Bavinck’s motif of choice when accounting for the triniformity which abounds in all created reality. In this exploration, it becomes apparent that as Bavinck uses the organic motif, he draws on the heritage of both Patristic and Reformation theology. However, he does not merely repristinate this tradition. Rather, his use of the motif is a highly creative development in the intellectual context of the late nineteenth-century.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb xi\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:03 PM\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book is the product of three years of doctoral research at New College, University of Edinburgh. It is not a work produced in isolation. Rather, its content came together thanks to the input and stimulation of many people. In this respect, the primary place of honour must go to my doctoral supervisor, Professor David Fergusson. Over those three years, his scholarly excellence and gracious character taught me a great deal. Thanks are also due to Dr Paul Nimmo, my secondary supervisor, for regular and ongoing encouragement in my engagement with the Reformed tradition. Gratitude is also due to two men whose profound influence upon my teenage years marks me to this day. Without a personal challenge to think theologically from Rev Robert Smith, my secondary school Religious Education teacher, this book would not exist. Indeed, I cannot imagine I would now be working as a theologian were it not for his input at a crucial time. To Rev David Meredith, from whom I inherited a love for ‘contemporary Calvinism’, I offer similar appreciation. I first discovered the writings of Herman Bavinck in the Systematic Theology classroom of Professor Donald Macleod. I regard it a great privilege to have studied under this master dogmatician and hope that this book encourages him in his own theological endeavours. Various individuals have kindly loaned me their ears in acting as a theological soundboard over the past few years: Drs Thomas Forster and William Schweitzer, Professor Carl Trueman and Revs David Strain and Michael Bräutigam have been loyal friends and faithful theological confidants. In his own way, each has contributed something to this book. In 2007, I began my doctoral studies with only the dimmest realisation that I was stepping into a rapidly developing Bavinck movement. The recently completed English translation of Reformed Dogmatics has meant that current interest in Bavinck’s work is considerable. This, in turn, has given me numerous opportunities to attend stimulating conferences and engage with outstanding scholars while preparing this work. Within this sphere, my\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb xii\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:03 PM\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxiii\n\nKampen colleague, Professor George Harinck, has been a continual source of encouragement and assistance, as has Professor John Bolt. Without the generosity of Dr Rimmer de Vries, this book would be far poorer than it is. In April 2009, I spent three weeks conducting research as the resident Puchinger Scholar at Princeton Theological Seminary’s Kuyper Research Centre. The Centre’s warm welcome and constant assistance also greatly enriched my work. On my first research trip to the Netherlands, Dr Wim Balke showed exceptional kindness in introducing me to various scholars who have, in turn, become important research colleagues and friends. I must also offer thanks to the congregation and Kirk Session of St Columba Free Church and Rev Derek Lamont, among whom I served as Ministerial Assistant during the PhD years. Their willingness to accommodate a trainee preacher and teacher has ingrained in me what I hope to be the lifelong conviction that theology must always place itself in service of the church. In terms of practical support, I am pleased to have written this book as a recipient of both the John Hope Scholarship and a New College Divinity Scholarship. To both the Hope Trust and New College, I express gratitude. Gu mo bhean, an Dotair Eilidh Sìne NicDhòmhaill Eglinton; bidh mi taingeil gu bràth airson do ghaoil agus do chuideachaidh.

Je serai toujours à toi. Finally, I should thank those who have made the greatest, lifelong investment in my theological education: my parents James Perman and Ishbel Eglinton. This book is dedicated to you both, as you taught me all of the most important lessons in theology. I acknowledge all mistakes and shortcomings as my own.

Indeed, even outwith the Dutch-speaking world, one finds hints in early twentieth-century anglophone theological literature that Bavinck was a theologian of some repute. In his Hastie Lectures,1 a survey of nineteenth-century Dutch theology delivered between 1909 and 1911 at Glasgow University, James Hutton Mackay remarks: ‘I had intended to notice the work of Professor Bavinck – Dr Kuyper’s loyal and learned theological henchman – before concluding my final lecture. I may give as an excuse for omitting the name of the ablest living writer of Dogmatics in Holland, that Dr Bavinck is still a comparatively young man, and that his place, therefore, belongs to the present rather than to the past century.’2 As the pool of early twentieth-century anglophone theologians with an interest in Dutch theology, or furthermore the ability to read Dutch, was relatively small, such references to Bavinck were fleeting.3 Interestingly, during his own lifetime, Bavinck was known in the English-speaking world primarily for his work on theoretical pedagogy. (It should be noted that the anglophones interested in Dutch Reformed pedagogy were also few in number). However, one century later, Bavinck has gained posthumous fame in the realm of anglophone systematic theology. In 2007, the completed 1\n\nProfessor Hastie taught at Glasgow University in the late nineteenth century. He was well acquainted with German and Dutch theology. 2 James Hutton Mackay, Religious Thought in Holland during the Nineteenth Century (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1911), preface, xi. 3 Mackay’s knowledge of Dutch theology was gained during a decade spent in the Netherlands, six years of which were spent pastoring in Middelburg and Flushing. He acknowledges that prior to his arrival in the country he lacked a nuanced appreciation of its theological spectrum. ‘When I went to reside in Holland, on my return from India ten years ago, I confess I knew very little about the subject I have undertaken to give some account of. The translated works of Kuenen and Tiele, men of world-wide reputation, I had read with interest. Scholten, when I took him up in Holland, seemed somewhat to be not unfamiliar, but Dr Kuyper was little more than a name, and I had never even heard of the Doleantie.’ Mackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 13.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 1\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\n2\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\nEnglish translation of his Gereformeerde Dogmatiek was celebrated by a major conference at Calvin Theological Seminary. The centenary of his 1909 Stone Lectures was, in turn, marked by another Bavinck conference at Princeton Theological Seminary. In September 2010, the Edinburgh Bavinck Conference highlighted the growth of British (and broader European) interest in his writings.4 As such, Bavinck has become a source of much interest beyond the borders of his original Nederlands-speaking context. It would not be fair to ascribe the new interest in Bavinck to a nostalgic, anti-modernist reaction; neither would it suffice to say that the lack of non-Dutch interest in Bavinck throughout the twentieth-century was a sign that he was merely an ‘in house’ theologian deemed unsuitable for export in his own day. Rather, the obvious barrier to earlier interest in his work was linguistic. Those in the anglophone world whose linguistic skills allowed them to penetrate this barrier recognized his significance and, to a certain extent, were responsible for mediating his theology to the Englishspeaking world. The likes of Geerhardus Vos, Louis Berkhof and Cornelius Van Til stand out in this regard. The human being neither develops nor operates in a vacuum; thus the study of any prominent intellectual figure requires more than the reading of primary texts. Each life must be located within a particular context. In Bavinck’s case, this context is primarily that of a fascinating life encompassing a childhood in a separatist manse, a daring decision to study theology at the modernist5 school in Leiden, a brief ministry in Franeker, distinguished academic service in Kampen and Amsterdam and prolific theological and political output. In his own immediate context, Bavinck had two biographers, R.H. Bremmer6 and Valentijn Hepp,7 neither of whose works has been translated into English. As such, the previous century has been marked by a general poverty of English language biographical information within which to locate Bavinck. However, recent years have seen a change in this respect. This shift has been such that the provision of a detailed Bavinck biography is perhaps 4\n\nThe papers from the Edinburgh Bavinck Conference were published in the Scottish Bulletin of Evangelical Theology 29.1 (Spring 2011). 5 The term ‘modernist,’ in a Dutch theological context, dates from 1858, when it first appeared in D.T. Huet’s Wenken opzigtelijk de Moderne theologie (’s-Gravenhage: J. M. van ’t Haaff, 1858), which applied the epithet to the movement begun by Johannes Scholten’s De leer der Hervormde Kerk (Leiden: P. Engels, 1848–50) and Cornelis Opzoomer’s De weg der wetenschap (Amsterdam: J. H. Gebhard 1849). This book’s use of the term is thus with this specific meaning in order to describe the nineteenth-century Dutch theological movement preceding the rise of neo-Calvinism. 6 R. H.

In the light of Bolt’s useful sketch of Bavinck in the Editor’s Introduction to each volume of Reformed Dogmatics,8 Bristley’s biography in his Guide to the Writings of Herman Bavinck9 and Gleason’s recently published biography,10 it appears that the anglophone world is now considerably better informed of Bavinck’s Sitz im Leben. Thus, this work concerns itself only briefly with the question ‘who was Herman Bavinck?’ Rather, it primarily attempts to frame a study of Bavinck’s use of the ‘organic’ via the question ‘where was Herman Bavinck?’ Various works were written during Bavinck’s lifetime to set this scene. However, those published in English were few in number and, because they have been out of print for almost a century, are particularly difficult to access. As such, it seems appropriate to begin a book on Bavinck by recreating his backdrop.11 Viewed in terms of theology-in-history, Bavinck has an intriguing location. He appears at the close of a period which moves from the Réveil and its influence on rural Calvinism to the Groninger School of van Heusde and the Leiden school of his nephew, Johannes Scholten. Bavinck then emerges as a student in Leiden who (with Abraham Kuyper) leads an alternative theological movement: the neo-Calvinist renaissance. Within the exciting, rapid development of Calvin scholarship in the nineteenth-century, Bavinck emerged in Abraham Kuyper’s slipstream as the neo-Calvinists’ dogmatician par excellence. To understand Bavinck generally, one must begin with some analysis of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century circumstances which birthed Dutch neo-Calvinism at the turn of the twentieth-century. In analysing a highly specific area of his thought, namely the organic motif used throughout Bavinck’s writings, one must begin the discussion with a historical overview. 8\n\nJohn Bolt, ‘Editor’s Introduction’ in RD 1.11–19; 2.11–18; 3.10–17; 4.16–23.

As such, it is necessary to begin with a historical survey without which analysis of Bavinck’s handling of the organic motif will prove considerably difficult. Although its subject matter is the theology of Bavinck, this book will make regular references to the key players in his thought world. Thus one must first establish the basic beliefs of the Heusdiaans, the Groningers and the Leiden theologians. One does not attempt to limit historical material to this opening chapter. Rather, subsequent chapters will also frame topical debates (ecclesiology, Scripture and so on) within their respective immediate historical contexts. Those smaller historical sketches, however, depend on and expand the initial broader historical overview provided in this chapter.\n\nI. Who Was Herman Bavinck? Noting in particular that Chapter 2 will offer a reinterpretation of Bavinck’s own biography, it is necessary to provide the reader with a short retelling of his life. Born on 13 December 1854, in the Dutch town of Hoogeveen, Herman Bavinck was the son of Jan Bavinck, a German Reformed pastor. The second of eleven children, Herman was born into the highly conservative, separatist Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken.12 Having excelled throughout his early schooling, he enrolled as a student at the Theological School in Kampen, where his father was a professor. After one year, however, the young Bavinck made the daring decision to transfer to the aggressively modernist theological faculty at Leiden. This choice was made in search of a ‘more scientific’ theological training than could be offered at Kampen.13 Between 1874 and 1880, Bavinck studied under the likes of Johannes Scholten, Abraham Kuenen and Lodewijk Rauwenhoff at Leiden. There, he admired the scientific approach of his professors, though he often found himself in deep disagreement with their presuppositions and doctrinal conclusions. At this time, he also came under the influence of Abraham Kuyper, the rising star of a new wave of Dutch Calvinism. His Christelijke Gereformeerde pastor at Leiden, J. H. Donner, introduced him to Kuyper’s Anti-Revolutionary Party. At Leiden, Bavinck wrote a doctoral thesis on the 12\n\nJohn Bolt, ‘Editor’s Introduction,’ in Herman Bavinck, The Last Things (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1996), 10. 13 Bremmer, Herman Bavinck en zijn Tijdgenoten, 20.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 4\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\nWhere Was Herman Bavinck?\n\n5\n\nethics of Ulrich Zwingli,14 following which he sought ordination in the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken. Despite a deeply suspicious reception, he was admitted into the church and, in 1881, became pastor of the congregation in Franeker. One year later, Bavinck was called to teach theology at Kampen, where he taught from 1883 to 1901. There, he wrote Gereformeerde Dogmatiek. He married Johanna Adrianna Schippers in 1888. During his time at Kampen, Bavinck and Kuyper were the key figures in the Union of the Reformed Churches in 1892. Following this Union, he accepted the post of theology professor at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. This period in his life was marked by a broad and thorough engagement in the fields of politics (via the Kuyperian Anti-Revolutionary Party), philosophy, pedagogy and education. In 1920, after preaching at Synod, Bavinck suffered a heart attack. From this incident onwards, his health began to fail. He died on 29 July 1921.\n\nII. Late Eighteenth- and Early Nineteenth-Century Dutch Theology 1. Mainline Theology pre-Groningen At the turn of the nineteenth-century, various strands of Protestant theology are evident in the Netherlands. Rural life was dominated by a separatist brand of Calvinism drawing its confessional identity from the Heidelberg Catechism. The Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken (Dutch Christian Reformed Church, also known as the Afgescheidenen), within which Bavinck was raised, stood in this tradition of conservative rural Calvinistic pietism. In the Dutch cities, however, one finds differing developments. Prior to the rise of the Groninger school, mainline Dutch Protestantism generally regarded Christianity as a body of truths supernaturally revealed in Scripture. In contrast to the confessional Calvinism of the rural churches, however, mainstream theology often positioned itself against ecclesial dogma in favour of a closer biblicism: doctrines including the Trinity, a two-nature Christology and Calvinistic concepts of atonement and predestination were regularly opposed. Dutch intellectual life, at this point, existed in a strange relationship to wider pan-European trends. Although the Dutch were aware of the philosophical revolution taking place in Germany, mainline theologians 14\n\nHerman Bavinck, De Ethiek van Ulrich Zwingli (Kampen: G. Ph. Zalsman, 1880).\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 5\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\n6\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\nseemed to express little interest in it.15 This was perhaps the case due to their high view of supernatural, Biblical revelation. Roessingh posits this as the reason that Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel made so little initial impact in the Netherlands.16 While Schleiermacher’s works were available in the Netherlands from 1830, the leading Dutch theological journal Godgeleerde Bijdragen remarked on the Dutch translation of his works: ‘We consider it beneath the office of a Protestant teacher to translate such writings and to publish them without corrective annotations.’17 Strauss’ Leben Jesu received a lukewarm welcome, again due to the mainstream commitment to Biblical supernaturalism.18 ‘Whereas in many places in Europe after the Enlightenment theology attempted to determine its position vis-à-vis the new challenges, Dutch theology, exhausted by two hundred years of controversy, slept a deep supernaturalistic sleep.’19 Thus, before the advent of Groninger theology, one finds a mainstream theological tradition within which faith was an assent to a doctrinal system concerning the Christ, which necessitated the presence of a particular heart disposition.\n\n2. The Groninger School: van Heusde, Pareau, van Oordt and Hofstede de Groot Although Dutch Protestantism, until the rise of the Groninger School, existed in somewhat of a time lag, its intellectual life was eventually impacted by the paradigm shifts occurring outwith its borders. The locus of this impact moved between the university cities of Utrecht and Groningen. Phillip Willem van Heusde, appointed professor of Greek and History at Utrecht in 1804, was among the first Dutch advocates of Schleiermacher, Lessing, Herder and the German Vermittlungstheologie (an important school of thought in nineteenth-century German Protestantism which attempted to wed the traditional Reformed confessions with modern science, philosophy and historical scholarship). He portrayed history as a process of humanitywide education towards a morally ideal ‘humanity’.20 In sketching Bavinck’s 15\n\nSee also Simon De Vries, ‘The Hexateuchal Criticism of Abraham Kuenen’, in Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 82, No. 1, (March 1963), 32. 16 K.H.

Scholten, the founder of the opposing Leiden school. A gifted pedagogue, van Heusde attracted a considerable student following, known at the time as Heusdiaans. Between 1829 and 1830, three of van Heusde’s students were promoted to professorships in the northern town of Groningen: the fabulist Louis Gerlach Pareau, Johan Frederik van Oordt and Willem Muurling. A fourth Heusdiaan, Petrus Hofstede de Groot, was appointed head of the Groningen Seminary. Hofstede de Groot was educated at Groningen rather than Utrecht and as such was not directly taught by van Heusde. However, while a student, he was given a manuscript copy of van Heusde’s Lectures on the History of Philosophy; a book which marked him deeply. Van Heusde’s reading of Plato was of particular importance to the Heusdiaans.21 The driving sentiment conveyed to these men was that practical matters (in terms of Christian living and personal experience of Christ) are more important than doctrinal specifics: ‘Niet de leer, maar het leven . . . Niet de leer, maar de Heer!’ 22 This emphasis is evident in the numerous fables popularized by Pareau: ‘Two travellers rose at sunrise to make a journey together. Before setting out they began to dispute with one another as to whether the sun was incandescent only at its surfance, or whether the incandescence went right to its centre. They discussed the question hotly until the sun had set, and so the day was lost.’23 Pareau’s central emphasis is that those who quibble over doctrinal nuances stand to miss out on the reality about which they debate. In charting the Groninger school’s rise to prominence, one notes the sense in which it carried on a precedent set by earlier mainstream theology: a stated unwillingness to look outwith the Netherlands for a basic theological identity. In the previous century, mainline Dutch theologians positioned themselves against the perceived Heidelberg and Geneva centrism of rural Calvinism. Theirs, it was asserted, was an indigenous Dutch appropriation of Christianity. The Groninger school took a similar direction, asserting that they were distinctly Dutch and needed not look abroad for theological direction. Mackay cites ‘a sympathetic critic of the time’: It is not to the credit of our national Church that it should go for its spiritual milk and meat to Scotsmen and Englishmen, the French and the 21\n\nMackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 50.

Foreign books and teachers give foreign twists to our piety. Even in the kingdom of God nationality cannot be disregarded without impunity. And although there is no distinction before God between Jew and Gentile, let every one remain as he is called: he who is called as a Dutchman, a Dutchman let him remain.24 In 1842, Hofstede de Groot published a historical overview of Dutch theology. This work asserted that the Brethren of Common Life, a fourteenth-century sect established in the Netherlands by Geert Groote (1340–84), represented a pure, Dutch theology. This indigenous faith, Hofstede de Groot claimed, was replaced by the imposing alien force of Calvinism. The Polish Reformer, Jan Łaski, as a non-Dutch theologian lauded by the Groningers, was deemed acceptable by association as he was a close friend of the Dutchman Erasmus and worked in the Dutch Churches in Emden and London.25 In this sense, the Groninger theologians coincide with the period of Restoration under King Willem I (1813–40), wherein Dutch culture generally began seeking a keener self-identification in a new Europe.26 Within this context, the Groningen school seems to display a curious set of double standards with regard to foreign ideas. Despite its aversion to much Reformed theology (on the grounds of its non-Dutch origins), its intellectual catalyst (via van Heusde) was undoubtedly German; Lessing, Herder and Schleiermacher were van Heusde’s major influences.27 This influence was passed on to the Heusdiaans who, like Herder and van Heusde, espoused a fervent nationalism.28 Van Oordt, Pareau and Hofstede de Groote established the theological journal Waarheid en Liefde29 in 1837. The latter described its inception as follows: 24\n\nMackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 57. Frustratingly, in following the convention of his time, Mackay does not reference this quotation. The sentiment was common to the Heusdiaans and came from van Heusde’s own insistence on interpreting an individual’s behaviour and actions as the effect of his nationality. Cf.

He gained interest in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1840s, largely through the rise of Dutch nationalism as led by Hofstede de Groot.

Fourteen days ago I saw that we must begin our theology with that’. Said the third, ‘For three or four days I could not get on with my lectures at all till it flashed upon me like a light, “Not a doctrine of Paul or of Jesus is what we have to preach, but the Evangel, that is the glad tidings of a history of what God reveals and presents to us in His Son”.’ In such wise, more or less, we conversed. Who the first, the second, or the last speaker was I no longer remember, but only indeed this, that we now went deeper into a thought that for long had not been strange to us, but which at last and at the same time became quite clear to each of us, although on further discussion it appeared that it had come to one of us more by the way of exegesis, to another by that of history, and to the third by that of philosophy.30 Having established this shared vision, the Groningen school began propagating its views via Waarheid in Liefde and by organizing small discussion groups of pastors and theologians.31 The Groninger school marked a radical departure from its mainstream predecessor. Faith, it taught, was a total self-giving to God and that on the basis of an experience of his love. Although Hofstede de Groot explicitly attributes this change to Schleiermacher’s influence, the Groningers saw fit to develop Schleiermacher’s ‘feeling of absolute dependence’ into a sensus dependentiae, sensus indigentiae, sensus amoris.32 Revelation thus moved from being a set of propositions given by Jesus (the previous mainline view) or about Jesus (the predominant position among rural Calvinists). Rather, revelation was Jesus Christ.33 ‘Christ came to make us over by his personal influence, to make humanity ever more conformed to the likeness of God. This, and not a satisfaction of the Divine justice, is the work of Christ.’34 30\n\nCited in Mackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 59–60. Roessingh, De moderne theologie in Nederland, 26.

This Christology takes an unusual and interesting shape. The Groninger theologians called for a recommitment to pre-Nicean Christology, claiming that before 325, the dominant orthodox view was a one-nature Christology, whereby Jesus has one nature which is simultaneously human and divine. Furthermore, while the Groninger school affirmed the preexistence, miraculous birth and imago Dei status of Christ, it also denied his eternal existence. The Groninger school’s distinctive Christological formulation would ultimately prove decisive in Scholten’s dissatisfaction with its overall dogmatics. This in turn led to the formation of the Leiden school in which Bavinck was educated. In terms of ecclesiology, the Groningers were critical of both traditional Reformed and Lutheran ecclesiologies. Hofstede de Groot charged the Heidelberg Catechism (the confessional standard of the Dutch Reformed Church) with blurring the true meaning of the ecclesia: ‘To understand the doctrine of the true Church, the word Church must first be explained. With the victory of the particularism of Calvinism at the Synod of Dort, insight into the meaning of the Church began to disappear. Luther did not see that separate Christians, each one for himself, can never realise the end of God in the appearance of Jesus Christ; that this can only be realised in the Communion of Saints, a doctrine which Luther did not understand.’35 In its ecclesiology, as Hofstede de Groot’s Theologica Naturalis suggests, the Groningen school was heavily influenced by Jansensim. They laid a strong emphasis on spiritual community. Interestingly, the Groninger theologians chose to abandon the Reformed relationship between Old and New Covenants. Instead, they emphasized the New Covenant’s attachment to the history of the church. Much confusion has arisen in philosophy from not placing sufficiently in the foreground the fact that man is a social being, and can only become man in society. Man, as a solitary being upon a lonely island, is a creature of the imagination, not an actuality. Real men are born of parents, who care for them. They come into a small circle, gradually becoming wider, 35\n\nHofstede de Groot, cited in Mackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 62–3.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 10\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\nWhere Was Herman Bavinck?\n\n11\n\nof brothers and sisters, relations, neighbours, fellow-men, and, unless he lived in this constantly widening human society, the child would not become a man. In his mother’s womb he lives the life of a plant, newly born that of an animal, and an animal he would remain were he not taken up into human society and there gradually formed into a man. The consciousness of the spiritual world, of which the child must become a member, would remain dormant in him if it were not awakened by seeing and hearing other men in whom this consciousness has become awake. It would sleep like the spark in the flint, which has not been struck by iron; like the flame in the oil, which has not been set alight by another flame. In man, viewed apart from society, we can look only for a capacity for the spiritual life. To find the beginning of the spiritual life we must thus go outside the individual, and seek for it in the spiritual society in which he lives.36 Just as the Groningen Christology sets the tone of its ecclesiology, this concept of church has a formative effect on its soteriology. Pareau’s Compendium Theologiæ Christianæ Moralis demonstrates this relationship. Interpreting Christ’s mission as being to establish a community committed to the spiritual and intellectual formation of men, the church’s role and inherent soteriology are spelt out. The church is to strive for the development of Christ’s divine-humanity in its human members.\n\n3. The Réveil: Bilderdijk, Da Costa and van Prinsterer While the Groningen school provoked a succeeding counter-movement in Scholten’s Leiden theological stable, it also coexisted with a competing movement: the Réveil. The character of the Réveil is of considerable importance appropriating various aspects of Bavinck’s immediate background. Taking its name from its Swiss forerunner, the Réveil began to impact the Netherlands in the mid nineteenth-century. The Réveil has been described as a revivalist, ‘sin-and-grace’ brand of religion.37 Due to the particular Calvinism of its early leader, Bilderdijk, the Réveil’s closest contemporary theological relation was the Heidelberg Catechism-led Calvinism of the Dutch countryside. However, the Réveil sprang up in an entirely different 36\n\nHofstede de Groot, Theologica Naturalis, cited in Mackay, Religious Thought in Holland, 63–4. 37 Vanderlaan, Protestant Modernism in Holland, 17.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 11\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\n12\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\nsocial context: it was concentrated primarily in the cities, its leading lights being aristocrats, artists and intellectuals. In contrast to the intensely Dutch character of rural Calvinism, a significant proportion of the Réveil’s exponents were of non-Dutch extraction. While its own existence was relatively short-lived, its theological impact in urban areas (into the neoCalvinist era) would be long lasting. The relative proximity of the Réveil and the more popular, rural, pietistic Calvinism is perhaps best accounted for by their shared roots: they are cousins, rather than siblings; the descendents of an earlier form of continental Calvinism. One was elitist; the other popular. However, their similarity was such that someone like Bavinck, whose background was rural pietism, could smoothly transition into the Réveil’s elitist context. Willem Bilderdijk (1756–1831) was born into a family supportive of the Huis van Oranje-Nassau. Thus, his formative influences were strongly Calvinistic. His opposition to the Batavian Republic38 led to a time in exile, first in Germany, then England. Eventually returning to the Netherlands, he began lecturing privately in Leiden, teaching law and history. In addition to his highly influential poetry, Bilderdijk’s lectures drew a small group of acolytes, among them the Jewish poet Isaac Da Costa and the influential jurist and statesman Groen van Prinsterer. Born in Amsterdam to parents of Portuguese Jewish ancestry, Isaac Da Costa (1798–1860) first encountered Bilderdijk’s poetry while studying under Moses Lemans in Amsterdam. He then moved to Leiden where he joined Bilderdijk’s inner circle. At Leiden he converted to Christianity. Through his poetry and theological writings, he spread the Réveil among the Dutch intelligentsia. The theological sentiments of Da Costa’s poetry would go on to influence the later neo-Calvinist movement.39 Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer (1801–76) was a leading figure among the nineteenth-century Dutch aristocracy. He worked for a time as personal secretary to Willem I. The Réveil’s dissemination of Calvinism in the upper classes reached Groen van Prinsterer, through whom it had a lasting impact: when the Réveil itself had faded out, Groen van Prinsterer enthused what would become the Anti-Revolutionary Party (which Abraham Kuyper would formally establish in 1879, and with which Bavinck 38\n\nThe Batavian Republic, which existed from 1795 to 1806, succeeded the Republic of the United Netherlands. See Jonathan Israel, The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall, 1477–1806 (Oxford: University Press, 1998). 39 van den Belt, for example, has demonstrated that Da Costa’s doctrine of Scripture influenced Bavinck and Kuyper in their concept of organic inspiration as uniting Scripture’s simultaneous humanity and divinity.

As a theological movement, the Réveil positioned itself against the Groninger school. However, it should be stated that for a major player in a theological contest, the Réveil was at one level surprisingly untheological in character. Its theological output was not provided, for the most part, by specialist dogmaticians. Rather, it was the attempt of artists, poets and aristocrats to appropriate a largely conservative brand of Calvinism in an upper-to-middle class city-based environment. As could be expected for a small, elitist movement, the Réveil itself eventually waned. Its influence, however, outlived its own immediate momentum, as can clearly be seen in Groen van Prinsterer’s role in the inception of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (which developed in conjunction with the neo-Calvinist theological revival).\n\n4. The Leiden School: Johannes Scholten The driving force behind Bavinck’s alma mater Leiden school was Johannes Hendricus Scholten (1811–85).40 As a student in Utrecht, Scholten lived with his famous uncle, van Heusde. Following his graduation, he spent two years working as the pastor of a rural congregation. His time as student and clergyman entailed firsthand experience of the various dominant schools of thought: the anti-Reformed bent of the Heusdiaans, the older mainline pre-Groninger theology of the Utrecht theological faculty and then the type of Calvinism deeply ingrained in rural Dutch life. Examination of Scholten’s progress at Utrecht reveals a growing disdain for mainline Dutch theology. His 1836 doctoral thesis makes this clear: mainline theology lacked a unifying principle, which Scholten found in the Christological revelation of divine love.41 While a young minister, Scholten came under the influence of Waarheid in Liefde. Despite his initial warmth towards the Heusdiaans, he came to perceive a major Christological flaw in their theology. This movement away from van Heusde’s theology came to a head in 1840 when Scholten was appointed theology professor at the University of Franeker in the north-western province of Friesland. Interestingly, his student, Bavinck, would also go on to work in Franeker, albeit in the 40\n\nScholten published accounts of his own theological development: Herdenking mijner vijfentwintigjarige ambtsbediening, (Leiden, 1865); and Afscheidsrede bij het neerleggen van het hoogleeraarsambt aan de Universiteit te Leiden (Leiden, 1881). 41 Johannes Scholten, Disquisitio de Dei erga hominem amore (Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1836); see also Scholten, Afscheidsrede, 9.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 13\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\n14\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\npastorate rather than the academy. Scholten’s choice of topic in his inaugural professorial address is telling: the lecture was entitled The Duty of Avoiding Docetism. It was a direct attack on Groninger Christology, which Scholten claimed was inherently Arian. Scholten also charged the rural Calvinists with defective Christology: it was alleged that they presented a less than fully human Christ. In contrast, Scholten’s Jesus was presented as truly and fully human, sent to lead the human race towards his ideal humanity. Scholten taught that Christ is the one humanity can and must become like: ‘nobis vero simul perfectâ voluerit [Deus] humanitatis imagine monstrare quo modo ipsi, et debeamus, et possimus ad divinae naturae similitudinem escendere.’42 The sense in which humanity is dissimilar to Christ is that he is so by his own nature, whereas humanity becomes like Christ through Christ: ‘ud quod ille a se sit, naturâ suâ, et vero origine prorsus singulari, id nos possimus et debeamus aliquando fiere; at vero non a nobis, non proprio, quod dicitur, remigio, sed unice per illum.’43 In relation to the Groninger school, the early Scholten also maintains the virgin birth and pre-existence of Christ, though the latter topic receives little attention in his work. By virtue of its academic composition (at this time, Franeker University was comprised only of its theological faculty) and low student numbers, Scholten’s time at Franeker left much time for private study. In 1844, the Franeker faculty was closed, its building having been earmarked by the Dutch government as the site of a new psychiatric hospital. Scholten was initially reluctant to move elsewhere, but eventually was relocated to Leiden University where he remained throughout his working life. There, his opening lecture argued that Christianity demonstrated its divine origin in animo humano, and thus countered both the rationalism and supernaturalism of older mainline Dutch theology. In sketching Scholten’s appropriation of Reformed theology, two foci are of particular importance. First, one finds his definition of the formal and material principles of the Reformed faith. Scholten lacked van Heusde’s total aversion to historic Reformed theology. His drive was to examine the Reformed Church’s historic confession of faith and the writings of the Reformers. In doing so, Scholten identified Scripture as the Reformed faith’s formal principle: the church depends on divine self-revelation. This is followed by the material principle of unqualified divine sovereignty: one is utterly reliant on God for salvation 42\n\nJohannes Scholten, Oratio de vitando in Jesu Christi historia interpretanda docetismo, nobili, ad rem Christianam promovendam hodiernae theologiae munere (in Annales Academi, 1839–40, HagaeComitis, 1842), 265. 43 Scholten, Oratio de vitando in Jesu Christi, 273.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 14\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\nWhere Was Herman Bavinck?\n\n15\n\nby grace alone. During his time in the pastorate, Scholten was particularly impressed with the rural Calvinists’ rigid commitment to predestination. Scholten’s conviction was that Reformed theology, via this distinction, presents Christianity with greater clarity than its Lutheran or Roman Catholic alternatives. It seems fairly settled that Scholten’s adoption of these principles was taken from Alexander Schweizer’s Die Glaubenslehre der evangelischreformierten Kirche.44 Scholten’s Leer der Hervormde Kerk references Schweizer’s work regularly. Indeed Berkhof goes as far as saying that ‘Scholten, like Schweizer, set out to demonstrate that the theology of the Reformers, or the Reformed confessions, found its fulfilment in idealistic thought.’45 In this respect, one may clearly observe a high degree of consistency between Schweizer and his follower, Scholten. The distinction between ‘material’ and ‘formal’ principles first enters the Protestant theological vocabulary in the work of August Twesten, an early student of Schleiermacher. Twesten, writing in a Lutheran context, wrote of Scripture as Protestantism’s ‘formal principle’, and justification sola fide as the ‘material principle’ of distinctly Lutheran theology.46 In Die Glaubenslehre, Schweizer, described elsewhere as ‘arguably Schleiermacher’s most gifted student,’47 notes Twesten’s earlier handling of Lutheran theology’s ‘material principle’ as justification by faith alone. By contrast to this, he portrays the Reformed equivalent as ‘absolute dependence upon God alone,’ which his dogmatic formulation articulated as ‘absolute predestination.’48 McCormack has argued that, in Schweizer’s theology, this material principle lacked an ultimate, all-controlling influence. ‘It would have been very surprising indeed had Schweizer envisioned a system of doctrine derived more or less from a single material norm. The critical distance which he maintained from all doctrinal explanations of the religious consciousness would never have allowed such a move. And the truth is that he did not take that step.’49 44\n\nAlexander Schweizer, Die Glaubenslehre der evangelisch-reformierten Kirche, Dargestellt und aus den Quellen belegt, 2 vols.

Second, Scholten’s debate with Opzoomer over the issue of determinism profoundly impacted his theological system.50 It moved his thought from idealism to empiricism, gave his doctrine of God a distinctly monistic flavour and ingrained his predestinationism with starkly anti-supernatural lines. The change brought on Scholten was central in the development of the Leiden school within which Bavinck was educated, and against which he would later write. When examining the Réveil’s theology, Scholten understood its major emphases (a theology of atonement, the Trinity and Jesus’ deity) to be misplaced. He argued that the Réveil had supplanted the Reformed tradition’s material principle of predestination in grace. In doing so, he claimed that the Réveil had fundamentally misappropriated Reformed theology.51 In this light, Scholten’s understanding and definition of ‘Reformed’ is somewhat unusual. Clearly, Scholten was a highly committed theist. Particularly as he shifted from idealism to empiricism in the aftermath of his debate with Opzoomer, an omnicausal deity provided Scholten with a convincing reason for assenting with the prevailing determinism of contemporary natural science. Theism was a suitable foundation for a mechanical worldview. A critical reading of Scholten might suggest that his particular principle of determinism provided the hermeneutic with which he then formed a doctrine of God, rather than allowing God’s self-revelation to shape the relationship of God’s will to cosmic history.52 Such a claim finds momentum in Scholten’s own theological development. Particularly as he moved towards empiricism, his determinism adopted a rigid, antisupernaturalist pose. In tandem with this, his doctrine of God became less Trinitarian and more monistic.53 Such an outcome fits neatly with Scholten’s earlier assertion that the specifics of God’s being (in particular his triunity) are less important than the material principle of predestination.54 Outwith the bare formal and material principles of Scripture and predestination, which comprise the heart of Scholten’s Reformed 50\n\nBerkhof, Two Hundred Years of Theology, 98–103. Scholten, De leer der Hervormde Kerk, 18–20. 52 Scholten’s statement that his doctrine of God is reached by ‘reflection grounded upon observation [of the cosmos]’ (‘bespiegeling gegrond op waarneming’, De leer der Hervormde Kerk, 4:lxi) also hints at this verdict. 53 This fact was not lost on Bavinck, who critiqued Scholten for this very point: Herman Bavinck, RD 2.43. See also Herman Bavinck, Philosophy of Revelation (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1909), 46. Hereafter PR. 54 Scholten, De leer der Hervormde Kerk, 18–20. 51\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 16\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:04 PM\n\nWhere Was Herman Bavinck?\n\n17\n\nChristianity, little else in the Reformers’ own theology needs to be retained if one is to remain in their tradition. On the grounds that it is inconsistent with the principle that God predestines everything and that this must be done in grace, Scholten argues that Calvin was wrong, among other things, to maintain a belief in hell. He makes similar claims regarding soteriology and previous Reformed doctrines of sin and forgiveness, consistently arguing that such doctrines contradict the two aforementioned supreme principles of the Reformed faith.55 At the core of this thought is that from its inception, the Reformed faith, even in certain aspects of the works of Calvin and Luther, has contained much that contradicts its own material and formal principles, and as such must be fundamentally reworked. The Leiden school’s assertion was that it had brought this revision. Its rigorously naturalist, mechanical, theistic determinism was, Scholten claimed, the purest expression of the essential Reformed faith. It must be noted that aside from broadly similar commitments to revelation and predestination, Scholten’s understanding of ‘Reformed’ has relatively little in common with the Reformers or substantial sections of the subsequent Reformed tradition. When one examines Calvin’s own hierarchy of truths, the true doctrine of God takes ultimate priority, following which he lists the theology of the gospel.56 Calvin’s priorities were somewhat different from those of Scholten. Vanderlaan offers the somewhat cynical assessment that ‘because Calvinism is deterministic, and Scholten also is a determinist, therefore Scholten thinks himself a true Calvinist.’57 Considerable Trinitarian and Christological differences highlight that the Leiden school offered a radical reinterpretation of Reformed theology.58 Establishing this fact is central in understanding Bavinck’s aims as a former student of this school. Indeed, it sets the backdrop for Bavinck’s appropriation of the Reformed tradition in Gereformeerde Dogmatiek. One notes such an emphasis as present in Bavinck’s post-Leiden letters.59 A significant element in Bavinck’s writing (particularly as regards his organic motif), it will be seen, is his redefinition of Reformed theology contra Scholten. Taking this approach to Bavinck and Scholten is hardly 55\n\nScholten, De leer der Hervormde Kerk, 18–20. John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, IV.i, 12.

The Higher Education Act (1876) In examining the context in which Bavinck’s theology develops, one also acknowledges the influence of debate on the place of theology in the university. Bavinck was born into a context where the basic right of theology to exist within the academy was called into question. In response to the panEuropean Revolutions of 1848, the Dutch Parliament adopted a new, liberal constitution in October 1848. This constitution placed the Dutch government under considerable pressure to replace the theology departments in its universities with religious studies faculties. Bavinck, who entered higher education at Kampen in 1873 before moving to Leiden one year later, became a student at the climax of this struggle. In 1876, midway through his Leiden years, the Higher Education Act was passed. The net effect of this legislation was that the Dutch universities were to retain the name ‘theology’, but the content of their teaching was to become ‘religious studies’. Bavinck’s own recollection of this environment focuses on its uncertainty regarding theology’s nature and possibility: The reason for this odd development was that the state did not wish to relinquish its influence in the training of ministers for the Dutch Reformed Church (Nederlands Hervormde Kerk) while at the same time the synod [of the NHK] was unable or unwilling to create its own institution for the training of its ministers. The result was a strange mixture of incompatibles lacking all integration and unity of conception. Some of the subjects taught remind one of the old theology programs; others clearly belong to the field of religious studies. This unfortunate development also places the professors who must lecture in these departments in a difficult situation.61 The significance of this movement can scarcely be underemphasized in developing a reading of Bavinck’s theology.

Neo-Calvinism: Herman Bavinck and Abraham Kuyper No account of Bavinck’s historical theological backdrop would be complete without reference to Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920), one of Scholten’s most prominent students and, later, the figurehead of the neo-Calvinist movement with which Herman Bavinck was so heavily involved. Harinck memorably writes: ‘When mentioned together, we take the names of Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck not as the name of two individuals but as a brand name. Kuyper and Bavinck belong together like Goldman and Sachs or Mercedes and Benz. Together they stand for neo-Calvinism.’66 Through the work of Scholten’s successor, LWE Rauwenhoff,67 the Leiden school came to emphasize a particularly ethical focus in dogmatics. Kuyper’s theological adolescence was spent learning Scholten’s brand of Reformed theology via Rauwenhoff’s ethical lens.68 ‘At Leyden Abraham Kuyper had been the ardent pupil of Scholten, inspired by his knowledge of Reformed theology and his determination to raise it, through fresh interpretation, to 62\n\nRD 1.36–58. ‘In the Netherlands, in 1876, following the ideas of Tiele and Rauwenhoff, a division was instituted at state universities between the science of religion, which would be taught by the university, and the dogmatic and practical disciplines, which would be taught under the auspices of the church. . . . In the Netherlands this is the direction that has been taken by modern theologians for many years already and is embodied in the Higher Education Act of 1876.’ 63 RD 1.37. 64 Herman Bavinck, ‘Godgeleerdheid en godsdienstwetenschap’ in De vrije kerk 18 (1892), 197–225. 65 Herman Bavinck, Godsdienst en godgeleerdheid (Wageningen: Vada, 1902). 66 George Harinck, ‘Herman Bavinck and Geerhardus Vos,’ Calvin Theological Journal 45 (2010), 18. 67 The most thorough recent summary of Rauwenhoff’s theology is P.

Relatively early on, Kuyper’s theological trajectory changed considerably. Various factors contributed to this about-turn: his earlier research on the preScholten Reformed tradition (principally in the works of John Calvin and Jan Łaski71), exposure to an alternative understanding of the Reformed faith in his early rural parish ministry and a personal crisis of faith leading to an experience of spiritual ‘rebirth’. In sketching the rise of neo-Calvinism, the state of Calvin studies in Kuyper’s youth should be noted. Kuyper became a student when modern Calvin study was at its earliest stage. Remarkably, Beza’s Ioannis calvini vita (1575) remained the only published Calvin biography until Friedrich Perthes’ Das Leben Johann Calvins des grossen Reformators (1835). By Kuyper’s time, the single most important work on Calvin was Henry’s 2,200-page volume on Calvin (1844).72 While Kuyper was an undergraduate, the first baccalaureate theses on Calvin were written at the University of Strasbourg.73 One thus finds Kuyper (followed shortly by Bavinck) entering theological study just as Calvin studies was emerging as an exciting discipline in its own right. However, the Dutch theological scene lagged behind Germany and France in this regard. The premier Dutch Calvin biography was P.J.L. Huet’s Iets over Calvyn,74 a popular-level work based on somewhat limited sources. Prior to Kuyper’s work, only two doctoral theses on Calvin were written in the Netherlands, and this interest was limited to Utrecht University.75 The theses, supervised by Professors Vinke and Royaards, used only Dutch and 69\n\nBerkhof, Two Hundred Years of Theology, 109.

However, his essay on Calvin and Łaski shows the change in his view from church as outmoded and involuntary to the climax of God’s plan for the cosmos. This essay marks the entry point of ‘organic’ language into Kuyper’s writings.

Immediately preKuyper, the wave of Calvin studies received distinct reception in the leading Leiden and Groningen schools. In the north, the Groningers rejected Calvin’s views on the unity of Scripture, atonement and predestination. They did, however, laud his Pneumatology.76 No works devoting exclusive attention to Calvin came out of the Groninger school. In the west, as has already been described, the Leiden school enthusiastically latched onto the idea of predestination and adapted it into a rigid brand of mechanical determinism. What should be emphasized at this point is that when Kuyper was a student, Scholten’s understanding of Calvinism was by no means universally accepted: Calvin studies was a theological growth industry. Indeed, the epithet ‘Calvinism’ was, at this point, without a conclusive definition in the Netherlands. The young Kuyper was initially unimpressed with Scholten’s dogmatics classes. ‘As far as one can make out, not one professor of theology really charmed him in that first year, nor could the dogmatician Scholten. Although Kuyper together with other students was received by Scholten at his home on at least two occasions for the customary cup of tea, no special relationship developed.’77 Thus when one finds Kuyper embarking on an essay competition on the ecclesiology of Calvin and Łaski,78 it should come as little surprise that although he was Scholten’s student, he did not merely accept Scholten’s definition of Calvinism. Rather, Kuyper embarked on in-depth study of the original texts. A brief glance at Kuyper’s early research on Calvin hints at the dynamic nature of this new field and, accordingly, highlights the path that Bavinck was soon to follow in the fledgling neo-Calvinist school of thought. His early work on Calvin was not limited to the resources available in Leiden or, for that matter, the appropriation of Calvin taught there. Kuyper conducted research trips to Utrecht, Haarlem, Amsterdam and The Hague.

He also began to investigate access to works on Calvin in Germany (Frankfurt am Mein, Hamburg and Dresden) and France (Strasbourg). In 1859, Kuyper became aware that a dissertation on Calvin had been written at Strasbourg University. He wrote to Edouard Reuss,79 the New Testament Professor at Strasbourg, requesting a copy of this work. Reuss complied quickly, sending Kuyper a copy of the dissertation in question along with nine other theses of which Kuyper had been wholly unaware. The impact of this on Kuyper was considerable. The quality of Kuyper’s research and involvement with Reuss marked his arrival as a major player in the rapidly expanding area of Calvin studies. Indeed, Kuyper blazed a trail followed by Bavinck: in order to portray either theologian accurately, one must consider them at the crest of a new wave of rigorous Calvin scholarship. (With regard to Bavinck’s theological identity and the nature of his organic motif, this point is of particular relevance: intensive engagement with Calvin led to his disagreement with Scholten on the content of Calvinism. Set in this light, Bavinck’s short work Johannes Calvijn becomes particularly interesting).80 One biographical point that should not be omitted is the acknowledgement that the eight months of intensive research invested by Kuyper in this study led to a period of nervous exhaustion following the competition. A six-month spell in a spa at Wiesbaden followed the news that he had won the competition.81 Kuyper thus began his ministry having already suffered burnout. In addition to this, Kuyper’s early ministry took place at a time when the implementation of Scholten’s vision began to falter. Having initially spread quickly via popular-level works such as Conrad Busken Huet’s Questions and Answers: Letters about the Bible82 the Leiden school’s momentum ground to a halt in the 1870s. During the 1860s, a significant number of its early exponents resigned their pastoral charges. Four years after the publication of Questions and Answers, C.B. Huet left the ministry in favour of a career in journalism.83 In 1866, he published a pamphlet stating that ministers of like theological disposition who remained within the church were guilty of dishonesty.84 79\n\nCf.

His resignation was accompanied by the pamphlet Letter to my Last Church.85 The remainder of his career was spent teaching literature, aesthetics and art history in Heidelberg and Amsterdam. In the following decade, the Leiden school’s line of questioning first became ‘what can be done to enthuse the clergy and laity alike with this theology?’ before shifting to ‘can the clergy’s religion also be that of the laity?’86 The Dutch ecclesiastical scene became a fractured environment. Under the leadership of Philip Reinhart and Petrus Hermannus Hugenholtz, the De Vrije Gemeente seceded in 1877 from the Hervormde Kerk in Amsterdam. The Vereeniging van Vrijzinning-Hervormden (The Liberal Reformed Union) formed in Leiden. The Protestantenbond also came into existence at this time. As the Leiden school’s impact fractured, it began to voice serious concerns as to its own relevance and workability. The young Kuyper first looked to its principal critics, Alexandre Vinet, Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye and Johannes Hermanus Gunning. In 1863, Kuyper became minister of the Hervormde Kerk in Beesd. At this point, his relationship with his father was somewhat strained. The two had clashed on various issues of confessional commitment within the church. The following year, he met the Réveil statesman, Groen van Prinsterer, who encouraged his continued engagement with Calvin. In the face of Kuyper’s ideological departure from his father, Groen van Prinsterer became something of a second father to him. At the same time, his experience of the different appropriation of Calvinism in the volkskerk profoundly affected Kuyper. The simple faith of Pietje Balthus, a farmer’s wife, marked him deeply. The 1880s saw Kuyper at the forefront of significant developments in both church and academy. These developments involved Herman Bavinck directly. In 1880, Kuyper founded the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He was quickly installed as its professor of theology and first rector. Recognizing the talents of the Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken’s young Dr Bavinck, Kuyper quickly set about recruiting him for the Vrije Universiteit. Indeed, he made two failed approaches to Bavinck (in 1881, just over a decade before the 1892 Union of Churches, and again in 1895, after the Union) before he finally accepted the post in 1902. This was also a time of major ecclesiastical upheaval in the Netherlands. Again, Kuyper was at the centre of this, and Bavinck was also directly 85 86\n\nAllard Pierson, Brief aan mijn laatste gemeente (Arnhem, 1865). A.M.

The Amsterdam Consistory of the Hervormde Kerk, of which Kuyper was a member, began to make insistences regarding the confessional subscription of its members. Due to this, some eighty Amsterdam presbyters, including Kuyper, were suspended in 1885. Following a failed ecclesiastical appeal, Kuyper’s group (which numbered approximately two hundred congregations) became known as the Dolerenden; literally the ‘grieving ones’. Seeing no future within the Hervormde Kerk, Kuyper’s Doleantie group left the State Church in 1886 and began to operate independently while seeking ecclesiastical union with Bavinck’s Christelijke Gereformeerde Kerken. In 1892, the Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland became the fruit of this movement of schism-into-union. Thus by the early 1890s, one finds Bavinck and Kuyper as members in the same denomination. Within a few years, they were also colleagues at the same university. This complex web of factors dovetails into Kuyper’s role at the forefront of the neo-Calvinist movement in which Herman Bavinck appears.\n\nIV. ‘The Brief Triumph of Neo-Confessionalism’ The unique historical story of the Netherlands meant that Bavinck and Kuyper appeared as the figureheads of a neo-Confessional revival somewhat out of step with similar trends in other European countries. While similar neo-Confessional movements had bloomed elsewhere in the 1820s and 1830s, the Dutch revival occurred a half-century late. Berkhof accounts for this in terms of the late arrival of modernism in the Netherlands: ‘Here this theology was consciously forged, next to and after modernism and the theology of mediation, as a third response to the intellectual challenge arising from the Enlightenment. That is what gave it a vitality and scope which is usually not typical of confessionalism elsewhere. Besides, it was a powerful inspiration in the political and cultural awakening of the Calvinistic segment of the population which in these years achieved a strong position in the modern world.’87 The uniqueness of the neo-Calvinist movement is worth noting: before ecclesiastical conflict brought Dutch systematic and public theology to a virtual standstill, the movement fronted by Bavinck and Kuyper represented the zenith of a confessional emphasis that would go unmatched until the aftermath of World War I. 87\n\nBerkhof, Two Hundred Years of Theology, 113.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 24\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:05 PM\n\nWhere Was Herman Bavinck?\n\n25\n\nV. The Context of Reformed Dogmatics When one begins to outline the major events of Kuyper’s life, it becomes difficult to proceed without also making frequent explanations of Bavinck’s role and thus stray into the reproduction of Bavinck’s biography.88 Such is not the intention of this chapter. Rather, its aim is captured in Picasso’s earlier cited words to Brassaï: in understanding the works of an artist, one must know when he produced them, how, why and in which circumstances. As such, one finds Bavinck’s major legacy to theology, the Reformed Dogmatics, appearing at the end of two centuries of struggle over the true identity of Reformed Christianity. Clearly, various competitors have claimed to be Calvin’s theological offspring: the Réveil theologians, the Heusdiaans, Scholten and now Kuyper. In such circumstances, that Bavinck attaches the descriptor Gereformeerde to his four tomes of dogmatic theology is highly telling. He is fully cognisant of his own historical–intellectual context. To Bavinck’s own mind, Gereformeerde Dogmatiek is just that. He is entering the ring with a clear intention; he is also laying claim to the Reformed tradition. In context, the production of a dogmatiek is also somewhat significant. Vanderlaan’s survey of Dutch Protestant modernist theology ends before the neo-Calvinists appear and thus he makes no mention of Bavinck. His closing paragraph notes that in the various moves from Groningen to Leiden, the discipline of systematic theology had suffered a great deal. He closes with the following fascinating remark: ‘But no modernist produces a dogmatiek. Some feel that on a “modern” basis, with authority gone, no generally acceptable system of dogmatics can be written. And yet, if some new Schleiermacher should arise, to set all religious thought once again on a new foundation, who knows whether the Dutch modernists may not yet enjoy a renaissance of systematic theology?’89 In the light of history, the resurrection of dogmatics in Dutch theology was soon to occur. However, this much anticipated dogmatician arose in an entirely different theological stable. The ‘new Schleiermacher’ was the son of a separatist manse, the student of Scholten but the theological mouthpiece of neo-Calvinism. 88\n\nFor a helpful statement on why Bavinck was drawn to the Kuyperian movement, see John Bolt, ‘Grand Rapids between Kampen and Amsterdam,’ Calvin Theological Journal 38 No. 2 N. 2003, 267. 89 Vanderlaan, Protestant Modernism in Holland, 122.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 25\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:05 PM\n\n26\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\nIt would seem that the purpose of the first volume of Reformed Dogmatics, Prolegomena, is to rediscover the lost art of systematic, Reformed theology. Most interesting is that Bavinck’s strivings to resurrect the science of gereformeerde dogmatiek are so consistently peppered with references to the ‘organic’. The distinctly neo-Calvinistic relationship between this dogmatic task and the organic motif, which will thus form the subject of this book, is suggested in Kuyper’s Fourth Stone Lecture: The subject-matter of the several sciences must be grouped under one head and brought under the sway of one principle by means of theory or hypothesis, and finally Systematics, as the queen of sciences, comes forth from her tent to weave all the different results into one organic whole. . . . The question about the origin, interconnection and destiny of everything that exists cannot be suppressed; and the veni, vidi, vici wherewith the theory of evolution with full speed occupied the ground in all the circles, inimical to the Word of God, and especially among our naturalists, is convincing proof of how much we need unity of view.90\n\n90\n\nAbraham Kuyper, Lectures on Calvinism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1931), 113.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 26\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:05 PM\n\nChapter 2\n\nHow Many Herman Bavincks?\n\nI. Introduction1 This book provides a new reading of Herman Bavinck’s use of the organic motif in theology. As such, its first substantial (and most important) conversation partner is Jan Veenhof, whose seminal publication Revelatie en Inspiratie 2 is generally regarded as the benchmark for work on Bavinck’s use of the organic. With a few notable recent exceptions, secondary material on Bavinck defers to Veenhof’s interpretation of this aspect of Bavinck’s theology. However, as will soon become apparent, this book advances a considerably different general reading of Bavinck’s theology which, in turn, leads to a major departure from its specific application to the organic motif. Although Chapter 3 will offer a critical evaluation of Veenhof’s reading of Bavinck on a specific topic (the organic motif), it is first necessary to describe and evaluate the basic assumption through which he reads Bavinck. In this instance, the general shapes the particular and, as such, one must critique the former before the latter.\n\nII. Towards a New ‘General’ Reading of Bavinck Bavinck’s personal biography is an unusual one. As the son of a separatist manse, the student of modernist theologians and the iconoclastic writer of Gereformeerde Dogmatiek, the dogmatician who later became a highly active politician and educational theorist, his theological species has proven rather difficult to classify. The riddle of how this theologian could somehow exist between so many apparent extremes has given the bulk of 1\n\nAn earlier version of this chapter has been published as James Eglinton, ‘How Many Herman Bavincks?

In short, the normative reading has been of Bavinck as a bipolar figure: he is seemingly a Jekyll and Hyde theologian who vacillates between moments of ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘modernity’ without ever resolving his own basic crisis of theological identity. The habit has been to speak of ‘two’ Herman Bavincks. The ‘two Bavincks’ hypothesis rests on a particular interpretation of his personal narrative: it combines the factors of his conservative upbringing, liberal university education, employment as a reformed dogmatician, involvement in politics, philosophy, psychology and education, and various events from his old age (the most famous being the sale of his theological library3 and dying statement: ‘My dogmatics avail me nothing, nor my knowledge, but I have my faith and in this I have all’4). This hypothesis is not a simple recognition of ‘orthodox’ and ‘modern’ elements in Bavinck’s theology, the presence of which can scarcely be ignored. In a qualified sense, one may speak of a ‘duality’ in Bavinck’s thought.5 A. Anema, one of Bavinck’s colleagues at the Vrije Universiteit, on noting that Bavinck was both a ‘Secession preacher and a representative of modern culture’, once remarked: ‘That was a striking characteristic. In that duality is found Bavinck’s significance. That duality is also a reflection of the tension—at times the crisis—in Bavinck’s life. In many respects it is a simple matter to be a preacher in the Secession Church, and, in a certain sense, it is also not that difficult to be a modern person. But in no way is it a simple matter to be the one as well as the other.’6 The ‘two Bavincks’ interpretation of his biography is that Bavinck never reconciled the basic duality of orthodoxy and modernity. Unlike Anema’s careful remark that it is not easy to be both orthodox and modern, the hypothesis asserts that for Bavinck, this ultimately proved an impossible task. For Bavinck, the greatest of crises had no great solution, and thus the trend has been to speak of two Bavincks rather than one. This caricature has, for many decades, provided a hermeneutical lens through which Bavinck’s particular nuances have been interpreted. The net effect of this bipolar reading has been the division of Bavinck’s work 3\n\nHepp reports Bavinck as having said: ‘I have no further need of them.’ Hepp, Dr. Herman Bavinck, 317–18. Dosker, ‘Herman Bavinck’, 21. 5 John Bolt provides a thorough overview of this ‘duality’ in ‘A Man Between Two Worlds’, The Imitation of Christ Theme in the Cultural-Ethical Ideal of Herman Bavinck (PhD dissertation, Toronto, University of St Michael’s College, 1982), 53–9. 6 Cited in Veenhof, Revelatie en Inspiratie, 108.

The basic conviction of this book is that Bavinck’s theological vision is considerably more sophisticated and united than the normative reading makes out. As will be put forward, the ‘two Bavincks’ reading overlooks the central theme of his work: divine tri-unity leads to an overriding concern for synthesis, which, although not conceptually synonymous with the organic motif, is associated with and regularly expressed by it. Re-reading Bavinck in this light (which, in turn, requires a dramatic reappraisal of the aforesaid motif) provides a solution to the de facto apartheid which has been erected in the realm of Bavinck studies. As will be demonstrated, Bavinck turns to the organic motif when explaining the sense in which the archetypal unity of the Godhead brings a sense of coherence to all other reality. As such, one of the great misfortunes of Bavinck studies is that the organic motif has been misunderstood for so long as a symptom of disunity, rather than the primary analogy and agent of unity in the creation. This chapter is thus intended to frame the remainder of this book. It first surveys the current field of Bavinck studies in order to highlight the current dependence on the ‘two Bavincks’ model. Having done so, it highlights the inherently problematic nature of the hypothesis. In developing this theme, it then demonstrates various significant flaws behind the ‘two Bavincks’ reading and notes that the wider world of Bavinck studies is beginning to move away from its basic assumptions on Bavinck’s alleged incoherence. Acknowledging that Veenhof’s reading of the organic motif rests on this model, the chapter develops the proposal that a new reading of the organic motif and a new (united) interpretation of Bavinck go hand in hand. Fresh study of the organic motif, one hopes, will shed much light on the sense in which there was one Bavinck, rather than two.\n\nIII. The ‘Two’ Bavincks Writing on the multifaceted nature of Bavinck’s personal history, John Bolt has claimed that Bavinck, most unfortunately, lends himself to this caricaturing. (It should be observed, as will be subsequently explained, that Bolt’s position on the ‘two Bavincks’ has changed considerably in the course of recent debate.) ‘We must begin by reminding ourselves that any consideration of Herman Bavinck’s influence has to start with the annoying acknowledgment that there is not just one but rather two Bavincks. Radically\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 29\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:05 PM\n\n30\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\ndifferent people and agendas could and did appeal to Bavinck as the authority for their views.’7 Central to Veenhof’s portrayal of Bavinck is also that there are ‘two Bavincks’ and ‘two poles’ in his thought.8 Veenhof’s influence on the wider handling of Bavinck has been considerable; indeed, the bipolar portrayal of Bavinck has become normative. This is particularly evident when one surveys the use of Bavinck’s name in recent debates on the doctrine of Scripture. In this context, Henk Vroom writes: ‘[A] time bomb lay under Bavinck’s view of Scripture. He combines two opposing lines: that of absolute authority and the broad, unshakeable certainty of faith on the one hand and openness in the search for the true meaning of texts and their correct application in modern life on the other. For this reason later generations could choose which of Bavinck’s lines they wished to follow. Among Bavinck’s students some followed one line of thinking, and others followed another.’9 Typical of recent presentations of Bavinck’s life and theology is Malcolm Yarnell’s ‘Herman Bavinck, Reasonably Reformed’.10 Writing that the ‘two major aspects’ of his theological foundation are philosophy and Scripture, Yarnell makes the claim that ‘Bavinck’s enigmatic, shifting and often contradictory treatment of these two aspects of his theological foundation, or “two poles”, has resulted in the conjecture that there were “two Bavincks”. The “first Bavinck” is a Reformed and theological churchman, while the “second Bavinck” is a modern and progressive academic.’11 On this foundation, Yarnell produces an overview of Bavinck’s theology through the ‘two Bavincks’ lens. The claim so commonplace within Bavinck scholarship (as exemplified by Yarnell) is that his theology, to a greater or lesser extent, is selfcontradictory to the point of being impossible to replicate. Rather, one must select ‘which Bavinck’ to follow. While Vroom’s claim is at the extreme end in this debate, the invocation of his name in debates on Scripture consistently present Bavinck as an incoherent figure, particularly in vociferous claims that he is both strongly opposed to and highly supportive 7\n\nJohn Bolt, ‘Grand Rapids between Kampen and Amsterdam: Herman Bavinck’s influence and reception in North America’, 263–64. 8 Veenhof, Revelatie en Inspiratie, 108–11. 9 Henk Vroom, ‘Scripture Read and Interpreted: The Development of the Doctrine of Scripture and Hermeneutics in Gereformeerde Theology in the Netherlands’, Calvin Theological Journal, 28 No. 2 (1993), 363. 10 Malcolm B.

Indeed, it is used in a paradigmatic fashion throughout his writings. Brian Mattson, another recent critic of the ‘two Bavincks’ reading, highlights that Eugene Heideman’s The Relation of Revelation and Reason in E. Brunner and H. Bavinck attempts to discover ‘which Bavinck’, the ‘biblical’ Bavinck or the ‘idealist, scholastic’ Bavinck, is responsible for various sections of Reformed Dogmatics.14 As will be seen, the most obvious recent examples of this are the appeals to ‘two Bavincks’ with regard to the two kingdoms theology (VanDrunen) and the organic motif (Veenhof). Bolt’s reluctant acceptance of the ‘two Bavincks’ hypothesis rests on an oft-quoted observation from the work of Gerrit Berkouwer: ‘Professor Berkouwer was keenly aware of that when in his final, large theological autobiography he observed that Bavinck was particularly susceptible to being “annexed” by contemporary devotees for their own purposes. Berkouwer judges that it is difficult to overcome this danger “because Bavinck’s theology contains so many irreconcilable themes in tension”.’15 As such, one is left with the ‘orthodox’ Bavinck and the ‘modernist’ Bavinck. The former is the son of the Secession and bulwark of theological conservatism; the latter is the bold theological freethinker and darling of those who align themselves against Old Princeton. To nuance Bolt’s position somewhat, he regards this caricature as exaggerated and claims that the ‘good, progressive modernist Bavinck’ was ‘invented by Valentijn Hepp; celebrated by G.C. Berkouwer and his students; and, finally, shamelessly 12\n\nFor ‘Bavinck against Warfield’, see Donald McKim and Jack Rogers, The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1979); and Andrew T.B.

Yet, there is plenty of evidence to warrant talking about a duality in Bavinck, and we cannot understand the developments in twentieth-century Dutch Reformed theology apart from the conflicting appeals made to these two sides. Let me state it more modestly and moderately: The two sides of Herman Bavinck the theologian reflect a pull between the academic theologian (wetenschappelijke theoloog) and the churchly dogmatician (kerkelijke dogmaticus).18 Thus, while Bolt is sensitive to speak of ‘duality’ rather than ‘bipolarity’, he nonetheless regards the caricature as containing a grain of truth. Although Bolt finds the practice of setting Bavinck against himself somewhat distasteful, the alleged existence of this grain of truth renders this distaste a personal preference rather than a point in principle. It is inconsistent to accept the fundamental basis of the ‘two Bavincks’ hypothesis (whether that be labelled as duality or bipolarity) while denying the subsequent right to pit one Bavinck against the other. Indeed, Yarnell’s portrait of the bipolar Bavinck makes heavy use of Bolt’s statement and, ignoring Bolt’s plea for restraint from exaggerated caricatures, proceeds to write about Bavinck in the unfortunate language of ‘schizophrenia’.19 Although Veenhof, Vroom and Bolt accept the basic core of this portrait (albeit with differing levels of reluctance), none formally make the explicit claim that Bavinck was thus an inherently inconsistent figure. Evidently, such a claim is central to Yarnell’s presentation of Bavinck. However, Yarnell is by no means the only person to push the ‘two Bavincks’ model to this extent. 16\n\nBolt, ‘Grand Rapids between Kampen and Amsterdam: Herman Bavinck’s influence and reception in North America’, 266.

He writes: ‘Though a complete account is more complex, a good general argument can be made, I believe, that his defense of the natural law and two kingdoms categories belongs to the orthodox Bavinck and his advocacy of themes such as grace restoring nature and the kingdom as leaven belongs to the modern Bavinck.’21 VanDrunen’s paper perhaps represents the apex of this ‘annexation’: one is now encouraged not simply to discover ‘which Bavinck wrote which section’ (à la Heideman), but instead to set Bavinck against himself (or rather, to play the ‘orthodox’ Bavinck against his ‘modernist’ alter ego). In following Vroom’s critique, VanDrunen numbers himself among the ‘orthodox’ Bavinck-students, choosing ‘one line’ of Bavinck’s thinking while rejecting the other. Although he provides perhaps the most extreme recent example of this reliance on the ‘two Bavincks’ model, the bulk of recent Bavinck scholarship (à la Yarnell) on the doctrine of Scripture operates on the same assumption of Bavinck’s basic, perpetual crisis of theological identity.\n\nIV. The General Affects the Particular Left unchecked, the ‘two Bavincks’ model produces a type of theological apartheid within Bavinck studies, the effect of which is that those who appreciate his work must interpret every area of his theology as belonging to one of his alter egos. To use VanDrunen’s reading, it seems that Bavinck’s ‘two kingdoms’ theology has no real import for the ‘modernist’ Bavinck reader. The conviction that one cannot read Bavinck holistically has become deeply entrenched. It seems hard to deny that the community busy with the interpretation of his work has segregated his thought and basic theological identity. The same is true, as will be demonstrated, regarding Veenhof’s reading of Bavinck’s organic motif via the ‘two Bavincks’ hermeneutical lens: the motif, one is led to assume, belongs exclusively to Bavinck’s ‘modern’ disciples. 20\n\nDavid VanDrunen, ‘The Kingship of Christ Is Twofold: Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms in the Thought of Herman Bavinck’, Calvin Theological Journal (April 2010), No. 45, Vol. 1, 162. 21 David VanDrunen, ‘The Kingship of Christ Is Twofold: Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms in the Thought of Herman Bavinck’, 162, footnote 75.\n\nTrinity and Organism.indb 33\n\n3/21/2012 7:05:05 PM\n\nTrinity and Organism\n\n34\n\nThis policy of segregation has had a most undesirable, paralysing effect on the field of Bavinck studies. Whenever one strain of Bavinck devotees finds a section in his work which contradicts their basic working assumptions (and which would therefore challenge their presentation of him), it can be conveniently dismissed as the writings of the ‘other Bavinck’. As it presents the Bavinck reader with the need to allocate each of his thoughts, sentences, paragraphs and notions to one of the two Bavincks, this hermeneutical partisanship considerably hinders the constructive reading of his work. In short, it requires that one read him with the unfailing presupposition that these ideas can form no harmonious unity. Such a presupposition will markedly affect the reading which will follow. Its presuppositions pressure the reader to ‘discover’ the hallmarks of internal division throughout Bavinck’s work.\n\nV. The ‘Two Bavincks’ Model and the Organic Motif As has already been acknowledged, the ‘two poles’ model is central to Veenhof’s reading of Bavinck.22 That Veenhof interprets Bavinck through this lens has a considerable impact on his understanding of the organic motif’s place in Bavinck’s theology. Noting that in Veenhof’s account, the organic motif comes to Bavinck from Hegel, Schelling, the History of Religions School and the Dutch Ethical theologians,23 one is left to conclude that the organic motif therefore belongs to ‘one Bavinck’ rather than the other: the ‘modernist’ Bavinck. Bavinck has organic thoughts, one is led to believe, only in his ‘modernist’ moments. The motif occurs when Bavinck’s Hegelian, Leiden-influenced side surfaces. Consequently, the organic motif is the property of one particular strand of Bavinck’s followers. It thus becomes an aspect of Bavinck’s internal division, rather than the primary agent of synthesis in his worldview. As will be demonstrated in t"
