        "text": "By Steve Bishop\n\nAlmost all of Kuyper’s writings were in Dutch. Until the Abraham Kuyper Translation Project was launched in 2011 only a small selection of Kuyper’s works was available in English. Kuyper has had many translators over the years. These are often the unsung heroes of the Kuyperian tradition. This is an attempt to highlight some of the key translators.[1]\n\nEncyclopedia of Sacred Theology\n\nOne of Kuyper’s first major works to be translated into English was the Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology. Geerhardus Vos (1862-1949) of Princeton Theological Seminary and a colleague of B. B. Warfield, was originally to be the translator of Kuyper’s Encyclopedia of Sacred Theology. Vos worked too slowly for Kuyper’s and the publisher’s needs. J. H. De Vries took over even though Vos had doubts about De Vries’s lack of academic training. (Harinck, 2011). Vos thus suggested the Hebrew scholar Abel Henry Huizinga and at the time a minister at the Reformed Church, New Paltz. Huizinga’s work was halted by his appointment as professor of Old Testament Literature and Exegesis, at McCormick Theological Seminary, Chicago. Another translator was used, Jacob Poppen (1858–1920). Poppen was appointed professor at Gakuin Seminary in Tokyo and so also had to be relieved of translation duties! However, it was De Vries who went on to complete the published translation – although by this time to book was abridged for the US market.\n\nGeerhardus Vos also translated “Calvinism and confessional revision” for publication in The Presbyterian and Reformed Review in 1891.\n\nLectures on Calvinism is perhaps the best known of Kuyper’s work. It was first published in English shortly after Kuyper gave the lectures. It is still in print. The translation history is something of a puzzle.\n\nAccording to a note written by Prof. B.B. Warfield (1851–1921) see above, the translators of the lectures were:\n\nRevd J. H. De Vries (see 1892.05) (lectures 1 and 5)\n\nDr A. H. Huizinga (see 1898.12), (Lecture 2)\n\nDr Henry E. Dosker, (Lecture 3)\n\nDr N. M. Steffens (see 1903.16), (Lecture 4)\n\nGeerhardus Vos (see 1891.07) (Lecture 6)\n\nThere is some dispute over the accuracy of Warfield’s note.[2] It seems Kuyper reworked the translations with the help of Ethel Ashton. Ashton had been employed to teach Kuyper’s children English conversation.\n\nRev. J. Hendrik De Vries (1859–1939), was for many years Kuyper’s “authorized translator”. De Vries was born in Amsterdam, graduated from Rutgers College and New Brunswick Theological Seminary, and held pastorates in American Presbyterian and Protestant Episcopal churches including the Second Presbyterian Church in Princeton, New Jersey. Calvinism and Art (1892) was the first translation by De Vries. He subsequently translated the majority of Kuyper’s works in English until De Vries’s death in 1939.\n\nHenri De Vries (1847–1932) – the brother of John. A pastor of the Reformed Church in Peekskill, New York. He translated The Work of the Holy Spirit. He also wrote a series of devotional studies. He is not to be confused with the Dutch actor of the same name (1864-1949).\n\nHenry Zylstra (1909-1956) – translated Women of the Old Testament (1933), Women of the New Testament (1934), and The Implications of Public Confession (1934). Women of the Old Testament was the first book published by Zondervan. He was paid $50 for the translation rights. Some of the articles had been previously translated by J. H. de Vries for the Christian Intelligencer magazine during the period 1901-1908.\n\nJames Bratt (editor) Abraham Kuyper A Centennial Reader, published to mark the centennial of Kuyper’s Stone Lectures, contained several short articles by Kuyper. The translators included:\n\nJohn Vriend (1925-2002) (Uniformity, Conservation and orthodoxy, It shall not be so among you, Perfectionism, Common grace, Maranatha, Our instinctive life) Vriend was one of the founders of the Dutch Translation Society. He was also the translator of Bavinck’s Reformed Dogmatics.\n\nReinder Bruinsma (Confidentiality, Manual labor). Bruinsma is a Seventh Day Adventist minister.\n\nJ. H. De Vries (Modernism, Calvinism: source and stronghold, Blurring of the boundaries).\n\nAlfred E. Fletcher (1841-1915) (South-African Crisis)\n\nGeorge Kamp (1904-1978) (Evolution, Sphere Sovereignty). Kamp served after he retired from Standard Oil as a statistician for Calvin College. (Gordon Spykman (1923-1996) and Harry der Nederlander (1944-2008), a former editor of Christian Courier, had also translated Sphere Sovereignty – as had Wayne Kobes of Dordt College).\n\nHans van de Hel (Common grace in science).\n\nHerman Hanko translated and published in the PRC’s The Standard Bearer extracts from A pamphlet concerning the reformation of the church. Hanko was a professor of church history and New Testament at the Protestant Reformed Seminary in Grandville, Michigan (1965-2001).\n\nMarvin Kamps was the translator of Particular Grace. He is also the author of 1834: Hendrik de Cock’s Return to the True Church. He was a minister in the Protestant Reformed Church including the Southwest Protestant Reformed Church, Grandville from 1985-1993.\n\nPieter C. Tuit, a professor of missiology at Calvin Theological Seminary (2001-2009) translated “Missions according to Scripture” in Calvin Theological Journal (2003).\n\nRevd G. M. van Pernis (1889–1968) translated selected parts of Kuyper’s E voto Dordraceno.\n\nRevd Richard Stienstra a minister of several churches in North America translated Kuyper’s Angels: God’s Ministering Spirits.\n\nJan Boer – for many years Boer was a Christian Reformed Church missionary in Nigeria.

She was the daughter of Klaas Schoolland (1851-1938), a professor at what is now Calvin College. She wrote A Godly Heritage, a biography of her father as well as several children’s stories. She was an elementary school teacher.\n\nJames A.
