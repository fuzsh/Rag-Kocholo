        "text": "Theological movement\n\nThis article is about the Dutch Calvinist movement. For the movement that emerged in the late-20th-century United States, see New Calvinism.\n\nNeo-Calvinism, a form of Dutch Calvinism, is a theological movement initiated by the theologian and former Dutch prime minister Abraham Kuyper in the first years of the twentieth century. James Bratt has identified a number of different types of Dutch Calvinism: The Seceders, split into the Reformed Church \"West\" and the Confessionalists; the neo-Calvinists; and the Positives and the Antithetical Calvinists. The Seceders were largely infralapsarian and the neo-Calvinists usually supralapsarian.[page needed]\n\nKuyper wanted to awaken the church from what he viewed as its pietistic slumber. He declared:\n\nNo single piece of our mental world is to be sealed off from the rest and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'[page needed][3]\n\nThis refrain has become something of a rallying call for neo-Calvinists.\n\nKey Theological Points\n\n[edit]\n\nPart of a series onReformed Christianity\n\nChristianity • Protestantism\n\nReformed Christianity portal\n\nSource:[4][self-published source]\n\nJesus is Lord over all of creation. Jesus’ Lordship extends through every area and aspect of life – it is not restricted to the sphere of church or of personal piety.\n\nThe idea that all of life is to be redeemed. The work of Jesus on the cross extends over all of life – no area is exempt from its impact. All knowledge is affected by the true knowledge of God through redemption in Christ.\n\nCultural Mandate. Genesis 1:26–28 has been described as a cultural mandate. It is the mandate to cultivate and develop the creation. There is a historical development and cultural unfolding. Some neo-Calvinists hold that the Cultural Mandate is as important as the Great Commission.\n\nCreation, fall and redemption. God's good creation has been disrupted by the fall. Redemption is a restoration of creation.[8]\n\nSphere sovereignty (Soevereiniteit in eigen kring). Each sphere (or sector) of life has its own distinct responsibilities and authority as designed by God – for instance, communities dedicated to worship, civil justice, agriculture, family, etc. – and no one area of life is sovereign over another. Hence, neither faith-institutions nor an institution of civil justice (that is, the state) should seek totalitarian control or any regulation of human activity outside their limited competence.\n\nA rejection of dualism. Dualisms are (purportedly false) bifurcations, dichotomies, contrasts, or oppositions, such as the dualism between nature and grace that [allegedly] dominated much of Scholasticism. In the neo-Calvinist view, nature is the God-created and sustained cosmic order, not a \"non-supernatural\" category, and grace is God's means of renewing the cosmic order, it is not something \"non-creational\" added onto nature (albeit eschatological in consummated glorification of bodily resurrection to eternal life and cosmic transformation of the new heavens and earth).\n\nStructure and direction. Structure denotes created laws and norms for (other) created things. Direction denotes relative deviation or conformity to norms; primarily regarding the central orientation of the human heart toward or away from God in Christ.\n\nCommon grace. God providentially sustains the created order, restraining of possible evils and giving non-salvific good gifts to all humanity despite their fall into sin, God's curse, and his eventual condemnation of the unredeemed.\n\nPresuppositional apologetics. The only framework in which any fact about the world is intelligible is the Christian worldview in general, and the theologically Reformed worldview in particular. The principles of logic and the use of reason assume the existence of God. Presuppositionalism is a reductio ad absurdum approach to Christian apologetics, in that it argues that all non-Christian worldviews are internally inconsistent.\n\nThe antithesis. There is a struggle in history and within every person – between submission to and rebellion against God; between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness; between the age to come (already inaugurated in Christ) and this present evil age (of sin).\n\nWorld views. Neo-Calvinists reject the notion that theoretical thought can be religiously neutral. All thinking and practice is shaped by world views and religious ground motives. For the neo-Calvinist, life in all its aspects can be shaped by a distinctively Christian world view.\n\nThe role of law. For neo-Calvinists, \"Law\" is more than the Mosaic Decalogue, or even the entire abiding moral will of God. Law is, rather, the order for creation (or creation ordinances) established by God and includes a variety of types of cultural norms including physiological, psychological, logical, historical, linguistic, social, economic, aesthetic, juridical, and faith norms.\n\nKey individuals associated with neo-Calvinism\n\n[edit]\n\nGuillaume Groen van Prinsterer\n\nAbraham Kuyper\n\nHerman Bavinck\n\nKlaas Schilder\n\nHerman Dooyeweerd\n\nD.
