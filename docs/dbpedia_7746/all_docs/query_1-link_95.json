        "text": "\"Florida's public university system announced that it would accept results from the Classic Learning Test (CLT) for students applying to places like the University of Florida or Florida State University. Incoming freshmen can submit their CLT scores instead of the more traditional SAT or ACT tests,\" Mehta explains. He writes, \"The problem with the CLT is that there's very little evidence that it's a good indicator of college preparedness. The test, which launched in 2015, has only been taken by about 21,000 students total. By comparison, 1.7 million students took the SAT and 1.3 million took the ACT in 2022 alone. Both of those latter tests are constantly revised and updated. There's no similar track record for the CLT. Furthermore, 85% of the students who've taken the CLT are white and 99% of test-takers attend private schools and charter schools or are home-schooled. The 'C' may as well stand for 'Christian.'\" Mehta explains that \"conservatives\" are \"eager to push the CLT as a valid alternative to the ACT and SAT despite that lack of information\" because \"the Republican base loves it.\" GOP: let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre educating our kids while feeding them conservative conspiracies. That will help prepare them for the jobs of the future. Right?\n\nGen Z, the most educated generation in U.S. history, has found itself grappling with complex issues and ideologies. The question of how they became sympathetic to Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, is multifaceted. Here are some factors that might shed light on this phenomenon: Educational Attainment: Millennials and Gen Z are on track to become the most educated generations in American history. Their pursuit of higher education has been driven by the demands of a knowledge-based economy. However, education alone does not guarantee alignment with specific political views. Social and Political Climate: The current socio-political climate plays a significant role. Gen Z has grown up in an era of rapid information dissemination, social media, and global connectivity. They are exposed to diverse perspectives, including those related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Media and Information Sources: The availability of information online allows Gen Z to access a wide range of viewpoints. Some media outlets may present narratives that resonate with their sense of justice and empathy. Exposure to different narratives can shape their opinions. Social Justice Movements: Gen Z is passionate about social justice and activism. They have witnessed movements like Black Lives Matter and climate activism. These experiences may influence their views on global issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Campus Culture: College campuses often foster discussions on social justice, human rights, and global affairs. Exposure to diverse perspectives and academic discourse can lead to nuanced opinions. Wokery and Ideological Shifts: The rise of ‚Äúwokery‚Äù or extreme political correctness has influenced campus culture. It emphasizes identity politics, intersectionality, and solidarity with marginalized groups. Some argue that this ideological shift has led to sympathy for Hamas as an oppressed group. Critical Thinking and Debate: While education encourages critical thinking, it also exposes students to various ideologies. Some Gen Z individuals may engage in rigorous debates and explore unconventional viewpoints, including those sympathetic to Hamas. In summary, Gen Z‚Äôs education, exposure to diverse information, and engagement with social justice issues contribute to their evolving perspectives. The question of sympathy toward Hamas is complex and cannot be attributed to education alone. Olivia Reingold‚Äôs exploration in The Free Press may shed further light on this intriguing phenomenon."
