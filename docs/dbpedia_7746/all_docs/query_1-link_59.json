        "text": "“God created hand, head, and heart, the hand for the deed, the head for the world, the heart for mysticism. King in deed, prophet in profession, and priest in heart, shall man in his threefold office stand before God.” ~Abraham Kuyper\n\nLook Inside the Book\n\nAlthough Abraham Kuyper was the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and a great educator, his true legacy is his exhortation to pietistic and passive Christians. He advocated for the submission of all things—life, art, and politics—to the Lord Jesus Christ. Kuyper reminded the Church that there is no square inch over which Christ does not cry, “Mine!” In this series of lectures given at Princeton Theological Seminary, he explains how Christianity, and particularly Calvinism, is a comprehensive worldview that explains how we should approach religion, politics, science, art, and the future of the modern world.\n\n“Abraham Kuyper believed that everything began with the Triune God, and everything—body, mind, soul, and strength—needed to be rooted in this commitment to the Triune God. Likewise, if Calvinism is to triumph in the religious realm, the political sphere, the science laboratory, the marketplace of ideas, and the arts, then it must be unashamedly Christian from its first thought to its last.” ~From Uriesou Brito’s Introduction\n\n—\n\nTHE CHRISTIAN HERITAGE SERIES: The authors in the Christian Heritage Series paid a high price for the words you see before you. Not all paid with blood, but each spent his life fighting for the truth. This faithful sacrifice has become a rich inheritance for the Church in our day, even though it is often neglected. The Christian Heritage Series aims to put these important theological classics on every Christian’s bookshelf in colorful, well-crafted, and affordable volumes, with introductions written by those that love the books and their heritage.\n\nAUTHOR: Abraham Kuyper\n\nINTRODUCTION: Uriesou Brtio\n\nPAGE COUNT: 242 pages\n\nSIZE: 5.5x8.5\"\n\nBINDING: Paperback\n\nISBN 10: 1954887310\n\nISBN-13: 9781954887312\n\nPUB.
