        "text": "How can the US Congress prevent the establishment of religion while also insuring the free exercise of reli­gion? Are concepts such as justice and rights inherently religious? (The American Declaration of Independence states that rights come from the Cre­ator.) How can we fully discuss is­sues such as prayer in public schools, abortion and civil rights without ref­erence to religion? Political questions of this sort are of much greater im­portance to our society in the long run than a middle class tax cut. But where do we go for help in thinking through such questions?\n\nOne source of help can be found in that profound Dutchman, Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920). Kuyper was one of the most remarkable Reformed men of the modern era. He was both a powerful thinker and an effective activist. He was a minister and churchman, a professor and theolo­gian, a writer and newspaper editor, a politician and statesman. In the po­litical arena he reorganized the Anti-Revolutionary Party and made it a potent force in national politics in the Netherlands. He also founded a daily newspaper, De Standaard, to give expression to his political views. He served in parliament and as prime minister (1901-1905).\n\nKuyper expressed his political ideas in numerous writings during his lifetime. The most accessible of Kuyper's work for the English reader is the famous Stone Lectures that Kuyper delivered at Princeton University in 1898. In those six lectures Kuyper sought to crystallize his thought on a variety of topics: \"Calvinism a Life-system,\" \"Calvinism and Religion,\" \"Calvinism and Science,\" \"Calvinism and Art,\" \"Calvinism and the Future,\" and of special interest for our purposes, \"Calvinism and Politics.\"\n\nThe lecture on politics not only demonstrated Kuyper's knowledge of traditional Calvinist reflection on the subject, but also his knowledge of re­cent history and the changing modern world that the Calvinist con­fronted in the late nineteenth century. He spoke of \"the battle of the ages between Authority and Liberty\"1 as a driving force of political history in our fallen world. In paradise there was a perfect balance between author­ity and liberty. But in the fallen world authority tends to tyranny and liberty to license. This basic battle, Kuyper ar­gued, manifests itself in different forms in different periods of history.\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nIn the Middle Ages the church sought to direct the state in the bal­ance of authority and liberty, but that in itself was a form of tyranny ex­pressed in institutions like the Inqui­sition. In the modern world the church was replaced either by the state or by popular sovereignty as the source of justice and of the appropriate balance between authority and liberty. But Kuyper argued that these modern con­ceptions of sovereignty were as faulty as the medieval. Popular sovereignty, as expressed in the French Revolu­tion, led to chaotic liberty and the Terror. State sovereignty, as was emerging in German political think­ing, led to oppressive authority. Both popular sovereignty and state sovereignty tended to tyranny.\n\nKuyper insisted that the only proper way to prevent tyranny of one kind or another was to acknowledge that authority and liberty were based in God's sovereignty. He suggested three theses as the summary of his political faith:\n\nGod only - and never any crea­ture - is possessed of sovereign rights, in the destiny of nations, because God alone created them, maintains them by His Almighty power, and rules them by His or­dinances.\n\nSin has, in the realm of politics, broken down the di­rect government of God, that therefore the exercise of author­ity, for the purpose of govern­ment, has subsequently been in­vested in men, as a mechanical remedy.\n\nIn whatever form this authority may reveal itself, man never possesses power over his fellow-man in any other way than by an authority which de­scends upon him from the maj­esty of God.2\n\nFor Kuyper the only way to guar­antee and temper both authority and liberty was by recognizing that both derive from God.\n\nKuyper offered as historic examples the Dutch, English and American revolutions which - based on the sov­ereignty of God - both recognized le­gitimate authority and increased liberty. He contrasted them with the French Revolution - based on popu­lar sovereignty - which led to greater tyranny. Had he lived longer, he might have used Nazi Germany as an example of the result of unlimited confidence in the sovereignty of the state.\n\nProblems-Solution\n\nIn founding his political thinking on the sovereignty of God, Kuyper sought to avoid two recurring histori­cal problems: first, the tendency of the state to try to dominate all of life, and second, the tendency of the church to try to dominate the state.\n\nThe first problem Kuyper solved with his idea of sphere sovereignty. Human life is lived in various spheres such as family, business, science and others. Each of these spheres has a character derived from God and re­sponsibility directly to God. Kuyper saw these spheres arising \"organi­cally\" (we might say naturally) out of human life. He resisted the notion that the state with its \"mechanical\" (we might say artificial) power should seek to dominate each of these spheres. The spheres should develop according to their innate, God-derived principles, not as servants of the state.\n\nThe clearest example of this con­cept of sphere sovereignty in Kuyper's political life was the issue of the edu­cation of children. Liberal politicians in Kuyper's day believed that educa­tion was the work of the state. The state should decide the values and content communicated in the schools. Kuyper responded by insisting that God had given children to parents and that parents had the responsibil­ity to raise and educate their children. The basic character of education was a matter that parents must decide for their children. The state had an inter­est in seeing to it that children were educated, but parents needed to choose the kind of school that their children would attend. Kuyper suc­ceeded in getting tax support for all schools to aid parents in making that choice.\n\nAs the issue of education shows, the state does have responsibilities in relation to other spheres of life. Kuyper summarized his position:\n\n(The State) Possesses the Three-Fold Right and Duty:\n\nWhenever different spheres clash, to compel mutual regard for the boundary- lines of each;\n\nTo defend individuals and the weak ones, in those spheres, against the abuse of power of the rest; and\n\nTo coerce all together to bear personal and financial burdens for the maintenance of the natural unity of the StatePPP.3\n\nBut the state must not move beyond these limits. When the state recog­nizes these limits it properly asserts its own God-given authority and the God-given liberty of society to develop apart from state domination.\n\nThe second problem Kuyper ad­dressed was the problem of church domination of the state. Does the idea of state recognition of divine sover­eignty imply subservience of the state to the church? Kuyper insisted that it did not. He was no theocrat. \"A the­ocracy was only found in Israel, be­cause in Israel, God intervened im­mediately.\"4\n\nHe taught that the state as a sphere was itself directly responsible to God. The church must be free to be the church and the state must be free to be the state. As the church is not com­petent to decide many political mat­ters, so the state is not competent to decide which is the true church. In the state the sovereignty of God is not expressed by establishing one true church, but in God's Word ruling \"through the conscience of the per­sons invested with authority.\"5\n\nKuyper did believe that God should be formally recognized as sovereign in the state. He said of the magis­trates:\n\nThey have to recognize God as Supreme Ruler, from Whom they derive their power. They have to serve God, by ruling the people according to His ordinances. They have to restrain blasphemy, where it directly assumes the character of an affront to the Divine Maj­esty. And God's supremacy is to be recognized by confessing His name in the Constitution as the Source of all political power, by maintaining the Sabbath, by pro­claiming days of prayer and thanksgiving, and by invoking His Divine blessing ... the fact of blas­phemy is only then to be deemed established, when the intention is apparent contumaciously to af­front this majesty of God as Su­preme Ruler of the State.6\n\nAt this point Kuyper's American reader may pause and wonder if he is as modern as we first thought. And indeed some of the nineteenth cen­tury character of his reflections can be seen at this point. Kuyper assumed that he was speaking in a context where Christianity was dominant, and the pressing ecclesiastical ques­tion was whether one denomination would dominate others. He spoke in an American context where many political documents recognized the supremacy of God, where the Sab­bath was protected by law and where the government did call people to prayer regularly.\n\nKuyper rightly saw the value of vari­ous churches' freely and by spiritual means presenting their truth claims to society. He stated: \"The churches flourish most richly when the govern­ment allows them to live from their own strength on the voluntary principle.\"7\n\nContemporary Applications\n\nKuyper also recognized that poli­tics must be related to historical cir­cumstances in the efforts to create a just society.8 He was no naive uto­pian or abstract theorist. Although he did not anticipate the much greater religious and cultural diversity of America today, he would have seen the challenge as an intriguing one. While it is not clear how he would have worked out the details, it is clear that he would still have insisted that the sovereignty of God ought to be recognized in the state and that the state should not coerce citizens in matters of religious conviction and affiliation. Balancing these two ideals is not easy as recent American expe­rience with school prayer, abortion, civil rights and other issues shows. But secularist efforts to remove God from the public arena has already demonstrated the tyrannical tendency that Kuyper feared. (For an interest­ing and moderate discussion of some of these issues, see Stephen L. Carter, The Culture of Disbelief New York, 1993.)\n\nKuyper would have read with un­derstanding and general approval the amazing essay that appeared recently in Time magazine calling for a resto­ration of prayer in the public schools. Richard Brookhiser wrote his essay entitled \"Let Us Pray\"9. to argue that a sensible reading of American his­tory points to the propriety of restor­ing prayer to the schools. He noted that the day after the House of Repre­sentatives passed the First Amend­ment to the US Constitution, the House officially called for a day of thanksgiving and prayer in the land. Brookhiser also offered a more theo­retical argument in combination with the historical one:\n\nMen have imagined other sources for their rights besides the Al­mighty. The Declaration men­tions \"the Laws of Nature.\" But it immediately adds, \"...and of Nature's God.\" Wisely so. The past 200 years have shown that nature is a distressingly malleable concept. It is the philosopher's parlor trick to collapse it into his­tory (nature in time) or will (na­ture in us). When such philoso­phies seeped into politics they spawned communism and Na­zism. It is also true that God - and various gods - has covered a mul­titude of political sins over the millennia. But in the modern world, rights fare best when they are de­rived from a Source men fear to tamper with.\n\nKuyper in a much fuller way antici­pated these sentiments.\n\nAbraham Kuyper remains for us as Reformed Christians a fascinating political analyst for several reasons. The issues he examined are still very much with us. He saw the big picture in the development of western civili­zation in a very helpful way. His com­mitment to liberty of conscience and multiformity while expressed in a rather Romantic, nineteenth-century way is still valuable today. But most importantly his determination to rec­ognize God as the source of all true authority and all real liberty is as true and necessary today as ever."
