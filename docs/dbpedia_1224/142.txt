HISTORY

The company was established in 1892 by a group of British businessmen with an investment of â‚¹295. Initially, biscuits were manufactured in a small house in central Kolkata.

These were meant for officers of the British Raj and their families, people used to the exacting standards of English tea-time snacking.

The company initially manufactured only biscuits.

Biscuits were in high demand during World War II, which gave a boost to the company's sales. The government of British India needed a supply of specially made biscuits for its soldiers. The Britannia Biscuit Company rose to the challenge. The deal ran into several years, and the company sometimes devoted 95 per cent of its capacity to produce biscuits for the armed forces.

With the rise of the mutiny by Indians as they fought for independence against the British, the English group that founded the company, decided to sell it to sell it to an Indian, so the Gupta Brothers bought it, the main among them being,

Nalin Chandragupta.

To increase business, the brothers came in partnership with English businessman CH Holmes in 1918. That's when they opened another branch of Britannia in Bombay, resulting in 2 branches: in Calcutta and in Bombay.
