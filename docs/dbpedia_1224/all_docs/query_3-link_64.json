        "text": "Christo Sabu, Symbiosis Law School Hyderabad\n\nIntroduction\n\nBritannia Industries is one of the most trusted food brands, with a legacy of more than 100 years. With an average annual turnover of ₹ 9000 crores, it is one of the largest biscuit manufacturing companies in India.[1] Britannia Industries Ltd. acquired the following trademark on 11th September, 2020 under Class 30 of the Trademark Rules 2017 for its product ‘Nutri Choice Digestive’ biscuit:\n\nClass 30 under trademark classification deals with:\n\nBeverages with coffee, cocoa, chocolate, or tea base;\n\nCereals prepared for human consumption (for example, oat flakes and those made of other cereals).\n\nThe plaintiff had alleged that Defendant M/s ITC Ltd. was manufacturing and selling their relatively newer product in the biscuit industry, ‘Sunfeast Farmlite 5-Seed Digestive’ biscuits in a packaging that was deceptively identical to the packaging being used by the Plaintiff to sell its ‘Nutri Choice Digestive’ biscuits. Thus, the plaintiff brought an action for passing off and infringement and also sought an interim injunction to prevent ITC Ltd. from manufacturing or selling biscuits in the disputed packaging.[4] The product in question is depicted as below:\n\nThe plaintiff’s trademark was registered on 11th September, 2020, but it had been in use ever since 2014 for its digestive biscuits. The defendants, on the other hand, don’t have a registered trademark. The defendants’ ‘SUNFEAST FARMLITE’ and ‘5-SEED DIGESTIVE’ biscuits were launched, under the impugned pack on 28th September, 2020.[7]\n\nCASE ANALYSIS\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that by using an identical packaging, the defendants had infringed their registered trademark. It was also alleged that by such misrepresentation the defendant was receiving an undue advantage in the market. Therefore, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction restraining the defendants from using the impugned packaging for manufacturing and selling their product.\n\nOn 16th December 2020, the court issued a summons and a notice in the present suit. The court thereby recorded the submission of the learned Counsel for Defendant that the impugned packaging would not be released by the defendants in the market. However, the manufacturing of its product would continue as usual and the order wouldn’t affect the existing packages in the market.\n\nThe court further relied on the judgments in FDC Ltd. v. Faraway Foods Pvt. Ltd.[8] and Natures Essence Pvt. Ltd. v. Protogreen Retail Solutions Pvt. Ltd.[9] to understand the legal aspects and for culling out the principles that may determine the actions for passing off and infringement in this case.\n\nThe plaintiff argued that the overall trade dress, layout, color pattern, and arrangement of the impugned packaging were deceptively identical to that of the plaintiff. Some of the similarities between the packings highlighted were as follows:\n\nColor Pattern: Use of Yellow and Red colors towards the left and right sides of the packing respectively. Similarly, orange color has been used at the intersection of red and yellow colors on the pack.\n\nGraphics: Use of a cookie image on the right side of the packing. Similarly, towards the bottom of the pack, two sheaves of wheat and scattered grains of wheat have been shown.\n\nFont and Style: Use of similar font and style to highlight the brand name on the packaging. That is, depicting the words ‘5-Seed Digestive’ in the defendants’ pack, on a similar white background as in the case of the words ‘Nutri Choice’ in the plaintiff’s pack. Moreover, the word ‘digestive’ has been embossed in red lettering on the impugned packing as well.[10]\n\nThe plaintiff also contended that the ingredients of the biscuits are immaterial since both the products are digestive biscuits. Hence, it was pointed out that the defendants had copied essential elements of the plaintiff’s trademark without their consent or any valid reason. Furthermore, emphasis was placed on the judgment given in the case of Parle Products Ltd. v. J.P. & Co.[11], where it was held that in order to ascertain whether two marks are deceptively similar to one another or not, the comprehensive and significant features should be taken into consideration. If the impugned mark is found to bear an overall similarity to the registered mark which may tend to mislead a person, making him chose the other if offered to him even if he usually deals with the one with a registered mark, then the marks should be viewed as deceptively similar and can, therefore, be easily mistaken for the other.\n\nThe defendants, on the other hand, laid much emphasis on the differences between the two packings that forestall any possibility of confusion. The saffron color present on the defendants’ packing was not there on the plaintiff’s pack. The plaintiff had the brand name, ‘NUTRI CHOICE’ embossed on the pack in large green letters, whereas the defendants’ package displayed the name, ‘FARMLITE’ in brown letters. Towards the center of the defendants’ pack, there was a downward flowing strip that contains the picture of the defendants’ biscuits. It also showcased in detail, the pictures and names of all the seeds, that were used in the preparation of their product. Most importantly, the brand name of the defendants’ product, ‘SUNFEAST FARMLITE DIGESTIVE’ was predominantly highlighted on the impugned pack. All these attributes comprehensively made the defendant’s packing dissimilar to that of the plaintiff. Moreover, the primary color used in the defendants’ pack was yellow, whereas red is the predominant color on the plaintiff’s pack.\n\nOther similarities included the brand name of the respective sides inscribed on the face of the biscuit. The court was of the opinion that this was a general practice followed by many, especially in the Indian market. Graphic representation of wheat on the packaging is another such practice. Even though certain words like ‘High-Fibre’ were common on both the packs, the font style and color pattern that had been used to represent the same were quite different from that used by the plaintiff.\n\nBased on the pleadings and arguments of both parties, the court held that consumers who prefer to purchase a certain product would normally recollect the brand name and that it is highly improbable that they would get confused between two products having different brand names. Also, in this case, emphasis was placed on the class of customers that would buy the product. There are no other biscuit manufacturers that produce biscuits that contain all 5 seeds; flax seeds, chia seeds, watermelon seeds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds which are to be found in the defendant’s biscuits. Therefore, an approach that focuses on similarities, rather than differences between the marks was adopted by the court. Justifying the same, it was held that a rational human mind has not been conditioned to consider only similarities and neglect the differences. Since the points of difference exceeded and outweighed that of similarities, the court passed a judgment in favor of the defendants. Thus, even though there were similarities, beyond reasonable doubt existing between the two packs, they were simply not enough to misguide the consumers or create confusion in customers’ minds. Hence, the allegation of replication of vital features and of the prospect of confusion or deception on that score, would not sustain. The court was also of the opinion that a deliberate attempt of copying, doesn’t in itself constitute to be passing off or infringement. Such imitations must hold the potential to deceive or create confusion in customers’ minds.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn a passing-off case, it is an absolute mandate that the goodwill of a brand is sought to be misappropriated or threatened. However, in this case, the plaintiff failed to prove that the essential features of the pack, such as the red-yellow color pattern was unique to its product, ‘Nutri Choice’ biscuits. The Delhi High Court laid much emphasis on the points of differences, rather than similarities between the registered mark and the impugned pack. This has quite been an unusual approach in a case for passing off or interim injunction. In a market of fierce competition, this judgment may not sound too pleasing as it opens escape routes for those indulged in conscious attempts of copying. Irrespective of the similarities, if the impugned pack displays stark differences, including a different brand name, that would be just enough to get away with. The court had also opined that if the impugned pack was deceptively similar, any customer of average intelligence and imperfect recollection would get confused between the rival products. This judgment is critical since an unusual approach of distinctive features was adopted instead of the preferred test of similarities. The reasoning in this judgment may further open the floodgates to a host of inconsistent lawsuits hereafter.\n\nReferences\n\nKailasam, V. K. (1999). S. 27.
