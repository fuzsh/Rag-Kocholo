        "text": "Key Insights\n\nBritannia Industries' significant public companies ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public\n\nThe Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation, Limited owns 51% of the company\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Britannia Industries Limited ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is public companies. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nIndividual investors, on the other hand, account for 25% of the company's stockholders.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Britannia Industries.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Britannia Industries?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nWe can see that Britannia Industries does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Britannia Industries' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Britannia Industries. The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation, Limited is currently the company's largest shareholder with 51% of shares outstanding. With such a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control of the future of the company. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 5.4% and 2.2% of the stock.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Britannia Industries\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Britannia Industries Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own â‚¹109m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Britannia Industries. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nIt appears to us that public companies own 51% of Britannia Industries. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Britannia Industries better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Britannia Industries has we think you should be aware of.\n\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
