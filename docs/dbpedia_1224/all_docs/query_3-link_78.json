        "text": "The 83rd and last in a long line of royal yachts, HMY Britannia has become one of the most famous ships in the world. Now permanently moored at Edinburgh’s Port of Leith, the floating palace is a visitor attraction welcoming some 300,000 people aboard each year.\n\nFor Queen Elizabeth II, Britannia was the ideal residence for state visits and peaceful royal family holidays and honeymoons. For the British public, Britannia was a symbol of Commonwealth. For the 220 naval officers who lived aboard Britannia, and the royal family, the 412-foot-long yacht was home.\n\nHaving travelled more than a million nautical miles over 44 years of service to the British Crown, Her Majesty’s beloved boat was decommissioned in 1997. Here are 10 facts about life aboard HMY Britannia.\n\n1. Britannia was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 April 1953 using a bottle of wine, not champagne\n\nChampagne is traditionally smashed against a ship’s hull during launching ceremonies. However, in a post-war climate champagne was seen as too frivolous, so a bottle of Empire wine was used instead.\n\nBritannia launched from the John Brown & Company shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland.\n\n2. Britannia was the 83rd Royal Yacht\n\nKing George VI, Elizabeth II’s father, had first commissioned the royal yacht that would become Britannia in 1952. The previous official boat had belonged to Queen Victoria and was rarely used. The tradition of royal yachts had been started by Charles II in 1660.\n\nGeorge decided that the Royal Yacht Britannia should both be a regal vessel as well as a functional one.\n\n3. Britannia had two emergency functions\n\nBritannia was designed to be converted into a hospital ship in time of war, although that function was never used. Additionally, as part of the Cold War plan Operation Candid, in the event of nuclear war the ship would become a refuge off the north-west coast of Scotland for the Queen and Prince Philip.\n\n4. Her maiden voyage was from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour in Malta\n\nShe carried Prince Charles and Princess Anne to Malta to meet the Queen and Prince Philip at the end of the royal couple’s Commonwealth tour. The Queen stepped aboard Britannia for the first time in Tobruk on 1 May 1954.\n\nOver the next 43 years, Britannia would transport the Queen, members of the Royal Family and various dignitaries on some 696 foreign visits.\n\n5. Britannia hosted some of the 20th century’s most notable figures\n\nIn July 1959, Britannia sailed the newly opened Saint Lawrence Seaway to Chicago where she docked, making the Queen the first British monarch to visit the city. US President Dwight Eisenhower hopped aboard Britannia for part of the journey.\n\nIn later years, Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton would also step aboard. Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales, took their honeymoon cruise on Britannia in 1981.\n\n6. The crew were volunteers from the Royal Navy\n\nAfter 365 days’ service, crew members could be admitted to the Permanent Royal Yacht Service as Royal Yachtsmen (‘Yotties’) and serve until they either chose to leave or were dismissed. As a result, some yachtsmen served on Britannia for over 20 years.\n\nThe crew also included a detachment of Royal Marines, who would dive underneath the ship each day while moored away from home to check for mines or other threats.\n\n7. All royal children were allocated a ‘Sea Daddy’ on board the ship\n\nThe ‘sea daddies’ were primarily tasked with looking after the children and keeping them entertained (games, picnics and water fights) during voyages. They also oversaw the children’s chores, including cleaning the life rafts.\n\n8. There was a ‘Jelly Room’ onboard for the royal children\n\nThe yacht had a total of three galley kitchens where Buckingham Palace‘s chefs prepared meals. Among these galleys was a chilled room called the ‘Jelly Room’ for the sole purpose of storing royal children’s jellied desserts.\n\n9. It cost around £11 million every year to run Britannica\n\nThe cost of running Britannia was always an issue. In 1994, another expensive refit for the ageing vessel was proposed. Whether or not to refit or commission a new royal yacht entirely came down to the election result of 1997. With repairs at a proposed cost of £17 million, Tony Blair’s new Labour government were unwilling to commit public funds to replace Britannica.\n\n10. All the clocks on board remain stopped at 3:01pm\n\nIn December 1997, Britannia was officially decommissioned. The clocks have been kept at 3:01pm – the exact moment the Queen went ashore for the last time following the ship’s decommissioning ceremony, during which the Queen shed a rare public tear."
