I am also getting older...,” Wadia later told press, as mentioned in the report.\n\nThe change in leadership, if it becomes a reality, will mean a change in guards after decades at the top of the second-largest listed packaged food company in the country. Wadia had originally joined the company board way back in 1993, the report said.\n\nThe decision, as per the report also comes at a time when Britannia’s board of directors at a meeting in May recommended the continuation of Nusli Wadia as director of the firm.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
