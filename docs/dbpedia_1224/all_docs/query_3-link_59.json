ABOUT THE INDIAN DAIRY INDUSTRY Since 1998 Indiahasbeen the number1 producer aswell as the user of dairy productsthroughout the world. The ever-sustainablegrowthin the availability andconsumptionofmilk and milk-based productsis due the fact that dairy activities are major source of livelihood andincome generation in the rural Indianeconomy. Majority of the dairy productsproducedin the economy are consumed domestically with majority of it being soldand consumedinthe form of liquid milk. The Indiandairy marketis currently valued at INR 9168 billionand is expected to reach valueof INR21971 billionby 2024. Lookingat the potential of dairy industry, its profitability and the way it has been addingto the socioeconomicdevelopmentthe governmentof Indiahas introducedvariousschemesand initiatives to further aid the dairy sector of the country. Forexample, “NationalDairy Programme”aims to improveproductivity of cattle and increase the milk productionthereby expandingand strengthening rural milk procurementinfrastructure leading to provisionof greater market access to the farmers. The dairy industry coversthe following segments:Milk, FlavouredMilk, Curd, ProbioticProducts, Flavoured& FrozenYoghurts, Buttermilk, Lassi, Ghee, Butter, Cheese, Paneer, Cream, Khoya, Dairy Whiteners, SkimmedMilk Powder, Ice Cream, Sweet CondensedMilk, Dairy Sweets and Whey.\n\n7. MARKET STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY The dairy productssector of Britannia has Monopolistictypeofmarketstructure. Monopolistic marketstructureiscombination of structureof competitivemarketsand monopoly. In monopolisticmarketstructure there exists large numberof firms that compete with each other which enables the firms to have certain degree of freedom and power to practice differential pricing within a certain range. Characteristics of Oligopoly type of market structure: I. Many firms:UnderMonopolisticthere exists large numberof firms that are operatingin the economy. The competitionis notsevere since the all the firms operatingare manufacturinginsignificant portionof total output comparedto othertype of market structure. In case of Dairy productsproducedby Britannia industriesthere are many competitorslike Amul, MotherDairy, Parag, Milma Milk, Aavin Milk, AnandaDairy andlot of other similar companiesalong with the local providersof dairy productsspreadall across the country. II. Freedom to entry and exit:Thereare no barriers to entry or exit in this typeof market structurelike patents, licence, controlover the productions, hugecostsof set ups which gives the firms freedom to enter and exit the marketas per their will. In case of Dairy productindustry, itcan be observedafter every while that there is a new entrantin the marketranging from new firms tonearby dairy shops. III. Lack of perfectknowledge:Thebuyersandsellers under monopolisticmarketsdoesnot possessperfect knowledge of the market. Every firm hasits own variety of differentiated productsthatare close substituteof the competitors’ products. Itbecomesdifficult for the buyersto knowaboutall these products. Thisleads to buyerpreferring productsthat are easily available near themor the onesthat are largely known. IV. Product differentiation:Theproductsoffered by the firms under Monopolisticare slightly homogenousinmostcases thatis the productsare more or less of the same kind with slight difference. In the dairy productsindustry, all the firms operatingare mostly selling the same typeof productslike milk, cheese, curd, yoghurtandother milk-based products butthe productdifferentiation as talkedaboutabovecomes in place is when the firms start toadd slight difference in terms of flavouring, colouring, designing, packagingetc. V. Unique patternof pricing behaviour:Thefirmsdesire tooperate independently to be able to earn maximumprofits butin reality, have to cooperatewith rivalsso uncertainty can be removed. But still firms can practice differential pricing with certain productsthat are different from thatof its competitors. VI. Advertising and selling costs:Sincethe firms cannot always freely determine the prices of the productstohave an edge over their competitorsin terms of market share the firms\n\n8. have toadoptmarketingstrategies to gain the market shareor to prevent their market share from falling. This leads to firm incurring advertisingandselling costs. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DEMAND I. Market size and growth: Indiaistheworld’s largest milk andmilk productsconsuming economy. Due tohigher per capita consumptionand ever-increasingpopulationthedemand for dairy productsof the company are positively affected i.e. it leads toincrease in demandof the milk-based productsoffered by the company. II. Consumption patterns: Consumption patterns throughoutthecountry significantly affect the demandof productsoffered by the company. Inurbanareas, consumptionofpackagedand processeddairy productslike Milk, cheese, butter, ghee, curdetc in goodquality packetsand tetra packspositively affects the demandof the dairy productsoffered by the company. But talkingaboutrural areas the people prefer unpackagedandunprocesseddairy productsfrom the local milkmandueto the taste factor or idea of freshness in their minds, this can lead to negative impact onthe demandof productsso offered by the company. III. Sophisticationof consumers: Theconsumersophisticationorknowledgeof consumersis increasing constantly. Theconsumerawareness aboutthe quality of productis increasing but with the small portionof the economy. Mostly thepeople living in urbanareas are getting more health conscious andproductnutritionaware which is leading to increase in demandof everyday goodnessproductsoffered by Britannia. In case of rural areas people don’tgive muchattentionto such aspects. IV. Receptivity to new products: Receptivity refers tohow to consumersreact to the introduction of new productsin the market. If the consumerswill have moreinterest in the new products offered by the company it would lead to increase in the demandandin case the consumers show negativeattitude towardto introductionof new productsit would lead tofall in demand. The urbanpopulationtendto showcomparatively more interest in the new productsoffered by the company like Milk beverages(Winkin cow milkshakes)andflavoured yoghurts, thereby increasingthe demandof the new productsoffered. V. Income of the consumer: Oneofthe basic factors affecting demandof commodity is income of the consumers. As the income of the consumersincreases the demandof the productswill increase accordingly. The dairy productsare normalgoodsso in case of increase in the income of the consumersthe demandfor dairy productswill also increase. VI. Availability of substitutes: Asthecompetitionin the dairy sector is increasing due to entry of several internationaland nationalbrandsthe availability of substitutesisalso increasing substantially. Thesimilar type of products are offered by the competitivebrandslike Amul, MotherDairy, Parag, etc. The productslike milk, cheese, butter, flavoured milk, curd offered by the competitorsare complementary tothe similar productsoffered by Britannia. Therefor if the price of the complementary goodsreduces it would makethe productsof company more expensive in eyes of consumersthereby decreasing the demandof the dairy products offered by Britannia andvice-versa.\n\n9. FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SUPPLY I. Availability andquality of milk: Thispointis in respect to the milk productionandprocurement since we are talkingaboutthe dairy industry andthiswhole industry revolvesaroundthemilk and milk-based products. Theproducer will supply more dairy productsin case there is sufficient availability of goodquality milk from sources like rural areas. Incase the availability of milk from the sources is scarce dueto the weather, climate or geographical factors the producerwill notbe havingsufficient raw material i.e. is milk to further producemilk products. II. Level of technology: Technology isone of the mostimportantfactors to determine the supply of commodity. Usageof advancedtechnology increases the supply of the productwhich lead to attainingeconomies of scale leading to significant reductionin costs of productionthereby increasing the profits. For example, the usage of advancedmachinery and roboticsin the productionplantof Britannia to producedairy productslike cheese, yoghurtsorghee would lead to significant increase in the supply. III. Government policies: Governmentpolicieshasa great effect onthe supply of the dairy productindustry. Ifthe governmentprovidescertain subsidiesit wouldlead toincrease in supply asit would motivatethe producerto producemore but if the governmentincreases the taxes it wouldadd tothe costs of the productswhich will reduce profitability of the supplier andinduce the supplier tosupply less. Government of Indiais tryingto strengthen the infrastructure of dairy sector for productionof goodquality milk, procurement, processingand marketingof milk and milk-based productsthroughschemeslikeNPDD (NationalProgramfor Dairy Development), NationalDairy Plan. Suchplans wouldlead the company like Britannia toincrease their supply of dairy products. IV. Favourable trends: Ifit is noticed thatthe trendsof consumersare in favour of the products offered by the company thenthe company tendsto increase the supply inorder to maximise profits andto take advantageof favourabletrends. In case of dairy industry favourabletrends can be inclination of consumerstowardshealthy andfresh productsor greater interest of consumersin nutritionalfood. Looking at such trendsthe company wouldincrease the supply to take advantageof suchtrends. V. Increasing competition: Thedairy industry ofIndia is constantly growingleading to entry of more domesticand internationalbrandsandcompanies which is makingthe competition tougher. So, in order to tackle the competitionfor the purposeof increasing the marketshare or the retain the existing market share the company wouldbe compelled to increase the supply of products. Thecompany faces competitionnotonly from other companiesbut also from local sourcesof milk providerslike local dairies.\n\n10. CHALLENGES FACED BY THE COMPANY  Threats from competitors Since the Britannia’s Dairy products operates under the monopolistic competitive market structure there exists innumerable number of firms constantly competing to have a greater market share. All the firms are producing similar or slightly different products but in some cases the firms like Amul and Mother Dairy are producing completely different variety of milk-based products like ice-creams and buttermilk and Ananda Dairy is producing milk-based sweets. So, it is important for the company to tackle the competition and enter into new markets to have a wider reach and market share in the dairy industry.  Lowawarenessin Rural areas Britannia produces processed milk products like cheese, butter, milk-based beverages, curd, yoghurts all in packaged form. Currently the dairy products of Britannia has a wider reach in the urban areas of the country due the increasing population, health consciousness, greater interest in nutrition and above all due to the trust the brand has built over the years. But coming to rural areas of India people still prefer the unpackaged and unprocessed dairy products due the beliefs, taste and prices. It is a major challenge for Britannia to spread awareness in the rural areas regarding its quality products and build trust amongst people.  Maintaining theQuality As in the earlier part of the report we talked about the need for procurement of milk of good quality and sufficient quantity to produce the dairy products to be offered by the company, makes it a challenging task to maintain the quality of dairy products produced as it may not be necessary that the good quality of raw material i.e. milk will be available throughout the year. Factors like weather, climate, livestock condition can affect the quality and quantity of milk production in the country. Insufficient availability or bad quality milk procured leads to reduction in the quality of products produced."
