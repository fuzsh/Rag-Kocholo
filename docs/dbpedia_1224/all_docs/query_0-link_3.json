        "text": "The majority of Wadia's fortune is derived from a 51% stake in Britannia Industries, a Bangalore-based maker of biscuits and other bakery products. His stake is held directly and through several holding companies, according to an April 2024 stock exchange filing.\n\nHis other publicly traded holdings include a 54% stake in textile maker Bombay Dyeing & Manufacturing Co, a 66% stake in chemicals producer Naperol Investments and a 63% stake in Bombay Burmah Trading Co.\n\nWadia's GoAirlines India reported revenue of 41.5 billion rupees ($558 million) in its 2022 fiscal year. The closely held company is valued using reported financial results and the average price-to-sales multiple of two publicly traded peers: Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Cebu Air Inc.\n\nThe value of his cash and other assets is based on an analysis of dividends, stock transactions, taxes and market performance.\n\nThe company's investor relations office didn't respond to requests for comment on Wadia's net worth.\n\nNusli was born on Feb. 15, 1944 into a Parsi family in Mumbai, India. He's the son of businessman, Neville Wadia, and his wife Dina Wadia. His maternal grandfather, Muhammad Al Jinnah, was the founder of Pakistan, and his maternal grandmother, Rattanbai Petit, was born into a prominent Parsi family, the Petit-Tata clan.\n\nNusli obtained a British passport to make travel more convenient. He's married to Maureen Wadia, a former flight attendant who has been involved in the Mrs. India beauty pageant. They have two sons, Ness and Jehangir.\n\nWadia Group's first business venture was in marine construction more than 250 years ago, and the company was a key player during the era of British colonial rule. The family of marine designers built more than 350 vessels over 160 years, including the first ships constructed for the British Navy outside England, according to Wadia Group's website. Its ships include 'Mindmen', on which the American National anthem was composed, and 'HMS Cornwallis,' on which the Treaty of Nanking was signed, according to the group.\n\nThe company founded Bombay Burmah Trading, a teak-trading company, in 1863, and later diversified into tea, coffee, horticulture, dental, orthopedic and ophthalmic products.\n\nBombay Dyeing, founded in 1879, began selling beds and other home furnishings. Britannia Industries, founded in 1918, is manufacturer of snack foods. The group founded National Peroxide in 1954 and it became India's largest manufacturer of hydrogen peroxide by installed capacity.\n\nGoAir is the group's more recent venture. It's a low-cost airline that began operating in 2005."
