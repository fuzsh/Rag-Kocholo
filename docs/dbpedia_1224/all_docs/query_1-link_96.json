        "text": "It was a dark rainy monsoon day in Mumbai when I walked over to Britannia & Co., a restaurant synonymous with serving Parsi food in the city.\n\nThe area of town is heavily populated by old government offices and beautiful drooping trees; The historical restaurant fit perfectly with the atmosphere of the area.\n\nIn this blog post I’ll share with you the dishes I tried at Britannia & Co., a cultural restaurant landmark in Mumbai, India.\n\nBritannia & Company (also commonly Britannia & Co.)\n\nAlong with the actual food, one of the greatest things about eating at Britannia & Co. is the chance to be a part of history.\n\nDating back to 1923, Mr. Boman Kohinoor, a Zoroastrian immigrant from Iran, decided to open a restaurant in Mumbai serving Parsi food.\n\nWhat is Parsi food?\n\nAt the end of my meal, I had a chance to talk with Mr. Boman, and this is what he kindly shared with me:\n\n1200 years ago, the Persians fled Iran, and they landed on the shore of India, Mumbai.\n\nAnd so, the Maharaja (Great King) here, gave them support, gave them help, so they stayed here.\n\nSo they adopted part Persian part Hindu culture, and that is called Parsi culture – Persian mixed with Hindu.\n\nThey were Zoroastrian, our prophets name is Zoroaster, and we are called Zoroastrians. But when we came to India, the Indians called us Parsi.\n\n[So for Parsi food] You have a combination of Persian and Indian food.\n\nIn a way, although involving different cultures, Parsi culture immediately made me think of Peranakan culture.\n\nThe owner is an absolute superbly friendly man and is quite an amazing character.\n\nWhen you dine at Britannia & Co., he still comes around and has a chat with you, telling you stories as you eat.\n\nI won’t get into more history, but you can check out this post for more. What I will say is that, it’s about as classic as it gets when it comes to restaurants.\n\nThe Menu\n\nOn the menu at Britannia & Company (Britannia & Co.) you’ll find an assortment of dishes that range from Iranian influenced, to as the owner explained to me, more pure Indian dishes.\n\nThere are even some western dishes available. There are a real mix of dishes.\n\nDespite wanting to order the entire menu, since it was just my wife and I eating, we couldn’t order the entire menu, so I decided to go for a few of the main classic dishes that the restaurant is so well known for.\n\nPrices are not cheap, but portion sizes are good size, and the quality was excellent.\n\nSali boti (mutton)\n\nI’ll start with the first dish that emerged from the kitchen, the slai boti (this one made with mutton). It turned out to be my personal favorite dish of the meal.\n\nIt looked very interesting in appearance, a red brown gravy sauce topped with a heaping handful of little tiny shoe-string fried potatoes.\n\nSali boti is a classic Parsi dish, and although it’s similar to a curry, it’s more like a meat stew. Our waiter dished it out onto my plate, served with roti, and I took my first bite.\n\nThe mutton was incredibly tender, and the blend of spices and the gravy is what literally made my jaw drop in culinary excitement.\n\nIt wasn’t a pungent mixture of spices, but it was so well balanced, with ginger, cinnamon, cumin, and lots of dissolved onions. It was literally a perfect blend of spices, and the dish had an almost fruity taste.\n\nIt was absolutely exquisite, a gravy so good, I wanted to drink it.\n\nPrice – 600 INR\n\nChicken berry pulav\n\nBefore you eat at Britannia & Company (Britannia & Co.), you’ll probably read about their famous berry pulav, or someone will tell you about it.\n\nThere are a couple of different choices on their menu, but I went with the chicken berry pulav (by the way, pulav, pilaf, pilau, is a seasoned rice dish).\n\nIt was indeed a beautiful dish, the long grain basmati rice looked almost like little noodles, yet it looked fluffy and cottony. On top was a sprinkle of barberries, crispy fried shallots, and cashews.\n\nThe chicken, which was wrapped in a stew of spices, was folded within the center of the rice (so from the outside you couldn’t even tell it was there).\n\nIt was everything I had hoped for: fluffy rice, the natural sweetness from the berries which tasted similar to dried cranberries, a nutty crunch from the cashews, and spice and flavor from the chicken curry.\n\nThe berry pulav at Britannia & Company is legendary for a reason: it’s seriously delicious.\n\nPrice – 550 INR\n\nMutton dhansak\n\nFor my final dish, I ordered mutton dhansak, another one of what is considered a standard dish of Parsi cuisine – it’s the daal of Parsi food.\n\nThe dhansak included nuggets of tender mutton, wrapped within a very thick mixture of lentils and vegetables all pureed.\n\nWhat I immediately noticed about it was the smoky flavor it had. The dhansak was paired with a plate of rice that was lightly seasoned and a couple of meatballs.\n\nThe dhansak was good, but for me, the other two dishes I ordered were superior.\n\nPrice – 650 INR\n\nCaramel custard\n\nI’m not really into desserts, but the owner talked my wife and I into having a caramel custard for dessert. Britannia & Co. happens to be known throughout Mumbai for their caramel custard.\n\nIt was indeed very good, smooth and silky, and almost like a thick pudding in texture. It was quite sweet and light but refreshing in caramel taste.\n\nIf you do enjoy sweets, it’s a must order when you eat at Britannia & Company.\n\nPrice – 150 INR\n\nConclusion\n\nBritannia & Co. is one of the greatest Parsi restaurants in Mumbai, India.\n\nThe sali boti, an exquisite braised stew, and the berry pulav, a barberry seasoned rice, were the highlights of my meal there.\n\nBut along with the delicious food, dining at Britannia & Co. is a chance to be a part of this incredible historical restaurant and story in Mumbai.\n\nBritannia & Company (Britannia & Co.)"
