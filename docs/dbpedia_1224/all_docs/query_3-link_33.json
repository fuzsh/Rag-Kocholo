After determining the client it wants to target, the corporation selects what sort of messaging or attitude to take while selling the product.\n\nBritannia has persuaded moms to buy Tiger biscuits for their children, Little Hearts as a snack for teenagers, and Good Day as a daily cookie that brings joy to everyone's life.\n\nBritannia Major Marketing Campaigns\n\nBourbon Campaign\n\nThe business has launched a new ad for Bourbon, one of its most popular products.\n\nThe brand concentrated on friendship in this campaign.
