        "text": "Share price of Britannia Industries fell in trade today despite the FMCG firm reporting a 23.26 per cent rise in consolidated net profit in third quarter of this fiscal.However, revenue growth trajectory saw a significant decline in last quarter which dampened market sentiment.\n\nTotal revenue from operations rose 4.93 per cent YoY to Rs 2,982.68 crore as against Rs 2,842.44 crore in the year-ago period. Earlier, the figure grew by over 10 per cent YoY in Q3FY19.\n\nThe large cap stock fell up to 3.89% to Rs 3,125.7 on BSE today.\n\nTata Steel share price slips over 5% post Q3 earnings\n\nThe stock has lost 1.58% during last one year and 4.33% since the beginning of this year.\n\nShare price of Britannia Industries has lost over 3% in last three sessions.\n\nThe firm reported a profit of Rs 369.88 crore in the third quarter of this fiscal against consolidated net profit of Rs 300.07 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.\n\nManagement of the FMCG major highlighted that it witnessed moderate inflation in the prices of key raw material for the bakery business. However, the inordinate increase in milk prices adversely impacted the profitability of the dairy business.\n\nCommenting on the company's performance, Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry said, \"We had a decent quarter in the face of an economic slowdown...We chose to focus on strengthening the building block of the business rather than pushing sales in the face of a low offtake scenario.\"\n\nThe firm continued to expand the width and depth of distribution but additionally focused on improving distributor health and keeping the supply chain efficient, Berry said.\n\n\"During this phase of sluggish demand, we continued to invest in enhancing our brand equity through focused product campaigns. As a result of our efforts, we continue to strengthen our position as a dominant market leader,\" Berry added.\n\nOn the cost front, he said there was moderate inflation in the price of raw materials for the bakey business."
