        "text": "Indian businessman (born 1944)\n\nNusli Neville Wadia (born 15 February 1944) is an Indian billionaire businessman and the chairman of the Wadia Group, an Indian conglomerate involved in the FMCG, textiles, and real estate industries, among others.[1] His net worth was estimated at US$4.1 billion by Forbes in August 2021.[2]\n\nWadia, along with his sons, are the direct and only living descendants of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nNusli was born into the prominent Parsi Wadia family in Bombay, to businessman Neville Wadia and Dina Wadia.\n\nHis maternal grandfather Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the founder of Pakistan, and his grandmother, Rattanbai Petit was born into the elite Parsi family of India. His paternal grandfather, Sir Ness Wadia was a well-known textile industrialist, who played an important role during the late 19th century in turning the city of Bombay into one of the world's largest cotton trading centers. His paternal grandmother was an Englishwoman, Evelyne Clara Powell, from Yorkshire. His great-aunt was the politician and stateswoman Fatima Jinnah. His paternal aunt Clara Evelyne Wadia was married to Robert Byng, 7th Earl of Strafford. Through his parents' families, he is related to several of subcontinent’s political figures and business people.\n\nFor some time, Wadia held British citizenship by descent, as his father had been born in the UK. Wadia was educated at Cathedral and John Connon School. He was also educated at the Rugby School in England. He later went to study in the United States, earning a PhD in chemical engineering at the University of Florida.[3]\n\nWadia is married to Maureen Wadia, a former air hostess, who heads Gladrags magazine and is one of the organizers of the Mrs. India beauty pageant. They have two sons: Ness and Jehangir Wadia.[4]\n\nIn 2004, Wadia accompanied his mother, Dina, and sons, Ness and Jeh, on a visit to Pakistan, during which he visited the mausoleum of his grandfather, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and great-aunt Fatima Jinnah in Karachi.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1962, Nusli entered Bombay Dyeing as a trainee in the spring mills. In 1970, Nusli was appointed joint managing director. In 1971, Nusli learned that his father was planning to sell the company to R. P. Goenka and move abroad. Nusli was only 26 at the time and had his own ambitions to run the company. With the help of his mother, sister, friends, and mentor J.R.D Tata he acquired 11 per cent of the company's shares and went on to persuade the employees to pool their savings and buy shares to prevent the sale. Nusli then flew to London where his father was making the deal, and convinced him not to sell the company or emigrate. In 1977, Nusli succeeded his father as the chairman of the company.\n\nIn 2016, Wadia announced that he would be filing a defamation case against Ratan Tata and his Tata group, after being removed as the independent director of Tata Motors.[6] During the 2016–19 period, when the trial was ongoing, Wadia's net worth increased from US$3.5 billion to US$7 billion.[7] In January 2020, Wadia withdrew the defamation case, following Tata's statement that there was no intention to defame Wadia.[8][9]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
