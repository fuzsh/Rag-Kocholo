        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nBritannia Industries Limited is an Indian company specialised in food industry, part of the Wadia Group headed by Nusli Wadia. Founded in 1892 and headquartered in Kolkata, it is one of India's oldest existing companies and best known for its biscuit products.\n\nThe company sells its Britannia and Tiger brands of biscuits, breads and dairy products throughout India and abroad. Beginning with the circumstances of its takeover by the Wadia Group in the early 1990s, the company has been mired in several controversies connected to its management. However, it still has a large market share and it is profitable.\n\nRounded Rectangle\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe company was established in 1892 by a group of British businessmen with an investment of â‚¹295. Initially, biscuits were manufactured in a small house in central Kolkata.\n\nThese were meant for officers of the British Raj and their families, people used to the exacting standards of English tea-time snacking.\n\nThe company initially manufactured only biscuits.\n\nRounded Rectangle\n\nLoading...\n\nRounded Rectangle\n\nLoading...\n\nLater, the enterprise was acquired by the Gupta brothers, mainly Nalin Chandra Gupta, an attorney, and operated under the name \"V.S. Brothers.\" In 1918, C.H. Holmes, an English businessman based in Kolkata, was taken on as a partner and on 21st March, The Britannia Biscuit Company Limited (BBCo) was launched, as a public limited company under the Indian Companies Act, VII of 1913.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nRounded Rectangle\n\nLoading...\n\nBiscuits were in high demand during World War II, which gave a boost to the company's sales. The government of British India needed a supply of specially made biscuits for its soldiers. The Britannia Biscuit Company rose to the challenge. The deal ran into several years, and the company sometimes devoted 95 per cent of its capacity to produce biscuits for the armed forces.\n\nLoading...\n\nRounded Rectangle\n\nLoading...\n\nWith the rise of the mutiny by Indians as they fought for independence against the British, the English group that founded the company, decided to sell it to sell it to an Indian, so the Gupta Brothers bought it, the main among them being,\n\nNalin Chandragupta.\n\nTo increase business, the brothers came in partnership with English businessman CH Holmes in 1918. That's when they opened another branch of Britannia in Bombay, resulting in 2 branches: in Calcutta and in Bombay.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nTECHNOLOGICAL DEVLEPMENT\n\nIn 1910, with the advent of electricity, buscuit making operations were mechanised. In 1921, it became the first company east of the Suez Canal to use imported gas ovens.\n\nIn1952, the Kolkata factory was shifted from Dum Dum to spacious grounds at Taratola Roads in the suburbs of Kolkata. During the same year, automatic plants were installed in Calcutta, and also 2 years later in Bombay.\n\nRounded Rectangle"
