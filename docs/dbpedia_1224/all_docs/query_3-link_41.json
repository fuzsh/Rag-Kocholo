        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBerry has been tightening left, right and centre. He’s been nudging sales managers to step out of office and engage more with trade partners.\n\nThe year was 1995, the early years of PepsiCo in India. The cola multinational was looking for someone to head a bottling operation in Gujarat, where PepsiCo’s share then was 2%.\n\nChairman Suman Sinha handpicked a 32-year-old, who put in his routine 14 hours a day and turned it into a 40% share in a year. For Varun Berry, that was effectively his first startup experience, in a large company.\n\nToday, four months after taking complete operational charge over the underachieving Rs 6,912 crore FMCG major Britannia, it’s that very culture Berry is invoking, selling and fashioning.\n\nAt Goa last week, he was exhorting 130 of Britannia’s senior most managers in the company’s annual conference, themed, 'In It to Win It', to dethrone Parle as the domestic leader in biscuits.\n\n\"Start-ups teach you to get the best out of operations,\" he says. \"Also, I’m a nuts-and-bolts guy and there’s a lot to tighten (at Britannia),\" says Berry.\n\nBerry has been tightening left, right and centre. He’s cut back on products and brands, he’s been nudging sales managers to step out of office and engage more with trade partners, he’s been stressing on market orientation, he’s been baying for solid execution.\n\nThe first results, for the quarter to June, show a company that has tightened up and improved profitability (See graphic). The first year is easy as there’s plenty of scope to trim costs, say officials of rival companies and former employees, several of whom exited Britannia in and around Berry’s entry.\n\n\"There is a saying that a new broom always sweeps faster,\" says a former Britannia senior official who is now with another FMCG company, on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"It is the consistency and ability to keep delivering from the second year through product innovation and sales growth that matters.\"\n\nExecution Focus\n\nBerry joined Britannia in January 2013, as chief operating officer, after a brief hiatus from the corporate world.\n\nAfter he left as CEO of PepsiCo Foods in early 2012, Berry teamed up with former Vodafone India chief commercial officer Sanjoy Mukherjee to float iClinic Healthcare, a technologybased healthcare consultancy firm.\n\nHe is now a sleeping partner in that venture. Britannia takes up most of his waking hours. This March, when Vinita Bali, managing director for the last nine years, was moved to a group-level role, Berry replaced her.\n\nSince that appointment, the Britannia stock is up 45% in a market that has appreciated 18%. Yet, says Berry, \"there is a long way to go.\" Berry joined a company that was suffering from low employee morale, seeing high commodity prices eat into margins, and facing stiff competition not just from tier-I players but also from tier-II players.\n\nPromoter Nusli Wadia’s brief to Berry was sharp: grow faster than the market, grow market share and profitability by making the operations more efficient. Britannia is in a better place on each of those fronts.\n\nWhen he joined, Berry was putting in 14-15 hour workdays. He still does 12-hour days, invoking the frugal and execution aspects of a startup. Berry spent the first 100 days looking closely at sales and distribution, organisational structure and product portfolio.\n\nHe spoke to people. Berry broke down the components of fixed cost, which was a high 21% for a company that was operating on single-digit margins. \"The finding that there were 2,500 biscuits brands in the marketplace, across regions, meant Britannia had to play its value equation with customers and trade well,\" he says.\n\nIt’s made a start, by tackling various facets of operations with new energy. \"Most leaders who worked in multinationals tend to be very market-focused,\" says Raj Jain of Bharti Retail, which stocks Britannia products in its stores.\n\n\"Berry has this holistic 360 degree approach to business, from looking at operational efficiencies and manufacturing to supply chain. He is a complete general manager than most CEOs I know.\"\n\nDoing More With Less\n\nBerry has been cutting off what he calls \"too many small, moving parts\".\n\nThese were deflecting focus from Britannia’s core business of biscuits, from where it derived 80% of its revenues. He did away with breakfast cereals and snacks, which predecessor Bali launched in 2012. He cut back on size variants.\n\n\"The company had 14 brands and 25 SKUs (stock-keeping units, the trade term for size variants), and most brands reached no threshold,\" he says. Berry has chosen to back five big brands: Good Day, Marie, 50:50, NutriChoice and Tiger.\n\nBesides allocating more money to them, Britannia tweaked their product recipes, either to improve quality or to offer greater value. \"It’s great Britannia is focused on the right big brands,\" says Jain of Bharti Retail, offering a retailer’s perspective on product variants.\n\n\"Too many companies launch innovations or brand extensions, and there is no space to keep all that.\" Britannia is setting itself up for a goal outlined by chairman Wadia at the company’s 95th annual general meeting last month in Kolkata.\n\n\"The difference with Parle (in market share) is just 3 percentage points, which is not much and we want to bridge it in the next three years,\" he had said. Berry terms it an \"interesting\" goal.\n\nBritannia has been swamping its distributors with supplies, and has increased its market share in the biscuits segment by 1.2 percentage points in 2013-14, according to industry estimates.\n\n\"There is a new-found aggression and swiftness in Britannia’s reaction to competition, but Parle’s pace is equally fast,\" says marketing consultant Jagdeep Kapoor, adding that the fight will be bloody.\n\nIn the past year, Parle has launched a product every month, including at the higher end. A senior official of Parle, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirms his company is watching Britannia’s sudden aggression in the marketplace and its shifting focus from manufacturing to distribution.\n\nTrade Relations\n\nThere was a time when Britannia’s strength was distribution. \"As a management trainee with Hindustan Lever, I would admire Britannia’s distribution reach,\" says Berry.\n\n\"But since then, attrition among distributors has been high.\" Berry is trying to reverse this tide by emphasising first principles and execution: asking its managers to connect more with the ground.\n\nSenior managers have been holding one-on-one meetings with trade partners, understanding their reward structures and problems, and making them aware of what they need to do to service the company’s goals.\n\n\"They had to be wooed back,” says Berry. \"Frankly, they can make as much money selling SIM cards.\" According to Berry, some of the company’s best talent is driving distribution in markets where it is relatively weak. Britannia has also remapped its sales structure.\n\nThe older structure pivoted around smaller territories and multiple products. So, for example, a sales person would handle both biscuits and dairy for a territory.\n\nIn the new system, the territories are bigger, but a sales person handles only one product. Effectively, there are now two Britannia sales people servicing each distributor, giving it more distribution depth.\n\nPeople Challenge\n\nThe greater demands placed by Britannia on its people have coincided with a period of high attrition in the company. In the past two years, it has lost a lot of seniorlevel talent, the most recent being head of marketing Anuradha Narasimhan to a start-up.\n\n\"External conditions in terms of a competitive threat from start-ups and new sectors trying to attract talent from FMCG continue to be a challenge,\" says Ritesh Rana, head of HR, Britannia.\n\nReplacements have been drafted as much through elevations from inside as by new hirings from outside. Berry felt the sales and marketing team could do with more aggression.\n\nSo, Ali Harris was brought back from Vodafone after just two months to head marketing. Hemant Rupani was brought in, also from Vodafone, to head sales. Berry insists the changes are not about discarding the old and bringing in the new.\n\n\"It is about tapping potential where it is,\" he says. \"Six of my 11 key talent are old-timers.\" In both cases, internal or external, the new people are younger than those they have replaced.\n\n\"It’s not the number of years you have put in. It’s more about substance than form,\" says Berry. For example, Rana, who has been in Britannia for more than a decade, was moved up two levels to head HR.\n\nSimilarly, Manjunath Desai, who Berry identified as a high-potential manager while he was in charge of consumer insights, was made VP — strategy and business development, and given charge of the cake and rusk business.\n\n\"He is a taskmaster,\" says Desai of Berry.\n\n\"The demand is always on the output (what impact you make), never on the input (how long you worked)… He has made me rethink what we are capable of. And each time I have rethought, I have aimed higher.\"\n\nAttrition, though noticeable, is on a downward trend. \"Varun is a good team builder and motivator and can lead from the front,\" says Param Uberoi, former chairman of Pernod Ricard India, who has interacted with Berry in the past.\n\n\"He has a clear vision and focus.\"\n\nCompetitive Culture\n\nBerry says he believes in bringing in warmth in employee dealings, but he does not spare the rod either.\n\n\"In the earlier system, we neither received brickbats nor heart-felt communication, says a senior official who has seen the transition. We know where we stand with Berry.\" According to Desai, who has been with the company since 2008, the biggest change in Britannia is its aggression.\n\n\"There is a bias to execute, the change is in how we are reacting to competition,\" he says. \"We have been attacked in all segments — health, cream and premium cookies. We responded by matching value and creating high impact retail presence to take the sting out of their attack. The amplitude and quality of our responses has gone up significantly.\"\n\nBerry says Britannia had become overconfident and complacent. \"It had to get to be competitive,\" he adds. \"In that, I am very aggressive.\"\n\nIn all this, Berry says he has the buy in of Wadia, who has a reputation for being a domineering promoter, too focused on manufacturing and tight-fisted in brand building.\n\n\"Mr Wadia is very strong on manufacturing and supply chain, and does tend to have his pet projects,\" says Berry. \"He also gives a long rope to operate and is reasonably empowering.\"\n\nBerry will need a very long rope for his next two challenges: ensuring the innovation pipeline — something Britannia is not known for — delivers and scaling up the dairy business to Rs 2,000 crore.\n\nAs he basks in the glow of short-term change, he will increasingly be assessed on his ability to create long-term value on those two fronts. And for that, he will have to summon equally the spirit of a startup and the solidity of execution on scale.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe known and unknown unknowns of Ola Electric IPO\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWarren Buffett is selling Apple shares to hold on to cash.
