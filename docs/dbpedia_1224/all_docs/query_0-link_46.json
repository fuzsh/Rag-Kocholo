Nariman that had endorsed his son staying on as director, the report said.\n\nThe heir apparent, Ness Wadia, was not present during the meeting when the board conferred on the issue but attended the rest of the meeting, the report added.\n\nNess Wadia, the scion of one of Indiaâ€™s richest business families, has been sentenced for drug possession by a Japanese court, according to a report by The Financial Times. He has been handed a two-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, after 25 grams of marijuana was found on him at the New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, Japan.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
