Some of the most profound stories lie concealed in the everyday artifacts of life: your backpacks, lunch boxes, kitchen cabinets, and even in the comforting warmth of your cup of tea. Britannia was born more than a century ago in India and has been in the thick of these stories, witnessing the extraordinary events that have shaped our country's history. Today, we bring to you memories and voices of the last few living freedom fighters from all over India through Britannia Breads, Good Day, Milk Bikis, Marie Gold, and Winkin’ Cow. With just a few clicks and by scanning these Britannia packs with AR, you can now experience 1947% more history here → https://lnkd.in/dXM-NEcw The importance of safeguarding their invaluable legacy cannot be overstated. In the digital age, we have the privilege of telling their stories for generations to come, ensuring that their sacrifices are never forgotten. #Britannia1947\n\nSee more comments\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in"
