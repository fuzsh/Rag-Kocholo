        "text": "A Comparative research paper on the Civil Rights movement in the United States and Northern Ireland\n\nThe twentieth century is one of struggle. It was during this time that historically disenfranchised communities from Gujarat, India to Mobile, Alabama rose against the yoke of historic oppressors. Most admirably, the African-American Civil Rights movement (CRM) of 1965, against all odds, sought liberty and justice for all African-Americans. The US CRM was a truly global event. This movement was so inspiring that it kindled a similar one across the Atlantic, in a region a tenth the size of Louisiana and with half its population.[1] The CRM of Catholics in Northern Ireland borrows directly from, and at times mirrors, the African American movement of 1965. The aim of this paper is to compare and contrast these civil rights movements.\n\nThe nature of discrimination is such that it denies the humanity of the other. As a species, humans have developed markers along racial, social, religious, economic, and political lines that aim at creating separate identities and spaces in the hopes of establishing domination. Blacks in twentieth-century Unites States faced discrimination along racial lines. This discrimination is a product of the slave trade and of a deeply-entrenched white supremacy. In Northern Ireland, otherness was stressed along cultural and religious lines. The suppression of Catholics in the country was a product of a long history of brutal English colonialism and rule. Blacks and Catholics incarnated two socially, economically, and civilly subordinate communities within their respective societies, subject to similar structures of discrimination that resulted in analogous patterns of mobilization.[2]\n\nDepending on one’s agenda, one could trace the origins of Catholic oppression even before Henry VIII’s Act for English Order in 1537, or, more practically, to the London agreement of 1925. This agreement came after a bloody Irish war of Independence against the British. It allowed for Irish independence, yet it divided the North and South of Ireland. The division was made, quite literally, on religious lines. The Boundary Commission of 1925 carved up six northern counties that had a Protestant majority, from the Southern twenty-six counties. These six counties (which encompassed Armagh, Derry, Donegal, Fermanagh and Tyrone) remained loyal to the United Kingdom. However, the Protestant majority counties maintained significant Catholics minorities.\n\nThe Protestant majority of the newly-formed Northern Ireland was highly suspicious of Catholics. As John J. Kane explains, “the dynamics of prejudice and discrimination for most Protestants in the North are fed by fears that nearly all Catholics are traitors who work tirelessly to destroy the border… and [who would] treat Protestants the way the Protestants now treat Catholics.”[3] The fear of the boundary dissolution made many Protestants believed that the Catholics ultimately wished to be reintegrated into the rest of independent Ireland. Reintegration would mean that Protestants would no longer hold power. Protestants in Northern Ireland were therefore incentivized to suppress the Catholic minority. Faced with these challenges, the Protestant leadership of the new Northern Ireland, in order to curb the Catholic threat, sought to ostracize Catholics and impede them from gaining influence.\n\nProtestant leadership, like whites in the Deep South, used gerrymandering. Elections were a menace to both the Ulster Unionists (Protestant party) in Northern Ireland and whites in the South. Given that Protestants and Catholics, like whites and blacks, were historically segregated, the electoral lines that divided Northern Ireland into its administrative areas were drawn strategically. Gerrymandering ultimately allowed, “partial disenfranchisement of minorities… whites and Unionists were able to preserve their power even where they represented a numerical minority. In sum, ‘a united group – Whites in the South and Protestants in Ulster – held a monopoly of political power for their own kind.”[4] Gerrymandering allowed areas with larger Catholic constituents to be governed by minority Protestants. Kane highlights the example of Londonderry in which “69 percent of persons are Catholic yet the council consists of twelve Unionists (Protestant party) and eight Nationalists (Catholic party).”[5] Gerrymandering was key to maintaining established Protestant authorities on top.\n\nWhite leadership used gerrymandering and registration tests to mute black voters in the Deep South. Regardless of the size of the black constituents, white leadership placed obstacles for blacks to vote. For example, representation in Selma, Alabama was, like in Ireland, unrepresentative of the town population. In April 1961, blacks numbered half of the voting-age population of the town. However, of the 15,000 eligible black voters, only 156 of them were registered.[6] The obstacles to representation in Selma were offensively indiscreet. Whereas in Ireland district boundaries muted Catholics, the Deep South outright rejected blacks in the voting registrars. Pretexts such as difficult registration and literacy tests masked the racist motives of the white establishment to mute blacks.\n\nIn the post-Civil war era, African American experienced institutionalized racism. Though slavery was outlawed, systems of oppression were deeply entrenched. The Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896 sought to challenge this system, but, unfortunately, the case ruled in favor of the “separate but equal” doctrine. This doctrine upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation and legitimized the infamous Jim Crow Laws. The Plessy v. Ferguson case highlights the profound racism that was fused in the Southern States. Though slavery was long gone, white southerners were repulsed by the idea of sharing with African-Americans. The post-Plessy v. Ferguson world saw a deeply polarized reality in which African-Americans faced obstacles toward economic, social, and political equality.\n\nThe overturning of the Plessy v Ferguson was a challenge to the establishment. White populations benefited greatly from institutionalized racism. Following Brown v. Board of Education, white segregationists and policy makers were outraged. The suggestion that whites and blacks could be in the same schools sent shockwaves through the South. The deeply entrenched sentiment of white supremacy was one of the main obstacles to school integration. White Southerners felt that integrationist policies would threaten their position in society. Thus they counter-mobilized against the ruling. Aldon Morris argues that “all whites in the South had a stake in the segregationist policies because they all derived privileges from it. Low and middle-income whites benefited from segregated labor force because they did not need to compete with blacks. Wealthier whites benefited because blacks were a source of cheap labor.”[7] White segregationists tried to counter the NAACP’s legal victories with tactics that ranged from boycotting to vigilante violence.\n\nThe Catholic CRM challenged the Protestant establishment. As the Deep South and Northern Ireland can attest, divided societies see CRMs as zero sum games. A victory by one side means a loss to the other. In Northern Ireland, “fears and apprehensions among Protestants of a threat to Unionist domination and control of Government by (an) increase of Catholic population and powers, inflamed in particular by the activities of Loyalist organization, provoked strong hostile reaction to civil rights claims… which was readily translated into physical violence against Civil Rights demonstrators.”[8]Just like whites in the Deep South, Protestants had an interest in preserving the status quo. Even impoverished Protestants who were “at the bottom of the economic heap” found comfort in knowing that Catholics “as a class, were worse off.”[9] This sentiment fed the myth of Protestant superiority and, when challenged, triggered violence.\n\nProtestant backlash to the Catholic mobilization came from all sectors of the population. When claims of discrimination were levied against the Northern Ireland government, Protestant groups reacted skeptically. They saw the minority Catholic movement as disloyal and dangerous. Voices against the Catholics began to gain numbers. One of the most significant anti-Catholic voices in Northern Ireland came from Reverend Paisley. In 1966, Paisley organized nine rallies against Northern Ireland’s Prime Minister decision to allow Nationalists to celebrate the Easter rising. He argued that Catholic identity and emancipation amounted to a “Rome lead offensive against Protestantism.”[10] Such inflammatory rhetoric further stoked the fears of many Protestants that saw Catholics as a very real danger. Paisley’s leadership led to the violent clashes between Protestant counter-demonstrators and the CRM. In January of 1969, the People’s Democracy[11] held a march between Derry and Belfast that was ambushed by loyalists, supposedly on the urges of Paisley.[12]The Royal Ulster Constabulary was unable to rein the violence and many accuse it of acting passively in the face of the attacks.\n\nIn the face of such backlash, both Civil Rights Movements sought to succeed through non-violence. The philosophy of non-violence in this century originated during the Indian independence movement under Mahatma Ghandi and is later imported to the United States. In the United States, Martin Luther King adopted Gandhi’s vision to challenge the white establishment in the South. The adoption of non-violence was a strategic decision that proved essential to the US Civil Rights’ success. However, it was a difficult undertaking. Dr. King and groups like the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FRC) and American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) had to persuade African-Americans that peace was the most effective way of dealing with the abuses of the system.[13] Thus from the beginning, the American CRM responded to “violence with a more powerful force:’ non-violence.”[14] Peace, at all costs, was the weapon of choice.\n\nTelevision was an important tool in the US CRM and NI CRM. In America, television’s rise to prominence was lightning fast, so fast and so important that “all participants in the Civil Rights struggle understood its dramatic power. As politicians, demonstrators, news reporters, litigators, and others tried to shape and capture public opinion…”[15] Television brought to light the systems of oppression that existed in the Deep South and managed to push legislation in Washington to rectify it. The importance of television in the US CRM is that it created a nation-wide consciousness that generated outrage at segregation and oppression. Outside of the US, the advent of television allowed the people of Northern Ireland to observe the struggle. In Northern Ireland alone, the number of television licenses went from 10,000 in 1954 to 194,000 in 1962.[16] The proliferation of television sets meant that Northern Irish viewers were tuning into the BBC’s coverage of sit-ins in segregated facilities, the Freedom Rides of 1961, the protest marches, and the brutal treatment of non-violent protestors at the hand of the police.[17] Courtesy of television Catholics in Northern Ireland, like republican Leader Gerry Adams, saw an “example that you didn’t just have to take it, you could fight back.”[18]\n\nTelevision increased the politicization of Northern Ireland. Broadcasted images like those on Pettus Bridge allowed people like Michael Farley, a student in Queen’s University, to recall “all young Catholics… were very influenced by seeing on television the American Civil Rights movement… and I think there was a very general identification with it.”[19] This feeling of solidarity led the Irish Catholics to appropriate slogans and non-violence techniques of African-Americans. In marches, some protestors dubbed themselves the “white negroes” and would chant slogans such as “We shall overcome,” drawing explicit parallels to the US CRM.[20]\n\nThe rhetoric of the CRM in Northern Ireland was initially of peace. At first, leaders like Bernadette Devlin,[21]Betty Sinclair, and Fred Heatley stressed the non-violent nature of the movement. Pacifist leaders who saw the televised images of the US CRM often praised Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil disobedience and sought to emulate it. In a meeting in Belfast aimed at outlining the strategy of the movement, Ciaran Mc Aili, president of the Irish Pacifist Association, stated: “We decided that the Civil Rights campaign as they were doing in America is the proper road for us… they [the Irish Catholics] would see victories being achieved this way that had never been achieved by militarism.”[22]The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) hoped that peace could best convince the authorities better than the bullet could. Specifically, the NICRA truly hoped to distant itself from radical and militant IRA. Success, however, would be crucial to legitimize this claim and place a lid on any violence.\n\nLegalistic stagnation in Northern Ireland precipitated violence. In May of 1963, the Homeless Citizen League (HCL) staged a picket outside the Unionist council in Dungannon to protest against discriminatory policies in housing. This movement quickly formed the Campaign for Social Justice, whose purpose was to collect data on every injustice done against all creeds and political opinions, including details of discrimination in jobs and houses, and bring them to attention.”[23] The CSJ’s legalistic approach was much like the NAACP, and their goals were identical. It hoped to exhaust all legislative avenues to succeed in order to have institutionalized discrimination against minorities legally acknowledged and eliminated through court rulings or legislation.[24]The CSJ, however, did not succeed. Their report that catalogued a host of discriminatory policies in Dungannon failed miserably, as did their push to make Republican organizations legal.[25]The CSJ’s failure to redress these issues in the courts “eliminated the last prospect of advance by constitutional means.”[26] Unlike the resilience of the NAACP, which managed success after decades of struggle, the CSJ became deflated with failure. The legalistic failure of the CSJ were as, Richard Rose argues, due to that “Ulster Catholics have not had the choice of strategies available to Southern blacks, for the United Kingdom enumerates no justiciable civil or political rights. The ‘rights’ that an Englishman may believe he enjoys are simply cultural norms, generalizations from customary behavior.”[27] The violence of the Troubles occurred because people felt trapped, seeing no hope to garner meaningful change from within the system.\n\nWanton and unchecked violence on protesters ignited the Troubles. NICRA used marches, designed after the ones in the America, to protest. The organized march from Coalisland to Dungannon on August 24, 1968 (triggered when a Catholic family was evicted to make room for a 19-year-old Protestant woman) imitated the Selma-Montgomery march. The first march was not met with any significant violence. However, the second march on October of that same year was met with savage resistance. The Royal Ulster Constabulary led a savage baton charge on several hundred protesters that had crossed a cordoned off section of the city. The images of the charge were broadcasted globally and were followed by outrage. The reaction to the violence was similar to what happened in Selma. The police mismanagement “galvanized the hitherto minority community and a series of civil rights protest sprang up all over Northern Ireland, setting off counter-protests by loyalists and police interventions.”[28]The state endorsed violence on unarmed Catholics led to the resurgence in militarism. In the face of failed legislative and non-violent measures, the CRM’s leadership became fragmented.\n\nThe Northern Ireland CRM’s violence was a product of earlier conflicts. Northern Ireland, as mentioned before, was excluded from the Irish Republic of the South. In the years of the Irish War of Independence and the Civil War (1919-1921; 1922-23), much of the fighting was done in Central and Northern Ireland. The history of violence was ripe and recent in the mind and heart of many. Thus, when Protestant violence began to increase, voices of the past called for militarism. When Britain mobilized troops into Ireland, violence escalated and culminated the massacre of thirteen Catholics on Bloody Sunday 1972. In the face of growing desperation, the voices of nonviolence of the CRM were muffled with the cries for action. The change of tone can even be registered with Bernadette Devlin, the champion of non-violence in NICRM, by claiming: “she would not rule out the use of force to achieve her purposes if other methods of political persuasion had, in her judgment, failed.”[29] The change of rhetoric and outburst of violence marks the most significant difference between the CRM of America and Northern Ireland. Whereas the US CRM managed to maintain its non-violent approach, the NICRM failed to do so. Many scholars argue that the recent military conflicts with Britain, and a lack of non-violence training sparked the transition. Reflecting on the failure to maintain nonviolent direct action, Devlin mused that “everything we learnt from outside was by osmosis, we watched the television –that is why we probably got it wrong – we watched the black civil rights movement and we missed a bit about the non-violent training and the reading of Ghandi and all of that…”[30]The abandonment of non-violence would pave the way to even greater violence.\n\nThe movements of Northern Ireland and the Civil Rights movement share a great deal in common. Both these movements reacted against the oppression of a system that sought to silence the voices of disenfranchised people. These movements spoke against the economic, social, and political injustices perpetrated by a landed elite. However, though the systems were similar and the goals identical, the outcomes were different. The post-Civil rights movement in Ireland saw an explosion of violence and death during the infamous Troubles, while the American one triumphed by staying peaceful. The US Civil Rights movement, though it did not right all the wrongs of racism, changed the landscape of African Americans throughout the country. In conclusion, Louisiana and Londonderry incarnated two excluded and socially subordinate communities, which organized under difficult circumstances and shared similar patterns of mobilization in the hopes of correcting injustice.\n\nWork Cited;\n\nBlumenfeld, Yorick. \"Religious Divisions in Northern Ireland.\" In Editorial Research Reports 1970, vol.
