        "text": "4/15/2024\n\nThe University of Akron School of Law Student Chapter is honored to be recognized as Student Chapter of the Month! Akron ACS has been re-building its chapter since Covid by hosting more events over the last two years. Akron ACS's goal on campus has been to promote progressive conversations. In the fall semester, the chapter hosted a discussion on the current state of stare decisis with Dean Mike Gentithes post-Dobbs. The chapter then hosted a discussion on the intricacies between the First Amendment and social media with Northern District of Ohio Judge Phil Calabrese and Dean Emily Janoski-Haehlen. To wrap up the semester the chapter co-hosted its pilot program with the Akron Federalist Society chapter on Affirmative Action which was moderated by the newly elected City of Akron Mayor Shammas Malik. For the spring semester, Akron ACS participated in the chapter’s first Constitution in the Classroom event and taught 7th and 8th graders in Akron Public Schools about the Fourth Amendment. The Chapter's spring pilot program , where Akron ACS is co-hosting a book discussion of Jonathan Rapping’s Gideon’s Promise with the Summit Legal Defender’s office. The chapter plans to wrap up the semester with a final networking event with Akron’s student chapter of the Federal Bar Association and the Akron Federalist Society.\n\nThe success with programming and the growth of Akron’s chapter would not be possible without its passionate board: President Charli McConnell, Vice-President Nolan Nadler, Programming Chair Alex Dorman, Social Media Chair Kenzie Halliday, Membership Chair Sera Martin, Chapter Liaison Matt Bodnar, Historian Natalie Gottfried, Secretary Kassie Seabolt, and Treasurer Brendan Mohan. The efforts of Akron’s chapter would not be possible without the support of faculty advisor Professor Brant Lee. Go Zips!\n\n2/12/2024\n\nThe Southwestern Law School ACS Chapter is thankful to be recognized as the ACS National Chapter of the Month. In our second year since reforming, the chapter has grown and developed a future pipeline of chapter leaders to continue into the future.\n\nFor this academic year, the chapter has already hosted a discussion on the Justiciability Doctrine and its application by the Roberts court that was co-sponsored by the Loyola Law School ACS Chapter and the Southwestern Law School ACS Chapter. The Chapter has also hosted a film screening of the award-winning documentary, Being Michelle, on disability rights in the carceral setting, screening that was followed by a panel discussion with two of the film’s producers, a Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney, a Senior Litigation Counsel for Disability Rights California, and the Director of the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness.\n\nFor the March 2024 Primary Election and November 2024 General Election, our Chapter is partnering with the Southwestern Law School Public Service Program and the Election Protection Coalition to train and volunteer as election observers. Later this Spring, we are also partnering with OutLaw, the law school’s LGBTQ+ student organization, to present an event on SCOTUS’s recent decisions that have led to the privileging of specific religious biases that lead to humiliation and barriers for LGBTQ+ consumers.\n\nThe ACS Chapter at Southwestern Law School is composed of Faculty Advisor Richard Jolly, student board members Alex Gonzalez, Anthony Gilmore, Anthony Carini, Cassandra Diviak, Daniel Golub, Diana Perez, Carie Martin, Shara Darden, and 1L Representatives Ella Kimbell, Baylenne Brunetti and Nicole Milner.\n\n01/22/2024\n\nThe ACS Arizona State University (ASU) Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law Student Chapter is honored to be chosen as student chapter of the month. ASU ACS has spent the 2023-24 academic year building connections with the ACS Arizona Lawyer Chapter and with progressive attorneys throughout the state. So far this year, ASU has hosted a number of events with speakers from the Arizona legal community, including: a ‘Paths to the Bench’ panel with state and federal judges; events with ACLU of Arizona and All Voting is Local; a lecture on American Indian influence on the Constitution in coordination with the Native American Law Students Association; and a workshop on mindfulness and stress reduction techniques for future and practicing attorneys. The chapter is also expanding its professional development capacity, hosting career information sessions for 1L students and for students interested in clerkships. Lastly, the chapter was thrilled to welcome ACS President Russ Feingold to campus to deliver his lecture ‘Amending the Constitution: Twin Jeopardies.'\n\nIn the coming weeks, ASU ACS will partner with the Liberty Project, the school’s reproductive rights organization, to discuss the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot initiative and will host a panel of attorneys suing the state over its unequal funding of public education.\n\nUnder the mentorship of faculty advisor Erin Scharff, the executive board is led by President Charlie Miller, Vice President Tubah Ahmad, Treasurer Jeri Fromme, Director of Operations Helen Pauly, Director of Publicity Peter Talkington, Director of Diversity and Inclusion Lauryn Johnson, Director of Attorney and Alumni Engagement Allison Sluga, Director of Community Engagement Felix Raimondo, 3L Representative Evan Ridley, and 1L Representatives Abigail Murray, Alec Bacon, Mattias Lederer, and Crispin South.\n\n12/11/2023\n\nThe ACS Nebraska College of Law Student Chapter has taken great strides to connect progressive lawyers throughout the Nebraska legal community and is honored to be chosen as student chapter of the week. So far this year, Nebraska Law ACS has hosted a Supreme Court Roundup in cooperation with the Federalist Society; a Banned Book Breakfast in cooperation with the Student Intellectual Property Law Association, Equal Justice Society, and the People’s Parity Project; as well as several other events in the Law and Democracy series, including “The Inner and Outer Work of Democracy” with Preeta Bansal, a panel with Arizona election administrators, and a panel about the Separation of Powers in Nebraska’s Constitution.\n\nUnder the advice of faculty advisors Eric Berger and Kyle Langvardt, the executive board is led by President Jennifer Craven, Vice President Elliott Lund, Events Coordinator Anna Reganis, Secretary Emma Schlenker, Treasurer Taylor Finke, and 2L Representative Alison Uecker. The Nebraska College of Law Chapter of ACS plans to continue its focus on its Law & Democracy series programming, inviting a wide range of speakers to the College of Law to address the degradation of democracy, the deep polarization in our political culture, and the role of lawyers in preserving and thinking about democracy and the rule of law.\n\n11/27/2023\n\nThe DePaul University College of Law ACS Chapter is honored and delighted to be recognized as the ACS National Student Chapter of the Week.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, the DePaul ACS Chapter is excited to be back on campus! They strive to provide DePaul Law students with a place they can freely and safely share ideas, thoughts, and perspectives on the progressive jurisprudential values and issues that connect them. It is through this goal of a strong legal community that their events are shaped by, and this year’s list of speakers and events aims to bring the leading voices of the Illinois legal community to share their perspectives on achieving their progressive goals.\n\nFor this academic year, they have already hosted a great event with Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul. The Chapter’s next event will feature Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. They plan on hosting additional statewide and local leaders. Outside of their hosted events, the Chapter cosponsors many events hosted by DePaul’s strong network of affinity organizations that share goals of building a strong, progressive community.\n\nThe work of this Chapter would not be possible without the dedication and determination of their Executive Board: President George Encarnacion Jr., Vice President Madeline Hudson, Director of Communications Joey Johns, Director of Events Jack McNeil, Director of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Sadiyah Ahmad, Treasurer Victor Horning, and Faculty Advisor Prof. Manoj Mate. Their work, along with the support of their growing general body members, is setting the foundation for this Chapter to continue thriving for years to come.\n\n11/20/2023\n\nThe ACS Villanova Student Chapter restarted last spring after going dormant during COVID. The chapter has now recruited over fifty members and is working to establish lasting programs like a Brown Bag Lunch Discussion series and a member newsletter.\n\nIt has hosted three lunch discussions on Election Law, Feminist Legal Theory, and the Implications of the Ministerial Exemption in Employment Law.

Willamette's Chapter has held numerous membership meetings to recruit and inform students about their upcoming events and programming.\n\nOutside of the university campus, Willamette's ACS Chapter supported the Lilith fund, a pro-choice group helping women seeking abortions in Texas after the passing of SB 8. In their efforts to promote innovative legislation and access to justice, the Chapter partnered with the Willamette Chapter of Law Students for Sensible Drug Policy for a panel featuring attorneys who specialize in drug-related offenses to discuss drug criminality reform and to provide guidance on citizen-police encounters. Recently, Willamette ACS also hosted Witness to Innocence for a workshop featuring a panel of death row exonerees to educate and promote the abolition of the death penalty in the United States.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, the Chapter will host a vicarious trauma panel on compassion fatigue to encourage the discussion of secondary trauma while advocating for victims.

The Chapter worked with other organizations to co-host panels on the Texas abortion ban, technological threats to privacy and democracy, the Afghan refugee crisis and the role of U.S. intervention, and the dangers of misinformation in elections. They are also hosting an event discussing how to protect the interests of sexual abuse survivors while maintaining decarceral goals.\n\nIn the spring, the Chapter plans to continue hosting thoughtful forums that represent their member’s diverse interests.

In September, the Chapter held its inaugural annual Constitution Day event. This year’s event focused on voting rights featuring Professor Eugene Mazo from Seton Hall University and Professor Juan Perea from Loyola University Chicago. The event sparked so much interest the Chapter is considering hosting a follow up program. Also in September, the Chapter held a Supreme Court Preview Panel with NIU Law professors to discuss important cases the Court will hear this Term.\n\nIn October, the Chapter held a reproductive rights event with the Illinois ACLU to discuss the current state of reproductive rights and what can be expected for the future.

In September, the NELB ACS partnered with the school's Federalist Society to celebrate Constitution Day. At the event, students watched \"A More Perfect Union: George Washington and the Making of the Constitution\" and after the film engaged in a discussion comparing a textualist versus pragmatic interpretation of the Constitution. The discussion evolved into conversations about current events surrounding the pandemic, mask and vaccine mandates. The interest was so great, the Chapter is now planning an event on the topic.\n\nIn October, the Chapter hosted an event with Joseph Irizarry, a Community Organizer for the Massachusetts Campaign to End Life Without Parole. Mr. Irizarry led an open discussion about his traumatic experiences as a child, and the ongoing trauma he experienced through the United States prison system, tying life without parole sentencing to racial justice. The event concluded with a moving Q&A where students opened up about their own experiences with loved ones going through the prison system and providing attendees with a perspective on the issue that they will hopefully carry with them.\n\nLooking forward, the NELB Student Chapter is excited to host a variety of upcoming events including a panel discussion on voting rights legislation, a networking social, a joint panel event with the Federalist Society to discuss the constitutionality of the mask and vaccine mandates, and a debrief session of the annual ACS convention.\n\nNELB's ACS Student Chapter would like to thank its Faculty Advisors, Professors Lawrence Friedman and Jordan Singer, for their continued support.\n\n10/11/2021\n\nUniversity of Missouri School of Law\n\nLaw school is not an easy process to start. A pandemic, the passing of a revered Supreme Court justice, the constant undermining of our most sacred democratic process, and a terrorist attack on the Capitol building certainly did not make law school easier. The class of 2023’s 1L year was certainly “eventful.” But none of the above thwarted or dissuaded Mizzou Law ACS. The events above, while perhaps making Mizzou ACS Chapter Leaders’ personal lives harder, clarified their mission for this new academic year.\n\nMizzou Law ACS is piloting a series titled “Equity Under the Law,” designed to advance discussions about progressive policies to aid those who have been historically underserved by their government. The series includes events with keynote speakers and panels with topics ranging from the decriminalization of sex work to immigration reform. From environmental activism to reparations, from Title IX to exoneration efforts, Mizzou Law ACS’s programming is going to demonstrate why progressive policy is the most pragmatic and optimal to secure the promise of liberty for all.\n\nWhile Missouri isn’t exactly known for being liberal, let alone progressive, the Mizzou Law ACS Chapter sees this as all the more reason to be vocal and is excited about the opportunity to actively work towards the task ahead. While systemic change will not happen overnight, right now, after all the traumatizing events the nation has been through, starting here in Columbia, Missouri at the Mizzou Law ACS Chapter is a good place to start.\n\nThe Chapter would like to thank its Faculty Advisor Professor Richard Reuben for his support of the chapter.\n\n10/4/2021\n\nUniversity of Texas School of Law\n\nThe University of Texas School of Law ACS is grateful to be recognized as ACS National’s Student Chapter of the Week. Texas Law ACS has an exciting year ahead, continuing to foster a progressive community of future lawyers by hosting social events and partnering with organizations across the law school on engagement efforts.\n\nThis year, Texas Law ACS has focused on reproductive rights in response to the new abortion ban in Texas. The chapter hosted an event on the Supreme Court’s Shadow Docket and the abortion ban with Professor Steve Vladeck. Another event on reproductive rights and justice is planned for October, with speakers from the National Women’s Law Center and the Center for Reproductive Rights. Texas Law ACS is also thrilled to be hosting Professor Melissa Murray of NYU Law and the Strict Scrutiny Podcast for a live taping and Q&A in November. The Chapter also hosted a panel with state and local union leaders on the role of unions in workers’ rights at the beginning of September.\n\nLooking ahead, Texas Law ACS is co-sponsoring an event series, “Alternative Curriculum” with Law Students for Black Lives. These discussions will supplement and contextualize the 1L coursework through a progressive frame of reference. The first such event will focus on the Supreme Court and racial equality. Additional upcoming events focus on the recent Texas legislative session, legal culture, and the path to judgeships for progressive lawyers.\n\nThe Texas Law ACS board, with a coalition of other progressive groups on campus, has been working hard to strengthen the progressive community at the law school and within the 1L cohort. The Chapter looks forward to continuing its busy schedule as the school transitions back to in person events.\n\nThe Chapter would like to thank its Faculty Advisor, Professor William Forbath, for his support.\n\n9/27/2021\n\nHoward University School of Law\n\nHoward University School of Law's ACS Student Chapter is honored to be selected as ACS National's Student Chapter of the Week.\n\nThis year, the Chapter is focusing on reconnecting with each other and with their campus community through programming and implementing new projects. This past week, their Membership Chair, Catherine Ross, and Social Media and Publicity Chair, Kelbey Egerland, helped the Chapter celebrate Constitution Day with Instagram Trivia. Already this year, the Chapter has co-sponsored a movie screening of \"My Name is Pauli Murray\" with other Howard student organizations.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Chapter has substantial programming in the works. On September 27th, the Chapter is hosting a SCOTUS Preview with leading constitutional scholars Professor Tiffany Wright, Supervising Attorney of the Howard Civil Rights Clinic, and Professor Justin Hansford, constitutional law expert (and Howard ACS Faculty Advisor).\n\nThis semester, their Vice President, Kufere Laing, will also be working to establish a Howard ACS Constitutional Law blog to provide members with the opportunity to get published outside of the traditional Journals and Law Reviews, as the students believe Howard's contributions to constitutional law is often overlooked.\n\nNext spring, they will be hosting a Black Federal Judges panel which will feature trail-blazing federal judges to share their journeys to the bench and discuss the ways in which they use the Constitution as a tool to maintain a fair and just judiciary system.\n\nThe Chapter would like to thank its Faculty Advisors, Professor Justin Hansford and Professor Lisa Crooms-Robinson, for their support.\n\n5/24/2021\n\nBrooklyn Law School\n\nThe Brooklyn Law School ACS Student Chapter is thrilled and honored to be recognized as ACS National’s Student Chapter of the Week.\n\nThe ACS Chapter at Brooklyn Law School continued to grow in its second year as a chapter, by increasing its membership and hosting a wide range of events throughout the year. The Chapter planned events that covered the Supreme Court docket, disability rights, excessive force, impeachment, and how the Supreme Court is being reshaped. They were also able to collaborate with the incredible ACS Student Chapters at Cornell, NYU, New York Law School, and St. John’s University on fantastic events that focused on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Brooklyn Law ACS Chapter is very thankful to Judge Carlton Reeves of the Southern District of Mississippi for headlining a fascinating panel event on qualified immunity and civil rights. The Chapter would also like to thank the Brooklyn Law School chapter of the Disability Advocacy Law Students Association and CCIT-NYC for partnering to organize a disability rights event.\n\nThe graduating E-Board is very proud of the Chapter’s accomplishments during the last year and is excited to see what the incoming E-Board will accomplish in the future.\n\nFinally, the Chapter would like to thank its Faculty Advisor, Professor William Araiza for helping start the Chapter and for continually providing support to making the Chapter a success.\n\n5/17/2021\n\nWashington University in St. Louis School of Law\n\nThe Washington University in St. Louis Student Chapter is honored to be named the ACS National Student Chapter of the Week. This honor marks the end of a successful year of programming, service, and campus education. While being fully remote presented unique challenges to the university as a whole, the Chapter took it as an opportunity to bring in incredible speakers from their community and beyond. For instance, the Chapter was fort"
