        "text": "There are \"significant gaps\" between Israel and Hamas, Israeli war cabinet member says after Hamas response\n\nThere were “significant gaps” between Israel and Hamas, Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz said Monday after Hamas accepted a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal mediated by Qatar and Egypt.\n\nWorking for the return of Israeli hostages is a “war goal” and a “supreme moral duty,” he added.\n\n“The negotiating team and the professionals continue to work every minute and every moment. … Every decision will be brought to the War Cabinet — there will be no political consideration.”\n\nHamas agreed to a different proposal than one Israel helped craft, sources say\n\nHamas on Monday agreed to a framework proposal, which diverges from the one Israel had helped craft with Egypt more than a week ago, a senior Israeli and senior US official said.\n\nThe latest proposal calls for an end to the war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will not accept, the senior American official said.\n\nThe senior Israeli official said the Israeli government was sending a working-level delegation to meet with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in order to better understand the latest proposal and determine whether a deal can be forged.\n\n\"I am leaving for the unknown\": Palestinians told to evacuate Rafah describe their fear and despair\n\nPalestinians leaving eastern Rafah after the Israel Defense Forces called on people to evacuate have been describing their fear and despair to a CNN stringer in the area.\n\nMohammed Ghanem and his wife were pushing strollers piled high with belongings.\n\nFaisal Barbakh was on a bicycle:\n\nVideos from the area showed trucks full of people’s belongings driving through the streets, which became increasingly crowded as the day wore on.\n\nMalek and Yousef, two boys, were making their way out on bicycles, carrying their bags. One said:\n\nMany of those leaving have been previously displaced. One man told CNN it’s his fourth time being displaced.\n\n“From Nuseirat to Khan Younis, then to Rafah, and now another one. I don’t know where I am heading.”\n\nIranian foreign minister says Hamas senior leader told him ball is now in Israel's court\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said he held a telephone call with Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’ political wing, on Monday after the group accepted a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar.\n\n“Now the ball is in the opposite court,” Haniyeh said during the call, the minister wrote on X.\n\n“We are honest in our intentions,” Haniyeh had said, according to the minister.\n\nIran has been a supporter of Hamas and several other organizations across the region. See more below.\n\nHamas' announcement must pave way for return of hostages, families say in a statement\n\nHamas’ announcement accepting a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar “must pave the way for the return of the 132 hostages held captive by Hamas for the past 7 months,” the Hostages Families Forum said in a statement.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hostage families and their supporters took to the streets as they called on the government to accept the proposal. A similar protest took place in Jerusalem, as demonstrators chanted: “Nothing is more important, every hostage must return.”\n\nRemember: Israeli officials believe 128 hostages taken in the October 7 attacks remain in Gaza, and that at least 34 of them are dead.\n\nThe post was updated with reporting on reactions on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\nChina's leader calls for \"a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire in Gaza\"\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire in Gaza on Monday as he pleaded for ” lasting peace in the Middle East” during a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nXi emphasized that the prolonged conflict is a test of human conscience and stated the international community had to take action.\n\nHe reiterated China’s stance on Ukraine, stating that China has been actively promoting peace. He added that China is against any parties using the Ukraine crisis to incite a “new Cold War.”\n\nIn addition to remarks on political matters, Xi called for closer relations with France in various fields, including agriculture, finance, aerospace, nuclear power, and cultural exchanges. According to Xi, China and France have signed a total of 18 interdepartmental cooperation agreements during the visit.\n\nChinese diplomat Wang Kejian met with Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar in March. Beijing did not name or condemn Hamas in the wake of the October 7 attacks. Since then, it has condemned the war and been a vocal proponent of an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of a “two-state” solution.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson expresses concern about evacuation from parts of Rafah\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller expressed concern about evacuations from Rafah after the Israeli military issued a call for Palestinians in “a significant portion” of the southern Gazan city to move.\n\nRemember: Humanitarian aid officials have said there is little sign that the area where Palestinians have been directed, Al Mawasi, has the infrastructure to support people fleeing there. One worker from the organization Mercy Corps described it as an area “with no signs of life, no electricity, no water, and few houses.”\n\nMiller again said the US would not support a full-scale military operation in Rafah, but would support a limited operation. He would not say if the Israeli government has said it would carry out a limited operation.\n\nTurkey's president urges Israel to accept ceasefire deal proposed by Hamas\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed Hamas’ decision to agree to a ceasefire deal and urged Israel to do the same.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of Hamas, had spoken on the phone with Erdogan on Monday, informing him of the group’s decision to accept the deal, according to a Hamas press release. It’s unclear whether Hamas has agreed to the proposal as outlined last week, or a revised version of it.\n\nIsrael received Hamas response in the last 30 minutes\n\nThe mediators in negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza submitted Hamas’ formal response to Israel within the last half-hour, CNN has learned.\n\nThe Israeli government is now reviewing it.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office has declined to comment on Hamas’ response at this stage.\n\nHamas official says Israeli operation in Rafah will be \"no picnic\" for IDF\n\nA senior official from Hamas’ political bureau has said an Israeli military offensive in Rafah, in southern Gaza, will “not be a picnic” for Israeli troops.\n\n“Any military operation in Rafah will put the negotiations in jeopardy, and it will not be a picnic for the enemy army,” Izzat Al-Rashq posted on Telegram, on Monday. “Netanyahu and his government bear full responsibility.”\n\nIsraeli forces told Palestinians to leave Rafah ahead of a looming ground attack, sparking widespread fears for the safety of more than one million people who were forced to flee there from Israel’s bombardment.\n\nAl-Rashq issued the statement as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas appeared to reach an impasse, as both parties failed to reach a deal over the weekend.\n\nBritish leader \"deeply concerned\" about looming Israeli ground invasion\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told local media he is “deeply concerned” about the possibility of an Israeli ground attack into Rafah.\n\nIsraeli forces told Palestinians in eastern Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” a day after the country’s defense minister said troops in Gaza should expect “intense action” in the city “in the near future.”\n\nThe UK leader urged all parties – “particularly Hamas” – to find an agreement for a “temporary pause” to release hostages, and allow more aid to go into the Gaza Strip, as negotiations for a truce between Israel and Hamas appeared to stall over the weekend.\n\nSunak added, “That will allow us to build a sustainable ceasefire. That’s the best way to end the suffering.” Other allies of Israel took a firmer stance following the evacuation order on Monday, with French and EU leaders stressing “firm opposition” to Israel’s threatened ground invasion.\n\nIsraeli ambassador expects US to stop funding UN if vote recognizing a Palestinian state passes\n\nIsrael’s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan said on Monday that he expects the United States to stop funding the United Nations if it votes to grant the Palestinian Authority (PA) full UN membership.\n\nIn a statement issued days ahead of Friday’s General Assembly meeting, Erdan said passing a resolution granting status and rights of a state to the PA is against the UN Charter. If successful, he said he expects the US to “completely” stop its funding to the UN and its institutions, citing American law.\n\nErdan also said the resolution, if passed, will not change the situation on the ground but instead will “prove how disconnected the UN is from reality and rewards terrorism.”\n\nFriday’s meeting comes after the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution in April that would have recognized a Palestinian state.\n\nHuman rights chief warns Israeli relocation order is a \"serious violation of international law\"\n\nIsrael’s order to relocate Palestinians from Rafah, in southern Gaza to the coastal town of Al-Mawasi is “beyond alarming,” the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) warned on Monday.\n\nJan Egeland described dire conditions in Al-Mawasi, including a lack of stable security, adequate accommodation or space for Palestinians forced to evacuate from Rafah, where Israeli forces have long-threatened a sprawling ground offensive.\n\n“The area is already overstretched and devoid of vital services. It lacks the capacity to house the number of people currently seeking refuge in Rafah, with no assurances of safety, proper accommodation or return once hostilities end for those forced to relocate,” Egeland said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military told people in eastern Rafah to “evacuate immediately” on Monday, after Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant told troops in Gaza to expect “intense action” in the southern city “in the near future.”\n\n‘Horrific suffering’: The NRC secretary-general said an Israeli offensive in Rafah “will cause potential mass atrocities,” adding it could “lead to the deadliest phase of this conflict, inflicting horrific suffering on approximately 1.4 million displaced civilians in the area.” Egeland urged Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire deal and release hostages, adding, “History’s verdict will be harsh on the men who continued a war that kills countless women and children.”\n\nStudents set up pro-Palestinian encampments at Oxford and Cambridge universities\n\nScholars at two prestigious universities in the United Kingdom pitched pro-Palestinian encampments on their college grounds on Monday.\n\nPhotos emerged on social media showing several tents with Palestinian flags erected outside the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, and at King’s College at the University of Cambridge, as students called on their leadership to sever ties with Israel.\n\nCampaign group, Oxford Action for Palestine, set up the tents at 11 p.m. ET (4 a.m. local time) on Monday outside the museum, which they said symbolizes the “relationship that Oxford has to colonial projects.”\n\nA banner showed the list of demands from student protesters which include: the disclosure of university finances, the divestment from Israeli businesses, an overhaul of the university’s investment policy and support towards Palestinian-led rebuilding of educational facilities in Gaza. In the statement, the group said they “stand in solidarity” with pro-Palestinian student protests across the globe.\n\nStudents, many of whom are wearing facemasks and scarves, created signs and banners. One of these reads: “There are no universities left in Gaza.”\n\nMore than 80% of schools in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the UN. More than 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors have been killed in Gaza, the UN reported.\n\n\"Rafah is now a city of children, who have nowhere safe to go in Gaza:\" UNICEF warns\n\nChildren in Rafah are “especially vulnerable” and more than 600,000 could face “further catastrophe,” the United Nations’ children charity UNICEF warned in a press release on Monday, after Israel issued evacuation warnings for people in eastern Rafah to move to the west of the Gaza strip.\n\n“Rafah is now a city of children, who have nowhere safe to go in Gaza,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell, according to the release.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) urged people in eastern Rafah to “evacuate immediately” on Monday, a day after Israel’s defense minister Yoav Galant told troops in Gaza to expect “intense action” in the southern city “in the near future.”\n\nThe evacuation was in preparation for “a limited-scale operation in the area of Eastern Rafah,” IDF international spokesperson Col. Nadav Shoshani said at a news conference Monday.\n\nChildren make up about half of Rafah’s current population of 1.2 million, “many of whom have been displaced multiple times and are sheltering in tents or informal and unstable housing,” according to UNICEF.\n\nThe UN body said children “are being disproportionately killed and injured,” citing the Palestinian Ministry of Health that says more than 14,000 children have been killed since October 2023.\n\n\"Where shall people go?\" Displaced Palestinians in Rafah are fearful after Israel's orders\n\nDisplaced Palestinians have spoken of their fears following the evacuation orders given by Israel to leave the southern city of Rafah and move to the west of the strip.\n\nIn video obtained for CNN, Eweida is seen gathering aid boxes, blankets and water from his tent in the Jneina camp east of Rafah, where he lived with his two sons.\n\nAnother father, Haitham Jaroun is seen in the footage carrying a mattress on a bicycle as his small son walks alongside him.\n\n“They say (Al-)Mawasi and Khan Younis are safe.

Al Jazeera’s cable channel in Israel now displays a message stating, “In accordance with the government’s decision, Al Jazeera channel broadcasts were stopped in Israel.”\n\nSome context: Netanyahu’s government has long complained about Al Jazeera’s operations, alleging anti-Israeli bias and accusing the network of being a “mouthpiece for Hamas,” and the closure follows the passage of a sweeping law allowing the government to ban foreign networks perceived as posing a threat to national security.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nNetanyahu denounces possible ICC warrants against Israeli leaders\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday warned the International Criminal Court against potentially issuing arrest warrants against Israeli leaders and commanders as a result of its investigation into the war in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu’s comments, in a televised speech for the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day, appeared to be a reference to Israeli media reports that several government officials, including the prime minister, are concerned that such arrest warrants might be imminent.\n\nWhile the ICC, based in The Hague, has declined to comment about any arrest warrants that could come out of its investigation into the war in Gaza, rumors have swirled in the Israeli press in recent weeks that the court could target Netanyahu and other key Israeli officials.\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court’s jurisdiction. That has not previously stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nRead the full story."
