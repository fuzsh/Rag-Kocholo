        "text": "More than 60% of homes in Gaza have been destroyed. Here's what you should know\n\nSince October 7, 61% of homes and residential units in Gaza have been destroyed, according to the Hamas government in the enclave.\n\nOf the 305,000 affected units, 52,000 are completely destroyed and 253,000 are partially damaged, an official from the Hamas government media office said in a news conference from Gaza on Tuesday.\n\nHere are other headlines you should know:\n\nDevelopments on the ground: The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday that its troops are “in the heart of Khan Younis” and that troops are encircling the city located in southern Gaza. Video and witness accounts indicate there have been multiple strikes in the area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza Tuesday as well, with many casualties being taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Also, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that the IDF should retain control for the disarmament of Gaza after the war, rejecting the idea that an international force could be responsible for security in the Gaza Strip. And US officials expect the current phase of Israel’s ground operation of Gaza targeting the southern end of the strip to last several weeks before Israel transitions, possibly by January, to a lower-intensity, hyper-localized strategy that narrowly targets specific Hamas militants and leaders, multiple senior administration officials tell CNN.\n\nHostages: Israeli’s public broadcaster, Channel 11, obtained audio from a private meeting between former hostages and Israel’s security cabinet. In the audio, former hostages detailed the trying conditions of their captivity. Also, some Israeli hostages were given anti-anxiety medication prior to their release, an official from Israel’s health ministry told the Knesset, or parliament, on Tuesday.\n\nDevelopments out of Lebanon: Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister wants to spare his country “from any major war that might occur” as the conflict between Israel and Hamas is leading to the fear of rising regional tensions. Meanwhile, a Lebanese soldier was killed and three others were wounded in an Israeli attack on Tuesday, the Lebanese army said on social media.\n\nHumanitarian aid and support: Fifty trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing Tuesday, including two trucks specifically carrying fuel, according to an Egyptian official. Additionally, the US military airlifted another 36,000 pounds of critical supplies to Gazans on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday. Meanwhile, power has been returning gradually to Gaza following Monday’s blackout, according to PalTel, the only remaining major telecommunications operator in the strip. Also, Israel’s prime minister said his country’s war efforts in Gaza are supported by its humanitarian effort. Netanyahu said Israel is allowing in the “bare minimum” of fuel trucks and also is aiming to prevent disease outbreaks in the enclave that could halt the ground operation. Elsewhere, the Norwegian Refugee Council has been forced to halt nearly all aid operations in Gaza “due to the bombardment, the chaos and the panic,” said its secretary general, Jan Egeland. And Mary Robinson, former United Nations high commissioner for human rights and chair of The Elders group, has urged the US to reconsider its military aid to Israel, calling for restraint from “those who have power.”\n\nInternational involvement: US President Joe Biden’s administration has begun to stress publicly that the United States’ efforts to shape Israel’s military operations to be more surgical and deliberate to limit civilian casualties in Gaza have been fruitful. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is working “around the clock” to pinpoint and stymie potential attacks by individuals inspired by the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Additionally, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new policy on Tuesday to prevent extremist Israeli settlers responsible for violence in the West Bank from coming to the United States. And, during a trip to Egypt Tuesday, US Aid Administrator Samantha Power announced the US will provide an additional $21 million in aid to Gaza.\n\nUN rejects idea of acceptable ratios for Gaza's civilian deaths after Israeli military's comments\n\nThe United Nations has described the remark by an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson to evaluate civilian deaths in Gaza in “ratios” as “tasteless”.\n\nOn Monday, Jonathan Conricus, IDF spokesperson, told CNN that a ratio of two Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza for every Hamas militant is a “tremendously positive ratio” given the challenges of urban combat.\n\nThe UN’s focus is on avoiding any civilian deaths, Dujarric said, during an exchange at his daily press briefing on Tuesday — though he acknowledged this has not been successful in Gaza.\n\nAlmost 16,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to figures compiled by the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza\n\nChair of The Elders group urges US to reconsider its military assistance to Israel\n\nMary Robinson, former United Nations high commissioner for human rights and chair of The Elders group, has urged the US to reconsider its military aid to Israel, calling for restraint from “those who have power.”\n\nRobinson spoke to CNN’s Isa Soares in the wake of a statement released by The Elders, describing Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks as “disproportionate” and the “level of inhumanity” it is carrying out in Gaza as “intolerable.”\n\nThe Elders, founded by Nelson Mandela, is a grouping of mostly former world leaders “working for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet,” according to the group’s website.\n\nSince 2016, the US has provided $3.8 billion annually in military assistance to Israel as part of a 10-year Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries.\n\nRobinson highlighted that ordinary Palestinian civilians who are “getting caught up” and killed in the conflict in Gaza are “not Hamas terrorists.”\n\n“The UN is urging, the UN High Commission here in Geneva is urging, we are all urging restraint. But words aren’t enough. And those who have power to restrain must now restrain,” Robinson said. “And that in particular is the United States.”\n\nRobinson urged the US to exercise this restraint by publicly voicing its disapproval that its “military arsenal is being used this way” in Gaza. “It hasn’t said that explicitly. It should,” Robinson added.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nIsrael revoked visa of UN humanitarian coordinator, minister of foreign affairs says\n\nIsrael has revoked the visa of the United Nations humanitarian coordinator due to the “bias of the UN,” according to the Israeli minister of foreign affairs.\n\n“We will no longer be silent in the face of the bias of the UN,” Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nCohen said Lynn Hastings, who is the deputy special coordinator for the Middle East peace process and the UN resident coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, failed to speak out against Hamas for the acts committed during its October 7 attack.\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary general, said Hasting had her visa revoked last week. Still, Dujarric said the UN secretary general has “full confidence” in Hastings.\n\n“I can only reiterate the Secretary-General’s full confidence in Ms. Hastings, the way she’s conducted herself, and the way she’s done her work,” Dujarric said.\n\nIDF concedes it struck Lebanese soldiers while targeting Hezbollah in \"self defense\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces admitted Tuesday that it struck Lebanese soldiers while acting in “self defense” against Hezbollah, the IDF said on social media.\n\nThe IDF claimed it “operated in self defense” against what they said was an imminent threat coming from Lebanon. The threat came from near the southern Lebanese village of Odaisseh in the Marjayoun district, where the IDF says a Hezbollah launch area and observation point exists.\n\nAccording to the Lebanese Armed Forces, one soldier was killed and three more were injured.\n\nThe IDF said they were notified after the strike that soldiers from the Lebanese Armed Forces had been harmed.\n\nThe IDF added that the incident is under review.\n\nIt is believed to be the first fatality of the Lebanese Armed Forces since the escalation of the conflict this year.\n\nNetanyahu says war efforts are supported by humanitarian efforts — but aid groups say it's not enough\n\nIsrael’s prime minister said his country’s war efforts in Gaza are supported by its humanitarian effort. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is allowing in the “bare minimum” of fuel trucks and also is aiming to prevent disease outbreaks in the enclave that could halt the ground operation.\n\nAnswering a question about Israel potentially losing leverage against Hamas if it allows more humanitarian aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said: “The war efforts are supported by the humanitarian effort … this is because we follow laws of war because we know that if there would be a collapse — diseases, pandemics, and groundwater infections — it will stop the fighting.”\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday that Israel has “the right to demand certain things” concerning humanitarian aid, including allowing the Red Cross to visit Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza “or at least allow the transfer of some related elements such as medicines” to the hostages.\n\nMeanwhile, international aid organizations have argued that the amount of aid reaching Gaza is insufficient.\n\nLynn Hastings, United Nations humanitarian coordinator, said on Monday that a “more hellish scenario is about to unfold” if more aid is not allowed to enter Gaza.\n\nMirjana Spoljaric Egger, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said during a visit to Gaza on Monday that “an unimpeded and regular flow of aid must be allowed to enter Gaza.”\n\nIsraeli health ministry official says some hostages were given anti-anxiety medication prior to release\n\nSome Israelis held hostage by Hamas in Gaza were given anti-anxiety medication prior to their release, an official from Israel’s health ministry told the Knesset, or parliament, on Tuesday.\n\nClonex is the name in Israel for Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine that has a calming effect, and is used to treat seizures and relieve anxiety.\n\nMizrahi did not provide evidence for the claim.\n\nMore than 100 people were released by Hamas during truce. Here's what we know about them\n\nAn 8-year-old soccer fan who enjoys playing video games. Young-adult siblings dancing away at a desert music festival. A 67-year-old agricultural expert and her relatives enjoying a family gathering.\n\nThese were a few of the 105 people who were released by Hamas during a temporary truce with Israel, which started on November 24 and ended early December 1.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, which was finalized after weeks of tense negotiations, Israel released three imprisoned Palestinians for every Israeli hostage allowed to leave Gaza. The framework saw 80 Israelis, some of whom hold dual citizenships, released from captivity. By the end of the pause in hostilities, 240 Palestinians had been freed from Israeli prisons, mainly women and minors, and many of whom had been detained but never charged.\n\nAdditionally, a number of foreign nationals — 23 Thai citizens, one Filipino and one dual Israeli-Russian citizen — were freed as part of separate negotiations outside the truce.\n\nThe temporary agreement, accompanied by an uptick in desperately needed humanitarian aid entering the besieged enclave, represented the first major diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict.\n\nClick here to learn more about each hostage who has returned from Gaza so far.\n\nVideo and eyewitness accounts indicate multiple strikes in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza\n\nVideo and witness accounts indicate there have been multiple strikes in the area of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on Tuesday, with many casualties being taken to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.\n\nDozens of videos CNN commissioned from a freelance journalist on the ground in Deir al-Balah show men digging through rubble in the aftermath of a strike, which destroyed a large, multi-story building.\n\nIn one video, a blanket appears to be covering a dead body as people at the scene prepare to move the body. In another video, men are seen searching for someone trapped under the concrete, and one man says he can hear a voice inside the rubble.\n\nThe spokesperson of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, Dr. Khalil Al Daqran, told CNN that more than 90 bodies arrived at the medical facility on Tuesday, in addition to 130 people who were injured. He said more casualties are arriving.\n\n“Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is the only hospital in the central area and cannot accommodate such a large number of people, especially considering that massacres against our people are still ongoing,” he said.\n\nOne video received by CNN from a freelance journalist showed a stream of ambulances and private cars arriving at the medical facility, and several injured children being carried in. One dazed woman covered in dust is also helped into the hospital.\n\nMany of those carried into the hospital appeared to have severe injuries, with some lying on the hospital floor as medics treated them.\n\nAnother video filmed in Deir al-Balah shows a Palestine Red Crescent Society ambulance fleeing the scene of nearby artillery fire, according to the aid agency.\n\nThe PRCS shared the video, which was filmed by a local journalist in Gaza, alongside the caption: “Horrific scenes for Israeli tank artillery targets the vicinity of two PRCS ambulances today while attending to casualties in Deir Al-Balah, South of #Gaza.”\n\nCNN geolocated the video to the southern part of the city.\n\nThe video shows people running into the ambulance as blasts are heard nearby, as one person says, “The bombing is directly on us.” Through the window of the ambulance, a large plume of smoke can be seen rising in the distance.\n\nCNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.\n\nAl Daqran also called for more medical supplies to enter the enclave and for “Egypt to open Rafah (border crossing) to transfer the critically ill cases in Gaza and save their lives, especially due to the lack of medical aid in Gaza.”\n\nOn Tuesday, seven injured Palestinians, along with seven accompanying individuals, crossed into Egypt to receive medical treatment, as observed by a journalist working with CNN at the Rafah crossing.\n\nLebanon's prime minister says he is working to spare his country from \"any major war\"\n\nLebanon’s caretaker prime minister wants to spare his country “from any major war that might occur” as the conflict between Israel and Hamas is leading to the fear of rising regional tensions.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Mikati said he is working with international partners, including the United States and the United Nations, to ensure Lebanon doesn’t get wrapped up in “any war that we do not know where it will lead.”\n\nMikati said that Lebanon continues to support the Palestinian cause and he stressed that any guarantees to avoid a wider war fall on Israel.\n\nThe Lebanese official also said negotiations will take place “in the coming months” to solve the ongoing border disputes with Israel with the support of the US, Europe and the UN.\n\n“This issue takes a fundamental role with the aim of sparing Lebanon from any war that we do not know where it will lead. We hope that in the next three months we will reach a stage of complete stability on our borders,” Mikati said.\n\nSome background: Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon’s powerful militant group, have been exchanging frequent fire across the border for two months, using rockets, artillery, drones and airstrikes.\n\nA Lebanese soldier was killed and three others were wounded in an Israeli attack on Tuesday, the Lebanese army said on social media. It appears to be the first death of a Lebanese soldier since the two groups have been exchanging fire.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including infrastructure and weapons storage military posts on Tuesday morning, adding it identified several launches from Lebanon into Israel that fell into open areas.\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson seeks to clarify comments made on civilian casualties in Gaza\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces spokesperson who on Monday told CNN that killing two Palestinian civilians for every Hamas militant in Gaza would be a “tremendously positive ratio” on Tuesday said that the IDF had not confirmed that those numbers were accurate.\n\nJonathan Conricus, the spokesperson, said that he had only meant to say that he had seen a news report attributing those numbers to an unnamed Israeli official. “I confirmed that I saw the report. I didn’t confirm the numbers yet,” he told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nAFP, citing a briefing for foreign media by senior Israeli military officials, reported on Monday that the Israeli military believes that about two civilians have been killed in Gaza for each Hamas militant.\n\nAFP reported that the Israeli military official, when asked to confirm reports that around 5,000 Hamas militants had been killed, replied: “The numbers are more or less right.”\n\nConricus said that the IDF wants to get accurate numbers of civilians and combatants killed, adding that he thought the number would be known before the end of the war.\n\nAnd he said the Israeli military was talking about active combatants when it counted how many Hamas fighters it killed: “Our definition is combatants, people who are fighting.”\n\nHe repeated Israel’s regular assertion that the IDF was aiming to kill “as low as possible a number of civilians” and blamed Hamas for using people as human shields.\n\nHe insisted again that a ratio of two civilians killed per combatant was better than seen in urban combat in places like Raqqa and Deir Ezzor in Syria, but added, “Every loss of life is sad, I should have chosen my words more carefully.”\n\nBlinken announces policy to restrict visas to US for extremists in West Bank\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a new policy on Tuesday to prevent extremist Israeli settlers responsible for violence in the West Bank from coming to the United States.\n\nThe State Department will be able to apply the policy to both Israelis and Palestinians who are responsible for attacks in the West Bank, Blinken said.\n\nBlinken did not name any individuals who would be subject to the visa restrictions, nor did he say how many would be included in the initial tranche of restrictions.\n\nThe new policy is expected “to impact dozens of individuals and potentially their family members,” State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday.\n\n“Any other Israeli citizen who is designated as a result of this program, but does not currently have a visa, will not be notified. If they want to travel to the United States and they apply through ESTA, which is the way that it works if you’re currently a Visa Waiver Program Country, that application will be rejected,” he said.\n\nThe background: Administration officials have signaled for weeks that they would take such action as violence in the West Bank has intensified in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nIn his engagements with Israeli officials since that attack, Blinken has called on the Netanyahu government to do more to hold the settlers responsible for the violence accountable.\n\nBlinken said that the US will continue to engage with Israeli leadership to “make clear that Israel must take additional measures to protect Palestinian civilians from extremist attacks.”\n\nThe secretary of state also said the US will continue to “engage the Palestinian Authority to make clear it must do more to curb Palestinian attacks against Israelis,” he said, noting that leaders in Israel and those with the Palestinian Authority “have the responsibility to uphold stability in the West Bank. Instability in the West Bank both harms the Israeli and Palestinian people and threatens Israel’s national security interests. Those responsible for it must be held accountable.”\n\nBenny Gantz, Israel war cabinet member and former defense minister, on Tuesday cautioned the US against its rhetoric referring to extremist Israeli settlers responsible for violence in the West Bank, and urged the international community not to use the term “settler violence.”\n\nDuring a news conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, Gantz responded to a question about the US policy, saying: “Concerning the US sanctions, I repeatedly ask everyone, also from my American counterparts, not to use the term ‘settler violence,’ because it does not represent the citizens of Israel. It does not represent the residents of the communities in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank], 99% of them are normative and abide the law.”\n\nThis post has been updated with comments from Benny Gantz.\n\nTamar Michaelis contributed to this report.\n\nIDF is \"now encircling\" southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, chief of the general staff says\n\nThe Israeli military is encircling the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of the general staff said on Tuesday.\n\n“Sixty days after the war began, our forces are now encircling the Khan Yunis area in the southern Gaza Strip,” Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said on Tuesday. “Simultaneously, we continue to secure our accomplishments in the northern Gaza Strip.”\n\nEarlier Tuesday, the IDF said that its forces were operating “in the heart” of Khan Younis, the territory’s second-largest city.\n\nIn the north: Israeli troops have also “completed the encirclement” of the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, Israel’s military said Tuesday, as it seeks to complete its offensive operations against Hamas militants in the north of the enclave.\n\nHalevi said that the IDF was now entering the “third phase of the ground operations,” though he did not specify what that meant. “We have secured many Hamas strongholds in the northern Gaza Strip, and now we are operating against its strongholds in the south,” he said.\n\nIn response to a journalist’s question about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Halevi pointed to the aid trickling into Gaza, saying, “We’re making great efforts, in accordance to the government’s decision and the international law.”\n\n50 aid trucks entered Gaza and 7 injured people crossed into Egypt through Rafah, officials on site say\n\nFifty trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing Tuesday, including two trucks specifically carrying fuel, according to an Egyptian official.\n\nBefore the October 7 attack, about 455 aid trucks were crossing into the area each day, according to the UN.\n\nMeanwhile, seven injured Palestinians, along with seven accompanying individuals, have crossed into Egypt to receive medical treatment, as observed by a journalist working with CNN at the Rafah crossing.\n\nFurthermore, seven buses transporting foreign nationals have been seen arriving in Egypt from Gaza. The exact number of foreign nationals on these buses is currently unclear.\n\nThis post has been updated with the number of aid trucks to cross into Gaza.\n\nCNN team witnesses 2 outgoing rockets from southern Lebanon toward Israel\n\nA CNN team in southern Lebanon counted at least five outgoing rockets fired from Lebanon toward Israel on Tuesday evening local time.\n\nThe rockets were launched not far from the town of Marjayoun, in the direction of the Israeli border town of Metula.\n\nThe CNN team witnessed at least two Israeli interceptors apparently hitting some of the projectiles.\n\nHezbollah said on Telegram on Tuesday it targeted IDF troops near the border with Lebanon in various locations.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the border for two months.\n\nLebanese army reports apparent first soldier death as Israel and Hezbollah engage in crossfire\n\nA Lebanese soldier was killed and three others were wounded in an Israeli attack on Tuesday, the Lebanese army said on social media.\n\nIt appears to be the first death of a Lebanese soldier as Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon’s powerful militant group, have been exchanging frequent fire across the border for two months, using rockets, artillery, drones and airstrikes.\n\nCNN has reviewed Lebanese army statements so far, and this is the first mentioned fatality. In addition, a security source with knowledge of the military situation in Lebanon confirmed the first death of a Lebanese Ministry of National Defense member.\n\nThe attack happened near Lebanon’s border with Israel, according to the Lebanese National News Agency (NNA).\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Israeli forces shelled areas in southern Lebanon, NNA reported.\n\nA CNN team in the Marjayoun area of southern Lebanon reported hearing loud booms in the morning and filmed a suspected Israeli drone over the area.\n\nNNA reported a drone strike in the central-southern sector near the Lebanese-Israeli border, plus shelling in the southeastern, central and western areas of the border.\n\nWhat Israel is saying: Israeli Defense Forces fighter jets struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including infrastructure and weapons storage military posts, the IDF said Tuesday morning, adding it identified several launches from Lebanon into Israel that fell into open areas.\n\nHezbollah said on social media it had targeted IDF troops near the border with Lebanon in various locations.\n\nIsraeli military vehicles seen in southern Gaza as locals search for somewhere to go. Here's the latest\n\nTop UN officials have warned of an “apocalyptic” situation in Gaza as people are left with no safe place to go, while Israel’s military expands its campaign in the territory.\n\nThe warning comes as satellite images show dozens of Israeli armored vehicles now operating in southern Gaza.\n\nThe images, obtained by CNN Tuesday, show the vehicles to the west of Salah El-Din Street, Gaza’s main north-south route, roughly six kilometers (3.7 miles) north of central Khan Younis.\n\nIsrael has called on Palestinians in some parts of southern Gaza to leave, issuing digital maps that residents have told CNN are either confusing or to which they don’t have access because of a lack of electricity and internet connectivity.\n\nEarlier in the war, the the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) encouraged Gazans to move to the southern part of the Strip for their safety, while committing to strike at Hamas “wherever it is.”\n\nHere are today’s other headlines:\n\nGazans hunt for food: An apparent Israeli airstrike on Monday has destroyed the Al-Baraka bakery in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah, one of the few left in the Strip. Without it, people are digging through rubble — desperately searching for food.\n\nDeath toll in Gaza: At least 15,800 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since October 7, according to a report published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah on Tuesday, which cites sources from the Hamas-controlled enclave. The report added that a total of 40,900 people have been injured, and the majority of wounded people are children, women, and the elderly.\n\nRefugee camp surrounded: Israeli troops have “completed the encirclement” of the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, Israel’s military said Tuesday, as it seeks to complete its offensive operations against Hamas militants in the north of the territory. The camp, Gaza’s largest, has been hit by renewed Israeli strikes in recent days following the end of a week-long pause in the conflict on Friday.\n\nMore UN workers killed: The United Nations relief agency in Gaza, UNRWA, has confirmed the death of 19 more workers. Their deaths bring the total number of UNRWA staff killed in Gaza since October 7 to 130.\n\nBodies lie in hospital: There are 108 corpses lying – some unclaimed – at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, according to the territory’s Hamas-controlled health ministry. Israeli troops have been advancing toward the facility, with heavy gunfire and explosions around its vicinity over the past 24 hours.\n\nMan killed in refugee camp: A 25-year-old Palestinian man has been killed by Israeli military fire during renewed clashes at the Qalandia refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli troops killed: Three Israeli soldiers have died in combat in Gaza, bringing the total number of IDF deaths in the strip to 72 since the ground offensive began, it said Tuesday.\n\nHostages remain: The number of hostages believed to be in Gaza now stands at 138, the Israeli prime minister’s office said Tuesday, citing its office of the Coordinator for the Hostages and Missing. The number includes foreign nationals.\n\nSatellite imagery shows dozens of Israeli armored vehicles in southern Gaza strip\n\nDozens of Israeli armored vehicles are operating in southern Gaza, satellite images from Sunday provided by PlanetLabs to CNN show.\n\nThe images, obtained by CNN Tuesday, show the vehicles to the west of Salah El-Din Street, Gaza’s main north-south route, roughly six kilometers (3.7 miles) north of central Khan Younis.\n\nTracks on the ground visible in the images show the Israeli armored vehicles had driven to the location in a near-direct line from the Israel-Gaza border in the east.\n\nOn Monday, CNN geolocated an Al Jazeera video showing an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tank in southern Gaza, the first apparent confirmation of an IDF operation south of Wadi Gaza in the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. The video shared on Sunday showed an Israeli tank 1.5 kilometers south of the location of vehicles in the PlanetLabs imagery.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post came to the same conclusion in their analysis of the satellite imagery.\n\nIDF says no operations were ongoing near Gaza hospital when 10 were reportedly killed on Sunday\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has responded to claims that 10 people were killed close to the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza on Sunday night.\n\nOn Monday, the head of pediatrics at the medical center told CNN a strike had targeted the northern entrance of the facility, and 10 people had been killed.\n\nCNN was unable to confirm the cause of the explosion and reached out to the IDF for a comment on strikes in the vicinity of the hospital.\n\nIn response, the IDF said “contrary to claims, Kamal Adwan Hospital was not attacked by IDF forces at the time in question,” adding “the IDF did not ask the hospital to evacuate.”\n\nThe IDF also said that a “few days ago, hospital officials contacted IDF representatives and asked to coordinate an evacuation. The IDF responded positively to the request.”\n\nIt’s unclear why an evacuation did not take place.\n\nSeveral people at the hospital claimed that people trying to leave had been shot at.\n\nIn an audio message sent from the hospital to CNN, a journalist inside the facility, Mahmoud Al-Sabbah, said the facility was surrounded.\n\n“The situation is very dangerous and [there is] heavy fire gunfire. The Israeli tanks and vehicles are advancing towards the hospital and are one block away,” Al-Sabbah said. As he spoke, heavy fire could be heard in the background.\n\nWitnesses described the situation in the hospital as very difficult, with dozens of bodies lying outside in a hospital courtyard. There are also several thousand displaced people at the hospital, which is in an area that has seen extensive Israeli military operations since the end of the seven-day truce last Friday.\n\nCNN has contacted hospital authorities seeking their response.\n\nGazans dig through rubble of collapsed buildings. They are no longer searching for loved ones, but food\n\nOne man carries six jars of cooking oil as he struggles to walk across the rubble. Two little girls run as they each carry stacks of white paper, used to build fire for heat and cooking.\n\nA group of men argue, elbowing each other as they battle to find a bag of flour, some tea or even a forgotten blanket.\n\nThese are the scenes from the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah, where an apparent Israeli airstrike on Monday destroyed not only homes and streets, but also the neighborhood’s Al-Baraka bakery, one of the few still standing in the Strip.\n\nThe strike in Dier al-Balah occurred overnight, according to residents, and by morning men, women and children were digging through the rubble. But this time, the residents weren’t digging to find loved ones. They were desperately searching for food and other essential supplies.\n\nAs the Israel-Hamas war enters its ninth week, signs are emerging of social order breaking down, with reports of looting by people struggling to survive. Since October 9, Israel has blocked access to water, food and electricity in the Strip that is home to more than 2 million Palestinians.\n\nMore than 15,899 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel started its campaign there, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza.\n\nAl-Baraka bakery used to ease people’s suffering by providing much-needed bread, said Ibrahim Dabbour, a resident of Deir al-Balah. “The bakery should be outside of military operation,” he added.\n\nIn response to CNN questions about the bakery, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said Tuesday that “in stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.”\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n19 more UN workers killed in Gaza, relief agency says\n\nThe United Nations relief agency in Gaza — UNRWA – has confirmed the deaths of 19 more of its workers.\n\nIn total, “130 UNRWA colleagues have been killed since 7 October,” it said in a daily update.\n\nUNRWA did not provide further details on where and when the additional 19 people had been killed.\n\nThe agency said that nearly one million displaced people were sheltering in 99 of its facilities in central and southern Gaza, including the Khan Younis and Rafah areas.\n\nIt said one of its schools in Deir Al Balah in central Gaza had been damaged by a strike on Sunday, while another school in Khan Younis was damaged by a nearby strike, killing four internally displaced people.\n\nMeanwhile, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has dismissed reports that the agency may open new refugee camps in Rafah, on the Egyptian border, to which many thousands of internally displaced Gazans have fled.\n\n“Allegations that the United Nations has thousands of tents and is planning to open new refugee camps in Rafah are false,” he said.\n\n“There is no safe place in Gaza, whether in the south or the southwest, whether in Rafah or anywhere in what is unilaterally called the ‘safe zone.’”\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces has repeatedly referenced the planned creation of what it calls a safe zone in the far south of Gaza.\n\nMore than 100 bodies at Gaza's Kamal Adwan hospital, Hamas-controlled health ministry says\n\nThere are 108 corpses lying – some unclaimed – at the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, according to the territory’s Hamas-controlled health ministry.\n\nIsraeli troops have been advancing toward the facility, with heavy gunfire and explosions around its vicinity over the past 24 hours.\n\nA journalist inside the hospital, Mahmoud Al-Sabbah, sent CNN video Tuesday of about 30 bodies covered in white sheets in a courtyard.\n\nSeveral more bodies were piled on a cart because, he said, ambulances were unable to operate in the area. It’s unclear how long the bodies had been there, but he said family members were trying to identify loved ones.\n\nDr. Munir Al-Barsh, director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said there was no power supply at Kamal Adwan hospital, and there were more than 7,000 displaced people there. Surgery had become impossible because of the lack of power, he said.\n\nOnly four hospitals are operating in northern Gaza and about 55 ambulances are out of service, Al-Barsh said. He also claimed that while 400 injured people had been able to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing, more than 40,000 injured remained in the Strip.\n\nIn an audio message sent from the hospital to CNN, Al-Sabbah said the facility was surrounded.\n\nIn a separate video clip of about 30 seconds, the sound of gunfire and explosions is constant.\n\nAnother journalist at the hospital, Anas Al-Sharif, told CNN “the situation is very difficult.”\n\nCNN cannot verify the number of casualties at the hospital, where an unknown number of displaced civilians are also taking shelter.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday that operations “happening now, in the north of the Gaza Strip, will soon lead to the breaking of the entire area of Gaza City and the north of the Gaza Strip.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on operations in the vicinity of Kamal Adwan.\n\nGaza's Jabalya refugee camp is surrounded by troops, Israeli military says\n\nIsraeli troops have “completed the encirclement” of the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, Israel’s military said Tuesday, as it seeks to complete its offensive operations against Hamas militants in the north of the enclave.\n\nThe camp, Gaza’s largest, has been hit by renewed Israeli strikes in recent days following the end of a week-long pause in the conflict.\n\nThe IDF also said it “took control of key military posts from which attacks on IDF troops have been carried out.”\n\nIt said weapons and launchers had been located “in civilian compounds,” and it had “located and destroyed rockets found in the garden of a residence in the northern Gaza Strip.”\n\nSome context: Jabalya is a densely populated refugee camp established shortly after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were expelled from territory that encompassed the newly established State of Israel, and later denied return. The camp is a crowded, built-up area, with houses, shops and apartment buildings jammed up against one another.\n\nIsraeli strikes in October targeting Hamas commanders and the militant group’s infrastructure in the camp left catastrophic damage and killed a large number of people, according to eyewitnesses and medics in the enclave.\n\nMan killed in clashes with Israeli forces at West Bank refugee camp, Palestinian officials say\n\nA 25-year-old Palestinian man was killed by Israeli military fire during renewed clashes at the Qalandia refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli forces entered the camp north of Jerusalem on Monday, when another Palestinian was killed amid clashes that lasted several hours, according to the ministry.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the operation.\n\nIn a separate incident in the West Bank, four other Palestinians were injured in clashes with the Israeli army at Deheisheh refugee camp, near Bethlehem, the Palestinian ministry said.\n\n\"More hellish scenario\" to unfold if more aid doesn’t enter Gaza, UN warns\n\nA “more hellish scenario is about to unfold” if more aid is not allowed to enter Gaza, UN humanitarian coordinator Lynn Hastings said Monday.\n\nThe current amount of aid is insufficient and the conditions required to deliver aid to Gaza do not exist, according to Hastings, the Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and United Nations Resident Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe use of only the Rafah crossing to bring aid trucks does not work, the UN said, despite the efforts of its agencies, the Egyptian and Palestine Red Crescent Society, and other partners.\n\nThe international body added Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” with a lack of clean drinking water, no proper sanitation and poor nutrition for people, and shelters with no capacity.\n\nThe situation amounts to a “textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster,” Hastings said. “Humanitarian operations cannot be kept on a drip feed of fuel,” she said, adding that fuel is required for hospitals, clean drinking water, sanitation, social services and UN operations, among others.\n\nThe UN said fuel must be allowed to enter Gaza in a “manner which ensures Israel’s security.”\n\nHastings said the UN and NGOs alone can’t support the population of Gaza, stressing that commercial and public sectors must be allowed to bring supplies into the strip.\n\nThe UN said it stands ready to work with all parties to “expand the number of UN-managed safe shelters and to deliver assistance where it is needed.”\n\nRatio of 2 civilians killed for every Hamas member \"tremendously positive\" in circumstances, IDF says\n\nA ratio of two Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza for every Hamas militant is a “tremendously positive” given the challenges of urban combat, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Monday.\n\nIt comes after the Agence-France-Presse news agency, citing a briefing for foreign media by senior Israeli military officials, reported Monday that the IDF believes about two civilians have been killed in Gaza for every Hamas militant.\n\nAsked by CNN’s Erin Burnett about that report, IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said: “I can confirm the report.”\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told journalists at a news conference Saturday that the military has killed “thousands of terrorists.” The Israeli military has not officially published any estimates of those killed.\n\nAFP reported that the unnamed Israeli military official, when asked to confirm reports that around 5,000 Hamas militants had been killed, replied: “The numbers are more or less right.”\n\nThe Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza says 15,899 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks since October 7. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants.\n\nA top US State Department official told Congress last month that while it was difficult to assess casualty figures while the conflict was ongoing, she believed the true death toll could be even higher than what is being publicly discussed.\n\nMap showing unsafe areas of Gaza isn't perfect, but it's \"the best thing that we can do,\" IDF says\n\nThe system implemented by the Israel Defense Forces in recent days to designate unsafe areas of Gaza is not perfect, but is “the best thing that we can do,” an IDF spokesperson said Monday, as civilians search for shelters amid Israel’s expanded ground operations.\n\nThe IDF on Friday distributed leaflets in Gaza with a QR-code linked to an online map that divided Gaza into thousands of parcels. Since then, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman has posted maps on his X account, formerly Twitter, warning Gazans to leave large swaths of the territory.\n\nBut electricity and internet supply have been extremely intermittent in Gaza. Netblocks, the London-based internet monitoring firm, reported a near-total internet blackout in Gaza on Monday.\n\nCNN’s attempts this weekend to contact people in Khan Younis to ask if they had seen the map were unsuccessful, due to the poor communication links.\n\nSome context: Israel expanded its ground operations to all of Gaza, with ground forces now operating in the southern part of the enclave. A recent evacuation order to move civilians from Khan Younis into Rafah in southern Gaza “created panic, fear and anxiety,” with a United Nations agency warning that 1.9 million people, more than 80% of the enclave’s total population, have been displaced since the beginning of the war.\n\n\"Nowhere safe to go,\" in Gaza for people ordered to evacuate, UN chief says\n\nGaza residents ordered to evacuate have nowhere safe to go in the enclave, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said Monday, as he urged Israeli forces to spare civilians from more suffering.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told civilians to leave large swaths of the strip, including several neighborhoods in the south, after it resumed its military offensive over the weekend.\n\nThe UN chief said he was extremely alarmed by the resumption of hostilities between Israel, Hamas, and other armed Palestinian groups in Gaza.\n\nHe urged Israeli forces to avoid action that would worsen the “catastrophic humanitarian situation,” according to the statement.\n\n“Civilians — including health workers, journalists and UN personnel — and civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times,” the statement said.\n\nGuterres also said he was gravely concerned about the escalation of violence in the occupied West Bank, including a high number of fatalities and arrests, intensified Israeli security operations and settler violence, and attacks on Israelis by Palestinians, the statement said.\n\nSituation in Gaza becoming \"more apocalyptic,\" top UN relief official warns\n\nThe situation in Gaza keeps getting “more apocalyptic,” the United Nations’ top humanitarian relief official said Monday.\n\nGriffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, added that no one and nowhere is safe in Gaza.\n\nSome background: The Israel Defense Forces on Sunday announced it is expanding its ground operations to all of Gaza, following the collapse of a truce with Hamas on Friday.\n\n“The IDF is resuming and expanding the ground operation against Hamas’ strongholds across the whole Gaza Strip,” IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a news conference.\n\n“Our policy is clear — we will forcefully strike any threat posed against our territory.”\n\nThe IDF told civilians to leave large swaths of the enclave, including some neighborhoods in the southern part where many Gazans had fled to after the Israeli operation began in northern Gaza."
