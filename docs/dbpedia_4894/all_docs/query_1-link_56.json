She also accomplished this while she battled a rare cancer through the pandemic, of which she is now in remission.\n\nPrior to that post, she was chief deputy, when she was instrumental in developing and implementing the state’s Medicaid expansion benefit, which expanded health insurance to approximately 600,000 low-income adults.

Graduating a year later with a B.F.A. in Craft and Material Studies with a focus on metalsmithing and fine jewelry, he looked to expand on his early success while working alongside other emerging designers out of the Hand Workshop (now the Visual Arts Center of Richmond).\n\nIn 1990, he launched his official brand, the Jay Sharpe Collection, and 10 years later, his own shop in Richmond’s Carytown district, which he ran for two decades. His custom-designed pieces have been worn by celebrities such as Queen Latifah, Brandy, Monica and Pam Grier (“Foxy Brown”).\n\nSharpe’s second line, Henleava, is an eco-friendly costume jewelry line that has been featured on Bravo TV’s “Real Housewives of Atlanta” and in Essence, Richmond Magazine and Southern Living Magazine.

She served from 2003-05 as group president for HCA in Nashville, Tennessee, where she set the vision for development of freestanding outpatient services nationwide.\n\nAs secretary of health and human resources for Virginia from 2006-10, Tavenner was responsible for administering the state’s Medicaid program as well as for mental health, public health, aging, disabilities, social services and children’s services.\n\nIn a rise to the national level, she became principal deputy administrator, then acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which also works with states on their Children’s Health Insurance programs. She played a major role in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act after its passage in 2010. She was confirmed as administrator in 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Tavenner left government to join America’s Health Insurance Plans, a political advocacy and trade association of health insurance companies, where she became president and CEO, retiring in 2018. She now serves on the board for Select Medical and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, and has also served as a board member of the American Hospital Association and the VCU Health System Authority and president of the Virginia Hospital Association.\n\nCo-founder and CEO of iGenomeDx, Niti Vanee, Ph.D., started her journey in health care after completing her bachelor’s degree in biotechnology in India.
