To alleviate the burden on law enforcement and optimize resource allocation, we focus on two research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of missing person cases in major cities, including their distribution over time and location, and (2) What is the predicted number of incidents in the coming months based on historical data? The answers to these questions are vital to criminology and law enforcement. First, our results will test the consistency of classical criminology theories with real-world data from major U.S. cities. Second, our comparative analysis of various mathematical models for predicting future incidents will offer valuable tools for researchers and assist in choosing the model.\n\nThis project requires proficiency in statistical analysis, including the use of statistical methods and tools for analyzing large datasets. Strong data analytics skills are essential, particularly experience with platforms and programming languages like R and Python. A background in machine learning, including familiarity with basic algorithms and predictive modeling, is also necessary. The dataset used in this project is publicly available online, so the focus will be on building the models.\n\n%Criminology%\n\nDescription\n\nIn this project, we explore the missing persons problem in the United States, defined as anyone “whose whereabouts are unknown to the reporting party.” According to the National Crime Information Center, 521,705 missing persons records were entered in 2021, the lowest number since 1990.

While most G protein signaling takes place at the plasma membrane, it has recently been established that important signaling also occurs from intracellular organelles. Despite the recognized importance of signaling from intracellular compartments, almost nothing is known about how G proteins and other signaling molecules traffic between different cellular compartments. This project will study the subcellular localization and movement of G proteins in living cells that have been gene-edited to make G proteins detectable using confocal imaging or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).\n\nTechniques will include mammalian cell culture, molecular biology, fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy.

This model is designed to simulate conditions similar to those experienced in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Many labs that use this stress paradigm only look at behaviors during the social interaction test. However, our lab recently made a new discovery: the stress responses during the social defeat phase are clearly different between susceptible and resilient mice. These differences are also affected by sex, with differences seen between male and female subjects.This research is significant as it expands our understanding of PTSD-like symptoms beyond the commonly studied post-stress behaviors, delving into the stress response phase itself. By identifying and characterizing the differences in stress responses, this study could reveal critical factors that contribute to resilience or susceptibility to stress-related disorders.\n\nGuidance: PI and postdoc will provide training on behavior evaluation. Resources: A lab laptop computer and SSD drive are provided for data analysis and storage. Expectations: Timely completion of assigned tasks is mandatory.

By analyzing the effects of stress on the volume of tumor growth in a random environment, we develop stochastic models describing the dynamics of the tumor growth based on random adjustments to the population’s intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and tumor treatments. Apart from the models’ ability to capture fluctuations, the availability of a shape parameter in the models gives it the flexibility to describe a variety of population/tumor data with different shapes. The distribution of the stressed population size is derived and used to calculate the minimum amount of chemotherapy needed to cause shrinkage or eradication of a tumor.

Create a “Tight Storyboard” and share it for feedback. 6. Work through each page creating a “Tight Sketch” that is close to finish and can be digitally altered based on feedback 7. Layout, print, and complete pages 8. Bind and curate Zine/Graphic Novel.\n\n%Arts & Humanities%\n\nDescription\n\nStudents in ART 4261 will explore storytelling through text and images by creating and designing Graphic Novels and Zines to self-publish and distribute through Printed Matter in NYC. This project will require learning, researching, and developing creative strategies needed for narrative and concept development specific to Zines and Graphic Novels. Students will be encouraged to choose a topic based on personal, contemporary social, or political issues. Students must ask questions that engage their audience by identifying issues that intersect in areas of common identity and work towards building consensus rather than division. After completing the small edition Zines and Graphic Novels, students will follow the submission process for Printed Matter in NYC. Printed Matter is one of the largest distributors of self-published material in the world. If the student's work is accepted, they are required to have or make a minimum edition of 100 for distribution.\n\nQualifications and Training\n\n1. Research and Identify the Concept 2.

Our recent published preliminary data confirms the autonomous regulation significance of that insulin production with respect to retinal health and function. Further, we will (2) define key metabolic pathways influenced by retinal insulin or the lack thereof, using unique...\n\nretina insulin retinal degeneration metabolism eye aging diabetes\n\nThe goal of this project is to demonstrate the relevance of insulin produced locally in retina to retinal health and function. Our recent published preliminary data confirms the autonomous regulation of insulin in retina. Thus, retinal insulin has its own unique functions that are important to normal retinal metabolism and health. Based on our preliminary findings, we predict endogenous insulin to be an agonist that is secreted steadily to counter the constant metabolic stress that the retina faces. The experimental strategy that we have designed will validate this hypothesis and (1) establish which retinal cell types produce insulin and the significance of that insulin production with respect to retinal health and function. Further, we will (2) define key metabolic pathways influenced by retinal insulin or the lack thereof, using unique genetically engineered conditional knockout mice for key insulin genes, INS1 and INS2.\n\nnone\n\n%Aging% %Biomedical%\n\nDescription\n\nThe goal of this project is to demonstrate the relevance of insulin produced locally in retina to retinal health and function.

This approach allows us to make some direct connections between holistic student assessment and patient outcomes. The longitudinal telehealth encounters built into our medical school’s curriculum create a unique opportunity to develop a telehealth curriculum and assessment strategy that benefits the patient as well as the learner. To continue to support students’ ability to affect patient change in chronic disease care we intend to use Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a way to empower students by giving them a tool to use to impact patient care directly. The MI specific framework is intended to build students skills in the competencies that have the biggest potential to impact patient health as well as help students develop skills that will directly translate from telehealth encounter\n\nRecruiting two to three part-time research assistants. Open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Primary role involves consenting patients, distributing equipment and data collection during telehealth encounters. Minimum of 5 month commitment. Skillset – applicants need to have familiarity with research methodology and be facile with basic mobile application interfaces and using an ipad for recording and uploading interviews.
