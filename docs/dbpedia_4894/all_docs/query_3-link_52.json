In the United States, the combined impact of COVID-19 and the racial unrest following the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery left us reeling with regards to questions of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace and in our societal institutions, including higher education. Discourse on public relations education and DEI peaked. This watershed year witnessed numerous webinars, conversations and discussions sponsored by our profession’s organizations such as the Public Relations Society of America, the Institute for Public Relations, and the Plank Center for Leadership in Public Relations, all of which queried with renewed vigor on how well we are preparing our students to be racial-justice-oriented and DEI-minded public relations professionals as they transition from college to the industry. This was the moment when we approached the Journal of Public Relations Education with the idea of this special issue.\n\nRationale for the Special Issue\n\nAs educators and scholars, we believe leadership and mentorship are especially important during times of upheaval, uncertainty and radical change. Educators and students are grappling with new pedagogical challenges, and we need scholarship that can aid in navigating these challenges and discovering opportunities (Bardhan & Gower, 2020). As editors of this special issue, we hope the research articles and teaching brief collected in this volume address the pressing need to make DEI an integral part of public relations education as emphasized by the Commission on Public Relations Education (Mundy et al., 2018). We also hope the broad range of perspectives and solutions offered in the articles collected in this special issue will aid in deepening our understanding of and the discussion on the intersections of leadership and mentorship in fostering DEI in public relations education.\n\nIt is hard to argue against the proposition that it is difficult for progress to occur in the domain of DEI without committed leadership and stellar mentorship. With regards to public relations education, this means that both students and educators need to understand this crucial relationship between DEI, leadership and mentorship in public relations pedagogy and learning environments. Meng (2013, 2015) has already emphasized that educators play a critical and instructive role in enhancing students’ competitive advantage by incorporating leadership content and training into undergraduate curriculum. In addition, Bardhan and Gower (2020) also addressed the need for public relations educators to lead efforts to advance DEI in education by diversifying curriculum, enhancing inclusive learning environments, and advocating for structural change for DEI-centered pedagogy. The events of 2020 compelled us to weave together both these emphases of DEI and leadership and add the layer of mentorship. We wove in these layers into our call, which encouraged submissions addressing both the challenges and the opportunities in the DEI-Leadership-Mentorship mix in the domain of public relations education. Some key questions were asked as we launched the special issue call:\n\nWhat are the current practice, challenges and opportunities associated with enhancing public relations education at the intersections of leadership, mentorship, and DEI?\n\nWhat kinds of pedagogical, theoretical and practical implications and recommendations can we offer educators in empowering them to foster DEI in public relations education by jointly engaging leadership and mentorship in teaching and training?\n\nWhat are the best practices and resources that aid in teaching public relations at the intersections of leadership, mentorship and DEI?\n\nWhat are some innovative approaches and strategies to connect educators, practitioners and students to enhance public relations pedagogy by integrating the critical thinking and discussion of leadership, mentorship and DEI?\n\nContribution of the Special Issue\n\nThis special issue, Leadership, Mentorship and DEI in the Post-Pandemic Public Relations Classroom, strives to address the above questions. We are pleased to offer our readers a collection of seven articles, which includes six original research articles and one teaching brief. This collection offers a variety of perspectives on exploring both the challenges and opportunities for public relations pedagogy focusing on leadership and mentorship and how the mix could foster a more diverse, equal and inclusive environment in the post-pandemic public relations classroom.\n\nThis issue is organized into three sections, which reflect the complexities of the intersections of leadership, mentorship and DEI in public relations education. The first section, Current Practices and Challenges of DEI in Public Relations Education and the Need for Self-Reflection and Mentorship, includes three articles addressing the broad landscape of public relations pedagogy at the intersections of leadership, mentorship and DEI.\n\nThe first article titled “Enhancing Diversity and Inclusion in the Public Relations Classroom: Current Practices of Public Relations Educators,” contributed by Shana Meganck and Yeonsoo Kim, provides an overview of the changing higher education landscape in addressing the DEI efforts from multiple perspectives (e.g., recruitment, admissions, climate, curriculum, research, strategic planning, administrative structures, etc.). The study focuses on investigating the pedagogical approaches adapted by public relations educators to integrate DEI practices in the public relations classroom through a self-administered online survey. To provide a snapshot of the current DEI practice in public relations education, the authors reviewed structural elements of courses in public relations curriculum such as value statements and policies in course materials, course objectives and learning outcomes, assignments and course evaluations and investigated how those pedagogical approaches are integrated into public relations education to support DEI in the classroom. The results of the survey indicate that educators are performing better when it comes to practicing DEI pedagogical approaches and that they need to work harder at including clearer DEI structural elements.\n\nThe second contribution, titled “Self-Reflection is the Engine that Drives, Grows and Sustains DE&I among Leaders, Mentors and Public Relations Educators and Professionals,” by Bruce K. Berger and Elina Erzikova, offers a critical perspective on examining the relationship between meaningful self-reflection and its underestimated function in navigating DEI challenges and unexpected situations. The authors designed and carried out a three-phase comprehensive research project in the past four years (i.e., self-reflection interviews with 30 PR leaders, a content analysis of educator blogs, articles, and websites addressing self-reflection skills, and surveys of PR educators and focus groups with PR students). Based on the results, the authors argue that educators and professionals in public relations must practice meaningful self-reflection to not only grow but also sustain DEI in public relations. More significantly, the authors provide a practical six-step strategic self-reflection process that can be taught and practiced in the classroom. From the perspective of leadership development, the authors argue that self-reflection is the foundation for continuous improvement in public relations leadership, mentorship, education, and practice.\n\nIn the third article in this section, titled “Cross the Stage: Underrepresented Students’ Challenges and Mentoring Needs in Strategic Communication Programs,” Jiun-Yi Tsai, Janice Sweeter, and Amy Hitt focus on investigating the challenges encountered by underrepresented students in public relations programs in college education. The authors conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with students who self-identify as first generation, Hispanic/Latinx, or Black/African American college students majoring in strategic communication. Their research offers insights on the importance of mentorship support from faculty to help underrepresented students build resilience. The research results also mention that identity-based clubs and classroom peer relationships could foster relational connections that support underrepresented students.\n\nThe second section of this special issue, Curriculum Innovation and Accreditation Standards in Public Relations DEI Pedagogy, features two contributions addressing innovative pedagogical approaches in public relations curriculum. The first article contributed by Lee Bush and Vanessa Bravo, titled “Systematically Applying DEI Accreditation Standards to a Strategic Communication Curriculum,” shares the authors’ experience in leading a new initiative to research, develop, and test modules to achieve DEI learning outcomes in their strategic communication courses as an effort to meet the new guidelines for diversity and inclusion approved by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC). The reflective results showed that it is important to integrate DEI into curriculum in a more systematic way. The assessment results of what worked and what did not provide important pedagogical suggestions to public relations educators for developing a DEI-focused curriculum.\n\nLeadership, mentorship and DEI can intersect in extracurricular spaces and learning environments inhabited by public relations students, and this is demonstrated in practical detail in the second article in this section, titled “Student-led Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Education in Public Relations: PRSSA as a Space for Teaching and Learning.” Authors Arshia Anwer and Timmy Kwong describe how the student leadership of a Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) chapter at a private liberal arts college in the United States took the initiative to enhance its DEI vision, action and pedagogy during the watershed events of 2020. By inviting multiple DEI focused guest speakers, conducting a survey that gauged chapter members’ interest in DEI issues, recruiting diverse students to the chapter from across campus, and nominating its VP for DEI for a PR News Social Impact Award, this chapter sets an example for other PRSSA chapters to emulate.\n\nThe third section of this special issue, Teaching Cases for Exploring DEI Complexities in Public Relations Education, is composed of two contributions that center on incorporating inclusivity and cultural sensitivity into public relations campaigns courses. In the article, titled “Shaping Tomorrow’s Industry Leaders by Incorporating Inclusivity into Campaign Planning Curriculum: Student Reactions to the SMART+IE Mindset in Strategic Communication Efforts,” Richard D. Waters and Tricia M. Farwell present an innovative teaching activity that demonstrates how students can be pedagogically engaged to discuss the nuances of DEI in campaign planning and strategic communication. By incorporating hypothetical case studies that include DEI complexities and teaching students how to lead in DEI communication, this pedagogical innovation emphasizes the importance of inclusive communication. The authors share not just the case study and its DEI pedagogy value, but also describe how students who worked on this case in classes responded to it and what they learned from it about themselves and about the role of DEI in strategic communication. Additionally, the authors reflect on their own experience, as educators, of including this DEI case study in their classes.\n\nThe last contribution in this edited issue is a teaching brief, titled “Eco-Tourism Campaigns as a Framework for Global PR Course.” The authors, Nandini Bhalla and Arien Rozelle, address diversity education at the international level and argue for the importance of helping students build cultural sensitivity and equality in the public relations classroom. Their teaching brief provides scenarios for public relations educators to consider and adopt when helping students understand cultural and structural differences in an international context.\n\nOverall, the research articles and teaching brief collected in this special issue present a wide range of perspectives on understanding the intersections of leadership, mentorship and DEI in public relations education. We could not locate any research that addressed the intersections of DEI, leadership and mentorship in public relations education when we sent out the call for this special issue. Now we are pleased to state that this is no longer the case. The intersectionality nature of the topics present the complexity at multiple dimensions such as the practical, the pedagogical and the theoretical levels. It is our sincere hope that the articles in this special issue will serve as a springboard for further scholarship on this critical intersection in public relations pedagogy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt has truly been an honor to have had the opportunity to work on this issue and we would like to thank all those who supported it by sending in submissions. We would especially like to thank our team of reviewers with expertise on this topic. We could not have published this issue without their valuable insights, constructive feedback, comments and suggestions, and overall solid reviews to help the authors revise and improve their research and writings. Finally and most importantly, our heartfelt thanks go to Dr. Pamela Bourland-Davis, Editor of the Journal of Public Relations Education and her editorial team for offering the opportunity to edit this special issue. It would have been impossible to produce this special issue without their encouragement and guidance throughout the process.\n\nReferences\n\nBardhan, N., & Gower, K. (2020).

Yet, this latest report notes a gap between ethical knowledge and ethical practice. Simply stated, professionals do not believe that entry-level practitioners are prepared for the ethical demands of modern public relations practice. This article proposes an assignment to address this concern. Using a reflective learning model, the Perspectives: Quiet Place Journal assignment seeks to deepen students’ understanding of ethical principles and develop students’ practice of ethical decision making.\n\nGIFT Overview\n\nAccording to the 2018 report by the Commission on Public Relations Education, an understanding of ethics is crucial to effective public relations practice; yet this report notes a gap between ethical knowledge and ethical practice (Commission on Public Relations Education, 2018). Simply stated, professionals do not believe that entry- level practitioners are prepared for the ethical demands of modern public relations practice. In response, this article introduces a reflective learning assignment that educators can use to deepen students’ understanding of ethical principles and develop students’ practice of ethical decision making.\n\nThe Quiet Place (QP) Journal is a series of reflective journal prompts on ethical literacy and decision making. Its goal is to develop the ethical understanding and application skills of emerging public relations professionals. Students are instructed to find a quiet place and be still for 30 minutes. In that stillness, students are asked to complete an ethical activity and reflect on the experience. There are six journals in the series: values, competencies, strengths, perspectives, change, and ethical promises. The Perspectives: QP Journal will be presented here.\n\nThis assignment is completed at the midpoint of the course and transitions student learning from knowledge of ethical concepts to application of ethical concepts. In the assignment, students complete an ethical simulation and reflect on their decision making process.\n\nRationale\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal assignment was developed in response to the CPRE’s 2018 report — Fast forward: Foundations and future state, educators and practitioners on the importance of ethics in public relations education as well as the power of silence and reflection to enhance student learning. The report ranked ethics as the top knowledge area for students (CPRE, 2018). Specifically, the report noted that students need to understand ethical philosophies and be able to utilize ethical decision making processes. The Perspectives: QP Journal addresses this need by helping students use key ethical philosophies in an ethical decision making process and reflect on how this process guides their own personal ethical practice.\n\nThe CPRE (2018) report also noted the importance of teaching ethical decision making processes. It said that greater education on ethical decision making was needed “to help prepare the next generation to work in an environment that does not always value truth” (p. 68). This focus is important as the report noted that a gap exists between ethical knowledge and ethical practice. Thus, guiding students through the ethical decision making process helps students recognize the importance of ethical concepts and how to apply these concepts to real-world situations. The Perspectives: QP Journal focuses on this need by leading students through a perspective switching exercise. In this assignment, students are asked to complete the Moral Machine (2017), an ethical simulation of self-driving cars, but to do so from different perspectives and then reflect on their decision making process. In doing so, students engage in ethical decision making, discovering how perspectives impact ethical outcomes and recognizing how they often unknowingly follow certain ethical philosophies to arrive at a decision.\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal is also important from a scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) perspective. SoTL research has demonstrated the importance of quietness and reflection when dealing with abstract ideas, such as ethics (Eswaran, 2021). The Perspectives: QP journal helps students do so by requiring them to find a quiet place to think and reflect. The inclusion of a quiet place is an important component of the assignment. Eswaran (2021) said that we “have forgotten (or even fear) quiet. We live in a world full of noise and chatter. A world wherein our daily routines are inundated with distractions and responsibilities” (para. 33). Yet, a routine of silence can help individuals understand how they perceive the world and how this perception impacts behavior (Larsen et. al., 2016).\n\nReflective practice is also important in ethics education. Helyer (2015) found that the process of reflection utilizes knowledge that “lies deep within – so deep it is often taken for granted and not explicitly acknowledged, but it is the data humans use to make instinctive decisions based upon accumulated knowledge from past actions and experience” (p. 22). Thus, reflective practice through the Perspectives: QP Journal enables the invisible aspects of ethics to become visible, allowing students to examine how their ethics guide their behavior.\n\nAssignment Learning Objectives\n\nThe overall goal of the Perspectives: QP Journal is to engage students in ethical thinking and bridge the gap between ethical knowledge and practice through reflective learning. As a result of this assignment, students will be able to:\n\nApply ethical philosophies in an ethical situation.\n\nAssess an ethical situation from different perspectives.\n\nUse ethical decision making processes to make an ethical decision.\n\nIdentify the ethical philosophies that guide their ethical decisions.\n\nEmploy the use of silence and reflection to guide future ethical practice.\n\nConnection to Public Relations Practice and/or Theory\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal offers several connections to public relations practice and theory. The assignment reinforces key ethical philosophies and considers the application of these philosophies in an ethical decision making process. The assignment also teaches students the importance of reflection and its ability to transform an abstract concept such as ethics into practical application. This connection is important as educators cannot prepare students for every future ethical situation.\n\nRather, the Perspectives: QP Journal offers students the foundation and tools needed to approach future ethical situations with confidence.\n\nHow the Assignment was Class-Tested\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal has been an assignment in an asynchronous online public relations ethics course for the past three semesters. The assignment is assessed qualitatively by a final course reflection termed the “souvenirs of the class.” This reflection asks students to identify two or three souvenirs from the class, or things they will take with them and use later either personally or professionally. By design, this reflection does not ask specifically about the Perspectives: QP Journal. A key aspect of the assessment is to determine if the QP Journal series or the specific Perspectives: QP Journal assignment emerged as a resonant component of the course.\n\nEmpirical Evidence of Learning Outcomes/Assessment\n\nOver the past three semesters, seven themes or souvenirs emerged from the souvenir course assessment. Five of the themes related to the Perspectives: QP Journal assignment. Twenty-six percent of students identified the Perspectives: QP Journal prompt as a key souvenir from the course. Students discussed the value of perspective switching to better understand ethical situations and the perspectives of others. One student said, “I sometimes have difficulty seeing from someone else’s perspective. This was a VERY important topic to write about because, in the real world, there will be many disagreements,.” Another student echoed the importance of assuming others’ perspectives, saying “The last but DEFINITELY not least (possibly most important) souvenir was about perspectives. I think that the world would be so much better if we took a little bit of time to stand where our ‘opposers’ come from, or where their thought processes are stemming in ANY subject!” As a result of this assignment, students also noted the importance of decision making tools such as the Potter Box to help them make ethical decisions. One student said, “There have been many times in my life when I have been faced with an ethical dilemma, but I never really knew how to work through the problem. Learning about the Potter Box gave me an easy way to work through ethical problems, and I know that when I am faced with ethical problems in the future, I will remember the Potter Box and put it to use.” Finally, students noted that the Perspectives: QP Journal would help them in their future work. One student noted, “This journal entry helped me think about how important it is to think about the perspectives of others in all situations. I think this will help me a lot in the future in both my personal and professional life.”\n\nThe reflective practice of the Perspectives: QP Journal also emerged as a key souvenir with 21% of students identifying this format as a significant component of their ethical learning. One student said, “I really enjoyed the quiet place journals. It gave me time to really think about each topic and gave me an opportunity to reflect on how I was feeling.” Another student commented, “I actually looked forward to these each week. Truly it was a time that pushed me to sit down in my own thoughts and just reflect and write. I don’t do this often but like to! It helped me to think outside of the box and think deeper about my thoughts and feelings.” This reflective practice also helped students connect classroom learning with life experience. “Journaling allows me to reflect on everything I have learned and put it into a tangible form. Instead of just cruising through the class and trying to get readings done, I was able to actually reflect on what I was learning rather than just going through the motions. I hope to bring this concept to all future career and personal endeavors,” one student said.\n\nStudents recognized the Perspectives: QP Journal as a key bridge between knowing ethical concepts and practicing ethics. One student said, “The information learned was valuable, but I most enjoyed getting to spend some quiet time each week reflecting on important and useful topics. I want to continue this practice throughout my work journey.” Another student echoed this sentiment, adding that the assignment “helped me get a better understanding of the material and how to apply it to real life situations. This helps me in the future because the more I understand something, the more likely I am to apply it my own life and experiences.” As a result, the Perspectives: QP Journal offered a tangible way for students to think deeply about the abstract concept of ethics and make applications. It also gave students a life-long learning tool that can be used to address future ethical issues.\n\nTemplate Assignment Guide\n\nAssignment Guide for Perspectives: Quiet Place Journal\n\nAssignment Introduction\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology created the Moral Machine (2017) to study our ethical decision making in the context of self-driving cars. In this online simulation, an individual is presented with 13 scenarios in which a collision involving an autonomous vehicle is unavoidable. The scenarios include a combination of passengers and pedestrians and asks who the individual would spare.\n\nIn the Perspectives: QP Journal we will use this simulation to understand the ethical philosophies and assess how different perspectives impact ethical decision making.\n\nAssignment Resources\n\nTo prepare for this assignment, review the ethical philosophies discussed in Part I and read Chapter 16 on ethical decision making in Ethics in Public Relations: A Guide to Best Practice by Patricia Parsons. Another good resource on ethical philosophies is the Core Ethical Principles module in The Arthur W. Page Center Public Relations Ethics Training.\n\nAssignment Instructions\n\nThis assignment has two parts: (1) complete the “Moral Machine” simulation, and (2) then in essay-format, reflect on your experience by responding to the guiding questions below.\n\nPart 1. Complete the “Moral Machine” simulation a minimum of six times. The first three times do so as the driver of the car. Pay attention to the decisions you make in each scenario. Then complete the simulation three more times but from three different perspectives. You might complete the simulation from the perspective of a passenger, from the perspective of the driver of an oncoming car, or as the owner of the dog who ran out in front of the car. The key is to choose a different perspective each time you complete the simulation.\n\nPart 2. Reflect on the experience using the questions below as a guide.\n\nAfter completing the simulation, reflect on your decisions. When you were the driver of the car, what guided your decisions? How did these guides relate to the ethical philosophies?\n\nThen reflect on the simulation when completed from perspectives of others. Did your decisions change based on the perspective? How might this simulation relate to ethical decision making in public relations?\n\nFinally, explain how this simulation and reflection might be helpful in your current and future practice of ethical public relations.\n\nAssignment Rules\n\nIn order to complete this assignment effectively, follow the three rules of the Perspectives: QP Journal:\n\nFind a space where you can be quiet and reflective. Spend a minimum of 30 minutes in quiet reflection.\n\nBe honest with yourself. While this assignment will be shared with me, you are the primary audience, so be honest with yourself. If there is something that you want to keep private, black-out those portions from the entry.\n\nBe gracious to yourself. This assignment is a space to explore, learn, and grow in our ethical maturity.\n\nAssignment Grading Criteria or Rubric\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal is graded on engagement and completion. Researchers found that the effectiveness of reflective learning is greatly reduced when students are concerned about getting the “right answer” (Persson, et. al, 2018). Instead SoTL literature suggests that reflection should be used for developmental assignments, often without credit assigned (Chang, 2019). In an online course structure, if an assignment does not have a point value, students often omit the assignment. As a result, the Perspectives: QP Journal does assign credit, but it is a low-stakes completion assignment. Assessment is based on the student’s acknowledgment that they met the expected timeframe, that they thoughtfully engaged in reflective practice, and that the assignment was submitted by the deadline.\n\nSoTL research also noted that students will often be less honest in reflective assignments and instead try to write what they believe the instructor wants to hear (Chang, 2019). To combat this drawback, students could blackout portions of their QP Journal entries that they felt were too personal or that they did not want to share with the instructor. This technique allowed students the space to be more honest and feel a greater sense of safety in their reflection.\n\nFinally, for reflective learning to be effective, instructor involvement is critical. To facilitate student engagement, it is important for an instructor to thoughtfully dialogue with the student in the Perspectives: QP Journal. The two-way dialogue gives the instructor an opportunity to guide the student to deeper reflection by asking follow-up questions or requesting more explanation on a point or connection. Typically, this two-way interaction is all that is needed to help students remain engaged with the assignment. With these issues in mind, the following grading rubric was developed.\n\nGrading Criteria\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal is a completion-based assignment worth 25 points. Credit is based on the following criteria:\n\nThe student’s assignment was a minimum of 500 words.\n\nThe student’s assignment met the stated deadline.\n\nThe student engaged in thoughtful reflection and in written dialogue with the instructor.\n\nTeaching Note\n\nThe Perspectives: QP Journal has been used for the last three semesters in an online asynchronous public relations ethics course. The assignment occurs near the midpoint of the course and transitions course content from understanding ethical concepts and theories to applying these concepts through decision making processes.\n\nWhile used in a public relations ethics course, the Perspectives: QP Journal can also be used in an ethics unit of any public relations/ communication course. The assignment reinforces ethical philosophies by helping students apply these philosophies in a simulation. The assignment would also be useful in a public relations management or leadership course as the assignment introduces students to the ethical decision making process. Further, the perspective switching component of the assignment helps students see different perspectives, which would work well in a public relations cases course. Finally, the introspective, reflective format of the assignment makes it ideal for an online course.\n\nNo matter the specific course, the Perspectives: QP Journal works best when the instructor is engaged with the students. The assignment becomes a dialogue between the student and the instructor, a space where the instructor can affirm, ask additional questions, and share observations.\n\nResearch has found that the element of reflecting and sharing improves student learning and offers a sense of belonging and social support (Chang, 2019). As a result, the instructor should respond thoughtfully to each student. Doing so helps create the safe space necessary for students to feel comfortable to share. In the early stages of implementing this assignment, the importance of dialogue with students was missed. The Perspectives: QP Journal was originally set up as a graded assignment, and instructor comments were provided in the grading feedback. Student received the instructor’s response, but could not reply to the instructor.\n\nMany students instigated dialogue by emailing the instructor directly to respond to the instructor’s comments. Their initiative led to the realization that the assignment needed to be set up as a private two- way communication channel so that the student and instructor could converse back and forth easily. The move to two-way communication was revolutionary in student engagement with the assignment.\n\nThe drawback to the Perspectives: QP Journal is time. While rewarding, facilitating a dialogue with each student is immensely time consuming. A potential solution is to incorporate more collaborative reflection. Research shows that collaborative reflection highlights different perspectives and encourages students to see things differently and challenge their assumptions (Bowne et. al., 2010; Chang, 2019; Krutka et. al., 2014). Currently students may incorporate ideas from this assignment into class discussions, but are not required to do so. As a result, offering student-to-student collaborative reflection opportunities may reduce the time burden on the instructor while capitalizing on the benefits of collaborative reflection for the student.\n\nRecommended Sources Related to the Assignment\n\nThere are several resources that support the Perspectives: QP Journal. Prior to the assignment, students are introduced to an overview of ethical decision making models by reading chapter 16 in Ethics in Public Relations: A Guide to Best Practice by Patricia Parsons (2016), which provides a resource on the ethical philosophies that are reinforced in the Perspectives: QP Journal. The online training modules from The Arthur W. Page Center Public Relations Ethics Training also provide resources for this assignment with a module two on core ethical principles and module four on ethical decision making (Kent, n.d.; Kleinmann, n.d.). Finally, engaging students through activities or simulations are important. The Moral Machine (2017), created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the simulation tool used for the Perspectives: QP Journal. Thus far, the Moral Machine (2017) has collected information from 2.3 million people and offers interesting conclusions on how people around the world approach ethical situations.\n\nThere are also several excellent resources on the reflective learning format used in the Perspectives: QP Journal. A few to note include Parker Palmer’s (2000) Let Your Life Speak: Listening for the Voice of Vocation and The Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck (2006). Both resources offer good information on the importance of reflective practices and its influence on a learning growth mindset.\n\nIn conclusion, the Perspectives: QP Journal assignment was successful in bridging the gap between ethical concepts and practice through reflective learning. Through this assignment students noted the importance of perspective switching and decision making tools such as the Potter Box, and committed to their usage when faced with ethical dilemmas. Students also identified the power of reflective processing as a tool to transfer abstract ethical concepts into concrete ethical practice. Most importantly, students affirmed that ethics matters, both personally and professionally, and recognized that while not always comfortable, doing the right thing is always necessary. One student summarized it best saying that through this assignment, “I learned the significance of doing what is ethical even when it is not the most convenient thing to do.”\n\nReferences\n\nBowne, M., Cutler, K., DeBates, D., Gilkerson, D. & Stremmel, A.

As instructors of a research methods course that traditionally focused on the needs of corporate clients, we wondered how these developments could inspire a new learning experience for students that encourages them to develop research skills through responding more directly to major life disruptions and the inequities revealed. We aimed to avoid compounding challenges our students faced while also giving them knowledge and skills that would empower them to address diversity and ethics in their future work as public relations professionals (CPRE, 2018). The result is a semester-long project that asks students to critically engage with questions of ethics and inequalities in research methods.\n\nGIFT Overview\n\nOur classrooms are spaces where students can practice using research skills to navigate the realities of our social world rather than reify false notions of neutrality, whether in research and strategic communication or in education as a whole (Freire, 2018). This GIFT asks students to spend their time and effort addressing significant social issues, including issues that coincide with current events and those that reflect a prior interest or passion for the student. The project increases student engagement by helping them see the research methods they learn as relevant to current challenges, and students build self-efficacy as they apply course objectives in reframing a societal obstacle as an opportunity for a positive impact (Anderson, 2004; Ineson et al., 2013; Leston-Bandiera, 2013; Chowdhury, n.d.). Students leave the course understanding how research methods are relevant to issues they care about and confident in their ability to conduct ethical, inclusive public relations research in their careers.\n\nAssignment Rationale\n\nOur primary objective in designing this assignment is to improve student engagement in public relations research methods courses. Although we were initially driven by the need to engage students during the shift to remote learning during COVID, improving engagement is always especially desirable in methods courses, which our students frequently cite as the most challenging. Our primary intervention is asking students to choose an organization and PR issue they find personally relevant for their semester-long project. By giving students a greater say in developing their project and the ability to choose a topic relevant to their career goals, we expect to see increased engagement and self- efficacy (Anderson, 2004; Leston-Bandiera, 2013). This increased sense of ownership will lead them to develop better research skills and feel confident applying those skills in professional settings as well as help them build ethics knowledge with an eye to real-world effects.\n\nA second, and complementary, goal in designing this assignment is to better students’ ability to apply their research skills beyond the classroom as they move into careers as communication professionals. We hope that asking students to work on projects that they see as aligned with their personal interests and career goals will lead them to think critically about the potential strengths and weaknesses of each method as it might be employed in the real-world contexts they will eventually face. We ask students to go beyond designing and executing the most ideal version of a study and to instead grapple with the challenges of applying those research methods to more realistic business cases.\n\nFinally, we considered what the increased social unrest due to racial injustice meant for our students, both as they completed coursework and as they prepared to enter the world as early career communicators. At a minimum, we felt that all students needed to consider ethics with an eye toward diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), and we updated our research ethics accordingly. We also encouraged – but did not require – students to take on DEI questions in their project selection. Pushing or requiring students to choose DEI topics would have risked undermining our first two goals. But for students who chose to pursue these questions, the semester- long assignment provided an opportunity for deeper engagement.\n\nFuture instructors could choose to implement one of these interventions without committing to both of them. Project choice in itself can improve student agency, even if it is not explicitly connected to future career goals, social issues or questions of DEI. And of course, giving students the opportunity to work on projects that emulate real-world campaigns helps students build confidence applying research methods in practice, regardless of whether they are invested in the particular topic.\n\nBringing these three elements together, however, has the added benefit of encouraging students to think about ethics and equity in terms of their own goals and aspirations, hopefully preparing them to take those ideas to a career of their choice. Further, the interventions that allow for all three elements are synergistic rather than in conflict; each has the potential to improve the others’ effects.\n\nAssignment Learning Objectives\n\nLearning Objective 1 (abbreviated as LO 1):\n\nStudents increase their capacity to connect coursework to professional success in future careers.\n\nLearning Objective 2 (abbreviated as LO 2):\n\nStudents develop research and analytic skills.\n\nLearning Objective 3 (abbreviated as LO 3):\n\nStudents develop ethics and diversity/inclusion knowledge.\n\nLearning Objective 4 (abbreviated as LO 4):\n\nStudents increase confidence in their ability to employ new skills and knowledge in their future careers.\n\nConnection to Public Relations Practice or Theory\n\nResearch and analytic skills, ethics knowledge, and diversity and inclusion knowledge are three of the qualities employers most desire in entry-level public relations professionals, yet many college graduates enter the workforce without a strong understanding of relevant research methods or how they relate to ethics and inclusion (CPRE, 2018). Investigations find that, in particular, communication practitioners do not consistently employ research methods to measure and evaluate the success of their messaging (Thorson et al., 2015). These disconnects, however, are not because public relations curricula lack research methods training; in fact, more than 90 percent of undergraduate programs require a research methods course (CPRE, 2018).\n\nInstead, research suggests that students frequently struggle to actually learn the research skills covered in these courses, in part because they do not understand how the material relates to their existing knowledge or future goals (Markle, 2017; see Early, 2014 for meta- analysis). As a result, it is difficult for students to integrate new concepts into their worldview, and they are less motivated to engage with course materials.\n\nAdditionally, when students enter the working world, they may not see these research tools as ways to improve their messaging but as potentially undermining their contributions (Nothhaft & Stennson, 2019). We posit that teaching research methods in a vacuum, disconnected from students’ goals and interests, may exacerbate this problem.\n\nBy asking students to choose an organization and topic that feel relevant to them, we improve student learning, connecting research and analytic skills and ethics knowledge developed in the course to their existing knowledge, real-world experience, and future goals (Anderson, 2004; Leston-Bandeira, 2013). Students more clearly recognize how the information they are learning might apply directly to their future careers, and they build confidence in their ability to apply those skills in the workplace.\n\nEmployers increasingly feel that DEI training must be embedded in all aspects of business and communication education rather than treated as a separate topic (Ragas, 2023). This GIFT addresses this need by incorporating questions of diversity and inclusion into the study of research ethics and, in many cases, as a core component of the issue students choose to address for their semester topic.\n\nHow the Assignment was Class-Tested\n\nThe activity consists of reshaping a semester-long, client-based project, providing opportunities for students to rethink the values that usually underlie research courses in strategic communication. It was class tested in two 30-person undergraduate Advertising/Public Relations Research Methods classes.\n\nIn the traditional course, over sixteen weeks, lectures on research methods including focus groups, interviews, ethnography, surveys, and experiments were each followed by a graded assignment conducted individually or in a group. Due to COVID-19, we reimagined the class as an asynchronous remote course, as many other instructors had. Our new design aimed to increase online engagement and make the course feel relevant by giving students opportunity to think deeply about real-world issues across two core course elements that encompassed the GIFT:\n\nChoosing a client and issue related to a current social issue,\n\nLearning about research ethics issues that have involved BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities,\n\nEach group was required to select a client engaged with a relevant social issue that they would like to address throughout the semester. A relevant social issue was defined as an important problem for discussion that is closely connected to the current time and affects human society (Dictionary.com, n.d.a; Dictionary.com, n.d.b; Dictionary.com, n.d.c). The social issue could but did not have to be related to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion).\n\nOnce clients and issues were approved, each group refined a research problem to address on behalf of their client over the course of the semester. As we covered each method, students posed research questions which could be best answered with that method and which deepened their understanding and built on their previous work. There were three phases of research assignments: Secondary Data (background research project), Qualitative Primary Data (focus group, in-depth interview, participant observation/ethnography), and Quantitative Primary Data (survey, experiment). These assignments led to a reflection assignment that allowed students to speak to the value of the unique aspects of the course (i.e. social issue and diverse research ethics) and a final project (presentation and paper) that synthesized the previous assignments and provided recommendations for their clients’ advertising or PR effort.\n\nMaintaining the advocacy focus, the reframed project was complemented by content highlighting the perspectives of marginalized or minoritized communities. Each week, in addition to working toward graded assignments, students were prepared to engage fully in discussion activities including contributing written or video recorded posts in the internal message forum for the class. We reworked the section of the course examining research ethics to include socially relevant aspects. For example, previous ethics modules centered studies involving white researchers and participants (e.g., the Milgram and Stanford Prison Experiments). We added the “Tuskegee Experiment” to our case studies and included new sections on “Black Women & Medicinal Experimentation” and “Research Ethics and Exploitation in Developing Countries” (see sample assignment titled Research Ethics through Diverse Experiences). We also provided an assignment that allowed students to reflect on the knowledge they gained over the semester including what was most valuable, what outstanding questions they had, and what was most relevant to their personal and professional life. These opportunities allowed students to further consider their professional futures as well as discuss ethical considerations addressed during the semester.\n\nEvidence of Learning Outcomes/Assessment\n\nEvidence of learning outcomes was demonstrated through qualitative student feedback that aligned with key learning objectives. Students said the course felt especially relevant compared to other courses they had taken. They emphasized that focusing on real-world issues (in this case, DEI related) was important to them and made understanding concepts easier (LO 1, LO 3). Students indicated that having a topic that was meaningful to them and relevant to current events made it easier for them to engage with course topics.\n\nNotably, the GIFT served as the bridge between course content taught by us as instructors and the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that public relations practitioners value (specifically, research skills and ethics knowledge). Students believed that choosing the social issue related topic made their explorations of the various research methods especially engaging (LO 2, LO 4). Furthermore, the topics covered in the ethics section worked to deepen their appreciation for the related discussion activities. Students said that the expanded ethics section was especially engaging and made them think more seriously about the importance of ethics in research.\n\nThe perceived relevance of the GIFT provided the glue of engagement and self-efficacy needed to bring about the intended outcomes. Additionally, the ethics section provided food for thought about diversity, equity, and inclusion that could guide subsequent research.\n\nImportantly, the students also said that the GIFT better prepared them for entry-level positions in their field. Students felt that they could use the project as an example on their resume and in job applications. Some also indicated that it made them stronger candidates as they entered the job market, with one noting that the project prepared them for an interview, allowing them to speak about hands-on work employing multiple research methods that they would need to use over the course of a campaign if hired.\n\nThe feedback students provided suggests that they found this approach meaningful and exciting, even at a time when they faced more remote classwork that could make staying engaged difficult.\n\nTemplate Assignment Guides\n\nThere are three template assignments:\n\nClient/Issue Choice Opportunity\n\nResearch Ethics through Diverse Experiences Activity\n\nReflection Assignment\n\nClient/Issue Choice Opportunity\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nDefine team goals and expectations for group work\n\nCollaborate toward the selection of an organization/client\n\nCreate research topic based on a social issue impacting an organization/client\n\nAssignment Description\n\nThis semester you will have the opportunity to focus on a client’s engagement with a major social movement or current event. Each group will be required to select a client engaged with a relevant social issue that you would like to address throughout the semester.\n\nA relevant social issue will be defined as an important problem for discussion that is closely connected to the current time and affects human society (Dictionary.com, n.d.a; Dictionary,com n.d.b, Dictionary.com, n.d.c).\n\nAssignment Requirements\n\nFirst, you will fill out a survey that will assess your personal project preferences including your skills, interests, and the social issues which you are most passionate about. After being assigned to groups based on your preferences and completing a team charter, your group will decide on and submit your top three clients and potential research topics for my final approval.\n\nOnce confirmed, your group will further refine a research problem to address throughout the semester. With each assignment, you will pose research questions that can be addressed using the research methods covered in the course. The research you conduct will involve how your client is responding to a social issue (as defined above).\n\nEach potential client that your group identifies should fall under one of the following categories:\n\nThis client should consider addressing [relevant social issue] through strategic communication research,\n\nThis client is currently addressing [relevant social issue] and should assess their effectiveness through strategic communication research, or\n\nThis client is involved in a corporate crisis/situation related to [relevant social issue] that should be addressed through strategic communication research.\n\nThe client can be a for-profit or nonprofit organization. It should be an organization that is big enough to have a media footprint. The social issue can but does not have to be related to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). It can be any social issue (e.g. anti-Black racism, climate change, disability justice, animal rights, bullying etc.). However, it should be a problem that requires strategic communication research to solve.\n\nResearch Ethics through Diverse Experiences Activity\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\nIncrease understanding of ethical considerations involved in research through diverse perspectives/examples.\n\nConnect ethical considerations to the professional world.\n\nConnect ethical considerations to your research project.\n\nAssignment Description\n\nYou will discuss the ways in which learning about these unethical studies inform your understanding of communication research ethics.\n\nAssignment Requirements\n\nPlease read and/or watch at least two videos or articles from the subsections below.

To receive credit for the client/issue choice, students must submit three potential clients (falling under one of the three listed categories) and the corresponding social issue to be researched for each. Alternatively, the assignment can be viewed as a low stakes engagement opportunity used to develop a graded assignment.\n\nResearch Ethics through Diverse Experiences Activity\n\nThis research ethics forum response activity is one of ten responses that accounts for 5% of the student’s total grade. Students receive full credit for each one as long as they address each part of the prompt and respond to a classmate. Alternatively, the assignment can be viewed as a low stakes engagement opportunity used to develop a graded assignment.\n\nReflection Assignment\n\nThis Reflection Assignment accounts for 10% of the student’s total grade. Grading will be based on the accuracy of the information provided in question one and the substantiveness of the responses to questions two through four.\n\nTeaching Note\n\nIntended Courses\n\nAdvertising/Public Relations research methods; Undergraduate communication research methods\n\nBest Practices of Implementing the Assignment\n\nWe made a decision to require that each student engage with a social issue, rather than to “strongly suggest” or to allow opting out. We took this stance because we felt strongly that engaging successfully in the professional field (and in society in general) will increasingly require young adults to step outside of the comfortable and agreeable. However, we balanced this decision with a variety of student choice moments that allowed students to maintain agency and equity in the course. For example, groups were assigned based on students’ responses to a survey about project preferences, including issues about which they were most passionate. Student groups were provided autonomy in selecting clients, which could be any for-profit or nonprofit organizations with a significant media footprint. The activity design asked each group to work together to decide on three client/issue ideas with justifications for each. The instructors then selected one of the three ideas for the students to continue to develop.\n\nNotably, the social issue could be but did not have to be related to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). Setting tight parameters around the type of client and issue the students chose could have resulted in students feeling pressure to choose issues perceived as important to the instructors. Instead, we welcomed a range of social issues as long as they could be addressed with strategic communication research. Broad parameters ensured students chose issues engaging for them (e.g., climate change, disability justice, animal rights, bullying etc.). Yet, our approach allowed for students to explore DEI by choice. For example, one student in a group researching diversity in NASCAR shared:\n\nI want to say that I already valued diversity in research, but this course has furthered my appreciation for it. Especially when finding that a great deal of research associated with our client has been focused on the white feminist perspective in branding and social change, rather than further inclusion of factors like race and ethnicity.\n\nFurthermore, the way we framed our approach—as an “opportunity” for students to “choose” to delve into social issues paired with “understanding” the unethical research experiences of people from minoritized communities (as well as completing a team charter detailing an approach for working well together)—seemed to prepare students to be inclusive and ethical themselves. Because of our approach, students– including our underrepresented students–felt not only accommodated but empowered. For example, after discussing her group’s decision to choose a DEI related social issue, the Black student mentioned earlier continued by expressing her gratitude for our approach–while bridging key aspects of the GIFT in her response (i.e. student engagement toward addressing PR, exploring a social issue and practicing ethics and inclusion):\n\nI enjoyed our focus group because we asked sensitive questions that are generally avoided. In our focus groups, [the] majority of our participants strayed away from questions of diversity and race, but it started a conversation. Another factor is that there were no persons of color in our focus group which is an important part of providing solutions. Research participants should come from diverse backgrounds because one opinion and point of view does not speak for all. Thank you for allowing our research topics to be centered around the current racial climate that we live in today.\n\nWe opted for open-ended ethics discussion questions that allowed students to engage in deep reflection beyond a regurgitation of course concepts (see Research Ethics through Diverse Experiences Activity).\n\nHowever, the original discussion questions did not directly ask about relevance specifically to the research project/client and career goals. We also opted for reflection questions that allowed students to engage in contemplation about knowledge they gained over the semester without being primed by the instructor (see Reflection Assignment). The original reflection prompts did not explicitly ask students to address ethics and diverse perspectives. However, students’ responses organically included references to ethics and inclusion. For example, a student mentioned their group contemplating whether or not to ask women at a shelter about their abuse experiences (ultimately, going a different route after further reflection on their research goals). Another student discussed their group grappling with not having the proper survey sample for questions meant to address size-inclusive clothing for a popular women’s athleisure brand (and their decision to acknowledge this limitation in the write up of their data). Going forward, we would consider including a specific prompt to further allow for reflection related to DEI and ethics. Questions in this document were revised to support the aim of balancing reflectiveness and learning objectives (without leading the students to specific conclusions).\n\nRecommended Resources Related to the Assignment\n\nWatch\n\nCrash Course [CrashCourse] (2018, April 18).

Journal of health care for the poor and underserved, 21(3), 879–897. https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.0.0323\n\nLimitations/Challenges of Implementing the Assignment\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic allowed for an innovative spirit that led to the development of this GIFT but also presented certain challenges. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the exploration of certain methods was curtailed. For example, there were workarounds needed for methods like ethnography or interviewing. Because the information needed to be delivered asynchronously due to COVID-19 parameters, the ethics additions to the course, which were significant, still felt insufficient in depth. This was due to the sensitive nature of the topics and the lack of rich, in person, real-time discussion.\n\nHowever, in a traditional or asynchronous class, it may be a challenge for instructors teaching our GIFT to create the conducive social/physical environment students need to engage with these topics. Instructors should work to manage emotional responses, nonverbal cues, etc. toward enriched (even vulnerable) depths of conversation. For both the diverse ethics examples as well as the social issues related to each client, robust interpersonal discussion should be encouraged among students where communication aspects like tone of voice, reflection on previous commenters etc. can add to the weight of the discussion. Furthermore, there may be additional limitations for this GIFT in a summer course where there may be less time to select groups, a client and a social issue, all of which require larger portions of class time.\n\nInstructors teaching smaller courses may find that it is more challenging to sort students into groups with similar interests based on their survey responses. In larger course sections, we were easily able to assign groups where students had at least some evident shared interest. When there are less students in total, it can be more challenging to identify clear areas of overlap. It is important to take care in this step to ensure that a student does not feel excluded or unenthusiastic as someone without as much direct interest in the project.\n\nFinally, it is important to make sure that students continue to view the project from the perspective of their client, operating in an ethical manner that serves the best interest of the organization. Because students have selected social issues about which they are passionate, some may at first be inclined to focus on solving the challenge itself, rather than what it means to represent a client engaging with the issue. This is both a limitation – in that it requires additional attention from the instructor – and an opportunity for students to engage critically with what it means to operate ethically as a public relations professional.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, R.

Initially, students engage in a comprehensive team case study, conducting in-depth background research and critical analysis of real-world organizational crisis communication. Subsequently, students prepare a simulated press conference, addressing hypothetical scenarios for the same organizations analyzed in their case studies. The scenarios integrate various social issues, such as diversity and inclusion, ethics, environment, and human rights. In preparation, students apply media training guidelines to enhance their verbal and nonverbal communication skills as crisis spokespersons. This pedagogical approach fosters the development of essential knowledge, skills, and abilities in students, as outlined in the Commission on Public Relations Education’s (CPRE) 2018 “Fast Forward” report. These competencies include knowledge in crisis management and social issues, writing and public speaking skills, and the cultivation of problem-solving, creative, and critical thinking abilities.\n\nGIFT Overview\n\nRationale\n\nThis crisis communication course integrates two sequential team assignments – a case study and a simulated press conference. Effective execution of a crisis press conference simulation requires a comprehensive understanding of the organization and crisis communication, writing and communication skills, and problem-solving ability. Researchers in higher education argue that a scaffolding pedagogical approach, including sequential assignments, facilitates student achievement in key learning outcomes such as writing skill, problem-solving, and engagement (Acosta-Gonzaga & Ramirez-Arellano, 2022; Hunker et al., 2014). This scaffolding approach provides students with the necessary support and guidance to motivate their engagement in active learning (Acosta-Gonzaga & Ramirez-Arellano, 2022).\n\nCase studies are often used in public relations education and practice because the method offers rich data about events, organizations, people, processes, and various circumstances (Stacks, 2016). In the case study component of this course, teams select and analyze recent, real-world organizational crises to evaluate the effectiveness of crisis communication. Each team delivers a comprehensive analysis and presentation, and both are graded by the instructor. Upon completion, students gain in-depth knowledge about the organization and its crisis communication practice. Additionally, students receive feedback on their writing and communication skills and critical thinking abilities from the instructor and peers. Reflecting on feedback from both the instructor and peers (see Appendix A) helps students improve their skills for the subsequent team assignment: the simulation. Thus, the strategic design of the case study and press conference simulation as sequential assignments provides an optimal opportunity for students to develop their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs).\n\nPublic relations educators suggest that classroom simulations are effective pedagogical approaches in crisis communication education (O’Donnell, 2020; Veil, 2010; Wang, 2017). Role-playing activity in a simulated crisis conference enhances students’ competencies in crisis management (Wang, 2017). Crisis simulation and collaboration with journalism students have proven to effectively enhance learning about real-life crisis communication (Veil, 2010). Additionally, simulated media interview exercises have been found to improve students’ competencies in business acumen, media communication skills, and critical thinking (O’Donnell, 2020). Across various disciplines, simulated activities facilitate students’ development of skills and abilities such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration (Chernikova et al., 2020). These studies recommend implementing a simulation in the crisis classroom as well as in other public relations courses (O’Donnell, 2020; Veil, 2010; Wang, 2017). However, guidelines from a media training perspective are rarely discussed when simulations are implemented in classrooms.\n\nMedia training is often considered essential for senior public relations professionals and executives because top executives frequently become spokespersons in crisis communication (Wang & Wang, 2014). Strong verbal and nonverbal communication skills have always been vital for public relations professionals, particularly in today’s social media landscape and its visually driven nature. Public relations professionals have noted the importance of visuals in social media communication (Conner, 2018). Consequently, current assignments draw from research to encourage students to develop their verbal and nonverbal communication skills as spokespersons in crises (e.g., De Waele et al., 2018, 2020).\n\nDe Waele et al. (2018, 2020) recommended several visual cues for spokespersons’ media training, particularly in crises. These cues include maintaining a stable, open, and relaxed posture, showing one’s face directly to the audience (e.g., interviewer or camera), and using a simple background to avoid visual distractions. The researchers also highlighted the importance of verbal and vocal cues, noting that a lower voice pitch can enhance the speaker’s credibility. For clearer message delivery, the study suggested using only two or three key messages, having short quotes, and employing information vivid language, such as metaphors or examples. To focus on honesty and empathy, they recommended phrases like “we do, we know, we care” and simplifying key messages (De Waele et al., 2020, p. 6). An organizational crisis is a “perceptual” event (Coombs, 2015) where stakeholders interpret the message from the content itself and the manner of its delivery. Thus, it is essential for aspiring public relations professionals to be ready for managing media interactions and navigating highly “visible” social media communication during crises.\n\nConnection to CPRE’s Fast Forward Report\n\nThe Commission on Public Relations Education’s 2018 Fast Forward report stated that specific knowledge, skills, abilities, and traits are needed for entry-level public relations professionals, bridging the educational-industry gap (O’Neil et al., 2018). Sequential assignments in this course are designed to cultivate these competencies for students. First, students acquire in-depth knowledge about crisis management and various social issues. During the simulated press conference, they deal with hypothetical crisis scenarios involving the same real-world organizations they analyzed in their first project. These hypothetical crisis scenarios concern social issues such as diversity and inclusion, ethics, environment, and human rights. For instance, a hypothetical crisis scenario involves a coffee chain company accused of unethical sourcing and worker exploitation in developing countries. The allegation accuses the company’s suppliers of using forced labor under inhumane conditions to produce coffee across multiple developing countries.\n\nStudents have multiple opportunities to hone their writing, public speaking, and nonverbal communication skills while completing the assignments including five major deliverables: a case study paper and presentation, a response statement, social media strategy with message examples, and simulated press conference. The case study paper requires extensive secondary research on the organization and its crisis communication strategies. Students apply theoretical frameworks such as Coombs’ Situational Crisis Communication Theory and Benoit’s Image Restoration Theory for critical analysis. They also develop persuasive key messages for crisis response statements and social media. During the simulation, students present these messages and engage in Q&A sessions with “media representatives.” Preparation for the simulation includes practicing media interviews, video recording themselves and reflections, and applying media training guidelines to potential interview questions (see the Press Conference Simulation Assignment Guide). This method of self-recording and reflection is an effective tool for enhancing oral communication skills (Tailab & Marsh, 2019).\n\nThrough sequential projects, students enhance their problem- solving, creative, and critical thinking abilities by analyzing past crises to effectively devise future organizational communication strategies. Students also create authentic and realistic social media content for the hypothetical crises and participate in a peer feedback loop, which involves both offering and receiving critiques on their written, verbal, and nonverbal communication skills. The reflective and collaborative approach in the preparation process fosters the development of problem-solving, creative, and critical thinking abilities. Furthermore, students are required to strategically assign roles and responsibilities for conducting Q/A sessions with the classmates acting as media representatives.\n\nAssignment Learning Objectives\n\nGain knowledge of the principles and theories in organizational crisis communication\n\nUnderstand various social issues and stakeholders’ expectations\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of crisis communication execution\n\nEnhance critical and creative thinking, problem solving abilities\n\nApply theoretical knowledge into practice\n\nImprove proficiency in written, verbal, and nonverbal communication\n\nConnection to Public Relations Practice and/or Theory\n\nEdelman’s 2022 Connected Crisis study revealed important insights that crisis management is increasingly required for communication and corporate leaders. The report highlights a shift in stakeholder expectations, particularly among Gen Z, who demand transparent communication and wield significant influence over crisis communication through social and digital platforms (Edelman, 2022). Given the rising prominence of social issues in corporate operation and communication, it is critical for future PR professionals to understand a broad spectrum of social issues and their relevance to communication practices. In this course, students delve into Coombs’ (2007) Situational Crisis Communication Theory and Benoit’s (1997) Image Restoration Theory. Students apply these theories, along with other principles, in practice by writing critical analyses, formulating response strategies, and suggesting recommendations, thereby deepening their understanding of the connection between research and practice.\n\nHow the Assignment was Class-Tested\n\nThis course, a required 3000-level offering, is designed for PR majors and minors, mostly upper-class students. A prerequisite introductory PR course is essential, ensuring students possess a foundational understanding of public relations principles. Upon completing the first assignment – a team case study paper and presentation – students are equipped with confidence in comprehending the organization and its crisis communication practices. This foundational knowledge is crucial as they progress to the simulated press conference, which employs hypothetical scenarios for practical application. Ideally, conducting the simulation in a media broadcasting studio or an auditorium-style classroom is recommended, as it provides a more realistic experience to students.\n\nEvidence of Learning Outcomes\n\nThrough this course, students acquire a comprehensive understanding about crisis management including its process, various models and strategies, communication planning, engagement with various stakeholders, and critical evaluation of an organization’s crisis communication. The assessment of student progress in writing and public speaking skills is facilitated through both formal and informal methods, utilizing multiple deliverables. A senior colleague observed the class and commented:\n\n[I]t is excellent for students’ portfolios, and it underscores that research and theory guide message design. She is also having students facilitate press conferences in our media studio, giving students applied experience where from an instructional design perspective, it’s clear that assignments for the course build on one another. And, in addition to the professor, students provide feedback to one another.\n\nTemplate Assignment Guides\n\nCase Study Assignment Guide\n\nOverview\n\nThis six-week team project involves a comprehensive case analysis that covers organizational crisis history, background, culture, stakeholders, and critical analysis of crisis responses. Students gain a deep understanding of both the organization and its crisis communication strategies. In addition, students apply theoretical concepts to real-world cases. The final deliverables include a team paper and presentation.\n\nInstruction\n\nEach team submits a comprehensive case study paper and presentation. The paper should encompass a crisis communication study including analyses of the organization, theoretical framework and review of previous literature (professional and scholarly), crisis timeline and responses, and conclusion. The process for completing this assignment is divided into three steps: 1) submit three potential recent cases for the professor’s review, 2) upon receiving approval from the professor, teams start working on the case analysis and periodically sharing their progress for the professor’s feedback, and 3) submit the final paper, presentation, and peer and self-evaluation. The case study includes:\n\nTitle page\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThis one-page summary is tailored for busy professionals, summarizing key findings, evaluation, and/or implications for their future communication practice. Highlight how these insights are beneficial to the organization, the specific situation, and related issues.\n\nSynopsis\n\nOrganization Background and Industry Overview\n\nSummarize the organization’s history, mission, vision, and values. Include communication campaigns as well as the industry overview.\n\nCrisis Situation and Timeline\n\nComprehensive details of the crisis, its impact, and timeline of the crisis.\n\nAddress its significance, financial and reputational impacts, stakeholder reactions, and media responses.\n\nTheory, Principles, and Concepts\n\nIntroduce and summarize specific theory or concepts applied in the case study. For example, discuss Coombs’ SCCT (2007) or Benoit’s IRT (1997) in the section, how either theory (or other principles) makes sense of the case.\n\nCrisis Communication, Action, and Analysis\n\nAnalyze the organization’s crisis actions and response by tactic or media type or chronicle order or stakeholders.\n\nExplain how the organization communicated about the crisis to stakeholders.\n\nIdentify the crisis response strategies based on the concepts, theories, models, and critical analysis of organization’s response and its appropriateness.\n\nConclusion\n\nDiscuss implications, contributions, recommendations, and future directions for the organization and societal impacts.\n\nReferences (excluded in the page limit)\n\nInclude a minimum of 10 credible scholarly and professional references relevant to the topic. An appropriate scholarly study should be 1) published in a communication journal or relevant fields, and 2) an original study with primary data collection (not a review of a book). Professional reference refers to mass media (e.g., New York Times, Wall Street Journal) or reliable professional publications (e.g., PR Week, PR News, PRSA’s Strategies and Tactics, Marketing Dive, McKinsey Quarterly, Harvard Business Review).\n\nPresentation\n\nAbout 15-20 minutes including Q/A session with all team members presenting.\n\nSubmit visual aids (PPT, Prezi, video, etc.) on Blackboard. Consider readability and attractiveness of the slide design (e.g., font size, color, relevant visuals/videos, logos, simple layout).

Also, submit a self-evaluation form to reflect on your own performance in this project.\n\nEvaluation criteria: Focus on verbal and nonverbal communication skills, the ability to answer questions effectively, and response appropriateness.\n\nPress Conference Simulation Assignment Guide\n\nOverview\n\nEach team hosts a simulated crisis press conference based on a given hypothetical scenario, focusing on the same organization analyzed in the case study. Team members play the role of spokespersons, responsible for representing the organization, delivering the crisis response, and facilitating the Q/A sessions. This four-week project culminates in a set of deliverables: a response statement, social media strategy and message examples, and a simulated press conference presentation.\n\nInstruction\n\nThe objective is to enable students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and equip students with the skills necessary to perform as effective crisis spokespersons, thereby enhancing their proficiency in crisis communication. The hypothetical crises involve one or multiple social issues in the context of diversity and inclusion, ethics, environment, or human rights.\n\nFive-step process for a successful press conference:\n\n1. Team will receive a unique crisis for its organization.\n\nEach team receives a hypothetical crisis scenario.\n\nCollaborate with team members to determine the details of the crisis, preparing to address all potential media questions during the press conference.\n\nLearn about other teams’ crisis scenarios and prepare a minimum seven questions per scenario, ranging from easy (e.g., fact-checking type) to challenging questions (e.g., organizational deception or mismanagement). You will ask those questions to other teams by playing a role of “media” during the conference.\n\n2. Team will submit a paper containing three components: a response statement, social media strategy, and social media message examples.\n\nResponse statement (one-page): Write a statement outlining key facts and updates about the crisis (e.g., current situation, impact of the crisis, organizational actions, and next steps) and related social issue. This is a statement that the spokesperson will communicate with “media” at the beginning of the conference.\n\nSocial media strategy\n\nSelect one or two social media platforms, justifying their relevance to your stakeholders. Explain your stakeholders and their significance to the organization and the crisis.\n\nDevelop a message strategy for the selected social media platforms, providing a rationale for its appropriateness.\n\nOutline a timeline and frequency for your social media posts.\n\nSocial media message examples\n\nWrite realistic social media messages aligned with your suggested strategy, considering elements like hashtags, account names, visuals, etc.\n\n3. Spokesperson training (all members)\n\nSummarize the key do’s and don’ts for spokesperson training based on course materials (Coombs, Ch. 4 [2015]; De Waele et al. [2018, 2020]).\n\nRecord a video of yourself presenting the statement without looking at the notes or statement.\n\nVideo recording: Each student should create a 1-2 minute video, using their cellphone, demonstrating a stand-up position.\n\nReview and reflect: Utilize the established do’s and don’ts to review your own and team members’ videos and share constructive feedback. Please reflect on each other’s comments and practice your presentation.\n\nIn-class workshop: Share a one-paragraph summary in class, discussing improvement in verbal and nonverbal communication skills gained from the media training process.\n\n4. Press conference day: The simulation will be about 12-15 minutes per team and all team members must speak during the conference.\n\nPresenting role: Host the crisis press conference, utilizing a one-page response statement for key information. No PowerPoint slides or visual aids are permitted.\n\nNon-presenting role: Act as a “journalist,” attending and engaging in all other teams’ conferences by asking questions.\n\n5. Peer and self-evaluation: Using the provided evaluation forms to assess the performance of each team after presentations. Also, submit a self-evaluation form to reflect on your own performance in this project.\n\nEvaluation criteria: Focus on verbal and nonverbal communication skills, the ability to answer questions effectively, and response appropriateness.\n\nAssignment Grading Criteria or Rubric\n\nThe Commission on Public Relations Education’s Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities are intended to be measured in both team assignments – case study and press conference simulation as following:\n\nKnowledge in crisis management and social issue\n\nSkills in writing, public speaking, and communication\n\nAbilities in problem-solving, critical, and creative thinking\n\nCrisis Case Study Paper (Total 100 points)\n\nExecutive Summary & Synopsis (10)\n\nConcisely summarizes key findings and valuable recommendations.
