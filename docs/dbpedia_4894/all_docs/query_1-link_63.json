        "text": "René Vidal: Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor\n\nRené Vidal has been named a Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor at the University of Pennsylvania. The announcement was made by President Liz Magill and Interim Provost Beth A. Winkelstein.\n\nDr. Vidal, a global pioneer of data science, is now the Rachleff University Professor, with joint appointments in the department of radiology in the Perelman School of Medicine and the department of electrical and systems engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.\n\n“René Vidal is an undisputed world leader in deploying data science, engineering, and medical innovation to advance the frontiers of machine learning and health care,” President Magill said. “Penn is an epicenter for such ingenuity, exemplified by our Penn Integrates Knowledge program, and Professor Vidal’s pathbreaking scholarship makes him a perfect fit. We’re excited to have him here.”\n\nBefore Penn, Dr. Vidal was the Herschel Seder Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where he taught since 2004. Most recently, his work has focused on the development of theory and algorithms to analyze complex data sets, such as biomedical data, images, and videos, as well as the mathematical foundations of deep learning and its applications to such new domains as computer vision and biomedical data science. His lab has created new technologies across a wide range of areas, including face and object recognition, motion segmentation, signal processing, gesture and skill recognition in robotic surgery, the assessment of surgical skill in surgical videos, and the detection, classification, and tracking of blood cells in holographic images.\n\nDr. Vidal received the 2021 McCluskey Award of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society for outstanding and innovative contributions during the past 15 years, especially for his work in advancing computer vision and pattern recognition. He has received a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, a Sloan Research Fellowship, and the Aggarwal Prize of the International Association of Pattern Recognition, among numerous other awards. He is the inaugural director of the Mathematical Institute for Data Science, which brings together mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, and engineers to develop principles for the analysis and interpretation of massive amounts of complex data across such interdisciplinary fields as computer vision, language/speech processing, robotics, astronomy, medicine, and health. He earned a PhD and an MS in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, an MS in engineering and a BS (summa cum laude) in industrial engineering from the Catholic University of Chile.\n\n“René Vidal’s pioneering work exemplifies the core commitments of our work at Penn,” Interim Provost Winkelstein said. “Our innovative faculty and students are forging the creative new ideas and ambitious, multi-disciplinary solutions that shape the future. Professor Vidal’s research—bringing together methods from medicine, engineering, computer science, and data science—demonstrates the power of solutions that cross traditional disciplinary and intellectual boundaries to tangibly change people’s lives around the world.”\n\nThe Penn Integrates Knowledge program is a University-wide initiative to recruit exceptional faculty members whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge across disciplines. PIK professors are appointed in at least two schools at Penn.\n\nThe Rachleff University Professorship is a gift of Debra and Andrew S. Rachleff. Andrew Rachleff is a 1980 graduate of Penn and serves as a member of the Board of Trustees and the School of Engineering and Applied Science Board of Advisors. He is co-founder and executive chair of Wealthfront Corporation, an investment services firm in Palo Alto, California.\n\nPenn Medicine and La Salle University Receive $7.5 Million Howley Foundation Gift to Support the ASPIRE Program\n\nPenn Medicine has partnered with the Howley Foundation and La Salle University to launch the ASPIRE Program at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP), marking an important investment in the future of nursing. The program will support local high school students in Philadelphia with a goal of increasing diversity in health care and offering opportunities for economic mobility. The program is supported by a commitment from the Howley Foundation of up to $7.5 million.\n\nEach year, up to 25 outstanding high-school juniors will be selected to be ASPIRE scholars and participate in an enrichment program lasting for the reminder of their high-school careers. The enrichment program offers mentorship and exposure to health care, the role of nurses, patient safety, and more through a series of interactive and hands-on sessions at the hospital. The first cohort of high-school students begin working with juniors in early 2023.\n\nUpon graduation and fulfillment of requirements, students then have the opportunity to pursue a bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) at La Salle University with financial support from federal grants, a school scholarship, and a scholarship from the ASPIRE Program itself—which is funded by the Howley Foundation and Penn Medicine. During that time, they will have the opportunity to apply for paid positions at HUP, where they can practice their skills and gain more relevant experience.\n\n“ASPIRE firmly aligns with Penn Medicine’s and HUP’s goals to offer pipeline opportunities for members of our community to continue cultivating an inclusive workforce and providing outstanding patient care,” said Colleen Mattioni, the chief nurse executive at HUP. “The ASPIRE Program will welcome a diverse pool of young people into an environment of research, innovation, and evidenced based practice, and high quality clinical care. Of course, we will benefit from participants’ enthusiasm, curiosity, and passion.”\n\nThe first portion of the program consists of lecture-type lessons and hands-on learning in the hospital for the high school students. Instructors are HUP nurses and hospital staff. While the students will not participate in clinical work with hospital patients, they will have opportunities to observe and assist nurses and other clinicians. At the end of this part of ASPIRE, participants will also have a better understanding of the life of a nurse and the skills and approach required to excel at the job.\n\n“Those who begin nursing school may not have much experience with the field unless they’ve volunteered somewhere or perhaps [if] they have family members who are nurses,” said Beth A. Smith, the corporate director of nursing professional development at HUP. “Not only will this program attract a more diverse generation of future nurses, but it will also provide a unique opportunity to see the impact nurses make while providing them with skills and giving them a strong head start in a nursing career.”\n\nDuring their college years, the ASPIRE scholars will consult with advisors who will offer guidance and support on academic and other matters affecting their education. They will also have regular check-ins with their peers and instructors from the program.\n\n“We are excited to see the ASPIRE Program grow over time and look forward to creating an environment where ASPIRE scholars can thrive academically and professionally,” said Ms. Smith.\n\nThe ASPIRE Program at HUP builds upon the model established by the Howley Foundation for the Cleveland Clinic in 2017.\n\n“The central focus of the Howley Foundation is supporting quality educational opportunities, and the many wonderful institutions of learning in the Philadelphia region have served generations of our own family well,” said Nick Howley, chair and founder of the foundation. “We believe these programs are the keys to creating meaningful social and economic mobility, and we are thrilled to work with Penn Medicine and La Salle, whose strengths align so closely with our mission. We look forward to seeing the ASPIRE model in Philadelphia and providing the region’s students an educational continuum that spans exposure to the nursing profession, training and mentorship, and very real opportunities for employment.”\n\nPenn Dental Medicine and Penn Nursing: Launch of Dual Degree Program in Nutritional Science\n\nPenn Dental Medicine and Penn Nursing have announced a new dual-degree, enabling interested and qualified students to earn a Master of Science in Nutrition Science (MSNS) along with their DMD. This new offering brings the total number of dual-degree options Penn Dental Medicine offers to nine, including six funded programs and three self-funded.\n\nThe MSNS is a unique asynchronous online format consisting of ten courses and a capstone project. DMD students who pursue the MSNS can get credit for two of their dental school courses toward the ten required for the program and are eligible to apply to the MSNS in the spring of their first year.\n\n“I think that this type of training can significantly enhance the dentist’s ability to successfully address oral health issues, as nutrition plays a vital role in both systemic and oral health,” said Uri Hangorsky, associate dean for student affairs at Penn Dental Medicine. He noted that due to the intensity of the DMD curriculum, nutrition cannot be taught in great depth as part of students’ dental education.\n\n“The diversity of coursework offered in the MSNS allows students to build a practical evidence-based foundation to promote nutrition-focused public heath as it relates to oral health and disease,” added Kathleen Boesze-Battaglia, assistant dean for academic initiatives at Penn Dental Medicine.\n\nAs with all of the dual-degree options, this program affords students able to meet the rigors of both the DMD and dual-degree the opportunity to make the most of their time at Penn and the close association Penn Dental Medicine has with other schools within the University. Each dual-degree program sets its own admission standards and being a DMD student does not constitute automatic acceptance into a dual-degree program. In addition to the new MSNS, the other dual degree opportunities include a master of bioethics, master of science in bioengineering, master in law, master of science in higher education, master of public health, master of science in translational research, master of business administration, and juris doctor degree in law.\n\nOffice of the Provost Requests Nominations of Penn Fellows and Mellon Fellows by February 15\n\nThe Office of the Provost requests nominations for the fifteenth cohort of Penn Fellows and the third cohort of Mellon Fellows.\n\nThe Penn Fellows program provides select mid-career faculty members (newly tenured to early full professors) with opportunities to develop their leadership skills, build networks, think strategically, interact with campus leaders, and develop a cross-university network of support as they move through their careers. Previous Penn Fellows have subsequently served as deans, department chairs, and vice provosts.\n\nThe Mellon Fellows program seeks to support mid-career faculty members (newly tenured to full professors) from core humanities and arts disciplines and from departments that are strongly inflected by the humanities, and/or scholars whose work is strongly based on cultural/historical analysis. The program is intended to orient arts and humanities faculty members to the fundamentals of leadership roles, encourage collaboration and community across departments and disciplines, and imbue the next generation of higher education leaders with humanistic culture and values.\n\nParticipants are expected to participate in the leadership development sessions that are created for these programs. These sessions will be scheduled over the course of the 2023-2024 academic year. Participants also will be invited to participate in the Provost’s Leadership Academy.\n\nCandidates for both programs should be mid-career faculty members (newly tenured to full professors) with a demonstrated record of academic excellence, administrative leadership potential, and interest in higher education leadership. Of particular interest are faculty members who have not yet held senior higher education leadership positions, faculty members from groups that are historically underrepresented in higher education leadership, and faculty members who can further contribute to the excellence and diversity of our campus leadership.\n\nThe Mellon Fellows program is limited to faculty members in core humanities and arts disciplines, from departments that are strongly inflected by the humanities, and/or whose work is strongly based on cultural/historical analysis.\n\nNominations should be submitted to provost-fac@upenn.edu by February 15, 2023.\n\nNominations should identify the preferred program and include a letter of support from the dean or department chair and the candidate’s curriculum vitae. Previously nominated candidates may be re-nominated.\n\nQuestions can be addressed to Connie Chang, executive director of faculty affairs in the Office of the Provost, at conniech@upenn.edu.\n\nDwight Evans, Psychiatry\n\nDwight Landis Evans, a professor emeritus and former chair of psychiatry, medicine and neuroscience in the Perelman School of Medicine, died on November 19, 2022. He was 75.\n\nBorn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Dr. Evans enjoyed weekend shopping at the bustling Central Market, attended J.P. McCaskey High School, and spent his summers at his grandfather’s cottage in Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. He first attended college at the University of Maryland, then received his BS in biology from Elizabethtown College in 1970. He then earned an MS in psychology and neuroendocrinology from Bucknell University in 1972 and a medical degree from Temple University in 1976. After completing a residency at the University of North Carolina Memorial Hospital and a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholarship, Dr. Evans was appointed to the faculty of the UNC department of psychiatry in 1980. In 1992, he moved to the University of Florida, where he chaired the department of psychiatry and directed the Psychoneuroimmunology Laboratory. In 1997, he received one of the highest honors in the field of psychiatry, the Klerman Lifetime Research Award of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance.\n\nAfter five years in Florida, Dr. Evans came to Penn’s School of Medicine in 1997. Two years later, he was appointed the Ruth Meltzer Professor of Psychiatry (Almanac October 5, 1999). He chaired Penn’s department of psychiatry until 2016, one of the longest tenures at Penn Medicine. In addition, Dr. Evans oversaw the establishment of Penn Behavioral Health and served as psychiatrist-in-chief of the Penn Health System, director of the Penn Comprehensive Depression Center, and co-director of the Penn Neuroscience Center. A renowned investigator and clinician, his pioneering translational research on the neurobiology of stress and depression was continuously funded by the NIH for more than 30 years. Dr. Evans led the creation of the NIH-funded Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center and served as its inaugural director. He also served on several Penn-wide committees, and in 2000, chaired the Search Committee for an Executive Vice President/Dean of the School of Medicine. In 2015, he was named the inaugural Roehrhoff Rickels Professor of Psychiatry; the next year, he retired from Penn and took emeritus status.\n\nDr. Evans was known internationally for his research on the impact of stress and depression on other diseases, including cancer, AIDS and cardiac cases. As such, he and his work received many honors. He received the Award for Research in Psychiatry from the American Psychiatric Association and the William C. Menninger Memorial Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Science of Mental Health from the American College of Physicians. Outside of Penn, Dr. Evans was president of the American College of Psychiatrists and of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) and served on numerous other boards and committees. He published hundreds of academic papers, served on the editorial boards for many journals, and wrote and edited several books, including the influential Treating and Preventing Adolescent Mental Health Disorders (2005), which was awarded Best Book in Clinical Medicine by the Association of American Publishers.\n\n“Despite the enormity of his professional contributions, Dwight will be remembered best for the personal impact he had on so many,” wrote Dr. Evans’ family in an online tribute. “His generosity and compassion toward others were boundless and constant throughout his life. Never seeking praise, attention, or recognition, Dwight would stop at nothing to help those around him, be it a loved one, a colleague, friend, or stranger. Despite a career marked by many accomplishments, Dwight was above all else a loving husband, father, and grandfather.” Outside of his professional duties, he enjoyed fishing, sports, the golden oldies, animals, and a quality “dad joke.”\n\nDr. Evans is survived by his wife of 52 years, Janet (nee Strickler) Evans; his children, Liz Evans, Meredith Roche, Ben Evans, and Chris Evans; his sons-in-law, Hadi Halazun and Michael Roche; his daughter-in-law, Francie Wheeler Evans; and his grandchildren, Tripp, Will and Chole Roche, Zayn Halazun, and Wilder Evans. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Dr. Evans’ name may be made to the Dwight L. Evans Memorial Fund, which supports psychiatric residency training at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine (www.pennmedicine.org/dwightevansmemorialfund). Checks can be made payable to Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, c/o Dept. of Psychiatry, 3535 Market Street, Suite 750,\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania 19104. Please note “in memory of Dwight Evans” in the memo line.\n\nCharles Harris, DRIA\n\nCharles Somerville Harris, the first Black director of the division of recreation and intercollegiate athletics at Penn and later the executive vice president at Averett University in Danville, Virginia, died on December 7, 2022. He was 71.\n\nBorn in Richmond, Virginia and raised in Clarksville, Virginia, Mr. Harris grew up attending segregated schools, including his alma mater, West End High School in Mecklenburg County. In 1973, he received a bachelor’s degree in mass media arts from Hampton Institute (now University), then launched a career on campus as a media services employee at the University Nursing School. He also held an internship as a writer at Newsweek magazine. While pursuing a degree at the University of Michigan Graduate School of Journalism, Mr. Harris worked in the University of Michigan’s department of intercollegiate athletics, eventually advancing to assistant director.\n\nIn 1979, Mr. Harris accepted the position of director of intercollegiate athletics and recreation at the University of Pennsylvania (Almanac November 15, 1979). With this appointment, he became the first Black athletic director at an Ivy League school (as well as the youngest person yet to have held the position). Under Mr. Harris, Penn adopted its first official athletic policy in three decades, won three straight Ivy football titles after he hired Jerry Berndt as head coach (1982-1984, including Penn’s first in 23 years), embarked on a program of expansion of athletic facilities, and set a school record for Ivy championships (eight in 1984). Thirteen sports won a total of 28 Ivy League championships during Mr. Harris’ tenure. In addition, the Quakers’ men’s fencing program were NCAA champions in 1980-81, and two fencers won individual NCAA titles. “He has made a great difference to the athletic program,” said President Sheldon Hackney (Almanac May 14, 1985). “We will benefit for a long time from the changes he has made and from the efforts of the coaches he has brought to Penn.”\n\nMr. Harris left Penn in 1985 to become director of athletics at Arizona State University, where he was the first Black athletic director of an NCAA Division I program. The next year, Mr. Harris and his wife Lenora formed a consulting practice, Excel Development Systems. In 1996, Mr. Harris became commissioner of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, a position he held until 2003. He was next named director of athletics at Averett University, making him the first African American appointed in the USA South Athletic Conference. He continued to advance his career at Averett: In 2007, he took on the additional title of vice president of student services, then became executive vice president, both firsts for an African American there. Mr. Harris retired from Averett in 2021.\n\nOver the course of his career, Mr. Harris served on nearly 30 NCAA committees and mentored 14 college athletic directors. He received the Pioneer Award from the John McLendon Foundation and was listed as one of Eighty People to Watch in 1980 by Philadelphia Magazine. The All-America Sports Foundation awarded him its Lifetime Achievement Award and its Commissioners Award, and he received the Leadership Award from the National Collegiate Athletic Association. He was inducted into the West End High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2001 and was included in the NAACP list of Who’s Who in America. Averett University will begin construction on the Charles S. Harris Field House in 2024.\n\nOutside of his professional responsibilities, Mr. Harris co-owned a family farm and traveled to six continents.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 48 years, Lenora Billings-Harris; his sister, the Hon. Lillian Harris Ransom; half brothers-in-law, Arthur Billings (Andrea) and Tracee Billings (Quinnetta); and numerous cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. A celebration of life was held on December 17, 2022. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Averett University, 420 West Main St., Danville, Virginia 24541, Averett Ascending Capital Campaign, designated for the Charles S. Harris Field House (https://www.averett.edu/giving/harrisfieldhouse/).\n\nCharles McMahon, Materials Science & Engineering\n\nCharles Joseph McMahon Jr., MtE’55, a professor emeritus of materials science and engineering in Penn’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, died on December 10. He was 89.\n\nDr. McMahon graduated from Penn’s School of Engineering with a degree in metallurgical engineering in 1955, then earned a graduate degree from MIT. In 1964, he joined Penn’s faculty as an assistant professor of metallurgy and materials science; he was promoted to associate professor in 1968 and to full professor in 1974. While at Penn, he was active in his field of study. In 1975, he earned the American Society for Metals’ Marion Howe Medal for the best paper; the following year, he won the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers’ Mathewson Gold Medal Award. In 1980, he was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering; the NAE cited his “contributions to the understanding and mitigation of grain boundary embrittlement of alloy steels.” He was an early member of Penn’s Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter, and as computers became popular in the 1990s, he developed a CD-ROM that displayed information about 3D materials science. This “smart textbook,” which accompanied Dr. McMahon’s nationally renowned course The Bicycle and the Walkman, was one of the first online learning initiatives, and Dr. McMahon earned an NSF grant to expand on this innovation.\n\nDr. McMahon served on Penn’s University Council, chairing its Committee on Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics during the 1980s. He also served in the Faculty Senate (where he chaired the Committee on the Faculty from 2001-2002) and on several ad-hoc university-wide committees (including as chair of the President’s Committee on University Life in 1989-1990). Dr. McMahon made his voice heard on athletic issues around campus, penning several op-eds in Almanac’s pages on the subject (e.g., Almanac October 27, 1987 and February 27, 2001). In 1992, he won Penn Engineering’s S. Reid Warren Award for Distinguished Teaching, and nine years later, he won a Lindback Award (Almanac April 17, 2001). “Students commented on how creative Dr. McMahon is in the classroom and colleagues noted his inventive teaching methods through the use of electronic media,” said his Lindback citation. “Students mentioned his unique role as an advisor and mentor and many wrote about the impact his classes have had on their lives and careers.” In 2002, Dr. McMahon retired from Penn and took emeritus status.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 63 years, Helen (nee O’Brien); four children, Charles Jr. (Stacy Dutton), Elise McMahon, Robert, David (Rebecca Berman); two grandchildren, Veronica and Madeline; his siblings, Anthony, Kevin (Ellen), Mary Ellen (James Smallwood) and John (JoAnn); and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Christine. A memorial mass is planned for the near future.\n\nWeitzman School's Disrupt the Reflection Competition Winners Announced\n\nAs part of a campus-wide initiative to make Penn more hospitable to birds, a fall 2022 ideas competition asked Weitzman students to design exterior window film for select buildings in order to reduce fatal collisions (“bird strikes”), and five winning proposals have been selected.\n\nFirst Place\n\n“Animalia in Motion” by Sara Sterchak (MLA’23)\n\n“Life Imprint” by Wenliu Tu (MArch’24) and Luxin Zhong (MArch’24)\n\nSecond Place\n\n“In / Out” by Isobel (Zoe) Morrison (MLA’23)\n\n“Staggered Transparencies” by Audrey Genest (MLA’23) and Andrew Reichenbach (MFA’23)\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n“Warble Symphony” by Chenxin Shao (MArch’24), Wen Qin, (MArch’24) and Jun Yue (MArch’24)\n\nThe first- and second-place winners will receive a cash award, and their designs will be posted on the Disrupt the Reflection website.\n\nPhiladelphia is located along the Atlantic Americas Flyway, which extends from the tip of South America to the Canadian Arctic. Food sources and nesting areas—from backyards to parks and street trees—support the many billions of migrating birds that travel this route annually. The Penn campus also plays a vital role, providing a seasonal or year-round habitat to some 80 species of birds, but it also presents the risk of collision with glass windows.\n\nEleven buildings on campus were selected as part of the competition brief because of their potential for bird strikes due to the large areas of transparent and reflective surfaces: the Perelman Center for Political Science and Economics, Lauder College House (east facade), Meyerson Hall, Pottruck Fitness Center, Vance Hall, Huntsman Hall at the Wharton School (Locust Walk entrance), Levine Hall, Tangen Hall, Larry Robbins House, Perry World House, and Van Pelt Library (Moelis Family Grand Reading Room).\n\nThe jury included Jeff Goldstein, principal and cofounding partner at DIGSAU; Eva Lew, director of architecture and planning in Penn’s Office of the University Architect; Kate Orff, founding principal of SCAPE and director of the urban design program and the Center for Resilient Cities and Landscapes at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation; Keith Russell, program manager for urban conservation of Audubon Pennsylvania; and Lucinda Sanders, adjunct professor of landscape architecture and design partner and president and CEO of OLIN.\n\nLife Imprint (Lauder College House: East Facing Façade)\n\nWenliu Tu and Luxin Zhong\n\nWhile we enjoy the cozy sunlight and beautiful views of nature from within a protected space made available by huge pieces of glass, we barely understand how much trouble this modern-age innovation has brought to the animals that share the environment with us. This project aims to promote awareness of the urgent issue of bird collisions on campus while serving the function of preventing birds from hitting the east-facing glass facade of the Lauder College House courtyard. Although this building is partially covered with bird-friendly film, the facade of the second floor and above is still a potential hazard due to its large spans of transparent surface, and the reflections of the sky and vegetation, particularly because the courtyard contains several trees surrounded by the glass façade. This student housing and cafeteria location is also densely populated with people and thus can serve as a great location for promoting awareness about bird strikes. This project uses the idea of the mark left by a bird hitting the window as a memorial for their death and a warning to humans, urging everyone who sees it to take action to prevent bird mortality from window collisions. Since the second story and above are the corridors of the student apartments, we avoid blocking the view from inside to the city and Woodland Walk by using the maximum distance grid with the standard of the 2x4 rule.\n\nAnimalia in Motion (Pottruck Fitness Center)\n\nSara Sterchak\n\nThis window film design aims to connect birds, humans, and the fitness-oriented building together through the concept of movement. The Pottruck Fitness Center, a destination for students, faculty and community members, is designed such that each floor is programmed for different kinds of movement. Each of these different exercise types activate the space in a unique way. In order to reflect and emphasize that programming, the window film design associates a different bird movement pattern to each floor of the building. The film displays not only the undulating flight path that a bird travels along, but it also displays the force of their flapping wings that propel them through the air. The exertion of energy that a bird uses to fly can be related to the energy used by the gym occupants executing their workouts. The pattern base uses an abstraction of a bird’s form to generate the rounded triangle shape. This triangle shape pointing in one direction is not only symbolic of a bird in flight, but is also a symbol for the occupants to remember to keep pushing forward on their journey to better physical and mental health.\n\nStaggered Transparency (Larry Robbins House)\n\nAudrey Genest and Andrew Reichenbach\n\nJuxtaposed between historic buildings, the rear façade of the Wharton and Penn Engineering program’s Larry Robbins House has a strong relationship to the exterior courtyard and to the rest of the Penn campus. Taking inspiration from the intricate manganese iron-spot brickwork, we abstracted the image through an iterative patternmaking process. The pattern is made by a grid of circles and hexagons, each with two sizes, and then layered to create the effect of the brick surface. Along with blocking the reflection that is hazardous to birds, the intricate geometries come together to form an organic structure, mimicking the handmade texture of the brickwork.\n\nIn / Out (Moelis Family Grand Reading Room, Van Pelt Library)\n\nIsobel (Zoe) Morrison\n\nInspired by the reflective quality of the window, this intervention proposes a series of stripes, where one side of the stripe is mirrored (facing the interior) and the other side is a buffed mirror-like silver color with a diminished reflection. This intervention aims to maintain what is often magical about buildings full of glass—the ability to see outside while being surrounded by reflection. The collegiate library is an ideal setting for this kind of intervention: the interaction between the interiority of intellectual thought and the exterior environment of social and communal dynamics that are enabled by the college institution. The outside texture of stripes emulates the existing architectural details and the long columns, which draw the eyes to the ground plane where the quad meets the library. Inside, the reflection of the interior alternates with views of College Green outside, creating a unique experience of being both within and outside of the library.\n\nWarble Symphony (Larry Robbins House)\n\nChenxin Shao, Wen Qin, and Jun Yue\n\nWindows and glass facades are threatening the lives of wild birds. Inspired by the melodious chirping around us on campus, our proposal began with acoustic studies of the sound frequency of common species of birds, which include gray catbirds, yellow-throated warblers, and ovenbirds. These birds constitute an important part of the biological environment of the Penn campus. We used their songs to compose the music score of the “warble symphony.” We generated the graphic pattern by further abstracting the frequency of the three species of birds into a composite image that was then pixelated to represent mountains and forests. This approach is meant to symbolize releasing the birds back to their larger population and environment.\n\nOne Step Ahead: Data Minimization, Pseudonymization, and Anonymization\n\nAnother tip in a series provided by the Offices of Information Security, Information Systems & Computing and Audit, Compliance & Privacy\n\nIt’s that time of year again! Data Privacy Awareness Day is January 28, and we are celebrating by highlighting a fundamental principle of data privacy—data minimization.\n\nData minimization can be described as collecting the minimum amount of information that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a specified purpose.\n\nData minimization also means only maintaining data for as long as required to fulfill the specified purpose. Data minimization prevents unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, personal data that is unnecessary to collect and maintain.\n\nIn situations where personal data must be collected, such as University research projects, pseudonymization or anonymization of the data can further protect individuals from unauthorized exposure by rendering them temporarily or permanently unidentifiable. Note the difference between pseudonymizing and anonymizing data.\n\nWhen data is pseudonymized, an individual can be later identified through indirect or additional information, such as a coded number. Anonymized data means it is impossible to restore the identity of the individual because all identifying information has been removed.\n\nAlways carefully assess whether data is genuinely anonymized. For example: the combination of a student’s major and minor, or an employee’s department and years of service, may be enough to identify an individual.\n\nWhen crafting an anonymous survey, be mindful that you do not collect information that is too specific or data which, if combined, could indirectly identify and compromise the privacy of any individuals—then the survey would no longer be truly anonymous.\n\nFor more information, Penn’s Privacy website is www.upenn.edu/privacy.
