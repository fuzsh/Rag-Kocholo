Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts on March 22, 1933, he was the son of the late Jose and Julia Marie (Coracao) Araujo.\n\nNorman married his beloved Barbara on March 4, 2000 at the Chapel of the Sacred Heart, Newton, Massachusetts and is survived by his spouse, Barbara Cartmill Araujo, a stepson, Kevin J. Cartmill and a stepdaughter, Tracey Cartmill Zacharias.\n\nGamson, Bill (d. 2021)\n\nHe created a game of simulated baseball that was a precursor to today’s fantasy sports. As a professor, he devised a role-playing game to help students address societal problems.\n\nBill Gamson, an eminent sociologist who explored the structure of social movements and whose childhood love of games led him to create one that became an inspiration for the fantasy sports industry, died on March 23 at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 87.\n\nThe cause was sarcoma, a type of cancer, his son, Joshua, said.\n\nWhile a young research associate at Harvard, Professor Gamson indulged his enthusiasm for baseball and his attachment to games by creating what he called the National Baseball Seminar, a simulated game in which each person in his group (originally three) had a budget to draft major leaguers for a team. The players were measured throughout the season based on batting average, runs batted in, earned run average and wins.\n\n“We felt these statistics reflected productivity, but in truth there wasn’t a tremendous availability of statistics back then,” Professor Gamson told ESPN the Magazine in 2010. “We knew these four would be published in all the papers.”\n\nWhen he moved to the University of Michigan in 1962, he recruited about 25 people to his game, including Robert Sklar, a history professor. In 1968, Professor Sklar mentioned it to Daniel Okrent, a student he was advising. A decade later, Mr. Okrent invented the more complex Rotisserie League Baseball, which lets its “owners” make in-season trades; it’s considered the closest ancestor to today’s billion-dollar fantasy sports industry.\n\n“There’s no question that the flowering of Rotisserie baseball arose from very rough seeds scattered a dozen years earlier by Bill Gamson and Bob Sklar,” Mr. Okrent, a writer and editor who was the first public editor of The New York Times, wrote in an email. “Would something like Rotisserie have happened otherwise? Probably — but it wouldn’t have been started by me.”\n\nProfessor Gamson thought of his game as a minor part of a career that included authorship of “The Strategy of Social Protest” (1975), a data-driven examination of the success, failures and leadership of 53 social movement organizations from 1800 to 1945.\n\n“What preceded him were studies that saw movements as irrational reactions to stress in society, and his innovation was to flip that and treat the behavior of movements as rational and subject to scientific analysis,” Joshua Gamson, a sociology professor at the University of San Francisco, said in an interview.\n\nThe elder Professor Gamson participated in a protest himself in 1965, when he helped lead a teach-in against the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe teach-in is believed to be the first against the war, staged as American military involvement in Vietnam was accelerating. It began at 8 p.m. on March 24 and lasted for 12 hours as professors and activists gave speeches and seminars to upward of 3,000 students. Bomb threats, reportedly by a pro-war group, twice interrupted it.\n\n“There was a sense of a general mass movement,” Professor Gamson said in an oral history interview in 2015 by the University of Michigan, adding that President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “betrayal” of his promises during the 1964 presidential campaign not to escalate the war “fueled a kind of anger and righteous indignation.”\n\nThe Michigan teach-in inspired others at campuses around the country.\n\nProfessor Gamson was one of a group of professors who provided a supportive atmosphere for Students for a Democratic Society, the antiwar activist group that was formed on the Michigan campus, said Todd Gitlin, a former president of the S.D.S. who has written extensively about the 1960s.\n\n“They had a kind of intellectual heft the undergraduates and graduates didn’t have,” said Professor Gitlin, who teaches at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and who took Professor Gamson’s political sociology class. “And they were on the left but were not associated with left-wing groups, so they had a refreshing independence.”\n\nProfessor Gamson said his activism, including participating in a hunger strike against military research on the Michigan campus, was inspired in part by Horace Mann’s exhortation “Be ashamed to die until you’ve won some victory for humanity.”\n\nWilliam Anthony Gamson was born on Jan. 27, 1934, in Philadelphia to Edward and Blanche (Weintraub) Gamson. His mother was an actress before becoming a homemaker; his father owned a company that manufactured women’s coats and suits.\n\nBill was influenced early on by his father’s interest in progressive causes like utopian communities. He also developed an early passion for games, making one up when he contracted scarlet fever at age 6 or 7 and was homebound for six months, and organizing a baseball team with his stuffed animals. “He had them swing at marbles with a pencil bat and he kept their statistics,” his wife, Zelda Gamson, told ESPN the Magazine. “Maybe he found that games will save you.”\n\nAfter graduating from Antioch College in Ohio in 1955 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and government, he earned a master’s and Ph.D in sociology at the University of Michigan. His thesis was about coalition formation.\n\nSoon after arriving at Michigan, he began creating immersive classroom simulation games, like Simulated Society, in which students dealt with real-world issues of conflict, inequality, injustice and social order and sought solutions as a group.\n\n“If the society is to be a valuable learning experience, we will need your cooperation,” Professor Gamson wrote in his book, “SIMSOC: Simulated Society, Participant’s Manual” (2000, with Larry Peppers). “Cooperation in this context means taking your objectives in the society seriously. We have tried to create a situation in which each of you has goals that depend on other people in the society for their achievement.”\n\nHe left Michigan in 1982 for Boston College, where he and Charlotte Ryan co-founded the Media Research and Action Project. The project helped unions, movements and grass-roots community groups better craft their message to the news media.\n\nProfessor Gamson was a past president of the American Sociological Association and a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1978. He retired from teaching in 2000 but remained with the media project until 2017.\n\nIn addition to his son and wife, who taught sociology at the University of Michigan and the University of Massachusetts, Boston, he is survived by his daughter, Jenny Gamson; five grandchildren; and his sister, Mary Edda Gamson.\n\nProfessor Gamson’s interest in social movements never waned. In 2013, he and Micah Sifry, a writer and family friend, edited an issue of The Sociological Quarterly about the Occupy movement.\n\n“He connected it to a movement that had blown up in Israel around the same time, a youth rebellion against economic frustrations with encampments in major cities,” Mr. Sifry said.\n\n“His work was about how people organized themselves,” he continued, “but what he added to the mix was an awareness of the problems that come when movements don’t have leaders, like Occupy, or a formal structure for making decisions.”\n\nRichard Sandomir is an obituaries writer. He previously wrote about sports media and sports business. He is also the author of several books, including “The Pride of the Yankees: Lou Gehrig, Gary Cooper and the Making of a Classic.” @RichSandomir\n\nLeonard Casper\n\nLeonard Ralph Casper passed away in his sleep on his 95th birthday, July 6. He was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin to Louis Casper and Caroline Eder. He had three brothers and four sisters. Louis; Rose; Ruth; Leo; Larry; Rita; and Roma.\n\nHe married Linda Ty-Casper at San Juan Rizal, Philippines on July 14, 1956. They have two daughters, Gretchen G. Casper, professor of Political Science at Pennsylvania State University; and Kristina Elise Casper-Denman, Professor of Anthropology at American River College, Sacramento.\n\nLen was inducted into the US Military during World War II; and saw active service starting May 26, 1943; serving in foreign service 4 months, 6 days; in Continental Service, 2 years, 4 months, 11 days. His specialty was Cannoneer, # 864. He was qualified as a Marksman Carbine June 13, 1944; was Grade Pfc. Army serial # 36 821 365.Organization: Battery A 389 the FA Battalion; 99th Infantry Division, 38th Field Artillery Regiment as Marksman, Cannoneer 864.\n\nHis battle campaigns included the Rhineland, Central Europe; Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Ruhr Valley. His decorations and citations were the World War II Victory Ribbon, American Theater Ribbon, EAME Theater Ribbon, Good Conduct Ribbon, 2 Bronze Stars. He was received his Honorable Discharge, 2/12/46 at Camp Chafee, Arkansas.\n\nLeonard with three brothers—Louis, Leo and Larry—and a sister, Rita, served in the US Army during World War II. Larry received the Purple Heart.\n\nLen attended grade school at the St, Joseph Church, Fond du Lac High School; and received his BA, MA and PhD from the University of Wisconsin where he was a graduate assistant.\n\nHe taught at Cornell University, University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University, Philippine Normal College, was lecturer at several colleges in the Philippines, in Taiwan and in Thailand on grants from the American Philosophical Society, the Ford Foundation, ACLS-SSRC, Asia Society.\n\nHe was a Creative writing Fellow at Stanford, 1951; directed the Creative Writing Program at the University of Rhode Island, summer of 1958; Writing Fellow at Bread Loaf, 1961; a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation at Bellagio, 1994. He served on the editorial board of several literary magazines such as Literature East and West.\n\nIn 1956 he began teaching Contemporary American Literature and Creative Writing at Boston College; and in 1962 received the “Heights” Man of the Year Award in “recognition of his loyalty and service to the University and to its Young men.” After retirement in 1999, Len continued teaching at Boston College as Emeritus Professor; later teaching at the SOAR Federal Program—Seniors teaching Seniors—in Wellesley, MA.\n\nSeveral of Lens creative writing students became published writers, poets, and editors, including George Higgins, whose first novel was The Friends of Eddie Coyle; Gemino Abad who dedicated his latest anthology, Philippine short Fiction in English from 1990-2008, to Leonard and three other of his professors; Michael J. Brien, editor, Amoskeag.\n\nHe wrote critical essays in his field which included American and Philippine literature. In 1966, his book on Robert Penn Warren, The Dark and Bloody Ground, the first on the author, was published by the University of Washington Press; his last book on Robert Penn Warren, The Blood Marriage of Earth and Sky, was published in 1997 by Louisiana State University Press.\n\nAmong his books are: Six Filipino Poets (1955), Wayward Horizon (1961) The Wounded Diamond (1964), New Writing from the Philippines (1966)Firewalker (1987), In Burning Bush (1991), The Opposing Thumb (1995) Sunsurfers Seen from Afar(1996) The Circular Firing Squad (1999) Green Circuits of the Sun (2002). With Thomas A. Gullason, he co-authored a textbook The World of Short Fiction: International Collection, Harper and Row, (1952).\n\nWhile training for service and during active service in the US Army, his short stories were published in SouthWest Review of the Southern Methodist University, Texas; whose editors encouraged him to continue submitting his stories. In 1971 the Southern Methodist University Press published these short stories in a book, A Lion Unannounced, a National Council of the Arts Selection.\n\nLen was a daily communicant at St. Jeremiah, Framingham until the church closed after 48 years. He was a communicant at St. George in Saxonville; and at the Sons of Mary Health of the Sick Missionaries, Framingham.\n\nSeveryn Bruyn\n\nSeveryn T. Bruyn, a longtime member of the Sociology Department, died on May 26 at the age of 91. Credited with founding the participatory observation approach to sociological research, Dr. Bruyn authored 10 books and inspired the innovative Leadership for Change program at Boston College. A researcher and teacher in the fields of social economy and cultural studies, Dr. Bruyn began teaching at BC in 1966 and retired in 2001. His book A Future for the American Economy won a top prize in the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities 1991 Alpha Sigma Nu Book Award Competition.\n\nMary Griffin\n\nMary D. Griffin, 95, daughter of the late George J. Griffin and Agnes (Daugherty), sister of the late William, and widow of the late John A. Schmitt, died on May 23, 2019.\n\nBorn and raised in Chicago, she earned a bachelor’s degree from Mundelein College and an M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.\n\nFor 25 years she was a Sister of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and later served for many years as Associate Professor and, ultimately, Dean of that university’s Lynch School of Education at Boston College.\n\nDemetrius Iatridis\n\nRetired Boston College School of Social Work faculty member Demetrius Iatridis, who survived a war-scarred youth and became an advocate for cooperation and compassion to aid those in need, died on June 25. He was 93.\n\nDr. Iatridis was widely acknowledged as an esteemed researcher and teacher in social policy and social welfare, and hailed as a pioneer in bringing an international context to social work—particularly for his study of former communist nations’ efforts to build social services systems in a market economy.\n\nAs chair of the Community Organization, Planning and Policy Administration concentration, he founded BC School of Social Work’s “Boston Day” event at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which gave students the opportunity to form ties with city authorities and neighborhood leaders—an important resource for prospective social workers, he believed.\n\n“He’s always been concerned with those people who are disadvantaged, who have fallen behind,” said Barry Bluestone, a former BC faculty member, when Dr. Iatridis retired in the fall of 2012. “In the best Jesuit tradition, Demetrius has kept his focus on helping those whom society tends to neglect, and he’s always reminded his students of the importance of doing that. That’s why so many of us respect him so much.”\n\nDr. Iatridis’ life path, and his personal and professional ideals, were formed in the crucible of World War II. He was only 16 when the Nazis invaded and occupied his native Greece. On his own, he escaped to the island of Crete, but found it no safer there, and was forced to hide in the mountains until he was able to flee by boat to Egypt. Lying about his age, he joined the Greek air force and served as a tail-gunner. During the war, he lost his mother and grandmother.\n\nFor Dr. Iatridis, the war changed everything. Where once he had aspired to go into aeronautical engineering—he had earned a scholarship to Stanford University—now he sought something else.\n\n“I decided that the world would not be built by aircraft engineers but by mutual aid, collaborative programs to prevent other wars,” he explained in an interview with the Boston College Chronicle upon his retirement. “Instead of seeing the powerful always defeating and dominating the powerless, I wanted to help the powerless become powerful. This became my goal.”\n\nAfter the war, Dr. Iatridis aided United Nations’ efforts to help children in his country affected by the conflict, and the U.N. sent him to the U.S. to observe its social welfare system. He went on to earn degrees from Washington and Jefferson College, the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work and the Bryn Mawr School of Social Work, then returned to Greece for a while to help assist in establishing a graduate school of planning.\n\nHe arrived at BC in 1966 as director of its new Institute of Human Sciences, founded by then-University President Michael Walsh, S.J., who envisioned a hub of teaching and research dedicated to social sciences as a potential strength for BC, much like engineering or architectural studies was for MIT. Dr. Iatridis was given a joint appointment in the School of Social Work. After six years, the institute was viewed as having achieved its goals and was disbanded, said Dr. Iatridis, and he became a full-time faculty member in the school.\n\nWhile he acknowledged being “skeptical” about BC at first, and uncertain whether his beliefs aligned with those of Jesuits, Dr. Iatridis told the Chronicle he had found BC a “very good fit. I was able do things I might not have had an opportunity to do otherwise.”\n\nHe taught classes comparing social policy in capitalist and communist societies, led students on visits to Cuba so they could draw their own conclusions, and invited Cuban social services experts to speak at BC. Some critics thought these practices amounted to an endorsement of communism, but Dr. Iatridis insisted otherwise.\n\n“My point was, ‘What can we learn from the way these countries practice social policy? Nobody, as far as we knew, was looking into this. The students would decide for themselves what was effective and what wasn’t, and they would have to account for and justify their positions. There was nothing ideological about it.”\n\nDuring one visit to Cuba, Dr. Iatridis met with Fidel Castro, who asked if social work was an appropriate profession for the country. “I said, ‘It depends. If you want to increase participation of people in decision-making, it’s your best model. It does not work well in dictatorships,’” recounted Dr. Iatridis. “A few years later, he established social work as a profession in Cuba.”\n\nThe dramatic end of communist rule in Europe and Russia at the end of the 20th century created a new area of exploration for Dr. Iatridis. He organized several major conferences to examine the challenges faced by former Soviet Bloc nations in building social service systems in a market economy, and co-published an accompanying series of books.\n\n“This was a tremendous opportunity to put social work in the forefront of a major world development,” he said. “The conferences and the books were very well-received. It was very good exposure for the School of Social Work and BC.”\n\nDr. Iatridis served on several University committees, and chaired the Faculty Compensation Committee for 15 of the 27 years he was a member. In 2000, he was presented with a Distinguished Service Award from the University.\n\nFittingly, Dr. Iatridis’ career was celebrated in November of 2012 with a panel discussion—in which he was a participant—on the issues of policy, planning, and poverty that had informed his teaching and research. Former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis presented a keynote address at the event.\n\nAs he contemplated retirement, Dr. Iatridis vowed to remain active by volunteering for programs and projects combatting poverty—a subject virtually absent from the 2012 election campaign, he said.\n\n“The poverty and inequality I saw after World War II was the reason I went into social work,” he said, “and I am going to continue to help the powerless.”\n\nDr. Iatridis and his wife Mary, who died in 2015, are survived by their children Anna, Tanya, Stavros, and Maki, and 13 grandchildren.\n\n—University Communications\n\nJim Gips\n\nJames Gips, an award-winning Boston College computer scientist whose work in assistive technology has helped people with disabilities live fuller lives, died on June 10. He was 72.\n\nDr. Gips, the John R. and Pamela Egan Professor of Computer Science in the Carroll School of Management, was the co-inventor and co-developer of two groundbreaking assistive technologies, EagleEyes and Camera Mouse, which enable users to operate computers through eye or head movements. The systems have been used by people with cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy, traumatic brain injury and other disorders.\n\n“Before EagleEyes, these children were totally trapped inside their bodies,” Dr. Gips told the Boston College Chronicle in 1996, two years after formally unveiling EagleEyes. “While they may be bright and eager to communicate, they had no way to express themselves. Once EagleEyes is in their homes, there’s no telling where it will lead them.”\n\nIn creating EagleEyes and Camera Mouse, Dr. Gips – along with his collaborators, Peter Olivieri and Joseph Tecce – set the stage for a multitude of inspiring stories of families with children suffering from severe disabilities whose lives were changed by the technology. Testimonials were often delivered through print, broadcast and other media, but many came directly to Dr. Gips and his colleagues.\n\nOne correspondent wrote about EagleEyes’ impact on his five-year-old grandson Adam: “Yesterday I watched him play a computer game that made the monkeys jump on the bed while whimsical music played. Adam giggled then, miracle of miracles, Adam made it play again and then again! What kind of miracle is that you might ask. It’s the most remarkable kind if your grandson has quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Adam cannot speak, sit up, crawl, walk or roll over and is fed with a tube in his tummy.\n\n“But when Adam started using EagleEyes the world changed for him and those who love him. When Adam’s eyes dwell on a graphic icon it ‘clicks’ like a mouse. I call it the click heard around the world.”\n\nOlivieri, a Carroll School associate professor for information systems who retired in 2011, mourned the passing of his longtime friend and colleague. “Jim was a wonderful person, kind and compassionate, bright and articulate, who loved his family, his students and his friends. He always asked his students to think about how they could make a difference, and how their knowledge could make the world a better place.\n\n“He himself practiced what he asked his students to do as evidenced by his development of award-winning technology to help people with profound disabilities show their humanity and become fully recognized as fellow human beings. His research changed the lives of hundreds and hundreds of boys and girls, men and women, and his teaching impacted thousands of Boston College students. I will miss him more than words can say.”\n\nAdded Tecce, an associate professor of psychology, “Jim was a friend and special colleague. He did an outstanding job of putting into the public domain our discovery of a method to help special needs individuals. It was a privilege and an honor to have him as a co-author on my professional presentations. I will always be grateful for his professionalism.”\n\nDr. Gips had already made an impact in the computer science field before joining the BC faculty in 1976, through his foundational work with George Stiny on shape grammars, a specific class of production systems that generate geometric shapes as a means to study two and three-dimensional languages. In 1980, Dr. Gips – who in addition to the Carroll School Information Systems Department held a joint appointment with the Computer Science Department in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences – was one of two BC faculty members (along with historian Samuel Miller) to win the inaugural Alpha Sigma Nu National Book Awards for Algorithmic Aesthetics, which he authored with Stiny.\n\nThe inspiration for EagleEyes came from a casual discussion in 1992 between Dr. Gips and Olivieri, in which they talked about the possibility of controlling computers through the mind. Exploring the idea further, the two reached out to Tecce, who suggested EOG, or electrooculography, which can track eye movements by detecting electrical signals in the eye; electrodes placed around the eyes detect those signals. The three figured out a way of amplifying the signals and converting them to corresponding movements of a cursor.\n\nWorking on that basis, the trio created a prototype that enabled the user to play video games on the computer through eye movement. After Dr. Gips presented their device at a scientific conference, he was asked about its potential uses. He mused that it might help children with disabilities, although he and his collaborators hadn’t yet investigated such a possibility.\n\nDr. Gips, Olivieri and Tecce tested the device, dubbed “EagleEyes,” by using it with students at the BC Campus School, which serves children with multiple disabilities. Over time, they added refinements that enabled users to spell out words, create music and “eye-paint” – make colors appear on the computer screen – among other functions.\n\nIn 1994, EagleEyes was chosen as one of five finalists for a prestigious Discover Award for Technological Innovation, sponsored by Discover magazine.\n\nThe trio sought to duplicate the EagleEyes system to make it available outside of BC, such as for collaborative schools and families. It was increasingly difficult to keep up with the demand, but Dr. Gips couldn’t find investors willing to back the project until the nonprofit Opportunity Foundation of America (OFOA) expressed interest.\n\nIn 2004, OFOA signed a licensing agreement with BC to provide manufacturing, distribution and training for EagleEyes. During the first decade of the license, OFOA placed more than 280 EagleEyes systems in the US, Canada and Ireland.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Gips won a da Vinci Award \"honoring exceptional design and engineering achievements in accessibility and universal design, that empowers people of all abilities.\"\n\nBy then, Dr. Gips and his team had begun producing Camera Mouse, which they made available for download in June of 2007. Some 3.3 million downloads were recorded in its first decade.\n\n“Bless you all for this precious gift to so many who lost their voice,” wrote the father of an ALS patient who used Camera Mouse. “I love you all!!!!\"\n\nOn his personal website, Dr. Gips noted that BC undergraduates were involved in all phases of the work on EagleEyes and Camera Mouse, and had co-authored and presented papers. Many students “begin not by developing technologies but rather by working directly with the children who will use the technologies.”\n\nDr. Gips’ more recent research activity was to examine aspects of the effects of technology and new media on consumer behavior and psychology, in collaboration with Carroll School Associate Professor of Marketing S. Adam Brasel. The two formed the Marketing Interfaces Lab at BC.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Gips received teaching honors from both the Carroll School Honors Program and the BC chapter of Alpha Sigma Nu, the national Jesuit honor society.\n\nPrior to joining Boston College, Dr. Gips worked at the Department of Biomathematics at the University of California-Los Angeles and at the Psychophysiology Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.\n\nDr. Gips earned a bachelor’s degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his master’s and doctoral degrees from Stanford University.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Barbara; children Amy and Jonathan; his sister Kathy; and a grandson.\n\nSean Smith | University Communications | June 2018\n\nRichard Cobb-Stevens\n\nProfessor Emeritus Richard Cobb-Stevens, a widely praised phenomenology scholar who chaired the Philosophy Department for nine years and played a leadership role in the revision of Boston College’s core curriculum during the early 1990s, died on July 6. He was 83.\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens spent nearly four decades on the faculty, but his ties to the University pre-dated his 1971 appointment as an assistant professor of philosophy: He earned his bachelor’s degree in 1958 and his master’s degree a year later from BC as part of his training for the Society of Jesus. Although he would later leave the order, Dr. Cobb-Stevens acquired a solid academic and formational background well-suited to teach philosophy at a university steeped in the Jesuit, Catholic tradition.\n\nAlso foundational were his studies at the College St. Albert du Louvain in Belgium, where he received his licentiate in theology in 1966, and as a doctoral student at the University of Paris, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1971. During his years in Paris, he was witness to the historic 1968 student unrest, met Jean-Paul Sartre, and spent summers as a relief chaplain at a parish drop-in center and a U.S. Air Force base in Germany.\n\nHis work in phenomenological philosophy, analytic philosophy, and the history of philosophy helped inspire generations of philosophers involved in those fields of research. Foremost among his writings were his books James and Husserl: The Foundations of Meaning—a study in contrasts of phenomenology founder Edmund Husserl and pragmatist/functionalist William James—and Husserl and Analytic Philosophy, which traced the break between phenomenology and analytic philosophy, two key philosophic movements of the 20th century.\n\nIn a 1990 interview with the Boston College Biweekly, Dr. Cobb-Stevens said that, while he believed Husserl’s phenomenology method was more successful than the analytic method of Gottlob Frege—who founded the analytic movement—he had published Husserl and Analytic Philosophy with the hope of contributing to “renewed dialogue” between the two schools of thought: “[Husserl and Frege] both shared the conviction that we can achieve some degree of objective truth, even though our access to truth is always perspectival and historically conditioned.”\n\nIn 2015, a volume of essays in honor of Dr. Cobb-Stevens, Phenomenology in a New Key, was published, featuring contributions from several leading experts in phenomenological philosophy from North America and Europe.\n\n“Dick will be most remembered for his essential humanness,” said Professor of Philosophy Patrick Byrne. “He was warm and welcoming to everyone he met, and let you know that he cared about you as an individual. He had a special gift for calming tensions in meetings, which is no small accomplishment in a university setting. Dick had a great sense of humor and was a storyteller of a special kind: He could let himself disappear as he drew people together by drawing them into the story.”\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens’ colleague Professor Eileen Sweeney, speaking at his retirement lecture in 2009, praised Husserl and Analytic Philosophy as an example of his ability to engage with and transcend such divisions. “It is on that cusp that Richard’s philosophical work has dwelt, eschewing both the reductionism and scientism, on the one hand, as well as any premature retreat into mysticism or poetry, on the other. I wouldn’t say that Richard’s thought has come to rest in some easy synthesis or middle ground but is rather engaged in an ongoing dynamic dialectic.”\n\nHis achievements as a researcher and writer did not overshadow his abilities as a teacher and mentor, added Sweeney, noting that for more than 30 years Dr. Cobb-Stevens ran the Philosophy Department’s teaching seminar for doctoral students, and had directed 27 doctoral dissertations. Students, she said, valued his ability to allow them to develop their own thought but to subject it to rigorous testing and critique.\n\nHis lectures had “the same combination of style and clarity as does his writing,” said Sweeney at the 2009 event. “He can always be counted on for the anecdote students will remember for years to come that epitomizes a problem or issue in the material he is teaching. He is always willing to share a story that shows his own difficulties and puzzlement in dealing with a problem or dilemma, one which exposes his own humanity with a humility which students find it possible to emulate. He is willing to work through an issue with students in genuine collaboration, knowing and enacting the role of philosopher as lover rather than possessor of wisdom.”\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens’ colleagues also recalled him as “a citizen of the University” who took on tasks and assignments that contributed to the greater good of his department—as chairman from 1993-2002, he helped bring international recognition to BC’s graduate programs in philosophy while increasing the number of philosophy undergraduate majors to among the largest in the U.S.—and Boston College as a whole: He was a member of the University Policy Committee and the University Academic Planning Council, among other bodies.\n\n“Even though he was an internationally renowned scholar in philosophy,” said Byrne, “Dick devoted most of his time to making Boston College an ever-better place for undergraduate and graduate students to spend their formative years.”\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Cobb-Stevens was appointed as the inaugural director of the University Core Development Committee (UCDC), created to oversee and manage the undergraduate core curriculum, which had recently undergone its most extensive revision since its introduction in 1971. Among the changes were a requirement for students to take at least one course in fine arts, literature, mathematics, and cultural diversity, and that core courses share a set of common characteristics including discussion of perennial questions; history and methodology of the discipline; culturally diverse perspectives, and a concern for the moral significance and practical direction of students’ lives.\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens went on to serve for 18 years as director of the UCDC as it performed the critical minutiae—assessment, evaluation, refinement, and advising—associated with administering the University’s signature undergraduate course sequences. Dr. Cobb-Stevens also was instrumental in helping the UCDC secure major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and National Science Foundation to develop new core courses designed to integrate themes from the humanities and sciences.\n\nA milestone came in 1997, when the first Boston College class to study under the revised core graduated. Interviewed by the Boston College Chronicle, Dr. Cobb-Stevens reflected on the success of the initiative: “Students we’ve talked to say that without the core, they would have followed a narrow path of study without encountering new disciplines and outlooks. Their reaction to, and experience with, the core has been quite positive.” He added that faculty members across disciplines also had been inspired to work on core-related initiatives.\n\n“There is still much that can be done,” he said. “But looking at the particular structure we have here, and the degree of cooperation experienced between the UCDC and departments, I can’t think of anything quite like it at any comparable institution. We have made a very good beginning.”\n\n“My memory of Richard Cobb-Stevens is that he was unfailingly kind and concerned for the welfare of everyone he met, and deeply committed to humanistic education in the Catholic and Jesuit traditions,” said Fitzgibbon Professor of Philosophy Arthur Madigan, S.J., who succeeded Dr. Cobb-Stevens as UCDC director in 2009. “Someone once told me that receiving the answer ‘No’ from Richard Cobb-Stevens was more satisfying than receiving the answer ‘Yes’ from any number of other people.”\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens taught such courses as Machiavelli and Hobbes, Frege and Wittgenstein, American Pragmatism, and 19th- and 20th-Century Philosophy, as well as Modernism and the Arts and New Scientific Visions through the Perspectives Program.\n\nHe served on the editorial boards of Phenomenological Inquiry and the Center for Advanced Research in Phenomenology, among other publications, and was a member of such organizations as the American Philosophical Association, Metaphysical Society of America, Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy, and American Catholic Philosophical Association.\n\nDr. Cobb-Stevens’ wife, Veda Cobb, whom he married in 1979 (both took Cobb-Stevens as their last names), died in 1989. He is survived by his sister Helen Ahearn and brothers Robert, Thomas, and John Stevens; he was predeceased by his sisters Mary A. Cullinane, Grace A. Vinciguerra, and Judith E. Erler and brother Francis Stevens.\n\n—Sean Smith |University Communication—Sean Smith |University Communication\n\nHolmstrom, Lynda (d. 2021)\n\nLynda Lytle Holmstrom, Professor Emerita of Sociology at Boston College, died suddenly on February 6, 2021 at age 81. She was born in Seattle and graduated as Valedictorian from Garfield High School in 1957. She attended Stanford University and earned her BA in Anthropology in 1961. She married her husband Ross, a Doctoral student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford, and then took her first academic job, as an editorial assistant to two Stanford Sociology professors who were writing a book. Her experience working for them piqued her interest in Sociology.\n\nRoss, having finished his Doctoral work at Stanford, obtained a position with NASA in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and they moved to Boston in September 1964. Lynda, on the strength of her record at Stanford, including election to Phi Beta Kappa, immediately received admission to Boston University's Master's Degree program in Sociology. She earned her MA in one year and in 1965 entered Brandeis University's Doctoral program in Sociology.\n\nBy 1969 her Doctoral thesis was largely complete and she accepted a position as Instructor in the Boston College (not Boston University) Sociology Department. She became an Assistant Professor when her Ph.D. was granted. Lynda's thesis became the book, The Two Career Family. This book, based on in-depth interviews of couples in two-career marriages, might be looked upon as a how-to-do-it guide.\n\nLynda went up through the ranks at BC including a stretch as Sociology Department chairperson. Her two favorite courses to teach were Marriage & Family, from her liberated perspective, and Legal and Illegal Violence Against Women. She chose research topics according to what interested her, studies that resulted in The Victim of Rape: Institutional Reactions, written with Ann Wolbert Burgess; and Mixed Blessings: Intensive Care for Newborns, written with Jeanne Harley Guillemin.\n\nLynda was a skier, hiker and traveler. She climbed Mount St. Helens with the Mountaineers, before it blew up. Winters often included a week's ski trip to the Rockies. She toured Europe with her family from the North Cape to the Peloponnese, the British Isles, Morocco and Latin America.\n\nLynda is survived by her husband Ross, also from Seattle, sons Bret and Cary, grandchildren Cheyenne, Jayden, Imogen and Machaias and Washington State cousins Lois Stanford, John Marckworth, and Peg Marckworth. Cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nSarah Cimino\n\nAge 84, of Carnegie, passed away Sunday, December 24, 2017, after a brief battle with cancer.\n\nDaughter of the late Enrico \"Henry\" and Leona (Cardamone) Cimino. She was always generous and kind, always willing to help anyone. She was always recognized for her caring and her leadership qualities.\n\nSarah was a Registered Nurse, dedicated to her profession 100 percent and always looking to improve the system to achieve better patient care. It was natural for her that after graduating Schenley High School she continued her education in the caring services, graduating from Saint Francis Hospital School of Nursing, then UCLA for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, then on to Boston College School of Nursing for 30 years where she also chaired Committees that contributed to nursing progress.\n\nShe will also be remembered as a Peace Corps participant in Malaysia where she taught and implemented new, safer procedures in patient care in a different culture. Sarah considered that experience personally and professionally enriching.\n\nAfter 30 years, she retired from Boston College and spent three years taking care of retired priests of the Boston Diocese in a local nursing home. After that time, Sarah returned home to Pittsburgh, residing close to her family and looked after her mother who lived for 103 years. She was preceded in death by her parents, Leona Cardamone Cimino and Henry Cimino, and her brother, Thomas Cimino. She will be missed by her sister Mary Theresa (Whitey) Burkart, and many nieces, nephews, friends and colleagues.\n\nPublished in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from Dec. 27 to Dec. 28, 2017\n\nJohn Heineman\n\nDr. Heineman, who taught at Boston College for 40 years, chaired the History Department from 1970-76 and pursued research in modern Germany (1803-present) and the Third Reich, as well as the history of warfare, the intellectual history of western Europe and religious and Church history.\n\nBut he was particularly interested in the Nazi era: He taught a course, Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, using a large collection of mostly unpublished primary source documents he had translated. These documents, which he later put online, included material on the Nazi seizure of power and the treatment of Jews during the Third Reich.\n\nInterviewed by The Heights shortly before he retired in 2003, Dr. Heineman said he became fascinated with German history somewhat unexpectedly while an undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame when he took a trip to Europe – a journey made possible by a $500 bequest from his great aunt, who stipulated he use it for travel.\n\nSigning up for a Catholic student tour, Dr. Heineman visited Ireland and England with great anticipation, but came away “faintly disappointed.” Arriving in Germany, however, was “an almost mystical experience” that deepened in the days he spent there.\n\n“I came back absolutely convinced I wanted to be a German historian,” he recalled.\n\nAfter earning his degree from Notre Dame, Dr. Heineman went to Germany on a Fulbright grant and later received a full scholarship to study German history at Cornell University. Searching for a dissertation topic, Dr. Heineman was drawn to the story of Constantin Von Neurath, who had served as foreign secretary during the last years of the Weimar Republic and stayed on after Adolf Hitler came to power. He did extensive research on Neurath and later published a comprehensive biography, Hitler's First Foreign Minister: Constantin Freiherr von Neurath.\n\nTo Dr. Heineman, Neurath was an all-too-common example of “decent and honorable men” who served “the evil that was National Socialism.” The fact that Germany’s pre-World War II foreign policy did not change following the ascension of the Nazis was because Neurath and other professional diplomats who, although not party members, continued to run the Foreign Office, he said.\n\n“Born for another century, relying with too much trust upon an outmoded code of doing one’s duty,” wrote Dr. Heineman, “Neurath never successfully defined the nature of the challenge that faced him.”\n\nDr. Heineman was wary of drawing historical comparisons with current events. Asked by The Heights in 2003 about the parallels between Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler, he replied that using “historical analogies and similes for similar situations while you are teaching history is to create a distortion of the past.”\n\n“The circumstances that brought Hitler to power in the 1920s and ’30s are not the same ones that brought to power Saddam Hussein,” he added. “The chief function of a historian is to recreate history the way it actually was, and that is without the hindsight of the future.”\n\nIn 1997, Dr. Heineman was selected for a teaching award from the Boston College Phi Beta Kappa chapter. In an interview with Boston College Chronicle, he said he relished the honor because it had been given by students in recognition of his teaching – his “greatest love,” he called it.\n\n\"I'm very much aware that my function up there is to inform, partially to entertain, partially to inspire,\" he said, \"but also to give them a model of analysis of how a reasonably intelligent person can look at data and make sense of it.\"\n\n________________________________________\n\nMary Dineen\n\nMary A. Dineen, who served as dean of the Boston College School of Nursing from 1972 until her retirement in 1986, died March 4, 2017 at age 94.\n\n\"I remember Dean Dineen as someone who loved Boston College and who was a formidable leader,\" said Connell School of Nursing Associate Professor Jane Ashley, who was hired by Dr. Dineen. \"I'll always remember that she said to me, \"At BC, we only hire the best and the brightest\"...her comment always stayed with me and in many ways it set the bar for what was expected of nursing faculty.\"\n\nDuring her tenure, the Boston College School of Nursing became recognized nationally for its excellence in preparing students for the nursing profession. Then-University President J. Donald Monan, S.J., praised Dr. Dineen for her \"valuable and necessary leadership\" during this period of time.\n\nShe had the vision to see that nurses were taking on more responsibility in the areas of health promotion and illness prevention, and that the advent of nurse practitioners would forever change the practice and education of nurses.\n\n\"Dean Dineen was one of the early leaders in nursing,\" said Ashley. \"She got her Ph.D. at at time when very few nurses had advanced degrees and she set the stage for the development of the Ph.D. program in nursing at Boston College. Under her guidance, CSON strengthened the master's programs and began work on the PhD program. This happened at a time when very few universities offered a PhD in nursing. In many ways, Dean Dineen was ahead of her time.\"\n\nOn the cusp of her retirement, Dr. Dineen told the Boston College Biweekly (precursor to the Boston College Chronicle): \"I see nursing as a wonderful field for those who want to be in a helping field. I can't imagine anyone not liking it.\"\n\nShe added: \"It has been a satisfying career, and I think I made the right choices. It has been a continual challenge. And I like challenges.\"\n\nDr. Dineen was born in Niagara Falls, NY. She completed her basic nursing education at Mt. St. Mary's Hospital School of Nursing. Following receipt of her RN License, she worked as a staff nurse at St. Mary's Hospital and in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nShe graduated from St. Louis University with a bachelor's degree in nursing and later earned a master's degree from Niagara University and a doctoral degree from Columbia University.\n\nShe was one of the first faculty members appointed to Niagara University when the College of Nursing was founded in 1946. In 1963, Dr. Dineen joined the staff of the National League for Nursing in New York City, working as a consultant and department director with university-based nursing education programs throughout the country.\n\nDr. Dineen was active in many professional organizations, including the American Nurses Association, the National League for Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau and Alpha Sigma Nu. She was honored with the Nursing Education Alumni Award from Teachers College, Columbia and the Mary Adelaide Nutting Award from the National League for Nursing.\n\n________________________________________\n\nPeter Donovan\n\nrofessor Emeritus Peter Donovan ’60, a brilliant, tough-minded teddy bear of a guy whom students affectionately called “The Big Man,” passed away February 25. A Double Eagle, he taught at BC Law for thirty-six years until his retirement in 2002, winning the hearts and shaping the minds of hundreds of still-devoted students.\n\n“Peter was an authentic. Not a phony facet to him,” said one of those students, Peter del Vecchio ’81, who helped organize a tribute to Donovan at the 2016 Reunion. “He presented a gruff exterior, but had nothing but pure love and respect for his students. He was also a lot of fun.”\n\nIndeed, Donovan got a huge kick out of the roasting he received at the event from members of the Class of 1981. After the singing and storytelling, his admirers presented to him and his wife Eleanor a glass portrait of Donovan and a pair of signed bowling pins. “I want to thank his lovely wife Eleanor for sharing Peter with us,” del Vecchio said upon learning of his passing.\n\nA specialist in products liability and antitrust law, Donovan was also a central figure in building BC Law’s oral advocacy programs, serving as faculty advisor for the two-time national champion moot court team and mentoring generations of students in competitions. He was coauthor of Massachusetts Corporation Law.\n\nBC Law Professor Robert Bloom ’71, who was both a student and colleague of Donovan, remembered him as not only a great teacher but also as a lawyer’s lawyer. “His lawyering was absolutely the best; attorneys from all over would come to him for his lawyering,” Bloom said.\n\nIn 1989, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court took up the case of Harlow v. Massachusetts General Hospital, an appeal from what at the time was the largest medical malpractice verdict in the Commonwealth. Trial lawyer Fred Halstrom ’70, one of BC Law’s most distinguished graduates, reached out to his former professor Peter Donovan to handle the very challenging appeal brought by the hospital, focusing in large part on plaintiff’s closing argument, which invoked analogies to professional athlete salaries as a guide to the jury’s assessment of damages. Donovan asked faculty colleague Mark Brodin to assist him, who was flattered and honored by the request. Throughout the long strategy sessions on the appellate brief and argument, Brodin became more and more aware that he was in the presence of one of the great legal minds he had ever encountered.\n\nThe proof of this came when the SJC ruled that, while the argument by plaintiff’s counsel was “egregious and improper under long established, and well understood, principles,” reversal was not called for. Donovan had pulled the proverbial rabbit out of the hat, yet again. Brodin has remained in awe of Donovan’s legal process ever since.\n\nDonovan’s classrooms could be scary places. In his early years on the faculty, he was the only one teaching corporations. The class was so big that students had to sit on the windowsills because there weren’t enough seats.\n\nBloom remembers his corporations class, which he took in the second semester of his third year. “Professor Donovan would call on me every day (you’re not supposed to do that to a third year student,” Bloom said bemusedly). He called me ‘Radical.’ ‘Radical,’ he’d bellow, ‘what does your sense of justice and fair play dictate on this issue?’ and I’d have to answer and have to be prepared. I hated him. And then at my graduation, he told my mom what a wonderful guy I was, and she loved him and if my mom loved him, then, naturally, I had to too.”\n\nDonovan, of course, knew exactly what he was doing. He had this to say about his torts class during an interview with BC Law Magazine in 2001: “I consider myself a teddy bear that people like to hug. I’d obviously hide that part of my personality because in their first year, I want students to work harder than they’ve ever worked before, and if they’re afraid of you, they tend to work harder. So, maybe I do intimidate them, but we also have a lot of humor in class.”\n\nHe cared greatly for his students and was fond of saying that there were only three reasons to teach: “students, students, students.”\n\nAnn Palmieri ’81 said Donovan had a remarkable way of connecting with everyone. “He really did all he could for those that he knew needed his guidance and love and faith,” she noted. “I think of him as a giant Irishman with a giant brain and heart to match.”\n\nDonovan’s contribution to BC Law that was closest to his heart was coaching moot court teams. “Working in the advocacy programs has been my most satisfying work at the Law School,” he said in 2001. “You work with the students one on one, you get to know them as individuals. It’s just a big, huge ego trip to see how hard they work and how well they perform from it.” His teams twice won national championships, were finalists twice, and chalked up an impressive list of regional championships and citations.\n\nHis love of oral advocacy was also personal. It was one of the things that turned around the young Donovan’s otherwise lackluster academic performance. A “C” student throughout high school and half of college, he got an inkling of his verbal powers of persuasion during his comprehensive oral exam in philosophy in which he turned the tables on his inquisitors by questioning the ambiguity of their questions, which earned him their respect.\n\nIn law school he sparred vigorously with Professor Richard S. Sullivan, which provided Donovan with another important insight. “I love to argue,” he realized. Thus challenged, he rose to third in his class his first year. The next two, he was first.\n\nAfter graduating from BC Law, Donovan worked in the antitrust division of the US Department of Justice, and earned an LLM from Georgetown Law Center and another from Harvard Law School, where he’d been a Ford Foundation Fellow in Law Teaching. He began teaching at the Law School in 1966.\n\nEugene Bronstein\n\nEugene Bronstein, who followed an accomplished career in retail with a successful 22-year tenure at the Carroll School of Management, died earlier in the spring semester at the age of 92. Prof. Bronstein had spent 20 years at Filene’s department store in Boston – starting as a research assistant and finishing as a merchandising vice president – when he joined the Carroll School faculty in 1975 as a lecturer. He taught retailing, marketing, merchandising and management courses to undergraduate and MBA students.\n\nIn 1983, he became director of the school’s honors program, where he taught and mentored leading Carroll School students. During his 10 years at the helm, the program introduced a senior thesis, strengthened relationships with the College of Arts and Sciences, created a mentoring program with honors alumni and encouraged greater student management of the program.\n\nInterviewed by the Heights near the end of his term as director, Prof. Bronstein said running the honors program had been a chance for him to “shape a small business,” and had enjoyed the increased contact with students.\n\nProf. Bronstein said the advent of the senior thesis had reflected a desire to give Carroll School students a chance to “spread out” – to broaden their interests and use their creativity. Where in the past CSOM theses had been largely confined to business and management topics, he said that 75 percent now delved into other areas; one student, he noted, had put together an instructional video on golf.\n\n“You have influenced my life and career more than you will ever know,” one student wrote to Prof. Bronstein.\n\nWhile pleased with the program’s growth, Prof. Bronstein told the Heights that he had didn’t expect status quo under new leadership. “I would throw it on the wall and start brainstorming. that is the advantage of a new set of eyes. Take a fresh look.”\n\nAfter retiring in 1997, Prof. Bronstein was a member of the Boston College Association of Retired Faculty. A native of Cambridge, Prof. Bronstein enlisted in the Navy in World War II and served in the South Paci!c, taking part in crucial battles such as Okinawa and Iwo Jima.\n\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from the Harvard Business School.\n\n________________________________________\n\nAlbert F. Hanwell\n\nAlbert F. Hanwell, an alumnus and retired longtime faculty member and associate dean at the Boston College School of Social Work, died on Oct. 3.\n\nDean Hanwell’s association with the Graduate School of Social Work – as it was then known – went back to its pre-Chestnut Hill days, when the school was housed at 126 Newbury Street in Boston. A 1949 BC graduate, he earned his master’s degree in social work at GSSW in 1952, then returned as a faculty member 10 years later, six years before the school moved to its present campus location.\n\nAfter the appointment of June Gary Hopps as GSSW dean in 1976, Dean Hanwell took on more administrative responsibilities until he was appointed assistant dean in 1985, then associate dean in 1992. He, along with Hopps, retired in 2000.\n\nDean Hanwell was credited for working with Hopps to help GSSW become a modern, nationally recognized presence in the social work field. During the Hopps era, the school established a doctoral program – still a rarity at the time among social work schools – and innovative joint degree programs with the Carroll School of Management, Law School and Institute for Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry that promoted the interdisciplinary character of social work. GSSW joined U.S. News & World Report’s top 20 rankings of graduate social work programs, and its faculty ranked 10th in a national study on publication productivity.\n\nIn the spring of 2000, then-Academic Vice President and Dean of Faculties John J. Neuhauser praised the leadership of Hopps and Dean Hanwell: “What they have achieved is remarkable.\"\n\nA World War II veteran who served in the Navy, Dean Hanwell was pre-deceased by his wife Ann. He is survived by his sons Neil – an accounting assistant for the University’s Auxiliary Services division – Kevin and John J. Hanwell, S.J., and his daughter Theresa.\n\nJoseph Criscenti\n\nA funeral Mass was celebrated in St. Bartholomew Church in Needham on Jan. 7, 2013 for Joseph T. Criscenti, a professor of Latin American history for 33 years who died on Jan. 3. He was 92.\n\nA specialist in Argentine history, especially the formation of the Argentine Republic, Dr. Criscenti — who began teaching at BC in 1955, after receiving his doctorate in history from Harvard University — won the 1961 James Alexander Robertson Prize of the Conference on Latin American History for his article “Argentine Constitutional History, 1810-1852: A Re-examination,” published in the Hispanic American Historical Review. During his research trips to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, he acquired books that became part of the Boston College Libraries’ collection of Latin American materials.\n\nDr. Criscenti was a founder of the New England Council of Latin American Studies (NECLAS), and the secretary-treasurer for nearly 20 years. In honor of his efforts, NECLAS established the annual Joseph T. Criscenti Best Article Prize.\n\nDr. Criscenti remained active in his field following his retirement in 1988, editing the 1993 book Sarmiento and His Argentina and serving as a contributing editor of the Handbook of Latin American Studies published by the Library of Congress. He also authored articles for the Encyclopedia of Latin America, among other publications, and wrote numerous book reviews.\n\nBorn in Detroit, Dr. Criscenti graduated from the University of Detroit in 1942. Inducted into the Army, he was assigned to the Adjutant General’s Section in General Douglas MacArthur’s headquarters in Manila. He was awarded the Bronze Star for reconstructing the historical record of changes in the army’s organization in the Philippines. As an Army reservist, Dr. Criscenti became the commander of a military history detachment assigned to the Office of Military History. He retired from the army in 1980 as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nKevin Duffy\n\nA funeral Mass was held Dec. 8, 2012 in St. Ignatius Church, Chestnut Hill, for Kevin P. Duffy, who served for 24 years as Boston College’s vice president of student affairs during one of the University’s most transformative eras. Dr. Duffy died on Dec. 4 of complications resulting from a fall. He was 70. Dr. Duffy’s tenure as student affairs vice president from 1976-2000 coincided with significant changes to Boston College, from its physical plant to the make-up of its student body, as it became more of a national — and international — Catholic university.\n\nThis period also saw an increasing demand throughout higher education for greater attention to college students’ non-academic needs. As vice president, Dr. Duffy helped develop many key services to meet such needs, among them the offices of University Housing, Dean for Student Development and AHANA Student Programs, as well as University Health and Medical Services, the Career Center, Counseling Services, First Year Experience, Learning Resources for Student Athletics, and Learning to Learn.\n\nInterviewed by Boston College Chronicle shortly before stepping down from his vice presidency — he went on to serve as an assistant professor and director of internships in the Lynch School of Education Higher Education Graduate Program until his retirement in 2007 — Dr. Duffy reflected on how the changes at BC had affected his own role: Where his position had once been “more of a ‘dean of men,’” it had evolved “to a far more comprehensive administrative role.\" He added, \"Through it all, though, I think my chief role has stayed constant: to constantly remind people that students are our priority, and to help those students have the best experience possible here.\"\n\nDr. Duffy also was lauded for reviving one of Boston College’s most storied student organizations, the Fulton Debate Society, and upon his departure from Student Affairs the society chose him as the namesake for an award in debate excellence. “Kevin always had a great understanding of, and an enthusiasm for, the role of Student Affairs in the lives of the students and in the University,” said Margaret Dwyer, former University vice president. “He was devoted to the Jesuit ideal of the education of the whole student. In that connection he was very active in the Conference of Jesuit Student Personnel Administrators, where he joined with colleagues across the country in identifying best practices and in seeking to meet new and changing needs of students.” “Kevin lived the Ignatian mission,” said Director of Employee Development Bernard O’Kane ’70, who served under Dr. Duffy as administrative officer in the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. “He believed deeply in student formation. His advocacy for students, especially those marginalized, was unwavering. At times, his positions placed him squarely in between the University administration and the students, but he always saw the issue through. He had unbridled generosity, with his time, resources and spirit. He was a mentor to me and to many younger administrators. “One of his favorite phrases was ‘University citizen,’ which referred to someone he admired at BC who took responsibility for things far beyond his or her role. Kevin was truly a University citizen.”\n\nA New York City native and a graduate of Cathedral College with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, Dr. Duffy came to BC in 1968 as director of student services, and was housing director from 1970-76. He also held a master’s degree in counseling from Fordham University and a doctorate in higher education administration from BC. Dr. Duffy also was a prominent national figure in the field of student affairs. He held such leadership positions as president of the Jesuit Association of Student Personnel Administrators (JASPA) and the Boston Association of College Housing Administrators, Region 1 vice president of the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA), and co-director of six NASPA Region 1 senior student affairs officers’ retreats. He served on eight college accreditation teams or visitation committees, and made more than 60 presentations at regional and national conferences of NASPA, JASPA, the Society for College and University Planning (SCUP) and various other professional associations.\n\nHis professional honors included awards from NASPA as a “Pillar of the Profession” as well as for Outstanding Service and for Support for Graduate Students and New Professionals, the Yanitelli Award from JASPA, the St. Ignatius of Loyola Award for a Career of Service to Jesuit Higher Education, and Martin Luther King Award for Advocacy on Behalf of Students of Color from Boston College.\n\nHenry Blackwell\n\nHenry Blackwell, who taught English at Boston College for 32 years, died after a lengthy illness on Sept. 28, 2012.\n\nThe first African-American faculty member in BC’s English Department, Professor Blackwell specialized in African-American literature, American literature, and cultural studies. His scholarly interests included narrative theory, theoretical aspects of religion and literature, conflicts between culture and aesthetics, and blurred genres.\n\nColleagues recalled Professor Blackwell, a specialist in Flannery O’Connor, as a teacher devoted to his students and whose scholarly papers, delivered at academic conferences around the world, revealed a breadth of intellect and a passion for the subtleties of literature as well as the rigors of ethical debate. Even his introductions for visiting speakers were the brilliantly concise fruits of endless labor, colleagues said, and his letters of recommendations were also perfect little essays of clarity and sense.\n\nProfessor Blackwell's colleagues also praised his outreach to AHANA students, and for encouraging them to attend graduate school and pursue teaching careers. Many did, and kept in touch with Professor Blackwell about their career paths and achievements.\n\nProfessor Blackwell described teaching as a \"constant challenge\" that he addressed with a combination of engagement, care and discipline, setting the highest standards for his students. \"I bully and cajole them into attempting quality work, most of them come around,” he wrote. “I'd like to be remembered for the time and attention I give to them.\"\n\nOne student wrote to him: \"I was always amazed at your courage and integrity in facilitating the process of consciousness-raising while teaching the best and most challenging course I have taken at Boston College. You deserve an award.\"\n\nDuring his recent illness, a student brought him a paper she had written and asked him to correct it. He returned it to her with many minuscule corrections, advising her to \"tighten-up if you want to pass this course.\" She received an “A” on the paper.\n\nBorn in 1936 in Baltimore, Professor Blackwell entered college at age 15 — having skipped several grades — but dropped out after two years. He entered the working world, started a family, and then finished his undergraduate degree by attending night school at Morgan State University. He earned a Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he received his doctoral degree in 1976.\n\nProfessor Blackwell taught English at the University of Connecticut before joining the faculty at BC. He retired from the University in 2010.\n\nRuth Ann Harris\n\nRuth-Ann Harris, a faculty member in the Irish Studies Program for nearly two decades whose research was the basis for the nation’s first online database for tracking “lost” Irish immigrants, died on Sept. 5. at age 76.\n\nA resident of Jamaica Plain, Mass., Dr. Harris served as researcher and editor for an eight-volume set of books, The Search for Missing Friends: Irish Immigrant Advertisements Placed in The Boston Pilot, a compilation of advertisements from 1831-1921 in The Boston Pilot “Missing Friends” column placed by Irish seeking others who were “lost” following emigration.\n\nIn 2005, Boston College launched “Information Wanted: A Database of Advertisements for Irish Immigrants Published in The Boston Pilot,” a website that drew on Dr. Harris’ work. More than 41,000 records are now available as a searchable on-line database via the site.\n\n“The advertisements contain the ordinary but revealing details about the missing person’s life: the county and parish of their birth, when they left Ireland, the believed port of arrival in North America, their occupation, and a range of other personal information,” according to the introduction on the “Information Wanted” site. “The people who placed ads were often anxious family members in Ireland, or the wives, siblings, or parents of men who followed construction jobs on railroads or canals.”\n\n\"These 'Missing Friends' advertisements provide a window on Irish immigration and the difficulties that surrounded it,\" said Dr. Harris in an interview at the time of the website’s launch. \"Ties of community and family could be broken, but the searches represent the tremendous effort that family and friends made to reconstitute in America what they had lost in leaving Ireland. The column was critically important in this process of rebuilding lost ties.\"\n\nSince immigration records from that era were not precise, she explained, data from “Missing Friends” supplied names, birthplaces, destinations and other details that help form a more complete picture of Irish immigration patterns.\n\n\"The information in the ads is still important in today's world; valuable for scholars as well as family historians who wish to learn more about the nineteenth century world of their ancestors,” she said.\n\nDr. Harris had a personal, as well as an academic, interest when it came to the subject of leaving family and home. Born in Liberia of English parents, she was sent to London as a small child at the outbreak of World War II, only to be caught up in the Nazis' bombing campaign of Great Britain. Barely school-aged, she was then relocated to Canada, where she stayed for five years until she was reunited with her parents.\n\n\"I suppose that's a major reason why I've always been interested in people and why they move,\" Dr. Harris said in the interview. \"When you collect immigration stories, having one of your own gives you a certain insight.\"\n\nA researcher in Irish social and economic history as well as immigration, Dr. Harris, who earned her doctorate from Tufts University, was founder and facilitator of the Boston Irish Colloquium, which began in 1993. In 1994-95 she was the senior research scholar at the Institute of Irish Studies at Queen’s University, Belfast.\n\nAmong her academic and professional affiliations, she worked with the Fulbright program as a regular liaison between the Council for International Exchange of Scholars, for the US Information Agency, Irish Scholarship Board, Cultural Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ireland, and as a cultural affairs officer on Fulbright Exchange Programs for the U.S. Embassy.\n\nDr. Harris is survived by her husband, John, her children, Catherine, Dorothy and Rees, and eight grandchildren.\n\nJohn Cawthorne\n\nIn August of 2012, John Cawthorne, an urban education expert whose care and regard for students made him one of the Lynch School of Education’s most popular administrators, died of cancer at the age of 70.\n\nDean Cawthorne officially retired this past spring from Boston College after having served for 13 years as associate dean for students and outreach at the Lynch School. In addition to coordinating the Office of Professional Practicum Experiences, he provided advising services to undergraduate and master’s degree students.\n\n“John Cawthorne was a tremendous advocate for our students both inside and outside of the classroom,” said Lynch School Interim Dean Maureen Kenny. “His passing is a tremendous loss to our community, but the impact of his work and his dedication to the Lynch School will live on through the accomplishments of the many persons whose lives were transformed by his heart and his spirit.\"\n\nRead tributes to Dean Cawthorne from a Spring 2011 BC reception: 'Remembering John Cawthorne'\n\nAs a faculty member and then as associate dean, he earned the love, admiration and respect from numerous students, who valued his level of commitment and willingness to help them find their professional and personal callings.\n\n“He has instilled in us a sense of confidence that we do deserve to be successful and that we do deserve to have such a wonderful person in our lives,” said Robyn Antonucci ’11, at a gathering held for Dean Cawthorne in April 2011 after he had announced his forthcoming retirement.\n\nAt the event, Bryan Ramos ’10, M.Ed.’11 recalled how he had once asked Dean Cawthorne the easiest way to transfer out of the Lynch School. “He simply looked at me with a blank stare, like he normally does, and goes, ‘You won’t want to.’ And five years later, John is my mentor. He’s definitely influenced my passion to want to go into a higher education institution, and be the dean that he is and was for me.”\n\nMatthew McCluskey ’11, M.Ed.’12 noted that Dean Cawthorne not only convinced him to study education instead of law, but had helped him land a one-month teaching placement at a South African high school. “I still go to him with questions, and he doesn’t give me answers. He gives me questions back. And that’s what I try to do with my students. And it’s brilliant. And it’s empowering. It teaches students self-efficacy and allows them to realize they have the answers themselves.”\n\nIn 2002, Dean Cawthorne received the Mary Kaye Waldron Award presented annually to the Boston College administrator or faculty member who has done the most to enhance student life at the University.\n\nAmong his other achievements and activities, Dean Cawthorne helped organize a drive to help the financially troubled Holy Family School of Natchez, Miss., one of the oldest African-American Catholic schools in the country. He and Lynch School students made the 4,000-mile trip to bring supplies and support to the school, and stayed to help do clean-up and construction projects and play with the schoolchildren. The Natchez Immersion Trip has become an annual service opportunity for the Lynch School.\n\nDean Cawthorne, who began his association with the Lynch School in 1989 when he joined the school's Center for the Study of Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy as a research associate, was a widely acknowledged advocate for urban education. He served as a consultant to school systems in Boston, Cambridge and several other Massachusetts communities, as well as in Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Atlanta.\n\nAn active member of the National Urban League, he became NUL vice president for education in 1995, and in concert with his one-year appointment the organization’s educational office was relocated to the Lynch School’s home in Campion Hall.\n\n\"By taking advantage of the natural alliances between parents and teachers, we will help bridge the gap between communities and schools,\" he said in an interview after his appointment, \"and that gap is wide in urban communities. The issue is how do we work with schools and families to create new structures — structures that incorporate and reflect home, community and school experiences and priorities.\"\n\nIn 2003, the Lynch School established the John E. Cawthorne Chair in Teacher Education for Urban Schools, awarded to a senior Lynch School faculty member who, through his or her scholarship and research, works to enhance the education of teachers for urban schools. The chair was endowed by a pledge from the Mahoney family, whose members include Jay Mahoney '69 and his daughter, Erin '02. The professorship is currently held by Marilyn Cochran-Smith.\n\nDean Cawthorne earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1964 and a master's degree in teaching from Antioch-Putney Graduate School of Education in 1969.\n\nAndrew Buni\n\nProfessor Emeritus Andrew Buni, who taught courses in American history at Boston College for 38 years until his retirement in 2006, died on Feb. 12, 2012 at age 80.\n\nDr. Buni’s courses covered a wide range of the American experience and reflected his own life interests and concerns: immigration, African-Americans, sports, and the city of Boston. His class on Boston’s neighborhoods was one of the University’s most popular courses. College of Arts and Sciences Dean David Quigley, who once occupied a neighboring office to Dr. Buni when the history faculty was housed in Hovey House, recalled frequent conversations with his neighbor about basketball, jazz, politics and history. “My favorite memory, though, was sitting with him at a back table for the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship Dinner,” said Quigley. “At the end of the evening, the speaker announced that Andy was being honored for his decades of commitment to AHANA students at Boston College. He was stunned by the news and couldn’t fight back the tears. We had to push him forward to receive the award while the rest of the crowd stood applauding.” Dr. Buni earned a bachelor’s degree in history at the University of New Hampshire in 1958 after serving in the US Army, a master’s from UNH the following year and a doctorate from the University of Virginia in 1965. He joined the BC faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and was promoted to full professor in 1975. “He was on the forefront of all progressive causes at BC,” recalled Associate Professor Cynthia Lyerly, another of Dr. Buni’s History Department colleagues. “Andy fought to bring Black Studies and black faculty to BC. He fought for hiring and tenuring more women. He fought for gay and lesbian faculty and he was probably one of the first faculty members to assign a book about lesbians in a class. He was honorable, quick to anger – but quick to get over it – and tenderhearted. Injustice and bigotry were the things he hated most.” Former History chairman Professor Peter Weiler said Dr. Buni’s interest and concern extended to his colleagues in addition to his many students. “When I was chair, Andy would tell me every year that I should not increment his salary, but that I should give the money to the ‘kids,’ as he called the junior faculty. It was a remarkably generous action.” Dr. Buni is survived by his wife, Joyce Buni of Needham\n\nJacqueline Criscenti\n\nDr. Jacqueline P. (Penez) Criscenti of Needham, May 24, 2015. Beloved wife of the late Dr. Joseph T. Criscenti. Devoted mother of Louise J. Criscenti of Albuquerque, NM. Also survived by her sister, Lily Ethier of Newton, brother-in-law Sam Criscenti of Michigan, and several nieces and nephews. Jacqueline was born in Woonsocket, RI and graduated suma com laude from Regis College in 1945. She received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Minnesota in 1954. While a faculty member at Boston College, she married Joseph T. Criscenti, who passed away in 2013. They were married for 56 years. Jacqueline retired from academia as a professor at Regis College. In retirement, Jacqueline continued to enjoy learning mathematics and computer science, combining tours of the country with visits to her daughter, and living among friendly neighbors in Needham. Funeral from the George F. Doherty & Sons Funeral Home, 1305 Highland Ave. NEEDHAM, Friday at 9 am followed by a Funeral Mass in St. Bartholomew Church, Needham at 10 am. Relatives and friends kindly invited. Visiting hours Thursday from 4-8 pm. Interment in Holyhood Cemetery, Brookline. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy may be made in Jackie's memory to Regis College, Office of Institutional Advancement & Alumni Relations, 235 Wellesley St., Weston, MA 02493\n\nDonald J. Dietrich\n\nTheology Professor Emeritus Donald Dietrich, chairman of the Theology Department from 1991 to 2000, died Nov. 16, 2013. He was 72.\n\nDr. Dietrich was an internationally recognized scholar of the German Catholic experience, Christian-Jewish relations and the Holocaust. He was the author of Human Rights and the Catholic Tradition; God and Humanity in Auschwitz: Jewish-Christian Relations and Sanctioned Murder, and Catholic Citizens in the Third Reich: Psycho-Social Principles and Moral Reasoning. He also was the editor of, or contributor to, numerous publications, including Christian Responses to the Holocaust: Moral and Ethical Issues, Priests for the 21st Century, The Legacy of the Tubingen School: The Relevance of Nineteenth Century Theology for the Twenty-First Century, and Anti-Semitism, Christian Ambivalence and the Holocaust. In addition, he wrote well over 100 book reviews.\n\nHe served on the Committee on Church Relations and the Holocaust at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC. His professional affiliations included membership in the Church History Society, Catholic Historical Association, and Catholic Theological Society of America.\n\nDr. Dietrich joined the Boston College faculty in 1989, after 20 years on the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. Originally from Buffalo, Dr. Dietrich earned a bachelor’s degree from Canisius College. He received a master’s degree and doctorate in modern German history from the University of Minnesota.\n\n“Don was a warm person with a great deal of wisdom,” recalled Theology Professor of Jewish Studies Rabbi Ruth Langer, associate director of the University’s Center for Christian-Jewish Learning. “He hired me and mentored me in my early career. He was an extraordinarily effective chairperson who knew how to get things done.\n\n“He was very much involved in the founding of the Center for Christian-Jewish Learning and very encouraging as the center developed. Even after he was no longer chair, he was very supportive of our work.”\n\nAt Dr. Dietrich’s retirement reception in May, Walsh Professor of Bioethics Rev. John Paris, SJ, reflected on Dr. Dietrich’s tenure as chair noting that he held that role with “poise, equanimity and a seemingly unflappable demeanor” and that he was “devoted to making Boston College an outstanding center for theological scholarship and teaching.”\n\nIn addition to his teaching and mentoring, Dr. Dietrich was a “first rate scholar,” according to Fr. Paris, delivering lectures at Oxford and in London, Madrid, Leuven, Aalborg, Berlin, Graz, Utrecht, Haifa, and Vancouver.\n\nFr. Paris and Dr. Dietrich were friends for more than 20 years, having lunch together every day and sharing summer vacations in Wellfleet. He called Dr. Dietrich a “gracious companion” and their decades as friends and colleagues a “marvelous, memory-filled experience.\n\n“Of all my memories of Don Dietrich at Boston College the most vivid—and most memorable—was presiding over his wedding to Linda. At Boston College, Don found not only scholarly achievement and administrative success, he also found and wed the love of his life,” said Fr. Paris.\n\nRobert Carovillano\n\nRobert Carovillano, an internationally recognized professor of physics who chaired the department for 13 years during his distinguished 44-year career at Boston College, died on Oct. 15. He was 83.\n\nAfter earning master’s and doctoral degrees in theoretical physics from Indiana University, Dr. Carovillano – the son of Italian immigrants and first in his family to attend college – joined the Physics Department in 1959 as an assistant professor, and was promoted to professor in 1966; he served as department chair from 1969-82, and retired from BC in 2003. A prodigious scholar, he published numerous articles and books on the magnetosphere, ionosphere, solar wind, and related topics.\n\nDr. Carovillano pursued numerous professional activities and service in the field beyond BC. He was a member or chair of numerous advisory committees for the National Academy of Sciences, National Center for Atmospheric Research, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF); he also was an officer and trustee of the Universities Space Research Association, where he twice served as chairman of the Council of Institutions, and an officer of the American Geophysical Union.\n\nDr. Carovillano was principal investigator on many research grants and contracts funded by the NSF, NASA, the Office of Naval Research, and the Air Force, and was a visiting senior scientist at NASA Headquarters in the Office of Space Science, where he was responsible for the supervision of several programs and research initiatives in space physics. He served on NASA’s Space Science Advisory Committee and reviewed numerous space shuttle and satellite projects.\n\nA native of Newark, NJ, Dr. Carovillano overcame infantile paralysis from polio and was able to enjoy games of stickball in the streets of Newark, and later became an avid squash and tennis player. He was a resident of Needham while at BC, and later moved to Delray Beach, Fla.\n\nHe was pre-deceased by his wife, Mary Ann, to whom he was married for more than 30 years. His is survived by his daughters Deborah and Rebecca; his son David; sisters Rae and Geraldine; and eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\nRaymond G. Helmick, S.J.\n\nRaymond G. Helmick, S.J. Raymond Helmick was born on September 7 th , 1931, in Arlington, Massachusetts, a western suburb of Boston, and grew up there. His father had come from Midwestern German Lutheran stock; his mother had been born in Boston, the daughter of Irish immigrants. Ray was the second of three children. His sister Marie was the oldest; his brother Bill, six years younger, became a diocesan priest. Ray attended St. Agnes Parish schools through the ninth grade and then transferred to Boston College High School. He graduated in 1949 and entered the Shadowbrook novitiate on his 18 th birthday. It turned out he would enter the Society twice. The first time he developed a stomach ulcer during his primi year and, because there had been a spate of ulcer diagnoses in the novitiate, superiors decided that first-year novices so afflicted would be sent home. Ray was determined to re-apply, however, and he entered Shadowbrook again in February, 1951. This time proved more auspicious and his novitiate and juniorate years passed uneventfully. After philosophy studies at Weston (1954- 1957), he spent regency teaching history and religion at St. George’s College in Kingston, Jamaica (1957-1960). He did theology studies at Sankt Georgen, in Frankfurt, Germany, and was ordained a priest in the Frankfurt cathedral in August 1963. He returned to the U.S. the following year for tertianship at Pomfret, Connecticut. As was the custom with men assigned to the missions, he returned to Jamaica and St. George’s. Here, Ray’s future work with social and political structures and conflict-resolution initiatives began to take shape. In walks through Kingston this blond, precisely spoken, reserved, very white man got to know a number of Rastafarians, a bible-oriented group of urban and rural poor often demonized in Jamaican society. He became something of a sympathetic friend, representing them to government agencies and writing in positive terms about them in the Jamaican press. Expecting to teach at the Kingston seminary, Ray left Jamaica in 1967 to pursue graduate studies in ecumenical theology at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University. In the summer of 1972 he led a group of theology students to Belfast, a city notable then for its sectarian conflicts. The visit proved life-changing, he said. Driving a rental car around the group’s work sites and talking to everybody as he went, he established friendships with people on all sides of the religious and political troubles. Perceiving that the problems were less religious than economic, Ray set about bringing groups together to address one key issue, job development. He agreed to lead an effort to persuade American and British companies to establish manufacturing facilities in neighborhoods accessible to both Protestant and Catholic populations, whose safety would be guaranteed by both government and IRA factions. This occupied much of his time during his last year at Union. When he left Union in 1973 he moved to London, where he set up an ecumenical center focused on conflict resolution (he preferred the Mennonite term “conflict transformation”), a joint ministry of the Irish and British Jesuit provinces. Dialogue and correspondence with key political and religious leaders in the patient search for solutions to apparently intractable problems became the center of his work over the next four decades—in Ireland, Lebanon, Kurdish Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and the Balkans. It was necessarily a hidden apostolate, as it often involved figures whose names would otherwise grab headlines, in many of the world’s hot spots—simply applying the principles of Ignatian discernment, he described it. From 1982 to 1985 he was based at NGOs in Washington. Then he moved to Boston College, where for the next seventeen years he continued his conflict-resolution work while teaching related courses in the theology department and at St. John’s Seminary. He made firm friendships in ecumenical circles in Boston’s theological schools. In 2002-2004 he served as senior associate at the Center for Strategic & amp; International Studies, in Washington. Ray had a lifelong interest in music, architecture, and other art forms. When he graduated from B.C. High he had been offered a piano scholarship at the New England Conservatory but chose the Jesuit novitiate instead. In his years of graduate study at Union he relaxed by building a harpsichord. When he returned to Boston, his artistic interests blossomed again. Some time before, his brother Bill had become pastor of St. Theresa’s, a large parish in the heavily Catholic West Roxbury section of Boston, and was now renovating the church. Ray built a magnificent free-standing tabernacle of gilded and polychromed wood, modeled on 15 th -century examples at Louvain. Then he began work on a mosaic of Christ healing, for a wall next to a handicapped ramp at the church. A large mosaic of St. Theresa was unfinished when he died. Illness brought him to Campion Center in 2012. He continued as many of his activities as health allowed (even teaching on a part-time basis at B.C. until 2015), but the last years of his life were marked by a series of complications and hospitalizations. He seemed to rally from each with his characteristic cheerfulness, patience, and wit intact, but his body was slowly giving out. Just after Easter, his brother Bill had major surgery and the superior at Campion invited him to recuperate there. Meanwhile Ray had been hospitalized again. The two brothers arrived at Campion within a day of each other and occupied nearby rooms. Family members gathered for a lunch celebrating Ray’s upcoming 85 th birthday. Three days later, his conditioned worsened and Ray was anointed. Cardinal Sean O’Malley came to pray at his bedside. He died peacefully in the early morning of April 21 st , 2016.\n\nJohn Fitzgerald\n\nFITZGERALD, Professor John J, age 96, of Millis, Sat March 26, 2016. He was Beloved husband of Margaret (Zack) Fitzgerald, loving father of Christopher Fitzgerald of Millis, Terence Fitzgerald and his wife Jacquelyn of Milton, Paul Fitzgerald and his wife Diane of Groton, and John ‘Jack’ Fitzgerald and his wife Loretta of Millis. Also survived by 5 Grandchildren.\n\nJohn was the son of the late Richard and Catherine (Sheehan) Fitzgerald. He had two sisters; Mary and Margaret, and two brothers; Richard and William. He attended and graduated from Malden Catholic High School and received his Ph.D. from Fordham University.\n\nA Millis resident from 1959, he was an active communicant of St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Millis where he was a lay minister of the Eucharist and a lector for many years.\n\nHe retired after over 50 years of employment as an Associate Professor of English Literature at Boston College. He was a popular Professor and would weave family stories into his lectures over which he labored to keep fresh and interesting. He corrected students’ double-spaced papers armed with a red pen and would re-write their poorly written sentences and correct their grammatical errors so they could improve their writing skills on their next papers. Depending on the student, there could be as much red ink as the original. He corrected the worst papers first, and stayed up late to correct all of them so they could be returned in time to benefit the students’ next assignments. He loved his best writers, delighted in recognizing students’ improvements, and savored the best original metaphors students at any writing skill level might form. Thousands of BC students learned to write properly under his dedicated tutelage.\n\nHe was a scholar. Words were earnestly traced back to their roots in Middle English, Old English, the Romance languages, Latin and Greek. He translated ancient Greek and Latin to English but not just into direct and literal translations but into beautiful English sentences reminiscent of the writings of the founding Fathers. He spent months studying Spanish in Mexico and for a time was the English Department’s official liaison to Spanish-speaking students. He had many friends at Boston College and reveled in contributing to the intellectual banter among the professors.\n\nHe was a traveler. In 1967 for sabbatical he took his family of six to Europe. The trip started aboard the original ocean liner, The Queen Elizabeth. Upon landing in Cork, he had an unexpectedly week-long stop at an Irish Bed & Breakfast while son Terry’s appendix was removed. He was skilled with words, but was not mechanically or athletically gifted and was exasperated driving his big American car on the wrong side of the road in the busy city of London. In fact, driving in any major city was like being in the crater of Mt. Vesuvius –hot magma on the inside with vents of steam issuing forth, which delighted the four boys and that only served to raise the emotional temperature in the car even higher. Nevertheless, he persevered and brought the family to other cities including Paris, Munich, Stuttgart, Vienna, Venice, Florence, Rome and finally to Naples where the ocean liner The SS Rotterdam was waiting. In 1969, he took just his wife for a trip to Spain and Portugal. In 1973 he took his wife and son Paul for a five week trip behind the Iron Curtain. He became an avid camper, towing a pop-up trailer for lengthy family vacations to Florida, cross-country to the West Coast, and trips to Canada. Stays at the National Parks were his favorites, with regular camping trips to the Shakespeare Festival with just his wife a close second. After his official retirement, he and his wife took trips to Greece, Russia, India, and China. And after each day of traveling, no matter how weary he was, he would write in his hardcover journal the events of the day. He recently read his old journals.\n\nRadu Florescu\n\nBoston College History Professor Emeritus Radu Florescu, co-author of the bestseller In Search of Dracula, which revealed the historical identity of the legendary Dracula for the first time, died in France on May 18 at age 88. He had taught at Boston College for 45 years.\n\nDr. Florescu and the late Raymond T. McNally, also a professor in the Boston College History Department, published In Search of Dracula in 1972. Their book, which was researched in Romania under a Fulbright grant, was the first to identify Vlad Tepes, a 15th century prince, as the Dracula of literature. Vlad Tepes was known as Vlad the Impaler for impaling his enemies on stakes. Dr. Florescu also located Vlad Tepes’ castle in the Transylvanian Alps. The book garnered the writing duo international fame, landing Dr. Florescu on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.”\n\nDr. Florescu and the late Raymond T. McNally, also a professor in the Boston College History Department, published In Search of Dracula in 1972. Their book, which was researched in Romania under a Fulbright grant, was the first to identify Vlad Tepes, a 15th century prince, as the Dracula of literature. Vlad Tepes was known as Vlad the Impaler for impaling his enemies on stakes. Dr. Florescu also located Vlad Tepes’ castle in the Transylvanian Alps.\n\nThe book garnered the writing duo international fame, landing Dr. Florescu on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.”\n\nOriginally banned in Romania, In Search of Dracula was only made available in that country after the fall of Communism. The book has since been translated into more than a dozen languages.\n\nDr. Florescu and Dr. McNally authored several other books: Dracula Prince of Many Faces; The Complete Dracula; The Essential Dracula; Dracula: A Biography of Vlad the Impaler, and In Search of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dr. Florescu also wrote In Search of Frankenstein and In Search of the Pied Piper, among other books and scholarly articles.\n\nBorn in Bucharest, Dr. Florescu was the son of a Romanian diplomat. He left Romania at age 13 at the outbreak of World War II. At the heart of Dr. Florescu’s academic study of Dracula was a desire to shine a light on Romania and Eastern Europe. For many years, he directed the East European Research Center at Boston College. He organized symposia and cultural events celebrating Romanian heritage. He also donated hundreds of books on Romanian history to Boston College. He advised the late US Senator Edward Kennedy on Romanian affairs and the US State Department during the reign of communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu. In 1996, Dr. Florescu was appointed Honorary Consul of Romania for New England. In this capacity, he oversaw the presidential and parliamentary voting by Romanians living in the Greater Boston area. In 2004, he was invited by President Bill Clinton to attend the White House ceremony when Romania was granted membership to NATO.\n\nTributes to Dr. Florescu have come from throughout the international community. On behalf of King Michael of Romania, the palace issued the following statement, “Through his work, Professor Florescu built a bridge between Romania and the United States, giving Romanian history a drop of universality.”\n\n\"In the past century, no American has educated more Americans about Romania -- and Dracula -- than Professor Florescu. I was lucky to be one of his grateful students,\" said former US Ambassador to Romania Jim Rosapepe.\n\nDr. Florescu graduated with bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Oxford. He earned a doctorate from Indiana University. He joined the Boston College faculty in 1953 and taught in the History Department until his retirement in 1998.\n\nDr. Florescu’s last public appearance at Boston College was in the fall of 2013 for a book signing for his newest publication, co-authored with Matei Cazacu, Dracula’s Bloodline: A Florescu Family Saga, which tells the story of the links between the Florescus of Romania and Vlad the Impaler.\n\nDr. Florescu is survived by his wife, Nicole, his children Nicholas ‘74, John ‘76, Radu ‘83 and Alexandra Lobkowicz ’85, and 13 grandchildren.\n\nMarjory Gordon\n\nA funeral Mass was celebrated Monday in St. Ignatius Church for Professor Emerita Marjory Gordon, a Connell School of Nursing faculty mem"
