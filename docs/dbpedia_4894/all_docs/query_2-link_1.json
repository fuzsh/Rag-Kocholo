        "text": "THE man described as the \"father and inspiration\" for the north's civil rights movement has died in Dublin.\n\nCo Down-born Dr Conn McCluskey died yesterday morning, aged 99. A general practitioner by profession, Dr McCluskey and his late wife Patricia were key figures in the 1960s campaign to secure civil rights for Northern Ireland's Catholics.\n\nIn their home town of Dungannon in 1963 they helped found the Homeless Citizens' League to campaign against discrimination in housing allocation by the unionist-dominated council.\n\nLittle over a year later the couple were central in the establishment of the Campaign for Social Justice, of which Mrs McCluskey was the first chairperson. The organisation was seen as a forerunner of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (Nicra)."
