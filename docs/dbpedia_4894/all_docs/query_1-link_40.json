        "text": "‘The Long Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland, 1921-39: Labour and Progress in Loyal Ulster’, Seán Byers and Francis Devine, eds, William Walker 1870-1918: Belfast Labour Unionist Centenary Essays (Dublin: Umiskin Press, 2018). The foundation of the Northern Ireland State in 1921 – the political conflict and violence which accompanied the foundation and subsequent maladministration of the State – created substantial democratic issues in the region. These democratic issues, often referred to during the inter-war period as issues of ‘civil liberty’ rather than rights, formed the basis for the development of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland in the 1960s. The Northern Ireland State from inception was a democratised ancien régime, a poetics and aesthetics of loyalty; it is this régime of police order I designate ‘the moral economy of loyalty’.2 Those considered loyal were recognised, granted ‘liberties’ and given the patronage of the State and the local elite. All opposition, by contrast, was designated disloyal. This created a number of outsiders in local society: liberals, independent Unionists, Irish nationalists, Irish republicans and separatists, Gaelic language enthusiasts, Catholics, progressives and the left and Labour, were all considered disloyal. The long history of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland can be traced to the political decisions and administration of the 1920s and 1930s. It was from the cauldron of disloyal politics in the inter-war period that the Civil Rights Movement eventually emerged in Northern Ireland.\n\nNew Labour’s current political agenda in Northern Ireland has re-opened debate about that party’s stance on the ‘Irish question’. While some commentators hold the view that the British Labour Party (BLP) remains ideologically wedded to the nationalist goal of Irish unity it is argued here that Labour’s policy towards Northern Ireland has been characterised historically by an ambivalent non-interventionist approach. This paper focuses on Labour’s implementation of the Ireland Act of 1949, the party’s policy on Northern Ireland during its thirteen years in Parliamentary Opposition (1951-64) and the return of Harold Wilson to Downing Street in 1964. In particular the nature of the ‘fraternal’ relationship between the BLP and the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) is explored. Moreover, issue is taken with the common historiographical orthodoxy which contends that British Labour was always ostensibly anti-partitionist in outlook. Although the party did undergo a degree of greening with the advent of Wilson’s first Labour Government, close reading of the BLP’s own archival records on Northern Ireland would draw a very different conclusion on its intentions, one which shows how the party gravitated towards support for a broad pro-unionist dispensation based on the principle of majority consent within the province.\n\n\"The social and economic changes in Northern Ireland post World War Two transformed minority politics and discourse, and the civil rights movement of the 1960s had a profound effect on the course minority politics would take for the next decade. The formation of the SDLP in August 1970 was seen as a major advance in nationalist politics in Northern Ireland. Until the 1960s Northern nationalism was divided between the constitutional method, evident in the haphazard and unstructured approach of the Nationalist Party, and the unsuccessful militant approach of the IRA. The SDLP claims that it is a party of civil rights. Forty years on, it claims that it is proudly nationalist and is unequivocally in favour of a united Ireland. This description does not sit well with the party’s founding ideals which claimed the party was a ‘radical socialist party’, and while a united Ireland was one of the party’s main aims, it prioritised socio-economic issues over the constitutional question. This article, therefore, sheds new light on the formation of the SDLP, examining the reasons and processes by which the party formed and the often conflicting policies and sense of political identity that the party portrayed in the early 1970s. There is a contrast between the official presentation of the SDLP in those years and what this research has found. The combination of the newly-minted, post-welfare state semantics of the civil rights movement and a discourse that linked social justice with reunification, evident in the SDLP’s early unpublished policy papers and public statements, was viewed as ‘new’ nationalism, quite distinct from the ‘old’ Nationalist Party and its perennial concern with the constitutional question to the detriment of all other policies. Using the party’s unpublished papers from the early 1970s, this article examines how socialist and labour-orientated the SDLP actually was and questions how ‘new’ its nationalism was. \""
