This ensures amaximum “waste” of Nationalist votes and a maximum utilisationof Unionist votes.\n\nIn Conn McCluskey’s book Up Off Their Knees (1989) the late Patsy McCooey gave a description of Patricia in the introduction. “In her wide-brimmed hat and striking costume, she headed a parade of homeless young mothers, their babies and prams, through Dungannon and strode right into the conscience of a people and into the history of our times.”Born in 1914 in Portadown, the daughter of a local draper, Patricia McShane went to Scotland after leaving school to train as a home economics teacher, working with disadvantaged children.When the second World War started, she helped to organise the evacuation of children to rural homes. It was on a holiday back home in Ireland that she met and later married Conn McCluskey.After their marriage, they lived in Keady and then Dungannon where Conn practised as a doctor. After their daughters were raised, she threw herself into politics. Patricia McCluskey: born March 17th 1914, died December 9th 2010\n\n20 JUNE 1968 - THE CALEDON PROTESTAustin Currie, a Nationalist MP at Stormont, and two local men occupied a house in Caledon, Tyrone, on 20 June 1968 in protest over its allocation by the local council to a nineteen-year-old unmarried Protestant, Emily Beatty, who was the secretary of a local unionist politician. A Catholic family with three young children had been evicted recently from the house next door.After a few hours, the RUC removed Currie and his fellow-squatters. Currie said that they had squatted in protest against the allocation of the house to an unmarried woman while more than 250 people were on the waiting list in the Dungannon rural district. He also wanted to draw attention to the system of allocation which allowed an individual councillor to give houses to anyone he wished.\n\nSurveys with statistical significance questioned\n\nWinning while losing: The Apprentice Boys of Derry walk their beat Shaul Cohen Political Geography 26 (2007) 951-967As an outgrowth of the Troubles, Protestants in Derry/Londonderry have moved from the west or Cityside of the River Foyle, where the key historicalevents took place, to the east bankdor Waterside The Apprentice Boys parades are a territorial demonstration and a claim of presence that iscarried out by a community that has lost its control of the contested spaceIn the centuries following the siege, Catholics were barredfrom living within the walls of the city, and after completing a day’s labor were compelled to returnto their homes in the marshy lowlands to the west, called the Bogside.

Lady understand—if she does not yet understand she soon will—that the penalty for treachery is to fall into public contempt?&quot;[6] The UUP leader James Molyneaux spoke of &quot;the stench of hypocrisy, deceit and treachery&quot; and later said of &quot;universal cold fury&quot; at the Agreement such as he had not experienced in forty years of public life.[7] Ian Paisley, a few days later to his congregation, compared Thatcher to &quot;Jezebel who sought to destroy Israel in a day&quot;.[8] He wrote to Thatcher: &quot;Having failed to defeat the IRA you now have capitulated and are prepared to set in motion machinery which will achieve the IRA goal...a united Ireland. We now know that you have prepared Ulster Unionists for sacrifice on the altar of political expediency. They are to be the sacrificial lambs to appease the Dublin wolves&quot;.[9] In his letter to FitzGerald, Paisley said: &quot;You claim in your constitution jurisdiction over our territory, our homes, our persons and our families. You allow your territory to be used as a launching pad for murder gangs and as a sanctuary for them when they return soaked in our people&apos;s blood. You are a fellow traveller with the IRA and hope to ride on the back of their terrorism to your goal of a United Ireland. We reject your claims and will never submit to your authority. We will never bow to Dublin rule“, Gerry Adams, denounced the Agreement: &quot;...the formal recognition of the partition of Ireland...[is] a disaster for the nationalist cause...[it] far outweighs the powerless consultative role given to Dublin&quot;.[17] On the other hand, the IRA and Sinn Féin claimed that the concessions made by Great Britain were the result of the armed struggle, from which the SLDP gained political credit.\n\nChairman of the Northern Ireland peace talks and former U.S. Sen.

To his followers, he is regarded as one of the best leaders the republican movement has ever had. To his fiercest unionist opponents, he is at best little more than an apologist for IRA gunmen, and at worst, a member of its highest command.A former barman, the Sinn Fein president comes from a strongly republican family. In security circles, it is believed he has held senior positions in all branches of the republican movement, including the IRA, but he has never been convicted of membership of that organisation.Interned by the British government in 1971, he was considered important enough within the republican leadership to be released in July 1972, to take part in secret talks in London with then-Northern Ireland Secretary William Whitelaw.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Adams has been the key figure in developing the political strategy of the republican movement along with his close colleague Martin McGuinness.In 1979, he said that the aims of republicans could not be achieved simply by military means. The statement was a prelude to what became known as the twintrack strategy of &quot;the armalite and the ballot box&quot; - pursuing republican goals through both violent and political means.Following the 1981 hunger strike in which 10 republicans died, Sinn Fein&apos;s base was given renewed strength. Mr Adams persuaded the republicans to place increasing emphasis on the political strategy and success of Sinn Fein.Mr Adams was elected party president in 1983 and under his leadership the party took the historic step of abandoning its policy of abstention from the Irish Parliament.He was also elected MP for West Belfast in 1983. He lost the seat to the SDLP in 1992, but later regained it in 1997. He has never taken his place at Westminster. Mr Adams began a series of contacts with the SDLP leader John Hume, which in 1993 became the foundation of the modern peace process. He helped deliver the first IRA ceasefire in 1994.When this collapsed in February 1996, with a bomb attack in London, it raised two key questions. Firstly, if he didn&apos;t know, what was his real influence upon the IRA - could he deliver anything at all? Secondly, many unionist critics pointed out that if he did know that the ceasefire was to be broken, was Adams only committed to the peace process when it tactically suited Republican goals.With the ceasefire restored, Mr Adams eventually led his party into the multi-party talks at Stormont which concluded with the Good Friday Agreement.He has persuaded his supporters to contemplate steps many people had thought impossible, including taking their places in the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, which was set up under the agreement.In the run-up to the deadline for the formation of a new Northern Ireland executive in March 1999, he insisted that the IRA could not yet be persuaded to give up its arms and that the weapons issue should be considered as part of a wholescale &quot;decommissioning of all the guns&quot;, including the British security aparatus.When the process appeared to be floundering in the autumn of 1999, Mr Adams&apos; statement committing Sinn Fein to &quot;all aspects&quot; of the Good Friday Agreement, including decommissioning, was among several key moments following Senator George Mitchell&apos;s final review of the peace process, leading to the establishment of a powersharing executive.But while the peace process has stuttered since then, it appears to have done Gerry Adams no harm. Sinn Fein became the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland after it doubled its number of MPs to four in the 2001 general election - something that analysts have dubbed the &quot;greening of the west&quot;.The question from observers is whether that will become something more, the greening of the north. The question being asked by unionists, is whether Gerry Adams’ strategy remains that of 20 years ago or just purely peaceful means\n\nabsolute commitment: a. To democratic and exclusively peaceful means of resolving political issues; b. To the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations; c. To agree that such disarmament must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission; d. To renounce for themselves, and to oppose any effort by others, to use force, or threaten to use force, to influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations; e. To agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of that outcome with which they may disagree; and, f. To urge that &apos;punishment&apos; killings and beatings stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions.\n\nDrumcree MarchRed line: Route taken by Orangemen on the Sunday before 12 July; from their Carlton Street Hall (D) under the railway bridge (C) along Obins Street (A) to Drumcree Church (F) and back along Garvaghy Road (B).
