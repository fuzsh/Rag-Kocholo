        "text": "LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: Today I'm taking you to Michigan, a key swing state that holds a presidential primary tomorrow. And right now, there is an effort for a protest vote against president and candidate Biden. We start in Dearborn.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Abdullah.\n\nFADEL: The mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, walks us through a shopping district on the west side of the city, where restaurants offer up everything from Detroit-style pizza to shawarma and Yemeni coffee.\n\nABDULLAH HAMMOUD: Yeah, we have - we're the food capital. And I'd like to say now we're also the coffee capital. You know, coffee originated in Yemen. You don't find that anywhere else, that the ones who founded coffee are now the ones serving it up.\n\nFADEL: Nice.\n\nAs the storefronts suggest, Dearborn is home to one of the largest Arab populations in the country. And right now, the city is in deep pain because of Gaza.\n\nHAMMOUD: The people who are dying - these are our family members and our friends, people who we know directly. You know, when I have a resident coming to my council meeting speaking to the fact that he lost 80 family members, that's personal for all of us. Because in this city, everybody is family. That's what I mean by we're in pain. And pain in that sense, but also pain due to betrayal - betrayal by this president, betrayal by the administration, and betrayal by all those that are uplifting the most right-wing government in Israel's history and continually supporting this genocide.\n\nFADEL: It's being debated on the world stage - if Israel's war on Hamas after the October 7 attack in Israel constitutes a genocide. The International Court of Justice found that it's plausible, but hasn't made a final determination on whether Israel has committed genocidal acts in Gaza. It's something the Israeli and the U.S. government say isn't happening, but that's how many residents of Dearborn say they see it. And they want to send a message with their vote in the primary on Tuesday that President Biden could lose Michigan and, therefore maybe the country, when he runs for reelection.\n\nHAMMOUD: You can't look to the landmark legislation that President Biden has been able to enact and think that it's not outweighed by the genocide that he is aiding, abetting, supporting and defending. That, to me, the scales of justice won't allow it.\n\nFADEL: Hammoud is a committed Democrat and was a Biden supporter until the war in Gaza. He's one of more than 40 elected Democrats in the state who plans to vote uncommitted on primary day, and is encouraging other Democrats and independents to do the same.\n\nIs there anything that this president could do that would change your current position?\n\nHAMMOUD: There's always time to do the right thing. But this has to happen outside of the context of, does that mean it moves the needle for where you're going to support in November? Because I refused to believe that Palestinian lives only are important in the context of polls and outcomes of elections. Dignify us - humanize Palestinian lives, Arab lives, and Muslim lives.\n\nFADEL: What do you say to people who say specifically to Arab American voters and American Muslims, the other candidate is much worse for you, and if that person gets elected, it's going to be much tougher for your communities? Why would you even question this candidate?\n\nHAMMOUD: For folks who say that, it's like, what do I tell that resident that lost 80 loved ones? What is worse? I think people fail to explain that. They can't contextualize that for us. What is worse? I don't think there is a worse.\n\nFADEL: Now, this effort to call on voters to choose uncommitted on the ballot come Tuesday is called Listen to Michigan, and it bills itself as a multifaith, multiracial antiwar movement. It's being led by Arab Americans in the state, but isn't only resonating with them. Among its supporters is Andy Levin, a former US congressman, a progressive labor activist and a self-described Biden ally.\n\nANDY LEVIN: Welcome.\n\nFADEL: Hello.\n\nLEVIN: Hi.\n\nFADEL: We meet Levin outside his synagogue in Ferndale, some 16 miles away from Dearborn, where he takes me to see a banner that hangs on the front of the building.\n\nLEVIN: Lots of Muslims who aren't Arab American, and lots of people of color and lots of young people and lots of progressives are freaking out about Gaza. And so this banner is something that our synagogue and this church that, you know, hosts us, we decided to do together. So it says Jews and Christians praying for ceasefire now in Hebrew and in English.\n\nThank you. Hi.\n\nLEVIN: Hi. How are you?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Good. How are you?\n\nLEVIN: Good.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Good to see you.\n\nLEVIN: Nice seeing you too.\n\nFADEL: He takes us inside the cozy space where his synagogue meets, and we sit down to chat.\n\nYou called uncommitted actually good for Biden.\n\nLEVIN: I think it's much better for the president if people from the Arab American community, the Muslim community, the African American community, young voters, all the people who are upset, come out and vote uncommitted. And they say to Joe Biden, I'm really mad at you. I'm voting through my tears. I'm shouting at you. Please stop the carnage. To me, getting a big uncommitted vote sends him a message that otherwise he wouldn't get. And the biggest danger for the president in his re-election is not getting that message. I don't see how you win the presidency without winning Michigan. I don't think he can win Michigan unless he changes course.\n\nFADEL: If he changes course tomorrow, does it change those voters come November?\n\nLEVIN: I don't think we get all of them. But there's a big difference between saying, well, people are mad. But when it comes down to it, in November, the choice between Biden and Trump is so stark they will vote for Biden. There's a big difference between saying that and saying, I'm going to really end this carnage and lead the way to peace. I think many, many people who are upset will say, wow, he's trying, and this is a good thing.\n\nANDREW: Hello, this is Andrew (ph), and I'm with the Michigan Uncommitted movement. And we want a cease-fire in Gaza now.\n\nFADEL: Volunteers with the campaign are phone banking...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING ON DOOR)\n\nFADEL: ...Knocking on doors...\n\nCHRIS: My name is Chris (ph). This is Ali (ph). We're with the uncommitted campaign. We're trying to get folks...\n\nFADEL: ...And this weekend they held Get Out the Vote rallies urging people to go to the polls.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I need you to commit to packing your car. If you are driving to the polls and you have four empty or seven empty seats, if you drive a van, pack your car and take people with you to vote uncommitted.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Yeah.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFADEL: Biden's been balancing his approach to Israel, a U.S. ally, with the growing calls from American Democratic voters for the war to stop. According to polls, the majority are in favor of a cease-fire. Abbas Alawieh, a progressive Democratic strategist and one of the organizers of Listen to Michigan, was in a recent meeting with Biden officials who came to Michigan to hear from Arab Americans.\n\nABBAS ALAWIEH: I looked every one of them in the eye, and I asked, have you advised President Biden to call for a cease-fire? They couldn't give me the answer. So I went to the next person down the line. Have you advised President Biden to call for a cease-fire? The people around the president need to knock some sense into him, shake some sense into him, because this isn't a theoretical thing. This is a child who's out of food and not just one, not just two, but over 13,000 killed using our taxpayer dollars.\n\nFADEL: What's success look like, when you think about Tuesday, for the uncommitted campaign? What is the number you want to get to for that message to be sent?\n\nALAWIEH: Yeah. This antiwar movement is mobilizing and leaning into our power and saying that our relationships with one another are stronger than the other side's funding for war. The vote count will matter on Tuesday, but what matters more to me is generating pressure on Biden. Part of how we build that power will be how strong our hand is as people who are against war. So I think the more votes we have, the stronger our hand will be to play the next move. And so one of the things that we are eyeing is the last time Donald Trump won here was in 2016. He won by about 10,000 votes. And so we want to have at least that many votes. We're going to make our move on February 27, and we're going to continue organizing after February 27.\n\nFADEL: For Alawieh, being a child under bombardment is something he understands. He was 15 during the Israel-Hezbollah war in southern Lebanon in 2006.\n\nALAWIEH: I'm thinking about the moment in the war when our cell phone service was out, when the electricity was out, when we were counting how much food we had and trying to figure out how much longer it would last. I'm thinking about that desperation of being on the phone with my parents and consoling them and telling them it's going to be OK when I was certain that I was going to die. I had accepted that I would be among those who are dead. That is a preventable feeling. President Biden can prevent that for thousands more children right now. He can prevent that. This is urgent. So many of us are operating not just from a place of political expediency. We're operating from a place of life and death. And we're telling you, this is what you need to do to save lives. It's not theoretical for us. If you count us in your big tent Democratic Party, then you have to listen to us when we're telling you that this is not theoretical for us. This is life or death.\n\nFADEL: A statement from the Biden campaign said the president is both working hard to earn every vote in Michigan and tirelessly to create a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. The U.S. is trying to broker a hostage exchange deal that would get a six-week pause in the fighting, but many people in Dearborn and the larger Detroit metro area say they're looking at actions of the administration, including the continued military aid to Israel and the fact that the U.S. has vetoed U.N. resolutions calling for a cease-fire three times.\n\nANEM KHAN: Killing innocent people is not the answer to anything ever. Unless he calls for a cease-fire, I don't think that anyone would vote for him.\n\nHUMA SHAHZAD: The only thing Biden would have going for him is he dangles loan forgiveness in our faces and thinks that that will persuade our decision into voting for him. But I don't think that's enough.\n\nBRIAN MCCLUSKEY: I am going to not vote at the top of the ticket.\n\nFADEL: And why are you leaving...\n\nMCCLUSKEY: Palestine.\n\nFADEL: Oh.\n\nMCCLUSKEY: Period. That's it.\n\nFADEL: That's Anem Kahn, Huma Shahzad, and Brian McCluskey (ph). They all spoke to us in Dearborn. All three vote Democrat. All three say they are voting uncommitted for the Democratic presidential candidate come Tuesday. And the mayor of this city, Abdullah Hammoud, is now at the center of the most pressing geopolitical battle of this moment.\n\nHAMMOUD: I ran on the prospect of making sure your garbage is picked up on time. I never imagined myself in a room with senior officials leading conversations on foreign policy, but when that foreign policy directly impacts your constituents, I think it's irresponsible if you walk away.\n\nFADEL: In Michigan, there are an estimated 200,000 registered Muslim voters and some 300,000 people who claim Middle Eastern and North African ancestry.\n\nHAMMOUD: We're not sizable enough to make a candidate win, but we're sizable enough to make a candidate lose.\n\nFADEL: Tuesday's primary will be a litmus test that may tell Biden if he has a Michigan problem.\n\nCopyright © 2024 NPR.
