        "text": "‘With an unsparing ability to distinguish myth from reality, Mary Daly reveals why Ireland, despite some impressive growth in the 1960s, remained one of the poorest countries in Europe. Deeply relevant to the economic, political, and religious questions confronting Ireland today, this book will provoke a lively response.’\n\nKevin Kenny - Boston College, Massachusetts\n\n‘Based on an awe-inspiring array of evidence, this is a tour de force that transforms the way we think of Ireland's ‘modernisation’. Mary Daly's brilliant analysis will be essential reading for anyone interested in understanding how a fast-growing, dynamic and open society could emerge from the chrysalis of De Valera's Ireland.’\n\nEugenio F. Biagini - University of Cambridge\n\n‘This is a history of ‘the long 1960s’ - from the beginning of Whitaker’s work on Economic Development and de Valera’s departure from active politics to the explosion of the Northern troubles and Ireland’s accession to the EEC. Rising living standards, external events and the encroachment of ‘the modern’ inevitably forced change. This book is an invaluable documentation of how traditional values, core institutions and vested interests continued to shape these changes.’\n\nFrank Barry - Trinity College Dublin\n\n‘This is a book about transition that provides a compelling narrative about the evolution of Ireland though the long 1960s. The volume brings patterns of continuity, not just change, sharply into focus. Mary Daly is to be commended for its breath - the Irish economy, politics, media, urban-rural relations, family dynamics, and emigration are all treated in a penetrating and subtle manner. As Ireland prepares for the centenary of its ‘founding act’, the 1916 rebellion, this volume makes a major contribution to our understanding of the Ireland that we have.’\n\nBrigid Laffan - European University Institute, Florence\n\n'Sixties Ireland is great history. It questions, challenges and reinterprets … Anyone who is interested in why [Ireland] is as it is needs to read this book.'\n\nDan O'Brien Source: Irish Independent (independent.ie)\n\n'Sixties Ireland is a fine book and significantly advances our knowledge and understanding of this period in Irish history.'\n\nEoin O’Broin Source: Sunday Business Post\n\n'A valuable study based on the author’s own extensive archival research and synthesis of many recent books and articles by other historians … Highly recommended. Upper-division undergraduates and above.'\n\nA. H. Plunkett Source: Choice\n\n'Working through the key themes of economic development, emigration, women’s lives and feminism, and finally on to political change and the upheavals caused by violence in Northern Ireland, [Daly] provides a detailed exploration of the decade which goes beyond any previous book in both its scope and detail. … This book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to make sense of the pivotal, transformational decade. Moreover, it also shines a light on just how much more there is to understand with regard to this period, and as such should provide a fruitful starting point for future research.'\n\nErika Hanna Source: Twentieth Century British History"
