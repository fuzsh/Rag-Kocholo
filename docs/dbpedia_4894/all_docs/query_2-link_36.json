        "text": "This is truly shocking news, and the judgement is shameful. Is this some kind of joke for such a serious crime? The Supreme Court of India and the government need to take this matter seriously. Judges are appointed to deliver justice, not to exploit their prestigious positions for personal gain. He should be immediately terminated, and strict action should be taken against him. Additionally, his previous judgements are now questionable given this type of ruling. This situation demonstrates that if you have power or wealth, you can do anything, even commit murder, because the government, police, and courts are in your pocket. Everyone involved should be punished. Shame on this entire system. The government, police, and courts need to regain their focus as they are losing public trust. Is this what \"RAM RAJYA\" is supposed to be?\n\nThank you Satish Acharya for sharing this. Of all the notes I have come across on LinkedIn, this one seems the most relevant in the broder context - the key differentiator that should have been called out the loudest! In any profession, when an individual errs, there are checks and balances ranging from termination, transfer, suspension, to the revocation of licenses while the judiciary enjoys a free pass with the data sufficiency centric 'lack of evidence' card. While such judgments aren't new to the Indian system, with Netflix's show 'Maamla Legal Hai' capturing a page of such events in a lighter dramatic rendition, the severity of such events has been quite minimal. As a dutiful, law-abiding taxpayer, we have been conditioned to have 'faith' in the judicial system, as there is no other way. As a fellow Punekar, I am angry as everyone else. With the media furore, political outcry amidst the elections; the system has set things in motion, cracking down on all parties involved - shutting down liquor lounges breaching audits (without any thoughts to the livelihood of the workers - an extreme measure that has got no bearing to the current case), the on-the-spot cops not following reporting protocols and the actual perpetrators. However, for the \"judgement\" in question that can't even be justified by the words like outrageous, preposterous, dubious - I sincerely wish that someone higher up the food chain would take note of the sentence and revoke, reprimand, and rectify things at the earliest. The People are waiting.. RIP Anish, Ashwini üôè\n\nThis video made me feel old :-/ I am going to take a stab in the dark and guess she's around my age. Can you believe it was 17 years ago? Safe to say, Emily isn't using Myspace anymore. I wonder what social media will look like another 17 years from now. I hope we see a shift in a far more positive direction. This seems to already be happening with interesting startups popping up, capturing users who are looking for less curation and more genuine human connection. Offline a start up in the social space I came across last week is pushing in this direction. Their about us section is filled with üî• (Link in the comments below) \"Offline was founded, and is 100% owned, by someone who worked on social platforms for as long as they have existed. He walked away from hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, by refusing to compromise his integrity or support the evil conglomerates that are currently obsessed with controlling the minds of society. He stood up to his 'friends' and colleagues, exiled himself from an increasingly unethical and ugly technology industry, and built the product you‚Äôre looking at today. Our history doesn‚Äôt mean you should trust us (the road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say), but you‚Äôll eventually learn that this isn‚Äôt some get-rich-quick-by-getting-bought-out scheme; it really, truly is an attempt to build a platform where people can interact in a more mature and beautiful manner.\" My prediction is that these kinda ideas will be the next big disruptors of social media as we know it today.\n\nI am pretty critical of social media. However, I am learning and growing from my interactions with millennials and the Gen Z generation. You are never to old to learn. In this case there are those, that emerge out of a struggle for democracy that are head and shoulders over others in social media, and mass media for that matter. MiedasTouch is where I go to watch and hear factual information. Originally lawyers focusing on the legal issues in politics, this new network has emerged to nearly three million followers because they provide evidenced-based data in their broadcasts something you rarely found in mass media networks or across social media. Here is a sample of non-media experts growing in popularity and improving in communication skills over time. https://lnkd.in/g_n6DEhb"
