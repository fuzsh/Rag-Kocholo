        "text": "Throughout history, protest has been an essential part of the fight for justice.\n\nWe’re joining nearly 250 organisations to condemn the new Policing, Crime and Sentencing Bill being rushed through Parliament by the UK government.\n\nThe bill not only threatens our right to protest, but contains new laws that would increase racist stop and search powers and criminalise Gypsy and Traveller ways of life.\n\nThis bill is about increased police and state power and not protection of people. 350 rejects the proposals in this bill that infringe on our human rights and our ability to organise for climate justice.\n\nFull text of open letter:\n\nDear Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Justice,\n\nWe write to share our profound concern and alarm over the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill published last week. Not only does this Bill contain numerous threats to the right to peaceful protest and access to the countryside, criminalise Gypsy and Traveller communities’ way of life, as well as a whole host of expansive policing powers, but it is being rushed through parliament during a pandemic and before civil society and the public have been able to fully understand its profound implications.\n\nContained within this 307-page bill are plans to:\n\nIntroduce draconian new police powers to decide where, when and how citizens are allowed to protest and have their voices heard by those in power;\n\nIncrease penalties for those breaching police conditions on protests and the ease with which they can be found to have done so;\n\nCreate a new trespass offence that criminalises the way of life of nomadic Gypsy and Traveller communities, while the government manifestly fails to provide adequate sites and permitted stopping places, and has implications for the public’s right to protest, access to the countryside and people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThis is a huge bill, both in length and in potential consequences – for young people calling for social change facing greater criminalisation by the state, for Gypsy and Traveller communities facing threats to their way of life, and for anyone who values freedom of expression and the right to make yourself heard against the powerful.\n\nThis in itself is enough to cause alarm, but the government is also trying to rush this Bill through parliament, with less than a week between publication and second reading. This is deeply inadequate and provides no time for MPs and their staff, let alone the communities it stands to affect so profoundly, to understand what the consequences of this wide-ranging Bill may be.\n\nFor a country that so often prides itself on civil liberties, this Bill represents an attack on some of the most fundamental rights of citizens, in particular those from marginalised communities, and is being driven through at a time and in a way where those who will be subject to its provisions are least able to respond.\n\nWe urge the government to fundamentally rethink its approach.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGracie Bradley, Interim Director, Liberty\n\nHugh Knowles & Miriam Turner, Co-Executive Directors, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nSarah
