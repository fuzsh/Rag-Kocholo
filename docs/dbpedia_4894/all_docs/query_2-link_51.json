        "text": "Over 190 open panel proposals have been accepted for 4S New Orleans. Full descriptions of the panel topics are provided below.\n\nThe purpose of calling for Open Panel proposals is to stimulate the formation of new networks around topics of interest to the 4S community. For 4S 2019, open panels have been proposed by scholars working in nearly every continent and relating to just about every major STS theme. Open panel paper submissions should be in the form of abstracts of up to 250 words. They should include the paper’s main arguments, methods, and contributions to STS.\n\nWhen submitting papers to open panels on the abstract submission platform, you will select the Open Panel you are submitting to. Papers submitted to an open panel will be reviewed by the open panel organizer(s) and will be given first consideration for that session.\n\nAlso at the time of submission, you will also be asked to nominate two alternative open panel preferences for your paper. In the event that your paper is not included in the open panel of your first preference it will be considered for the alternative panels indicated in your submission.\n\nBACK TO CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS\n\nSUBMIT HERE\n\n1. 4S At Play: Video Game Studies In STS\n\nAlexander Mirowski , Indiana University\n\nThis panel aims to bring together scholars whose work examines critical issues surrounding video games. Such games are not simply games; they let us play, but they are also work, sport, business, sites of cultural production, and lenses for introspection. The field of video game studies is increasingly being recognized for its theoretical rigor and diversity of method, as well as the contributions it has made to academic discussions on topics such as technological development, identity formation, labor, and digital sociality. But, there is more work to be done. This panel thus invites papers representing the rich body of scholarship on video games as well as the diverse webs of actors arrayed around them to encourage discussion about this vibrant medium.\n\nSTS provides fertile ground for these discussions about video games and the complex networks in which they are embedded; with critical inquiry, STS shows us how we might uncover and recover diverse actors and practices in the video game ecosystem. 4S 2019 is a prime place to engage in such discussions with its tripartite theme of Innovations, Interruptions, Regenerations; after all, video games exist at the confluence of all three. How might we productively study video games using STS theory and methods while exploring this theme? Novel approaches to the study of video games are also welcome, as they represent critical steps towards the innovation and regeneration of video game studies and STS in turn.\n\n2. A New/Old Technology for Governance? Questioning Big Data Surveillance\n\nCaelyn Randall, University of Wisconsin- Madison\n\nXerxes Minocher, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nDriven by deterministic assumptions that the mere presence of information leads to positive social transformation (Srinivasan, Finn, & Ames, 2017), the era of big data has arrived (boyd & Crawford, 2012), bringing with it a series of critical questions that ask what big data surveillance looks like. As the titles of popular books and articles on the topic of big data surveillance such as Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy (O’Neil, 2016), The Dystopia We Signed Up For (Manning, 2017), and How Big Data is Automating Inequality (Eubanks, 2018) all underscore, the way in which big data is being imagined is as a new, nearly cataclysmic threat to public well-being. Such questions, however, may elide the ways in which big data surveillance is embedded within existing socio-political networks of power. As a technology of governance, big data surveillance constrains and enables the mobility of data/bodies asymmetrically. For example, surveillance, especially as an apparatus of state governance, has long been used for the social control of communities of color (Brown, 2015). Although big data surveillance may represent new, 21st century relations between private companies, universities, and the U.S. intelligence community (e.g. Amoore & Piotukh, 2015; O’Neil, 2016), it is still guided by a pre-existing and longstanding ideology of monitoring and controlling (Benjamin 2016). We invite papers that critically engage with big data surveillance practices, either by questioning the epistemological systems underpinning these practices or examining how these practices enable, constrain or distribute economic, political, and social mobilities.\n\n3. Advocating for Science in Contemporary States of Authoritarianism\n\nSTS IstanbuLab, Research Platform\n\nAuthoritarian regimes and political practices have been on the rise in many countries of the world in the last decade. The relationship of this new wave of authoritarianism and science has been particularly tense, with the emergence of post-truth politics, rejection of scientific knowledge and authority where it is not compatible with the projects of the regime, and oppression of scientists and academics who are in opposition to the politics of the authoritarian states. There has also been resistance and discussions of how to engage with these political shifts, among scientists, activists, activist scientists, and the general public who are concerned about the situation. In this environment, we believe that it is vital to discuss how to advocate for science while also critically examine it, as STS scholars.\n\nThus, for this panel, we, as STS IstanbuLab, invite papers discussing different aspects of the relationship between authoritarianism and science(s): What forms of scientific practice get supported under authoritarian regimes? How do we discuss the relationships between authoritarianism and science through past and present examples? What methodological innovations would STS bring in understanding and challenging authoritarian governance of science? How do we approach the complex and multiple relationships between political power and technoscientific practices taking shape in contemporary states of authoritarianism?\n\nFollowing the discussions of last year’s 4S conference, we especially encourage a transnational participation, since we also believe this is an issue where focusing on similarities and differences beyond national borders, and non-Western STS scholarship and experiences, are particularly meaningful.\n\n4. African Knowledge Regeneration and Transformation: Innovation-based Endogenous and Ancestral Knowledge.\n\nAimé Sègla, Université d’Abomey-Calavi\n\nThe building of Africa South of the Sahara has always been through transformation, interruption and regeneration of knowledge and techniques, both tacit, implicit, unexpressed, body codified, or in language and cognition. As so, this kind of knowledge remains invisible, under-recognized and undervalued. Yet, it is clear and scientifically proven that this locally-grounded and useful knowledge as a particular universal knowledge is one of the most reliable bases for long term, sustainable prosperity nowadays Africa. The panel (can be open / or closed) seeks papers that contribute to provide a forum for networking on appropriate non conventional Technology solutions for the 21st century through the recognition, valorization and re-appropriation of locally-grounded knowledge and practices: Papers may:\n\nPromote Innovation raised from knowledge-based endogenous development since ancient times\n\nPromote diffusion of related innovations to support Appropriate Technology practice in Sub-Sahara African context\n\nIdentify, initiate and combine Appropriate Non conventional Technology contributions based on both pre-modern and modern knowledge in a manner that is rooted in an appropriate historical perspective.\n\n5. Algorithms at Work: The Practice of Prediction\n\nSarah Sachs, Columbia University\n\nThe field of science and technology studies is producing a growing literature in response to the increasing prevalence of machine algorithms in everyday life. Research stretches across anthropology, sociology, information science, media studies, organizations, communications, history, and cognitive science—examining, for example, the causes and consequences of bias in algorithmic decision-making or the embeddedness of algorithms in different historical, organizational, and market contexts. These studies serve as a foundation for expanding the social study of algorithms to accommodate for a more nuanced perspective on the interplay between contexts and the different forms and functions these technologies take and serve. Having exposed the black box of the Algorithm and its inscrutability, scholars are now turning their attention to algorithms as varied systems, enacted through a multitude of practices including, but not limited to, the production of models and their codification. This panel seeks to bring into conversation scholars from multiple disciplines who are interested in algorithms in practice (Christin 2017) and welcomes submissions exploring such themes as:\n\nHow are work practices informed, or affected, by algorithms, machine learning, and AI?\n\nHow might our increasing reliance on machine algorithms be shaping, and shaped by, organizational structure?\n\nHow is algorithmic decision-making related to changes in the labor market and the structure of knowledge work and contingent labor?\n\nDoes examining algorithms in practice have implications for how we might approach algorithmic accountability and regulation?\n\nWhat translation and classification practices are involved in building models, processing data, and interpreting and communicating results?\n\n6. Alternative Pedagogies at the Crux of Interdisciplinarity: Promises and Pitfalls of Innovating Education\n\nEllen Foster\n\nJames Malazita, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n\nYana Boeva, Nuremberg Tech – Technische Hochschule Nuernberg\n\nScience and technology not only describe the focus of research for STS scholars but very often constitute our physical presence within academic institutions. Historians and philosophers of technology teach ethics classes in engineering departments, while anthropologists and sociologists reside in faculties of science – the range of employment possibilities and STS’ impact within STEM fields appear as unbound. Despite STS’ presence in these fields, our pedagogies vary significantly from STEM’s teaching models by following the disciplinary methods, principles, and traditions of social sciences and humanities. However, due to their growing popularity, technological countercultures such as making and hacking have found acceptance within these diverse academic areas, particularly at the crux of interdisciplinarity in which STS exists (Chachra, 2015; Rosner, 2018; Sayers, 2018).\n\nYet novel and alternative attempts such as digital humanities, critical making, and material practice remain on the margins of traditional pedagogies of STS-related and STEM disciplines. Simultaneously, more recent educational reforms follow a neoliberal course of merging social sciences and humanities into STEM thus promising to increase the critical thinking capacities of students. In other instances, such endeavors result in the foundation of innovation hubs proposing the improvement of STEM education through a systematization and quantification of critical theory and social methods under the vague label of soft skills.\n\nIn the light of making and doing and an interest in STS with the promise of hands-on practices, this open panel welcomes paper proposals engaging the multiplicity of issues related to the unfolding of alternative pedagogies.\n\n7. Antimicrobials in Livestock: Practices, Technologies, Markets and Regulations\n\nHenry Buller, University of Exeter\n\nNicolas Fortané, INRA – IRISSO, Université Paris-Dauphine\n\nIntroduced into agriculture in the late 1940s, antimicrobials have become an integral component of many different aspects of contemporary life, whether that be agricultural production and food supply or human, animal and environmental health. The global problem of antimicrobial resistance, which is increasingly defining antimicrobial use today, is not new. The last few decades have seen a series of attempts to frame and to regulate antimicrobial use and the drug market in veterinary medicine and animal care across different countries with significant varied economic, scientific and political contexts. Hence while their use as animal growth promoters has been banned in Europe since 2006, antimicrobials are still widely employed for this purpose in the rest of the world.\n\nThis panel seeks to look specifically at antimicrobial uses in animal husbandry (from the prescription and use of antimicrobials on farms to the production, marketing and sale of antimicrobial medicine) and the different forms of regulation (professional, institutional or market-oriented) that are applied to antimicrobial use. The panel aims to bring new understanding to the social, technical and economic structures of agri-food production and distribution systems that integrate, and have integrated, antimicrobials as key elements in the processes of livestock farming or, on occasion, have sought to encourage their reduction.\n\nThe panel will take an STS approach to raise questions about innovation and transition, resilience and resistance, science and regulation, practice and prescription, that offer new perspectives on the hitherto dominant trajectories of livestock farming. We invite contributions on a range of topics including (but not exclusively):\n\nKnowledge, practices and technologies of animal disease management\n\nNew forms of commercialisation (for example, ‘antibiotic free’ products)\n\nForms of work and professional models of animal health actors (farmers, veterinarians, livestock technicians)\n\nScientific and technical controversies on antimicrobial resistance\n\nEconomic and commercial strategies of agri-food actors (pharmaceutical companies, agricultural cooperatives, food and retail industries)\n\nAntibiotic policy and regulation of the veterinary drug market\n\nAntimicrobial stewardship and responsibilisation\n\nFrom regulating use to managing resistance\n\n9. Assembling Caring Geographies: How do Regions Care?\n\nDara Ivanova, Erasmus University Rotterdam\n\nRoland Bal, Erasmus university rotterdam\n\nIris Wallenburg, Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management\n\nCities are increasingly postulated as the scene of the bright future: they are smart, fancy and dynamic. Assembling people, technologies and (green) buildings together, they inhabit the synergy to create a new world (Sennett 2018). The countryside, on the other hand, is shrinking: young people leave for the city, while ‘needy’ elderly stay behind in emptying regions, as municipalities hastily seek to maintain regions livable. Is the countryside declining? The famous Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas portrays the countryside as the future of the world; ‘empty’ regions being used for large-scale innovative technologies and inhabited by ‘new’ citizens (i.e. refugees, foreign workers) that transform the countryside into geographies of innovation and care.\n\nHow to understand these spatial-temporal orders of the countryside and the caring it involves, both for the region and its citizens? What does a caring geography entail? Human geographers and STS scholars alike have put forward the notions of assemblage and ‘carescape’ (Ivanova et al. 2016) to envision how ‘care’ – in its broad meaning of caring for health, society, community, environment and its buildings and animals – and ‘geography’ intertwine, inquiring how public and private services are organized within regions and how this relates to its social, political, economic and physical dynamics (Milligan and Wiles 2010).\n\nIn this panel, we seek to explore and conceptualize the countryside as an assemblage, with a particular emphasis to its caring geography. How do carescapes in the countryside change, given demographic and economic developments? How to conceptualize these emerging regional assemblages and their consequences?\n\n10. Attention!\n\nRebecca Jablonsky, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n\nNick Seaver, Tufts University\n\nTero Karppi, University of Toronto\n\nIn recent years, attention has become a topic of increasing public concern. Digital distractions, addictive design patterns, and ad-driven platforms are said to be decreasing individual attention spans; political crises are described as canny distractions or failures of collective attention. Meanwhile, academic critics call for new forms of attention as solutions to analytic and political problems. This panel will draw together work that attends to attention, using the analytic tools of STS to foreground attention itself as an object bound up with the social production of knowledge, scientific and technical infrastructures, and broader discourses of economic value and cultural values. What work does the concept of attention perform in popular and expert conversations? How might closer attention to attention interrupt common sense discourses about its value and purpose? What work can attention perform, when it is attended to with greater precision and care?\n\nThis panel invites contributions that are topically, theoretically, and methodologically related to the intersections of attention and STS—including but not limited to research that addresses the following:\n\nPatterns of attention designed into sociotechnical systems such as algorithms, social networks, and media platforms\n\nThe social production of knowledge about attention through cognitive science, neuroscience, etc.\n\nThe transformation and deployment of attention within and through experimental modes of sensing, knowing, being, and relating\n\nThe relationship between technology, attention, subjectivity, and personhood\n\nSocial and political movements that aim to reclaim or reconfigure attention\n\nNew methods and metaphors for paying attention and understanding attention economies\n\n11. Automation, Skill and Identity in an Age of AI\n\nBidisha Chaudhuri, International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore\n\nSoumyo Das, International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore\n\nBarely thirty years ago information technology (IT) was considered to be the final answer to the labour question (Zuboff 1988). We are again at a historical juncture, where AI-based automation seems to bring back a similar promise (Levy & Murnane 2004). Whether this new machine age will lead to displacement of human labour or will create new economic opportunities is a matter of a different debate. However, with increasing delegation of human activities to intelligent agents, what we definitely witness is a shift in human skill trajectory (Bright 1958). Michael Polanyi in his book, The Tacit Dimension (1966), argued that much of human knowledge and capability stems from skills and rulesets that lies underneath our conscious understanding. Moreover, human abilities such as empathy, sympathy, trust are often transmitted to us via culture, tradition and are beyond the general directive of ‘skill’. Drawing on earlier work on automation and skill (Spenner 1983; Adler 1987; Vallas 1990), we explore these grey zones in human skills/activities, which, while undergoing the current phase of AI-based automation, go beyond a linear trajectory of deskilling and reskilling (Acemoglu & Restrepo 2018). It manifests rather as a more complex intertwining between human activities, technology, and organization structure. The objective of the panel is to bring together an analysis of these nuanced process through which human skills are evolving and will evolve, given increasing reliance on AI-based automation and how this will impact human identity, which in the modern capitalist system, relies on our occupation.\n\n12. Autonomous Vehicles and Digitalization of the Transport Sector: Contestation and Co-production of Emerging Technologies\n\nMarianne Ryghaug, Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)\n\nTomas Moe Skjølsvold\n\nRoger Søraa\n\nThis session explores imaginaries, politics, users and consequences of the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles and the digitalization of transportation infrastructure. It problematizes these technologies across temporal, scalar, systemic and disciplinary boundaries. The goal is to stimulate a rich debate on the co-production of autonomous vehicles and society, and to shed light on how the complexity, hybridity, and diversity of these emerging technologies could be understood, interpreted and governed.\n\nAccording to popular narratives, self-driving vehicles promise wide-ranging socio-technical transformations with potential implications for mobility, safety, environment, infrastructure, urban development and planning. STS scholars have highlighted the ambivalent and contested characteristics of autonomous vehicles and digital infrastructures. While techno-epistemic actors who push the self-driving agenda produce rich imaginaries highlighting massive potential gains within traffic safety, goods transport, energy efficiency and climate mitigation, others question the politics of self-driving vehicles by asking how they feed into wider algorithmic cultures of governance and deep digitalization.\n\nThis also raises important questions of cyber security and surveillance and the exploitation of big data by actors such as nation states, corporations, political parties and interest groups. Further on, what are the implications for labor markets, governance and planning? Are current technological scripts socially just? From the perspective of technology users, this raises questions of the changing roles and practices of drivers, ownership of transport data, app-economies, new services, mobility cultures and democracy. Driverless vehicles might also enable engagement with moral dilemmas such as variations of the trolley problem.\n\n13. Bad Queers, Bold Crips, and Black Femmes: Building Up an STS for Deviants\n\nStephen Molldrem, The University of Michigan\n\nKate O’Connor, University Of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n\nJallicia Jolly, The University of Michigan\n\nIn conversation with ongoing queer, disability studies, feminist, and antiracist projects in STS, this open panel seeks to further disrupt interrogations of sexuality, race, gender, and (dis)ability in the study of science, technology, and medicine by centering deviant objects of analysis and subject-positions: Bad Queers, Bold Crips, and Black Femmes. By the fact of their existence – but also through their intentional deviant practices – Queers, Crips, and Black Femmes disrupt idealized white, able-bodied, masculine, heteronormative, and feminine subject-positions as these are depicted in both popular and medical material. Rather than an STS that merely accounts for this deviance, we seek to build up an STS that actively celebrates these deviant subjects and their practices of self-making, community-building, and collective resistance to normative regimes of science, technology, and biomedicine. We welcome submission from all disciplines, historical time periods, and encourage methodological promiscuity.\n\nSTS has a long history of disrupting understandings of bodies, modes of knowledge, and entire disciplines. Operating in that tradition, this panel seeks to put those disruptions into conversation with deviant forms of inquiry and theorizing in queer studies, disability studies, sexuality studies, and Black feminist studies. How do Queers disrupt the technological and biomedical constructions around sex, sexuality, pain, pleasure, disease, and desire? What happens when Crips embrace biomedical technologies that seek to erase disabled subjects and instead use them to create an imagined Crip future? How do STS scholars and biomedical actors respond when working class Black women who are framed as ill or sick – such as women living with HIV – respond with bold assertions of their health?\n\nInspired by the deviant milieus of New Orleans, Bourbon Street, and with 4S 2019 convening in the shadow of Southern Decadence 2019, we welcome scholars from a wide variety of fields that seek to (re)define, appropriate, and revel in deviance through one or more critical STS lenses. We welcome traditional paper submissions and contributions in other formats or modalities.\n\n14. Becoming Data-Driven: Burgeoning Data Cultures and Liminality in Civil Service\n\nLeah Horgan, University of California, Irvine\n\nMargaret Jack\n\nCindy Lin, University of Michigan, School of Information\n\nPremised on the promises of being data-driven, nation-states across the globe are building web-based, data-driven systems to manage populations, resources, and risk. Scholarship in postcolonial STS and critical data studies critiques the widespread use of data-driven systems, pointing to the racialized, gendered, and socioeconomic consequences embedded in their production and use, and the troubled histories from which such apparatuses arise (Borocas and Selbst 2016; Browne 2017; Crawford and boyd 2012; Noble 2017; Suchman 2007). This research has productively demonstrated that data technologies are not neutral, but instead are socially, culturally, and politically situated ways of knowing and seeing (Browne 2017; Gitelman 2014; Jasanoff 2017; Thakor 2017). While scholars have studied the recent and often algorithmic proliferation of these data-driven practices (Eubanks 2018; Brayne 2017; Lyon 2014), less attention has been paid to the complex interplay between data-driven domination and the changing norms of everyday administration—the day-to-day work of forging of what Oscar Gandy calls ‘‘actionable intelligence’’ (2012: 125). And, how these systems work outside of the West is largely unattended to. Using these conditions as a starting point, we illuminate the range of practices and perceptions of being data-driven, from policy makers in capital cities to mid-management urban police to rural officials. How do government workers develop a sense of data literacy in divergent contexts across regions? How do they derive value in data and data-driven techniques? Through empirical analysis, this panel digs beneath macro trends and rhetoric to query the lived experiences of working through these burgeoning data systems.\n\n15. Becoming Otherwise: STS Inroads into Techniques of the Better Self\n\nElse Vogel, Linköping University\n\nCatelijne Coopmans, Linköping University\n\nSteve Woolgar, Linköping University\n\nSara Bea, Linköping University\n\nThis panel explores the influential landscape of practices of personal change and radical self-transformation. Practices and techniques for self-improvement are part of encounters and ways of operating in healthcare, education, professional development, life coaching, therapy, spiritual practice, movements like the quantified self, etc. Various instantiations share a staged ‘will to goodness’ and an emphasis on the possibility of change, foregrounding an inward turn to learn how to become a happier, healthier, wiser and sometimes also a wealthier version of oneself.\n\nMuch existing literature in the social sciences attempts to grapple with the ubiquity of ’the psy-complex’ by analysing the phenomenon as (yet) another manifestation of neoliberal regimes. We wish to move away from such an analytical cul-de-sac and craft stories that do not hinge on unilateral critique or explanatory frameworks. Drawing on STS’ capacity to re-frame the issues under study as well as to reinvent itself, we propose to ignite an STS-inflected examination of ‘techniques of the better self’ that poses novel questions, mobilises inventive empirical methods, and opens up interstitial spaces between critique and justification. What is involved in lived instances or trajectories of ‘becoming otherwise’? What do these allow us to learn about, for example, limits, sameness/difference, choice, care, divisions, subjectivities? In order to address these questions, the panel encourages a wide range of contributions that attend to the teaching/learning, using, incorporating or evaluating techniques of the better self.\n\n16. Beyond Non-Use: Infrastructuralism and Interruption\n\nNathanael Bassett, University of Illinois at Chicago\n\nThis panel calls for scholarship on non-use and media refusal to examine how ubiquitous technology becomes infastrucutral, and the increasing difficulty of avoiding adoption. While existing works on non-use examine Sally Wyatt’s refuser, resister, and the expelled as well as the excluded, looking at technologies and media as infrastructural leads us to consider non-use as a precarious near-impossibility. Yet interruptions in patterns of use and changes in user behaviors emerge, as we negotiate our relationships with media and technology in context-specific studies. How do we consider what it is to be a non-user when innovation is rapidly the conditions of possibility for living in a technified society? This panel hopes to address that question.\n\nScholarship on non-use is welcome to examine the issues surrounding innovation, interruptions, (dis)engagement and (dis)empowerment. When we are compelled to participate in media and technology via innovation, how do we measure the exchange of agency, as ways of being in society become technified, commercialized and standardized on new platforms? What is the interuption to older ways of being and historic social infastructure? What is the relationship between (dis)engagements and (dis)empowerment? Case studies, theoretical works, and new perspectives are especially welcome as we try and continue the necessary conversation around non-use.\n\n17. Beyond the Prosthetic Imaginary: New Intersections between STS and Disability Studies\n\nStephanie Lloyd, Université Laval\n\nZoë Wool, Rice University\n\nTechnology in disability studies is often seen as the trojan horse of ableism. In STS, for all the considerations of the posthuman, critical conceptualizations of disability remain rare. The research, then, emerging from these fields has largely run in parallel, with few or fleeting intersections. If the conceptual and political points of reference in these fields are characterized largely by disjunctions, the same cannot be said for their subjects of interest. From studies of biomedical technologies such as pharmaceutical and bionic devices to studies of the senses and ways of being in the world, the subjects and objects of concern in critical disability studies and STS overlap significantly. This panel will bring together a set of researchers working at the emerging intersection of these fields to converse within and across the existing tensions. Through a consideration of these tensions will speak directly to the conference theme of innovate, interrupt, regenerate, critically considering the ambivalent, complex positions of biomedical technologies as interventions. Moving beyond the limits of concepts such as therapeutic normalisation and technological enhancement, we will dwell on the way technologies are productive of, and mediate, difference. We will consider how the everyday use of biomedical technologies can sometimes work against normative logics of cure that govern their production allowing people instead to reshape, rather than remove, difference and disability.\n\n18. Black Feminist Health Science Studies: Exploring New Possibilities\n\nMichelle Munyikwa, University of Pennsylvania\n\nWhat might a uniquely Black feminist approach to the study of health, science, and technology offer to the field of STS as a whole? Both in contrast to and in conversation with feminist science studies, we propose a critical engagement, Black Feminist Health Science Studies, which is invested in a social-justice based science, one which makes clear the co-constitutive nature of medical science and popular perception, underscoring the need to engage them simultaneously (Bailey 2016, 22). As an emergent lens and field, BFHSS is built on existing and growing research that demands a multi-pronged approach to ameliorating the health disparities of Black people. In this vein, our work collectively draws upon the work of a multitude of black sociologists, feminists and critical race scholars including Dorothy Roberts, Alondra Nelson, Cathy Cohen, Ruha Benjamin, and Evelynn Hammonds among others, as we work to grow an interdisciplinary community which is dedicated to creating better understandings of health for Black communities and to examining the media’s role in framing and disseminating this knowledge.\n\nThis panel will bring together scholars invested in the project of imagining a future for STS which takes seriously the contributions of Black feminist engagements with science, technology, health, and medicine. We invite ethnographic work, textual engagements, artistic performance, and any synthesis of these and other modalities to ask what might be possible. What kinds of interruptions, interruptions, and regenerations might a black feminist framework afford the study and experience of health across time and space?\n\n19. Citizen Bureaucraft\n\nMonamie Haines, Nanyang Technological University\n\nKatherine Hendy, Independent Scholar\n\nScience studies scholars have long tracked the variety of political and epistemic projects either conducted by or enrolling lay people to enact science. Whether it is scientists crowdsourcing data or activists questioning corporate or state research agendas, experimental methods, or the ends of research, citizen science encompasses the participatory production of scientific knowledge within and without institutionalized boundaries. As such, tracking the openings and foreclosures of citizen science has brought attention to the instrumental rationality and cultural authority of science underpinning both policy justification and public accountability, particularly in liberal democratic contexts.\n\nIn this panel, we seek to expand this conversation by examining the political possibilities of technoscientific engagement that is enabled through bureaucratic interventions rather than the lingua franca of science in multiple political contexts across the world. How might we examine social movements that must demonstrate bureaucratic literacy in order to challenge the boundaries and ends of technological and biomedical projects? For example, Indian anti-nuclear activists, labeled as ‘anti-science’ by the state and denied cultural routes to claiming expertise, have mobilized procedural and legal forms of argumentations to press moral claims. Even in the United States, activists must develop bureaucratic literacy to negotiate the procedural hurdles of ethics committees and regulatory agencies to challenge therapeutic applications for marijuana and psychedelics. We invite papers which explore how these less-examined and braided practices of bureaucraft (Joshi and McCluskey 2018) might expand our understandings of the mutual constitutions of bureaucracy and science as well as the political possibilities of bureaucracy itself.\n\n21. Citizen Science, Law, and Policy\n\nAya Kimura, University of Hawaii\n\nAbby Kinchy, Polytechnic Institute\n\nThis session explores the inter-connections between citizen science, laws, policies, standards, and regulations. In many countries, citizen science has gained public policy support in recent years, often touted for expanding scientific literacy, producing useful scientific data, and spurring innovation. At the same time, a growing number of scholars are highlighting how citizen science can contribute to progressive social change, bringing attention to social movement activists, union organizers, and scientists who are using citizen science to argue for better protection of the environment and human health. Papers in this session will probe questions such as: How is citizen science and public policy co-produced? How are neoliberal policies implicated in the advancement of citizen science? What are the implications when citizen scientists choose to align (or not) their data and methods with existing regulatory standards? How is the field of citizen science governed? How do citizen science practices encourage or inhibit politicized actions by volunteers? In alignment with the conference theme of innovation, this session also explores how citizen science helps innovation in regulatory science, advocacy strategies, legal arguments, and government policies.\n\n22. Classic STS Papers, Re-incorporated, Reimagined, Re-enacted\n\nSergio Sismondo, Queen’s University\n\nNicole Nelson, University of Wisconsin Madison\n\nFor this panel, we invite presenters to return to classic STS papers, and to reflect on the value of doing so for advancing scholarship and building community in STS. Classics might be papers recognized as such. Or, they might be papers that are not part of standard narratives of the field but should be incorporated or re-incorporated into these narratives—recognizing that while narratives can celebrate the collective and cumulative nature of scholarship, they can also marginalize or exclude.\n\nIn remembering earlier moments in STS, we ask presenters to explore how those moments can be usefully or interestingly recalled today. We hope that presenters will not only engage with their chosen paper, but will also devote some of their time to freshly delivering parts of it. Such re-enactments might commemorate the contributions of particular scholars, or be performances intended to trouble existing categories or narratives in STS. By engaging with past scholarship through re-enactment rather than citation alone, we aim to foreground the performative aspects of citational practices, making clear how the meaning of a classic paper shifts as it is read aloud by a different speaker, in a different venue, in a different historical moment. In so doing, we aim to create space for thinking about how earlier moments in STS might be productively re-staged as we collectively shape narratives of the field’s trajectories.\n\n23. Co-creating or Testing Scalable Societies? Test Beds and Living labs as Emerging Innovation Policy Instruments\n\nGianluigi Viscusi, EPFL, Switzerland\n\nJack Stilgoe , University College London\n\nBrice Laurent, Centre de sociologie de l’innovation, Mines ParisTech\n\nSebastian Pfotenhauer, Technical University Munich\n\nSophie Nyborg, Technical University of Denmark – DTU\n\nTest beds and living labs (TB/LL) have emerged as a prominent approach to foster innovation across geographical regions and technical domains, including in energy, transportation, smart cities, and robotics. Feeding on prominent policy discourses around grand societal challenges and directed transformation, TB/LL represent a co-creative, experimental approach to innovation policy that aims at once to test, demonstrate, and advance new sociotechnical arrangements in a model environment under real-world conditions. To that end, TB/LL tentatively stabilize new socio-technical orders at the meso-scale in an as-if mode of technology implementation, frequently with the promise that local orders could be scaled up or transferred to future society at large.\n\nIn this panel, we interrogate TB/LL as an emergent innovation policy instruments. We invite papers that address the following questions, among others:\n\nHow are futures materialized and negotiated in TB/LL?\n\nHow, what and who do TB/LL test? What forms of control and participation do they enact?\n\nHow do TB/LL create (standardized) model realities? How are these model realities deemed or made scalable from the lab to society at large? What ‘afterlife do they have?\n\nHow do TB/LL reconfigure (or reinforce) power structures, inequalities and subjectivities?\n\nHow do TB/LL differ across sites, cultures, scales, and technological domains? How do models and their outcomes travel?\n\nWhat interventions of economic actors and public bodies do TB/LL support?\n\nHow can test beds enable new opportunities for responsible innovation governance?\n\n24. Commoning Knowledge: Regeneration Through S&T\n\nMaywa Montenegro, University of California, Davis\n\nAlastair Iles, UC Berkeley\n\nAkos Kokai, University of California at Berkeley\n\nThe privatization of public knowledge has become endemic to 21st century times. From corporate battles over drug patents to seed wars, knowledge produced in many forms, sites, spaces, and communities is increasingly enclosed – that is, separated from its knowledge-makers and commodified for the accumulation of capital. Science and technology are at once driving and experiencing the effects of many contemporary enclosures. To counter such trends in enclosures, in the past 15 years, knowledge commons have materialized in some S&T fields (Frischmann, Madison, and Strandburg, 2014), as well as in citizen-led movements such as Wikipedia, Creative Commons, open access science databases, and crowd-sourced science and nature platforms. Yet S&T knowledge is also becoming important to building an array of material infrastructure and institutions, in both the industrial- and developing world contexts (e.g. energy commons and fishery commons). Many of these cases revive traditional customs and norms, braiding centuries-old knowledges into something ‘new.’\n\nWe welcome papers that explore the multiple dimensions of both knowledge commons and how knowledge is being used to create or support all varieties of commons. Some potential topics include: What are the potential contributions of commons to helping regenerate and democratize the everyday practice of science and technology? How does knowledge-making enable and sustain the formation of commons, and whose knowledge matters? What sorts of knowledge are produced within commons, and how might these play a role in the identity and governance of commons? How might new technologies update and reinvigorate commons practices? How might it disrupt them? What does it mean to be ‘innovative’ in the context of a commons? Can we move from treating knowledge as a resource to ‘thinking like commoners’?\n\n25. Conceptualization and Evidence of Social Innovation\n\nJosé Francisco Romero-Muñoz, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla\n\nRollin Kent, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla\n\nIn recent decades, several international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Economic Forum and the European Commission have stated that nations’ progress must be understood in a broader set of ideas, including not just technological innovation but also social innovation. The importance of social innovation has increased because it represents an alternative to the conventional top-down assistance approach of some governments to face the social, economic, political and environmental challenges of the 21st century. Unlike such an approach, social innovation implies the active participation of society in the solution of its own problems. That is to say, we understand social innovation as the intentional change of social practices aimed at the solution of collective problems, through the active participation of a community. In other words, social innovation means social change, especially that intentional change of social practices. Despite its known relevance and conceptualization, several authors point out that social innovation still lacks a coherent theoretical structure and that more empirical research is necessary to understand and promote it. In response to this concern, through this panel we invite STS scholars to join a conceptual discussion on social innovation, helping to define its actors, conditions, potentials and possibilities. Likewise, an additional purpose of the panel is to present results of empirical investigations that show evidence of social innovation processes of particular cases. If the progress of nations requires not only technological innovation, but also social innovation, those who study innovation within the field of STS are the ones indicated to provide a better conceptualization on innovation, involving both concepts in processes that affect the welfare and sustainability of our societies.\n\n26. Controlling Environments to Grow Plants – Controlling Plants to Grow Environments\n\nMascha Gugganig, Technical University Munich\n\nAlex Rewegan, MIT\n\nControlled environments for plant growth—for food production or pharmaceutical development, among others—increasingly materialize in such forms as ‘controlled environment agriculture,’ ‘indoor controlled farming,’ or (urban) ‘vertical farming.’ In that regard, across North America there is an intense proliferation of technoscientific development relating to closed environmental systems for growing a quickly legalizing cannabis. Meanwhile, given the urgency of climate change, many other practitioners argue that closed systems present an inevitable path for future food production. These new technologies, which also includes the minute sensory monitoring and maintenance of humidity, air, temperature, water, light, and nutrients, have led to more ‘efficient’ plant growth, and to new technoscientific ways of knowing and living with plants. Indeed, such growing environments often question the central role of ‘natural’ resources like the sun, while hydroponic, aquaponic, and aeroponic systems have shifted the role of soil which, in conventional settings, is seen as central to healthy plant growth. Plant scientists and engineers thus work in novel interdisciplinary ways, leading not only to innovative forms of plant growth, but to the ‘growth’ of new ecological ontologies, and an expanding knowledge of the botanical sensorium. This panel invites papers that explore the complex human-plant-technology-economy relations that are emerging across a variety of settings. We seek contributions that critically interrogate how plant science and innovation in growth systems work together, and how they in turn co-constitute new plant epistemologies, moral economies, forms of care, and broader human-plant relations, among other possible topics.\n\n27. Corporate Influence on Science and Regulation\n\nHenri Boullier, French National Institute of Health and Medical Research\n\nBoris Hauray, National Institute for Health and Medical Research\n\nThe influence of corporate interests – most notably from the cigarette, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries – on science and on health and environmental regulation has attracted a growing media and public attention. STS research has explored this issue in different ways, for example through the analysis of the impact of industry-funding on scientific publications, the study of corporate-biases in the production regulatory standards, or more broadly by questioning the commercialization of science. Lately, considerations on the politics, and power relationships, at play in the production of scientific knowledge have been renewed by the emergence of a new political sociology of science. This panel wants to bring together researchers taking on board the question of corporate influence on science and public regulation, and proposes to do so by following three lines of research: (1) first, by opening up a discussion on the notions and theoretical frameworks used to analyze industry or business influence (including, but not limited to: regulatory capture, conflict of interest, bias, production of ignorance, hegemony); (2) second, by studying the social mechanisms it involves (for instance, funding strategies, revolving-door dynamics, ghostwriting, lobbying, or threats and retaliations); (3) third, by analyzing production of policies aiming at controlling corporate influence, and the social mobilizations it triggers. More generally, the panel aims at helping the development of inter-sectoral and international comparison, and consequently welcomes papers that analyze the aforementioned corporate strategies in various industrial sectors and in various geographical areas of the global North and South.\n\n28. Counter-Hegemonic Epistemologies as Innovation and/or Contestation\n\nJames Hodges, Rutgers University\n\nYvonne Eadon, UCLA\n\nResistance to dominant modes of thinking, knowing, and doing can take a variety of forms– and often results in the production of new epistemological communities of practice. The counter-hegemonic epistemologies of conspiracy theorists, self-experimenters, citizen scientists, marginalized and oppressed communities, and members of many other knowledge domains frequently embody narratives and ways of knowing that run against the dominant paradigms of their social and historical contexts. Thomas Kuhn’s work on paradigm shifts is just one example of the turmoil around shifts in dominant scientific epistemology. In many cases, critical or disruptive epistemologies are met by those in power with skepticism and even fear.\n\nThis open panel calls for case studies addressing counter-hegemonic epistemologies in the fields of history of science and technology, as well as STS, information studies, education, media studies, and other relevant disciplines. We are particularly interested in research that brings a comparative historical perspective to bear on the continuously contested nature of dominant knowledge systems. Some points to consider could be: how have specific counter-narratives affected the dominant discourses in the fields that they challenge? Alternatively, how do dominant discourses overpower counter-hegemonic epistemologies? What kinds of contexts does this happen in, and what are the social, political, and historical implications of such contestation? We welcome submissions that address communities including but not limited to alternative education, decolonial science and technology, clandestine chemistry, whistleblowing, harm reduction, and radical politics. By bringing such disparate ways of knowing into contact, our panel aims to build towards a robust account of the innovation and contestation that prevail among counter-hegemonic epistemological communities.\n\n29. Creative Misfits: Imagining Non-Normative Bodies in Technosocial Practice\n\nCatherine Duchastel de Montrouge, STS Program, York University\n\nDrew Danielle Belsky, STS Program, York University\n\nFeminist STS scholars have stressed the importance of including engagements with creative life including literary and visual media as entry points into analysis of technosocial infrastructures, processes, and relations. Concepts like cyborgs and monsters also emphasize the boundary-crossing, embodied, and material aspects of knowledge creation by which subjecthood and world come into being together. However, use of non-normative forms of human embodiment and experience in STS scholarship has often resulted in the deployment of what feminist disability scholar Rosemarie Garland Thompson calls the theoretical generic disabled body (2011). She proposes instead that disability experience is, in part, one of misfitting between material embodiment and material world. Her definition recognizes the centrality of the fleshiness and contingencies of human embodiment but also the tangible effects of the techno-social worlds we inhabit.\n\nThis panel explores the productive and imaginative possibilities that arise from this misfitting of humans and material-social worlds, notably the ways in which practitioners and creators interact with and adjust the conditions of possibility for their representational practices. We invite papers that explore the generative frictions and interruptions to relations of power that engaging with non-normative bodyminds and experiences entail.We are particularly interested in how disabled identities are shaped by, and in turn influence creative practices, from online fan-fiction communities to graphic medicine. From web accessibility protocols to novel technologies, how are structures and processes created that make innovative representations possible? How might analysis of creative practices highlight the relational aspects of materiality as identity- and knowledge-building?\n\n30. Cryo-innovations: Life in the Age of Artificial Cold\n\nAnna Sofie Bach, University of Southern Denmark\n\nCharlotte Kroløkke, University of Southern Denmark\n\nCryopreservation has given way to a new scientific ice age: The ability to freeze and bank biological material is today a pivotal technological practice in animal breeding, conservation biology, and human reproduction. In the existing science and technology literature, the innovative and transformative potential of cold temperatures has been theorized as involving forms of hindsight, suspense and salvage (e.g. Hoeyer, 2017; Radin & Kowal, 2017; Radin, 2015). This panel invites transdisciplinary, empirical as well as theoretical papers related to the ways that cryobanking is imagined and animated in scientific, commercial, popular culture, and user accounts. Situated within feminist science and technology studies, we welcome papers that help explore the ways that cold temperatures interrupt understandings of linear time, human/non-human binaries as well as what comes to count as living matter. This includes, but is not limited to: 1. How the cryobanking of human and animal reproductive bits becomes imagined as a type of cryo-insurance, 2. How the cryobanking of human and animal wholes becomes imagined and animated as a type of cryo-optimism, 3. How the cryobanking of multiple species and seeds engage a type of cryopolitics, and 4. The cryo-aesthetics of cryobanking.\n\n31. Dancing The Anthropocene – Envisioning Rituals, Bodies, Environments And Political Situatedness Through The Lens Of Dance\n\nGloria Baigorrotegui, Instituto de Estudios Avanzados – Usach\n\nFlavio D’Abramo ,MPIWG Berlin\n\nAnnika Capelán\n\nDancing is a ubiquitous form and a powerful expression for thinking about bodies, energy, ecology and temporalities. At the same time dance is performed at different scales and intensities while also affected by experiences, improvisations and evocations. Dancing, as performative mode, draws our attention to two issues of ongoing importance to STS: (1) movements, fluidities and meanings and (2) relationality and materiality. Dance may thus be simultaneously literal and metaphorical, structured and spontaneous, producing situations that may lure knowing but render it beyond words. In this way it generates pathways to think through, but also possibilities to rethink/regenerate social life more generally. Here, dancing becomes an interesting focal point for exploring the Anthropocene.\n\nThis panel considers dancing as both a lens and a site for understanding social life and naturecultures. We invite papers and/or performances that attempt to disrupt entrenched ideas about human and/or multispecies relations, using dance and dancing to envision alternative worldviews and reframe key problems. We ask: how can STS scholars explore dancing as epistemic practice in the Anthropocene, both in its own terms and in conversation with more conventional academic ways of knowing?\n\nPossible topics are:\n\nDance in relation to memory, ritual, bodies, health, care and/or healing.\n\nDance in environmental perspective: relationality, materiality and senses of place.\n\nDance and temporalities.\n\nDance in/as political protests, resistance, negotiations.\n\nDance and migration.\n\nDancing as knowing-knowing as dancing.\n\nDancing as collaboration-collaboration as dancing.\n\nMultispecies, human-nonhuman dancing.\n\nFrictions and/or stillness/stasis/interruptions in dancing.\n\n32. Data and Markets: Devices, Practices and Representations\n\nMary Ebeling, Drexel University\n\nKevin Mellet, Orange Labs\n\nThomas Beauvisage, Orange Labs\n\nFranck Cochoy ,University Toulouse Jean Jaurès\n\nSTS scholars have long been interested in the assorted and diverse devices that equip markets, from market infrastructures to mundane marketing tools like shopping carts, knowledge devices, and measuring instruments. As markets are digitized, data are a key element in the operation of markets in a variety of forms: consumer records, scoring and targeting instruments, customization engines, algorithmic pricing, vending and trading machines. Hence, data act as a versatile, yet vital, apparatus for markets, through the construction of data as a device, a valuation tool, an infrastructure, or an asset. This panel aims to explore these various facets of data, and how these help to achieve markets. We particularly – though not exclusively – welcome contributions on three aspects of market ‘datafication’. First, emergent data-based images of the consumer enhance classic customer representations produced by marketing, through data innovations in CRM databases, data brokers’ segments, cookie-based data pools, and social media data. What lies behind these data doubles, and what are their lived and experiential effects on consumers? Secondly, with big data technologies, marketing knowledge is increasingly produced from the analysis of large databases that combine a diverse array of information on consumers, products, firms, and market operations. These data are then stabilized through metrics, dashboards and standards. How do these new knowledge devices reconfigure practices? Third, data fuels market automation mechanisms, such as algorithmic pricing, recommendation engines, programmatic advertising, high-frequency trading. How do algorithmic markets and digital platforms take place in practice, and how do they reconfigure market agencements?\n\n33. Decolonizing Science: Where Have We Gotten To?\n\nJoy Zhang, University of Kent\n\nMichael Barr, Newcastle University\n\nThe global trajectory of scientific innovations seems to be both interrupted and regenerated by the rise of the Rest. The ascent of China and India as serious contenders for global scientific leadership, thriving pockets of excellence in South America, and an emerging attentiveness to promoting pan-African research excellence, call into question the validity, authority and even relevance of a Western-dominated epistemic vision of what ‘good science’ is. A heightened and widened awareness to decolonise science among both the Global South and the Global North has led to genuine attempts at reshaping the production and delivery of knowledge. Yet such efforts and their impacts cannot be taken for granted. Some have argued that while the world is not flat, there is an observable trend of the ‘cosmopolitanization of science’, where stakeholders in the Global South capitalise on the concepts of risk and give rise to new ways of science governance. Others have cautioned against an intrinsic irony underlying ‘subaltern ethicality’, whose path to international recognition may re-enact existing hegemonic logic and reinforce scientific hegemony rather than decolonize it.\n\nWe invoke Spivak’s classic question: To what extent can the Subaltern speak (and be heard) amid a global entanglement of interests? What are the incentives and hindrances to decolonizing science in practice? How does this inform us about the organisation and governance of science for the public good? This session invites discussions on these questions from both the successful and less successful attempts to decolonise science in different regions.\n\n34. Designing and Building Social Mechanisms\n\nDaniel Breslau, Virginia Tech\n\nThe panel will bring together work on the growing number of synthetic social institutions mediated by economic theory, algorithms, datasets, and even experimental trials. These are sites where theory, code, and data, either generate price signals or produce matchings, in order to optimize some measured function. Examples are:\n\nMarket platforms and dynamic pricing\n\nLabor markets mediated by online platforms\n\nDating sites\n\nMatching algorithms for assignments to schools and training programs\n\nsharing economy platforms\n\nTaken as a whole, these mechanisms raise some crucial questions for the role of knowledge and technology in constituting social reality:\n\nHow do they grow? How do they achieve economies of scale or legal stats that makes it difficult to interact outside of them?\n\nPerformativity: how do these mechanisms perform models of optimization through the way they structure actors?\n\nSubjectivity: how does the mechanism shape the valuations and calculations made by participants?\n\nHow are desires assimilated to ordered preferences required by the mechanism?\n\nResistance: how do participants appropriate the mechanism for ends not intended by their owners and designers?\n\nWe expect and welcome submissions on a range of empirical topics, employing a range of methods, with the common goal of deriving analyses and insights that bridge these areas and contribute to a general understanding.\n\n35. Diagnosing Death: Critical STS Perspectives\n\nDylan Lott, Center for Healthy Minds/University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nAdvances in life-sustaining and monitoring technologies unavoidably problematize our understandings of dying, death and the range of conscious states in between which, increasingly, are defined through the use of technologically mediated assessments (e.g., coma, persistent vegetative state, MCS). The resultant ethical, economic, and cultural difficulties which attend the promise and perils of technologically mediated death and dying disrupt our notions of personhood, identity, and social obligation even as they tend to increase the length–though less often the quality–of life.\n\nThis panel invites papers which use critical, ethnographically informed STS theory and methods to interrogate and explore the technologies, networks, and interstitial spaces in and by which states of consciousness are assessed, the stages of dying are determined, and death pronounced. This panel also invites papers which interrogate the cascade of technologically mediated procedures which often follow, e.g., cessation of palliative care or life support, organ harvesting. Papers which examine institutional settings, practices, and rationale as they relate to specific technological devices (e.g., EEG, Bispectral Indexing) as nodes in diagnostic systems converging on death and dying are encouraged. This panel particularly welcomes papers that explore these topics across a range of cultural and socioeconomic domains and reflect on the ways in which critical perspectives rooted in STS may reflexively inform and configure technologically mediated assessments of dying, death and the states between.\n\n36. Digital Innovations and the Future(s) of Agriculture\n\nRitwick Ghosh, New York University\n\nKelly Bronson, Department Of Sociology And Anthropology, University Of Ottawa\n\nProponents of digital agriculture argue that innovations in sensing, big data and automation will transform how we think about and organize food systems. Digital technologies may optimize different components of production and distribution, with implications for productivity, profitability, social security and environmental protection. But as the land encounters the digital and the digital the land, it is important to consider how innovations are both shaping and being shaped by social and political processes and institutions. This panel is animated by the normative belief that STS attention to the interplay between technology and the social could advance a generative and timely analysis of digital agriculture.\n\nWe invite papers exploring the ways by which digital innovations are mobilized in food production and wider societal re-ordering. Panelists could consider how STS concepts such as co-production, assemblages, socio-technical systems or ontological politics could help in this work? What power dynamics are reproduced under so-called revolutionary innovations, and how are different groups problematizing and resisting stabilization as well as change? What social values are entangled with everyday technical practices to collect, order and (re)present agricultural data? How are farmers, agrochemical corporations, extension workers, governments and other social groups engaging with digital agricultural technologies?\n\nThrough this panel critically interrogating agricultural innovation (including what is assumed to be innovative), we secondarily hope to innovate STS’s disciplinary assemblages by making bridges with other fields attending to digital agriculture (food and rural studies, communication studies).\n\n37. Disrupting Algorithms: Innovating Work and Life in the Digital Economy\n\nAlessandro Delfanti, University of Toronto\n\nYujie Chen, University of Leicester\n\nWork is increasingly shaped by algorithms and automated technologies that standardize and organize the labor process, incorporate managerial tasks, and contribute to new forms of value generation. While this is depicted as a smooth process of innovation, the field is ripe with frictions and tensions.\n\nStudies on technology and workers have well-documented workers’ resistance to the introduction of new technologies on the shop floor from manufacturing to call centers. Building on this scholarly tradition, we aim to discuss how algorithmic power is confronted, negotiated, and disrupted by workers in today’s booming sectors of logistics, online crowdwork, or the so-called gig economy. The field of STS offers crucial concepts and tools to challenge the assumption of technology as an external force that single-handedly configures and controls the workforce. STS shed lights on how both the materiality and ideology of innovation are contested and practiced by specific actors.\n\nWe are interested in papers that deal with workers’ creative means of counteracting algorithmic control, from strikes and refusal to everyday resistance and coping, as well as new forms of worker-led organizations, in different geographical, social and cultural contexts. Perspectives rooted on user theory, political economy of technology, feminist theory of technology, and labour process theory are welcome among others. We also aim to solicit papers that document and study how workers alter, redefine, and regenerate meanings, opportunities, risks, and rewards other than those imposed by system algorithms and other technologies.\n\n38. Disrupting from the Inside: Towards a Research System Change\n\nJennifer Dahmen-Adkins, RWTH Aachen University\n\nAnita Thaler, IFZ – Interdisciplinary Research Centre for Technology, Work and Culture\n\nFor decades the European Union has policies in place and funding offered to foster gender equality in academia and research. The notion has turned from ‘fixing women’ to ‘fixing the institutions’ while at the same time new paradigms like ‘Responsible Research and Innovation’ (RRI), which see gender equality as integral part of research processes and contents, are proclaimed and advocated by the European Commission. But these policy-driven and requested change processes face inner-institutional as well as societal resistance (e.g. right political movement). Holistic systemic approaches are necessary to disrupt and interrupt traditional organizational structures towards social gender just work environments. The stronger institutionalisation of gender studies for instance in US American universities supported structural changes within the organisations, and makes gender equality efforts on the other hand more difficult in the majority of European institutions where gender studies are not structurally present and thus not acknowledged as research field. And while many European research performing organisations are still lacking gender programmes and gender equality offices, the feminist STS community discusses for decades the necessity to reflect on intersectional, LGBTQI* and postcolonial perspectives, which should be included in structural change policies as well.\n\nIn this open panel we want to stimulate cross-cultural knowledge exchange and try to foster the dialogue on intersectional perspectives on structural change in science and research organisations. We welcome theoretical and empirical papers, which contribute towards a better understanding on how structural and institutional conditions of precarious employment affect personal careers in multiple ways.\n\nWe are interested in papers on the macro-level of science policy and performance evaluation, on the meso-level of university governance and organisational effects (like ‘advanced discrimination’), and on the micro-level of individual careers and psychological factors (like ‘embodied anxiety’). Beside social justice, gender, and intersectional analyses, we especially encourage queer-feminist approaches and LGBTQ* perspectives. We would like to stimulate a discussion of papers, who dare to develop the vision of a fair, inclusive and just academic environment – how can disruptions from the inside work towards a system change in research and higher education?\n\n39. Disturbances, Recreation, and Renovation of Labor: AI, Robots, Platforms, and Algorithms\n\nJUAN ESPINOSA, Universidad Nacional Andrés Bello\n\nGloria Baigorrotegui, Instituto de Estudios Avanzados – Usach\n\nJorge Feregrino, FES Acatlán UNAM\n\nPedro Seguel-Varas, University of Texas at Austin\n\nLabor is at the center of innovation, whether it is in services or manufacture, media, or any other activity. Popular media and, recently, academic discourse, have been brimming with account on how new technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI), robots, platforms, and algorithms will transform the landscape of work, with ramifications for occupations and employment on a potentially grand scale. Science Technology and Society studies offer a good toolset to study such sort of disturbances, recreation, and renovation in labor and organizations.\n\nIn this panel, we invite diverse reflections that explicitly address how do these technologies replace and/or renovate labor practices and its meaning for societies. For instance, contributions can raise the question about what sort of materialities emerge in new labor ecologies or how modes of production are changing through a human-automation symbiosis in the work system. Contributions can be theoretically and/or empirically oriented.\n\nFurthermore, we invite contributions focused on visibilizing workers that are behind opaque processes of technological solutions (e.g. crowdworkers, maintainers), as well as types of related labor that is usually invisibilized (e.g. emotional labor, moderating, user content, etc.). Our exploration will include consideration of ethics, justice, system design, organization design, technology designers, maintenance, and new forms of work. We also invite to think about labor and power dynamics. For example: How data-driven technologies in the workplace change practices of managing control, surveillance or resistance? How do new technologies interact with outsourcing dynamics on a global scale, as well as with worker organizations?\n\n40. Domains of Critical Drug Studies: Absent Pleasures and Risky Presents in Emerging Spaces of Harm Reduction\n\nNancy Campbell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n\nThis open panel showcases new social innovations designed to address the critical cultural work performed by pharmaceuticals, their less licit siblings, and their difficult-to-classify cousins. The cultural presence of psychoactive drugs has grown in significance with recent changes in governance and commerce; agrarian and industrial production; and environmental and social effects. Risky presents occupy the foreground of drug epidemics, regularly figured as cultural crises through epidemiological reasoning. How shall STS make sense of drug science and pharmaceutical innovation in producing, sustaining, or diminishing drugs and their users? We seek papers that deal specifically with drugs as technologies of solidarity in proliferating sites of consumption and harm reduction; with the interruptions of pleasure, absent from discussions of alarm, pain, grief, loss, and harm; and with the sciences—done and over-done, undone and under-done—that make claims about the cultural work that drugs do in breaking down distinctions between medical and nonmedical sites, spaces, and forms of use. This panel will stage new work that opens up emerging spaces of harm reduction to critical scrutiny; historical, social, and cultural analysis that seeks to regenerate useable pasts; and will take an inclusive approach to new scholarship on the varieties of drug experience and conceptual frameworks used to make sense of drugs as powerful material-semiotic actors.\n\n41. Domestic Technologies: Place, Person, Process\n\nAmy Johnson\n\nLi Cornfeld, Amherst College\n\nDomestic technologies have long been a generative focus of feminist technology studies, the study of the social construction of technology, and scholarship on the social shaping of technology. Motivated by current sociotechnical challenges to public/private boundaries and the impact of economic disparity, war, and environmental crisis on homes and homelessness, we look anew at the relationship between the technological and the domestic to investigate contemporary lived experience. From this foundation, we pursue three lines of inquiry:\n\nDomestic technologies as objects of the home: Deeply sociotechnical, the home mixes the personal, relational, and architectural. How do household technologies, from weighted blankets to kimchi fridges, produce domesticity? How do different technological conceptions of the home, from refugee camp to castle to networked ecology, shape inhabitants’ lives?\n\nTechnologies as domestic persons: From homemaker and domestic worker to digital assistant and autonomous vacuum cleaner, the home supports varied forms of personhood. How do language, performance, and affective labor construct domestic technologies as persons—and humans as domestic technologies? How do materiality and design mark domestic technologies as persons and nonpersons?\n\nThe domestication processes of technology: The deep familiarity of the home makes it also a terrain of uncanny valleys. What practices, internal or external to the home, render domestic technologies acceptable, intimate, and familiar? What place does domesticity occupy in larger societal trajectories of technologies?\n\nWe invite papers drawing on diverse contexts and methodologies. This Open Panel will have a companion panel at the National Women’s Studies Association conference.\n\n42. Elements: Thinking our Present Elementally\n\nCourtney Addison, Victoria University of Wellington\n\nTimothy Neale, Deakin University\n\nThao Phan, University of Melbourne, Australia\n\nIn recent years, humanities scholars, social scientists, and others outside the physical and material sciences have set upon debates about the existence of a geological ‘age of the human,’ or the Anthropocene, intent to show how scientists are themselves ‘writing culture’ in these debates. The Anthropocene is, as many have noted, ‘a paradigm dressed as an epoch’ (Baskin, 2015). At the same time, there has been a renewed interest in the humanities and social sciences in engaging with many of the same materials at the centre of scientific discussions about the Anthropocene: fossils, minerals, soil, coal, plants, water, and so on. This has involved rethinking the ‘elemental’ basis of our surrounds as composed, perhaps, out of ‘elemental media’ (Peters, 2015).\n\nThere are (roughly) three senses of the elemental. In the first sense, elements are discrete chemical entities, like those named and schematised in the Periodic Table of Elements which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year. Elemental are the metals and non-metals of specific atomic compositions and weights, arranged and combined in diverse forms. In the second sense, the elemental names the environmental milieu, or material substrate, in which we are irrevocably embedded, in which different forms of life are immersed, enveloped, and take shape. It is from this perspective that scholars have begun to write of technology and infrastructure as ‘elemental’; as, to quote Edwards (2003), our ‘naturalized background, as ordinary and unremarkable to us as trees, daylight, and dirt’. The third sense of the elemental is the ontological one, the philosophical correlate of the first. Here, the elemental is not a material resource or background, but is a claim about the conditions-of-possibility of being and matter themselves. For an elemental philosophy, there are forces or forms of matter from which every other material is derived; they are the condition and horizon of sensible involvement in the world (Engelmann and McCormack, 2018).\n\nAt once, the elemental situates us, embeds us, and is beyond us. This panel seeks contributions that explore the value (and limits) of thinking our present elementally.\n\nReferences:\n\nBaskin J. (2015) Paradigm dressed as epoch: the ideology of the Anthropocene.

Emergent Technologies in Biomedicine and Healthcare: Boundaries, Tensions, and Possibilities\n\nMelanie Jeske, University of California, San Francisco\n\nRosalie Winslow, University of California, San Francisco\n\nEmergent technologies and the implementation of new and innovative models, measures, and systems present rich sites for STS scholars to follow, understand, and intervene on technologies in the making (Brey 2012; Guston 2014). As new technologies are implemented in existing biomedical research and healthcare infrastructures, they carry with them great promise to disrupt standards and routine practice as well as improve our understanding of health, illness, and the human body. Yet as STS scholars have shown, technologies often reproduce and deepen existing disparities (Eubanks 2018; Lee 2003; Murphy 2006; Noble 2018; Sankar et al. 2004; Shostak 2013). Studying how emergent technologies and systems are designed, regenerated, mechanized, commercialized, and integrated offers a window to understand the trajectory of technologies and the racialized, classed, and gendered logic of systems with which they interact. This panel invites empirical contributions that explore how emergent technologies and platforms are constructed, implemented, and standardized in biomedical and healthcare settings. In alignment with this year’s theme, papers should offer innovative approaches and generate new ways of reframing the promises of innovation. We particularly are interested in papers that examine the implications of emergent technologies and systems for inequality and health justice.\n\n44. Emotions and Affect in STS Work\n\nChristopher Caulfield, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)\n\nThe topic of emotions enters into STS work in diverse way. Baier (1987) and Gilligan (1982) have offered ground breaking work on the importance of emotionality for feminist critiques of masculine and patriarchal social structures. The relation between emotions and beneficence, caring, and motivation to help have featured centrally in STS scholarship, e.g. Epstein (1995) has emphasized the importance of people’s willingness to ‘invest emotionally’ in the fate of [a movement] and ‘take personal risks on its behalf' (1995: 413). Polleta, Jasper, and Goodwin (2001) have emphasized the importance of reincorporating emotions such as anger and indignation, fear and disgust, joy and love, into research on politics and protest (2001: 2). A focus on emotions are frequently posited as a useful antidote to instrumental rationality (Putnam & Mumby 1993). Empathy is frequently called for in clinical work as a means of improving care, e.g. Halpern (2014). Empathy and sympathy are considered as important for ethnographic work as a means of building trust and rapport, e.g. Reeves, Kuper & Hodges (2008). This open panel aims for a diverse array of papers on emotions and will consider the following questions:\n\nWhat is the history of emotions in STS work, and how can that history inform our visions for how to use affect and emotions to conduct fruitful work?\n\nHow should we think about the emotions in relation to reason, rationality, patriarchy, capitalism, gender discrimination, and racism?\n\nHow do emotions interact with technology?\n\nHow do emotions interact with the processes of science, its normative dimensions, and its assumptions?\n\nWhat role should emotions play in the formation and enactment of policy?\n\nThere is a parallel increasing interest in philosophy which has emphasized the ethical and metaethical theory of moral sentimentalism, rooted in the work of Adam Smith and of David Hume, which posits, roughly, that ethics and morality are rooted in human sentiments/emotions/affect. On this view, moral judgment is both expressed and constructed in a feeling of moral approval or disapproval of an action or an agent. How can/does STS respond to moral sentimentalism broadly speaking, and how can STS work regarding emotions incorporate, inform, or refine moral sentimentalist theory as an ethical and metaethical view?\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBaier, Annette C., 1987.

Engineers: Makers of the World or Cogs in the Machine?\n\nOlga Bychkova, European University at St.Petersburg\n\nNikolai Rudenko, European University at St. Petersburg\n\nSTS studies suggest that engineers gather heterogeneous entities in their projects (J. Law, M. Callon, L. Suchman). They make the technology work but also create a world around this technology (B. Latour). A new world entails the possibility of searching funding and political support, building new social ontology and enacting necessary infrastructure. Each engineer turns out to be a maker of a new world.\n\nHowever, such a picture contradicts the conventional vision. According to this vision, engineers usually rely on the standardized procedures and act as cogs in large technological systems. As such cogs, they tend to be as far as possible from the public discussions of their projects. So, who are the engineers today? The world-makers or those who perform a set of standard operations as far as possible away from public discussions? Are there cultural differences in such perceptions of engineers?\n\nIn our section, we propose to discuss the following questions:\n\nWhat are the genealogies of engineers in different cultural contexts? What the history of that profession can tell us about its current state?\n\nHow does material context mediate the engineers’ practices?\n\nWhat does a history of engineering education tell us? How does engineering education differ around the world?\n\nWhat is the role of engineers in public policy? Are there today experts-engineers who define policy issues?\n\nOur section invites all participants who are interested in technical expertise and public role of engineers to make a current snapshot of engineering profession around the world.\n\n46. Ethical Issues in Biomedical Research, Health Policy, and Clinical Practice\n\nMiranda Waggoner, Florida State University\n\nSusan Markens, Lehman College, CUNY\n\nThe first two decades of the twenty-first century have witnessed increasingly complex questions about ethics in biomedical research, health policy, and clinical practice—from the flourishing field of postgenomic research to the rapidly changing world of reproductive biomedicine. This open panel explores ethical issues in health and biomedicine that are being innovated by and regenerated with STS perspectives. This panel provides renewed attention to how ethics is and can be conceived and constructed by stakeholders involved in shaping and disseminating biomedical knowledge, and it interrogates how differently-situated actors in the biomedical sciences—from researchers and policymakers to those in the clinic—make sense of, define, challenge, and shape what is considered ethical in their work, and the consequences for health delivery and outcomes. Paper submissions may include, but need not be limited by, questions such as: How do biomedical researchers decide which questions about health need to be addressed? How do they conceptualize risk, and how do they recruit research subjects? What considerations matter to biomedical researchers when they convey their results? How and when do health-care policymakers decide to prioritize certain topics? How do policymakers construct guidelines and rules for health research, and to what extent do they consider the impact of their policymaking on different populations? How, when, and why do clinicians offer health testing, information, and interventions to their patients? How do clinicians navigate their various ethical obligations and responsibilities in promoting health and health care across population groups? We invite empirical papers from multiple disciplinary perspectives.\n\n47. Ethnic Studies and STS: Connections, Interruptions, Innovations\n\nRaymond Fang, University of California, Irvine\n\nThis panel aims to explore how ethnic studies and STS—two forms of academic inquiry that have typically remained locked in their own disciplinary silos—can mutually interrupt, regenerate, enrich, and inform the topics, conversations, and theories of each other’s fields in meaningful ways. Concerned primarily with United States-based ethnic studies, including but not limited to African-American Studies, Chicanx and Latinx Studies, Asian-American Studies, and Native American Studies, this panel asks what STS looks like when the questions and problematics central to US-based ethnic studies become key topics of investigation for STS, and vice-versa. What does STS look like—in its research questions, priorities, and theoretical interlocutors—when race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, migration, citizenship, indigeneity, and blackness, among others, become central problem spaces? Similarly, what does ethnic studies look like when science and technology become fundamental subjects and objects of investigation? This panel is looking for papers that attempt to link the problems, objects, questions, and theories of ethnic studies and STS, however constituted, through empirical research, theoretical explorations, and/or literary analysis. Such linkages might include but are not limited to: race and algorithmic governance; gentrification and technology; surveillance and migration; indigeneity and infrastructure; biomedicine and alternative medicine; race, gender, and science; race and environment; posthumanism and critical race theory.\n\n48. Experimental Infrastructures: Material Insufficiency, Scale, and the Question of (Im)possibility\n\nBrandon Costelloe-Kuehn, RPI\n\nGuy Schaffer, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\n\nWhen faced with obdurate systems, social movements often create experimental infrastructures that suggest radical new arrangements of resources, knowledges, and power. While these systems are often materially insufficient to immediately address the full scale of the problems that inspired them, they have the potential to reorganize the conditions that limit what people imagine as possible. What is the role of small-scale systems in pushing large-scale change? How do designers, developers, and maintainers of small-scale experimental infrastructures imagine the work of scaling up, building out, or strengthening these systems? How do they challenge the limits of time, materiality, and imagination? And how do small-scale infrastructural innovations challenge and reproduce relations of power?\n\nIn this open panel, we invite scholars and organizers who are working with movement-built infrastructures in a wide array of arenas. We are using movement in a broad sense to include any set of people that is working to crease social change.\n\nFundamentally, we are seeking to better understand how projects with incredible potential could scale in ways that change the conditions of possibility in the direction of a wildly different world. By pulling together these examples, we aim to help each other imagine alternative futures beyond what we can currently conceptualize, and develop strategies for getting from here to there.\n\n49. Experts of Subjective Thought: Producing Knowledge and Setting Standards\n\nLiora Goldensher, Princeton University\n\nLeah Reisman, Princeton University\n\nHow should STS approach expert domains that, instead of relying on a codified stock of objective knowledge, privilege the subjective? This panel invites papers about cases including emerging professions and unevenly regulated fields in which experts routinely and explicitly draw on personal experience, beliefs, ethics, and values to make decisions, legitimate their work, and set standards.\n\nSuch cases depart from many of the core assumptions of STS scholarship on the social production of scientific knowledge. From the Social Construction of Technology to Actor-Network theory, sociomateriality to infrastructure analysis, human judgment and social interaction are shown by analysts to be crucial in the process and outcome of knowledge production in scientific professions. In most such accounts, analysts reveal that the social production of facts and knowledge is core to a field that is typically–and erroneously–assumed to be objective. Scholars of the professions, too, have tended to presume objectivity as a feature or goal of the standardized bodies of abstract knowledge they describe professionals as applying to particular cases and defending from competitors.\n\nYet some domains of expert work, like the demedicalized midwifery and nonprofit consulting fields the organizers of this panel study, trouble this assumption with their embrace of the interpretive and the subjective. How might STS contend with knowledge production and standard-setting in these expert domains that do not have uniform goals of objectivity or codified and settled bodies of knowledge? How do other features of expert domains, including codes of ethics and forms of licensure or credentialing, differ in these circumstances? What challenges are presented for prevailing assumptions in STS about the process of knowledge production or standard-setting by considering expert domains that do not rely on the codified knowledge-producing activities and expectations that characterize the subjects of much STS attention to expertise and the professions?\n\n50. Exploring Policies and Practices of Studying and Monitoring the Oceans: Innovations and Interruptions in Ocean Science\n\nSarah Rijcke, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)\n\nAlice Vadrot, University of Vienna\n\nHealthy oceans contribute significantly to combating climate change. However, a lack of ocean scientific knowledge continues to challenge efforts to protect ocean ecosystems. This gap is steadily closed by global initiatives like the International Census of Marine Life programme. Furthermore, detection methods, observing infrastructures and data management have significantly improved over the past two decades, reconfiguring how oceans are studied and monitored.\n\nIn many respects, the study and monitoring of the oceans represents a new form of knowledge production. Challenges include producing systemic insights into ocean ecology; working toward industrial-scale production of innovations; providing scientific data to support environmental policy; and operating against the backdrop of a highly research-focused academic system. These developments are amplified by data scarcity, complicating the command of funding and shaping policies and practices of studying, monitoring and protecting the oceans.\n\nThis panel invites contributions on the socio-technical, epistemic, (geo)political, historical and ethical dimension of these developments, including case studies related to global and national policies and practices of ocean science and monitoring. Which dynamics occur when ocean science becomes (even more) subject to multiple valuation registers, including those associated with steering efforts toward more interdisciplinary engagement, societal relevance and demands from policy-makers? How do monitoring policies and practices contribute to the scientific representation of the ocean and its manifestation as a site, where different technological innovations compete for scientific legitimacy and marketability? What are key innovations in ocean science and marine technology and how do they shape the policies and practices of the field?\n\n51. Exploring Regional Innovation Cultures: Regional Diversity, Cultural Imaginations, and Social Cohesion in Innovation Theory and Practice\n\nLuise Ruge, TU München\n\nAlexander Wentland, Technical University of Munich\n\nSebastian Pfotenhauer, Technical University Munich\n\nUniversalist models of innovation face a crisis of both technical reproducibility and societal support. The geography of innovation is thoroughly unequal. Repeated failures to spur innovation in so-called developing or underperforming regions have revealed the limits of thinking about innovation in terms of quasi-universal models (e.g. National Innovation Systems) or best practice transfer (e.g. Silicon Valley). At the heart of this problem is the persistent inability to seriously include local socio-economic traditions, political cultures, and regional identity into mainstream innovation theory.\n\nWe invite contributions (incl. unconventional formats) that explore how regions perceive and position themselves vis-à-vis the perceived innovation imperative through their unique local social, cultural, and political constraints. How do globally circulating models interrupt or, perhaps, regenerate existing regional identities and institutional orders? What happens when populations reject or subvert innovation initiatives? What alternative imaginations of economic prosperity and epistemic authority do they propose instead?\n\nThis session seeks to muster new support for a cultural turn in innovation theory and practice. We argue that the successes and failures of innovation policy in regions cannot be explained without taking into account the locally specific understandings of what innovation is, what (and who) it is for, how it relates to local history and identity, and in which political culture it is embedded – even if, on the face of it, the policy instruments look the same. We encourage all types of submissions that provide a counterpoint to the persistent tendencies to frame analyses and interventions around quasi-universal models, systems, and best practices.\n\n52. Feeding The Anthropocene: The Promises Of Agri-Food Tech And The Difference Of Food\n\nCharlotte Biltekoff, UC Davis\n\nJulie Guthman, University of California, Santa Cruz\n\nThe agri-food sector is seeing a tidal wave of innovation. With the backing of venture capital, scientists cum entrepreneurs are deploying new techniques in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, tissue engineering, digitalization, big data analytics, robotics, and other fields, with the aim of both improving upon and disrupting farming and food production. As STS and other scholars have pointed out, much of the financial investment is speculative and the technologies promissory, operating with much uncertainty regarding their potential to scale up and be accepted by the public much less provide things of value to their imagined clientele. Papers selected for this open call will draw on case study material to build upon these emergent observations. We are particularly interested in papers that cross fertilize questions and concerns from STS, such as public acceptance of technology, with those of food studies, such as the exceptionalism of food and agriculture. More pointedly, we ask how and to what extent do food and farm tech entrepreneurs engage the specificity of food and farming as organic, biological processes uniquely laden with cultural meaning in their techno-utopian dreams for Anthropocene futures.\n\n53. Feminist Technoscience by Other Means: Reconfiguring Research Practices for World-Making Beyond the Academy\n\nLisa Lehner, Cornell University\n\nJade Henry, Goldsmiths, University of London\n\nFeminist Science and Technology Studies (FSTS) can be a subfield, an ethico-political commitment or a methodological sensibility. At its heart, it shares concerns for subjectivities that are devalued, marginalized or erased through technoscientific practices. Through their efforts, feminist scholars participate in the material-semiotic becoming of things (Puig de la Bellacasa 2011) and alternative world-making.\n\nThis panel (re)connects reflexively with these ethico-political commitments and sensibilities. We will explore how the disruptive, inventive and (re)generative potential of FSTS might give rise to new and alternative, if partial and imperfect, worlds of scholarship and living. We want to understand how we can trouble and reinvent our methods and concerns in order to (re)configure the precarious and unstable worlds in which we live and work. How can we move our commitments beyond the academy; how must methods and theories change; how might they then reconfigure academia itself? Which novel collaborations, networks and assemblages can we forge; what roles can FSTS research (not) take? How might we mobilize ambivalences and situated knowledges to connect with worlds inhospitable to them; what challenges and dangers lie therein?\n\nThis panel is not exclusive to but actively encourages PhDs and early-career scholars from FSTS, post-colonial STS and other emancipatory engagements with technoscience to showcase their creative/disruptive interpretations of these themes. Provocations may, but need not, include: reflections on ethnographic positionality and research ethics; novel pathways for non-traditional academic careers; new epistemic and aesthetic forms of knowledge production; fostering alternative attachments and alignments across traditional boundaries of human/nonhuman, social/natural, academia/beyond.\n\n54. Finance as Science, Technology and Innovation System\n\nJessica Weinkle, University of North Carolina- Wilmington\n\nModern finance is highly dependent on technology and scientific research. The interdependency is clearly apparent in the extent to which the financial sector actively supports research in-house, and in university and government institutions. The relationship is mutually beneficial. Scientists demonstrate the relevance of their work to society through use by financial interests. In turn, financial interests garner legitimacy from the high esteem society bestows on science and scientists. Yet, society also struggles with its modern financial systems at every level: from global economic instability to the equitable allocation of financial resources at the individual level. Often these struggles are tied to changes in scientific knowledge and the (mis)use of technology. The aim of this panel is to consider society’s struggles with its financial systems, broadly construed, from the perspective of finance as a technology and innovation system"
