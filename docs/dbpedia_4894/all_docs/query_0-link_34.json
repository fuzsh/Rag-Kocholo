        "text": "Debates over the nature, significance and legacy of the Northern Ireland civil rights movement tend to stress its Catholic and irredentist character. This article takes a different approach by examining the role of those activists from a Protestant and socialist background who played important roles in agitating for redress of socio-economic and political grievances. In particular, the article focuses on the involvement of individual members of the bi-confessional Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. It considers the NILP's relationship to other civil rights bodies, such as the Campaign for Social Justice and the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster, and asks how its approach differed. Drawing on extensive empirical research - including previously untapped archival sources and oral histories - the article also sets out to challenge the orthodox public and academic interpretation of the civil rights movement as ostensibly anti-partitionist in political orientation or devoid of significant Protestant and socialist participation. The central argument is that the NILP remained ill-equipped to become the political vanguard of the radical street politics, not because it was tethered to a narrow non-sectarian agenda but because it was deeply wedded to the process and fundamentals of British parliamentary democracy.\n\n‘The Long Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland, 1921-39: Labour and Progress in Loyal Ulster’, Seán Byers and Francis Devine, eds, William Walker 1870-1918: Belfast Labour Unionist Centenary Essays (Dublin: Umiskin Press, 2018). The foundation of the Northern Ireland State in 1921 – the political conflict and violence which accompanied the foundation and subsequent maladministration of the State – created substantial democratic issues in the region. These democratic issues, often referred to during the inter-war period as issues of ‘civil liberty’ rather than rights, formed the basis for the development of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland in the 1960s. The Northern Ireland State from inception was a democratised ancien régime, a poetics and aesthetics of loyalty; it is this régime of police order I designate ‘the moral economy of loyalty’.2 Those considered loyal were recognised, granted ‘liberties’ and given the patronage of the State and the local elite. All opposition, by contrast, was designated disloyal. This created a number of outsiders in local society: liberals, independent Unionists, Irish nationalists, Irish republicans and separatists, Gaelic language enthusiasts, Catholics, progressives and the left and Labour, were all considered disloyal. The long history of the Civil Rights Movement in Northern Ireland can be traced to the political decisions and administration of the 1920s and 1930s. It was from the cauldron of disloyal politics in the inter-war period that the Civil Rights Movement eventually emerged in Northern Ireland.\n\nSUMMARY The concept of \" silence \" is used to examine the everyday experience of lived violence in the prolonged ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland. I analyze silence as coercion, cultural censorship, embodied, and an integral component of identity and consciousness affected by a diaspora. Silence is intrinsic to the symbolic violence that is enacted in commemorations. This is a silencing of alternative histories and memories, and the ethnic identities in which these are rooted. It is also a silencing of place and an attempt to create new kinds of territorial belongings. I explore the multiple ways through which violence is manifested both symbolically and physically, penetrates the ordinary, as well as the pivotal role of borders in the creation and maintenance of boundaries. I examine how border crossing opens up a liminal space of possibilities. I argue that border regimes are not restricted to the periphery. Rather, they penetrate deep into the center into the informal spaces of the everyday. I argue that silence is a culturally learned strategy through which fear, experienced socially, can be normalized, routinized, and negotiated. I question the efficacy of truth and reconciliation commissions, as well as the drive to \" speak \" violence. Although the bulk of this essay relates to the production of silence during the Troubles, I extend this analysis to the present era. [ethnicity, Northern Ireland, silence, violence]"
