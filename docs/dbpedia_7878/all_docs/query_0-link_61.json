        "text": "Gone Is Gone, a newly-formed supergroup comprised of members of Mastodon, Queens Of The Stone Age and At The Drive-In, have shared a new song.\n\n‘Starlight’ is the second song that the band have made available to stream from their debut self-titled EP, due out on July 8. Last month, the four-piece shared the EP’s opening track ‘Violescent’.\n\nGone Is Gone’s line-up includes Mastodon singer/bassist Troy Sanders, QOTSA guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, At the Drive-In drummer Tony Hajjar, and multi-instrumentalist Mike Zarin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVan Leeuwen appeared on Jehnny Beth’s (Savages) Beats 1 radio show to premiere the new track. He also discussed the aesthetic of the band, telling Beth: “We’re still trying to have it be something that’s cinematic more than a rock band”.\n\nThe group are also planning to release a 13-track album later this year.\n\nHajjar and Zarin have worked together on a string of projects over the past seven years. The duo have scored several film trailers, as well as the 2013 video game Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist.\n\nRecommended\n\n“The thought behind this band is to combine what most of us know from many years of being in touring/recording entities and our love of scoring,” Hajjar told Rolling Stone, adding “Our goal is to be able to do more of this within this project.”"
