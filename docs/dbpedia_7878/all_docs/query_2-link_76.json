        "text": "Album Of The Week-\"Of Sound Mind\"-Ancestors (2009)\n\nI noticed that a few of you had this album in your top 10 for 2009, and quite frankly do not know for the life of me how I let this one slip past my ears. If you are into the psychedelic side of Stoner Rock, then this album is one you should definitely check out. I may just have to update my Top 10 of 2009. Therefore, I am making \"Of Sound Mind\" by Ancestors my Album Of The Week.\n\nReview:\n\n\"Ancestors' masterful debut, \"Neptune with Fire\" , was apparently nothing more than a demo. The band wanted to re-record it, but Tee Pee Records insisted it was fine as it was. The label was right - Neptune with Fire was lightning in a bottle and I'm of the opinion that trying to recreate it could've been a fool's errand. All the same, that revelation further piqued my interest in their sophomore album, Of Sound Mind. What would this California-based five piece do with the luxury of studio time?\n\nProduction-wise, there actually isn't that much of a difference - a touch more clarity overall, and the vocals are occasionally pushed further up in the mix (too far at times, but since the band's usually skyrocketing off on some inspired instrumental trip, it's a minor quibble). Music-wise, it's also more of the same, but seeing how “the same” in this case is a mish-mash of Kyuss by way of King Crimson by way of Sleep by way of Pink Floyd by way of Neurosis by way of Hawkwind, you can't say they're not pushing themselves.\n\nAnd with the eight song Of Sound Mind (of which four stretch past the ten minute mark), Ancestors continues to defy any attempt at pigeonholing. They effortlessly move from one genre to the next with such grace that it's a seamless transition. Obviously, the longer cuts - “Mother Animal, “The Bounty of Age,” “The Trial,” and “The Ambrose Law” - in particular offer ample evidence of the band's musical dexterity (the shorter numbers serve mostly as vignettes between songs, although “Challenging” seems to be a longer, more fleshed out version of “Not the Last Return”). There's an instinctive sense of knowing when and how to turn a doom riff into a rock one and let it stretch out before bringing it back to its original form.\n\nI'm not sure I could pick any one song as the highlight, as each has something unique to offer (okay, maybe not so much with “From Nothing”). I will say that “Bounty of Age” is a testament to the band's guitar playing, that Black Math Horsemen's Sera Timms adds some captivating vocals to “The Trial,” and that while “The Ambrose Law” is the most conventional of the four epics, it's straightforward approach serves as the perfect end to an album that's as emotionally complex as it is musically. Ancestors was off to a fine start with Neptune with Fire and on Of Sound Mind, they've taught the old dog of progressive stoner rock enough tricks to grant it a permanent spot in Cirque du Soleil. Recommended.\" (John Pegoraro, StonerRock.com)\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.From Nothing\n\n02.Mother Animal\n\n03.Not the Last Return\n\n04.Bounty of Age\n\n05.A Friend\n\n06.The Trial\n\n07.Challenging\n\n08.The Ambrose Law\n\nListen\n\nMySpace\n\nOfficial Website\n\nAlbum Review - Blood of the Tyrant: Self-Titled EP\n\nChicago's Blood of the Tyrant have created an impressive 4 song EP that feels almost like a full length album, due in no small part, to the fact that 3 of the 4 tracks clock in at over 7 minutes long. Listening to the proggy sludge of BotT, it's hard to believe that vocalist/guitarist Josh Primack, drummer Chris Avgerin, bassist Kevin Emmons and guitarist Michael Galaboff, aren't from the sweaty, Southern confines of Atlanta, Georgia. Their sound bares a striking resemblance to the early work of Atlanta's favorite metal sons, Mastodon, and vocalist Primack is at times a dead ringer for the vocal stylings of Daath, another metal act that calls Atlanta home.\n\nWith that said, this is no ripoff, and for a debut EP I have to tell you, I can't wait to see where these guys go from here. \"Flaw of the Sentient Being\" opens things up with a catchy interplay between guitar and rhythm section before a second guitar joins in to create a maelstrom of heavy goodness. But just when you think you know where this band is headed, they throw you a curveball with Primack's vocals as he enters the fold with strikingly evil audacity...this son of a bitch sounds downright demonic! And that's what sets BotT apart from other prog/stoner/doom bands, even the aforementioned Mastodon. Those vocals will keep the casual fans at bay, ensuring only those with an ear for true metal stick around for the entirety of this EP. Towards the end of the first track, when the band picks up the pace and Primack growls \"we are the right, we are the chosen...and nothing will save you now\"...I have no idea what he's talking about, but I'm ready to join in whatever fight he's leading. Holy shit this is good stuff!\n\n\"The Gunslinger\" slows things back down briefly with its classic Clutch-like stoner riff until, you guessed it, Primack's demonic wail reenters the fold to remind you this is something altogether different. By that point you're locked in though and the band takes off behind him, carrying the track to another level. The riffs from the dual guitar attack of Primack and Galaboff sound absolutely majestic on this EP. But something I haven't mentioned yet, which is also prevalent throughout these 4 tracks is Avgerin's drumming. The crisp pop on the snare reminds me of John Stanier's work on \"Meantime\" era Helmet. As metal as this stuff sounds, there's no double bass to be found, just that nice pop and lots and lots of crash cymbals.\n\nSpeaking of Helmet, when track 3, the 10-plus minute \"Helena\" opens, the vocals even evoke Page Hamilton, albeit briefly, before they quickly shift back to the guttural variety. BotT do an amazing job of using the vocals to compliment the songs, but Primack knows when to step aside and allow the music to take center stage. The band finds that perfect balance of showcasing their instrumental prowess, incorporating the vocals at just the right moments. Expansive stretches of music, sans-vocals are not uncommon throughout these 4 tracks. As a matter of fact, the coda to this collection of songs is an instrumental piece titled \"Meteors (Extinction)\". The song flows well enough with the rest of the EP, but why the band decided not to add vocals to this particular track isn't obvious as it doesn't appear to be anymore complicated or complex than the others.\n\nWith that said, this is a promising start for this Windy City band. It isn't often that a debut EP offers such a fresh perspective on an old style, but BotT have done just that. Call it Stoner Death or Doom Grind, but the mish mash of intricate prog-metal and sludgy doom combined with the roar of the vocals sounds fresh and on time. Check these guys out and you'll see for yourself...nothing will save you now.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Flaw Of The Sentient Being (7:08)\n\n02. The Gunslinger (4:51)\n\n03. Helena (10:44)\n\n04. Meteors (Extinction) (8:45)\n\nBand:\n\nChris Avgerin - Drums/Vocals\n\nKevin Emmons - Bass/Vocals\n\nMichael Galaboff - Guitar/Vocals\n\nJosh Primack - Guitar/Vocals\n\nMySpace\n\nBuy Here!\n\nFor fans of Mastodon , Baroness , Isis , High on Fire , Zombi and Black Sabbath ."
