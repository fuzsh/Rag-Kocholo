        "text": "Members of Mastodon, At the Drive-In and Queens of the Stone Age have formed a new band, Gone is Gone.\n\nThe line-up of the experimental metal supergroup consists of Mastodon singer/bassist Troy Sanders, QOTSA guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, At the Drive-In drummer Tony Hajjar, and multi-instrumentalist Mike Zarin.\n\nGone is Gone will make their live debut at Los Angeles’ Dragonfly on April 27, reports Rolling Stone. They plan to release an EP this summer and have made its lead single, ‘Violescent’, available to stream today. A 13-track album is also earmarked for release for later this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHajjar and Zarin have worked together on a string of projects over the past seven years. The duo have scored several film trailers, as well as the 2013 video game Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Blacklist.\n\n“The thought behind this band is to combine what most of us know from many years of being in touring/recording entities and our love of scoring,” Hajjar told Rolling Stone, adding “Our goal is to be able to do more of this within this project.”"
