        "text": "Today brings word of a new supergroup by the name of Gone Is Gone. The outfit plan to release a debut EP this summer through their own imprint label on Rise Records. Among their lineup are:\n\nVocals/bass – Troy Sanders (Mastodon)\n\nGuitars – Troy Van Leeuwen (Queens Of The Stone Age, etc.)\n\nGuitars/keyboards – Mike Zarin\n\nDrums – Tony Hajjar (At The Drive-In/Sparta)\n\nA preview of their debut single “Violescent” is available below while the band will make their live debut at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles, CA on April 27th. Hajjar told Rollingstone.com of the project:\n\n“Gone Is Gone is a project that can live even when we are working with our other entities as well. The goal is to be able to compose remotely, if needed, on film, trailers, or on anything else that comes up … It feels good to know that all this music will see the light of day soon.”\n\nSanders added:\n\n“The vibe from day one was, and has been, very therapeutic and refreshing for me. The chemistry was immediate. I can only dedicate myself to something that rewards me purely, and we are all in this for the right reasons.”"
