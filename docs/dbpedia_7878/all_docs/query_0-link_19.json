        "text": "Who the hells knows if Giraffe Tongue Orchestra or whatever the Corpsegrinder/Adam D./Shannon Lucas project is called will ever actually get around to releasing music — coal turns to diamonds in less time than has elapsed since those bands were first announced.\n\nBut if you’re hankerin’ for a new supergroup to fawn over, here’s one that is definitely, 100% releasing something: Gone is Gone, featuring Troy Sanders (Mastodon, Killer Be Killed), Troy Van Leeuwen (Queens of the Stone Age, Ex-A Perfect Circle), Tony Hajjar (At the Drive-In, Sparta), and Mike Zarin (no idea), will release their debut EP sometime this summer via their own imprint on Rise Records. The band (who I’m assuming were christened by Yogi Berra), have even released a preview of the EP’s first single, “Violescent.” And it sounds promising! Check it out:\n\nThe band will make their live debut at Dragonfly in L.A. on April 27. Hopefully they’ll get to play some other shows in the not-too-distant future, too.\n\nMore news as soon as we get it…"
