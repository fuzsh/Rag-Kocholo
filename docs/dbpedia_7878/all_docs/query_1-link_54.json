        "text": "As one of the most vital heavy metal bands of today, Mastodon have had their fair share of legendary moments in their 18-year history. And the Atlanta prog/sludge shredders are about to notch one more achievement with the release of their limited edition Emperor Of Sand picture disc. Only 4,000 copies of the full colour 12” vinyl have been pressed for Record Store Day – and will surely be one of the most sought after releases on April 21. (Take it from Karl Groeger, Jr., co-owner of famed U.S. record store Looney Tunes, as we reported yesterday.)\n\nSo in honour of the occasion, we thought we should take a look back at the 10 greatest Mastodon moments of all time. Let’s revisit the following game-changing milestones throughout the band’s two-decade career:\n\nJanuary 14, 2000: Mastodon’s Second Band Practice\n\nIt was nearly two decades ago that drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved from upstate New York to Atlanta, Georgia, and met bassist Troy Sanders and guitarist Brent Hinds at a High On Fire show in 1999. After seeing Brent play with his and Troy’s then-band, Four Hour Fogger, Bill invited the guitarist to come jam with him and Brann on January 13, 2000. But according to a 2009 interview with Spin, Bill claims that “Brent showed up so wasted he couldn’t even play… He was just playing one note turned up really loud. Brann and I were like, ‘Fuck this guy.’” But when Brent returned the next day, “He grabbed one of my guitars and was playing all this cool shit,” Bill says. Brent recruited Troy to play bass shortly after, and Mastodon’s line-up was solidified.\n\nDecember 25, 2004: Leviathan Wins Album Of The Year\n\nMastodon’s first video release was also their last for Relapse Records (before their contract with Warner Brothers would begin). The epic (and we don’t use that word lightly) DVD includes a 45-minute documentary, a compilation of 28 live performances from 2000-2005, and three music videos (plus a behind-the-scenes short). Upon its release, the collection served both as a mind-blowing introduction to the band’s work thus far, and an indication to their hungry fans of what was to come. The Workhorse Chronicles made it clear that Mastodon were not fucking around.\n\nNovember 1, 2006: First TV Appearance\n\nMastodon made its television debut by performing Colony Of Birchmen – the first single from their freshly minted album Blood Mountain – on Late Night with Conan O’Brien. After absolutely crushing the performance, the band triumphantly (and immediately) departed for Europe to open for Tool on tour. Sadly, video of the appearance is no longer available online, BUT IT LIVES ON IN OUR HEARTS.\n\nApril 13, 2007: Debut of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Movie\n\nWe may not have evidence of Mastodon’s first TV appearance, but video does exist of the band performing the song 10 months later at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards alongside Queens Of The Stone Age’s Josh Homme. And yet, despite the fantastic performance, and the marking of the band’s first major nomination, their appearance at the awards show is also infamous for a brawl involving System Of A Down’s Shavo Odadjian. According to a police report cited by Las Vegas Weekly, Brent Hinds drunkenly took off his shirt and hit Shavo with it, then punched singer-songwriter William Hudson in the face and chest. The victims retaliated, dishing Brent a broken nose, some black eyes, and a bad head injury. …Okay, in retrospect, while the latter half of this moment is laughable in hindsight, maybe it actually wasn’t so “great” at the time.\n\nJune 18, 2010: Jonah Hex Hits Theaters\n\nMastodon’s movie career didn’t end with one track for a cult animated flick – the band doubled down on its Hollywood contributions with an entire score for a feature length film. Unfortunately, even with its soundtrack – composed by Mastodon and Marco Beltrami – the DC comic adaptation of Jonah Hex hit theaters on June 18, 2010 with what can only be described as a shudder-inducing thud: after an onslaught of chillingly bad reviews, the movie only grossed $11 million on a $47 million budget (and that’s even with the band scoring the film for “basically nothing”). But the bright spot here is that it provided a new and exciting experience for the band, proved what they were capable of, and likely served as much of an influence on their future releases as Blood Mountain did on this movie.\n\nFebruary 11, 2012: Live at O2 Academy Brixton"
