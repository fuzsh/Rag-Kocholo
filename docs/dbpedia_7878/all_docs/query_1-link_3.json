        "text": "Members of Mastodon, Queens of the Stone Age, and At the Drive-In have teamed up to form a new band, Gone is Gone. The supergroup comprises Mastodon singer/bassist Troy Sanders, QOTSA guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, At the Drive-In drummer Tony Hajjar, and multi-instrumentalist Mike Zarin. Rolling Stone reports that the quartet will play their first show on April 27 at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles, with an EP slated to arrive in the summer via Rise/BMG. They're also plotting a 13-track LP for later this year, along with music for potential soundtracks or scores. Preview the supergroup's debut single, \"Violescent,\" below.\n\nGone is Gone marks the latest in a long string of collaborations between Hajjar and Zarin. As Rolling Stone points out, the duo have been working together for the past seven years on scores for several film trailers, as well as the 2013 video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist. \"The thought behind this band is to combine what most of us know from many years of being in touring/recording entities and our love of scoring,\" Hajjar explained, adding that the duo plan on incorporating scoring into their roles within the group."
