        "text": "Another day, another supergroup. This time members from Queens of the Stone Age, Mastodon, and At the Drive In have joined forces to make Gone is Gone, an experimental rock supergroup.\n\nTony Hajjar (At The Drive In), Mike Zarin, Troy Van Leeuwen (Queens Of The Stone Age) and Troy Sanders (Mastodon) formed the band and plan to release their debut EP later on this year.\n\nThe origins of the band came about when Hajjar and Zarin were working together on film scores and they realised that the potential to take their collaboration further was unmissable. Josh Homme’s trusty lieutenant Van Leeuwen was then recruited, with the trio meeting up and recording an EP’s worth of material inside their first few sessions together. The final piece of the puzzle coming when Sanders was brought in as the vocalist for the band.\n\n“When thinking of singers, a few came to mind, but Sanders’ voice and presence kept on coming up in conversations. Both Troy’s had always talked about doing something together, so it was an easy connection. Sanders flew in and tracked some demos to the finished music, and it went from there,” Hajjar told Rolling Stone.\n\nGone is Gone is now a reality and as they gear up for their first ever show at the Dragonfly in Los Angeles on the 27th April, Sanders was left to reflect on how it all came together.\n\n“The vibe from day one was, and has been, very therapeutic and refreshing for me. The chemistry was immediate,” Sanders said.\n\nIn the same interview Hajjar added, “It feels good to know that all this music will see the light of day soon.”\n\nThe upcoming record was taken from hours of jam sessions that the band played, with Sanders flying into LA to join the band periodically.\n\n“The thought behind this band is to combine what most of us know from many years of being in touring/recording entities and our love of scoring,” Hajjar said.\n\nThe quartet will release their EP this summer via the band’s own imprint. The first single taken from the record is Violescent, which you can preview in a brief 30 second teaser below:\n\nImage: Music Radar"
