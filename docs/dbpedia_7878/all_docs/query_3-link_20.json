Their musical style features progressive concepts and unique instrumentation though their sound early on bore a resemblance to sludge metal. All four members participate in vocals, creating a unique blend of singing styles and voices. The band is also known for trying to constantly change their sound to avoid \"writing the same album twice\".\n\nSince their inception Mastodon have released seven studio albums, with their debut album Remission (2002) garnering critical acclaim and over time building more of a fanbase as their sound adapted over time with 2011's The Hunter garnering commercial success and widening their audience. The band has made appearances with a wide range of other medias (Whether acting or contributing music) such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Monsters University and Game of Thrones to name a few.\n\nThe song \"Colony of Birchmen\" from the band's third album (released in 2006), Blood Mountain, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2007. Blood Mountain was followed in 2009 by Crack the Skye, and in 2011 by The Hunter, which debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved major commercial success in the United States. The Hunter features the song \"Curl of the Burl\", which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 2012. Mastodon's 2014 album, Once More 'Round the Sun, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart and features the band's third Grammy-nominated song, \"High Road\". The band's seventh album, Emperor of Sand, was released on March 31, 2017, and features the band's most commercially successful song to date, \"Show Yourself\", which peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in June 2017. The followup single, \"Steambreather\", peaked at number 18 on the same chart in October 2017. The album's opening track, \"Sultan's Curse\", earned the band their first Grammy award. Emperor of Sand was the band's first album to receive a Grammy nomination. It was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCall of The Mastodon: Formation and Relapse Years (2000 - 2005)[]\n\nMastodon was formed on 13 January 2000,[1] after drummer Brann Dailor and guitarist Bill Kelliher moved to Atlanta from Victor, New York. At the time Brent Hinds and Troy Sanders were in a band known as Four Hour Fogger. Four Hour Fogger would open for High on Fire in late 1999 at a basement show in Atlanta, leading to the four members of the band meeting.[2] They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of sludge metal bands Melvins and Neurosis, heavy metal legends Iron Maiden, and 1970s hard rock band Thin Lizzy, and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he \"showed up so wasted he couldn't play\".[3]\n\nIn an interview with Decibel, Matt Pike of High on Fire recalls the fateful night the members of Mastodon would meet:\n\n“ “Troy [Sanders] and Brent [Hinds] were in Four Hour Fogger, and Brann [Dailor] and Bill [Kelliher] just happened to come to the show. Brent gave me mescaline the first time I had met him and we spent the whole night tripping balls. Next thing I knew, those dudes had an album out together.” ”\n\n— Matt Pike, [4]\n\nMastodon initially had started as a quintet, with Eric Saner being the sole vocalist. The band recorded a nine-song self-titled demo in 2000, featuring Eric Saner on vocals. However, Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four-song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records (2001's Slick Leg, Mastodon landed a record deal with Relapse Records in 2001. Mastodon released the EP Lifesblood on 18 September 2001 as the now-quartet began to perform more shows, now with Sanders and Hinds sharing vocal duties. The band would begin to perform more be it in Georgia or in the states surrounding, eventually releasing their debut album Remission on 28 May 2002. with the singles \"March of the Fire Ants\" and \"Crusher/Destroyer\" (which was also featured on Tony Hawk's Underground). On each of Mastodon's first three full-length albums the last track was an instrumental composition with a title that related to the Elephant Man, along with a theme of the elements (Remission's theme being \"Fire\")[5] Mastodon would begin to tour more frequently, supporting Avenged Sevenfold and The Dillinger Escape Plan along with participating in the 2003 edition of the Relapse Contamination Festival[6] and its subsequent tour.[7] Mastodon would also tour Europe for the first time in 2003 with High on Fire.\n\nMastodon's distinctive mix of progressive rock and sludge metal would garner them significant praise as work would begin on a second record, produced by Matt Boyles (ISIS, Botch).[8] Mastodon would release their second album entitled Leviathan on 31 August 2004 to widespread critical acclaim. It is a concept album loosely based on Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick.[9] The album's theme would also take the elemental theme of \"Water\" while Leviathan marked the beginning of a long-standing tradition of the band in Neurosis guitarist/vocalist Scott Kelly making a guest appearance (In regards to \"Leviathan\" he appears on \"Aqua Dementia\".). With significant critical acclaim Leviathan would be named record of the year by Kerrang!,[10] Terrorizer and Revolver. Metalsucks would retroactively place it at #1 on their \"21 Best Albums of the 21st Century So Far\" in 2009.[11] \"Blood and Thunder,\" which featured Clutch vocalist Neil Fallon, was chosen as one of the most important recordings of the decade by National Public Radio in November 2009, and that the entire album epitomizes \" a phenomenal decade for metal\".[12]\n\nMastodon would tour heavily in support of Leviathan, appearing on OzzFest and touring the world for headlining dates, sharing the stage with Dozer, Cult of Luna and Converge just to scratch the surface. Overall between shows in North America, Europe and Japan, Mastodon would perform well over 250 shows in 2004 and 2005 supporting the album. On 7 February 2006 the band would release a compilation album entitled Call of The Mastodon, a re-mastered and edited collection of the band's early songs along with a DVD retrospective entitled The Workhorse Chronicles on 21 February 2006. Mastodon would also notably record a take on the Metallica song \"Orion\" for a tribute album to \"Master of Puppets\" curated by Kerrang!.[13]\n\nQuintessence: Signing to Reprise, Blood Mountain and Crack The Skye (2006 - 2010)[]\n\nCall of The Mastodon and The Workhorse Chronicles would prove to be the final two releases in the band's tenure with Relapse as they would sign to Warner Music Group, as announced in the Summer of 2005.[14] By April 2006 work had been finished on a third studio album.[15] Brann Dailor would speak about the band's changing and shifting sound in regards to this third studio album:\n\n“ \"It's hard to be inside something and talk to people about it. And it's kind of a cliché that the people in the band think that what they're working on at the moment is the best stuff they've ever done. But I guess that's the way that we feel. It's just more intense, more — I mean I like everything we've ever done. But at the moment, I'm really digging on this stuff. It's hard for me to put into words what's different about it. It's just better. I hope we can start a prog revolution, because the timing's right. You've got a Tool record that's coming out, an Isis record that's coming out, a Mars Volta record that's coming out, a Mastodon record that's coming out, and I hope that converges into something really awesome for music where it doesn't become pop, but there's a little more sharing of the pie. It would be cool if you had kids in their bedrooms not trying to learn Linkin Park songs, but they're trying to learn Mastodon songs. It's cool music that's honest and from the heart, and it's technically challenging.\" ”\n\n— Brann Dailor, MTV [16]\n\nWorking now with Warner Bros. Music and Reprise Records, Blood Mountain would be released on 12 September 2006 to high critical praise. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received a score of 82, based on 24 reviews. Total Guitar magazine voted it Number One album of 2006, and magazines such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang! thought it is every bit as good as the band's previous album Leviathan, if not better. The album has also charted in many websites and magazines 2006 countdowns. Blood Mountain was voted the best album of 2006 in the UK Metal Hammer magazine end-of year polls, as well as top in Total Guitar magazine's top 50 albums of 2006. It was also rated the 17th greatest metal album of all time by a countdown recently carried out by gaming website IGN. Blood Mountain would also be nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Metal Performance\" in 2007. By the end of the decade the album had sold over 150,000 copies, peaking at 32 on the Billboard 200 upon initial release.[17]\n\nBlood Mountain notably features cleaner, more melodic vocals in comparison to prior releases along with a further push towards progressive rock. Scott Kelly, Josh Homme and Cedric Bixler-Zavala all contribute guest vocals to the record. Throughout 2006 the band would participate in the Unholy Alliance Tour with Slipknot, Slayer and Lamb of God. Along with this major tour the band would tour heavily with some headlining dates in support of Blood Mountain and close out the year supporting Tool on the first leg of their European tour in support of 10,000 Days.

Mastodon would also perform \"Colony of Birchmen\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards with Josh Homme. After the televised performance it would be revealed that Brent Hinds was reported to have suffered a severe head injury and was hospitalized.[21] It would later be revealed that an inebriated Hinds had started a fight with System of a Down bassist Shavo Odadjian and Achozen vocalist William Hudson.[22]\n\n2008 would see the band rejoining Slayer for the third chapter of the Unholy Alliance Tour.[23] and participating in the 2008 edition of the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival. Notably in late 2008 the band would perform briefly as a trio without Kelliher as he had been hospitalized but would rejoin his bandmates in time for their appearance at All Tomorrow's Parties.[24] Work would also begin on a fourth studio album between April and September that year in Atlanta with producer Brendan O'Brien, with the new album announced by the end of 2008.[25] On 24 March 2009 the band's fourth studio album Crack The Skye would be released, peaking at 12 on the Billboard 200 and selling over 200,000 copies by September 2010, marking it as one of their highest selling albums to date.[26] Crack The Skye would mark a further progressive shift in the band's ever-evolving sound, Brann Dailor describing the album as \"more focused\" while the band themselves drew inspiration from frequent listens of King Crimson's \"In The Court of The Crimson King\" and Pink Floyd's \"Animals\".[27] Crack The Skye attained major critical praise not unlike previous records. Crack the Skye was named amongst the most well received albums of 2009 by numerous music publications. Classic Rock Magazine placed it a #3 of its 'Top Albums of 2009', while Kerrang! place it at #4 in its 'Top Albums of 2009'.

On 15 May 2009, Mastodon performed a shortened version of \"Oblivion\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. Mastodon would support Metallica on one of the European legs for their World Magnetic Tour along with participating in a tour curated by Adult Swim alongside Dethklok, Converge and High on Fire.[28] On 29 October 2009 the band performed \"Divinations\" on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\". An EP for Oblivion saw release on 4 November 2009.[29]\n\nDuring the band's 2009 tour of Europe the band would be contacted by film director Jimmy Hayward, who expressed how much listening to Blood Mountain had helped his creative process while finishing a screenplay, and he offered Mastodon a chance to score the film he had been working on in Jonah Hex, based on the DC comic book character. In an interview with Paste Magazine, Troy Sanders stated that Hayward \"called us out of the blue as a fan. It was the most beautiful, authentic way to collaborate.\"[30] Mastodon used scenes from the film as inspiration during the writing and recording process, and the instrumental soundtrack, Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly EP, was released on 29 June 2010, through Reprise Records.[31]\n\n2010 would see Mastodon further touring around the world supporting Crack The Skye, which would include the band's first shows in South America supporting Metallica, an appearance at Big Day Out in Australia and the BlackDiamondSkye tour with Alice in Chains and Deftones (A portmanteau of the three bands' latest albums in Black Gives Way To Blue, Diamond Eyes and Crack The Skye.).
