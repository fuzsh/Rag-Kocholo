Sharing a love for The Melvins and Thin Lizzy, the members of Mastodon came together in the late 90s in Atlanta, and have firmly established themselves as one of modern metal's finest, and one more than happy to draw on their prog, jazz and glam influences.\n\nDespite being caught up in the terrible events in Paris' Bataclan theatre in 2017, Eagles of Death Metal are still going strong. Fronted by Jesse Hughes, Eagles are purveyors of earwormy, knowingly over the top glam rock, and count The Queens of the Stone Age's frontman Josh Homme among their ranks (though he won't be performing on these dates). Their last album was 2015's Zipper Down. Russian Circles will also be providing support on these dates. catch them all when Mastodon hit in , , ."
