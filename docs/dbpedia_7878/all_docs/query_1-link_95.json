        "text": "Amid all the swooning over the indie-bands-for-girls at Reading this year, some of the biggest noise from the main stage came from a little-known metal group from Atlanta called Mastodon. You could tell they were really popular by the way teeth and torn-out clumps of hair kept flying out of one of the most violent moshpits I have ever seen.\n\nThe band have been bubbling under the mainstream's radar since they released an EP, Lifesblood, with highly regarded, underground, avant-garde metal label Relapse in 2001.\n\nA couple of years ago, they released Leviathan, which was widely acknowledged as an all-time classic album of the genre, and compared to the true heavyweights of rock: Metallica, Mot√∂rhead, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. It is huge news in dork-world.\n\nWhen Warner Music boss Korda Marshall noticed that his daughter had played the thing so much that his house had started to suffer structural damage, he signed the band up, and the word was that the plan was to make them 'the next Metallica'.\n\nAnd while Blood Mountain's commercial potential is nowhere near that of Metallica's breakthrough Metallica (aka 'The Black Album'), it's still going to go a long way into making them one of the biggest metal names ever.\n\nOne of the main reasons that everybody is so excited about this group's new album is that ever since Nirvana's dreary legacy of grunge permeated the metal scene, the art of 'true metal', and its unironic lyrics about scary monsters smelling like farts and beer, and masturbatory virtuoso musicianship had taken a backseat to more easily-marketable-to-idiots metal like emo-metal, nu-metal and rap-metal. You know the kind: the ones with a DJ and whose singer got abused by his dad, so the lyrics are about being bullied at school and cutting yourself. Thanks for that, lads.\n\nThe good news is Blood Mountain couldn't be more aesthetically opposed to all that drippy bullshit if it tried.\n\nRevolving mainly around the tortured, twin vocals of guitarist Brent Hinds and bassist Troy Sanders, the 12 songs on here are filled with furious, intricate guitar riffing, myriad time changes and crazed drumming patterns that wouldn't be out of place on something like Bitches Brew or a King Crimson album. In the Seventies, they would have called it prog.\n\nThe lyrics - which are all screamed - are about whales' bellies, wolves, black holes, men made of birch and 'sharks from the sky'. Imagine the scene in Lord of the Rings in which there's the big battle with the elephants and all the orcs and elves are flying everywhere killing each other, but way scarier and bloodier. It's like that, all the way through (ie, a lot of fun if you're even remotely into that kind of thing).\n\nKeen to blow the new, big recording budget on something other than extra weed, they've also hired some other guns from the other big names in metal/rock known for making interesting, prog-y noises with their guitars.\n\nEnter Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, Cedric from Mars Volta and, lesser-known but equally as big news for metallers, Scott Kelly from San Francisco's Neurosis; a sorely under-appreciated band who have replaced Swans as the manic-depressive, arty, misanthropist's heavy band of choice.\n\nAll these ingredients go to make up a truly original, innovative, heavy-as-hell, interesting heavy metal record that you can listen to more than twice without wanting to smash it to a million pieces with an axe.\n\nAnd that is a very rare thing indeed."
