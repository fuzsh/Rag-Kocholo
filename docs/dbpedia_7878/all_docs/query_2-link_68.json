        "text": "This edition of Metal Maniacs features Greg Ravengrave, the multi-instrumentalist behind Mistwalker, drummer of Ratpiss, as well as numerous other projects, and the founder of Heavy NFLD.\n\nHey folks! After doing this project for a few months thanks to the inspiration of Winterhearth frontman and guitarist Andrew Marsh I figured it was finally time for me to sit down and write about my own series of inspirational and influential records that led me to become the musician I am today. For those of you who don’t know, my name is Greg, I’m the founder of Heavy NFLD and the guy who mainly writes for this blog. I write and record everything in the black metal project Mistwalker, play drums in the crust band Ratpiss, and have umpteen-thousand other side projects besides that which span a number of different genres. With that out of the way, let’s get into it!\n\nThe Sword – Age of Winters\n\nWhen I was but a wee lad I was growing up in the town of Glovertown, which is about three hours outside of St. John’s, in the Gander area. I grew up in a pretty strict Christian conservative household where my family did everything in their power to shelter me from the outside world. In all honesty, it was pretty fucked. Thankfully we eventually got the internet. At this time in my life I was pretty heavy into gaming and I was obsessed with the PS2 video game Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. One day I was browsing YouTube and found a trailer for the game’s sequel, Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. The song used in that trailer? “Iron Swan” by The Sword. The heaviness, aggression and insanity of the instrumentation in that song was unlike anything I’d ever heard before. Coupled with visuals of vast swathes of Venezuelan jungle being burned to the ground and tanks and attack helicopters blowing shit up, it kicked my ass. From that moment I was hooked and needed more. Thankfully the rest of this record, including such classics as “Freya” and “Winter’s Wolves”, had plenty more megalithic riffage to offer my adolescent brain.\n\nSlipknot – Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\n\nWhile The Sword was my gateway drug into metal, it wasn’t until Slipknot came across my ears that I delved fully into my nu metal cringelord phase. I first heard “Before I Forget” on Guitar Hero III as a teenager and, in all honesty, it didn’t quite click with me. However, when I eventually came across the song “Duality” on YouTube I was hooked. The rest of the album was like a drug, from the absurdly heavy and chaotic early tracks like “The Blister Exists” to the absolute banger that is “Pulse of the Maggots”, this album was exactly what my miserable, angst-filled teenage brain needed. Even the quieter, more solemn songs on this album, like “Circle”, “Vermilion”, and “Vermilion Part 2” hit me right in the feels. From this record I would eventually branch out into the rest of Slipknot’s discography and became a die-hard Maggot.\n\nJudas Priest – Painkiller\n\nAround the same time that Guitar Hero started to fall off as a franchise, Rock Band came in to absolutely dominate the rhythm game market, and me, along with many of my friends, became obsessed. Towards the end of high school we used to host Rock Band parties on a pretty regular basis, and I can even credit the game with being how I first learned how to play drums. When Rock Band 2 came out near the end of the 2000’s I ate up the amount of metal tracks that had been included on the game’s disc at release, including Judas Priest’s “Painkiller”. I was blown away by the sheer sonic assault of the drum into. I had never heard anything quite like it. I was obsessed and immediately went to listen to the rest of the record. I remember having the thought, “this is fucking metal, man”. For real, if an alien visited Earth and asked me to define heavy metal I would play this album. Every single song on this thing is an unabashed banger. This is one of the few records in existence I would say is an 11/10, and to this day it remains in fairly constant rotation on whatever device I’m using to listen to music.\n\nMastodon – Crack the Skye\n\nSimilarly to Judas Priest, I also discovered Mastodon through Rock Band 2 thanks to the inclusion of “Colony of Birchmen”. At the time, however, that song didn’t quite click with me. Luckily it was only about a year later when the band would drop one of the most critically lauded records of their career. Crack the Skye came to me at exactly the right moment in my life. It was dirty and dark but was incredibly complex. This album introduced me to progressive metal but also encouraged me to push my drumming skills to the next level. Brann Dailor is an absolute monster on this record and I spent many hours in the rec room of my parent’s house trying to nail this entire album behind the kit.\n\nBetween the Buried and Me – Colors\n\nYet another artist discovered through Rock Band 2, albeit this time through the game’s downloadable content. “Prequel to the Sequel” was my first exposure to progressive metal of this stripe. The guitar playing on that song is on another level and the sheer complexity of the track as it twists and morphs into so many different areas still boggles my mind to this day. When listening to the full record it’s clear that Colors is in a class all on its own when it comes to contemporary progressive metal. Aside from showing me just what was capable within the framework of the “metal” genre, this band also got me into harsh vocals. There was a long time where I didn’t like screaming, no matter if it was the ultra low gutturals of a band like Cannibal Corpse or the higher pitched snarl of metalcore bands, I wasn’t into it. I could only tolerate Slipknot because for some reason in my adolescent mind Corey Taylor’s yelling wasn’t the same as a straight up death metal scream (don’t ask how I justified that, because I wouldn’t remember). But once I got into Between the Buried and Me I really understood just why harsh vocals were so appealing to people, and from then on I was sold.\n\nDevin Townsend Project – Addicted\n\nThis was my introduction to Devin Townsend, an artist who has arguably had the most effect on my life as a musician, at least from a work ethic perspective. Addicted, like many of the other records on this list, came to me at the perfect moment in my life. It melded heavy guitars with a 100% pop aesthetic, fusing heaviness with absurdly catchy bubblegum melodies, and it was like a sonic version of crack to my ears. I couldn’t get enough of it. It was this album that made me realize that no matter how complex or impressive the musicianship on any given record is, what really matters to me as a musician is if your songs are memorable, and so I started putting a lot of focus into trying to craft catchy hooks over anything else. Granted, I wasn’t actually recording my own music at this point (around 2009/2010-ish), but it greatly influenced the music I did end up working on in the coming decade. Aside from that, the sheer amount of music that Townsend put out around this time wound up having more of an effect on me than the music itself did. How he was able to put out so much material so quickly, most of which was pretty damn good, astounded me, and I aspired to try and live up to that as much as possible with my own works.\n\nSikTh – Death of a Dead Day\n\nThe first time I heard “Bland Street Bloom” by these UK tech metal legends I was blown away. If Between the Buried and Me opened my mind to what was capable of being played on guitar, and Devin Townsend showed me that prog and metal can still be catchy and poppy without sacrificing heaviness, SikTh showed me that you can maintain both of those qualities while also being insane. No doubt a huge influence on the djent scene that emerged in the 2010’s, none of the bands that followed in SikTh’s footsteps could ever really hold a candle to these guys. Sure, I love Meshuggah as much as the next guy, and they undoubtedly started the style, but SikTh has a special flavour that nobody could ever really match. As much as I love groups like Periphery and Tesseract and Born of Osiris, SikTh is the gold standard for technical and progressive metal, and this album is the pinnacle of that. To this day I’m still mesmerized by the guitar and drum work on this thing and I can only hope to one day be able to even come close to what is performed on this record.\n\nStolen Babies – There Be Squabbles Ahead\n\nI was never quite a goth kid when I was in high school but I always kind of wanted to be. There was definitely an appeal to the aesthetic presented by what is considered typical “goth” media like The Nightmare Before Christmas or My Chemical Romance, but given the oppressive nature of high school in small town Newfoundland I never really went full tilt, so to speak. Musically I wouldn’t even end up getting into actual, honest to Satan, goth rock until recently. Back in high school I found myself drawn more to avant garde metal, which, in my opinion, is usually just a fancy way of saying carnival musical with distorted guitars. Stolen Babies were my entryway to that world, and to this day I don’t think any band has quite managed to capture the feeling that their debut record, There Be Squabbles Ahead, has. I remember hearing one song from these guys on YouTube and being unable to find the rest of the record anywhere, save on a torrent site, so I let the album download over the course of a week and when I finally got to listen to it I was enthralled by what I heard. It’s fair to say that this record has influenced my own music to a degree, especially when it comes to some of the Halloween-themed releases I’ve dropped as Mistwalker (namely Of Pumpkins and Pinecones). And yes, before you ask, I did end up buying the album. I own a CD copy of it at my parents’ place in Glovertown.\n\nAmon Amarth – Twilight of the Thunder God\n\nThis one probably doesn’t come as much surprise to anyone. The band’s most popular and critically acclaimed record, Twilight of the Thunder God is remembered fondly for a reason. This album is another 11/10 for me. Every track on here is so flawless both with their songwriting capability and memorability. Every song on this album is memorable and stands apart from the others on the record with their own individual flavour and uniqueness. This was probably the first death metal record I ever full enjoyed, this or At the Gates’ Slaughter of the Soul. However, it was this album’s (and band’s) Viking themes that drew me. It was around this time (2011-2013) that I became very interested in Norse mythology and Viking history, and this record was my gateway to that. The riffs and the vocals are so powerful that nary a melodeath record has risen to accomplish what this album has. It was this record that led to me incorporating occasional themes of paganism and Norse myth in my own music when I officially started recording under the name of Mistwalker in 2013.\n\nDarkthrone – F.O.A.D.\n\nIt was when I was in college (from 2012-2014) that I met my Kristopher Crane (from the projects Nemophilist and Acorn to Great Oak and also from the bands Impaled Upon the Mountains and Grimacing, which we formed together) who introduced me to black metal. I was aware of black metal before college but it never quite clicked with me. Once I was a bit older and felt a bit more depressed in my adult life I think that’s when I fully got it. The album that really did it for me was F.O.A.D. by Darkthrone, which Kris had introduced me to. Songs like “Canadian Metal”, “The Church of Real Metal”, and “Raised on Rock” just hit me right in the gut. To this day Darkthrone is the band that has inspired me the most as a musician, particularly in terms of style. Their mixture of black metal with old school heavy metal and crust punk (particularly their 2000’s era) and even the doom metal they’re doing these days is exactly the kind of music I want to create.\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nAt the Gates – Slaughter of the Soul\n\nBaroness – Red Album\n\nThe Black Dahlia Murder – Nocturnal\n\nDarkthrone – Transilvanian Hunger\n\nDiablo Swing Orchestra – The Butcher’s Ballroom\n\nEquilibrium – Sagas\n\nHigh on Fire – Death is this Communion\n\nThe Human Abstract – Digital Veil\n\nJudas Priest – Screaming for Vengeance\n\nKylesa – Static Tensions\n\nMastodon – Leviathan\n\nPeriphery – Periphery\n\nSlipknot – All Hope is Gone\n\nWhitechapel – A New Era of Corruption\n\n~ Akhenaten\n\nFor this week’s installment of Metal Maniacs we have Criss Rogers! Criss is a former member of the groove / death metal band Sludgefist, a member of the new band The Mill, and is also a solo artist who performs under the name CR. Read on to discover his list of ten albums that influenced and inspired his musical journey!\n\nHey, what’s up everybody? CR here, giving y’all a rundown on the ten records that shaped my musical journey. I take great pride in having my list published amongst those of local titans of metal and punk, and it’s good to represent the West Coast in this thing, not just Town. Also, big thanks to Mr. Ravengrave himself for the opportunity to pay it forward to all the legends that have inspired me over the years. Also, I tried not to retroactively curate the list to make myself seem cooler than I actually was. And so, without further ado, I give you… the candy lineup:\n\nNirvana – MTV Unplugged in New York\n\nThis is ground zero for my guitar playing. Nirvana was the biggest band in the world, and this album proved that you could take the raw power of a punk trio and distill it through organic acoustic arrangements to create something that felt intimate and truly special. When I was 12, I started taking guitar lessons (R.I.P. Tommy Murphy) and learned every song from this album (my first experience tuning a guitar to E-flat – a practice I still adopt to this day) and would strum and scream along with Kurt “the whole night through” for years. Absolute classic performance, start to finish.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Oh Me”\n\n“About a Girl”\n\n“Where Did You Sleep Last Night?”\n\n“Polly”\n\nCarcass – Surgical Steel\n\nDon’t call it a comeback! But seriously, this is one of the greatest comeback records ever, by a criminally underrated band that has innovated, influenced, evolved and survived for decades. Packed with more gut-churning riffs, whiplash speed and buttery, fluid guitar solos than most bands can muster over a career, guitarist Bill Steer (the handsomest man in all of metal), bassist / vocalist Jeff Walker (the ugliest man in all of metal) and company offered up something brutal, beautiful and triumphant with Surgical Steel. 1994’s Heartwork may be the genre-defining fan favourite, but Surgical Steel is a massive return to form: the undisputed kings of melodic grindcore once again ascending their gore-covered throne.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Captive Bolt Pistol”\n\n“Thrasher’s Abbatoir”\n\n“The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills”\n\n“The Master Butcher’s Apron”\n\nDanzig – Danzig II: Lucifuge\n\nThe best album from my favourite singer. I love everything Danzig’s ever done: Misfits, Samhain, his Black Aria classical albums, the works. But for my money, Lucifuge is his finest moment. Every song has a different sound with that ever-present theme of Danzig’s patented brand of darkness and iconic Elvis-meets-Jim Morrison crooning threaded throughout. From the rip-roaring opener “Long Way Back From Hell” to the Howlin’ Wolf-esque acoustic braggin’ blues of “I’m the One” to the torch song ballad “Blood & Tears”, this is a record I still put on at least once a month and never grow bored with it.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Tired of Being Alive”\n\n“Snakes of Christ”\n\n“Killer Wolf”\n\n“Her Black Wings”\n\nNOFX – Punk in Drublic\n\nDespite what Ring of Honor, WWE or AEW fans would attest, for kids of my generation the real Summer of Punk was 1994, with bands like Green Day, The Offspring and Rancid (dude, I was so tempted to put Dookie, Smash and …And Out Come The Wolves on this list) all making major mainstream strides to connect lame suburban kids (like me) with punk rock. NOFX were the first “real” punk band I discovered on my own, picking up this CD at random and within 15 seconds of “Linoleum”, I was already down the rabbit hole. Fat Mike’s songwriting and bass playing (another criminally underrated talent) are stellar, Smelly’s drums are like an impeccable clockwork jackhammer, and the guitar playing of El Hefe and Erik Melvin continue to influence me to this day, a fact I barely managed to stammer out, totally startstruck, when I met Melvin in 2015. Also major thanks to this record for introducing me to the incomparable Kim Shattuck of the Muffs who does the unforgettable guest vocals on “Lori Myers”.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Dig”\n\n“Lori Myers”\n\n“Reeko”\n\n“Fleas”\n\n“Jeff Don’t Wear Birkenstocks”\n\n“Punk Guy”\n\nType O Negative – October Rust\n\nMy absolute favourite album by my absolute favourite band. Type O Negative – specifically bassist / vocalist / songwriter Peter Steele – speak to me as no other artist does. Combining the heaviest of Sabbath-inspired metal with the psychedelic pop of late-era Beatles and Lush, Gothic atmosphere of The Cure (damn, I should’ve included them on this list too…) with an ultra-black deadpan sense of humour, it feels like Type O’s music was written for me. This record is particularly awesome, with hits like “Love You To Death”, “My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend” and “Cinnamon Girl”. Also: “Be My Druidess” features THE HUGEST BASS TONE OF ALL TIME. Seriously b’ys, it’s like a dump truck going through a nitroglycerin plant.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Be My Druidess”\n\n“Wolf Moon”\n\n“Burnt Flowers Fallen”\n\n“Die With You”\n\nMisfits – Famous Monsters\n\nI know, I know. How DARE I include a Graves-era Misfits record on a list with Danzig? Because I go where eagles dare (and I ain’t no goddamn son of a bitch), and this record is simply awesome. Look, I know that today Michale Graves is a Proud Boy P.O.S. and should be ridiculed and shunned from civilized society for his tone-deaf idiocy. But that doesn’t make his performance on this record 20+ years ago any less amazing (even though my wife pointed out he sounds just like Stephen Page from Barenaked Ladies and now I can’t unhear it – thanks, D!). Doyle’s guitar has never sounded so massive and menacing, and this has some of the best singalong choruses of the entire Misfits catalog (“Dust to Dust”, “Die Monster Die” and “Fiend Club” immediately spring to mind). I was born in ’81, so the real Misfits were pretty much done by the time I came around. This record came out when I was 17, and it felt like my Misfits, a phenomenon that I got to enjoy in real time. At this point, I do need to mention the best tune on the record, the 50’s-esque ballad “Saturday Night”, a favourite in my house and a tune my wife and I finally got to dance to – thanks to Danielle Trouble & the Dinosaurs – the last time we were in St. John’s.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Saturday Night”\n\n“Forbidden Zone”\n\n“Living Hell”\n\n“Scream”\n\n“Them!”\n\nPantera – Vulgar Display of Power\n\nDimebag Darrell was my hero. A righteous dude of the highest order, full of the most love, most positivity and most balls in all of metal – or “heavy shit” as Darrell would put it. A fearless explorer and innovator, a monster riffer, and in my book the greatest lead guitarist the world has ever seen (GETCHER PULL!). Vulgar is my favourite Pantera album and it sounds like a greatest hits collection just listing the tracks in order – “Mouth For War”, “A New Level”, “Walk”, “Fucking Hostile”, “This Love”, and that’s just the first five songs! Gotta give it up for Dime’s brother Vinnie Paul on the skins, the ever-underrated Rex Brown on bass and of course, the meanest mug in metal, Phil Anselmo, who’s in rare form here both vocally and lyrically (“Rise” and “No Good” are so timely they could have been written in 2020). Without question, one of the best metal records of the ‘90s. Fight me.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Mouth for War”\n\n“Regular People (Conceit)”\n\n“Rise”\n\n“Fucking Hostile”\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience – Electric Ladyland\n\nHendrix’s final record was his peak. He came on like a comet; an overnight sensation and his music and style influenced everything that came after. It’s no coincidence that my first electric guitar was a Strat (although, that may have more to do with Wayne’s World than Hendrix…). This was Jimi at his most focused and concise – “All Along The Watchtower”, “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” and “Crosstown Traffic” – and also his most chaotic and experimental: the bad-trip soundscape of “…And The Gods Made Love”, the ethereal “1983 – A Merman I Should Turn To Be” and of course the ultra-dank extended “Voodoo Child” jam. A moody, bluesy, trippy, satisfying blaze of glory.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Voodoo Child (Slight Return)”\n\n“Little Miss Strange”\n\n“House Burning Down”\n\n“Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)”\n\nNine Inch Nails – Broken\n\nThis record demonstrated Trent Reznor’s uncanny ability to blend heavier-than-heavy layers of guitars with breakneck electronic beats to culminate in an album that still today seethes with fury, self-loathing and heartbreak. To those of us steeped in NIN lore, Broken is the in-between of what came before – 1989’s Pretty Hate Machine – and what was to come: 1994’s masterpiece The Downward Spiral. A dark and necessary step in Nine Inch Nails’ evolution from frivolous Goth-dance to anthems of a tortured soul. P.S. I lost my virginity to this record, and you never forget your first.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Gave Up”\n\n“Last”\n\n“Physical”\n\n“Wish”\n\nAlkaline Trio – Good Mourning\n\nFull Disclosure: by 2003 I had all but given up on punk rock, metal and music in general. My mental health was at an all-time low. I was heavily medicated and in continuous therapy. I was bland, boring and middle-of-the-road. As a result, most of the music I was writing and listening to was also bland, boring and middle-of-the-road. Until I read a year-end roundup in Rolling Stone that listed Good Mourning by Alkaline Trio as one of the top picks of the year. On a whim, I got the record (bought for me in Toronto by the legendary Gary Graham) and I was taken aback: here were these three little Satanic punk kids making some of the coolest, catchiest tunes I’d heard in years. The opening track “This Could Be Love” could not be more apropos as I became an instant die-hard and remain so to this day. Equal parts melodic and melancholic with dark and sometimes hilarious lyricism, Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano double-handedly restored my faith in music and myself with this album. Within weeks I began writing meaningful songs again, quit the pharmaceuticals, shook off the victim blanket, and the joy and passion returned to my life. I owe the Alkaline Trio everything from that moment forward.\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Fatally Yours”\n\n“Blue in the Face”\n\n“Emma”\n\n“This Could Be Yours”\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nDoughboys – Crush\n\nTori Amos – Boys For Pele\n\nDimmu Borgir – In Sorte Diaboli\n\nGWAR – Ragnarok\n\nPortishead – Dummy\n\nRamones – Ramones\n\n~ Written by Criss Rogers\n\n~ Edited by Akhenaten"
