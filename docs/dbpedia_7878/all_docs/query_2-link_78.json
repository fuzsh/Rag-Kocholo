        "text": "It’s that time of year again. Where we are all plagued by the year end lists. This blog is no different. Now I didn’t get to listen to everything that I wanted to this year (sorry, Opeth) but I still was able to compile a list of some great pieces of work that emerged these past 12 months. So without further ado, here’s my personal favorite 50 albums of 2016.\n\n50. Flatbush Zombies – 3001: A Laced Oddessy\n\nFlatbush Zombies have been proving over the last couple of years that they are straight up insane. They have a take no prisoners style, and this album definitely proves that.\n\n49. Frank Ocean – Blond\n\nOut of the spotlight for the past couple of years, Frank Ocean had fans on the verge of tears waiting for him to come back. However instead of releasing Channel Orange Part Two, he went in an entirely different direction. Some were a little too jarred by the change, while others embraced it with open arms (er…ears?)\n\n48. Yeasayer – Amen & Goodbye\n\nThe always delightfully mystifying Yeasayer returned this year with an album that was like a roller coaster. Not because of a go-go-go-go type of sound, but more because it really goes all over the place. It’s not an album that sits still for a moment to let you catch up, you need to be able to keep pace with it.\n\n47. Czarface – A Fistful of Peril\n\nCzarface returned yet again this after their great release from last year, Every Hero Needs a Villain. However this album doesn’t contain what made the last one so special. There’s something lacking there. But the fact is that these guys are all talented, and together will still make something solid.\n\n46. Ab-Soul – Do What Thou Wilt\n\nThe TDE label is starting to look more like the ’96 Bulls lineup as time goes on. Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock and of course Ab-Soul are the staggering starting lineup. I was looking forward to hearing a new album from him but there’s something lacking here for sure. I could chalk it up to high expectations because of his label mates, but it’s definitely missing something. All around though there are still some pretty decent tracks on here that can make you come on back.\n\n45. Grouplove – Big Mess\n\nI’m a big fan of Grouplove’s first album, Never Trust a Happy Song. In my opinion their albums that have come out since then have declined a bit. That being said, it says a lot about that first album since this release was still pretty good. A little too close to sounding like Foster the People for my liking, but still very enjoyable.\n\n44. Dinosaur Jr. – Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not\n\nDad rockers unite. Dinosaur Jr. has still got it. Crunching guitar riffs blended with harmonious melodies make for another good addition to their already highly impressive discography.\n\n43. Phantogram – Three\n\nAs the title states, this is the third album from duo Phantogram. It’s their first release since hooking up with rapper Big Boi for the Big Grams project, and it feels like they picked up some interesting lessons after that collaboration. Not to say that it sounds like a hip-hop project, but they’re clearly experimenting a bit more these days.\n\n42. Romare – Love Songs: Part Two\n\nIf you’re looking for some smooth, fun and danceable? Look no more. You won’t find any bangers on here, but you will find some great tracks to vibe to and tap your foot to repeatedly.\n\n41. Empire of the Sun – Two Vines\n\nThere was a long delay between Empire of the Suns’ first and second albums. However the length of time between the second and third were much shorter. The issue with Two Vines is that it’s a little too similar to Ice on the Dune. A little more time apart could’ve helped the artistic vision progress a little bit more, but overall it’s still a nice piece of work.\n\n40. The Weeknd – Starboy\n\nNow I’m not one to usually listen to the Weeknd since his vocals are a little too clean for me personally. But I don’t think that there’s been a pop album where every song delivers like this since a Michael Jackson album came out. Put this one on at a party and see what happens. If I was more into pop music in general, this would probably be much higher.\n\n39. Denzel Curry – Empire\n\nThis is basically a banger of a rap record. This feels like an album that hip-hop heads across the board can get into, whether they’re Killer Mike or Wiz Khalifa fans.\n\n38. M83 – Junk\n\nThe cute album cover matches up with the sound on this album wonderfully. Very dreamy sounding and everything has the feel of a child experiencing what life has to offer for the first time.\n\n37. M.I.A. – AIM\n\nM.I.A. has a weird track record. She’ll come out with one good album, then one bad album and basically keep that pattern up. I loved her last album, so I was feeling like I was being lured into a trap with this one. Though not as strong as Matangi or Kala, it’s still a good addition to her work. I had no issues with this one and enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\n36. Haken – Affinity\n\nI’m a big fan or progressive hard rock and metal. Haken are like a lighter version of Between the Buried and Me. They’re able to build some incredible soundscapes and bring the listener on a wild ride. Don’t sleep on this one if you’re into the heavy stuff.\n\n35. Justice – Woman\n\nAfter Justice’s middling sophomore effort of Audio, Video, Disco, I was thinking that maybe Justice wasn’t made for the 2010s. They were a big part of the EDM craze of the second half of the ’00s, but have been a little irrelevant since Cross came out back in 2007. Woman embraces the past, yet looks to the future. It’s similar to how Daft Punk incorporated live instrumentation into their last album. Aside from rolling my eyes a bit with how similar they try to be to Daft Punk, they still released something special with this one.\n\n34. Weezer – The White Album\n\nI’m one of those guys that only really likes Weezer’s Blue Album and maybe a couple of singles here and there, so I was pretty skeptical that I was going to enjoy this release. I can definitely say without a doubt that this is Weezer’s best release since their first album. A return to form from the veterans of the alternative rock scene.\n\n33. The Heavy – The Hurt & The Merciless\n\nThe Heavy are quickly becoming one of the most consistent bands around the past couple of years. With each release I grow more confident that it will always be good. It doesn’t need to be amazing, but just good. They have an old school approach in a new school atmosphere, so there’s lots here to enjoy.\n\n32. Digitalism – Mirage\n\nThough the EDM craze is beginning to faze out a little bit (it may not seem like it but trust me, I called that EDM would be all over pop music before it happened) but Digitalism have been making their lush beats for years now, with each release giving something different. I feel that this could actually be their best album, which is saying a lot since their first release, Idealism, was such a big deal in the scene.\n\n31. Animals as Leaders – The Madness of Many\n\nI know exactly what I’m getting when I listen to a new Animals as Leaders album: impressive sequences and WTF How did they do that instrumentation. Chalk it up as another W for these guys.\n\n30. Kemba – Negus\n\nRecently, Kendrick Lamar had Kemba come on stage during a concert in New York to spit out a verse. He basically blew the minds of those in attendance with his skill to come up with amazing lines that are truer than anything out there right now. If you’re looking for a lyrically outstanding hip-hop album, you’ve found it.\n\n29. Two Door Cinema Club – Gameshow\n\nThese guys are always a lot of fun. With each release you get another high energy, danceable and rocking piece of work. This continues the trend and fits in with their past work perfectly.\n\n28. DJ Shadow – The Mountain Will Fall\n\nOne of the hottest collaborations of the year was from this album, the smash hit “Nobody Speak” featuring Run the Jewels elevated the hype for this album to new heights. DJ Shadow embraced using new tools on this album, showing that he’s evolving with the times and not being left behind. An album full of lush beats makes for one of the years best albums to vibe to.\n\n27. Tricia Fitz – The Storm\n\nBrazil’s own Tricia Fitz continues her rise from obscurity and is starting to get people to notice the immense talent that she’s capable of. The Storm was a huge step in the right direction for her, as tracks like “Electromagnetic” and “Waiting It Out” showcase the simmering potential that is going to shortly be unleashed upon the world. Be prepared.\n\n26. BADBADNOTGOOD – IV\n\nHailing from Toronto, the young jazz quartet started making noise in the scene when they were being recognized for their excellent covers of hip-hop classics (such as Brooklyn Zoo, The World is Yours, Flashing Lights). However they took a big step this year with the release of their fourth album. Now having established themselves in the scene, they took a big chance this year and made something that not only highlights their impressive musicianship, but shows that they can handle doing things a little differently.\n\n25. D.R.A.M – Big Baby DRAM\n\nThere was some serious hype for D.R.A.M. coming into this year. Many wondered if he’d actually be able to live up to the expectations. Well wonder no more, because he definitely crushed it with this one. He made a unique blend of R&B and rap on this record, and came off as an artist who just wants to have a good time and be friends with everybody.\n\n24. Danny Brown – Atrocity Exhibition\n\nOkay. So this is an interesting one. This album could have been wayyyy higher on this list. It also could have been way lower. This is one of the most Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde albums I have ever listened to. There are some seriously great tracks on here, but then there are some that leave me trying to claw my ears out. But the good tracks are so enjoyable, that it carries it all the way to number 24.\n\n23. Steven Wilson – 4 1/2\n\nThe head of Porcupine Tree, Steven Wilson proves that he doesn’t need his band to make some bad ass music. This was one of the best rock albums to come out all year. The songs have a sense of progression and each track has a reason to be there. If you’re looking for something to pump out the jams to, look no further.\n\n22. David Bowie – Blackstar\n\nWhat else can really be said that hasn’t already been said about the late, great David Bowie? In case you’re interested, here’s what I had to say about his legacy when he passed away. Blackstar is no ordinary piece of music. It’s a farewell to his friends, family and fans. He knew going into the studio that he was on borrowed time and had to express himself one last time. An emotional and heartbreaking album, that still inspires a sense of wonder about the delicate balance of life and death.\n\n21. Chance the Rapper – Colouring Book\n\nOne of the hottest hip-hop acts out there right now, Chance the Rapper is making sure that everybody takes note and remembers him. Whether it’s guesting on Kanye’s album, showing up on SNL or releasing free music just in time for the holidays, it looks like he’s here to stay. My expectations were a little unfairly high for this one since I absolutely loved Acid Rap, so I definitely did feel a little disappointed at first. Colouring Book shows that he has more than bars to spit, and can handle gospel and R&B as well. A unique artist who is on the verge of greatness deserves to be in your music rotation.\n\n20. Protest the Hero – Pacific Myth\n\nCanadian prog-metal band Protest the Hero have returned with their best album since Fortress. It’s only a 6 track album, but it definitely doesn’t feel that way. The sonic rythms will lead you to new heights and the impressive vocals will have you pressing Play as soon as this one ends.\n\n19. Radiohead – A Moon Shaped Pool\n\nThe thing about Radiohead is that even when they don’t release an album as good as most of their rest, it’s still going to have something truly unique about it that separates it from their competitors. Expect the unexpected when you throw this one on.\n\n18. Too Many Zooz – Subway Gawdz\n\nBrass is back in a huge way. Too Many Zooz got their name out there by performing for free in the subways of New York City. Armed with a trumpet, saxophone and a myriad of percussion drums, the trio came up big in a huge way this year with their first full length album. The best way to describe their sound is to call it brasshouse. Music made with the classic instruments that make something that sounds more like it was made with a DJ. Get ready to move.\n\n17. Isaiah Rashad – The Sun’s Tirade\n\nAnother TDE label release that made hip-hop heads weak in the knees. An incredibly consistent album that stays smooth the whole time you have it on. Great rhymes matched with laid back beats make for a good time.\n\n16. Anderson .Paak – Malibu\n\nHas anyone had a year like Anderson .Paak? He has been absolutely dominating these past 12 months. If he’s not appearing on almost everybody’s releases, he’s coming out with his own unique music. Saying that Malibu is a hip-hop feels like an understatement, since the sound is so rich and full of various soundscapes. It’s funky, it’s fresh, it’s Anderson .Paak.\n\n15. The Avalanches – Wildflower\n\nIt’s been 16 years since The Avalanches have released any new music. But the timing was finally right, and we finally all got to hear what a new record of theirs would sound like. Not only is it a great album that lives up to the expectations of the first album, but it also comes across as its own unique piece instead of a retread of what made them successful in the first place. Top form, Avalanches, top form.\n\n14. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – Nonagon Infinity\n\nIt’s not surprising that the group with the best band name also has one of the most enjoyable rock albums of the year. Frenzy filled and ready to bring about the apocalypse with their in your face sound, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard should be on every hard rock fans radar.\n\n13. Iggy Pop – Post Pop Depression\n\nWhen I first heard that Iggy Pop was releasing an album this year, I thought that was cool – in a casual way. But then I heard that Josh Homme and Dean Fertita were going to be part of the project, and I couldn’t be more intrigued. What emerged from this project was a showcase of old blood meets new blood. The band take his cues and create a sound that perfectly captures the essence of what Iggy Pop is all about. Iggy Pop and Josh Homme are match made in desert rock heaven.\n\n12. Schoolboy Q – The Blankface LP\n\nSchoolboy Q came back with avengeance this year with The Blankface LP. He went all in on this one and it shows. Every track on here goes hard, which is what’s needed for something this gangster. I mean this is a real cold, hard album. Every beat on here is relentless and smothers you. Not for the faint of heart.\n\n11. J Cole – For Your Eyez Only\n\nJ Cole announced a week before the release that we would be treated to a new album. It’s a 9 track concept album that tells the story of a friend of his that was murdered and left behind a loving family, while also dealing with the consequences of being a black man in America. Don’t go into this one expecting a banger. This is an album that rewards repeat listening, because it’s all about the lyrics with this one.\n\n10. The Game – 1992\n\nIs anyone in music working as hard as The Game is these days? The guy is on a roll lately, releasing multiple solid records these past two years. 1992 takes us back to that year and we hear the struggles, pop culture and lifestyles of that time. It feels nostalgic, yet still vital to the issues we face today. Kind of a “the more things change, the more they stay the same” type of thing. Banging beats and lyrical slaying can be found on this one. Just because The Game was in G-Unit 10 years ago doesn’t mean you should sleep on him.\n\n9. Kaytranada – 99.9%\n\nMontreal’s own Kaytranada made a huge impact this year when he dropped 99.9%. Winning the Polaris Music Award for Best Canadian Album of the year says a lot, considering he was mostly an unknown going into the year. It’s an electronic album that has elements of hip-hop and even has some great features (see: Anderson .Paak). It’s a unique record that has people buzzing.\n\n8. Ty Segall – Emotional Mugger\n\nThe freakout master Ty Segall returns yet again with another jam of an album. Relentless and unforgivingly weird, Emotional Mugger drives is constantly testing the listener to see how much they can take. His hysteric shrieking combats the high energy tempo of the thumping rhythm, leaving you in submission.\n\n7. Childish Gambino – “Awaken, My Love!”\n\nDon’t be fooled, this isn’t your typical Childish Gambino album. It’s actually more like a Sly and the Family Stone meets Parliament-Funkadelic project. Gone are the abrasive bars that Gambino is known for and instead we are treated to a full out funk freak out. It definitely soured some long time fans that were expecting a rap record, but I truly appreciate the fact that he’s keeping things interesting and making sure that we’re all on our toes.\n\n6. Kanye West – The Life of Pablo\n\nThis was probably the absolute worst release of an album I have ever witnessed before. The multiple album name changes, the cover being switched every other day, making it Tidal exclusive for a while, and even editing the songs and re releasing it when he was happy with it. In a weird way it’s perfect, because the entire project is very scatterbrained. However this was a return to form for Kanye despite everything. Will we ever get the College Dropout Kanye? No. But I’m okay with this Kanye (musically) – for now at least.\n\n5. Devin Townsend Project – Transcendence\n\nThe Frank Zappa of metal returns again with Transcendence, an album that embraces his past sound, yet looks forward. Honestly, the best way to describe what this album sounds like is bascally, something that gods would listen to. The sound is huge and swallows you whole, making you feel so small in the best way possible. The word epic is thrown around a lot these days, but it definitely applies here. Boy does it ever.\n\n4. Nxworries – Yes Lawd!\n\nAnderson .Paak returns on this list with a collaboration project with producer Knxlwledge. The album title is appropriate, because you will definitely be shouting the much used phrase along with .Paak throughout the album. If you’re any sort of fan of the Stones Throw record label, you’ll absolutely love the production. Especially since it’s matched with the smooth work of Anderson .Paak.\n\n3. A Tribe Called Quest – We’ve Got it From Here…Thank You 4 Your Service\n\nThis album was a long time coming. Unfortunately it’s the final Tribe album since Phife Dawg passed away – R.I.P. Before his untimely passing, the group got together and felt that the time was right to return. Though Phife is no longer with us, he’s all over this album. Hearing him and Q-Tip do what they do best after so many years is an absolute pleasure. Nostalgia aside, this album definitely stands on its own as a great album from the group. The only downside to me is that the track Kids has a wack beat and kind of wastes Andre 3000s contribution. That small blemish aside, this is fantastic work. Busta Rhymes, Jack White, Elton John and Kendrick Lamar offer their talents as well to great effect. Long live the tribe.\n\n2. Mac Miller – The Divine Feminine\n\nI don’t remember the last time that I’ve been this caught off guard by an album. I was never a “fan” of Mac Miller but anytime he released an album I’d give it a listen. Usually it was alright and I wouldn’t ever really go back to it. So I approached this album thinking, “eh, I’ll give it a listen and see how it is”. Never did I think it would actually end up being one of my favorite albums of the year. I was so blown away by how smooth, funky and sexy this record was. It’s very sexual, so it’s possible it could deter some listeners, but if not, then you can enjoy the ride that is The Divine Feminine. It’s definitely made me look forward to whatever he does next.\n\n1. Kendrick Lamar – untitled, unmastered\n\nI don’t know how this guy does it. I really don’t. Every release Kendrick Lamar has done has been incredible and each one continues to push the envelope. It says a lot about how far ahead he is compared to the rest of the hip-hop world when he releases what is essentially a B-sides project and it’s still better than everything else out there. It experiments with jazz and funk, progressing the legacy of this artist. And the lyrics? Oh jesus, don’t even get me started. He’s already in the conversation for the greatest rappers of all time. I have to admit that I’m super greedy and I need more and more of his work. Let’s see what 2017 has in store.\n\nSo that’s my top 50 albums of 2016! What do you think? Agree? Disagree? What albums did you love the most from this past year? What was I missing? Let me know, I’d love to have discussion. Until then, all the best in 2017. Happy holidays!\n\nHello all.\n\nSo I’m sure that it’s been noticed (let’s be real, probably not) that I haven’t exactly been updating this blog at all lately. Well, there’s actually a reason for that. No I didn’t just abandon the blog because I got bored of it. The blog actually fulfilled it’s purpose – to get me to be creative and write again.\n\nFor the longest time I haven’t been sure of what I’m going to be doing with my life. I never really knew what I wanted to do, school didn’t make that clear for me when I was younger. I was always assured while I was in high school and college that I’d figure it out real soon. I graduated from college 5 years ago, and I’m only finding myself answering my own questions just now. When I look around at those close to me I see what they want to do with their lives, and I feel slightly jealous to see them able to pursue it – but always happy to see it at the same time. I see people around me choosing to be psychologists, lawyers, nurses, journalists, helping those less fortunate and other wonderful careers.\n\nThen I see some of my other friends pursue not careers, but their passions. Whether it’s being a cartoonist, a standup comedian, a musician, photographer, filmmaker, or just moving out west to find the next adventure. I feel so inspired to see these people try to find their way in the world on their own terms. The difference between passions and careers is that there’s no amount of schooling that will land you a career in your passions – you have to rely on your own hard work and ideas. You can study and learn in school for a career, but for those following their passions it’s more of a “fail until you don’t and hope that something comes of it” scenario. Now obviously when I say that, I don’t mean to say that all of those studying for their degrees aren’t working hard. That’d be insane to say, come on. I applaud anyone who has survived university. These are just different pursuits. What I’m saying is that the hard work for a degree will pay off because you’ll actually have that degree to show you’re capable of doing a good job. When you’re trying to make something of yourself in the arts world for example, there’s no paper that will just get your foot in the front door. Only you.\n\nSo with that said (in an unintentionally pretentious fashion), I’m committing myself to pursue a career in something I’ve had an interest in since I was a teenager – screenwriting. I first started writing scripts when I was 15 years old. I watched The Pink Panther one night with my mother and I loved all of the insane, wacky antics that were going down. Before the movie even ended, I ran to my room and found a notebook and began writing a script about inept lawyers. Now those scripts I wrote as a teenager are total dog shit in retrospective, but it was a good way for a younger me to be creative. For a long time I had stopped writing scripts, thinking it was futile to even attempt a career in that field. There was a lot of time where I thought that I had no ambitions – but looking back I could see that I was wrong. I thought I had no ambition because I had no sense of what I wanted to do as a career when comparing myself with people around me. Doctors, bankers, lawyers, nothing like that has never appealed to me. I feel too alien from those careers. But I actually had a ton of ambition, I just didn’t think it was worth trying to be a writer because of how unlikely the odds are and the fact that my head was clouded from everything going on around me.\n\nRecently I took a six week course on screenwriting. My teacher was someone who had been in the business for such a long time, and he had made a living off of his writing. To me, this guy had made it. He never had to conform his values to whatever company he was working for, he worked his own hours and was getting satisfaction from being creative in his work. That’s what I want. Over the course of the program, I learned that I had a lot in common with my teacher. We shared a lot of the same thinking patterns and just the way we approach things. I felt so gratified to be around people that I felt understood me and understood what I was going through. I’ve never felt so inspired to stay creative and do what I want to do. The moment that I knew that I had to keep going with this was when he actually told the class that he thought my script had the best chance of selling out of the rest of the group. It’s like it affirmed something in me. It made me think that I have to keep going, keep up the pursuit.\n\nI know that the road that lies ahead of me will be very hard and full of set backs. But that’s nothing new to me. I can take that. I know that I’m going to have to find the time to write while at the same time working full time and maintaining my lifestyle. I also realize that it will take a long time to even get my foot in the door. But when I do, I’m going to kick that door down. I’m planning to do it despite everything, and I’ve honestly never felt more confidence in myself about anything before in my life. I feel that I have the creative tools to do this – it’s just up to me to make it happen.\n\nSo instead of taking my time to write up blog posts and lists and other stuff, I’m going to be focusing my writing skills on scripts instead. This means that there won’t be much posted on this blog – aside from the yearly top albums list of course. Perhaps I’ll find the time to update the blog every blue moon, but I make no promises. Perhaps this will become a more personal blog when I’m existential. Who knows. My goal when I started this blog was to get me to write and stay creative. It accomplished that, so it’s time to move on to the next thing.\n\nTo anyone who has ever read and enjoyed anything I’ve posted here: Thank you. The fact that anyone was just reading my posts or cared enough to stop by here always made me feel good. If only one person read my blog, then it was all worth it to me. Anyways that about wraps it up. If you want to keep up to date with what I’m up to, there’s links on this blog (I assume they’re still there anyways…) to my Twitter (which I rarely use) and my Instagram. So I’ll see you out there, yeah?\n\nTim\n\nGatekeeper bands. No, it’s not music for British royal guards to jam to during their long hours. A gatekeeper band (or artist, whatever) is an artist that you listen to that will eventually lead you down a path towards listening to other great music, and possibly even better music than the original band you were already listening to. A lot of the artists on here will be obvious for some people, but this list isn’t for them. Well technically it is, since it’s supposed to be entertainment, and entertainment is supposed to be all encompassing. But what I mean is that this is a list of artists that are great to listen to when you’re younger and first discovering music (or if you’re older and just missed out on some things). These bands will lead you to discover some other groups that are similar, yet have their own spin on the genre. Don’t worry I’m sure I’ll explain it better in the list. So here are 11 artists in no particular order that will bring your ears to some beautiful places.\n\n11. The Beatles\n\nAlright let’s just get these guys out of the way. It was obvious that they’d be here on this list since they, oh I don’t know, shifted the direction of ALL popular music for the last 50 years? The Beatles are that band that your parents show you when you’re a kid and haven’t ever listened to a song by anyone yet. There’s a reason for that though. Everything that will ever be said about them has already been said, but I’ll still say this much: the importance of this band can’t be overstated. They really did everything during their time as a band. They started out as a boy band during the British Invasion of the early 60s, singing love songs to girls who didn’t know how to react to being around them over than screaming like the devils spawn. Their style kept changing over time to reflect where music was at as a whole. They went from being the original Backstreet Boys, to being more folk focused, then they freaked out on drugs in India and got super trippy and experimental before releasing their last two albums, which had a much more mature sound than any of their earlier works. Since The Beatles have influenced every other band that plays today, it only makes sense that someone who is getting into them for the first time would eventually start discovering similar bands that played around that time such as The Kinks, The Who, The Beach Boys and whole bunch of other bands that start with “The”. These guys are the O.G. of gatekeeper bands.\n\n10. Eminem\n\nThis is another obvious one for people that listen to hip-hop music. I was 10 years old when I first heard The Real Slim Shady during a lunch break in school. We had free reign over the stereo, so my classmates would just bring in CDs to show off during this time. I heard a lot of cool artists for the first time like this (Gorillaz and OutKast come to mind). This also happened to be the first time I had really listened to rap before. To someone who came from a home where only the oldies were played, this was a bit of a shock to my senses. Like a lot of kids my age at the time, we stuck to Eminem’s music like glue. He wasn’t even my favorite artist at the time, but listening to him at that age left such an imprint on me that I had to listen to more of this mysterious thing called rap music. I ended up finding a lot of artists that I really liked in high school that can be traced back to listening to him. There was a lot of OutKast, Mobb Deep and Ludacris being played back in those days. Eminem is a great jumping off point for first time listeners of this kind of music. Is it inappropriate? Oh definitely. But his talent and charisma is undeniable and you can’t help but want to see what else is out there after listening to him.\n\n9. Sum 41\n\nThis probably applies more to Canadians that were growing up in the early 2000s than to anyone anywhere else, but it doesn’t make these guys any less worthy to be on here. The first time I heard a song by Sum 41 was when I was 11 years old and I was watching the music video for Fat Lip. At the time I didn’t think that there was anything more punk rock and bad ass than their music. There was even a segment in the music video where there’s a kid maybe a couple of years older than me at the time, whom was sitting next to two attractive women, with both his arms over them and even had a look on his face that just screamed “Yeah, that’s just how I roll”. I thought that that kid was the coolest and I wanted his life of rock and roll, getting into trouble and hanging out with punk babes. Sum 41 is a great band to introduce to someone young who might appear to have an interest in getting into punk rock/pop punk music. At the very least they’ll start finding bands like Blink 182, and jump from that point to listen to an artist such as Billy Talent and The Offspring. Just make sure to stay away from Simple Plan and Good Charlotte.\n\n8. Queen\n\nOh boy, where to start with this one. The classic glam rockers not only influenced myself a whole heap, but they’re a fantastic band to listen to as an introduction to classic rock music. When I was 15 years old, I was listening to a lot of, let’s just say questionable rap music at the time. All of a sudden I decided that I wanted a greatest hits collection of Queen because I liked the song Bohemian Rhapsody from watching Waynes World. What ended up happening to me was pretty amazing. I can easily say that listening to Queen at that time in my life really changed my perspective on things, especially in regards to my taste in music. From there I started listening to bands such as Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and other similar acts. They’re a band that I thank for introducing me to so much crucial and important music, and they’ll always have a special place in my heart. I’m confident that I’m not the only person that they could have this effect on.\n\n7. OutKast\n\nOutKast is mandatory listening for anyone who has even the slightest interest in hip-hop music. Their music even transcends hip-hop and incorporates so many other genres such as blues, drum and bass, soul and rock music just to name a few. I mentioned earlier when I was talking about Eminem that during our lunch period in elementary school when I was 11 years old, we would bring in CDs so we could show music to each other. One day someone had brought one that featured Ms Jackson from OutKast. As soon as I heard the chorus of that track it was over. I instantly became a fan and I still consider them not only one of my favorite artists of all time, but also an artist that have been responsible for introducing me to even more great acts. I still remember sitting with my best friend during lunch hour, he was rapping the whole verses while I took care of the chorus. Yeah, we probably didn’t get all the words right but the passion was there. Thanks to OutKast I was able to eventually hear about Killer Mike, Jay-Z, and Kanye West just to name a few. They have such an eclectic style of hip-hop and their verses have always been on point; it’s hard not to want to see what else is out there and compare styles. Obviously OutKast is on their own unique level in the hip-hop spectrum, but there’s a lot that can be learned from them. If you’re enjoying them, it’s likely that you would enjoy discovering artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper since they follow in the footsteps of OutKast when it comes to having a unique and diverse sound.\n\n6. Foo Fighters\n\nThis list is full of artists that almost everyone has heard of by now. But the point of this list is to name bands that lead you to other sweet bands. Foo Fighters is like the kindergarten of alternative rock music. Anybody who was growing up and had their formative years in the 2000s will be able to recognize the style that the Foo Fighters employed throughout their tenure as a band. When I was 15 and still getting into different styles of rock music, Foo Fighters were essential in how I perceived it. Queen, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana and Foo Fighters are bands that led me to a whole heap of other acts that were influenced by these names. My older brother owned a CD of their In Your Honor album, so I stole it from his room one day and listened to it a whole bunch on my own. Best of You was a big hit at the time, so they were a band that was impossible to ignore. Shortly after listening to Foo Fighters I found myself starting to check out bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Weezer. I’d include Queens of the Stone Age in that list if I wasn’t already a fan – however the revelation that Dave Grohl drummed on their Songs for the Deaf album was pretty mind blowing. Foo Fighters offer a blend of rock that appeals to so many different groups of people, whether it’s the casual radio listener or the intense metal head. They’re a band that will do good to a young listener since it will lead them to more great things to discover.\n\n5. k-os\n\nNow again this might have a lot to do with my Canadian-ness, but Toronto hip-hop artist k-os was a great influence during my teenage years. I liked him at an early age when the single for Crabbuckit was released in 2004. What I liked so much about him (aside from the aforementioned Canadian-ness) was that he wasn’t afraid to be different and unique. As an adult you know how important it is to be your own unique snowflake, but as a high school kid you’re just trying to fit in and not be so goddamn weird all the time. k-os embraces his weirdness and wasn’t afraid to breach classic rap music production. Whether he was incorporating blues, gospel, jazz or folk music, he was fearless in his pursuit to inspire creativity and show how successful you can be by being yourself. Since his music incorporated so many other genres it was easy to come away from his music knowing more about other artists such as Sam Roberts. I find it interesting that he was able to turn me on to other artists that weren’t necessary in the hip-hop scene. So basically my reasoning for him being on this list would be for the mere fact that not only is he making the artist pursue the sound of other hip-hop artists (such as K’Naan and The Roots), but also makes the listener curious about his own influences.\n\n4. Wolfmother\n\nRemember these guys? They had two big hits 10 years ago by the names of Woman and Joker and the Thief. You probably played those songs on Guitar Hero and Rock Band while getting drunk with your buddies. Good times, right? Here’s the thing about Wolfmother: they’re not necessarily a great band, but they hide that fact pretty well with 70s inspired guitar riffs – which is totally what 2006 was lacking. My gripe with this band is the fact that they were successful just for sounding like a band from the 1970s. A large group of those “ROCK IS DEAD!” people propelled this band to glory – for a while at least. They never seemed to want to stand out from the rest of the pack, instead feeling comfortable with being that band that doesn’t fit this era. Aside from those two singles I mentioned earlier, they didn’t have a whole lot going on. Their music came off as vapid, uninspired noise. So why the hell are they on this list since I don’t even really like them? Because they’re a band that makes you realize just how much better other bands are at capturing the sound that they’re attempting to emulate. Whether it’s bands like The Hives, The Raconteurs or Eagles of Death Metal. Hell, even Jet was a better rock band at the time. Young listeners at the time needed Wolfmother though. Those kids got to discover a whole ten year period (again, 1970s) where this type of music was perfected – no cheap imitations needed.\n\n3. Daft Punk\n\nRobots need love too. I think variety is important when it comes to listening to music. Obviously not for the casual listener, but for someone who truly is interested in music and has a passion for it. In my teens I was mostly interested in rock and hip-hop music but I always loved Daft Punk on the side since I was 12, they were like a wildcard in my music library. Having that appreciation for an artist that’s part of a genre outside your norm is a good thing. It makes you perceive rhythms, tempo, and other time signatures differently since it’s not what you’re accustomed to, thus giving you a more thorough understanding of what music has the potential to be and what it is about music that you really enjoy. Daft Punk are the most important act to have graced the EDM scene. They single handedly put the genre on the map and made people take notice. Whether it was grabbing your attention with their costumes or their insane music videos, the end result was always that they reeled you into their music. For anyone that has an interest in electronic music, it’s integral that they listen to music from them. Their music resulted in the offspring of acts such as Justice, MSTRKRFT, Vitalic and a whole slew of electronic groups. Those artists never would have found their home if it wasn’t for that signature sound that Daft Punk came up with. Not only will their music lead you to other great DJs and electronic artists, but you’ll also start feeling nostalgic for the disco that inspired them to do what they do today. These are droids worth looking for.\n\n2. Van Halen\n\nNow I might not be the biggest Van Halen fan, but I’m not going to hate on the fact that they sure as shit know how to play their respective instruments. They were a force in the 80s when it came to the metal scene. I mean sure, some people will cringe at just the mere thought of hair metal, but there’s something to be learned from everything. To become a metalhead you’ve got to start somewhere, so why not start at the beginning. Look, it took billions of years for life to form into what it is today. It started with a bunch of muck and shit that was bad for your health. It’s kinda like that with metal too. I mean sure, you have Black Sabbath acting like the beautiful sun giving life to the genre. But then you have that primordial ooze that was necessary for progressing life until it became something beautiful, like children’s laughter or some shit. Now I’m not necessarily saying that Van Halen is ooze, but they’re certainly no children’s laughter. The way that these guys were able to play the instruments alone is enough to garner your respect, however when you hear what they’re doing with all of that talent you start to wince a bit at some of their material. I may come off as hating Van Halen right now, but I actually do like some of their stuff. I can just admit that they’re not the most…nuanced band to have existed. Anyways the point I was trying to make before I started talking about various oozes was that while Van Halen is an alright band, they’re necessary to appreciate where guitar playing has evolved to. So when you’re hanging out listening to Mastodon or Between the Buried and Me, just remember that they wouldn’t have gotten there without learning a few tricks from these guys.\n\n1. Wu-Tang Clan\n\nI believe it was Confucius that once said “Wu-Tang Clan ain’t nothin’ to fuck with”. The early 90s was an extraordinary time to be a fan of hip-hop music. It was a time where the culture was booming, even if it wasn’t recognized as legitimate by a long list of individuals and groups. 1993 was probably the best year the genre has ever and will ever have. You had classic albums being dropped by 2Pac (Strictly 4 My Niggaz), A Tribe Called Quest (Midnight Marauders), and Snoop Dogg (Doggystyle) that would all eventually reach legendary statuses. And I haven’t even mentioned all of the other greats works released that year. However the Wu-Tang Clan also emerged that year from the rugged streets of Shaolin (AKA Staten Island) with Enter the 36 Chambers, a record that incorporated the cut off your head lyrical style of 9 severely different MCs with the grimey, raw beats of the RZAs production. I started listening to this album when I was 21 years old during a pretty rough summer. I had been watching a lot of Chappelle Show at the time to keep myself laughing, and Dave Chappelle would bring up the Wu-Tang Clan every now and then in his sketches. Curiosity got the better of me and I ended up listening to Enter the 36 Chambers to see what the fuss was about. The rest was history. Ever since I listened to that album I never looked back and became a huge fan of theirs and their music gave me a lot of happiness. Not only that, but I also started becoming more interested in what old school hip-hop could offer me. It was only after listening to that album that I started checking out Dr. Dre, Notorious B.I.G and Snoop Dogg – just to name a few. Anyone who has any sort of interest in wanting to dig into the golden years of hip-hop should definitely be starting with the Wu-Tang Clan. It’s just such an easy starting point and they’ll no doubt inspire the listener to see what else they were missing out on from that generation of hip-hop music.\n\nSo what do you think? Do you agree or disagree? And why? Are you annoyed that I trashed Wolfmother? Who would you say is a good gatekeeper band? Let’s keep the conversation going.\n\nEvery year since 2009 I’ve been listing my favorite albums of the year. Last year my favorite album was Run the Jewels’ amazing Run the Jewels 2 record. So what’s it going to be this year? There were some great pieces of music to come out this year, and from what I got to listen to at least, it was a pretty decent year for music. Music is constantly changing and evolving, and some of this years best artists kept evolving not only their own unique sound, but also managed to contribute to the evolution of their respective genres. 2016 is sure to continue this trend, but let’s take a look and how things were ranked this year.\n\n50. Titus Andronicus – The Most Lamentable Tragedy\n\nThe punk rockers from New Jersey released their fourth album this year, and it was their most ambitious work yet. There are 29 tracks in total, and the album is divided into five different sections. The album tells the tale of a character that goes through a bunch of surreal and dream like experiences, and it’s really all a story about manic depression. This isn’t for everyone though, as it’s definitely a very long album to get through. You really have to commit yourself to it. Some listeners will get the benefit of this album, others won’t.\n\n49. Vulfpeck – Thrill of the Arts\n\nThe first full length album from the funk group hailing from Michigan got a lot of heads bobbing this year. Their minimal approach to making their raw sound matched a lot of creativity certainly made for an interesting record.\n\n48. Mac Miller – GO:OD AM\n\n2015 was the year that MC Mac Miller kept getting his name bigger and bigger. You could find a lot of hip-hop heads discussing this album, and the opinions definitely varied. Some love it for it’s raw beats and creative rhymes, some felt very underwhelmed about it. The answer is in between both sides of the argument.\n\n47. Marina and the Diamonds – Froot\n\nOne of the funnest pop albums to rear its head in a long time. It strikes a good balance between being for the fun loving casual listener and deep enough cohesion for those that obsess over music. *ahem*\n\n46. Earl Sweatshirt- I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside\n\nSome listeners thought that this album was absolute genius. Some thought it was just trash. Personally I was expecting more from this release, especially since Earl Sweatshirt is one of the most talented MCs in the game right now. However there are still some gems, granted they’re dark gems considering how bleak and hopeless this album sounds. It’s a beautiful album and it sounds way different than most other hip-hop albums that you’ll hear. But I think Earl needs a hug you guys.\n\n45. Deafheaven – New Bermuda\n\nAnother impressive album from Deafheaven, who intrigued critics all over the world with their last album Sunbather. You can expect the same type of emotion coming out of the intense and harsh sound of the post metal style that they have come to embrace.\n\n44. Joey Bada$$ – B4DA$$\n\nI was really looking forward to hearing the first studio album from Joey Bada$$, who had released the spectacular 1999 mixtape – which showcased a style that was reminiscent of those golden hip-hop tracks you’d hear back in the 90s. I had big expectations, and I think those expectations actually hurt this album for me personally. I wanted more than what it gave me. It was still solid, and it’s great to hear some new talent cut his teeth on the scene.\n\n43. Panda Bear – Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper\n\nLately Panda Bear has been hampered by his past work. He’s a member of the experimental group Animal Collective, and has also released solo work that was spectacular (see Person Pitch). With such high quality work in his past, it’s difficult to come out with some new material that can live up to those efforts. However this album was still able to conjure up some new and interesting direction that give the record a rich and psychedelic sound.\n\n42. k-os – Can’t Fly Without Gravity\n\nI’ve been a big fan of k-os since I was very young. He was one of the earlier rappers that I can remember listening to and diving into his work. Each of his albums are different in their own way. And each one has also had something really good about it. Can’t Fly Without Gravity has some great moments on it, but it’s hurt by the fact that it takes too long for us to get there. The first half of the album really left me wanting more, but the second album was strong enough to save it completely. He continues his unique approach to making music, but he also embraces some more popular methods on this album. There’s some great moments on this album, but not enough as I’d like.\n\n41. Gangrene – You Disgust Me\n\nTalented hip-hop producers The Alchemist and Oh No teamed up this past year to collaborate on an album that features the likes of Sean Price and Action Bronson. This album celebrates the raw and grimey beats that hip-hop purists champion.\n\n40. The Internet – Ego Death\n\nWith their unique blend of soul infused hip-hop, The Internet made a huge statement this past year with the release of Ego Death. Consisting of some of the Odd Future members, they released an album that could satisfy not only those hungry for dope rhymes, but also for those who want something a little more tender and honest sounding than most of what you’ll usually hear. It kind of reminds of Wake Up! collaboration album that The Roots did with John Legend a few years back.\n\n39. Pusha T – King Push – Darkest Before Dawn: The Prelude\n\nEven though this album came out late, I was able to hear it quick enough to be able to properly evaluate it. Apparently this is supposed to act as a teaser to a future release, so you would think that he might not put out something of high quality and might save the good stuff for the next one. However there are a really good collection of songs here that will impress any hip-hop head and get this guy on their radar – if he wasn’t already of course.\n\n38. Best Coast – California Nights\n\nEach album from Best Coast makes you feel like you’re summer dreaming somewhere in beautiful California. Maybe you’re driving around in a convertible along the water as the sun sets. Maybe you’re walking around the warm nights as a gentle breeze tickles your shoulders. Whatever it is, Best Coast are great at making music that takes you to a sunnier place than you’re in. Their garage rock/pop hybrid delivers yet again this year.\n\n37. Wavves – V\n\nOn Wavves fifth album V, they strike a good balance between a happy go lucky sound and tragic themes. Their style of pop punk is enough to make anyone listening bob their heads and start to dance. Though maybe not as much fun as some their last releases, Wavves prove that they are capable of putting forth a nihilistic thrill of a record.\n\n36. Drenge – Undertow\n\nA solid alternative rock band to look out for would be this band right here. Drenge released their second album this year, and it’s a jam. Mixed with heavy riffs, thrashing drums and aggressive vocals, it makes for a might satisfying ride for rock fans.\n\n35. Sean Price – Songs in the Key of Price\n\nIn 2015 we lost rapper Sean Price, as he passed away in his sleep. There was a fundraiser after his death that was to help raise funds to the surviving members of his family, and there were able to come up with over $70,000. Before we lost this man to the void, he left hip-hop fans with an album that was 8 tracks long. And even though it was a really short record, it’s a piece of work that defines his style and the way he approached music.\n\n34. Ghostface Killah – Twelve Reasons to Die II\n\nA sequel to the terrific 2013 album Twelve Reasons to Die, Ghostface Killah continues to his streak of good records. It’s impressive that he releases music so often and his output hasn’t dipped in terms of quality. This album continues the cinematic feel of its predecessor, yet feels more relaxed with it’s production.\n\n33. Passion Pit – Kindred\n\nCreep album art aside, Passion Pits third album fully embraces their love of making catchy pop music and matching it up with depressing lyrics. Each song has a good bounce in its step and makes you want to just get up and sing along. Just don’t do it when you’re on the bus…\n\n32. Baroness – Purple\n\nIt seems that every time a new album from Baroness comes out, they still find a way to make sludge metal sound new all over again. The groove and the jam are back, as they keep finding ways to reinvent their sound. If you’re up for something loud that can permeate a tragic feeling, then you definitely shouldn’t sleep on this one.\n\n31. Dan Deacon – Gliss Riffer\n\nAfter a couple of underwhelming outputs in the last few years, it was very refreshing to hear Dan Deacon come back with something that sounded new but felt familiar. Aside from the album art, the music isn’t as weird as some of his past classics (Wham City and Snookered come to mind). But I say that lightly when I say it’s not as weird as his past efforts, because it’s definitely still a very peculiar piece of music. Deacon decides to utilize his bizarre sound in a way that is more welcoming to new listeners, but also in a way that will appease long time fans.\n\n30. Dead Weather – Dodge & Burn\n\nThe return of The Dead Weather is also the return of a blitzkrieg of raw blues rock that gets inside your head and makes your soul vibrate with its intensity. It’s definitely an upgrade from their last album, Sea of Cowards, which left me feeling underwhelmed. Now that they’ve come back, it’s like they pressed the Refresh button and started over. Alternative rock and Jack White fans everywhere are going to be happy with this one.\n\n29. Wand – Golem\n\nWand is a strange band. Their first album sounded nothing like their second one, Golem. The first album was full of lighthearted folk rock. However they totally revamped their style and went the psychedelic hard rock route. And damn was it a good call on their behalf.\n\n28. Cancer Bats – Searching for Zero\n\nOne of the most exciting bands out there is Cancer Bats. They’re a punk-metal hybrid that has come out with some of the funnest punk jams in recent years. Searching for Zero differentiates its sound from the bands past work, yet still feels like a classic Cancer Bats album.\n\n27. The Arcs – Yours, Dreamily\n\nThe debut album from The Arcs doesn’t disappoint. Following in the footsteps of artists like The White Stripes, The Black Keys, Benjamin Booker and Hanni El Khatib, The Arcs continue down the blues rock revival path. It doesn’t hurt that this band is a side project from the Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach. I know some people will roll their eyes at hearing another blues rock group that has his vocal stylings, but this album was a real treat from the beginning to the end.\n\n26. Kamasi Washington – The Epic\n\nCourtesy of Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder label, Kamasi Washington reinvents the genre of jazz with his brilliant release this year. A long and sprawling piece of music that actually makes it much more rewarding when you get to the end of it. Kamasi Washington does Miles Davis proud by putting his own unique spin on the genre, making it something truly special and awe-inspiring. There are so many different ideas that are mixing and matching all over the place, and in the brilliant chaos comes The Epic.\n\n25. Neon Indian – Vega Intl. Night School\n\nNeon Indian’s third album feels like he’s really matured as an artist and come into his own. His first two albums were great, but this one feels as if he’s shifted his sound into another gear. It can appeal to a lot of people. It’ll appeal to those that want something to dance and bob their heads to, those that want to appreciate an evolving genre, and those that can appreciate a sincere artist. His music has crossed the “chill-wave”sound and become more future funk oriented.\n\n24. Czarface – Every Hero Needs a Villain\n\nCzarface, the hip-hop trio that consists of Wu-Tang Clan alumni Inspectah Deck and the duo of 7L & Esoteric, put forth a rap album that is full of the villains perspective. It’s heavy on samples that give the record a comic book feel. There are some great guest features that include the likes of Method Man, GZA, R.A. The Rugged, Meyhem Lauren and MF DOOM. This album would’ve felt incomplete without DOOM showing up.\n\n23. Dune Rats – Dune Rats\n\nGoing down a similar path to their label brethren FIDLAR, Dune Rats made some noise (a lot of it) with debut album. They were able to capture the excitement, exuberance and carefree attitude of what being young is all about. If Nirvana and Wavves had a child, it would probably resemble Dune Rats.\n\n22. Hiatus Kaiyote – Choose Your Weapon\n\nThe Austrailian neo-soul group Hiatus Kaiyote had a big year with this Grammy nominated effort (the track Breathing Underwater was nominated for Best R&B Performance). It’s nice to see this group get the recognition that it deserves. It sounds sexy, funky and full of soul. Beautifully smooth vocals mixed with a silky instrumental makes for one impressive record.\n\n21. Refused – Freedom\n\nSwedish hardcore punk rockers Refused made their comeback album this past year, after having been broken up since 1998. Their last release, The Shape of Punk to Come is not only regarded as one of the greatest punk albums, but also one of the greatest albums ever recorded. There were a lot of doubters when it was announced that they were heading back into the studio together, but they proved all of the naysayers wrong. The intensity that they’re known for is still very present, as well as the creativity that made them so unique. Hard to be disappointed with this one.\n\n20. Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats – The Night Creeper\n\nThe heavy metal band Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats came back with a vengeance this year with their latest release, The Night Creeper. Not only does this album jam like it’s nobody’s business, but they also prove that good stoner rock bands are still making noise. So much noise.\n\n19. Father John Misty – I Love You, Honeybear\n\nI’ve been waiting for years to hear a new Fleet Foxes album, but I’ll gladly make due with any work from the former member, Father John Misty. Lyrically there’s a theme of disconnect between John and everyone around him. Match the paranoid and distrusting lyrics with his beautiful, strong voice, as well as the wonderful strumming of his acoustic guitar, there’s so much here that can be enjoyed.\n\n18. Florence + the Machine – How, How Blue, How Beautiful\n\nEver since their first album came out back in 2009, critics have been praising the group for their unique blend of rock, pop and soul. In particular the singer and songwriter, Florence Welch for her amazingly gifted vocals. The group has matured since that first record, and they have added more anthems to their discography with this release. Amazing vocals and superb musicianship make for a very worthy third album.\n\n17. FIDLAR – TOO\n\nNo sophomore struggles with this one. FIDLAR uses the recipe that made their first album so good, and builds upon it. Funner than a bar fight and twice as dirty, this band keeps riding their momentum with some of the best rock tunes you’ll hear all year.\n\n16. BADBADNOTGOOD / Ghostface Killah – Sour Soul\n\nCanadian jazz trio BADBADNOTGOOD have been making a name for themselves with their highly impressive covers of hip-hop classics over the past couple of years. One person who was also impressed by them was one of their icons, Ghostface Killah. Not big deal. The trio serve as the back beat throughout the album as Ghostface continues to flex his lyrical muscle. Some nice features from the likes of MF DOOM and Danny Brown make this a cross over album that shouldn’t be missed out on.\n\n15. Fuzz – II\n\nUnderground rocker Ty Segall makes music at such an unbelievable pace that you can’t help but think of him as a modern Frank Zappa of sorts. With some of the best heavy riffs you’ll hear matched with punk vocal stylings, it’s hard not to fall in love with this one. It’s a hairy album that makes you feel like you’re in a dirty bar watching a bunch of animals attack their instruments.\n\n14. The Game – The Documentary 2\n\nThe highly anticipated sequel to his debut record The Documentary has finally arrived this year. Now I was never really a fan of The Game, but after having listened to this gem, I think I’m going to have to reconsider. It’s been a big year for the city of Compton, what with the success of Kendrick Lamar, a new Dr. Dre album, the Straight Outta Compton film, and now this album. There are a ton of guests on this one, with the likes of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, Q-Tip, Snoop Dogg, Kanye West and a host of others showing up to spit out some verses. It’s like an all star game for rap music. Easy E would be proud.\n\n13. The Prodigy – The Day is My Enemy\n\nThe Prodigy have been around for a long time now, and they still are able to create music every once in a while that not stays true to their original sound and goals, but they’re also able to evolve their sound and make it modern. The Day is My Enemy is armed to the teeth with relentless aggression that has one goal in mind: to kill any perceptions of electronic music that you previously had.\n\n12. Hanni El Khatib – Moonlight\n\nThe last two releases from blues rock artist Hanni El Khatib showed a lot of promise, yet didn’t live up to expectations. However it’s clear that with this album, he has come into his own with his experimental blues rock revival. Fans who are tired of hearing Dan Auerbach styled vocals will be distracted enough with the creativity of his sound that sets him apart from the rest.\n\n11. Tame Impala – Currents\n\nTame Impala keeps upping their game with each album release. The psychedelic group came together and made something really special. It’s trippy, poppy, deep and full of experimental sounds that would make their peers jealous. There’s an abundance of ridiculously impressive songs here and this is an album that I’m sure will still be talked about years from now.\n\n10. The Sheepdogs – Future Nostalgia\n\nThe Sheepdogs are great at making rock music that people of all ages can enjoy. You can call them alternative or you can call them Dad Rock, it simply doesn’t matter since their output is consistently of great quality. Future Nostalgia is an appropriate title for their album since they sound like a 70s rock band that has somehow been transported to the future.\n\n9. Muse – Drones\n\nIt’s back to basics for Muse. Their last three albums ventured from what made them so successful in the first place. And while I still enjoyed each of their albums in their own ways, it was hard not to miss the Muse that I fell in love with as a teenager. Thankfully with Drones it seems like they have gone back to their roots and have made music that sounds more reminiscent of their classic album Origin of Symmetry. Singer Matthew Bellamy showcases his skills on the guitar as well as his amazing vocals, while the rest of the gang fills out the rest admirably. Glad to see the Muse I know and love back.\n\n8. Jamie xx – In Colour\n\nAs far as debut albums go, this is one for the books. The xx member, Jamie Smith made one of the most beautiful pieces of music in recent memory. In particular the track Loud Places is one of the best songs that I’ve ever listened to, it’s a five star song. This album is another example of how great of a producer Jamie xx is. He is able to make electronic music that can make you dance and can make you feel.\n\n7. Big Grams – Big Grams\n\nThough it’s technically an EP, Big Grams was one of the best releases of the year. OutKast’s Big Boi teamed up with the duo from Phantagram to form Big Grams in this collaborative effort. Fans that are hungering for more OutKast have been let down by Andre 3000s apparent lack of interest in music these days but Big Boi has been picking up the slack by producing two solo albums as well as this one. You can expect wonderfully impressive vocals from Sarah Barthel, solid production from Josh Carter and dope flows from Big Boi (as usual). One of the highlights of this release would include the track Born to Shine which includes some epic verses from Run the Jewels.\n\n6. Action Bronson – Mr. Wonderful\n\nAction Bronson has been slaying the underground hip-hop scene for a couple of years now, so he was due to deliver on the hype when it came time for his first major studio album to come out. Though a little short for my liking, Action was still able to do what he does best: rap about food and sex, make wrestling references and conjure hilarious imagery with his rhymes. Not only was this a great rap album, but it experiments by having rock and foreign music influencing the production. Easy Rider is one of the best songs in hip-hop that you’ll hear all year, and even though it’s the standout track, there are a lot of other gems to keep in your rotation constantly.\n\n5. Eagles of Death Metal – Zipper Down\n\nWith every release that Josh Homme is involved with brings a lot of excitement. I’ve been listening to his various projects for years, and I don’t think I’ve ever been let down by any of them. Zipper Down continues Eagles of Death Metals streak of fun music that doesn’t take itself too seriously, but also has enough creativity to stand out from their past work. This album celebrates silliness and also engages the listener with their classic style of danceable rock and roll.\n\n4. Mini Mansions – The Great Pretenders\n\nThis is an album that really caught me off guard this year. Every now and then when I’m at the store, I look for albums that I’ve never heard of and buy them on the off chance that I’ll be surprised and find a hidden gem. This was one of those. Not only did I enjoy this, but it was also one of the best releases of the entire year. This album mixes pop, rock and new wave in such a way that can make the casual listener and the music snob come together in peace. The song Vertigo was one of this years best.\n\n3. Dr. Dre – Compton\n\nA lot of music lovers were caught off guard and began to freak out when it was announced that there was going to be a new Dr. Dre album coming out. There were still questions on whether or not Dre would be able to adapt to the times and still release something worthwhile. I never had any doubts since he’s essentially the master of west coast hip-hop. Compton is indeed a worthy addition to his discography as it kept all of the traits of what people love about the doctors music. It has the creative beats, the tough and rugged delivery, the hardcore gangster themes and the ability to get a place jumping. There’s some great features as well with the likes of Ice Cube, Kendrick Lamar, The Game, Anderson Paak, Jill Scott, Eminem and Snoop Dogg. Getting to hear Dre ripping verses with Snoop and Eminem like in the golden days is not only nostalgic, but it’s pretty damn good. If this is indeed his last solo album he’ll ever release, it’s a pretty good way to close the curtain.\n\n2. Between the Buried and Me – Coma Ecliptic\n\nBetween the Buried and Me are one of those groups where you wonder if the band members are actually human. With each album of theirs that comes out over the years, it’s hard to fathom how they are able to consistently come up with something so brilliant, creative and fresh. Some of the best albums that I’ve ever listened to in my life were from these guys. Ever since Colors came out in 2007, they’ve done nothing but continue to up their game with amazing releases. This is their fourth consecutive album that blew my mind. When it comes to progressive metal, there’s nobody better than these guys. They experiment a bit on Coma Ecliptic by making their own spin on a rock opera of sorts. The result is nothing short of brilliant.\n\n1. Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp a Butterfly\n\nNo surprise here. Could it really be anything else? One of the most important hip-hop albums to come out in recent memories is a game changer. It’s hard to even say that this is a hip-hop album since there are so many different influences throughout it. There’s jazz, R&B, soul, experimental, disco, funk and more. This record changes what hip-hop can be and will make other artists push the envelop with what they can do with the genre. There aren’t many singles on this, instead it’s a long and cohesive album where every song has a place and a role to play. It all ends with Kendrick interviewing 2Pac (using audio clips from obscure interviews) which is fascinating to hear what kind of conversation they could have had. It feels like a passing of the torch of sorts, where 2Pac is handing it off to Kendrick. I have a feeling that this is just the beginning for him and he’s going to run far with the torch.\n\nNow just keep in mind, these are the records I heard at least. If there was something great that’s not on here, it’s likely that I just slept on it. But what did you think of the music that came out in 2015? Do you agree with this list? Is there anything that you think I’m missing? What was your favorite album to come out this year? Let me know in the comments, it’d be great to have a discussion with all of you. Here’s hoping that 2016 will provide us all with more great music for us all to enjoy in the coming years.\n\nTwo weeks ago rap and pop icon Missy Elliott dropped her first single in nine years. She’s been hard at work in the studio working on her sixth album for the last year. When she appeared at the Superbowl half time show in last years big game, I was expecting that she would have something new for us on the way. However for the longest time there was just silence. There was no news on what she was up to. I’ve been one of the many fans that have been waiting so long for her to show up again with some new bangers, and now she’s finally back. Her single “WTF (Where They From)” signals that a new album from Missy Misdemeanor is well on its way to our ears. I’ve been a fan of hers since early high school when I was rocking “Gossip Folks” on a burned CD that an old friend of mine made for me. I also had Pass That Dutch on a tape cassette that I recorded off the radio from an old stereo system. The Misses and I go way back basically.\n\nThe fact that so much time has passed since we last heard from her, it got me thinking about other artists that haven’t released any material in what feels like eternity. There are a lot of great artists that need to get on a new album right away, and I’m hoping that the ones listed below (in no particular order) will grace us with their sound sometime soon in the not too distant future.\n\n11. The Avalanches\n\nAustralian electronic group The Avalanches haven’t released an album since their critically acclaimed debut LP Since I Left You. Their album had people from all over the music spectrum talking. Actually their video for their single Frontier Psychiatrist still stands out as one of my absolute favorite music videos of all time because of its tongue in cheek surrealism and bizarre themes. Within the past couple of years there has been some talk of them being back in the studio, collaborating with the likes of Ariel Pink and Danny Brown. However those were rumors that were circulating in 2011, and we’re just about to be in 2016. Since there’s no concrete news currently, I’ll just keep my hopes up for new material for now.\n\n10. Fleet Foxes\n\nFleet Foxes prove that Seattle doesn’t just breed slummy grunge rockers, but also happens to be home of talented folk musicians as well. We haven’t had any material from these guys since 2011 when their album Helplessness Blues dropped. Ever since then it’s been nothing but silence. The only news that has emerged from their camp is that lead singer and guitarist Robin Pecknold moved to New York so that he could finish his studies in university. As important as an education is, I can’t help but feel sad that listeners are being deprived of such wonderful music. Both of their albums (their self titled release came out in 2008) were met with such enthusiasm and acclaim that it’s hard not to miss their sound. The only good thing to come out of this hiatus for the band is that Joshua Tillman left the band due to inactivity and started creating his own beautiful music under the name Father John Misty. He’ll do for now, but nothing will suitably replace the bands signature sound. Robin Pecknolds studies can’t end soon enough.\n\n9. Desert Sessions\n\nThis one is a little tricky, but I couldn’t leave Desert Sessions off of this list. If you didn’t know, Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age used to like to meet up with a bunch of his musician friends – like PJ Harvey, Brant Bjork, Nick Oliveri, Chris Goss, Mark Lanegan and Dean Ween just to name a few – at a recording studio in Joshua Tree. The recording studio is just an old house filled with unique recording equipment that provides a unique sound. Along with all of the drugs everyone was taking, they all loved to jam and create something special. When they all meet up at the ranch, they’re there for the sake of music – nothing else. There are several tracks that have been laid down in these sessions that became popular Queens of the Stone Age songs, such as In My Head, Make it Witchu, Hanging Tree and Millionaire. The last volume of music they released was back in 2003, so it’s definitely been a while. A lot of things need to come together for another session to take place however. Timing and schedule conflicts make it hard for Homme to get all of his friends together again for another jam, but hopefully the pieces will fall into place sooner or later. Fans are waiting for another Desert Sessions, and I’m sure Homme would absolutely love to have the chance to go back to the ranch and create something beautiful.\n\n8. Cool Calm Pete\n\nCool Calm Pete is a Korean rapper who was raised on the streets of Queens, New York. His debut album Lost was released back in 2005 and since then he’s been relatively quiet. Mixtapes were released here and there between 2009 and 2011, but there’s been no indication of a full album coming our way. If Lost is the only album that he ever releases, it’s a bit of a double edged sword. It’s good in the sense that he’ll be remembered for a great rap album, but it’s sad to think that we will probably be deprived of hearing what else he could have in store for us. I want to be proved wrong that he’s never coming back. So come on Pete, just do it!\n\n7. Rage Against the Machine\n\nPolitical angst has never been better than when Rage Against the Machine were giving the system the middle finger through their music. So much has changed in the political climate since Rage Against the Machine released their last album all the way back in 1999 (Renegades was released in 2000, but that’s a cover album so it doesn’t count). I know that I’m not alone in needing to hear what these guys have to say about what’s going on in the world today. 9/11, Occupy Wallstreet, Drones, Obama, Donald Trump, there’s just so much material that they have to work with. Political apathy has a tight grip on the masses, but a new Rage Against the Machine album would loosen that grip a bit and give some listeners a new found feeling of hope. It’s not likely that they’ll ever head back into the studio, but a man can still have hope.\n\n6. Madvillain\n\nNo hip-hop head with any self respect can tell you that they haven’t listened to Madvillainy before. The duo is composed of rapper MF DOOM and producer Madlib. The two of them captured something special, unique and weird when they released their only album back in 2004. The album was met with praise for it’s uncommon approach, obscure lyrical references and commercially unfriendly sound. Throughout the album you won’t find any hooks or choruses, a true departure from conventional hip-hop music. I listened to this album for the first time when I was fifteen years old, and it changed me forever. It was my first underground hip-hop record to listen to, and it made me realize that rap music can be so much more than what is played on television and radio. Amazing rhymes that leave you scratching your head mixed with weird production that you can’t wrap your head around make for an amazing combination. Fans are dying to hear a new album with these two, but the duo continue to work on other projects for the time being. The ever elusive DOOM continues to work on other peoples projects lately, but currently there are no plans for another Madvillain or even DOOM album. It’s been eleven years since we had these guys hook up for a legendary album, it seems like they’re way too overdue for a sequel.\n\n5. Alexisonfire\n\nAlright cut the crap, Alexisonfire. You guys broke up five years ago, then went on to have a farewell tour, followed by having shows sporadically since 2010. THEN you announce at Riot Fest in Toronto this year that you’re officially back. AND THEN you have the gall to say that you have no plans for any new music or tours, even after making that announcement. Quit making us wait with bated breath.\n\n4. Mos Def\n\nLook I know you’ve been super busy with acting, trying your hand at stand up comedy, changing your moniker to Yasiin Bey temporarily, and being a political activist and all, but when will we finally get an album to follow up on 2009s excellent The Ecstatic? It’s been too long since we got to hear some wise lyrics from the great Mos Def. Every song this man appears on is instantly better because it has him on it. I’m sure he has a lot to say after all these years of keeping quiet, so what’s the hold up? If the rumors of a Black Star resurrection with Talib Kweli are true, then all is forgiven.\n\n3. Them Crooked Vultures\n\nWhen it comes to super groups in music, there are two categories: Them Crooked Vultures, and then there’s everybody else. With a lineup of Dave Grohl, Josh Homme and John Paul Jones, you get three of the biggest acts in the history of rock music teaming up to delivery something nasty. Their self titled album came out back in 2009 and rocked us to the core. I know that it’s difficult for members from Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age and Led Zeppelin to clear up their schedules so that they can reunite for another album, but how much longer can we go without being graced by the three headed hydra of rock royalty again? All three members absolutely love playing music together so it’s doesn’t appear to be a matter of if an album is going to happen, rather a matter of when we’ll get to have a new album.\n\n2. Tool\n\nWith a hardcore fanbase comes a great responsibility. And Tool tends to neglect the responsibility of giving their fans new music. Their last album 10,000 Days was released in the spring of 2006, so it’s safe to say that the fans are becoming more and more rabid for new material. To put into perspective just how long it’s been since they released that album, I was in grade 10 and dating my first girlfriend at age sixteen. I’m now a twenty-five year old man who lives on his own and works full time. Where does the time go? Anyways these guys are known to take their time with their music, so it comes as no surprise that we’re still waiting to hear some news. The band had a lawsuit against them that they had been battling for the past couple of years, but now that it’s over they can finally focus on writing the new album. Tool is going to be touring this winter, so hopefully that’s a sign of more good things to come.\n\n1. OutKast\n\nQuick story: when I was in elementary school, the kids in my class used to like to bring in CDs to play for everyone during lunch hour. This is how I was introduced to the likes of Eminem, Gorillaz, Nelly, and Limp Bizkit. One day however at the ripe age of ten, someone brought in an OutKast album and played the song Ms Jackson. Ever since then I have been the biggest OutKast fan I know of. Not only did OutKast get me into hip-hop music, but they got me into music, period. I have so much to thank them for, since growing up I would listen to their CDs on my walkmen for hours on end. Fifteen years since I started listening to them and they’re still one of my favorites – and they always will be. Sadly though, OutKast haven’t released any music since 2006, and it was a soundtrack to their film Idlewild. Still a great piece of music, but it doesn’t make it any easier that we’ve been without a new album for almost ten years now. Thankfully one half of the duo, Big Boi, has been busy working on new material. He has released Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty in 2010, Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors in 2012, and the brand new Big Grams collaboration that came out earlier this fall. His work has been a great way to keep fans happy, but at the same time it makes us want to have Big Boi and Andre 3000 team up again for another trip into that weird and funky sound that they create together. Last summer OutKast was touring for summer festivals, which was a great sign that maybe they were going to head back into the studio again. Even while the duo were in their prime, they didn’t perform live very much. If there’s any good in the world, there will be another OutKast album. Even though it’s already been nine years, the wait is excruciating.\n\nAll eleven of these artists will hopefully be able to give us an update on their next albums sooner rather than later. Don’t hold your breath though, because it’s not likely that all of these artists will have good news for us.\n\nWhat makes a song great? You can point to good production, solid song structure, creativity and talent all you want. But when a song has great lyrics that tell a story it really brings the song to another level. A song that can strongly convey a story and paint a vivid image in the mind of the listener is not only rare, but admirable as well. Telling a story within a song is hard to pull off well, but there were/are some artists that were able to do it masterfully. Below you can find 8 songs that are great examples of storytelling in music.\n\nAtmosphere – The Waitress\n\nStarting off the list is Minnesota hip-hop duo Atmosphere with their song The Waitress. The lyrics tell a story about a homeless man who visits the same coffee shop every single day so that he can see a woman that works there. The homeless man craves her attention even though she has him kicked out of the establishment every day. However he persists and continues to show up even though she wants nothing to do with him. Initially it sounds like the man is in love with this woman, but it’s not until the very last line of the song where we learn that he’s actually a regretful father visiting his daughter.\n\n2. The Raconteurs – Carolina Drama\n\nNext up is The Raconteurs with Carolina Drama, a song that blends whimsical country styling with an alternative rock twist. Singer Jack White tells the tale about a poor family from rural South Carolina. There’s a ten year old boy named Billy, his older brother, their mother and her loser boyfriend that comprise the story. Billy finds his mother crying while her boyfriend is beating up a priest pretty bad. It turns out that the priest is actually his father – even though he’s not in the scene anymore. He decides to save his father by hitting his moms deadbeat boyfriend in the head with a milk bottle, which ends up killing him. It turns out that his father has actually been paying their bills for years – so he’s a good man! The family plans to take the body to hide it and run away to Tennessee. However this story doesn’t have a definitive ending, as we’re told that only the milkman knows the full story…\n\n3. Eminem – Stan\n\nIn 2000, critics mostly downplayed the success of rapper Eminem by saying that he relied on shock value and lacked any true talent. When he released Stan it was a big middle finger to the critics, showing that he was capable of creating something lyrically challenging. The story is of a deranged fan named Stan that writes letters to Eminem and becomes more unhinged as the song progresses. Stan pours his heart and soul into each letter he sends to Eminem, but becomes so obsessed with him that he goes off the deep end after not getting any letter or response back from him. The climax of the song has the fan driving off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend locked in the trunk. The last verse is Eminem’s letter finally getting back to Stan, but only realizing that the story he heard of a man driving off a bridge with his girlfriend locked in the trunk is the person he’s actually writing to. Dark poetry indeed.\n\n4. Johnny Cash – A Boy Named Sue\n\nOriginally written by Shel Silverstein but made popular by Johnny Cash in his live performance at San Quentin State Prison in front of a large group of inmates. The story is a tale of revenge of a young man looking for his father that named him Sue before abandoning him and his mother. Sue is randomly at saloon wettin’ his whistle, when he sees the mangy dog that named him Sue. A bar fight to the death ensues, and it looks like Sue has the upper hand and is about to finish off his old man. Until his father cracks a smile and reveals why he gave him that awful name. It ends with the two of them embracing each other and having respect for each other. The live version of the song makes the lines of the song much more powerful with the reactions of the inmates.\n\n5. Kendrick Lamar – Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinters Daughter\n\nThe story of Kendrick Lamar and the girl of his dreams – at the age of 16 at least – Sherane. They’ve known each other for a couple of months by this point. They meet up at a party and begin flirting with each other and exchanging phone numbers. Over the summer they keep in contact and keep getting to know each other on a deeper level. By the end of the song, Kendrick is driving up to her house to pick her up. But she has a lot of gang bangers in her family, and he’s welcomed by some young men in black hoodies. It’s a great way to open up his good kid, m.A.A.d. city album, as the whole album tells the full story. I know I’ve talked about Kendrick a lot on this blog already so far, but you should listen to that album if you haven’t already. Especially if you appreciate a concept album with a cohesive story to it.\n\n6. Slick Rick – Children’s Story\n\nIt’s impossible to have a list of storytelling in music without the ultimate story teller, Slick Rick. Some kids are asking for Uncle Ricky to tell them a good night story, so he decides to tell them a cautionary tale of two kids who start robbing people. And they can’t stop themselves, they essentially become addicted to the adrenaline rush that they get from it. It backfires on them though when one day they attempt to rob an undercover police officer and they get shot. Not exactly the best good night story, but I bet those kids who heard it learned that they should never rob anyone ever.\n\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/xr3q27_bob-dylan-hurricane_music\n\n7. Bob Dylan – Hurricane\n\nRubin “Hurricane” Carter was a middleweight boxer who was wrongfully accused of murder. He spent 20 years in prison before being released because of public outcry. Only a sublime artist such as Bob Dylan can perfectly articulate the injustice and anger of the situation in a 8+ minute epic song. He tells the whole story of Rubin Carter which is full of racism and police hypocrisy. There’s movies and books that tell the story as well, but Dylan put it best.\n\n8. OutKast – A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre (Incomplete)\n\nDo you think that you’d be able to tell the story of your entire life in five and a half minutes – in rhyme? Well that’s exactly what Andre 3000 from OutKast did on the final track of the classic The Love Below album. No choruses. No over the top production. No breaks. Just spitting word after word, each one more profound than the last. A masterful prose full of poetry that summarizes the entire career of Andre 3000. He goes through the process of meeting Big Boi and starting OutKast, selling drugs just to get by and even having a child with soul singer Erykah Badu. The song title has “(Incomplete)” in it because its supposed to signify that his story keeps continuing from the point that the song was made. It’s an absolutely incredible display of Andres ability to flex his lyrical muscle. Definitely the track you show people who doubt his skills on the mic."
