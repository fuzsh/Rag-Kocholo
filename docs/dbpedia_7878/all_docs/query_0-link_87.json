        "text": "Presented by GRAMMY.com, Songbook is an editorial series and hub for music discovery that dives into a legendary artist's discography and art in whole — from songs to albums to music films and videos and beyond.\n\nEven though it sounds like the product of some urban legend, buried deep in the digital detritus of an obscure Reddit thread, the members of Mastodon really did meet at a High on Fire show in 2000.\n\nDrummer Brann Dailor and rhythm guitarist Bill Kelliher were already well acquainted and a fixture of the New York underground scene, having played together in mathcore outfit Lethargy and noisegrind act Today Is The Day. After relocating to Atlanta and stopping by a High on Fire show in a friend's basement, they quickly forged an easy friendship with bassist Troy Sanders and lead guitarist Brett Hinds over their shared love of sludge metal, classic new wave British heavy metal (NWOBHM), and dive-bar hard rock staples.\n\nContrary to most acts in the genres of metal and rock, Mastodon has never been a revolving door of membership. With the exception of original lead vocalist Eric Saner (who left the group in its infancy prior to any formal releases), the core quartet has remained unchanged for over two decades. It's easy to see how this continuity has been fundamental to their success, impressive body of work and growth as musicians.\n\nWith each member of the group bringing their unique talents to bear across their diverse discography — Dailor's impeccable polyrhythms and smooth melodic croon; Hinds' banjo-inspired hybrid picking and wailing growl; Sanders' rumbling low-end tone and gruff yell; Kelliher's steady rhythms and technical versatility — Mastodon's collective unity has created something greater than the sum of its gifted parts.\n\nIn the latest edition of Songbook, GRAMMY.com explores the dense themes and progressive impulses that have motivated Mastodon for over two decades — from their molten sludge metal origins to their embrace of heady psychedelia and hard rock songwriting.\n\nListen to GRAMMY.com’s Songbook: An Essential Guide To Mastodon playlist on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora.\n\n(Editor's note: This list focuses on the core Mastodon discography and excludes EPs and live albums.)\n\nSummoning Hail And Flame\n\nTo fully appreciate Mastodon's turn-of-the-millennium beginnings, it's necessary to jump forward in time ever so slightly. Released in early 2006 as one of their final projects with long-time label Relapse Records (and before their big-league step up to Reprise Records and Warner Music), Call of the Mastodon provides a scattershot sampling of the band's early years.\n\nFeaturing tracks from the Slickleg and Lifesblood EPs — both originally released in 2001 and remastered by original producer Matt Washburn — this compilation LP showcases a proto-Mastodon still in formation. Repackaged out of sequence, the compositions sound less like the towering and imposing beast of their Pleistocene namesake and more like a wild elephant calf finding its feet. However, this sonic adolescence still manages to provide subtle hints toward the band's future potential.\n\nFrom the thrash-like precision and murky downstrokes of \"We Built This Come Death\" to the frantic rhythmic pummeling of \"Welcoming War,\" it's clear that Hinds and Kelliher always had the chops as axemen to rival sludge icons like Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower and High On Fire's Matt Pike. Both \"Shadows That Move\" and \"Hail to Fire\" bristle with livewire energy that feels almost hardcore-inspired, while \"Battle at Sea\" and the droning \"Deep Sea Creature\" point towards the quartet's inclination for distortion, juxtaposition, and thematic lyrical gestures — albeit across a more abrasive vocal range that future albums would wisely temper.\n\nWhile the compilation may lack the overall narrative cohesion and vision of their later records, Call of the Mastodon should ultimately be viewed as the band's first \"true\" album — a sentiment Kelliher expressed to Loudwire in 2017.\n\nIf Call of the Mastodon represented the Atlanta quartet finding their feet, then their official debut album is the moment that truly stamped their arrival on the American heavy metal scene.\n\nThe sonic leap from those early EPs to Remission (2002) is noticeably stark, present in almost every facet of the record: the heavily saturated, down-tuned crunch of quaking album opener \"Crusher Destroyer\"; the coarse bellows and multi-pronged vocal attack from Hinds and Sanders; the lengthy experimental gallop of \"Trainwreck\" and \"Trilobite\"; Dailor's effortlessly intricate drum fills and accents; and engineer Matt Bayles' (Botch, ISIS, These Arms Are Snakes) thick, weighty production.\n\nAlthough Remission isn't strictly a concept album, Mastodon weaves together thematic elements to complement their towering riffage and serpentine grooves. With fire as a loose motif, tracks like \"Burning Man\" and lead single \"March of the Fire Ants\" draw on hellfire imagery to add emotional color to expressions of hopelessness and torment. \"Where Strides the Behemoth\" and \"Ol'e Nessie\" channel mythical creatures as metaphors for revelatory visions and desperate soul-searching, while \"Trampled Under Hoof\" throws back to the \"life's blood\" of the group's origins.\n\nYet, perhaps the most grounding inspiration comes from Dailor, who described the record as an outlet for grief following his sister's suicide when he was a teen: \"I was never able to put that stuff anywhere. All that pain I was carrying inside. The pain of losing her had always been there… When I started playing in Mastodon and moved to Atlanta, there was a big personal healing. Mastodon had a lot to do with that. That's one of the main reasons that the album is titled Remission. Remission means forgiveness and healing.\"\n\nPaul Romano's striking album cover — a distressed \"Workhorse\" caught mid-combustion and near-death, as vibrant purple flames erupt from its torso — brings it all together: fading strength and all-consuming power; bitter cycles of life and death; anger and love; existential heaviness and divine light. Following Remission, Romano illustrated all of Mastodon's artwork throughout their first decade.\n\nThrough The Salt, Earth And Sky\n\nMastodon needed to take things to the next level on their sophomore LP and push the scope of their Southern sludge metal into the realm of the gargantuan and monolithic. Curiously, inspiration for this conceptual leap came in the form of two unlikely sources: the recurrence of elemental leitmotif, and American novelist Herman Melville's Moby-Dick; or, The Whale (1851).\n\nThis deep engagement with Melville's \"Great American Novel\" allowed the group to continue the use of elemental cues as their dominant theme. Where Remission used fire to stand in for themes of redemption and rebirth, Leviathan (2004) turned to the sea as the spiritual catalyst for exploring mortality and the band's desire for greatness.\n\nAs Dailor explained in several interviews, there were a number of parallels between the fixated obsessions of Melville's now-iconic Captain Ahab and the band's longing to establish a legacy in the hallowed halls of metal. Discussions among the quartet acknowledged that this pursuit was, in part, a manifestation of their own \"white whale,\" their collective and elusive \"sea salt mastodon.\"\n\nMusically, the record throws the listener overboard into a raging tempest. Opener \"Blood and Thunder\" sports one of the most iconic and recognizable riffs in the genre, while vigorous cuts like \"Aqua Dementia\" and \"Naked Burn\" successfully split the difference between density and playfulness — equal parts Melvins and Slayer, Neurosis and Thin Lizzy. Yet even such lofty ambitions can't sink the record's staggering 13-minute opus \"Hearts Alive,\" a track that effortlessly fuses the lumbering mass of Sabbathian doom with lugubrious melodic undercurrents.\n\nDespite future albums achieving ever higher levels of commercial success, Leviathan spawned four singles (\"Iron Tusk,\" \"Blood and Thunder,\" \"I Am Ahab,\" and \"Seabeast\"), received multiple Album of the Year accolades, was inducted into the Decibel Hall of Fame in 2016, and is now considered one of the defining metal albums of the 21st century.\n\nWith their status as metal titans now solidified, Mastodon used this creative freedom to refine and expand their sonic template. As the band told Dave Grohl in a revealing interview for Revolver, much of the impetus behind Blood Mountain (2006) came from seeking out \"melody as a fifth instrument.\"\n\nFor their third LP, the quartet leaned into intricate vocal layering, ambient textures and dizzying instrumental wandering of psychedelia harder than ever before. This progressive flirtation was immediately evident with the double lead single \"Crystal Skull/Capillarian Crest.\" The former moves briskly through gnarled tempo changes and locked-in grooves from Sanders and Dailor, allowing each harmonized riff from Hinds and Kelliher to shine brighter; the latter frequently descends into jazzy prog passages, resting on a lofty chorus and mystic nods to \"cosmogenic cycles\" and \"universal dreams.\"\n\nDrawing heavily from Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces (1949), Blood Mountain crafts a fantasy epic worthy of a hefty acid trip, with earth as the primary elemental cue. Supercharged opener \"The Wolf Is Loose\" is a carnal, riff-centric beast that guides the record's overarching narrative. Utilizing a deceptively catchy hook, \"The Wolf\" sets up a werewolf protagonist, the quest for a crystal skull to replace a reptilian brain, and the ascension of the album's titular peak.\n\nBolstered by guest features from Scott Kelly (Neurosis), Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age), Isaiah Owens and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (the Mars Volta), Blood Mountain racked up accolades from outlets like Kerrang and Metal Hammer, while also scoring the group their first GRAMMY nomination for the album's third single \"Colony of Birchmen\" — itself a direct homage to Dailor's love for English rockers Genesis, further shoring up Mastodon's progressive credentials.\n\nPiecing together Mastodon's exploration of elemental leitmotif across their 2000s output, a distinct narrative telos begins to emerge. Beginning with the fiery molten core of Remission, we move outwards from the planet's center to the sprawling watery depths of Leviathan, before stepping foot on earthly terra firma in Blood Mountain. Taking this conceptual thrust to its logical end, Mastodon's fourth LP concludes their early album tetralogy with air or \"aether\" as its elemental lodestar.\n\nCrack The Skye (2009) is one of the band's most meditative and diffuse efforts, exploring themes of disembodied emancipation. \"[Crack The Skye] is a departure from everything we've previously recorded in the sense that we kinda strapped on our aeroshells and departed from Earth for a while,\" Sanders told Stereogum. \"Basically we're exploring the ethereal world. We're dissecting the dark matter that dominates the universe, in a nutshell.\"\n\nSwitching out Matt Bayles for producer Brendan O'Brien (AC/DC, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots), alongside the works of King Crimson and Frank Zappa as instrumental touchstones, Mastodon's continued search for that long-desired \"fifth element\" had finally reached its lofty zenith. With the welcome addition of Dailor's melodic croon to the group's already potent lead vocal register, tracks like \"Oblivion\" and \"Divinations\" approach anthemic transcendence, pushing their weighty sonic profile into the stratosphere off the back of arresting hooks and sublime vocal harmonies.\n\nElsewhere on the record, ethereal elements combine to push their storytelling into narrative overdrive, drawing on references to paraplegia, Tzarist historical actors (\"The Czar\"), occult rituals, astral projection (\"Quintessence\"), Mephistophelean bargains (\"The Last Baron\") and sci-fi wormholes. And yet, for all its thematic density, Crack The Skye still retains a sense of playful wonder and emotional majesty, whether it be through the cathartic release of tension on \"Ghost of Karelia\" or a moving tribute to Dailor's sister Skye on the album's expansive title track.\n\nThe Dance Of Death\n\nAfter a string of critically-acclaimed records and building rich narrative-driven worlds to accentuate them, Mastodon began to feel the need for a creative reset. Following their world tour throughout 2009-2010, which included a European run with Metallica, the band began work on an entirely new creative endeavor: scoring the film adaptation of the DC comic Jonah Hex (2010).\n\nWhile the band were initially given full creative control on the project, the score and the film itself were met with several production issues and changes in composer, forcing the band to scrap the entire thing and start again. (Hinds even lamented to Vulture that the shelved material was \"some of the best s*** I've ever written in my life.\") With their creative juices now thoroughly drained and the score's final form — the Jonah Hex: Revenge Gets Ugly EP (2010) — is a pale imitation of what might have been. As a result, it's hardly surprising that Mastodon chose to strip things back at the conceptual level for their upcoming fifth studio album.\n\nThe Hunter (2011) was a lean and multi-faceted record that pulled liberally from their back catalog while also remixing stylistic influences with a sharp ear for accessibility. GRAMMY-nominated single \"Curl of the Burl\" plays out like a funked-up QOTSA, with \"Octopus Has No Friends\" and \"Dry Bone Valley\" acting as spiritual cousins to the mind-melting psych of their previous LP. Tracks like \"Blasteroid\" and \"Stargasm\" embody what Dailor describes as \"super-heavy Led Zeppelin,\" walking a fine line between meaty drop-C chugging and shimmering lead work. The cackling laughter and Moog synth-scapes that open the epic \"Creature Lives\" feel like sincere Pink Floyd worship.\n\nThe Hunter also marked the band's first time working with Californian producer Mike Elizondo (Maroon 5, Avenged Sevenfold, 50 Cent), along with the use of a sculpture titled Sad Demon Oath by woodcarver AJ Fosik for the album's artwork. And much like Remission almost a decade earlier, The Hunter has a fluid thematic focus, shifting from a tribute to Hind's brother on the title track (who died from a heart attack during a hunting trip) to digressions about birds, sex in space, and childhood video games.\n\nContinuing where The Hunter left off, Mastodon's sixth LP once again left the concept album behind in favor of more liberatory forms of expression. With band members namechecking influences as diverse as Alice in Chains, Deftones, Rush and Foo Fighters — all of whom had worked with producer Nick Raskulinecz previously — the band's transition from sludge metal lifers to outright prog- and hard rock advocates feels like a tacit no-brainer.\n\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone, Dailor describes the sonic range explored on Once More ‘Round the Sun (2014) with noticeable excitement:\n\nIt's gonna be massive and insane, lots of epic greatness. There will be lots of huge riffs and new directions. It's real weird, real math-y, real straightforward. It's up, down and all around. It's a culmination of everything for the band. The snowball keeps rolling and collecting snow.\n\nAnd yet, much like Oakland-based artist Skinner's evocative album cover — a vivid \"psychedelic nightmare painting\" of a tessellated cosmic dragon-demon figure — Once More ‘Round the Sun cycles through eerily familiar moods and themes. Opener \"Tread Lightly\" hits like the Mastodon of old; \"High Road\" contrasts crunchy, riff-heavy sections with a strong hook and Hind's flashy fret-work; \"Feast Your Eyes\" and \"Chimes at Midnight\" offer up the high-octane verses, open choruses and spacey bridges that have become the quartet's signature.\n\nThings also get weird in spots: Dailor's soaring chorus on \"The Motherload\" is one of the group's most direct attempts at a radio-rock hit — even if the single's twerk-laden video makes for a fun little head-scratcher. Later, Atlanta punks The Coathangers pop up on \"Aunt Lisa\" for a strange gang vocal section (\"Hey-ho/ Let's f****** rock and roll\"). But when Mastodon do strive for alt-metal cohesion, as on standouts \"Asleep In The Deep\" and \"Ember City,\" the results are stunning and richly textured.\n\nAt the level of theme, Once More ‘Round the Sun does feel like a bit of an oddity in the band's back catalog. While Kelliher has insisted that the album's guiding motif is death itself — aligning it spiritually with Remission and The Hunter — its compositions feel far too jubilant for this theme to resonate in any meaningful way. Still, this narrative ambiguity is far from a hindrance, as it's still one of Mastodon's best performing records and responsible for the quartet's third GRAMMY nomination.\n\nExploring The Desert And Darkness\n\nAt this point in Mastodon's journey, it might seem difficult to track their intended trajectory. Should the group further dilute their sound and abandon their abrasive edges for further crossover appeal? Or perhaps a pivot back to their sludgy roots is called for? The answer, as it turns out, is to essentially do both: Double down on the dance with death that defined their 2010s output, while also synthesizing all eras of the band into a formidable, cohesive whole.\n\nFor example, take the punchy one-two that opens Emperor of Sand (2017). \"Sultan's Curse\" — which earned the group their first GRAMMY win for Best Metal Performance — pairs Hinds' intricate leads with Kelliher's charged rhythms before bursting open into swelling melodies from Dailor and Sanders. Then, immediately chasing that shot of adrenaline with a mid-tempo alt-rocker, \"Show Yourself\" takes that Mastodon formula and promptly twists it into grungy, truck-stop radio territory.\n\nInspired by the brutal reality of cancer — including the passing of Kelliher's mother, and diagnoses for Sanders' wife and Dailor's mother — Mastodon returned to the concept album for their seventh LP, shading increasingly elaborate story elements with real-life tragedies. Unifying themes of survival and temporality, Emperor of Sand focuses on a protagonist facing a death sentence from a cruel desert sovereign, ultimately forced to wander alone in a barren wasteland and confront the grim shadow of their own mortality. As Sanders states:\n\nTo that end, the album ties into our entire discography. It's 17 years in the making, but it's also a direct reaction to the last two years. We tend to draw inspiration from very real things in our lives.\n\nLike Leviathan, Blood Mountain and Crack The Skye before it (including the return of producer Brendan O'Brien), this progressive impulse goes on to yield exhilarating results, with zig-zagging riff sections (\"Precious Stones,\" \"Word to the Wise\"), muscular bursts of aggression and emotional catharsis (\"Roots Remain,\" \"Andromeda\"), droning atmospherics, colorful synthesizers, and memorable hooks (\"Steambreather,\" \"Clandestiny,\" \"Jaguar God\").\n\nEnsuring that dedicated fans would not be left out in the cold during the creative stalemate of a global pandemic, 2020 saw the release of yet another Mastodon compilation LP. Cheekily titled Medium Rarities, the release celebrates the band's 20 year milestone by bringing together 70 minutes of previously unreleased live versions, bonus tracks, instrumentals, standalone originals and a slew of eyebrow raising covers — further adding to the quartet's versatility and prolific output.\n\nThe unreleased \"Fallen Torches\" (featuring frequent collaborator Scott Kelly) is a worthy throwback to Leviathan's might, with a devastating build-up and planet-cracking riff as a finisher. Mastodon's cover of Metallica's legendary instrumental \"Orion\" (from Master of Puppets) is faithfully rendered with just enough sludge metal kick to make it their own.\n\nOriginals like \"Cut You Up with a Linoleum Knife\" from the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (2007) soundtrack and \"White Walker\" from Game of Thrones are equally amusing: the former acts as a snotty blast of tongue-in-cheek punk-metal; the latter a plaintive and elegiac ballad fit for feuding kingdoms.\n\nWhile Medium Rarities may lack a \"cohesive whole,\" it nonetheless underscores the band's chameleonic ability to shift between various moods and styles. Notes Steve Beebee in Kerrang, \"Rather than adhering to anything so obvious as chronology it becomes a seemingly random, yet highly effective, stampede — but that's Mastodon to the core.\"\n\nAfter everything Mastodon have delivered across their prodigious career, it's fitting that their first effort for a new decade is also their most ambitious. Composed of 17 tracks and clocking in at nearly 90 minutes in length, the spellbinding double LP Hushed and Grim (2021) requires a certain level of commitment even for the most dedicated fan.\n\nWith Paul Romano returning to provide the record's moody cover — a spindly old tree, knotted with whorls and adorned with spirit animals, awash in muted hues — the band enlisted the help of Canadian producer David Bottrill (Tool, Muse, Placebo) to render each lamenting composition in evocative detail, making Hushed & Grim by far the darkest and most collaborative entry in the quartet's catalog.\n\nAs Dailor explains, themes of death and cancer once again dominated their conceptual framework:\n\n[The tree] is an afterlife mythology that when you pass away, your spirit goes into the heart of a tree and then experiences all the pillars of your life in successions of the seasons that the tree experiences. That is the way you're able to say goodbye to the natural world and move on to the next dimension. You can see a green man in the center of the tree — the heart of the tree — and that is our good friend and manager Nick John, who passed away, unfortunately, a couple of years ago. [Nick] has a lot to do with the inspiration of the album.\n\nOpener \"Pain With An Anchor\" echoes this sentiment with a sorrowful ode to the sting of defeat. Grief then turns to righteous anger on \"The Crux,\" \"Savage Lands\" and \"More Than I Could Chew,\" while the closing trio of disc one — \"Skeleton of Splendor,\" \"Teardrinker\" and \"Pushing The Tides\" (also the band's sixth and latest GRAMMY nomination for Best Metal Performance) — move swiftly from moments of melodic mourning to raging bursts of energy.\n\nElsewhere on disc two, this recognition of emotional heft results in some of the most striking Mastodon tracks ever recorded. Two Sanders-led cuts, \"Dagger\" and \"Had It All,\" flirt with the melodramatic, and border on goth-rock balladry with the addition of sarangi and French horns. Epic closer \"Gigantium\" reaches out for divine inspiration, wrapping Hind's solo work with elegiac strings and violin.\n\nOne element common to all Mastodon records is symbology. Forming part of the band's iconic typography and logo, each album features a distinct glyph that denotes the record's overarching theme: sun, fire, water, earth, aether, wood, cycles and time.\n\nAs Albert Chessa of The Mastodon Podcast argues, the symbology of Hushed & Grim and its inclusion of the \"Zenithal Crescent\" glyph helps to conceptualize all of Mastodon's work as a functional meta-narrative:\n\nIn symbolic language, the arc-form signifies both beginning (sunrise) and end (sunset), as well as evoking a pair of embracing arms — one that gives, another that takes away… Four figures on each side (past and future), viewed from bird's eye view, gather around a portal (or tomb) — an Octogram, evoking eternal rest and remembrance (∞)… Zenithal means ‘highest point' — thus, this glyph honors someone who always brought out the very best of those he loved.\n\nOf course, at the material level, Mastodon are still just four friends, sharing in their creativity and making heavy music together. Yet, what Hushed & Grim proves is that the Atlanta quartet will likely never be content with creative complacency, continuing to have surprises in store for those willing to venture beyond the music.\n\nAs Code Orange Wraps Up Tour With Korn, They Look Ahead To Headlining Stages & Making New Music: \"We Really Want To Take A Big Swing\"\n\nWhen Tom Waits warned on \"Underground,\" the first song on his transformational 1983 album Swordfishtrombones, \"there’s a rumblin’ groan down below,\" he very well could have been describing the artistic awakening that made him a legend.\n\nOnce an earnest yet good-humored singer/songwriter, Tom Waits is the rare artist in the past 50 years to successfully pull off something as radical as a complete artistic reinvention. A songwriter with a taste for the dark and grotesque as much as the theatrical, Waits has built up a catalog heavy on bizarre characters, morbid nursery rhymes, gruff junkyard blues and a uniquely unconventional take on rock music. And though it took some experimentation, trial and error and eventually getting married to arrive on the sound we hear today, he’s made a five-decade career of embracing sounds on the fringe and turning them into memorable melodies.\n\nA Southern California native who got his start playing folk clubs in San Diego before relocating to Los Angeles in the 1970s, Tom Waits debuted as a relatively conventional singer/songwriter with a twinge of blues and jazz in his bones. And where his earliest records found him singing with more of a raspy croon, he adopted a vocal growl more spiritually akin to Louis Armstrong and Captain Beefheart.\n\nWaits never quite fit in alongside peers such as Jackson Browne or James Taylor. His instincts often pushed himself somewhere a little dirtier and darker, favoring tales of vagabonds and outcasts told with an inebriated sentimentality and irreverent humor. Throughout his decades-long career, the two-time GRAMMY winner never let go of the emotional honesty in his songwriting.\n\nWaits has joked that he makes two types of songs: grim reapers and grand weepers. The former became his staple sound in the 1980s after he married longtime creative partner Kathleen Brennan and began his decade-long tenure on Island Records, which still occasionally found him returning to the latter via less frequent but no less disarming ballads.\n\nWhat once was a songbook reflective of the bars and familiar streets evolved into surreal dens of iniquity and theaters of the grotesque. Waits' knack for storytelling and character development only strengthened over the years, even as his songs took more oddball and ominous shape. Swordfishtrombones' \"Sixteen Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six\" follows a hunter following a crow into a Moby Dick-like epic; spoken word standout \"What’s He Building In There?,\" from 1999’s Mule Variations, prompts the listener to ponder who’s really up to no good.\n\nThough his record sales have been modest, Waits' songs have been covered by the likes of Rod Stewart and Eagles, and he’s collaborated with everyone from Bette Midler to Keith Richards. His songwriting and unique musical aesthetic have influenced records by Andrew Bird, Neko Case, Morphine and PJ Harvey.\n\nAs Waits’ acclaimed series of albums on Island Records from the ‘80s and ‘90s are being reissued in remastered form — some for the first time on vinyl in decades — GRAMMY.com revisits the legendary singer/songwriter’s significant body of work via each of his studio albums. Press play on the Spotify playlist below, or visit Apple Music, Pandora, and Amazon Music to enter Waits' sonic wonderland of '70s era ballads and his plethora of twisted narratives and experimental sounds.\n\nThe Barroom Balladeer\n\nThough often treated to his own idiosyncratic filter, Waits’ early output in the ‘70s reflected the glamor and sleaze of his Los Angeles surroundings.\n\nClosing Time (1973)\n\nMaking his debut at the height of the ‘70s singer/songwriter boom, Tom Waits revealed only slight glimpses of his myriad idiosyncrasies on 1973’s Closing Time. Heavily composed of ballads, the album’s sound is a result of a compromise between Waits’ own preference for more jazz-leaning material and producer Jerry Yester’s penchant for folk.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, that creative tension, Closing Time has a unique character. A sense of wanderlust and escape within its 12 piano-based songs feels like a jazzier, West Coast counterpart to Bruce Springsteen. Waits imbues the call of the road with a sense of melancholy on gorgeous opener \"Ol’ 55\" and gives a hefty tug at the heartstrings on the aching \"Martha.\" He kicks up the tempo on \"Ice Cream Man.\" Closing Time is often at its best when it’s more quietly haunting, like on the bluesy \"Virginia Avenue.\"\n\nThough the album didn’t initially garner much critical or commercial attention, it’s since become regarded as one of the finest moments of Waits’ early recordings. It also quickly earned the respect and admiration of other artists, with various songs from Closing Time being covered by Bette Midler, Eagles and Tim Buckley.\n\nThe Heart of Saturday Night (1974)\n\nAfter establishing himself with the romantic ballads of his debut album, Waits waded deeper into the waters of boho jazz and beat poetry in its follow-up, The Heart of Saturday Night.\n\nWaits shares his perspective from the piano bench and the barstool, occasionally delving into a sing-speak delivery against upright bass and brushed-drum backing. Throughout, Waits serves up colorfully embellished imagery about nights on the town and getting soused on the moon. Though not as experimental or sophisticated as some of his later recordings, The Heart of Saturday Night nonetheless finds Waits in a more playful mood, more overtly showcasing his sense of humor and penchant for a particular kind of down-and-out protagonist. Fittingly, the album's title track was directly inspired by Jack Kerouac.\n\nThe Heart of Saturday Night is somewhat autobiographical in that it’s one of the few albums that repeatedly features references to his youth growing up in San Diego. Most famously on \"San Diego Serenade,\" as well as in his narrative of driving through Oceanside in \"Diamonds on My Windshield,\" and his name-drop of Napoleone’s Pizza House, the pizzeria in National City where he worked as a teenager, in \"The Ghosts of Saturday Night.\"\n\nNighthawks at the Diner (1975)\n\nAs Tom Waits further established himself as a singer/songwriter more at home in the naugahyde and second-hand smoke of a seedy nightclub than a folk festival, he sought to replicate the atmosphere of a jazz club on his third album. It’s not a live album in a literal sense; Waits invited a small crowd into the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles on two nights in July of 1975, and though the venue is artifice, the crowd reactions are genuine.\n\nMore heavily rooted in jazz than Waits’ first two albums, Nighthawks at the Diner mostly follows a particular pattern: An \"intro\" track featuring some witty barfly banter, followed by an actual song. Introducing each song with a round of inebriated wordplay (\"you’ve been standing on the corner of Fifth and Vermouth,\" \"Well I order my veal cutlet, Christ, it just left the plate and walked down to the end of the counter…\") is a bit of a gimmick, yet for all its loose, freewheeling feel, the album features some of his best early songs, including \"Eggs and Sausage,\" \"Warm Beer and Cold Women\" and \"Big Joe and Phantom 309.\"\n\nReleasing a manufactured live album early on proved a canny gambit for Tom Waits and resulted in his highest charting album up to that date. And it’s easy to see why: Nighthawks showcased the raconteur persona that’d come to define much of Waits' work to come.\n\nThe Bluesy Bohemian\n\nEmbracing a grittier sound and a more character-driven approach to storytelling, Tom Waits entered a period of creative growth in the second half of the ‘70s that saw him balancing a darker tone with a wry sense of humor.\n\nSmall Change (1976)\n\nOn his second and third albums, a jazz influence and increasingly prominent humor saw Waits developing not just as a distinctive personality, but as a character. His raspy growl deepened onSmall Change, as Waits' barfly persona finds himself in increasingly seedier surroundings. This new area is best showcased through the amusingly unsexy striptease scat of \"Pasties and a G-String\" and the surreal and misty eyed \"The Piano Has Been Drinking.\"\n\nSmall Change isn’t nearly as jokey as the previous year’s Nighthawks at the Diner, but Waits carries a persistent smirk as he rattles through a laundry list of hucksterish advertising slogans in the carnival-barker beat jazz of \"Step Right Up\": \"It gets rid of unwanted facial hair, It gets rid of embarrassing age spots, It delivers the pizza.\" He even ramps up an element of danger in the noir poetry of \"Small Change (Got Rained on With His Own .38)\".\n\nStill, the heartache and romance remains within the album’s best ballads, including the gorgeous opener \"Tom Traubert’s Blues\" and the imagined depiction of a lonely waitress in \"Invitation to the Blues.\"\n\nForeign Affairs (1977)\n\nTom Waits’ fifth album Foreign Affairs unexpectedly became one of his most consequential releases.\n\nA rare Waits album that opens with an instrumental (\"Cinny’s Waltz\"), Foreign Affairs finds him taking on more narrative driven songwriting, as in the lengthy noir tale of \"Potter’s Field\" and the nostalgic road-movie recollection of \"Burma-Shave.\" It seems fitting that this is the moment where Hollywood began to crack a door open for Waits — these songs sound like they were made for the silver screen.\n\nIndeed, album standout \"I Never Talk to Strangers,\" a duet with Bette Midler, inspired Francis Ford Coppola’s 1981 film One From the Heart. Waits wrote and performed on its soundtrack, and would work with Coppola multiple times.\n\nBlue Valentine (1978)\n\nParallels between Waits' music and his acting career crop up throughout , beginning with 1978’s Blue Valentine. Released the same year that he made his acting debut in Paradise Alley — cast as a piano player named Mumbles, an apt role to be sure — Blue Valentine opens with a big, cinematic number itself, Rodgers and Hammerstein’s \"Somewhere,\" the famous ballad from West Side Story.\n\nBlue Valentine also finds Waits in character development mode, increasingly populating his bluesy and bedraggled songs with widows and bounty hunters, night clerks and scarecrows wearing shades. It also features one of his most heartbreaking songs in \"Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis,\" in which Waits’ first-person epistle comes from the voice of the title character who reaches out to an old friend in a hopeful and warm update on the changes she’s made for the better. And then he seamlessly, devastatingly pulls out the rug from underneath it all, as only a fabulist like Tom Waits can.\n\nHeartattack and Vine (1980)\n\nThe transition from one decade to the next couldn’t have been starker for Tom Waits as he entered the 1980s. His final album for Asylum Records seemed to signal a sea change, with its leadoff track steeped in scuzzy, distorted guitar and gruff blues-rock rather than piano balladry, jazz and beat poetry.\n\nHeartattack and Vine is in large part more of a proper rock record than any of Waits’ earlier albums, as he lends his husky growl to gritty songs such as \"Downtown\" and \"In Shades.\" Still, it’s the most tender moments that comprise some of Heartattack and Vine’s most enduring songs, such as \"On the Nickel\" and, in particular, \"Jersey Girl,\" covered four years later by the Garden State’s own Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe Avant-Garde Auteur\n\nTom Waits underwent a significant transformation in the 1980s, mostly leaving behind the smoky jazz-club ballads of the ‘70s in favor of a more avant garde take on rock music, rife with an arsenal of unconventional instruments.\n\nSwordfishtrombones (1983)\n\nThe most dramatic shift in Tom Waits’ career came with the release of 1983’s Swordfishtrombones, his first release for Island Records and the first album of what came to be the sound most often associated with Waits. It’s rougher, rawer, more experimental and offbeat. A great deal of the credit goes to Waits’ wife, Kathleen Brennan, who introduced him to artists like Captain Beefheart and who became his creative partner, co-writing many of his best-known songs.\n\nWaits trades the piano and strings of his earlier material for arrangements better fit for junkyard jam sessions and New Orleans funerals. Though he’s delivered a long list of releases that have since usurped such a title, Swordfishtrombones certainly sounded like his weirdest album at the time. Very little of it sounded like a conventional pop song;it’s interwoven with spoken-word pieces both hilarious and unnerving (\"Frank’s Wild Years,\" \"Trouble’s Braids\"), instrumentals (\"Dave the Butcher,\" \"Rainbirds\"), boneyard bashers (\"Underground,\" \"16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six\") and even a few tender ballads (\"Johnsburg, Illinois,\" \"Town With No Cheer\").\n\nThough arguably far less commercial than anything he’d released prior, Swordfishtrombones still cracked the bottom half of the album charts. It also received the attention of critics, who praised Waits’ bold new direction and unconventional stylistic choices.\n\nRain Dogs (1985)\n\nFor much of the 1970s, Tom Waits took inspiration from the seamier side of Los Angeles, with occasional sentimental nods to his youth further south along Interstate 5 in San Diego. With 1985’s Rain Dogs, however, he relocated to New York City to capture an even grimier and grittier album inspired by its outcasts and outlaws.\n\nRecorded in what was then a rough part of Manhattan in 1984, Rain Dogs continues the stylistic experimentation of Swordfishtrombones with an unusual array of instruments for a rock album, including marimba, trombone and accordion, the latter of which opens the title track in dramatic fashion with an incredible solo.\n\nRain Dogs also began Waits’ long collaborative relationship with Marc Ribot, whose guitar playing helps craft the album's signature sound. Through his Cuban jazz-inspired playing on \"Jockey Full of Bourbon\" and the scratchy and dissonant solo on \"Clap Hands.\" Yet the album also finds him in the company of Keith Richards, whose licks appear on the album’s most famous song, \"Downtown Train,\" which became a hit for Rod Stewart when he covered it in 1991.\n\nRain Dogs features Waits’ first co-writing credit from Brennan, brought dded gravitas to the aching ballad \"Hang Down Your Head.\" It’s one of a few moments that cuts through the carnivalesque atmosphere of the album (see the demented nursery rhyme \"Cemetery Polka,\" the crime-scene poetry of \"9th and Hennepin\" and the litany of misfortunes in \"Gun Street Girl\"). IRain Dogs is Tom Waits perfecting his approach, completing a stylistic transformation with one of his greatest batches of songs.\n\nFrank’s Wild Years (1987)\n\nOne of the highlights of Waits’ 1983 album Swordfishtrombones was a humorous spoken-word jazz interlude wrapped up in a David Lynch nightmare, titled \"Frank’s Wild Years,\" in which the titular Frank settles down into a suburban lifestyle, only to set his house on fire and drive off with the flames reflecting in his rearview mirror. Those 115 seconds or so were enough for Waits and Brennan to spin the idea out into a stage play, with this album serving as its soundtrack. (Its original cast at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre included Gary Sinise and Laurie Metcalf.)\n\nFrank’s Wild Years likewise comprises songs performed in the play, though without the context of knowing its origins, it doesn’t so easily scan as a set of songs written for the stage. It continues the aesthetic vision that Waits pursued on his two previous Island Records albums, steeped in Weill-ian cabaret and mangled lounge-jazz renditions, like in the hammy Vegas version of \"Straight to the Top.\" Waits continues to run wild stylistically, however, veering from junkyard blues-rock in opener \"Hang On St. Christopher\" to the tenderness of the lo-fi 78-style recording of closing ballad \"Innocent When You Dream.\"\n\nFifteen years after its release, \"Way Down in the Hole,\" was given a second life as the theme for the HBO drama \"The Wire,\" each season featuring a different artist’s rendition of the song. Waits’ original scores the opening credits for season two.\n\nBone Machine (1992)\n\nThe title of Tom Waits’ tenth album fairly accurately sums up the sound of the record, which finds Waits incorporating heavier use of curious forms of percussion, many of them he played himself. Opening track \"Earth Died Screaming\" even resembles the sound of bones clanking against each other as Waits growls his way through an apocalyptic nightmare.\n\nIt’s fitting that Bone Machine coincided with Waits’ appearance as Renfield in Francis Ford Coppola’s Bram Stoker’s Dracula. A macabre sensibility and grotesque narratives permeate this record:Acts of violence become a form of entertainment in \"In the Colosseum,\" and he retells an actual story of a grisly homicide in \"Murder in the Red Barn.\" There’s levity too, like in the delusions of a fame-seeker in the rowdy \"Goin’ Out West,\" which, along with half the songs on the album, was co-written by Brennan.\n\nEerie and macabre as Bone Machine is, it earned Waits his first GRAMMYAward, for Best Alternative Music Album in 1993. Likewise, the Ramones covered standout track \"I Don’t Wanna Grow Up\" three years later on their final album ¡Adios Amigos!; Waits repaid the favor in 2003 with a cover of the band’s \"Return of Jackie and Judy.\"\n\nThe Storyteller’s Songbook\n\nDeeper into the ‘90s and ‘00s, Waits became more active in writing music for the theatrical stage, albeit filtered through his own peculiar lens. He also closed out the ‘90s with his longest album, helping to usher in a late-career renaissance.\n\nThe Black Rider (1993)\n\nThe soundtrack to a theatrical production,The Black Rider closed Waits' tenure with Island Records with the soundtrack to a theatrical production. Though his music appeared in films by the likes of Jim Jarmusch and Francis Ford Coppola, and he entered the world of theater with Frank’s Wild Years, this was his released composed in collaboration with playwright Robert Wilson — they would work on three productions together — based on German folktale Der Freischütz. In fact, Waits affects his best German accent in the title track, in which he beckons, \"Come on along with ze black rider, we’ll have a gay old time!\"\n\nHighlights \"Flash Pan Hunter,\" \"November\" and \"Just the Right Bullets\" juxtapose distorted barks against ramshackle arrangements of plucked banjo, clarinet and singing saw. , The structure of the album — rife with interludes, instrumentals and reprises — sets it apart from any of his prior works, leaving room for the listener to fill in the visual blanks.\n\nMule Variations (1999)\n\nThe release of Mule Variations coincided with the launch of Anti- Records, an offshoot of L.A. punk label Epitaph that was more focused on legacy artists in a variety of genres. This also resulted in the unlikely instance of a song by Tom Waits appearing on one of Epitaph’s famed Punk-O-Rama compilations, which typically featured selections by the likes of skatepunk icons NOFX and Pennywise.\n\nThe longest studio album in Waits’ catalog, Mule Variations makes good on a six-year gap by being stacked with an eclectic selection of songs, most of them co-written with Brennan (who also co-produced the album). From the lo-fi beatbox bark that blows open the doors of leadoff track \"Big In Japan,\" Waits essentially takes a tour through a disparate but cohesive set of songs that feels like a career summary, from tent-revival blues (\"Eyeball Kid\"), to devastating balladry (\"Georgia Lee\") and rapturous gospel (\"Come On Up to the House\").\n\nA new generation of TikTok users received an introduction to this album via a meme featuring the album’s \"What’s He Building In There?\", an eerie spoken-word track from the perspective of a paranoid, busybody neighbor that became an unlikely viral sensation.\n\nBlood Money & Alice (2002)\n\nAnother collaboration with playwright/director Robert Wilson, Blood Money and Alice were released on the same day in 2002. Co-written by Brennan, both are the soundtracks to two plays, the former based on an unfinished Georg Büchner play Woyzeck and the latter an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nBlood Money is darker and harsher in tone, kicking off with the satirically pessimistic \"Misery is the River of the World,\" and featuring highlights such as the obituary mambo of \"Everything Goes to Hell\" and the charmingly tender \"All the World Is Green.\"\n\nAlice — whose songs had been circulated for years in bootlegs in rougher form — is more subdued and strange, its gorgeously lush and haunting opening ballad an opening into a head-spinning world of Lewis Carroll surrealism and disorientation. \"Kommienezuspadt\" soundtracks White Rabbit hijinks through German narration and Raymond Scott machinations, \"We’re All Mad Here\" lends a slightly darker shadow to an uneasy tea party, and \"Poor Edward\" diverts slightly from Carroll canon to visit the story of Edward Mordrake, a man born with a face on the back of his head.\n\nThe Catalog Continues…\n\nThough Waits hasn’t been quite as prolific in the past two decades as he had been from the ‘70s through the late ‘90s, he continued to refine and evolve his strange and uncanny sound, while sharing a triple-album’s worth of rare material that offered a wide view of his evolution over the prior two decades.\n\nReal Gone (2004)\n\nWaits maintained his prolific streak with the lengthy Real Gone, which featured 16 songs and spans nearly 70 minutes — just a hair shorter than his longest, Mule Variations. It’s also the rare Tom Waits album to feature no piano or organ, its melodies primarily provided via noisier guitar from Harry Cody, Larry Taylor and longtime collaborator Marc Ribot, along with contributions from Primus bassist Les Claypool and Waits’ own son, Casey, who provides percussion and turntable scratches.\n\nReal Gone is, at its wildest, the most abrasive record in Waits’ catalog, clanging and clapping and clattering through uproarious standouts such as the supernatural mambo of \"Hoist That Rag,\" the CB-radio squawk of \"Shake It\" and creepy-crawly stomp \"Don’t Go Into That Barn,\" one of his better scary stories to tell in the dark. He leaves a little room to ease back on dirges like the haunting \"How’s It Gonna End\" and the subtly gorgeous \"Green Grass,\" but every corner of the album is populated by outsized characters and ominous visions that seem larger than ever.\n\nOrphans: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards (2006)\n\nA career as long and fruitful as that of Tom Waits is bound to leave some material on the cutting room floor, the likes of which is compiled on the triple-disc set Orphans. Composed of non-album material that stretches all the way back to the 1980s, it’s divided into three distinctive themes: Brawlers, a disc of rowdier rock ‘n’ roll and blues material; Bawlers, a set of ballads; and Bastards, made up of what doesn’t fit into the other two categories — essentially Waits’ most fringe, peculiar music.\n\nIn drawing the focus toward each distinctive type of songs, Waits lets listeners experience more intensive, discrete aspects of his music. It’s the \"Bastards,\" however, that tap into the extremes of Waits’ unique talents, comprising strange and macabre storytelling, unintelligible barks, even a wildly distinctive take on \"Heigh Ho,\" from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nSome of these songs had previously been released in some fashion — many of them appearing on movie soundtracks as well as collaborative efforts like Sparklehorse’s \"Dog Door\" — Orphans speaks to how productive he’s been over the past 40 years.\n\nBad As Me (2011)\n\nTom Waits’ final album (so far) hit shelves 12 years ago, the aftermath of which opened up his longest stretch without any new music since he began releasing records. Yet Bad As Me only offers the suggestion that Waits still has plenty of energy and inspiration left in the tank, as the album — released when he was 61 years old — comprises some of the hardest rocking material he’s ever committed to tape. It’s an album heavy on rowdy rock ‘n’ roll guitar, including that of Keith Richards, who had also previously lent his guitar playing to 1985’s Rain Dogs, as well as longtime collaborator Marc Ribot and Los Lobos’ David Hidalgo. Waits mostly adheres to concise, charged-up barnburners such as \"Let’s Get Lost,\" \"Chicago\" and the more politically charged anti-war song \"Hell Broke Luce.\" Though when Waits does ease off the throttle on songs like the eerie \"Talking at the Same Time,\" the results are often spectacular.\n\nIf Tom Waits were to simply leave this as the end of his recorded legacy, it’d be a satisfying closing statement, though the closing ballad \"New Year’s Eve\" — ending on a brief round of \"Auld Lang Syne\" — would suggest new beginnings ahead of him. As it turns out, Bad As Me isn’t intended to be his last; earlier this year he confirmed that, for the first time in over a decade, he’s been working on writing new songs.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Wilco’s Discography, From Alt-Country To Boundary-Shattering Experiments"
