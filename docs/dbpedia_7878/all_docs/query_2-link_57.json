        "text": "photo & text by nacrowe\n\nin the immediate wake of the CULTURAL TSUNAMI that was NIRVANA's NEVERMIND (DGC, 1991) release, a slew of UNDERGROUND bands from DINOSAUR JR (SIRE), MUDHONEY (REPRISE), THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS (CAPITOL), DANIEL JOHNSTON (REPRISE), HELMET (INTERSCOPE), BAD RELIGION (ATLANTIC), DRIVE LIKE JEHU (INTERSCOPE), JESUS LIZARD (CAPITOL), TAD (WARNER BROS), ROYAL TRUX (VIRGIN), BOREDOMS (REPRISE), WEEN (INTERSCOPE), THE AFGHAN WHIGS (ELEKTRA & COLUMBIA) and MELVINS (ATLANTIC) were absurdly signed to major labels in short order who no doubt had ELEVATED ambitions of FINANCIALLY cashing-in on this UNIQUE GENERATIONAL PHENOMENON. in retrospect it is a testament to the POP CULTURE influence of KURT COBAIN at the time that bands as EXPERIMENTAL and seemingly UNCONVENTIONAL as these would even get a foot in the door, much less a record deal with INTERNATIONAL distribution.\n\nsuch is the case with MELVINS and their major label debut HOUDINI (ATLANTIC, 1993), which is now considered a SLUDGE METAL classic. COBAIN, a former MELVINS ROADIE and SUPER-FAN, himself was listed as a co-PRODUCER on six tracks but GUITARIST and SINGER-SONGWRITER BUZZ OSBORNE has attested in recent years that such was a formality as the CELEBRATED NIRVANA frontman was sadly high on narcotics for most of the sessions leaving RECORDING ENGINEER GGGARTH to effectively take over the proceedings. that being said, HOUDINI's association with COBAIN garnered it some cache back in the day when everyone was waiting on the follow-up to NEVERMIND. it is the DIZZYING height of irony that COBAIN, who learned and lived the stridently INDEPENDENT DIY ETHOS of the PUNK ROCK lifestyle via his involvement with ABERDEEN hometown heroes in the MELVINS, was the EFFECTIVE reason they were afforded the opportunity to branch out into the MAINSTREAM via ATLANTIC RECORDS.\n\nregardless, the UNRELENTING SONIC BRUTALITY of absolutely PUMMELING tracks like \"NIGHT GOAT,\" \"HOOCH\" and \"HONEY BUCKET\" is just SIGNATURE MELVINS. along with OZMA (BONER, 1989) and STONER WITCH (ATLANTIC, 1994), its effectively the sound that spawned HIGH ON FIRE, MASTODON, BORIS, TORCHE, SUNN O))), KYLESA and COUNTLESS SLUDGE, STONER and DOOM METAL bands galore. such a legacy is CURIOUS given their close association with SEATTLE and the ALTERNATIVE ROCK movement of that era, especially local LIKE-MINDED fellow \"DEEP SIX\" bands in SOUNDGARDEN, GREEN RIVER, THE U-MEN, SKIN YARD and MALFUNKSHUN. in essence MELVINS are an SINGULAR group in the HISTORY and LINEAGE of that scene. so effectively the MELVINS have an artfully AGGRESSIVE SONIC AESTHETIC that has long straddled MULTIPLE GENRES and influenced many SUBSEQUENT ACTS. but i think the one thing that hasnt been replicated is their LYRICAL EMBRACE of the ABSURD, mocking the countervailing \"HONESTY\" and \"AUTHENTICITY\" posturing that ALTERNATIVE ROCK FIGUREHEADS so readily and unironically embraced as a means of countering their PUNK ROCK guilt for jumping into bed with a major.\n\nfor OSBORNE and drummer DALE CROVER they had nothing to be ashamed of and thus took it all in stride, lyrically creating almost WEEN-esque DADA FREE-ASSOCIATION experiments with no real COHERENT message. the music was the point. the MELVINS only lasted two more albums on ATLANTIC before being dropped and permanently going back to INDEPENDENT labels, but they milked the situation for all it was worth and were one of the few BANDS BUSINESS SAVVY-enough to not be defined artistically or commercially by their fleeting dalliance with the majors. they went into the relationship expecting it to end and planned accordingly. and they have remained successfully SELF-SUSTAINING to date.\n\nfor me HOUDINI is an ESSENTIAL release from the 1990s ALTERNATIVE ROCK era despite its RELATIVE OBSCURITY with no big hits or singles to speak of. but like THE STOOGES or THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, its importance lays in the next generation of MUSICIANS that were exposed to it and initiated their own bands accordingly. most definitely worth checking out, especially as a decent introduction to this ICONIC GROUP.\n\nparodies by nacrowe\n\nback in 7th grade when i was living and going to school in NIGERIA, a classmate's mother of all things had a side hustle where she imported compact discs from EUROPE and sold them out of kiosk at a shopping center. i am almost positive that such was where i took a chance on the DELIVERANCE (COLUMBIA, 1994) album by this band id never heard of called CORROSION OF CONFORMITY. in essence, those WIDE-OPEN, DETUNED POWER CHORDS played over that TEMPO pulled way back was my introduction to SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK, given that PEPPER KEENAN is arguably at the origins of both SOUNDALIKE genres.\n\nto my understanding, SLUDGE METAL is a NEW ORLEANS concoction inspired by the likes of the MELVINS and all things DOOM METAL to create a SLOW-COOKED gumbo of DOWN-TEMPO GROOVE by the likes of CROWBAR and EYEHATEGOD. STONER ROCK on the other hand is a FUZZED-OUT PUNK ROCK variant that likewise utilized SLOWER TEMPOS and DETUNED GUITARS to assist in aurally describing the huge expanse of SPACE that was the MOJAVE DESERT at nighttime where bands like KYUSS played generator parties. the difference between SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK is nuanced but it is there, yet the sounds have both influenced COUNTLESS modern METAL bands that take that WEIGHTY SONIC TEMPLATE and utilize it to provide HEFT and MASS to their SOUND. this is in direct contrast to what MASTERS OF REALITY main-man CHRIS GOSS (and one of the PALM DESERT SCENE architects of the STONER ROCK sound) derided as \"TYPEWRITER METAL\" in which METAL bands like MEGADETH and SLAYER played LIGHTNING-FAST SINGLE-NOTE ARPEGGIATED RHYTHMS that galloped their way through a song with little FEEL or GROOVE. in that sense, having the patience in letting the song actually breathe and articulate its feel in good time is the sonic contribution of these two LIKE-MINDED genres.\n\ni hear the influence in METALCORE bands like CANCER BATS, ARCHITECTS, CAVE IN, LAMB OF GOD, CODE ORANGE and AVENGED SEVENFOLD as well as POST HARDCORE acts like GLASSJAW, AT THE DRIVE-IN, REFUSED and THRICE, all of whom vary TEMPO, FEEL and GROOVE to SPECTACULAR effect.\n\nembedded below is a recent DEER GOD RADIO episode on nonprofit internet radio station MAKERPARKRADIO.NYC that includes a playlist celebrating my FAVORITE SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK bands. enjoy!\n\nphoto manipulation by nacrowe\n\nmost bands, whatever their AESTHETIC or scene affiliations, are involved on some level of paying homage to their own PUBLIC PERSONA. deep in there somewhere is a nugget of personality or marketing that separates them from their peers. for me the MELVINS HASTILY-EDITED tour documentary MELVINS: ACROSS THE USA IN 51 DAYS (IPECAC, 2015) is all about DISMANTLING whatever ROMANTIC notions you had left of the touring ROCK AND ROLL lifestyle.\n\nshot on what has to be camera phones by various members and edited in the most RUDIMENTARY of styles with varying sound quality, this on the face of it is FILM VERITE gone HORRIBLE. it follows the band on their 2012 as they attempted to break a world record of playing 51 shows in all 50 states (and WASHINGTON DC) in 51 days. that sounds AWESOME in theory but what you find in practice is a BRUTAL, fiendishly FAST-PACED touring schedule that delivers them to CIVIC AUDITORIUMS, VFW HALLS, COMMUNITY CENTERS and TINY THEATERS the throughout the country. you get to see the firsthand the SKETCHY TRUCK STOPS and UNINVITING ROADSIDE RESTAURANTS along small FORGOTTEN faraway bastions of the continental UNITED STATES. which make you feel ISOLATED just watching it and questioning yourself over and over again: why do this to yourself? honestly, why?\n\nand that is why this documentary is VITAL. this is not BOB DYLAN in '66 or THE ROLLING STONES in '72 or even LED ZEPPELIN in '77, this is rural AMERICA up close and UNADORNED. reminds me of my two trips to IOWA (don't ask) and how the minute i landed their i immediately felt a surge of REGRET and FEAR of being deserted unlike anything else i've experienced before or since. and that includes traveling in remote villages in AFRICA, SOUTHEAST ASIA and THE BALKANS.\n\nthere is nothing remotely SEXY or INVITING about this film, its all FRUSTRATION and huamn SUFFERING and that is why it is absolutely required viewing in my opinion. probably one of the more HONEST accounts of touring life i have seen in years if ever.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nits not a big secret that PANTERA frontman PHIL ANSELMO joined that TEXAN group with a bevy of influences that veered well past the NWOBHM, THRASH and GLAM-inspired 80s METAL that the band had been rehashing up until that point. this included a pronounced HARDCORE AESTHETIC, not to mention a penchant for BLACK METAL, DEATH METAL and what would become SLUDGE METAL out of his hometown in NEW ORLEANS.\n\nin-between the cycles for FAR BEYOND DRIVEN (EASTWEST, 1994) and THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL (EASTWEST, 1996), ANSELMO pursued a NOTABLE side-project in DOWN that was a veritable ALL-STAR lineup of the burgeoning NEW ORLEANS SLUDGE METAL scene that included PEPPER KEENAN of CROSSOVER HARDCORE band CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, KIRK WINDSTEIN of CROWBAR and JIMMY BOWER of EYEHATEGOD. their debut NOLA (EASTWEST, 1995) is a watershed moment in METAL history as it is a SEAMLESS CONFLUENCE of influences from SOUTHERN ROCK to STONER ROCK and of course, SLUDGE METAL. their sound is in a lot of ways the antithesis of PANTERA, whose records were METICULOUSLY PRODUCED with a sense of unmatched GROOVE, INTENSITY and TECHNICALITY. DOWN had a UNIQUE SOUND and SONGWRITING AESTHETIC that was more laid back (and even loose) that really seemed to revel in the EMOTIVE power of a DISTORTED guitar through a BLOWN-OUT speaker in a manner later mined by POST METAL bands like SUN O))) and ISIS. tracks like \"BURY ME IN SMOKE,\" \"LIFER,\" \"STONE THE CROW,\" \"REHAB,\" and \"TEMPTATION'S WINGS\" find ANSELMO singing in a manner somewhat devoid of the HYPER-MASCULINE posturing of his other famous outfit.\n\ni remember in 2001 when PANTERA broke up and ANSELMO pursued a string of perceived side projects like SUPERJOINT RITUAL, VIKING CROWN, CHRIST INVERSION and so on that played up his passion for various METAL sub-genres. the understanding by fans was that such was a temporary DISTRACTION before the next PANTERA record when inevitably come. obviously that never happened and the communication between ANSELMO, bassist REX BROWN and the ABBOTT BROTHERS deteriorated to NOTHING. it was a real pity because if anything NOLA provided an INTERESTING calming aside from the CAUSTIC BRUTALITY that was THE GREAT SOUTHERN TRENDKILL. felt like that debut DOWN record was a worthwhile pursuit and something he had to get out of his system, as well as shed light on a much CELEBRATED adjacent scene in LOUISIANA. it should also be said that DIMEBAG and VINNIE PAUL were friends with all these dudes as well and understood the benefit of giving each other space. that was hack when the band communicated. 1996 saw ANSELMO overdose on heroin after a DALLAS PANTERA show and that pretty much was the beginning of the end of that open correspondence.\n\nwhen i listen to DOWN i hear an artist on a white hot streak at the pinnacle of their powers and i see a potential that never came to pass, at least with PANTERA. DOWN would continue to make absolutely SICK SLUDGE METAL records to date, but they are cursed to being perceived publicly as a PANTERA side project even decades after that former bands IMPLOSION.\n\nNOLA is required listening for any METAL fan. its a VERITABLE MASTERCLASS of how much POWER there is in taking the TEMPO and pulling it way way back in the name of GROOVE.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\ni believe i first came across the DELIVERANCE (SONY, 1994) album by CORROSION OF CONFORMITY while in middle school in NIGERIA after being introduced to the band by a LEBANESE 9th grader. the dude was into PORNO FOR PYROS so i thought for sure this other band was a sure bet. and they were.\n\n​DELIVERANCE is an interesting album in that it splits the difference between the GARGANTUAN RIFFAGE and EXTREME DISSONANCE of SLUDGE METAL with the MELODIC LYRICISM and GUITAR WIZARDRY of classic 1970s SOUTHERN ROCK. during this phase in the group's career they very much sounded like a cross between THE ALLMAN BROTHERS and EYEHATEGOD. there is no better example than the single \"ALBATROSS\" whose mid-tempo groove is just about impossible to not nod back and forth to, and those lead lines. man, what a great song. same goes with \"BROKEN MAN,\" \"DELIVERANCE,\" \"SEVEN DAYS\" and \"SENIOR LIMPIO\" which both absolutely crush with a sense of unrelenting VENGEANCE and unadulterated WRATH while maintaining THIN LIZZY-inspired lead lines throughout.\n\ni know for O.G. fans of CORROSION OF CONFORMITY, these 1990s albums represent a capitulation to the ALTERNATIVE ROCK scene of the time. their previous work in the 1980s was seen by many as being the very definition of HARDCORE PUNK ROCK. in retrospect i find it infinitely COMPELLING to think about the predicament of HARDCORE and THRASH METAL bands that felt a sense of being OUTMODED by a scene that had its roots in both scenes. if anything, the major bands of the ALTERNATIVE ROCK movement of the early 1990s felt a kinship with these bands. as a teenager coming across DELIVERANCE i just remember being blown away by how great the songs were as well as the technical musical DEXTERITY and just BRUTALITY of the riffage, not to mention PEPPER KEENAN's incredible voice (this being his vocal debut four albums in) even when he is singing at the upper limits of his range. where they place in the pantheon of sub-genres or great METAL bands, i dont know, but DELIVERANCE seemed to be a SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT on an ARTISTIC level in my view. which i believe is saying something given that their peers in METALLICA, SLAYER and countless HARDCORE bands ended up regretting most of their output during this period.\n\ndefinitely check out DELIVERANCE if you are interested in UNCONVENTIONAL yet WELL-CONSTRUCTED METAL that is slightly on the EXPERIMENTAL side.\n\nphoto manipulation & text by nacrowe\n\nwhen you consider the longevity and wildly EXPERIMENTAL nature of the music, it is hard not to be impressed by the career of seminal SLUDGE / ALTERNATIVE ROCK / PUNK ROCK band MELVINS. as the documentary THE COLOSSUS OF DESTINY: A MELVINS TALE (HELLSMORE MEDIA, 2016) attests, the narrative of the group is very much centered around the enduring friendship and artistic alchemy between BUZZ OSBOURNE and DALE CROVER. and its interesting that the film uses said friendship as its defining unifying structure as OSBOURNE is renowned for his UNCOMPROMISING, often BRISTLY public persona. the dude no doubt comes off like a born contrarian in interviews. but in a sense that distance to public perception or press critiques is what keeps his band free to chart their own course.\n\nas a business man, OSBOURNE goes on in great detail about how producing limited run in-house publications and vinyl re-pressings is their core strategy for long-term SURVIVAL as a business venture. they acknowledge that their music is available for all in this modern digital world of streaming services and video sharing social media platforms. and that is alright. the free widespread distribution of their music is a mute point, so their focus is on artistic extensions and hands-on limited pieces for their hardcore fanbase. OSBOURNE at length defends this practice, which seems entirely reasonable to me. i cant imagine what PUNK purist would see such as beyond reproach, the dude needs to make a living.\n\nits funny that for a band that defends their art and need for control with a ZEALOUS fervor matched by few, the first thing i think of when i consider the band themselves is their unique ability to seek out collaborations. the nearest analogue to this well outside of the rock world in that id very much liken it to the NON-PRECIOUS, IMPROVISATIONAL and highly COLLABORATIVE realm of JAZZ. the documentary goes into the bands various lineups and incarnations that has included members of CLOWN ALLEY, LUSTMORD, RED KROSS, BIG BUSINESS, MR. BUNGLE and THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS as well as collaborations with everyone from JELLO BIAFRA to LEIF GARRETT. whatever incarnation, whether expanded or contracted in terms of instrumentation, it is that core musical identity of OSBOURNE and CROVER that prevails. and they are UNIQUE in that they are fearless in their ability to try anything.\n\nfor me it is that dichotomy of extreme control of their product and their RELENTLESS devotion to the COLLABORATIVE nature of music that defines their cultural significance 30 years into their career at the time of filming. its pretty ridiculous that a truly exhaustive list with the likes of JELLO BIAFRA (DEAD KENNEDYS), SCOTT KELLY (NEUROSIS), DAVID YOW (THE JESUS LIZARD), GENE SIMMONS (KISS), MIKE PATTON (FAITH NO MORE, MR. BUNGLE, FANTOMAS), J MASCIS (DINOSAUR JR), MARK ARM (MUDHONEY), JG THIRLWELL (FOETUS), CHRIS CORNELL & KIM THAYIL (SOUNDGARDEN), MATT PIKE (SLEEP, HIGH ON FIRE), KRIST NOVOSELIC (NIRVANA), PAUL LEARY & JEFF PINKUS (THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS), JOSH HOMME (QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE), KEITH MORRIS (BLACK FLAG, CIRCLE JERKS, OFF!), SCOTT \"WINO\" WEINRICH (THE OBSESSED, SAINT VITUS), BRENT HINDS & BRANN DAILOR (MASTODON), LOU BARLOW (DINOSAUR JR, SEBADOH), DONITA SPARKS (L7), KID CONGO POWERS (THE GUN CLUB, THE CRAMPS, THE BAD SEEDS), COREY TAYLOR (SLIPKNOT) and countless producers, artists and former band members who all agreed to testify to such artistic and cultural relevance in interviewed segments. it seems the secret to success is surrounding yourself like-minded people with similar values and treating your business like an extended family. despite being dropped by a major label (ATLANTIC RECORDS) after three stellar records (HOUDINI, STONER WITCH and STAG), the band had advocates and friends with independent labels (AMPHETAMINE REPTILE, IPECAC) which helped support their long-term artistic endeavors.\n\nTHE COLOSSUS OF DESTINY: A MELVINS TALE is most definitely worth checking out if you have any interest in the music of the MELVINS or their philosophy of making it in the music industry as currently constructed. their example is a powerful one, both in business and

campaign of 2019.\n\nthe hook regarding RIFF LORDS is that these famous guitarists are allotted an extended-period to not only go over their most notable riffs, but the PHILOSOPHY, THEORY and TECHNIQUE behind their composition. noteworthy participants include that of BUZZ OSBOURNE (MELVINS), NICK HEXUM (311), JADE PUGET (AFI), BILLY HOWERDEL (A PERFECT CIRCLE), LER LALONDE (PRIMUS), MARK MORTON (LAMB OF GOD) and CLAUDIO SANCHEZ (COHEED & CAMBRIA). this sort of territory has been mined for years by the likes publications like GUITAR WORLD and PREMIER GUITAR (not to mention online vendors like REVERB and SWEETWATER) for years, but the extended time and lack of an annoying an unnecessary interloctur makes this series of videos more immediate and engaging.\n\ni play guitar so this hits me right in the sweet spot of seeing some of my favorite artists talk at length about their playing. now if they could only get DAVE NAVARRO or JOHNNY MARR... here's hoping.​\n\nphoto

found them to be a bit corny because their music was essentially humorless. i mean, even SLAYER throws in some latin rhythms every once in a while just to break up the monotony. i found it to be all about brute force and this unrelenting intensity that is just pleading to be mocked. seen them a few times, however, including OZZFEST JAPAN a few years ago and HATEBREED is absolutely crushing live. brutal and intense, no levity.\n\neven though HATEBREED frontman JAMEY JASTA is a bit of a meathead (maybe guns and hunting is cool in CONNECTICUT?), he does have a captivating podcast that interviews musicians and peers from all reaches of the METAL community as evidenced with the recent participants such as of RANDY BLYTHE (LAMB OF GOD), JIMMY BOWER (EYEHATEGOD, DOWN), SAMMY DUET (GOATWHORE), BRIAN \"HEAD\" WELCH (KORN), OLA ENGLUND (THE HAUNTED), KEITH BUCKLEY (EVERY TIME I DIE / THE DAMNED THINGS) and TREVOR STRNAD (THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER) among many many others. so i will give him that.\n\nrecently they started releasing videos of these shows on YOUTUBE so definitely check them out if you are hungry for SLUDGE, DEATH, BLACK, THRASH and PROG METAL news during this never-ending quarantine.\n\nphoto manipulation by nacrowe\n\nthe VICE subsidiary NOISEY which produces content on its YOUTUBE channel dedicated to largely underground aspects of global MUSICAL CULTURE did a deep dive a few years ago with their seven-part series NOLA: LIFE DEATH & HEAVY BLUES FROM THE BAYOU (NOISEY, 2014) into the origins and legacy of SLUDGE METAL and its LOUISIANA origins.\n\nin essence this series investigated specifically that music of DOWN members and proud LOUISIANANS JIMMY BOWER (EYEHATEGOD), KIRK WINDSTEIN (CROWBAR), PEPPER KEENAN (CORROSION OF CONFORMITY), and PHIL ANSELMO (PANTERA, SUPERJOINT RITUAL) as well as members of ACID BATH and GOATWHORE among others. in essence these musicians were heavily influenced by their surroundings. rural living and laid back southern vocal affectations manifested in rhythm tempos that were decidedly relaxed and slower in cadence. this tempo shift is in direct opposition to the concurrent strains of THRASH METAL and DEATH METAL that took place in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. in case you find this a little jarring, its important to consider that JAZZ, another LOUSIANA contribution to the AMERICAN musical tradition, was rooted in the STORYVILLE red light district of NEW ORLEANS where musicians would shift their tempos to the rhythms of a brothel's occupants in lieu of securing a tip.\n\nSLUDGE METAL is a thick, brutal METAL sub-genre which traces its roots to bands like THE MELVINS (from rural WASHINGTON state) and particular BLACK SABBATH (famously from the industrial wasteland of the MIDLANDS in ENGLAND), but it is hard to argue that it found a true home in LOUISIANA. again, interesting to see how landscape, location and even linguistics impact art and music. when you consider that SLUDGE METAL has influenced the likes of the even more extreme and sonically stretched-out explorations of modern DRONE METAL and POST METAL which revel in the nuances and textures of space and distortion, it is intriguing to consider what spices have been added to that gumbo. who knows where its all heading next which is pretty exciting.\n\n​in summation, this documentary is well-constructed and worthy of further investigation if you are so inclined.\n\nparody by nacrowe\n\ni was thinking the other day about how music serves as a soundtrack to your life and how certain artists literally follow you around.\n\nfor me that band is MASTODON.\n\nLEVIATHAN (RELAPSE, 2004)\n\ni was first became aware of MASTODON in college when they were out touring their album LEVIATHAN. the album was a loose reimagining of HERMAN MELVILLE's MOBY DICK along the lines of a touring band following their dream but wishing for the comforts of home. as an ENGLISH major, how could i not love a band interested in literature? i wrote term papers to that album.\n\nCRACK THE SKYE (REPRISE/SIRE/RELAPSE, 2009)\n\ni remember listening to CRACK THE SKYE while going through the months-long process of applying for PEACE CORPS when i was living and working as a long-term-substitute teacher at STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL in NYC. when i learned that i was accepted and i had a departure date (country to specified later), i immediately thought i may be going to the UKRAINE. so given this album's RUSSIAN monarchy theme, it was only too perfect as a soundtrack to my reading of ROBERT K. MASSIE's epic NICHOLAS AND ALAEXANDRIA book centered around the doomed TSAR NICHOLAS II and his family. the sound of it fit perfectly. plus i got to see them tour this album at MADISON SQUARE GARDEN on their tour with ALICE IN CHAINS and DEFTONES. i had floor tickets. beyond sweet.\n\nTHE HUNTER (REPRISE, 2011)\n\nturns out i was assigned ALBANIA, not UKRAINE, and I was in the remote mountainous northern region of KUKES on the border with KOSOVO when THE HUNTER came out. for me this album recalls cold trips through serene mountain passages along dirt roads in the ALBANIAN ALPS where our ride would stop to allow wolf packs to cross the road. just epic. i hear it and i can still smell that mountain air.\n\nONCE MORE AROUND THE SUN (REPRISE, 2014)\n\nsomewhere between LAKE TITICACA and the AREQUIPA DESERT in PERU i was able to obtain this album by dubious methods when it released. before getting it i had just seen the SACRED VALLEY, MACHU PICCHU and COLCA CANYON with its centuries-old fields scalloped into the mountains with running streams below and hovering condors dotting the sky overhead. when i heard the album the first time i was going through the AREQUIPA DESERT (driest in the world) with severely chapped lips counting the vicunas wandering afoot untouched in the distance. the album fit the vibe of that country perfectly.\n\nEMPEROR OF SAND (REPRISE, 2017)\n\ni streamed this via youtube when it first released as i was en route to HA LONG BAY from HANOI during a trip through VIETNAM. when i hear it i think of ungodly traffic and dusty BUDDHIST temples carved into rock on elevated vistas. what a gorgeous country.\n\nMASTODON is an epic group and i feel fortunate that I got to experience their past few albums while in some pretty incredible places that more than lived up to the scale and scope of their music. i am definitely looking forward to their new release (whenever that is) which will most likely take place from an equally compelling locale: my car while driving down the GARDEN STATE PARKWAY.\n\nenjoy this DEER GOD RADIO episode on MAKERPARKRADIO.NYC from a few months back pre-PANDEMIC dedicated to MASTODON."
