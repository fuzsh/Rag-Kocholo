Last October, Mastodon frontman Troy Sanders revealed his band would be featured on an upcoming episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (which was recently re-titled for a second time to Aqua Something You Know Whatever). This past Sunday, the band’s episode, entitled “Shirt Herpes”, aired with an added bonus: a cameo by none other than Josh Homme, who previously wrote the theme for the show when it was Aqua Unit Patrol Squad One. In the episode, the always rascally Master Shake gets mixed up with an enchanted metal t-shirt, coming face-to-face with demons voiced by Homme and the band in his pursuit to keep the ultra awesome piece of clothing before it makes him just another victim of a majestic Hell dimension. Watch the full replay below (via Rock It Out! Blog).
