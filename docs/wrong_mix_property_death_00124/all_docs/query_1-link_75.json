        "text": "Full Name: Curtis Lee Mayfield\n\nProfession: R&B Singer-songwriter and Musician\n\nBiography: Curtis Mayfield was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer who came to fame as a member of The Impressions and as a solo artist, with songs like \"People Get Ready\" (1965) becoming anthems of the civil rights movement. Despite a tragic accident that left him paralyzed, Mayfield continued to create music until his death in 1999.\n\nRaised in the Cabrini-Green housing projects of Chicago, Mayfield was introduced to music through his church. He learned piano and guitar early on and formed his first group, the Alphatones, when he was 14. He then joined The Roosters, which evolved into The Impressions, achieving success and using their platform to support the civil rights movement.\n\nAs a solo artist, he released Curtis (1970), showcasing his solo talents outside of The Impressions. Mayfield reached a new level of fame with the soundtrack for Super Fly (1972), a significant success which provided a social commentary on inner-city struggles.\n\nMayfield's career was profoundly affected by an accident in 1990, leaving him paralyzed. Nevertheless, he managed to record his final album, New World Order (1996). Throughout his life, Mayfield addressed themes such as civil rights, black pride, and anti-war sentiments in his music.\n\nMayfield married twice and had 10 children. His personal experiences in Chicago's urban environment deeply influenced his music and advocacy. He continued to be notable for his distinct guitar style and high falsetto vocals.\n\nHe received numerous honors, including a Grammy Legend Award (1994) and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1995), and was twice inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nBorn: June 3, 1942\n\nBirthplace: Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nGeneration: Silent Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Horse\n\nStar Sign: Gemini"
