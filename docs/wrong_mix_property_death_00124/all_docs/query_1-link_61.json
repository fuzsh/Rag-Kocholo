        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nCurtis Mayfield, one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music, was born today in 1942. He was first known for his involvement with The Impressions then later as a solo artist. In 1990, lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, making him paralyzed from the neck down, yet he continued to record music, winning Grammys and inductions into the Rock and Roll of Fame along the way.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1953 - Elvis Presley graduated from J.C. Hulmes High School in Memphis; his graduation photo shows him to have a split curl in the middle of his forehead, later to become his trademark. Elvis was the first member of his family to graduate high school.\n\n1967 - Aretha Franklin went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with her version of the Otis Redding hit \"Respect.\"\n\n1967 - The Doors' \"Light My Fire\" was released in the U.S., where it went on to top the singles chart two months later.\n\n1967 - \"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty delta day,\" as Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge, according to the Bobbie Gentry song, \"Ode To Billie Joe.\"\n\n1970 - The Kinks' Ray Davies was forced to make a 6,000-mile round trip from New York to London and back again -- interrupting the band's American tour -- to change one word in a recording of the song, \"Lola.\" In the original recording, Davies had used the word name \"Coca-Cola\" in the lyrics, but BBC Radio refused to play the song because singing \"Coca-Cola\" could be seen as product placement, a violation of the BBC Charter forbidding advertising or sponsored programs. Davies thus changed the name \"Coca-Cola\" to the generic \"cherry cola\" for the song's single release, thereby adhering to BBC guidelines.\n\n1972 - Jethro Tull started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with Thick As A Brick.\n\n1983 - Already undergoing psychiatric treatment and suffering from voices in his head, Derek and the Dominos drummer Jim Gordon took his mother's life in their home. Gordon, who co-wrote the band's biggest hit, \"Layla\", was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n1989 - Fine Young Cannibals started a seven-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with The Raw & The Cooked. The album featured the singles \"She Drives Me Crazy\" and \"Good Thing.\"\n\n1992 - Bill Clinton, campaigning for U.S. president, made a stop on The Arsenio Hall Show where he played the Elvis Presley hit \"Heartbreak Hotel\" on the saxophone. The appearance was later seen by historians as the definitive moment when Clinton captured the support of young voters, and locked the election on charisma points.\n\n1995 - Bryan Adams started a five week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman.\" Featured in the Johnny Depp film Don Juan De Marco, it became Adams' third U.S. solo No. 1.\n\n2002 - Paul McCartney and Aretha Franklin were the performers at Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee celebrating the 50th year of her reign.\n\n2006 - Red Hot Chili Peppers were at No.1 on the UK and US album charts with Stadium Arcadium, the band's ninth studio album.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nBeat poet Allen Ginsberg, who appeared in the film for Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\" was born on this date in 1926.\n\nDrummer Mickey Finn (T. Rex) was born on this day in 1947\n\nSuzi Quatro, female rock icon, is 66.\n\nIan Hunter, Mott The Hoople vocalist, is 77.\n\nRepublica vocalist Samantha Sprackling, aka Saffron, is 48."
