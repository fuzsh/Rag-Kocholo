For the first time, this 12-inch is available as a limited edition of 1000 numbered copies on yellow colored vinyl.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nCURTOM 96557LP\n\nReissue, originally released in 1970. \"The first solo album by the former leader of the Impressions, Curtis represented a musical apotheosis for Curtis Mayfield -- indeed, it was practically the Sgt. Pepper's album of '70s soul, helping with its content and its success to open the whole genre to much bigger, richer musical canvases than artists had previously worked with. All of Mayfield's years of experience of life, music, and people were pulled together into a rich, powerful, topical musical statement that reflected not only the most up-to-date soul sounds of its period, finely produced by Mayfield himself, and the immediacy of the times and their political and social concerns, but also embraced the most elegant R&B sounds of the past. As a producer, Mayfield embraced the most progressive soul sounds of the era, stretching them out compellingly on numbers like 'Move on Up,' but he also drew on orchestral sounds (especially harps), to achieve some striking musical timbres (check out 'Wild and Free'), and wove all of these influences, plus the topical nature of the songs, into a neat, amazingly lean whole. There was only one hit single off of this record, '(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Down Below We're All Going to Go,' which made number three, but the album as a whole was a single entity and really had to be heard that way.\" --Bruce Eder, AllMusic\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2LP\n\nWHP 1448LP\n\nHistorical and exclusive live performance from the almighty Chicago soul singer, Curtis Mayfield. By 1972 the German TV show Beat Club would let famous artists stretch out and play more than just the usual one or two hits. In this case, Mayfield recorded an hour of music in a TV studio for the producers to select from. Most of this performance was lost in someone's vault for many years. The concert is from early 1972 and predates his masterpiece Superfly. You'll find several tracks from his two earlier acclaimed solo albums as well: Curtis and Roots. An astonishing performance you don't want to miss. Personnel: Curtis Mayfield - guitar, vocals; Craig McCullen - guitar; Joseph \"Lucky\" Scott - bass; Tyrone McCullen - drums; \"Master\" Henry Gibson - percussion, congas, bongos.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2LP\n\nASH 504LP"
