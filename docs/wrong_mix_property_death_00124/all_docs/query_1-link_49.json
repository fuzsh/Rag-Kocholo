        "text": "Curtis Mayfield, who has died aged 57, had one of the most achingly expressive voices in black music. His high tenor delivered some of the most significant soul music of the 1960s, and then took on a grittier edge in the 1970s as he moved, alongside Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, in the vanguard of black musicians giving voice to social and political concerns.\n\nHe was also a songwriter, producer and guitarist of distinction, whose influence crossed the barriers of popular music styles. Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart recorded a memorable version of his People Get Ready, while the Jam enthralled post-punk audiences with their pumped-up treatment of Move On Up.\n\nMayfield was born into a musical family on the north side of Chicago, where his grandmother was a leader of the Traveling Soul Spiritual Church. He made his vocal debut as a member of a gospel group, the Northern Jubilee Singers. While his later songs were resolutely secular, he always acknowledged the influence of religious music on his work, remarking that \"for message songs, I believe in gospel music very strongly, simply because gospel tunes carry a greater message and are usually very inspiring\".\n\nHe took up the guitar at the age of 10, citing as his earliest influences the Chicago blues star Muddy Waters and the Spanish virtuoso Andreas Segovia. From such disparate sources Mayfield developed a highly individual sound, which emphasised the bass strings and electronic effects such as reverb and echo.\n\nAs a teenager he formed a musical partnership with singer Jerry Butler, who he met at a gospel concert. The pair joined the rhythm & blues vocal group the Roosters, which was renamed the Impressions in 1957. At 16 he had his first hit in the American Top 20 with For Your Precious Love; Curtis wrote the words, with Butler on lead vocal.\n\nAfter Butler left to follow a solo career, Mayfield took over the leadership of the Impressions, which became a trio with tenor Fred Cash and baritone Sam Gooden. Mayfield steered them away from the street-corner symphonies of doo-wop into the emotional heart of soul music, with classics like Gypsy Woman, People Get Ready, and the anthem Amen.\n\nPeople Get Ready was one of several Mayfield songs which mirrored the civil rights messages of Martin Luther King and others. Likewise, in We're A Winner, a song many radio stations refused to play because of its overt political content, Mayfield wrote: \"No more tears do we cry/ And we've finally dried our eyes/ And we're moving on up.\"\n\nNone of the Impressions' songs made much commercial impact in Britain, but they were idolised by mods, few of whom could resist the dancefloor tug of the driving You've Been Cheatin' and Can't Satisfy. And the mod connection was picked up in the 1970s, when the Jam performed Move On Up.\n\nMayfield also became a significant influence on the development of Jamaican music. His allegorical lyrics inspired Prince Buster, while the harmonies of the Impressions left their mark on the early work of Toots and the Maytals and others.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Mayfield also wrote and produced recordings for other Chicago musicians, including Major Lance and Gene Chandler. Lance recorded the Mayfield number Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, which became a British hit in a version by Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders in 1964.\n\nIn 1968 Mayfield put into practice his belief in black American self-reliance by forming his own record label, Curtom. He left the Impressions in 1970, although he continued to write and produce for them.\n\nIn this new solo career Mayfield found inspiration in the changing social and political role of black Americans, which he voiced eloquently in a string of fine albums. This period also produced his biggest UK hit single, Move On Up, and the spectacular soundtrack to the abysmal movie Superfly. In counterpoint to the visual melodrama, he sang Freddie's Dead, an elegy for a victim of drug addiction. Both Freddie's Dead, and the title song of the film, were million-sellers in the United States. As in the 1960s, Mayfield's lyrics continued to reflect the mood of black America, notably on the 1975 album ironically titled There's No Place Like America Today.\n\nDuring the 1970s Mayfield was also in demand as a producer. He worked on albums by Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and the Pips, and the Staple Singers. In the 1980s, he moved from Chicago to Atlanta to concentrate on live work, winning himself in the process new audiences, notably in Europe. He toured Britain in 1983 and 1987, and, during the latter visit, recorded, with the Blow Monkeys, the song Celebrate (The Day After You) - which was banned by the BBC as a political attack on Mrs Thatcher.\n\nFor a time it seemed that Mayfield's message songs were no longer in tune with the feelings of his community. But as the decade turned, a new generation of rap artists acknowledged his importance, and in 1990 he re-recorded Superfly with the rapper Ice-T. Tragically, a few months later Mayfield's career was cut short when a lighting rig fell on him during a concert in Brooklyn. Three vertebrae in his neck were broken and he was left a paraplegic. He recovered enough to make one more album, New World Order. But his condition continued to deteriorate and in 1998 his right leg was amputated as a result of diabetes.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Altheida, and 10 children.\n\nCurtis Mayfield, singer, songwriter and musician, born June 3 1942; died December 26 1999"
