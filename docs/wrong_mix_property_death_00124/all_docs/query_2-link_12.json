        "text": "Few in soul music have fused gospel vision with social concern as profoundly as Curtis Mayfield. The singer-songwriter was born in Chicago in 1942, where his roots in the gospel and doo-wop scene shaped his role as the frontman of The Impressions. Formed in 1956, the group offered a stirring mix of love ballads and inspirational anthems that sparked the civil rights movement while laying the groundwork for Mayfieldâs solo career. Like the music of Marvin Gaye, Gil Scott-Heron, and Stevie Wonder, Mayfieldâs gritty progressive funk and pointed messages on Black pride and social despair epitomized the Black Power era across his most seminal solo work, namely 1970âs Curtis, 1971âs Roots, and 1972âs Superfly soundtrack. Despite his successful productions for other artists, Mayfieldâs forays into smooth soul and disco stalled in the second half of the â70s. Since his death in December 1999, the pulse of his radical soul has kept on pushing in all of Black popâinfluencing countless others in modern hip-hop and R&B."
