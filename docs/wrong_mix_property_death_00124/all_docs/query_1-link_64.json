        "text": "[Editor’s note: I’m not sure this will make sense to you by the end. It meanders. But, there are playlists and links galore, so please bear with me.]\n\nWhen I grow up, I wanna sound like Curtis Mayfield.\n\nNot as a singer. I’m not giving back all this bass. But his voice, the one he writes with? That’s what I’m going for. Curtis was so straight to the point, blessed with a keen eye for finding the shortest distance to what he was thinking or feeling. He had a gift for finding a common denominator, and not in the way people typically think of pejoratively. He didn’t find what would attract the most people. He found what connected them, what could resonate over any beat, in any time, sung by any gender.\n\nHe just seemed to get it. The delicate balance of what was worth celebrating, and what was a reason to fight. He sang and spoke with such self-esteem, such pride in his blackness and was so encouraged by what we could do together. We would, eventually, get to where we deserved to be.\n\nBut the right now of his time? Yeah, that shit kinda sucked.\n\n::Subscribe to the Bomani & Jones YouTube Channel.\n\nJust check out the two singles from Curtis, his 1970 debut LP. First was “(Don’t Worry) If There’s A Hell Below, We’re All Going To Go.” Next was “Move On Up.” For now, we’re complicit in our own destruction. But it’s cool. We’re getting it together, and we’ll do better. Of course, the “we” that’s messing everything up involves everyone. The “we” that’s getting better is black people, in a position where self-reliance is the only answer. Black folks’ cheering section would always be themselves and no one else, and not even the pessimism reinforced by reality could be allowed to shake their dedication.\n\nThat’s Curtis Mayfield in two tracks. Somehow, hope never blinded him to the truth. Even more stunning was the fact the world he lived in — centered in his hometown of Chicago — never stopped him from being hopeful.\n\nThe Chicago of his time is the one that gave birth to the one that’s so sadly violent today. Mayfield and his contemporaries came of age while so many moved from the South looking for Chicago’s opportunities, only to find themselves confined to the city. The suburbs were effectively off-limits, with freeways built for the express purpose of getting white people into town and, quickly, the hell back to their neighborhoods. They took advantage of the Federal Housing Administration’s proliferation of 30-year loans, rode with the senseless devaluation of property that came when black folks tried to integrate neighborhoods, and the result was one of the most segregated cities in America. Those who packed up everything they had in search of advancement quickly found the decks up North were stacked, too.\n\n::Receive Bomani’s Blog, Videos, and Podcast. Subscribe to The Email Jones.\n\nBut there was hope. Segregation, in an obvious-yet-peculiar way, almost begs for self-reliance. The full spectrum of blackness would be in front of you, for they were all in it together. You still feel that, to a degree, in Chicago. You can get that vibe from how different things can be just by going two blocks. With the good and bad comes the beauty of humanity, and it’s almost impossible to think things can’t get better when we’ve all got each other. People, throughout history, have proven to be every community’s most valuable resource.\n\nHere’s the thing, though — they can only be precious if appreciated as they are. That was Curtis’ most special gift, one that I see in my father that continually wows me. Both of them could appreciate the toll struggles takes on people. Even most doing their worst are doing their best. They carry burdens, struggle with obligations both self-inflicted and inherited, and largely find ways to get from day to die.\n\nThat’s the quality that makes the Superfly soundtrack so good. The story goes that Mayfield feared the movie glorified drug dealing, so he wanted to make a dark record that would reflect such a dangerous lifestyle. The trick, though, was doing so without being judgmental. The dope dealer with a heart of gold doesn’t really exist in real life. Even if the heart started as gilded, it can’t help but tarnish over time in such a world. There’s no way an honest person could portray the trade, especially as presented in Gordon Parks, Jr.’s classic film, as anything but the dope man. You could call it good because of the money and suits, or one could call it bad because of the sociopathic behavior it requires. You could be resigned, like Carl Gordon’s character, to dealing because “it’s the only game The Man left us to play.” But you couldn’t call it simple, certainly not with the pictures Mayfield painted.\n\nI leave Superfly with an admiration for his willingness to be honest, the hallmark of the Mayfield catalog. It’s not necessarily in big, heart-wrenching ways. It’s sincerity tinged with an understanding that any lie would be discovered anyway. The truth is told because, really, there’s no good reason not to. Lying won’t get us anywhere, and the truth is no reason to stop hoping.\n\nHe manages to pull off the impossible — making the listener more aware of the world while simultaneously feeling better about what’s coming next.\n\nExcept, wait…y’all hear that all the time in church, don’t you?\n\nYeah, see…this is church music for cats like me. There’s no ascribed morality. There’s an understanding that, from time to time, people are gonna get lit to ease the pain. Sins of varying magnitude are understood rather than condemned. This is secularized gospel, a combination of the Testaments into something timeless. Just check the raps and interludes on his brilliant, uniquely intimate live album from The Bitter End in 1971. This is a church I’d go to, save for the people snorting cocaine. Nah, I ain’t about that.\n\nBut listen to how moving he was with so few words. How much it would fill you up if “The Makings of You” were about your makings. The ability to empathize with the weary faces on the train on “Stare and Stare.” The double-edged decision to close the show with “Stone Junkie.” I mean, this is life and death and the best and worst of them both.\n\nDon’t let your mind become offended miss\n\nLady, ’cause you ain’t no better than our typical Sadie\n\nYou just got money, you can spend out at will\n\nBut when comes aches and pains, you still use the pill\n\nOh, he wasn’t done.\n\nI know everybody whose heart is still thumping\n\nIs drinking, shooting, snorting, smoking on something\n\nNow that might sound funky and I don’t mean to mislead\n\nSo you can retract the thought\n\nOf you on drugs or on weed\n\nThat ain’t my business\n\nYou know what you do\n\nI’m just sayin’\n\nfor the majority of you"
