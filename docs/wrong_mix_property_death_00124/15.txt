Curtis Mayfield

Allmusic Biography : Perhaps because he didnt cross over to the pop audience as heavily as Motowns stars, it may be that the scope of Curtis Mayfields talents and contributions have yet to be fully recognized. Judged merely by his records alone, the mans legacy is enormous. As the leader of the Impressions, he recorded some of the finest soul vocal group music of the 1960s. As a solo artist in the 1970s, he helped pioneer funk and helped introduce hard-hitting urban commentary into soul music. "Gypsy Woman," "Its All Right," "People Get Ready," "Freddies Dead," and "Super Fly" are merely the most famous of his many hit records.

But Curtis Mayfield wasnt just a singer. He wrote most of his material at a time when that was not the norm for soul performers. He was among the first -- if not the very first -- to speak openly about African-American pride and community struggle in his compositions. As a songwriter and a producer, he was a key architect of Chicago soul, penning material and working on sessions by notable Windy City soulsters like Gene Chandler, Jerry Butler, Major Lance, and Billy Butler. In this sense, he can be compared to Smokey Robinson, who also managed to find time to write and produce many classics for other soul stars. Mayfield was also an excellent guitarist, and his rolling, Latin-influenced lines were highlights of the Impressions recordings in the 60s. During the next decade, he would toughen up his guitar work and production, incorporating some of the best features of psychedelic rock and funk.

Mayfield began his career as an associate of Jerry Butler, with whom he formed the Impressions in the late 50s. After the Impressions had a big hit in 1958 with "For Your Precious Love," Butler, who had sung lead on the record, split to start a solo career. Mayfield, while keeping the Impressions together, continued to write for and tour with Butler before the Impressions got their first Top 20 hit in 1961, "Gypsy Woman."

Mayfield was heavily steeped in gospel music before he entered the pop arena, and gospel, as well as doo wop, influences would figure prominently in most of his 60s work. Mayfield wasnt a staunch traditionalist, however. He and the Impressions may have often worked the call-and-response gospel style, but his songs (romantic and otherwise) were often veiled or unveiled messages of black pride, reflecting the increased confidence and self-determination of the African-American community. Musically he was an innovator as well, using arrangements that employed the punchy, blaring horns and Latin-influenced rhythms that came to be trademark flourishes of Chicago soul. As the staff producer for the OKeh label, Mayfield was also instrumental in lending his talents to the work of other Chi-town soul singers who went on to national success. With Mayfield singing lead and playing guitar, the Impressions had 14 Top 40 hits in the 1960s (five made the Top 20 in 1964 alone), and released some above-average albums during that period as well.

Given Mayfields prodigious talents, it was perhaps inevitable that he would eventually leave the Impressions to begin a solo career, as he did in 1970. His first few singles boasted a harder, more funk-driven sound; singles like "(Dont Worry) If Theres a Hell Below, Were All Gonna Go" found him confronting ghetto life with a realism that had rarely been heard on record. He really didnt hit his artistic or commercial stride as a solo artist, though, until Super Fly, his soundtrack to a 1972 blaxploitation film. Drug deals, ghetto shootings, the death of young black men before their time: all were described in penetrating detail. Yet Mayfields irrepressible falsetto vocals, uplifting melodies, and fabulous funk pop arrangements gave the oft-moralizing material a graceful strength that few others could have achieved. For all the glory of his past work, Superfly stands as his crowning achievement, not to mention a much-needed counterpoint to the sensationalistic portrayals of the film itself.

At this point Mayfield, along with Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, was the foremost exponent of a new level of compelling auteurism in soul. His failure to maintain the standards of Super Fly qualifies as one of the great disappointments in the history of black popular music. Perhaps hed simply reached his peak after a long climb, but the rest of his 70s work didnt match the musical brilliance and lyrical subtleties of Super Fly, although he had a few large R&B; hits in a much more conventional vein, such as "Kung Fu," "So in Love," and "Only You Babe."

Mayfield had a couple of hits in the early 80s, but the decade generally found his commercial fortunes in a steady downward spiral, despite some intermittent albums. On August 14, 1990, he became paralyzed from the neck down when a lighting rig fell on top of him at a concert in Brooklyn, NY. In the mid-90s, a couple of tribute albums consisting of Mayfield covers appeared, with contributions by such superstars as Eric Clapton, Bruce Springsteen, and Gladys Knight. Though no substitute for the man himself, these tributes served as an indication of the enormous regard in which Mayfield was still held by his peers. He died December 26, 1999 at the age of 57.

Curtis : Allmusic album Review : The first solo album by the former leader of the Impressions, Curtis represented a musical apotheosis for Curtis Mayfield -- indeed, it was practically the "Sgt. Peppers" album of 70s soul, helping with its content and its success to open the whole genre to much bigger, richer musical canvases than artists had previously worked with. All of Mayfields years of experience of life, music, and people were pulled together into a rich, powerful, topical musical statement that reflected not only the most up-to-date soul sounds of its period, finely produced by Mayfield himself, and the immediacy of the times and their political and social concerns, but also embraced the most elegant R&B sounds of the past. As a producer, Mayfield embraced the most progressive soul sounds of the era, stretching them out compellingly on numbers like "Move on Up," but he also drew on orchestral sounds (especially harps), to achieve some striking musical timbres (check out "Wild and Free"), and wove all of these influences, plus the topical nature of the songs, into a neat, amazingly lean whole. There was only one hit single off of this record, "(Dont Worry) If Theres a Hell Down Below Were All Going to Go," which made number three, but the album as a whole was a single entity and really had to be heard that way.

Roots : Allmusic album Review : Roots is Curtis Mayfields visionary album, a landmark creation every bit as compelling and far-reaching in its musical and extra-musical goals as Marvin Gayes contemporary Whats Goin On. Opening on the hit "Get Down," the album soars on some of the sweetest and most eloquent -- yet driving -- soul sounds heard up to that time. Mayfields growing musical ambitions, first manifested on the Curtis album, and his more sophisticated political sensibilities, presented with a lot of raw power on Curtis Live!, are pulled together here in a new, richer studio language, embodied in extended song structures ("Underground"), idealistic yet lyrically dazzling anthems ("We Got to Have Peace," "Keep On Keeping On," and, best of all, the soaring "Beautiful Brother of Mine"), and impassioned blues ("Now Youre Gone"). The music is even bolder than the material on the Curtis album, with Mayfield expanding his instrumental range to the level of a veritable soul orchestra; and the recording is better realized, as Mayfield, with that album and a tour behind him, shows a degree of confidence that only a handful of soul artists of this era could have mustered.

Back to the World : Allmusic album Review : Back to the World, the first album Curtis Mayfield recorded and released after hitting number one with the intense inner-city vignette Superfly, returned him to a steady balance of optimism for the future and direct social commentary regarding the problems of his people. The lead single, "Future Shock," was inspired by Alvin Tofflers 1970 book of the same name, which warned readers that industrial society was changing so radically that environmental and social problems could be endemic for decades. The track tapped into the same grooves and brass heard on Superfly (perhaps overly so), but said more about the world around ("We got to stop all men, from messing up the land/When wont we understand, this is our last and only chance?"). The title track was very upbeat and positive, as were the refreshing "If I Were Only a Child Again" and "Future Song (Love a Good Woman, Love a Good Man)." With no hit singles to even approach the three high performers from Superfly, though, Back to the World was a distinct disappointment; the music wasnt as powerful as fans were expecting, and though the songs were up to Mayfields usual high standards, there were many similarities (musically and thematically) to material from each of his proper solo albums.

His vocals continued to be alternately poignant, urgent, and accusatory, while his lyrics, production, and arrangements were once again magnificent. Album: 6 of 45

Sweet Exorcist : Allmusic album Review : Curtis Mayfield hit a stride during the 70s that was unparalleled among R&B/soul performers from an album standpoint. He was writing, producing, arranging, and performing on great album after great album, then distributing them on his own label as well. This one included the big hit "Kung Fu," plus the title song, and once more perfectly blended rigorous message tracks and steamy love songs. Sadly, it hasnt been reissued on CD and isnt on the list to be at this time. Album: 7 of 45

6 Hard Times (03:43)

7 Love to the People (04:03)

There's No Place Like America Today : Allmusic album Review : The title is intended in an ironic way, as illustrated not only by the cover -- a grim parody of late-40s/early-50s advertising imagery depicting white versus black social reality -- but the grim yet utterly catchy and haunting opening number, "Billy Jack." A song about gun violence that was years ahead of its time, its scored to an incisive horn arrangement by Richard Tufo. "When Seasons Change" is a beautifully wrought account of the miseries of urban life that contains elements of both gospel and contemporary soul. The albums one big song, "So in Love," which made number 67 on the pop charts but was a Top Ten soul hit, is only the prettiest of a string of exquisite tracks on the album, including "Blue Monday People" and "Jesus" and the soaring finale, "Love to the People," broken up by the harder-edged "Hard Times." The album doesnt really have as clearly delineated a body of songs as Mayfields earlier topical releases, but its in the same league with his other work of the period and represents him near his prime as a composer.

Give, Get, Take and Have : Allmusic album Review : Less sociopolitical than previous efforts, Give Get Take Have offers "Mr. Welfare Man" as its sole attempt to enlighten and enhance. Mayfield was obviously experiencing the joys of new love when he cut "Only You Babe" and "This Love Is Sweet," and the tear-jerking numbers "In Your Arms Again" and "Party Night." His aching falsetto coos and purrs, but sounds weakened on this LP. Overall, the album falls short of Mayfields former releases, but even great artists dont always achieve their usual high standards. This was originally released on Curtom Records in the mid-70s. Album: 9 of 45

Never Say You Can't Survive : Allmusic album Review : Never Say You Cant Survive was the last Curtis Mayfield album done in a pure soul vein for the next three years -- its style and sound place it in a direct continuity with the rest of his output right back to 1958. The singing on love songs such as "Show Me Love," "Just Want to Be With You," and "When Were Alone" is among the most achingly lyrical and passionate of his career. The title track boasts ravishing backup singing by Kitty & the Haywoods (who also perform outstandingly on "Im Gonna Win Your Love") and a beautiful arrangement by James Mack. The albums final track, "Sparkle" (written for Sam OSteens movie of the same name, starring Philip Michael Thomas, Irene Cara, and Lonette McKee), gets one of three distinct treatments that the song ever received (the others from the soundtrack and Aretha Franklins version).

5 In Love, in Love, in Love (04:22)

6 You Are, You Are (03:39)

Do It All Night : Allmusic album Review : The last Curtis Mayfield album distributed by Warner Bros., during Curtom Records declining years of 1977-1978, was a maddening album, a complete break in style as Mayfield moved into a pure disco vein. It was his most successful album in three years, but it alienated many longtime fans because he deliberately dumbed down his writing -- he traded his core audience, who couldnt abide the album, for a slightly larger disco audience that had previously eluded him, painting himself into an artistic and career corner. The title track was indicative of the artistic nadir to which Mayfield had to descend to find where the mass audience had gone, a number without an ounce of poetry that he wouldnt have wasted his time with in the studio, much less completed or released, in years past; the beat and the arrangements rather overwhelm anything that Mayfield is saying or singing throughout this album. The closest one gets to the old Curtis Mayfield sound, which is to say, to Curtis Mayfield at all, is "In Love, In Love, In Love," a relatively subdued and soulful number which would have been a secondary track on almost any album that preceded this one, and it is practically lost here, sandwiched in between the commercial dance numbers "Keeps Me Loving You" and "You Are, You Are." Mayfield would adapt his style better to the needs of disco with Heartbeat, his next album. Album: 11 of 45

Songs like "Hey Baby (Give It All to Me)" and "Still Within Your Heart" are missing the hard-hitting urban commentary and focus instead on a romantic vibe similar to love songs by Al Green, Barry White, and Marvin Gaye. No clunkers here, but "Dirty Laundry" is an outstanding track, and one of Mayfields best during the decade. Honesty is a soft, sensual album that transports the listener back to the days of the Impressions more than those of Superfly. [In 2000, Boardwalk re-released this underrated album.] Album: 16 of 45

Take It to the Streets : Allmusic album Review : In the 1980s and 90s, some soul veterans turned to high-tech urban contemporary sounds in an effort to appeal to black radio. Curtis Mayfield, however, continued to deliver rewarding albums by remaining true to himself and sticking with the type of classic soul approach that put him on the map. Take It to the Streets falls short of the unmitigated excellence of Superfly or Sweet Exorcist, but is a respectable effort demonstrating that he could still pack a punch as a vocalist, composer, and producer. Theres much to savor and admire here, including "Homeless" (which makes it clear that Mayfield hadnt lost his touch when it came to biting sociopolitical commentary), "Hes a Fly Guy," the charismatic "Who Was That Lady," and an engaging remake of "On and On" (a gem he wrote for Gladys Knight & the Pips in 1973). With the re-emergence of hard-hitting blaxploitation films in the late 80s, the gritty imagery of "Im Gonna Get You Sucka" and the haunting "Hes a Fly Guy" proved quite timely. While this material could have used some horns, Mayfield generally employs technology in a soulful way -- employing "real instruments" along with keyboards and drum machines, and never letting his production sound stiff, unnatural, or forced.

The Anthology: 1961â1977 : Allmusic album Review : MCAs double-disc The Anthology 1961-1977 is the definitive overview of Curtis Mayfields career, as the only compilation to draw from both his solo work and the best of his output with the Impressions. In fact, even discounting the four Curtom tracks that spill over onto disc two, the first discs 26 selections constitute far and away the most extensive Impressions best-of on the market. Toss in ten of the most essential Mayfield solo tracks, and the result is breathtaking in its progression from romantic soul, often informed by doo wop and gospel, to expansive, ambitiously arranged funk jams. Its also fascinating to hear Mayfields social conscience emerging as the 60s progress, since he was among the very first R&B; artists to explore political issues in his music, paving the way for countless others to do so during the 70s. If youre only interested in Mayfields funkier solo work, Rhinos The Very Best of Curtis Mayfield features all but one of the solo tracks included here, plus several more. But in order to fully grasp Mayfields impact on R&B; and his talent as a singer, songwriter, musician, and producer, The Anthology 1961-1977 is absolutely essential. Album: 21 of 45

People Get Ready! The Curtis Mayfield Story : Allmusic album Review : Like most large box sets, this three-CD, 51-song production is too extensive for the casual fan and sacrifices consistency in an attempt to span an entire career. The focus is on Mayfields solo work; much of the first disc is devoted to his most popular work with the Impressions, but the remainder of the compilation surveys his solo output, from 1970 to 1990. The Impressions tracks are uniformly excellent, but the Mayfield-only cuts are more problematic. The best of these -- the Superfly highlights, of course, and early-70s singles like "(Dont Worry) If Theres a Hell Below Were All Going to Go" and "Beautiful Brother of Mine" -- are as good as anything he ever did. But even in the early 70s, he was erratic, and after Superfly (his career summit), nothing he did smacked of brilliance. Some of the post-Superfly stuff is OK, but considering that this period takes up half of disc two and all of disc three, it means youre in for a pretty swift downhill slide over the last half of the box. Mayfield never lost his vocal abilities, or his production skills, but after the late 70s his material was simply unimpressive, getting into pedestrian dance music and romantic urban contemporary. For a Mayfield retrospective, youre much better off with MCAs two-disc Anthology, which goes into the Impressions period with much greater depth, and includes the cream of his 70s solo recordings.

New World Order : Allmusic album Review : New World Order is a touching, moving comeback from Curtis Mayfield. As the first new music Mayfield recorded since he was paralyzed in 1990, the album engenders a lot of goodwill -- its undeniably affecting to hear him sing again, especially with the knowledge that his performances had to be recorded line by line, due to his paralysis. The joy of hearing him sing makes the inconsistency of the album forgivable, especially since he is in good voice. Narada Michael Walden, Daryl Simmons, and Organized Noize all contributed productions that are sensitive but strong, which gives the album added weight. The songs are hit-and-miss, but the main strength of the record is that it illustrates that Mayfield can make music that is still vital. Album: 30 of 45

Love, Peace, Understanding : Allmusic album Review : The triple-disc Love, Peace, Understanding box set released by Sequel Records in the U.K. compiles many of Curtis Mayfields best-known singles along with quite a few rare demos from the early part of his solo career and some seldom-heard latter-day songs. The second disc in the set, which features the early-70s recordings Mayfield is best remembered for -- "(Dont Worry) If Theres a Hell Below," "Move on Up," "Freddies Dead," "Superfly," "So in Love," and so on -- is wonderful, no doubt, but thats probably not the reason to seek out this collection. Most admirers already have these songs either on the original full-lengths or else on other, more succinct best-ofs like Rhinos single-disc The Very Best of Curtis Mayfield or Sequels double-disc Move on Up: The Singles Anthology. If you want a true best-of featuring Mayfields best solo work, those are the collections to own; not this one. However, there is a reason to splurge on this sprawling triple-disc set, and its mostly because of the demos featured on disc one. Many of these 17 songs are not readily available in any format, though some would appear later in more polished versions, such as in the case of "Ghetto Child," for example, which would later appear on the Superfly soundtrack a few years later as "Little Child Runnin Wild." In addition to these hard-to-find demos, the third disc on this box set is also somewhat of a curiosity, featuring songs from Mayfields post-1975 work. Though this era of Mayfields solo career wasnt his most accomplished by any means, characterized more by frustration and disappointment than success or brilliance, most listeners probably arent familiar with these songs, so its nice to have a distilled selection of latter-day work to sample rather than scour through those hard to find and often painful latter-day albums. So, in total, you get a little bit of everything on this box set: a disc of early demos, a disc of genius hits, and a disc of failed comeback attempts, all in chronological order. Plus, you get a handy booklet with helpful liner notes, explaining the story behind the demos and the latter-day comeback attempts. Album: 32 of 45

The Ultimate Curtis Mayfield : Allmusic album Review : Even if you have other Curtis Mayfield compilations, this wont be added baggage. Six tracks represent his weaning from the Impressions period; the 23 others are prime cuts from his solo albums, three each from Curtis and Superfly, respectively. Theres enough unfamiliar material to make this essential to the most fanatical Mayfield worshiper, including three Mayfield/Donny Hathaway collaborations; "Never Stop Loving Me," which previously appeared on Keni Burkes Youre the Best LP, and a remake of his Gladys Knight & the Pips stomper "On and On."
