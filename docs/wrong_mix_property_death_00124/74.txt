The BMI Foundation, in partnership with the Curtis Mayfield Foundation, Chicago High School for the Arts (ChiArts), and Dekalb School of the Arts in Atlanta has announced ChiArts senior Alisha Greenidge and Dekalb School of the Arts senior Sydney Queen as the winners of the 2020 Curtis Mayfield Scholarships. Both students were announced with a $3,000 award by Cheaa Mayfield, the son of Curtis Mayfield via Cheaa Mayfield’s Facebook Live event on Thursday June 1th. This year marks the inaguaral partnership with Dekalb School of the Arts in Atlanta, selected for its high-performing programs and student body.

The Curtis Mayfield Scholarship is presented annually to exemplary graduating seniors at both ChiArts in Chicago, IL and DeKalb School of the Arts in Atlanta, GA. Both institutions are 4-year public high schools with dedicated programs and curriculum for artistically gifted students. The scholarship program honors the memory of the iconic Chicago-born songwriter, musician and producer whose prolific career and legacy includes such hits as “Superfly,” “People Get Ready,” “Move On Up,” “Do Do Wap is Strong in Here,” and “It’s All Right”, as well as the numerous soundtracks he created for film. Recipients are chosen based on need and musical merit, and preference is given to students going on to pursue college majors in performance, composition and songwriting.

Mrs. Altheida Mayfield describes her late husband as a caring man of great depth who took pride in helping young people achieve their musical dreams. Upon the announcement of the scholarship’s expansion to Atlanta, she shared her hope that this gesture would be a way for the Curtis Mayfield legacy to remain connected with his Chicago roots and bring renewed awareness of his connection and musical influence to the Georgia capital.

Alisha Greenidge is a graduating senior at Chicago High School for the Arts where she studied vocals for Opera, Musical Theater, Jazz and Gospel. She is featured in the Angelic and Sanctuary choirs at Union Hill Church, and was the first and only Chicago student to perform at the UWM Vocal Arts Festival in 2019.

In addition to a full complement of academic subjects, students are offered drama, dance, vocal and instrumental music, visual arts, video technology, creative writing, multimedia and design & production. Many students participate in the gifted, advanced, and advanced placement programs of study.
