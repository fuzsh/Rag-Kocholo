        "text": "Nestled within the heart of Old Cairo, the Hanging Church in Egypt stands as a breathtaking testament to architectural prowess and enduring history. Constructed in the seventh century AD, this ancient marvel of Coptic Orthodox architecture has captivated generations with its distinctive design and profound historical importance. Perched atop the remnants of a Roman fortress, the church appears to defy gravity, earning its iconic moniker. Beyond its striking appearance, the Hanging Church holds immense cultural and religious significance, serving as a poignant symbol of Egypt’s diverse heritage and the resilience of its Christian populace.\n\nAbout Hanging Church In Egypt\n\nImage Credit: Diego Delso for Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Hanging Church, also known as the Church of the Virgin Mary or Al-Moallaqa, is an important landmark in Cairo, Egypt. The name “Hanging Church” comes from its elevated position. It’s built on top of the southern gate of the Roman Fortress of Babylon. While the church was originally built high above the surrounding area, the ground level has risen over time, burying much of the Roman structure. Despite this, the Hanging Church still retains its symbolic elevation, a testament to its enduring presence.\n\nThe Hanging Church is one of the most famous Coptic Christian churches in Cairo. The Coptic Church is a Christian tradition with roots in Egypt. The church holds a special place for Coptic Christians and is believed to be one of the first built in the basilican style, a common design for early Christian churches. The Hanging Church is not just a beautiful structure; it’s a place of reported Marian apparitions. The Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a dream to a Pope in the 10th century, adding to the church’s spiritual significance.\n\nMust Read: Best Places To Visit In Egypt With Family\n\nHistory Of Hanging Church In Egypt\n\nImage Credit: Pexels\n\nThe history of Hanging Church dates back to the third century; it is one of the oldest churches in the country. The Hanging Church, likely constructed during the patriarchate of Isaac (690–692), may have had an earlier iteration dating back to the 3rd or 4th century. However, the earliest recorded mention of the church appears in the biography of Patriarch Joseph I (831–849), noting a visit by the governor of Egypt. Significant reconstruction occurred under Pope Abraham (975–978), with numerous restorations following, the most recent being an extensive renovation completed in 2011. Historical artefacts no longer in use were transferred to the Coptic Museum, while a set of ten wooden panels from a church door, engraved with Christian iconography in 1300 AD, is housed in the British Museum. The church was built over the Babylon Fortress, a Roman citadel whose origins were debated among Coptic historians.\n\nSome attribute its construction to the 19th century B.C. under Pharaoh Sesostris, who defeated the Babylonians and enslaved their prisoners, building a fortress around their settlement. Others argue it was constructed in the late 6th century B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, after his conquest of Egypt. The Hanging Church was established atop the citadel’s southern bastions, which marked the main gate, lending the church its ‘hanging’ appearance.\n\nArchitecture And Design\n\nImage Credit: Radosław Botev for Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Egypt Hanging Church is located on Mary Girgis Street in Cairo. Its entrance gate is adorned with intricate decorations. Upon entering, you will have an open courtyard. From here, a flight of 29 steps leads to the church itself. At the top of the stairs, three wooden doors greet visitors. These doors are beautifully embellished with geometric patterns, reflecting the rich artistic heritage of Coptic Christianity. The right section of the sanctuary is considered the original part of the church. Its historical significance adds to the church’s allure. The Hanging Church is renowned for its exquisite marble pulpit. Thirteen pillars support it, each depicting Jesus alongside one of the twelve disciples. Interestingly, one of these pillars is black, symbolising Judas, while another is grey, representing Thomas. The oldest icon in the church dates back to the 8th century.\n\nThe church’s timber roof resembles Noah’s Ark, a unique feature differentiating it from other Egyptian churches. Many artefacts once housed within the church are now on display at the Coptic Museum. These treasures include a lintel depicting Christ’s entry into Jerusalem from the 5th or 6th century. The Hanging Church contains three sanctuaries dedicated to different saints: the Virgin Mary, St. George, and St. John the Baptist. The central iconostasis, dating back to the 13th century, is a masterpiece. Crafted from ebony inlaid with ivory, it features intricate geometric designs and crosses.\n\nSuggested Read: Summer In Egypt\n\nHanging Church In Egypt: Entrance Fees And Opening Hours\n\nImage Credit: Richard Mortel for Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe entrance to the Hanging Church in Egypt is free and open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Coptic Mass is offered on Sundays from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. For the best experience, visit the Church during winter (December through February), when the weather is more relaxed and the crowds are smaller.
