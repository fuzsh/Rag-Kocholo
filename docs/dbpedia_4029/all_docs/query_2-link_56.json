        "text": "In 1792, the St. George’s community began the construction of its first permanent home, a wooden building with a tower across from Kingston Market Square (now Springer Market Square). A new stone church was built at the present location on King Street East at Johnson Street between 1825–1828. The building has been significantly enlarged and embellished over the years, including the 1891 addition of the distinctive dome, a neoclassical landmark on the downtown Kingston skyline.\n\nIn 1899 the church’s interior was gutted by fire but rebuilt in short order to replicate the original plan.\n\nSt. George’s doors are open, we welcome all. When visitors walk through the main doors into an airy building, their eyes are drawn up the soaring columns to the central dome with its soft blue hue and the striking stained glass of St. George’s cross marking the crown. All around are stained glass windows telling stories of faith and service. Sitting in the worn wooden pews and gazing at the altars and the holy vessels, lectern and pulpit, we are reminded of our long-held faith traditions but more importantly, the continuing call to serve God in this world. The processional banners hanging about the Cathedral are symbolic of our ongoing faith journey. Centrally located in this physical place of worship, liturgy, music, teaching and community are the cathedra, the seat of the Bishop’s teaching authority, and the chair of the Dean, St. George’s faith leader."
