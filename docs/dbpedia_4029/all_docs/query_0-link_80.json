        "text": "Although the Christian community in Egypt only makes up around 10% of the population, the country is home to a surprising number of incredible churches. The history of Christianity in Egypt is as long and rich as the history of Egypt itself. The name ‘Egypt’ is actually a derivative of the word Coptic, taken from the Latin ‘Aegypti’.\n\nThere are churches and monasteries in every corner of the country, from the monasteries of Wadi Natrun in the west and St. Catherine in the east, to the churches of Coptic Cairo and Alexandria, both modern and historic. The list below is by no means extensive. Consider it an introduction to the rich heritage of Egypt’s Christians and a brief guide to some of the churches you can find here.\n\nThe Cave Church of St. Simon, Mokattam\n\nNamed after a 10th century tanner and shoemaker who was said to have performed a miracle at the site, the church, also known as the Monastery of St. Simon, is reportedly one of the largest in the region, accommodating up to 20,000 people. Built in the 70s, this architectural wonder lies at the heart of Cairo’s Zabbaleen city – “garbage city” – carved right into the hills of Mokattam. The community of garbage collectors, the majority of which is made up of Coptic families, settled here in the late 60s after a decree by the government was issued to move them all to the same neighbourhood. Since then, a number of smaller churches have been constructed in the area, but the Cave Church remains the largest by far, and certainly the most impressive.\n\nThe Heavenly Cathedral, Sharm el Sheikh\n\nBuilt in 2010, the Coptic cathedral sits atop a small hill in the popular tourist town of Sharm el Sheikh, piercing the coastal city’s skyline. Its elaborately decorated walls, ceilings and stained glass windows took two years to complete, with a team of 19 specialists working on the stunning murals and frescoes, including one that depicts St. John’s vision of the Apocalypse. The cathedral has since become a popular site for tourists, as well as Sinai’s Coptic residents.\n\nThe Hanging Church of St. Mary, Old Cairo\n\nOne of the oldest in Egypt, the Hanging Church was named for its location, suspended over the southern gate of Babylon Fortress in the heart of Coptic Cairo. The church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was built sometime between the 3rd and 7th centuries and then rebuilt around 200 years later by Pope Abraham. Today it remains one of the most important churches in Egypt and at one point was even the official residence of the Coptic Pope. The historic significance alone is reason enough to visit, but the architecture and design too are well worth the appreciation they receive.\n\nSt. Mark’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Alexandria\n\nNamed after St. Mark the Evangelist, considered to be the founder of the church in Alexandria, the cathedral is said to stand on the same land as the church founded by St. Mark in 42 CE. The church was destroyed more than once, first by the Arabs during their invasion of Egypt in the 7th century, and again during the crusades in the 13th century, and once more during the French invasion in 1798. The building we see today is the result of significant renovations done by Pope Yusab II during the 1950s and by Pope Shenouda III in the 80s. The church has acted as the historic seat of the Coptic Pope, until his official residence was moved to Cairo.\n\nChurch of St. George, Old Cairo\n\nThis Greek Orthodox church also lies within the bounds of the Babylon Fortress in Coptic Cairo, in the neighbourhood of Mar Girgis. It dates back to the 10th century, possibly even earlier, but was reconstructed in the early 1900s after a fire damaged the building. The architecture is unique and the church’s interior is known for its stunning stained glass and beautifully decorated domed ceiling. It’s also one of the few round churches in Egypt. The church is actually still active until today, considered to be Egypt’s main Greek Orthodox Church; the monastery is the official seat of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria.\n\nChurch of Abu Serga\n\nBuilt around the 4th or 5th centuries, Abu Serga, also known as St. Sergius and Bacchus, is one of Egypt’s oldest churches. It was said to have been built on the spot where the Holy Family took refuge during their travels through Egypt and is dedicated to Sergio and Bacchus, two Roman soldiers and martyrs whose relics are still kept here. Below the church lies a crypt where some believe the Holy Family stayed, however this has been debated and many say that the crypt itself was built much later, while the original may lay buried somewhere beneath.\n\nCathedral of Evangelismos, Alexandria\n\nThis stunning neo-Gothic Greek basilica was built during the 19th century in Alexandria, a city that has historically been home to a large Greek community and remains so until this day. The first stone was laid in 1847 by Patriarch Hierotheus II and nine years later, in 1856, the cathedral’s construction was complete. The architecture is absolutely stunning, with impressive marble columns lining the interior and even more impressive sculptures and stained glass decorating the walls and windows. The icons of the cathedral were made in Egypt and Turkey, the windows in Paris, the chandeliers in Russia and the clock on the main façade in London.\n\nChurch of the Holy Virgin, Minya\n\nThe Upper Egyptian city of Minya is home to almost half of Egypt’s Christian population and the Church of the Holy Virgin is one of the oldest in Egypt, dating back to the 4th century, when it was constructed by Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. Once again, this is one of the sites where the Holy Family is believed to have stayed while in Egypt and is now a popular site for pilgrimage. The church and monastery are perched high up on Gabal al-Tayr (Mountain of the Birds). The church itself is minimalistic in design and ornamentation, but its location means it has a spectacular view of the Nile and surrounding fields.\n\nSt. Mary’s Church, Maadi\n\nLocated on the East bank of the Nile just outside Maadi, St. Mary’s is another church that was constructed on a location the Holy Family is believed to have passed through. Built sometime around the 10th century to mark the spot where the Holy Family began their journey to Upper Egypt by boat, St. Mary’s is considered to be an important and sacred space by Copts, and is even believed to be the site of a miracle that took place in the 1970s. The church is still very active until today and has a number of fascinating chapels and chambers that are worth exploring."
