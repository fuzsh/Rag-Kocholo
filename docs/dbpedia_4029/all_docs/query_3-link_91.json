        "text": "OUR FOOD MISSION\n\nSt. George’s serves Lake County, a rural community that dwells at 10,152 feet of elevation. Due to our geographic location and other structural barriers, Lake County struggles with food access at the individual, household, and community level. Located 24 miles off of the I-70 corridor, and only accessible via high mountain passes, food procurement is a challenge for our community. Lake County only has one grocery store for all 8,000 residents.\n\nPrior to the impact of inflation, groceries in Lake County cost 18% higher than the national average and 11% higher than our neighboring communities. Additionally, 70% of our community commutes 40 miles or more over high mountain passes to work in the wealthier surrounding ski communities. With the high cost of living and rising prices of gas to commute, St. George’s food program has become even more essential. We prioritize providing the fresh, nutritious food our community deserves but is often unattainable due to financial constraints and other barriers.\n\nThis year, our food budget has been impacted significantly by inflation, both increasing the number of households utilizing our programs and increasing our cost to purchase nutritionally essential and culturally appropriate foods. We have estimated that we will spend approximately $200,000 on food alone in 2024. The majority of our funding comes from grants, which are not guaranteed. St. George will continue to respond to the needs of its community in whatever capacity it can, but we are hoping to make our particular dilemma more widely known so that we can build a broader base of support.\n\nAs a trusted ally in our community we strive to build community through the sharing of food while meeting each individual with dignity, love, and respect. As a team we are constantly striving to see through individual and collective pain and into the innocence of each person in an attempt to ease suffering, if only a little. The results of our work has shown us time and time again that if you love people and feed them nutritious food, it can have a positive impact on their physical, mental, and spiritual well being, and in turn they are more likely to thrive within a community. The ripple effect of this mission happens in small ways, in every interaction, but the results are huge and are creating more peace in this chaotic world."
