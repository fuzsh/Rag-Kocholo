        "text": "Coptic Cairo and the Citadel – STT 112\n\nDiscover the ancient sites and culture of Coptic Christians on a private tour through Old Cairo when you will visit sites that in fact have meaning for all Christians. Visit Abu Serga where the Holy family sought refuge, and Ben Ezra, one of the oldest synagogues in Cairo and said by some to be where Moses was taken from the Nile. Learn about Christian life in Egypt, a country where Christianity is a minority. Also visit one of the great Islamic sites by touring the Citadel of Salah al Din and the Mosque of Muhammad Ali.\n\nThe Hanging Church is built into the walls of the water gate of the Roman fortress known as Babylon and is possibly the oldest Christian church in Egypt. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it is one of Cairo’s most beautiful churches. Continue to the Monastery and Church of St George. This is not such an old church, dating from 1909, but there has been a church in Coptic Cairo dedicated to the Martyr since the 10th-century. It is one of the few remaining circular churches in the Middle East.\n\nYour next stop is the Abu Serga, the oldest church in Egypt dating back to the 5th century A.D. The church owes its fame to having been constructed upon the crypt of the Holy Family where they stayed for three weeks during their sojourn in Egypt, resting after fleeing Israel from King Herod. Ben Ezra Synagogue is one of the oldest in Egypt and the only synagogue you can currently visit. Set in a shady garden, it was built on the site of 4th-century Christian church and was originally a church, sold by the Copts to the Jews to pay taxes to the Muslim rulers of the day. The synagogue was severely damaged, but it has been almost completely renovated.\n\nThe Church of St. Barbara is among the churches of Old Cairo of historic importance. It was originally dedicated to St. Cyrus and St. John who were worshipped for their healing powers. Finally you will visit the fascinating Coptic Museum, which is located in an area of great historical importance within the precinct of the Babylon Fort. The museum features almost 16,000 objects of importance to the Copts of Egypt.\n\nEnjoy lunch at a floating restaurant before heading up to the Citadel of Salah al Din. The Saladin Citadel, built on an artificially detached range of the Muqqattam Hills, was constructed with limestone quarried from it and large blocks supplied by the small pyramids at Giza. Saladin, the founder of the Ayyubid Dynasty in Egypt, came to power in 1169 AD as the result of a threatened attack by crusaders, and the Citadel was completed between 1176 and 1182. In the 19th century, during the Turkish period, the Citadel became the residence for the royal family. Muhammad Ali, the Turkish ruler, added a great alabaster mosque, built in the Istanbul style. As well as visiting the mosque and palace, you will enjoy spectacular views across the city from this high point.\n\nMuhammad Ali Mosque (or the Alabaster Mosque)\n\nThe Mosque of Muhammad Ali was designed in the Ottoman style of Istanbul and is quite unrelated to the architectural tradition of Cairo. In the courtyard in front of the sanctuary there is a charming Turkish baroque ablution fountain (which makes an excellent photo opportunity). The gingerbread clock was given by Louis Philippe in 1846 as an exchange gift for the obelisk now in the Place de la Concorde, Paris. Apparently the clock has never worked and there are those who say the French got the best of the bargain.\n\nDuration\n\nDeparts from your accommodation at 8:00am.
