        "text": "Introducing The Church Of St George In Piran\n\nFor centuries, the town of Piran was under Venetian rule. And nowhere is this fact more apparent than in the design of what is probably Piran’s most famous sights, the Church of St. George, also known as St. George’s Cathedral (Slovene: .\n\nOriginally built in the early 12th century, its current structure dates from its expansion in the 14th century. By the 16th century, the church got a completely new Renaissance appearance with decorations made by stonemason Bonfante Torre. The look was completely Venetian, in fact, the free-standing bell tower was designed as a small-scale replica of the just-completed St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice. The new exterior also bore a Venetian imprint, having been based on the architectural designs of Andrea Palladio. The church’s frescoes were painted by some of the best Venetian masters. The reconstruction ended in 1637.\n\nIn 1660, a baptistry was built next to the church. It now holds several medieval sculptures, including a spectacular sculpture of Christ dating back to the beginning of the 14th century. In the 18th century, 3 stone altars and 2 sculptures were added to the church. Another addition was an elaborate organ made by Petar Nakic, a Franciscan monk from Dalmatia and a famous organ builder and designer.\n\nToday, the Church of St. George is one of the most important architectural, cultural, and historical monuments on the Slovenian coast. It also serves as a reminder of the historic bonds between Piran and Venice.\n\nChurch Of St George Review\n\nWhile Piran and its surroundings has more than ten churches, the Church of St. George is the main one. Located atop a small hill just behind the Tartini Square, this 14th-century building dominates the townscape with its beautiful nearly 50-meter high free-standing bell tower.\n\nFrom the centre of Piran, there are two main stone paved paths up the hill that join just below the church. It’s about 15-20 minutes walk. Entry to the church is via a small museum in the presbytery. The one-room museum contains a small display of around 20 religious artefacts, including relics such as a fragment of St Georges shin bone, and a scrap of the shawl of St Mary. Jesus mounted on an unusual representation of the cross – as the Tree of Life – can be found here. The museum describes in fascinating detail how experts painstakingly restored the piece to its original appearance.\n\nYou can also see the crypt with some very old walls, and the church itself which is highly decorated and has some elaborate carvings. The admission fee is €1,5 which is a fair price, even if you can see some of the interior of the church from the doorway, through the iron grille without paying.\n\nFor some, the best part of the visit are great views from the churchyard. From one side of the building you have an amazing view of the whole town of Piran. From the other side you can look up and down the coastline all the way to Trieste in Italy in the north and Croatia to the south.\n\nThe free-standing bell tower next door costs another €1 to ascend and offers even more breathtaking views. The stairway is rickety and wooden and very narrow, though there are passing places. It’s around 150 steps to the top.\n\nThere is also the sacristy in a separate building which is not open, but you can see the interior through the grille.\n\nIn summary, the church is unprepossessing from the outside (bar the wonderful location). But once inside, it’s a different world. The collection of parish gold and silver, including an amazing statuette of St. George and the dragon, a monstrance, and a reliquary bone from the leg of aforementioned saint, are all gorgeous. The medieval wooden carving of the ‘crucified of Piran’ is deeply moving. The church itself, lovingly restored, still serves as a place of worship, and is alive with the Spirit. We suppose most people come for the view from the hill or bell tower, but if you like churches, we don’t think you will regret paying the admission.\n\nOpening hours:\n\nThe church’s doors are usually open and a metal grille allows you to see some of the richly ornate and newly restored interior, but full access is via the museum which includes the church’s treasury and catacombs. The museum is open from 10:00 to 16:00 every day, except on Tuesdays, when it’s closed. The admission fee is €1,5 for adults and €0,75 for children. The bell tower next door costs another €1 to ascend. It is open daily from 10:00 to 20:00.\n\nThe church is accessible also for those with walking problems or in wheelchairs, as the authorities made ramps next to the stairs leading to the church in 2015 (see the photo).\n\nChurch Of St George Pictures\n\nView our image gallery with high-resolution photos that prove you absolutely have to visit the Church Of St George in Piran!\n\nThe Church of St. George is the jewel on the crown of Piran, one of the oldest, best preserved Slovenian towns with its rich cultural heritage, narrow streets and charming Venetian architecture.
