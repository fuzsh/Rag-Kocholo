        "text": "St. George church\n\nSt. George Church Cairo is a Greek Orthodox church in Coptic Cairo. The church dates back to the 10th century (or earlier). The current structure was rebuilt following a 1904 fire. The church is one of the few round churches still in existence in the east. It is built atop an old Roman tower and adjoins the Monastery of St. George. The Holy family is said to have taken shelter in a place now covered by the church.There is a long set of steps that lead up to the church that are built on the outer wall of the Roman towers.As one ascend these steps, there can be found a relief of St. George and the dragon wrapped around the outer brickwork of the tower. The church had been burned many times. It burned in 1904 and the current structure was built in 1909, but still has some of the older structure’s beautiful stained-glass windows. For centuries, the church alternated between ownership by the Copts and the Greek, but since the 15th century it has remained Greek Orthodox\n\nSadly, the original Church of St. George that burned was considered one of the most beautiful and richest in the Roman fortress of Babylon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suqjt-F_qRE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOTPGhSE6uc\n\nReviews\n\nhttps://goo.gl/tq0xNe"
