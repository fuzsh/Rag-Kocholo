        "text": "St. George's Church is one of the three main churches in Wismar and a remarkable architectural monument of North German brick Gothic. The church dates from the first half of the 13th century. During its centuries-long construction, the church was modified several times and completed in 1594. The building was severely damaged during the Second World War. It was rebuilt from 1990.\n\nChurch of St. Mary\n\nDamaged during the Second World War and completely destroyed in 1960, only the 80-metre high tower of the former Marienkirche remains. It is a landmark of Wismar, visible from afar. The church was considered to be one of the most beautiful brick churches in northern Germany.\n\nChurch of St. Nicholas\n\nThe church of St. Nicholas, founded in the 14th century, is the only one of the city's three large parish churches that survived World War II. Its central nave, 37 metres high, is the second highest Gothic brick church in the world after the LÃ¼beck Marienkirche.\n\nKloster Sonnenkamp Church\n\nThe church of Kloster Sonnenkamp dates from the 13th century. It was probably built in three phases between 1219, 1227 and 1240. The buildings showed late Romanesque forms in transition to Gothic. Soon the first parts of the monastery church were completed, so that in 1236 it was consecrated to the Virgin Mary and St. John. Around 1245, the complete church was then standing."
