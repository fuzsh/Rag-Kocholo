        "text": "Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has announced a three-month state of emergency after attacks on two Coptic churches that left at least 44 dead.\n\nThe measure allows authorities to make arrests without warrants and search people's homes. It needs to be approved by parliament before it is implemented.\n\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the blasts in Tanta and Alexandria on Palm Sunday.\n\nThe group has targeted Copts in Egypt recently and warns of more attacks.\n\nMr Sisi made a defiant speech at the presidential palace after a meeting of the national defence council to discuss the explosions.\n\nHe warned that the war against the jihadists would be \"long and painful\", and said that the state of emergency would come into force after all \"legal and constitution steps\" were taken. The majority in parliament backs Mr Sisi.\n\nThe president had earlier ordered the deployment of the military across the country to protect \"vital and important infrastructure\".\n\nThe move by Mr Sisi is likely to raise concerns among human rights activists, observers say. The president, a former army chief, has been criticised by local and international groups for severe restrictions on civil and political rights in Egypt.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says, external tens of thousands of people have been arrested in a crackdown on dissent, and that security forces have committed flagrant abuses, including torture, enforced disappearances and likely extrajudicial executions.\n\nHours later, police stopped the bomber from entering the St Mark's Coptic church in Alexandria, also in the north. He detonated his explosives outside, leaving 17 dead, including several police officers.\n\n\"Crusaders and their apostate allies should know the bill between us and them is very big and they will pay it with rivers of blood from their children, god willing. Wait for us, for we will wait for you,\" the jihadist group said in a statement quoted by Reuters news agency.\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live in Egypt, the Church has about a million members outside the country.\n\nCopts believe that their Church dates back to around 50 AD, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. The head of the Church is called the Pope and is considered to be the successor of St Mark.\n\nThis makes it one of the earliest Christian groups outside the Holy Land.\n\nThe Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe early Church suffered persecution under the Roman Empire, and there were intermittent persecutions after Egypt became a Muslim country. Many believe that continues to this day.\n\nMore about the Coptic Orthodox Church"
