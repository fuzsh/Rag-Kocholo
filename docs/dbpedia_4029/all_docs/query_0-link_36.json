        "text": "Cairo will almost always conjure up several images in one’s mind. The pyramids; the sphinx, the city of a thousand minarets it’s so fondly referred to by Muslims. But there’s a part of Cairo, nestled in its heart in fact, that is just as historically important as Egypt’s world wonders.\n\nOf course it’s Coptic Cairo I’m referring to. Just a short walk to the mosque of Amr Ibn al As, there are several churches to see in this area, most notably St. George’s Church and The Hanging Church. The architecture of St. George’s Church drew me in first, the Greek flag flying full mast beside it.\n\nThe only round church in Egypt, St. George’s Church — also known to Egyptians as the Mari Girgis Church — is the main Greek Orthodox Church in Egypt. It was originally built on top of a Roman round tower in the 10th century but a fire destroyed the original structure.\n\nThe church we see today was built in 1904 and is on a sharp incline, as though the architects wanted to try to get physically closer to God.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I couldn’t get over the beautiful exterior of St. George’s Church.\n\nThe artwork inside St. George’s Church is just as elegant and beautiful as its exterior. The colours are especially beautiful, with the windows letting in the light of day.\n\nA small screen shows visitors a glimpse of the foundations the church was built on.\n\nThe church’s interior is spacious, with wooden pews arranged all around.\n\nThe altar is regally decorated in gold, with paintings and symbols adorned under arches.\n\nImages of St. George slaying a dragon can be found around the church.\n\nThe bells of St. George’s Church.\n\nJust by the entrance to St. George’s church is a large graveyard with many tombs and crypts.\n\nSeveral of these crypts are owned by Greek families who lived in Egypt.\n\nI found my visit to St. George’s Church fascinating, the architecture and artwork artistic and simple. Coptic Cairo is also a testimony not only of the largely peaceful co-existence of Christians and Muslims in Egypt but also of the many different nationalities that lived and died in Egypt, including the Greeks."
