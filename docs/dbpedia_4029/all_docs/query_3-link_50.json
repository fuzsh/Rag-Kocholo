        "text": "Act of Spiritual Communion\n\nMy Jesus, I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. I love You above all things, and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.\n\nWelcome to St. George Roman Catholic Parish\n\nWelcome to our parish's website! We are excited to present to you all the incredible features this new site has to offer - the ability to download the weekly bulletin, a calendar of parish events, an online donation option, a photo gallery of parish events, and much more!\n\nWhether you are a long time parishioner, someone new to the area, or just checking us out on the web, we hope you find our site helpful, informative and, above all, a reflection of our parish's mission of Christian hospitality to everyone, as we are all members of the Body of Christ.\n\nGod bless you,\n\nRev. Monsignor Domenico Pinti, Pastor"
