        "text": "About St George’s\n\nSt George's is the parish church of Mayfair. Splendidly refurbished in 2010 it was built between 1721-1724 to the designs of John James, as one of the Fifty Churches projected by Queen Anne's Act of 1711. The reredos is from the workshop of Grinling Gibbons and frames a 'Last Supper' painted for the church by William Kent in 1724. The windows contain Flemish glass of the early 16th century from Antwerp.George Frederick Handel was a regular worshipper at St George's, which is home to the annual London Handel Festival.\n\nWe have a reputation for dignified and traditional formal worship based on the Book of Common Prayer, magnificent music provided by our fine professional choir, and thoughtful preaching.\n\nHere we worship Almighty God, who in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ has turned His face toward the world in love. You are most welcome to join us and make St George's your spiritual home."
