        "text": "St. George (flourished 3rd century—died, traditionally Lydda, Palestine [now Lod, Israel]; feast day April 23) was an early Christian martyr who during the Middle Ages became an ideal of martial valour and selflessness. He is the patron saint of England and of Georgia and is venerated as one of the 14 Auxiliary Saints (Holy Helpers).\n\nNothing of George’s life or deeds can be established, but tradition holds that he was a Roman soldier and was tortured and decapitated under Diocletian’s persecution of Christians in 303. His remains were taken to Lydda (now Lod, Israel), the homeland of his mother, and were later transferred to the church that was built in his name there. Various relics reportedly are housed in both Western and Eastern churches worldwide. St. George’s Chapel of Windsor Castle, for example, is said to have once held two fingers, part of the heart, and part of the skull of the saint.\n\nLegends about him as a warrior-saint, dating from the 6th century, became popular and increasingly extravagant. Jacob de Voragine’s Legenda aurea (1265–66; Golden Legend) repeats the story of his rescuing a Libyan king’s daughter from a dragon and then slaying the monster in return for a promise by the king’s subjects to be baptized. George’s slaying of the dragon may be a Christian version of the legend of Perseus, who was said to have rescued Andromeda from a sea monster near Lydda. It is a theme much represented in art, the saint frequently being depicted as a youth wearing knight’s armour with a scarlet cross."
