        "text": "In 1912, Courtenay, Sandwick and Comox Presbyterian churches merged, and built a church in Courtenay. The new church was named St. George's Presbyterian, and eventually became St. George's United Church at the union of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregationalist Churches in Canada in 1925.\n\nThe reason for the naming is unclear. Normally, Presbyterian Churches aren't named after Saints found outside the Bible, so it's name is all the more intriguing. Nonetheless, St. George is both an interesting historical and mythical figure, best known for later stories of him slaying a dragon and saving a village. What is likely most important about George for our times is that he understood loyalty to God and following Jesus comes even before our loyalty to our nations and tribes.\n\nThe St. George's logo is based on the cross of St. George, which is also featured on the flag of England, where George is patron Saint.\n\nAbout St. George\n\n(from Catholic.org)\n\nIt is uncertain when Saint George was born and historians continue to debate to this day. However, his death date is estimated to be April 23 303 A.D.\n\nThe first piece of evidence of George's existance appeared within the works of the Bollandists Daniel Papebroch, Jean Bolland, and Godfrey Henschen's Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca. George was one of several names listed in the historical text, and Pope Gelasius claimed George was one of the saints \"whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose actions are known only to God.\"\n\nGeorge was born to a Gerontios and Polychronia, a Roman officer and a Greek native of Lydda. Both were Christians from noble families of the Anici and George, Georgios in the original Greek, was raised to follow their faith.\n\nWhen George was old enough, he was welcomed into Diocletian's army. by his late 20's, George became a Tribunus and served as an imperial guard for the Emperor at Nicomedia.\n\nOn February 24, 303 A.D., Diocletian, who hated Christians, announced that every Christian the army passed would be arrested and every other soldier should offer a sacrifice to the Roman gods.\n\nGeorge refused to abide by the order and told Diocletian, who was angry but greatly valued his friendship with George's father.\n\nWhen George announced his beliefs before his peers, Diocletian was unable to keep the news to himself.\n\nIn an effort to save George, Diocletian attempted to convert him to believe in the Roman gods, offered him land, money and slaves in exchange for offering a sacrifice to the Roman gods, and made several other offers that George refused.\n\nFinally, after exhausting all other options, Diocletian ordered George's execution. In preparation for his death, George gave his money to the poor and was sent for several torture sessions. He was lacerated on a wheel of swords and required resuscitation three times, but still George did not turn from God.\n\nOn April 23, 303 A.D., George was decapitated before Nicomedia's outer wall. His body was sent to Lydda for burial, and other Christians went to honor George as a martyr.\n\nSaint George and the Dragon\n\nThere are several stories about George fighting dragons, but in the Western version, a dragon or crocodile made its nest at a spring that provided water to Silene, believed to be modern-day Lcyrene in Libya.\n\nThe people were unable to collect water and so attempted to remove the dragon from its nest on several ocassions. It would temporarily leave its nest when they offered it a sheep each day, until the sheep disappeared and the people were distraught.\n\nThis was when they decided that a maiden would be just as effective as sending a sheep. The townspeople chose the victim by drawing straws. This continued until one day the princess' straw was drawn.\n\nThe monarch begged for her to be spared but the people would not have it. She was offered to the dragon, but before she could be devoured, George appeared. He faced the dragon, protected himself with the sign of the Cross, and slayed the dragon.\n\nAfter saving the town, the citizens abandoned their paganism and were all converted to Christianity.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nSaint George stands out among other saints and legends because he is known and revered by both Muslims and Christians.\n\nIt is said Saint George killed the dragon near the sea in Beirut, thus Saint George bay was named in his honor.\n\nSaint George's feast day is celebrated on April 23, but if it falls before Easter, it is celebrated Easter Monday.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church celebrates three St. George feast days each year -April 23 as is expected, November 3, to commemorate the consecration of a cathedral dedicated to him in Lydda, and on November 26, for when a church in Kiev was dedicated to him.\n\nIn Bulgaria, his feast day is celebrated May 6 with the slaughter and roasting of a lamb.\n\nIn Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria calls St. George the \"Prince of Martyrs\" and celebrates on May 1. There is a second celebration November 17, in honor of the first church dedicated to him.\n\nSaint George is the patron saint of England and Catalonia and his cross can be found throughout England.\n\nIn older works, Saint George is depicted wearing armor and holding a lance or fighting a dragon, which represents Christ's enemies."
