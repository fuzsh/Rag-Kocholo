St George Church History

There are many churches located in the heart of old Coptic Cairo, but St George Church might be the one that holds its soul. The original church was constructed in the 10th century by Athanasius "The 20th Orthodox bishop of Alexandria" on the northern tower of the fortress of Babylon but was unfortunately destroyed by a massive fire in the middle of the last century and a new church was built in 1904 and finished in 1909 on top of an ancient Roman tower in the same location.

St George Church was built to honor Saint George who was a Palestinian conscript in the Roman army and was executed in 303 by Emperor Diocletian for practicing Christianity and is also rumored to have slain a dragon.

St George Church Design

The church is an active house of worship, it also plays an important role in the Coptic community as it is considered to be the countryâ€™s principal Greek Orthodox Church and the monastery operates as the official seat of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria.

The interior of the church is famous for its dark incense and pierced by sunbeams through a stained glass window and a beautiful hall which reminisce some of the mameluke period mansions and displays a 7.6m door that leads to the main hall where the shrine stands and holds the chains that were placed on St. George during his torture under the Persian king Dadianos.

The church also contains around the foundation for anyone who wants to follow the closed stairs down to the remains of the old roman tower.

Tour Name: Experience Egypt Cultural Sightseeing in 10 Days

Experience Date: 28 August, 2024

This was the trip of a lifetime that I was able to have with my eldest son - an absolutelyRead More amazing experience. To be able to actually see the places and artifacts that I had read about and studied was truly phenomenal. Our hotels were great, the travel to and from sites was completely taken care of, we never felt unsafe or left to our own devices, and the itinerary was just right. But what made the experience so fab was our two guides - Mahmoud Nour in Luxor/Aswan/Abu Simbel and "Max" in Cairo/Memphis/Saqqara. They taught us history and context as it related to each site we visited and they indulged my myriad questions. They were both so incredibly knowledgeable and my questions were never ignored or unanswered. In addition, they shared their culture with us and treated us to some awesome dining experiences. We were reminded that Egypt is more than just ancient ruins. I would recommend without reservation this tour experience. And "hats off" to Mahmoud and Max!!! I left feeling like I had made some great new friends. And I can't wait to try some home-made kushari. Read Less

Egypt Tours Portal is an excellent company to use to arrange your visit to Egypt. They worRead Morek with phenomenal guides (we had Mahmoud Nour in Upper Egypt and Mohsen aka Max in Lower Egypt...I would recommend asking for these guides by name, as they were truly superb), make all the necessary arrangements in terms of drivers, covid testing, hotels, and in-country flights, and can tailor your tour to whatever it is you most want to see. The entire experience was smooth from start to finish. Both Mahmoud and Max spoke excellent English, were extremely knowledgeable, and went out of their way to ensure our experience was everything we hoped it would be. This was the second time I have used ETP, and I will continue to recommend them to anyone who expresses any interest in exploring Egypt. We especially liked that our tour group was limited to only our party, which meant we got one-on-one attention at all the sites, and allowed us to get answers to all our questions. And for those of you who are worried about safety or health in Egypt, in our experience it was extremely safe, and we never had any issues related to COVID-19. Cannot recommend Egypt Tours Portal enough. Choose them, you won't regret it. Read Less

Experience Date: 28 August, 2024

This review is a late, but I had to provide some feedback. My brother and I went on vacatiRead Moreon in October 2022 and booked with Egypt Tours Portal. With on-line scams on-going, I was a little wary at first. BUT, the experience was amazing. Personal guides and drivers, lodging, food was amazing and perfect. The guides were very knowledgeable, but more importantly PASSIONATE about their job and culture. They went out of their way to take care of us. If you happen to get Zeze or Marianne, you have gotten the best. Read Less
