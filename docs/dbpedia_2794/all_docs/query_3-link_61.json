        "text": "A central location and fast-moving logistics equal powerful market reach: That’s one reason manufacturers choose Washington County; materials and products flow in and out with ease and cost-effective speed through rail, highway, air and global port. Another reason Washington County is the go-to industry choice: Workforce performance boosted by a rich manufacturing heritage and a talent pipeline powered by Oconee Fall Line Technical College. OFTC stays in close and constant communication with area industry to answer workforce needs through credit and non-credit programs, customized training and flexible pathways to training and employment such as apprenticeships.\n\nPowerfully resourced acreage and an attitude for innovation are also important. Long known as the kaolin capital of the world, home of global kaolin leaders, the county has now welcomed bitcoin mining, easily accommodating large-scale clean energy needs through the cost-competitive service of the county’s three electric providers. Two rail-served industrial sites, both certified as Georgia Ready for Development (GRAD), together offer 700+ acres ready for custom parceling. In a low-cost setting where small town values support excellence and success, manufacturing enjoys room to grow and a warm welcome in receptive communities.\n\nIn Washington County, logistics providers stay on the move and on the grow as they serve a thriving manufacturing sector with multi-modal flexibility and ease. Home of Georgia Department of Transportation District 9 headquarters, the county offers immediate access to the state-spanning Fall Line Freeway, which connects to multiple state routes and interstate highways. Proximity to ports, both Port of Savannah and Port of Brunswick, opens further opportunity. Also keeping Washington County logistics in drive is training by the Oconee Fall Line Technical College, which offers a commercial truck driving program, with diesel equipment training coming online soon.\n\nThe county shows meaningful support for logistics in other ways as well. As one of only three regions in the state to approve the 1% Transportation Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (T-SPLOST), Washington County has been able to implement infrastructure improvements to keep shipping up to speed.\n\nLike all of Georgia’s abundant forest lands, Washington County’s forests are the result of outstanding natural resources and dedicated human effort. Yellow pine grows well in the rich soil here, nurtured carefully season after season. And in Georgia, forestry and planting have been encouraged so that today more land is privately owned than a decade ago. In fact, today Georgia is #1 in the United States in privately owned forestland and #1 in producing tree seedlings; the state also plants more trees than it cuts yearly and produces the most sawn pine in the South.\n\nHere in Washington County that forest abundance translates into abundant opportunity with success facilitated by a labor force that has been identified in recent economic analysis as optimum for the sector in size, skill and affordability. Businesses in the industry are also supported by the efforts and resources of groups such as the Georgia Forestry Association."
