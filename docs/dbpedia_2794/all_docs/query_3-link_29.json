        "text": "What is a Registered Apprenticeship?\n\nA Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP) is a robust & comprehensive training model that helps employers transform and develop entry-level employees into high-skilled talent. RAPs serve as a strategy for building talent pipelines and retaining skilled employees.\n\nA Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP) is a work-based learning system that fulfills workforce needs by preparing individuals for skilled trades through paid On-the-Job Learning (OJL) with Related Technical Instruction (RTI).\n\nMost RAPs are completed in 1-4 years, with actual timelines determined by United States Department of Labor (USDOL) guidelines. The Apprentice will participate in Related Technical Instruction (RTI) – which may include online coursework – as well as work alongside a skilled tradesperson for the Employer partner (OJL) on their way to earning a degree, certification, and/or license, in addition to receiving a nationally recognized USDOL credential in their desired skilled trade.\n\nWhy Apprenticeships?\n\nA Comprehensive Approach\n\nAll RAPs consist of six required components to ensure high-quality training and development of apprentices.\n\nApprenticeship Grant Opportunities\n\nRegistered Apprenticeships in Georgia\n\nAbout the Technical College System of Georgia\n\nThe Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) along with Georgia’s 22 technical colleges serve as the state’s largest network of registered apprenticeship sponsors. Each technical college, in partnership with TCSG’s Office of Workforce Development, can help employers access the support and guidance needed to get a RAP off the ground, including:\n\nUnderstanding U.S. Registered Apprenticeship Model\n\nIdentifying Apprenticeable Occupations\n\nIdentifying the approved Training Models (including Work Processes and Technical Instruction Outlines) and assisting with aligning models to employer needs\n\nServing as a Liaison with the USDOL Office of Apprenticeship\n\nServing as the Apprenticeship Sponsor and Technical Instruction Provider\n\nAccess to Apprenticeship Funding Opportunities\n\nParticipating Colleges\n\nResources"
