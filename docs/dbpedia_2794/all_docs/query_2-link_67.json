        "text": "At Georgia Military College (GMC), providing pathways to educational opportunities is one of our core missions. This means one of our focuses as an institution is ensuring the successful transferability of our degree programs and coursework to four- and six-year institutions. Whether you take one class or complete your associate or bachelor degree, we want your time at Georgia Military College to provide a strong foundation as you continue your education at a four- or six-year college or university. Our SACSCOC accreditation ensures that many of the courses you take at GMC will transfer to the institution of your choice (See info on transferring course credits). In addition, GMC makes every effort to pursue articulation (transfer) agreements with four- or six-year institutions to make the transition even easier. Currently, Georgia Military College students have guaranteed acceptance into 39 colleges and universities across the nation, provided students meet the criteria outlined in these agreements.\n\nWe also offer pathways of opportunity for students who have earned credit towards an associate degree at another institution to enter one of our bachelor of applied science degree programs, all of which transfer to allow students to pursue a master degree.\n\nWhat is an Articulation Agreement?\n\nAn articulation agreement is just that – an agreement. It is an agreement between two institutions that creates a specific pathway for successful transfer to one institution from another. The agreements outline how the courses you take at one institution will transfer into another institution and what specific credit you will be awarded at the institution based on these transfer credits. This helps students to better plan their coursework to match their future educational goals. Most of our articulation agreements guarantee students direct admission into the colleges or universities listed below, provided the student meets the requirements outlined in the agreement.\n\nHow Can I Use These Agreements?\n\nThese agreements provide a pathway a student can use to be accepted into a four- or six-year college or university, or to pursue a bachelor degree at GMC. For example, if you did not receive acceptance into your four-year university of choice on your first try, instead of giving up on that goal of attending there, you can enroll in classes at Georgia Military College and work to meet the requirements of acceptance through our 67 articulation agreements with colleges and universities across the nation. Attending classes at our traditional college campus in Milledgeville, at one of our multiple satellite campuses across the state, or virtually through our Global Online Leadership College, will allow you to obtain your first two years of coursework, complete an associate degree, and then transfer into the four-year institution of your choice as a junior to complete your bachelor’s degree. Our articulation agreements make it easy to reach your goal of attending and graduating from the four-year college or university you desire!\n\nGMC has 47 articulation agreements already in place with 4- and 6-year colleges and universities across the nation, 39 of which include guaranteed acceptance into the institution, and we are adding more every year. We recommend you meet with your GMC Graduation Coach early in your educational career at GMC to discuss transfer options and to help ensure you are meeting the requirements outlined in the articulation agreement.\n\nFor students wishing to transfer into one of GMC’s bachelor programs, we have 21 articulation agreements in place that include guaranteed admission into one of our 7 Bachelor of Applied Science degrees. We recommend you contact one of our enrollment coaches for guidance with the transfer process.\n\nAgreements marked with an * are guaranteed admission agreements. Please note that guaranteed admission is to the institution and not necessarily to all degree programs at that institution as some programs have additional requirements for admission.\n\nArticulation Agreements to transfer into other institution’s Bachelor Degrees currently exist with:\n\nAgnes Scott College*\n\nAlbany State University*\n\nArt Institute of Atlanta (AIA)\n\nAtlanta Metropolitan State College*\n\nAuburn University at Montgomery*\n\nAugusta University\n\nBerry College*\n\nBrenau University*\n\nBrewton-Parker College*\n\nCarson-Newman University*\n\nColumbus State University\n\nDalton State College*\n\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)\n\nEmmanuel College*\n\nFort Valley State University*\n\nGeorgia College & State University*\n\nGeorgia Gwinnett College*\n\nGeorgia Southern University*\n\nGeorgia Southwestern State University*\n\nGeorgia State University*\n\nKennesaw State University*\n\nLaGrange College*\n\nMercer University*\n\nMiddle Georgia State University*\n\nNorwich University*\n\nOglethorpe University*\n\nPaine College*\n\nPark University*\n\nPiedmont University*\n\nPoint University*\n\nReinhardt University*\n\nSavannah State University*\n\nShorter University*\n\nSouth College-Atlanta Campus\n\nSouthern New Hampshire University*\n\nStrayer University*\n\nTennessee State University*\n\nThe Citadel*\n\nThomas University*\n\nToccoa Falls College*\n\nTrident University International*\n\nTroy University\n\nUniversity of North Georgia\n\nValdosta State University*\n\nWesleyan College*\n\nWestern Kentucky University*\n\nYoung Harris College*\n\nAgreements marked with an * are guaranteed admission agreements.
