        "text": "RNSG 1170- Foundations of Nursing- Unit 3- Study Guide\n\nBe sure to listen to all lectures and take notes for studying in addition to using this study guide!\n\nPurposes of the health care record (pg. 390):\n\n Facilitates interprofessional communication among health care providers- communication about multiple aspects of patient care, including patient needs and response to care and therapies; clinical decision making; content and outcomes of consultations, patient education and discharge planning.  Provides a legal record of care provided and justification for financial billing and reimbursement of care.  Used to audit, monitor, and evaluate care provided to support the process needed for quality and performance improvement.  A resource for education and research.\n\nDifference between the EHR and the EMR (pg. 392):\n\n EHR- Electronic Health Record: an individual’s lifetime computerized record; both displayed or printed.  EMR- Electronic Medical Record: a patient’s record within an integrated heath care information system for an individual visit to a provider’s office or for an individual admission to an acute care setting that allows for seamless documentation of the progression of care.\n\nBe able to apply standards, basic principles and legal guidelines for quality documentation (for both handwritten and electronic documentation) (pg. 394)\n\n Follow agency standards or policies for documentation.  Documentation needs to conform to the standards of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and accrediting bodies such as The Joint Commission to maintain agency accreditation and to minimize liability.  Documentation needs to demonstrate application of the nursing process, describe clinical decision making, and include evidence of patient and family teaching and discharge planning.\n\nFive characteristics of quality documentation (pg. 394)\n\n Factual: contains clear descriptive, objective information about what a nurse observes, hears, palpates, and smells. No opinions. The only subjective data included in the record are statements made by a patient.  Accurate: avoid irrelevant details, use exact measurements, use correct spelling and approved abbreviations, use accurate date and time for all entries.  Current: document interventions and findings at the time they were administered/found.  Organized: concise, clear and to the point, presented in a logical order.  Complete\n\nResponsibilities related to maintaining confidentiality, privacy, and security of medical records\n\n Nurses are legally and ethically obligated to keep all patient information confidential.\n\n Do not post private health information on social media  HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-1996): The first federal legislation to provide protection for patient records; it governs all areas of patient info and management of that info.  Information should only be shared with those directly responsible for client’s care.\n\nDocumentation related to incidents or occurrences (pg. 400):\n\nAn incident or occurrence report is completed when an incident occurs. Analysis of incident reports helps identify system and/or individual human issues in which education or in-service [programs or changes in policies and procedures are needed to reduce risk of future occurrences. They are not part of the health care record. Incidents reports contain confidential information; distribution is limited to the individual responsible for reviewing the forms.\n\nWhat should guide your nursing documentation? (hint—pg. 389- 3rd paragraph, first sentence; and page 390 1st paragraph last sentence under “legal documentation” heading; discussed in the Documentation article under the ANA Standards of Practice)\n\n It is necessary to document all the nursing care you provide for each patient, including assessment data, nursing problems or diagnoses, interventions, and evaluation of patient responses, in the health record. Your data enable providers and outside reviewers of the medical record to track a patient’s clinical course.  Documenting all aspects of the nursing process is a critical nursing responsibility that limits nursing liability by providing evidence that you maintained or exceeded practice standards while taking care of patients.\n\nRead and look for key information related to Methods of documentation, Common Record Keeping Forms within the EHR and Documenting Communication with Providers and Unique Events (pgs- 400).\n\n Flow sheets: Graphic records organized by body system and navigated through use of the computer mouse with a series of tabs or rows that are used to document patient physiological data and routine care.  Charting by exception (CBE): all standards for normal assessment findings or for routine care activities are met unless otherwise documented.  Narrative documentation: the format traditionally used to record patient assessment, clinical decisions, and care provided; consists of a story like format to document information.  PIE: has a specific nursing focus  P: Nursing problem or diagnosis- Lack of Knowledge related to inexperience with disease condition.  I: Interventions that will be used to address the problem- Provided brochure on anticoagulation therapy for DVT. Explained rationale for bed rest and daily blood tests to check for anticoagulation levels. Explained that heparin infusion will be stopped with PT/INR is at therapeutic level.  E: Nursing evaluation- Patient states, “I’m worried about the blood clot, but I understand how it is being treated.” Able to teach back and verbalize that the heparin infusion will be stopped when PT/INR tests are “normal.”\n\n Nursing informatics: the specialty that integrates nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, information, knowledge and wisdom in nursing and informatics practice.\n\nDescribe the purposes of and standards for patient education. Identify the role of the nurse in teaching and learning.\n\n The primary goal of patient education is to help individuals, families, or communities achieve optimal levels of health.  Patient education through active patient participation and decision making is essential for providing safe, patient-centered care.  The Joint Commission sets standards for patient and family education.\n\nList and describe the three domains of learning. Be able to identify teaching methods based on each domain. (pg 368)\n\n Cognitive learning: occurs when an individual gains information to further develop intellectual abilities, mental capacities, understanding, and thinking processes. Cognitive behaviors include remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, and evaluating.  Discussion: promotes active participation  Lecture: more formal method of instruction. Helps learner acquire new knowledge and gain comprehension.  Question-and-answer session: addresses patient’s specific concerns. Helps patient apply knowledge.  Role-play, discovery: allows patient to actively apply knowledge in controlled situation  Affective learning: deals with learning how to express feelings and emotions and to develop values, attitudes, and beliefs needed toward improving health.  Role play: allows expression of values, feelings, and attitudes  Discussion (group): allows patient to receive support from group. Helps patient learn from others’ experiences.  Discussion (on-on-one): allows discussion of personal, sensitive topics of interest or concern  Psychomotor learning: involves the development of manual or physical skills, such as learning how to walk or how to type on a computer. Involves acquiring motor skills that require coordination and integration of mental and physical movements.  Demonstration: provides presentation of procedure or skills by nurse. Allows patient to model nurse’s behavior.  Practice: give patient opportunity to perform skills using equipment in a controlled setting. Provides repetition.  Return demonstration: Patient performs skill as nurse observes. Provides excellent source of feedback and reinforcement. Determines patient’s ability to correctly perform a skill or technique.  Independent projects, games: learner uses new skills\n\nHow does the nursing process adapt to patient teaching? Be able to apply essential nursing actions/considerations related to each step of the teaching process.\n\n Assessment: identifying a patient’s learning needs, motivation, and ability to learn. Determine a patient’s expectations for learning and expectations for any teaching encounter (through the patient’s eyes).  Learning needs are “gaps in knowledge that exist between a desired level of performance and the actual level of performance.”  Motivation- is the patient prepared and willing to learn? Access perception of the severity or health problems. Assess desire to learn and learning style preferences. Assess attitudes about health care providers- role of patient and nurse in making decisions.  Ability to learn- Cognitive function (memory, knowledge, judgement), sensory deficits (visual or hearing loss) that may affect understanding or ability to follow instruction, patients reading and developmental level. Also assess for pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, or other physical or psychological symptoms that interfere with the ability to maintain attention and participate.  Analysis and Nursing Diagnosis: interpret data and cluster assessment findings to form diagnoses that reflect specific learning needs or factors affecting the ability to learn. Example diagnoses: Decisional Conflict, Lack of Knowledge, Impaired Health Maintenance, Self-Care Deficit.  Planning and Outcomes Identification: After determining diagnoses that identify a patient’s leaning needs, develop a teaching plan, determine expected outcomes, and involve the patient in selecting learning experiences. (Expected outcomes of an education plan are learning objectives)  Implementation: Active patient participation is key to learning. Build on existing knowledge. Use reinforcement in teaching.  Educate model for verbal instruction  Enhance comprehension and retention  Deliver patient-centered education  Understand the learner  Communicate clearly and effectively  Address health literacy  Measure outcomes of Teaching and Education\n\nWhat instructional methods are useful in teaching patients? [see #11] How can you vary your instructional methods for patients? (e. older adults, children, sensory impaired, culturally diverse, learning disability, health illiteracy)\n\n Establish trust  Get on the patient’s level for their comfort  Speak slowly and invite patient participation  Keep teaching sessions short and to the point  Use graphics: pictures, illustrations, models  Ask for feedback  Reinforce the most important information at the end of the session\n\n Pulse Oximetry (SpO2): > or = 95%  Respirations: 12 to 20 breaths/min, deep and regular  Blood pressure:  Systolic < 120 mmHg  Diastolic < 80 mmHg  Pulse pressure: 30 to 50 mmHg  Capnography (EtCO2): 35-45 mmHg\n\nWhat factors affect changes in body temp, pulse, respirations and B/P? (pg. 501)\n\n Temperature: heat produced – heat lost = body temperature  Site of measurement affects temp reading  Time of day: lowest at 6am, highest at 4pm  Shivering: involuntary response to temp differences. Sometimes increases heat production 4 to 5 times greater than normal. In vulnerable patients, shivering seriously drains energy sources, resulting in further deterioration  Heat loss occurs through:  Conduction: transfer of heat from the body directly to another surface (immersion in cold water)  Convection: dispersion of heat by air currents (wind blowing across skin)  Evaporation: Dispersion of heat through water vapor (perspiration)  Radiation: Transfer of head from one object to another without direct contact (heat lost to a cold room)  Pulse: palpable bounding of blood flow in a peripheral artery  Exercise  Temperature: fever increases, hypothermia decreases  Acute pain: increases, chronic pain varies  Emotions: anxiety increases  Medications: positive chronotropic increase, negative chronotropic decrease  Hemorrhage: blood loss increases  Postural changes: standing or sitting increases, lying down decreases  Pulmonary conditions: poor oxygenation (asthma, COPD) increases  Respirations: Three processes; ventilation (mechanical movement of gases into and out of the lungs), diffusion (movement of oxygen and CO2 between the alveoli and the red blood cells), and perfusion (distribution of red blood cells to and from the pulmonary capillaries).  Exercise  Acute pain  Anxiety  Smoking: increases rate  Body position  Medications  Neurological injury  Hemoglobin function: anemia reduces oxygen-carrying capacity and increases respiratory rate. Abnormal cell function (sickle cell) reduces ability of hemoglobin to carry O2, increasing respiratory rate and depth.\n\n Blood pressure: the force exerted on the walls of an artery by the pulsing blood under pressure from the heart. Systolic: max peak pressure during ventricular contraction. Diastolic pressure: minimal pressure during ventricular relaxation. Pulse pressure: difference between systolic and diastolic pressure.  Age  Stress: increases HR, cardiac output, and vascular resistance> BP  Ethnicity and Genetics  Gender  Daily variation: lower BP during sleep (midnight-3am), slowly rises between 3am and 6am. Highest between 10am and 6pm.  Medications  Activity and weight  Smoking: vasoconstriction o Hypertension: Most common alteration in BP. Stage 1: 130-139/80-89. Stage 2: >140/90.  Thickening and loss of elasticity in arterial walls  Family history  Obesity, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, high sodium intake, sedentary lifestyle, stress. o Hypotension: less than 90 systolic. Caused by dilation of arteries, blood loss, failure of the heart to pump adequately (myocardial infarction)  Decreased blood flow to organs  Orthostatic hypotension: Drop in systolic by at least 20 mmHg or diastolic by at least 10 mmHg. Caused by inability to constrict lower extremity blood vessels (dehydration, anemia, blood loss).\n\nSteps to ensure accuracy when performing each vital sign measurement. (e. how does cuff size and arm position affect B/P reading?) Also, remember variation of measurement techniques according to site of measurement, age of patient, etc. (pg. 519, table 29)\n\n Lower extremity BP: popliteal artery, palpable behind the knee, is the site for lower extremity BP measurement. *Systolic pressure in the legs is usually higher by 10 to 40 mmHg than in the brachial artery, but the diastolic pressure is the same.  Do not used electronic BP measurement in the case of: irregular HR, known HTN, peripheral vascular obstruction (clots, narrowed vessels), shivering, seizures, excessive tremors, inability to cooperate, BP less than 90 mmHg systolic.  Rectal temp contraindicated in infants <1 moth due to risk of rectal perforation.  Do not use axilla if skin lesions are present; local temp is sometimes altered, and area may be painful to touch.  When measuring tympanic temp: For adults; pull pinna backward, up, and out. Children >3; pull pinna up and back. For children <3; pull pinna down and back and point probe toward midpoint between eyebrow and sideburns.\n\nBe able to select the best temp. route, pulse assessment site for certain patient scenarios\n\n Three processes; ventilation (mechanical movement of gases into and out of the lungs), diffusion (movement of oxygen and CO2 between the alveoli and the red blood cells), and perfusion (distribution of red blood cells to and from the pulmonary capillaries).  Ventilation: determine respiratory rate, depth, rhythm, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). Diffusion and Perfusion: determine oxygen saturation (SPO2).  Patients with chronic lung disease have ongoing hypercarbia. Chemoreceptors in the carotid artery and aorta become sensitive to hypoxemia (low levels of arterial O2). When arterial O levels fall, these receptors signal the brain to increase the rate and depth of ventilation. Hypoxemia helps to control ventilation in patients with chronic lung disease. Oxygen should be used very carefully in these patients. When arterial O2 levels fall below 88%, supplemental O may be required.\n\nRead over all skills (pgs. 525-546)... though you think you know all of this!! So many questions on this EXAM and NCLEX will come from small details... pay attention to rationales for each step and focus on small things that you would do to insure/validate a. You need to know unexpected outcomes and how to intervene, what to report and document and any other considerations related to each vital sign measurement.\n\nWhat are the four basic techniques when performing a physical assessment on a patient? What is involved with each technique? (pg. 553-556)\n\n Inspection: Carefully looking, listening, and smelling to distinguish normal from abnormal findings.  Palpation: Using the sense of touch to gather information  Use the palmar surface of the hand and finger pads to determine position, texture, size, consistency, masses, fluid, crepitus, and vibration.  Use the dorsal surface of the hand to assess skin temperature.  Begin abdominal palpation with the right lower quadrant.  Percussion: Tapping the skin with the fingertips to vibrate underlying tissues and organs. The vibration travels through tissues, and the character of the resulting sound reflects the density of the underlying tissue. The denser the tissue, the quieter the sound.  Auscultation: listening to sounds the body makes to detect variations from normal.  Frequency: higher frequency- higher pitch  Loudness: amplitude of a sound wave. Range from soft to loud.  Quality: refers to sounds of similar frequency and loudness from different sources. Terms such as blowing or gurgling describe the quality of sound.  Duration: Length of time sound vibrations last.\n\nPreparation for a physical exam (pg. 550)\n\n Infection control  Environment: privacy, lighting, exam table for easy access.  Equipment: Gather and prepare necessary equipment prior to beginning.  Physical preparation of patient: privacy, comfort, positioning  Psychological preparation of patient: explanations throughout exam, consider cultural and societal norms, observe patient’s emotional responses.\n\n Assessment of age groups: use different interview styles and approaches to physical examination for patients of different age groups.\n\nOrganization of a physical exam (pg. 553)\n\n Follow a systematic routine when you perform a physical exam to avoid missing important findings. A head-to-toe approach includes all body systems, and the examiner recalls and performs each step in a predetermined order.\n\nWhat types of information do you assess when you are reviewing a patient’s general appearance and behavior? (pg. 557-558)\n\n Gender and race  Age  Signs of distress: set priorities and examine the related physical areas first when distress noted.  Body type  Posture  Gait  Body movements  Hygiene and grooming  Dress  Body odor  Affect (how a person appears to others) and mood  Speech  Signs of abuse  Substance abuse\n\nYou are responsible for knowing the information presented in both lecture and lab related to assessment of each body system. Be sure to review your lab performance criteria and notes related to VS and physical assessment (including but not just these specific items: skin turgor, anatomical landmarks of the thorax/lungs/apical pulse, pitting edema, peripheral pulses, order of assessing abdomen, how long to listen if bowel sounds are absent). Know how to document your findings.\n\nReview math\n\nComplete the Assigned ATI assignment: 1) Learn tab- Nurse’s Touch- Professional Communication- Client Education 2) Test tab- Learning Systems RN 3- Gerontology Final\n\nOptional ATI assignments for reinforcement of the Unit 3 lesson content: Skills Modules 3- Comprehensive physical assessment of an adult; Skills Modules 3- Vital signs; Engage Fundamentals RN Professional Nursing- Communication; Fundamentals RN- Professional Nursing- Documentation; Fundamentals RN Foundational Concepts of Nursing Practice Client Education; Engage Fundamentals RN Foundational Concepts of Nursing Practice Vital signs\n\nDon’t forget that your Fundamentals ATI Content Review Manual is also a good thing to skim through quickly after you have studied everything else: Chapter 5, Chapter 17, Chapters 26-\n\n*Apical pulse measurement and orthostatic vital sign measurement cannot be delegated.\n\n*Romberg test is the most common test for assessing balance (Feet together, arms at sides, both eyes open then closed. Observe for swaying)\n\n*Use the diaphragm of the stethoscope for high-pitched sounds and the bell for low-pitched sounds.\n\nNormal adult lab values:\n\n Hemoglobin:  Male: 14-18 g/dL  Female: 12-16 g/d:  Hematocrit:  Male: 42%-52%  Female: 37%-47%  WBC: 5,000-10,000/mm  Platelets: 150,000-400,000/mm"
