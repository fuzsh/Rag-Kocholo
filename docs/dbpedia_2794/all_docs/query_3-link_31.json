        "text": "SAVANNAH – Savannah Technical College was ranked first in the U.S. by Military Times with the new rankings Military Times Best: Career & Technical Colleges 2018 rankings for the second year in a row. This ranking is formerly known as Best for Vets. The organization, made up of Army Times, Navy Times, Air Force Times and Marine Corps Times, is focused on culture and curriculum that cater to military veterans when conducting and scoring the annual survey of schools that self-identify as career and technical colleges.\n\n“I am so proud that Savannah Technical College has maintained its top spot in the U.S. as the #1 Military Times Best College in the nation for career and technical colleges by Military Times,” said STC President Dr. Kathy Love. “Our active duty military students, their family members, and our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country. I believe it is our responsibility to provide anything and everything they need as they pursue their higher education goals.”\n\nOne in four STC students is a veteran, active duty service member or a military dependent/spouse. The College waives all general mandatory fees for active duty service members using military tuition assistance. Three years ago, Savannah Tech opened a Veteran’s Service Center at the Savannah campus. Savannah Tech has the largest enrollment of military-affiliated students in the Technical College System of Georgia.\n\nRecently, Savannah Technical College hosted a Veterans Career Fair in partnership with the Georgia Department of Labor. This annual career fair offers local companies the opportunity to meet with veterans and their families about job openings.\n\nOther services Savannah Tech offers for veterans include workshops and grants. In June 2017, Savannah Tech announced a new scholarship to cover gap funding for spouses of U.S. Coast Guard members. It provides financial support for tuition, fees, books and tools/equipment that students need for programs at the college up to $4,000 per student.\n\nLast year, the Freedom Fund was established to provide scholarship assistance for soldiers, veteran and spouses thanks to a generous donation. The needs-based fun supports those who serve by buying books and tools for active duty service members, paying registration fees each semester for military spouses (MyCAA) students and covering unpaid tuition and registration fees up to 100% for those with VA benefits not covering 100% education benefits.\n\nAnother scholarship that supports Savannah Tech’s military spouses is funded by The Landings Military Family Relief Fund. This scholarship fund provides tuition assistance to military spouses eligible for the MYCAA program, who have exhausted their benefits. The Landings Military Spouse Academic Assistance Fund awards a maximum of $2,000 annually for up to two years, for a total of $4,000 per student.\n\nSavannah Tech’s Military Outreach Coordinator Jeff Ashmen coordinates a variety of initiatives enabling current and former military personnel, as well as their family members, to enroll in the college, graduate, and engage in careers with our local industries and businesses. Ashmen’s extensive background in the U.S. Army includes more than three decades of experience in key military positions, culminating as the 3rd Infantry Division Command Sergeant Major at Ft. Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Ga.\n\n“We continue to look for ways to support military-affiliated students,” said STC Military Outreach Coordinator Jeff Ashmen. Savannah Technical College offers programs that help area veterans get the technical skills and certifications employers are looking for quickly. “Savannah Technical College has a 99 percent job placement rate overall and 89% placement in field, so we really have our fingers on the pulse of what employers are looking for in a trained workforce,” Ashmen said.\n\nMilitary Times’ annual Best Colleges survey asks colleges and universities to meticulously document a tremendous array of services, special rules, accommodations and financial incentives offered to students with military ties; and to describe many aspects of veteran culture on a campus. Military Times also factors in data from the Veterans Affairs and Defense departments, as well as three Education Department sources: the IPEDS Data Center, College Scorecard data and the Cohort Default Rate Database.\n\nFor the full Military Times Best: Colleges 2018: Career & Technical Colleges rankings, go to: http://bestforvets.militarytimes.com/colleges/career-technical-colleges/2018.\n\nMilitary Times’ Best rankings series includes Military Times Best: Colleges, Military Times Best: Franchises, Military Times Best: Places to Live and Best for Vets Employers.\n\nFor more information about military services or enrollment, visit www.savannahtech.edu/military or contact Ashmen (912.443.4155 or jashmen@savannahtech.edu).\n\nAbout Military Times\n\nThe Military Times digital platforms and newsweeklies are the trusted source for independent news and information for service members and their families.

Basic Law Enforcement Training Course. Their successful completion of the program qualifies them to be state-certified peace officers.\n\nThis is the 23rd group of students to complete the program since its inception in 2009. To date, the program has graduated 303 P.O.S.T.-certified officers. Many candidates are in various stages of the application process with statewide agencies. Several candidates have been hired by area police departments. Savannah Tech’s Peace Officer Academy has a 97% placement rate.\n\nEach cohort selects a fallen officer for whom the graduating class will be named. The cohorts have a tradition of giving the family of the fallen officer a challenge coin dedicated to the officer. A challenge coin is a symbol of an unbreakable bond of dedication and allegiance among military personnel and law enforcement officers. The challenge coin tradition started as a military tradition in World War I and was later adopted by law enforcement.\n\nThis cohort honors Corporal Tron Lewis of the Tybee Island Police Department. Corporal Lewis passed away suddenly on April 8, 2017, due to a traffic collision. He is survived by his wife Natasha Collins, parents Arlanza and Lena Young Lewis of Waycross, and three brothers.\n\nThe Basic Law Enforcement Technical Certificate of Credit provides students with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to become competent law enforcement officers. The 20-week cohort program utilizes classroom instruction pertaining to criminal justice theory and the prevailing principles of modern law enforcement, as well as practical application of pertinent enforcement skills. College coursework contains the entire Georgia Peace Officers Standards & Training (P.O.S.T.) Basic Law Enforcement Training Course so that successful completion of the program will qualify the student to be a state-certified peace officer.\n\nFor more information about the Peace Officer Academy visit www.savannahtech.edu/PeaceOfficerAcademy or contact Sheree Rogers at 912.443.5191 or srogers@savannahtech.edu.

They were able to use this fix to bring Troup Square’s Jingle Bells historical marker back to life after it was damaged by Hurricane Matthew.\n\n“We focus on pushing the boundaries of methods, materials and techniques to innovate and invent new product procedures, instead of using antiquated or out-of-date methods in historic preservation,” said STC’s Department Head for Historic Preservation Benjamin Curran. “Our intent with this collar design was to provide an economical solution to a regular issue that arises with historical markers.”\n\nThe Georgia Historical Society took over maintenance, repair and replacement of state-owned historical markers in 2015. According to Elyse Butler, outreach coordinator for the Georgia Historical Society, a falling limb or automobile accident usually causes significant damage to the historical marker’s collar, or base where the post attaches. Then, the marker is usually scrapped. The protocol in the past has been to reinstall or recast damaged signs at a cost of about $3,000 dollars at a foundry outside of Georgia.\n\n“Savannah Technical College’s prototype is a great option to have without recasting the entire marker,” said Butler. “It would give us the opportunity to perhaps work locally rather than go back to the foundry to repair markers.”\n\nSTC students have designed, engineered and cast a channeled historic marker collar replacement bracket or base that could be adapted to fit different marker designs. The collar may be manufactured in large quantities, taken into the field, and used to replace a damaged collars at a substantially reduced cost. Also, it will allow the text section of the signs to be preserved rather than discarded.\n\nUnitarian Universalist Church (aka the Jingle Bells Church) had originally erected the sign and wanted to fix it. They were raising funds to have the overall sign recast, when they learned of the STC prototype.\n\n“The mending of our jingle Bells historic marker is a symbolic event all about bringing together,” said Rev. David Messner of Unitarian Universalist Church of Savannah. “First and most simply it’s about securing two pieces of sheared metal. But more importantly, it brings us as people together with the people of 1850’s Savannah when the song was written. It brings together the neighborhood community to celebrate a shared spirit. And, it brought together an awesome team of craftspeople in training at Savannah Tech to innovate a solution and to make it happen. Special thanks to Professor Benjamin Curran for leading that work, the people of the Troup square community who participated in the funding campaign and to Gordon Matthews and the Board of our church for their guiding energy.”\n\nDaniel Carey, President and CEO for the Historic Savannah Foundation, knew about the STC collar design and reached out to Curran to see if the prototype might work for the Jingle Bells marker repair.\n\n“Let’s not overlook the fact that the marker, itself, is an historic artifact,” said Carey. “Under the category of using the ‘gentlest means possible’ to repair an historic resource, Savannah Technical College developed a sensitive, sound, and thrifty method of preserving a marker using local talent and resources. That’s the gift that keeps on giving. Perfect.”\n\nStudents from the Historic Preservation and Restoration department worked with students from Drafting, Welding and Machine Tool to create the prototype. A mechanical drafting student worked with the original sketches to create a design and print samples of 3D versions. The drafting student’s 3D print was used to create the form that was used to cast the collar mold. Welding students helped to build the furnace that was used to melt aluminum prior to casting. Machine Tool students assisted with CNC machining.\n\n“As an institution Savannah Technical College strives to provide its students with the knowledge and skills that will make them valued members of our local and regional workforce,” said Curran. “Within the Industrial Technology department, we collectively focus on industry need, regardless of discipline. That has manifest itself in constant push to provide our students with opportunities to view themselves not simply technician, but also as contributors to the advancement of their respective fields. Innovation is the key. The historic marker collar replacement bracket perfectly exemplifies our students’ technical talents and creative capacity to further the advancement of the Historic Preservation field.”\n\nSTC Historic Preservation students cast the first replacement bracket this spring under the guidance of Visiting Artisan Gary Knappenberger, who helped STC students with a finial casting for the Smithsonian Institute a few years ago (2013). He assisted with the mold making process and helped students build a small furnace large enough to melt down aluminum to pour multiple brackets for the casting process.\n\nThe STC Foundation is seeking a patent on the development of the historic marker fabrication process.\n\nAs the only public hands-on Historic Preservation program in Georgia and one of seven in the U.S., Savannah Technical College has led the way in preservation education, specializing in training not typically held by construction workers. The program has gained international recognition and has contributed to a number of community-based preservation projects in the surrounding communities. Traditional Building Magazine named Savannah Tech’s Historic Preservation program one of the nation’s Up and Coming programs.\n\nFor more information visit:www.savannahtech.edu/CenterTraditionalCraft or contact Curran at bcurran@savannahtech.edu or 912.443.5864.\n\nJingle Bells Historical Marker: James L. Pierpont (1822-1893), composer of “Jingle Bells”, served as music director of this church in the 1850s when it was a Unitarian Church located on Oglethorpe Square. Son of the noted Boston reformer, Rev. John Pierpont, he was the brother of Rev. John Pierpont, Jr. minister of this church, and uncle of financier John Pierpont Morgan. He married Eliza Jane Purse, daughter of Savannah mayor Thomas Purse, and served with a Confederate cavalry regiment. He is buried in Laurel Grove Cemetery. A prolific song-writer, his best known “Jingle Bells” is world famous.\n\n#1809 | October 19, 2017\n\nIndustrial Technology Academic Advisor: Secene Dorsey\n\n912.443.5859 or ssdorsey@savannahtech.edu\n\nMedia Contact: Amy Shaffer, APR\n\n912.443.5512 or ashaffer@savannahtech.edu\n\nSavannah Technical College serves Coastal Georgia with quality, market-driven technical education with campus locations in Chatham, Effingham and Liberty Counties.

Savannah Technical College’s career skills program is an opportunity for active duty service members to get retooled to quality for jobs after military service.”\n\nThe College’s welding training for these students was provided through state and federal grants, along with additional funding from Huntington Ingalls Industries. Students attended welding classes during their normal duty day, Mondays – Thursdays. Commander approval and pre-employment screening were required for them to participate. Training occurred as part of the Soldier for Life VOW Act and became the soldier’s place of duty.\n\n“The partnership between Fort Stewart, Huntington Ingalls Industries, and Savannah Technical College provides soldiers and families with a wonderful opportunity to prepare for their post active duty careers and begin the next part of their lives,” said Geoff Miller, President of Transitions Assistant Support, LLC.\n\nDuring the 16-week full-time program including hands-on, competency-based structural and pipe welding instruction, students completed 32 college hours and earned five welding technical certificates of credit (TCC): Basic Shielded Metal Arc Welder, Vertical Shielded Metal Arc Welder, Advanced Shielded Metal Arc Welder, Flux Cored Arc Welder, and Gas Tungsten Arc Welder TCCs.\n\n“Huntington Ingalls Industries remains committed to becoming a leadership factory,” said Fred Howell, Huntington Ingalls Industries Director of Talent Acquisition. “Through our partnership with Savannah Technical College, Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, we are creating great shipbuilders, but more importantly, we are creating future leaders for our organization.”\n\nTransitioning service members, who participate in welding training completion, will have a high probability of employment with Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi or Newport News, Va.; will be tested at the end of the training period prior to final job offer; will be offered a job opportunity upon successful completion of the training; and will continue with on-the-job training while working with experienced craftsmen at Ingalls.\n\nThe average starting salary for pipe welders is $19.46 per hour or $40,476.80 annually.\n\nThe next welding cohort begins October 11, 2017.
