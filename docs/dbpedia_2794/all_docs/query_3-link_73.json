        "text": "Guest Post Submitted by: Suzanne Korngold, Oconee County School District\n\nOconee County's special education department had 16 juniors and seniors take part in a Manufacturing Institute through High School High Tech. Manufacturing Industries like Kubota, KIA Motors, and Caterpillar employ nearly half a million Georgians. As the manufacturing industry in our state grows, the need for skilled workers grows with it.\n\nThe Manufacturing Institute is an exciting opportunity for students to gain industry-recognized certifications that can result in them being more marketable to employers!\n\nThis is a 3-day training experience for HSHT students in your county school system. The purpose of the training is to learn more about the field of manufacturing, and students will earn 3 certifications that can go on a resume and assist with obtaining employment as they transition out of high school. Activities include tours, hands-on activities, speakers, and much more!\n\nThese certification training sessions exceeded our expectations. The presenters have been highly organized, efficient, and informative when providing information and hands-on training to our students. It is my belief, as director of special education in Oconee County, that these 3 days may indeed be the most beneficial 3 days of several students' high school careers. We are beyond excited that 15 of our students from NOHS and OCHS will be walking out with an OSHA-10 certification, a Lean Six Sigma White Belt certification, and a CPR/AED certification.\n\nSeventy eight (78) students from Whitfield, Walker, Fannin and Murray counties participated in a College and Career Fair sponsored by the Georgia High School High Tech Program and the Community Foundation of Northwest Georgia at the Dalton Convention Center in Dalton, Georgia, on March 12, 2020. This event was funded by the generous support of Operation Round Up administered by the Community Foundation of Northwest Georgia.\n\nThere were 24 different businesses and post-secondary education institutions represented with over 50 employers and post-secondary staff in attendance. Employers brought “tools of the trade” so that students could have a “hands on” experience and learn about different jobs. For example, Dalton Utilities brought a mock utility pole so that students could gain a clear understanding of the tasks associated with working with a utility company. The Elite Lineman Training Institute also had a representative at the event and had a table near Dalton Utilities. Students were able to learn about the training program offered by Elite Lineman that would give them the qualifications needed to apply for a job with utility companies.\n\nAll employers and staff from post-secondary educational institutions were very engaging with students, and these students gained valuable information as they set career goals after graduating from high school.​\n\nCrisp County High School students attended a tour of the main campus at ABAC in Tifton. The students watched a video with information about the college. The information included the history of the college and degrees that can be obtained, including the prerequisites for medical school and various biology and agricultural degrees. Students learned about the cost of attendance and various scholarships and grants available to them. They were also told about tutoring that is available to them while they are students at ABAC. This tutoring is free to students and available throughout the year. The students were taken on a tour of the campus. They toured academic buildings, a chapel, medical clinic, theatre, and the college dormitories. The students had the opportunity to speak to current college students about academics and club organizations.\n\nTaliaferro County High School HSHT students had the opportunity to tour Oconee Fall Line Technical College on March 4, 2020. They were welcomed to the college by Pamela Dunn, Director of Admissions. Mrs. Dunn gave a brief description of the tour before starting.\n\nThe students were able to visit several departments (programs) in the college: Computer, Cosmetology, Healthcare, Industrial, Mechanical, and Welding. A spokesperson was available to explain their program in each area. They were also able to visit the Test Center where someone spoke with them about all the tests the college is able to administer. The Disabilities Coordinator gave the students details on how they must access the Disabilities Office on their own when they start college. She also explained the difference in high school accommodations and college accommodations.\n\nThe Oconee Fall Line Technical College tour was exciting, detailed, and informative. The instructors were very welcoming and willing to answer every question. It is a great campus.\n\nStudents from SE Bulloch Academy had the opportunity to visit both Great Dane and Briggs & Stratton in the Statesboro area.\n\nAt Great Dane, the students were given a presentation on the history of the company. They observed the company’s ability to lead the industry and the benefits of being employed at Great Dane. The students were able to view some of the staff and machinery in action. They explained how each part of the Great Dane trailer was assembled. The students received information on the different employment opportunities in the facility.\n\nSE Bulloch Academy students also toured Briggs & Stratton. Briggs & Stratton is a company that builds engines for both residential and commercial needs. The tour began with a presentation of the history of the company, the various positions and pay, and information about different engines. This served as a strong foundation of knowledge for the students before heading to the floor for a tour. The students were taken through many different parts of the facility, including a portion that ran 24 hours a day. Students were able to see many of the workers performing their duties. Members within the HR department also spoke with the students. They allowed the students to ask questions and took time to ask the students about their futures.\n\nStudents from Worth County toured WALB on February 19, 2020. Mr. Chris Zelman, who is the head meteorologist for WALB, conducted the tour. The tour started in the newsroom where we were able to see the staging for the daily news. The students were allowed to stand in front of the green screen and point at the weather screen. Mr. Zelman pointed out that the news reporters must wear the proper colors to ensure that they are visible while standing in front of the screen. The students also took a turn at the cameras and learned that operating the cameras is learned through on the job training. The news reporters use a script and read it off a teleprompter. The students also had an opportunity to sit in the chairs where the newscasters sit and try to read the news from the teleprompter. They learned quickly that is not as easy as it looks on the nightly news! Mr. Zelman informed us that most anchors start out as producers and go on to become news anchors. He also told us that the weather reports are done without a teleprompter but is done from a weather map.\n\nDifferent opportunities for employment at the station was discussed. There are five engineers who work in the television stations and they do require an engineering degree. They ensure that all the equipment runs smoothly for the entire station. Although engineers do make a high salary, Mr. Zelman informed us that a person with the knack for sales can be the highest money earner in the station. The sales department, of course, is one of the most important departments at the station. They sell the advertising time slots which is how the station earns its money. They have a team of ten salespeople who sell time slots to businesses in the immediate area and in surrounding communities that the station serves. He stated that the biggest advertisers are car dealerships.\n\n​\n\nThe students enjoyed the tour and were excited to learn that the station does summer internships and apprenticeships. Mr. Zelman told the students they could apply online for these positions.\n\nMarion County HSHT students from Buena Vista, Georgia, had the opportunity to visit the United States Army Infantry School in Fort Benning, Georgia. Students were able to observe the Rangers in Action demonstration hosted by the 4th Ranger Training Battalion while on the base.\n\nThe Ranger Course is the premier leadership course in the U.S. Army and provides the most challenging, realistic training that a soldier can receive. A U.S. Army Ranger is a member of an elite force that conducts special military missions on short notice. The Ranger Regiment is the largest special operations combat group in the Army. Members of this regiment have combat and airborne training, and they also hold varied occupations in the Army.\n\nHSHT students were met by two school liaisons officers that shared information about the army base and the Rangers. Students were able to ask questions and see tactical maneuvers and equipment that the Rangers utilize. Following the educational demonstration students were able to dine in the DFAC with soldiers and recruits.\n\nTwenty-two students from Murray County High Schools participated in a tour of Dixie Group in Chatsworth, Georgia. Dixie Group is a large carpet manufacturer. Initially the students gathered in the conference room where a Dixie Group employee talked with students about the jobs available there and the qualifications needed for the different jobs. Some of the jobs are HR staff, truck drivers, computer technicians and factory workers. Students were taken on a tour of the facility and learned about “tufting” which is a part of the carpet making process. They were able to observe different employees setting up machines and saw employees doing quality checks and dying fabrics. After the tour, students were given the opportunity to ask questions and some of the students acquired employment applications with the intention of applying for jobs. Students were impressed by the number of different types of jobs at Dixie Group and the opportunities that may be available to them for employment at this facility.\n\nJenkins County HSHT students were privileged with a tour of Milliken Industries in Sylvania, Georgia, on January 15, 2020. They were met and welcomed to the plant by the employment manager, Chelsea Roberts.\n\nMrs. Roberts gave an awesome presentation on the history of Milliken Industries as a company in the area and worldwide. She spoke on management and the different divisions within the company. Mrs. Roberts then addressed the skills needed to be a successful employee at Milliken. She spoke on the importance of following rules, having good work ethics, and attendance. Jamie Calloway, Human Resources Manager, gave the students a short explanation of the apprenticeship program the company has and the process for getting into the program. Mrs. Roberts then took the students on a tour of the facility. It was an impressive tour; very thorough and educational.\n\n​On Wednesday December 4, 2019 Fourteen High School High Tech Students from Madison County High School toured the Caterpillar Facility in Athens, Ga.\n\nAt Caterpillar, Joni Robinson (Supervisor – Athens Customer Center) provided the tour for the students. The Caterpillar facility in Athens opened in 2013 and currently has approximately 1500 employees. Caterpillar has facilities throughout the world and the company is continuing to expand.\n\nMs. Robinson talked with the students about the importance of graduating from high school. She stated that their entry level positions required a High School Diploma or GED. She discussed in detail the importance of safety and teamwork at Caterpillar to the students and gave numerous examples throughout the tour. She explained the three things they look for in potential employees – positive attitude, work ethic, and teamwork. She said if you have these characteristics they can teach you the specific job requirements. During the tour the students saw the production of Caterpillar’s Skid Steer and Bulldozers. They were able to see a straight flow (assembly) line and auto-guided vehicles. The students saw numerous employment opportunities that are available at Caterpillar. Some were assembly, welding, fabrication, painting, lift truck operators, quality control, logistics-shipping, machining, warehousing, and management.\n\nThe students were very engaged and impressed with the production and assembly of the Caterpillar equipment, the overall business operation, and the Caterpillar facility.\n\nThe Augusta Area High School High Tech (HSHT) Program held its annual College & Career Resource Fair on November 4, 2019 at the First Baptist Church located at 3500 Walton Way Extension, Augusta, Georgia. The event was attended by 228 students and numerous school staff from 22 area high schools located in the following counties: Richmond, Columbia, Burke, Jefferson, Warren, McDuffie and Lincoln. Also participating were 32 vendors along with Vocational Rehabilitation and HSHT staff.\n\nSeveral guest speakers presented information to the group. Tammy Shepherd, president of the Columbia County Chamber of Commerce, talked about area employment and employers as well as discussing types employment opportunities with industries / companies that are big and expanding in the Augusta area. Todd Gay, Outreach and Engagement Director, at the Georgia Cyber Innovation and Training Center, talked about the Center’s role in Cyber Security and other initiatives.\n\n​\n\nAfter these presentations, the students visited individually with vendors who were present to give them information about future training and employment options available to them following high school graduation. Many colleges, technical schools, private schools, employers and community partners participated in the Fair and provided resources to the students.\n\nStudents from seven high schools in Muscogee County HSHT program participated in an educational campus tour to Columbus Technical College. Students were greeted by the Columbus Technical College staff and they shared information about the admissions process. The financial aid advisor gave an overview of FAFSA and financial aid options for students such as Hope, Pell Career grant and explanations of the cost per credit hour. The Disabilities Coordinator gave an overview of the disability services provided by Columbus Technical College and instructions on how to access the different accommodations that can be provided to the students.\n\nMuscogee HSHT students were divided into smaller groups and toured the different programs that are offered at Columbus Technical College. Students were able to have hands on experience with the welding program and ask questions of the instructors as they toured the different programs.\n\nWorth County High School HSHT students toured the Southern Regional Technical College. Students were greeted by Mrs. Dana Lewis, Assistant High School Coordinator-Recruiter. She spoke with the students first and told them about the admission process and the benefits of dual enrollment. Ms. Lewis also spoke to them about the benefit of a technical education. She pointed out that after just 2 years they would be qualified for a job in many fields and if they wanted to get an undergraduate degree, many of the 2-year programs earn an associate degree which would transfer to a four-year school. Ms. Lewis also stated that there are programs that they could finish in 6 months and earn a certificate which would allow them to enter the work force in a short length of time.\n\nThe tour began in the upstairs portion of building A. On the 2nd floor were computer labs available to students as well as a student success center where students could receive additional help in their course work. There were also instructor’s offices located on this floor. We then went to the 3rd floor where we saw the Health Sciences program facilities. Students can earn CNA certification, LPN certification or an RN diploma. The classroom is set up like a hospital ward complete with beds and patients. Students were able to observe a robotic mannequin that could be set to exhibit different symptoms for the nursing students to diagnose and treat. Students also saw the Computer Information Systems classrooms but were unable to go inside as the classes were in session. The last stop was the cosmetology program which was not in session but students were able to observe the classrooms and labs where the students actually have clients who come in and receive a variety of hair / cosmetic services just as they would receive in a salon.\n\nStudents from Bulloch County (Bulloch Co HS and Portal HS) HSHT program attended tours at the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office and Bulloch County Corrections Facility. At the Sheriff’s Office students learned about all the positions within the Sheriff’s Dept. Officers met the students in the court and spoke to them about their experiences from first joining the force as junior officers and how they each branched off into their chosen specialty areas. The officers shared entry level qualification, salaries, and potential for growth. The canine unit shared how they work and depend on their animals to assist them in apprehending suspects. The tour ended with an overview of the administrative and maintenance offices, with explanation of qualifications for several of the positions.\n\nFollowing the Sheriff’s Office tours, students were led to the Corrections Facility. We were greeted by the Warden and several other senior staff members. Each shared their career paths, why they joined corrections, and qualifications needed as they continued to advance up the ranks in corrections. The Warden also shared what he’s looking for in new staff members. A current inmate encouraged the students to stay in school, and to make smart decisions about their futures so that they don’t find themselves in similar situations.\n\n​\n\nDuring both tours the students asked engaging questions that would help them determine if this would be the right career path for them to take.\n\nDisability Employment Awareness Month heightens awareness while recognizing the contributions of Americans with disabilities to both our workforce and our society. Georgia RAMP sites experienced two days of learning and fun while helping our mentees gain confidence for thriving and advocating for themselves and others who are differently-abled. Mentees discussed the five senses and how the loss of one or more impacts daily living tasks. To give the mentees a glimpse of what it would be like to live without vision, they were paired with a less familiar partner, then given instructions to choose to be the leader or learner. Learners were blindfolded and told they were at the mercy of their leader. Leaders then instructed the learners to leave the comfort of the classroom to navigate stairs, brick columns, doorways, courtyard boulders and return to the classroom without accident or injury. The experiences helped students appreciate the challenges of different disabilities, realize that they are not alone, and that it’s ok to ask for help: there are people who will help. Most of all, they learned that they are more important than their abilities. Mentees vowed to focus on people first, not their abilities or disabilities.\n\nGeorgia RAMP Mentees strive to Learn, Connect, Work, and Lead missions for themselves and others regardless of abilities!"
