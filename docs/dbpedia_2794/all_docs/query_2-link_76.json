        "text": "I am currently in high school and enrolled in Southeastern's Dual enrollment program. I have been doing a class each semester and so far I have had great experiences. The professors are excellent and have fast reply’s if there are any questions about the course. I go to the college at the end of the semester to take my exam. I’m still trying to find all the rooms and whenever I cannot find the room there are people there who are glad to help me. They are a great college.\n\nSoutheastern Tech is a small community college devoted to helping others achieve their educational and career dreams without having to attend a big university. The staff is very knowledgeable and the professor are always willing to help in any way possible. By it being a small community college students get are able to get the one on one they may need in difficult subjects."
