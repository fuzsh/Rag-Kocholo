The College offers associate degrees, diplomas, technical certificates of credit, and non-credit certificates in a student-centered learning environment through traditional and distance education modes of delivery.\n\nTCSG Guarantee/Warranty\n\nCurriculum standards have been developed with direct involvement of business and industry. These standards serve as the industry-validated specifications for each occupational program. The TCSG guarantee to every one of our students is this:\n\nIf one of our graduates educated under a standard program and his/her employer finds that the graduate is deficient in one or more competencies as defined in the standards, the technical college will retrain the employee at no instructional cost to the employee or the employer.\n\nThis guarantee is in effect for a period of two years after graduation. To inquire or file a claim under this warranty, instructors or employers may contact the Vice President for Academic Affairs at 478-553-2097."
