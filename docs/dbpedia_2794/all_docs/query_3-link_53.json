        "text": "Postsecondary education and training are key to long-term financial security, as more Georgia employers want to hire workers with college credentials. While higher education is growing more essential for jobs of the future, the price students and families pay is rising. That makes a college investment more burdensome and riskier than in the past.\n\nRising tuition and fees are linked to several factors, but the decline in public funding for higher education plays a major role. State funding helps keep tuition and fees lower at public colleges and universities. State funding for scholarship and grant programs further reduces the cost of attendance. So, when state lawmakers cut scholarship amounts in recent years, Georgia’s students and families got stuck with a bigger bill.\n\nThe consequences of decreased state funding, weakened scholarships and skyrocketing costs for students and families played out in Georgia over the past decade. State lawmakers cut higher education budgets during the recession that started in 2007, prompting institutions to raise tuition and fees to offset the difference.\n\nPer-student state funding fell 36 percent from 2008 to 2012 in the university system and 45 percent from 2008 to 2011 in technical colleges. A 40 percent tuition increase across both systems occurred at the same time. When the Legislature cut the HOPE program in 2011, the net price for students spiked by 19 percent.[1] All these factors combined with the recession’s drag on family finances pushed students to turn to loans. Half of Georgia’s university undergraduates carried student loans in 2016, up from about one third in 2007.\n\nHigher prices create added challenges for students trying to graduate. Funding cuts reduce the capacity of schools to build support systems for students. Georgia is enrolling more students with financial need. Rising costs hurt low-income students the most, even as they probably stand to gain the most from postsecondary education. Many students begin college with high hopes but do not complete a degree program. Low-income students face higher barriers to graduation than their peers, which is a worrisome trend since this group is nearly half of Georgia’s college students\n\nThe following recommendations are aimed to help guide state lawmakers in coming months as they work to strengthen Georgia’s colleges and universities and offer students and families a more affordable path to a degree:\n\nWork to return higher educating funding back to historical levels\n\nDesignate a portion of the state treasury’s Revenue Shortfall Reserve as a pool to protect students against large tuition increases during widespread state budget cuts\n\nDevelop a state aid program targeted to increased levels of family financial need\n\nState Funding for Higher Education Is in Long-Term Decline\n\nState funding was long the largest source of money for Georgia’s public colleges and universities. But state funding has been in a long slide.[2] The state once paid 75 percent of public higher education costs, but that now sits at 50 percent.[3] When the current higher education funding formula was developed in 1982 by the Study Committee on Public Higher Education Finance, tuition and fees totaled 19 percent of overall revenues. The committee recommended tuition and fees increase to reach 25 percent.[4]\n\nEconomic recessions create acute challenges for higher education institutions. State budget cuts lead to a financial squeeze just as enrollment increases due to students pursuing education and training in response to a weakened job market.\n\nRecession Led to Big Higher Education Funding Cuts\n\nDuring Georgia’s recession-era budget cuts, schools used a variety of strategies to pare spending. Colleges and universities froze faculty and staff hiring, used more part-time faculty, cut travel budgets, delayed the replacement of aging supplies and technology, reduced library hours and other student support services, instituted furlough days and shifted more health insurance costs to employees. To make up some of the revenue shortfall, colleges raised tuition and fees and instituted a new Special Institutional Fee, which remains in place.\n\nState budget cuts and subsequent tuition and fee increases led to increased spending for HOPE scholarships and grants.[6] The Legislature responded to rising spending with a cut to the award amounts for most HOPE scholarships and grants beginning in 2011.\n\nSpike in HOPE Spending Followed Cuts to University and Technical College System Budgets\n\nCuts to State Budget, HOPE Push More Costs to Students and Parents\n\nAs colleges and universities relied more on tuition and fee revenue the past decade, average tuition and fees rose at all institutions. The largest increases coincided with the biggest drops in per-student state funding.[7] Per-student state funding fell 36 percent from 2008 to 2012 in the university system and 45 percent from 2008 to 2011 in technical colleges. At the same time, tuition increased 40 percent across both systems.\n\nColleges Raised Tuition, Fees in Response to Budget Cuts\n\nTuition and fees are a sizable cost for many students. Still, they are often less than half the full cost of attendance, which includes books, housing and food. To lower the full cost, students pursue grants and scholarships. The net price accounts for this financial aid.\n\nTuition and fees rose during budget cuts, while the average net price did not. This is perhaps due to more students receiving financial aid such as the need-based Pell Grant, and the HOPE scholarships and grants, which still covered full tuition and fees during the largest budget cuts.\n\nAfter cuts to the HOPE programs in 2011, average net price across the university system increased by 19 percent.[8] In the technical college system, where tuition and fees make up a much smaller share of the total cost of attendance, average net price did not increase. However, student enrollment in technical colleges dropped. Pell enrollment decreased by 9 percent, while non-Pell enrollment dropped by 33 percent.[9]\n\nAverage Net Price in University System Increased By 19 Percent After 2011 Cuts to HOPE\n\nThe share of students who use loans to finance their education surged during the recession, a period when tuition increased and lawmakers made cuts to the HOPE program. In 2007, 36 percent of undergraduate students in the university system carried student loans. By 2016, 50 percent did. Average single-year loan amounts also increased, to an inflation-adjusted $7,774 in 2016 from $6,362 in 2007.[10]\n\nStudents Relying More on Loans to Pay for College\n\nLow-Income Students Hurt Most By Tuition Increases\n\nThe median family income of a university system undergraduate who applied for financial aid is $40,484.[11] A quarter of families statewide have income less than $30,000. College is much less affordable for these lower-income students, according to analysis by the Southern Regional Education Board. The net price of a public, four-year college for these students, after accounting for financial aid, is more than half of family income. Even at lower-cost state and technical colleges, average net price is more than a third of these students’ incomes.[12]\n\nNet Price of Four-Year College Is More than Half the Earnings of Low-Income Students\n\nNet price as percentage of income for students with annual income under $30,000\n\nThe price of college has increased for students at all income levels. Students with the lowest-incomes in the university system endured the largest increases. Average net price for students with income less than $30,000 increased by $2,249, or 32 percent, between 2009-10 and 2014-15.[13]\n\nAverage Net Price for University System Students Grew Most for Low-Income Students\n\nAnnual Income University System Average Net Price 2009-10 University System Average Net Price 2014-15 % Change in Average Net Price <$30,000 $7,077 $9,326 32% $30,001-48,000 $8,141 $10,214 25% $48,001-75,000 $11,428 $12,722 11% $75,001-110,000 $13,248 $14,249 8% >$110,000 $13,381 $14,514 8%\n\nLow-income students less likely to receive HOPE\n\nState lawmakers made changes in 2011 that made it harder for students to get a full-tuition scholarship, requiring them to earn a higher GPA and reach certain benchmarks on the SAT or ACT exams. Students who do not qualify under the new terms but would have qualified for HOPE prior to 2011 receive a partial-tuition scholarship.\n\nBy splitting the HOPE program in this way, lower-income students are much less likely to receive full-tuition benefits. Only 21 percent of students receiving a full HOPE scholarship were also low-income and receiving the Pell Grant, according to an analysis of fall 2013 HOPE recipients.[14]\n\nHOPE Reduces Net Price Most at Costliest Colleges, Leaves Many with High Costs and Loans\n\nThe four public research universities (University of Georgia, Georgia State, Georgia Tech and Augusta University) charge the highest tuition and fees, but students attending these schools do not pay the highest average price. That’s because these students are far more likely to receive state aid through HOPE scholarships. Twenty-one percent of students in research universities receive full-tuition benefits through the Zell Miller Scholarship, and another 39 percent receive partial-tuition benefits through the HOPE scholarship. (See Appendix A for data by college in university system.)\n\nFew Students outside of Research Universities Receive Full-Tuition Benefits\n\nUniversity System Sector % Students\n\nReceiving HOPE Scholarship/Grant % Students Receiving Zell Miller Scholarship/Grant Total % of Students Receiving HOPE/Zell Miller Grant Research Universities 39% 21% 60% Comprehensive Universities 37% 8% 45% State Universities 30% 3% 33% State College 18% <1% 18% Technical Colleges 43% 13% 56%\n\nIn addition to eliminating tuition costs to students, the program relied on a comprehensive package of student supports and strategies. Those included a full-time enrollment requirement, free public transportation, textbook access and additional advising, tutoring and career services.[16] Though the ASAP initiative required additional investment, the total cost per degree dropped.\n\nStudents in the four comprehensive universities (Georgia Southern, Kennesaw State, University of West Georgia and Valdosta State) pay the highest average price. In 2014-15, the average net price in these schools was more than $15,000.[17]\n\nStudents in Comprehensive Universities Pay Highest Average Net Price\n\nStudents attending comprehensive universities are also the most likely to carry loans.[18] Though research universities have the lowest share of undergraduate students with loans, they borrow the highest average amounts within an academic year.[19] The average loan amount taken out in one academic year represents nearly 20 percent of the family income of a typical undergraduate student.[20] (See Appendix B for loan amounts by college.)\n\nMost Students at Comprehensive Universities Rely on Loans, Students in Research Universities Have Largest Loans\n\nUniversity System Sector Percentage of students with loans, 2015-16 Average student loan amount borrowed during academic year, 2015-16 Median family income of students applying for financial aid, 2015-16 Average loan amount as percentage of median family income Research Universities 42% $8,533 $45,981 19% Comprehensive Universities 59% $8,048 $48,497 17% State Universities 55% $8,012 $37,007 22% State College 45% $5,604 $30,561 18% TOTAL 50% $7,774 $40,484 19%\n\nRecommendations\n\nEnsuring higher education opportunity in Georgia is important because college is one of the best ways for people to move up the economic ladder. It acts as the critical link between Georgians and job opportunities. And colleges and universities are incubators for the state’s future workers, entrepreneurs and leaders.\n\nHigher education budgets are vulnerable to economic downturns. During these times, families are asked to pay more, even as they struggle to make ends meet. Rising prices hurt the lowest-income students the most. And budget cuts to colleges and universities undercut a school’s ability to help the neediest students graduate.\n\nThe following principles and recommendations can guide investments to strengthen Georgia’s public higher education system.\n\nWork to return higher education funding back to historical levels.\n\nOver the past 30 years, Georgia drastically reduced its funding of public higher education. While state lawmakers once paid 75 percent of higher education costs, the state contribution is down to about 50 percent. That means colleges now must come up with about half the cost of educating students. The schools find the money by charging tuition and fees. Smaller state responsibility for higher education means higher prices for students.\n\nThe state restored some higher education funding since the recession. However, Georgia’s 2018 budget is short an inflation-adjusted $623 million for the university system if it were funded at the same per-student level as in 2008. If funded at the historically highest per-student levels of 2001, the budget would require an added $2.2 billion.\n\nDesignate a portion of the Revenue Shortfall Reserve to protect students against large tuition increases during state budget cuts.\n\nHigher education programs are vulnerable during economic recessions. The downturns typically lead to large state budget cuts and enrollment growth. The state sets aside a rainy day fund to help maintain services and funding levels during downturns. The reserves did not protect higher education from large budget and HOPE cuts during the recession that started in 2007. To make matters worse, colleges raised tuition to make up for budget cuts while Georgia families were struggling the most with lost wages and unemployment.\n\nTo better prepare for the next economic downturn, the Legislature voted in 2010 to raise the cap on the state’s rainy day fund from 10 to 15 percent of the budget. To build on this positive step and further protect students against tuition hikes, the state can designate a small portion of reserves to avoid tuition increases during years of falling state revenues.\n\nMaryland created the Tuition Stabilization Trust Account to keep tuition stable in years of decreasing revenues, with the goal of tying tuition and fee increases to changes in the state’s median family income. Legislation specifies money should be spent only to supplement general fund appropriations for the purpose of stabilizing tuition costs.\n\nThe Legislature can already appropriate reserve money for increased K-12 needs. K-12 formula funding is based on past enrollment numbers, and public schools can’t raise tuition revenue. Higher education budget requests are also based on past enrollment numbers. Colleges and universities rely on the flexibility of raising tuition to make up for any gaps. Using reserves to supplement funding would help keep students’ tuition bills from serving as the go-to source to balance budgets during hard economic times.\n\nDevelop a state aid program that responds to increased family financial need.\n\nEven after accounting for federal financial aid, the price of college is more than half of average annual income for students who come from families earning less than $30,000, or a quarter of Georgia families. The cost is more than a third of an average student’s income at two-year and technical colleges.\n\nGeorgia is one of only two states in the country that does not offer state aid programs weighted to financial need. Though HOPE helps most students in higher-priced research universities, it supports a far smaller share at other colleges. Middle and high-income students are much more likely to qualify for full tuition aid through HOPE than lower-income students.\n\nOne simple approach to providing low-income students with financial aid is a need-based grant program. Other states and individual colleges also provide aid in the form of forgivable loans or work-study opportunities for low-income students. Funding for these initiatives can come through state appropriations, tuition and fee revenue, lottery proceeds, or matching funds between institutions, employers and the state.\n\nAppendix A.
