        "text": "Installers, pumpers and DPH personnel, please remember that you MUST have your Continuing Education Units (CEUs) , or you will literally be put out of business. This has already happened to some installers! GOWA is making a special effort to help our members and non-members receive their CEUs by the time to re-new your certification.\n\nIf your company provides portable sanitation services and does not also install or pump septic tanks, only one contractor from your company needs to complete CEUs in order for the company and everyone under the company to renew. If you have any questions, please contact the State Environmental Health Office at 404-657-6534.\n\nRegistration will be at 7:30 AM and the class will be from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Lunch will be provided.\n\nThis seminar will be educational, beneficial and enjoyable. There will be a wide range of topics discussed and the information will be meaningful to those who choose to attend. Instructors will be industry members who are recognized experts in their field.\n\nYou have a choice of where you get your CEU credits. Why not get them from GOWA? By doing this you are supporting\n\nYOUR industry and YOUR association, the one that is fighting everyday for YOUR best interests!\n\nThe cost for these seminars is $125.00 for GOWA members and $135.00 for non-members. If dues are sent in with your registration fee, you may register at member rates.\n\nRegister TODAY!\n\nThis class will be held at Oconee Fall Line Technical College, in the Dubose Porter Conference Center, Room 622. The address is 560 Pinehill Road, Dublin, GA 31021."
