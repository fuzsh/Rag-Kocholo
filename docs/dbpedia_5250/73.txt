Scooby-Doo: Pirates Ahoy! is the tenth feature in a series of made-for-DVD movies starring the cast of Scooby-Doo. It was released September 19, 2006.

The feature starts as a boat is engulfed by the galleon of Skunkbeard the Pirate. The gang is on their way to meet Fred's parents for a mystery-themed cruise for his birthday. Little mysteries are planted throughout the ship, only the gang keeps spoiling it by unmasking the "culprits." The cartographer of the captured ship, Garcia, has escaped in a liferaft and is rescued by the cruise ship. Garcia tells of Skunkbeard and his crew which the gang passes off until Fred's parents disappear.
