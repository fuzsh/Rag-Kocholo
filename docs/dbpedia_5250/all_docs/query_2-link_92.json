        "text": "Grey DeLisle may not be a household name for many, but she has had a prolific career in animation. Anyone who is a fan of the many recent productions in the Scooby-Doo franchise will undoubtedly recognize her, as she has provided the voice of Daphne Blake since the early 2000s. She hits just the right notes as Daphne, combining the character’s signature intelligence and love of fashion. After the death of Russi Taylor, she also began to voice various characters in The Simpsons, most notably Martin and Sherri and Terri.\n\nPeter Cullen has arguably one of the most recognizable voices in animation, largely thanks to his voicing of Optimus Prime in various iterations of the Transformers franchise, notably the 1980s TV series. However, he has also appeared in several notable productions, and ‘80s and early ‘90s kids will also recognize his deep, gravelly voice as that of the gloomy donkey Eeyore in The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and its many movie spinoffs. As all of that wasn't enough, he also provided the voice of Monterey Jack in Rescue Rangers (the other was Disney veteran Jim Cummings).\n\nThe late Kevin Conroy has become virtually synonymous with the character of Batman, thanks to his virtuoso voice performance in the series Batman: The Animated Series. Particularly notable is his skill at using a different voice for Batman and Bruce Wayne, heightening the distinction between the two characters. He had an undeniable vocal chemistry with Mark Hamill, who portrayed Batman’s nemesis, the Joker. Also notable is the fact that Kevin Conroy was openly gay, one of the few LGBTQ+ people to have become a major animated star, and the discrimination he faced is a reminder of how many barriers remain for queer people in Hollywood.\n\nSince moving into voice acting in the 1980s, Kath Soucie has become a remarkably prolific voice actress in animation. Among other things, she is particularly well-known for providing the voice of Lola Bunny in the various entries in the Looney Tunes franchise. However, she hasn’t limited herself, and she has been in everything from Disney cartoons (in both Darkwing Duck and Winnie the Pooh) to Dexter’s Laboratory (where she plays the title character’s mom) and Rugrats (in which she plays Phil, Lil, and their mother).\n\nWith his deep voice, Patrick Warburton has one of the most recognizable and resonant voices in contemporary animation. He has appeared in a wide variety of animated productions, though one of his longest-running roles is as Joe Swanson on Family Guy, a role which he originated. Disney fans, however, know him best as the dim-witted henchman Kronk in The Emperor’s New Groove (and in its sequel, Kronk’s New Groove). He’s also no stranger to live-action, having made appearances in shows like Seinfeld, where he plays Elaine’s dimwitted but handsome boyfriend, David Puddy.\n\nThe late Don Messick was a true fixture in animation, thanks to his many roles for the prolific Hanna-Barbera. Of all of his roles for the studio, arguably his best-known is Scooby-Doo, starting in the series Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? He would go on to play the character in a wide-ranging number of films and TV series, becoming virtually synonymous with him. However, he would also appear as a number of other beloved characters in the Hanna-Barbera corpus, including Astro in The Jetsons, Muttley in Wacky Races, and Hamton J. Pig in Tiny Toon Adventures.\n\nAnyone who has watched The Animaniacs or its spinoff Pinky and the Brain is familiar with the voice of the talented Maurice LeMarche, who has long inhabited the character of the sinister and maniacal Brain. Though this is arguably his most recognizable and popular role, he has appeared in several other high-profile series, most notably Inspector Gadget in the series of the same name. Of particular note is that he does an astonishingly accurate Orson Welles impression, which makes him the perfect fit for the Brain, who staunchly believes in his intellectual superiority.\n\nLisa Simpson is, in many ways, the conscience of The Simpsons, for in addition to being academically gifted, she is also driven by her strong moral code. By this point, it’s impossible to imagine Lisa voiced by anyone other than Yeardley Smith, particularly since she has been with the show since it was a piece of The Tracey Ullman Show. Yeardley is also remarkably versatile, and she has appeared in a number of live-action roles as well, including in such series as Mama’s Family, Dead Like Me, and Dharma and Greg.\n\nAlong with the other cast members of The Simpsons, Dan Castellaneta has become one of the best-known and most easily recognized voices in contemporary animation. It’s hard to imagine the long-running series without him as the voice of Homer Simpson. Castellaneta also provides the voice for some of the series’ other most-loved characters, including Abe Simpson and Krusty the Clown. He has also appeared in other Matt Groening productions (most notably Futurama ) and for Disney. In the latter, he is most recognizable as the voice of Genie, having taken over the role from Robin Williams in The Return of Jafar (and in the subsequent Aladdin TV series).\n\nWith her signature hoarse and gravelly voice, Julie Kavner has entertained audiences as Marge, the matriarch of the Simpson household. What is particularly remarkable about Kavner’s vocal delivery is her ability to convey warmth and gentle authority as Marge, a woman who has certainly had to put up with her fair share of nonsense from both her husband and her children. In addition to The Simpsons — on which she also provides the voice of Marge’s sisters — she has appeared in a number of other animated productions, including the midquel The Lion King 1 1/2. Some might also recognize her as Brenda Morgenstern in the series Rhoda.\n\nIt’s impossible to imagine The Simpsons without the character of Bart Simpson, and much of the character’s charm and personality can be attributed to the voice acting talent of Nancy Cartwright, who has voiced Bart since the show's beginning. She captures just the right mix of irascibility and vulnerability. Though Bart is her most notable role, she has played other Simpsons characters (including Ralph Wiggum and Todd Flanders), and she is also recognizable as the voice of such characters as Pistol in Goof Troop, Margo Sherman in The Critic, and Finster in The Rugrats.\n\nSeth MacFarlane is arguably one of the most prolific and successful voice actors currently working in Hollywood. He has provided the voice for a number of the most recognizable characters in the animated landscape, including Peter Griffin, Stewie, and Brian (all in Family Guy) and Stan and Roger Smith (both in American Dad!). He has a rich and textured voice, and combined with his undeniable genius in crafting animated comedy, it’s easy to see why he has come to be so highly regarded. As if all of this weren’t enough, he also has one of animation's most mellifluous singing voices.\n\nAnyone who has watched Futurama has heard the voice of the prolific John DiMaggio, widely recognized and praised for providing the voice of the cynical and curmudgeonly robot Bender. However, he has been a prominent fixture in many other animated series, including Adventure Time (in which he plays Jake the Dog), various characters in the Transformers franchise, and Brother Blood on Teen Titans. Before becoming a noted and popular voice actor, he also worked as a comedian. He has also been one of those who have advocated — sometimes quite strenuously — for better compensation for voice actors in animation.\n\nThe late Clarence Nash was one of his generation’s most renowned voice actors, particularly for his ability to create the inimitable voice of Donald Duck. He would voice the character from the 1930s right up to near his death in the 1980s, with Mickey’s Christmas Carol being the last time he would provide the voice in a film. He was remarkably influential, and most other duck characters in animation are modeled after him. Nash would even go so far as to train the man who would take over the role after his death, Tony Anselmo, which helps to explain Donald’s continuing vocal continuity.\n\nCanadian-American Tara Strong has had a remarkably successful and prolific career as a voice actress, providing voices in a wide range of films, TV series, and video games. She has appeared in such series as The New Batman Adventures, Teen Titans Go!, and The Powerpuff Girls, and she has even appeared as the singing voice of Meg Griffin in Family Guy. In addition to her work in various American productions, she has done dubbing for various Japanese productions, and she has provided voices for several video games and appeared in a number of live-action productions.\n\nThe Simpsons is undoubtedly an American institution, so much so that it’s hard to imagine the television landscape without it. From the beginning, Harry Shearer has been known as the voice of some of the series’ best-known and most beloved characters, including Mr. Burns, Smithers, Principal Skinner, and Ned Flanders. The sheer breadth of the characters he’s voiced is a testament to his remarkable abilities. It’s thus no wonder that he has been recognized with a number of prestigious awards, including an Emmy, and he has also been nominated for several Grammy Awards.\n\nVerna Felton may not be a household name, but Disney fans will almost certainly recognize some of her most notable voice work. For much of Disney’s Golden Age, she was one of its most reliable talents, beginning in Dumbo when she provided the voice of the stern (and unkind) Elephant Matriarch. She also voiced such other beloved characters as the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella and Flora in Sleeping Beauty. In addition to numerous live-action roles, she was recognizable for providing the voice of Wilma Flintstone’s mother, Pearl Slaghoople, in The Flintstones. She was also known for her extensive radio work.\n\nThe late Casey Kasem was one of those people with an instantly recognizable voice, and for many years, he was one of the most popular DJs in the US. For animation aficionados, however, he was famous for another reason: Providing the voice of Shaggy Rogers in the various cartoon versions of Scooby-Doo. He stuck with the franchise for much of its existence, though he started appearing in fewer roles beginning in the 2000s. However, his work wasn’t limited to Scooby-Doo, for he was also known for providing his voice to several Sesame Street characters.\n\nMark Hamill became an instant screen legend thanks to his appearance as Luke Skywalker in George Lucas’ Star Wars. Since the release of Return of the Jedi, however, he has become an increasingly prominent presence in various animated projects, and his gruff and gravelly voice is immediately recognizable. Particularly notable is his long association with the character of the Joker in his various animated incarnations, particularly in the highly-regarded Batman: The Animated Series. He also voices Hobgoblin in Spider-Man: The Animated Series, and he has also given his voice to various other parts, including a memorable minor character in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island.\n\nFans of The Simpsons and Futurama will no doubt recognize the voice of Tress MacNeille, who has provided the voice for numerous characters in both series. Of her numerous on-screen creations, she is particularly famous for giving the voice to Mom, the seemingly sweet but actually ruthless mogul in Futurama, and the shrewish Agnes Skinner in The Simpsons. Her voice talents haven’t been limited to the works of Matt Groening, for she has also voiced the beloved Gadget of Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers. Her other notable credits include Daisy Duck (also for Disney) and Queen Oona in Disenchantment.\n\nJim Cummings is someone whose voice is no doubt recognized by many animation fans due to his long-standing work with Walt Disney. He inherited his most famous role, Winnie the Pooh, from Sterling Holloway, and after the retirement of Paul Winchell (the original voice of Tigger), he took over that role as well. Some of his other notable Disney roles include the deranged hyena Ed in The Lion King, Darkwing Duck in the series of the same name, and the cheese-hungry Monterey Jack in Chip n’ Dale: Rescue Rangers. For a time, he was also the voice of Smokey Bear.\n\nThroughout his decades-long career, Frank Welker has provided the voice for some of animation’s most beloved characters. Most notably, he has provided the voice of Scooby-Doo for several of the character’s most recent iterations, largely taking over the role from the late Don Messick. However, he is probably most widely known for his voicing of Fred Jones, also of Scooby-Doo fame. There are few animated ventures in which Welker hasn’t been involved in one way or another, and savvy animation fans will probably recognize him as the voice of the monkey Abu in the Disney film Aladdin and its spin-offs, as well as Nibbler in Futurama.\n\nViewers today might not recognize Paul Winchell, but during the height of his career, he was one of the most prolific voice actors of his generation. If he is known for one role, it would be as Tigger in Disney’s Winnie the Pooh, starting with the features that comprised The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. He also provided the voices for many Hanna-Barbera cartoons, and 1980s kids will recognize him as the voice of the villainous Gargamel in The Smurfs. He made a number of live-action appearances, and he was even well-known as an inventor — a true Renaissance man.\n\nThroughout her long life, June Foray was one of the most prolific voice actresses of her generation, and she is notable for being the one who came up with the idea of the Annie Awards. She provided the voice for many characters over the years, ranging from Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Natasha Fatale (both for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends), Granny (for various Warner Bros. cartoons), and Magica De Spell (in the hit 1980s animated series Ducktales).
