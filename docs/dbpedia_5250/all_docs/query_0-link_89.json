        "text": "Brief Synopsis:\n\nTwo gigantic Monsters are terrorizing Crystal Cove, can the gang stop them before the town is ruined?\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nThe Humungonauts\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nWe open at the new nightclub/hot spot in Crystal Cove, The Tiki Tub.\n\nTrini Lee, the local “talent” is singing a pretty dreadful song, “The Words Got Stuck in My Throat.”\n\nSheriff Stone is congratulating Mayor Dad on his genius idea. Mayor Dad says it’s just another check mark on his list. Mayor Dad congratulates Sheriff Stone on how quiet things have been around town lately.\n\nSuddenly, a gigantic green ape breaks into the Tiki Tub and destroys the place.\n\nMayor Dad and Sheriff Stone survive, fortunately.\n\nThe next morning, Scooby-Doo is searching for Shaggy. Given the state of Shaggy’s room, this might be a challenge. A radio DJ is talking about Max Minner’s insurance company.\n\nScooby-Doo wanders out to the garden and hears Shaggy saying something from behind the bushes. He decides Shaggy is in danger and rushes to his rescue…\n\n…only to discover it’s Shaggy and Velma making out.\n\nShaggy tries to explain that he and Velma were having a staring contest. Velma is not happy with this. Scooby-Doo is even more unhappy and accuses Shaggy of cheating on him. Cause that’s not all kinds of weird.\n\nShaggy says it’s silly, because Scooby-Doo is his dog…and he cares for both of them in different ways. He then tries to tell Scooby-Doo that he is dating Velma. Scooby-Doo reacts badly.\n\nHe is still reacting badly on the way to the Tiki Tub. Fred tries to blame himself, but Velma sets the record straight. Shaggy tries to play Diplomat and fails.\n\nThey arrive at the wrecked Tiki Tub. There’s an awkward moment of silence where no one wants to leave.\n\nAnd then they start investigating.\n\nSheriff Stone arrives on the scene. He tries to ward the gang off.\n\nA local building contractor, Rusty Gnales is pretty pleased with the damage, since it means his business is booming.\n\nThe kids ask the Sheriff if he has any idea what the monster is. He says it’s some new and unidentified monster that he has started calling a ‘humungonaut.’ He says he’s grateful there’s only one…because can you imagine if there were two?\n\nAnd, right on cue, out pops a red one.\n\nBack at KGhoul, Angel Dynamite is playing “The Words Get Stuck In My Throat” because why not? We hear another advertisement for insurance, this time for Jax.\n\nAngel Dynamite walks into the lobby to find the kids moping and wants to know what’s up.\n\nVelma says that the group is down because of emotional drama, and that until they clear the air nothing will happen. Daphne suggests a pow wow, where someone mediates a discussion, like they do when her mother sleeps in the backyard treehouse.\n\nVelma asks Angel to help, however she declines. She states she is only good at two things: spinning records and being a stone-cold fox. Fred says he knows just the person.\n\nThe gang reconvenes at Fred’s house….where the mediator arrives…\n\n…and it’s Sheriff stone. With a smoker.\n\nHe is disappointed that he will not be cooking for a barbecue, and tells Fred that if he wasn’t Mayor Dad’s son, he would make him disappear.\n\nHe does wind up making food, while simultaneously not helping the gang.\n\nVelma looses her cool. She says that all of the issues they are having are because Shaggy won’t man up. She and Scooby-Doo issue an ulitimatum to Shaggy. It’s either her or him.\n\nFred interrupts with an idea. He thinks the team needs an identity, and he wants to use the name of the original Mystery Incorporated…\n\n…he also wants them to wear uniforms. Because of course.\n\nThey arrive at the wreckage from that morning. Gnales Construction is doing great business there as well. Daphne is suspicious.\n\nThat night they arrive at Gnales’ Construction. Signs are all over for Max and Jax Minner. They apparently have separate insurance companies.\n\nThey sneak around the place, looking for clues. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo keep bumping into each other and the tension remains high between them.\n\nSuddenly, the Green Humungonaut appears. He starts smashing stuff up.\n\nIt manages to explode a propane tank, destroying the property completely. Fortunately for Mr. Gnales, he’s present for the destruction. Unfortunately, his place is destroyed.\n\nAs Mystery Inc. is driving back from their adventures, there’s another radio ad for insurance. Suddenly, the signal is jammed and Mr. E interrupts.\n\nHe has another riddle for them. He tells them “To solve the mystery, do as follows: Open your eyes and look for the signs that are all around you. Open your ears and you’ll add to your knowledge. Open your minds and you’ll ensure a speedy solution.”\n\nThe signal un-jams and we hear a different radio ad.\n\nThe next day at City Hall, Fred attempts to talk to Mayor Dad about the situation. Mayor Dad agrees that they are dangerous…\n\n…and what better way to solve the problem than to let them do a Battle Royale at the local arena!\n\nThe plan is for the Humungonauts to come to the arena filled with valuable loot and sell tickets for the destruction. Sort of like a monster truck rally. Mayor Dad is hopeful his “Trap” will work. This, understandably, upsets Fred because his Dad is building a trap without him. The gang storms out.\n\nThat night at the arena, the main trap is set and both Mystery Inc. and the Sheriff and his posse are waiting.\n\nAs Fred scopes the trap situation out, Velma discovers something. Using her laptop, she’s discovered that all the attacks have been focused on specific buildings with no overtly obvious connection to each other.\n\nShaggy says that it sounds as confusing as one of Mr. E’s clues…which kicks Velma into gear.\n\nThe scene shifts to an old, abandoned dock. Velma says she believes this will be the next site of a Humungonaut attack.\n\nThe creatures appear and start battling each other. It’s epic. Lots of destruction.\n\nEventually, they catch them in a net. Velma is surprised that one of the traps actually worked.\n\nMayor Dad is equally surprised.\n\nSheriff Stone promptly welcomes the supposed space travelers…until Velma reveals that they are none other than….\n\nJax and Max Minner. The insurance guys from the radio. They were former carnival wrestlers who went into insurance. They hated each other and wanted to ruin each other’s business. They would have worked if it weren’t for their meddling brothers.\n\nDaphne says that they seem to be doing ok again. Fred reminds them that it’s teamwork that makes a team. Not the other stuff. Velma questions the uniforms, and Fred says they don’t have to wear them but-\n\nThey immediately remove them before he can finish his thought.\n\nThe mystery is solved, but Velma and Scooby-Doo demand an answer to their ultimatum from before. Shaggy, reluctant to choose, screams something about a blue Humungonaut…\n\n…and runs away screaming. Leaving behind an unhappy Velma and Scooby-Doo.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1) The Name. This episode marks the official beginnings of the new Mystery Incorporated, or Mystery Inc.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nBuckets of Bear Bait\n\nPrancing Piccolos\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is one of my favorite episodes for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe first being the song. It’s an awful, awful song and I love every deliciously awful second of it. If I had a way to make that my ringtone, I would do it and not think twice about it.\n\nThe second is the entire opening sequence is almost a direct copy of the original film, albeit shortened.\n\nHere’s the film:\n\nHere’s the show:\n\nAnother thing I like about this episode is how much they focus on the characters.\n\nLike an idiot, I forgot that while Scooby-Doo has sort of forgiven Shaggy, the tension is still there. And this is clearly front and center of this episode.\n\nOne of the creepier aspects of this series is the weird relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. Granted, this will become juxtaposition for the main bad guy (who has yet to be officially introduced) and his human, but as of now…it’s creepy.\n\nThat being said, I think it’s a very interesting storyline to take. Whenever a couple first gets together, the relationship affects others around them, both directly and indirectly, particularly both party’s best friend. In this case, that best friend happens to be a dog.\n\nUnfortunately, unlike most best friends/significant others, they have decided to force Shaggy into an ultimatum, one that is going to get someone, if not all of them, hurt.\n\nIn retrospect, one of the other things I like about this episode is that it’s the last one before the Curse really begins to become the focus. In some ways, this is the The Prisoner of Azkaban of the series. There is the emotional strife between Velma/Shaggy/Scooby-Doo, but overall the characters are happy and blissfully unaware of what is about to happen.\n\nFrom Episode 10 on, the series starts to take an even darker tone. The danger starts heightening, the main villain is introduced, and their lives as they know it, are over.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nThis entire episode is a parody/homage to War of the Gargantuas, a classic Toho monster film. The song “The Words Get Stuck in My Throat” and it’s entire staging are ripped directly from the movie, including Fran Southworth’s vocals.\n\nThe design of the Humungonauts sort of resemble Red and Green Hulk.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nMayor Dad – Gary Cole\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nTrini Lee – Fran Southworth (uncredited)\n\nMax and Jax Minner – Tom Kenney\n\nRusty Gnales – Fred Tatascoire\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nAn evil gnome is terrorizing people dressed as pirates at the local renaissance faire. When Shaggy is kidnapped, can the gang rescue him before it’s too late?\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nThe Gnome\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nWe are at the Crystal Cove Royal Knights Faire. A guy dressed as a pirate approaches his girlfriend who scoffs at his costume.\n\nShe doesn’t understand why someone would dress like a pirate at a fair for knights. He tells her pirates are way cooler.\n\nHe leaves her momentarily to adjust his waist sash…only to be attacked by an evil Gnome.\n\nHis girlfriend finds him all weird and blue and frozen.\n\nLord Barry is welcoming people to the fair, although he is clearly unhappy by people dressed as pirates.\n\nThe Court Jester disagrees with Barry and tells Queen Amanda his feelings. If there are more people, there is more money. She insists on historical accuracy, because without it, who knows what lowlives will arrive…\n\n…like Shaggy and Scooby-Doo dressed and talking like pirates.\n\nVelma asks if she can join Shaggy, and he seems mostly fine…but he does tell her she needs to dress like a wench and speak like a pirate.\n\nAs Velma states that she won’t put on those dumb clothes, Fred and Daphne show up in more accurate costumes.\n\nFred wants to explore the Black Plague Village with it’s traps, and Daphne is more interested in showing off her oddly ugly outfit.\n\nVelma points out that they are taking the guy away on a stretcher.\n\nHis girlfriend is trying to explain to Sheriff Stone and Mayor Dad just what happened.\n\nDaphne asks what happens, and of course, they write it off as a standard spooking and a future business endeavor.\n\nSkipper Shelton is trying to hawk Cotton Candy Clams just like Richard III use to eat. He then asks who is he kidding.\n\nWe return to our storyline with the girlfriend explaining to the gang what happened.\n\nVelma says it sounds odd to her. It’s more of a goblin or sprite power than a gnome power. Fred agrees and says they have to get to the bottom of it. She suggests checking with her mom, who’s running the souvenir shop by the Ice Cream Moat. She invites Peg Leg Shaggy along, who in turn invites Scooby-Doo.\n\nVelma then asks “Is it me, or are pirates just hobos with earrings?”\n\nAt the Ice Cream Moat, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are drinking from the moat…which seems unsanitary, but whatever.\n\nVelma asks her Mom if something is wrong with her. Angie tells her that she’s a great girl, when she isn’t trying to be smarter than everyone else. Velma laments that she cares about him and wants him to care about her, too.\n\nAngie comforts her and tells her it will happen. And if not, she’ll make him a special potion of poison mushrooms and wormwood. Ah, mother/daughter bonding…\n\nShe then hands Velma a book called, I’m Okay, You’re a Scary Gnome. She warns her daughter that if it is a Scary Gnome, to be careful as they hold grudges.\n\nThat night, two guys dressed as pirates leave the fair and are attacked by the gnome and left paralyzed.\n\nThe paramedics come and take the two boys away.\n\nThe Jester states that the attacks could hurt business. The Queen isn’t worried.\n\nFred asks Mayor Dad what he thinks of the situation. His dad agrees that it needs investigating…but to find out what tricks it can do for marketing plans.\n\nMeanwhile, as the boys are being taken to the hospital, Daphne notices a purple jeweled earring in one of their hands.\n\nVelma reveals that while there are all sorts of Gnomes, none seem to particularly have a beef with pirates.\n\nThe Gnome continues his attacks on pirates, forcing the town to turn the local theatre into an emergency station.\n\nFred, Daphne and Velma investigate the paralyzed victims.\n\nWhile Fred is taking a strange device to the paralyzed victims, Daphne asks Velma if everything is ok. Velma confides in Daphne how she feels.\n\nFred returns and asks what’s going on. Daphne explains and Fred tells Velma she should relax. He goes on to state that since they all have a great relationship together, why spoil it by having a separate one?\n\nOh, and he’s found a possible clue.\n\nBack in the Mystery Machine, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are eating snacks, while Velma uncovers what the strange goo was. A jellyfish toxin that causes temporary paralysis. Temporary, but long enough for the fair to be over.\n\nBack at the fair, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy have decided to investigate the food.\n\nThey overhear Lord Barry and the Jester discussing the pirates. Lord Barry hates them and says they never showed up when he was running things. The Jester reminds him that when he was in charge he nearly ran things into the ground. Lord Barry reminds him that he only got in charge because he married Queen Amanda.\n\nAfter Lord Barry enters the castle, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo sneak around and peek in a window and discover that Lord Barry secretly dresses like a pirate.\n\nSuddenly, the Gnome appears and proceeds to chase them!\n\nShaggy tells Scooby-Doo to find the others and save himself, before knocking himself unconscious.\n\nThe Gnome has him captured.\n\nThe gang are sitting at a picnic table. Scooby-Doo won’t eat. Velma is coddling Shaggy’s faux parrot.\n\nSuddenly, Scooby-Doo gets angry at Velma and tries to take the parrot away from her.\n\nThe fight is interrupted by a phone call from Mr. E. Velma demands answers. He tells them to begin their search at the end, and to enjoy the rest of the fair.\n\nScooby-Doo leads them back to the forest where he and Shaggy were separated.\n\nTrue to form, while searching the area, Danger Prone Daphne discovers a hollow tree.\n\nThey discover an overly elaborate series of walkways above the fairgrounds. They realize that this is how the Gnome has been getting around, and decide to set a trap.\n\nThe Gnome catches wise, and before he can be caught, escapes to the trees.\n\nAs Fred, Daphne and Velma chase after the Gnome, Scooby-Doo finds and frees Shaggy.\n\nAfter much chasing and confusion, the Gnome is caught…\n\n…and revealed to be The Jester, Gil Littlefoot. He wanted to frame Queen Amanda so that he could take her fortune for his own. And he would have gotten away with it, if it weren’t for “you meddling gnome hating, pirate loving” kids.\n\nOnce again, Mayor Dad is disappointed that the Gnome isn’t a real Gnome.\n\nFred decides to celebrate by throwing alms at the poor, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo head off for more Cotton Candy Clams, and Daphne and Velma wish each other luck with their respective men.\n\nA strange hooded figure bumps into Velma…\n\n…and drops a box from Mr. E on the ground.\n\nInside the box is a note from Mr. E telling Velma “Don’t give up. It has all happened before.” There is also a photograph of the original Mystery Incorporated with a parrot…who’s picture is circled.\n\nVelma is left wondering what exactly is going on.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1) Professor Pericles. The first appearance of a very very pivotal character.\n\n2) The Letter. Mr. E’s letter to Velma reiterates the fact that this is somehow cyclical.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nPoseys and Pinwheels\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nIn general, this is kind of a throwaway episode.\n\nYes, you get some character development with Angie and Velma, and to a degree with Velma and Shaggy. But honestly, no new ground is covered here.\n\nIf anything, this episode is reminding us off everything that’s happened, and of most characters motives.\n\nOf course, Skipper Shelton’s random appearance is welcome and hilarious.\n\nThe most important aspect of the episode is the very end. The introduction of Pericles (although yet unnamed) is an important one, as he becomes a major player in the rest of the series.\n\nI will say that I have been greatly looking forward to reviewing the next episode, so we now just wait for next week!\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nSeveral of the fair goers are dressed similar to Dirk from the classic Dragon’s Lair game.\n\nTwo of the paramedics looks similar to Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe from the classic 1970s drama Emergency.\n\nAngie Dinkley’s book, I’m Okay, You’re a Scary Gnome is a parody on the self-help book, I’m Okay, You’re Okay.\n\nI’m sure there are some allusions to Leprechaun in this episode, however, having never seen it, I can’t say for certain.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nMayor Dad – Gary Cole\n\nAngie Dinkley – Frances Conroy\n\nMr. E – Lewis Black\n\nSkipper Shelton – John O’Hurley\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nLord Barry – Lloyd Sherr\n\nGil Littlefoot – Jeffrey Tambor\n\nQueen Amanda – Audrey Wasileweski\n\nThe Gnome – Frank Welker\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nA phantom is stalking The Hex Girls. Can the gang solve the mystery?\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nThe Phantom\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nThe gang are at the Terrorpherum Theatre seeing The Hex Girls in Concert.\n\nDaphne marvels at the fact they have front row seats. Fred says it’s thanks to Velma being their biggest fan…\n\n…which cuts to Velma fan-girling and flailing like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nShaggy is videotaping the concert, but Scooby-Doo keeps getting in the shot. When Shaggy asks him to move, Scooby-Doo gets snippy. Shaggy says it’s because he’s still upset that he ditched the Van Ghoul marathon for Prom.\n\nSuddenly, there is a flickering of light and an explosion, revealing onstage a mysterious Phantom.\n\nHe warns The Hex Girls that this will be their last concert. Thorn takes a stand and tells him to buzz off. Angered, The Phantom shoots electric balls into one of the onstage speakers, knocking it over on Thorn and then disappearing in another explosion.\n\nBackstage, Thorn is nursing her head. Their songwriter, Daniel, wants them to just cancel the tour…but neither the Hex Girls or their manager, Gus Boggs, have any interest in doing so.\n\nThe gang are also in agreement. Fred suggests the idea of using a double for Thorn, since she seems to be the primary target for the Phantom. Velma quickly flips her lid and tries to get the part.\n\nFred recommends Daphne, instead.\n\nShe immediately sings a little acapella, and Thorn agrees with the idea.\n\nDaphne is pretty stoked, until she realizes she’s going to be bait.\n\nThat night, Daphne goes on for Thorn. She’s understandably nervous about going on, although wether it’s the Phantom or the Fans, she’s not sure.\n\nDaphne goes onstage and launches into “Earth, Wind, Fire and Air.”\n\nSuddenly, The Phantom appears. They spring the trap, but it backfires, capturing Dusk and Luna by mistake.\n\nThe Phantom disappears with Daphne.\n\nSheriff Stone arrives and is oddly concerned with the price of t-shirts and if they are made from cotton…the kind that comes from cows. I frequently worry about him.\n\nVelma explains what happened to Stone. He seems to sort of understand, but is confused by Fred’s behavior.\n\nFred confesses he is feeling all sorts of emotions that he doesn’t understand.\n\nThorn asks Stone what the next step is. He babbles off some oddly specific town ordinance and states that all he’s going to do is take some merch and call the Mayor.\n\nVelma declares that it is up to them to solve this mystery.\n\nShaggy and Scooby-Doo are investigating in the lobby. Scooby-Doo still won’t speak to Shaggy, and goes so far as to suggest that they might need to find new best friends.\n\nFred is investigating the catwalks above the stage, and discovers that the trap had been sabotaged, and that the mishap wasn’t his fault.\n\nFred is relieved that it wasn’t his fault, however he still feels conflicted. He walks away to rejoin the gang, revealing Daphne…hanging behind him by a rope with a gag in her mouth…but then the rope snaps. Fred realizes that he cares about Daphne as he returns to the gang with is news…only to discover his Dad is there.\n\nMayor Dad wants Fred to lay off on the Phantom as the next day is Phantom Day and it’s good for business. Fred tries to tell everyone about the trap when Daphne reappears.\n\nDaphne is angry, having only heard the first part of Fred’s monologue and won’t allow him to explain.\n\nDaniel, the songwriter, decides that this is proof that the whole affair is too dangerous and that they should cancel the whole thing.\n\nDaphne, still outraged, declares that she will go on tomorrow night and she will rock!\n\nAs Daphne, the Hex Girls, Mayor Dad and Gus Boggs leave, Velma wonders aloud if things can get any weirder…\n\n…they can. Scooby-Doo has picked up Harry, Shaggy’s old ventriloquist dummy and declared it his new best friend. Harry, according to Scooby-Doo, loves food and would never leave him for a girl. Velma sighs and says “He’s your dog” and Fred offers him a simple “Sorry, I have my own problems.”\n\nIn Velma’s bedroom, Daphne tells the Hex Girls to make her a rock star. They do.\n\nVelma asks if they will do the same to her. They do not.\n\nNext, we find Fred walking down a dark street. He reminisces about Daphne and he together.\n\nSuddenly, he shouts out that he has feelings for traps and for Daphne and that he isn’t a guy. He runs to find her.\n\nHe arrives at Velma’s house and bursts into the room demanding to speak to Daphne.\n\nShe tells him that Daphne is no more, and turns around to reveal her new identity, Crush.\n\nFred attempts to explain himsef, badly. He implores Daphne to not go on tomorrow, and she dismisses him. She has the Hex Girls kick him out.\n\nVelma asks her if she’s ok, as she’s never stood up for herself in front of Fred before. Daphne says she really isn’t.\n\nIn the Hex Girls’ tour van, Scooby-Doo and Harry are watching a Vincent Van Ghoul movie. Shaggy is officially pissed off and calls Scooby-Doo out on it…\n\nand then Shaggy proceeds to argue with Harry about the situation.\n\nShaggy gets angry at Harry and starts to wrestle with him (with Scooby-Doo cheering for Harry), before realizing what he’s doing. He throws Harry aside causing it’s head to pop off…\n\n…and roll into The Phantom!!!!\n\nThe Phantom proceeds to do a classic Scooby-Doo Door Chase Sequence.\n\nWhen he fails to catch them, he sets the trailer on fire…forcing Shaggy to throw Harry through the window to save them.\n\nHe and Scooby-Doo barely make it out before the trailer explodes. Scooby-Doo, of course, thanks Harry for saving them.\n\nShaggy notices that part of the Phantom’s costume is in Harry’s mouth…and realizes that he has seen that fabric before…\n\n…in a music video for a One-Hit Wonder named Fantzee Pantz, who had the same manager as the Hex Girls, Gus Boggs.\n\nThey confront Boggs about the video.\n\nHe tells them that Fantzee Pantz went “Down the rabbit hole” after the record label dumped him in favor of the Hex Girls.\n\nShaggy is at a loss on what to do. Scooby-Doo states that Harry will be the answer. Shaggy is about to explode when Fred has an idea…\n\nWe cut to the rehearsal for the concert. Daphne, as Crush, has joined the girls onstage.\n\nDaphne is having trouble adjusting. Thorn tells her it’s ok, that she’s been there before, with a carney named Knuckles. She tells Daphne she got over it by writing a song, and suggests writing one together.\n\nFinally, it’s time for the concert.\n\nDaphne makes her big debut singing her song “Trap of Love.”\n\nVelma asks Fred what he thinks, and it’s clear he’s not happy.\n\nDaphne finishes the song to rapturous applause. The curtain desceneds.\n\nFrom above The Phantom begins his final strike.\n\nHe swings down and grabs at what he thinks is Daphne, but turns out to be Harry. The trap is sprung and The Phantom is caught…\n\n…and revealed to be Daniel, aka Fantzee Pantz. He was bitter about having been ousted by the Hex Girls. And he claims, he would have gotten away with it, if it weren’t for the uncanny boy band knowledge of the meddling brats.\n\nAfter the show, Fred tells Daphne that he liked her song, and that if she wants to be free, he won’t stop her. He also tells her how he really feels. Daphne says she’s staying.\n\nShaggy apologizes to Scooby-Doo about the loss of Harry. Apparently, Harry was stuck to Fantzee Pantz and was taken to jail with him. Scooby-Doo says that the only dummy he needs is Shaggy. The two reconcile.\n\nEveryone seems happy…except for poor Velma. The episode closes with her looking forlorn.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\nNone\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nBug Eyed Biscuits\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nFirst off, The Hex Girls rock. Hard core. I’d go to a live concert if I could.\n\nThis is one of the better episodes that doesn’t involve The Curse. The writing is sharp and the suspense, while never on the same level as “The Creeping Creatures” is fun.\n\nThe episode takes great steps with development in this episode. Primarily between Fred and Daphne, but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo get their due as well.\n\nI’ll touch on Shaggy and Scooby-Doo first, as Daphne and Fred segue better into my next thought. While, thankfully, they don’t drag out the Scooby-Doo jealousy bit, they do at least extend it through the episode. It’s nice because, by and large, Scooby-Doo doesn’t have (or need) much development. He is Shaggy’s best friend. This subplot serves the purpose of reminding us (the viewer) that even the things we consider to be constant, sometimes need the proper respect and attention they deserve.\n\nHad Shaggy just told Scooby-Doo what was happening, he would have saved a lot of hurt. However, because he tried to do the classic “two places at once” bit, he caused more trouble than he should have.\n\nThey give a comical juxtaposition to the bigger subplot of Fred and Daphne.\n\nWe’ve known since Episode 1 that Daphne had a thing for Fred. Over the course of the last episode or two, Fred seems to pick up on this. However, when Daphne is kidnapped and it seems that it was his fault, he really has to deal with these feelings.\n\nHis reaction to it is rather human. He fears that by having these feelings, it somehow makes him less of a guy. This isn’t all together weird, given that in the culture Fred lives in, as well as the culture many of us in America live in, frowns upon guys having or expressing emotions openly.\n\nThis is one of the few times the writers really touch on the ideas of gender constructs in the series. They’ll get into some other interesting areas, including the idea of ends justifying the means later, but this is the main foray into this concept.\n\nYou have a main character in a major series questioning what it means to be a guy. He ultimately decides that his feelings for Daphne are more important to him, and that expressing them to her is more important than what he perceives to be social acceptable. It’s a somewhat subtle motion on their part, but it really can have a far-reaching effect if the series finds a niche in syndication. And, if it doesn’t, at least it sets a precedent that it can be done for future cartoon series.\n\nAnother thing the writers of this episode did was create a character that is, while unspoken, clearly homosexual. Gus Boggs, the manager, openly calls Mayor Dad “handsome” (which is true), mentions his own eye shadow, and flips his wrist and swishes his way through most of the episode.\n\nYes, it’s a borderline offensive stereotype (we get worse in another episode), but it’s a pretty major step. Sure there have been implied gay characters in children’s cartoons, most of the cast of SpongeBob Square Pants, for instance. There have also been characters in cartoons that have been adopted by the GLBT culture as symbols, including Velma herself. But this is the first time we’ve had someone who was clearly gay in a cartoon. Again, kids probably didn’t pick up on it, but it still lays ground work for the future.\n\nThe songs sung by The Hex Girls are mostly recycled from their appearance in Scooby-Doo and The Witch’s Ghost. Personally, I love both of the songs, and may or may not own the soundtrack to the film for those songs. However, the new song “Trap of Love” is kind of sub-par in comparison. Yes, it was plot based but it really wasn’t that great a song and it went on a little too long.\n\nNext episode we return to the overall mystery and a very very important character is finally introduced.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nThe Hex Girls are recurring characters in the Scooby-verse. They made their first appearance in Scooby-Doo and the Witch’s Ghost.\n\nWhile the overall plot line comes from Gaston Leroux’s The Phantom of the Opera, The Phantom’s costume and backstory is more similar to that of Winslow Leach’s in The Phantom of the Paradise.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nMayor Dad – Gary Cole\n\nThorn – Jennifer Hale\n\nLuna – Kimberly Brooks\n\nDusk – Jane Weidlin\n\nVincent Van Ghoul – Maurice LaMarche\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nThe Phantom – Fred Tatasciore\n\nDaniel Prezette/Fantzee Pantz – Quinton Flynn\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nA mysterious ghost girl is kidnapping boys who take her to prom, when she sets her eyes on Fred, will the gang be able to save him?\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nAlice May\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nA black limo drives up to a house in the suburbs.\n\nOut of the house walks Randy, dressed in a classy powder blue tux. His mother and father follow him out taking pictures. His mother waxes nostalgic for her prom. His father reminds her they didn’t go to prom together. Randy rushes out to the car to avoid a really awkward moment.\n\nHe gets in next to a very pretty girl, who confesses this isn’t her first prom. She tells him that her others schools she went with other boys.\n\nShe then rips off her face and asks him to be her boyfriend for forever..and ever…and ever…and ever…\n\nThe scene shifts and we’re at Shaggy’s house, catching the tail end of a Vincent Van Ghoul movie. They’re excited because the following week is the annual Vincent Van Ghoul Movie Marathon.\n\nVelma is less than thrilled about the Marathon, because this year it’s on their one month anniversary and prom.\n\nHowever, she has devised a way to make it work out. They’ll come out as a couple on Prom Night and then watch the martahon together…alone.\n\nThe next day at school, Fred and Daphne are discussing the upcoming prom. Daphne is dropping MAJOR hints that she wants Fred to take her. Fred is oblivious.\n\nThey arrive at Fred’s locker to discover a girl a few lockers down is having trouble getting hers to open. Fred, ever the hero, gets it open.\n\nShe introduces herself as Alice May. Daphne immediately hates her.\n\nThe scene shifts to the auditorium where an assembly is about to begin. Velma reminds Shaggy to call the limo company. Daphne asks where Fred is…just in time for Fred to walk up with Alice May.\n\nWhile Daphne simmers, Sheriff Stone begins his presentation. He wants to inform the kids of The Dangers of Prom. This year it isn’t what you’d expect…or maybe you would since it’s Crystal Cove and clearly on top of a Hellmouth. This year, the Dangers are a Ghost Girl. Who kidnaps boys. In her car.\n\nAfter the assembly Fred offers Alice May a ride home, but she declines as she prefers to walk. He then offers one to Daphne who flips out on him, stating that she’d rather go investigate the missing kids that Mr. E wanted them to investigate rather than being *clueless*.\n\nThat night at the school, Daphne is doing research.\n\nShe discovers maps, articles and old books that have pieces missing…all of it having to do with the missing kids.\n\nSuddenly the power goes out in the library. She notices a figure running trhough the stacks and gives chase.\n\nSaid figure tips a bookcase over, trying to crush Daphne.\n\nDaphne escapes and follows the figure into the girl’s locker room…\n\n…where she discovers Alice May. Alice May claims she is there because they haven’t turned the water on in her new house, and she needed to use the shower.\n\nDaphne excuses herself, but lags behind and spies on Alice May, who randomly enters the school’s basement.\n\nThe next morning at K-Ghoul, Daphne fills the gang in on the night before.\n\nFred thinks she’s overreacting about Alice May, because of course. Daphne suspects that Alice May is The Ghost Girl, which Fred also tries to laugh off stating that he’d notice if she were the Ghost Girl. Both Velma and Scooby-Doo agree that he probably wouldn’t. Daphne confronts Fred about liking Alice May and he immediately finds a reason to disappear. So he isn’t *that* clueless.\n\nAfter he’s left, Angel discovers something worrying. Randy was not the first boy that the Ghost Girl has grabbed, she’s in fact grabbed boys dating back to the turn of the century (Which century is unclear). Angel suggests that she’s building a Man Posse.\n\nThat night the gang, sans Fred, go to visit Alice May. Daphne conveniently got Alice May’s address out of her locker.\n\nBut the address leads them to the Crystal Cove Cemetery. Daphne decides to investigate and that they should split up. She and Scooby-Doo go in one direction, leaving Velma and Shaggy to go another.\n\nAs they search, Velma starts to grill Shaggy about the Prom. He still has to get the tickets, and the limo, and the corsage, and his tux. Velma questions if he actually wants to go to the Prom.\n\nHe attempts to tell her no, but when she starts destroying the cemetery, he quickly covers and says that he does.\n\nMeanwhile, Daphne and Scooby-Doo hear a noise in their section of the cemetery. They look behind them to see nothing, but turn back around to find…\n\n…THE GHOST GIRL!\n\nA chase ensues and ends with the gang running inside a mausoleum.\n\nInside the mausoleum, they discover that it belongs to the Carlswell family. The same family that Deacon Carlswell belonged to…or as he’s more famously known…\n\n…the Creeper. Velma reminds them that Deacon is still in prison serving time for his crimes.\n\nHowever, upon opening the coffin, they discover the Creeper mask, a transfer slip from Crystal Cove High, a backpack and some supplies.\n\nSuddenly, there is a knock on the door at the mausoleum, and in walks Fred. Daphne is relieved he’s safe and tells him that Alice May is the Ghost Girl.\n\nHowever, Fred doesn’t believe him…and the rest of the gang isn’t so sure.\n\nFred tells Daphne she’s probably overreacting, since he’s going with Alice May to the Prom and is afraid it will hurt the friendship. Daphne is heartbroken.\n\nThe next night Velma is dressed for Prom, in a Dress! Angie takes her picture and by the time she’s taken the camera back from her face…\n\n…Velma has put her turtleneck over it.\n\nFred is all spiffed up with an orange bow tie…\n\n…and promptly gets stuck in a trap.\n\nScooby-Doo gets a Dagwood sandwich out of the fridge and prepares to go to the living room…\n\n…while Shaggy watches from outside. Shaggy quickly stashes his tuxedo in the bushes.\n\nAnd finally Daphne is sitting on her bed crying.\n\nHer military sister, Delilah, comes in and gives her a very…off putting and off-topic pep talk. However, Daphne comes to the realization that she has to do something…\n\n…and that something is to tackle Fred outside his house and tell him the truth.\n\nAlice May arrives and Daphne asks him to decide. And he does. He decides Daphne, because going to the Prom with a friend is way more fun than going to the Prom with a date. Daphne says that she’ll take what she can get.\n\nFred tells Alice May he’s changed his mind and wants to go with Daphne. Her limo peels away from his house.\n\nAs it pulls away, she ominously states that she understands, and soon they will, too.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Shaggy and Scooby-Doo’s, they are enjoying the marathon. Shaggy suddenly decides they’re out of sardines and that he has to go to the store to get them.\n\nHe sneaks out and changes in the bushes, meets Velma and then hurriedly gets in their limo.\n\nScooby-Doo, however, has come to find Shaggy as they had plenty of sardines…in time to see the limo pull away. Terrified that Shaggy has been taken by the Ghost Girl, he chases after them.\n\nThey arrive at the prom, but there is no parking up front, so Velma has the driver park around back. Shortly after their limo pulls away, The Ghost Girl’s limo pulls up. Scooby-Doo arrives in time to see her get out, and that she was the only one in the limo.\n\nInside, Daphne and Fred are dancing.\n\nDaphne is detailing how this is playing out just like her dream…\n\n…when suddenly Scooby-Doo arrives to tell them about the Ghost Girl.\n\nOf course, she makes her presence known and the entire student body flees the Prom. The Ghost Girl then begins pursuing them.\n\nThe manage to slip into the basement without The Ghost Girl following them. In the basement they discover the backpack from the Carlswell Masoleum. Inside it are Alice May’s clothes and another part of the Creeper costume.\n\nThey lure Alice May back into the gym, where they trap her using the ropes from the basketball goals.\n\nMayor Dad and Sheriff Stone arrive in time for Fred to reveal that The Ghost Girl is indeed Alice May.\n\nAlice May tells them that Deacon Carlswell was her father and that she vowed revenge on the kids who had her father arrested.\n\nAnd she would have succeeded if it weren’t for her meddling schoolmates.\n\nAfter they take Alice May away, Scooby-Doo refuses to talk to Shaggy. He’s hurt because he felt that Shaggy didn’t want to watch the marathon.\n\nDaphne discovers that Alice May’s backpack has been left behind. She picks it up to return it to the sheriff, when a yearbook falls out. It’s an old Crystal Cove yearbook.\n\nInside is a picture of the missing kids. They were a mystery solving group called Mystery Incorporated. Their group consisted of Judy Reeve, Ricky Owens, Brad Chiles, Cassidy Williams and their mascot, Professor Pericles.\n\nShaggy makes the obvious connection between their group and the missing kids. But they all wonder why they disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice May is sitting in jail.\n\nSuddenly, the door opens and a man lets her out. He asks if they suspected anything and she tells them no. It will be a few days before they realize Deacon Carlswell didn’t have a daughter and by then, she’ll be gone.\n\nShe also tells him that it took her a while to find that yearbook, and wants to know why she then handed over to them. The man tells her that she was hired by Mr. E for a job, and that job is over, and she must now leave.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1) The Yearbook. We discover an old Crystal Cover yearbook that names the kids from the original Mystery Inc.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nEasy Fant-ay-see\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is a great episode for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, we get some actual character development with Daphne. She’s still very Fred-crazy, most of her plot lines will be, however she starts to take on her own personality. She’s definitely more willing to take control of her life and go after what she wants. We see this not only with Fred, but with her concern about the missing kids. Her moment with her locket is kind of touching, as it seems she genuinely wants to know who they are\n\nWe also start getting more complex relationships between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. We’ve known for 6 episodes now that Shaggy is pretty devoted to Scooby-Doo, but Scooby-Doo hasn’t shown all that much towards Shaggy. Not anymore. We clearly see that Scooby-Doo values Shaggy as his best friend. A relationship that is finally solidified.\n\nI love the use of flashbacks to the classic (and arguably one of the most famous) episodes of SDWAY. For one, it gives the series a bit of a grounding in reality, and for another it allowed Mr. E to show a truly devious side for the first time. Knowing that the gang would buy that Alice May was Deacon Carlswell’s child, allowed him to manipulate them without their knowing. Something that continues with him.\n\nOne of the other things I really like about the episode is that it’s when the real mystery starts being investigated. For the most part, it’s been on the back burner while relationships and characters and setting have been established. Now we get into the meat of the show, and we finally start to get to the core of the series.\n\nThe next episode doesn’t reveal any new clues, but does bring about the return of some of my favorite Scooby-verse characters.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nRandy and his parents look very similar to the characters played by Topher Grace, Debra Jo Rupp and\n\nAlice May looks very similar to Gwen Stacey from the Spider-Man series.\n\nThis episode marks the first appearance of Vincent Van Ghoul, a parody of Vincent Price first introduced in The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo. However, as Vincent Price has passed away, Maurice LaMarche now voices him.\n\nThe episode alludes to the classic SDWAY episode “Jeepers! It’s the Creeper!” with two notable changes: the first being that his name was merely Mr. Carlswell and the second being the baby chick’s absence.\n\nTwo teens at the prom resemble The Impossibles in street-clothes.\n\nMembers from The Chan Clan of The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan are seen leaving the prom.\n\nThe prom sequence is reminiscent of Carrie, however, that might also just be because anything spooky that happens at a prom is reminiscent of that film.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nAngel Dynamite – Vivica A.

Daphne is babysitting a boy named Arthur.\n\nHe’s currently watching an inane cartoon built around a character named Broccoli Head.\n\nDaphne announces it’s time for bed and tucks Arthur in. He proclaims her to be the bestest babysitter.\n\nShe returns downstairs to her magazine when suddenly she hears a pan-flute being played. She goes to the window and sees a strange figure outside under a street lamp. Simultaneously we see Arthur being awoken by the music.\n\nA noise upstairs causes Daphne to check on Arthur, only to discover he’s been transformed into a creature. Arthur chases her through the house and out the window.\n\nDaphne looks back at the street lamp just in time to see Que Horrifico disappear.\n\nThe next morning on the ride to school, Daphne fills the gang in on the events of the night before. Fred suggests that maybe sugar is to blame, but Daphne shoots that down.\n\nShaggy is glad to hear that as he loves sugar. Velma reminds him that he promised her to stop using the word ‘like’ because it makes him sound ignorant.\n\nDaphne realizes they’re near Arthur’s house, so she asks Fred if they can swing by and check on him. Fred says sure, since they won’t miss anything at school…even though he’s failing Civics and has to have a tutor.\n\nThey arrive to see the entire street blocked off with police tape, and parents packing up the family cars…without the kids.\n\nDaphne rushes up to Arthur’s parents and ask how he is. Arthur appears at the window and growls at them. His parents drive away.\n\nSheriff Stone and Mayor Dad are on the scene, and tell the gang that the rest of the kids on the street have also been mysteriously spookified.\n\nFred asks if there are any leads and Sheriff Stone says yes, holding up a picture of the yet-unnamed Que Horrifico. Shaggy uses the word ‘like’ and gets an elbow to the kidney.\n\nFred eagerly decides that they have a mystery on their hands…only to find themselves handcuffed. Mayor Dad is adamant that they will not solve a mystery as this is a real monster. And there are real profits to be made. He escorts them to school in the back of a police van.\n\nAt lunch that day, Shaggy is still struggling with using the word ‘like,’ so Velma gives him a rubber band to snap. She also wants him to pick out a new pair of pants from a catalog, as he’s been wearing the same ones since 8th grade. Apparently, Velma wants to change his grammar and his fashion.\n\nIn the library, Daphne and Fred are hanging around waiting on Fred’s tutor. She’s supposed to be a brilliant senior. And well, she is…but she’s also 9. With an IQ of 195. And some sort of sinus/congestion problem. Her name is Mary Anne Gleardon.\n\nShe tells them that Civics is her passion, and that she has several brilliant ideas, but that Mayor Dad thinks she’s too young to be on City Council. She then drags Fred away from a relieved Daphne.\n\nDaphne bumps into the new exchange teacher, Dr. Luis de Portillio. He introduces himself and then tells her has to leave to teach his class on South American Indigenous Mythologies (I’d take that class). He drops a book on the mysterious monster, and when Daphne hands it back to him, he gets very agitated.\n\nThat night, the mysterious monster strikes again on a different block.\n\nThe next morning the gang investigates the new block.\n\nShaggy is wearing his new pants…and is not walking terribly well in them.\n\nAngie Dinkley drives by with a bus full of tourists. She is displeased to see the gang investigating, as she too sees the source of income that this monster can generate.\n\nShe sends them off to school, but not before asking Velma to wear a shirt with the monsters face on it…and to tell anyone who asks that they’re $15.\n\nDaphne suggests that they talk to Dr. Potrillo about the monster. They arrive at his office and ask him about the monster. He tells them it’s named Que Horrifico. Fred picks up a pan flute, which causes Dr. Portillio to get quite defensive about it. When Scooby-Doo tells him that no one accused him of being the monster, he changes his tone.\n\nHe shows them the slide show he gave to his Honors class a few weeks prior. Que Horrifico, by day, is a normal person. However, at sundown he transforms and roams the villages playing his mysterious song, transforming the children into Terropogados (or in English: Spookified). The children then do his evil bidding before he takes them off to his spooky town, or cave…there’s a lot of debate about it really.\n\nThe gang suspect that Dr. Potrillo may be Que Horrifico. He has the pan flute, has admitted to not sleeping well, and has an accent!\n\nThe gang arrives at Dr. Potrillo’s house that night. They try to sneak up but Shaggy’s new pants give him away. Dr. Potrillo invites them in, since he too believes he may be Que Horrifico.\n\nThey chain him to his recliner and proceed to wait. While they wait, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo turn on the TV and begin watching the strange Broccoli Head show from earlier.\n\nSuddenly, Dr. Potrillo starts screaming that it’s beginning. After a few moments of raving about being scared, he farts…and we realize it was just gas.\n\nOutside, there is a crash and the sound of pan flutes. The gang rushes outside to see Que Horrifico disappear. A fire has been started…he’s getting dangerous. Fred announces that they will set a trap.\n\nThe gang drives through the spookified neighborhood, where more small fires are burning.\n\nThey pull into a house that’s for sale, and Fred announces the plan.\n\nThey are going to disguise themselves as a family and wait for Que Horrifico to appear.\n\nThey manage to trap Que Horrifico, but he plays the pan flute causing the children to appear and attack the gang.\n\nThe gang is persued through the house by the children. Shaggy nearly gets taken away by them…but of course Scooby-Doo saves him.\n\nShaggy and Scooby-Doo take cover inside a closet.\n\nVelma, Daphne and Fred first get trapped in a bedroom, and Velma is nearly taken out the window.\n\nThe three group together and stand back, allowing the kids coming through the window and the door to run into each other.\n\nThey escape to the living room, where all seems lost until Fred accidentally turns on the Broccoli Head show.\n\nThe kids begin laughing and sit down to watch the show.\n\nQue Horrifico appears and commands the kids to attack, however the kids want to watch the show, and take off their masks and fake teeth.\n\nThe gang chase Que Horrifico out into the streets and capture him. Or, is it Her?\n\nQue Horrifico is none other than Mary Anne Gleardon. She had wanted to scare away all the adults so that she could run the town the way she wanted to. After learning about Que Horrifico in Dr. Potrillo’s class, she went to the elementary schools to recruit the kids…with candy. She would have gotten away with it, if it weren’t for the “committo boys quod puella” (Latin for Committed boys and girls).\n\nSheriff Stone arrests Mary Anne because of all the money the town spent on Que Horrifico merchandise, including dance cds and flyers.\n\nThat night at K-Ghoul, Angel Dynamite treats the kids to pizza.\n\nDr. Potrillo appears and tells them he is here to thank them with a Pan Flute Concert! Shaggy tells Velma she needs to take the pants back because he prefers the baggy pants. She seems sad, but understands.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\nNone\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nNone 😦\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is an episode I really like, and for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, it’s the end of Velma trying to change Shaggy. Sure , it was only a two episode arc, but it was really annoying. Velma has been my favorite character as an adult, so seeing her reduced to being all about a boyfriend is not ok with me at all. Fortunately, that part is just about over.\n\nThat being said, I like it because we are seeing character developments and short arcs being written and carried through. This happens again over the course of the series, but this is really the first instance of it.\n\nI love that the bad guy is a precocious girl. She’s opinionated, funny and not afraid to take chances. She returns in another episode in Season 2, and it’s a very welcome return.\n\nI also love the return to more actual danger. Sure, Man-Crab was kinda scary…but between the Gator People, the Ghost Rig and now the spookified children, the Gang has actually seen some real action that could have led to their demise.\n\nAnd in this case, the danger is pretty high. The kids have damaged cars and started fires…it’s almost total anarchy on the streets that Que Horrifico has visited. I actually have to wonder if Mary Anne could have truly controlled the children, if that’s what they’ve sunk to in just a few days time.\n\nThe comedy in the episode was more subtle. The recurring joke of Shaggy’s rubber band was, for me, a great source of humor. Particularly when Scooby-Doo was getting such a kick out of it as well. And his pants, well…that kinda sums up my own personal feelings about overly tight pants.\n\nOne of the things I like about the series is it’s continued use of color to create mood, and again, this one uses lots of reds for the outdoor scenes in the climax. Red gives it a sense of danger and intensity. Contrasting it with orange/brown inside the house was a nice touch as well, because it gave a different feel of foreboding.\n\nThe next episode is a fun one for fans of the original series, and it also gives us more of the Mystery of Crystal Cove.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nThe initial appearance of Que Horrifico is a nod to many horror/slasher films where the evil is first seen under a street lamp by the main character (who typically isn’t believed).\n\nThe opening scenes are a nod to the urban legend of the Babysitter.\n\nWhen Shaggy gets pulled into the darkness by the spookified children, it’s similar to the scene in [REC] and it’s American remake Quarentine.\n\nThe sequence with Shaggy and Scooby hiding in a closet and tying the door closed with a scarf is a reference to Halloween when Laurie Strode does the same thing to escape Michael Myers.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nAngel Dynamite – Vivica A. Fox\n\nMayor Dad – Gary Cole\n\nAngie Dinkley – Frances Conroy\n\nMary Anne Gleardon – Isabella Acres [listed in credits as Geerdon, but later appears as Gleardon]\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nQue Horrifico – Grey DeLisle\n\nDr. Potrillo – Paul Rugg\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nThe gang’s latest mystery takes them back under Crystal Cove, when an evil Man Crab kidnaps Daphne.\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nMan Crab\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nThe episode begins with two teens, Brenda and Dylan setting up the volleyball courts for the next day’s big sand volleyball tournament. Brenda is pretty whiny and ready to leave. Dylan tells her it’s just a little longer and offers her some water. She complains that it isn’t Trickell’s Tricquid…a diet moisture.\n\nSuddenly, a gigantic claw appears out of the ground and grabs Brenda. Dylan thinks that Brenda has staged an elaborate prank because she doesn’t want to stay any longer…or something…but after the claw pulls her beneath the sand he gets worried.\n\nSuddenly, the beast jumps out of the ground and surprises Dylan as well.\n\nThe next day at the beach, Angel Dynamite is DJ-ing and doing the play-by-play for K-Ghoul. She hollers out an advertisement for Trickell’s Tricquid, for when Mother Nature doesn’t want to look fat.\n\nThe Mascot for Trickell’s Tricquid passes by trying to hoc the different versions available, but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are more interested in real “food.”\n\nSo they go see good old Skipper Shelton! Velma makes the mistake of asking what happened to his nose. Skipper Shelton launches into the story of how a clam stole his nose. And that he will continue shucking clams until he finds his nose…but in the meanwhile he sells strange ice cream made of clam.\n\nFred asks Daphne if she wants a clam, and she reminds him of what happened the last time…and it’s not pretty. Fred also asks Skipper Shelton about the new location of the shack. Skipper Shelton laments that every time the town has an event on the beach, they move his business.\n\nShaggy has to pass on the ice cream as Velma has talked him into giving up junk food. A rift has started to occur. As the gang leaves Skipper Shelton’s Shack, a strange something is observing Scooby-Doo.\n\nAt the volleyball tournament, the gang is enjoying a game…although the romance is a bit…non-existent.\n\nVelma wants to get closer to Shaggy…but Scooby-Doo forces his way between them.\n\nDaphne, at first jealous because Fred is staring at the game, is somewhat pacified/depressed to learn that he’s fascinated by the nets and not the girls.\n\nSuddenly, the ground starts to shake violently. The Man Crab appears and starts to wreak havoc! He chases the gang around the bleachers and playing field, before kidnapping one of the volleyball players, and disappearing.\n\nThe Sheriff arrives on the scene and the gang implores him to shut down the tournament. However, the owner of Trickell’s Tricquid, and the sponsor of the event calls shenanigans on it. He says that it could have been a Man Crab or a really ugly and overweight person.\n\nThe Sheriff also says his department isn’t set up for this sort of thing. They are there to serve and protect…but not from Man Crabs.\n\nThe gang, naturally, decides they get to investigate, despite Shaggy imploring them to respect authority for once. And they have their first clue. Skipper Shelton’s locker is leaking sand…and lots of it. And, given that he wasn’t around during the attack and is bitter about his shack being moved, he is a natural first suspect.\n\nFred decides that they will set a trap for the Man Crab, and Daphne (much to her chagrin) will be the bait! While the gang builds the trap, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have a rare moemnt of quiet, where Shaggy reflects on how he misses eating crab since he pledged to Velma to eat healthier. Scooby-Doo gives him the side eye as he scrambles to correct himself, stating it was his decision. Fred shows up just in time to show off the trap.\n\nVelma goes to fetch Daphne, who has changed into a bathing suit. Velma takes the opportunity to try and ask Daphne for advice about Shaggy…but Daphne, thinking that Velma is hinting about her attraction to Fred, goes a bit insane.\n\nSuddenly, the Man Crab appears and begins to chase Daphne. Meanwhile, Shaggy has abandoned his post to go get some clams, but accidentally triggers the trap. And unfortunately, she is captured.\n\nFred sort of snaps and begins frantically digging at the sand. Velma shoots Shaggy a look as he sheepishly watches.\n\nThe scene shifts to K-Ghoul that night.\n\nVelma is explaining what’s happened to Angel Dynamite. Fred is still digging. Shaggy is lamenting that if he hadn’t tried to be healthy, Daphne would be ok.\n\nSuddenly, the doorbell rings. Scooby-Doo answers it and discovers a letter from Mr. E.\n\nInside is a torn newspaper article about a group of (seemingly) three kids who went missing. Angel takes a look at it and quickly writes it off as nothing. There’s also an 8-track tape inside.\n\nFred attempts to play the 8-track on the record player, much to Angel’s horror.\n\nOn the 8-track is a recording of Mr. E. He tells them that this isn’t the first time that a group of teens has gone missing from Crystal Cove. He says this is worth researching.\n\nThe gang heads to the library.\n\nThey find an article about the creation of Trickell’s Tricquid, one about Skipper Shelton threatening the town for moving his shack and the rest of Mr. E’s artcile. Mr. E’s article tells them that the Crystal Cove Caverns run under the beach, which means…\n\n…time to explore!\n\nInside the caverns they discover a strange winding staircase…\n\n…that leads to Daphne and the other missing teens! The manage to rescue the teens when suddenly…\n\n…the Man Crab appears! And proceeds to chase the gang through the caverns and up to the surface.\n\nFortunately, they manage to spring Fred’s trap and capture the Man Crab.\n\nWho is revealed to be Bud Shelton, the actual creator of Trickell’s Tricquid. He wanted revenge for having his creation stolen, and since lawyers take forever, he chose this way. And he would have gotten away if it weren’t for those meddling brats probing into his crustacean-themed revenge scheme.\n\nBack at K-Ghoul, Shaggy is pigging out on snack food. Daphne tells Fred it’s sweet that he was so upset over her disapperance. Velma reveals to Daphne that the locket has a picture of Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves.\n\nAngel watches them…and has a suspicious air about her.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1. The Identity of Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves. These two will play a very important part in Season 2. We don’t learn their names, yet, but that doesn’t diminish their importance.\n\n2. The Newspaper. This is the first we learn of the town’s history with Mystery Solving Teams. Also, this is where the gang adopts their name, Mystery Inc.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nNone 😦\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI have to preface this review by making a bit of a confession. Beaches scare the pants off of me. Partially because I can’t swim. Partially because of all the episodes of Scooby-Doo I saw as a kid where bad things happen. I’m not afraid of being actually attacked by a shark, or a pirate, or a Man Crab…but something about them just makes me uneasy.\n\nThat said, there are things I do like about this episode.\n\nAgain, Skipper Shelton. God, I love him. From his comments about facial undergarments, to his reaction to the clam story…he just…he’s delightful.\n\nI like that they’re continuing to develop the relationships of the kids, however I definitely wish they would move along a little faster. We get it, Velma is a harpie who is trying to make Shaggy into something he’s not. Fred is clueless. Let’s move on.\n\nI like that we’re seeing more and more of Crystal Cove. It’s a surprisingly big town that seems to have just about everything conceivable.\n\nSomething else the show has started is the ability of the bad guys to sort of one-up the last one. The costumes, schemes and contraptions all get more and more elaborate, sometimes defying technology and logic. Similarly, so do Fred’s traps. I mean, honestly, how long does it take to set some of these things up?\n\nIn terms of the overall mystery, we’re getting closer and closer to it really taking off. We’re already learning that there’s more to Angel Dynamite than meets the eye…and Mr. E remains as mysterious as ever.\n\nThe next episode is actually pretty clever and gets back to a more scarier tone.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nDylan and Brenda are references to characters of the same name on the 1990s teen soap opera, Beverly Hills 90210. Dylan was played by Luke Perry and Brenda was played by Shannon Doherty.\n\nOlder versions of Pebbles and Bam-Bam from The Flintstones can be seen playing Volleyball\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nAngel Dynamite – Vivica A.

The cop tells the boy to be more careful and starts back towards his motorcycle when suddenly a strange, firey, big rig barrels past.\n\nThe cop chases after the Ghost Rig, only to be run off the road.\n\nHe watches helplessly as the Ghost Rig vanishes.\n\nWe fade in on City Hall, where Fred, Shaggy, Scooby-Doo and Velma are looking for Mayor Dad.\n\nMayor Dad tells Fred that today is the day he joins in the family business, politics. Fred protests, saying that all the kids these days are into setting traps and solving mysteries, and definitely not politics. Mayor Dad insists that Fred is just being silly and that it’s important to learn how to make pamphlets (I do agree there) and where to put parking meters (Velma snarks about knowing a good place to put one).\n\nHe then tells Fred that he needs his help primiarly with getting re-elected…by making 40,000 pamphlets.\n\nMeanwhile, Daphne is at home making ascots for Fred, when her parents summon her downstairs.\n\nThey want her to meet Rung Ladderton, heir to the local Ladder Fortune…who is kind of a major jerk face. He smugly gives her a gold ladder pendant and then tells her to call him sometime.\n\nHer parents are over the moon for him, and try to convince her to date him instead of Fred. Daphne says that it feels like cheating, even though they’re just friends.\n\nAnd then a bizarre exchange between them occurs, where Nan tries to tell Daphne it isn’t cheating on a friend so much as trying a new cut of beef. Daphne then says she prefers vegetables.\n\nBack at City Hall, Scooby-Doo is attempting to use the copier…and failing badly.\n\nUnfortunately, it covers George Avacados with toner. Avacados is the main competition for Mayor Dad. Avacados thinks he can win, since his father was once Mayor (never mind that Mayor Dad is the incumbent). Mayor Dad reveals, however, that Avacados’ father was arrested for stealing a priceless diamond from the Crystal Cove Bank.\n\nThe gang arrives at The Clam Cabin, to discover there is no doorknob on the door.\n\nSkipper Shelton, the owner of The Clam Cabin, calls out to them from a porthole, telling them he is closed. Someone has stolen his crystal doorknobs…just like the clam stole his nose.\n\nVelma tries to invite Shaggy back to her place, only for Scooby-Doo to reveal that he has had a map of every pizza place in Crystal Cove tattooed on his tongue…much to Velma’s horror.\n\nThe gang heads back to town along the coast, discussing the sudden rash of missing doorknobs when suddenly…\n\n…The Ghost Rig appears! And begins to chase them.\n\nAfter a close call or two, the gang manage to escape. They call Sheriff Stone, who predictably is excited at the prospect of a new tourist attraction, despite the obvious danger it poses.\n\nAs Sheriff Stone is leaving, Fred unearths a clue. Using a low-res phone camera, he discovers that the Ghost Truck left behind tire tracks…which means it isn’t a ghost.\n\nDaphne’s phone rings and Fred answers it. It’s Rung calling to tell Daphne that he will pick her up for dinner the next day. They’re going to The Bloody Steak.\n\nDaphne attempts to explain to Fred, who is very non-plussed and oblivious. He advises her to try the Vlad the Impaler Cursed Chicken and Rice.\n\nThe next day at City Hall, we discover all the door knobs are missing. Avacados says that there won’t be a shortage if they elect him. Making him very suspicious to the gang…so they decide to set a trap.\n\nWhile waiting for Avacados to appear so they can spring their trap, they get a call from Angel Dynamite. She tells the gang that the tires that the Ghost Truck left behind were only sold to two people, Avacados and G. Nurdo Treddall. Suddenly, the trap springs…\n\n…and catches Mayor Dad. Fred attempts to explain that they think Avacados is the Ghost Truck Driver and the Doorknob Bandit. Mayor Dad waves it off, stating that ghosts don’t need to drive because they can fly, and even if they did drive, it wouldn’t be an 18-wheeler because those require a Class-C license. Avacados casually passes by, and the kids chase after him.\n\nMeanwhile, at The Bloody Steak, Daphne is having a miserable time.\n\nNo, really. She is. Rung has stood her up.\n\nOn the outskirts of town, the rest of the gang are in hot pursuit of Avacados….however in the fog they lose him…\n\n…but find a parked Ghost Truck! Velma declares this to be the perfect time to investigate (at least, before they go Code Brown).\n\nUpon inspection, they discover that the Ghost Truck is new, but has been painted and covered with material to make it appear both old and on fire.\n\nUnfortunately, before they can find anything else out, it comes to life and chases them. Again.\n\nThey lose it by backing into an encampment and turning off the engine and lights.\n\nRung finally shows up for his date with Daphne. And proceeds to take her food. And stick her with the bill.\n\nThe gang barge in to get Daphne caught up to speed…however Rung makes his presence known first.\n\nAnd then he and Fred awkwardly trade ascots.\n\nAs Scooby-Doo searches for food, they discover an envelope from Mr. E contianing a CD.\n\nBack in the Mystery Machine, they play the CD. Mr. E. leave them a clue telling them to follow the fog…and that Crystal can’t open doors like diamonds can.\n\nVelma and Daphne question how trustworthy Mr. E. is, particularly after his last warning. However, they have no other leads to go on, so they decide to follow it.\n\nArriving at the coast, they discover that the tire tracks lead straight into the mountain…\n\n…inside of which are all the doorknobs!\n\nDaphne discovers a journal left by Theodore Avacados, the father of George. In it, he confesses to the crime. Velma puts two and two together and realizes that Theodore hid the diamond somewhere in Crystal Cove…as a doorknob.\n\nNaturally, the Ghost Truck arrives and the final showdown begins.\n\nEventually, they get the Ghost Truck to persue them into City Hall, where Fred re-springs his trap.\n\nMayor Dad arrives on the scene complaining about the noise. The gang explains and are about to unmask the bad guy when…\n\n…Rung Ladderton falls out of the truck. He had been the one searching for the diamond…and would have gotten away with it, were it not for his meddling peers.\n\nDaphne reclaims Fred’s orange ascot.\n\nMayor Dad thanks Fred for helping solve this mystery, since it will help his campaign as Mayor. He throws a press conference congratulating Fred on returning the diamond, which will make up for the lost revenue of not having a real Ghost Truck.\n\nHe also makes a new office, the Office of Pizza Affairs, and names Scooby-Doo it’s head.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\nNone in this episode\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nScreaming Pandas\n\nPickled Porcupines\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThis is the first episode we’ve had that didn’t really involve the Curse of Crystal Cove. We do later learn what happened to the diamond that’s missing, but it doesn’t play into the mystery.\n\nHowever, there are several things this episode *does* accomplish in the grand scheme of things:\n\nThe foremost thing is that it sets up Mr. E to be a good guy. He’s been kind of an ominous creep, so the fact he genuinely helps them with no ill intent helps his character a lot. It shows the gang that they can trust him.\n\nIt also gives us a look into Daphne. She isn’t quite as two-dimensional as she was in the classic series. Here she’s set up to be a misfit from her family (solves mysteries and wants Fred) as well as the gang (quite well off financially). We actually get some very solid character development from her as she tries to navigate her way.\n\nIn terms of bad guys, this is perhaps the strangest of all the bad guys the gang has ever chased. It’s a gigantic truck. The danger is once again very real (again, gigantic truck), and the stakes are higher.\n\nThe use of the movie Duel is a pretty brilliant move. The series isn’t afraid to pull out obscure references (Episode 9 gets *really* obscure) to mix in with the more obvious references. However, unlike other shows where the joke or moment is lost, with SD: MI, you can still totally enjoy the episode, even if the reference is lost on you.\n\nAgain, I have to take a moment to comment on the animation style. You’ll notice that when we change locations, I frequently screencap the establishing shot. Part of it is because it makes a nice transition, but part of it is to show off the amazing artwork in the series. The use of definite color palates for areas is really fantastic, and they know how to use the texturing to establish mood.\n\nAlso, I love Skipper Shelton. From his nose-patch, to his weird ramblings, I think he’s hysterical. Really, most of the denizens of Crystal Cove are…but Skipper Shelton just amuses me the most.\n\nWith our next episode we get a little more insight into the Mystery of Crystal Cove!\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nAs Daphne is tying Fred’s ascot, she hums the theme song to the original series.\n\nThe entire episode, particularly the final sequence, is an homage to the 1971 Steven Spielberg film Duel.\n\nGeorge Avacados’ insistence that his name is pronounced Uh-vaw-cuh-dose vs. Ah-vah-cah-dose is a play on Patricia Routledge’s character Hyacinth Bucket on Keeping Up Apperances. (Bouqet vs Bucket).\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nMayor Dad/Fred Jones, Sr. – Gary Cole\n\nMr. E – Lewis Black\n\nBarty Blake – Frank Welker\n\nNan Blake – Kathie Soucie\n\nSkipper Shelton – John O’Hurley\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nGeorge Avacados/Rung Ladderton – James Arnold Taylor\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nThe gang’s latest mystery takes them 3 miles outside Crystal Cove to Gatorsburg, where the danger is heightened.\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nThe Gator People\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nThe episode opens with a station wagon pulling into a run down, shabby town.\n\nThe family inside are headed for New York…which, according to the daughter is 2000 miles from where they are now. Realizing that they will need more gas, the father pulls over at a gas station to refuel.\n\nThe family dog, Petals, gets out and looks around only for them to discover scary gator people who chase them out of the town.\n\nMeanwhile back in Crystal Cove, it’s raining and the gang are hanging out at Fred’s house, bored out of their minds.\n\nDaphne discovers Fred’s copy of Traps Illustrated and gives him a hard time over it. He points out that’s how he created his new trap, that successfully traps the delivery guy.\n\nThe delivery guy has a package from Mr. E. Inside is a letter stating that he had been saving this for a rainy day.\n\nInside the package is a handbag made out of gator skin, with a label reading “100 % Gator. Made in Gatorsburg.” Daphne, ever the fashionista, claims that that can’t be right, Gatorsburg hasn’t manufactured anything with Gator in decades.\n\nVelma goes more in depth, explaining that during the 1800s, a group of prospectors were looking for gold…but found alligator. The town witnessed a boon as they made all sort of gator skin products, like hats, shoes, and corsets. Unfortunately, the gator wells ran dry, and Gatorsburg became a ghost town.\n\nWith all this information, they decide to go to Gatorsburg and investigate.\n\nThey arrive at the ghost town, causing Velma to quip “This is what happens when a civilization is founded entirely on a gator-based economy.”\n\nNaturally, the first decision is to split up and look for clues. Shaggy, Scooby and Velma head towards Gator Burger and discover that there is an entire supply of burgers sitting under an old hot lamp.\n\nNaturally, they decide to eat the burgers. Velma keeps trying to get Shaggy alone so that they can talk. Shaggy says he can’t because of how hungry he is. Velma, understandably, is upset by this and storms off. While Shaggy is attempting to understand her issue, Fred declares there is absolutely nothing worth investigating, much less trapping, and that they can leave.\n\nHowever, upon returning to the Mystery Machine, they discover that someone, or something, has stolen their engine.\n\nFortunately, a mechanic pulls up beside them. He tells them that he can indeed get a new engine, but since Crystal Cove is over 3 miles away, they’ll be forced to spend the night.\n\nThe gang attempts to call their parents, but each one has some reason why they can’t come to rescue their children. Horse races, the fact it’s dark…or most disturbingly, it’s Still Life Night.\n\nGrady tells them that they can spent the night at the only hotel, The Drowsy Gator. His sister Greta is the owner, and he warns them that they shouldn’t leave their rooms.\n\nAs they approach, Scooby-Doo notices that the sign changes from a normal hotel sign…\n\n…to a threat.\n\nThe hotel itself is kinda shabby…and has the air that maybe once it was less shabby. A strange out-of-tune piano is playing in the background. The owner, Greta, tries to give them the runaround. Claiming that they have no rooms, or that the painted sign is broken.\n\nWith the gang undeterred, she calls her son Gunter (who’s been playing the piano) and introduces him. They both give creepy laughs and in general are creepy. Finally she takes them upstairs.\n\nShe gives the gang the rules of the hotel. Boys and girls have separate rooms, prompting the first of a few jokes about Velma not being girly. Then she reiterates her brother’s warning to stay in their rooms, regardless of what they hear, up to and including, a body being dragged across a hardwood floor. Oh, and by the way, no pets allowed.\n\nDejectedly, Scooby-Doo heads down to the Mystery Machine for the evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Velma is primping and plans to sneak over to Shaggy’s room for some alone time. Daphne is suspicious.\n\nFred, on the other hand, starts asking Shaggy about what kind of beds they should get when the gang move in together after high school. Shaggy is having none of it because he is worried about Scooby-Doo.\n\nShaggy and Velma bump into each other in the hallway. Shaggy tries to play it off like that was his intention all along. Daphne shows up at Fred and Shaggy’s room looking for Velma. Fred says they aren’t there, but he has something for her. It’s a scrapbook…of traps they’ve had.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Mystery Machine, Scooby-Doo is attacked by the three Gator People.\n\nScooby-Doo manages to evade them and escape into the hotel, where he meets up with Daphne and Fred. The three are pursued by the Gators through the hallways.\n\nEventually, the three reunite with Shaggy and Velma, and they exit the hotel, with the gator people in pursuit. However, during the chase, they learn that the Gator’s must not be real gators, but people in a costume when one loses a limb.\n\nThey finally escape the Gators by pushing the Mystery Machine down hill and hoping on. However, they also realize that the Gators weren’t trying to kill them, just chase them out of town.\n\nReturning to the town to investigate, they discover the Gators are loading crates onto boats. Inside the crates are items labeled 100% Gator…\n\n…however upon further inspection, Daphne proves that the items are imitation alligator skin, as she has an allergy to fake animal products.\n\nThe gang naturally sets a trap and captures the Gators.\n\nThe Sheriff arrives and they unmask the Gator Family. The Gators were determined to stay in Gatorsburg, so they created their ruse to allow themselves the money to stay. Since enough time had passed since the town was abandoned, there was plenty of time for it to seem like the Alligators had returned.\n\nThey proclaim that they would have gotten away with it, if it weren’t for those “meddling juviniles and their unauthorized investigation of our synthetic gator accessories.”\n\nThen, Sheriff Stone laments that he bought a Gator Skin Track Suit…and that it doesn’t breathe. He has them arrested even though he technically has no jurisdiction.\n\nThe gang returns to the van to discover their engine has been replaced, with a note from Mr. E that states:\n\n“Hope you had a good time in Gatorsburg. But be warned, there are more mysteries to come. This is only one piece of the puzzle.”\n\nThunder claps and everyone stands around staring. Shaggy takes Velma’s hand as the episode draws to a close.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1. Gatorsburg. While it isn’t a major player in the Curse, it does hold something very important in it…but that isn’t until Season 2.\n\n2. The Sign at the Inn. “The Dog Dies!” comes back in an oblique reference that most people would forget, especially given the erratic airing schedule on CN.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\nMalevolent Mushroom Caps\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nWe’re now into the second episode of the series, and our formula is starting to appear. Standard format of mystery with clues towards the bigger mystery. Some episodes have more clues than others. This one’s are only slightly important to the overall mystery.\n\nThis episode also paints a picture of what the rest of the series is going to be like in terms of tone. The Gator People are legitimately terrifying. The lack of light in most of the attack scenes, with only mood lighting to illuminate the action is strikingly effective. Even in Zombie Island the danger was never as severe or intense.\n\nThe writing is also pretty sharp. They find a way to juxtapose the comedy while keeping things tense and scary. Particularly effective is Greta’s scene when she’s telling the kids the rules of the hotel. Her over-the-top ersatz Cajun/southern accent manages to strike the balance of funny with menace. It’s like Paula Deen meets The Evil Queen.\n\nEqually impressive is the use of color. The hallways and lobby of The Drowsy Gator are swathed in this strange pink-red color, that gives it an eerie effect, particularly in contrast to the subdued greens and blues of the bedrooms.\n\nThe character development in this episode is front and center…to a degree. Daphne and Fred are left in the same place they were in the pilot. She’s in love and he’s clueless. It’s Velma and Shaggy’s relationship that gets the coloring in this episode. In someways it’s a re-hash of the pilot as well. You see Shaggy side with Scooby-Doo and not want to hurt his feelings. You see Velma trying to seduce Shaggy. However, it’s more evident in this episode that Shaggy really does have feelings for Velma. It’s the awkward first relationship where you want to be with someone, but are afraid your best friend will be hurt or alienated. The only difference is, for most of us, our best friend is not an anthropomorphic dog.\n\nOverall the strengths of this episode are the strengths of the series itself. Sharp writing, paired with solid voice work and incredibly impressive visuals. This one was a little tamer in terms of the comedy or the pop-culture references, which is something that’s needed. The show strikes that balance very well.\n\nThe next episode brings back Angel Dynamite (a favorite of mine), as well as one of the more unusual bad guys the franchise has ever had.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nThe family featured in the cold opening is a direct reference to the Griswold’s in the National Lampoon’s Family series of movies, down to having Beverly D’Angelo voice the mother.\n\nTraps Illustrated is a take on Sports Illustrated, in particular the annual Swimsuit Edition.\n\nThe Gator Miner is actually Nugget Nose, the Galloping Ghost from the short-lived Buford and The Galloping Ghost. I had to look this one up.\n\nThe mechanic’s truck looks very similar to the truck featured in the thriller Duel, which gets an even larger reference in the next episode.\n\nThe monsters Fred references in his scrapbook of traps are The Phantom of Vasquez Castle from “Hassle in the Castle” (Episode 103 of SDWAY) and Carlotta the Gypsy from “A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts” (Episode 111 of SDWAY).\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone – Patrick Warburton\n\nMayor Dad/Fred Jones, Sr. – Gary Cole\n\nAngie Dinkley – Frances Conroy\n\nNan Blake – Kathie Soucie\n\nNotable Guest Stars:\n\nMom (in cold open) – Beverly D’Angelo\n\nDad (in cold open) – David Kaye\n\nGunther Gator – Billy West\n\nGreta Gator – Grey DeLisle\n\nGrady Gator – Joe DiMaggio\n\nBrief Synopsis:\n\nWe are introduced to a group of teens who solve mysteries in their hometown of Crystal Cove…however things are not always what they seem.\n\nBad Guy In a Mask:\n\nThe Slime Mutant\n\nEpisode Review:\n\nThe series, and episode, begins with the gang cheering over a job well done solving their latest mystery.\n\nUnfortunately, the town’s sheriff, Bronson Stone is less than thrilled, and has them locked up in jail. Stone reminds them that he is the sheriff, and that is why he wears the badge (Velma gets in some good snark here). He informs them that he has called their parents on speed-dial and that Fred should be sure to tell his dad, the mayor, hello.\n\nDejectedly, Fred comments that “At least we aren’t in this to be liked,” although neither he or the rest of the gang seem to truly feel that way.\n\nWe’re treated to the new opening credits, which introduces the main cast and something specific about them. Fred likes traps. Daphne likes Fred. Velma likes laptops. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo like food. This is the last time these will be mentioned in the actual review.\n\nWe are in a new day, and Velma is guiding tourists on the “Crystal Cove Haunted Tour.” It is here that she gives the tourists (and us) a brief overview of the town’s history: In 1630, a group of Spanish Conquistadors mysteriously disappeared “Where did they go?” asks one tourist, to which Velma snarks “What part of the word mystery didn’t you understand?”\n\nShe continues, telling them that in 1765, an entire town of missonairies also disappeared. Things went along smoothly until 1865 when Cletus Darrow found Gold and renamed the town Crystal Cove. Most thought the Curse had been lifted, however one Halloween, the Darrow family also mysteriously disappeared. Velma pulls out a tape player and plays a recording of a woman screaming. So much shade is thrown in this first exchange, it’s ridiculous.\n\nShe then guides the tourists inside the museum, telling them that since the disapperance of the Darrow family, the town has been a hub of paranormal activitiy. She takes them by statues of previous monsters that she and her friends have unmasked are displayed. They include Charlie the Robot, Miner ’49er, Space Kook, Captain Cutler’s Ghost, The Creeper, and The Luna Ghost. The tourists exclaim that they must have been terrifying, to which Velma finally comes to life as she details how they were all fake…or tries to.\n\nHer parents, Angie and Dale, arrive to hush her up and move the tourists on to the Haunted Snack Shop “…for souvenirs and [their] complimentary undead sipper cup.” The tourists eagerly rush off. Angie and Dale chastize Velma for exposing the truth. They truly believe that Crystal Cove is full of paranormal activity, which Velma very clearly doesn’t. She states that there is only one thing her generation is interested in and thats…\n\n…a fast cut to Fred tying his ascot on proclaiming “Solving mysteries and building traps.” This is much to his father, Mayor Dad’s chagrin. His dad wants Fred to set an example. Fred just wants to build traps and find answers. Mayor Dad tells Fred that life isn’t about all of that it’s really about…\n\n…Food. Specifically, pancakes, bacon, sausages and orange juice. At least, that’s what Shaggy and Scooby-Doo think. Shaggy’s parents, Paula and Colton (who is sort of emasculated), are ashamed of his slacker behavior and the mystery solving behavior. They want him to find new friends. Shaggy attempts to tell them that they’re over-reacting and to give the gang a chance…\n\n…becuase they’re just solving mysteries. And all the kids are doing it. Or so Daphne attempts to tell her parents, Nan and Barty. We learn that Daphne is quite well off financially, but she is also a disappointment to her family…as her four older sisters have highly respectable careers and husbands.\n\nSuddenly, a horn honks and the lengthy exposition of the characters is over. We cut to some underground area of some sort and a construction crew is drilling into rock. Suddenly, one of them falls through a brick wall, revealing caves and tunnels behind it.\n\nThey investigate, and naturally run into several canisters of radioactive waste clearly marked DANGER. One of the canisters, naturally, is moving. Naturally, the foreman says that whatever is inside is clearly dangerous and it must be opened so that whatever *is* inside doesn’t disrupt their schedule. Of course, this is the first encounter with The Slime Mutant.\n\nThe next scene has the gang driving to school in The Mystery Machine. Velma and Shaggy are riding in the back, and we learn that the two are secretly dating. Secretly, because Shaggy is worried that Scooby-Doo will get jealous of the relationship. Velma wants to tell Scooby-Doo now.\n\nBut, before she can a manhole cover suddenly explodes up from the ground and they are attacked by The Slime Mutant.\n\nFred, sensing a mystery is at hand, declares it more important than school and they start to investigate. They find themselves in the caves and discover the canisters. Velma states that based on the oxidation, they’re between 30 and 40 years old.\n\nDaphne discovers a strange magnifying glass shaped locket. Inside is a faded picture of a boy and girl in 1960s clothes. The locket plays a mysterious tune when opened. Fred congratulates her on finding the clue, and we learn that he is completely oblivious to Daphne’s feelings.\n\nShortly thereafter, the gang discovers the construction workers trapped on the ceiling, encased in a lime green cocoon of ickiness. The gang call Sheriff Stone. Stone tells them that this is a crime scene and that he is in charge.\n\nFred attempts to talk to Stone, but instead winds up stealing one of the bodies. He decides they need to visit Professor Emmanuel Raffalo, the Biology teacher at Crystal Cove High.\n\nProfessor Raffalo informs them that the construction worker isn’t dead, merely in a dehydrated stasis. He asks to keep the body to perform further analysis as the gang heads out to keep investigating.\n\nThe gang, at Shaggy and Scooby-Doo’s request, go to Fruitmier’s, a new smoothie/yogurt/soft serve combo, that is lime green. Even Franklin Fruitmier, the creator, isn’t sure what it is. Fred suggests that if the cocoon is indeed organic, they might actually have a legitimate paranormal occurence. Velma offers up some science-babble and attempts to hold Shaggy’s hand…which of course freaks him out. Daphne asks Velma if something is going on between them, which causes an outburst as Velma stalks off. Daphne again attempts flirting with Fred…and he again is oblivious (or at least seemingly).\n\nIn the High School Biology Lab, Professor Raffalo is analyzing the cocoon, when he is suddenly attacked by The Slime Mutant.\n\nThe scene changes to the local AM Radio Station, K-Ghoul, where the DJ, Angel Dynamite is letting Fred hang out. He feels guilty about what happened to the Professor. The gang attempts to cheer him up. They remind him that he’s never walked away from a mystery before.\n\nVelma tries to tell him that she’s brought a sample of the cocoon, only to discover that Scooby-Doo is eating it. Of course. Scooby-Doo tells them that it’s actually Fruitmier’s and totally edible. Angel Dynamite tactfully informs the group that “If that dog mutates, I’m puttin’ it down. Dig?”\n\nShaggy also tries the cocoon and reassures the gang that it is indeed Fruitmeir’s. This means that The Slime Mutant must not be a real monster after all. The gang starts to suspect that Franklin Fruitmeir is the bad guy, and conveniently he is hiring new female assistants…\n\n…which inevitably leads to Shaggy and Scooby-Doo having to cross dress, because Daphne and Velma refuse. That night, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo let the rest of the gang into Fruitmeir’s shop, and they start to investigate.\n\nThis leads to another brief encounter with The Slime Mutant. Daphne ends up trapped in a storage closet, and then falls through a trap in the floor. Naturally.\n\nThis, however leads them to the cave system they found earlier. They discover another hole only a few feet from the first one, which is directly below the Crystal Cove Bank. (Convenient, no?) With that, they start to plan the capture of The Slime Mutant.\n\nIn true Fred Jones fashion, he creates an elaborate Rube Goldman trap, which almost goes off without a hitch.\n\nHowever, the gang does manage to get the upper hand and they cocoon The Slime Mutant to the wall. Stone and Mayor Dad show up on cue and accuse them of hijacking their latest tourist attraction.\n\nThe gang accuse Franklin Fruitmeir, but are surprised when it turns out to actually be Professor Raffalo.\n\nProfessor Raffalo tells them that he was using the disguise so he could steal money from the bank. Daphne momentarily questions this aloud, before realizing that he’s a teacher and of course he needs the money.\n\nHe declares that his plan would have worked if it wasn’t for those meddling kids and their blasted dog. Stone takes him away. Daphne asks Professor Raffalo about the locket, but he knows nothing about it, however there is a strange flash of recognition on Mayor Dad’s face.\n\nStone chastises them for taking away their new stream of revenue.\n\nBack at K-Ghoul, the gang are celebrating and listening to some groovy tunes, when a call comes in. The mysterious caller tells them that they are all doomed. He identifies himself as Mr. E, and tells them that they should never brought the locket out of the cave. That they have started to unravel the true mystery, a mystery that should have stayed buried…forever.\n\nRelevant Clues to the Curse of Crystal Cove:\n\n1. Daphne’s Discovery of the Locket. It will eventually be revealed who the boy and girl are.\n\n2. The Introduction of Mr. E. He becomes vital to the series.\n\nMayor Dad’s Strange Statements:\n\n1. Tickling Chitwhiskers\n\n2. Hopping Steamclamps\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nWhere to start? I guess with some of the more obvious things first. This is most likely the only time it won’t just be a straight review, as there is a LOT to discuss in terms of changes made for the re-boot.\n\nCrystal Cove\n\nThis is the first franchise where the gang’s hometown is not Coolsville. The town is renamed Crystal Cove and is dubbed “The Most Hauntedest Place on Earth.” Why it’s called Crystal Cove when it’s where gold was found, I’ll never know.\n\nPresumably we are somewhere in Northern California. We’ll learn later that they aren’t too far from mountains, and given that they solved the case of Miner ’49er sometime prior to the start of the series, they have to be somewhere close to San Francisco. There is a very heavy Spanish influence to the town’s architecture as well.\n\nInterestingly, when I first watched the show and wasn’t paying attention to context clues and history, I assumed that this probably took place in the Pacific Northwest, where I always felt the original series (before they started to really go places) was somewhere in New England.\n\nThere is no way to speculate when exactly this series would be set chronologically (as evidenced in a few later episodes).\n\nTime Period/Design Elements\n\nThis is a bit trickier to narrow down. Presumably, it is set in the present day, based on the amount of technology available to the gang and bad guys. The fashions and color schemes, however, suggest that the town is stuck in a retro-world.\n\nFor the most part, the characters have been reverted back to their original 1969 costumes. The most obvious change being that Velma now has two little red bows in her hair.\n\nThe series has it’s very own unique design. The textures and colors are much different than what we saw in the classic series. Frankly, I am all for it.\n\nCharacters\n\nThe characters have developed some since 1969. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo largely remain the same. Fred has kind of become a lovable oaf, where in the original series he was more non-descript. Daphne, still slightly danger prone, is no longer the dumber of the two women. She’s actually one of the more mature team members, and by openly giving her a wealthy family (something merely suggested in early incarnations), it does set up a difference between them. Velma has largely remained the same, but is significantly snarkier than before.\n\nThe fact that the cast are very definitely in high school is also a change. In previous incarnations, they had all already graduated. Frankly, I like this aspect a lot. For one, it makes them a little more relatable, and it keeps things from getting too strange. I also think it forced the writers to be more creative when they couldn’t suddenly take them off to Japan, or Scotland, or Djiboutti.\n\nThe Episode\n\nThe episode itself is a little slow to start. There’s a LOT of exposition that has to go into the first few minutes, and honestly, it barrells through it. We learn that the town wants to profit off of the so-called mosnters, we learn that their parents don’t get them, and we learn about their romantic intanglements.\n\nAt first, I was kinda put off by the romantic subplots with everyone. Sure, Daphne and Fred had been in a defacto relationship from the get go, but the idea of Velma/Shaggy was a new concept that the series introduced. Thankfully, this series handles the Velma/Shaggy plot with a LOT more maturity and dignity than the awful Scooby-Doo: The Curse of the Lake Monster from a little later in 2010.\n\nI honestly can not rave about the characterization of this show more. They develop everyone so fully that you don’t think of them as just being a group of stock characters, but characters with some interesting shading.\n\nSimilarly, I was originally not too pleased to hear Patrick Warburton’s voice. I do enjoy him, but didn’t necessarily want to see him in the franchise, however Sheriff Stone is a welcome addition to the franchise (as are several of the other major characters they introduce).\n\nThe plot is pretty standard, and honestly, with as much changing as they did to the series, I’m kind of glad for it. Having the familiarity of “Bad Guy in Mask” and the inevitable “Meddling Kids” comment, keeps the show from seeming like a complete and total overhaul, something a lot of reboots seem to miss. The fact that they actually gave a plausible background for Prof. Raffalo was pretty nice. It wasn’t your “Oh, I’m doing it because I want money,” it was “I’m doing this because I’m a teacher and make squatt.”\n\nI also really loved the nods to the classic series. I never cared much for the redesigns, so having everyone back in their real outfits was something that automatically drew me to the series. The sly injokes will continue throughout the series.\n\nSmall details like these are part of what make this series so great and stand out among the other series in the franchise.\n\nThe next episode is actually one of my favorites, The Creeping Creatures.\n\nPop-Culture References:\n\nIn the opening scenes of the tour, one of the tourists is clearly patterned after Don Knotts. Knotts partnered up with Scooby-Doo and company twice before in The New Scooby-Doo Movies.\n\nThe statues are all former bad guys, mostly from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, however The Luna Ghost is from the 2002 Live-Action film Scooby-Doo.\n\nAs if it wasn’t obvious, the joke about a teacher needing to rob a bank is a little too on the nose.\n\nMain Cast:\n\nNorville “Shaggy” Rogers – Matthew Lillard\n\nScoobert “Scooby” Doo – Frank Welker\n\nFrederick “Fred” Jones, Jr. – Frank Welker\n\nDaphne Blake – Grey DeLisle\n\nVelma Dinkley – Mindy Cohn\n\nFeatured Recurring Characters:\n\nAngel Dynamite – Vivica A.
