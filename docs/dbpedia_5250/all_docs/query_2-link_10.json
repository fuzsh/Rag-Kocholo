        "text": "Kemal Amin \"Casey\" Kasem, (born on April 27, 1933 in Detroit, Michigan; to Lebanese Druze parents; died on June 15, 2014) is an American radio personality and voice actor. Mr. Kasem is a graduate of Northwestern High School in Michigan and the Wayne State University. He was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Radio at 6931 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.\n\nBackground[]\n\nKasem founded the popular American Top 40 franchise in 1970, hosting it from July 4, 1970 to August 6, 1988 and then from March 28, 1998 to January 3, 2004. Between 1989 to 1998, he was the host of Casey's Top 40, Casey's Hot 20, and Casey's Countdown. After stepping down from American Top 40 in 2004, he hosted two weekly syndicated radio programs based on the American Top 40 franchise until his retirement on July 4, 2009 (39 years after the launch of American Top 40): American Top 20 with Casey Kasem, and American Top 10 with Casey Kasem. Rebroadcasts of older American Top 40 shows are aired every weekend on select radio stations around the world: Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 70s, and Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 80s - both those series feature music covering the periods of July 1970 to December 1979, and January 1980 to August 1988 respectively. In addition to his radio shows, Kasem was the voice of NBC, and helped out with the annual Jerry Lewis telethon. He also voiced the character Cliffjumper in animated TV series Transformers (1984) and then two years later in The Transformers: The Movie (1986).\n\nVoice on Super Friends[]\n\nStarting in 1968, he began doing the voice of Robin, The Boy Wonder on The Batman/Superman Hour.
