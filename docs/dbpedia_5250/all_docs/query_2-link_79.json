        "text": "There aren’t many occasions where live-action performances by actors take them into the world of voice acting that same character for animation roles, but that did happen for Matthew Lillard (Scream, Twin Peaks) whose role in the 2002 and 2004 Scooby-Doo movies gave him the chance to voice Norville “Shaggy” Rogers from then on.\n\nLillard has practically voiced all Shaggy roles in animated movies and TV shows since original Shaggy voice actor Casey Kasem stepped down from the role in 2009. His most recent role was the 2019 release Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost.\n\nWhat came as a surprise to fans and also Lillard himself was the announcement of a 2020 theatrical animated Scooby-Doo movie not featuring the veteran voice actor and had us all shouting “ZOINKS!” The news of the movie was shared on Twitter with Lillard sharing the post, saying:\n\n‘Well this sucks. What a crappy way to find out…. thanks Hollywood. You never sense to amaze me.’\n\nThe role of Shaggy will be voiced by former Saturday Night Live cast member Will Forte along with Tracy Morgan, Gina Rodriguez and voice acting legend and original Scooby-Doo voice cast, Frank Welker, who will most likely reprise his role as either Fred or Scooby-Doo.\n\nMany have expressed their disgust with Lillard being dropped from the role of Shaggy and is clearly a fan favourite with those who still watch the shows and movies. In the untitled cinematic movie which is scheduled for a May 2020 release, there will be other Hanna-Barbera characters including Dick Dastardly who will be the main villain, as well as Captain Caveman who will be voiced by Morgan.\n\nThe character Shaggy Rogers received a lot of attention at the beginning of 2019 becoming a popular meme. The meme begun where interviews with the cast of the 2002 Scooby-Doo movie had their quotes altered to make Shaggy sound like an unstoppable super-being. From there on out many memes came to be of Shaggy being the new Chuck Norris."
