        "text": "With his warm, mellifluous voice and velvet-like delivery, disc jockey Casey Kasem built the foundation for one of radio's most popular programs \"American Top 40\" (syndicated, 1970- ). Kasem's format of counting down the most popular songs, with the inclusion of fun facts and personal long-distance dedications, captivated a nation of radio listeners who found his enviable music knowledge and Everyman appeal a comforting constant in their lives. Kasem was also a prominent voice actor, adding humor and life to the affable slacker Shaggy on the Saturday morning staple, \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" (CBS, 1969-1972, 1974-76; ABC, 1976-78, 1982-84) and subsequent series from the popular franchise. Weathering decades of shifting musical styles, declining ratings, and contractual issues, Kasem remained as the host and driving force behind \"American Top 40\" for 39 years, an unparalleled achievement by a true icon of the entertainment industry. Sadly, the end of his life was marred by a feud between his wife, actress Jean Kasem, and his children from his first marriage, who went to court accusing their stepmother of restricting their access to their father, who was suffering from Lewy body dementia. The case was still proceeding when Casey Kasem died on Father's Day, June 15, 2014."
