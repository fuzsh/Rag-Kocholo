Zack (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Slater (Mario Lopez) both want to go with Kelly (Tiffani Thiessen), who ends up going with Slater. While Zack ends up dancing with Jessie (Elizabeth Berkley), who feels she's too tall to enter. She coaches Zack on how to dance and they have a great time. Meanwhile, Lisa's (Lark Voorhies) talented dance partner backs out when she sprains her ankle. Though rejected by Lisa, Screech (Dustin Diamond) agrees to be her dance partner and they win with the new dance, 'the sprain'. Casey Kasem guest stars.\n\nRockumentary\n\nCasey Kasem narrates the rise and fall and rise again of the gang's band, Zack Attack.
