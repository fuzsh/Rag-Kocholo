        "text": "The 2002 live action Scooby-Doo was the first time Matthew Lillard first portrayed the amateur detective. With 25 movies, 3 TV series, and multiple appearances as Scooby-Doo's best friend, Shaggy Rogers, he's one of the longest standing actors behind the character. Since Casey Kasem retired from the role in 2009, Matthew Lillard has been the voice of Shaggy, but he is not the only one how's gotten to say the iconic \"zoinks!\". Scott Innes, Billy West, and Scott Menville were some of the many voice actors to lend their voice to Shaggy.\n\nThere's always a second killer and many horror fans love Matthew Lillard's scream worthy portrayal of Stu Macher, one of the original Ghostface killers from Wes Craven's original 1996 film Scream. As a fan favorite from the film, Stu has some of the funniest lines for a killer and many fans think that he had one of the best performances of the whole movie.\n\nFor all those who think Stu lived, you are not alone. In the Vulture article Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich Answer All Our Questions About Scream, Matthew Lillard said \"I’m the grandfather of Stu truthers\".\n\nYou rolled a natural 20 and were able to obtain a bottle of Quest's End Whiskey, a DnD inspired whiskey brand that was launched by Matthew Lillard and first went on sale online October 6, 2023. There are now 4 classes of whiskies to choose from with the names of Paladin, Rogue, Warlock, and Dragon.\n\nThe theme does not stop at the label. If you go on to Quest's End Whiskey you must verify your age and species (human, gnome, elf, dwarf, halfling, half-elf or half-orc) before you can assemble your party. Need DnD inspiration? We highly recommend scrolling through the Frequently Accomplished Quests Frequently Asked Questions for a good time.\n\nBeadle & Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse is in the business of \"loot-making\" and one of the 5 founders is avid DnD fan Matthew Lillard. In the Forbes article, How Dungeons & Dragons Got, Matthew Lillard Through A ‘Midlife Crisis’, Matthew Lillard shares the goal of Beadle & Grimm’s Pandemonium Warehouse.\n\n“Our goal as a company is to touch every player in a way that makes their game better,” said Lillard. “Our first goal is to make a Dungeon Master’s job easier but we want to help players too. That’s why we introduced player journals and dice sets to curate people’s experience around the table. If you are passionate about this hobby, we offer something that’s built for you by people like you.”"
