        "text": "Fan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: I Wrote Melissa Greenspan A Nice Message On Her Website 06.13.2022 She Read And Replied Back To Me, Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey Must Bring Back Such Fun Recording Sessions For You Melissa Greenspan Jerry Lewis Cree Summer Jeff Bennett Amy Hill Plus Carlos Alazraqui.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Tiffany,\n\nCurious George is one of those characters that is very enjoyable for me to do and as you have pointed out a lot of fun actors were in “Follow That Monkey!” Sometimes we don’t all get to work together and that is even truer now after covid and a lot of us are recording separately. So, I will remember the sessions with fun people, cast and crew fondly.\n\nBest, Frank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: Time Squad I Also Remember Seeing On TV. Hmm Wanted To See It Get Season 3 Was It Easy To Know Your Lines By Heart On That Show?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nTiffany,\n\nI don’t remember “Time Squad,” maybe I was just a guest, but no I have not had to memorize lines for many years and that was always for a film or on camera TV roles. Thank goodness we just read lines for voice work…oh my!!!\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Jessi W.\n\nQuestion: Happy 20th anniversary to scooby doo the movie and also happy 20th anniversary to you spooky demon! I was only two years old when it came out and I still Watch it to this day\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nJessi!\n\nHoly cow that was a long time ago, it does go by fast. Hard to believe we have been doing Scooby Doo in different forms for 53 years now! Yikes, that means I must be getting old…right?!? Well, I feel and think the same as I did when we started the show, just can’t believe I am over 30! (wink). Thank you for the good wishes Jessi!\n\nRoooby Rooooo!\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Alec G.\n\nQuestion: Did you have a lot of fun voicing the Goblins in the Trollhunters series and did you ever meet Del Toro, the man himself?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Alec!\n\nIt is always fun doing those kinds of voices…although sometimes it can be a bit taxing on the vocal cords. I liked the show. I never met anyone else as we worked alone. I did my recording sessions at the studio and by myself. We also did several shows at a time so that really messed me up as far as continuity. Lol\n\nBest Alec,\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Amber N.\n\nQuestion: Hi frank if you were to make your own Scooby Doo movie what would you want it to be?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Amber,\n\nWonderful question! It might be kind of fun to have the original group of villains (first season) get together and form Villain’s Inc. and parallel what the Mystery Inc. They would come together as a united front and try and outwit the gang. Red Beard sets incredible traps, Mummy shops for clothes etc. In the end at the unmasking the villains would all be the gang’s schoolteachers trying to get Mystery Inc to think out of the box. Now you can see why I am just an actor…oh my!\n\nBest wishes Amber.\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Andrew B.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank, First, a light hearted question: I'm told (sadly I have not seen this episode) that in the Valentine's Day episode of \"What's new, Scooby Doo?\", we get a rare glimpse of the gang's domestic arrangements and it shows Fred living with Scooby and Shaggy. Is that something you would have predicted? I know it's a kids show and you are rightly famous for your much admired reticence to comment through an adult lens about kids shows, but quite a lot of people would have predicted that Fred and Daphne would have been cohabitating by now. Second, I have to say how much I admire your approach to interactions with your fans, I'm sure there are questions you choose not to respond to publicly but your grace, positivity and kindness even towards those critical of your work just gives us Reverse Cycle Airconditioners even more to admire about you. Many other talented people could still stand to learn a great deal form you.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nAndrew,\n\nThere was an iteration of Scooby Doo that was populated by new and young writers and a head producer/director who was out of improv comedy (Mitch Simpson) who took us on new journeys that we were all a little surprised by…this group was a fun bunch and quite clever. I was happy to go on the journey. They expanded Fred’s character with deeper reactions and emotions, and one of those was jealousy. They enjoyed pushing Daphne and had her admiring (much to Fred’s chagrin) a litany of muscle bound and chiseled chin lads. I never really thought to much about it to be honest but did enjoy their writing and pushing the boundaries. I think it is the creators and networks in this case to select the age range they are aiming at…but Scooby started to trend up in the viewer age range, so I think that is where the writing started to see changes that were a little more sophisticated. In the end, the studio will tend to tread carefully on how much they expand the stories and characters. It remains a jewel in their library so I doubt if you will see them allow too much more in the way of expansion, but you never know for certain.\n\n​\n\nI really appreciate what you said that means a lot and I hope that I can live up to your very nice words.\n\nBest, Freddy Jones aka Frank Welker\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Dawson K.\n\nQuestion: dear frank i been watching scooby doo francise, i'm a special educational fan for it your the voices of scooby and fred jones, dynamutt, bigfoot from a goofy movie, totoro from my neighbor totoro, and megatron from transformers, goddard, various voices from jimmy neutron. lol Dawson King\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Dawson,\n\nYes, it looks like you have done your research and watching…everything you listed is correct. I can also add just a couple more, “Curious George,” and “Garfield.”\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Alex F.\n\nQuestion: Hey Frank! I love your work! I even started a Scooby-Doo club back in highschool where we just watched and talked Scooby-doo. I was wondering if you had a favorite episode or movie of Scooby-doo that was your favorite to record, and why. Thank you so much, and I just wanted to let you know that you're my #1 favorite voice actor of all time. Have a great summer Frank!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Alex,\n\nOf course, I loved the very first season because everything was new, and we were all just so happy to have a show…who would believe 50 plus years later we would be still going strong! I liked the “Scooby Doo and Kiss Rock and Roll Mystery” a lot. I remember the studio had a showing on the Warner lot and all of Kiss and their kids were there. I think the music was so vibrant and the color and art where top notch. Gene Simmons seemed to really enjoy the experience and we would work together again on Scooby in different show formats. So many shows and movies it is hard to say just one Alex!\n\nThank you for allowing me the honor of being at the top of your voice artist list. With all the immense talent in our business it truly is humbling…thank you!\n\nBest, Frank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Omar D.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank! How could I go about having you and Peter Cullen as guest on a \"remote\" zoom recording for a podcast talking about Transformers!? Love all the great work you've done! You're the Best!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Omar,\n\nThank you for the kind offer, I am not doing any podcasts currently and I do not believe Peter is either. I am so bad and not very tech savvy, so I don’t hear any podcasts either…I know I am behind the times!!! I do hope Peter and I get to do more and more Transformer projects. Thanks again Omar and best of luck with your show.\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Joe F.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank, big fan of you and your work, actually the fact that you are reading this, if you are reading this, scares me a little bit. So, i will procede to try not to ramble. I had to decide, but finally my questions for you are: Since you've been working in the industry for many years, Do you ever look at a performance you gave and said: \"Ohh, i could've done it better!\". Also, what are some of the things you feel you have improved on since you first started working? My second question is in regards to the fact you made a COMEDY ALBUM that was released in 1988, and it featured impersonations of famous celebrities. How did that thing came about? Did you look back at it fondly? Well, i guess that's it. Hope i didn't bother you in any way. Take care, Frank, your work is much appreciated.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nJoe!\n\nGreat questions! Yes, I look back and many times wish I would have done a performance differently or better. I wrote an acceptance speech for my Emmy award for “Lifetime Achievement” and agonized over it. When I performed it (I had a lot of jokes) I really wished I had spent more time on thanking my dear friend Peter Cullen who did my introduction. His piece was so perfect and beautiful with deep respect and solemnity and mine was laced with jokes…but in retrospect, the audience was so loud they barely heard me or any of the winner’s acceptance speeches. It is weird, people are talking at all the tables, and eating, and drinking and discussing their wins or loses so you really can only hear what recipients are saying when you see the video footage afterwards. In all modesty, I did like the speech after all but would still like to do it over.\n\nI think I have become a better reader, but I still need to closely read dialog and am not a good cold reader. Cold reading is when you get a script or dialog and are asked to read it or perform it on the spot without preparing. I can adlib but cold reading is still hard though as I say I think I have improved. This is one thing I tell all those who wish to do voices or act as well…read everything you can get your hands on because cold reading and reading in general is of utmost importance. In my defense, I have a weak eye or “wondering eye” which tends to make reading more difficult…but still, I repeat…read, read, read.\n\nRegarding the comedy album “All Most Sold Out” it was a great experience. Writing it with friends John Findlater, Cort Casady and Larry Cansler was heaven. Recording it live and in studio was great fun and a super experience and I look back on it VERY fondly.\n\n​\n\nThank you, Joe, for the very thoughtful questions and you didn’t bother me at all. I am here to answer questions.\n\nBest wishes, Frank\n\n______________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Amber N.\n\nQuestion: Hello frank I recently watched the computer wore tennis shoes and now you see him now you don't and I enjoyed them I know you were in them but have you seen them?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nYes, Amber, I have seen them both, but it has been a long time. Last time I saw Kurt Russell he was on set in a project with my girlfriend at the time Pamela Sue Martin, and it was a kick seeing him again after all his big screen success. We talked about the old days and those Disney movies. He is a good guy and Pamela was a special lady and we had great times together. I loved my hair in those days too!\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Peter B.\n\nQuestion: Hi Mr. Welker, absolute long time fan of work sir, especially on Scooby Doo, since since I was a kid growing up! My name is Peter and I was curious to know if you are doing podcast interviews currently at this time and if you are I was also curious to know how much she charges for interviews? I ask because I have a small YouTube podcast called Petey's Awesome Guest Panel where I interview voice actors/actresses and wrestlers I've been fans of growing up. I don't have any fancy podcast or media company, I'm just an average Teacher Assistant for Special Needs children who loves interviewing people that inspire me. I've had 61 episodes and I have interviewed many voice actors/actresses like Sue Blu, Townsend Coleman, Gregg Berger, Paul Eiding, Maggie Roswell, Cam Clarke, Carey Means, Pat Musick, . Here's a link to my show's page incase you wanted to see some of my work.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMr. Bowman,\n\nHello, I do get asked to do a lot of them or listen to them and I really appreciate the ask but no I am currently not doing any. I think these kinds of outlets for media are a terrific way to get some really good guests and background into the industry, so I congratulate you sir!!\n\nContinued success.\n\nAll the best, Frank\n\n______________\n\nFan Name: Matthew S.\n\nQuestion: Hello, Mr. Welker! I remember a Transformers fan bringing up a question that related to you being absent in some Transformers projects that Peter Cullen got to participate in. While it is quite well known you did not voice Megatron in the first three movies due to Michael Bay's vision for the character at the time and the Netflix War for Cybertron series due to the union vs non-union differences, it appears you had not voiced Megatron nor Soundwave in the War for Cybertron/Fall of Cybertron video games (which are not directly related to the Netflix show), the Machinima Prime Wars Trilogy, and the Bumblebee movie. It is worth mentioning that Megatron was absent in that movie as he was still frozen in ice yet Soundwave was there and was voiced by someone who, despite capturing the voice of the character, was more of a stand-in as Peter Cullen described for his discussion on how he was brought in for one recording day only. With all that said, is the lack of your portrayal as Megatron and Soundwave in those forms of media I brought up because the individuals in charge did not cast you either without knowing of your return or because Cullen received more attention, or was it due to your commitment to other projects that didn't involve Transformers after 2014 outside of The Last Knight? Thanks and I hope you have a great day!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMatthew,\n\nYour keen observation of these projects is right on. Sometimes the case is the producers do not wish to deal with the union or agents or assume we/me would not be available. I am not sure about the video games you are referring to but may have been a problem in a negotiation. I am available and really enjoy doing Megatron from G1 to the Feature version…still great fun. In the Bumblebee movie the director used the stand in voice, and I think was not aware that I was available and seemed less concerned about who did the role. I was never approached to do the voice for that feature. Hasbro just had me do something, so we are still doing projects. I will say it is very disappointing when entities have people replicate the voices we created and undercut the quality and originality. I know in a couple of the recent projects there was to be a radical change in the direction of the characters and both Peter and I were offered to participate but declined. It is sad and it hurts but unfortunately, it does occur. I hope in the future if the fans ask and want the original Megatron and Soundwave the studios will listen. I am here and waiting. “ All Hail Megatron!” Oh, and Soundwave…”REPORT!”\n\nFrank\n\n______________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: James M.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank! I’m not sure if you remember me but I got to chat with you and Peter Cullen through GalaxyCon via video chat. I asked you and Peter what your favorite designs were of Megatron and Optimus, your favorite Optimus and Megatron moment of all time, and what roles you’d consider as your best work. Since you voice Megatron and Soundwave, which of those 2 characters would you say you relate to the most? Hope to see you again someday!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi James,\n\nWelcome to my site. GalaxyCon was fun but now happy to say we are hitting the pavement and out on the tour again so virtual is in the backseat! I always love doing Megatron since he is the big bad dog, but it is fun bringing Soundwave in for coffee so to speak. In the features with Michael Bay, I really liked doing Soundwave in foreign languages. Hearing him in Japanese and Russian was crazy. It was difficult and I spent more time on those than actual time in the original production. Anyway, I would have to say Megatron would be the most relatable as I do the most work with that character…relatable in terms of work!\n\nBest James!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Twitter is going crayyyzyyy that you’re now voicing Garfield in Nick All Star Brawl. I gotta let you know Frank that you’re dearly loved by a lot of people, even if you don’t see much of it\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Amber! Wow, thank you for the heads up…it is always nice to hear!!!! I don’t know Twitter or much about social media so kind of out of the loop. Yes, it looks like Garfield is part of the “All Star Brawl.” I don’t know too much about it but happy that Garf is in the show. Best to you and my friends across the pond!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Preson A.\n\nQuestion: I live in Dallas and I am ready for you to come back fan expo. I met you once when you came to here and I appreciate your voice acting very much. I have recently bought a bunch of cels of different characters that I would love to have you sign. Also, I would enjoy sharing your stories about your experiences with your characters and their cartoons as well. Thank you\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Preston,\n\nLet’s hope we can get back to Fan Expo. Check the “Where is Frank” page for locations we are coming to. We are adding more all the time and hopefully we can get back out to your area and get those cells signed. Until then, have a great summer.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Jessi W.\n\nQuestion: I have some amazing YouTube friends called Jaybee&milly right now they are doing podcasts for the 20th anniversary of the 2002movie right now they’re interviewing cast from the 2002 movie and crew from the 2002 movie And they’re really big fans of yours\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Jessi! Jaybee&Milly sound like they have a rocking podcast. That is a good way for people to talk and get information out there and get some fun insights and back stories. I listen to a few but need to expand more. Take care and happy summer!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: What's Kevin Conroy like? Hes definitely up there in the legends section of voice acting with you!!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Amber,\n\nI really haven’t worked with Kevin much over the years but when I have, I have found him very professional and a skilled actor. He has a great voice for sure and he is good at his job. Also, he was always easy to work with and again a real pro. I always enjoyed watching him work.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Bradford S.\n\nQuestion: Hi Mr. Welker, I hope you are doing well, staying healthy and looking forward to the summer. Hopefully you won't mind my asking, but I was just curious what the earliest memory is that you have of your voice over career? Do you recall what your first day in a recording studio was like? Also, not to be greedy with your time by asking more questions, but while I know you are most well known for your voice over/acting roles, have you ever done anything \"behind the camera\" like writing or directing? You have such a terrific sense of humor and quick wit, that I imagine you'd be able to write some pretty entertaining stuff! All my best, Bradford\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Bradford!\n\nYes, I am looking forward to the summer and it is here. Already I feel things are going too fast. I may take a hiatus from my writings here soon. We will be on the road for a while doing conventions and personal travel and just time off, but will continue working on committed projects. I seem to remember my first voice acting job as the voices of many animals in the original, “Doctor Doolittle.” Rex Harrison as you recall was talking with the animals and the picture called for Mr. Harrison to do voices and the animals to respond. I believe I did both Harrison and the animals where they needed. My first TV commercial VO was for Friskies Dog Food and I remember Ted Knight was the announcer and would soon become a major television and film actor.\n\nI did a comedy album in the 70’s (All Most Sold Out) and co-produced a Television series with my friend and director Gordon Hunt in the 80’s. It was on CBS for 8 weeks and starred Brad Garrett the working title was “Just the Two of Us.” Most of my writing was during my stand-up comedy years in the early 70’s. Great questions Bradford, thank you.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Hey Frank I saw someone mention The Duck Factory in a question and I remember June Foray and Bill Scott were in the Annies episode. By any chance do you have any photos with Bill apart from that one I sent you from 1984?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nAmber!\n\nLOL, yes, the “Duck Factory!” I had forgotten about that project and how much fun it was for Don and all of us…well, we enjoyed Don Messick having an on-camera project, but he told me and as I already knew…movies and TV take for ever compared to voice work, so it was a different process and fun may not be the correct word. As to photos with Bill, I can’t think of any others too bad.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Becky T.\n\nQuestion: Hello Frank! It's a pleasure to speak with you! I'm a HUGE G1 Galvatron kin and cosplay him often. Even got myself a Galvatron bitty bot as my comfort item. I wanted to write and ask if you've ever officiated any weddings or vow renewals? My husband and I are celebrating 10 years of marriage as of June 18, 2022. I'd like to know if there's any way we could get in contact with your agent(s) and see about hiring you to come \"officiate\" our vow renewals in the Salt Lake City area. Even if you're not a licensed officiant, the honor of your presence at our ceremony is highly desired and we're willing to hear what will be needed to do this. We don't need the ceremony to be more than symbolic of our shared passions and ever-growing love for each other. We missed you at Salt Lake Con in 2021, so this is our best way to ask. Thank you for considering this and thank you for sharing your incredible voice with the world! Hail Galvatron! -Becky\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Becky!\n\nFirst let me say congratulations to you!!!! I really appreciate your offer but no I am not at all equipped to handle those types of celebrations. Peter told me he has been asked a couple of times to do similar occasions and I know he feels the same. We are just actors. (smile) I do hope that we get back to Salt Lake again we both really enjoyed the area. This was our first show post Covid. All the best to you Becky and the Decepticons will be with you in spirit!\n\nAll hail Becky!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Stefan M.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank it’s me again! The one that said I have afew movie ideas for transformers and is at university doing Film, television and radio? I just want to say I have done my first year in university and passing things so far! Super happy! Anyways is there a chance I could show you my voice reels on Galvatron as I want to voice him if ever he comes to life in the movies again! The G1 style offcourse. I incorporated Lenard Nimoy in it so I hope it would stay in the G1 side for things? Is there a chance you can tell Peter I said hi! I hope to speak to you in person in future or on galaxy con at some point! Here’s my video I want to share with you https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mBzZ6AoX5xo Feel free to send my other projects! Every time I see megatron on the screen I always point and sa I I have spoke to him!! (Digitally so to speak) ,”This was almost to easy starscream” Thank you once again lord Megatron!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nStefan,\n\nReally great work at school. This is so important getting your education and doing what you love at the same time. I really don’t like to judge other peoples’ work because I am just an actor not the producer or director. I think it is very good for you to think about your characters and develop new characters by incorporating and using voices like Lenard Nimoy this is a great start and you can grow your own sounds and characters from there.\n\nPeter and I are starting to do more road trips so maybe we will be in your area. Until then, congrats on all you are doing!!!\n\nLord Megatron\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Saoirse\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank, it's been a while! I just got a part in a Transformers online project! I'll be playing an Autobot named Nautica! Just wanted to let you know!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nSaoirse,\n\nOf course, I am happy you are doing a “Transformers” project, but it appears you are doing an auto-bot not a decepticon…Hmmmm…oh well, I am happy for you anyway!!! (wink) Hey, nice going I hope you have fun, and I am sure you will do a great job! Go get em!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Paul B.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank! Yes! I recall the your little monkey being the one thing that caught my eye about Raiders. Bronx is probably my favorite of your sound effect roles, though. Well, next to Curious George, who reminds me so much of Orbitty. As a matter of fact, George is one of Skippy's favorite cartoons and I've brought a couple of the series DVDs just for him to enjoy. It comes as no surprise that Bronx was not an easy character to voice! I imagine doing most of the roars and growls were difficult for most of the cast in general, particularly for Marina Sirtis, what with the screeches she had to employ for Demona's voice. Maybe not Keith David so much, though, since his voice seemed so natural for Goliath in all aspects. I did get a kick out of John Rhys-Davies as Macbeth when watching Gargoyles even at the age of 3. I admit, I'm not much of a Trekkie, but I can appreciate what an all-star cast Gargoyles employed. It is truly one of Disney's best original cartoons, next to the 1987 Duck Tales. Music is certainly powerful. Being as I've played piano for almost 20 years, I know that first hand. The background music for cartoons and TV shows has more impact sometimes than even the dialogue, as I discovered not too long ago by listening to soundtracks. It's when the music, which is not intended to be sad stirs up melancholy emotions that it becomes somewhat troubling, as in my case. As we've had other matters to attend to, we still haven't adopted a baby hamster, although my mom is leaning towards naming him Elroy when we do, which will hopefully be soon. Do take care, Frank and may you have an excellent summer as well! Paul\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Paul!\n\nSounds like things are going well for you and thank you for reminding me of the Gargoyles cast and you are right it was a powerhouse of talent and wonderful actors. Disney has put out a lot of great shows over the years.\n\nHope you guys have a great summer; stay healthy and happy and Elroy sounds like a perfect name!\n\nBest, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Max H.\n\nQuestion: Hey Frank my question is out of all your characters you have voiced over the years what is your top 6 favourite to voice?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nOh, my Max! Well, I guess I would have to say: Megatron, Freddy Jones, Dynomutt, Curious George, Slimer, Ralph the Guard…These are all my own creations but other voices I have done and do that are a blast is of course “Scooby Doo” and “Garfield the Cat!”\n\nThanks Max!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Heyyy Frank!! Liverpool was wonderful. Alas Didi was not there as she had been taken ill, but I met Kelly and Nolan and they were AWESOME! I've emailed you some photos. I'm still in college studying acting and I'm doing a show with a local theatre troupe in June then my summer will mainly be consisted of... chilling. Then back to college in September. lol Nolan actually told me that younearly did an episode of Retro Replay with him but it fell through due to Covid. What video game do you think you might have played? Thank you for the well wishes!!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Amber,\n\nNolan is a trip…such a goofy funny and talented guy. I am happy you got to spend time with him. Glad to hear your college days are going in the right direction. School will do you well and getting all the acting training and opportunities to play characters doing readings etc. is invaluable for your on and off camera work, keep it up.\n\nWow, summer is here already!!! Vacation 😊\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Jack H.\n\nQuestion: I was wondering how I could get a signed photo. Best, Jack haffner\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Jack,\n\nThe best way is coming to a signing. We are lining up cities for the 2022 season so check on the “Where’s Frank Page” of this site and see if we are coming to a city near you. Hopefully it will work out and I can get that done for you.\n\nBest wishes, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Halper P.\n\nQuestion: Today: Don Messick life. What if Don Messick was still alive to this day. His commerce and granite became his downfall but at that time (his time) he became a humor act. (with Daws Butler, Heather North, Bob Papenbrook, Scatman Crothers, Jayne Barbera, Nicole Jaffe and Henry Corden) If Don Messick was still alive today (since he was your friend) what do you think he would be doing for himself. You don't have to answer none. Just a humorous curious. -Batman. Also, did Don Messick's family talk about Scoob or New York City at all?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello P Halper!\n\nDon Messick was a giant in our world of voice. He was a master not unlike Daws Butler and Mel Blanc. He created more voices for Hanna/Barbera than anyone else other than Daws Butler that I know. It is so sad that he did not get to see the continued success of Scooby Doo and the films that have been made for the theater…I am sure he would be thrilled. Also, he really enjoyed meeting the public so I can bet that he would have been doing a lot of conventions that were not happening back in the day. I don’t recall Don talking about New York City, but he did mention his days in radio which were extensive and interesting. We all miss Don Messick a great voice actor and good friend.\n\nThank you,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: W. Eric M.\n\nQuestion: Dear Mr. Welker, I am the author of the Galendor Trilogy and am spearheading the production of the audiobook versions. To realize my vision of having each character acted instead of simply narrated, I thought, \"Wouldn't it be neat to have some of my lifelong favorite voice actors read parts?\" This of course seemed insurmountable for a simple farm boy from Kansas, but this is my life's work. As I wrote through the '90's I imagined my character, Princess Jessica, being voiced by MinMei's Rebecca Forstadt from the Robotech series. I looked her up, she still sounds exactly the same, and I was able to hire her. Recently I tracked down Michael Bell whose voice I've grown up with, from Smurfs, Transformers, GI Joe and even the old Parkay commercials! I was able to hire him for my mechanical mastermind named, \"Woody.\" Of the greatest, instantly recognizable voices of the cartoon eras from the 60's through the 80's yours, Peter Cullen's, and Dan Gilvezan's are at the top of my list (sadly way late for Chris Latta, Don Messick and Casey Kasem to name a few). Would you be willing to voice a character from my novels? I pay well, or could donate to a charity of your choosing. Thank you for enriching my life with your craft. W. Eric Myers P.S. D&D Tiamat was one of the first voices I learned to mimic. I too can make that dual-voice \"cave of winds\" sound. I'm not making any money at it though.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Eric,\n\nI think that having your books acted is a great idea. I have often thought that would be a much better way to hear a story. Mike Bell is a perfect choice not only for is acting but reading skills. I know this is not an easy task and it takes a little more that acting skills you really need to have good reading abilities and be able to put in a lot of time. I appreciate you thinking of me but at this time I have commitments and limited time but again I think you are spot on and I wish you great success. Keep the stories coming! Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Miguel F.\n\nQuestion: Bienvenidos, Frank. Let me start by saying that I've been a fan of your voice-over work and was practically raised on Scooby Doo since the '60 version ran reruns everyday on Cartoon Network. But one of my favorite moments was when you played a voice artist in the obscure live-action show, The Duck Factory, starring Jim Carrey and which subsequently features a fellow Hanna Barbera / Scooby Doo voice legend Don Messick rounding up the main cast. What was it like doing that guest spot playing an egotistical ice-hole, working with Jim Carrey and budding heads again with Messick in live action form? Must've been a wild ride especially since it's a venue for you to do live action unlike animation voice-over. Clip for reference: https://youtu.be/-C5QnWr7CCk?t=142\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMiguel,\n\nThank you for the nice words and for sending along this link. I had not seen this and was surprised. This was done a long time ago and I don’t remember it too well. Jim Carrey, I knew a little from the Comedy Store and Don of course I knew well as a co-worker and friend. Also, Teresa Ganzel had a small part in the show. Teresa was a very funny actress and great gal I dated back in the day. Great sense of humor and very pretty lady. We were all hoping this would be a hit. I know Don was over the moon doing both on and off camera at the time. I remember one thing struck me doing this episode is how long it took to shoot my scene. I literally did four voice over jobs before I got to CBS Radford Center where we immediately rehearsed then broke for lunch. When we returned my scene was finally shot at 7:00 pm and I thought to myself what a tremendous waste of time. Again, the process is “snail” bitingly slow. I really do appreciate voice work!!!!!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: Congratulations On Coming Back As Scooby Doo In Scooby Doo And The Mystery Pups Coming Soon On HBO Max Doesn't Grey DeLisle Griffin Return To Reprise Her Role In This As Well?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Tif,\n\nNo, unfortunately both Katie and Grey will not be regulars in this version. I believe they will have three kids playing the pups. Both Matt and I are eagerly waiting for a new season of shows with all of us together again and hoping the studio will find a way. However, this should be a really cute show, but I will miss the gang and of course the Mystery Machine!\n\nFred, I mean Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Ellis P.\n\nQuestion: Hello Frank! My name is Ellis Pagon, and I'm a writer and independent filmmaker with an interest on working on my own animated project - which, in fact, I'm putting together a pitch bible for so I can then pitch it to television companies. Anyways, my question. Whenever I see your name in the credits of something, I always think of Abu the Monkey from Aladdin. And I'd like to ask - do you have a favourite Abu moment? Thank you! Ellis Pagon\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Ellis!\n\nIt is funny that film was one of the first big animation hits in a long time and Disney was thrilled. It really started the ball rolling for them with all the animated features to come. The recordings were few and far between - I think it took just over three years to complete. I recall the first sessions were quite a struggle for me as the reference material was just on pages and still drawings but no dialog. I would just try and create a whole scene from very little. Later when the film started coming in and I could look at ABU in living color was when it was fun, and I could literally fly through the air and create sound and monkey dialog where there wasn’t any. I liked working on the big old sound stage at Disney Burbank with the old “big” RCA microphone, and the legendary “Doc” the sound engineer. We worked solo so I never got to see Scott Weinger or Robin Williams the entire time. I really loved the picture, and it will have a place in my crowded animation heart!\n\nThanks Ellis\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Brian C.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank, my three year old son Graham is a huge fan of Fred Jones. He runs around with his van he's labeled the mystery machine finding clues and setting traps. Thanks for all your great work.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nBrian,\n\nLol, that’s great! Freddy Jones has been growing and doing more over the length of the series and now his character is full blown. I find that we are starting to get a little more space in the conversation. I really do enjoy doing the character after all these years not only because he was the first, but he continues to be fun. He just seems to always have the car keys and is willing to drive!\n\nTell Graham Fred says: “Hold the phone! Is that Graham driving the Mystery Machine?”\n\nBest wishes from Frank and Fred\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: Question What New Characters Do You Hope To Voice In Video Games In 2023 2024 2025 And 2026?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Tiffany,\n\nWell, it appears you are way ahead of me. I can’t see that far into the future, but we do have a couple of “Garfield the Cat” games in the works. I know we have a lot of Scooby Doo projects in the works as well and I am sure Scooby will be in a lot of games. I will keep you posted!\n\nBest as always, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Paul B.\n\nQuestion: Hi there Frank, thank you and yes, we're planning on another little boy hamster next month. Possibly two more. They will never replace Orbitty or Penelope, but no one will and I would never want them to. Orbitty in particular will forever be the apple of my eye. The background music, not just the main theme, composed for The Jetsons is so memorable to me as well and tends to conjure up a lot of memories which lead to tears. I certainly wish I could contact Hanna-Barbera studios directly to tell them my feelings though I suppose that's an impossibility as they're defunct. I suppose as long as I can tell one of their stars how I feel about their particular studio, that works just as well. Those old cartoons will never be surpassed. Lately I've been enjoying your performance as Bronx in Gargoyles, which is was probably the best cartoon Disney ever produced. I had never realized it had such an all-star cast in all respects, from Keith David to you to Bill Faggerbake to Johnathan Frakes and John Rhys-Davies among so many others. Gargoyles taught me about Shakespeare years before I even entered highschool! Do you recall much about your experiences working on Gargoyles? Hope you're doing well and staying safe! My mom sends her warmest regards and I do too! Paul\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nPaul,\n\nI am happy for you…sounds like you will be enjoying even more hamster friends. Yes, music can be very powerful and bring back a lot of memories. Now talk about some old memories - ”Bronx and the Gargoyles!” It was a fun show but a little rough on my voice. I like all the cast and not sure if you knew, but I worked with John Rhys-Davies in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” as the mischievous little monkey. Of course, I didn’t work with him personally but did do the voice of the monkey and reminded him of that when we did Gargoyles.\n\nHave a great summer and best wishes to you all.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Alex M.\n\nQuestion: Hello Frank Welker my man my name is Alex Murphy from Niles Michigan I just want to wish you a very happy Memorial day weekend, what are you doing this long memorial day weekend my man?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Alex,\n\nHope you had a good Memorial Day weekend. I did the usual, nothing special but did lower the flag to half-mast in remembrance and had a nice BBQ. I think it was just like it is supposed to be, felt good to me!\n\nBest wishes Alex\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Laurence M.\n\nQuestion: Hey, Frank, I have been a long time fan, and my friend has been asking questions, like \"did Frank Welker have any siblings or did he not have siblings?\" And so, I wanna ask her question to you, so did you have any siblings growing up or did you not have siblings?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Laurence,\n\nThanks for asking and the answer is yes! I had two brothers growing up and they were both smarter and better looking than me - much to my chagrin. But we are great friends and close and always enjoy being together when we get a chance. I was lucky to have them, but of course I tell them they were lucky to have me! Lol\n\nAll the best, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Marky H.\n\nQuestion: How did Mark Hamill audition for Scooby-Doo? Were you there? Multiple by number of you and Mark Hamill have record sound for Joe Barbera. Was Joe Barbera there with you and Mark Hamill?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMarky,\n\nI don’t believe I was there when Mark auditioned but I have worked with him in studio many times and he is a treat. He always comes with great stories of people, places and things and is a very interesting person. Also, his energy is infectious, and you can’t help but get into his stories a very good storyteller. Yes, we did do a lot of voices for Joh Barbera, and he directed a lot of the earlier shows in the 70’s. I learned a lot from him, and he really gave me my start. I think it is interesting that Mark first started working in voices after his debut in Star Wars. He came in just a voice guy but when Star Wars took off with the sequels, he returned to Scooby not a voice actor but as an on-camera guest star. He loved it all and was of course fantastic in his performance. He is a talented guy who has lived through the vicissitudes of fortune and came out very well indeed.\n\nBest Marky! Frank\n\n_____________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Joseph S.\n\nQuestion: Hi again I’m glad you’re going to be in a new Scooby doo show for 2024 it says on behind the voice actors website when it’s coming. Well anyway I have another question the filmation tom and jerry comedy show did you do most of the characters in that including Tom and jerry? It says on Wikipedia that Lou scheimer did Tom and jerry? But I did read on your page btvas website that you did it. I’m a little confused about who did what on this old show. Well thanks again and take care. Your #1fan, Joey\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Joseph,\n\nYes, we have a new Scooby Doo show called, “Scooby Doo and the mystery Pups.” I will be in the show as Scooby Doo and Matt Lillard will be back as Shaggy.\n\nAs to Tom and Jerry and Filmation, I do remember doing a lot of voices for them, but can’t be sure what all they were. I know I have done both Tom and Jerry in different iterations for different studios in the past. I tried to look online but couldn’t come up with a good source. I will tell you Norm Prescott and Lou Scheimer did do a lot of voices in their shows. Sorry, I wish I could be more specific. I can tell you for sure, I was not in the newest version released theatrically although I was credited for it. Nope, no T&J in recent times.\n\nBest,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Laura W.\n\nQuestion: Frank Welker, hi, I’m Laura, I just had to drop you a line, I have been hearing you and Peter Cullen all of my life on all my favourite cartoons and movies and have even started a collection of DVDs of all my favourites. I just recently got into Transformers and that’s when I started doing research and got to really know who you guys are. But I have to admit, I feel a little different now, I don’t get to travel much out of my own city of Prince George, B.C, Canada so I watch a lot of YouTube videos and I recently found on YouTube the FanX Scooby Doo and Transformers Q/A in Salt Lake. And I was very displeased. First of all I noticed just about everybody if not everybody in the audience was wearing face masks, you, Peter Cullen and the guy interviewing you were not, also, Peter make a joke before sitting down about how “ you’re too close! “ (COVID is not laughing matter, it has killed over a million people in the US alone. Elderly people are the most at risk of complications and death. Why were not wearing masks? Even if you were all tested you could still be carriers, you could give it to Peter or the interviewer or Peter or the interviewer could have given it to you or visa versa, and Peter has grandkids, and I am assuming you do too. . And besides Optimus prime wears one. Optimus prime wears a mask. You were all putting your selfs at risk. I proudly have not left my house maskless for 3 years and I still haven’t stopped. I also avoid crowded places like (well a plague) you and Peter have broken my heart!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Laura,\n\nFirst and foremost, glad to hear that you are doing well. This has been a rough two years on all of us and now hopefully the worst of this pandemic is behind us. When we go out now, we practice a very strict protocol. It’s hard, but during the signing we have plexiglass between us and all of the people in the lines. Different venues have different mask requirements, but we always are separated from people by the required distances recommended by the Health Services. Peter and I have both had all the required and recommended shots and boosts and wear masks most everywhere we are around groups of people or folks not recognized from our own pod. On stage we are a long distance from the audience and because of our pod relationship (bubble) Peter, myself, and our families do not feel it necessary to mask when together. I don’t recall the Q&A, but I think any humor was more of a release and attempt to comfort than any kind of disrespect. I find it sometimes helps to try and look at bad things with humor to help us all get through them. I know I speak for both of us in saying that everyone should do the best they can to help themselves and each other get through these very difficult times. You are in no way offending us in expressing your concern and feelings.\n\nYou stay safe and healthy Laura,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Jacob L.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank,It's nice to write to you. I'm from Australia and i have autism. I've been a fan of the scooby do franchise since I was a kid so thanks for making my childhood great. I want to ask a few questions. What did you think of neil fanning doing scooby doo when he did the scooby doo movies? What tips can you give to me in becoming a voice over artist? I'm working to become a voice over artist and I want to move from Australia to America and voice cartoon and animated characters. But I don't know where to start. Any tips would be great. And when can you come over to Australia to meet the fans? We have Supanova and Oz comic con. And it would be awesome to meet you. Thank you Frank. Jacob\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nWell Jacob, let’s see if I can answer some of your questions:\n\nI thought Neil Fanning did a good job on Scooby and his interpretation was unique. After over two decades of doing Scooby and hearing myself, of course, that is the Scooby that I hear, and feel is best representative of what the original sounded like. Neil was working with a director who I am sure heard it a little different and directed Neil to sound and interpret who he (the director) felt Scooby should sound and act like. It is tough when you are not the character because again the director is pushing you in his direction. Since I am Scooby, the directors let me push or dictate the direction the character is going - much easier than what Neil was facing.\n\nAs to becoming a voice actor, that is something that is very difficult to say. You need to have a very wide range of voices or an incredibly unique voice that is different and will stand out as a character. I would suggest studying in school by doing plays and reading as much and many plays as you can and do the voices of all the characters in the plays. This will help build your repertory and also help your readings for auditions. Remember voice work is acting first so you need to know how to interpret lines and follow direction and school will help you with that. Google the competition; Mark Hamill, Jess Harnell, Rob Paulsen, Billy West…see what they are up to and listen to their voices. Can you match or compete with them? These are things you must consider. Also, take a look at Steve Blum’s webpage he is a great voice teacher.\n\nWe would love to come to Australia!\n\nHope I was able to answer in part at least some of your questions.\n\nBest of luck Jacob!\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Nicci P.\n\nQuestion: Hello Mr Welker I notice you’re visiting Scotland in October. Are you coming to England too please? Thank you Nicci\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Nicci!\n\nWe were talking with the promoter about doing just that but unfortunately both Peter and I have feature films we are working on and we need to be back state side to finish up production. I know there is plans to have us back and hopefully we can get time to tour Europe and of course spend time in England!\n\nThank you Nicci!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Joe G.\n\nQuestion: Dear Mr Welker, I’ve been a huge Scooby Doo fan my whole life. I’ve found myself growing up along side Scooby doo and my love for the show is ever growing! I’ve watched every single Scooby doo movie and I was wondering, which is your favourite animated Scooby film? Mine is camp scare. I really hope I will one day be able to meet you. Thank you for everything! I look forward to your future projects! Scooby-dooby-doo!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nYou know Joe I get asked that a lot and of course my standard answer is there is just so many to choose from, but crazy as it seems, I liked “Chill Out Scooby Doo,” also “Scooby Doo and Kiss a Rock and Roll Mystery” again as I say, too many to choose from…LOL. We are scheduling more outings so check and see if we will be in your area. New projects coming, “Scooby Doo and the Mystery Pups, and the sequel to “Scoob!”\n\nThank you and Scoobyyyyy Dooobie Doooo to you too Roeeeee!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Daniel B.\n\nQuestion: Hey, Frank Welker. You have been the voice of Fred Jones since his debut in 1969. Do you remember the order in which all 25 episodes of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? aired. For example, which episode came first after What a Night for a Knight? A Clue for Scooby-Doo or Hassle in the Castle?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nOh my Daniel, I am afraid I couldn’t even guess at this point. After 53 years of episodes, movies, and games etc. I honestly don’t know. It was fun to see some of those titles and how the writers would make them rhyme. I have been thinking of going back and watching those originals one day. Thank you for the question and I am happy that you know our beginnings after all these years!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Bryson R.\n\nQuestion: do you like grey\n\nFrom Frank: Yes!\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Laurence M.\n\nQuestion: Hello, Frank Welker. I would like to thank you for voicing my friend's favorite decepticon Megatron and my favorite Decepticon Skywarp. I have been thinking about this question. How did you get to do these 2 characters' voices? Like what inspired you to do these 2 characters' voices perfectly. My friend has been thinking of this 1 question, do you have any siblings, or are you an only child?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Laurence,\n\nWhen it came to picking Decepticons, I just tried to audition for as many as I could and wound up getting a few for sure. We had drawings in front of us so we just looked at those characters and what came out was pretty much what they got. The auditions went to Hasbro and they selected the actors they heard that worked for the characters as they saw them…again, I was fortunate to audition for a lot and managed to land a few as well.\n\nAs to siblings, yes. I have two older brothers.\n\nAll the best,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Michael H.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank, You are one of my favorite voice actors ever since Scooby Doo!, I've been wondering, What is your favorite Fred Jones and Scooby Doo moment?, Also, your voice work as Fred Jones is really great!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Michael,\n\nThank you I appreciate the good words. You know “Scooby Doo” was my first cartoon show so it will always be special. Also, since we have been doing the show for 53 years and are still going…well, that is a lot of episodes, movies, specials, games etc. so it is really hard for me to pick just one. I can say the evolution and growth (thanks to the writers) of the characters has made some of the later iterations different and interesting which does make for fun for all of us in the cast. We will be starting the latest version, “Scooby Doo and the Mystery Pups” very soon and finishing up the sequel to “Scoob,” Scooby’s “Holiday Haunt” this summer so lots of new memories to make.\n\nThanks again Michael!\n\nScooby, Freddy and Frank\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Teague P.\n\nQuestion: Hey Frank, do you have any interesting stories when you were working with Steve Spielberg on shows like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs or movies that he directed or produced like Gremlins?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Teague,\n\nI am told that when we did “Raiders of the Lost Ark” the sound editor recorded some of my adlibs while we were recording the monkey. John Rees Davies was in the scene, and I would put words in his mouth that of course he wasn’t saying in the film. Some of these scenes were taken to Steven’s house and played as a surprise joke and again it is rumored that he was very amused. You can see one of these outtakes on YouTube. I used to do this in my stand-up act. I would take a TV on stage turn it on and no matter what was showing, make up dialog and fit it into the scene. I did this for a Television show “Keep on Cruising” Steven Bishop show also on YouTube.\n\nBest Teague,\n\nFrank\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Are you in the new MultiVersus game? Scooby Doo has been found in the data files. Hope they bring in Fred Jones too! Also what was it like to work with Mindy Cohn when she voiced Velma? :D\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nAmber, I am afraid you got me on this one. I am not familiar with MultiVersus game. So can’t answer that one…If I were to guess I would say probably not.\n\nMindy was a seasoned pro from the on-camera side and did a very good Velma sound alike. I enjoyed listening to her stories and of all the people she knew, and her trips abroad etc. Still remarkable how much she sounded like Nicole David and had her phrasing as well.\n\nBest, Frank\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Oliver M.\n\nQuestion: Dear Mr. Welker, i have write you a fan mail because of Autograph from you to the TMGD Talent Agency but i think this Adress was wrong because i get me fan letter back.

Best whises her Fan Oliver\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Oliver,\n\nSorry, but this is one of the reasons I don’t do autographs or items by the mail personally or through the agency…things get lost and messed up a lot, so I just don’t do it. Maybe we will be at a signing in your city this year. Thanks for being a fan!\n\nFrank\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Chloe H.\n\nQuestion: Howdy! My friend and I recently went down the rabbit hole and are in awe of your years of work in some of our favorite cartoons for years (As far as we know you are playing yourself in flintstones hehe). In all seriousness, it truly is impressive how long you have been doing voices and how many of my favorite characters you have voiced. The only thing I can think of asking is if you have any notable memorabilia related to any of your work?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Chloe,\n\nWell, I have some things the studios and fans have given me. I have my original Megatron (in the box) P38, some cells from some of the old shows and a few scripts and signed posters…but I guess I would have to say not a lot of memorabilia. I know some actors that have rooms and rooms full of stuff. Wally Wingert has an incredible collection of industry treasures.\n\nBest to you Chloe!\n\nFrank\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Byron W.\n\nQuestion: I love your work sir, your range is amazing...any time you can go from Megatron to Uni...respect!

My podcast is also available on all audio platforms. Here is a sample interview: https://youtu.be/BLWYynEC4FY Here is my IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12597724/ I hope you will join me.

Peter Pan Roger Rabbit Baloo Is All In The Movie Too.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nRiley,\n\nWow, you really do watch a lot of Television and see a lot of movies. I think if you stopped watching the ratings on these shows would drop!!! Hope you are doing well, and you get a chance to read some stories too.\n\nBest to you Riley,\n\nFrank\n\n__________________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Christian B\n\nQuestion: Hi Mr. Welker, Last year, I got to virtually meet you and Mr. Cullen, and I was trying not to explode. I hope to get the opportunity to meet you at a convention someday. If you could return to voice almost every character you portrayed in G1 in a movie, would you be interested?\n\nHi Mr. Welker, I’m curious, who was more fun to have as second-in-command, Chris Latta as Starscream or Roger C. Carmel as Cyclonus ?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Christian,\n\nGlad we got to say hi virtually. It was clever of these guys to put together this technology to be able to at least make appearances via computers during covid. We are doing conventions in 2022. You know I would love to do a G1 animated movie and with as many of the old characters and cast as possible. I think it would be great and everyone would love doing it. I guess we can only hope Hasbro thinks the same way…fingers crossed.\n\nI really enjoyed both characters and both actors who brought them to life. They were such distinct and interesting actors. As human beings, they were larger than life…Roger, physical and emotional large and Chris physically large and his voice talent was spectacular. Both Chris and Roger had an amazing presence and brought so much to Transformers! Starscream was a constant pain in Megatron’s side and had to always be carefully watched…\n\nBest wishes,\n\nMegs\n\n__________________\n\nFan Name: Elizabeth F.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank! First off, I just wanna say hi. Hi! When I learned about your career many years back. I watched a YouTube video when you were in One Saturday Morning commercial segment Manny the Uncanny in 1997/1998. Manny (played by the hilarious Paul Rugg) interviewed you at the Los Angeles Zoo. You imitated some of the zoo animals. My favorite was your monkey impressions at the monkey habitat, and some of them answered back. That was my favorite part of the video. I heard that Curious George had just finished after 16 years! That's a record. I love you and the cast, Jeff Bennett, Kath Soucie, Jim Cummings, Rico Romano, E.G. Daily, etc... Have a fantabulous day! Elizabeth\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Elizabeth,\n\nI can’t agree with you more, Paul Rugg is a very talented and funny man. He writes a lot of the shows I do and appears as guest stars as well. I so enjoy working with him, he makes me laugh and he is really fun to watch. I don’t know how he has missed out on becoming a huge star.\n\n​\n\n“George” has been an amazing show and you listed the cast that makes it a joy and such a cute show (he says with great modesty). Jeff Bennett is another one of those actors who in my opinion can do anything…so versatile. Side note, Jeff and Rob Paulsen have this uncanny ability to tell jokes and goof off while the director is talking over the talkback giving us all directions and they still are able to understand what’s said and hit their cue’s perfectly as the director says role! Amazing!!!\n\nCuriously yours,\n\nFrank\n\n__________________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Brandon B.\n\nQuestion: Megatron Gaming.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nBrandon,\n\nI am not too sure what your question is about gaming but yes, we have done several Transformers games and videos. They are usually quite intense recordings as we are required to do a lot of sounds beside our dialog; hits, falls, running, lots of battle sounds etc. Also, I still remember fondly doing the Universal ride and dialog for the roaming robots on the lot. I know that is not Gaming, but in the vicinity! Best wishes and good luck in the “Games!”\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Robert J.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank! My name is Robert Jackson. I do a podcast called Station Square, interviewing some of the top voice actors in the business. I've been a longtime fan of your work, and I would love to invite you on the show to discuss about your career, fun hobbies you've been up to during the pandemic, and we can even discuss about life and where the future holds for the industry. Thank you for all your hard work! Sincerely, Robert\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Robert!\n\nSounds like you are having a good time with “Station Square!” Nice to have these outlets for getting good information and entertainment. Currently I am not doing any podcasts but will definitely keep you in mind. All the best to you and the “Square.”\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Frank! I do cook sometimes, its more sweet treats though like cupcakes or cookies/biscuits. I made a whole cheesecake once! Do you remember working on Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker as Woof and Ace? I met Kevin Conroy and Will Friedle back in April and they were SUPER lovely!! Will told me a lot about you and how much he admires you. It’s made me want to watch all the Batman cartoons now!! I think by the time you’ve answered this, I will have been to Comic Con Liverpool (21st-22nd May) and met Didi Conn (Fonz and the Happy Days Gang), Kelly Ward (the voice director who you work with regularly) and Nolan North (your golfing buddy!) who I’m doing a special piece of artwork for, based on his friendship with you. Super excited! See you in October!!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nOf course, Amber…BUSY, busy, busy! Looks like you never stop, and your list of acquaintances just keeps growing. Cooking, acting, writing etc. it is very good for you to keep busy and stay creative. Remember school and your studies and reading lots!!! Kelly is quite a student of the theater, actor-writer-director does a lot for Disney as you probably know. Nolan is a very funny guy and a really good golfer…I am jealous! Hail Batman!\n\nEnjoy your summer, Amber!\n\nFrom the colonies, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: George Z.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank Welker, my name is George I have autism and I'm the fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movies. From, George P.S. Could you do the voice of Tokka, and Rahzar, please?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi George!\n\nI would be more than happy to do those voices. I have done them a couple of times, but I must wait for them to be included in a Turtles project and then hope the studio will give me that opportunity again. Fingers crossed.\n\nGo Turtles…\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Paul B.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank and thanks for the kind words. It really means a lot to me that you were at least able to receive a photo of Orbitty. I would often show her your autograph. She was cremated and I'm doing better, though I have moments where the grief comes back like a tidal wave. I wrote that message to you when I was beside myself so apologies for any spelling errors or rambling I did. You are quite literally my hero, at the age of 33, just for being you. Being the Man of a Million Voices is an added bonus. My mom's service dog (I take care of my mom as my father is no longer with us) Skippy enjoys Scooby-Doo daily, as does my mom as you are both around the same age. She grew up on \"Scooby Doo Where Are You?\". She enjoys the episodes of \"What's New Scooby Doo\" that feature the Secret Six. Aside from you, though, it's not the same without Casey Kasem, Stefanianna Christopher son, Heather North, and Nicole Jaffe. Somehow it seems that watching anything that you do, especially Hanna-Barbera, reminds me of Orbitty the hamster. My mom wants to adopt another hamster (a little boy this time) and is considering Elroy for a name, although it will take some time for me to come to terms with this. I wish there was a way to reach out to Hanna-Barbera studios still to tell them directly how much I appreciate those cartoons, which to me, are timeless and visions of a better America that I was born too late to see, but I understand that there's no way outside of possibly contacting Cartoon Network or perhaps even Warner Brothers, as the studio appears to be defunct? I'd even write or phone in to Hanna Barbera's children or heirs to tell them how much I appreciate their creations. There are too many of them to mention in one message letter/message/call. Take care, Frank\n\n​\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Paul,\n\nI know you are still dealing with your loss and it does take time, but you are doing well and having the responsibility of caring for your mother is a good purpose and helpful focus. I am glad Skippy is there for both of you and I do think when you can do it getting another pet for you could be very comforting. Also, thank you for your kind words about Hanna Barbera I know they all would appreciate knowing your feelings.\n\nStay strong and best to you,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Michael H.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank, I'm Michael Holloway from South Australia, and I am a HUGE fan of the world of animation. One of my favourite characters of yours is Fred in the Scooby Doo franchise, I always found him to be brave and heroic, and sometimes hilariously funny (in a good way). Fred was one of my heroes growing up and I'm still a huge fan. Camp Scare is one of my favourites, I love Fred's mentor role. We all need a Fred in our lives. I haven't heard of any new Scooby's since the one with Courage The Cowardly Dog. I hope you will be doing more Scooby movies soon. You rock as Scooby too of course! I love your other roles too! Best Wishes, Michael\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Michael!\n\nThanks for all the nice Fred compliments…he doesn’t always get the best of press I guess because he is kind of just a regular guy. Well, that isn’t completely true because as time went by in later episodes the writers had a lot of fun giving him a lot more depth and funny attributes. But yes, we are doing more “Scooby!” There is a new series in the works don’t have the title but looks to be about 40 shows. Also, coming in 2023 is the sequel to “Scoob” so get your Scooby snacks ready…the dog is back!\n\nBest, Frank\n\nPS: The new series may be quite different…don’t know all the details just yet.\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: In My Free Time I've Watched Perry Mason The Rifleman Lost In Space My Three Sons Toon In With Me Happy Days Plus Svengoolie And The Brady Bunch Beautiful Tribute He Did About Gilbert Gottfried Interviewing Him At A Convention And When He Was A Guest On His Show.

If not, I'm sorry to bother you about this. MY Parents are celebrating their 50th Anniversary. We would like to see if Mr. Welker would recognize their wedding. A letter or photo would be a big help. Anything can do would be a big help. Hope to hear from you soon. Big Curious george fans Thanks John Blum\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMr. and Mrs. Blum.\n\nCongratulations and best wishes on this great occasion of celebrating 50 years of marriage. I remember my parents 50th and it was a glorious event that all the family and their many friends enjoyed with them. Here is to many more years of health and happiness.\n\n50 years, wow. “Curious George” says…have a beautiful yellow day and congrats!\n\nThank you, John!\n\nBest wishes Frank Welker\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Catherine D.\n\nQuestion: Hello Mr. Welker. I'm writing on behalf of my husband. He is an enormous Transformers fan and talks about you and Mr. Cullen constantly. Could you please confirm that the event dates on your Where's Frank page are in stone? We don't have a ton of money, so I need to start organizing finances for flights and hotels now to make sure I can get him there to meet you. It's been his dream since he was a kid, so I want to do everything possible to get him on that plane! Any information you could give me would be an amazing help. Thank you for your time!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Catherine,\n\nOh my, I would hate for anything to go wrong, but yes the dates we have on the page are firm. As with any event, there can always be unforeseen happenings like Covid out breaks but as far as we are concerned everything is a go. Hope to see you guys there and thank you for wanting to be part of it.\n\nFingers crossed and best to you guys!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Alvaro M.\n\nQuestion: Dear Mr. Welker, I hope all is well. My name is Álvaro Martínez, and I am a recent graduate planning to enter the audio industry. I have done a number of interviews which my guests have greatly enjoyed. Gary K. Wolf (Who Censored Roger Rabbit?), Anthony Leggett (Physics Nobel Prize) and Alvy Ray Smith (Pixar Co-founder) are some examples. Would you be interested in doing a Zoom interview? I would love to learn about your life and work. If you are interested, here is the link to my portfolio: https://www.alvarojmartinez.com/Gratefully, Álvaro Martínez\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey Alvaro,\n\nFirst and foremost, congrats on getting the education completed. That is a great accomplishment that will serve you well. Also, it appears you are well on your way with some outstanding guests and interviews. I am currently not doing Zooms or podcasts but appreciate the offer.

It is certainly out there and makes me think it may have been a take off and not a real bumper, but I could be wrong. It is unusual alright - I know the writers started expanding all of our characters in the later shows and this could have been part of that expansion. Too funny, thanks for finding that and sending it along.\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Ian E.\n\nQuestion: If they ever decide to reboot Josie and the Pussycats, would you be playing Alan, Sebastian, or both? Which role would you be interested in from that show?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Ian! Now that is a good question. Of course, I would be happy to play either Alan or Sebastian, but the studio would have some very specific ideas about who they wanted to play what roles. Usually, when a lot of time has gone by, the new creative team wants to put their own stamp on the project and that would include casting. Sometimes they prefer different actors…I am not sure why but it happens. Also, you will see a lot of celebrity casting if the show becomes a feature or prime time event so they may wish to ask on camera actors to be in the cast. Bottom line I really don’t know but if asked to serve I would certainly consider.\n\nThanks Ian\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Briseida G.\n\nQuestion: Hiya Frank! I was wondering if you would be open to creating a short voice message for my partner? He’s a big fan of your work and has been showing me the world of animation and voice acting in-depth, so I would like to gift him a message from you on our anniversary next year, April 3, 2023. Nowadays, we often find ourselves talking about films and actors way past midnight, whether it’s me geeking out about Fred Jones, Wes Anderson, or Sheen from Jimmy Neutron (who he absolutely hates but I absolutely love) — or him raving about Indiana Jones, Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc., and… well… huh… I seem to be drawing a blank… must be the lack of sleep! Or the fact that our conversations always seem to lead back to one of the two topics, haha. Even so, I absolutely enjoy our time together and I always learn something new from him. So, please let me know if my request is in any way possible, or if you know anyone else who may be open to such an idea! Many thanks, Briseida\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nBriseida,\n\nSounds like you have a lot of fun planned for the anniversary. There are sites online you can find that have all kinds of folks that do messaging from the entertainment field to sports stars so you should have no trouble finding great choices. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to any of these franchises but believe me there are much bigger names than me and happy to accommodate your request.\n\nBest of luck and happy anniversary!\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Billy B.\n\nQuestion: Dear Frank, I found out you were the voice of the Joker in Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, and you were pretty good. Mark Hamill is the go-to voice for the Joker, but he said it has put a strain on his voice, so he might retire from the role. People would really like you to voice the Joker again and imitate Mark, because you could become his successor if he retires. Your fans would appreciate it if you voice the Joker again and imitate Mark Hamill, because everyone loves his Joker voice, and you could sound exactly like him. Please respond patbarber@hotmail.com at your earliest convenience. I eagerly wait for your reply.\n\nBob Hastings was the most popular voice for Commissioner James Gordon, but he’s deceased. People would really like you to voice this character sometime, because you could imitate Bob and become one of his successors. Fans would appreciate it if you would voice James Gordon in the very near future, because a lot of people liked Bob Hastings as the voice of the character, and you could sound exactly like him. Please respond to patbarber@hotmail.com at your earliest convenience. I eagerly wait for your reply. Sincerely, Billy Barberich\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Billy,\n\nYes, the Joker character has been tossed around to several of us over the years and most recently Mark Hamill. I think he does a great job, but of course, being a fellow competitor, I would have to believe (if given the chance) I would do it again and try and do it better than my friend Mark (haha) But alas, Mark does a superb job, and the public identifies him with\n\nJoker and I doubt he will be giving up the Joker anytime soon and I hope he doesn’t! Bob Hastings was a nice man who I worked with also and had great respect for…but to be honest, I don’t recall his voice for Commissioner Gordon, but all of his work was quite good, and he played a lot of policemen, mayors, governors and the like. In general, I don’t like taking over characters that someone else has created unless they don’t want or can no longer do them. But the best way is to be the creator of the voice in the first place then the character has your soul and DNA.\n\nAll the Best Billy, Frank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: GT\n\nQuestion: Frank! I appreciate you using this site to answer our questions. Throughout the years and listening to your work, I always had questions to ask you if I could so thanks for allowing us to do that! I hope this question makes sense. One thing I wondered is sometimes, you'll see a voice actor credited with just doing a couple of lines in a show, or you might see something like \"additional voices\", or just a credit for animal sounds. In cases where you have such small roles, are you under a contract to perform many small roles for that show over the course of its production? Or do you have a contract with a production company for multiple shows they produce? Or is it a case where you are being paid solely for that one small role? I'm certain it varies but what's the norm in situations like that? Thanks!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi GT,\n\nThank you. I am glad you like the site and I enjoy the opportunity to answer questions about the biz.\n\nYes, there are many ways that your agent can structure deals with the production company but mostly in the voice world you work on a daily contract set to rules made by SAG/AFTRA. There is one daily rate for a four-hour period of recording and in the four hours for one rate you can be required to perform 2 voices and an additional sum for a third voice. It doesn't matter how small the role is, or whether it is human or animal each voice or line or words and utterances are considered one voice in this formula. So, lets say I do a young boy’s voice and one bark as his dog, that would constitute two characters and if they said can you also do the cat…that would require an additional payment. There is an exception, if you are doing a role and there is walla (crowds of people or animals etc.) you can be asked to supply group sound with no extra compensation. This area is a little gray, but most actors are happy to do this and occasionally help out with minor additions to help the producers.\n\nA lot of times, especially in the past I have done vocal effects for an animal or human but the producers don’t want the audience to know it was an actor doing the sound or voice so we will just get “Special Vocal Effects” by credit. That helps you prove you were in the production but allow for anonymity of the source. Hope this helps answer your question.\n\nAll the best,\n\nSpecial Vocal Effects by…Frank Welker\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Preston S.\n\nQuestion: Rememberance: How was Casey Kasem in 2008. Did you meet with him varied? How was his friendship and humor competing? Thanks!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHello Preston,\n\nI can say through out the years Casey was always a stand-up guy who enjoyed and took seriously his work. He was always wanting to do more voices and was very protective of the Shaggy character. He would discuss with the new writers what Shaggy would say and how he would approach a certain situation it was pretty amazing to see how he did this and it was strictly for his concern to keep Shaggy as he saw him. Now that being said, he was a joy to work with and such a gentleman. He was very thoughtful and respectful for the women in the cast and guest actors and the crew. He was fun to joke around with and liked my goofy joke and impressions. Sometimes he would blurt out in the middle the session right after I did a giant roar and say, “how the heck do you do that, doesn’t that hurt?”\n\nHe would recommend me for jobs all the time…I would go on an audition and they would say Casey Kasem recommended you. Casey was a good guy, and one of a kind…I miss him, he has left us way too soon.\n\nBest to you Preston,\n\nFrank\n\n_____________\n\nFan Name: Jessi Ann W.\n\nQuestion: When movie world in Australia did the monsters for the spooky castle the next generation ride did you go inside a recording studio to record the spooky demon effects for both versions of the ride the original one was in 2002 and the next generation one was back in 2018 I’m just wondering\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Jessi Ann,\n\nI don’t remember working on that project. Sorry, but I do a lot of these kinds of things but not familiar with the “Spooky Castle.” Did you see me credited for doing work…also; sometimes I do get credit when it belongs to someone else. Hope the ride is a good one regardless.\n\nBest,\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Teague P.\n\nQuestion: Hello Frank, what’s your favorite celebrity impressions that you have done over the years (personal favorite is your Steven Spielberg impression)?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nTeague!\n\nHahaha…My Steven Spielberg impression is one of my least favorites as I feel I don’t do a very good job but I do appreciate your comments. I always loved doing Gregory Peck, Shaun Connery, Bill Cosby, George C. Scott, Walter Cronkite, and more recently Obama, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. I have thought about putting some impressions on this site for fun.\n\nBest to you Teague.\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Todd W.\n\nQuestion: Hey Frank , My four sons and I host The Wonderful World of Disney Plus fan/family podcast.

We'd love to get your perspective and your magic making skills. I know you're a busy...man, frog, dog, and horse. If not, that's OK. Just know you've got a whole family of fans in Northern, IN.

I've been admiring your work as well with Peter Cullen, and it's amazing how much talent you have for voicing characters like Scooby, Garfield, Totoro, Megatron, etc. I understand that this is a long shot, but is it possible to come to the Fanx convention again this year? I would prefer to go to my first convention to see you, but unfortunately, the moment I heard that you were at Fanx, I was so excited, but I found out a day later when the convention ended, but I'm not sure if it's a one-time thing. Thank you and have a great day. Best, Melissa C.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nMelissa,\n\nSounds like we literally just missed you. I think that may have been our first event back or certainly one of the first and we really enjoyed Salt Lake. I think they have a policy or general rule to have different every year. So we could come back next year but not really sure. You can always write Fanx and put in a request as they do listen to what fans like and who they want to see. At any rate, look forward to meeting you and hope it is soon, the folks in Salt Lake are really nice people.\n\nBest wishes Melissa, Frank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Tiffany R.\n\nQuestion: Not Only Did I See Sonic The Hedgehog 2 At AMC Theatres I Also Saw The Bad Guys Movie Too.

My parents obviously raised me on some of the classics haha. You are so good at what you do, and you’ve inspired me to want to do vocal work when I’m older. I’m 17 right now, and I’ve been told I’m good at impressions and coming up with voices out of thin air. Vocal work just seems like a perfect fit for me, I think! My girlfriend and I are thinking of going as Fred and Daphne for Halloween this year, and I’ll be thinking of you as I go around doing my Fred impression! On top of TV stuff, I’ve also appreciated your video game work. Especially you as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in Epic Mickey. I played the heck out of that game and loved every minute of it, just hearing your wonderful voice for Oswald. Stay awesome, Frank. Have a wonderful day!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Jake!\n\nThank you for the nice note…and thank your parents for introducing us!!! As to your possible future doing voice work, I will tell you, it sounds like you are on the right track. That is exactly how I started. As far back as I can remember, I was doing animal sounds, goofy noises, voices, and yes impressions. Couldn’t help it and people seemed to enjoy it so I kept it up.\n\nI wish we would do more Oswald product, but the studio seems to be a little unsure what to do with Oswald.\n\nHey, going as Fred and Daphne for Halloween sounds like fun. You guys have a great time and be careful driving if you take the mystery machine!\n\nAll the best to you Jake,\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Brian F.\n\nQuestion: Hello Mr. Welker I'm just wondering how you got to be into the voice acting business because I would really like to give it a try and you have always been a big inspiration too me. My question is how do you be successful in voicing something or someone else?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nBrian,\n\nAs you can imagine I get asked this question quite often. It really, for me and most actors, starts when you are young. There is a very strong desire to perform. As for voices, I recall being able to mimic animals and having the ability to impersonate from a very early age. This was something that I was born with call it talent or an aberration but I did little in the way of study it was just natural. For those who want to be actors or voice actors there is of course study. That would be reading, getting into the theater (doing plays and readings) local or professional and participate in as much acting as possible. There are many classes, but I would recommend college programs and theater first. Steve Blum, my friend, and superb voice actor has a webpage with some interesting insights into “voice acting.” For vocal sounds anything by Fred Neuman but specifically “Mouth Sounds.”\n\nIt is a very hard business to get into but if you make it, it is fun and can be rewarding.\n\nGood luck Brian!\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Kera S.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank!

Looking forward to your answer.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nLindsey,\n\nBecause of my respect for Maurice (at any size or number) I would think I would have to be very clever and careful. I would do everything in my power to avoid the confrontation then I would recruit Rob Paulsen to be my warrior. I am sure once Maurice saw Rob, he would get into a conversation and begin laughing so hard he would forget about being a duck as well as me entirely and we would all go out for sushi!!!\n\nMakes perfect sense to me!!!\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: M\n\nQuestion: Hey, I have a question from my entire family actually, as of May 7,2022 are you in NC?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHey M, presently NC is not on the schedule but we are adding dates all the time so keep an eye on the, “Where is Frank” page and hopefully we will make that happen one day soon.\n\nThank you M,\n\nF\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Zac G\n\nQuestion: I’m such a huge fan of the Garfield show , I loved you as Garfield in the Garfield show .what was it like working on the show , I got a autograph from you from galaxycon of Garfield from the Garfield show take care and stay safe!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Zac,\n\nNice to hear from you and I am glad we were able to make that work out. Garfield was so much fun to work on because of a great cast and super director Mark Evanier. Also, from the get go, Jim Davis our esteemed leader and creator always was supportive and enthusiastic which made the show fun to do. My friends in the cast were/are funny and very good actors all so it made going to work a joy. Having a show like Garfield was a pleasure indeed. I hope we do more in the future.\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: Dove P.\n\nQuestion: Hello there, Frank. Apologies if this is a strange question, I was going to just send an email but couldn't find one and given this was the only was I could contact you, it made the most sense to send it this way. A thought crossed my mind recently and that was how exactly you voicing characters you've previously played in things such as you playing Fred in that one Family Guy bit works. Like, what's the legality of all that and how possible would it be for you to say play Fred for a Youtube video? Sorry if that's an oddly specific question but I felt it couldn't hurt to ask given \"you miss all the shots you don't take\" and what not.\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Dove,\n\nYour question is fine and a good one. There is no real legal problem with doing the voice of Fred as guest appearances on other shows etc. The only time it is problematic is if it is product and someone has asked me to do the voice for that product, then it must be approved by Warner Brothers and usually the studio would charge a license fee and my agent would negotiate a performance fee. As to doing Family Guy, no problem, but since it is a performance, the Screen Actors Guild requires a minimum acting fee and or the agent of record, in my case my agent would negotiate a performance fee.\n\nBest, Frank aka Freddy\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Paul B.\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank, I wrote to you late last month or earlier this month and was quite happy, but that has changed because two days ago, your little namesake, my baby hamster Orbitty (whom I sent you a photo of) developed an upper respiratory infection and passed away. I've been beside myself with grief and thinking of you and your Orbitty ever since. I can't go one day without crying my eyes out and everytime I see your autograph on my wall, I thank heaven that you're still here as that brings me comfort, knowing that you keep The Jetsons alive. As I think I previously stated, I wish your Orbitty received more screen time and was heavily featured in Season 3 aside from the cameo of you sleeping beside Elroy. I would sometimes call myself Elroy when talking to little Orbitty. I would always hear your voice as Orbitty replying back to me. She was the closest thing I had to a daughter and the closest I will ever come to having your Orbitty for a child, as had been my dream since I was very little. I miss her kisses and I miss her cuddles. I fear watching The Jetsons and eating popcorn will now be impossible for me because that was her favorite food (unsalted and unbuttered, of course) as well as her favorite cartoon. It's as if my whole world has come crashing down. Your Orbitty helped me so much in recent years in many ways. I wish I had my little Orbitty back. Perhaps you'll be able to bring back your Orbitty as a character. I'd enjoy seeing a cartoon that is entirely based on Orbitty. It might help me to feel happy again. Thank you so much for voicing that little Orbitty. I dearly miss all of your co-stars from Daws Butler to George O'Hanlon and June Foray to Janet Waldo and the whole cast. My deepest regret is not being able to tell them how much I appreciate them myself. Please stay safe and take care. It helps me to get by knowing that Orbitty (Craterus Orbittus) is still around. Sincerely, Orbitty's Number One Fan, Paul\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Paul,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about Orbitty. Our pets mean so much to us and it is always difficult and so sad to lose them. I will tell you, what many people do when they lose a pet is to get another one. It of course will never be the same, but can be an entirely new beginning of a great friendship. Thank you for being so loyal I know all the actors you mentioned above would have appreciated your kind thoughts.\n\nHang in there Paul and all the best to you.\n\nFrank\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: What's your favourite cereal too? :D\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nAmber, it appears you may also have becoming a chef or food provider in your future. Hah! My favorite cereal is probably not really accurate. I like Gram crackers and milk. Next would be Kellogg’s corn flakes, Cheerios, Raisin Bran, Grape nuts, and good old-fashioned oatmeal.\n\nI sometimes mix a bowl of all the cereals above for a special treat!!!\n\nNow I’m hungry again!\n\nFrank\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Chad W.\n\nQuestion: Did Stefanianna Christopherson do her own sound effects? Do you know if Stefanianna Christopherson did her own sound effects?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Chad,\n\nIn full disclosure I honestly do not know, but I think I remember her pretty much just reading her own lines. When we first started, we didn’t do much of anything extraordinary we were all just concentrating on reading our lines. Of course, as we got bolder and more confident, we did start doing more. I think I was making noises early on because I had done them all my life, so it was natural. Everyone else except Don Messick (the master) just read lines in the early days.\n\nBest wishes Banner!\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Youngstown S.\n\nQuestion: Do you miss John Hughes?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nYS,\n\nI really did not know John Hughes personally, so I can only say that professionally I admired how he found a nitch and was able to capture a time and sense of youth in his films. He was very adroit at this, and I enjoyed his work. It seems we lost him way too early, and he had a lot more to say through his work to come.\n\nBest to you,\n\nFrank\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Eddie\n\nQuestion: Is there a certain voice or impression that you struggle with? In other words, do you have a voice acting \"white whale\" (for lack of a better phrase) or at least have had one in the past?\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nHi Eddie!\n\nI think of Gregory Peck “The Great White Apotheosis.” Mr. Peck was one of my better impersonations come to think of it. Always enjoyed doing that one - but I digress. Probably wasn’t so much not being able to do an impression, but I do remember having trouble making authentic sounding horse whinnies. I could do all the subtle stuff, but the high big sounds not so much. Also, don’t laugh, but a rooster. I wanted to do it of course as realistic as possible, but I never really got that one the way I felt it should be…oh, and one other thing I might as well admit too. That loud sharp clean whistle where people use two fingers in the corner of their mounts…never could do it. So many actors and folks in general can do it and I’ll bet Nancy Cartwright can whistle like that and literally bring the pain off the walls - one of the few women who does great sound effects as well as fabulous characters.\n\nBest,\n\nFrank\n\n________________\n\nFan Name: Gerry\n\nQuestion: Frank! I'm amazed at your level of talent. I was recently watching an episode of Transformers G1 (Countdown to Extinction was the episode for reference) where you voiced Megatron, Soundwave, Skywarp, Rumble, and Frenzy in the same scene! As a voice actor, what challenges do you face, if any, when voicing multiple characters in one scene? Also, how did you wind up with so many characters to voice on that show? You had much more than anyone! Thanks for your reply!\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nGerry,\n\nThank you! Let me answer the second part of your question first…we were so busy back then (mid 80’s) and Wally Burr the director was casting for Transformers. At the time, he was also directing a lot of other shows. In other words, he was both casting and directing a ton of shows in addition to Transformers. As you know, Transformers had a LOT of characters, and he was busy, busy, busy. So, he put all the drawings of the characters on a table in the lobby with a sign saying pick three. Then he would bring you in and audition you and put your reading on tape to send to Hasbro. Well unbeknownst to Wally, remember I mentioned he was busy, I picked ten and proceeded to audition and lay down tracks for all the characters. Wally didn’t seem to notice I was coming in repeatedly. When they sent these audition tracks off to Hasbro, they were what was referred to as “blind tracts” or numbered auditions… number 1, number 6, number 8 etc. So, they didn’t know who was doing the voice they were just listening to numbers. As it turned out, they picked a lot of my numbers…so hello Megatron, Soundwave, Rumble, Frenzy, Skywarp and on. When we actually recorded the show you can imagine the surprise of my fellow actors when it came to my turn and then it was still my turn and my turn and my turn again.\n\nTalking to yourself is a bit of a challenge but it is really where the fun begins. If you have your characters locked in, it really is not much of a problem. When you have more than two talking together in the same scene it does get a bit frenetic and you get to experience schizophrenia! The hard part is coming back in a couple of weeks and remembering all your voices…usually there is a reference track, that is very helpful.\n\nBest you Gerry from “all” of us!\n\nFranks\n\n___________________\n\n​\n\nFan Name: Amber J.\n\nQuestion: Heya Frank, I know that I keep submitting questions and I apologise if it becomes annoying… it’s just that I miss you so much and this is really the only way to talk to you. I can hear your voice reading the answers so it feels warmly. What’s your favourite food by the way? Also, I got a new voice job voicing for a theme park ride!! Just applied for the lead role of an autistic girl in a new show being produced over here so fingers crossed everything goes well. I’m down to chat anytime you want. I’m always an email or a phone call away, you know where to find me! Edinburgh seems so far away still!! Only about 170 days or something. Take care ! :) -amber\n\n​\n\nFrom Frank:\n\nWell hello Amber!\n\nLooks like congrats are in order! Congratulations on your VO job for the ride park! Nice going and my fingers are also crossed for your show audition - seems you are getting the hang of it. It is very good to keep working and auditioning. I feel that the process is part of the job. I really enjoyed auditioning because you were most free to do your interpretation of the ask. Anyway, I am proud of you.\n\nFavorite food? Unfortunately, I like all FOOD so it is hard to choose…but I think I am a boring Yank and love my steak and potato. Caesar Salad with anchovy is a good side with asparagus and a good white sugar icing carrot cake for dessert. Followed the next day with two hours in the gym and then a good run!\n\nBest to you my UK friend!\n\nFrank\n\n___________________\n\nFan Name: John\n\nQuestion: Hi Frank what are some memories you have of recording the movie Man’s Best Friend?
