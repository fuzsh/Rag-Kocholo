        "text": "I remember when Pixar was acquired by Disney in 2006, and fans of the animation studio’s work up until that point were absolutely appalled. Concerned, and rightly so, that the House of Mouse would destroy that “small-time studio” feel that Pixar had, it was deemed as a billion dollar catastrophe.\n\nDespite all those reservations, it’s now clear, 14 years on, that Disney’s acquisition of the studio was a positive move for both. Pixar had the ability to create films on a much larger (aka more expensive) scale, and Disney had another studio name to add to its profitability as they began their global domination-style plan. mwahahahaha!\n\nThat’s the history lesson over with. Now, as we approach the end of 2020, and with the world completely turned upside down by the coronavirus pandemic, Pixar’s latest film, Soul, released directly to Disney+ is just the film we needed to turn our frowns upside down. But how good is it?\n\nContinue reading\n\nHas anyone even heard of Shudder? Until a few weeks ago, I hadn’t. The Horror focussed streaming service launched in 2015 and, until now, has enjoyed a rather low profile. Amongst a sea of streaming competitors, the decision to pitch themselves as a one genre pony appears, on the surface, to be a bit of a tactical misfire, but there’s just something about horror that sets it apart from other genres isn’t there?\n\nWhere other genres are watched by almost anyone and everyone, horror seems to have its own unique fanbase. I, myself, sit in the intersection of that particular Venn diagram; I consider myself both a general film fan as well as a horror fanatic. So, I guess you could say, I’m the perfect target audience for Shudder.\n\nContinue reading\n\nThe time has arrived: my first visit back to the cinema since COVID-19 swept across the globe. It’s hard to believe that it was over six months ago that I was last sitting in the cinema, enjoying the magic of the big screen.\n\nNevertheless, the day has come, and with it, the release of Christopher Nolan’s latest epic, Tenet. As is the case with Nolan’s movies, a lot of fanfare accompanies their arrival and as one of the most exciting filmmakers working today, so it should. But how good is Tenet? Are we looking at another Nolan masterpiece?\n\nAnd forgive me if I’m a little rusty, it’s been a long time!\n\nContinue reading\n\nBefore I was the movie aficionado we all know and begrudgingly tolerate, I was a different kind of aficionado, one of DC comic books. Due to this, I find the DC Animated Universe very interesting, as they can tell the stories that I loved to read years ago like Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay and give the story it’s due, while the DCEU films about those same stories like Suicide Squad fall flat on its face, onto a set of stairs, tumbling down them and breaking every single bone. The DCAU has virtually led to this.\n\nAside from a few very interesting diversions into the multiverse such as Superman: Red Son or Batman: Gotham by Gaslight, the story of the DCAU has all been building to Darkseid destroying Earth with films like Reign of the Supermen and Justice League: War all coming to a head here. Last year showed us that it is possible for major superhero franchises that have been going on for years to end a storyline really well with Avengers: Endgame. In fact, Endgame did such a good job at this, that Apokolips War lifts a large amount of it’s story from Endgame. Continue reading\n\nOnce a year, on a Saturday evening in May, arguably the most exciting television event in the world is broadcast internationally: the Eurovision Song Contest. Known for being over the top, crazy, and sometimes, hilarious, Eurovision has graced our screens for over 60 years. So, when it was announced that comedy veteran Will Ferrell was bringing us a Eurovision movie, it’s obvious that many people began to wait with bated breath for it to be released. Alas, that time has arrived, and Netflix dropped Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga for the world to enjoy, and to laugh at.\n\nThe film follows Fire Saga, an Icelandic duo comprised of Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) as they attempt to reach the Eurovision finals in Edinburgh. However, it doesn’t really help that they’re not very good. As the duo, who may be siblings but probably aren’t, embark on a musical and romantic journey, they meet a lot of new people, and a lot of new problems, on their way.\n\nContinue reading\n\nPutting on a Scooby Doo movie is the truest form of gambling. You can end up with a great time with something like Scooby-Doo: Pirates Ahoy and Scooby-Doo: Stage Fright, or you could see Scooby-Doo and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon and Scooby Doo and KISS: Rock and Roll Mystery (The crossovers aren’t great). As I am the world’s foremost expert on the subject of Mystery Incorporated and their many endeavors, I approached the newest theatrical, well, almost theatrical, film, Scoob, with cautious optimism.\n\nThe first trailer made it look like it’d be a fun, enjoyable time. Then came the second trailer, followed by the countless ads on Vudu, which made my excitement tailspin. Then I bought, yes, bought the movie so I could watch it forever and ever. To put it mildly, this is the film equivalent of Scrappy Doo, because it’s the worst Scooby related material. I can’t put the pain of reliving the movie any longer, “pets” talk about Scoob.\n\nContinue reading\n\nBloodshot is available to stream online in the UK (from £9.99) and the US ($20) via Amazon Prime Video\n\nOh, Vin Diesel. Why are you famous? Also known as the Americanized Jason Statham, replacing charisma with mumbling something-something family. This feels like a movie Statham would have been asked to do about fifteen years ago. Bloodshot, the story of a recently deceased soldier who comes back to life, is one of the three movies which won the honor of being in the last week of releases until mid May.\n\nSo, in a year still without a really good comic book film, does Bloodshot manage to fill the gap before we’re left without one for months? Honestly, the answer is pretty surprising, as I think with a few changes, this movie could have been great. So let’s discuss the movie that tens of people are talking about, Bloodshot. Continue reading\n\nJane Austen is responsible for many of the world’s most beloved romance novels. From Pride and Prejudice, to Sense and Sensibility, she has paved the way for the modern rom-com. Her tales have graced both the big and little screen in the form of period dramas, and 90s LA girl fantasies.\n\nHowever, Emma (arguably Austen’s funniest work) isn’t necessarily the first novel you think of when you think about the iconic author. Its most recent adaptation, directed by Autumn de Wilde, is a full-on, aesthetic overload, with frills left, right, and centre. But, is it any good? Continue reading\n\nThe Universal Monster films are the original MCU. With their interconnectivity and recurring characters, these serialized adventures were our first look at franchises which could crossover. One of the characters who received multiple films is The Invisible Man. At time of writing, I’ve only seen the first two Invisible Man films, the first of which is an extremely goofy romp that’s enjoyable to watch.\n\nThe second is a boring mess that spoils nearly all of the goodwill the first one had. Nevertheless, for the start of the Dark Universe, we were told that it would include an Invisible Man film starring Johnny Depp. Luckily, because that sounds awful, the Dark Universe’s triumphant first firing of the Dark Universe Cannon ended up being The Mummy (2017), which ended up tipping the cannon over right into the offices at Universal Studios and blowing a hole through the office. Continue reading\n\nThe last time Pixar released two films in the same year was 2015. The first of their double act ended up being one of their best, Inside Out. A touching, beautifully animated adventure that ranks highly alongside Up, Wall.E and of course the Toy Story series.\n\nUnfortunately, their second effort, The Good Dinosaur was by all accounts, a bit of a mess. Released by any other animation studio, The Good Dinosaur would have been perfectly serviceable, but it lacked the usual Pixar sparkle, despite some incredible animation.\n\nFast forward five years and Pixar are at it again; releasing two films in the same year. Soul is out in cinemas later in 2020, but our first contender is Onward. But is it up to the standard of Pixar’s classics, or more akin to their forgettable adventures? Continue reading"
