        "text": "Well known radio host and cartoon voice actor Kemal Amin “Casey” Kasem passed away this morning in a hospital in Seattle of natural causes. He was best known as a radio personality (American Top 40) – but best better remembered as a prolific voice actor in dozens of animated cartoons.\n\nChief among his performances was that of of “Shaggy” in the Scooby-Doo franchise from 1969 to 1997, and again from 2002 until 2009. Kasem had done numerous voices for Sesame Street; provided the voice of Peter Cottontail in the Rankin/Bass’ Here Comes Peter Cottontail; provided the voices of Robin on Super Friends, Alex in Josie and The Pussycats; Mark of Battle of the Planets, and a number of characters for the Transformers cartoon series of the 1980s. Most recently he did the voice of Shaggy’s father in the 2010 TV series, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated.\n\nCasey also co-hosted many of the Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethons during the 1980s – here’s a clip of Casey doing “Shaggy” on camera for the cause:"
