        "text": "A recent fun fact post talked about how \"Scooby on Ice!\" from Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? was not the first time that Tara Lipinski has done voice work for Scooby-Doo. Unbeknownst to most, she also voiced Grey in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? episode \"Camp Comeoniwannascareya.\" This inspired me to do a deep dive project on all the guest stars from The New Scooby-Doo Movies and Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? to discover if any of them had previously had roles as other characters on the show (and I was surprised to discover quite a few of them did!). This post highlights all the guest stars from these two series that have had previous roles in other episodes before or after their first appearance in the franchise. I included both real-life celebrities and voices of fictional characters, such as The Addams Family and Wonder Woman; however, I did not include ones that were extremely famous voice actors (for example, Casey Kasem plays Alexander of Josie and the Pussycats, so it's obvious he's had other roles in the show).\n\nJanet Waldo, most famous for voicing Jane Jetson, played both Grandmama Addams and Josie in The New Scooby-Doo Movies. However, she would later voice several notable characters in The Scooby-Doo Show, including Scooby-Dee from \"The Chiller Diller Movie Thriller,\" Lisa Vanaugh from \"Vampire Bats and Scaredy Cats,\" and Arlene Wilcox from \"To Switch a Witch.\"\n\nWe probably all know that Don Knotts would go on to voice the groundskeeper in the video game, Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights.\n\nJackie Joseph, who voiced Melody, went on to voice a very random Scooby-Doo character almost 20 years later...Velma's Aunt Thelma from \"Scooby Dude.\"\n\nThis one is perhaps more well-known, but Tim Conway would later go on to voice Fred's dad, Skip Jones, in Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy. He also voiced Professor Alexander Graham in the Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights video game.\n\nMoving on to the Guess Who guest stars, Rachel Kimsey voiced Wonder Woman. Later in the series, she'd also voice Marla and the chef from \"A Fashion Nightmare!\"\n\nIf you thought Sandy Duncan and Cher were the only guest stars to have roles in both The New Scooby-Doo Movies and Guess Who, you would be wrong! Mark Hamill appeared as as himself in Guess Who, but he had previously voiced one of Jeannie's masters, Corey Anders, in \"Mystery in Persia\" of The New Scooby-Doo Movies. Mark Hamill previously voiced Snakebite Scruggs in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island; Steve in Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders; Shifty in Night of the Living Doo; Deacon, Babyface Boretti and the store owner in Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare; and Zip Elvin in Scooby-Doo! Moon Monster Madness. Mark Hamill has also provided several voices of the side characters and villains in What's New Scooby-Doo?, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated and Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!. His What's New roles include Captain Guzman and Emperor Caesar Salidicus in \"Pompeii and Circumstance,\" as well as Tommy's father in \"A Scooby-Doo Christmas.\" He voiced Crybaby Clown and the Drill Sargeant from \"The Night the Clown Cried\" and \"The Night the Clown Cried II: Tears of Doom\" in SDMI, in addition to voicing General Stall in Be Cool, Scooby-Doo's \"Area 51 Adjacent.\" Moreover, in Guess Who, he also voiced The Joker in \"What a Night, for a Dark Knight!\" and the Trickster in \"One Minute Mysteries!\".\n\nIn addition to appearing as himself in Guess Who, George Takei also appeared as the White Wizard and Mr. Wang in SDMI. The Old Samurai in Scooby-Doo and Samurai Sword was also voiced by Takei.\n\nMalcolm McDowell had previously voiced the Sly Baron in Scooby-Doo! Moon Monster Madness in 2015 before appearing in the first season of Guess Who."
