        "text": "So 4 kids and a dog risk their lives meddling around in dangerous areas rather than letting the police and FBI with hundreds of canines and detective agency catch the costumed creeps instead? How is it that when they wear the costumes, they appear to have super powers, and when they are caught and revealed, it looks as if they lost their powers? so if thats the case then why doesnt the gang wear costumes in order to fight the villains?. Why are they so afraid of the monsters if they know that they are just people in costumes? Why dont they just use weapons to catch the monsters rather than just running away all the time and using lame traps? why does it seem as if the monsters attack everywhere the gang goes, as if they are some sort of monster magnet?\n\nBut despite of not liking scooby doo, i actually enjoyed this series, the best scooby doo series of all because of its darker tone and all\n\nPros & Cons for Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, sweet,\n\nPros:\n\nIt was an awesome enjoyable Scooby-Doo reboot series with it having an ongoing story arc along with the creepy dark plot elements/total seriousness/ongoing relationship drama, so great.\n\nFred/Daphne/Velma/Shaggy/Scooby being awesome main protagonists saving the world from the forces of evil while solving mysteries.\n\nBimbo Fred who's hilarious with his trap-obsessions next to Bimbo Lola Bunny.\n\nVincent Van Ghoul/The Hex Girls: Thorn/Luna/Dusk appearing in it who are awesome.\n\nSheriff Bronson Stone who's an awesome funny corrupt scumbag sheriff along with his sweet anti-heroism/soft sides.\n\nThe Evil Entity, Professor Pericles, Mr. E(Ricky), and Alice May(Deacon/The Creeper's daughter) who're awesome new dangerous major villains worse than the epic 13 Ghosts/Dr. Phibes.\n\nBoth Angel Dynamite(Cassidy), Skipper Shelton, Dr. Rick Spartan, Mary-Ann Gleardon, Mayor Janet Nettles, Hot Dog Water(Marcy)(the Anti-Velma turned good), and Nova being awesome new friends/allies.\n\nVelma & Hot Dog Water(Marcy)'s sweet relationships.\n\nBoth Fred/Daphne, Scooby/Nova, and Sheriff Bronson Stone/Mayor Janet Nettles the best awesome couples.\n\nThe fake monsters being more scary/dangerous with nice designs.\n\nBoth Don Knotts and Clark Griswold/The Griswold Family(National Lampoon's Vacation) appearing in Beware the Beast Below/The Creeping Creatures cold opening.\n\nGunther Gator looking like Headmaster, sweet.\n\nThe awesome cameos/appearances of Teenage Pebbles/Teenage Bam-Bam, a vicious Yogi Bear, The Chan Clan members: Henry/Stanley/Suzie/Alan/Anne/Tom/Flip/Nancy/Mimi/Scooter/Chu Chu(The Legend of Alice May), the gang with Jabberjaw/Speed Buggy/J. Wellington \"Mudsy\" Muddlemore/Captain Caveman, The Blue Falcon & Dynomutt, Dr. Benton Quest/Race Bannon(epic heroes), Dr. Zin(epic villain), and Tom & Tub/Scooby the Seal.\n\nJ. Wellington \"Mudsy\" Muddlemore/The Funky Phantom becoming a villain, cool.\n\nThe original Mysteries Incorporated: Professor Pericles/Ricky/Cassidy/Brad & Judy's histories.\n\nThe histories of many Mysteries Incorporated-like people.\n\nThe whole \"finding/gathering the pieces of the enigmatic Planispheric Disk and Nibiru\" plot and Scooby-Doo who's an alien which was great/interesting.\n\nBoth Mr. E(Ricky), Benson Fuhrman, and The Crystal Cove Librarian being great sympathetic villains that I pity.\n\nGizmo(The Gremlins) in The Dragon's Secret, the monsters in Dr. Phibes/The Fly, The Scrappy-Doo/Flim Flam statues, Ernesto being a parody of Che Guevara, and Daphne's evil new boyfriend Baylor Hotner being a parody of Taylor Lautner.\n\nThe Labyrinth(my favorite epic fantasy movie) parody and Dungeons & Dragons/Mazes & Monsters parodies in Web of the Dreamweaver.\n\nBoth Professor Pericles, Ricky, Cassidy, Sheriff Bronson Stone, Mayor Janet Nettles, and Hot Dog Water(Marcy) having a nice happy ending.\n\nBoth Mayor Fred Jones Sr., Brad & Judy, Barty & Nan, Dale & Angie, Colton & Paula, and Baylor Hotner getting their satisfying just desserts.\n\nMayor Fred Jones Sr. redeeming himself to be a good fake father for Fred.\n\nCasey Kasem(Colton Rogers), Frank Welker(Fred/Barty), Matthew Lillard(Shaggy), Grey DeLisle(Daphne/Paula), Mindy Cohn(Velma), Linda Cardellini(Hot Dog Water/Marcy), Vivica Fox(Angel Dynamite/Cassidy), Mark Hamill(Crybaby Clown), Kate Higgins, Lewis Black(Mr. E./Ricky), and Troy Baker(The Dreamweaver) were amazing in their roles.\n\nCons:\n\nVelma worse than The Looney Tunes Show's Daffy Duck being a terrible/bossy/controlling girlfriend for poor Shaggy which Shaggy/Velma, a worst couple.\n\nMayor Fred Jones Sr., Brad & Judy, Barty Blake & Nan Blake, Dale Dinkley & Angie Dinkley, and Colton Rogers & Paula Rogers being annoying horrible unlikable jerkhole parents/major pains in the butt, ugh.\n\nNo explanation to what happened to poor Ed Machine from what Professor Pericles did to him.\n\nBrad & Judy having a happy ending for the horrible things they've done was awful of the dumb writers.\n\nI like most of the show but i do have some Cons over it:\n\n-As everyone, the way Velma acted was a bit much and would have been better with a different plot or at least not having act as a total drag.\n\n-No explanation what so over on what happened to Ed Machine or what Pericles had done to him. As his last name implied you would think he was a robot all along and Pericles would have taking over.\n\n-Having Brad Chiles and Judy Reeves working for Pericles was odd and a dumb move where you think that the 2 have gone somewhere to protect Fred also didn't like how they acted on the 2nd Season where in my opinion feel that Mayor Jones had done a better as a father to Fred then what Brad has ever done. Not to mention that in the alt. reality they are with Fred like nothing happen or should have shown in the last episode of how bad they feel on betraying their son and redeem themselves at the end by saving him but we didn't get that.\n\n-Changing Daphne's sisters of having great careers to being slackers was a bit harsh, i mean Daphne's sisters didn't act bad towards or interact much with her except one of them, her mom was the one who was pushing Daphne on being more like them so i don't see why they change that where they would have treated her as equals and having her sisters be happy for her.\n\n-The way Mr. E was mix where he warns the gang on not interfering over the mystery of Crystal cove yet he helps them on giving them clues and later starting working with Pericles where you think that they hate each other and want the treasure(what it was assume) to themselves.\n\n- We really didn't see much of how the gang or Scooby supposedly get into the darkness and how the Gang's pet is the first one on behaving differently also didn't show any signs of either of them of acting evil or selfish, would have been good that happen and Scooby is the only one not being affected and breaking that circle.\n\n- Never explained Alice May true intention while working for Mr. E or why she was working with him again after the episode \"Cursed of Alice May\"\n\n-Pericles: I feel he got scot-free at the end where he's happy along with Rick and Cassidy where he had done terrible things that you feel he didn't get a deserving punishment also feel that the last battle should have been with him and Scooby Doo since it had that feeling that Scooby would fight with Pericles yet we didn't get it."
