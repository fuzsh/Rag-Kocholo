        "text": "Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy! is a 2006 direct-to-video animated movie starring Scooby-Doo.\n\nSummary[]\n\nScooby and the gang take a mystery-themed cruise through the Bermuda Triangle, but what starts out as staged hijinks soon turns into the real thing. Ghost pirates are prowling the legendary waters of the Triangle, searching for a priceless treasure, and someone on board the cruise ship may hold the secret to its location. Now Scooby and the rest of the gang will have to solve the real mystery behind the mysterious treasure or they may end up walking the plank to sink to the depths of Davy Jones' Locker!\n\nThe movie includes songs by Paul James Prendergast and a duet by Rich Dickerson and Gigi Meroni.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nDaphne was barefoot while inside The Mystery Machine, despite wearing her dress. At the time, this oddity last occurred in November 1982, with Heidi in the movie Heidi's Song, and more notably, Darla Hood in the \"Cap'n Spanky's Showboat\" episode of The Little Rascals – but very briefly.\n\nThis film was released on DVD four days before the launch of the TV series Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! on The CW Network.\n\nThe cast's wardrobe was the same as in What's New Scooby-Doo?, which ended its run the same year this movie was released.\n\nThis is the first appearance of Fred's parents.\n\nVoice Cast[]\n\nDan Castellaneta as Mr. Mysterio and Wooden Leg Wally\n\nMindy Cohn as Velma Dinkley\n\nTim Conway as Skip Jones\n\nGrey DeLisle as Daphne Blake\n\nArsenio Hall as Captain Crothers\n\nCasey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers\n\nEdie McClurg as Peggy Jones and Sea Salt Sally\n\nKathy Najimy as Sunny St. Cloud\n\nRon Perlman as Captain Skunkbeard and Biff Wellington\n\nFreddy Rodríguez as Rupert García\n\nFrank Welker as Fred Jones and Scooby-Doo\n\n[]"
