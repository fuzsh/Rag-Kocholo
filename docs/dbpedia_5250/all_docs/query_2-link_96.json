        "text": "American radio personality and voice actor Casey Kasem has passed away today aged 82, his children have announced. Kasem – who was best known as the host of the American Top 40, as well as voicing Shaggy in Scooby-Doo – had been suffering from dementia, and was recently at the centre of a bitter family dispute over his end-of-life care.\n\n“Early this Father’s Day morning, our dad Casey Kasem passed away surrounded by family and friends,” reads a family statement. “Even though we know he is in a better place and no longer suffering, we are heartbroken. Thank you for all your love, support and prayers. The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian; we will miss our Dad.”\n\nKasem began his radio career in the 1950s and hosted the American Top 40 from 1970 to 1988, with a second spell following from 1998 until 2004. He began his acting career in the 1960s, first lending his voice to Robin in The Adventures of Batman before taking on the role of Shaggy in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, beginning a long association with the character than ran from 1969 through to 2009 (with a five year gap between 1997 and 2009)."
