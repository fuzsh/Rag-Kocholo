        "text": "\"The Scooby Doo Show\"\n\nSyndicated/Cable (1980 to present)\"The Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour\"\n\nOriginal (ABC, 1976) ♪\n\nWe got it all together for a brand new show\n\nScooby Doo is here, and yet away we go\n\nWhile Scooby Doo is haunted by a spooky Ghost\n\nShaggy is a-doin' what he does the most\n\nHey come on, get involved, 'till the mystery is solved\n\nHang around for Scooby Doo... etc.\n\n♪\n\nThey've got it all together, and do you know what?\n\nScooby Doo is hangin' 'round with Dynomutt!\n\nWhile Scooby Doo is tangling with a spooky Ghost\n\nDynomutt is catching crooks or folding clothes\n\nThey make a super pair, with a super show to share\n\nScooby Dooby Doo! And Dynomutt, Dog Wonder!\n\n\"Why are we running this way, Uncle Scooby; the ghost went the other way!\"\n\nSCOOBY AND SCRAPPY DOO\n\n\"Put 'em up, prepare to splat\"; \"Tata-ta ta ta-ta, Puppy Power\", were the battle cries of the feisty little pup who joined the gang in 1979 (for Scooby's 10th anniversary). Amazingly, this has become probably the most hated cartoon character of all time, at least on the Internet. In the early days of the Internet's commonplace usage, hardly a Usenet news group discussion on Scooby went by without someone taking pot-shots at Scrappy, plus whole other websites trashing him, even coming up with a sort of death ribbon as their symbol (similar to the familiar \"Breast Cancer Awareness\" ribbon, but with pictures of Scrappy on it). Jumptheshark.com, which chronicled people's opinion on the downfall of TV shows, listed him as the number one example of the category \"New Kid In Town\". Worse yet, latter day productions would begin to cast him as a total menace to everyone.\n\nMany \"Scooby purists\" find him not only annoying, but also feel he is the downfall of the show. (And even Scooby haters also seem to have had an added hatred for him). Yet the series would continue for almost a solid decade (skipping only 1986) after that. It has also been pointed out that the ratings did not suffer at all but remained as strong as ever (which is why they would keep making new Scooby shows year after year). To skip over this period (as some suggest), is to cut out the entire middle decade-- a whole third of the first half of Scooby's career! Some of his greatest moments were during this time!\n\nMark Evanier, who wrote for the series during this time has even been quoted as saying \"The network kept threatening to cancel it every year or two, so every season they had to add a new element to the show to keep it fresh\". We see they had already toyed with a new character in Scooby Dum, so change was inevitable. So, Scrappy was simply part of a cartoon fad of the time, where popular characters were given little sidekicks after a few seasons. So Plastic Man got Baby Plas, Fangface got Fang Puss, Godzilla got Godzookey, and Scooby got Scrappy, his nephew by his sister Ruby Doo. (This will be revealed the following season). A fad like this had already occurred even back in the golden age of theatrical cartoons, with annoying young nephews being given to characters (sparked off by Huey, Dewey & Louie of Donald Duck Fame). You also had Linus of Peanuts receiving a baby brother who looked just like him, Rerun.\n\nMany of them are similar in personality to Scrappy, and in fact, Evanier had even patterned his personality largely after popular Looney Tune character Henery Hawk (who always challenges roosters or dogs much bigger than him), after Barbera described the concept to him, and after rumor spread of an ABC executive being easily sold on series that could be perceived as having some lineage with classic Warner Brothers cartoons. (\"Scrappy Days\")\n\nAside from the fearlessness, another aspect of Scrappy would resemble Sylvester Jr. (who always urges his wimpy father to action), and also bulldog Spike's sidekick Chester (who does both, and is also a puppy!) None of these other sidekicks got the hostility leveled at Scrappy. People's aversion to these little characters seems to be that they make shows lame, \"cutesy\", \"mushy\" or \"gooey\" and thus more child-oriented, but Scrappy was actually the least like this of all these characters!\n\nStill, Scrappy drew more villification, perhaps because he was the longest running of them, and on the greatest cartoon series ever, as has been pointed out. However, recall that one of the original ideas for Scooby besides a big cowardly dog was a small feisty dog! \"Scooby-Doo Still Going Strong on DVD\" by John Latchem, Home Media Magazine, Oct. 20, 2007 http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=11404 even confirms that he \"...bore a resemblance to Spears and Rubys initial idea for a feisty little dog\". So Scrappy may not even be as unoriginal to the series as we thought!\n\nMost fans will agree that Scooby's first four seasons were far superior, but looking at the lackluster episodes of the subsequent three seasons, this addition actually breathed new life into the show, with most of the attention going to Scrappy, who thinks he's 'bad' enough to whip monsters 10 times his size. This was a total contrast to Scooby and Shaggy, who always wanted to run away. This actually keeps with the format of the show, because in the earlier episodes, Freddy and Velma were the contrast Shaggy and Scooby needed to keep them from running away, abandoning the mystery altogether. (And if Scrappy is such an annoying troublemaker, don't forget the similar role of \"danger-prone Daphne\", in the original series). This now finalized a permanent division between \"Freddy and the girls\", and \"Shaggy and the dogs\". In the final episode, Freddy and the girls make only brief appearances, dropping off and picking up Shaggy and the dogs in New York City, and are otherwise absent from the story, which for the first time is not a mystery (a shadow of things to come). Velma, in this transitional episode is completely silent, and in the four episodes before that, had a third voice, by Maria Frumkin (who would return for four episodes in 1984). One hilarious scene has Shaggy and Scooby barricading a door to lose the snake demon, only to have Scrappy carry the creature (above his head) in the other door. (\"Look guys, I've found him!\"). But once again, only seeing this as annoying, the critics don't appreciate how funny it is.\n\nOtherwise, the series was a continuation of the '76-78 series, and reflected the late 70's culture with such villains as the Neon Phantom of the Roller Disco, and the Star Creature. Adding to people's dislike of this period, most stories were weak, and some elements were downright corny (Lady Vampire of the Bay, Sky Skeleton, Devil Bear). They were clearly running out of ideas! Once again, Scrappy cannot be blamed for this (it was already going this way), and producing the same episodes without him would not have helped. The format was old and needed a rest. There were a few new ideas, such as \"Night Ghoul Of Wonderland\", about an amusement park where Velma plays out a Sherlock Holmes fantasy mystery, which then becomes a real crime case. One story people generally like is the opener, about a comic book super hero who comes to life as a super villain. Evanier had actually imported this from a former comic book story he had done for Scooby.\n\nThe original 1969 score is completely absent now, but fresh new music replaced most of the other score.\n\nThis early Scrappy was often naive, and admittedly, kind of annoying. Sometimes, he actually would get hurt if not snatched away in time by the others, like in the first episode \"The Scarab Lives\". (When told not to move, he continues to stand still even as a heavy stone statue is plummeting toward him from a roof). He often pounces on the wrong people, claiming \"but I'm just a puppy\". And his \"Scrappy Traps\", snare like contraptions, always seem to catch Shaggy and Scooby instead of the bad guy. (Finding Shaggy in it one time, even asks if he's the villain!) He did get on Shaggy and Scooby's nerves sometimes, and once, when trapped in something, Shaggy jokingly suggests leaving him in there. But the critics fail to realize that in the following seasons, Scrappy would mature a lot, which will eliminate his annoyingness, and add to his funniness.\n\nAlso this season, was a prime-time hour long special \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\", in which Scooby tries to become a star. (Scrappy is not present, even though this was produced at the same time as the regular season episodes, and uses some of the new score.)\n\nA NEW DIRECTION\n\nAfter 105 episodes in 10 years of mystery solving and dozens of copycat shows, Scooby took a totally different turn in 1980. Originally airing as part of the Richie-Rich/Scooby Doo hour, the new Scooby cartoons marked a total departure from his established format. Episode length was reduced from the usual half-hour to 7 minutes, the standard length of cartoon shorts, with 3 fitting in a half hour. The by now played out mystery format was totally dropped, as were Freddy and the girls, and now, Scooby, Scrappy and Shaggy, who were obviously the main attractions of the show, took off on their own in a series of slapstick chase adventures and fairy tale spoofs reminiscent of the great theatrical shorts of old. Ghosts and monsters were now real, no longer crooks in disguise, and settings would range from a day in the park to such fantasy places as \"Ahz\", Atlantis, Jack's Beanstalk, Alice's \"Wonderland\", the pre-historic past, a Jetsons-like future, and even outer space.\n\nThe series could have been played by any three characters, but it is still interesting to see Shaggy and Scooby in this new setting. They are still their same old selves, always crying \"Zoinks\", and \"yow\", as they always had in the mysteries. This shows that Scooby was very versatile; being able to exist in a totally different format. Freddy and the girls and the mystery format were at this point no longer useful, (they had stuck together so much, that they could easily have been replaced by a single character, and this is essentially what was done here) and it is as if they had cut all the chase scenes with Shaggy and the dogs (or Shaggy and Scooby by themselves) out of the mysteries and framed them into their own mini-episodes. This was an appreciable relief to a theme that was well worn by then. It was simply the logical conclusion of the direction the series was going in. (But the series would eventually go full circle back around to the original format).\n\nThis was admittedly a very dark period for Scooby. Not only was nearly every elemental feature of the original Scooby format gone, but for the first and only time, Scooby now had second billing to another cartoon star (Richie Rich)! And all of this may not have been completely avoidable. 1980 was apparently a hectic year in the industry. A voice actors strike even pushed back the fall season to November, and many cartoons were forced to have a limited voice cast! (There apparently had already been a problem keeping Velma's role steadily casted, and now perhaps they could only get Don Messick and Casey Kasem to do the series). Hanna Barbera also seemed to make only short cartoons during this period.\n\nThe Mystery Machine, ironically, is still around, now driven by Shaggy. In fact, one feature of the old show that had returned is Shaggy's ability to be serious at times. In the early series, while Shaggy would often be just as scared as Scooby, at some times, he would talk sense into him, and even order him to the task at hand, or to stop being scared. So Shaggy was a bit more like the other kids back then. Over time, this disappeared, as both Shaggy and Scooby were constantly written as being cowardly together, and it was Freddy and Velma ordering them around. But now, as the de-facto leader of the gang, Shaggy once again talks sense into Scooby at times, especially when Scooby sees the ghost first. Once Shaggy sees it, then he becomes scared and runs away with Scooby. An example is \"Scooby Ghosts West\". He of course also tries to talk sense into Scrappy, as in Waxworld. (Though for the opposite reason than for Scooby, of course).\n\nScrappy has matured some, just as brave as before, but now knowing what he is doing, and this time able to carry out his threats and actually splat the bad guy. Shaggy and Scooby constantly grab him away from characters that he could really handle himself if left alone. This makes him at his funniest in the series. When bullies and other creeps attack Scooby, Scrappy shouts \"nobody does that to my Uncle Scooby\", calls \"Puppy Power\", and splats the meanie good if Scooby doesn't snatch him away first. People criticize him for being so small and \"all talk\", yet now he could put his money where his mouth was! For instance, when Shaggy and Scooby are tired of being chased by a lava monster, and Shaggy wishes he would go \"back to where he came from\", Scrappy says \"Well, why didn't you say so?\" and simply picks up the creature, carries him off and throws him back into the volcano. This is not the naive brat of the first season, whom the critics can't seem to see past. Helping to improve the character, his new Don Messick voice (similar to Ricochet Rabbit) suited him much better than the crotchety Lennie Weinrib voice (similar to Shaggy's uncle Nat) of the first season. And he no longer barked like he did in the first season. In fact, the Scrappys of the first and second (& later) seasons are almost like two totally different characters, and if people had given him a chance after the first season, maybe we wouldn't have the rampant hatred of him afterward.\n\nHe did get the others in trouble by repeatedly giving away their disguises (trying to fight the bad guy), as in \"Lighthouse keeper Scooby\" and \"Waxworld\", but this was hilarious, not annoying (except to Shaggy and Scooby). Cartoon characters are supposed to do silly things that cause trouble.\n\nThe adventure begins with \"Close Encounters with the Strange Kind\", which begins very similarly to the prior season's mystery, \"Close Encounters of a Scooby Kind\". A UFO soars through the evening sky, lands, and its alien pilots are seen. We cut to Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy, on a camping trip, who soon encounter the aliens. In the former episode, they go and get Freddy and the girls, as usual, and their later trip into space turns out to be phony (a movie type prop). But now, in this season, the aliens actually do kidnap Shaggy into space, and Scooby and Scrappy follow, and the chase begins to get Shaggy back to earth. This time, the aliens are not unmasked; they simply abandon their earth-specimen mission, and the episode ends as they drop the gang off back on earth and head back to their planet. Next, the gang has their first encounter with a real vampire in \"A Fit Night for Bats\". They tackle one last phony ghost in \"Chinese Food Factory\", and for the next 57 episodes will encounter a real mummy, real sorcerers, witches, monsters, ghosts, and other legendary characters, ending the series with an encounter with a real Bigfoot! As in other cartoons, the reality of these characters is not questioned. While the old Scooby format tried to be fairly realistic, in this series, anything is possible. One ghost even turns out to be the spirit of Scooby's great-grandpa, a civil war dog trying to rid Scooby Manor of the cowardly Scooby and his grandpa. (He is proud of Scrappy, though). In \"Scooby's Luck of the Irish\", they try to get gold from a smart-alecky leprechaun they had captured. Not all episodes involve supernatural or mythical adversaries. In \"Way Out Scooby\", they wind up on Mars, and are confronted by a US robot whom they think is a Martian. Scooby is pitted against a jealous bully bulldog in \"Scooby's Swiss Miss\" and \"Strongman Scooby\". He also runs into a bullfight, an army training base, a restaurant that refuses to serve dogs, \"Nazrat\" of the jungle, spies in \"Surprised Spies\" (the other of the series only 2 crime plots), and a rival football team. Not all episodes even had bad guys. In \"Scooby Dooby Goo\", Shaggy and Scooby are turned into babies by a steam bath, and are entered into a baby contest by Scrappy, only to have him win when they change back to normal. They get carried away on a hang glider in \"Hang in there Scooby\". \"Scrappy's Birthday\" retells Scrappy's birth to Scooby's sister Ruby Doo. In 1984, episodes were rebroadcast under the title \"Scary Scooby Funnies\", with a new opening sequence similar to the New Scooby Doo Mysteries they aired with, and this is how they are referred.\n\n1980 was also the season the older episodes entered syndication. So Scooby fans unimpressed with Scrappy could now enjoy their old favorites five days a week. While the original CBS series had been rebroadcast on ABC, the hour long Movies hadn't, and were now seen for the first time since the CBS run, aired in 2 half-hour parts. Generally, the schedule was Monday, \"Scooby Doo, Where Are You\" (1969); Tues/Wed., Comedy Movie pt. 1, 2; Thurs., \"Where Are You\" (1970); Fri., \"Scooby Doo Show\" (1976-78). Of course, local stations could change this around. The subsequent seasons debuting during this period would gradually be added to the syndication package in the latter half of the decade.\n\nSCOOBY AND YABBA\n\nThe Scooby and Scrappy Doo/Puppy show of 1982 was a joint venture between Hanna Barbera and their former storymen Ruby and Spears' company (which had been taken over by HB's parent company Taft), joining Ruby Spears' Petey the Puppy with new episodes of Scooby and Scrappy, plus the western adventures of Scrappy and another Doo relative, Sheriff Yabba (sort of a canine Quick Draw McGraw), and a western counterpart to Shaggy, Deputy Dusty. Because of the joint production, different, non-HB sound effects (such as the old Warner Brothers whipoorwhil, used for running), can be heard in the show.\n\nScooby episodes were similar to the Scary Scooby's, but now there was a semi-return to a crime-solving format, as in half of the episodes the three work at Shaggy's Uncle Fearless' detective agency, where they get called onto new cases. It's still not quite the old mystery routine, as such crooks as the Cat Lady and others were their true identities. (\"Capt. Canine Caper\", \"Catfish Burglar Caper\", \"Comic Book Caper\", and \"Snow Job Too Small\" are the exceptions, with the crooks unmasked in the end). The other episodes feature our heroes dealing with other teens in teenage type situations such as teen center sports, the beach and dating. (The bulldog we saw twice before is now given a teenaged master, and aliens and genies and others are now distinctively teen.) Scrappy is pretty much the same, but is now becoming less prominent in the show, not confronting bullies as much, as the focus is gradually being shifted back to Shaggy and Scooby. Over all, these episodes, more people-oriented than the Scary Scoobies, did make for a nice series of cute comedies, and three of the Fearless cartoons (\"Maltese Mackerel\", Stakeout at the Takeout\", and \"Beauty Contest Caper\") even featured original 1969 score, unused for several seasons by now.\n\nThis series now uses the same modified \"Scooby and Scrappy\" opening sequence as the last season's series, but the closing sequence is the original from this season, including Dean Elliot's \"Petey the Puppy\" theme.\n\nTHE ALL NEW SCOOBY AND SCRAPPY\n\nIn 1983, Scooby returned to his old tried and true domain of ghost-catching. The opening sequence begins with bats flying off, in the fashion of the original series' opening. Everything now though, was a scaled down version of before. Half-hour shows consisted of 2 mini-mystery episodes. There were a couple of end-season two-parters that filled a half hour each. Daphne returned, looking and sounding like before, but now was no longer ditzy, but instead, has taken over Velma's role as the intelligent female of the gang. She now drives the Mystery Machine, working as a \"snoopy reporter\" for a magazine, and bringing the gang to her cases. Scrappy is now even more matured, and totally softened down from before, having a much bigger sense of danger. He will even back down if a monster growls loud enough, and can even be seen shivering in fear and crying for help; unthinkable in his earlier life. He is now basically the \"new Freddy\", solving the mystery with Daphne, while Shaggy and Scooby return to their prior role as the comedy relief who only keep the ghosts busy while Scrappy and Daphne find the clues. Still, they make for cute little mysteries, with a lot of fresh new ideas brought in. New villains include a dinosaur, the Hound of the Scoobyvilles (Scooby himself gets suspected), and the Creature from Chem-Lab. Once again, phony characters were unmasked in the end, but \"Scoobygeist\", \"Wizards and Warlocks\" and \"Who's Minding the Monster\" follow the Scary Scooby pattern of real monsters. \"The Mark of Scooby\" is a takeoff of Zorro, set in a Spanish village (actually a dream). The two-part \"Where is Scooby Doo\" has a \"murder on the Orient Express\" plot, and the final \"Wedding Bell Boos\", feature much of Scooby and Shaggy's families, including the ghost (supposedly) of one of Shaggy's ancestors, who tries to wreck Shaggy's sister's wedding. Even more new score was added-- modern, but creating a comparable \"mystery\" atmosphere to the original.\n\n1984's \"The New Scooby Doo Mysteries\" is a continuation of the All New Scooby and Scrappy except that Scooby now has his own company, the Scooby Doo Detective Agency. The show is heavily influenced by the movie \"Ghostbusters\" (The gang is even called this a few times!), and the opening sequence is set to a hip-hop beat with rapped lyrics, and has the gang and six classic monsters (Dracula, Medusa, Frankenstein, Igor, werewolf and sea demon) dancing to the beat. The funny new ideas continue as the gang runs into the \"Hands of Horror\" (mechanical floating hands), and as the \"Bee Team\"(takeoff of TV's \"The A Team\") tackle giant killer bees. There is even a caricature of scientist Carl Sagan as a scientist in \"South Pole Vault\".\n\nThe highlight of the season was the six two part episodes featuring the guest appearances of Freddy (now a mystery writer) and/or Velma (now a researcher with NASA). The first is the season opener, \"Happy Birthday Scooby\", a 15th anniversary tribute, set to the theme of \"This is Your Life\". The final episode is a Christmas special, based on the \"Nutcracker\" play. Scooby becomes \"Sherlock Doo\" in one, and even helps out the President in another, and \"Halloween Hassle in Dracula's Castle\", and \"Ghosts of the Ancient Astronauts\" feature real ghosts and monsters, and recaptures some of the magic of the original series.\n\nIn these two seasons, our gang receives their last names: Daphne Blake (though this was first used for her uncle in \"A Bum Steer for Scooby\"), Shaggy Rogers, Freddy Jones (mistakenly called \"Rogers\" in his initial introduction in \"Happy Birthday Scooby\") , and Velma Dinkley.)\n\nTHE THIRTEEN GHOSTS OF SCOOBY DOO\n\nScooby entered another era in 1985 with the Thirteen Ghosts of Scooby Doo. Everything has now been updated. The new Mystery Machine is a modern sleek red high-tech van, and there is also a Flying Mystery Machine-- the gang's own private plane! Daphne has a totally new look with a new hairstyle and new outfits, and Shaggy's T-shirt has changed from green to orange.\n\nThis series is based on \"Ghostbusters\", as in the first episode, Scooby has been tricked into opening the \"Chest of Demons\", containing the 13 worst ghosts of all, which now scatter all around the earth. Scooby and the gang (the trimmed down gang Raggy, Rappy, Raphne) now must travel the globe tracking down these ghosts and trapping them in the chest. (They sometimes use vacuum-like devices similar to the Ghostbusters). They are joined by a haggling little kid, Flim-Flam, and his wizard friend Vincent Van-Ghoul (Vincent Price). Aiding the demons are a pair of bungling ghosts voiced by Arte Johnson and Howard Morris, and one episode replaces them with three bungling witches (a female \"Three Stooges\").\n\nOnce again, these ghosts are real, and the show features seances and the gang communicates with Vincent through his crystal ball. He can also magically appear on the scene to help the gang. A few times we get a new feature: \"program interruptions\"-- comical newsbrief type bits. In \"Scoobra Cadoobra\" a caricature of children's TV watchdog Peggy Charren demands a scene with a dragon be cut out. Scrappy (as the dragon's attorney) protests that she has something against dragons, and that he has to feed his family too. This idea would be heavily used in the upcoming \"A Pup named Scooby Doo\". In \"It's a Wonderful Scoob\", a caricature of President Reagan appears in one of these spots, urging Scooby to return to ghost-chasing. He had gotten so tired of ghosts that he quit and went back to his parents, to be replaced by a dopey St. Bernard. Then, in the fashion of both \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", Scooby is shown glimpses of what the world would be like without him, as the ghost Time Slime takes over and creates a dark future. But as always, Scooby eventually overcomes his fear and gains enough courage to come back and save the day. In another episode, the gang is actually trapped in the pages of the funny papers, and in still another, they get trapped in a warped mirror dimension. The opener, \"To all the Ghouls I've Loved Before\", and \"Me and My Shadow Demon\" dig out both some original 1969 score, and 1978 \"Superfriends\" score.\n\nHANNA BARBERA SUPERSTAR 10 MOVIES\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, Hanna Barbera released ten 2 hour movies for syndication, featuring their top stars, and this included three for Scooby Doo: Scooby and the Ghoul School, Scooby and the Boo Brothers, and Scooby and the Reluctant Werewolf. In all three, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy run into adventures with real ghosts and monsters (sort of like extended \"Scary Scooby Funnies\" cartoons). However, The Boo Brothers does have such elements of the traditional mystery format as searching for clues, and a phony ghost unmasked in the end. Carried over from the 13 Ghosts are the new Mystery Machine and Shaggy's orange T-shirt. (In the Boo Brothers, Shaggy drives a jeep colored the same green as the old Mystery Machine). By this time, Hanna-Barbera had ceased using Hoyt Curtin/Ted Nichols music score, so all the older score was retired for good.\n\nThe Ghoul School is a boarding school for the daughters of Dracula and other monsters, and the gang winds up as their gym teacher. They must battle against a rival military style boy's academy, and a witch who thinks the monsters have softened. In the Reluctant Werewolf, Shaggy becomes a werewolf (it runs in his family, as we first saw in the Scary Scooby episode \"Moonlight Madness\"), and Dracula tries to make him lose an auto race of monsters so he can remain a werewolf and replace the old werewolf who has quit the monster lifestyle. (Shaggy also has a girlfriend, Googie, who helps him out). Obstacles along the way include the Shlockness Monster). The Boo Brothers are a ghostly Three Stooges (so many incarnations of this comedy Trio in the Scooby series!), the gang employs to catch ghosts while searching for hidden family treasure on a plantation Shaggy had inherited.\n\nA PUP NAMED SCOOBY DOO\n\nIn the late 70's we saw the cartoon fad of giving stars little sidekicks, which brought Scrappy onto the scene. Now, a decade later-- the late 80's, the new fad was now younger childhood versions of the stars. Hanna Barbera had Yo Yo Yogi, with the bear and his friends, and villains Dastardly and Muttley as teenagers, the Flintstone Kids, the Tom & Jerry Kids, and Popeye and Son. Other studios had The New Archies, The Muppet Babies, Little Rosie and Tiny Toons-- a \"new generation\" of Looney Tunes stars. So once again, the Scooby series joined the act in 1988 with A Pup named Scooby Doo-- the young Scooby, plus childhood versions of the original gang-- Shaggy, Freddy, Velma and Daphne. A new regular was added: Red Herring, the neighborhood bully. This show was basically a spoof of the original show, with frequent comedic references to such original themes as Freddy's \"Let's split up\", Scooby's \"I don't get it\", and the villains' \"I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those kids\" (Scooby harumphs and the villain remembers \"...oh, and that puppy!\") Scooby snacks now come in all kinds of flavors. Continued are the \"special announcements\" introduced in the 13 Ghosts.\n\nThe setting is an interesting mixture of both the 50's and the 80's, with early rock-type opening and chase music and modern high-tech gadgetry. Typical late 80's and 90's style animation, with tonsils and huge eyeballs popping out with the blood veins visible when startled, are frequent (this was in the spirit of the late great Tex Avery and Bob Clampett of Golden Age theatrical cartoon fame). In the first episode, they slide down a chute, like in the classic series, but now a sign on it reads \"standard cartoon chute gag\", as you would see in an Avery cartoon. Villains include the Ghostly Dog Catcher, the Headless Skateboarder, the Cheddar Monster and Chickenstein. Shaggy and Scooby are their same old selves, of course, using the same voices, but the other voices and personalities were changed. Velma is still the brain, but now barely talks at all, some episodes saying little more than her trademark \"jinkies\" (which alerts the gang that she's found a clue). Freddy and Daphne's personalities have been all but reversed. Daphne is now a loud smart-mouthed snotty type rich kid (voiced by Kellie Martin), and always calling her butler Jenkins to remove Red or clean dirt off her clothes. She also seems as a bit tom-boyish, compared to the highly feminine \"damsel in distress\" she was in the original series. She has taken a lot of the wit Velma had, and it is she who frequently reminds everyone that \"There's no such things as ghosts!\" (Martin would have been a good Velma, as she sounds a lot like the original Jaffe voice). Freddy is a ridiculously nerdy dweeb who even tops Shaggy in weirdness. He reads the \"National Exaggerator\" believing all its stories, and thus constantly fears Martian invasions and such. He comes up with ridiculous ideas and hypotheses, and even put everyone to sleep listing 200 suspects of the crime, and always suspects Red Herring, even when he is not in the story. (He's the one picked on the most by Red. The name, by the way, is an expression for a misleading clue). Otherwise, the series marked the return to the established format, the weird animation and monsters being the centerpiece. We see Shaggy's baby sister (but renamed \"Shoogie\" from the \"Aggie\" used in \"Wedding Bell Boos\"), and learn his real name is Norville! (And Scooby's full first name is \"Scoobert\"!)\n\nThree more seasons would include a few additional episodes, some of them short, at two per show, and one of them a slapstick comedy featuring Shaggy and Scooby only.\n\nTHE 90'-- DEATH AND REBIRTH\n\nAs the 80's drew to a close and the 90's drew on, Scooby ended his 20+ year run (or reign) on network TV. During this time, the older episodes moved from syndication to the USA cable network, which at the time had most of the Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears cartoons. Ted Turner, who already owned the MGM library (including Hanna and Barbera's old Tom & Jerry films) now began eyeing the HB library for the new Cartoon Network cable channel he would launch in 1992. It immediately got A Pup Named Scooby Doo (which was not apart of USA's package), but it would take another 2 years for that network's contract on the rest of the episodes to expire. In the meantime, a new Scooby feature, Scooby's Arabian Nights was released on videocassette in 1994, but this was more a Yogi and Friends story being told by Shaggy and Scooby, than it was a Scooby story. It went largely unnoticed.\n\nUpon Turner's acquisition of the entire Scooby series, new promotionals were produced, featuring Don Messick resuming his role as Scooby advertising his arrival on the \"Rartoon Retwork\". In this early one, Shaggy, shouting \"Scooby Doo, Where are you?\", had a different voice. But soon enough, Casey Kasem returned; the most notable promo being the Pulp Fiction style piece with Shaggy and Droopy Dog discussing Cartoon Network around the world. With the increasing popularity of computer rotoscoping of animated cells, (copying them off of cartoons and pasting them onto new backgrounds) Scooby was also included on almost every other promo produced for the network, such as the Cartoon Network rap, the CGI backgrounded Cartoon Network Library, and the excellent \"Boo Boo, Baba, Dee Dee\". Another promo linked Velma to every other cartoon, making her \"the center of the Cartoon Universe\", (Betty Rubble --→ Judy Jetson (same exercises) --→ Astro --→ Scooby --→ Velma; Brainy Smurf --→ Azrael --→ Sebastian --→ The Pussycats --→ Alan → Freddy --→ Velma; Space Ghost --→ Zorak, who was reused on an episode of Jabberjaw, with Clamhead, who looks like Shaggy --→ Velma). By now, Scooby was really on the upswing again. The network began airing the show several times a day, and there were still Turner's other networks, TBS and TNT (which had cartoons until Fall, 1998). An annual tradition developed with a 25 hour marathon of Scooby (the 25 original episodes played one after the other, twice) during daylight savings time weekend, and then plenty were played right after that on Halloween. (There have also been Scooby Movie marathons). Two years in a row, there was a \"Dog Bowl\" on Super Bowl weekend, in which various dog cartoons would be played, and the \"winner\" would be chosen by callers. Scooby won both years, rendering any future \"Dog Bowls\" unnecessary. The darkest moment came in October of 1997, when Don Messick, Scooby's voice, died. In the style of the \"Silence\" animation poster, showing Looney Tunes characters mourning the death of Mel Blanc, their voice, Warner Brothers, by now the owner of Turner/HB, put out one with Shaggy and Scooby mourning Messick. (This understandably drew criticism, since it ignored all the other cartoon stars voiced by Messick.).\n\nScooby would never be quite the same again. But as it is always darkest before dawn, a revival of 70's nostalgia in the late 90's (just like the 50's nostalgia in the 70's; 60's nostalgia in the 80's-- it's a 20 year cycle as the children of those decades grow up and become nostalgic about their young lives) further elevated Scooby back into the limelight. New animation was on the way, and a new voice would soon take over. One of Turner's original visions for the Cartoon Network was \"World Premiere Toons\". The Hanna Barbera studios (later renamed Cartoon Network Studios) brought in a bright new generation of young cartoon directors and animators who created new 7 minute shorts. It was hailed as a throwback to the golden age of theatrical cartoons, where there was freedom from the demands of a Saturday morning network series schedule to allow total creativity. Whichever cartoons were well received soon became new series. One of those series, Johnny Bravo, would include a spoof of the Scooby mystery format that featured the original gang. Kasem, Welker and North returned, though the new Scooby and Velma voices (by Scott Innes and B.J Ward) were no where near the original. The episode even featured a musical chase sequence, reminiscent of the second season (1970) episodes. At the end, several masks were pulled off of the \"ghostly gardener\", revealing old characters Professor Hyde White (though, he wasn't a villain!), Harry the Hypnotist, Don Knotts, Bigfoot (from the Laurel & Hardy episode), and Joe Barbera (Bravo: \"Who's that?\") (It turns out to be Bravo's aunt, trying to scare him out of the house). Also are hints of what cynical 90's fans had been suspecting: romantic involvement between Fred and Daphne (since they are the ones who usually go together on split-ups). She treated Bravo coldly just like all of the other women he hits on. But he and Velma liked each other, as was elaborated on in a later CN promotional. Other promotionals featured the gang as well, such as them waiting for Velma to find her orange socks. Burger King sold Scooby toys, and produced a commercial featuring a live action Mystery Machine driven by an animated Shaggy. (You could even start to see vans painted as the Mystery Machine around this time).\n\nLook out for a live Mystery Machine on a street near you!\n\nHe was really back on a roll now, and a new full-length videocassette feature, Scooby on Zombie's Island, quickly followed. For some reason, Casey Kasem and Heather North bowed out at this point, leaving Frank Welker (Freddy) as the last original voice. (Rumor has it that Kasem stopped playing the meat-loving Shaggy because of a falling out with WB over the afroementioned Burger King ad campaign due to his vegetarianism. He did return to play Robin of Batman fame in a promo about cartoon sidekicks, though). The new Shaggy voice, by Billy West, of Ren & Stimpy, was at times pretty good (especially in the deep whispering and high tone, where it sounded just like the original), but at other times was pitched wrong. The new Daphne (Mary Kay Bergman) was fairly OK.\n\nThis movie, and the ones after it, do not really have the feel of the original series. Perhaps, the real monsters and the occult atmosphere are what the producers feel is the essence of the whole Scooby mystery format. It was even noticed that the animation looks more WB than HB. Like the various Justice League related movies and series being produced beginning at this time, (and probably inspired by them) the new Scooby animation would not have the cartoony music and sound effects of earlier animation, but would sound more like standard non-animated features. But despite the big changes in voice and animation, many Scooby fans were satisfied, feeling the original spirit of the show was back, because it was the whole gang and no Scrappy.\n\nThe mystery Machine is a more modern mini-van now (with side windows), but painted in the original colors. Picking up on ideas introduced in \"Bravo Dooby Doo\", Freddy and Daphne get jealous when they meet other men/women. This relationship between those two would become a new pattern in most new productions. Daphne, a modern woman, does a talk show \"Coast to Coast\", and after telling many stories of unmasking phony ghosts, wants to catch a real one. Velma sells mysteries (novels), which she says is harder than solving them. Shaggy and Scooby are shiftless menial workers who have trouble keeping jobs. The gang gets back together, and are told of a real haunted house on Moonstone island in Louisiana, and go and investigate. Freddy figures it's just someone trying to scare kids away, and there are plenty of references to \"mechanical claws\", \"holograms\" and all the other phony \"haunting\" gadgets they were so familiar with. They even try to pull \"masks\" off of some zombies, and find that they are real.\n\nBefore and after the release of the movie, Scooby CN bumpers exploded, with a new set appearing seemingly every few weeks. (They all featured the intro to Carl Stalling's \"Powerhouse\" piece from the 1940's Looney Tunes, which then led into the original Scooby title theme. This in fact was done on all other cartoons as well, signaling that the Turner/HB/MGM library has been grafted into the Warner Brothers family.) Ones released right after the movie featured Freddy and the new Shaggy with \"We'll be right back\" messages reminiscent of the long forgotten original CBS bumpers with Freddy and Shaggy (\"Don't fly the coop, we'll be right back with the troops\"; Don't go away, we'll be right back in a flash\").\n\nLess than a month later, on Halloween, 1998, the movie would premiere on CN's Cartoon Theatre. (CN had recently acquired the Hanna Barbera Superstar 10, including the other 3 Scooby features from the Disney Channel, plus Scooby's Arabian Knights, which all were airing on this program.). New promotionals for the Network's broadcast of Zombie Island featured Shaggy as a prowler/crank phone caller harassing Daphne at home. A week before Halloween, on the daylight savings time marathon, new voices and reused animation (and some new drawings) were framed into 8 \"interviews\" entitled \"TMK\" (Those Meddling Kids). They featured the gang sharing facts about themselves and each other, and pictures from childhood. In the first \"case\", we see it was Daphne's father who originally financed the gang, and drove them around in his car (\"Seven Days a Week\" playing on the radio). When he forbids her to go into a haunted house, the gang decided to travel on their own. The next 5 cases feature each of the 5 members. The next case after those interview various captured villains, and the final one is \"the Gang, Reunited\" (a summary). In all of these, we learn that it was Shaggy who found the Mystery Machine, Velma has won dozens of achievement awards and inspired the gang with her \"jinkies\" call, and Daphne claims to be just as smart as her, getting all A's in school. She early on aspired to be a crime solver (as well as fashion model) to the shock of her parents. She and Freddy also deny their romantic involvement, which Scooby gives away by blowing kisses. These segments originally aired during the commercials during that marathon, and afterwards had been used as bumpers at the end of Scooby programs.\n\nScooby Turns 30 and enters New Millennium with more DTV movies\n\nFor Scooby's 30th anniversary in 1999, a second new feature was released, \"Scooby and the Witch's Ghost\", also for videocassette in the Fall, and aired on the Network around Halloween. West left leaving Innes to take over Shaggy's voice. It sounded pretty much the same, just having too much of a rough edge compared to the original.\n\nLeading up to this is \"The Scooby Doo Project\", including a 24 hour marathon of original episodes one weekend, followed by the five prior 2 hour movies the next, and even a Scrappy Doo marathon. This year, in place of the \"TMK\" segments, were bits parodying the movie \"Blair Witch Project\". The animated gang drives the real life Mystery Machine around in the real world interviewing real people in the area about strange goings on. They camp out in an old cemetery in the forest and encounter a monster (actually reused from a bumper introduced years before). All of this was advertized by parts of some of the bits, plus \"footage\" of the sheriff (also live action) having found all of the episodes in a briefcase and the abandoned Mystery Machine in the woods. Around this time, General Mills also added Scooby, Shaggy and Mystery Machine marshmallows to its \"monster cereals\": Count Chocula/Franken Berry/Boo Berry. Cartoon Network also celebrated by adding a four hour Saturday block (Noon-4) during the summer, featuring two original episodes, two Scooby & Scrappy, one Comedy Movie, New Scooby Doo Mystery, and A Pup Named Scooby. (This was also done the following summer). Many CN viewers began crying \"enough Scooby already\", especially fans of anime and action-adventure, which they felt had been crowded out for Scooby or \"Cartoon Cartoons\" (the former \"World Premiere Toon\" series). Scooby was now shown more than any other cartoon, beside the new cartoons, leading some to proclaim it the \"Scooby Doo Network\").\n\nScooby entered the new millennium with another animated feature, \"Scooby and the Alien Invaders\" the following Fall. He even won the Cartoon Network's 2000 cartoon Presidential election! All of his movies ran as \"Presidential Movies for the People\" on July 4th weekend. In Fall 2001, another videocassette movie was released \"Scooby's Cyber Chase\" about the gang getting trapped inside a computer. It was a pretty interesting story, in which they help a college computer scientist who has made a game featuring the gang, and is then troubled by a living \"virus\" monster who traps the gang inside the program. There have to play several levels, in which they must find the box of Scooby snacks, amidst being challenged by the virus. On the final stage, they meet their digital selves, who wear the original outfits except for Shaggy who has the orange T-shirt from the late 80's. Their colors are also duller, like the old series. They also are chased by five villains from the 70's Creeper, Jaguaro, Gator Ghoul, Iron Face and the Tar Monster, who are now \"real\" and not disguised. (It was supposed to be \"every villain we've ever captured\". It would have been nice if they had put in more of them, especially from the more classical episodes). Bergman had died and was replaced, by Grey DeLisle.\n\nFor the Halloween Marathon, a new \"mystery\" was created, \"Night of the Living Doo\", which was a \"Comedy Movie\" parody starring an animated Gary Coleman, David Cross and the band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (Both shown in the flashlight title screen taken from the Comedy Movies) and a cameo by Mark Hamill. Jabberjaw winds up as the villain, jealous of all the attention Scooby got instead of him. It aired in parts as the commercial bumpers, then was broadcast whole at 11:30 pm. The Cyber Chase movie was shown the weekend after Thanksgiving. With all of this, the greatest moments were still yet to come.\n\nWHAT'S NEW, SCOOBY DOO? Live Action Movie and new series finally arrive for 2002!\n\nNext in line was a live action feature, following the Flintstones and various other cartoons (the late 90's/millennium fad) which was filmed in Australia, and released June 14th 2002. It has live actors for the gang, and a computer amimated Scooby. Real life lovers Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar played Fred and Daphne. Matthew Liliard plays Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini plays Velma. The voices were done reasonably well. The CGI Scooby fit in with the live action excellently, though his somewhat sharper looking face, smaller recessed eyes (with shadows), and realistic pointy dog teeth make him look a bit too \"real\", and more like a Doberman Pinscher.\n\nOf course, you saw promotionals of the movie everywhere (no longer just on Cartoon Network), along with all the posters, billboards, internet ads, etc. in the months leading up to its release. The movie also has a soundtrack, of course. Scooby had truly captured the entertainment world this year. Anticipating the added Scooby-mania, the Kids WB network began playing the classic series, bringing Scooby back to regular broadcast (\"air\") television for the first time in over a decade. (Hour long Movies were once again showed in 2 parts). In the beginning, Casey Kasem even did the promotionals for the show! This version featured new popup information, such as countdowns to important clues, the gang's sayings or traits (\"zoinks\", \"jinkies\", Velma losing her glasses, etc.) or other significant information, and even viewer comments. Cartoon Network's new retro-oriented Boomerang channel launched and became another vehicle of the Scooby series.\n\nOf course, this movie marked the ultimate triumph of the anti-Scrappy sentiment, as somewhere late in the development, writer James Gunn, who has pointedly stated his detest for the character, decided to add Scrappy to the script as the villain, who in a highly uncharacteristic fashion, rails against and tries to >KILL Scooby. He's now the one to utter: \"I would have gotten away with it too, if it werent for you meddling sons of-[cell door slams!\". Where Scrappy had been totally ignored in previous productions (and then began to slowly creep into some CN promotions with negative connotations, such as \"The Scooby Doo Project\" interstitials, and The \"Scrappy Stinks\" web game), this would now set a trend of negative references to him being thrown into many new productions (both within the Scooby franchise, and in external comedy spoofs) to come.\n\nOne of these other productions was the \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\" show episode \"Shaggy Busted\", which plays on the \"Shaggy-as-drugged-out\" theme. (Actual clips of the old series showing things like clouds of dust in the Mystery Machine are taken as \"evidence\" of drug use). Snausages introduced an actual \"Scooby Snacks\" brand of dog treats, with beef flavor Bone, cheese flavor Cheese, chicken flavor Drumstick, and bacon flavor Pizza shaped treats! Kelloggs introduced Scooby Doo Cinnamon Marshmallow cereal around the same time as well.\n\nAnd that still was not all! A rumored new series debuted in the Fall! There was a lot of great news!\n\n13 episodes of \"What's New Scooby Doo\" aired on Kids WB, plus a Christmas special. To a large extent, it is similar to the animated movies. Animation is a cross between the new WB style and the classic HB style. Modern cultural references are still present, such as Velma's laptop and Daphne's cellphone. Some criticized this, but remember, the gang always had the latest technology of the day (such as all the Mystery Machine radar equipment in Decoy for a Dognapper). In at least one instance it came quite in handy. When Daphne gets lost, Fred and Velma go off to search the old fashioned way, while Shaggy suddenly gets the idea to phone her cell, thus leading him right to her. This is the type of ingenuity that made the old series so good.\n\nThere was really a great effort in creating an element of surprise in revealing who the culprits are. One time, Velma gets a person to confess; he is taken away, the gang drives off (with Shaggy and Scooby digging into the food, as usual), and then suddenly it dawns on Velma that that wasn't the culprit after all, and one later clue they had found wasn't accounted for. They drive back and catch the real cuprit in action. Some of the villains seem lame, however some are reminiscent of the classic episodes, while some stories overdo it and come across as ripoffs (the first episode seems to be a rehash of \"That's Snow Ghost\" for example).\n\nThe gang has pretty much regained their original outfits, with a couple of modifications. Fred's sweater has a thick horizontal blue stripe, and gone is the ascot. (a promotional for the shows rebroadcast on Cartoon Network later, would play on this). Gone also is Daphne's green scarf and purple stockings, and the dress is similar except that the top opens like a robe. Velma's skirt has only a single pleat in the front, and her hair seems a bit ruffled (a modern style now).\n\nThe Mystery Machine is once again the original van, not the minivan of the movies. One episode involves its previous owners, a musical group called the \"Mystery Kids\" whose tour bus it was.\n\nThe best news was that Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, and Welker does both Fred and Scooby! (to this day). Welker's Scooby sounds markedly better on sounds such as giggling and \"huh\". Mindy Cohn from \"The Facts of Life\" took over as Velma. She was a logical choice, since Cohn had a similar \"inflection\" as the original Jaffe voice. Grey DeLisle continued to do Daphne. As she is mostly about \"looks\" rather than speech, the differences of voices for her haven't been as detrimental. She is always pretty much herself no matter who plays her.\n\nIt seems many of the episodes had the makings of classic Scooby type adventures, but the thing that needed the most improvement was the music score. Score was very important in creating the feel of the original, and even some of the later shows, such as the 83-4 season, the Superstar 10 movies and even A Pup Named Scooby created new score that fit well for a \"spooky mystery\" feel. The score used in the new series is standard modern cartoon score similar to the movies and other action cartoons. Some episodes do use remakes of a couple of the original pieces, but these are scattered and not enough to color the episode. There were also musical chase scores, and this was usually hard rock.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby marked his official move from Cartoon Network to Boomerang with a killer 368 hour marathon of every Scooby episode from 1969 to 1991, spread over four weekends in October '02! (originally entitled \"Much Ado about Scooby\", and repeated subsequent Octobers under other names). Scooby was afterwards down to only two daily slots on CN, -an hour block in the morning entitled \"Scooby Universe\" of two half hour programs, one of which was repeated late nights followed by an hour long Comedy Movie; but was then shown more on Boomerang.\n\nHowever, if the new series was not quite satisfying, then the greatest news yet was to come! The next animated feature Legend of Vampire Rock was released the following Spring, and both Heather North and at long last, even NICOLE JAFFE had returned! Plus the return of the old H-B sound effects and remakes of the original music cues, and art & background style. This was the best thing to happen to Scooby in 30 years; in theory, an almost complete return to the spirit of the original that many fans had been dying for! The gang had their original outfits back, as well as the original Mystery Machine and people's faces are generally drawn as they would have been in the original. The vampire however, is a typical new style monster (like in the other movies) that looks nothing like the classic mysteries. Sort of like \"Moon Monster Extreme\". And there is still the great emphasis on action and effects that have colored most new productions.\n\nShaggy and Scooby play their own video game (based on \"What a Night for a Knight\") in one of those new drop down LCD car TV screens, and Velma still has her laptop. So there is something for everyone; both fans of the old and new styles.\n\nA second animated movie after that, \"Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico\" was released October '03, following the same pattern, but seemed a bit better. The Chupacabra (set in Mexico, instead of Puerto Rico where the real legend is from. A Dexter episode had it set in South America) looks like the Jaguaro with a new head. Original score is recreated with a mexican flavor, some of the 1968 and a couple of older pieces (including one that was never used in Scooby) are recreated as well. The movie begins with the gang having an IM conversation on their laptops, where they decide to go to Mexico.\n\nAlso was a new season of What's New Scooby Doo and the live action sequel \"Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed\". This sequel was also better then the first live action movie, and like \"the Cyber Chase\" featured comebacks of several of the old villains (still heavy on the \"Scooby Doo Show\" era; nil on the Scooby Doo Movies, but at least there were more from the original series this time). One episode of this new season of the series, \"Uncle Scooby and Antarctica\" raised questions among internet posters of whether Scrappy was making an appearance. But it actually turned out to refer to a group of little penguins who called Scooby \"uncle\". (The story ironically was similar to the Scrappy episode \"South Pole Vault\", in which Scooby befriended a penguin). Soon, What's New Scooby Doo made it's move to Cartoon Network, airing in Cartoon, Cartoon Fridays, and a couple of other places. Still later, it finally moved to Boomerang, which created a new bumper for it, showing the gang riding around in a toy Mystery Machine (with Scrappy banished to the back), followed by a \"B\" logo on wheels, colored like the Mystery Machine. On Kids WB, a third season would follow in 2004, for a total of 42 episodes. (One even reused A Pup Named Scooby Doo version of the characters, in a look back at the gang's youth). This also marked Scooby's entry into the Guinness Book of World Records for having the most episodes of an animated franchise!\n\nThe next animated movie \"Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster\" was released in 2004, and reverts back to the \"What's New Scooby Doo\" voice cast, and the other original references such as the outfits and score cues of the previous two videos are dropped for the new style again. So this and the animated movies afterward are basically 90 minute \"What's New Scooby Doo\" episodes. The animated movies became the regular consistent venue for new Scooby stories, with about 29 released over a 20 year period!\n\nSURPRISE: Another Total Revamping\n\nJust as it seemed Scooby might finally be winding down, word of a totally new Scooby series for Sept. 2006 suddenly begins surfacing only a few months before. \"Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get A Clue\" would be produced for the Kids WB Saturday morning block, now on the new CW network formed by the merger of UPN and WB. (Since it is half owned by CBS, which had acquired UPN in an earlier merger, Scooby has in a \"half-way\" sense returned to his original network roots!)\n\nFans had decades earlier received a shock when Scrappy was added and then the format was completely revamped with the removal of Fred and the girls and the mystery premise. This had been the biggest change in the series ever, which many have loathed to this day. This was followed by the biggest character redesign: the conversion of the gang to pre-teens for a Pup Named Scooby Doo. Afterwards, the characters were restored to original form, but with new style drawings (with shadowing on the faces, etc), animation, backgrounds, outfits and voices. It felt a bit different, but still, Scooby had come full circle, and fans were happy to have the original format back! This new change tops all of that put together, and was totally different from anything we had ever seen! It figures, when you look at the increasing reuse of villain and story ideas of the DTV's and even \"What's New Scooby Doo\" and realize that the writers had once again run out of ideas, as had happened nearly 3 decades earlier when the first major change was made. But just as then, it is better to have all new ideas, then endless rehashes of old ones.\n\nThe premise is that one of Shaggy's rich relatives (he has a bunch of them, as we have seen over the years) has disappeared and left him his mansion and fortune. The villain, Dr. Phinneas Phibes is based on Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers movies; and with his crazy looking fliptop hairpiece looks like a cross between him and old Josie villains such as Greenthumb. He is supposed to be the perennial evil scientst \"driven mad by all my failures in science\". For his henchmen, Field Agents 1-13 (addressed by their numbers), think of grownup knockoffs of Cartoon Network's Codename: Kids Next Door. (Some of the score is even like what you would hear on CKND).\n\nSo the basic plotline of the show is Phibes either sending his agents to try to destroy Shaggy and Scooby and get from them the formula, or Albert sending Shaggy and Scooby to various locations to foil Phibes' latest plots, which usually involves capturing scientists. The agents bungle and bicker amongst each other (and Phibes, when he is present), for the comedy effect. The formula, they quickly figure out in first episode \"Shags to Riches\", is in a batch of \"New Improved\" Scooby Snacks, which in this instance turns Scooby invisible; allowing him to foil the bad guys. They last until digested, indicated by a loud burp. The Mystery Machine is not only changed again (though the original one is used for scene changes in the first episode) but now it is also given transforming capabilities, sort of like the Chan Clan van.\n\nFred and the Girls only make a few appearances, such as a the end of the pilot, where they meet in a diner and discuss whether Shaggy and Scooby even need them to help solve cases anymore! They do promise they can \"always be be counted on for help\", but basically, Shaggy and Scooby have \"grown up\" and shown that they \"have what it takes\", to work on their own for awhile, or at least until they find Uncle Albert. So the series in that respect is like a cross between the Uncle Fearless episodes, and the \"New Scooby Doo Mysteries\" show two seasons later.\n\nThe biggest change of all is the complete redesign of the characters and backgrounds. They appear to be based largely on the live action movies, with small eyes for Scooby, updated hairstyles, and outfits (except for Velma who has her original outfit). Daphne in particular looks a lot like Sarah Michelle Gellar, the live action counterpart. Both girls have the pointed chins most new cartoon females have taken on, due to the influence of anime in American animation, and otherwise there are more new style rough edges drawn on the characters, such as the hair. Gone is the \"What's New Scooy Doo\" style realistic look, in favor of a sharp 2D style on the characters and most background objects, like you would find on Codename: Kids Next door and other new, less serious cartoons. Overall, it also resembles somewhat the Paper Mario game graphics. The opening theme is a new Thrash style with a rhythm not much different from the previous series.\n\nThe voices are the same for Scooby, Freddy and the Girls as the previous show, but Shaggy is now voiced by Scott Menville (who voiced Red Herring from A Pup Named Scooby). It basically resembles all the other Shaggy's compared to Kasem, who apparently left again because of increased references to Shaggy being a meat-eater. He voices Uncle Albert, however. The series would continue for a second season, with a surprising conclusion as Uncle Albert is found.\n\nNew series and redesigns pick up to the present!\n\nBut this still was not the end of it! New productions would now focus once again, on the gang's past, this time, to the period between A Pup Named Scooby Doo and the original show. This was sparked off by the 3rd live action movie, Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins (2009) (which ended up as made for TV, rather than theatrical). This one covers their high school days in Coolsville, and how they started solving mysteries together. It was the most-watched telecast in Cartoon Network history with 6.1 million viewers on September 13, 2009. Its followup was Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster (2010) So now, in addition to new animated series and movies, live action movies also became a series.\n\nSo following this new direction, we would get another reavamping that once again tried to get back to basics. The next series, in 2010, would be Scooby Doo, Mystery Incorporated (this by now becoming the gang's official name), a serialized concept which covers the gang, after starting out solving mysteries in a town called Crystal Cove, instead of Coolsville. Looming behind everything is the mysterious \"Mister E\". The romance has its peak here, as not only are Fred and Daphne made a couple (though Fred is clueless about it), but even Shaggy and Velma were toyed with at one point, but Shaggy clearly was more into food and Scooby. Showing how \"A Pup Named Scooby\" never completely wore off for Fred, one episode, \"Revenge of the Man Crab\", which goes as far as to have him actually try to play an eight track tape cartridge on a record turntable! Vincent Van Ghoul makes appearances, and the gang looks at statues of him, Flim Flam and Scrappy, and vow never to speak of the latter! (Ironic how he was hated this much to begin with for \"changing the show\", in light of what has been done with Freddy, in addition to the romance!) Outfits are original, and the character design is like a cross between Get a Clue and What's New Scooby Doo with the plain textured angular face designs. This series ran for two seasons, for a total of 52 episodes.\n\nOn the DTV scene, we got \"Lego Scooby-Doo! (Haunted Hollywood)\" in 2016, using actual Lego block animation!\n\nNext after this was Be Cool, Scooby Doo (2017) It once again features a radical new design of characters, by Zac Moncrief, resembling other modern cartoon characters, such as Family Guy, which he had directed. (The clothes are again original, however). More comedic than preceding shows, Daphne is particularly wacky in this one, like wearing a fake beard in one episode. It maintains the new continuity with the other productions, as it covers when they decide to travel during their last summer break together.\n\n2018 brought Daphne and Velma's own live action movie, released on DVD.\n\nFinally, Scooby's golden anniversary arrived, 2019, with Scooby Doo and Guess Who! Essentially a revival of The Scooby Comedy Movies featuring special guests. Included are another crossover with Batman (this time, in his \"Dark Knight\" form), and also Wonder Woman. Fellow cartoons stars include Funky Phantom (the two gangs are antagonistic to each other, however) and Mr. Peebles and Magilla Gorilla (the latter only grunts like an ape, rather than talking). Other fictional characters were Sherlock Holmes and Steve Urkel, and real life celebrities included Weird Al Yankovic and Wanda Sykes (who was on the Magilla episode, so some guests were doubled). The intro is more of a remake of \"Scooby Doo Where Are You\" rather than \"Scooby Doo Comedy Movies\", and the background graphics are very crisp and 3D-like at times.\n\nAlso, realizing that only 12 ghosts had been captured in the \"13 Ghosts\" series (of the 13 episodes, the first one had them released, and the remaining 12 had one \"chest demon\" captured each), they aimed to close this hole with Scooby Doo and the Curse of the 13th Ghost\n\nSo both Vincent and a grown Flim Flam return, with the whole gang this time, and when Flim Flam asks \"Where's Scrappy?\", Velma doesn't know what he's talking about, while the others give each other this funny look. (If he was so bad as established by the first live action movie, she certainly knew who he was then!). Just as bad, the 13th ghost turned out to be a standard fake ghost, where the others were real!\n\nMay, 2020 saw the release of \"Scoob\", which was an all CGI feature. Slated for theatrical release, the COVID-19 pandemic that closed all theaters had it released digitally instead. The designs this time around look much better than on the first movie. Scooby looks truly like a 3D version of his cartoon self. The story covers how Shaggy and Scooby met; Shaggy naming Scooby after the snacks, which already existed under that name. They then meet Feed and the girls and enter a haunted house during Halloween trick or treating, and capture a fake ghost, leading them to form the mystery solving gang. Dick Dastardly and Mutteley are in on it, and Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Captain Caveman and one of the Teen Angels appear as well, along with Simon Cowell as himself!\n\nScooby has come a long way across the last half century. He has now taken his permanent place as one of the greatest icons of modern culture!\n\nComplete Episode Guide"
