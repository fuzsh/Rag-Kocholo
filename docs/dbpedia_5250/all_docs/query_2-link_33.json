At the age of 15, Messick already knew he wanted to be a voice actor, and performed the character voices and sound effects for a local radio station, WCAO. In 1944, Messick gained his first real voice-acting job, voicing Raggedy Andy and Farmer Seedling on The Raggedy Ann Radio Showâ€‹. In 1957, Don was hired as a voice actor at Hanna-Barbera Productions after he was recommended by his friend Daws Butler. While there, Don voiced several famous cartoon characters, including Astro, Boo-Boo Bear, Ranger Smith, Atom Ant and Mr. Peebles.\n\nIn 1969, Don was cast as the role of Scooby-Doo. He continued to voice Scooby through all of the original series, from 1969-1995. He also took on the role of Scooby's nephew Scrappy-Doo, after his previous voice actor Lennie Weinrib was fired for demanding an outrageous salary increase. In 1996, Don Messick suffered a major stroke while recording Dr. Benton Quest's voice for Jonny Quest, and was rushed to the emergency room. Don survived the stroke, which was caused by his excessive smoking earlier in life. Don retired from voice acting shortly after, only to suffer another fatal stroke in 1997.\n\nHadley Kay (1997)\n\nHadley Kay was born in 1973 in Toronto, Canada. At only six years old, Kay starred alongside Bill Murray in the comedy film Meatballs. After Messick died, Hanna-Barbera hired him to voice Scooby in the Johnny Bravo crossover \"Bravo Dooby Doo,\" as well as Scooby's two brief cameos in Johnny Bravo, \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" and another commercial short. Hadley Kay only voiced Scooby in 1997, and the role was handed over to Scott Innes in 1998.\n\nScott Innes (1998-2001)\n\nScott Innes was born in 1966 in Poplar Bluff, Missouri.

After Shaggy's previous voice actor Billy West left to pursue other projects, Innes also became the voice of Shaggy in Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyber Chase, The Scooby-Doo Project and Night of the Living Doo, in addition to commercials and video games. Additionally, Innes provided the voice of Scrappy-Doo in the first live action film.

Kasem continued to juggle his radio career and being the voice of Shaggy, while also continuing his acting career on other shows. In 1995, Casey Kasem got into a heated argument over voicing Shaggy in a McDonald's commercial, because trying to promote eating meat to children was strictly against his vegetarian lifestyle. During this time, Billy West and Scott Innes filled in as the voice of Shaggy while negotiations were being worked out with Kasem. In 2002, Casey Kasem agreed to come back as the voice of Shaggy, requesting that the studio have Shaggy also subtly become a vegetarian and not have him eat meat in the show.

Beginning with Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get A Clue! in 2006, Kasem did not voice Shaggy except in the yearly DTV films.

Sarah provides a more witty, sarcastic side of Velma and in an interview with IconVsIcon, says she wants audiences to take this away from her version of Velma. \"What I want girls to take away from this film is that they can do anything! This is a really good film in that it shows two young, strong females who arenâ€™t constantly talking about boys or are damsels in distress who are waiting for someone to rescue them. They are proactive and fast-thinking. They are very real characters who are scared at times but find their strength and inner courage to keep moving forward and kind of control their own destiny. I think thatâ€™s a really important message in the media right now for young females because, historically, we havenâ€™t seen much of it.\"\n\nGina Rodriguez (2020)\n\nGina Rodriguez is an American actress born in Los Angeles, California on July 30, 1984.
