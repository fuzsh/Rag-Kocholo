        "text": "20 Actors Who Were So Beloved Voicing Characters, They Were Then Cast In The Live-Action Adaptations\n\nThe original voice actor behind Wilma from The Flintstones is actually hidden in the 1994 live-action movie.\n\n1. First, Katee Sackhoff voiced Bo-Katan in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels, so when it came time to cast the character for The Mandalorian, Katee was offered the role.\n\n2. Matt Lanter voiced Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Tales of the Jedi, and more. He made a cameo in The Mandalorian during Season 1 when he played Lant Davan, a New Republic soldier.\n\n3. Ming-Na Wen, who voiced Mulan in the original animated film, appeared as an \"esteemed guest\" who introduced Mulan to the emperor in the live-action remake of Mulan.\n\n4. Paige O'Hara, who voiced and did the singing for Belle in Disney's animated Beauty and the Beast, made an appearance in Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration. She played the woman who owned the bookshop and gifted Belle her favorite book.\n\n5. Jodi Benson voiced and did the singing for Ariel in the 1989 Disney movie The Little Mermaid. In the recent live-action film, she can be seen giving Ariel a fork during the market place scene — a literal passing of the baton.\n\n6. James Earl Jones lent his iconic voice to The Lion King when he portrayed Mufasa. His performance was so iconic that when Disney made the live-action version in 2019, James was brought back to play Mufasa once again.\n\n7. Jean Vander Pyl, who voiced Wilma in the original The Flintstones animated series, made an appearance in the 1994 live-action movie. She played Mrs. Feldspar, Fred's former teacher who attends his surprise party.\n\n8. Troy Baker, who voiced and did the motion capture for Joel in The Last of Us video games, can be seen in Episode 8 as James, David's right-hand man and the one Ellie brutally stabs while escaping David's compound.\n\n9. Ashley Johnson, who voiced and did the motion capture for Ellie in The Last of Us video games, played Ellie's mom Anna in the Season 1 finale.\n\n10. Merle Dandridge voiced and did the motion capture for Marlene in The Last of Us Part I video game, so when it came time to cast the character for the TV series, Merle was offered the role.\n\n11. Jeffrey Pierce, who voiced and did the motion capture for Tommy in The Last of Us video games, was brought in to play Perry, Kathleen's right-hand man in Kansas City, in The Last of Us TV show.\n\n12. In The Last of Us Episode 9, Laura Bailey, who is known for playing Abby in The Last of Us Part II video game, was hidden as a nurse in the hospital room where Ellie is almost operated on.\n\n13. Kevin Conroy voiced Batman in various animated projects starting with the beloved Batman: The Animated Series. He appeared as Bruce Wayne/Batman from another Earth in an episode of Batwoman, as part of the massive Arrowverse crossover event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\"\n\n14. Ikue Ōtani, who is best known for voicing Pikachu in various Pokémon films, shows, and video games, actually voiced Det. Pikachu in the movie Detective Pikachu. Her voice can be heard as Pikachu's \"normal voice,\" aka what the citizens of Ryme City hear besides Tim, who hears Pikachu as voiced by Ryan Reynolds.\n\n15. Nolan North, who voiced and did the motion capture for Nathan Drake in the Uncharted video games, made a cameo in the live-action movie starring Tom Holland. He can be seen as a hotel guest sitting on a beach, who talks to Nate and Chloe after they wash up on shore.\n\n16. Tara Strong voices Harley Quinn in various animated shows, movies, and video games, so when it came time to make a nod to the character in a Suicide Squad episode of The CW's Arrow, Tara provided the voice. She was credited as \"Deranged Squad Female.\"\n\n17. Jim Cummings has provided the voices for Winnie the Pooh and Tigger since the late '80s, so when Disney brought the characters to life in the live-action Christopher Robin, Jim was naturally asked to do their voices.\n\n18. Ashley Eckstein, who voiced Ahsoka Tano in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Tales of the Jedi, various video games, and more made a quick voice cameo in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. She can be heard reprising the role of Ahsoka when Rey hears various past Jedi.\n\n19. Christopher Britton, who voiced Soichiro Yagami in the English dub of the anime series Death Note, made a cameo in the 2017 Netflix live-action movie as Aaron Peltz, one of Light's victims.\n\n20. And finally, in a reverse of the previous examples, Matthew Lillard, who notably played Shaggy in both live-action Scooby Doo movies, was asked to voice Shaggy in various animated films and shows after Casey Kasem retired from the role before his death.\n\nWe can't fit everyone into one post, so which other voice actors were you glad to see play a role in live-action adaptations?
