For other uses, see Scooby-Doo and the Pirate (disambiguation)\n\nScooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy! is the tenth in a series of direct-to-video films based upon Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons. It was released on DVD on September 19, 2006.\n\nPremise[]\n\nThe Mystery, Inc. gang are caught in the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, while vacationing on a cruise, courtesy of Fred's parents for his birthday.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nAstrocartographer, Rupert Garcia, is in his quarters, trying to make sense of an old, bizarre star map which he recently acquired. The ship sails into a sinister fog, and is soon engulfed. A ghostly pirate brig appears next to the ship, and zombie pirates swarm the ship. The crew disappears while Garcia hides in his quarters with the star map. The villainous Captain Skunkbeard enters the quarters, along with his first mate, the aptly named Woodenleg Wally. The pirates cannot find Garcia, who overhears that the pirates are looking for him and the map. The pirates give up the search and scuttle the ship, and return to their brig and disappear into the fog. Garcia escapes to a life raft, and is marooned on the open sea.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain characters:\n\nMystery Inc.\n\nScooby-Doo\n\nShaggy Rogers\n\nFred Jones\n\nVelma Dinkley\n\nDaphne Blake\n\nSupporting characters:\n\nRupert Garcia (only appearance)\n\nSkip Jones (only appearance)\n\nPeggy Jones (only appearance)\n\nVillains:\n\nAlien (only appearance)(Captain Crothers's disguise)\n\nSea Witch (only appearance)(Sunny St. Cloud's disguise)\n\nCaptain Skunkbeard (only appearance)(Biff Wellington's disguise)\n\nBiff Wellington (only appearance)\n\nWoodenleg Wally (only appearance)(Mr. Mysterio's disguise)\n\nMr. Mysterio (only appearance)\n\nCaptain Skunkbeard's miscellaneous crew (only appearance)(Miscellaneous crew and passengers' disguise)\n\nSea Salt Sally (only appearance)(Peggy Jones' disguise)\n\nPeggy Jones (hypnotized)(redeemed)\n\nSkunkbeard's lookout (only appearance)(Sunny St. Cloud's disguise)\n\nSunny St. Cloud (hypnotized)(redeemed)\n\nCaptain Crothers (hypnotized)(redeemed)\n\nMiscellaneous crew and passengers (hypnotized)(redeemed)\n\nOther characters:\n\nGalaxy Gazer captain (only appearance)\n\nLocations[]\n\nBermuda Triangle\n\nUnited States\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami\n\nSea port\n\nObjects[]\n\nHeaven's Light\n\nVehicles[]\n\nThe Mystery Machine\n\nGalaxy Gazer\n\nPoseidon\n\nPirate brig\n\nWooden raft\n\nUSS Cyclops (AC-4) (hologram)\n\nFlight 19 planes (RC models)\n\nAlien spaceship (RC model)\n\nSuspects[]\n\nSuspect Motive/Reason Captain Crothers\n\nSunny St. Cloud They make many montages of sloppy \"mysteries\".\n\nCulprits[]\n\nCulprit Motive/Reason Biff Wellington as Captain Skunkbeard To go back in time.

Freddie, not paying attention, calls out \"43...44, 45\" as he counts the pier numbers they are driving by. This is an in-joke to the many iterations of Scooby-Doo always depicting the gang as in their teens or at most in their early 20s. If one were to count the years Fred existed as a cartoon character, he debuted in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1969, and this movie was made in 2006. That would actually make him 37 years old. (Although as a cartoon character he perpetually keeps his youth). This isn't an accurate age though, since he was already 15-18 when the series started.\n\nFred is revealed to be very muscular while being shirtless in the mystery cruise ship's pool; he has washboard abs, a chiseled chest, and very toned muscles.\n\nThis is the first known time Scooby and Shaggy are resistant to hypnosis, possibly either to do with past experience or the fact they're incompetent, making them resist hypnosis.\n\nDuring the montage where Sunny St. Cloud and Captain Crothers dress up like monsters for Scooby and the gang to catch, they dress up like the following monsters from episodes of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!.\n\nThe Ghost of Captain Cutler from A Clue for Scooby Doo\n\nThe Ghost Clown from Bedlam in the Big Top\n\nThe Werewolf from Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf, however he has the color scheme of the Werewolf from A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts.\n\nWhile selecting a unique costume theme for dinner, Shaggy and Scooby ultimately dress up as Daphne and Velma in their Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, respectively. They would do this again in Scooby-Doo! and the Goblin King.\n\nWhen Shaggy and Scooby dress as Daphne and Velma to Sunny St. Cloud, an instrumental of the theme song for The New Scooby-Doo Movies briefly plays.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Shaggy mentions a run-in with the Abominable Snowman, which they do in the next movie, Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!\n\nIf the USS Cyclops was missing for a hundred years, it would have been in 1906 while in real life, it launched in 1910 and disappeared in 1918.\n\nSunny's character and appearance might have been influenced/inspired by the character Julie McCoy from The Love Boat.\n\nThe alien (which was revealed to be a disguise worn by Captain Crothers) bares a slight resemblance to the fake aliens from the movie Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders.\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nDisguises: Shaggy and Scooby as cleaners on the ship; Shaggy and Scooby as pirates, Fred and Daphne as aliens.\n\nTraps:\n\nClues:\n\nScooby Snacks bribe: 0\n\n\"Ruh-roh\" count: 0\n\n\"Zoinks\" count: 2\n\n\"Jeepers\" count: 1\n\n\"Jinkies\" count: 2\n\nAdaptations[]\n\nScholastic published two versions: A standard novel-type and a 8x8 book.\n\nDalmatian Press also published an adaptation called Pirates Ahoy!\n\nAnimation mistakes and/or technical glitches[]\n\nWhen the ghost pirates attack the Galaxy Gazer at the beginning of the movie, Rupert swings his door open into the passage outside. When he sees the pirate ship with cannons at the ready pull up beside, he backs up and slams his door shut from the inside.\n\nWhen Daphne and Velma encounter the Sea Witch, her right arm is made impossibly thin compared to the rest of her body. It returns to normal in the next scene and the few others she's in.\n\nDuring the \"Blow Ye Winds\" chase scene, when one of the ghost pirates cuts a table, it vanishes for a few frames before appearing again.\n\nInconsistencies/continuity errors and/or goofs/oddities[]\n\nWhen Daphne is first in view in the Mystery Machine, she's clearly sitting regularly, but when it switches to up-close, she's in the middle of painting her toenails.\n\nDaphne is barefoot while in the Mystery Machine, but when she gets out she is not only wearing her shoes but also her full-length stockings/tights.\n\nThe name on the vessel of Poseidon was originally called Poseidon's Paradise. After it's out of dock, the name disappears, and from then on its simply referred to as Poseidon.\n\nSkunkbeard's ship's size seems to change from colossal (while grappling the cruise ship) to the size of a small brig (during the last scenes). A ship from that time period would certainly be nowhere near as large as a modern cruise ship.\n\nThe pirates' motive for attacking the cruise ship was a reach at best. One could argue that Skunkbeard knew he needed Rupert to decode the map, but captured Skip instead because he was wearing the castaway clothes. But how did they know he was cast adrift (and not drowned) when his ship went down? How did they know he was rescued by that ship? Wellington arrived after Rupert was taken below deck. Why didn't they come back to search for him when they found he wasn't among the captives? Surely, Mysterio could have asked Rupert's crewmates what he looked like.\n\nWhen Skunkbeard and Wally are searching Rupert's modest-sized quarters for him, what are the odds they wouldn't look under that bed?\n\nIt's simply impossible for a few solid cannonballs to sink a ship with the size and structure integrity of a modern cruise ship, like the Poseidon. Even with some damage, it should still have more than enough momentum and speed to ram Skunkbeard's ship (with the disastrous consequences to the latter).\n\nWhen Scooby opens a pot, a lobster pinches his nose. The lobster is red, and lobsters get their red color after being boiled. Live lobsters are a dark greenish-brown color.\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nLanguage Title Meaning Croatian Scooby-Doo!
