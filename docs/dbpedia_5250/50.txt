Other roles

Apart from his work in animation, Kasem was also a popular radio disc jockey. He was the co-creator and host of the American Top 40 countdown; starting from its original run in 1970-88, and then its revival from 1998 until his retirement in 2009. In between that show's hiatus, he hosted Casey's Top 40 from 1989-98. He also founded the American Video Awards in 1983, and continued to co-produce and host it until its finale in 1987.

Behind the scenes

In The Ben Stiller Show episode "With Colin Quinn," Ben Stiller plays an older guy who bugs Kasem and his daughter at a restaurant to do his radio and Shaggy voices. Casey reluctantly agrees to get the guy off his back, so Casey says in Shaggy's voice, "Scoob, old buddy, old friend, old pal, I could really dig a pizza."

Kasem was a dedicated vegan and had briefly quit his role as Shaggy in 1995, after he was requested to do a Burger King commercial with the character. He returned to the role years later, when producers agreed to make Shaggy a vegetarian; starting in 2002.[1][2]

The only other times where Kasem voiced Shaggy during his break was in some TV commercials, and a guest appearance on the Johnny Bravo episode "Bravo Dooby-Doo", which aired in 1997.

In the Sister, Sister episode "The Audition," Mr. Matushka told the students that Casey Kasem would be a returning alumnus guest of Roosevelt High. After failing to get them to recognize Casey for his radio career, he sighed as he had to resort to using his career as the voice of Shaggy on Scooby-Doo to get their attention.

Kasem's role as Shaggy is the basis for questions in two episodes of Jeopardy!:

November 13, 2002: In the "Scooby-Doo at 32" category for $1000, the question was, "Keep your feet on the ground & keep reaching for the stars & tell us he's the original voice of Shaggy," with the answer being, "Who is Casey Kasem?"

June 25, 2007: In the "Voices, I Hear Voices..." category for $1200, the question was, "He voiced Shaggy on the 1969-1972 TV series Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!," with the answer being, "Who is Casey Kasem?"

Tributes

In "Who's Who in Scooby-Doo," the story in DC Comics' Scooby-Doo #74, Mystery Incorporated solve a mystery in Kasem County.

The fake Shaggy in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? episode "A Scooby-Doo Valentine" turns out to be a middle-aged man resembling Kasem.

In the theatrical animated film Scoob!, there is a shop on Venice Beach called Casey's Creation.
