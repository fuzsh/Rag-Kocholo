        "text": "Stanton History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe ancient history of the Stanton name begins with the ancient Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name is derived from when the family resided in the county of Nottinghamshire in an area that was referred to as stanton, which means stony ground. 1\n\nStanton is a topographic surname, which was given to a person who resided near a physical feature such as a hill, stream, church, or type of tree. During the Middle Ages, as society became more complex, individuals needed a way to be distinguishable from others. Toponymic surnames were developed as a result of this need. Various features in the landscape or area were used to distinguish people from one another. In this case the original bearers of the surname Stanton were named due to their close proximity to the stanton.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Stanton family\n\nThe surname Stanton was first found in Nottinghamshire where they held a family seat from very ancient times, as Lords of the manor of Staunton. The first Lord was Sir Brian Staunton who was Lord of Staunton during the time of Edward the Confessor in 1047. 2 The family of Staunton of Staunton, in the first-named shire, \"can be regularly traced from the time of the Conqueror, and there is no doubt of their having been settled in Nottinghamshire. in the time of Edward the Confessor.\" 2 \"An ancient house, traced to the Conquest\" 3\n\nGreat East Standen Manor is a manor house on the Isle of Wight that dates to the Norman Conquest; and was once the residence of Princess Cicely (1469-1507). Nearby is Standen House, an English country house but this edifice is more recent and dates back to the 18th century.\n\nGloucestershire is home to another village named Staunton and this village is almost as old as the former with the first listing found in 972 as Stanton 1 and then later the Domesday Book, 4 mentions a castle there belonging to Roger de Stanton, the foundations of which were cleared away a few years before. 5\n\nStanton in Northumberland was home to another branch of the family which has fallen. \"The ancient manor-house, the seat of the last-named family, has been converted into a house for the reception of the poor; and a chapel which stood a little to the north of it, has altogether disappeared.\" 5\n\nHervey de Staunton (died 1327), was an English judge, son of Sir William de Staunton of Staunton, Nottinghamshire. \"He seems to have held the living of Soham, Norfolk, as early as 1289: afterwards he held the livings of Thurston and Werbeton, and about 1306, on being ordained priest, received the living of East Derham. In November 1300 there is mention of him as going to the court of Rome. He was a justice itinerant in Cornwall in 1302 and in Durham in 1303.\" 6\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 list Alice de Staunton, Lincolnshire; Nicholas de Staunton, Essex; and William de Staunton, Oxfordshire. 7\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Stanton family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Stanton research. Another 60 words (4 lines of text) covering the years 1600, 1616, 1636, 1639, 1671, 1677, 1681, 1705, 1734, 1785 and 1859 are included under the topic Early Stanton History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nStanton Spelling Variations\n\nUntil quite recently, the English language has lacked a definite system of spelling rules. Consequently, Anglo-Saxon surnames are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. Changes in Anglo-Saxon names were influenced by the evolution of the English language, as it incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other languages. Although Medieval scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, so it is common to find one person referred to by several different spellings of his surname, even the most literate people varied the spelling of their own names. Variations of the name Stanton include Stanton, Staunton and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Stanton family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nEdmund Staunton (Stanton) (1600-1671), an English clergyman, chosen by Parliament as President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford\n\nThomas Stanton (1616?-1677), English-born, settler to America c. 1636, a trader and an accomplished Indian interpreter and negotiator in the colony of Connecticut\n\nWilliam Stanton (1639-1705), an English mason and sculptor, known for his memorial pieces\n\nStanton World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Stanton is the 912nd most popular surname with an estimated 32,331 people with that name. 8 However, in Australia, the name Stanton is ranked the 693rd most popular surname with an estimated 5,646 people with that name. 9 And in New Zealand, the name Stanton is the 795th popular surname with an estimated 916 people with that name. 10 The United Kingdom ranks Stanton as 701st with 9,545 people. 11\n\nMigration of the Stanton family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Stanton family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 77 words (6 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nStanton migration to the United States +\n\nSearching for a better life, many English families migrated to British colonies.

For those families that arrived safely, modest prosperity was attainable, and many went on to make invaluable contributions to the development of the cultures of the new colonies.
