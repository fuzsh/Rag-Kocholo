        "text": "Robert Smalls, S.C. M.C. Born in Beaufort, SC, April 1839. (Library of Congress, prints and photographs division).\n\nThere are just some names you’ll hear over and over in Charleston. From Aiken to Boone to Ravenel to Rutledge, many of Charleston’s homes, streets, and structures are named after these famous families. You’re bound to hear about at least a few of them on your trip to the Holy City — and now you’ll know exactly who they are.\n\nAiken Family\n\nVisit the Aiken-Rhett House on Elizabeth Street in Charleston to learn all about its previous owners, William Aiken (once the owner of the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company) and former South Carolina Governor, William Aiken, Jr.\n\nThe home is now a museum currently operated by the Historic Charleston Foundation. It’s a model example of antebellum architecture, where you can learn about life in Charleston in the 1800s.\n\nBoone Family\n\nHead across the Ravenel Bridge to Mount Pleasant to visit one of the oldest working plantations in the country.\n\nThis plantation dates to 1681 and was founded by Major John Boone, who was a descendant of Edward and John Rutledge, signers of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nBoykin Family\n\nThe Boykins are so steeped in South Carolina’s history that there’s a town named after the family about 90 minutes north of Charleston. The dog breed, the Boykin spaniel (the state dog of South Carolina) is also named after the family.\n\nMary Boykin Chestnut was a famous Confederate author, whose diary encapsulated life in the upper-class society during the Civil War. The diary was later annotated by C. Vann Woodward and published as, “Mary Chestnut’s Civil War.” It won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982.\n\nCalhoun Family\n\nAnother famous Charleston family in politics, the Calhouns are descendants of the seventh vice president of the U.S., John Caldwell Calhoun (who served under presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson).\n\nHe was famously a supporter of states’ rights and played a major role in the South’s succession from the Union.\n\nDrayton Family\n\nNot one — but two — plantations were owned by the Drayton family of South Carolina: Drayton Hall and Magnolia Plantation and Gardens.\n\nThe Draytons have been in Charleston since the 1600s — back when it was named Charles Towne.\n\nMagnolia Plantation was passed down through the Drayton family, and the gardens were enhanced by Rev. John Drayton. It was he who transformed the gardens into a tourist attraction. You can still visit the 60 acres of gardens in addition to the plantation house.\n\nLegare Family\n\nThe Legares have been farming Charleston’s land since 1725. They are descendants of one of the city’s earliest settlers, Soloman Legare.\n\nSoloman’s farm was on Johns Island, where he grew cotton, indigo, and potatoes.\n\nToday, the Legares own a 300-acre farm outside of Charleston.\n\nHugh Swinton Legare was a U.S. Representative and South Carolina state attorney general in the 1800s. Thomas Allen Legare, Jr. was a member of the South Carolina State House of Representatives in the 1940s and 50s and a senator in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nMiddleton Family\n\nHead north of Downtown, and you’ll eventually hit plantation country. Middleton Place is one of Charleston’s most visited plantations. Take a tour of this plantation if you want a deeper understanding of the enslaved African Americans who lived, worked, and died here.\n\nThe first Middleton to emigrate to South Carolina was Edward Middleton in 1768. His son Arthur was a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nPinckney Family\n\nPinckney is another name you’ll see time and again in Charleston. Pinckney Island was named after the family when it was purchased by Judge Charles Pinckney in 1734.\n\nNot only did Charles Pickney play a large role in the Revolutionary War, but he also participated in the Charleston Tea Party, one of the other tea parties besides Boston.\n\nCharles’s son Thomas was a decorated Charleston Revolutionary War hero and governor of South Carolina in 1787. He was also a congressman in 1791. You can find Charles’s brother’s and cousin’s signatures on the U.S. Constitution.\n\nHis cousin was Arthur Middleton.\n\nRavenel Family\n\nDrive or bike across the Ravenel Bridge to Mount Pleasant and you’ll get one of the best water views in Charleston.\n\nThe Ravenels have lived in Charleston for generations. They descend from French Huguenots and are also connected to the DuBose family of South Carolina.\n\nHenry Ravenel (1790 – 1867) was a planter and his son (also named Henry) was a botanist. Henry’s other son William married into the DuBose family and owned a plantation.\n\nArthur Ravenel Jr., a descendant was a South Carolina congressman. His son Thomas Ravenel is also a politician.\n\nRutledge Family\n\nRutledge Avenue runs from the northern edge of Downton, all the way to the southern tip of the peninsula.\n\nIt was named after John Rutledge, Chief of Justice in the U.S. in 1795 and Governor of South Carolina from 1779 to 1782. He was also a signer of the Constitution.\n\nHis former home has been transformed into the John Rutledge House Inn.\n\nSmalls Family\n\nRobert Smalls was an African-American politician, serving as senator and representing South Carolina from 1874 to 1886.\n\nHe was born into slavery in nearby Beaufort in 1839. In 1862, 22-year-old Smalls commandeered and steered a first-class steamer to a Union-controlled port, freeing himself and his family.\n\nSmalls served in the Union Navy. After the war, he returned to Beaufort and purchased the house where he was born (previously owned by his former master), and opened a school for African Americans.\n\nWaring Family\n\nWaring is another name you might hear in Chucktown — though you may not hear this one as often as some of the others on this list.\n\nJudge J. Waties Waring was a U.S. District Judge, who was appointed in 1942. He would later go on to play a major role in the desegregation of the South while presiding over the school segregation case, Briggs v. Elliott. He was the son of a Confederate soldier and the descendant of slave owners. He is memorialized in a life-size statue at the Hollings Judicial Center in Downtown."
