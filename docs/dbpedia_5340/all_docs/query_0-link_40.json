        "text": "Georgia Genealogy Trails\n\n\"Where your Journey Begins\"\n\nFloyd County, Georgia\n\nBiographies\n\nThompson Hiles\n\nThough now to some extent retired from business activities, Thompson Hiles, a prominent citizen of Rome, yet retains enough active interests to require his presence in his office every day. Though Mr. Hiles has been identified with Northwest Georgia for a generation, he is a native of Tennessee, born in Shelbyville, January 8, 1841; son of Joseph Hiles, a farmer, born in Virginia, moved to Tennessee, and married Abilene Anthony, a native of Shelbyville. Joseph Hiles wife, Abilene Anthony, was probably also descended from a Virginia family, for so far as is known, the Southern Anthony family came from that State about the Revolutionary period.\n\nCaptain Hiles was educated in the Lynchburg, Tennessee, Academy and the University located at Shelbyville; and was just reaching manhood on the outbreak, of the War between the States. He became a soldier in the Seventeenth Tennessee Regiment, attached first to the Army of Northern Virginia, and later to the Western Armies. He served with the rank of Brevet-Captain and participated in the desperate struggles of Chickamauga, Perryville (Kentucky), Drewry's Bluff (Virginia), and the siege of Petersburg. He served through the whole war with fidelity and with credit, and is now the holder of a Confederate Medal of Honor. In 1866, Captain Hiles engaged in the dry goods business at Summerville, Georgia. A prudent, steady going, capable man, his affairs prospered; and in 1860 he moved to Rome and established the wholesale dry goods business known as the Thompson Hiles Company, which, after doing a large and prosperous business for years, he sold out in 1890. He had, however, always retained an interest at Summerville, and the firm of Thompson Hiles and Company, yet doing a large business in that town, is one of the oldest and strongest firms of the section. He also retains an interest in the Chattooga County Bank, of Summerville, in which he is a director. He has been for thirty years unbrokenly a director in the First National Bank of Rome and is recognized as one of the soundest and safest financiers of his section.\n\nCaptain Hiles has served as a member of the City Council, and one term as Mayor of the city. He is active in the work of the Methodist Church, of which he is a steward; and is affiliated with the various Masonic lodges, also with Rome Commandery No. 8 of the Knights Templar.\n\nCaptain Hiles has been twice married; first, in 1868, to Elizabeth Sturdivant, of Summerville, Georgia, a daughter of James D. and Margaret (McClure) Sturdivant. His second wife was Clalie McWilliams, of Rome, daughter of O. H. and Julia (Pope) McWilliams. Of his marriages there have been six children born. The living children of the first marriage are Mrs. Harper Hamilton; Gordon Hiles, of Atlanta; and Mrs. J. R. Moorman. The living child of the second marriage is Thompson Hiles, Junior.\n\nCaptain Hiles political sympathies have always been with the Democratic party. Ho believes that the broadening of our educational facilities is the primary need of Georgia, and he would like to see our people concentrate their energies in that direction in order that our children and our children's children may have advantages which have been denied to us, and which will qualify them to do larger things than we have been able to do.\n\nCaptain Hiles has nearly reached the Biblical three score and ten. He has served his country faithfully and well, both in war and peace; and by his ability, his industry and his economy he has accumulated a competency and enjoys the esteem of the community in which more than forty years of his life have been spent.

He was born in Cherokee county, April 26, 1844, and was there reared and educated. He is a son of Capt. John B. and Nancy (Blythe) O'Neill, the former born in South Caro­lina and the latter in Cherokee county, Ga. Capt. John B. O'Neill enlisted in the Confederate ranks at the beginning of the Civil war as captain of Company A, Eighteenth regiment, Georgia Volun­teers, and was wounded in the second battle of Manassas. The injury was so severe that he was never afterward able for field service, and passed the remainder of his life in Cobb county, where his wife also died. The family was also represented in the war of the Revolution. James J. O'Neill was seventeen years of age at the time of the outbreak of the war between the states. He en­tered the military service of the state of Georgia in 1861, as ser­geant in Company A, First regiment, Fourth Georgia brigade. After being in rendezvous two months the command went to Vir­ginia and entered the Confederate service, being numbered as the Eighteenth Georgia infantry. This was the Georgia regiment that was brigaded with three Texas regiments to form what was known as Hood's Texas Brigade, famous for its reckless daring in battle. Sergeant O'Neill shared fully in the service of this brigade at the battles of West Point, Seven Pines, Seven Days' battle before Richmond, Mechanicsville, Cold Harbor, White Oak Swamp, Malvern Hill, Kelly's Ford and Thoroughfare Gap. In the second battle of Manassas he captured the flag of the Twenty-fourth New York regiment. In this engagement his father, Capt. J. B. O'Neill, was seriously wounded and was furloughed to his home, carrying the captured flag with him. He gave the flag to private Northcutt, of his company, to convey the same to a member of the legislature and through the latter to the governor of the state at Milledgeville, and by some means Northcutt was given credit for the capture of the flag, as is shown in the reports of Forty-second Georgia records. Following closely on Manassas were the battles of South Mountain and Sharpsburg, Md., in which Sergeant O'Neill participated, and later he took part in the battles of Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, after which he was transferred to the Western Army as a private in the Sixth Georgia cavalry, and was under command of Gen. Joe Wheeler. Private O'Neill took part in the battles of Chickamauga, Sweet-water, Philadelphia, Loudon and Dandridge, at which last men­tioned place he was promoted to first sergeant. He was also in the siege of Knoxville and the engagements at Bean's Station and Mossy Creek (Now Jefferson City), at which last point he was seriously wounded, Dec. 29, 1863. He was thereafter in hospital until sent home on a furlough. On recuperating he joined his reg­iment at Resaca and took part in the engagement at that place as first sergeant in command of his company. In the battle of New Hope Church he was promoted to second lieutenant, in which rank he was often in command of his company. He took part in the bat­tles of Jones' Farm, McAfee's Cross Roads, Latimer's Mill, Kenesaw Mountain, and the engagement near Smyrna, was in all of the battles around Atlanta and assisted in the capture of Stone-man and his command, as well as the driving of Cook and Garrard across the Chattahoochee river. He rode with Wheeler and his men on the famous raid through northern Georgia and Tennessee, fighting and skirmishing day and night. While crossing the Cum­berland mountains he was captured by the notorious bushwacker, Blackburn, but escaped by taking desperate chances, and rejoined his regiment. Returning in time to see the destruction of Atlanta, he assisted in fighting Sherman's cavalry night and day, on the famous march to the sea, and after the fall of Savannah took part in the operations in the Carolinas, including the battle of Aiken, where his horse was shot under him, and also the battle of Bentonville. He surrendered near Greensboro, N. C, under the capitulation of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, April 26, 1865. After the close of his gallant and faithful military career Captain O'Neill located in Marietta, where for some time he was employed as a clerk in a mercantile establishment and where, in 1865, he was united in marriage to Miss Mary A. Cook. He finally engaged in the lumber and milling business, with which he has ever since been identified. In 1881 he established himself in this line of enterprise in Rome, beginning operations on a small scale and from this modest incep­tion evolving the fine industrial enterprise controlled by the O'Neill Manufacturing Company, of which he is president, and his son, James H., vice-president. The plant of the company is the largest in the northern part of the state and there are only two larger in the entire state. Employment is given to an average of 100 workmen, and the output includes general planing-mill work, sash, doors, blinds, etc. The products are sold principally in Vir­ginia, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky and other states further to the north, and the company has four lumber yards in West Virginia, handling all kinds of stock from the headquarters, in addition to the manufactured products. Captain O'Neill is arrayed as a stanch supporter of the Democratic party, though never a seeker of office, and is identified with the United Confederate Veterans. Captain and Mrs. O'Neill became the parents of three children, Leni L., James H. and Louise, all of whom are living.\n\nSource: Men of Mark In Georgia\n\nPatton, William Alexander, was one of the prominent and highly honored young business men of Rome, popular in both business and social life, and was summoned to the eternal life in the prime of his manhood, his death occurring on June 18, 1903. He was born in Nashville, Tenn., in the year 1868, and was there reared to the age of thirteen years, when he came with his parents, Joseph B. and Laura (Mclntyre) Patton, to Rome, where he passed the remainder of his life. His parents were both born in Nashville, and his father was a member of a Tennessee regiment in the Confederate service during the Civil war, having been identified with the artillery arm of the service. William A. Patton secured his education in the schools of Nashville and Rome. In his business career he held at all times the highest reputation for ability, fidelity and impregnable integrity. He was for some time employed in the First National bank of Rome, was later with the Merchants' National bank, of that city, and at the time of his death was secretary and treasurer of the O'Neill Manufacturing Company, in which he was a stockholder. To him was ever ac-corded uniform confidence and esteem and he was mayor of East Rome at the time of his demise, having been a stanch Democrat in his political allegiance. When seventeen years of age he enlisted in the Rome Light Guards, was captain of the same for a number of years, and never lost his vital interest in military affairs, having been senior major in the Fifth regiment of Georgia state troops for several years and held that office at the time of his death. He was a Knight Templar Mason, a member of the Mystic Shrine, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Knights of Pythias, the Woodmen of the World, and other social and fraternal organizations, while his religious faith was that of the Baptist church. On Oct. 15, 1889, Major Patton was united in marriage to Miss Ida Nevin, daughter of Mitchell A. and Helen (Underwood) Nevin, of Rome. Mr. Nevin was born in Augusta, Ga., and came to Rome shortly after the war, when he became one of the prominent merchants and influential citizens, and took a most active part in furthering the advancement and material upbuilding of the city. He served three terms as mayor, then passed an interim of one term and was elected for the fourth term. He was city clerk for eighteen years, and for twelve years was associated in the editorial management of the Rome Courier, with Henry W. Grady. He was a stanch Democrat, a member of the Methodist church and of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. At the time of the Civil war, owing to a physical disability, he was unable to enter the Confederate ranks, but he served in the commissary department at Augusta. He died on Dec. 14, 1895. Major Patton is survived by three childrenWilliam A., Jr., M. A. Nevin, and Ida May. William A., Jr., is a student in the Danville military institute at Danville, Va.\n\nSource: Cyclopedia of Georgia Transcribed by Friends for Free Genealogy\n\nStovall, Marcellus A., was born at Sparta, Ga., Sept. 18, 1818. Both his grandfathers were Revolutionary soldiers. He was educated in Massachusetts and, when only seventeen years old, enlisted for the Seminole war. In 1836 he entered the military acade­my at West Point, but was forced by ill health to leave before grad­uating. After an extended European trip he went into business at Augusta and at once became prominent in the military circles of the state. In 1846 he removed to Floyd county, where he lived at the breaking out of the war. He at once offered his services to Governor Brown and was made colonel of artillery. The following October he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of the Third Georgia infantry battalion and ordered to Richmond. He served during the entire war, and was several times specially mentioned for gallant conduct on the field of battle. In 1863 he was commissioned brigadier-general. After the war he returned to Augusta and engaged in the cotton and fertilizer business. He died August 4, 1895.\n\nSource: Men of Mark In Georgia"
