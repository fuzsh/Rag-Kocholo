        "text": "Charleston has become one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States, and it's not hard to see why. It has charming, colorful architecture, cobble-stoned streets, incredible restaurants, and historic landmarks.\n\nThe low country has caught the attention of quite a few notable people who now call it home.\n\nLet's start with one of the most famous residents of Charleston, legendary actor Bill Murray. Known for roles in iconic movies such as Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Meatballs, and Caddyshack, Murray can often be found frequenting many of Charleston's restaurants and venues.\n\n\"There's a lot of insects. It's really, really hot in the summer. And the traffic is worse than it ever was. I'm right on the edge here, telling people that this is a really nice place to come, and really, I don't want anyone else to come. I like it the way it is,\" he once said jokingly to the late, great Anthony Bourdain.\n\nAll jokes aside, Murray is very serious about how much he loves Charleston, even owning part of the minor league baseball team, the Charleston RiverDogs.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nStephen Colbert, comedian and host of The Late Show, was born in Washington, DC, but grew up in the Charleston suburb of James Island, South Carolina. In 2023, when Charleston was named the number one city in the United States by Travel & Leisure and earned a spot in their World's Best Awards Hall of Fame, Colbert was quoted as saying, \"I hope this means more world travelers check out my fine city, but not all at once. I think 6 billion tourists might be a little much.\"\n\nThere are a few Hollywood celebs who were lucky to be born in Charleston and speak of it proudly. Thomas Gibson, actor and star of Criminal Minds, once reflected on his childhood in Charleston and said, \"When my sister and I were kids, swimming down in Charleston, there was this pizza parlor that had this old Dixieland band play, and I just loved Louis Armstrong and the sound of his voice, and I got up there with the band and started singing Louis Armstrong songs when I was a kid. I have no idea why, but I did it, and I loved it.\"\n\nCountry music sensation Darius Rucker was born in Charleston. He gave a tour in the area he loves and even named his second album Charleston, SC 1966. Earlier this year, he hosted the Live Music Festival in Charleston, a bucket list dream of his. \"Anyone who knows me knows how much I love Charleston,\" Rucker shared in an interview. \"For years now, I've had this bucket list dream of bringing together a bunch of friends to perform in a way that also showcases this incredible city and all it has to offer.\"\n\nOf course, Charleston's residents aren't all in the entertainment industry. Biochemist Robert Furchgott was a Nobel Prize-winning American biochemist who discovered that Nitric Oxide causes blood vessels to dilate, which led to the therapeutic effects of Nitroglycerin used to treat Angina pectoris, among other medical discoveries.\n\nThe next time you're in the Holy City, keep your eyes open and try to spot some notables. Even if they don't live there, Charleston has become a popular vacation destination, too, so you never know who you will see."
