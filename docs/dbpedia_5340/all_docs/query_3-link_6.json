Best known as a comic, he is also known for his eccentric behavior, drug addiction, and sexual misconduct allegations and arrests. His first regular television role was on the short-lived but influential Ben Stiller Show. In the mid-1990s, he had a long-running stint on NBC's NewsRadio and was a supporting character on Less than Perfect. He briefly had his own program, The Andy Dick Show on MTV. He is noted for his outlandish behavior from a number of Comedy Central Roasts and other appearances.\n\nMary-Louise Parker, an award-winning American actress and writer, has established a remarkable legacy in the entertainment industry. Born on August 2, 1964, in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, she grew up as the youngest of four siblings. After graduating from North Carolina School of the Arts, Parker embarked on her acting career in the mid-1980s. With her natural flair for acting, she quickly gained attention for her performances in both theater and film. Parker's career took off with her Tony Award-winning performance in the Broadway production of David Auburn's Proof in 2001. She further solidified her star status with a Golden Globe and Emmy Award for her role in HBO's miniseries Angels in America. On the silver screen, Parker has demonstrated her versatility with roles in films such as Fried Green Tomatoes, Boys on the Side, and Red. However, it was her portrayal of Nancy Botwin, a suburban widow turned marijuana dealer in the television series Weeds, that won her another Golden Globe. In addition to her acting pursuits, Parker is also an accomplished writer. Her collection of essays titled Dear Mr. You was published in 2015 and received critical acclaim. The book showcases Parker's literary talents through a series of letters addressed to significant men in her life. Despite her numerous professional achievements, Parker maintains a balanced perspective, prioritizing her role as a mother to her two children.\n\nAndie MacDowell, an illustrious figure in the entertainment industry, is best known for her award-winning performances in both film and television. Born as Rosalie Anderson MacDowell on April 21, 1958, in Gaffney, South Carolina, she embarked on her journey into stardom initially as a model and later transitioned into acting. MacDowell's modeling career began with Elite Model Management, leading her to represent renowned brands such as Vogue and Yves Saint Laurent. Her striking beauty and unique talent soon caught the attention of director Bruce Beresford, offering her a starring role in his 1984 film Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. Despite facing criticism for her debut performance, she unwaveringly continued to hone her craft and subsequently won hearts with her remarkable performance in Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape in 1989. This role earned her a nomination for a Golden Globe and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, marking her arrival as a serious actor in Hollywood. In the ensuing years, MacDowell showcased her versatility with roles in various genres. She delivered memorable performances in romantic comedies like Green Card and Four Weddings and a Funeral, the latter earning her another Golden Globe nomination. Her portrayal of complex characters in dramas like Unstrung Heroes and Crush further cemented her status as a dynamic actress. Aside from her film career, MacDowell also found success on television, most notably in the series Cedar Cove. In addition to her acting prowess, MacDowell is celebrated for her philanthropic endeavors, particularly her work with ovarian cancer awareness campaigns.\n\nMary Laurence \"Lauren\" Hutton (born November 17, 1943) is an American model and actress. Raised in the southern United States, Hutton relocated to New York City in her early adulthood to begin a modeling career.

She also played central roles in The Gambler (1974) and American Gigolo (1980), and later appeared on television in the network series Paper Dolls and Nip/Tuck. Hutton has continued to model into her seventies, appearing in numerous advertising campaigns for H&M, Lord and Taylor, and Alexander Wang, and performed on the runway for Tom Ford's spring 2012 collection, as well as for Bottega Veneta at the 2016 New York Fashion Week."
