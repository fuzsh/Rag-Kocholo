        "text": "Words of Hugh Blair\n\nLook around you, and you will behold the universe full of active powers. Action is, so to speak, the genius of nature. By motion and exertion, the system of being is preserved in vigor. By its different parts always acting in subordination one to another, the perfection of the whole is carried on. The heavenly bodies perpetually revolve. Day and night incessantly repeat their appointed course. Continual operations are going on in the earth and in the waters. Nothing stands still. All is alive and stirring throughout the universe. In the midst of this animated and busy scene, is man alone to remain idle in his place? Belongs it to him to be the sole inactive and slothful being in the creation, when in so many various ways he might improve his own nature; might advance the glory of the God who made him; and contribute his part in the general good?\n\n-Hugh Blair: as quoted in Josiah Hotchkiss Gilbert: “Dictionary of Burning Words of Brilliant Writers” (1895), page 4\n\nHugh Blair was born on 7 April 1718 in Edinburgh, Scotland. He became a Christian minister, writer, and rhetorician. He is known for “Sermons” (1777 - 1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and “Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres,” a prescriptive guide on composition. Hugh Blair passed on at 82 years of age on 27 December 1800.\n\nKeep A-Goin’!\n\nIf you strike a thorn or rose,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nIf it hails or if it snows,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\n‘Taint no use to sit and whine\n\nWhen the fish ain’t on your line;\n\nBait your hook an’ keep a-tryin’ -\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nWhen the weather kills your crop,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nThough it’s work to reach the top,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nS’pose you’re out o’ ev’ry dime,\n\nGittin’ broke ain’t any crime;\n\nTell the world you’re feelin’ prime -\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nWhen it looks like all is up,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nDrain the sweetness from the cup,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nSee the wild birds on the wing,\n\nHear the bells that sweetly ring,\n\nWhen you feel like sighin’, sing -\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nBy Frank Lebby Stanton: as published in L. L. Perry, Wightman F. Melton, and M. D. Collins, editors: “Frank Lebby Stanton: Georgia’s First Poet Laureate” (1938), page 6; the original version of the poem incorporated Southern United States dialect of the time, with ‘ef’ for ‘if’ in the first and third lines\n\nFrank Lebby Stanton was born on 22 February 1857 in Charleston, South Carolina, United States of America. He became a poet, a lyricist, a newspaper editor, and a columnist under the heading “News from Billville” which later became “Up from Georgia.” Frank Lebby Stanton passed on at 69 years of age on 7 January 1927 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.\n\nCourage\n\nCourage isn’t a brilliant dash,\n\nA daring deed in a moment’s flash;\n\nIt isn’t an instantaneous thing\n\nBorn of despair with a sudden spring\n\nIt isn’t a creature of flickered hope\n\nOr the final tug at a slipping rope;\n\nBut it’s something deep in the soul of man\n\nThat is working always to serve some plan.\n\nCourage isn’t the last resort\n\nIn the work of life or the game of sport;\n\nIt isn’t a thing that a man can call\n\nAt some future time when he’s apt to fall;\n\nIf he hasn’t it now, he will have it not\n\nWhen the strain is great and the pace is hot.\n\nFor who would strive for a distant goal\n\nMust always have courage within his soul.\n\nCourage isn’t a dazzling light\n\nThat flashes and passes away from sight;\n\nIt’s a slow, unwavering, ingrained trait\n\nWith the patience to work and the strength to wait.\n\nIt’s part of a man when his skies are blue,\n\nIt’s part of him when he has work to do.\n\nThe brave man never is freed of it.\n\nHe has it when there is no need of it.\n\nCourage was never designed for show;\n\nIt isn’t a thing that can come and go;\n\nIt’s written in victory and defeat\n\nAnd every trial a man may meet.\n\nIt’s part of his hours, his days and his years,\n\nBack of his smiles and behind his tears.\n\nCourage is more than a daring deed:\n\nIt’s the breath of life and a strong man’s creed.\n\nBy Edgar A. Guest\n\nEdgar Albert ‘Eddie’ Guest was born on 20 August 1881 in Birmingham, England. He immigrated with his family to the United States of America in 1891. From his first published work in the “Detroit Free Press” until his passing in 1959, he penned some 11,000 poems that were syndicated in 300 newspapers and collected into more than twenty books. Mr. Guest is reputed to have had a new poem published in a newspaper every day for more than thirty years. He became known as ‘The People’s Poet,’ writing poems that were of a sentimental and optimistic nature. Edgar Albert ‘Eddie’ Guest passed on at 77 years of age on 5 August 1959 in Detroit, Michigan, United States of America.\n\nI Will Be Worthy Of It\n\nI may not reach the heights I seek,\n\nMy untried strength may fail me;\n\nOr, half-way up the mountain peak,\n\nFierce tempests may assail me.\n\nBut though that place I never gain,\n\nHerein lies comfort for my pain -\n\nI will be worthy of it.\n\nI may not triumph in success,\n\nDespite my earnest labor;\n\nI may not grasp results that bless\n\nThe efforts of my neighbor;\n\nBut though my goal I never see\n\nThis thought shall always dwell with me -\n\nI will be worthy of it.\n\nThe golden glory of Love’s light\n\nMay never fall on my way;\n\nMy path may always lead through night,\n\nLike some deserted by-way;\n\nBut though life’s dearest joy I miss\n\nThere lies a nameless strength in this -\n\nI will be worthy of it.\n\nBy Ella Wheeler Wilcox\n\nElla Wheeler Wilcox was born on 5 November 1850 in Johnstown, Rock County, Wisconsin, United States of America. She became a poet, a writer, and a journalist. Ella Wheeler Wilcox passed on at 68 years of age on 30 October 1919 in Short Beach, New Haven County, Connecticut, United States of America.\n\n​Perseverance\n\nWe must not hope to be mowers,\n\nAnd to gather the ripe gold ears,\n\nUnless we have first been sowers\n\nAnd watered the furrows with tears.\n\nIt is not just as we take it,\n\nThis mystical world of ours,\n\nLife’s field will yield as we make it\n\nA harvest of thorns or of flowers.\n\nBy Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe was born on 28 August 1749 in Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurter Stadtkreis, Hessen, Germany. He became a scientist, a poet, a novelist, a dramatist (playwright), a natural philosopher, and a diplomat. His body of work includes epic and lyric poetry written in a variety of meters and styles; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; treatises on botany, anatomy, and color; and four novels. In addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him are extant. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe passed on at 82 years of age on 22 March 1832 in Weimar, Weimarer Stadtkreis, Thüringen, Germany.\n\nWorst Day Ever?\n\nToday was the absolute worst day ever\n\nAnd don’t try to convince me that\n\nThere’s something good in every day\n\nBecause, when you take a closer look,\n\nThis world is a pretty evil place.\n\nEven if\n\nSome goodness does shine through once in a while\n\nSatisfaction and happiness don’t last.\n\nAnd it’s not true that\n\nIt’s all in the mind and heart\n\nBecause\n\nTrue happiness can be attained\n\nOnly if one’s surroundings are good\n\nIt’s not true that good exists\n\nI’m sure you can agree that\n\nThe reality\n\nCreates\n\nMy attitude\n\nIt’s all beyond my control\n\nAnd you’ll never in a million years hear me say\n\nToday was a very good day\n\nNow read it from bottom to top, the other way,\n\nAnd see what I really feel about my day.\n\nBy Chanie Gorkin (2014)\n\nChanie Gorkin wrote the poem, “Worst Day Ever?” while she was a student in the 11th grade at Lubavitch High School Beth Rivkah in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America. In her own words: “It took me a few hours . . . I was scribbling, erasing, writing, trying to figure out how to make it work both ways.” -Chanie Gorkin\n\n​Keep Calm And Carry On\n\nThe Ministry of Information (MOI) was formed by the British Government as the department responsible for publicity and propaganda during the Second World War. In late 1939, after the outbreak of war, the MOI was appointed by the British Government to design a number of morale boosting posters that would be displayed across the British Isles during the testing times that lay ahead.\n\nWith a bold colored background, the posters were required to be similar in style and feature to the symbolic crown of King George VI, along with a simple yet effective font. The first two posters, ‘Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory’ and ‘Freedom Is in Peril’ were produced by His Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO).\n\nThese two were posted on public transport, in shop windows, and upon notice boards across Great Britain. The third and final poster of the set was again very straightforward and to the point, simply reading, ‘Keep Calm and Carry On.’ The plan in place for this poster was to issue it only upon the invasion of Britain by Germany. As this never happened, the poster was only displayed on a very few office walls and was never officially seen by the public.\n\nIt is believed that most of the Keep Calm posters were reduced to pulp and destroyed at the end of the war in 1945. However, nearly 60 years later, a bookseller from Barter Books stumbled across a copy hidden amongst a pile of dusty old books bought from an auction. A small number also remain in the National Archives and the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nSadly, no record remains of the unknown civil servant who originally came up with the simple and quintessential Britishness of the ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ message. However, it is wonderful to think that all these years later, people still find the message so appealing and reassuring in our modern times.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\n​Present Tense\n\nIt was Spring,\n\nBut it was Summer I wanted,\n\nThe warm days,\n\nAnd the great outdoors.\n\nIt was Summer,\n\nBut it was Fall I wanted,\n\nThe colorful leaves,\n\nAnd the cool, dry air.\n\nIt was Fall,\n\nBut it was Winter I wanted,\n\nThe beautiful snow,\n\nAnd the joy of the holiday season.\n\nIt was Winter,\n\nBut it was Spring I wanted,\n\nThe warmth,\n\nAnd the blossoming of nature.\n\nI was a child,\n\nBut it was adulthood I wanted,\n\nThe freedom,\n\nAnd respect.\n\nI was twenty,\n\nBut it was thirty I wanted,\n\nTo be mature,\n\nAnd sophisticated.\n\nI was middle-aged,\n\nBut it was twenty I wanted,\n\nThe youth,\n\nAnd the free spirit.\n\nI was retired,\n\nBut it was middle-age I wanted,\n\nThe presence of mind,\n\nWithout limitations.\n\nMy life was over.\n\nBut I never got what I wanted.\n\nBy Jason Lehman\n\nJason Lehman was 14 years of age when he wrote the above poem.

This is to be my symphony.\n\nBy W. H.

Live a simple life. Be temperate in your habits. Avoid self-seeking and selfishness. Make simplicity the keynote of your daily plans. Simple things are best.\n\n2. Think constructively. Train yourself to think clearly and accurately. Store your mind with useful thoughts. Stand guard at the door of your mind.\n\n3. Cultivate a yielding disposition. Resist the common tendency to always want your own way. Try to see the other’s viewpoint.\n\n4. Be grateful. Begin the day with gratitude for your opportunities. Be glad for the privilege of life and work.\n\n5. Work with right motives. The highest purpose of your life should be to grow in spiritual grace and power.\n\n6. Be interested in others. Divert your mind from self-centeredness. In the degree that you give, serve, and help, you will experience the by-product of happiness.\n\n7. Live in a daytight compartment. That is, live one day at a time. Concentrate on your immediate task. Make the most of today. Plan for tomorrow, but live for today.\n\n8. Have a hobby. Nature study, walking, gardening, music, golfing, carpentry, stamp collecting, sketching, voice culture, foreign language, chess, books, photography, social service, public speaking, travel, authorship. Cultivate an avocation to which you turn for diversion and relaxation.\n\nBy Author Unknown: as published in “Second Chance Newsletter” (April 1991)\n\nRise Above The Crowd\n\nThe world is full of people,\n\nContent to be what they are,\n\nWho never know the joy of success;\n\nThey lack the will to go that far.\n\nYet in this world there is a need,\n\nFor some to lead the rest,\n\nTo rise above the average life,\n\nBy giving of their best.\n\nAre you the one who dares,\n\nTo try when challenged by the task,\n\nTo rise to heights you’ve never dreamed,\n\nOr is that too much to ask?\n\nThis can be your year,\n\nFor great purpose to achieve,\n\nIf you accept the challenge,\n\nAnd in yourself believe.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\nLife’s Mirror\n\nThere are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,\n\nThere are souls that are pure and true;\n\nThen give to the world the best you have,\n\nAnd the best will come back to you.\n\nGive love, and love to your life will flow,\n\nA strength in your utmost need;\n\nHave faith, and a score of hearts will show\n\nTheir faith in your work and deed.\n\nGive truth, and your gift will be paid in kind,\n\nAnd honor will honor meet;\n\nAnd the smile which is sweet will surely find\n\nA smile that is just as sweet.\n\nGive sorrow and pity to those who mourn;\n\nYou will gather in flowers again\n\nThe scattered seeds from your thought outborne\n\nThough the sowing seemed but vain.\n\nFor life is the mirror of king and slave,\n\n’Tis just what we are and do;\n\nThen give to the world the best you have\n\nAnd the best will come back to you.\n\nBy Madeline S.

I’d like to know the secret of life.”\n\nThe old man looked down at the youngster and replied: “I’ve thought a lot in my lifetime, and the secret can be summed up in four words.”\n\n“The first is ‘think.’ Think about the values by which you wish to live your life.\n\n“The second is ‘believe.’ Believe in yourself based on the thinking you’ve done about the values you’re going to live your life by.\n\n“The third is ‘dream.’ Dream about the things that can be, based on your belief in yourself and the values you’re going to live by.\n\n“The last is ‘dare.’ Dare to make your dreams become reality, based on your belief in yourself and your values.”\n\nAnd with that, the old man said to the young man, “Think, believe, dream, and dare.\n\nBy Author Unknown\n\n​If\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too:\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;\n\nIf you can dream - and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same:\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools;\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings,\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss:\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much:\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd - which is more - you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\nBy Rudyard Kipling: “Rewards and Fairies” (1910)\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling was born on 30 December 1865 in Mumbai (once also known as Bombay), Maharashtra, India.

Douglas Malloch, Senior passed on at 61 years of age on 2 July 1938 in Muskegon, Michigan, United States of America.\n\n​Attitude\n\nThe longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.\n\nAttitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill. It will make or break a company . . . a church . . . a home.\n\nThe remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past. We cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is ten percent what happens to me and ninety percent how I react to it.\n\nAnd so it is with you. We are in charge of our attitudes.\n\nBy Charles R. Swindoll\n\nCharles Rozell ‘Chuck’ Swindoll was born on 18 October 1934 in El Campo, Wharton County, Texas, United States of America.
