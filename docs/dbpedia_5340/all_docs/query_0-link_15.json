        "text": "See It Through\n\nby EDGAR GUEST (1881-1959)\n\nWhen you’re up against a trouble,\n\nMeet it squarely, face to face;\n\nLift your chin and set your shoulders,\n\nPlant your feet and take a brace.\n\nWhen it’s vain to try to dodge it,\n\nDo the best that you can do;\n\nYou may fail, but you may conquer,\n\nSee it through!\n\nBlack may be the clouds about you\n\nAnd your future may seem grim,\n\nBut don’t let your nerve desert you;\n\nKeep yourself in fighting trim.\n\nIf the worst is bound to happen,\n\nSpite of all that you can do,\n\nRunning from it will not save you,\n\nSee it through!\n\nEven hope may seem but futile,\n\nWhen with troubles you’re beset,\n\nBut remember you are facing\n\nJust what other men have met.\n\nYou may fail, but fall still fighting;\n\nDon’t give up, whate’er you do;\n\nEyes front, head high to the finish.\n\nSee it through!\n\nEdgar Guest Contemporaries\n\nRobert Frost\n\nEmile Nelligan\n\nKeep A-Goin’\n\nby FRANK LEBBY STANTON (1857-1927)\n\nEf you strike a thorn or rose,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nEf it hails or if it snows,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\n‘Taint no use to sit an’ whine\n\nWhen the fish ain’t on your line;\n\nBait your hook an’ keep a-tryin‘\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nWhen the weather kills your crop,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nThough ’tis work to reach the top,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nS’pose you’re out o’ ev’ry dime,\n\nGittin’ broke ain’t any crime;\n\nTell the world you’re feelin’ prime—\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nWhen it looks like all is up,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nDrain the sweetness from the cup,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nSee the wild birds on the wing,\n\nHear the bells that sweetly ring,\n\nWhen you feel like sighin’, sing—\n\nKeep a-goin’!"
