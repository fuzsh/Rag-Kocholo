        "text": "If you're planning a trip to the Holy City, you need this visitors guide to Charleston, SC!\n\nLucky for you, you've got a native Charlestonian at the helm to share the real tips on where to visit, eat, shop, and sleep in historic Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nI was born here, and other than an eight-year-gap when I lived elsewhere in South Carolina, I've called Charleston my home my entire life.\n\nFrom school field trips to my own wanderings, I've seen most of what the Holy City has to offer as a child, teenager, young adult, and parent.\n\nSkip the other Charleston SC visitors guides (by bloggers who haven't spent much time here!), and get ready to feel like a local with these Charleston travel tips.\n\nThe better question is probably why haven't you visited Charleston already?!\n\nJokes aside, Charleston is a medium sized city that has an easily walkable historic district, over 400 years of colonial history, and thousands of years in pre-colonial history.\n\nIt has 3 fantastic beaches within easy driving distance of the main historic area, and there's gorgeous architecture wherever you turn.\n\nYou could spend 2 days in Charleston and have a wonderful time, or you could spend 2 months here.\n\nIn both situations, you'd never run out of things to do.\n\nPlus, it's great for all sorts of trips.\n\nBachelor/bachelorette parties on King Street, cultural based family travel, a family beach reunion, or a couple's romantic getaway are all equally possible here!\n\nWhen I run into people visiting Charleston, many of them express confusion on why the beaches aren't closer to the downtown area.\n\nI think this issue comes from the fact that guide books push the \"Charleston is walking accessible\" angle and leave out the fact that the historic district is only one part of the larger Charleston area.\n\nAdding to the confusion, we tend to call the entire Charleston area \"Charleston\" even when it isn't part of the city of Charleston.\n\nAnd, North Charleston isn't just north of the peninsula.\n\nIt's a completely separate municipality several miles north of the main historic peninsula.\n\nAs you can see from my map, downtown Charleston (the place with Rainbow Row and the carriage tours) is only a tiny part of the larger Charleston area.\n\nWhile downtown tends to get most of the focus, I'd encourage you to rent a car and explore the entire area. If you want to go to the beaches or the plantations, you need a car anyway.\n\nThose trips can be done on the local CARTA bus system, but keep in mind that our public transportation can be slow.\n\nDowntown Charleston\n\nIf you're only staying for a few days and you want to make do without a car, this is where you should concentrate your time and effort.\n\nThere are some amazing restaurants, historical homes, and parks within easy walking distance of any of the recommended hotels (see below in this post).\n\n>> Get my full list of suggestions on the best things to do in Charleston SC. <<\n\nSullivan’s Island\n\nThe smaller of the two barrier islands on the Mount Pleasant side.\n\nThere's a feeling of \"shabby chic\" as these beach cottages grow larger each year: even the shabbiest are worth upwards of $1 million.\n\nGrab a burger at Poe's Tavern (YUM) and people watch on Middle Street, then head to the Fort Moultrie National Historic Site.\n\nNOTE: Don't attempt to swim on the southern end of Sullivans Island or near Breach Inlet as the currents are extremely dangerous.\n\n>> Learn more about the wide array of things to do in Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island. <<\n\nNorth Charleston\n\nAnother mid-sized city northwest of the harbor.\n\nIt's a sprawling place connected by two major highways (I-26 and I-526).\n\nIf you're flying into Charleston, the airport is at the junction of these two highways.\n\nThe Shipyard area hosts The Hunley Museum as well as several breweries, and there are so many historic things to do in North Charleston!\n\nWhile some areas like Park Circle are adorable and safe, other parts of North Charleston are less so.\n\nUse caution when selecting an AirBnB or hotel in this area as there are pockets of crime.\n\nPROS: Clean, modern interior; on the same street as the Woolfe Street Playhouse; 1 block from the Visitors Center; 2 blocks from the Children's Museum of the Lowcountry.\n\nCONS: It's a hike from this hotel to the Battery, Rainbow Row, and White Point Gardens if you plan to walk the historic peninsula.\n\nAlso, the area across Meeting from this hotel aren't the safest after dark (as long as you stay on Meeting, you'll be fine no matter the time of day), but I wouldn't recommend wandering down Nassau, Reid, America, or South Streets.\n\n>> BOOK THE HOLIDAY INN CHARLESTON HERE <<\n\nThe Ryder Inn\n\nThe Ryder Inn on Market Street is one of the lower priced hotels in historic Charleston SC that is still in a safe, walkable areas.\n\nThe Ryder Inn used to be the Best Western King Charles Inn, but recently underwent a major renovation and name change.\n\nPROS: fantastic location across the street from the Market; 1 block from the majority of the shopping on King Street; convenient to both ends of the historic district; there's an onsite pool.\n\nCONS: Because it's in the middle of the action, this location can be noisy no matter the time of day or night. Ask for a room away from Meeting Street.\n\n>> BOOK THE RYDER INN HERE <<\n\nThe Wentworth Mansion\n\nWentworth Mansion is an incredible property with beautifully appointed rooms and a feel of old school luxury.\n\nIn the mid-1800s, it served as a private home to the Rodgers family (who had 13 children!).\n\nPROS: high-end detailing, including Tiffany glass features, and antiques; fantastic onsite restaurant, Circa 1886; gorgeous landscaping\n\nCONS: Its location is near to MUSC on the western side of the historic district, which is fine if you're visiting the hospital, but not so great if you want to walk to the sites.\n\nCollege of Charleston and Marion Square are 5 or 6 blocks away, and the City Market and Old Exchange building are more than a mile away.\n\n>> BOOK THE WENTWORTH MANSION HERE <<\n\nThe Francis Marion Hotel\n\nThe Francis Marion Hotel is named after the legendary \"Swamp Fox,\" who helped the South Carolina cause during the American Revolution.\n\nThis beautiful hotel has been here since the 1920s and underwent a renovation a few years ago to keep it fresh.\n\nPROS: historic hotel; less than 1 block from College of Charleston; overlooks Marion Square; great shopping along King Street\n\nCONS: rooms are a bit bland (neutral color scheme) and un-uniform (it's an old hotel so one queen bedroom isn't going to look exactly like all of the other queen bedrooms)\n\n>> BOOK THE FRANCIS MARION HOTEL HERE <<\n\nCharleston Boutique Hotels\n\nThere are also many smaller Charleston boutique hotels if you're looking for a more intimate experience.\n\nMy favorite has to be Planters Inn, which is located at the heart of the historic district for maximum walkability.\n\nThe Planters Inn also has the BEST coconut cake ever!\n\n>> Book the Planters Inn here. <<\n\nPROS: great locations within the historic district; visitors can get to know staff and other patrons; cocktail hours offered; beautiful, private-garden like landscaping\n\nCONS: smaller with fewer amenities; bookings go extremely quickly; there are often weddings/wedding parties at these hotels\n\nCharleston has so many great places that I don't think you can really go wrong no matter your budget, tastes, or style.\n\nI've broken down some of my favorite Charleston restaurants into a few different categories, and then suggested favorite dishes at each.\n\nNOTE: I'm allergic to shellfish, but all recommendations for seafood have come from family and friends who have vetted them for me!\n\nAll of these are local restaurants, so you'll be supporting small business owners in this area.\n\nNote that not all of these are in the historic district!\n\nFood Tours\n\nAnother great way to experience the food of Charleston is to take a food centered tour!\n\nWe’ve taken 2, both of which I recommend.\n\nThe Upper King Street Culinary Tour takes visitors around one of the trendiest areas in downtown Charleston.\n\nAfter Hurricane Hugo destroyed much of Charleston in 1989, Upper King was one of the hardest hit areas, and large portions fell into disrepair.\n\nBy the early 2000s, a major revitalization was underway, and today, this area is filled with incredible restaurants!\n\nThe Farm to Table Charleston food tour has guests go to the weekly Saturday farmers market and select from a wide variety of fruits and veggies.\n\nThe tour then takes these selections to a local chef, who turns them into a custom 5-course meal for the participants.\n\nThis food tour is unique, creative, and perfectly local!\n\nPlantations are a part of Charleston's history, so if you'd like to learn more, you need to head out to see the Ashley River Road plantation district.\n\nThe big three are Middleton Plantation, Drayton Hall, and Magnolia Plantation.\n\nOf the three, I believe that Magnolia Plantation is the best plantation in Charleston since there's a great petting zoo, extensive gardens, a butterfly house, and restored slave quarters in addition to a tour of the main house.\n\n>> Grab your tickets to Magnolia Plantation here. <<\n\nIf you're willing to drive further away from downtown, Hampton Plantation in McClellanville is never crowded.\n\nFor kids, a trip to the Children's Museum of the Lowcountry is always a hit.\n\nWe've been members of the museum for years, and it has remained one of my children's favorite places to visit since they've been little.\n\nThanks to local sponsorship, the museum recently underwent a renovation of several of its playspaces, which created fresh opportunities for imagination.\n\nIt isn't the biggest children's museum in the world, but it's very well done. The outside space is great for a picnic on a sunny day.\n\nA stop at the fountain at Waterfront Park is another great break between historical tours.\n\nBring your kids' bathing suits (or a change of clothing) because they WILL want to splash in the water!\n\nAfterwards, grab one of the swings just behind the fountain and let them dry off.\n\n>> Explore more great things to do with kids in Charleston SC! <<\n\nI'm conflicted about the horse and buggy tours.\n\nAs a resident, I detest these things because they clog up traffic downtown (which isn't the greatest to begin with) and make the streets smell like horse pee.\n\nWhile they are kind of hokey, the tour guides are extremely knowledgeable (all historic Charleston SC guides have to take a ridiculously rigorous test before leading a solo tour), and you'll be able to cover more ground than a walking tour.\n\nYet, the horses are required to work in the extreme summer heat of the Lowcountry, and while they appear to be well taken care of, there's a huge push right now to get rid of the horse and buggy tours.\n\nI'd also recommend a pedicab, but know that due to ridiculous local laws, the pedicab drivers cannot, under any circumstances, give you anything resembling a tour as this violates the Charleston tour guide association rules.\n\nThis issue is currently making its way through the courts, but until it's settled, you can either choose the horse-and-buggy tours or a quick pedicab non-tour.\n\n>> If you want to take a carriage tour, I recommend this one. <<\n\nThe City Market never sold slaves.\n\nThis is one of the biggest mix-ups I hear about Charleston attractions.\n\nWhile slaves did sell their wares here, and they did shop here for their masters, there wasn't any human trafficking going on at this location.\n\nThat sordid portion of our history did occur elsewhere in our city in private auctions, near the Exchange Building, and in the actual slave market, and you can learn more about it at the Old Slave Mart Museum.\n\nWhile the Slave Mart Museum provides a detailed look at this horrific chapter in Charleston, the City Market sells souvenirs, t-shirts, pictures, and sweetgrass basket.\n\nYes, they sound alike, but they are very different places.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise. (The tour guides LOVE to get this wrong!)\n\nUpper King has been undergoing a revitalization over the last 15 years.\n\nWhile this area (up to the 26 overpass) is safe during the day, be cautious about venturing away from the main thoroughfares at night.\n\nThe areas above Line Street--where the Ravenel bridge runs over downtown--can be volatile when it's dark, and tourists are easy targets for muggings.\n\nDuring the day, these areas tend to be fine, but always use your best judgement.\n\nAs long as you stick to main thoroughfares on the upper peninsula, the chances of anything bad happening are low.\n\nLower King, East Bay, and Meeting Streets are all safe no matter the time of day, so strap on those walking shoes, grab your guidebook, and head out the door!\n\nMake time to wander.\n\nFrom the Battery and Rainbow Row to Queen Street, Charleston is best enjoyed on foot.\n\nTake your camera, wander the streets, and explore down the residential alleys.\n\nWhile the South of Broad area houses the most expensive houses, you can find gorgeous architecture on everything from St. Phillip's Church to the houses on Tradd Street."
