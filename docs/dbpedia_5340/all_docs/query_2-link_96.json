        "text": "Jacob Best\n\nMay 1, 1786 – Jan. 26, 1861\n\nWife\n\nEva Maria Schmidt\n\nApr. 29, 1790 – Sept. 1867\n\nSon\n\nLorenz\n\nOct. 20, 1826 – Dec. 29, 1853\n\n1844\n\nJacob Best Brewing Company Founded\n\n1889\n\nName Changed to Pabst Brewing Company\n\nJacob & Eva Best’s Granddaughter Maria Best Married Captain Frederick Pabst\n\nAlso Buried Here\n\nJacob Muth\n\nEva Best\n\nPhilip Schmidt\n\nEight Infant children\n\nThe first gravestone on the beer baron trail that winds through the Forest Home Cemetery at Milwaukee is the Jacob and Eva Maria Best gravestone. The large black granite polished slab is a monument to the Best Family but also to the Best Brewing Company which is depicted on the face of the stone, along with a portrait of its founder, Jacob Best.\n\nLike some other notable German immigrants to Milwaukee, Jacob Best of Darmstadt, was a brewer. He settled in the city in 1840. Best, with his wife and four sons, established his brewery in 1844 which he named the Empire Brewery. The small brewery produced lager beer, whiskey, and vinegar. The demand for lager beer, a beer fermented in low temperatures using very particular yeasts, is characterized by its “crisp” and “clean” taste. His beer was a hit and so was his brewery. Jacob Best retired from the brewery in 1859 and turned the business over to his son, Philip, who renamed the business after himself. As the gravestone proudly proclaims, the brewery originally founded by Jacob Best became the Pabst Brewing Company in 1889 when the Best and Pabst families became intertwined through the marriage of Jacob and Eva Maria’s granddaughter Maria to Captain Frederick Pabst.\n\nA bronze plaque at the base of the gravestone lists the names of the donors who helped pay for the erection of monument in the cemetery. The Best and Pabst families and foundations associated with their families are well represented but also another brewing company of note, the MillerCoors Brewing Company, as well as, the Museum of Beer and Brewing are on the list of donors.\n\nJoseph Schlitz\n\nBorn: May 15, 1831\n\nLost at Sea: May 7, 1875\n\nJoseph Schlitz was born in Mainz, Germany. He immigrated to the United States in 1850 and settled in Milwaukee. He was hired on at the Krug Brewery as a bookkeeper by August Krug. Krug died from a fall in 1856. Two years later, Joseph Schlitz and Krug’s widow, Anna Maria, were married. Schlitz invested his savings in the Krug Brewery and changed the name to the Schlitz Brewing Company. Schlitz began expanding his business, setting up distribution points around the country made easier by the use of the railway. The beer was a hit.\n\nJoseph Schlitz was on his way to visit his German homeland, when the ship, the SS Schiller, he was on hit a rock while in thick fog and sank off the coast of Cornwall, England. He and 340 people on board the ship died—his body was never recovered. The company did not change hands until Anna Maria Schlitz died in 1887, when her nephews, the Uihlein brothers, acquired full ownership.\n\nSchlitz beer became the number one selling beer in America in 1902 and vied for the title throughout the first half of the Twentieth Century. The beer became known as the “The beer that made Milwaukee famous!” The company had an ad campaign that claimed, “When you’re out of Schlitz, you’re out of beer.”\n\nA large and elaborate cenotaph honors Joseph Schlitz in the Forest Home Cemetery at Milwaukee. The large gray granite monument is topped with a statue of a woman looking upwards with one hand reaching toward the sky. The statue is atop several ornamental layers that rests upon a gothic-inspired design with a pointed arch and four columns. This middle structure is on top of the plinth that has a bas-relief carving of a ship, presumably the SS Schiller. Above the sculpture is a banner that reads, “LOST MAY 7, 1875” memorializing the date the ship sank.\n\nHis widow, Anna Maria Hartig Krug Schlitz and many family members are buried in the large family plot surrounding the cenotaph.\n\nAugust Krug\n\nBORN\n\nApril 15, 1815\n\nDIED\n\nDec. 30, 1856\n\nThere are so many beer barons, beer masters, and brewers buried in the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, a city made famous by its name brand beers, that the cemetery has a map, titled The Story of Beer, to guide visitors to the various historic monuments, mausoleums, and gravestones on the beer trail.\n\nMany people have quenched their thirst to some of the name brand beers of the beer barons who brewed beers that have become household names—Pabst, Schlitz, Miller, and Blatz. But one of the little known brewers on the guide map is August Krug. He, like many of brewers, was a German immigrant. Krug was born in Bavaria, the son of a brew master, and immigrated to the United States in 1848 to open a small restaurant/saloon in Milwaukee. He added a small brewery—what we would call a microbrewery today. Output was small, but the beer he brewed had a following. In 1850, Krug had a windfall when his father came to visit bringing with him Krug’s nephew, August Uihlein, and eight hundred dollars which he invested in the fledgling brewery. With his father’s investment, Krug was able to hire more staff, including Joseph Schlitz who he hired on as a bookkeeper.\n\nThe legacy of note left by Krug was the underground cellar he built to keep his beer at a constant and cool temperature. Krug tunneled into the side of a hill to create what is credited as the city’s first underground “cooler.”\n\nKrug’s tenure was short tenure—only seven years. In 1856, Krug had a bad fall and died a couple days after. Within two years, Krug’s widow, Anna Maria, was remarried to Joseph Schlitz, no longer the bookkeeper. Soon the name of the brewery was renamed and the Schlitz Brewing Company was founded.\n\nAugust Krug is buried at the Forest Home Cemetery at Milwaukee. His marker is a simple light brown unpolished limestone column with a matching cap and plinth, and a light gray granite base—no adornment, no epitaph, no family members buried near him.\n\nFrederick Pabst\n\nMarch 28, 1836 – January 1, 1904\n\nFrederick Pabst was born in the small Saxon village in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia. When he was twelve, he immigrated to the United States with his father and mother, Gottlieb and Johanna Pabst. While working at odd jobs in restaurants to make ends meet his mother died in a cholera epidemic in Chicago. Pabst eventually took a job on a steamer on Lake Michigan. He earned his pilot’s license and while serving as captain on a steamer met Philip Best, the owner of a small and successful Milwaukee brewery. Pabst and Philip Best’s daughter, Maria, were married in 1862. By 1864, Pabst had joined his father-in-law in the brewery, learning everything he could about the business. Through savvy business and marketing skills, the Best Brewery was brewing 100,000 barrels of beer annually, up from the production of 5,000 barrels a year when his father-in-law retired nine years earlier. The company went public to raise the money necessary to modernize the brewing process and facilities. Pabst became president of the corporation in 1873.\n\nBy the time the Best Brewery had its name changed to the Pabst Brewing Company in 1889, Pabst was producing over a million barrels of beer annually, the first to do so, and was the largest brewing company in the world. The beer being produced was also recognized as pretty tasty winning ribbons and gold medals. As a marketing ploy, the company had blue ribbons hand tied to each bottle of beer to designate its “select” beer even before it actually won a blue ribbon at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. When customers started referring to and asking for the “blue ribbon beer” the name stuck and the company made it official.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1904, Frederick Pabst was a successful Milwaukee businessman and civic leader. He was survived his widow, Maria, and five adult children. Pabst was laid to rest in the Forest Home Cemetery at Milwaukee.\n\nThe Pabst Monument is an example of Victorian design and craftsmanship carved of white marble. The central features is a woman in a draped and flowing gown, her head bowed in grief. Often these sepulchral figures are referred to as weepers, representing mourning and sorrow. Since ancient times, women have been the ones in our families and in our society who showed grief and shed tears over those lost to death. They stand over the graves and weep.\n\nAccording to, Victorian Cemetery Art by Edmund V. Gillon Jr., published by Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1972, “The large amounts of space in the Victorian cemetery were to revolutionize cemetery art, and permit the use of sculpture in a way that the crowded churchyard had never allowed.” Now there was room in the garden cemeteries of the nineteenth century for lavish monuments. Gillon goes on to write, “Sepulchral sculpture, with its prone effigies and kneeling weepers, had flowered in the past, but only for the rich and powerful.”\n\nValentin Blatz\n\nBorn October 1, 1826, Miltenburg, Germany\n\nDied May 26, 1894, Saint Paul, Minnesota\n\nValentin Blatz, a German émigré, settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1849. Blatz had worked in his father’s Bavarian brewery and others and plied the trade he knew from his youth in Milwaukee. After having worked at a brewery, which was operated by Johann Braun, Blatz started his own brewery next door. In 1851, Braun was thrown from a beer wagon and died. Blatz married Braun’s widow, Louisa, and consolidated the two breweries establishing the Blatz Brewing Company. What started out as two small breweries grew to be the third largest brewery in Milwaukee. The buildings where the beer was brewed covered over four city blocks. Blatz introduced bottled beer in 1874, an innovation we still enjoy to this day!\n\nBlatz died of a heart attack on his way back from a trip to California with his wife, Louisa. The Milwaukee Sentinel, Sunday May 27, 1894, headline read: VALENTIN BLATZ DEAD: Heart Disease Carries Off the Well-Known Brewer; SUDDENLY STRICKEN AT HOTEL RYAN, ST. PAUL. The article went on, “Mr. Blatz and His Wife Were Returning From California on Their Way to Milwaukee-His Family Here Shocked by the Sudden Intelligence- Mr. Blatz Was One of the City’s Wealthiest Men–Started in a Very Small Way Back in the Fifties and Built Up a Vast Business.” Valentin Blatz was survived by his wife, Louisa, and five children—John, Louise, Valentine, Albert, and Emil.\n\nValentin Blatz was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery at Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Blatz Mausoleum, the largest in the state of Wisconsin, was built in 1896 from Barre, Vermont granite. The massive and imposing mausoleum is 40 feet tall, 38 feet long and 30 feet wide, weighing 525 tons.\n\nRibeth Conson Appleby\n\n1917 — 2000\n\nJames Scott Appleby\n\n1921 — 1974\n\nAnnie De Prairie Appleby\n\n1885 – 1952\n\nThe Appleby Family Monument features a bronze sculpture standing in front of a stone arched alcove. The diminutive woman is leaning forward as if she is taking a step forward. Two symbols are apparent in the statute—an ankh and a palm. She wears a necklace that has an ankh and holds a palm frond. Both symbols have religious meaning. The palm is a symbol of spiritual victory. The palm was the plant that was laid on Christ’s path as he entered Jerusalem. It became a symbol of martyrdom and resurrection. In the Middle Ages people wore the palm to signify pilgrimage. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of eternal life.\n\nThe statue was sculpted by Pietro Lazzari (1895—1979) an Italian born artist who immigrated to the United States in 1925 when fascism in Italy was on the rise. He was educated at the Ornamental School of Rome where he became a Master Artist. Lazzari’s first solo exhibition took place in Paris. He became well known for his paintings, printmaking, and sculptures.\n\nThe zinc KEESE Family Monument in the Rock Creek Cemetery at Washing D.C. displays symbols representing The Knights of Pythias—a knight’s helmet surmounts a shield with a skull and crossbones and three letters, “F”, “C”, and “B”, which stand for the fraternal organization’s motto, FRIENDSHIP, CHARITY, and BENEVOLENCE, overlaid on crossed swords.\n\nThe Knights of Pythias was founded by Justus H. Rathbone in 1864, making it the very first fraternal organization to receive a charter under an Act of the United States Congress. The society is based on the Greek story of friendship from 400 B. C. between Damon and Pythias, members of a school founded by Pythagoras.\n\nAccording to their Website, Pythians: promote cooperation and friendship between people of good will, find happiness through service to mankind, believe that friendship is essential in life, view home life as a top priority, show an interest in public affairs, enhance their home communities, respect and honor the law of the land, and expand their influence with people of like interests and energy.\n\nPAPA\n\nMAX SCHUSTER\n\nBORN OCT. 12, 1850\n\nDIED SEPT. 17, 1895\n\nMOTHER\n\nLouisa Bindeman Schuster\n\n1853 – 1918\n\nThe rustic movement of the mid-nineteenth century was characterized by designs that were made to look like they were from the country. Elegant and slim curved lines in furniture gave way to bulkier and heavier forms made from pieces that came directly from the trees often with the bark still intact. Homes, cabins, and garden houses were designed in the rustic style eschewing classic designs. In decorative furniture this often took the form of chairs made from rough tree limbs curved to form arms and chair backs, chair legs made from tree roots growing upwards. In cabins, railings and the siding were made from unhewn logs with the bark still in place.\n\nIn funerary art, tombstones took on the look of tree stumps. The gravestones were purposefully designed to look like trees that had been cut and left in the cemetery to mark a grave. Most of these tree-stump tombstones were carved from limestone, which is easier to carve, though some are made from marble and even a few from granite. The creativity of the carvers were boundless. Thousands of tree-stump tombstones exist in nearly as many designs. Stonecutters displayed a wide variety of design, including this tree-stump design with a sculpture of a locomotive carved into the side of the stump. According to Silent City: A History of Forest Home Cemetery by John Gurda and published by the cemetery itself, the gravestone with the artful train engine is a nod the Max Schuster’s career as a rail road engineer."
