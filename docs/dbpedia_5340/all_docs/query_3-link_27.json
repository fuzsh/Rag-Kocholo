        "text": "Charleston has become increasingly popular over the years, so much so that celebrities are beginning to call Charleston home, too! We’ve rounded up some of the best known celebrities who call Charleston home and places that you may be able to spot them.\n\nBill Murray\n\nQuite possibly, the best known celebrity in Charleston is Bill Murray. When he’s not on the set of a movie, Bill Murray can be found just about anywhere in the city. His most frequent sightings are at the Joe Riley stadium watching a RiverDogs game. He’s a part owner in Rutledge Cab Company and Harold’s Cabin, both of which are located in the Wagner Terrace neighborhood in downtown Charleston. Bill has been known to crash local engagement photoshoots and a college party or two.\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nOnce the lead singer of Hootie and the Blowfish, this native Charlestonian can frequently be seen around town. He loves brunch on Sunday like many Charlestonians and likes to play secret shows at The Windjammer hotel on Isle of Palms. You can catch the full band together during their annual Homegrown Concert in August where they collect school supplies for under served children in Charleston County. Get your tickets fast, this concert sells out every year!\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nStephen Colbert became a well-known comedian from his time on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and his own show, The Colbert Report. Stephen Colbert spent the majority of his young life in the Charleston area. He attended Charleston’s Porter-Gaud School where he participated in school plays and was a contributor to the school’s newspaper. He doesn’t permanently live in the area but he has been spotted on Sullivan’s Island when visiting with his family.\n\nShepard Fairey\n\nHave you ever seen the Andre the Giant murals downtown on the College of Charleston campus, or the one on the Ravenel Bridge and wondered who painted them? Wonder no more! Shepard Fairey, most famously known for his iconic “HOPE” portrait of Barack Obama, created both well-known paintings. Born and raised in Charleston, Fairey’s street art and graphic design has been exhibited in contemporary museums all over the country. He is one of the most influential street artists in the world and is creating more large-scale murals all around Charleston.\n\nDanny McBride\n\nKnown for his hilarious roles in Pineapple Express and Despicable Me, comedian and actor Danny McBride quickly made Charleston his home after filming two seasons of Vice Principals in locations around town. Even better, thanks to the success of Vice Principals, McBride and his company, Rough House Pictures, have moved their headquarters to Charleston as well. You can find a large-scale mural of Vice Principals in the Park Circle neighborhood in North Charleston.\n\nSouthern Charm Cast"
