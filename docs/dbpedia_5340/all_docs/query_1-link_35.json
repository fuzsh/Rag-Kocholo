        "text": "The poem uses a fairly easy-to-read dialect that persists throughout the three stanzas. Stanton wrote this poem using what is likely meant to be a country dialect. This was likely chosen to convey a more fulsome and wise-sounding message about life and its hardships.\n\nKeep A-Goin’ Frank Lebby Stanton\n\nEf you strike a thorn or rose, Keep a-goin'! Ef it hails, or ef it snows, Keep a-goin! 'Taint no use to sit an' whine, When the fish ain't on yer line; Bait yer hook an' keep a-tryin'— Keep a-goin'!\n\nWhen the weather kills yer crop, Keep a-goin'! When you tumble from the top, Keep a-goin'! S'pose you're out of every dime, Bein' so ain't any crime; Tell the world you're feelin' prime— Keep a-goin'!\n\nWhen it looks like all is up, Keep a-goin'! Drain the sweetness from the cup, Keep a-goin'! See the wild birds on the wing, Hear the bells that sweetly ring, When you feel like sighin' sing— Keep a-goin'!\n\nSummary\n\n‘Keep A-Goin’’ by Frank Lebby Stanton is an inspirational and very simple poem about perseverance.\n\nThe poem’s three stanzas are almost identical in their message and meaning. The poet describes how important it is to persevere in the face of hardship. One should always stand up again when they’re knocked down, keep going if they run into thorns, and not give in to despair if any of several other disastrous things happen to them. The poem concludes by telling readers that not only is it important to keep going when things are hard, but it’s also important to preserve when things are going well.\n\nStructure and Form\n\n‘Keep A-Goin’’ by Frank Lebby Stanton is a three-stanza poem divided into sets of eight lines, known as octaves. These stanzas are quite consistent, using repetition to convey the poet’s message. The poem also follows a rhyme scheme of ABABCCCB in each stanza. The “B” rhymes are all the same, using the phrase “Keep a-goin’!”\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nIn this poem, the poet uses a few literary devices. These include:\n\nRefrain: the repetition of an entire phrase. For example, “Keep a-goin’!” which is used nine times in the poem, not including the title.\n\nDialect: this poem is a good example of how a dialect can be included in a poet’s composition. The phrase “Ef” is used instead of “if” and “a-goin’” is used instead of “going.”\n\nMetaphor: this poem is filled with metaphors or comparisons between two things that do not use “like” and “as.” For example, “ When the fish ain’t on yer line; / Bait yer hook an’ keep a-tryin.”\n\nDetailed Analysis\n\nStanza One\n\nEf you strike a thorn or rose,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nEf it hails, or ef it snows,\n\nKeep a-goin!\n\n‘Taint no use to sit an’ whine,\n\nWhen the fish ain’t on yer line;\n\nBait yer hook an’ keep a-tryin’—\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nIn the first stanza of this unique poem, the speaker begins by making a simple statement about how important it is to persevere in the face of hardship. They say that if you hit a metaphorical “thorne or rose,” to keep going. No matter what one runs into, good or bad, one should continue on their path.\n\nThe same is conveyed in the next lines, with the speaker mentioning the weather and then losing a fish on your hook. If the latter happens, one must keep baiting the same hook and trying again. Eventually, things will work out, or one will get where they’re going.\n\nStanza Two\n\nWhen the weather kills yer crop,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nWhen you tumble from the top,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nS’pose you’re out of every dime,\n\nBein’ so ain’t any crime;\n\nTell the world you’re feelin’ prime—\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nThe various metaphors for hardship continue in the next lines, with the speaker mentioning the death of crops, taking a “tumble from the top,” and losing one’s money. Even when faced with the hardest of challenges, it’s important to keep going and “Tell the world” that you’re fine and everything is alright.\n\nIt’s no crime to suffer or to lose something. One just needs to pick themselves up and try again. The chance of not doing so is the real issue in life.\n\nStanza Three\n\nWhen it looks like all is up,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nDrain the sweetness from the cup,\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nSee the wild birds on the wing,\n\nHear the bells that sweetly ring,\n\nWhen you feel like sighin’ sing—\n\nKeep a-goin’!\n\nIn the final stanza, the poet concludes by writing that when “all is up,” it’s also important to keep going. One needs to keep working and keep plowing forward. Ione should not stop when things are going well, as this is the perfect time to “Drain the sweetness from the cup” and “see the wild birds on the wing.”\n\nThe final line uses a great example of alliteration, with the speaker saying that if you “feel like sighin’,” to sing instead. This might lift one’s spirits and be a great way of moving through difficulty and into success.\n\nEach stanza of this poem, as readers are likely to have already noticed, utilizes the title phrase “Keep a-goin’” three times. The phrase is always used as the second and fourth lines and the eighth line. This creates an added structure that formats the poem succinctly and clearly. It also drives home the poet’s point in a way that another structure might not.\n\nOften, poets use repetition to ensure readers focus on one image or thought. In this case, one should “keep a-goin’” or “keep going” for as long as possible.\n\nFAQs\n\nSimilar Poetry\n\nReaders who enjoyed this poem should also consider reading some related poems.
