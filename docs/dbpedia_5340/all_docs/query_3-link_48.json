My labor went so smoothly and my baby was 9lb 10oz! No tearing! Seriously consider them if you’re planning to have a water/natural birth. Thank you all so much. Looking forward to the new space for our next baby.\n\n– Victoria Pasquale\n\nI can’t say enough positive things about CBP. My experience here was above and beyond what I could’ve asked for. These women truly empowered me to make my dreams of natural childbirth come true. And there’s no way I could’ve done it without them. We are happy and healthy and thriving thanks to the care we received at Charleston Birth Place. I’d give 10 stars if I could!\n\n– Brooke & Trenton Durham"
