        "text": "Complete Cheerful Cherub: 1001 Verses by Rebecca McCann, Preface: Mary Graham Bonner.\n\nI don't know who these two women were but there is a lot of wisdom in some of these.\n\nJust had a few photos and thought I would share them.\n\nIt's a really cheap book, or used to be. Just found my second copy. Not sure if it was popular or just is now unknown.\n\nDesigns and illustrations by McCann.\n\nThis is like a genre of books. Frank Lebby Stanton was another apparently contemporary with McCann and, in the '60s, Piet Hein published verses in the same vein titled \"Grooks\".\n\nI think Will Rogers pretty much falls into the same group.\n\nStanton might be best known for a poem titled \"Ain't the Roses Sweet\".\n\nAin't the Roses Sweet!\n\nThis world that we’re a livin’ in\n\nIs mighty hard to beat.\n\nYou get a thorn with every Rose\n\nBut ain’t the roses sweet?\n\nMy grandparents had a motto print of this hanging in the bedroom where I slept as a child when visiting. Every now and then I go searching for that print. There are plenty out there, but I have yet to find the one that strikes a chord.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cheerful_Cherub\n\nThe Cheerful Cherub is an American single-panel newspaper comic written and drawn by Rebecca McCann, originally published in the Chicago Evening Post and syndicated by George Matthew Adams.[1] Every installation features the title character, accompanied by his pet dog, speaking a short poem, generally in an iambic meter, offering wisdom, wit, observation, or insight on sundry topics, such as ambition,[2] education,[3] friendship,[4] lies,[5] sin,[6] and work.[7]\n\nThe author\n\nRebecca McCann was born in Quincy, Illinois and attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. Her biography is given in brief by her friend Mary Graham Bonner in the introduction to Complete Cheerful Cherub, but the exact dates of her birth and death—not to mention the dates of the comic's publication—are not clear; nonetheless, her death occurred in 1927, aged 32.[8] Bonner's memoir describes the circumstances under which Julian Mason, then-editor of the Chicago Evening Post, accidentally discovered McCann's Cherubs after they fell from her bag; the introduction also tells of the author's three marriages, the last to novelist Harvey Fergusson, and the publication of her book \"About Annabel.\" Bitter Sweet Poems, a book of McCann's serious poems, was published in 1929 two years after her death.\n\nReferences\n\n1 McCann, Rebecca.
