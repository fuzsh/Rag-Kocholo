Join us and make sure this is our best year yet! This popular event offers a great time, good music and food, with all proceeds supporting maritime historic preservation and education. We hope you can join us and, please, spread the word to your families, neighbors and friends!\n\nWE NEED YOU TO HELP SAVE THE HUNLEY!\n\nThe Hunley became the world’s first successful combat submarine in 1864 and then mysteriously vanished. She was located in 1995 by New York Times best selling author Clive Cussler and was raised from the ocean floor in 2000. The Hunley was not only an important relic in Naval history but was also a time capsule holding a wide array of fascinating artifacts from the 19th century. We are working to save the Hunley, the artifacts found within and build a submarine naval museum where our nation’s story under the waves can be told for generations to come.\n\nStandard Membership packages include: Annual subscription to The Blue Light Magazine, Discounted Tour Tickets, 10% Off Merchandise, Entrance to Annual Behind-the-Scenes Members-Only Tours, 1 Car Decal, and 1 Member Hat.\n\nIn 1995 Clive Cussler located the legendary submarine just off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. In 2000, the Hunley was successfully raised and in 2001 an international team of scientists began the process of carefully excavating her contents at a high-tech laboratory facility in North Charleston. To complete this historic journey, we must depend on donations from those who care about history. Will you help?\n\nWant to memorialize someone? If you wish for your donation to serve as a renewal of an existing membership or as a memorial, please send an email to membership@hunley.org letting us know how you’d like to apply your donation."
