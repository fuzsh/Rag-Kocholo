To protect his little daughter Florence, he places her in a boarding school but sends for her when she reaches the age of seventeen. When Hargreaves learns that several Black Hundred agents are after him, he withdraws a million dollars from various banks and prepares to flee. The Russian agents, led by Countess Olga, decide to secure the money, and to this end, they kidnap and threaten Florence. In the end, however, she is saved by newspaper reporter Jim Norton, who helps to round up the gang and reunites Florence with her father.",
