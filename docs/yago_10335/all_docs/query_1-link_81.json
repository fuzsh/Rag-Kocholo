Records and served as the first national chairman of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, died Sunday at Sutter Oaks Alzheimer's Hospital in Sacramento. He was 83.\n\nConkling, a native of East Orange, N.J., was born March 1, 1915. While attending Dartmouth College in the 1930s, he played trumpet in an orchestra and became friendly with musician Paul Weston.\n\nFollowing the war, Weston introduced Conkling to the founders of the newly formed Capitol Records -- Glenn Wallichs, Buddy DeSylva and Johnny Mercer. The trio hired Conkling as assistant manager of A&R, giving him his start at producing hit records with such luminaries as Nat King Cole, Jackie Gleason, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.\n\nConkling became Capitol's first vice president, and soon earned a reputation with artists -- including Les Paul and Dave Brubeck -- as one of the few executives who would greenlight musicians' experiments with new rhythms and instruments.\n\nIn 1951, William Paley and Frank Stanton of CBS invited Conkling to Columbia Records, where he became president and served on the board of directors. Conkling was responsible for starting the Columbia Record Club, (now Columbia House).\n\nIn 1956, Conkling once again joined with Weston, who was a part of a group that founded NARAS.\n\nIn the late '50s, Jack L. Warner approached Conkling about starting a record label, and Conkling assumed the title of president. Though Warner Bros. Records initially struggled, Conkling eventually signed such acts as the Everly Brothers, Peter, Paul & Mary, Connie Stevens and Edd (Kookie) Byrnes.\n\nAt age 46, Conkling retired from the record business and dedicated himself to philanthropy.\n\nIn 1981, President Ronald Reagan asked him to head up the Voice of America, which he did for two years.\n\nConkling is survived by his wife of 55 years, Donna King Conkling, five children, one brother, three sisters, 23 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 11022 Riverside Drive, North Hollywood.\n\nLaurette Conkling\n\nLatter-day Saint.

Biographical sketch provided by the filmmaker:\n\nChance Cook's long and distinguished career has led him through each of the media disciplines. His long-time friend, Chris Cobb, who he grew up with in Los Angeles, initially exposed Cook to the film industry while both were attending Brigham Young University. There he worked on several important projects for the LDS Church. Quickly proving his worth, he performed in various positions as a location scout, set dresser, production assistant, second and first assistant director. He then suddenly left film to finish his degree in communications.\n\nCook graduated from the University of Utah with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications/Public Relations and joined the NBC affiliate in Salt Lake City, Utah (KSL Television) rising through the ranks from master control operator, contributing writer to associate producer. When the new local programming department was founded in late 1996, Cook was promoted to become the only producer in the department under the department's director, Doug Miller.\n\nFrom that point, Cook wrote and produced three weekly programs ranging from an outdoor-oriented show hosted by renown outdoor enthusiast Doug Miller to a ski program and The Utah Business Show hosted by Keith McCord. Cook turned out 50 brand new programs each year for the Outdoors Show With Doug Miller and The Utah Business Show.

He has also assisted on First Night coverage and co-wrote and produced KSL's lineup of special Olympic programming, 2002 Up Close and 2002 Preview, in preparation towards the upcoming 2002 Olympic Winter Games. During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games his features could be seen on SLC Live. Cook was also approached by E! Entertainment and interviewed Gold Medalist Picabo Street before the Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City.\n\nFor years the KSL Local Programming Department dominated local and regional awards relating to lifestyle programs, sports, non-news segments and features. Cook's work on Outdoors With Doug Miller, Ski Utah and The Utah Business Show was also recognized by the Utah Broadcasting Association and The Society of Professional Journalists. He also won several Tellys. Cook was also prestigiously nominated as the \"Chamber Champion\" in 1998 by the Salt Lake Area Chamber of Commerce and \"Media Advocate of the Year\" in 1997 by the Small Business Administration.\n\nAfter the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, the local programming department was eliminated by KSL management and Cook left the organization to pursue his true passions -- Travel and human powered outdoor adventure consisting of canyoneering, whitewater rafting, hiking and skiing.\n\nChance Cook now is a freelance travel and adventure writer based in Salt Lake City, Utah and his work has been published in the regional magazine Amazing Oudoors.com and currently online at Utah Outdoors.com.

Jay Cox\n\nLatter-day Saint (Raised in a devout Latter-day Saint home, but not currently active in the Church). Best known as the screenwriter of the hit feature film \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (2002), which starred Reese Witherspoon as a woman torn between her rural Southern heritage and her new successful life in New York City. Previously wrote the little-known mystery film \"The Thing in Bob's Garage\" (1998). In 2003 Cox wrote and directed the low-budget feature film \"Latter Days,\" marking his directorial debut. Billed as a GLBT romantic comedy, \"Latter Days\" tells the story of a promiscuous GLBT party boy (\"Christian\", played by Wesley A. Ramsey) who seduces a Latter-day Saint missionary (\"Elder Aaron Davis,\" played by Steve Sandvoss) on a bet, and then finds himself actually falling in love with him. Christian is significantly changed as he learns about spirituality and Christian values from the missionary, while the missionary in turn changes significantly as he leaves his mission and converts to a GLBT lifestyle. Much of the story is autobiographical, drawing from Cox's own background as a Latter-day Saint, which he eventually left to embrace homosexuality. The conflicts between Cox and his family over his decisions are mirrored in some of the movie's dramatic and most memorable moments. With its open criticism of the shallowness of the GLBT lifestyle as lived by Christian early in the film, \"Latter Days\" drew praise from many GLBT viewers as being something significantly moving and inspiring, a film that went beyond the typical GLBT film. The film garnered a number of audience choice awards at GLBT film festivals. Mainstream film critics, however, largely dismissed the film as amateurish at best. A scheduled screening in a Salt Lake City art house theater run by a national chain was cancelled due the film's lack of cinematic quality and low production values. The film, which contained graphic sex and nudity, was largely ignored by the Latter-day Saint community and failed to generate the level of controversy hoped for by the film's promoters in order to fuel broader interest and bigger box office returns. Cox is also credited with small roles in the low budget films \"Nightmare Sisters\" (1987) and \"The Offspring\" (1987). Gary R. Cox\n\nGary Cox\n\nLives Utah. Sometimes credited as: Gary Cox.

Born in 1954 in New York. Producer for the PBS documentary series \"Frontline.\" Producer of the autobiographical \"Frontline\" documentary \"Secret Daughter\" (1996). In this emotionally gripping program, Cross traces her childhood and family background. Her mother was Norma Greve, a Latter-day Saint woman from Pocatello, Idaho. Cross's father, who was not LDS, was Jimmy Cross (James Cross), a black song-and-dance man who was \"Stump\" in the well-known performing team \"Stump and Stumpy.\" Jimmy Cross was a major influence on white comedians of his time, including Jerry Lewis. Soon after June was born in 1954. Norma took the baby and fled from Jimmy Cross in 1957 because of his drinking, drug use and violence toward her. As June matured and her complexion darkened, she and her mother encountered racist reactions from their Manhattan, New York neighbors, including a petition from residents in their apartment building demanding that they leave. Norma was worried that being raised in all-white world by would ruin June's sense of identity. Norma asked friends of hers - a middle-class black couple in Atlantic City, New Jersey - to raise June. After giving up her daughter, Norma cried every night and wrote daily letters to the girl. June returned to live with Norma during the Summers. When June was 7 year old, her mother married famed actor/comedian Larry Storch, star of the TV series \"F Troop\" (as \"Randolph Agarn\"). June's mother began using the name she would be known by the rest of her life: \"Norma Storch.\" Norma and Larry Storch told everybody that June was their \"adopted daughter,\" who lived most of the year with an African-American family. The documentary chronicles all of this and also features June Cross's visit to her Latter-day Saint relatives in Idaho.
