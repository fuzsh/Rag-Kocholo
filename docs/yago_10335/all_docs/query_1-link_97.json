        "text": "Zudora Episode #2: The Mystery of the Sleeping House: Two reels of approximately 2,000 feet, November 30, 1914.\n\nA story teeming with love and the fiery romantic impulsiveness of the East is told in the two-reel drama, the second episode in Thanhouser’s production of Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman’s serial photoplay.\n\nPrint source: Tannhauser Collection/Essex Film Club, 29 minutes 21 seconds.\n\nDirected by Frederick Sullivan. Scenario by Lloyd F. Lonergan, based on a story by Dr. Daniel Carson Goodman. Photographed by Carl Louis Gregory.\n\nCast: James Cruze (Hassam Ali; later, Jim Baird, a reporter), Marguerite Snow (Zudora, Hassam Ali’s neice), Harry Benham (John Storm), Helen Badgley, Sidney Bracy (Tom Hunt, a detective).\n\nAka: Zudora in the Twenty Million Dollar Mystery, aka The Twenty Million Dollar Mystery. Episode 2 aka The Sleeping House Mystery, Working title: The Frozen Laugh, Alternate working title: The Mystery of the Frozen Laugh.\n\nOriginal music composed and performed by Ben Model (silentfilmmusic.com).\n\nA mysterious and exotic secret society conducts elaborate ceremonies in American suburbia with the kidnapped heroine Zudora who they want to marry off to their leader as a substitute for the real princess who was taken by a rival tribe back in India. The sets range from cheap and cheesy (the outside-of-the-window backdrops, painted stone walls), to elaborately and skillfully decorated.\n\nClimactic inter-cutting between three or four simultaneous action scenes is a new technique, and the use of inter-titles shows the transition from old-style (identifying the action in the next scene) to the new style (dialogue).\n\nBecause each episode was meant to be a self-contained story, the last-second rescue here eliminates a potential cliff-hanger ending"
