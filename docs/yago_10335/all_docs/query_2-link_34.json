When I signed up to do Classic Movie Man's Val Lewton Blogathon a few weeks ago I didn't realize it was taking place on Halloween. Of course I signed on to write about A Star Is Born. Not very scary! Okay, sometimes Fredric March's eyebrows are a bit scary. With that said, nobody wants to cry on Halloween unless it's a few tears from being scared to bits.\n\nI've already screen grabbed the film to do one of my photo reviews but I'll post it in a couple of days. There are quite a few horror films being covered in the Blogathon today that can be found by clicking the link HERE. A real treat for anyone who loves a good scare and excellent articles by my fellow bloggers.\n\nWhile I'm here let's have a look at some of our favorite stars getting into the Halloween spirit.\n\nThe only thing scary here is Marguerite Chapman possibly bending over to far to retrieve another pumpkin.\n\nScary only because the studio couldn't afford a decent copy of Dracula for Pier Angeli to read.\n\nScary that Esther Williams would attempt pumpkin carving in a bathing suit while sitting in hay.\n\nEva Gabor says \"Hey look at me, over here in the hay with my cat that looks like it just went through a leaf blower. Does this blouse make me look sexy?\" I'm frightened! Anyone else?\n\nRosalind Russell. Nothing scary here other than Ava Gardner will probably claw her eyes out the moment she climbs down from that pumpkin for looking so gorgeous. Meeooww Hiisss!\n\nMartha Vickers has fallen into the category of 'sexy witch'. I wish just once these old celebs had gone all out and done something scary. Get in there and throw a wart on your face, cover your legs to the knee.\n\nLillian Wells showing her range with her scared face. Yes, that cat is frightening!\n\nSee! This is how you do scary. Joan Crawford attempts blonde vamp. No costume required. Just the desire to be Mae West for a day.\n\nHappy Halloween everyone! Have a safe one.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nQuiet On The Set: Part Three\n\nIt's time to check in with our favorite classic stars in some behind the scenes photos.\n\nAlice Faye and Rudy Vallee take a break on the set of \"George White's Scandals\" 1934\n\nHedy Lamarr adjusts her costume on the set of \"Samson and Delilah\" 1949\n\nShirley Temple spends time in hair and makeup on a Twentieth Century Fox set.\n\nVincent Price gets ready for some scares.\n\nGene Tierney gets a quick rest in on the set of \"Leave Her to Heaven\"\n\n1945\n\nMyrna Loy gets ready to shoot a scene on the set of \"The Rains Came\" 1939\n\nDeborah Kerr gets a surprise as she steps out of her trailer.

I'm working on my Betty Compson bio that will be up this weekend but in the meantime let's have a look at our classic stars with their lovable companions. (No, not their squeeze of the week or their latest spouse but loyal companions, the four legged kind!)\n\nSilent actress, Hope Hampton poses with her fluffy Borzoi.\n\nHedy Lamarr and her husband, Gene Markey pose with their Great Dane.\n\nDorothy Moore cools off with her little cuties.\n\nOh, Clara Bow! That looks like a handful. Stick to Chow Chows.\n\nWe're used to seeing Jayne Mansfield with her beloved Chihuahuas but apparently she's a cat lover too.\n\nMiriam Hopkins shares a moment with her twin babies.\n\nI think Helen Twelvetrees has kidnapped Asta!\n\nGet out of here, Myrna Loy! Come back with something that can be house trained and isn't screen used.\n\nThat is one cute face! Ann Sothern looks good too.\n\nAl Jolson spends some leisure time with his loyal friend.\n\nShelley Winters tries a few tricks by the pool.\n\nJudy Garland with her sweet little Pekingese puppies.\n\nNorma Shearer and her Cocker Spaniels look like a Norman Rockwell painting.\n\nCarole Lombard was such an animal lover and she looks gorgeous here. That's one lucky dog!\n\nThanks for stopping by everyone and have a great weekend. I hope you'll return for my Betty Compson bio, coming soon.\n\nOh, I was a bit busy today doing a guest review for our friend Nate. If you want to read my review of \"Gomorrah\" you can find it HERE or just go over and say hello to Nate anyway.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nBetty Compson (1897-1974)\n\nThe petite Utah native with her blond curls and bright blue eyes, found herself working at an early age to help support her mother upon her fathers death. A talented violinist, she made a decent living on stage in Salt Lake City. Like many before her, vaudeville gave her exposure at an early age. Another high school drop out who was taking home $15 a week at the ripe old age of 16.\n\nI've looked at this signature at all angles and in different light and it does appear to be ink but just to be sure I do have a spare autograph for Betty.\n\nAt 18 she was ready to go on tour with her mother in tow, eventually making her way to the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles. It was there that she was discovered by the comedic producer, Al Christie who immediately cast her in one reel comedic shorts with that lovable, Fatty Arbuckle. (It seems like every up and coming comedic actress had to pay their dues by working alongside Fatty. I guess a jobs a job!)\n\nBetty co-starred in five shorts during 1915 for the Nestor Film Company. By 1916 she was a popular leading lady, often taking top billing in close to 40 films that year. Often starring with Lee Moran, Eddie Lyons, Harry Rattenberry, Ethel Lynne and Stella Adams.\n\nAlthough Betty was kept busy, able to make a comfortable living making comedic shorts for the next two years it was the end of the decade when she first found real success with the help of director/writer George Loane Tucker who cast her opposite Lon Chaney in \"The Miracle Man\" 1919. It was also during this time that the studio suggested Betty dye her hair a dark brown to fit with her onscreen persona as the sweet, innocent, girl next door.\n\n\"The Miracle Man\" and Betty were such a critical success that she was signed to a five year contract with Paramount Studios. One of the studios most popular stars with an income to rival her peers at $5,000 a week by the end of 1924. She could now afford the finest things and she moved her doting mother out of their bungalow into a roomy home in Hollywood. Everything a girl could ask for at the age of 22. Most of her peers were married by age 18 or spending their off hours partying after work but Betty was content with a casual date here and there then time with her mother on the weekends, for now anyway.\n\nBetty in \"The Little Minister\" 1921\n\nBy 1921 she was taking advantage of her newfound popularity by branching out into dramatic and romantic roles with the studio's blessing. By the end of the year she would also find herself running her own production company where she would have complete control over her films and co-stars as well as poetic license as she began producing her own films. The first film for Betty to show her creativity behind and in front of the cameras would be \"Prisoner of Love\" 1921 co-starring Ralph Lewis.\n\nTaking top billing above Milton Stills in the successful \"At the End of the World\" 1921 then \"The Bonded Woman\" 1922 with Richard Dix and John Bowers. (Unfortunately, both silent films have been lost or destroyed like so many early films.) All seven of Compson's full length pictures from 1922 and so many after that are assumed to be lost.\n\nBetty's signature from my collection, c. early 1960s. (Click for a larger view)\n\nBetty would continue to work steadily in 1923, starring in another five films after traveling abroad where she signed on to star in several films for a London production company. One of which was titled \"Woman to Woman\" and written by a young Brit who was given odd work at the London studio. His name was Alfred Hitchcock. (Although the film has been reviewed by several people on IMDb I have never seen it nor do I know if it's even available. Perhaps if anyone knows they can share it with the rest of us. )\n\nCompson would have the good fortune of starring in another two films written by Hitchcock the following year as well. \" White Shadows\" 1924, co-starring Clive Brook and Henry Victor then in the romantic drama, \"Dangerous Virtue\". Betty would also get the opportunity to star alongside the dashing, Warner Baxter that year in \"The Female\" which also starred the very talented, Noah Beery.\n\nBetty Compson in \"The Pony Express\" 1925\n\nBack from London at the end of 1924, Betty would star in \"The Garden of Weeds\", opposite Warner Baxter. The film was directed by someone she had not worked with previously. James Cruze, who had also started his career in front of the camera in the late 1900s, appearing in close to 100 shorts himself before finding his niche behind the camera as a producer/director. By the time filming wrapped on \"The Garden of Weeds\", Betty was being courted by Cruze, falling in love for the first time. (James was newly divorced, having dissolved his union with his first wife, silent actress, Marguerite Snow, the year before.)\n\nBy the end of 1925, Compson had wrapped up another seven films for Famous Players Lasky, taking off just long enough to wed the tall, lanky Cruze. With both having very successful careers, the next step would be to find a large mansion of their own where they could start their lives together. At the suggestion of the studio, they needed something grand enough to show success, wealth, a lifestyle expected of Hollywood elite.\n\nIn 1919, the silent actor, Charles Ray purchased a newly built estate in a recently developed area of Los Angeles, named Beverly Hills. The home with it's large corner lot had everything a star could ask for during the early days of 'stars living the good life'. Like many actors before him and since, Ray thought the money from motion pictures would flow for years so he spared no expense on his home on North Camden Drive during the first part of the 1920s. Gold fixtures, a crystal bathtub, the finest silver, china, furnishings for entertaining his peers. He added servants quarters and new landscaping, making the home one of the finest on the block with it's unique architecture and thatched, green roof.\n\nSadly, Ray invested all of his savings into backing a motion picture which flopped, costing him everything in 1923. The first thing that had to go in order for Ray to survive his bad investment, was his Beverly Hills home. It would sit on the market until newlyweds, the Cruze's grabbed it up two years later.\n\nOther famous residents on North Camden Drive during this time were, Monte Blue, Mabel Normand, and Blanche Sweet. During the 1930s, Leslie Howard would also reside on the same street, buying his home from the young starlet, Hedy Lamarr. (I'll be featuring all of these home in future posts so stay tuned!)\n\nWith Jack Holt in \"Eve's Secret\" 1925\n\nThe mansion as it appeared during the early 1920s when Charles Ray resided there at 901 North Camden Drive.\n\nA different view of the estate in a postcard during the mid 1920s when Betty Compson and James Cruze resided in the home. (Yes, it's still standing as you'll see shortly!)\n\nBetty Compson shares a moment with Viola Dana and her husband, actor/director, James Cruz (standing) in their home during the mid 1920s. (It's a bit odd to place a piano in front of your wood burning fireplace but that's just me!)\n\nBetty would only star in three pictures during 1926, opting to spend more time at home while Cruze worked steadily, directing motion pictures. Both were hoping to start a family but sadly that would not come to pass.\n\nShe went back to work full time in 1927, still a box office draw with her romantic lead status intact. No longer under contract for Lasky Studios she found herself with even better roles, taking direction from Walter Lang in the crime/drama \"The Ladybird\" then \"Love Me and the World is Mine\" at her new home, Universal Pictures. This time with Mary Philbin receiving top billing.\n\nThe petite, 5'2 actress gets into the Christmas spirit.\n\nTaking a break from a bit of yard work.\n\nDuring 1928, Compson found herself playing a prostitute in the highly acclaimed \"The Docks of New York\" with Josef von Sternberg at the helm and George Bancroft as her leading man. However it was her follow up film, \"The Barker\" which co-starred, Dorothy MacKaill, Milton Stills and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that year that would provide her with her biggest accolades. Betty, was nominated for an Academy Award the following year (the very first Oscars) for her portrayal of a carnival girl, Carrie in the drama which had actual talking dialogue added during several scenes. She would lose out to Mary Pickford who would win the first Oscar for a Leading Actress for her performance in \"Coquette\".\n\nBy 1929, Betty's husband Cruze, had started his own production company where he would direct my favorite film of hers, \"The Great Gabbo\". The musical, drama has the feel of \"Phantom of the Opera\" with Eric von Stroheim playing a rather odd and terrifying figure, Gabbo, who expresses himself through his ventriloquist dummy as he pursues his assistant, Mary, played by Compson. (If you've seen this film I would love to get your opinion of it, see if you enjoyed it as much as I did) I saw a movie back in the 1978 as a young teen that reminded me so much of \"The Great Gabbo\", titled \"Magic\". It starred Anthony Hopkins who also ran around with his creepy ventriloquist dummy, although it had much more violence, a darker turn as I recall now. And now that I think about it I can't help but wonder if the writer of \"Magic\" got some of his ideas from von Stroheim's character so long ago. (There's just something about using a mannequin to terrorize others that ups the creep factor ten fold!)\n\nPoster courtesy of MoviePosterDB.com\n\nBetty with Gustaf Lovas, in \"The Great Gabbo\" 1929\n\nBy the end of 1929 and with the advent of talkies, the studios were producing musicals to showcase their silent stars finally singing, dancing and yes, speaking dialogue. With their all star casts each studio churned out their own version, with Warner Brothers showcasing their stars in \"The Show of Shows\". Betty Conpson would take the stage alongside, Noah Beery, John Barrymore, Mary Astor, Richard Barthelmess, Monte Blue, Sally Blane, Louise Fazenda, Viola Dana, Doug Fairbanks Jr., Sally Eilers, the Costello sisters, Dolores and Helene with Frank Fay as the Master of Ceremonies. Betty would get two numbers in the film, singing The Pirate Number and Lady Luck.\n\nWith Chester Morris in \"The Case of Sergeant Grischa\" 1930\n\nBy 1930 she was starring with Chester Morris in \"The Case of Sergeant Grischa at RKO Pictures and separated from her husband, James. They would divorce in May of that year and their home on Camden Drive would be sold. (Just a short time later, MGM studio mogul, Sam Goldwyn would purchase the property, adding a cement pool, a pool house, a large guest cottage, a tennis court and lush gardens where he would entertain guests with his wife, Frances, throughout the 1930s and 40s. (The home still stands today in all of it's grandeur.) This is also the home where Sam Goldwyn Jr. would spend his childhood.\n\nThe home at 901 North Camden Drive, Beverly Hills as it appears today via Google Earth. You can see the original structure with it's odd thatched roof. Of course there are several new additions to the original home, like a large garage then a new tennis court.\n\nA closer view looking from the backyard to the North. After Betty and James sold the home to Sam Goldwyn the home next door was purchased and leveled to make way for a large drive, garage and guest house. The original structure still stands as it did during the mid 1910s with a new roof, and renovations, of course.\n\nIn this view you can clearly see the original part of the house with it's interesting design, odd angled roof.\n\nAgain, how it appeared during the 1920s for reference.\n\nLooking through the side gate towards the back of the home as it appears via Google Earth today.\n\nA front view from North Camden Drive.\n\nLooking back towards the pool house which sits directly to the left of the main house.\n\nThe newly divorced starlet, kept busy throughout 1930, appearing in ten feature films for Warner Brothers Studios like \"Isle of Escape\" co-starring Myrna Loy and Monte Blue then \"Those Who Dance\" with Lila Lee, Monte Blue and William Boyd. This would be her most successful film of that year. Betty would also appear in her first western, talkie \"The Spoilers\" which starred Hollywood favorite, Gary Cooper.\n\nOne of the reasons that Compson divorced her husband, James Cruze was due to his constant drinking which put a strain on their marriage as well as his health and his desire to focus on work. It was soon after their divorce that Betty also came to realize, Cruze did not pay his income taxes either. For years she would be saddled with this burden as his career declined, his income stopped, she became liable as his spouse when the taxes were incurred. When it was all said and done she would pay the majority of the debt in excess of $150,,000. Quite a large sum of money during the early 30s. She would eventually have to sell her home, car and jewels just to avoid bankruptcy herself.\n\nBy 1931, Compson had been released from Warner Brothers, but she found steady work through RKO Pictures, being offered a short term contract there. She was still drawing an audience and holding onto her leading lady status. Appearing in \"The Lady Refuses\" with John Darrow then the successful comedy \"The Virtuous Husband\" with Jean Arthur and Elliott Nugent. Of course the film I remember most of hers during that year is \"Three Who Loved\" co-starring Conrad Nagel, Robert Ames and Dickie Moore.\n\nBetty was still very beautiful at 34 with her Mae Murray-esque bee stung lips and her waves of blonde locks as she gets the attention of both male leads. She could hold her own with the best of them in dramas, musicals or comedies. Of course you had to have talent to sustain your career once talkies came along and fresh faces crowded their way through those studio gates hoping to climb that elusive ladder to success and leading lady status.\n\nWith John Darrow in \"The Lady Refuses\" 1931\n\nIn just a few short months, Betty found herself without a studio for the first time in her career. RKO had only given her stability for one year then she was finding work with smaller production companies. She landed a role in the drama \"Silver Lining\" for Patrician Pictures with the fresh faced, Maureen O'Sullivan taking the lead role. Her only other film during 1932 was the action/crime, drama \"Guilty or Not Guilty\". Your typical B rated gangster flick that filled theater seats and paid the bills.\n\nShe would appear in three more, not so memorable films during 1933. First for Monogram Pictures then a drama titled \"Destination Unknown\" for Universal, starring Ralph Bellamy, Pat O'Brien and Alan Hale. Perhaps Betty didn't care that much for work that year as she became a newlywed for the second time upon her marriage to agent/producer, Irving Weinberg.\n\nBetty's very modern home in Beverly Hills where she would reside during the 1930s and for several years with her second husband, Irving Weinberg. (Unfortunately, I don't know the physical address of this home to see what it looks like today or to know if it still exists.)\n\nBetty did manage to find work throughout the rest of the 1930s although she often took smaller parts in films at lesser known studios. Not even 40, she was sometimes cast as the mother to the up and comers. Of course she didn't shy away from that as she knew a steady paycheck was important to rebuild her financial security. Very wise as she would find herself divorced for a second time by the end of 1937.\n\nAt the end of the decade roles were offered in low budget films and like most of Hollywood, she did a screen test for \"Gone With the Wind\" hoping to get the part of Belle Watling. She would also appear in the classic, \"Strange Cargo\" 1940 which starred Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, although she was uncredited.\n\nAs 1941 rolled around, Alfred Hitchcock was in Hollywood, now directing and taking the US by storm. Of course he remembered Betty and offered her a small part in the comedy, Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" starring Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard. She was back at RKO and appearing in a great film even if it was for one picture.\n\nOnce her scenes were completed she was offered a couple of parts back at Monogram, appearing in \"Invisible Ghost\" with Bela Lugosi and her old pal, Ernie Adams. In 1943, Betty had a small part in \"Danger! Women at Work\" which starred Patsy Kelly, Isabel Jewell, Mary Brian and Wanda McKay. I've always wanted to see this film with it's fabulous cast of funny ladies but to my knowledge it's not available. Have any of you had the pleasure of seeing it?\n\nBy 1944, Betty was in love again, marrying businessman, Silvius John Gall that year. She would retire from acting for good in 1948 with her last on screen appearance as Mrs. Davenport in the crime/drama, \"Second Chance\" that year. With her loving husband supporting her, she would go on to start her own cosmetic label then in later years they would run a business selling/marketing personalized ashtrays near their home in Glendale, California.\n\nBetty and Silvius would remain together, happily married until his death in 1962. Just one year after Betty lost her mother, Mary who she had remained close to and supported financially throughout her life. Betty would continue on alone until her death in 1974 of a heart attack. She was buried at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California, alongside her mother. Their grave site can be found HERE.\n\nBetty Compson's career spanned four decades and included over 100 films. Perhaps you have a favorite of hers that you'd like to share but until then please enjoy the below scene of her in \"The Docks of New York\" 1928. (She's just the cutest in this scene even while smoking like a chimney and complaining!)\n\nThanks so much for stopping by and for all of you stateside, have a wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nGet Your Motor Runnin: Part Three\n\nI thought it would be fun to have another look at our favorite stars with their fabulous cars. You may recall that I usually get my When Fur Was Fabulous posts underway by this time every year but with this warm weather I can't bear to look at stars in heavy fur. Not when I'm still in shorts and t-shirts most days.\n\nClark Gable poses in his roadster.\n\nFrank Sinatra tries to assist his wife, Ava Gardner while out for a drive.

I've kept it focused on classic cinema and classic stars.\n\nI'm making an exception today for Michael Jackson. Before you freak out hear me out! Michael loved Elizabeth Taylor. They were friends and he admired Marlon Brando and James Cagney, While he had his issues he was an amazing entertainer as you will soon see.\n\nI'm dedicating this post and this day to him and his greatest performance where he shines and he makes me think of the amazing, Charlie Chaplin. If you haven't seen this live performance please do yourself a favor and watch it through on full screen. You'll grow to appreciate the gift that he had for entertaining as well as his channeling of Chaplin, Cagney and himself, the genius that he was.\n\nPlease enjoy this video as much as I have since his passing. Very seldom are we given this much talent in one human being!\n\nI miss you, Michael!\n\nCagney, Taylor, Chaplin and Jackson all had their flaws but please don't discuss them here.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nBook Chat!\n\nWith Christmas approaching, I'm sure many of you, like myself have a book or two on your Holiday Wish List. I thought I would take a moment to share some of the books that I've purchased recently and a few that I hope to get as a gift or even buy for myself. (Can't go wrong with Amazon gift cards!)\n\nSome of the books that I've purchased recently are:\n\nMae West, It Ain't No Sin\n\nThe Hollywood Studios Which takes a look at how the studios were run between the 20s and 40s.\n\nThe Art of the Great Studio Photographers, 1925-1940\n\nHollywood: The Pioneers by Kevin Brownlow.

Lastly, I can't wait to get Silent Movies: The Birth of Film and the Triumph of Movie Culture.\n\nI'm anxious to see what my blog visitors are reading and which books you have on your own holiday wish list. So let's discuss!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nShirley's Back.... with Fabulous Hats!\n\nI know you've all missed Shirley and her candid thoughts on old Hollywood hats so she's back! Let's get started before Ivan G. arrives with his petition to shut this blog down.\n\nFor the three of you who don't know who Shirley is, it's Shirley Temple, my co-host. She's not holding back either so if you're ready, so am I!\n\nWynne Gibson is divine in her beanie and jewels. Shirley: \"She smokes so imagine this is Joan Crawford at 12. By 30 Wynne will regret this and she'll be at a pawn shop, hawking her jewels for food and Camels with her looks gone!\" Let's take it easy on the anti-smoking campaigns!\n\nVivien Leigh, always so sweet and innocent and put together! Shirley: \"You obviously haven't read any of Olivier's sappy love letters. I bet her knees are quivering here!\" You're just awful, Shirley..I'm going to have a talk with your mother!\n\nElsa Lanchester looks eloquent and so pretty. I'm a big fan. Aren't you, Shirley? Shirley: \"I think she's in mourning. It continued for at least 10 years.\" That's a third of her marriage to Laughton! Shirley: \"I know! I'm surprised it wasn't more too!\"\n\nNorma Talmadge, in a very good photo and a very cute hat. Shirley: \"She should stick to profile shots like this. From straight on she could pass as Robert Mitchum's double and I think she borrowed that dress from the not famous sister!\" There's nothing wrong with her dress. Shirley: \"Not if you're a potato farmer.\"\n\nMarion Davies is lovely in one of her 30s publicity portraits. Shirley: \"Clearly, this was a couple of years after she was hunting down booze in San Simeon elevators like a truffle hound. She's bloated up like a deer on a salt lick bender!\" Thank goodness, Hearst is long gone, otherwise you would be ending up washed up on a beach in some shabby luggage. Shirley: \"I'm being nice here. I didn't even mention her eyebrows!\"\n\nToby Wing looks very pretty here. Shirley: \"She's a round faced, Jean Harlow want to be but I do like her blouse and the fact that she didn't go over the top with red lipstick!\" Well, there is that!\n\nHope Hampton has left me speechless so I'll leave it to you, Shirley. Shirley: \"She's like a Mae West meets Joan Blondell hybrid here! Is this supposed to be a tribute to sailors or did the costume department throw everything white into the photo hoping she would be a good sport about it?\" I'll never look at tassels in the same way! Shirley: \"Same here! She's also ruined Veteran's Day, the color white, pleats and bamboo wallpaper for me!\" I'm just thankful you gave black turtlenecks a pass, Shirley!\n\nLana Turner looks great in black. Who doesn't like Lana? Shirley: \"Another star in mourning but this time she's in mourning to stay out of prison!\" I know who doesn't like Lana Turner....Bottom tier gangsters!\" We better move this along.\n\nI love Betty Compson's hat. Shirley: \"She's clearly snubbing Mary Pickford here. You can tell by the smirk on her face that she wants to rip some ringlets from their pasted on roots!\" Well, we all love a good cat fight. Dig those two divas up!\n\nIf you want to dish on these hats please leave a comment and just know that I have no control over Shirley. Well, I do but what fun would it be to ban my imaginary co-host?\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWhen Fur Was Fabulous\n\nWhile it's not cold here it's still winter and with that it's time to bring back our classic stars in their fabulous furs.\n\nLana Turner steps out with Peter Lawford.\n\nJayne Mansfield opts for a black wrap with her evening gown.

What in the world, Pola?\n\nLupe Velez sizzles. (Watch and learn, Marion!)\n\nKim Hunter poses in her short length fur and evening gown. (Is it me or is that gown too summery for the dark fur and then her hairstyle is rather distracting and not flattering on her?)\n\nLoretta Young, drapes herself in mink which fits her image. Prim, and proper!\n\nJoan Bennett is picture perfect in her matching fur wrap.\n\nHedy Lamarr opts for a white mini. Be sweet, Hedy and loan it out to Kim Hunter.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the furs or the attire featured here in the comments. Also, I do realize that fur is not acceptable to wear now and I assure you I am not sitting here in fur pajamas. : )\n\nI hope you are all toasty warm wherever you are as the holidays approach.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nWishing you a Merry Christmas!\n\nRita Hayworth, lovely in her winter wear.\n\nJoan Leslie gets into the Christmas spirit.\n\nJune Haver has a special surprise for Santa.\n\nVera Ellen spreads some Christmas cheer.\n\nDeanna Durbin sings her way into Christmas.\n\nDorothy Lamour has managed to blind us all with her fancy Christmas dress.\n\nMary Martin decorates her giant tree.\n\nDorothy Abbott makes a stunning ice princess.\n\nJoan Marsh makes for a very sexy Santa.\n\nJune Allison shows her sweet smile as she gets ready to decorate for the holidays.\n\nMarilyn Maxwell sets her home aglow so Santa can find her.

With the Academy Awards soon approaching, I'll be starting where I left off with our previous Oscars, 1939. Also known as the 12th Annual Academy Awards.\n\nLet's have a look at the winners, the losers, the snubs and a bit of trivia for that year. The year that will forever be known as the year of the blockbuster, best films of the decade. I also wonder just how many actors, directors said to themselves, \"Damn you, MGM!\"\n\nBest Picture:\n\nGone With the Wind (Winner), Dark Victory, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka, Stagecoach, Love Affair, Of Mice and Men, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights\n\nBest Actor:\n\nRobert Donat (Winner) for \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\", Clark Gable for \"Gone With the Wind\", Laurence Olivier for \"Wuthering Heights\", Mickey Rooney for \"Babes in Arms\", James Stewart for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"\n\nBest Actress:\n\nVivien Leigh (Winner) for \"Gone With the Wind\", Bette Davis for \"Dark Victory\", Irene Dunne for \"Love Affair\", Greta Garbo for \"Ninotchka\", Greer Garson for \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\"\n\nSupporting Actor:\n\nThomas Mitchell (Winner) for \"Stagecoach\", Brian Aherne for \"Juarez\", Harry Carey for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", Brian Donlevy for \"Beau Geste\", Claude Rains for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"\n\nSupporting Actress:\n\nHattie McDaniel (Winner) for \"Gone With the Wind\", Olivia de Havilland for \"Gone With the Wind\", Geraldine Fitzgerald for \"Wuthering Heights\", Edna May Oliver for \"Drums Along the Mohawk\", Maria Ouspenskaya for \"Love Affair\"\n\nBest Director:\n\nVictor Fleming (Winner) for \"Gone With the Wind\", Frank Capra for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", John Ford for \"Stagecoach\", Sam Wood for \"Goodbye Mr. Chips\", William Wyler for \"Wuthering Heights\"\n\nDirector, Victor Fleming with Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh on the set of \"Gone With the Wind\" 1938\n\nOscar Snubs and Omissions:\n\nCharles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara for their performances in\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nWilliam Holden for \"Golden Boy\"\n\nIngrid Bergman and Leslie Howard for \"Intermezzo\"\n\nLeslie Howard for \"Gone With the Wind\"\n\nBilly Wilder for direction, Claudette Colbert for Best Actress for \"Midnight\" also snubbed for Best Screenplay\n\nMerle Oberon for \"Wuthering Heights\"\n\nErnst Lubitsch, Best Director for \"Ninotchka\"\n\nHenry Fonda for \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" and John Ford for Director\n\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce for \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\"\n\n\"Gunga Din\"\n\nMichael Curtiz for direction for \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth of Essex\"\n\nJean Arthur for her performance in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"\n\n\"Only Angels Have Wings\"\n\nTyrone Power for \"The Rains Came\"\n\nBillie Burke, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger and Margaret Hamilton for their performances in \"The Wizard of Oz\"\n\nMy Honorable Mentions Goes To:\n\nLon Chaney Jr for his outstanding performance in \"Of Mice and Men\", \"The Women\" with it's amazing cast and of course, the entire cast of \"The Wizard of Oz.\n\nLon Chaney Jr for his performance as Lennie\n\nThe cast of \"The Women\". One of the Best Comedies of the decade!\n\nThe supporting cast of \"The Wizard of Oz\"\n\nOscar Trivia:\n\nThe 12th Annual Academy Awards were held at the Ambassador Hotel (Coconut Grove) in Los Angeles and hosted by Bob Hope for the first of nineteen times.\n\nWith Frank Capra as the Academy President the television rights were sold to Warner Bros. for $30,000. The first year that they were televised for our viewing pleasure. (The stars were all too conscious of this fact, arriving in their finest tuxes, jewels and furs.)\n\nJudy Garland would win a Juvenile Oscar for her performance in \"The Wizard of Oz\"Over the Rainbow would also win Best Song. Judy would be presented her award by her frequent co-star, Mickey Rooney. After accepting her award she would give a beautiful performance of her award winning number from the film.\n\nHattie McDaniel became the first African-American to win an Academy Award. It would be another 24 years before Sidney Poitier would take home the Oscar for his performance in \"Lilies of the Field\"\n\nThis was the first year that an award for Visual Effects was given. Going to \"The Rains Came\". This would also be the year that Best Cinematography would be split up into two categories, black and white and color.\n\nThe first year that British performers would sweep the Best Actor/Actress categories.\n\nWalt Disney would win his eighth consecutive Oscar this year for his Cartoon Short, The Ugly Duckling\n\nHonorary Oscars would go to Douglas Fairbanks, William Cameron Menzies and to the Technicolor Company.\n\nThe Irving Thalberg G. Memorial Award would go to David O. Selznick.\n\n\"Gone With the Wind\" was nominated for a record 13 Awards that year with \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" a close second with 11 nominations. \"Wuthering Heights\" would come in with a well deserved, 8 nods.\n\nRobert Donat was not present to accept his Best Actor Oscar which was accepted in his honor by Spencer Tracey. Also not present, Greer Garson and Irene Dunne who were also nominated but most likely certain that the Best Actress statuette would go to Vivien Leigh. None of the winners were a surprise that year with the Los Angeles Times printing the winners before the ceremony began. (Jerks!) They would also print how close the votes were which caused a lot of arguing, frustration post Awards, prompting the Academy to tighten security on the vote tallies, winners going forward. (James Stewart lost out to Donat by a very small margin with Bette losing to Viv by just a few votes as well.)\n\nClark Gable was the most visibly disappointed with his loss this year, as he felt it was his best, last chance at the golden statuette.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this look back at the Oscars: 1939 and please leave a comment on anyone I might have missed that you feel deserved a nod or even who you feel should have won, not won.\n\nThis is going to be another great year for the Oscars, with so many stellar films, performances this past year. I'm really looking forward to seeing who won, if my predictions are correct.\n\n*If you missed any of my previous Oscar posts from the 1938 ceremony back to the beginning, they can be found in the archives on the sidebar.\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n\"The Girl\" 2012: Hitch is Back in the Spotlight\n\nWith the release of \"Hitchcock\" on the big screen recently and the HBO/BBC film, \"The Girl\" that also came out just a few months ago, then with \"Vertigo\" bumping \"Citizen Kane\" off of the AFI top spot after so many years of reigning supreme, It really does feel like 2012 was the year of Hitchcock and I couldn't be happier.\n\nI got to see \"Hitchcock\" over the weekend and it was everything that I expected and more with Hopkins acting his overly stuffed, big boy pants off along with the rest of the cast. It really was great fun to take a peek behind the scenes during the making of \"Psycho\". With that said, I won't be reviewing it because, like every great film, it's been analyzed, reviewed to death! What I do want to discuss today is the HBO film, \"The Girl\".\n\nI watched \"The Girl\" after seeing \"Hitchcock\" and I'm really not sure if that was a good or bad thing but what's done is done.\n\nThe wonderful stage and screen actor, Toby Jones plays Hitch in the film. Although I'm a huge fan of Jones, I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I saw that he would be playing Hitch. He's short with a slight build and while he's British his voice is effeminate. Of course my fears were quickly set aside when I remembered how great he was as Truman Capote in \"Infamous\" 2006 then as Karl Rove in \"W\" 2008. The stunning Sienna Miller takes on the role of Tippi Hedren. I've been a fan of Miller since seeing her play the tragic, socialite/model, Edie Sedgwick, muse to Andy Warhol in \"Factory Girl\" 2006.\n\nOh, if you thought I was done talking about \"Hitchcock\" I'm not, as there will be a few comparisons in this review.\n\nCAST:\n\nToby Jones as Alfred Hitchcock\n\nSienna Miller as Tippi Hedren\n\nImelda Staunton as Alma Reville Hitchcock (Imelda really does make a more believable Alma in appearance than Helen Mirren did.)\n\nConrad Kemp as Evan Hunter\n\nPenelope Wilton as Peggie Robertson\n\nAngelina Ingpen as Melanie\n\nDirector: Julian Jurrold\n\n*This is not one of my snarky photo reviews in case you're expecting that.\n\nIf you're not familiar with this HBO film, it looks at the relationship between Tippi and Hitch from the time she was cast for \"The Birds\" and ends with final takes of \"Marnie\". The resource material for this film clearly came from Tippi and others who wrote bios on Hichcock throughout the years so if you're one of many who feel Tippi's side of things doesn't wash, is fictitious or it's just her being vindictive or if you're not willing to watch anything that might taint your opinion that Hitch was perfect, a genius who treated his starlets like queens, then you won't care for this film.\n\nIf you're still here, well I hope you are, let's take a look at \"The Girl\" . (I'll try not to give too much away for those who haven't seen the film but we all know how the relationship between Tippi and Hitch turned out, how the films turned out. Okay, to be fair, not everyone has seen \"Marnie\" which is fine even though it is my favorite Hitchcock film. \"There, there now.\")\n\nAs the film opens we see birds in a cage being manipulated with strings. ( I think we can all agree that Hitch loved delicate things that he could manipulate and who's to say if in his mind they were caged. He certainly did use his talents to work magic.)\n\nWe get a glimpse of Hitchcock who's on the other end of the strings. They've certainly done a fine job in transforming Jones into the 'Master of Suspense'. He's not as padded up as Hopkins in \"Hitchcock\". It seems they've opted to put him in baggy clothes but the facial prosthetics are quite good as they were for Hopkins but let's move along.\n\nWe get our first glimpse of Tippi who's waiting outside of Hitch's office. While she waits her turn to meet the director who's casting for the lead in \"The Birds\" she admires his framed photographs of Novak, Kelly and Leigh. She certainly has big shoes to fill but no pressure.\n\nThe outspoken Hitch is critical of her wardrobe choices and her lack of acting experience but he perks up briefly upon finding out that she's a divorcée. No pesky husband roaming around the set!\n\nWe're quickly reminded that Tippi was a single mom during this time, with Melanie Griffith around 5 yrs old when her mother started filming \"The Birds\".\n\nWe get a few scenes of Hitch behind the camera, giving Tippi tips on how to walk, stand, emote, immerse herself into the character, Melanie Daniels.\n\nWe get our first glimpse of Alma Hitchcock as they watch Tippi's screen test. If only we could read her mind. I can imagine she's thinking \"Here we go again!...This man, this genius and ANOTHER blond obsession!\"\n\nAt a formal lunch with Hitch and Alma to announce she got the part of a lifetime, Tippi has already been transformed into a movie star. This should turn out splendidly.\n\nA quick look at birds being fed then filmed at the city dump as we prepare to make a picture.\n\nAs they did over the making of \"Psycho\", the studio is already riding Hitch. This time for giving Tippi a 7 year contract before the first scene of \"The Birds\" has even been shot. Hitch reminds the boss that Tippi is single so she won't be getting pregnant. An odd reason for signing an actress. (This topic was also brought up in \"Hitchcock\" when referring to Leigh and Vera Miles. I think it's safe to say that when you commit to Hitch, you commit to doing or not doing a lot of things. )\n\nHitch oversees everything from the color of Tippi's lipstick to the perfect shade of blond on her gorgeous head.\n\nHe's also made sure she has a dressing room fit for a star.\n\nWhile \"Hitchcock\" shows Alma as a very opinionated, a strong woman who voices her distaste for Hitch's obvious obsession with his leading ladies, this Alma is quite passive and timid. Make no mistake though that she's fully aware and often uncomfortable with his familiarity and tasteless jokes when it comes to these women.\n\nThe first day of filming is a cold and miserable day with torrential rain but Tippi doesn't seem to mind as she amuses herself with one of the 'stunt' birds on set. She then walks off with one of the set designers.\n\nThis doesn't escape the hawkish eyes of Hitch who's waiting out the weather in his car.\n\nWatch the innocent flirting, Tippi or you'll find yourself alone with a rogue bird!\n\nFor now, a vulgar limerick will do.\n\nThe scenery and the classic cars are quite spectacular.\n\nIf what takes place inside the car is remotely true, it's not spectacular but shocking. I won't give too much away here. Settle down, Hitch!\n\nWe're ready to film the phone booth scene and all we need is Tippi. Let's hope she wasn't too shaken by yesterdays events. (This is one of a couple of scenes where I'm distracted by Toby Jones's small stature as Hitch had a presence, wasn't dwarfed by his surroundings. Toby Jones is 5'5 where as Hitchcock was 5'7 and well over 200 lbs.)\n\nAs she awaits the ACTION cue from Hitch, she appears apprehensive but who can blame her.\n\nThis would traumatize me, injured by it or not. Mistake or not! Of course Hitch walks off without comment after the take, seemingly pleased with what just happened. (I'm terrified of birds. I always have been. Of course I'm not too fond of broken glass flying at me either.)\n\nHitch sends his secretary, Peggy to smooth things over. (Yes, that's actress, Penelope Wilton who you might recognize if you're a Downton Abbey fan. She was also fabulous in \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" better known as my moms latest favorite film.)\n\nWe get a close up to remind us of why Tippi isn't so willing to press on or forgive Hitch.\n\nThe two meet over champagne to smooth things over and discuss why it's so important for her character to face a lot of birds alone in a dark attic. Awww, she's such a push over for the sake of his vision.\n\nThere are no apologies but as a piece offering he leaves the \"Marnie\" script for her to read. (If she's not seeing red now, she soon will be! Zinnngg!) Of course we all know and it's made apparent in the film that Tippi was given the part only because Grace Kelly turned it down. A bit of trivia: January Jones was originally cast as Tippi but turned it down due to her pregnancy.\n\nWe see an injured and terrified Tippi go through take after take of the attic scene. The crew's visibly upset and concerned for her well being, wanting to stop. (This was hard to watch!)\n\nWithin a few weeks, things are better on the surface as they make their way to the premiere. It's amazing they both got through making the film in one piece.\n\nWe're back on the set to start filming \"Marnie\" and Hitch is up to his old tricks.\n\nPeggy has intervened on Tippi's behalf to try and persuade Hitch to stop forcing the situation, keep their relationship professional.\n\nIt's time for the \"Marnie\" wedding night 'lovemaking' scene and I think we can all speculate on who Tippi was thinking of with that glassy, blank stare. (She really does remind me of Tippi during that scene.)\n\nWe watch Hitch make a creepy phone call to Tippi on Christmas Eve while Alma looks on in disgust.\n\nMore really uncomfortable conversation before we get to the point that Tippi's being held down by Hitch's control over her career.\n\nEven Alma has had enough. I'm glad she's found her voice. It couldn't have been easy for her having to live with Hitch's play things for years.\n\nThe film closes with the final scene of \"Marnie\" and Tippi showing relief that her working relationship with Hitch is over.\n\nThis film clearly depicts Alfred Hitchcock as a controlling, abusive, sadistic, creep. He obviously isn't around to defend this depiction and there are a lot of critics who feel that Tippi and others who might have been privy to this behavior distorted or even made all of it up. It's not my place to judge whether it's fact or fiction since I wasn't there and most who dispute it weren't there either. If even a third of it was true then it's a sad situation for all concerned.\n\nHaving said this, I think that we all want to believe that our idols are perfect, without flaws or sin. We put them on a pedestal and we're ready to defend them when anything is said to tarnish that pristine image. I know that when it comes to Charlie Chaplin, I'm one of his biggest apologists there is. He was brilliant and I adore him but at the same time I know that he had a lot of flaws off set and some of his personal decisions regarding young women were shameful.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, we don't know how Hitch or anyone else is off camera in their personal lives. Surely we can't all believe that with Hitch's subject matter, what he chose to fight to depict on-screen, even subtly that he left everything behind when he walked off set at night. He was a genius when it came to film making but I can distinguish between that and what he may have been like as a person.\n\nPlease feel free to leave your comments but keep in mind that I did not write the script for \"The Girl\". : ) Also, if you've seen the film please share your opinions on it and if you haven't, I do hope you'll give it a chance. The acting was great, the scenery, costumes, automobiles. We also get a glimpse of a lot of the techniques, the secrets that Hitch used to make his films stand out above other director's work. That's enough to waste an hour or so on a film then if you want to rip it to shreds, that's alright too.\n\nSee ya soon!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nWhen Fur Was Fabulous: Part 3\n\nIt's time to have another look at our favorite classic stars, strutting their stuff in fur.\n\nMary Pickford, setting sail on one of her European Cruises.\n\nLana Turner glows in all white.\n\nEleanor Powell looks like she's ready to take on Everest from the knees up!\n\nAnn Sothern opts for fur trim over her gorgeous, beaded gown.\n\nI don't have any words for Lucille Ball and this distracting get up. It's hideous from head to glove!\n\nNancy Kelly shows off her massive fur and matching hat.\n\nBrenda Marshall opts for a stylish vest. (Less is more, Lana!)\n\nSylvia Sidney stuns in her fur stole.\n\nCarole Lombard, pretty in mink.\n\nMabel Normand stops to pose with her furry friend. (Not sure what kind of varmint that is.)\n\nBette Davis means business with that collar.\n\nLoretta Young is flawless!\n\nCorinne Griffith is a beauty in her chinchilla coat.\n\nAva Gardner opts for some strange fur sleeves. (I wouldn't want her skinny elbows to get cold!)\n\nYou can't have a fur post without the fabulous, Marylin Monroe. She looks radiant here and happy.\n\nWell, that's enough fur for today. The sun is beating down on my back right now. Please leave a comment on your favorite or what you think of these fashionable ensembles.\n\nI hope everyone is having a great weekend.\n\nSee ya soon!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nMilliners Invade Hollywood: Part Seven\n\nI do apologize for my absence. I've just recently returned from a week long vacation. I've missed our stars in fabulous hats and Shirley Temple, my always opinionated co-host so if you're ready let's dive right in to some fashion.\n\nShirley, what do you think of Ann Miller and her fancy hat? Shirley: \"She doesn't look like she's getting ready to break out into song or throw those annoying legs of hers everywhere so I'm happy with it!\"\n\nBetty Grable's ensemble is perfect from head to toe! Shirley: \"She chose a crazy hat to distract from her dorm room mattress cover coat.\" Those of us in the know aren't fooled by this magic act!\"\n\nCarole Lombard has an interesting hat and I do love her gloves. Shirley: \"When you hang out in stables on your off days you get these delusions of grandeur that you're headed to the Kentucky Derby where strange is fashionable. It looks like she had a close call with a lawnmower blade.\"\n\nThis is an interesting look for Deanna Durbin. Shirley: \"It figures that Deanna made a bold fashion choice, dared to be a bit interesting during a radio show where nobody and I mean nobody saw her cutesy face!.. She looks terrified here and I'm guessing the show host told her that she looks ridiculous!\"\n\nDorothy Sebastian was such a beauty. Shirley: \"Every beautiful woman has flaws. Dorothy's flaw was she collected human hair from her co-stars dressing rooms then walked around with it as a hat... Just look at that nut!\" Hmmm, now that you mention it.\n\nEvelyn Brent looks sassy in her hat. I like this look. Shirley: \"She looks like Theda Bara's prettier sister. That's a complement! Have you seen Theda Bara? She's scary and I think she had Alopecia too!\" If that were the case we would have seen her in more hats and less crowns.\n\nGail Patrick in another stunning hat. Shirley: \"Was Gail ever in a picture because I don't remember her at all? Just millions of fashion photos in strange hats. She must have gotten paid per hat.\" It sounds like a great gig if you can get it! Maybe she had Alopecia too.\n\nOh, look at Gloria Swanson. She made the most interesting fashion choices. Shirley: \"She's sweating through her netting and don't get me started on the odd arm placement... She's clearly trying too hard!.. She's armless in houndstooth!.. Always a fashion fail!\"\n\nHedda Hopper seems very happy here in her stylish hat and fur. Shirley: \"She isn't making me happy! Get her out of here and over to the \"When Fur Was Fabulous\" post. That woman made everyone miserable, nice hat or not. I hope that fur gave her psoriasis!\" Hush now or I'll sick Louella Parsons on you!\n\nHelen Hayes should be smiling with this gorgeous hat and coat. I would wear both. Shirley: \"She's sad because Ramon Novarro put out a restraining order on her. He just couldn't take the constant stalking anymore.\" That's such a sad situation. They were lovely together in \"Son-Daughter\". My favorite silent film. Shirley: \"He's not that fond of women of any kind but don't tell Helen.\"\n\nJune Duprez is a beauty in shearling. Shirley: \"She's channeling Alexis Smith because that worked out so well for Alexis Smith!\" Don't be mean to Alexis, Shirley.\n\nLilli Damita was so cute and I love this flapper look. Shirley: \"It's just too darn bad she had to compete with Errol's sailboat of fun. Darn that unlimited supply of boat fuel and attorney's on retainer.\" From what I understand all of the pearls in the world can't substitute for a moonlit night seen through a sailboats portal. Shirley: \"You are going to have that Becky girl after us!\" It wouldn't be the first time.\n\nWell, I think we've covered enough gorgeous hats and gossip for one night, Shirley.\n\nPlease leave a comment on these wonderful hats or anything else that comes to mind. Just remember this isn't really Shirley so all of your hate mail to Shirley will just pile up again.\n\nSee ya later!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nThe Academy Awards: 1940\n\nWith the Oscars quickly approaching it's time to take another look back at the previous winners, losers, snubs and trivia for the 13th Annual Academy Awards.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nRebecca (Winner), Foreign Correspondent, The Grapes of Wrath, The Great Dictator, All This, and Heaven Too, Kitty Foyle, The Letter, Our Town, The Philadelphia Story, The Long Voyage Home\n\nJoan Fontaine and C. Aubrey Smith on the set of \"Rebecca\"\n\nBest Actor:\n\nJames Stewart (Winner) in \"The Philadelphia Story\", Charles Chaplin in \"The Great Dictator\", Henry Fonda in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Laurence Olivier in \"Rebecca\", Raymond Massey in \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\"\n\nBest Actress:\n\nGinger Rogers (Winner) in \"Kitty Foyle\", Joan Fontaine in \"Rebecca\", Bette Davis in \"The Letter\", Katharine Hepburn in \"The Philadelphia Story\", Martha Scott in \"Our Town\"\n\nJimmy Stewart and Ginger Rogers pose with their Oscars.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nWalter Brennan (Winner) in \"The Westerner\", William Gargan in \"They Knew What They Wanted\", Albert Basserman in \"Foreign Correspondent\", Jack Oakie in \"The Great Dictator\", James Stephenson in \"The Letter\"\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nJane Barwell (Winner) in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Ruth Hussey in \"The Philadelphia Story\", Judith Anderson in \"Rebecca\", Barbara O'Neil in \"All This, and Heaven Too\", Marjorie Rambeau in \"Primrose Path\"\n\nBest Director:\n\nJohn Ford (Winner) for \"The Grapes of Wrath\", George Cukor for \"The Philadelphia Story\", Alfred Hitchcock for \"Rebecca\", William Wyler for \"The Letter\", Sam Wood for \"Kitty Foyle\"\n\nOscar Snubs and Omissions:\n\nCary Grant for \"The Philadelphia Story\" and \"His Girl Friday\"\n\nRosalind Russell for \"His Girl Friday\"\n\nWilliam Holden and Fay Bainter for \"Our Town\"\n\nFrank Morgan and Margaret Sullavan for \"The Shop Around the Corner\"\n\nGeorge Sanders for \"Rebeccca\"\n\nHoward Hawks for \"His Girl Friday\"\n\n(Perhaps I'm forgetting a few so please leave a comment with your own snubs.)\n\nMy Honorable Mentions Go To:\n\nW.C. Fields in \"The Bank Dick\"\n\nThe film and cast of \"Pride and Prejudice\" as well as the director, Robert Leonard\n\nOscar Trivia:\n\nThe ceremony for the 13th Annual Academy Awards was held in the Biltmore Bowl at the Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles, CA. The event was hosted by Walter Wanger.\n\nAfter the previous years debacle with the winners announced the night before by the LA Times, the tradition to present a sealed envelope with the winners was started. Going forward, Price Waterhouse would count and secure the ballots until the actual ceremony. This would also cause the nominees to actually start showing up to the event instead of sitting it out, knowing ahead of time that they were losers.\n\nBob Hope was presented an Honorary Oscar this year and the Irving G. Thalberg Award was not given out to anyone.\n\nPresident, Franklin Roosevelt gave a five minute radio address during the ceremony. The first time a president would speak during the Oscars.\n\n\"Rebecca\" came away with the most nominations with a well deserved 11 with \"The Grapes of Wrath\" close behind with 7 nods then \"The Foreign Correspondent\", \"The Philadelphia Story\", The Long Voyage Home\" and \"Our Town\" tied with 6 nominations each. \"The Great Dictator\" would receive 5. (Go, Charlie!)\n\nWith Walter Brennan's win for \"The Westerner\" he was the first actor to win three Academy Awards. This record would hold for 28 years until Kate Hepburn won her 3rd Oscar for \"The Lion in Winter\" in 1968.\n\nWalt Disney (no stranger to Oscar) would take home another two Oscars for \"Pinocchio\". Best Original Score and Best Song for When You Wish Upon A Star.\n\nTwo new categories were introduced this year. Writing and Original Screenplay.\n\n\"Rebecca\" was Alfred Hitchcock's first American made film and his first win. Perhaps, producer, David O. Selznick had a lot to do with that. Coming off of his previous win for \"Gone With the Wind\", Selznick, working as an independent producer, promoted the heck out of \"Rebecca\". With his pull, reputation in Hollywood, \"Rebecca\" was a shoe-in. (Yes, I think the film was deserving. It is my favorite film of all time after all and Joan Fontaine is my favorite classic actress.) With the most nominations, 11, it's surprising that it would only take home one win, for Best Picture. Judith Anderson was the expected winner for her outstanding performance but Barwell would win out. (The Academy when given the opportunity will go with heartwarming over evil every time!)\n\nGinger Rogers was the dark horse that year, always missing out for her comedic performances, grueling dance numbers never considered Oscar worthy so perhaps her win for \"Kitty Foyle\" was a bit of a consolation prize for all of the years she was overlooked. (I'm not saying that Ginger didn't give a great performance in the film though. Just my thoughts and we've seen this a lot throughout the history of the Oscars. Actors/Actresses winning the golden statuette a couple of years after they were snubbed.) Perhaps a great example, even this year is Jimmy Stewart's win over Henry Fonda. It's easy to assume his win was to make up for his loss the previous year for the more deserving performance in \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"\n\nCharlie Chaplin would be the first to receive nominations in the same year for Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. (Acting, directing and writing) Of course this achievement wouldn't last long with \"Citizen Kane\" on the horizon but congrats to Charlie!) The Oscar for Original Screenplay would go to Preston Sturges for \"The Great McGinty\" this year.\n\nWell, that's a wrap for the Academy Awards for 1940. I do hope you'll leave a comment on the winners and losers, snubs. Let us know if you agree with the winners and nominees.\n\nSee ya soon and thanks for stopping by!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMore Fabulous Stars in Fur!\n\nWe have some wicked fog today and a bit of rain. I think that's just about as 'wintery' as it is going to get here. I must continue with my winter series on our delightful stars decked out in fur though. Just imagine a snow plow in the distance and our adorable stars freezing as they show off the latest fashions.\n\nIsa Miranda looks miffed in muff!\n\nBebe Daniels and Gloria Swanson step out in the style. (Gloria appears to be whispering..\"You know these cameras are here for me, right?\")\n\nOh, Billie Burke! I think a munchkin might just be missing his hat but I do appreciate your sense of humor here.\n\nBoots Mallory pulls off a large fur collar. (I would love to see this outfit from head to toe... She's divine!)\n\nClara Bow channels one of her chows. I just don't care for her hair swept back like this. It screams \"Look at these eyebrows...They're straight and clever even if I'm nuts!\"\n\nDorothy Dix carries off 100lbs of fur perfectly! What I would give for those eyes.\n\nWhat a fur! I don't even mind that Esther Ralston looks like a crazy haired killa.\n\nFrances Gifford needs a parade float and some fur therapy!\n\nFred Astaire has stopped by to show us that men can carry off a touch of fur too. (So glad he left his muff at home!)\n\nGene Tierney is an eye turner in her chocolate mink as she steps out on the town. Take it easy Gene! That gal, Lana Turner has your number.\n\nOh, look! Greta Garbo discovered curling irons. How unfortunate. (And perhaps it's just me but it looks like the photogs caught Ms. Garbo mid seizure,)\n\nWhen you have a figure like Jean Harlow you can pull off polka dots on the derriere and a fur wrap. Show off! (Cruelty to dry wall and plaster!)\n\nIrene Dunne emulates Garbo in her 'curling irons gone rogue' photo shoot.\n\nJoan Blondell. Busty McBusterson takes on fur, a lawn and an odd hat! (Wait until I show this to Shirley!)\n\nWell, that's enough fur for one day. Going to go hug my great aunts fur stole and thank the powers that be that I'll never be desperate or brave enough to wear it other than playing dress up for classic movie night.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on these beautiful stars and their fashion choices.\n\nSee ya soon!\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nHappy Valentines Day!\n\nHappy Valentines Day from My Love of Old Hollywood.\n\nMarilyn Monroe takes aim.\n\nMary Carlisle channels her inner child.\n\nToby Wing makes the perfect Valentines Day pin-up.\n\nWynne Gibson looks extra sweet in ruffles.\n\nCyd Charisse makes the perfect Valentines Day card.\n\nDeanna Durbin gives us that smile that melted a million hearts.\n\nFlorence George looks like the Princess of a Valentines Day parade.\n\nAnn Miller is never one to be outdone when it comes to any holiday pin-up.\n\nWishing everyone a wonderful day, filled with love, laughter, a bit of romance and all your heart desires.\n\nSee you soon for the Fabulous 40s Blogathon. (For more information on the event hosted by the Classic Movie Blog Association, just click the banner on the sidebar.)\n\nPage\n\n↧\n\nFabulous Films of the 1940s, CMBA Blogathon entry: The Philadelphia Story\n\nThis is my entry for the CMBA Blogathon: Fabulous Films of the 1940s. For the rest of the entries just click on the link HERE\n\nWhen deciding on a film for the Blogathon I knew immediately that I wanted to do another snarky photo review but choosing a film took a minute or two. The Philadelphia Story is my favorite comedy behind Bringing Up Baby which I had snarked on awhile back for another Blogathon. Is it okay to try to provide humor for another already very funny film? What to do? Well here I am again, paying homage to another wonderful comedy in my own way. I do hope you'll enjoy my take on it and you weren't expecting another serious review of this film. As a fan of classic cinema, we've all seen it and we've read plenty scholarly write ups on it.\n\nIf you're ready and you have your humor caps on. lets get started!\n\nThe Philadelphia Story, 1940. The critical darling was nominated for six Oscars and it took home two. Best Actor for Jimmy Stewart and Best Writing/Screenplay for Donald Ogden Stewart. Kate and Ruth Hussey were also nominated. Sadly, Cary Grant was snubbed. Of course, Joseph Mankiewicz for Best Picture then George Cukor received a nod for Best Director.\n\nCAST\n\nCary Grant as C.K. Dexter Haven\n\nJames Stewart as Macaulay Connor\n\nKatharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord\n\nRuth Hussey as Elizabeth Imbrie\n\nJohn Howard as George Kittredge\n\nRoland Young as Uncle Willie\n\nJohn Halliday as Seth Lord\n\nMary Nash as Margaret Lord\n\nVirginia Weidler as Dinah Lord\n\nDirector: George Cukor for MGM Studios\n\nCostumes by Adrian\n\nWe open to C.K. Dexter and his wife, Tracy, who's either having a very high end garage sell or he's in big trouble.\n\nIf my husband had a look like that on his face I would run and hide but this is a 1940s comedy so he'll probably pratfall into a vat of oysters.\n\nShe's strong for someone who weighs about 60 lbs.\n\nYou just don't mess with a man's golf clubs, especially on the front porch. Pretty sure this is an illegal activity.\n\nShe's such a mean looking woman but she's managed to land another man. Keep your homeowners insurance up buddy and good luck.\n\nWe meet Tracy's little sister, Dinah. She's a real piece of work. Just picture a miniature version of Judith Anderson in Rebecca. Except this one's armed with a yo-yo instead of matches.\n\nShe's making fun of diamonds. Dinah Short is a little snob. I bet she hates party balloons, puppies, caviar and sunny days.\n\nWhen Kate smiles through clinched teeth we know she's hating on someone. It's the ex for now. I know he tried to knock her block off but it's Cary Grant and they were nice golf clubs.\n\nThe Demon Seed is praying something bad happens. She's also on Team Cary Grant. This new fiancée, George must be a real ogre.\n\nOh, I think she's going to chloroform Dinah.\n\nHere's the fiancée, George. Tracy tells him he looks awful. She's such a peach in tweed. I can see why she attracts so many men.\n\nJust when I think she can't get any more likable she throws George to the ground and throws dirt all over him. Mating rituals certainly are different for the upper class.\n\nHe's ambitious and she's turned off! I can tell by her giant, clinched teeth. The horse looks very uncomfortable to be put in this situation.\n\nGeorge: \"Is there any way to maneuver this thing close enough to my fiancée so I can accidentally kick her in the teeth?\"\n\nWe head over to Dime and Spy magazine with Mike and his lovely sidekick, Elizabeth. (Here's a tip..If your hat is so high that we can't see Cary Grant behind you then go for something a little less origami boaty.)\n\nThe head of the magazine has talked this ambitious duo into covering the wedding of the year. Of course the ex has ulterior motives. I hope it's to kidnap Danvers Jr. then rescue George.\n\nMeddlesome Mike and Lois Lumineers can't wait to start going through the Lord's fancy possessions. They're on Team Resent the Upper Class.\n\nWhile Mike amuses himself with fancy phones, Lois Lumineers struts around taking photos. She seems to be enjoying this. We know this because her feather seems to be getting taller.\n\nNow that Mike has figured out fancy phones it's time to test it out with a prank phone call. These people are connected so I'm sure there's a direct line button there, straight to the President.\n\nInstead he gets the Mad Hatter and her souless snit. The prank call gets blamed on the hired help who must be drunk before noon. By the looks of that room, this must happen a lot.\n\nDinah Short's thrilled! I think she's hoping Tracy gets beat up again. This kid should have been sent off to boarding school.\n\nIt's hard to pull one over on Kate when she's wearing a tailored pant suit but we give it a go.\n\nShe's sniffed out that the unwelcome wedding guests are actually reporters, there to get to the bottom of her father's escapades with a young ballerina. (Please don't hand Kate scissors, there's a time and a place to get rid of her split ends. She's got Joan Crawford problems!)\n\nApparently the family is being blackmailed. I really do hope the guilty parties show up. This weekend needs a rich man and his ballerina side piece. Plus the ballerina and Dinah Short can have a dance off.\n\nKate has the same expression that she always does but she's going to be sick all over her pantsuit. This film just has one tragedy after another.\n\nThe crazy mother has no idea what's going on. I doubt she even knows she has a husband or that she's raising the weirdest girls on the planet. Danvers Jr. is tickled that she gets to play a prank on common folk. Stick around to see if it involves a yo-yo.\n\nMike appears to be doing inventory of the silver in the study. This is going to be some article.\n\nThey're startled by something across the room.\n\nOh, Gawd! It's Dinah Short who's doing some weird Gertrude Stein meets Anna Pavlova.\n\nThis is why rich kids should stay in boarding schools. Left unattended, they scare people.\n\nMike: \"What do you think is wrong with her?\"\n\nElizabeth: \"Give me a minute, at least until she stops spinning!\"\n\nMike: \"I'm going to be ill!\"\n\nThis right here is why the servants stay sauced! Oh, Lydia!\n\nQueue Tracy for her part of the show. She's really let her hair down for this charade. Gone is the pant suit and Hellllooo, gingham ruffled up!\n\nMost women avoid 30 lbs of ruffles and print because it isn't flattering to the figure. For some odd reason, it's the opposite with the wealthy. If Ma Kettle were to wear that...Well, you get the idea. Mike has the right idea. Just don't look at it!\n\nOur souless snit lays it on thick with a weird Bela Lugosi accent from White Zombie. (It's amazing how Kate can unhinge her jaw to show happiness)\n\nMike: \"What in the world did she have on?\"\n\nElizabeth: \"Gingham, ruffled up!...I saw it in a fashion magazine once. Very expensive!\"\n\nMike: \"I don't think caviar and disdain have enough calories and why do rich people sound like Count Dracula or that egomaniac, Gertrude Stein?\"\n\nElizabeth: \"What about that strange kid and the way she sidles up? It's just creepy!\"\n\nMother has no idea who these two are. If we could get these two name tags, it would shave off about 20 minutes of the movie.\n\nYou've got to keep your eyes on that spindly fella. He has this strange obsession with the silver.\n\nUncle Willie, who wanders around clueless is chosen to fill in for Father Lord. (Have you seen the price of that giant flower pot at Lowes? These people really are rich!)\n\nThe only one who knows whats going on is Danvers Jr. so it's safe to say that someone is going to end up dead, almost dead or missing.\n\nDinah's back and she's playing charades. Just spill it Dinah, even if you have to sing it!\n\nThe real Father Lord shows up without the ballerina. Guessing she was sent off to fat camp after one too many trips to the olive bar.\n\nMike heads over to the local library to do some research on the Lords. Just direct him to the Stranger than Fiction, section.\n\nHe runs into Wee Willie Winkie, who's there reading his book until it's time to run through the town.\n\nMike: \"Where do you find your outfits?\"\n\nTracy: \"I've unhinged my jaw to smile, don't ruin this moment.\"\n\nApparently Lois Lumineers has stopped by the same spa from \"The Woman\" because she jumps to the conclusion that these two are sneaking off to have a fling. (Just pray, Joan Crawford isn't in town for a Tanqueray convention!)\n\nJust because you don't look directly at the striped vest, doesn't make it disappear.\n\nThis is the saddest pool party I've ever seen. Even the hedges look miserable.\n\nApparently W.C. Fields has been sneaking onto the property for late night swims.\n\nThis is Kate, pulling off sexy and seductive. You're welcome! (I can assume that padded swimsuits weren't available in 1940?)\n\nOh, we're back to long and flowy. Make up your mind, Kate.\n\nThe ex shows up to make sure there's nothing strange going on. He has spent time with these people, right?\n\nC.K.: \"Are you gaining weight? I can't see the celery stick you ate yesterday.\"\n\nHere's George. It appears he's been hiding dinosaur clavicles by the looks of his nose. Oops! Wrong movie.\n\nThe cameraman is quite clever! It appears that Kate has turned into Louise Brooks from afar.\n\nC.K. has left Tracy a wedding gift. A replica of their yacht, the True Love. (Are we to believe this one? Was the vessel name, Miserably Rich, already taken?)\n\nIt's so very yar! Can muscle tone and water adding 10 lbs be yar?\n\nUncle Willie is getting his flirt on. (I love Roland Young..he needs a bigger role and more alcohol. Let's hope he finds the gardeners stash or Dinah Short to drive him crazy.)\n\nEveryone has left Tracy to get ready for the dinner party over at Uncle Willies. She's not a drinker but tonight we've got some lives to ruin and hopefully more amazingly odd fashion to model.\n\nYes, even Uncle Willies mansion is strange. It appears that the property stops and is replaced by a cardboard landscape within a few feet.\n\nTracy is lit up like a Christmas Cracker. Any normal man would leave town but George, he's an odd one. At least if they had written in that he digs up stuff he'd have something to do.\n\nApparently the upper class sit around and suck lemons when not dancing or gossiping.\n\nMike, who's clearly pickled feels the need to scream and commandeer vehicles. Luckily there are no neighbors, just more cardboard scenery and some shrubs.\n\nBecause he was able to get Tracy to smile and do a couple of high dives, he believes she's human enough to be in love. The first hurdle is to find out if C.K. Dexter Haven still has feelings for her.\n\nAs amusing as this is, I'm distracted by the stuffed animal heads. C.K. has spent a lot of time in Africa but all he managed to poach was a malnourished raccoon and a fox?\n\nAnd who mounts a raccoons tail? Don't the rich usually have those things made into a hat?\n\nHandling another mans guns is a big party foul. (We need to get to the bottom of what's going on. Jimmy is losing weight by the second. At this rate, he'll need to be propped up by the end of this.)\n\nSomeone has gone and killed Tracy. Hopefully it was Danvers Jr. That kid needs some jail time.\n\nC.K.: \"Is she dead?\"\n\nElizabeth: \"You're not that lucky!..Have you seen, Philip Marlowe Lite?\"\n\nKate's hair has settled down and she's too drunk to speak. If he's going to fall back in love with her this would be the time.\n\nAvoiding a dangerous gun incident the next step is to get in the car with a drunken harpie. (It's a good thing the countryside is made up of cardboard and plastic plants so these rich idiots can't hurt themselves.)\n\nThese two kids have a death wish. It's on to operation get electrocuted at the cement pond.\n\nNot content to get through the night unharmed, it's time to run the wheels off of expensive wicker.\n\nIs it me or is Kate's hair getting fuller as the night progresses? She's turning into a pretty little, drunk idiot. This must be the Tracy that C.K. and George fell in love with then she sobered up. She's a modern day, Cinderella.\n\nThese two finally kiss. When they stand close together they come close to making one whole shadow. I hope they get married so they finally eat something. Even if it's wedding cake.\n\nWell, these two can't wander off too far. Another few feet and they're going to hit green screen. (These outdoor sets are like The Truman Show.)\n\nAfter the sane ones spend the night working on more blackmail material that will sink a couple of careers it's time for bed. Why can't anyone midnight swim or snoop around? The wrecking balls in the backyard need some company.\n\nEagle Eye makes his way to the Hall of Silver just in time.\n\nC.K. \"Did I just see you digging up old boots, George?\"\n\nGeorge: \"No, it couldn't be me. I'm just here to wander around looking pensive and confused.\" Have you seen, Dinah? My shoes laces were tied to a gazelle when I woke up!\"\n\nGod, really does watch out for fools and children because these two have managed to return unscathed.\n\nOne of these two is falling out of love while the other is falling back in love. It's all very confusing given that it's Kate and she's carousing with a commoner.\n\nMike: \"She's broken my back and two ribs!\"\n\nC.K. \"She only weighs 60 lbs before a swim!\"\n\nGeorge: \"Do any of you realize I'm here?\"\n\nC.K.Dexter Haven tries to knock another head off. I'm never a fan of violence but when it comes to these people. At least trip George for being such a boring dolt.\n\nThis will only hurt for another 15 minutes.\n\nDanvers Jr. has seen and heard everything. At least the trystettes are soused so they won't feel a thing when they're strangled with a yo-yo.\n\nIt's the wedding day and everyone is hungover except the hired help, which is odd.\n\nI know the first thing I do when I can't wait to gossip is bridle the closest Shetland to a crate then pray someone with a hangover happens by.\n\nTracy can't remember anything from the night before. If Lois Lumineers fell down on the job and didn't get enough pictures for a front page spread, I'll be disappointed. Sadly, she lost her camera somewhere between getting assaulted by Uncle Willie and the stuffed raccoons.\n\nDanvers Jr. can't wait to let it be known that she saw everything that went on last night from her bedroom window by the sea, the beautiful sea!\n\nMike is still in love this morning with the wrong girl. I think he just wants to get his hands on that very large collection of silver. There's something off with this kid.\n\nI can't decide if this hairstyle was molded to the hat or vice versa but what it needs is a few more long curls and a rhinestone belt. (She still doesn't recognize Mike even though he's been hanging around for what seems like a month.) They're all crackpots!\n\nC.K. Dexter Haven is quite amused at all of this. Who wouldn't be when you can go around punching people and still be invited to their fancy parties?\n\nEven the wedding cake looks hungover.\n\nPoor, George! He's still confused. He left a note letting Tracy know he was through then he shows up dressed for a wedding. He does know he was the groom, right?\n\nImpromptu dancing to celebrate other peoples misery!\n\nBecause everything takes place in the backyard, everyone has forgotten that at least 50 people have been seated for a wedding ceremony.\n\nGeorge wandered off again so Mike volunteers to be the groom. (That is the strangest wedding dress, or is it a negligee?) Poor, Lois Lumineers! I hate when Ruth Hussey gets the short end of everything.\n\nWhatever you decide to do is fine with us dear! Just make a decision quickly. Will Rogers wants his hat back by 4:00.\n\nOh, this has made Dinah Short very happy. I don't like this at all.\n\nTracy: \"Am I smiling? I feel like I'm smiling. Who's carrying me down the aisle? I haven't eaten in weeks.\"\n\nThis movie needs a sequel where they all meet up in 10 years for a hunting trip at Dinah Shorts ranch. Mother Lord arrives with Will Rogers and George shows up to win Tracy over with his winning personality.\n\nBoy, this review is late, late and I apologize for that! At least now I can get caught up with the other Blogathon entries and if you haven't done so, please click the link at the top of the post.\n\nThanks for indulging me with this madness! There's so much to love about this film and Jimmy Stewart certainly deserved his Best Actor Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of Macaulay Connor. Roland Young, who was such a talented actor, stood out for me, which is hard to do when you're on-screen with Cary and Kate.\n\nPage\n\n↧"
