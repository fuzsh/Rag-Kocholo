Since that time over two years ago, she has provided encouragement and criticism, guidance and support that have meant much to me and I thank her for all of it. I could not have pursued, much less completed, this thesis without her patient assistance, as well as that of my fellow writers and instructors in the Masters of Professional Writing Program at the University of Southern California. I wish to thank especially Ned Comstock of the Cinema- Television Library at USC for giving me unparalleled access to hundreds of precious magazines, as well as steering me toward reference materials and sympathetic folks, greatly aiding my quest. Thanks also to Barbara Hall and Lucia Schultz of the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for pulling records, files and loose magazines from storage, allowing me to examine and often photocopy the genuine articles when possible. I appreciate the assistance of Dace Taube in the Regional 11 History Collection at USC for pointing me toward obscure articles in the Los Angeles Examiner morgue, and the help of John Cahoon of the Seaver Center for Western History Research at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. Veronica Hale of the Pulse Copy Center deserves kudos for treating dozens of deteriorating magazines so delicately and with such good nature, as she endeavored to provide the finest color repro­ ductions possible of dozens of titles, which she always did. The Constance McCormick Collection at USC holds a wealth of invaluable material for study. For sharing her exhaustive collection of clippings, her encyclopedic knowledge of stars current and past, the remembrances of her mother and father, and most of all for her friendship, I wish to thank Connie McCormick Van Wyck.

Brewster, wife of Eugene Brewster, editor of Motion Picture Magazine, April 1919 Introduction Why fan magazines? Like so many before me, I was initially attracted to the Hollywood fan magazine by the covers. I was easily seduced by the vibrant colors and lush, oversized portraits, pri­ marily of actresses whose clear faces and bright eyes were hypnotizing. These women, especially from the 1920s and 1930s, were startlingly beautiful as they gazed out under­ neath the Photoplay title or, head turned and eyes half open, gave a sideways glance from Motion Picture Classic. Women with exotic and mysterious names like Nazimova, Pola Negri and Theda Bara beckoned, daring someone to pick up the magazine and leaf through the contents. So I did. First in second-hand bookstores, then thrift stores, I would find a pile of Modern Screen. Hollywood. Picture-Play or Movieland and look through them, surprised to discover there were whole lives inside. Each magazine con­ tained interviews with actors and actresses, behind-the-scene looks at studios and sets, a whole world of illusion and fantasy between the covers. As I spent more time studying the rich details of the photogravure portraits inside, examining the stills taken on old movie lots, even the posed \"natural\" shots of handsome men and beautiful women at work or in front of their large houses with expansive lawns, my curiosity was stirred. Who were these people so unabashedly putting their lives on display? When I skimmed the articles and read the gossip columns, I found myself getting hooked, pulled in by people, intimate yet unfamiliar. Strangely, I wanted to know who would be chosen for the lead in Ben Hur, Valentino or Novarro? How big was the studio bungalow that Norma Talmadge had built? What was it like to be at the opening of the Ambassador Hotel? It was then I understood the allure of the fan maga­ zines. They held magic in their pages. These periodicals brought the unobtainable within reach, literally putting it within one's grasp for ten or fifteen cents, a quarter. I was dumbfounded. Where had they gone? What happened to these powerful, beautiful publications? The more I thought about the fan magazines--and I could not shake them from my mind--the more I wanted to know. Who read them and why? Who published them and where? Who wrote for them and how? How many magazines were there and how did they differ? When did they start, and of course, where did they go? I have attempted, for the first time I believe, to answer these questions. In the process, a story emerged. A story that began with the inaugural issue of Motion Picture in February 1911 through the explosion of titles during the troublesome 1920s, the altered focus of the glamorous 193 0s, the gossip-littered and studio-controlled 1940s, up through the dawn of the tabloid-exposé era, ending with the Confidential libel and obscenity trials in the 1950s. Fan magazines during this final decade went from covering fables and legends to exploiting the unfortunate and insecure, a harsh change from which neither the fans nor the magazines ever really recovered. This study examines the magazines from different angles : from the people who read them to the stars about whom they read; from the people who wrote for the magazines to the publishers and editors for whom they worked. It looks at the many devices used by the magazines to secure \"inside informa­ tion\" as well as the various methods employed to encourage the loyalty of subscribers. This work also explores the people whose lives were changed by the magazines, the in­ fluences the publications had on readers, writers and actors alike. Additionally, this study investigates the ways in which the magazines had to reinvent themselves over time in order to survive the shifting attitudes and mores within society and the film community. Fan magazines played an important role in American cultural history. They entertained at the same time they influenced American values. These publications are the precursors of some of the most popular titles today, from People to Vanity Fair to tabloids like the National Enquirer. Documented in the pages of the early fan magazines is the beginning of an American obsession with matinee idols that eventually transformed into a world-wide fascination with all forms of celebrity. Fan magazines, and the people that wrote for them, played a significant role in American film history. Who and what they promoted--or ignored--often determined whether or not a given film or star would be a success. A close look at their influences reveal innovative efforts to build and sustain an enormous readership while simultaneously shaping an entire industry. The publications, after all, were unique entities with deep but informal ties to the expanding and ever-changing business of producing motion pictures. As we shall see, they evolved from promotional tools, propagandis- tic advertisements really, to become what readers wanted. The magazines grew to both inform and entertain a great deal of, the American public at a time when readers could not get enough details about their beloved new recreation, the movies, and particularly about their new heroes and heroines, the movie actors and actresses. Photoplay, one of only two magazines devoted to film in 1913, had a circulation of seventeen thousand. By 1936 Daily Variety estimated that fifteen million people--nearly twelve percent of the American population--read approximately twenty-five different fan magazines in the United States. Ten years later Atlantic put the figure of fan magazine readership as high as forty-five million.^ Whatever the figures, one thing is certain : an enormous number of people focused on one topic--the appeal of movie stars--and for decades, fan magazines were the sole delivery agents. Frequently the publications are referred to as a common indistinguishable form, usually deridingly, once in a while deservedly; they had their ignoble moments. But if my investigations have proven anything, I believe it is that while fan magazines definitely deserve a category of their own, the periodicals themselves retain individual, identifi­ able characteristics. There are differences, subtle and large, among titles and certainly between appearances, style and coverage across the decades. Collectively the fan magazines were in a sense a reflection of our society. Studying their evolution reveals significant changes in American social history. In that they consistently requested and received feedback from their readership, the successful magazines became what the public wanted. Publishers and editors adjusted their coverage, and their opinions and editorials often stood in sharp contrast to the daily newspapers and later gossip columnists. Moreover they began a process that for better or worse is continued today. The way in which society has turned everyone from professional athletes and recording artists to politicians and painters into celebrities--indeed the way that anyone whose life has brushed these same individuals and has become famous on that basis alone--all began long ago with the idolization captured by the fan magazine. It was not what was intended, but it is the result, making the fan magazines a record of who we were as well as what we would become. And so the story of these unique publications, their development and eventual demise, is of as much relevance today as ever, for the fan magazines constructed and dis­ played American myths. And while few complete runs of all titles have been preserved by libraries or private collec­ tors, happily a number of copies of fan magazines have been saved, enough that they--as with the movies they celebrate-- may continue to fascinate, intrigue, and take us away. Prologue Setting the Stage: The Trust vs. Independents Vitascope to Vitagraph Not yet twenty, James Stuart Blackton set off from Sheffield, England, in 1895 for the exciting new world of New York City. Born to a poor family, the former carpenter's apprentice had not yet made up his mind about what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew that the life of a laborer was not for him.^ A handsome man with dark hair and intense eyes, Blackton had artistic ambitions that went unappreciated in his home town, where most men worked long hours in quarries and mines for a decent day's wage. Aspiring to more, and with the optimism and energy of youth, Blackton set sail for America, convinced that grand opportunities awaited him. He immediately landed a job as a freelance reporter for the New York (Evening) World, covering whatever stories he could dig up and sell to the editor. Paid by the inch, he often submitted sketches with his text, to get that much more money out of the paper. While digging for stories, the young man learned of a new machine said to 7 project a \"moving image,\" invented by Thomas Edison. To find out more about the device, Blackton set off to interview Edison in his West Orange, New Jersey, studio. There, the young man amused the inventor with his drawings, including a sketch the young reporter did of Edison himself.^ In turn, Blackton was smitten with Edison's new machine, a film projector that was a derivative of his prior inven­ tion, the Kinetograph, combined with technology developed by others. Edison called his projector the Vitascope. Smitten, Blackton brashly asked to purchase one but was told by the inventor that due to complicated patent restrictions, his company was only able to lease the machines at present. Soon, however, he would be releasing for sale a new model called the Edison Projecting Kinetoscope. Edison promised to notify Blackton when the new projector was available and made good on his word, selling him Edison projector Number Thirteen in November 1896.^ By this time, Blackton had developed a friendship with Albert E. Smith, a budding financier originally from Kent, England. The two examined their new projector, eventually figuring out how to rig the machine to do double-duty as a camera, and the Vitascope became what they called a Vita­ graph. The men began filming first Blackton's drawings, then each other and soon, events like the burning of the Windsor Hotel. They offered their films to local theaters that were popping up in small storefronts on street corners throughout New York City. These theaters, becoming more and more 8 popular among working class folks, were known as \"nickelo­ deons, \" after the price of admission they charged to display short novelty films.'^ In 1899, Blackton and Smith accepted William T. \"Pop\" Rock into their organization, formally incorporating their enterprise as American Vitagraph Company. Recognizing that there were hundreds of theaters, yet only a handful of film production companies, the three men and set out to make motion pictures. Elsewhere, similar motion picture produc­ tion companies were being established by others, including Sigmund Lubin in Philadelphia and Colonel William N. Selig in Chicago.^ Trials to Trust Edison's lawyers, meanwhile, were busy filing lawsuits in an attempt to protect the inventor's U.S. patent number 589,168. Their argument was that since Edison had sold no cameras, any picture made by anyone else was an infringement on his invention. In July 1898, the Edison company had half a dozen lawsuits pending when they sued Vitagraph.^ Since the two men had a prior relationship, Blackton initially was able to strike a bargain with Edison, allowing Vitagraph to continue filming, while providing Edison with the control of all negatives. This would allow Edison's company to sell prints and collect royalties on films made by Vitagraph. The arrangement satisfied Edison and his lawyers for the next eight or nine years, until other companies began requesting similar deals on varying terms. Because Edison's lawyers were not interested in managing dozens of different term agreements with as many companies, they began in 1907 to formulate a standardized contract that was clearly not favorable to the film producers. To protect their interests, eight of the leading film manufacturers got together with west coast film distributor George Kleine (one of three founders of Kalem), and negotiated a settlement with Edison. The profits from the films would be split, with fifty percent going to Edison off the top, the other half divided by different fractions between the remaining members of the organization. By December 1908, membership was limited to the production houses of Edison, Vitagraph, Biograph, Kalem, Lubin, Selig, Essanay, Méliès, Pathé and George Kleine himself.^ The arrangement satisfied the members of the group, now formally organized as the Motion Picture Patent Corporation (MPPC), deridingly known as the \"Trust.\" There remained, however, outside the MPPC, a small but vocal faction of independent production companies that were not satisfied. They claimed the technology they were using was not strictly based on Edison's patents, and thus were unwilling to enter into any profit-sharing agreement with Edison or the Trust. Trouble was brewing. The aim of the MPPC initially was to protect Edison's patent, but as time went on the members broadened their 10 interests and set out to monopolize the market. Restricting film production was one thing but the Trust would have even more control were it to regulate the distribution of films as well. With the number of nickelodeons rapidly increasing all over the country, the Trust began in 1909 to organize a network of film distributors--Imown as exchangemen--forcing them to rent MPPC films only to those exhibitors who would pay the Trust a license fee of two dollars a week. Small as it was, the theater license fee alone brought in over one million dollars a year in revenue for the Trust.® Taking advantage of their disorganized competitors, the MPPC was beginning to completely control motion picture product (the film companies), distribution (the exchangemen), and rental (the theaters). Left out in the cold of course, were the independent film makers, exchangemen, and exhibitors, whose numbers were nonetheless expanding. Several independent thinkers main­ tained that with the public's appetite for movies escalating, even the Trust could not keep up with the demand for more and more motion pictures. Many recognized that there was an opportunity to fight the MPPC, if the independents were to organize and provide a united front. But how? The independ­ ents, by definition, were a loose and diverse group. With so many different players coming and going, the independents as a whole presented little competition to the Trust. There were film companies like Rex, Powers, Thanhouser and Fox, each of whom relied on a different distribution 11 method to get their films to as many theaters as they could. But there were literally thousands of independent exhibitors scattered across the nation who frequently dealt with several exchangemen at once, as their only interest was in securing enough product to satisfy customer demand. Fed up with the disorganized methods of independent distribution channels, theater owners were increasingly inclined to pay the two- dollar license fee to the Trust just to guarantee receipt of a set number of films each week.^ One independent exhibitor in Chicago, however, refused to pay the fee. He was willing to gamble, and willing to fight. His name was Carl Laemmle. Immigrant to Independent Laemmle first came to America as a teenager in 1897 to escape the stifling future he was convinced he would face were he to remain in his small hometown in Germany near the Swiss border. A diminutive man--he was just over five feet-- Laemmle was nonetheless a scrappy fellow with ambition to make it big. Once in the United States, Laemmle tried his hand at various trades, becoming for a time a tailor's apprentice in New York City, a dairy farmer in Wisconsin before opening first one then two small storefront nickel­ odeons in Chicago in 1906.^® A few years later, when the Trust began applying pressure on him to join, Laemmle not only refused their offer, he did so with a vengeance. He set out to dismantle the Trust. First, in 1909, he actively recruited and established a 12 4 - > P u C U o t P ( U z C M a c u O P C M P -P . rP E H Ü P B P • f ü P > 1 --H -P p 1 — 1 Ü J p 1 — 1 C M ■ H P B 0 U 1 U P +j P O C Ü -p 1 — 1 -P p rP ü B p o ■ P T5 s m P o IN - — ' p ■ — - C M Q ) rP T5 = g P » « g P -P p U ] p rP P h p P P O 1 — 1 1 5 p -P p Q ) C Ü u P -P P « O M -l -P O -P -P -P P -P B .

The service networked several different production companies, providing much-needed organization to the distribution of independent films to independent theaters. To publicize his new venture, Laemmle proudly declared his independence from the Trust in April 1909 by placing ads in newspapers and trade periodicals.^^ Still, he was reliant on the erratic production schedules of the various independent film companies. Film production being a new field filled with novices, it was not unusual in the early days of filming for accidents on the set--fires and explosions were common--or problems in developing negatives to ruin the end-product. Laemmle figured that one way to guarantee his new company would have sufficient product to distribute would be to make it himself. Thus, Laemmle established his own film production company in October 1909, the origins of what today is known as Universal Studios. The MPPC, meanwhile, like the Edison company before it, was busy filing suit against any unlicensed company using technology similar to its patents, whether it was for recording or projecting film. Early on, many small companies could not afford to risk a legal battle against the well- funded trust and the majority acquiesced to the power of the MPPC, abandoning their companies or leaving the country. Laemmle, with incredible fortitude, nevertheless remained undaunted. He began taking out full-page advertisements in 13 trade journals taunting the Trust, hoping to provoke other exhibitors and independents into unity and action. Ads stating \"Have you paid two dollars for a license to smoke your own pipe this week?\" began showing up, sometimes accompanied by a figure Laemmle invented to lampoon the Trust, a severe looking \"General Filmco.\"^® The MPPC retaliated by buying up as many exchangemen as they could, trying to weaken independent distribution channels. At the same time, the Trust began to edge out the foreign film market, making shipping and distribution difficult for exporters. The Laemmle Film Service, which had relied on foreign films to supplement their small amount of independent product, found itself facing further strain. Laemmle responded by simply producing more films. In 1909, he made a dozen; the next year his company made over one hundred motion pictures. Next, the MPPC negotiated with Eastman Kodak to secure an exclusive contract for raw film stock. Laemmle reacted by using his contacts in Europe to secure stock from overseas, distributing it himself. The Trust's relentless tactics, combined with Laemmle's rabble-rousing, began to encourage others to get involved. One independent exchangeman, William Fox, filed suit against the MPPC, charging conspiracy in restraint of trade. The movement picked up even more momentum when Laemmle folded his distribution company in with several other independents, forming the Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company. Ten other independent 14 exchangemen joined forces, creating the Film Supply Company of America.^® The combination of the two independent distribution companies now represented more film production houses than the Trust. The gap was beginning to close and it started to show in the theaters as well. In early 1909, there were 2,500 independent theaters competing against 4,000 MPPC-licensed houses. By July 1911, the number of independents had risen to 6,298 versus 6,571 licensed theaters.^® Which group was to win, would depend upon who could best sell their product to audiences. The public, after all, was unaware of the behind-the-scene struggle for control of the growing motion picture industry; the audience simply wanted to see a good story. 15 Chapter One The Teen Years: Stories to Stars Birth of a Magazine When the first fan magazine appeared in February 1911, the American public was clamoring to enjoy the diversion of motion pictures, and they were doing so in droves. In 1907, two hundred thousand people a day were attending nickelodeons in New York state, with double that number on Sundays; by 1910, the numbers were up to nine hundred thousand a day in New York City alone.^ To shore up control of this increasingly lucrative market, J. Stuart Blackton, the head of Vitagraph, had come up with the idea to start a promotional magazine that would serve to publicize only the films of MPPC members. The Trust itself provided the one hundred thousand dollar start-up fee for the venture, with the understanding that each member would contribute two hundred dollars per feature highlighted in the magazine. ^ To pioneer the new monthly periodical, Blackton engaged the services of Eugene V. Brewster, an 16 attorney and former editor of short feature magazines from Long Island. As if to claim ownership of the entire cinematic art form, they called their venture Motion Picture Story Magazine. Approximately eight by ten inches in size, the first issue was one hundred and eighteen pages long and cost fifteen cents. The magazine was available for purchase in the lobbies of all MPPC-licensed theaters, soon to expand to newsstands nationwide. The public enthusiastically received the publication of Motion Picture Story Magazine, despite the fact that the first few issues featured little more than a series of narratives e:xpanding upon the stories of members's films . The masthead proclaimed that the magazine would feature in print the \"most notable of the seventy or eighty stories presented each month\" in film.^ The February 1911 issue of Motion Picture Story Magazine had over a dozen of these stories, each four to six pages in length. Many of the stories filmed by the Trust companies were derived from classic literature, often adaptations of the works of Tennyson or Shakespeare or Dickens. The stories in the magazine then, aimed to provide a condensed version of these tales by featuring stills from the motion pictures. The printed versions were \"illustrated with photographs from life of these actors engaged in the presentation of the photoplay upon which the story is based.Just as librettos provide opera-goers with the text of a dramatic musical piece, these \"fictionalizations\" explained to an audience who 17 might be unfamiliar, the finer points of the saga being retold on the screen. With so many immigrants and working class people attracted to the new medium of motion pictures, the number of people needing such clarification were legion. Still, a large number of people attended motion pictures just to see a pretty face. The Mystery Girl In 1908, the Vitagraph Girl was a mystery. Every week, millions of fans across America crowded into nickelodeons to watch the silent films in which the magnetic dark-haired, wide-eyed beauty appeared. After following the actions of the on-screen heroine for about an hour, most viewers were left mesmerized. When the picture was over, many wanted to know: who was that girl? Vitagraph was not saying. Like the other film companies of the day, Vitagraph did not provide billing for performers' names. Since 1905 when the first nickelodeon opened, studios like Essanay, Kalem, Lubin, Selig, Thanhouser and Vitagraph presented their short films to the public by emphasizing the names of the produc­ tion companies themselves. The aim was to associate in the mind of the picturegoer the name of the studio with the action of the story, thus building a demand for a company's product. Among Trust companies, Vitagraph built its reputation as a purveyor of comedies and classics, while Selig emphasized stories set in the great outdoors.^ Not that feature players in films especially wanted 18 their names known. Several Broadway producers refused to hire those who worked in motion pictures. Specifically, the New York production team of Klaw and Erlanger were known to have openly blacklisted players in films, considering them as traitors, unworthy of returning to stage work after contri­ buting to the demise of legitimate theater by acting in motion pictures. An actor's anonymity was also convenient for motion picture production houses, the owners of which were leeiry of performers acquiring \"names\" for themselves ; renown might lead to the desire for higher wages.^ In advertisements, references to players were usually limited to phrases such as \"artistically enacted by real actors,\" and when companies did receive requests for infor­ mation on particular artists, they were routinely ignored.^ With no other details to go by, the people and the press began referring to actors by the studios with which they were associated. Thus, there was the Biograph Girl, the Kalem Girl, and of course, the Vitagraph Girl. Although it would seem from the adoption of such nick­ names that these women held positions of high influence within their companies, the reality was that the Vitagraph Girl was a simple young woman from Flatbush, New York, named Florence Turner. She had dark wavy hair of medium length and large, expressive eyes which complimented her small mouth and tinier chin. Turner had absolutely no training in the arts and was attracted to work at the studio due more to its proximity to her parents' house, where she still lived, than 19 to any propensity she had for acting.® Perhaps it was this distinctive lack of glamour that the motion picture studios were shielding from an adoring public. Like most of the other members of the Vitagraph players in 1906, Turner pulled double duty: the Vitagraph Girl earned eighteen dollars a week as actress and wardrobe mistress. By comparison, members of the more financially sound Edison Stock Company averaged thirty dollars a week. Still, these figures were fairly high for the day; not until eight years later, in January 1914, would workers on the newly estab­ lished assembly lines of Ford Motor Company in Detroit earn twenty-five dollars a week.® The Dln^led Darling and the Vitagraph Girl Stage actors, of course, could not rely on a steady weekly income unless they were in production. Maurice Costello was a leading actor on New York stages when in the fall of 1909 he found himself between shows. The cinema was robbing theater audiences and the Broadway season was the worst in years. Faced with impressive debts from high living, he applied to play in the films of the Vitagraph Players Stock Company and was immediately hired. The rela­ tionship between studio and actor was rocky at first because Costello refused to work for the company as a carpenter building sets between shoots.10 An established actor of average build with blond curly 20 hair and prominent dimples, Costello immediately attracted a following through the new medium of film. When Vitagraph offered a long-term contract, he accepted only on condition: \"I am an actor and I will act; I will not build sets and paint scenery.\"11 By 1910, Costello had gained a glowing reputation among picturegoers as \"Dimples\" or the \"Dimpled Darling,\" prompting him to further push Vitagraph into publicizing his full name in the promotion of his pictures. They complied in early 1910 and Costello became the first motion picture actor to attain top billing.1^ A precedent had been set. A leading man requires a leading lady and so Vitagraph sought to combine their two best assets. The company transformed Florence Turner's image in order to pair her with Maurice Costello in films. Despite her lack of formal training. Turner had a unique ability to contort her face in many ways, winning equal regard for playing roles as young boys in comedies as well as old women. She gained prominence with each successive feature, but to be considered a romantic lead, Lawrence would need to be presented as a graceful and beautiful heroine. As part of the package, in May 1910, Vitagraph began presenting Turner's name on the screen alongside Costello's.13 With her transformed image and the audience now able to put a name to her face, marriage proposals by the thousands rolled in for Turner. There was an immediate demand for 21 personal appearances by the actress. Vitagraph responded by sending Turner on tour. Crowds crushed into her personal visits at \"Vitagraph Nights,\" with droves of people being turned away from these special nights held across first New York, and then the country. A typical night began with Turner arriving in the Vitagraph touring car from which she dramatically exited and was led through a throng of admirers. Once inside, an introduction was given, often by the theater owner. Turner then briefly addressed the crowd who had not previously heard her voice. Invariably she included a statement about how fortunate she was to actually see her audience, after they had spent so many nights seeing her. Bouquets were thrown to her before Louise Githens Trimble would sing the Vitagraph Girl song, in a rich, contralto voicei^^ I'm in love with the Vitagraph Girl, The sweet little Vitagraph Girl, Each moment a picture of romance or hate. Her tragedy's bully, her love simply great. At the close of the song, the audience frequently demanded an encore and only when they were satisfied would Jean the Dog-- a Vitagraph fixture trained by Turner's good friend and future partner Larry Trimble--come out and do stunts on stage. Finally, a motion picture with Florence Turner was shown, and at its end, the star once again walked through the crowd to make her exit. This was true star treatment. With almost ten thousand movie theaters in the United States, the winds were shifting, 22 ( U tp P r P k l O m C o •H + J U t t i k l -P - P ( U c •p f t J 6 ( U rd -P ( / ] ( Ü +J ( U p • t r * œ P p O rP C r > ■H P P ■H P 0 - 4 P P P ^ - ^ C r > ( U P 1 —iP •H p > 0 p p *p 0 0 u np ' —' P 0 p 1 > 0 P p P p p P tH P P 0 P u p 0 0 p [ 5 0 0 1 —1 P fp Ü as film players gained if not respectability, certainly fame. The result of this fan frenzy for Turner was that the Vitagraph Girl and the simple young woman from Flatbush had become so intertwined as to be inseparable. Vitagraph was pulling record numbers of people to their films and Florence Turner had become a leading lady. Turner starred with Costello in what was arguably the best film of 1911, Vitagraph's Tale of Two Cities. The film was featured in the first issue of Motion Picture Story Magazine along with two photos of Florence Turner and a short biography of Maurice Costello. As editor, Eugene Brewster recognized the public's enjoyment of the players on the screen and acknowledged their interest by adding a regular photo gallery of picture players with the third monthly issue. By August 1911, he began to include a section called \"Letters to the Editor, ' ' containing favorable reactions to photoplays and the magazine by readers. Judging by the hundreds of letters the magazine immediately began to receive, the audience was hooked. Subsequent issues were often sold out within a week of release.^® Picturegoers could not get enough information about their beloved pictures and players. Blackton's brainchild. Motion Picture, proved to be a rousing success. Just as he intended, the magazine was helping to sell the films of the Trust. The time was ripe for a rival. 23 Ï r Magazine : /, A ^ ^ . : r ( ' ^ , ^ , ' \" \" 1 - 7 ? * ' * The second issue of Motion Picture Story Magazine featured thirteen stories, only seven stars in their \"Gallery of Players,\" and Thomas A. Edison on the cover (March 1911) . She's an Imp: the Biograph Girl In 1909, most of the production houses were producing a couple of films each week. Every company worked night and day to get out a new picture before the competition, often without regard to quality. Biograph, a member of the MPPC, was no exception. Directors would often re-write scenarios as they shot a film. The biggest draw for the New York-based studio--which would later gain fame through its most famous director, David Wark (D.W.) Griffith--was the Biograph Girl, who packed the houses in the same way that the Vitagraph Girl filled seats. Unlike Florence Turner, however, the Biograph Girl remained anonymous as long as she was with the company. Biograph did not start revealing players' names until April 1913, by which time, the Biograph Girl had already left. The Biograph Girl was Florence Lawrence and she had begun her career by touring America at the tender age of four, appearing on stage and in tent shows as \"Baby Flo, the Child Wonder.\" As a young adult, Lawrence developed high cheekbones and full lips, a romantic look treasured by the movies. She worked for the Edison Studio and briefly for Vitagraph before settling down as the silent heroine, the Biograph Girl. By all accounts. Biograph in 1909 was at best an erratic place for an actor to work, given the studio's particular fervor for concentrating on the story over the players at any cost. Curious fans seeking information on screen players were not just ignored, as at other companies; they were told 24 that Biograph actors \"renounce their names when they join the c o m p a n y . \"^3 in retrospect it comes as no surprise that when the company learned Lawrence had approached the Essanay studio seeking a joint contract for her and her struggling actor-husband, Biograph did not provide a counter-offer to keep their Biograph Girl, the biggest money-maker they had. They fired her. With production houses desperate for talent, Lawrence was not out of a job for long. Throughout the early years of cinema, it was not uncommon for a player to shop around for different deals at the studios. Contracts were sporadically enployed, and often an actor would work for a year or less with a company before moving on to the next. Competition among production houses was fierce, even as an actor's pay remained low. At the height of her popularity, the Biograph Girl made twenty-five dollars a week, and that was for playing in two pictures.^3 New production facilities starting out without a stock of players, could easily entice an actor to join the company by offering just a slightly higher salary. Carl Laemmle, already in the throes of his fight with the MPPC, had heard of Florence Lawrence when he opened his independent production studio in the fall of 1909. Recog­ nizing that his well-placed ads taunting the Trust attracted attention, he was developing what was most certainly an in­ nate ability for shrewd promotion. He was also in desperate need of players for his new company. 25 Originally, he tried to lure Maurice Costello away from Vitagraph by offering him double his seventy-five dollar-a- week salary, but the actor declined due to the uncertainty of working with an independent. Laemmle was successful in persuading a leading theater actor of the time. King Baggot, to join him at his new production company, and for half of what he was prepared to offer Costello. Still, he needed a leading lady. When Laemmle heard Lawrence was available, he immediately signed her up, finally securing male and female lead actors for his new Independent Motion Pictures (IMP) Company. In 1909, film actors had not yet achieved screen credit. Faced with his adoption of an actress known to the public only by her previous employer's moniker, Laemmle went to work establishing a persona for Lawrence that would attract audiences. Returning to his habit of employing clever ads to get attention, Laemmle came up with the idea of publishing a photo of Lawrence in the trade periodical Motion Picture World solely accompanied by the caption \"She's an Imp.\"^^ Within days of publication, a buzz had begun among exhibitors and distributors alike. While some immediately understood that Imp referred to Laemmle's new production company, others simply acquired a healthy curiosity, which spread to an interested public.^6 Lawrence was featured in the next several new IMP movies and the questions persisted. Who was that girl? Wasn't she ...? When Laemmle chose to 26 divulge who the Imp Girl was, he did so in such a way that he not only grabbed the nation's full attention, he revolution­ ized the way studios viewed publicity and promotion of motion pictures and the players. Meet Me in St. Louis When it came to publicizing his movies, Carl Laemmle was an innovator, combining promotion with profit. In later years he would build a grandstand so the public would pay to watch his company film the pictures that they would later pay to watch in a theater. (Growing beyond even Laemmle ' s dreams. Universal Studios today is as popular a theme park attraction as it is a successful film production company.) The second phase of the \"She's an Imp\" campaign, however, startled the country at the time because it was so dramatic, so captivating, and so wholly unexpected: Laemmle arranged to have Florence Lawrence \"killed\" in St. Louis, in what is widely regarded as the first film-related publicity stunt. Fresh from hosting the World's Fair and the first U.S. Olympics, St. Louis was in 1910 a city already familiar to the nation and the world. With its distance from New York-- still the unofficial center of the film world--St. Louis was a cunning choice of locale for Laemmle to fool an unsuspec­ ting public. First, in March he planted in regional newspapers the devastating story of the beautiful new heroine of IMP films, killed in a streetcar accident in St. Louis. Overnight, headlines spread to papers around the country.^® 27 As the masses mourned, Florence Lawrence's name was immutably linked with IMP, the Biograph Girl a forgotten memory. Moving quickly, Laemmle arranged for the next phase of his campaign. He immediately labeled reports of his leading lady's death \"lies,\" and in so doing, kept the story alive in the papers for days. Laemmle found a way to further his anti-MPPC agenda as well, by accusing the Trust of starting the rumor of the accident in the first place. In the March 12, 1910 Moving Picture World. Laemmle ran the ad, \"We Nail A Lie!\" While all this was going on, in his most brilliant move, Laemmle had Lawrence— who was very much alive in New York— and her current leading man. King Baggot, embark on a train tour across several states, traveling toward the final destination of St. Louis. All along the journey, people everywhere clamored to see the motion picture duo in the flesh. By the time Lawrence and her entourage reached St. Louis, more people showed up to meet her than had welcomed President Taft a few weeks before. Reports had the crowd surrounding Lawrence in a frenzy, ripping the buttons from her coat as mementos, grabbing the trimmings from her hat in an effort to obtain some proof of contact with the Imp girl. A letter to Lawrence dated a few weeks after her arrival, sums up a typical participant's reaction: ...how glad I was that the report of your acci­ dental death proved untrue ... I wouldn't have missed the opportunity of seeing you, for anything at all Miss Lawrence ; and I managed to do so, on Easter Sunday afternoon, in spite of the great 28 crowd, and didn't mind the crush a bit and felt repaid for the trouble, and went home perfectly satisfied, and felt as though I had gotten some­ thing I wanted real badly.® ® Overwhelmed by such a reception, Lawrence fainted.Laemmle watched his profits rise. The moving picture was no longer the attraction, it was the flickering face that appeared on screen that held a fan enraptured. Lawrence's recovery was swift, fueled by her employer's need to maintain his top player's high profile. Laemmle arranged for Lawrence to broaden her exposure by making personal appearances at theaters across the nation, similar to Florence Turner's Vitagraph Nights. Onstage, Lawrence and Baggot acted out vignettes derived from their films and demonstrated how motion pictures were made.®^ Unlike his competitors, Laemmle encouraged fans to write the actress, care of IMP, and in ads and interviews, he began to promote her as \"America's most popular moving picture actress. After all his work building up Lawrence to be a house­ hold name, Laemmle was disappointed by the actress's announcement in 1911 that she was quitting IMP to move to Lubin for a higher salary and an unusual multi-year contract. Since Lubin was a member of the Trust, in July 1911 Motion Picture included Lawrence in its \"Gallery of Players\" for the first time. In December, the magazine featured a first-ever interview with Lawrence in a new department, \"Chats with the 29 0 0 rJ 0 L Ü rd a 0 0 0 0 m a 4-) 0 o 01 0 ' - o 0 u -H 0 0 0 ■H ■H y « .

He had a Trust to bust and he would attempt to do so by beating his competitors at their own game. Leading the charge, he organized other independent producers and exhibitors to get behind a magazine to rival Motion Picture. Photoplay was born. Photoplay: Busting the Trust Photoplay Magazine had actually begun as an entertain­ ment leaflet three years earlier, but its debut as direct competition to Motion Picture was in August 1911. Rights to the circular had been procured earlier--as payment for an outstanding debt--by two businessmen, Robert M. Eastman and Edwin Colvin, both of the W.F. Hall Printing Company in Chicago. The total assets of Photoplay at that time was six dollars and fifty cents and what their own editors termed \"a lot of nerve. For the first few years, the magazine competed solely against Motion Picture. The same size as its competitor, PhotOP1av--named after the word for motion pictures coined by poet Vache 1 Lindsey®^--was offered for ten cents. The contents were pretty much the same: mostly fictionalized narratives of motion picture stories (often as many as twenty-nine an issue), four or five photogravures of popular stars, and an occasional feature story on such things as 30 PRICE, 10 CENTS FEBRUARY, 1912 k k AJS I S \\S^ \\ r I / u \\ . \\ T i T - r \\ i k < ' ; r A : THir: T II?

Motion Picture. scenario writing.®'^ There was nothing much to set Photoplay apart from its rival, except that the publication promoted only independent pictures. The first credited editor was Neil Gladstone Caward, who stayed through 1913,®® but it would appear as if there was a major, perhaps financial, alliance established with independ­ ent film distributors. An early editorial (April 1912), proclaimed a victory over the Trust when the independent Motion Picture Distributing and Sales Company won a signifi­ cant legal decision against the Trust. The issue involved the use of the Latham sprocket, used to advance perforated film through both cameras and projectors. The Trust, which controlled the rights to Latham patent number 707934, charged that independent producers and exhibitors had no legal claim to the use of the sprocket and could not, therefore, legally produce or show films.®^ In arguments against the Trust, Carl Laemmle set out in court to prove that the MPPC could not lay claim to the use of perforated film on the grounds that the use of perfora­ tions were in the public domain. To prove his point, Laemmle produced a roll of toilet paper and dramatically unrolled it across the courtroom, revealing successive squares separated by lines of perforations. Judge Hand of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed and threw out the suit. It was not the only independent victory celebrated by 31 Photoplay. The magazine routinely championed the independ­ ents in the popular player contest, advertisements, and even their \"Question Box\" department. In May 1912, an answer provided to a subscriber from Pittsburgh ran \"You are correct, the Photoolav Magazine is the only one catering to and running soley Independent material and the storyized films are the leaders of the current months. In addition, the magazine frequently ran lists of independent production houses so that readers knew which film companies to support. The largest triumph for the independents occurred in late 1912 when the federal government filed an anti-trust suit against the MPPC. The U.S. government ordered the Trust disbanded on October 15, 1915. There remained for several years lingering lawsuits by individual companies against the MPPC, which kept their entity technically alive for some time. But by April 9, 1917, the Supreme Court settled the last case and the Trust was officially dead.^® Laemmle had won. The decision immediately opened up competition, and previously reticent film companies--many of whom had relocated to California in part to escape the long arm of the Trust--expanded their operations almost overnight. With so many different companies now freely competing for audiences, the actors became the only consistent attraction for most picturegoers. With the November 1913 issue. Motion Picture dropped the word Story from its title and simply became 32 “THE GHOST OF SULPHUR M OUNTAIN” By Emmett Campbell Hall R tM'. from “BEFORE A BOOK W AS W R ITTE N Fourteen Complete, Illustrated Short Stories, from, the Best Plays of the Month The April 1912 issue of Motion Picture offered, fourteen fictional- izations yet began to de-emphasize the word \"story\" in its title. m : m . T:-\"# : ; . h\\'A A m r d c % PRICE 15 GS Players Like Mary Pickford, though still uncredited, replaced scenes from stories on Motion Picture covers by November 1913 Motion Picture Magazine.*^® The covers no longer featured stills from movie scenes, but now pictures of the players. The emphasis was no longer on the studios or the stories, but on the stars themselves. Quirk of Fate With the Trust gone, there was no longer a clear-cut distinction between Motion Picture and Photoolav magazines. The publications no longer needed to promote a group of film production companies. They were now free to celebrate motion pictures in general. Photoolav needed to establish an identity and in 1914 the publishers looked to develop one by hiring James R. Quirk. James R. Quirk was born in Boston in 1884 and worked in publishing for nine years before he signed on with Photoolav. A stenographer and a reporter for the Boston Advertiser, he had for a time been personal secretary to politician John F. Fitzgerald, who would later gain fame as the grandfather of President John F. Kennedy. When Quirk was 22, he moved to Washington, DC, and over the next three years gradually rose within the ranks of the Washington Times to become managing city editor for the newspaper. In 1909 he relocated to Chicago, having been summoned by the publishers of Popular Mechanics Magazine to revive their failing effort, which he did in short order by adding photographs and expanding readership. By 1912, the magazine was turning a profit. Having accomplished his goal so quickly. Quirk, who had 33 married in 1908, moved with his young wife for a while to the wide open spaces of Wyoming. A city boy at heart. Quirk soon returned to Chicago and on his own opened a fledgling adver­ tising agency. Advertising was a tough business for a new­ comer, and he soon found himself over his head in competition with several established and well-respected firms in Chicago. In a stroke of good timing, Robert Eastman who had heard of Quirk's triumph with Popular Mechanics, offered him the opportunity to remake Photoplay. Quirk accepted the job as editor-in-chief in 1914 and closed his agency.\"^® Up to this time, motion pictures held no fascination for Quirk, but he clearly liked a challenge. With his broad background in publishing and other ventures, he had gained a reputation as a \"regular magazine doctor.\" For Photoplav. Quirk was committed to establishing an original, high-quality look and feel. He promptly hired the best editor he could afford, a former Broadway press agent, Julian Johnson, whom Quirk had heard about through Bob Davis, editor of Munsev's Magazine. Under Johnson's able hand and Quirk's guidance, Photo­ plav continued to feature four or six current movie stories described in detail over four of five pages, along with a serial or \"novelette\" or two. In addition to the featured longer articles. Quirk distinguished his publication from Motion Picture by offering a section outlining short plot summaries of the latest films. Now commonplace, these capsule reviews were the first of their kind, and in time 34 grew to become the only critical overviews available of the growing number of pictures from which cinema audiences had to choose. Also in 1914, Photoplay began to feature on its cover large-scale photos of scenes of movies and soon just stars. The photos ran top-to-bottom, side-to-side with no borders, giving the magazine a larger feel. It came with a larger price: up a nickel to fifteen cents. Gone was the cover subtitle, \"Motion Picture Stories.\" What remained super­ imposed over the vivid photos was simply Photoplay magazine, and inside on the contents and editorial pages, \"The Film Book. Simultaneously, Quirk and the Photoplay staff began to focus on the players of the pictures. Whereas earlier issues might feature one, or at the most two, short interviews. Quirk enlarged the number to six or eight, and greatly increased the length of each write-up. In November the magazine included a special multi-part feature on Florence Lawrence's life and career.49 Spread over several issues, the story celebrated not the story, but the star. The evolution that occurred in the 1910s established a focus for the fan magazines that would remain throughout the existence of the publications. The turning point began when audiences learned of the true names of their favorite players. With star billing, fans could look for their preferred actors and follow their careers more closely. When 35 9 B Ï®H ^ m M m m m m m m k 3 S %Ê ! 1^3s>^i>3SSP g K N O T H E R ÊSSE L A S K V n o v e l e t t e fB« Photoplay dropped the subtitle \"Motion Picture Stories\" by November 1914, and began featuring stars like Florence Lawrence on its covers. i -:±SSSP w gsss = Wm: Full-color photographs of players, like Dorothy Bernard, were featured on Photoplay covers by August 1916; the \"$1,000\" was offered ky director Thomas Ince for the best scenario idea. these same actors held personal appearance tours across the nation, an audience formed not just to watch the motion picture, but to see the stars themselves. Finally, with the dissolution of the Trust and the subsequent appearance of so many different film production companies, moviegoers began to lose track of which company made the picture, concentrating instead on who was starring in it. The public wanted to know more about Florence Lawrence and Florence Turner, Maurice Costello and King Baggot. What were they doing now and what would they do next? To find out, every month the devoted fan turned to Motion Picture or Photoplav. and soon several other titles. 36 Chapter Two Questions and Answers, Quizzes and Contests A Burst of New Titles By the mid-teens, the players had become the reason people were buying the Motion Picture and Photoplay. Other publishers took notice and began copying the formula of the two innovative magazines, hoping for a similar success. A number of new titles began appearing all over the country, but few lasted for very long, unable to compete with their well-funded rivals. Some short-lived titles included Movie Pictorial, entering the scene in 1913 only to last for three years. In 1914, Photoplavers Weekly also made a brief three-year appearance that ended in 1917. Movies Weekly, not to be confused with a later title, the singular Movie Weekly, also was published for a while in 1914. Film Fun, focusing on screen comedies, and Feature Movie Magazine, based out of Chicago, both made their debut in 1915, neither lasting for very long. Other newcomers did survive. Moving Picture Stories 37 began in January 1913 and survived through the 1930s. The pictures reviewed and stars covered in this magazine were primarily from the Independent Movie Production Company (IMP, later to become Universal), leading most historians to believe Stories was yet another publicity organ secretly begun by Carl Laemmle. Similarly, Photoplay Weekly Mirror began in 1916 (renamed Photoplay Monthly Mirror in 1917), covering exclusively films associated with Triangle Studios. Readers may or may not have noticed these biases in coverage, as the layout of \"house organs\" tried to mimic the leaders of the field with handsome graphics and often high-quality photogravures. Also, as noted earlier, the stars themselves moved between studios with considerable frequency, and successful films were often brought out for revival, so as to make it difficult for even the most stalwart fan to keep track of who worked where. As was the case with the Mirror, however, the majority of early house organs were considerably shorter in length--the Mirror was only eight tabloid pages long--and printed on cheaper newspaper stock in one tint, blue or sepia. Sufficient space was left on the front of the Mirror to add customized advertising for local affiliated theaters, and on the back, to plug their upcoming weekly schedule of films . One notable challenge to the established pioneers Motion Picture and Photoplay began in 1917. The beautiful, over­ sized Photo-Play World was produced in Philadelphia by George 38 M. Downs, Jr. Printed on glossy, heavy 10X13 stock, the World was clearly an expensive proposition and was sold for twenty-five cents. Billing itself as \"The One By Which All Others Are Governed,\" the magazine had a beautiful three- column layout conceived by art director Claude G . Ousey, with plenty of artful touches surrounded by white space. Insightful, probing commentaries offered by S.J. Warshawsky, mingled with gorgeous, light-and-shadow pictures of (all female) players. Norma Bright Carson gave careful critical review to stage plays,^ and the early work of Adele Whitely Fletcher first appeared in this magazine.^ Repeated references to the otherwise unnoteworthy Betzwood Film Company do arouse suspicions that the World may have been financed by that small studio, also in Philadelphia, but the publication otherwise remained independent. The Photo-Play World was handsome enough with sufficiently interesting copy that it might have prospered long beyond its demise in 1920, had it not been for the loss to influenza of managing editor Harold Parry Quicksall, at the age of twenty-seven.^ Photo-Plav Journal. \"The Magazine with Heart, Soul, and Character\" was also produced in Philadelphia. The Journal begun in May 1916 and lasting through February 1921, was edited by Delbert E. Davenport, who also wrote under the name of Bert D. Essex.^ Averaging fifty-eight pages for twenty cents, the Journal had an atrocious, boxy layout, with several articles on one page, separated by large, distracting 39 ornamental borders. Like its competitors, the magazine featured two or three fictionalizations per issue and six or eight pages of player photos entitled, \"Our Gallery, pictures you can frame,\" photogravure portraits surrounded by intricate borders. Despite its unesthetic appearance, the Journal was successful while it lasted; as a March 1919 editorial states, regarding its incredible circulation growth, \"it is far more than we ever expected in our most sanguine moments. \" ^ The Journal, which called itself a \"movie fan magazine,\" featured the first writings of Maude S. Cheatham, who later went on to write for numerous other publications, as well as the first work of film historian Edward Wagenknecht, author of the seminal book on the si lent-film era. Movies in the Acre of Innocence. The Journal also offered \"For You --and-- For Me,\" the queStion-and-answer column of Madame Olga Petrova, who offered saucy retorts to often innocent questions. Pulp to Classic In another venture, Francis Scott Street and Francis Shubael Smith, bought the New York Weekly Dispatch in 1855. The two men soon expanded their enterprise into what became the largest \"pulp fiction\" mill in the world, producing dozens of magazines. On April 10, 1915, Street and Smith produced their first movie magazine, Picture-Plav Weeklv, \"Devoted to Picture-Plays, Their Actors and Authors.\" For five cents, the first issue was thirty-two pages long and 40 f A U g T E ST ; 5 jVrn E N T h E Y B U Y IX A . SEC: O N 4 mmawl Picture-Play, produced by \"pulp\" publishers Street & Smith, was one of the few early rivals to Motion Picture and Photoplay that survived contained five fictionalized stories as well as a column, \"Hints for Scenario Writers.\"^ Increasingly, readers of the fan magazines were interested in how to sell their stories to the films. With tales, perpetuated by the magazines themselves, of people gaining fame overnight through the sale of photoplay scenarios, more and more people wanted to know the secrets of these successes. Picture-Plav was one of the first magazines to address this need, going so far as to supply \"Model Scenarios for Writers,\" containing a complete example of an effective (unproduced) photoplay.^ Soon, others followed suit, with Motion Picture adding in 1918 \"Photodrama in the Making,\" a column by Henry Albert Phillips that explained \"how photoplays are plotted, written, submitted and sold. By December, Picture-Plav dropped the \"Weekly\" and became semi-monthly. Soon writers such as Grace Kingsley, Dorothy Manners and Norbert Lusk were contributing articles to the magazine, as were the fans. ^ The column \"What the Fans Think,\" was one of the most popular in the publication, often spilling over five pages. Meanwhile, editor Eugene Valentine Brewster felt the pressure of market forces from Picture-Plav and other rivals upon his magazine, the pioneering Motion Picture. Having recently purchased the publication from its founder, J. Stuart Blackton, Brewster knew readership was increasing, but so was competition. In a dramatic move to address both of 41 these issues, Brewster began in September 1915 a sister publication. Motion Picture Classic. With Classic. Brewster tried to appeal to a higher-class clientele. Although it did not differ in many ways from Motion Picture--it had the same gallery of players and there was considerable overlap in departments and other content-- the look and feel was a bit classier, more formal and it averaged less than one hundred pages. Most importantly to Brewster, it provided another outlet for his writers, while giving fans another noncompetitive option. The editor- publisher's reasoning was that, with a slight increase in overhead, fans would buy both magazines at twenty-five cents a copy, and he would capture the profits from each. The numbers initially seemed to be in his favor. Based on a survey by the American Newspaper Annual and Directory, by 1918 Brewster's two publications were leading the market: 1918 Circulation Magazine Title per Issue PhotOPlav 204,434 Motion Picture 248,845 Classic 140,000 Picture-Plav 127,721 Photoplay Journal 100,000 The Answer Man With the progressive popularity of fan magazines, and competition intensifying, publications began reaching out to readers in various ways. The hope was to keep existing as well as attract new readers, while satisfying a constituency 42 ®TrD®K] [Po©ir[y[^ 0 STO RY O F IN C E V IL L E Editor-Publisher Eugene Brewster created Classic as a high-end alternative for his Motion Picture readers. whose curiosities were expanding. Photoplay from the outset offered a reader's forum, \"Brickbats and Bouquets: Complaints and Compliments from Readers,\" but there was no space for editorial replies. Motion Picture sought to respond to inquiries by readers through the \"Answer Man,\" whose column would also appear later in its sister publication. Classic. Beginning in August 1911, the Answer Man, who was depicted by a cartoon drawing of a wise old man with a long white beard, responded in print to inquiries. Interestingly, the questions them­ selves did not accompany his replies, an editorial decision perhaps to save space. Printed in small type, like classi­ fied ads, the answers were short, pithy if not sometimes puzzling: \"Rudy Blues— And what are they? Wait until you see nine reels of 'Dulcy' with Constance Talmadge.\"^^ Responses in chief competitor Photoplay's department, \"Question and Answers,\" also written by an Answer Man, could be equally cryptic : \"M.B.A. - -Many thanks for your letter. I have destroyed it but I won't forget. Most of the answers discussed who starred in or was about to star in what, though the Answer Man did not limit himself to motion picture-related inquiries. He also pontificated on a wide range of subjects from meteorology (the origin of thunder, tides) to beauty (the cause of freckles) to Greek Philosophy. A February 1921 Motion Picture ad for the Answer Man offered his advice in areas \"not having to do with motion pictures, ' ' but the catch was 43 that he would charge \"a fee.\"^\"^ Photoplay, on the other hand, cautioned readers \"not [to] inquire concerning religion, scenario writing or studio employment The Answer Man played up his incredible, far-reaching intelligence as did his Motion Picture colleague, the similarly anonymous \"Photoplay Philosopher.\" Unlike the Answer Man who gave advice, the Philosopher wrote entire columns on one or two subjects pertinent to motion pictures. He gave his learned, often long-winded, opinions on production values, story lines and later, censorship. He also dabbled in predictions. In a 1921 Motion Picture column he reiterated a position he took way back in 1913, forecasting the \"abolition of licensed movies and film companies.The magazine begun by the Trust had predicted its demise I The Answer Man and the Photoplay Philosopher were devices used to maintain contact with the readers. The anonymous authors of these columns claimed to read each and every letter and they attempted to respond individually. The effects of this contact were far reaching: the Answer Man could change a reader's life, as Motion Picture did with Naomi from St. Louis. When the subscriber wrote the magazine requesting the address of actor Romaine Fielding, the Answer Man dutifully supplied it. Then, as the Answer Man reported in his September 1920 column, Naomi wrote Fielding leading the actor to eventually meet his fan. The two dated, married 44 and a year later had a child! The point of the column was as much to interact with the readers in an individual way, as to get a sampling of who these readers were, what their interests were, and where they lived. This provided a wealth of information to the editors, so they might adjust the content. Instructions at the top of the column indicated \"all inquiries should contain the name and address of the writer.\" For those not following directions, no answer was given, and an example was set : \"Hungry Heart--You didn't sign your name--so there's no food. \" By October 1923, the magazine felt compelled to emphasize its position, printing an editorial stating \"we don't read/answer anonymous letters. The Answer Man expanded his repertoire by offering contests, such as the one in March 1918 offering fifty dollars in gold for \"the most sensible question he cannot answer, twenty-five dollars for the most foolish questions, fifteen for the most profound, and ten for the wittiest. Popular Puzzles By far the most popular thing for magazines to do to encourage reader interaction, was to offer contests. In the early days, popularity contests were an obvious way to find out who was capturing the fans' hearts. Motion Picture Magazine held its first \"Popular Player Contest\" in 1912, asking readers to vote by ballot for their favorite stars. 45 By June of the same year, Maurice Costello won with an overwhelming majority of 430,816 votes.Although an inexact science, contests such as these remained a favorite of readers for years, with almost every publication coming up with some sort of ballot-and-vote conpetition: the \"Greatest of All Popularity Contests\" or the \"Ideal Cast Contest,\" in which readers chose their favorite hero, villain and vamp.^^ Interestingly with such contests, there was nothing much in it for the reader but the satisfaction of participation, whereas the publisher was rewarded with first-hand accounts of who mattered the most to his audience. By 1918 Motion Picture sought to increase their take by opening their \"Hall of Fame\" voting contest to subscribers only. Ballots were provided in each issue, allowing readers to vote for their favorite actor and actress of all time while enclosing their subscription payment. Contests of all shapes and sizes were run. \"Can You Sketch a Star?\" Motion Picture asked in October 1924. How about sending in a \"new slogan\" for the magazine?^^ Can you \"cut-out and identify eighteen star silhouettes,\" using the one or two printed each month? If so, over time you may win autographed portraits of the same stars ! There was no end to the creativity. And so, contests became more complex. The \"Popular Players Puzzle\" asked fans to read a three-paragraph nonsense story, picking out the last names of players as they found them. ^^ Then players had 46 to transfer the names to a form, filling in the proper first names. The \"Lips Switched\" contest challenged fans with a series of cut-up photographs to identify the star whose eyes or nose had been pasted onto another's. Even between male and female features, this was a difficult task! Fame and Fortune These types of contests were great for motivating readers to buy magazines, contributing to a fan's sense of \"intimate\" knowledge about popular stars, but readership growth depended on new subscribers. Motion Picture's Brewster recognized the power of reader contact and raised the bar by offering the largest competition of all, the \"Fame and Fortune Contest.\" It would prove to be one of his biggest accomplishments, as well as the beginning of his road to ruin. Run on an annual basis beginning in February 1919, the contest required entrants merely to submit photographs of themselves. Readers of either Brewster publication were eligible, both men and women. The grand prize winner would receive her picture on the cover of Motion Picture, plus two years of guaranteed publicity, \"the sort of publicity that could not be purchased at any price.The judges included the founder of Motion Picture magazine, J. Stuart Blackton, Brewster himself, film directors Thomas Ince and Maurice Tourneur, and everyone's favorite actress, Mary Pickford. Curiously, no closing date was set for the contest. 47 An \"Honor Roll\" of finalists was printed as soon as the next month. Pictures of the chosen women (usually seven or eight of them) appeared in each issue of Motion Picture and Classic while the magazines continued to encourage appli­ cants ; despite the offer, only a handful of men entered. By June 1919, a statement appeared alongside the pictures of women stating that the \"closing date [is] not yet decided.\" Then in August 1919, the contest was suddenly \"closed,\" the winner to be revealed next month ... in the new Brewster publication Shadowland. ^^ Brewster had found a way to use the contest to expand his audience with yet another magazine. If Classic was intended for a higher-class audience than Motion Picture. Brewster's third publication, Shadowland, was designed for even more discriminating tastes. Offered at the unheard of price of thirty-five cents an issue, Shadowland was an oversized, colorful. Art Deco-inspired offering, that paid tribute not just to motion pictures, but to all media \"Expressing the Arts.\" Stage, screen, dance, literature, fine art and philosophy would all be covered in this \"Magazine of Magazines,\" edited not by Brewster, but by his top writer, Frederick James Smith. The artist Albert Vargas, later known for his work in Plavbov, first contributed to Shadowland, as did renowned photographer Alfred Stieglitz and illustrator Eldon Kelly. Pieces on Ezra Pound, Rudyard Kipling and F. Scott Fitzgerald were printed along with articles written by Theodore Dreiser 48 m » 'f:- A B fîE W S T E R -PUDLICATfON The publication Shadowland was a radical but short-lived departure for Brewster, an attempt at blending the fan magazine format with a showcase for other forms of visual and theater arts. and artist Stuart Davis.No expense was spared for this venture on which Brewster and Smith both were pinning their hopes. Shadowland arrived with a splash in 1919 and announced that the very first winner of the Fame and Fortune Contest was Miss Allene Ray, who received limited attention through the next year in Motion Picture. The first winner may have been slightly disappointing, but think of the entrants that did not win: they were broken-hearted. So many had pinned their hopes on making it onto the very pages of Classic, how could they fail? Motion Picture was deluged with variations of that very question from hundreds of aspiring starlets. At one point the publication was forced to print, \"To the Losers of the Fame and Fortune Contest: Why You Weren't Chosen,\" providing a litany of brutally honest reasons: ...your mouth did not photograph well, your profile was bad, your teeth were defective; you were very pretty, but just a little stupid. Your hair was lifeless and unbecomingly arranged. You lacked breeding. Still, there is nothing like the seduction of success, and so the Fame and Fortune contest persevered. In 1920 it was proclaimed to be \"bigger and better than ever. Prizes, including a \"Crescent phonograph,\" a \"Corona typewriter,\" and the coveted \"pocket axe,\" were offered for the top ten individuals, with the grand prize winner this time eligible to appear in a movie written by staff-writer 49 Gladys Hall. Honor rolls were again printed, deadlines extended, but this time the judges personally interviewed the finalists. While hundreds of women entered, only twenty-five were invited to \"Chalet des Lacs,\" the Long Island estate of editor Eugene Brewster. There a winner was chosen, announced in January 1921. She was a slight, pretty woman with wavy brown hair from Macon, Georgia. A former shop-girl, her name was Corliss Palmer. Beauty's Crown Tumbles After winning the contest, Corliss immediately began appearing first in feature articles throughout Brewster's publications, following soon after in ads for beauty powders, hair conditioners and face creams. A feature on her hair, \"Beauty's Crown\" appeared in the April 1921 issue of Motion Picture, while the June number carried an article in which Palmer listed all the benefits of winning the contest. The main advantage for the aspiring actress was the powerful ally she gained in Eugene Brewster. The two quickly formed a bond, focusing on one singular goal to advance both their careers: making Corliss Palmer into a star. When Eugene Brewster met Corliss Palmer, he was a millionaire, married with two children. But as one thumbs through the pages of his publications from the point at which they met, it becomes quite clear that Brewster slowly became enamored with Miss Palmer. Her appearances become increas- 50 ingly regular, the references more and more glowing. Whether it was her Southern charm, her captivating eyes, or the desire held by them both that she would succeed, the two began an affair which eventually ended Brewster's marriage. By March 1922, the editor-publisher was starting a brand new magazine. Beauty, featuring Corliss Palmer the \"Georgia Peach.\" Unfortunately, despite his best efforts over several years, Brewster's attempts to make Palmer a star did not take. The relationship, however, endured. In 1926 he divorced his wife and married Palmer. In a last desperate move, Brewster sold his estate, the interest in his businesses, and the couple moved to California with the hope that Palmer's chances of becoming a star would be greatly improved in Hollywood. They were not. Palmer's acting career never took off and she divorced Brewster in 1933, moving to obscurity in Arizona. Brewster died alone and penniless in California in 1939. She's It! Before the Brewster-Palmer drama unfolded, or rather, as it began, there was another Fame and Fortune contest winner waiting in the wings in 1921. A sixteen-year old girl from Brooklyn saw the ad for the contest in Motion Picture, \"through the portal of the Fame and Fortune Contest you may enter the kingdom of the screen,\" and was wide-eyed with excitement. Unfortunately, her mentally unbalanced mother, Sarah, was also a deeply religious woman, adamantly against 51 The \"Answer Man\" (top) was depicted by Motion Picture as a wise old sage able to offer expert responses to any reader inquiry. Corliss 'Palmer (above left) married Eugene Brewster (right) in 1926, after winning his magazine's \"Fame and Fortune\" contest. the frivolity and immorality of the movies. The young girl got on better with her father, Robert, whom she somehow convinced to take her down to Coney Island so that for one dollar she might have two photos taken to enter the contest. They were a bit blurry, and quite small, but would have to do. Given her mother's attitude toward films, the youngster did not want to involve the mail, so she snuck out of the house one day and went to the editorial offices of Brewster Publications in Flatbush, New York, to personally deliver her application. Luckily for her a manager accepting the entrance form wrote on the cheap photographs, \"called in person -- very pretty. In time she made the honor roll and as one of the finalists was asked to sit for a screen test at the Brewster estate. That same day, September 12, 1921, the Arbuckle case hit the papers, a scandal unlike Hollywood, or the world, had ever seen. The teenager knew if she had a chance she would again have to sneak out of the house, bypassing her mother, to make her appointment. Wearing a little plaid dress, the tomboy with alarming red hair and big black eyes, felt considerably out of place upon arrival: she was competing primarily against statuesque blondes. For the screen test she had to \"walk into camera range, pick up the telephone, laugh, look worried, then terrified.\" The last part would not be so hard, she thought. When it was her turn, the young girl, not knowing any better, performed the tasks as she would naturally, simply being 52 herself. In doing so, she stood out. The judges loved her and announced in the January 1922 issue of Motion Picture that they chose Clara Bow from Brooklyn as the winner. The magazine also included a three-paragraph letter of acceptance from their \"new star,\" in which she mentioned Brewster publications four times. For a prize, she selected \"a little Bolero jacket.\"^® All was not well upon her arrival home, however, for Clara was confronted by her mother. The young girl admitted everything to her fuming mother, an experience so traumatic that Clara fainted. When she awoke hours later, Sarah was hovering over her, cursing and damning her daughter for her evil ways.^^ But it was too late; Clara Bow had found her calling. Clara Bow would later earn renown for being the \"It\" girl, as defined by author and scenario-writer Elinor Glyn. Volumes would be written about what \"It\" was, but the essence boiled down to a compelling sensual appeal and Clara had \"It\" in spades. Hollywood exploited her image for years, and Clara appeared in a number of acclaimed films including Wings and Children of Divorce, both made in 1927 with Gary Cooper (with whom she had an affair) . But her past would come back and haunt her with the advent of talkies. Clara Bow had received little formal education and her inarticulate speech, combined with her Brooklyn accent, ruined an otherwise promising film career. 53 AUGUST, 1927 PRICE 25 CENTS CLAÆA BO W, Painted hy A m ta Parkhîiriÿ^Â / Clara Bow was proclaimed by author Elinor Glyn to be the \"IT\" girl, after winning Motion Picture's \"Fame and Fortune\" contest in 1921. Her eventual decline might have been foretold by her mothery Sarah, as she rocked over her only child that night, sputtering invectives. But no one took Sarah very seriously until February 19, 1922. On that day, the opening of Clara Bow's first movie, Bevond the Rainbow. her mother inexplic­ ably began shouting violently at her husband and daughter, threatening them both with a kitchen knife. Five days later she was committed to an insane asylum, where she would later die, oblivious her child had won fame and fortune as a star in the sinful land of Hollywood. Whereas the editors of Motion Picture thought they had created a star, Sarah Bow was convinced they had created a monster. She was not so far off. There was a beast in Hollywood, already rearing its ugly head. Beginning with Fatty Arbuckle, \"Scandal\" was rocking the motion picture industry, creating multifarious problems for the fan magazines. The publications would be forced throughout the 192 0s to deal with the dilemma of how to properly handle indiscretions and tragedies besetting popular players. Although film production coitpanies and fan magazine publishers experienced growing pains in the early part of the 1910s, by the end of the decade the groundwork had been established for a time of experimentation. The movies explored for the first time color and night photography, as well as other special effects. The magazines tried a variety of ways to reach out to their readers in order to discover what the fans wanted out of the publications, to help the 54 editors set the tone and direction for future issues. At the end of the 1910s the magazines and the popular players faced drastic choices; how they behaved and how they made out in the long run were often intertwined. The 1920s were defined by a cycle of great exploration within the film and publishing industries. As with any period of testing the limits, some participants ran a steady course of conservatism, not taking any chances of losing their followers, while others took the opposite road, flaunting extreme behavior that ultimately cost them the loyalty of even their most ardent fans. 55 Chapter Three The Twenties: Scandals and Serials The Wild Party The Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle scandal broke on September 12, 1921, though the infamous party in San Francisco had occurred a week before. Much has been written and speculated about the death of Virginia Rappé since that time, including the effects it and the subsequent three trials for manslaughter--all ending in acquittal--had on the comedian's career.1 The conclusion by all but one juror was that Arbuckle had little, if anything, to do with the death of the young call girl and erstwhile actress. The married actor did not host but merely attended a party in which Rappé was present, a party where \"bathtub gin\" was generously poured. Indeed, there was no substantiated evidence that proved Arbuckle even knew of her before he had the misfortune of being among the three persons who saw Rappé breathe her last breaths. Had it not been for an overzealous district attorney who was up for reelection the next year, the case would probably 56 never have gone to trial once, much less three times. The involvement of a motion picture actor known by millions made it news, so every courtroom drama and lurid detail of the case was printed in the country's newspapers, while the fan magazines debated how to cover the story. People, many of whom had never even seen an Arbuckle film, faithfully followed the events in the daily papers. The Arbuckle case made history, providing a sad introduction to what would become known in Hollywood as a decade saturated with scandal. The two hundred and sixty-six pound Arbuckle was no angel. Discovered by Mack Sennett in 1913 while working as a plumber for the director. Fatty and his great girth supplied many opportunities for physical comedy. Sennett, the first man to give Charlie Chaplin a break, made Arbuckle a star. Four years later, Arbuckle signed on with the new Paramount studios at a whopping five thousand dollars a week. Ironically, it was the occasion celebrating this move that precipitated the great comedian's fall. On March 6, 1917, the man behind Paramount Studios, Jesse Lasky, threw a party in New York's Copley Plaza in honor of Fatty Arbuckle having joined the company. In attendance were other movie producers, including Adolph Zukor and Joseph Schenck. The party went on to the wee hours of the morning with several men, including Arbuckle, eventually taking leave to visit Brownie Kennedy's infamous \"roadhouse\" in Woburn, Massachusetts. Kennedy and her girls entertained the men without regard to an apparent spy at the window who 57 reported the incident to police. The girls and the authorities were subsequently paid off and the incident was thought by all involved to have been \"handled,\" until politics again interfered. The Attorney General of Massachusetts, having gotten word of the events, investigated and filed charges against the bribed officials and sought their removal. The accusations of corruption combined with Arbuckle's famous name hit the papers in July 1921, just two months before the \"wild party\" in San Francisco, a case of bad timing that did not help the comedian's defense.^ Before the Arbuckle debacle, fan magazines had paid little mind to Fatty and most other comedians. Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd were sometimes discussed in departments noting upcoming productions, but they were rarely featured in articles or on covers. Most comedians--Arbuckle included--were beloved for their characters, not for their own personal charms, and consequently were not as popular in fan magazines as their dramatic counterparts. Ironically, when the case broke, Arbuckle was just beginning to turn this phenomenon around, securing in March 1921 his own department \"Laugh and Grow Fat\" in the new Street & Smith publication. Film Stories. Movie Weekly The fan magazines were faced with a dilemma : cover the Arbuckle scandal and risk damaging Hollywood's good standing 58 or ignore it, putting their own reputation at peril. Interestingly, most publications chose a third option, riding the crested wave of the scandal, addressing its consequences while not contributing to the growing legion of reporters lining up to cast the first stone. For several years, Brewster of Motion Picture and Quirk of Photoplay did not specifically refer to the Arbuckle case in their editorials or features. Instead their publications focused on the rising tide of censorship in the movies, coming out decidedly against it. They tried to make sense for their readers of the small but vocal minority decrying the morals of Hollywood, as they explored Will Hays and his recent appointment as head of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association. One publication that began in 1921, Movie Weekly, did not shy away from the story. The ten-by-twelve inch magazine was mass produced in one-color, a brown sepia-toned ink, on cheap newsprint and averaged a scant thirty-two pages. It was produced by Bernarr Macfadden, a fifty-three year old health nut turned millionaire publisher, creator of Physical Culture. True Storv and True Romances magazines. Movie Weekly was a sensational little rag that neverthe­ less occasionally featured writers of note and was destined to go down in history for one of its contests. While other magazines created stars, Movie Weekly named them. In mid- 1925, small-time actress and occasional dancer Lucille LeSueur hired a publicity director, Pete Smith, who 59 immediately recommended the woman change her name. LeSueur sounded \"too stagy,\" too much like \"le sewer,\" he said. Turning a problem into a publicity stunt. Smith worked with Movie Weekly to sponsor a contest, carrying photos of LeSueur with entry blanks asking readers to rename the actress. The contest ran for months until the winning entry was finally selected, a suggestion sent in by Mrs. Marie M. Tisdale from Albany, New York. From then on, Lucille LeSueur was known as Joan Crawford.^ Movie Weekly was possibly better known for its center­ fold, \"Bernarr Macfadden's Beauty Pages.\" This feature contained several paragraphs by the fitness fanatic, explaining how to breathe properly for better health or extolling the hidden benefits of swimming on one's complexion, all of which was surrounded by the real treat : the four to six women usually in skimpy bathing suits given prominent display. The centerfold had less to do with movies perhaps than gaining a male readership. Nevertheless, Macfadden, who would go on in 1924 to found the tabloid-style New York Graphic newspaper, giving Walter Winchell his first column, did not shy away from notoriety. He knew a good controversy sold magazines. And so Movie Weeklv distinguished itself from the other film publications by, among other things, covering sensational topics like the Arbuckle story. \"I Did Not Hurt Virginia Rappé,\" screamed the headline in Movie Weeklv's December 31, 1921 issue. Here, amidst the 60 i m yûOOO rewàrd m € m % # !><ffokÇçÊ.^M Bernarr Macfadden's Movie Weekly preferred sensationalism over consistency, as with this July 7, 1923 issue declaring Hollywood's morals \"clean\" while carrying Mrs. Rudolph Valentino's accusations of \"Graft in the Movies.\" new year's resolutions of the stars, was Roscoe Arbuckle's \"True Story,\" running three pages long and filled with graphic descriptions, before the comedian, claiming he was \"morally acquitted, \" appealed to the public to \"welcome me back on the screen.\" He thanked God and the \"multitude from all over the world who have telegraphed and written to me in my sorrow and expressed their utmost confidence in my innocence. Movie Weeklv was decidely pro-Arbuckle, but Macfadden was undoubtedly attracted to the story for its sensational value. His publication continued to mine the story for all it was worth, printing \"'I'm Broke' says 'Fatty' Arbuckle\" in the July 29, 1922 issue. In this article, the comedian tells Constance Palmer that to date he had been fortunate enough to receive work from Joseph Schenck as an uncredited scenario writer, but that otherwise his bills were \"piling up.\"^ Arbuckle did direct some features for Paramount, under the pseudonym Will B. Good, but was ordered by Will Hays not to appear in any films for a period of two years. When one magazine did make mention in August 1923 of Arbuckle's return to vaudeville, it was only a mention in their \"Inside Stuff - What's Really Going In Hollywood\" gossip column.^ Finally, four years after the scandal broke, James Quirk used his editorial space in Photoplav in August 1925 to make a \"plea for fair play\" on behalf of Arbuckle. Saying that he would like to see the comedian receive a 61 \"square deal,\" Quirk--rabidly anti-censorship--urged his readership to write Will Hays and protest Arbuckle's treatment.^ Whether the fans did or did not write. Quirk's appeal was unsuccessful; little more was ever heard from Arbuckle. Not so for Movie Weeklv. the pit-bull of fan magazines, which quickly found other topics on which to gnaw. For all of May 1922, the publication haunted Rudolph Valentino who, despite his marriage to Jean Acker, had run down to Mexicali and married Winifred Hudnut, daughter of a millionaire perfume manufacturer. The two lovers had met on the set of Blood and Sand, where Miss Hudnut--who, understandably, went by the stage name of Natacha Rambova--was art director for Rudy's co-star, Alla Nazimova. For four consecutive issues. Movie Weeklv accused Valentino of bigamy, until the star's ex-wife finally surfaced to refute the matter.® The 1920s certainly had bigger scandals brewing. Some, like the Arbuckle case, were eventually too big for the fan magazines to ignore. But there were earlier incidents involving others, which were completely swept under the carpet. One or two of these, surprisingly, had to do with America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford. Poor Little Rich Girl On January 7, 1911, after leaving Biograph to work for Carl Laemmle's IMP company, Mary Pickford married a fellow player with whom she had previously worked, a ruddy Irishman 62 with piercing blue eyes named Owen Moore. ^ The couple stayed with Laemmle for less than a year before moving to the new Majestic Company where they made only five films together before leaving the dreadfully mismanaged company. By 1912, Moore signed on with Victor Films, while Pickford returned to Biograph and her old mentor, D.W. Griffith. For four years, Moore languished in obscurity. Mean­ while, Pickford made dozens of films for Griffith as well as Adolph Zukor's Famous Players. Her popularity enabled her to be the first star to win a contract for over one hundred thousand dollars a year, a deal which the star initiated with Zukor and negotiated personally.^ In 1916, in cooperation with Famous Players, she developed her own production company, Pickford Film Corporation, the first woman to do so. It was during the next two years that Mary Pickford would become \"America's Sweetheart,\" by appearing as wholesome little girls in such endearing films as The Poor Little Rich Girl, Stella Maris and Rebecca of Sunnvbrook Farm. Behind the scenes, America's sweetheart was proving herself to be the nation's sharpest businesswoman. Keeping her production company intact, Pickford left Zukor for First National in 1918. Her salary was an astounding one million fifty thousand dollars a year, with fifty thousand dollar bonuses given to both her mother Charlotte, and her brother. Jack. That same year she was the outstanding winner of Motion Picture's popularity 63 contest, receiving 106,840 votes. Comparatively, the leading male star received a mere 80,300 votes, though he did make the cover; his name was Douglas Fairbanks. Pickford made three films with First National before making history once again. Along with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, western star William S. Hart and Douglas Fairbanks, Pickford formed in 1919 a brand new motion picture company called United Artists. The first release by \"the Big Five\" was a huge hit for the new company and \"Little Mary,\" PolIvanna. By March 1920, at the age of twenty-eight, Mary Pickford was the undisputed queen of motion pictures. Divorce# Court# Mary The fan magazines loved Mary Pickford. She was the icon of refined purity, and in 192 0 she was at the top of her game, professionally. Unfortunately, the circumstances of her personal life were threatening to place her career in jeopardy. Pickford, long estranged from her husband, had been living on her own for years. Fairbanks--a fellow actor whom Pickford had met at Famous Players--was recently granted a divorce from his wife Beth, whom he had left with his young son in New York. The two actors, both known for their spotless images on-screen, had been carrying on a torrid affair for four years in California.^® On March 2, 1920, Mary Pickford filed for divorce from Owen Moore in Nevada. Although she had been visiting the 64 State for less than a month, and despite laws requiring a six-month residency, Pickford emerged in half an hour from the courthouse with a decree in hand. The judge, evidently, was a Mary Pickford fan. She returned to California and married Douglas Fairbanks just over three weeks later, on March 28. As with the Arbuckle case, it is very telling how the fan magazines handled such a delicate situation in the 1920s. The March 1920 issue of Motion Picture recounts a visit by Pickford to the staff of the magazine. In the article, Pickford is described as \"gracious\" and \"demure,\" just as her audience would hope for her to be in person. The only reference to her troubles are found in the introduction, stating that the star arrived a bit late, \"after an appearance in court. The next month the same magazine announced her as one of the participating judges of the upcoming Fame and Fortune Contest, the one that eventually chose Corliss Palmer as winner. No mention was made in Motion Picture of Pickford's divorce or subsequent marriage until an innocuous spread in the September issue, celebrating \"Mr. and Mrs. Fairbanks at home.\"^® Clearly Motion Picture, which did not shy away from mentioning other divorce cases in its pages, elected not to sullen the image of such a good friend to the publication. From 192 0 until their divorce in 1933, Pickford and Fairbanks enjoyed an unchallenged reign in the pages of 65 A BREWSTER PUBLICATION MAGA&iNE 25 ÇTS M ary P ickfo rd # Mary Pickford continued to receive star treatment from Motion Picture even though her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks came less than a month after her hasty divorce from Owen Moore. the fan magazines, often described as the \"king and queen of Hollywood.\" The pair continued making motion pictures, winning the adoration of fans, and ruling over the movie colony from high atop their fantasy home at Pickfair in Beverly Hills.
