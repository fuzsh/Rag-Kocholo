        "text": "JOHN HILL was born at Windsor Castle, Berks county, Pennsylvania, May 24, 1787, son of Jacob Hill, a soldier of the Revolution, and grandson of John Daniel Hill, who was born in Philadelphia county, Pennsylvania, about 1723, and late in life removed from Windsor Castle, Berks county, to Greensburg, Westmoreland county, where he died about 1814. The family is descended from an ancestor who migrated from Ireland to Switzerland after the Reformation; and as early as 1682 and soon after they were represented in southeastern Pennsylvania. Jacob Hill removed to the Muncy valley in 1794, locating within the present limits of Wolf township, and here John Hill was reared and obtained a limited education; and here he resided upon the parental homestead or in its immediate vicinity, until his death a period of seventy-nine years. His father suffered from physical disability entailed by his military service, and at the age of eighteen John Hill, being the eldest of his sons, was obliged to do much of the business of his father beyond the home, especially at the courts of the county, and thus early formed those business habits to which his future success is largely attributable. In 1815 he married Catharine Steck, and they were the parents of twelve children: George Hill, M. D., of Hughesville; Jacob and John, who died in infancy; Rev. R. Hill, of Mount Airy Seminary, Philadelphia; Dr. Charles M. Hill, of Hughesville, deceased; Elizabeth, wife of Elwood Hughes, of Dixon, Illinois; Sarah A., deceased wife of Rev. P. Born, D. D., of Missionary Institute, Selinsgrove; Susanna, widow of Rev. Joshua Evans; Hannah, deceased wife of Capt. A. C. Mensch, of Dover, Delaware; Martha, deceased, who married Rev. Charles Ehrhart, deceased, formerly professor at Pennsylvania Col-lege, Gettysburg; Mary C., wife of Rev. J. R. Dimm, D. D., principal of Missionary Institute, Selinsgrove, and Margaret, deceased. About the year 1812 Jacob Hill was elected captain of a military company; he subsequently rose to the rank of major, \"and displayed ability as a tactician. In 1836 he was commissioned as justice of the peace, and held this office until it became elective. He became a Whig during the second term of Jacksons presidency, and at the formation of the Republican party became an earnest supporter of its principles and measures. About the year 1830 he took advance ground regarding the use of alcoholic stimulants, and was ever after an ardent temperance advocate. He became a member of the Lutheran church early in life; much of his life he was an officer in the church, and at all times he was zealous in promoting her interests. In this faith he died, June 1, 1873, at the advanced age of eighty-six years and six days.\n\nGEORGE HILL, M. D., was born in Wolf township, Lycoming county, January 14, 1816, son of John Hill. His early education was obtained under the tuition of Mary Hopkins, daughter of Rev. Uzal Hopkins, an Episcopal clergyman, William Rea, Jonathan Worthington, and B. M. French. At the age of seventeen he entered the Milton Academy, where he received instruction from Revs. David Kirkpatrick and David Furgeson, and among his surviving schoolmates at this famous institution are Dr. Thomas Lyon, Andrew G. Curtin, and William Hayes. In the spring of 1835 he entered the office of Dr. John W. Peale at Hughesville as a student of medicine; and after attending two preparatory and two regular courses at the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, he graduated from that institution on the 1st of March, 1838, with the degree of M. D. On the 1st of April following he began practice at Hughesville in partnership with his former preceptor, whose property he purchased at the expiration of six months. Here he continued until the autumn of 1847, when he disposed of his professional interests and took a third course of lectures at his alma mater. On the 1st of April, 1848, he located at Bloomsburg, where he had an extensive practice until April 1, 1855; he then returned to his former field of practice at Hughesville, where he has ever since prosecuted his profession. In 1839 there were but three practitioners in Lycoming county south and east of Williamsport Doctors Wood, Rankin, and Hill; the latter has lived to see this number increase to thirty within the period of his active professional life. On the 10th of September, 1840, Dr. Hill married Rachel, daughter of Jeremiah Hughes, of Catawissa, Pennsylvania, and granddaughter of William Hughes, the founder of that town. This family was prominent in the Society of Friends, their ancestors having come from England in 1682 with Penn. To Dr. and Mrs. Hill were born the following children: J. Clinton, attorney at law, Williamsport; J. Harvey, M. D., Baltimore, Maryland; George A., M.

Baltzer and Elizabeth Steck had three children, two of whom, Frederick and Catherine, were born while they still resided at Northumberland, and John was born in Wolf township. Baltzer Steck was a brother of Rev. J.

At the expiration of his term of office he returned to the States, and settled near the place of his birth, Hughesville. In the year 1882, he purchased landed interests near Winchester, Virginia, where he died October 6th of the following year.

In 1887 he purchased thirty acres of land adjoining Hughesville, and laid out what is known as Stecks addition to that borough, whereon there have been already about thirty houses built. He has devoted considerable time to scientific study and research. In the summer of 1855 he furnished for publication in The Agriculturist, at the request of the editor of that journal, a history of the \"Habits, etc. of the Wheat Midge,\" an insect which at that time threatened the total destruction of the wheat crop of our country. Other articles of a scientific character from his pen have from time to time appeared in the public press.
