        "text": "Biography*Census 1880 Ashland, Clay Co., AL \\(Sarah E. Culpepper 32 GA SC SC dressmaker 1 of 7 boarders at Elizabeth R. Williams residence)\\.\n\nSarah Elizabeth was known as \"Lizzie.\" Her father recorded her birth in his Bible: \"Sarah E. Culpepper was born March the 26th 1844.\" Lewis Peek Culpepper also recorded her death: \"Sarah Elizabeth Culpepper departed this life June 22nd 1889 age 45 years two months & 27 days\" and yet she wrote a letter to her father dated \"Jan 26th 1890.\" On p. 217 of Cemeteries of Clay County, Alabama the dates on her tombstone are recorded as 26 Mar 1844 - 22 Jun 1899. No help. In a letter that Lewis Peek Culpepper wrote in 1898 he mentions that two of his children are dead which means that Sarah must have died before 1898. Both the tombstone and Bible record show that Sarah Elizabeth died on June 22nd. It is possible, since Sarah Elizabeth wrote the letter in January of a new year and was obviously not feeling well, that she confused the year. It is also possible that an aging Lewis Peek Culpepper made an error on the Bible record but he carefully calculated how old she would have been when she died based on a death year of 1889. Until further evidence is found, the following letter will have to be proof that she was still living in 1890. This is probably the last letter that Sarah Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Culpepper wrote to her father: _________________________Lineville Ala ______________________________Jan 26th 1890 Rev. L. P. Culpepper ______________________________Fredonia Ala Dear father _________________________I know you think I am a long time answering your letter I am ashamed of it But I think of you all just as often as if I were to write every day.

They were all as well as common at Matt's(?) but Ann herself said she had a severe pain in her shoulder. She had just got a letter from Ga. Said Emma Beekham (Aunt Jane's daughter) died sometime in Dec. with consumption. You know they lived in Macon. She went back to her mother's to die died the next day after she got there.

Your loving daughter ______________________________Lizzie\n\nLizzie died at the home of her sister, Mrs. Clarissa Culpepper Griffin, in Lineville, AL. Biography*Francis Daniel Culpepper was known as \"Dan.\" A granddaughter, Mrs. R L (Rita Boyett) Holland, wrote in a 25 Jul 1978 letter that the name on his tombstone is \"Franklin Daniel Culpepper\" but her mother, Mrs. Mary Ellen Culpepper Boyett, \"remembers his [her father's] name as Francis Daniel.\n\nDan seems to have been a high-spirited and adventuresome young man. His niece, Mrs. J. H. (Margaret Phillips) Dodd, in a 21 Aug 1978 letter, recalled a story about Dan when he was a teenager living at home: Mother [Mrs. J. H. (Julia Culpepper) Phillips] told us a story about Uncle Dan which made him a hero in our eyes. A man by the name of Hosey, about Uncle Dan's age, came by and asked Grandfather [Lewis P. Culpepper] for work. After talking with him for some time, he [Grandfather] decided to try him out. He was a good worker and he [Hosey] and Uncle Dan would hire out to other farmers to make money. Uncle Dan had a fine saddle horse he called Celam. Hosey would ride one of the other horses and they would go places and have dates together. About six months later, Uncle Dan got up one A.M. and Hosey was not there. He went to the barn looking for him and found that his horse Celam was also missing. He [Dan] quickly figured out that Hosey had stolen his horse and skipped out. He was very angry and set out to overtake him. He [Dan] took one of the horses and along the way would ask farmers if they had seen Hosey, describing him and the horse. Late in the P.M. he [Dan] would stop at a farmer's house, tell him about the horse thief and ask if he could leave his horse and borrow one of his so he could ride all night. The next A.M. he would check to see if he were on the right trail, tell his story and borrow a fresh horse for the day. Early on the third A.M. he came upon a farm house and saw a horse in the lot that looked like Celam. He whistled to him [the horse] and Celam stood up on his hind feet and answered him. Uncle Dan went to the door and asked the farmer if the man who rode that horse was there. The farmer said he was having breakfast and asked him in. When they got to the kitchen the farmer's wife said when the man heard your voice he ran out the back door. They looked out and Hosey was running as fast as he could headed for the woods. The farmer asked Uncle Dan if he wanted to go after him but he said no he just wanted his horse. They invited him to have breakfast and sleep for a while before starting home.\n\nDan soon moved to Texas and became a cowboy there. Mrs. Otis Francis Culpepper wrote in a 24 Sep 1978 letter that \"'Papa Dan' was a cowboy who helped with cattle drives from Texas to Kansas....\" A niece, Mrs. S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper) Crossman, wrote in a 24 Sep 1978 letter about her family staying with Dan and his family: I remember the cold winter, snowy nights and of the stories he told us about the heavy snow storms he drove cattle through this part of Texas. He herded cattle for years. I thought he was some kind of \"hero.\" I was a small child I think about six years old. He must have had an adventurous life. I loved him dearly.\n\nAnother niece, Mrs. J. M. (Iva Culpepper) Cline, wrote 20 Dec 1978: Uncle Dan was a cowboy and helped settle up part of Texas and Oklahoma. I used to hear him tell about the narrow escapes they had with Indians trying to steal their horses and cattle.\n\nMrs. Charles (Margaret Whatley) Lee wrote 26 Nov 1978 that she had visited Alsie Rutland in LaGrange, GA and added: He said years ago a group of Indians passed through and stopped at his place and wanted something to eat.... He found out they were from Oklahoma and he asked them if they knew Daniel Culpepper and they said yes, they had been in his house many times and that was the last news he ever had about Daniel....\n\nMrs. Otis Francis Culpepper wrote in a 24 Sep 1978 letter that the family had Dan's 1873 Winchester bought in Dodge City, KS.\n\nAt age 30, in 1890, he married Mary Ellen Loter, and took up the more settled life of a farmer. A niece, Mrs. J. M. (Iva Culpepper) Cline, in a 20 Dec 1978 letter, recalled a story Dan told about the time: He told about when he and his pal [Charlie Carroll?] decided to settle down and get married. They got on their horses and rode off and was going to stop at the first town they came to. So I think it was Quanah [in Hardeman County, or perhaps Kirkland, in Childress County], Tex., I'm not sure. At the edge of town they say two beautiful girls drawing water for the cattle at the well. Each decided which one they wanted. They spent the night there, went to work on the farm and they married the women at the well soon after that. Uncle Dan and Aunt Mollie went to Greer County and filed on some government land, that is how he acquired all that huge farm land.... Seemed strange that they lived in a small house. Uncle Dan had all kind of expensive farm equipment that money could buy. He raised horses, cattle, and most everything else. My father [Thomas Jefferson Culpepper] was fascinated when he fould out how easy it was to farm with all that up-to-date machinery.\"\n\nAround 1900 Dan bought 160 acres near what is now Gould, OK. According to a daughter-in-law, Mrs. Otis Francis Culpepper, the family moved from Texas to Oklahoma in March of 1900 and lived there until Dan's death in 1910. Mrs. Culpepper continued in a 24 Sep 1978 letter: After his marriage, he was a farmer but not a rancher, as he only had 160 acres of land and that was not enough for a ranch as there was no open range here as late as 1900 when he came to Oklahoma.\n\nMrs. Otis Francis Culpepper wrote in a 16 Oct 1978 letter: This area [Gould, OK] became Oklahoma officially in 1896 after which people could \"file\" on land and after 5 years residence & certain improvements were made on the land, could own 160 A[cres] of land for a little more than $14.00 the cost of the court proceedings proving they had fulfilled their part of the contract. By late 1897 when my Grandfather Fancher came here, almost all the land had been claimed.... Grandfather [Francis Daniel] Culpepper had to buy someone's \"claim\" to the land by 1900, but I don't know who he bought out.... Grandfather had a two roomed house, a half dugout that joined it (it had two rooms, I think) and a cellar that was entered from the half dugout. Both the families [Dan's and his brother Tom's] lived in this one household for about a year or year and a half, but were not there when Grandfather died.\n\nMrs. B. J. (Kathye Culpepper) Garrett wrote, in a 15 Aug 1978 letter, that \"Dan Culpepper and all of his children are or were members of the church of Christ (not to be confused with the National Council of Churches of Christ).\" In a 18 Jun 1979 letter Kathye added that Charlie Carroll \"was a roving cowboy before he married, he and Granddad [Francis Daniel Culpepper] were good friends. He was with Granddad when he died. My dad [William Lewis Culpepper] lived with the Carrolls until he joined the Army. One of the Carroll daughters lives in Wilmington, TX....\" Biography* Lewis P. Culpepper recorded his son's birth in the Family Bible: \"Thomas Jefferson was born Sept the 1st 1861.\" The obituary states that he was born in Anniston, AL but his parents were recorded in the 1860 census in Raldolph Co., AL and are not known to have been associated with any place in Houston County. It is possible that the reference to Anniston, Houston Co, AL was an attempt to identify the largest metropolitan area near where Thomas Jefferson Culpepper was born. According to a 1976 article about his daughter, Mrs. S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper) Crossmann, in the Pampa News, Mary is quoted as saying that while the family lived at Gibsonville near Ashland, Clay Co., AL, Thomas built \"the most beautiful, spacious five-room log house with pine trees and magnolias in the back yard.\" After the family moved to Texas, Thomas talked about the house so much that one of his daughters, Exa, went back to see it after she was grown. \"It was lovely,\" she said. In a 26 Jul 1978 letter, a daughter Mrs. J. M. (Iva Culpepper) Cline, wrote that when they visited the Ashland, AL area in 1919 \"our mother's sister lived on the old farm where all the children were born....\"\n\nIn the early 1900's Thomas and family moved to Sabine Parish, LA, and Thomas's wife died there in 1905. Mrs. Otis Francis Culpepper wrote in a 16 Oct 1978 letter: Uncle Tom's folks came here about 1908, after the death of Uncle Tom's wife. Grandfather [Francis Daniel Culpepper] sent word for them to come and stay till Uncle Tom's health improved.\n\nMrs. W. A. (Mary Ellen Culpepper) Boyette told her daughter, Mrs. R L (Rita Boyett) Holland, in a 25 Jul 1978 letter, that she remembered her Uncle Tom and his six children moving in with her father, Dan Culpepper and his family, in Shrewder, OK after the death of Tom's wife. Tom and his family stayed with his brother Dan for two years. Thomas's daughter, Mrs. S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper) Crossman, said Dan used to tell stories about his cowboy days, and as a small child she thought he was some kind of hero.\n\nAccording to Mrs. S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper) Crossman, in a 16 Aug 1978 letter, her father, Thomas, was \"a quiet and reserved man, very devoted to his family. He had no hobbies but making we children 'walk the straight and narrow.' Ha! He was so strict with us, but so good to us. And provided for us, we never wanted for anything when we were at home.\"\n\nThomas moved to Amarillo in 1908, and stayed there until 1921. According to an article about his daughter, Mrs. S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper) Crossman, in the 29 Feb 1976 Pampa News the family \"moved to Pampa in 1921 at a time when there were no paved streets and the sidewalks were made of wood.... Mrs. [S. B. (Mary Exa Culpepper)] Crossman's father went into business -- a candy factory and a confectionery.\" Exa wrote in a 20 Jul 1978 letter that \"our candy store was called 'Pampa Confectionery.'\" Exa worked there until she married in 1923. At some point Thomas sold the store and moved back to Amarillo. At the time of his retirement he was working for General Mills in Amarillo.\n\nThe following funeral notice is from an unknown source: T. J. Culpepper Services Today Services honoring the memory of Thomas J. Culpepper, 93, were scheduled to be held at 4 P.M. today in Griggs Pioneer Chapel with the Rev. W.T. Newsome, Jr., Assistant Pastor of the First Baptist Church, officiating. Named as Pallbearers were Dudley Grantham, Harold Swofford, Arch Rogers, Ed Allen, J.O. Lewis, and Glen Armstrong, and burial was to be held in Llano Cemetery. Mr. Culpepper died yesterday at 5:30 A.M. at his home, 1104 Lincoln. He had been a resident of Amarillo since 1908 and was a retired employee of General Mills here. He was born Sept. 1, 1861, in [Raldolph Co., AL near] Anniston, Ala. Surviving are two sons, T.A. Culpepper, Amarillo, and L. Culpepper, Hereford; four daughters, Mrs. S.W. Ginnings, and Mrs. Iva Cline, both of Amarillo, Mrs. Hattie Smith, Lockney, and Mrs. Spence Crossman, Pampa; nine grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. Biography*Lewis P. Culpepper recorded his daughter's birth in his Bible: \"Elmira was born Oct the 12th 1866.\" She was known as \"Mira.\" The 1910 census (ED 14, Sheet 6, Pct 1, #117) of Hickory Flat, Chambers Co., AL records the information that Elmira was 44 years old and she and R. R. Rutland had been married for 23 years and she had had 6 children, three of whom were still living in 1910. Only five of these children have been accounted for at this time. Elmira's father, Lewis P. Culpepper, was also staying with the family. The following is from a 17 Jun 1979 letter from Mrs. Melvin (Essie Bryant) Moore, Mira's granddaughter: Grannie lived with my mother [Mrs. E. L. (Dennie Rutland) Bryant] and father [Earnest Bryant] from the time they were married until her death. She spent her life doing things for us. I never knew her to go any place other than to Aunt Mollie's and to her son's and daughter's homes except to the movies. My father worked at a theater for a time and we were invited by the owner to come as often as we wanted to. Grannie enjoyed going very much. She was an excellent seamstress and cook. She took pleasure in putting finishing touches on our clothes and making our favorite dishes. I suppose that she knew how to do just about everything around a home. I remember that she would build a fine chicken coop, make soap, repair the sewing machine, and fix the clock. She was totally unselfish. I shall never forget one thing that she did for me. During the depression, I outgrew my winter coat. I had a good distance to walk to school and this particular winter was very severe. With no hesitation, she got her coat out and began to work. She cut her coat up and made one to fit me! Grannie was very unpretentious. From the time I first remember her until her death (about 26 years) she never changed the way she dressed. All of her dresses were made very plain with long sleeves and reached to her ankles. She always wore an apron when she was at home. She wore a very plain black hat a few times, but usually she wore a bonnet. When Grannie returned from a visit to Aunt Mollie's [Mira's sister, Mary E. Culpepper Rutland] or to her daughter Hassie's, my sister and I had great fun unpacking her bag. She always had little surprises for both of us tucked in among her clothes. I wish that you could have known her. She was a great lady.\n\nThere is no record of Elmira's burial in State Line Cemetery in the 1990 edition of A Survey of Cemeteries in Chamber's County, Alabama. Mrs. Charles (Margaret Whatley) Lee wrote 26 Nov 1978 that Mira and her husband, R. R. Rutland didn't have any engraving on their stones. Biography*Margaret Joyce Culpepper was known as \"Maggie.\" Lewis P. Culpepper recorded her birth in his Bible: \"Margrett was born August the 16th 1875.\" Mrs. Charles (Margaret Whatley) Lee wrote 4 Jan 1979 that \"Maggie wasn't as tall [as her sister, Julia] and was a little plump.\" A niece, Mrs. J. H. (Margaret Phillips) Dodd, wrote in a 21 Aug 1978 letter that \"Aunt Maggie was a wonder also. She couldn't stand defeat. If something didn't work one way she tried another until it did work.\" Mrs. Dodd continued in a 20 Dec 1978 letter: They [Maggie & Bob Trimble] were a very happy couple and we loved them very much. When I was small and visited them, Aunt Maggie always made me a dress or two from some scraps left over from some of hers. I was so little it only took about two pieces the size of a fig leaf to make me a dress. She always put ruffles and lace on them and I felt the most dressed up kid in Camp Hill.\n\nMargaret remained young all of her life. She used to look after an \"old lady\" who was much younger than she was. When she was close to ninety she was still climbing up on her roof to clean leaves out of the gutter! Lena Amsler wrote in a 29 Jun 1978 letter about visiting Mrs. G. R. (Margaret Culpepper) Trimble: Aunt Maggie... was 92 then and her neighbor found her for us - when we didn't get a response to our knock on the door - under the house hunting a hen nest or something. She showed us all of her handiwork - bedspreads, pillows, etc. - as well as her carpentry work in the kitchen - I guess she could do anything.\n\nMaggie wrote the following letter apparently to her niece, Mary Erom Griffin: ______________________________Camp Hill Ala ______________________________Dec 17th [1949] Dear Erom I am sory to have kept you waiting but Lewis Phillips gave me a free trip to Fla through the country and of course I couldn't refuse as he was alone and I could be some company for him, were gone eleven days. I tolde the Poste mistress to forward all letters but no papers, but she didn't forward any thing so you letter came while I was gone. so I have only been back a few days and had some Christmas packages that had a long way to go and I had to get them off to arive by Christmas and several more I have to make and I am afraid they will be to late for Santa Claus. I was glad to hear from you and I know you are busy if you are keeping House and teaching too. I wish I could mak every thing plane and understanding about what little infermation I know I didn't memtion my Father's second marriage because I had no idea it would have anything to do with your getting into the Club as she was no relation to you, wrote in my other letter what the name of your Grand Mother Griffins mother was, but I will starte back at the begining and do my best to be understood. My grand Fathers name was John, he married a Galispy but I have forgotton what Father said her Christian name was, but the Galispys came from Irorland and settled in SC My Father was the youngest childe of the Family, he was born in Edgefield SC Aug the 25 1816, his Father and Mother moved to Monrow County Gorgia when he was 7 years olde, I do not know how many of their children came to Georgia with them. December the 12, 1839 he married Sara Ann Culpepper. Father said they were fourth cousins, her Father was called Dick Culpepper, that probably was a nick name, I have known people named Richard and nick named Dick. I don't remember ever hearing Father say what Dick Culpepper's wife's name was. Father and his first wife had five children, namely Joseph, Ann, Elzziebeth, Mattie, and Clarassa, your grand mother their mother died March 29th 1857. December 2nd 1858 Father married Margaret Batemon, my mother. She had 8 children, she died the 29 of January 1896. Oh I forgot to say your grand mother Griffins mother was burried in Georgia but I don't know where. My Father and Mother and all his first children and my 2 oldest brothers moved to Alabama about 1862 and I think they lived somewhere Close to Louina, now called Wadley when your grand Father and Mother Griffin married, I just remember hearing the older brothers and Sisters talk abought what happened at the places they lived and remembered hearing Mother say where her children were borned. My Father died june the 5th 1915 and was burried by my Mother at State Line Church in the North East Corner of Chambers County Alabama, less than a 1/2 mile from the line between Ala and Gorgia and 1 1/2 miles from the Line between Chambers and Randolph Co. Now about Father's Brothers, I went to visit your grand Mother Griffin in 1912 and Father was there visiting her and came back home with me and we stoped over in Wadley for Sunday and sunday night and monday morning in the Depot while waiting for our Train a man came up to Father and asked him if he had a brother named Joel, and said he was a great grand son of Joel Culpepper his name was Landkaster, and Father said his oldest brother was named Joel, I don't remember where they said he lived and died, his next brother was named Frank and married Eglentine Langley and moved to Sweetwater Tex, they had 15 children, I corrasponded with one of his daughters a while, and he died and she sent me a paper with a write up of his deth, and somehow I lost the paper but I remember he died either 1904 or 1905 he was 99 years 10 Months and 23 days olde, and his children, grand and great grand children and the inlaws nonbered 300 and 18, I am not so sure about the 18 but over 300 and some where in the teans. his next brother was Washington and lived in Meriwether County, Ga, that may not be the correct way to spell that county but you know by my letters that I am not a good Speller, I dont remember the name of the Town and dont rember when he died but he was over 98. I was a little childe, he allso had a brother named John that lived some where in Ga died when 60, his brother William lived at Louina, I saw him twice, he was passed 98 when he died he had a Sister that lived at Louina her name was Sarah. she married an Elliett she was about 99 when she died, the other sister was Betsie and married Wesley Dean & supose the Joseph O Dean must be one of her great grand sons that is all I remember about the family, except my Sister of Waverly Florida and myself is all our family that I know is living. brother Thomas was living last year but I have not heard from him this year. he lives in Amarilla Tex, and is 88 years olde.

Biography* Charles W. Culpepper's birth was recorded in the Family Bible of his sister, Mrs. I. W. (Sarah A. B. Culpepper) Sims: _________________________Charles W. Culpepper Born _________________________16. July, 1824\n\nAccording to census records and his Civil War pension application, Charles William was born in South Carolina. A granddaughter, Mrs. W. B. (M. Louise Culpepper) Broach, wrote in a 27 Sep 1978 letter that he was born in Lexington District, SC. Although Charles William's parents have not been located in the 1820 census records, his grandmother, the widowed Barbara (Derrick) Corley was recorded in 1820 census in Lexington District, SC.\n\nAccording to his Civil War pension application, Charles William had resided in Georgia since 2 Dec 1830. However census records for his sister, Sarah, who was born in 1826 and his brother, James, who was born in 1829 indicate that they were both born in Georgia and the Charles' parents probably moved the family to Georgia around 1825. Also, Charles William was noted as one of 2 males 5-10 years of age, living with his parents in the 1830 census of Crawford Co., GA. Although family members have not been located in the 1840 census, they apparently remained in Crawford Co., GA until Dec 1839 when Joel Culpepper died.\n\nCharles William is next noted in Monroe Co., GA marrying Mary Jane English in 1848. In the 1850 census, Charles William emerged as a head of household living near his widowed mother. He was listed as a boot and shoemaker; however, in the 1860 census Charles William was listed as a farmer with real estate valued at $2,000 and personal property valued at $5,100.\n\nAccording to Charles W. Culpepper's Civil War pension application, in 1861, in Newnan, Coweta Co., GA, he enlisted in the Confederate Army in Co. H 4th Georgia Regiment. It is interesting to note that Charles William who was listed as a boot and shoemaker in the 1850 census was detailed to make harnesses and shoes for his company in the winter of 1864.\n\nAfter the War, Charles returned home and \"Charles W. Culpeper\" [sic] was recorded with his wife and younger children in the 1870 census of the Calhoun P. O. district of Gordon Co., GA. He had real estate valued at $1,200 and personal property valued at $1,000. Charles was noted with his wife and younger children in the 1880 census of Gordon Co., GA. And, shortly before his death, he was recorded with his wife and two daughters, living with his son, Joel Culpepper, in the 1900 census of Gordon Co., GA.\n\nJames Burie Clegg wrote 16 Nov 1978 that he had spoken to Judge Harbin King who said that \"Charles William had a good sized plantation in the West Union Church vicinity....\" In a 22 Nov 1978 letter James Burie Clegg wrote of a visit to the land: The foreman of the plantation drove me around the entire estate, unlocking gates, etc. and showing me the cabin in which C. W. first lived (it has been added to and serves as a retreat beside a large beautiful lake). This foreman said one of the Culpeppers gave at least three tracts of land - one a hundred acres - to negroes who had worked for them over the years. A big prosperous Negro community is now in that area.\n\nIn a 30 Jan 1979 letter, James Burie Clegg enclosed a clipping from \"today's\" Calhoun Times which mentioned Roland Hayes who was \"a famous Negro tenor who came from the Curryville community right close to the C. W. Culpepper plantation. One of the Culpeppers, either C. W., the original plantation owner (4000 acres) or C. E. the grandson and millionaire, gave three or four tracts of land to some blacks who worked for them. One tract was of 100 acres.\" Roland Hayes, world famous tenor sang to an audience of over 4,000 people in Atlanta last week, and then came to Curryville to spend the weekend with his brother.\n\nJames Burie Clegg added that there is \"a Roland Hayes Memorial by the road just before you get to the West Union Church.\"\n\nThe following is from a Sep 27 1978 letter from Mrs. W. B. (M. Louise Culpepper) Broach: Charles Wm. Culpepper, my grand father was born July 16, 1824 in Lexington [District] S.C. He died June 8, 1900 and is buried in a country church yard in (West Union) Gordon County [GA]. They were living (he and his wife Mary Jane English) ...in Haralson in Coweta, Co. Ga. when he decided to go to Texas [circa 1869]. I do not know how he found the place in N.W. Ga on John's Creek between two mountain ranges [the boundary between Floyd and Gordon counties]. It was beautiful country - he bought a house and several hundred acres of farmland. It was well watered and he was a master farmer. He did well with his mill and gin on the creek in sight of the house, too. He fought in the War between the states in Gen. Joe Wheeler's Cavalry [Company H, 4th GA Infantry, CSA]. When the family moved from Haralson, his oldest daughter Annira (called Anna) stayed and married a young man named Willie Gay. ...they [Charles William Culpepper and Mary Jane English] had nine other children in all. A happier bunch of people you never saw. They had a close family spirit and enjoyed each other. They had lots of company too -- he [Charles William] was said to have an attractive personality that drew all to him, especially young people. He would let them have their square dances at his house and they had lots of fun.... My grand father was not a church man until middle age when Sam Jones, a local evangelist, came into the neighborhood and had a great influence on him. He became a Methodist and helped build a church in his neighborhood he gave the land and he and the children at home became members of that church, and all continued to be good Methodists as long as they lived.... They [the Culpepper's] were good looking - they were of medium height, some a little portly, but they all had fine-pored white skin and a peculiar blue eye. The eyes were a light blue, and sharp - very distinctive and were always called the \"Culpepper eyes\" by all who knew them. Most of them had black hair. I never heard from whence they inherited these features. They were all what used to be called \"jolly\" and full of fun.\n\nIn a Nov 5, 1978 letter, Mrs. Broach wrote that after the Civil War Charles William suffered from an illness that left him an invalid and unable to work the family farm. In a 5 Nov 1978 letter, Mrs. W. B. (M. Louise Culpepper) Broach, wrote about Charles William's son, Rev. Elam Culpepper: His house was a two-storied frame house with many porches [on land he bought next to his father's farm in Gordon County, almost in sight of his father's old home place. Both of these homes have since burned to the ground in separate fires.] and by the time I was 12 years old, Cousin Charles [Emory Culpepper] had had all those porches glassed in, had put in central heat and electric lights (way before Rural Electrification). My uncle was retired from city churches and just preached around in the country as invited. He was not a big, robust man and he was running his father's old mill on the creek. Cousin Charlie had the latest mill machinery installed for him and he enjoyed grinding corn for his neighbors as long as he lived....\n\nJames Burie Clegg wrote 22 Nov 1978 that he tried to take a picture of the foundation of the old mill on the creek and added \"I couldn't get near enough to it, as I had to take it from a bridge (built by the Culpeppers) about 40 yards away.\"\n\nThe following is from a manuscript by Kathyrn English Culpepper, as transcribed by Gayle L. Poole:\n\nSome Interesting Facts about Charles William\n\nDuring the War Between The States (Civil War) he served in Wheeler's Calvary. He rode his favorite horse, named \"Flying Jenny\". She was fast as lightning and took him through the war without a scratch (he was in many tight places, but Jenny always took\n\nhim to safety) and brought him home at the end.\n\nCharles was a Master Farmer, loved and respected by all who knew him, and loved to visit him. Young men were drawn to him on Sunday afternoons to hear his amusing stories and funny jokes.\n\nHe had a very large house and the two front rooms had a door between them and he allowed the young people to have dances there. The fiddlers could sit in the doorway and accommodate a set in each room. Sally Bit, his nickname for Sarah Elizabeth was a very graceful dancer. 'Tis said she could dance with a glass of water and never spill a drop.\n\nYears later a contemporary of his children to this granddaughter that when they drove up to the house and hitched their horses, they could hear the fiddler tuning up, and did not bother to find the gate, they just jumped the fence in their haste to get inside for the first set.\n\nCharles William donated a piece of ground for a small Methodist Church called \"Johnson's Chapel\". The Johnson family lived only a few hundred yards from the church and were very active members. Their home was on a rise above where there were, at least, a hundred springs. These springs are the headwaters of the Johnson Spring Branch which flows through the Culpepper property, and into John's Creek. On the bank of John's Creek Charles built a dam, and a mill to grind corn and wheat. Also a tannery, and a cotton gin. Farmers from all around came to use these facilities. (Years later W. B. Broach, husband of Louise, the daughter of William Henry, bought up the Culpepper and made two large lakes from this Johnson's Springs Branch. He had a cottage on one of these lakes, where his family spent summers and holidays, and entertained their friends with hunting, fishing, swimming and boating, He also raised cattle),\n\nCharles William lost his health one cold night in January, all his mills burned to the ground. One of his neighbors who was operating the bucket brigade from the creek, noticed that Culpepper, on coming out of one of the burning buildings was ready to burst into flames, and dashed a bucket of icy creek water over him. He took pneumonia and was never able to work again."
