        "text": "These extremely rare motion pictures are two of the earliest versions of Robert Lewis Stevenson's immortal classic about the doctor who tampers with good and evil and reaps disaster.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920, B&W, Silent): This 1920 Pioneer Film Corporation production is the third screen version of \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" and stars Philadelphia native Sheldon Lewis, and was directed by J. Charles Haydon. Noted for playing villains, Lewis appeared as the scoundrel Frochard in D.W. Griffith's Orphans Of The Storm (1922) and had prominent roles in Seven Footprints To Satan and Tarzan The Tiger, both released in 1929. This rendition of the Stevenson classic boasts a high moral tone (Dr. Jekyll does a great deal of charity work with poor children) and a surprise happy ending."
