        "text": "Edmund Donald Two-Rivers Broeffle was born on June 29, 1945 to Nancy Johnson Broeffle. They lived with relatives on the 55,000-square.mile Anishinaabemowin-speaking Ojibwe treaty lands of the Canadian Seine River Reserve in Sapawe, Ontario. He and his siblings grew up guided by their Grandmother Minnie and uncle Robert Johnson. He was raised with traditional activities such as hunting, wild berry-picking and fishing, always surrounded by pine and birch trees; these memories provided him with some comfort while he spent three years in an Ontario reform school. A glimpse into his adolescent adventures learning to communicate with horses and people occurs in the story, “The Horse Barn and Little Lady Jane,” one of 22 short stories in his 1998 book Survivor’s Medicine, published by the University of Oklahoma Press.\n\nA more romantic characterization of his childhood is celebrated in his poem “Indian Land Dancing,” first published in 2003 and later publicly incorporated posthumously as part of an exceptional mural of the same name created by the Chicago Public Art Group in 2009. The poem is located on the south wall at the Foster Avenue and Marine Drive entrance and exit.\n\nIn the summer 1961, shortly after turning 16, Two-Rivers traveled nearly 750 miles south from Ontario to live with his older sister in an apartment in Chicago’s economically hard-pressed Uptown area. Since the 1950s, many Native Americans had been encouraged, with Bureau of Indian Affairs assistance, to relocate from rural areas; unfortunately, many became the new urban poor. For many years, Uptown was the population epicenter for American Indians, as well as a port-of-entry for poor whites from southern states and the Appalachians.\n\nTwo-Rivers, like many teens, was influenced by the non-conformance times of the rock n’ roll hitch-hiking youth culture of the 1960s; and he was curious to explore the U.S.A. and Mexico. I don’t know if he had read On the Road, by Beatnik rebel writer Jack Kerouac, but Two-Rivers took his own journeys. He traveled to parts of the Midwest, the West Coast and southern border during the dawn of the drug-experimenting Hippie movement.\n\nUpon his return to Chicago, Two-Rivers found factory work near Southeast Side Archer Avenue. He relied on Chicago public transportation to take him from the North Side to work. This fortunately allowed him to study the bus and train passengers and observe close up Chicago’s ethnic neighborhoods. Many of these images are reflected in the dialogue of his plays, fiction and poetry.\n\nTrying to survive by his wits, he committed a series of armed robberies and was caught and jailed. Decades later, after becoming an established writer, I asked him why he committed those stick-ups. He candidly said, “It was easy, too easy. I’d just show my pistol and like a magnet, the wallets would appear at my feet. I got addicted to the adrenaline rush, and I did it one too many times and was busted.”\n\nHe was sentenced to Cook County Jail where he met Paul Crump, a convicted murderer of a security guard. Crump became a celebrity after he wrote a novel, Burn, Killer, Burn! Two-Rivers learned that Nelson Algren had been an influence on Crump’s desire to write, which sparked him to read Algren’s tales of the “lumpen proletariat street hustlers, day laborers, prostitutes.” Such characters appear in Two-Rivers’s drama collection, Briefcase Warriors, also published by the University of Oklahoma Press.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Two-Rivers was nearly 26 and became active in grassroot actions, such as the June 14, 1971 move by members of a Mike Chosa-led group called the Chicago Indian Village that wanted to reclaim land for Native Americans. One of their locations was an abandoned U.S. missile silo situated at Belmont Harbor. This was, in fact, federal land. Many believed Mayor Daley’s repressive cops could not openly move against Indigenous people on federal property. This symbolic action lasted about a month before the activists were evicted. Two-Rivers was inspired by and supported such acts of resistance. It would be 20 years before Two-Rivers and I discussed our mutual connections to that event and other indigenous protests, such as the 1973 Wounded Knee confrontation, the arrest and railroading of AIM activists such as Leonard Peltier, the Wisconsin fishing rights struggle, and protests in the 1980s against Peabody Coal company’s violations of Navaho and Hopi water rights at Black Mesa.\n\nOne clear example of Two-Rivers’s activism is found in the rare 1994 poetry anthology SKINS: Drum Beats from City Streets, which he co-edited with professor of anthropology Terry Straus. This was a ground-breaking book of 20 American Indian poets with a Chicago connection, some of which have continued to write and publish, like Mark LaRoque and Mark Turcotte. The anthology’s lead poem, by Two-Rivers, is entitled “Warrior 1975.” The poem’s protagonist is armed with a rifle and headed to Wisconsin’s Menominee area for impending battle against an unnamed enemy.\n\nTwo-Rivers, like many Chicago Indians in the 1990s, found the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign football team’s icon, Chief Illiniwek, an exploitive insult to real American Indians. Two-Rivers joined other Chicago Indians and allies in publicly protesting the university’s profitable stereotyping and mockery of a “dignified Indian chief.” In his 2003 collection Fat Cats, Pow Wows, and Other Indian Tales, the poem “Not on The Guest List” is dedicated to Dennis Banks of AIM, who denounced the Illinois governor and others who would promote “Chief Illiniwek” and ignore the voices of non-whites.\n\nOne individual that caught Two-River’s attention in the 1980s was Carlos Cortez Koyokuikatl, who coincidentally is also a recent Chicago Literary Hall of Fame inductee. Cortez was an anti-war, pro-labor union activist who made it publicly known that he supported all indigenous acts of resistance against Northern and Southern colonialist governments. Two-Rivers was impressed with Cortez as an accomplished artist, poet, and a columnist for the monthly Industrial Worker newspaper. He appreciated Cortez’s abilities to communicate a positive message for oppressed people despite also having been a former prisoner. Not long after meeting Cortez, Two-Rivers began to write a monthly column for the Lerner Newspaper about life in culturally diverse Albany Park. He also occasionally wrote about art and poetry events that he attended across Chicago, which during the late 1980s through the late 1990s were held at public libraries, coffee houses, bars, bookstores, community centers, and even in parks.\n\nIn the fall of 1977, at Truman College on Wilson Avenue, a Chicano and American Indian month-long collaborative of Chicago Indian Artist Guild and Movimiento Artistico Chicano members was launched. This event offered films, scholarly talks, music and an art exhibition featuring photography, sculpture, and paintings. The event, called Anishinaabe Waki Aztlan, drew serious attention to our talents. Two-Rivers became friends with Chicago Indian Artist Guild founder, visual artist and emerging Comanche poet Lonnie Poco in 1985; Poco’s own poetry collection Beside the Wichita had been edited by Laguna Pueblo native William Oandason and published by MARCH/Abrazo Press. After seeing Poco’s attractive chapbook, he began writing a manuscript so he could publish his own first book.\n\nIn spring of 1991, Two-Rivers, Lonnie Poco and I read poetry for the EARTH DAY observance at the North Park Nature Center off Pulaski. This marked our first poetry readings together; Two-Rivers was in his full-voice with no microphone, giving glory in front of a beautiful tepee. Six months later, I received a phone call from Two-Rivers saying he was really interested in having a chapbook of 12 poems and he wanted to add an open letter concerning his tribe’s treaty rights. He asked it to be called A Dozen Cold Ones. I liked his proposal but of course wanted to read his manuscript. It didn’t matter to me that he had not been published in academic or established magazines or journals. I trusted he would have a good collection because I had listened to his poetry and knew he was talented.\n\nThe first 500 copies of A Dozen Cold Ones were printed at Creative Edge Printing on Southport Avenue in early 1992. His book release took place at the Green Mill. Yes, Two-Rivers electrified the audience and sold nearly 100 copies at five bucks each. His first printing sold out by year’s end and MARCH/Abrazo Press did a second run of 500 in 1993. This motivated him to reach out across the country for readings, because he knew if people could hear and see him read his poems they would buy his book.\n\nHis poetry’s success was helped by people in the American Indian community and he acknowledged people like Martin Yellow-Bank, Dee Logan, Carlos Peynetsa, Beverly Moser, Dorene Wiese, Julia Hattory, Diane Glancy, Kimberly Blaeser and allies to the cause of American Indian literature such as LaVonne Brown Ruoff, Dave Gecic, Cynthia Gallaher, C.J. Laity, Marc Smith, Michael Warr and many others who assisted him in reaching his goal of becoming a public writer of poetry and fiction, as well as a playwright and event organizer.\n\nTwo-Rivers was able to become a role model as an instructor for creative writing series that Northeastern Illinois University had created called “Writing from The Source,” allowing him to lead writing workshops for young people in various Chicago Public School classrooms.\n\nIn Chicago, Two-Rivers found his indigenous associations and close friends at the Chicago American Indian Center and had developed a collaborative series of readings. He worked with poets Mark LaRoque, Jeanne LaTraille, Lonnie Poco, Julia Hattory, and Martin Yellowbank on a number of issues.\n\nI would be neglectful if I failed to mention Two-Rivers worked as one of the directors of the Red Path Theatre Company, the only indigenous theatre company in Illinois, which flourished with help from Chicago’s Victory Gardens Theater and the Theater Department of Truman College.\n\nIn 1995, Two-Rivers reached out to the good people at the Newberry Library’s D’Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian History in developing an annual successful program of music, performance and spoken words entitled, “Winter: A Time of Telling.” For 11 years, Two-Rivers played a key role as advisor or direct participant in its annual presentations, even after moving to Green Bay, Wisconsin. His last Chicago appearance was on Thursday, February 2, 2006 at a “Winter: A Time of Telling” before returning to his home in Green Bay,\n\nWisconsin.\n\nCarlos Cumpián\n\nread less\n\nEunice Tietjens traveled the world and used her foreign experiences as material for poems, newspaper articles, essays, and prose. She expressed an attachment, even love, for a variety of places, including China and Japan. She was a major figure in the Chicago Literary Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, as an editor, journalist, poet, playwright, novelist and conduit between writers at home and around the world. Tietjens published four collections of poetry—Profiles from China: Sketches in Free Verse of People and Things Seen in the Interior (1917), Body and Raiment (1919), Leaves in Windy Weather (1929), and China (1930). Her children’s books included Boy of the South Seas (1931). She also published translations from French and Spanish, plays, the novel Jake (1921), and the memoir The World at My Shoulder (1938). She edited the anthology Poetry of the Orient: An Anthology of the Classic Secular Poetry of the Major Eastern Nations (1928). Tietjens’s work is featured in the anthology The Home Book of Modern Verse (1963).\n\nBut no matter how far Tietjens traveled or how long she stayed away, she always considered Chicago home. It was forever “her headquarters,” according to her proposal to launch a new, international magazine in 1931.\n\nTietjens was born in Chicago and schooled in Evanston until after her father’s death when she was 13. It was then that her lifelong fascination with other cultures began. Her mother, Idea, moved her family to Paris to reignite her dormant career as a painter. The Hammonds (that was Eunice’s maiden name) went to schools in Paris, Geneva, then Dresden. Under her mother’s influence, Tietjens absorbed the cultural landscape—she studied as a painter, became an opera aficionado, regularly attended the theatre, witnessed great artists like the dancer Isadora Duncan, and made her first attempts at writing poetry. She rejected the idea of college. Still a teenager, Eunice met and married the composer Paul Tietjens, but in her autobiography Tietjens characterizes the marriage as short and unsuccessful.\n\nEunice mothered two children with Paul Tietjens (she would later, with her second husband, give birth to a son). Her oldest daughter, named after Tietjens’s mother, died at the age of four. Shortly after Idea’s death, Tietjen and her younger daughter Janet moved to Evanston, where her mother had returned after years in Paris. She and Janet lived with her mother in a house next to the Charles G. Dawes mansion, on 225 Greenwood Street.\n\nNovelist Henry Kitchell Webster and his wife Mary adopted Tietjens as a friend. Webster, almost a decade older than Tietjens and already a commercially successful author, agreed to mentor Eunice as a creative writer. Tietjens’s mother took Janet to summer in Maine, and Eunice moved into a boarding house in Chicago. There, according to her autobiography, she wrote “diligently, mostly adventure stories, and weekends in Evanston Kitchell would offer critiques and encouragement, though he knew nothing of poetry.”\n\nTietjens was 27 when she had her “awakening.” Tietjens claims, in The World at My Shoulder, that she could pinpoint this spiritual revelation almost precisely. Margery Currey and Floyd Dell, then husband and wife, had invited Tietjens to a dinner party at their Rogers Park apartment. The party included George Cram Cook, then assistant to Dell on the Chicago Evening Post. After dinner, they “repaired” to Dell’s study. “For the talk ran on poetry,” Tietjens wrote. “For the first time in the many years of my long sleep I heard what had been like a secret vice with me brought out boldly into the open, with no apology, as though it were indeed one of the great facts of existence.” They read aloud Swinburne, Whitman, Middleton, Richard Hovey, Byron and Shelley. “Afterwards I walked home through the dark streets of Evanston. And I walked on air, like one warm with champagne, though I had had no alcohol except of the spirit. Poetry, I cried to myself, is not a dead thing, something that is shut in books to dress library shelves and is taught to school children, something to be given away at Christmas or bought shyly and read in one’s own room as one might take drugs, and never, never spoken of because nobody cares. Poetry is a living thing. I am not alone in the world today, nor am I touched by the sun. Poetry is alive. And I danced in the streets and sang to myself, thereby causing a most unpleasant person to speak to me. But from that evening some floodgate had broken in me and I was beginning to be awake.”\n\nTietjens regularly placed poems in the fledgling Poetry magazine, both before and after she joined the staff. Monroe and Alice Corbin Henderson included Tietjens’s poetry in their influential 1917 anthology The New Poetry. Tietjens joined the Poetry staff “as office girl and general nuisance about a year after the magazine started.” For a quarter century, Tietjens continued with the magazine, as business manager, assistant then associate editor, contributor, and advisor. She served as acting editor during Monroe’s absence in 1923, putting out issues from July through December, including a themed issue that contrasted established and emerging poets.\n\nAlmost from the start, Tietjens found a way to travel broadly while still holding down her position at the magazine. According to Jane Addams Hull-House Museum Director Liesl Olson, Tietjens came back from a 1914 trip through Asia “wearing Japanese-style dress and writing verse influenced by Japanese poetry.” In an April 15, 1915 letter from Coronado, Tietjens wrote, “Dear Lady Harriet…..I’m terribly homesick for Poetry and Chicago and you! When I had read the number I went to bed + cried my heart out out of sheer homesickness….a strange performance indeed for me. And I dreamed all night about you—you were walking through some distant fields of glory and I was afraid to go after you. How well I sympathize with Shakespeare!”\n\nIn 1917, Tiejens was hired as the Chicago Daily News’s only woman war correspondent in France. Olson, author of Modernism and the Ordinary, published an essay in the November 6, 2015 Poetry in which she notes that Tietjens was supposed to write stories for women, “but her articles were much broader; her vivid reports of American soldiers in the countryside, food shortages in Paris, air raids, and how French women endured the war reveal her ability to infiltrate a scene and provide intimate, nuanced details of daily life.”\n\nTiejens’s correspondence to Monroe (and also Henderson) was personal, but it was also purposeful. Tietjens regularly sent home poems collected during her travels, often introducing new, international writers to the magazine. She identified omissions in the magazine’s aesthetics as she helped to shape Poetry into a world-wide force. Those letters to Monroe give some insight into how much Chicago meant to Tietjens. They also demonstrate how Tietjens sustained her editorial career while still following her vagabond instincts. Tietjens wrote Monroe from all over the United States--from Pasadena, California; Pomona, New York; Burlington, Iowa; Coconut Grove, Florida; and many other spots. She sent off letters to Monroe from international destinations like Italy, Tunisia, and Tahiti. Her correspondence with Monroe, too, included return addresses all around Chicagoland, including Lake Forest, Glen Ellyn, and Evanston. In the early 20s, Tietjens wrote from 322 East Erie Street in Chicago, and later in the decade “Mrs. Cloyd Head” used a return address of 154 E. Pearson St., Chicago. By the early 1930s, she uses “2341 Commonwealth Ave. Chicago,” as her return address.\n\nWhile championing the work of countless writers around the world, Tietjens also advocated for her own work. Tietjens spent years beseeching Monroe to give her the lead spot in a Poetry issue. In a letter dated May 29, 1924, as Tietjens was working on Profiles from Home, she submitted ten poems with the note, “And will you remember that my only unfulfilled longing is to have the lead in “Poetry”?” Finally, in the January 1925 issue, she is the first poet listed. Seven of Tietjens poems were included in that issue, including the lead piece, “The Statue of Liberty,” which includes the line, “She is a gesture given us, a role to play.”\n\nAs a renown literary figure, Tietjens was in high demand as a lecturer. She produced a pamphlet indexing her lecture topics, such as “The New Movements in Poetry,”“The Women Poets of To-Day,”“Some Poets I Have Known,”“Japanese Contemporary Poetry,”“Japan of To-Day,” and “Some Aspects of Modern China.” The materials promoting Tietjens as “Poet and Lecturer” include a snippet of praise from the Chicago Daily News critic Henry Blackman Sell. The quote reads, “If I were asked which one of the younger American poets is best equipped to have and to hold a secure place in the hearts and affections of the great American public for the next twenty-five years I should unhesitatingly answer, Eunice Tietjens.” As was her natural instinct, Tietjens also arranged for other artists to lecture, including a collaborative effort with Maurice Browne to bring a series to Chicago Little Theatre.\n\nAt home, Tiejens played an instrumental role in building the vibrant literary community for which the Chicago Renaissance became known. She famously pawned her diamond engagement ring from Paul Tietjens to help fund Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap’s new magazine, Little Review. She was a core member and organizer of several professional writing groups, including The 30 Club, which boasted among its ranks authors Margaret Ayer Barnes, Llewellyn Jones, Susan Wilbur Jones, Janet Ayer Fairbanks, and Fanny Butcher. These efforts connected important writers of the city—from Sherwood Anderson to Arthur Meeker to Edgar Lee Masters to Carl Sandburg—and their interactions served as a catalyst or inspiration for her own work and that of others. She was close friends with all these Chicagoans and a large number of other important literary figures, such as Amy Lowell and Sara Teasdale. She also enjoyed deep relationships with important Chicagoans in drama, music, and other arts.\n\nTiejens left Poetry in 1938, upon her move to Europe and North Africa with her second husband, Cloyd Head. In a letter to Monroe, Tietjens declared, “‘Poetry’ is still my first and last love.”\n\nDonald G. Evans\n\nread less\n\nHamlin Garland’s story is a major challenge for anyone seeking to capture his life and times in anything less than a full-blown biography. This is in part because his life consists of many distinct phases corresponding to the numerous places he lived… for example, boyhood years in Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota before career years in Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. The irony here is an author known primarily for stories set in rural locations working from four of our country’s largest cities.\n\nHamlin Garland’s induction into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame brings a welcome focus to this essay. As an Iowa native, it’s a joy to know that Garland now joins Edna Ferber (2013) and Floyd Dell (2015), two younger contemporaries also with Iowa backgrounds. And it would undoubtedly amuse Garland to be inducted into the same Hall as his friend Henry Blake Fuller (2017). If afterlives include conversation, these two are now discussing how Fuller’s induction preceded Garland’s by several years.\n\nI have long contended most evaluations of Garland have overlooked the importance of his formative years in North Iowa, briefly in Burr Oak Township, Winneshiek County, 25 miles west of the Mississippi River, then eleven years in Burr Oak Township, Mitchell County, Iowa. I’m pleased this assessment seems to be changing, as more recent evaluations have noted Garland’s Mitchell County years, from age ten to twenty-one, which furnished the author with material he drew on throughout his distinguished career.\n\nYour Chicago focus now prompts my reevaluation of the time Garland spent living near Lake Michigan. It’s evident that Garland’s Chicago period was similarly vital to the author, both as a writer and as an individual. In the following paragraphs, I seek to explain and interpret the importance of his Chicago years.\n\nGarland moved from Boston to Chicago in 1893, motivated by both personal and professional reasons. Foremost, he sought to be closer to his aging parents, who he helped moved to West Salem, Wisconsin, a community he could reach via an overnight train from Chicago. Garland was also responding to the distinct professional lure of Chicago. At the conclusion of the Columbian Exposition, there was a fresh dynamism in the city, a stimulating atmosphere, a readiness for the next century, which Garland hoped to play a part in.\n\nGarland arrived in Chicago in his early 30s, a time of increased recognition as an author demonstrating considerable promise. He was soon invited to give a “salon lecture” at the home of a socially prominent hostess, where he spoke on the topic of “Impressionism in Art,” a movement then emerging in the U.S. art world. Garland had already done a deep dive on this particular topic while still living in Boston.\n\nThis gathering was a milepost in Garland’s life, for at the conclusion of his remarks, an attendee approached and introduced himself. Lorado Taft was primarily a sculptor but lectured broadly on the arts to groups like the one assembled that evening. Taft was eager to connect with Garland… and vice versa. Nurtured by their mutual admiration, this vital friendship would endure for four decades, until 1936, when Taft died. Importantly, before the turn of the century, in 1899, Garland would marry Lorado Taft’s sister, Zulime.\n\nWriting is generally a lonely profession. Perhaps as an outgrowth of his solitary work, Garland sought camaraderie when he wasn’t placing words on paper. He enjoyed Taft’s companionship and gravitated to Taft’s studio late afternoons. Before long, others joined them, finding a sense of community among like-minded individuals. One of those often stopping by was Henry B. Fuller, then a writer of novels set in Europe. Over the years, Fuller and Garland formed an enduring friendship important to both men, which, like Garland’s relationship with Taft, lasted until Fuller’s passing in 1929.\n\nShortly after they began spending time together, Garland, Taft, and Fuller formed an organization they called The Little Room. Ostensibly, the group’s purpose was to provide a setting where artists, writers, and intellectuals could socialize, formalizing what these men once found in Taft’s studio. In addition to the three mentioned, members included social reformer Jane Addams, painter Ralph Clarkson, publisher Ralph Fletcher Seymour, poet Harriet Monroe, plus various painters, sculptors, writers, musicians, architects, and others engaged primarily in arts-related professions.\n\nLittle Room records from the early 1900s include an emerging proposal to form a separate entity, a men’s organization, initially called The Attic Club, a step that took place in 1907. Two years later, this start-up entity assumed a new name: The Cliff Dwellers Club. More than any other single individual, Hamlin Garland is regarded as the Cliff Dwellers’ founder.\n\nBefore traveling further down the path of Garland’s Chicago activities, it’s important to note an entity that came together among largely this same group seeking an escape from city life. In its early days, the Little Room met in different sculptors’ spaces before eventually making a home in artist Ralph Clarkson’s studio, which accommodated these gatherings for three decades. In addition to their regular gathering time, the group would assemble periodically on Saturday afternoons for a potluck “camp supper.”\n\nStriving to sustain this atmosphere, members soon embarked on an effort to find a permanent campground, in this instance, at a location one-hundred miles west of the city. In the late ’90s, efforts to take The Little Room out into the country led to formation of Eagle’s Nest Camp near Oregon, Illinois. Unlike the Cliff Dwellers, where Garland is prime founder and Taft, a founding member, at Eagle’s Nest, Taft is principal founder and Garland, a founding member.\n\nIn addition to Taft and Garland, camp charter members included attorney Wallace Heckman, the property owner, artists Ralph Clarkson, Oliver Dennett Grover, and Charles Francis Browne, authors Henry B. Fuller and Horace Spencer Fiske, editor James Spencer Dickerson, architects Allan B. and Irving K. Pond, and composer/organist Clarence Dickinson – trustees dedicated to the pursuit “of the fine arts, literature, and the professions.” Members were responsible for at least two lectures a year, either on the property or in the nearby community, an intentional effort to promote art education. In its early years, camp was an accurate description… basically, city dwellers “roughing it.”\n\nInitially, camp staff consisted of Taft’s sister, Zulime, responsible for managing the site and tending to meals and supplies. Zulime assumed this role having served in a similar capacity at her brother’s studio. She had studied in Europe and was hopeful of becoming an artist, something her brother sought to advance among the talented females affiliated with his studio. At camp, Zulime was soon taking long after-dinner walks with Hamlin Garland, ten years her senior. Garland tells of their courtship in Daughter of the Middle Border, the book that earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1922.\n\nWhile devoting a portion of his energies to courting and clubbing, Hamlin Garland was also at work on a novel during his early Chicago years, one partially set in the city, the outline of which began in Boston prior to his arrival. Most critics regard Rose of Dutcher’s Coolly, published in 1895, as Garland’s finest novel, his best work rooted in his Chicago period. It’s evident that Garland draws on his own background for his lead character, both in her early years on a small Wisconsin farm near the Mississippi River and in the life she experienced in Chicago.-\n\nOne reason for the book’s quality is time and effort Garland devoted to it. Initially envisioned in 1890 as a short story, the story quickly outgrew its format. Garland wanted what became a full-length novel to carry many of the themes he had advanced throughout his early career: the challenge of being rooted in country life while seeking to thrive in the big city; the ability to tap one’s background for artistic purposes; the opportunity to be measured on the basis of talent rather than gender or station in life.\n\nIn titling his books, Garland frequently employed the word “roads” or “trails” descriptive of his characters’ journeys. Accordingly, it’s appropriate to borrow his term “trail-maker” to encompass the many times the author was either first or very early on what would eventually become a well-travelled thoroughfare. Some of Garland’s trailblazing pertains to his literary endeavors; some reflects the broad scope of his interests.\n\nHaving mentioned Rose, Garland was not the first male to write a novel from a female’s perspective. But as critics observed, by making his central character a woman, he demonstrated an ability to stretch himself, not only describing Rose’s intellectual growth but also her sexual awakening, something appearing very rarely in literature prior to 1895.\n\nFour years before Rose, Main-Travelled Roads made Garland an informal spokesperson for 19th century agrarian society. While other writers brought a rural background to their works, Garland was the first author to capture the hardships, the disappointments, and the isolation of farm life. As one literary historian noted, before Garland, stories about the frontier were drawn from the victors’ perspective; Garland’s stories came from the victims’ perspective, a significant difference.\n\nGarland is also due considerable credit for pioneering work in developing one of America’s most distinctive contributions to world literature: the western. His western novel, The Eagle’s Heart, (1900), featuring a cowboy hero, is as much a quintessential western as Owen Wister’s The Virginian, a book more well-known. Garland’s novel, however, preceded Wister’s by two years.\n\nThe road traveled by Hamlin Garland was long and winding. Throughout his Chicago years, the author encountered diverse frontiers and repeatedly set out to blaze new trails. Garland’s pioneering was accomplished first with a plow, then, ultimately, with his pen. For his ability to bring a fresh perspective to American literature, Hamlin Garland is a significant addition to the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.\n\nKurtis L. Meyer\n\nread less\n\nHe was one of the most famous people in the world. At the peak of his popularity, Finley Peter Dunne was considered one of the great American humorists of his day, comparable to Mark Twain. Dunne was read by most everyone from the common man and woman on the street up to the president of the United States.\n\nIn this day of social media and artificial intelligence--not to mention short attention spans--it may be hard to imagine that one literary figure could wield such cultural influence, but Dunne was no ordinary journalist. Dunne was part of a long and rich Chicago tradition of literary journalists, ranging from George Ade and Eugene Field to Ben Hecht and Mike Royko, who combined exquisite prose with biting wit. Dunne’s career was distinctive for another reason. It intertwined three different aspects of American popular culture: Irish immigration, journalism, and saloons.\n\nPeter Dunne was born in Chicago on July 10, 1867, to Peter Dunne and Ellen Finley, both Irish immigrants, and was raised in St. Patrick’s parish on the city’s Near West Side. His father owned a small lumberyard, while his relatives were active in Democratic ward politics; they also included a number of prominent Chicago priests. After graduating from West Division High School, young Pete--he added his mother’s maiden name Finley later--entered the newspaper business at the tender age of 16 as a copy boy at the Chicago Telegram before being promoted to police reporter. Like other journalists around town, he\n\nworked at other newspapers (and there were plenty of them including the Chicago Daily News), under various beats until, in 1892, he joined the staff of the Chicago Evening Post as an editorial page editor.\n\nIt was at the Post where Dunne truly came into his own. Given that booze and writing have always been big parts of the Chicago literary scene it may not be surprising that Dunne decided to combine the two “ingredients” into one singular creation, Martin Dooley. And in perhaps his boldest move, he allowed his character to speak in Irish dialect. Literary historian Charles Fanning called Martin Dooley, or Mr. Dooley, as he was known, the first dialect voice of genius in American literature.\n\nMr. Dooley dispensed his wisdom while offering ample pours to his workingclass customers along Archer Avenue (Archey Road to him) in the Bridgeport neighborhood. Mr. Dooley was not only a sage and street corner philosopher he was also a survivor of the Great Irish Famine. He was especially known for his acerbic commentary on events of the day, particularly the dubious behavior of politicians.\n\nMr. Dooley was based on an actual bartender, Jim McGarry, who owned a bar in downtown Chicago and was famous in his own day for displaying equal measures of warmth and wisdom as well as for his gregarious nature. Among the customers who patronized his saloon was a young newspaperman by the\n\nname of Finley Peter Dunne. Dunne loved the ambiance of the bar but most of all he loved McGarry’s sparkling personality and his gift of the gab. Before long, Dunne began writing McGarry’s words down on paper.\n\nGiven that the saloon was located at the crossroads where politics and culture came together, McGarry’s also happened to be a favorite gathering spot for politicians, judges, actors, and other assorted denizens of the city. McGarry epitomized the nineteenth century ideal of the bartender: he was everybody’s best friend but he also knew when to keep his mouth shut. (As saloon culture historian Bill Savage once said, “Bars are where people tell each other secrets.”) Significantly, Dunne moved the setting of the tavern from the Loop to Bridgeport, then a predominantly Irish neighborhood on the South Side.\n\nBartenders were respected figures in the community. They were looked up to. Reflecting his status, Dunne made sure Mr. Dooley dressed the part of the upstanding citizen. In a famous drawing of him, the barkeep is attired in black trousers accompanied by a white shirt worn under a black vest accentuated with a bowtie.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1898, Dunne’s weekly columns created a fully rounded picture of Irish American working-class life. His portraits of laborers, streetcar drivers, and mill workers, among other occupations, contain memorable moments of dignity and depth. Satirist, social critic, and all-around thinker, Mr. Dooley was an immensely popular character.\n\nReaders identified with Mr. Dooley’s resourcefulness, his quick wit, and his commonsense approach toward life. Through Mr. Dooley, Dunne examined the customs, habits, and attitudes of a working-class Chicago neighborhood and explored other themes too—the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, the plight of the immigrant, the fight for Irish independence, the struggle of the mostly Catholic Irish to attain respectability in then-Protestant America, and the subsequent pains of assimilation. In sum, Dunne wrote hundreds of Dooley pieces, many of which were later published in book form. Most of them were humorous and droll commentaries on contemporary life in Chicago as seen through the eyes of the fictional barkeep. “As a creator of character sketches of Irish immigrants, [Dunne] affirmed that the lives of common people were worthy of serious literary consideration,” wrote Charles Fanning.\n\nIn addition to Irish topics, Dunne also addressed other themes in his work, such as social reform, the Pullman strike, and Chicago politics. Dunne’s satirical comments on the Spanish-American War, for example, in 1898 were widely reprinted and ushered in the second phase of his career. In 1900, he moved to New York and his columns became nationally syndicated. By the outbreak of World War I, Dunne reportedly was the most famous columnist in the country.\n\nDecades later, in April 1936, Dunne died in New York of throat cancer. By that time, he had fallen into relative obscurity although his most famous character, Mr. Dooley, was still fondly remembered.\n\nDunne should also be remembered for another reason. He helped establish one of Chicago’s most distinctively macabre, if short-lived, literary institutions, the Whitechapel Club in 1889. Inspired partly by the Jack the Ripper murders in the Whitechapel neighborhood of London and regulated by the arcane rules of the Clan na Gael, the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Irish republican organization, the Whitechapel Club was a social group of journalists who met in the back room of a saloon on Calhoun Place in so-called Newsboys’ Alley, where they told stories, recited poems, read from works in progress, and typically ended their evening with a round of jovial drinking songs. The unconventional ambiance included skulls and hangman’s nooses that adorned its walls and ceilings. The chief focus of the room, though, was a huge coffin-shaped dining table. Ostensibly, the qualifications for membership were “wit and good fellowship” but the real purpose of their “meetings” was “serious drinking and newspaper gossip.”\n\nFinley Dunne’s Tavern on Lincoln Avenue in Lakeview honors Dunne’s memory and even has a sandwich named after him: Dooley’s Sandwich consists of grilled cheese with a fried egg and bacon or sausage.\n\nJune Sawyers\n\nread less\n\nNella Larsen is commonly associated with the Harlem Renaissance, yet she was a Chicago native whose personality was decisively shaped by her youth on the near South Side. The Chicago of her early childhood was a sprawling chaos sprung from the ashes of the Great Fire of 1871 and already surpassing in population every American city but New York. “Think of all hell turned loose,” wrote the newcomer John Dewey to his sister in 1894, “& yet not hell any longer, but simply material for a new creation.” Born in 1891 at 2124 S. Armour Street (Federal Street today) to a white Danish immigrant named Marie Hansen and a man of color named Peter Walker from the then-Danish Virgin Islands, Larsen (initially Nellie Walker) grew up in one of the Western Hemisphere’s most notorious vice districts, the so-called Levee. Prowling the area bordering Nella’s to the north, the young journalist Theodore Dreiser wrote in his first feature newspaper story, “Entering the district at midnight and wandering along the broken wooden pavement, ill-lighted by lamps and avoided by the police, the nerves tremble at the threatening appearance of the whole neighborhood.” He could see only filth, misery, and vice in the area--drunken men and despondent women, children with “wan, peevish faces.”\n\nPeter Walker abandoned his wife and daughter soon after Nella’s birth, and Marie could not legally remarry for seven years, but she took up soon after Walker’s disappearance with a white Danish immigrant named Peter Larsen, and they considered themselves married. Marie gave birth to a second, white daughter when Nella was a year old; both daughters were given the Larsen surname and grew up in a Danish-American home. Residential segregation was already an issue but there was no true “ghetto,” because African Americans were still so few. As of 1890, only one point three per cent of the Chicago population was black. By 1910 the number had risen to just two per cent, but a distinct “black belt” had taken form. As a “mixed” working-class family in rapidly segregating Chicago, the Larsens were forced to live in the red-light district, and Larsen’s relationship to the black community was tenuous. Being born to a white woman was enough in itself to cast suspicion upon her legitimacy. Knowing little about her natural father throughout her life made the situation even worse. White women with mixed-race children were routinely assumed to be prostitutes. For young Nella Larsen, the racial culture of the United States imperiled her primary attachments and vexed every aspect of her family’s life. To be identified with her mother, to be carried on her mother’s hip in the butcher shop, to toddle down the sidewalk at her sister’s side, meant braving catcalls and dirty looks.\n\nFor a period of their early youth before starting school, Nella and Anna accompanied their mother to Denmark to live with relatives, apparently for three years, while Peter Larsen moved to the “white” West Side. They returned to Chicago in 1898 after Marie’s mother died and the family promptly moved back\n\nto the vice district at State Street and Twenty-Second Street. Seven months later Marie and Peter Larsen were finally able to legally marry, the seven-year waiting period having elapsed since Peter Walker’s disappearance.\n\nIn adulthood Larsen would be less than forthcoming about her early life and allowed people to assume she came from a bourgeois background. Many who knew Larsen later in her life in New York were fully aware of the reputation of her birthplace. Many had lived in Chicago themselves. If queried on the issue of her parentage, Larsen had little defense at a time when being thought the illegitimate “mulatto” daughter of a white woman would have devastating consequences for any attempt to “make it” in respectable society, a fact that is foundational to Larsen’s first novel Quicksand (1928).\n\nLarsen’s stepfather became a streetcar conductor and her mother a dressmaker, a skilled trade particularly identified with Scandinavian women. As they became more financially secure, they moved to a working-class stretch of State Street in the 4500 south block, in an area with several other “mixed” families as well as black ones. In general, however, the white families were gradually moving out. Chicago’s great labor battles, in Larsen’s own neighborhood, quickly started turning into white race riots as capitalists brought in black workers from the South to break the unions. Black people, excluded from most unions, became automatically equated with “scabs.” Soon white families moving up from the southern border-states began complaining about racially mixed social events in the public schools and the integrated cafeteria at Larsen’s high school. A few black and “mixed” families moving into “white” neighborhoods around\n\nKenwood had their homes bombed, and neighborhood covenants took form to maintain racial “deadlines” at Wabash Avenue to the east and Wentworth to the west. The black belt that Richard Wright would write about in Native Son was taking form.\n\nLarsen nonetheless did well in school at a time when Chicago public schools were considered among the most progressive in the nation. English classes assigned “modern” literature and encouraged creative writing. Larsen graduated eighth grade and spent two successful years at Wendell Phillips High School, the most integrated in the city by far. This at a time when only 12,400 Chicagoans enrolled in secondary school out of a population of two million. There being very few vocational options for working-class black girls, Larsen’s parents clearly knew that Nella would have to somehow find a way into a profession, and into the black world. In contrast, Nella’s white half-sister never even attended high school; nor did the two girls ever attend the same primary school, although they were only a year apart. Marie Larsen was especially concerned that her first daughter receive good schooling--an education far better than the average for working-class people. In 1907 Marie Larsen’s dressmaking--along, perhaps, with the help of a recently arrived uncle from Denmark--enabled the family to send Nella to Fisk University’s Normal School for training black teachers. Fisk educated the children of the nation’s black elite, and many marriages came out of there.\n\nIn the same year Nella took the train south to matriculate at Fisk, her stepfather and mother bought a house on West 70th Place, in a “white” neighborhood only a few blocks away from the Chicago Normal School, which Larsen could have attended for free. Nella never lived in Chicago for an appreciable time thereafter. When she was expelled from Fisk after only a year, apparently over a student rebellion against the dress and social codes for girls, Nella went to live with her mother’s people in Denmark. Her Chicago years were over, but they left an enduring imprint on her personality. The relentless pressures on her most intimate relationships bred a constant fear of abandonment she would never be able to shake. Keenly sensitive to the stigma of blackness, on the one hand, and that of presumed illegitimacy on the other, she adopted a protective mask of diffidence and intense self-restraint. As much as she longed for intimacy, she would always be ready to break off with people before they could break off with her. She was used to being on the outside, attentive to hypocrisy and accustomed to slights. She approached group identity cautiously. To what “group,” after all, had Nella Larsen ever really belonged? Groups had always\n\nspelled trouble for her, inhabiting as she had the bristling borders along which they faced off.\n\nDenmark did not ultimately work out for Nella Larsen, either. She returned to America after three years, promptly entering a black nursing school in an almost all-white hospital in the Bronx. Becoming a highly-regarded nurse and nursing educator, Larsen managed to rise into the black bourgeoisie after a stint at Tuskegee Institute and marry a cosmopolitan man of good family, America’s first black PhD in physics. She then turned to library work, becoming the first black graduate of a professional library school, and found herself, as the Harlem Renaissance took form, on the springboard to a literary career. Her first publications introduced black children to Danish children’s games and rhymes in The Brownies’ Book, a black children’s magazine associated with The Crisis, a journal of the NAACP in New York. Her highly autobiographical first novel, Quicksand, established her as one of the leading fiction writers of the Renaissance and was quickly followed by Passing, an even more admired work. In both novels, the protagonists are natives of Chicago who straddle the black/white divide and have been profoundly shaped in childhood by the city’s racial culture before moving to New York as adults. Passing earned Larsen a book award from the Harmon Foundation and a Guggenheim Fellowship to travel in Europe and North Africa while working on another novel. She was the first black woman so honored.\n\nBut even as these honors came and she started work on a third novel, her marriage disintegrated. Her husband had begun an affair with a white administrator at Fisk whom Larsen knew, and Larsen began spiraling into depression. Her novel, apparently about a white suburban couple with marital problems, was rejected. (The manuscript has never been found.) Larsen survived on alimony for some years, and after her ex-husband died in 1941 went back to nursing, ultimately becoming a head nurse at a hospital on New York’s multi-ethnic Lower East Side and then at Metropolitan Hospital serving the Upper East Side and East Harlem. Forced to retire at the age of seventy-one, within a year she passed away from a heart attack, over Easter weekend, alone in her apartment on Second Avenue near 18th Street. Her body was discovered by the building supervisor.\n\nWhen her white half-sister, now living in California, heard that she was to inherit some money from Larsen, she exclaimed, “Why, I didn’t know I had a half-sister!” But she did know, and there was no need for the ruse. Even the friend she said this to, Mildred Phillips (also raised in Chicago), knew about Anna’s dark halfsister, Nella. Marie Larsen had spoken of her to Mildred’s mother many years before. But Mildred had known never to ask Anna or Marie about the “other” Larsen daughter, and never heard her mentioned in either Marie’s or Anna’s homes. Larsen was buried in Brooklyn in an unmarked grave by a former black nursing friend, in that friend’s family plot.\n\nFor several decades, Larsen’s novels were largely forgotten. In the 1960s, with the rise of the Black Arts Movement, they were dismissed as “rear guard” attempts to prove to white people that some Negroes in America were just like them, with refined European manners and nice belongings, who ought to be allowed into white people’s churches and homes. Such was the critical consensus when Larsen’s novels were first reissued and began to be discussed in university classrooms in the early 1970s. Biographical speculation about her was often wildly inaccurate. In the late 1980s and 1990s, her work was rescued by black feminist critics constructing an alternative womanist tradition to balance the folk orientation of Zora Neale Hurston; but this reclamation came at the expense of her consciously interracial position, and the story of her life retold in a way to deny much of her life experience, particularly her ties to her mother’s family and her claims of having lived in Denmark, which were now viewed as pathetic attempts to play up her “whiteness.” In related fashion, her novels were critiqued for their allegedly superficial emphasis on mulatto characters and passing, which had prevented her from more boldly investigating her real theme--black female sexuality, black sisterhood--and had compromised their literary value. In the twenty-first century the buried record of her life in scattered and unexpected archives was finally corrected. At the same time, her novels have come to be recognized as among the most psychologically probing investigations we have of America’s color line culture, of the reproduction of the black/white divide, and the roles of gender and sexuality in sustaining that divide. She would undoubtedly be proud, if somewhat surprised, to find herself in the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame. It is surely where she belongs.\n\nGeorge Hutchinson\n\nread less\n\nBETTE HOWLAND: THE TALE OF A FORGOTTEN GENIUS\n\nHow Brigid Hughes Discovered a Lost Writer,\n\nand Her Letters from Saul Bellow\n\nIn 1984, writer and critic Bette Howland won a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship.\n\nIn 1983, she published Things to Come and Go: Three Stories. In 1978 she published her first story collection, Blue in Chicago. The same year, she won a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her first book, the memoir W-3, was published in 1974.\n\nOn June 2, 2015, Brigid Hughes, editor of the Brooklyn-based literary magazine, A Public Space, was browsing through the cart of books priced $1.00, the castoffs, at Manhattan’s Housing Works Bookstore, when a book caught her eye. She didn’t recognize the author, but she picked it up with a few other books and went home and started reading it.\n\nHere are the first sentences of W-3:\n\nIn the Intensive Care Unit there was a woman who had undergone open-heart surgery. A monitor was implanted in her heart; it beeped every second of the day and night, a persistent tempo, never racing or slowing down as a human heart seems to, unaccountable times on the most ordinary days of our lives. If it had, the nurses would have been there on the double, their brisk white heels disappearing behind the swaying curtains. The woman was unconscious, she had never come out of it; her life was just a mechanism--its regular pace audible all through the ward.\n\nI must have been hearing this beeping sound for a long time before I knew it.\n\nHughes had stumbled upon the memoir that launched Howland’s career. Howland’s title, W-3, refers not to the government tax form, but to the name of the psychiatric wing of a Chicago hospital. In 1968, Howland was a single mother of two boys, piecing together an income from low-paid librarian shifts and editorial work for the University of Chicago Press. The daughter of Jewish immigrants, she had married a Mayflower descendent, but they divorced. After that, she had no family support. The winter’s chill, the poverty, the providing-on-a-shoestring, became too much. She swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills one afternoon and was hospitalized. It so happens that at the time of their taking, she was in Saul Bellow’s apartment while he was traveling overseas.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that if Hughes, who prior to starting A Public Space in 2006 edited The Paris Review after George Plimpton’s death, hadn’t heard of Howland, then those in-the-know in the literary world hadn’t either. All three of her books are out-of-print, and since winning the MacArthur she hadn’t published another book.\n\n(Full disclosure: I rent a desk at the offices of A Public Space, and volunteered at the magazine in graduate school. I saw the striking cover of W-3 on Hughes’s desk and then nosily interrupted her to ask what the book was. “Funny you should ask,” was her reply, “That was my reaction when I saw the book, too.” That night, unable to contain my curiosity, I went home and ordered my own W-3, as well as Howland’s other books.)\n\nThe mystery of Howland’s life, and her writing, and why she wasn’t more known even in literary circles, drew Hughes in entirely. She had earlier in the year started to think about forgotten women writers, and about the feasibility of focusing an issue of the magazine on them, if she could find them. The seed of the idea emerged from a lecture by another off-the-radar writer, 78-year-old Martha King, about her time in 1955 at Black Mountain College. She spoke about how isolating and difficult the pursuit of independent work is, how recognition is fleeting and rarely received.\n\nFinding Howland proved difficult. An Internet search turned up very little, “She had just vanished” said Hughes, except for a Wikipedia page with a picture of a cheerful, red-faced blond woman that wasn’t actually Howland, and an article about a return to Chicago in a local paper. Hughes turned some of the sleuthing over to Laura Preston, the magazine’s assistant editor. They ordered her books from online used-book dealers. Blue in Chicago arrived as a discarded library book. The card in the back showing it was popular, being checked out at least once a month for several years.\n\nPreston went down into an Internet rabbit hole. She read some of Howland’s writing and was amazed she had never heard of her before. “I was shocked it hadn’t been anthologized or taught in workshops. It was just really good writing. We spent about three weeks looking for her and started to think she had passed away. She was really tricky to find. We knew she was an alum of the University of Chicago. We learned she taught there in the 1990s with the Committee for Social Thought, but there was no address or email on file. We discovered she’d been to the Yaddo writing colony twice, we learned about the prizes she won, the MacArthur, the Guggenheim, and an NEA grant. We went through all these different channels. No one knew how to find her,” explained Preston, adding that a Yaddo administrator told her that, “‘She’s on our list of the lost.’” Finally, Hughes came across an obituary for Howland’s mother. It listed the surviving family members including the names of Howland’s two sons. One of them, Jacob Howland, Hughes discovered, was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Tulsa.\n\nHe responded to an email: Yes, Bette was his mother. Unfortunately, she had had a car accident several years earlier, and for some time had been suffering from dementia. She wouldn’t be able to talk to her. But, Jacob did have some unpublished work of his mother’s, and something else to share with A Public Space, a safety deposit box full of letters from 1961-1990, written to his mother from Saul Bellow. “…Brigid,” he explained, “is the reason we found the letters. My wife and I started looking through Bette’s papers for unpublished material, and that’s when we ran across the letters.”\n\nThe letters are part of a portfolio on Howland in the new issue of A Public Space. In the October issue of Commentary magazine, where his mother had also published some work, Jacob explored the relationship between Bellow and his mother: “Bellow was a literary father to Bette (she was 24 and he was nearing 50 when they met at a writer’s conference on Staten Island in the summer of 1961) and an occasional lover. He mentored her and helped nurse her through a defining illness; she ruthlessly critiqued his manuscripts and dispensed cherished praise,” he writes.\n\n“You get an oblique portrait of her because you are not getting what she has to say,” explained Preston, who transcribed the letters for print. “You have to fill in some of the gaps. Bellow is charming, over-the-top, and melodramatic. They are all entertaining to read.”\n\nIt is also clear that Bellow believed in her talent deeply. Even while she was in the hospital after her suicide attempt he tried to rally her and encouraged her to write her way out of her depression. He says in one letter: “As for writing (your writing) I think you ought to write, in bed, and make use of your unhappiness. I do it. Many do. One should cook and eat one’s misery. Chain it like a dog. Harness it like Niagara Falls to generate light and supply voltage for electric chairs.”\n\nAnd Howland did harness her misery and convert it into electricity for W-3. On her decision to take the pills she writes, “I wanted to abandon all this personal history--its darkness and secrecy, its private grievances, its well-licked sorrows and prides--to thrust it from me like a manhole cover.”\n\nIn the portfolio, through her stories, an essay, and the letters, a portrait of the writer begins to emerge, but questions remain. What happened to a career that held such talent and promise? Howland was nomadic and often lived in isolation. Why did she retreat from what she had earned for herself? What role has the literary community played in allowing her work to fall from memory? Her son Jacob thinks the MacArthur is part of the answer.\n\nThe MacArthur turned into an albatross. “…I think the award may have sapped her confidence,” said Jacob. “If people don’t expect great things from you, it’s easier to please them. But people expect great things from a writer who has won the MacArthur.”\n\nReginald Gibbons, who as the editor of TriQuarterly in the 1990s published her novella Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage--the piece Jacob thinks is her best work: “I managed to get that story from her by asking again and again for something. She seemed so tentative about her work.”\n\nHughes isn’t finished with Howland. There are her letters to Bellow, which she has discovered in Bellow’s archive at the University of Chicago, and when she is able to access them, she hopes to be able to run Howland’s side of the correspondence in the magazine. She is still trying to track down a story she published called “The Lost Daughter.” “There is a lot more I want to understand,” said Hughes. “Why has she been forgotten?”\n\nThe issue of A Public Space did turn into one dedicated to pieces by other underrecognized women writers including Martha King, Kathleen Collins, Rosalyn Drexler, and Friederike Mayröcker. Between these women, Hughes sees not just a commonality in their obscurity, but in the space they shared in their lives. For example, Howland’s first story was published in Bellow’s magazine, Noble Savage, along with a Lucia Berlin story. Berlin, another recently rediscovered writer, has been brought back into print with wide acclaim. In A Public Space, Martha King writes about being at Lucia Berlin’s memorial service. Only a handful of people are there. It is a quiet overlapping dance of underappreciated writers.\n\nA.N. Devers\n\nAs I was sitting at my desk researching this piece, A Public Space managing editor, Lena Valencia, announced to her co-editors, “I found a Rosalyn Drexler book on the discount cart at Unnameable Books this weekend.” They all cheered and passed it around.\n\nThe following letter, from Saul Bellow to Bette Howland, is reprinted in full with permission of Mr. Bellow’s estate. A larger selection of letters from Mr. Bellow to Ms. Howland is featured in A Public Space.\n\nJULY 24, 1968\n\nDear Bette–\n\nI started to write, then decided to wait until Peltz’s visit, just concluded. The message he transmitted was authentic. We are friends, and no friend would let you lose the year--not this year. I thought it unkind--horrible--that your husband would not take the boys in August but tried to bargain with you, taking advantage of your illness.\n\nPeltz’s report on the state of your health was less pessimistic than yours. Of course as a believer in the triumph of vitality, looking on the bright side, Peltz is not a trustworthy informant. But I hope he is right, and that you won’t be an invalid-prisoner for a whole year. Anyway, you must have your own place. That I’m sure can be worked out--in Chicago, if necessary. You don’t really mind Chicago too much, apart from weather conditions.\n\nMy plans (Oh God, my plans!) for coming to Chicago are in embryo--perhaps not even conceived--but I believe I will come on about Aug. 5th after visiting little Daniel on the Vineyard. As for writing (your writing) I think you ought to write, in bed, and make use of your unhappiness. I do it. Many do. One should cook and eat one’s misery. Chain it like a dog.

Known as the First Lady of the Black Press, Payne’s career as a ground-breaking journalist and civil rights activist paved the way for future black journalists. With all of Payne’s accomplishments, contributions, and breaking of racial barriers in journalism, she is an unsung hero who has been largely forgotten.\n\nTwenty miles south from Payne’s childhood home in the Englewood neighborhood, she is buried in an unmarked grave at Mt. Glenwood Memory Gardens South. Payne cared for her community and touched the lives of many people that led to lifelong friendships. Marianne Jordan, a Hazel Crest resident, met Ethel Payne at the First International Women’s Year Conference in 1975 in Mexico City. Jordan was an Illinois delegate and remembered her first encounter with Payne, who was covering the conference. “I sat next to Ethel Payne at the conference. She was always warm and special. Ethel loved talking to people. I was overwhelmed because she was there, and I was sitting next to her, having a conversation. I loved Ethel. She was a special person, and I miss her dearly,” says Jordan.\n\nEthel Lois Payne was born on August 14, 1911, on Chicago’s South Side. Her father was a Pullman porter, and her mother was a stay-at-home mom. Growing up, Payne was an avid reader. Her favorite writer was Paul Laurence Dunbar. Payne attended Lindblom Technical High School in Englewood. She learned to write from her English teacher, who had also taught Ernest Hemingway. After graduating from high school, Payne had ambitions to be a civil rights lawyer. She applied at the University of Chicago Law School but was denied due to her race. Payne had a short-lived career working for the Chicago Public Library as a senior library assistant.\n\nPayne became active in civil rights. She joined the NAACP Chicago Chapter and worked with Asa Philip Randolph’s March on Washington in 1941. In 1948, Payne left for Japan to work as a hostess for the Army Special Services Club. Her role was coordinating entertainment and recreation for black troops stationed in Japan. Payne kept a diary, writing of her experience in Japan. She wrote about racism in the military. President Truman issued an Executive Order to desegregate military quarters and clubs, which General MacArthur ignored. Payne also wrote about babies who were left abandoned because their parents were black soldiers and Japanese women.\n\nIn Tokyo, Payne met L. Alex Wilson, a reporter for the Chicago Defender. Wilson, a World War II veteran, was assigned to cover the black soldiers in the Korean War. Payne shared her diary with Wilson. After reading a few of Payne’s excerpts, Wilson was impressed with her detailed accounts and desire for writing. So, with Payne’s permission, Wilson took her notes to the Chicago Defender, one of the major black newspapers, founded by Robert Sengstacke Abbott.\n\nThe Chicago Defender published excerpts from Payne’s diary. The front-page article received backlash from the military in Japan. Payne described the mistreatment of the black troops and their relationships with Japanese women. Impressed with Payne’s writing skills, the Chicago Defender hired her in 1951. During Payne’s 27-year career with the Chicago Defender, she was at the forefront of several historic events. Payne covered Brown v. Board of Education, Little Rock Nine desegregation, March on Washington, desegregation at the University of Alabama, and the murder of Emmett Till.\n\nPayne became a Washington correspondent for the Chicago Defender. Along with Alice Dunnigan, Payne was one of the first two black women to hold White House press passes. Payne asked the tough questions about segregation and racism that many reporters ignored. At her first White House press conference, Payne questioned President Dwight D. Eisenhower why the police banned Howard University from a Washington Coliseum dinner. President Eisenhower said the incident was a misunderstanding. Five months later, Payne angered President Eisenhower by asking if he supported desegregating interstate travels.\n\nPayne was in attendance when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. President Johnson recognized Payne with two presidential pens for her civil rights activism. Payne’s career covering racial injustices took her to countries abroad. She was the first black reporter to cover the Vietnam War and visited China after President Nixon’s trip in 1972. From 1972 to 1982, Payne became the first black woman hired as a radio and television commentator for CBS’s ‘Spectrum” and “Matters of Opinion.”\n\nAfter 25 years with the Chicago Defender, Payne served as a professor in the School of Journalism at Fisk University for one year. Payne advocated the importance and viability of the black press. “I stick to my firm, unshakeable belief that the black press is an advocacy press,” she once said, “and that I, as a part of that press, can’t afford the luxury of being unbiased … when it comes to issues that really affect my people, and I plead guilty because I think that I am an instrument of change.”\n\nPayne was inducted into the District of Columbia Women’s Hall of Fame and won several awards from the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs, the National Association of Black Journalists and more. Ethel Payne passed away on May 29, 1991, at age 79. In her memory, Payne was honored for her journalism career. In 2015, Lindblom Math and Science Academy dedicated an innovative classroom to honor Payne. In addition, the National Association of Black Journalists created the Ethel Payne Fellowship that annually awards $5,000 to a worthy journalist.\n\nIn 2002, Payne was one of four journalists honored with a US postage stamp. Her life and career are chronicled in three books including The Power of Her Pen: The Story of Groundbreaking Journalist Ethel L. Payne, Pioneering Journalist Ethel Payne, and Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press. Ethel Payne was a fearless journalist and dedicated her life to raising awareness of racial injustices despite obstacles stacked against her. Payne was the voice of the people and deserves a prominent place in history.\n\n—Tammy Gibson\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Oct. 8, 2021 edition of the Chicago Defender\n\nread less\n\nCarol Shields was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1935, and grew up in a house at 700 S. Kenilworth Avenue. “I attended Nathaniel Hawthorne School and Ralph Waldo Emerson School,” Shields said in a May 23, 1988 interview with the Academy of Achievement. “I knew the schools were named after writers — both were male writers, both were dead. I wondered if there were any female writers, live female writers. Perhaps it was then that I started to question the dominance of males in our lives.”\n\nShields was the youngest of three children. Her mother worked as a school teacher, her father in a downtown office. In that same interview, Shields said she wrote as a child, but didn’t imagine that as her calling. “I felt like wanting to be a movie star,” she said.\n\nDuring those childhood and adolescent years in Oak Park, Shields did write. “I did the class poem and the class play,” she said. “There’s always one of those girls. Worked on the literary magazine.”\n\nBut more so she read.\n\nShe has chronicled her intense relationship with the Oak Park Public Library, writing, “All the Saturdays of my childhood were spent at story hours, and I remember one terrible, cold and stormy Saturday when only four or five of us turned up. Instead of going down to the library basement where there was a tiny theatre, we sat around one of the little tables. I looked into the eyes of those other children at the table, ardor clearly stamped on their faces, with fanaticism too. We were different. Other children loved these Saturday mornings, too, but we, for some reason, needed it.”\n\nShields commenced with Oak Park-River Forest High School’s Class of 1953, 36 years after Ernest Hemingway had graduated from the same school. Her graduating class, more than 700 students, was all white, a reflection of the conservative and parochial values, as well as the relative affluence, that characterized her hometown during those years. It was, according to Shields, this vague itch to experience a broader world that led her to seek out stories from an early age, and also, like Hemingway before her, to leave.\n\nShe obtained an undergraduate degree in English, with a minor in history, at Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana. Then she moved to Canada in 1957 after marrying a Canadian, Donald Shields, in her childhood home. Shields stopped writing early in her marriage, but Donald encouraged her to revive her pursuit after the birth of their second child. Even as she cared for young children, Shields attended a writing course at the University of Toronto, where she wrote short stories and poems, including those collected in Others (1972) and Intersect (1974). At the University of Ottawa, where Shields pursued an MA in Canadian Literature starting in 1969, she completed a thesis on Susanna Moodie that would be the basis for her first novel, Small Ceremonies. That novel, published in 1976, focused on biographer Judith Gill, who desires to write fiction. At 40 years old, the devoted mother of five children had herself launched a literary career in earnest; she also established her gift for making the ordinary into the riveting.\n\nAnother novel, The Box Garden, came out a year later, and then her third novel, Happenstance, followed in 1980. Shields wrote steadily—novels, plays, poetry, essays, criticism, short fiction and biography, receiving numerous recognitions and awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\n“Carol Shields wanted to write away the invisibility of women’s lives,” said Susan Swan, author and co-founder of the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction. “So she wrote beautifully crafted fiction, plays, poetry, essays and biography about women. She also edited anthologies like Dropped Threads which featured essays by women from all walks of life talking about things they wished they’d been told.”\n\nHigh praise from authors such as Alice Munro and Margaret Atwood accompanied Shields’ publications, even early on. Her reputation grew to more of an international status after the publication of her novel, Mary Swann (1987). Even as Shields became firmly ensconced as one of the most important literary figures of her generation, she was frequently called a Canadian writer. But her work often crossed those boundaries. Unlike Hemingway, whose body of published work included just one obvious Chicago setting, Shields used her hometown and the larger city on its border in several novels, namely Mary Swann, Larry’s Party, and the unfinished Segue. The short story “Dolls, Dolls, Dolls,” recalled the murder of a ten-year-old girl in Chicago and was, according to Shields, her only autobiographical piece of writing.\n\nIn 1995, Shields received the Tradition of Excellence Award in Literature from her alma mater, Oak Park-River Forest High School.\n\nIn addition to her career as an author, Carol Shields worked as an academic editor; taught at the University of Ottawa (where she earned a Master of Arts degree), the University of British Columbia, and the University of Manitoba; and served as Chancellor of the University of Winnipeg. She received fifteen honorary degrees.\n\n“There are so many qualities to value and appreciate in Carol Shields’ work that many different prize juries have honored it and book-length critical evaluations have been written about it,” said Anne Collins, Carol’s publisher and editor in Canada. “Her sentences are so fine they still feel freshly minted. But what makes me put her in the category of novelists whose work will reward readers even hundreds of years from now is something only the greatest of writers are able to do. Her fiction not only has the power to move a reader immediately—to make you feel every nuance of every bind her characters find themselves in, every joy, every sorrow—but also to give you just that little necessary distance, somehow, a vantage point that launches you into larger reflection on how we humans live. Our vanities, the ephemerality of our lives—how fleeting, and therefore precious, our time is. Carol had a wicked eye for human foibles, and the stories we tell ourselves, and for what happens when life strips those stories away, but also such generosity. I felt this all again, and keenly, as I was recently rereading the published fragment of her last, unfinished novel, Segue, set in her birthplace of Chicago, a place that was clearly much on her mind as she approached the end of her own life. Even in twenty short pages, her characters are fully fleshed, setting off cascades of speculation and empathy in the reader—exactly what we look for in fiction, and what only a novelist with Carol’s gifts can bring us.”\n\nThe Carol Shields Prize for Fiction—co-founded by Swan, editor Janice Zawerbny, and arts activist Don Oravec—was announced in 2020. The new English-language literary award celebrates creativity and excellence in fiction by women writers in the United States and Canada. The inaugural Prize will be awarded on May 4, 2023. Four finalists will each receive $12,500 US, with the winning author to be awarded the sizable $150,000 US purse. The Prize is managed by the Carol Shields Prize Foundation, which encourages participation of women in the literary arts. The Foundation provides scholarships, bursaries, and other forms of financial assistance to women writers to support the production of high-quality literary works.\n\n“In her writing and her life [Carol Shields] stands for the mission of our prize: to support and honor the voices of women writers,” said Swan. “As soon as we named the prize after her, the pushback we’d been experiencing stopped. No one would say a word against her. She was a beloved author and activist widely admired for her writing.”\n\nAnne Giardini, author and daughter of Shields, contributed to this profile.\n\nread less\n\nRay Bradbury was a child of the Midwest. Born in Waukegan, Illinois in 1920, Bradbury spent his formative years playing in ravines, collecting Buck Rodgers comics from the local newspaper, and haunting the public library. In this small corner of what many regard as “fly over country” Bradbury’s gothic imagination ignited and then exploded onto the pages of pulp fiction magazines. And what sparked this remarkable imagination? His hometown where he met Lon Chaney on the silver screen at his local theater. The man of 1,000 faces terrified a very young Bradbury, and Bradbury loved him for it. This love lasted a lifetime. According to Bradbury, Chaney “was someone who acted out our psyches. He somehow got into the shadows inside our bodies; he was able to nail down some of our secret fears and put them on-screen.” Bradbury explained that “the history of Lon Chaney is the history of unrequited loves. He brings that part of you out into the open, because you fear that you are not loved, you fear that you never will be loved, you fear there is some part of you that’s grotesque, that the world will turn away from.”\n\nCompare Bradbury’s description of Chaney’s genius to how Damon Knight described Bradbury’s weird tales\n\nBradbury’s strength lies in the fact that he writes about things that are really important to us—not the things that we pretend to be interested in—but the fundamental prerational fears and longings and desires: the rage at being born; the will to be loved; the longing to communicate; the hatred of parents and siblings, the fear of things that are not the self.\n\nBradbury’s deeply affectionate nostalgia for his Midwestern roots helped him reach international acclaim for his ability to reimagine the American gothic tradition and the dark fantastic. Many of his eerie tales, after all, take place in Green Town—a setting patterned after his childhood hometown which is located only an hour outside of Chicago. Horror writers from Stephen King and Peter Straub to Clive Barker, Neil Gaiman, and Dan Chaon were particularly influenced by Bradbury’s ability to refashion gothic tale settings in Midwestern American small towns and suburbs. Other notable authors such as Margaret Atwood, Steven Barnes, Charles Johnson, Michael Chabon, and the recent two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead were all inspired by Bradbury’s imagination, style, and ability to cleverly depict human encounters with the unknown.\n\nWhile Bradbury’s professional writing career unfolded in Los Angeles, California, he started writing at age 12, several years before the Great Depression forced his family to look for work outside of Bradbury’s beloved hometown. Waukegan is where he met Mr. Electrico—the mysterious carnival actor who commanded an adolescent Bradbury to “live forever!” It was here that Bradbury discovered how to become immortal: by living alongside his favorite authors on the bookshelves. His quest for immortality launched Ray Bradbury’s seven-decade career—a career that intersected an impressively broad spectrum of American cultural history. In addition to becoming one of the most well-known writer’s of our time, Bradbury was deeply connected with Hollywood, where his stories and books were adapted for feature films and television. But his influence reached even broader cultural stages as he wrote for radio, film, television, and stage theater production. Throughout his life he defended public libraries and First Amendment rights, and eventually became one of the most prominent public advocates for space exploration. Bradbury is most well-known for his fiction, having published more than 400 stories and 27 book-length works, including The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, The Golden Apples of the Sun, The October Country, Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Fahrenheit 451. In these works, he engaged real-world issues such as racial and political intolerance, freedom of the imagination, the threat of nuclear war, the need to fund the American Space program, and the vital importance of literacy.\n\nBradbury’s most famous work, Fahrenheit 451—a classic tale of authoritarian government overreach and cultural devaluing of literacy culminating in censorship and book burning—remains a best seller after nearly seven decades in print. In 2006, Fahrenheit 451 became a primary reading selection of the National Endowment for the Arts Big Read program. Other Bradbury works, particularly his short stories, have been published in over 1000 literary anthologies featured in the curriculum of schools throughout the United States.\n\nInfusing his work with prose poems and rich metaphors, Bradbury used his literary craft to probe the human condition, often bypassing the technological terrain of more traditional “hard science fiction” narratives. His unconventional approach to genre fiction, shirking the formulas used by his contemporaries when writing for pulp fiction magazines, propelled Ray Bradbury to new heights as he became a catalyst for bringing the often-marginalized science fiction genre into the literary mainstream.\n\nYet, in spite of all of these accomplishments, Ray Bradbury never forgot where he came from. Green Town is an “everytown”—a fictional place that will seem familiar to anyone who grew up in a Midwestern small town residing in the shadow of a large city. Bradbury captures this sense of place eloquently in his Green Town novels—Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and Farewell, Summer—and numerous short stories. And while most of Bradbury’s Midwestern tales take place in small towns, it’s clear that he also looked fondly on Chicago. He grew up hearing his grandfather tell stories about the World’s Columbian Exposition that Chicago hosted in 1893. In 1933, around the time Bradbury met Mr. Electrico and a few years after his silver screen idol, Lon Chaney, passed away, he spent some time at A Century of Progress International Exposition, also known as the Chicago World’s Fair, which celebrated the city’s centennial. Against the backdrop of the Great Depression, which would soon displace Ray Bradbury and his family from their home in Waukegan, the fair provided an experience of much-needed optimism by imagining a brighter, not-to-distant future. Decades later, Bradbury would write a short story about a bleak, post-apocalyptic future riddled with 1984-esque government overreach and surveillance. In that dark future, it is illegal to reminisce about the past, about better times. But in that setting there is one place on the North American continent where those who wish to recall aloud and dream of better days are safe and off-the-grid—the ruined city of Chicago. It’s not hard to imagine that Bradbury’s experience at the Chicago World’s Fair inspired him to write “To the Chicago Abyss” which appears in his collection The Machineries of Joy. The optimism of that Fair is replete in Bradbury’s stories—whether they be set on Mars, Venus, abandoned sets in Hollywood studio lots, or a charming, oft-overlooked, small town.\n\n—Dr. Jason Aukerman\n\n\"Poems seem to strike me like lightning, or rather the idea for a poem. And I never know where they come from and I never know when they come. It’s always a matter of something connecting with something else. You know, seeing something, hearing something that at another time would not have meant anything, it would have just been a mundane experience. But for some reason or another at that particular moment I see it as something new, I see it as connecting with something else and therefore making a new idea, a new way of seeing it, a new perception.\"\n\nWhen poet Linda Nemec Foster established the Lisel Mueller Scholarship in 2000, her intent was not only to support writers who showed promise, but to enable parents balancing childcare with the hard, solitary work required to create art. Foster knew Mueller first as a mentor then a friend, starting at Goddard College’s low residency MFA program. Foster’s friendship with Mueller deepened over the years and the two remained close the remainder of Mueller’s life. The MFA program started by Ellen Bryant Voigt in 1976 moved from Goddard to Warren Wilson in 1981.\n\n“I was so impressed with how Lisel was able to write her poetry, have two daughters, a husband, and a life,” Foster said. “The Lisel Mueller Scholarship in her honor is given to a writer who has small children, to give them a boost, including financial assistance for childcare. Its intent is practical. Lisel was everything I would want a mother and poet to be.”\n\nThe brilliant poetry that would eventually define Lisel Mueller’s legacy did not enter her story until around 1953, when at the age of 29 her mother’s death provided the “emotional catalyst” for her to begin serious writing. It would be another dozen years, 1965, until Mueller, then 41 years old, published her first poetry collection. That foreshadowed three-and-a-half decades as one of America’s finest and most important poets.\n\nMueller was born Elisabeth Neumann in Hamburg, Germany. In the summer of 1939, just before Hitler’s invasion of Poland ignited World War II, Lisel, then 15, fled Germany with her family. They took refuge in the American Midwest. Her father, Fritz Neumann, a political dissident, had already left Germany and secured a professorship at Evansville College (now Evansville University). Lisel soon enrolled as an undergraduate at Evansville College, where she read the poetry of John Keats and also met classmate Paul Mueller. The two married in 1943. After receiving a bachelor’s degree in sociology the next year, Mueller and her husband did graduate work at Indiana University. Their post-graduate employment, he as editor for legal publisher Commerce Clearing House, she as a social worker and librarian, took them to the Chicago area. Mueller, in those early days, also reviewed poetry for the Chicago Daily News and later Poetry magazine. They lived their first decade in Evanston, some of that time on Crain Street, before moving in 1959 to a Lake Forest home. There, they would reside the next four decades until poor health required their move to senior living facilities.\n\n“I think having come to the U.S. as a young woman, from the horrors of World War II, in Germany especially, she had a way of looking at American life that most American born poets don’t,” said poet Reginald Gibbons. “She had as a backdrop the worse circumstances that human beings could create. She was not a tragic poet at all. But underneath it all there was that basement of memories and knowledge of cataclysm.”\n\nMueller’s work, often in short, lyrical form, is imbued with a sense of history, as well as the folk and fairy tales she studied as a graduate student. In a Dec. 4, 1993 article called “Bringing It All Together” Mueller told the Chicago Tribune’s Karen DeBrulye Cruze, “I write a lot of poems that have tension between what is going on now in society and what has always been there. My poems are much concerned with history. The message is obvious. My family went through terrible times. In Europe no one has had a private life not affected by history. I’m constantly aware of how privileged we (Americans) are.”\n\nThough the Muellers had a Lake Forest address, they were almost equally close to Libertyville and Vernon Hills. Their North Shore home, just 35 miles northwest of Chicago, was much more rural than suburban. Their subdivision, called Forest Haven, was located off Bradley Road in an unincorporated area. Her address was 1590 Longwood Rd. for those many years, though the houses in the subdivision, including hers, later got renumbered. Her youngest daughter Jenny recalls that during her childhood Lisel did not have a dedicated writing space, though at one point she worked in the basement and eventually converted a second-floor room to her studio. Mueller famously spoke about the moo of her neighbor’s Holstein cows serving as a kind of alarm clock.\n\nWhen Mueller moved to this one-acre lot abutting a sprawling 200-acre estate her “consciousness changed.” The setting included woodland in the back, a swimming pond, a vacant lot, a gentleman farmer who raised thoroughbred horses and even camels, a spectacular display of flora, and a large variety of wildlife like frogs and salamanders. She told Folio Press, “…after 40 years in this house I know what time of day it is by the way the light slants. I am intimately familiar with the names and habits of the wildflowers and the birds that live in our hawthorns and aspens. We all live together, in the world and in my poems.” It’s no wonder that her poems teem with images of the natural world and what she called “the indifference of nature” in the face of human suffering.\n\nThe Mueller house boasted an extensive library, especially poetry books, not just in a dedicated room but in the dining room, living room, bedrooms--all over the house. “My mom and dad were both big readers,” said oldest daughter Lucy. “Somebody once came to the house and said, ‘You better get rid of all those dust catchers.’ That’s what they called the books. We used to laugh about that all the time.” There were plenty of excursions to Chicago, especially for cultural experiences like the Field Museum, Lincoln Park Zoo, Steppenwolf Theater and the Shedd Aquarium. The family often visited Evanston, where close family members on both sides lived. But the Lake Forest home was largely the setting in which Mueller thrived as an artist.\n\n“It really is amazing how she just embraced the world,” said Foster, who has now published 12 poetry books of her own, including The Blue Divide (2021), which is dedicated to Mueller. “If she heard something or read something that struck her, then she would begin to process. Classical music, modern music, classical art, contemporary art, politics, history…she would write from those interests, from her wide knowledge and her wide reading.”\n\nFoster counts as one of many poets that Mueller taught, not only at the Goddard and Warren Wilson low residency programs but also some at Elmhurst College and the University of Chicago. Ed Roberson, now a celebrated poet, was another. He’d published two books of poetry before hopping a bus to Goddard, where Mueller accepted him as a mentee. In addition to the time spent on campus, Mueller later helped Roberson through frequent critiques and advice over the phone and through the mail. “Lisel, she is one of the folks who kept me writing,” said Roberson. “She hit me at a crucial time in my writing--it was my third book, Lucid Interval. That was the book, I just let loose. Lisel talked me through that thing. It was kind of a bad time in my life, I had gotten a divorce and lost custody of my daughter. She got back to me every time I sent her something. She’d say, ‘I don’t understand exactly what’s happening, but go on. Try this, do this.’ I was writing all this wild off-the-wall stuff, that’s when my real writing started. That whole year, we’d go on, and she helped get me through that whole book.”\n\nMueller was also an institution builder. She was one of the founders of the Chicago Poetry Center and an important early advocate of the Ragdale residency program.\n\nThe Poetry Center, of course, regularly brought Mueller to Chicago proper, as did other appearances and leisurely visits to the Art Institute, which features in several of her poems. She’d gotten to know Chicago intimately as a case worker in her post-graduate years, as well as her work for the Chicago Daily News. “For many years, she traveled through Chicago meeting her clients,” Foster said. “She knew the streets of Chicago like the back of her hand. She was like a roadmap before GPS. When we’d be traveling into the city, she would know the area, the neighborhood, street names—she still remembered this gridwork of streets in Chicago.”\n\nMueller’s poems generally are not place specific, though some, like her famous poem, “When I Am Asked” certainly locates in her Forest Haven backyard; others clearly take place in Chicago, like the prose poem “Triage.” The latter poem includes the lines, “Walking past a stand of tall, still healthy elms along/Chicago’s lakefront, I think of what Brecht said.” In “Identical Twins,” the narrator studies her own face in the window of a subway.\n\n“She wrote constantly of the role of history in her life and times, and also drew from her immediate surroundings,” said daughter Jenny, author of the poetry collections Bonneville and State Park. “I do recognize the world of her poems and know that was the world I grew up in. She wrote a great deal about her family. Towards the end of his life my grandfather was too ill to live with his wife in Germany and came to live with us.”\n\nStarting in 1965 with her debut collection Dependencies and through the 1996 Pulitzer Prize-winning compendium, Alive Together: New and Selected Poems, Mueller published nine volumes of poetry as well as two books of translation. Among those titles was the National Book Award-winning The Need to Hold Still (1980). Mueller’s first major award came a decade after her first publication, when at the age of 57 she won the Lamont Poetry Prize for The Private Life (1975). Mueller would go on to capture a Carl Sandburg Award (1990), a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship (1990), a Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize (2002), and an Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2019). In 1981, during the Carter administration, she attended an evening of poetry at the White House.\n\nThe Pulitzer jury wrote that Alive Together was “a testament that invites readers to share her vision of experiences we all have in common: sorrow, tenderness, desire, the revelations of art, and mortality — ‘the hard, dry smack of death against the glass.’”\n\nFormer Poetry magazine editor Don Share said in an interview that Mueller was “everything a poet could aspire to be: She hit all the right notes, and did so with grace, heart and wit. American poetry today focuses on such matters as privilege, the drama of everyday life, nature and also war, and she helped create the language in which we write and think about these important subjects.”\n\nThe MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College awards its Lisel Mueller Scholarship annually, a perpetual reminder of the poet’s lasting legacy.\n\nread less\n\n\"There was a certain amount of pride placed upon the doubtful distinction of being an “only Negro,” the thing I came to Chicago to escape.\"\n\nTo have seen Era Bell Thompson around the offices at Johnson Publishing Company, you wouldn’t have known she was a big deal. She had her own office, sure, but her constant good cheer, encouragement and humor belied the fact that the granddaughter of former slaves had clawed her way improbably to the elevated status of renowned international journalist. After John H. Johnson hired Thompson as an associate editor of its Negro Digest, she worked as a co-managing editor and visionary for JPC’s leading magazine, Ebony, from 1951-64. Thompson continued to work for Ebony as an international editor from 1964 until her death in 1986.\n\n“She was never one to complain or talk about ‘I had a hard time,’ “ said John Woodford, a staff writer and editor when he worked at JPC in 1965 and then again from 1969 to the late 70s. “She was always extremely positive. She was one to overcome any obstacles and celebrate her abilities to do it. She knew she could write really well, she was a great reporter, and found a place to use her talents.”\n\nDespite all appearances, Thompson was a big deal, more so during Woodford’s second tour, when Johnson Publishing Company had moved north from its converted funeral parlor offices on South Michigan Avenue to its impressive new building in the Loop. In a career that included more than 40 bylined articles and travel to 124 countries on six continents, publication of a memoir and book-length study of Africa, and important interviews with the likes of Martin Luther King, Jr., Thompson quietly sat among the upper echelons of American journalists.\n\nThompson was 27 years old when she traveled across the Plains and the upper Midwest to witness The Century of Progress in Chicago. This was 1933, the country just barely on the mend from the deepest, most troubling years of the Great Depression. Thompson had been raised first in Des Moines, Iowa, then, Bismarck, Mandan, and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where her father was a farmer, shop keeper and government messenger. After high school, Thompson had seen for the first time a Black newspaper, The Chicago Defender, and soon became a correspondent (she contributed to the “Lights and Shadows” column under the pseudonym Dakota Dick, a cowboy from the Wild West). She’d distinguished herself as a writer for the University of North Dakota campus newspaper and as a college track star. She’d finished her degree at Morningside College (Sioux City, IA), after being forced to leave the University of North Dakota due to illness. The youngest of Stewart and Mary Thompson’s four children and the only girl, Thompson had previously visited Chicago several times. Now, armed with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a few contacts, and with no surviving parents to whom to return, she stayed.\n\nIn her memoir, American Daughter, she recounts her entry to Chicago. “My eyes grew big and my heart pounded as the yellow cab weaved in and out of the maelstrom of traffic, turned into Michigan Avenue, and started south. A huge, double-deck bus staggered around a corner, top-heavy and clumsy. I saw a coloured man. Four men in a long black car shot past. Gangsters! They had to be gangsters, Chicago was full of them. A coloured woman, another coloured man. The crowds and the traffic slowly decreased. All around me now were black people, lots and lots of black people, so many black people I stared when I saw a white person.”\n\nShe would eventually win a Newberry Library fellowship en route to publication of her memoir, an assistant editorship at Ebony in 1947, promotion to co-managing editor in 1951, and a whole string of successes thereafter. But all of that came many years after she first found boarding at the Young Women’s Christian Association and settled for work as a house cleaner (“...it didn’t help to tell people I was a college graduate.”).\n\nThompson scrubbed floors, washed windows, ironed, did laundry, starched collars, styled little girls’ hair and potty-trained little boys, cleaned, shined, and tended to various whims in various households. And this counted as the best Thompson could do after relentless, tireless pursuit of gainful employment.\n\nBy necessity more than choice, Thompson moved fairly frequently within the confines of Chicago’s Black Belt. That first year, she lived at 56th and South Parkway then moved to Rhodes Avenue until 1935. She stayed with friends for a time at 5239 S. Michigan Ave.\n\nFor more than a decade, Thompson labored at temporary jobs while also training for more substantial work. She was a junior clerk for the Chicago Relief Administration, where she started and edited an interoffice newspaper, the Giggle Sheet. Took her civil service exams. Found work at the Illinois Occupational Survey. Then the Works Progress Administration. Did post-graduate studies at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism (1938-40). Was an interviewer with the U.S. and Illinois Employment Survey.\n\nIt was in 1945 that Thompson received the Newberry Library fellowship to write her memoir, A"
