        "text": "This article from 1926 was first published in Motion Picture Classic magazine in August 1926. It is, on the surface, a piece about the demolition of the old Paramount studios. But there appears to be something more going on here. The Jazz Singer was released just over a year later and, with that in mind, this can be read more as a goodbye to the “old” Hollywood, and the author seems somewhat conflicted about whether those changes are good or bad. The piece starts off rather lyrically, but about mid-way through it becomes little more than a list of who was still acting, who was retired, who was living, and who dead. Not all of the information given was the truth, and my notes at the end try to correct this. The above picture is from the first page of the article in question.\n\nThe Haunted Home of Movie Ghosts\n\nBy Robert Donaldson\n\n(Motion Picture Classic, August 1926)\n\nThe Old Lasky Studio in Hollywood Has Become But a Memory. A New Day – With Its New Demands – Has Dawned. Which Means a Bigger and Better Studio Is Being Erected to Film the Paramount Stories.\n\n“I feel like one who walks alone\n\nSome banquet hall deserted,\n\nWhose Lights are fled,\n\nWhose garlands dead,\n\nAnd all but he departed.”\n\nTHOMAS MOORE.\n\nThe pepper-trees are the same on Vine Street in Hollywood, and even, for the time being, the grey exterior of the wooden two-story office-building that stretches the length of the block is untouched and as placid as ever. To the outward eye, the Famous Players-Lasky studio, for years a Hollywood landmark, is unchanged.\n\nYet its heart is gone, and today it is haunted by ghosts, musing ghosts in film finery, who hover about watching the busy crews of wreckers as they destroy.\n\nFor the old studio is no more. The glass, from the enormous roots over the stages is crashing and falling. A structural steel crane is lifting the great beams from their places and laying them side by side near the street. The floors of the stages, floors that have felt the tread of the panorama of movie great (sic), and have borne the weight of the most lavish sets ever erected by Cecil B. De Mille and Allan Dwan and James Cruze, are being torn up. From one side of the city block to the other, the view is unimpaired, where only yesterday one could not see because of the forest of “sets.”\n\nIt is Moving Day\n\nThe long row of dressing-rooms, which housed extras who became stars, and in some cases housed stars who became extras, has gone.\n\nPola Negri’s bungalow – it used to be Mary Pickford’s in the days when Douglas Fairbanks met and fell in love with her – still stands, and so does Gloria Swanson’s, at the opposite end of the lot. But soon, they too, will fall prey to the wreckers.\n\nThe paneling of Jesse L. Lasky’s private office, where contracts that have meant millions to stars have been signed, has been removed and transported to the new studio. Cecil B. De Mille’s churchlike private office was converted some time ago into a projection-room. If these offices could only talk! – what tales they would tell of fame and fortune, of tears and heartaches, of gambler’s chances that won, and great ideas that failed!\n\nFamous Players-Lasky is moving its studio. A new day, a new need. Their two city blocks in the heart of Hollywood is now too small to handle the immense productions the company is making, and the old facilities have become inadequate. So the United Studios lot, off Melrose Avenue, was purchased. The old Lasky lot had ten acres, the new has sixteen. The new lot will have eleven enormous stages. The old had but six, two of them quite small. While the crash and destruction of the wreckers is heard on Vine Street, the pleasant ringing of hammers is heard on Melrose, where a horde of carpenters, masons and plasterers is preparing the new home.\n\nThe Parade of the Specters\n\nGhosts…ghosts…they pass in Midnight Review, like the return before the eyes of the exiled Napoleon at Elba, of his famous marshals, parading in array victorious before him – for the glory of Napoleon and of France.\n\nGhosts…ghosts of film fame, return to this battle-field once illumined with the flare of sun-arcs and Kleigs, once raging with the fierce competition of celluloid rivalries. Ghosts that muse on the fickleness of popular acclaim, ghosts that bow in defeat before the remorselessness of Age – ghosts here and there that bow before the folly of extravagance and riotous living.\n\nAs the shadows of the pepper-trees flicker across the fence, it almost seems that the notes from Wally Reid’s saxophone can be heard from one of the stages…gay, happy, tragic Wally, grinding out eight and nine pictures a year, continuing work when he had to be carried on the set, forcing a smile, making the executives think it was only another irrepressible gag.\n\nIn the distance seems to move the enigmatic, courtly figure of William Desmond Taylor, whose murder created one of the unsolved mysteries in recent years…and just beyond is a girl in golden curls that he is directing; Mary Miles Minter, another ghost, at the age of twenty-two, her film career ended – because of the tragedy.\n\nJust Memories\n\nJames Neill, the character actor, passes in the flesh. As he looks on the ruins, he murmurs the verse quoted at the beginning of this story – “I feel like one who walks alone, some banquet hall deserted –” Neill played in the very first picture made on this lot.\n\n“What memories! What memories!” he said to me. “I remember the early days, when that old barn at the corner was the whole studio. I owned the only automobile – an old Buick. It was the sole car parked under the pepper-trees of Vine Street, where now there are hundreds. Jesse Lasky walked to work, and so did Cecil De Mille, and Samuel Goldwyn. Dustin Farnum, the star, owned a car in New York, but he hadn’t brought it with him. The studio, for its location trips, had three old Pope-Hartfords. Later, Mr. Lasky purchased a small foreign car.\n\nDustin Farnum! Why, isn’t that his name on the Orpheum 24-sheet across the street, advertising him in The Littlest Rebel[1]?\n\nDustin Farnum, the man who missed an opportunity to make a million on this very spot! He and Lasky and De Mille and Goldwyn were the original four partners in the concern. The other three put in $5,000 apiece. Farnum was to get his quarter interest in stock in return for acting in the first picture, The Squaw Man.[2] At the last minute he decided he wanted the $5,000 in cash, and gave back the stock, and the other three took it reluctantly because they had a hard time finding the $5,000. Today, if Farnum had retained the stock, it would be worth more than $1,000,000, not to speak of the many dividends. But he took the $5,000…and is still playing on the Orpheum, so the billboard says.\n\nOnward Stalk the Shadows\n\nIn the tide of traffic that swirls by, one sees another ghost, a chastened, somewhat shrunken ghost with a serious face, who passes in an unobtrusive inexpensive car. He casts a pondering glance at the partially demolished studio. Whatever may be his thoughts, they are well hidden behind the immobile mask of his countenance. It is Fatty Arbuckle, and the door which he is now hurrying past is the same to which he used to drive with a grand flourish in a red-and-gold custom-built automobile. Today he is on his way the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, where he is directing under the name of William Goodrich.\n\nGhosts of dead heroes and heroines, of men and women who laughed and loved in the celluloid world of make-believe, haunt the spot. Most of them worked there, all of them knew it as a landmark: Edward S. Abeles, Harry Woodruff, Bobby Harron, Alan Holubar, the director, all dead. Glorious Barbara La Marr, who died at the pinnacle of her fame; Harold Lockwood, victim of the “flu” epidemic, and brave Larry Paton, who paid the price in France. Arthur Johnson and John Bunny passed away before the studio was well known, but Bunny’s leading lady, Flora Finch, recently appeared in a small role in Gloria Swanson’s latest Paramount Picture.[3] Charles Ogle, the character actor, is retired and living at Long Beach, California. He has no telephone – because the casting directors insist on trying to lure him back to the screen.[4]\n\nFill the Cup and Toast Them\n\nHow the ghost names haunt his famous world of filmdom! Like Napoleon’s conquering army, the ranks are always full, for as soon as one hero falls, another steps in to fill the gap!\n\nFlorence Turner stopped a moment on the avenue to look at the scene of destruction. Once a shining light of movie stardom, she recently returned to the screen in mother rôles.[5] Moths in the flame…\n\nRuth Roland, the heroine of the thrillers, dressed in a chic business suit, slows down in her car to pay passing tribute. She is on her way to close a big business deal, for Ruth is now a real-estate operator of note in Los Angeles. Her name is posted on countless lots in the city.\n\nBryant Washburn enters the gates – on his way to hold a short conference with Raymond Griffith. Five years ago he was a big star on the lot. Raymond Griffith was then an unknown. Today Griffith is a big star – and Washburn recently returned to the screen, playing a second lead in support of Griffith.[6]\n\n“Life’s all right – as long as you have a sense of humor,” he smiled in passing.\n\nTime Was When…\n\nThe faint ghostly trilling of soprano notes recalls Geraldine Farrar, as famous in pictures as she was on the operatic stage. She is now in retirement so far as both arts go, and is living at Ridgefield, New Jersey.[7]\n\nA shadow from the land of the Rising Sun is Sessue Hayakawa, who recently returned to this country from France, where he has been making pictures. One he was famous in Hollywood. Today there is a younger generation that scarcely knows him. He is now trying his luck on the stage.[8]\n\nDapper Charlie Chaplin rides by on his way to his own lot. He casts a passing glance at Pola Negri’s bungalow…\n\nA doorway of the star dressing-room building that is being torn down reveals the name of Kathlyn Williams…she has retired from the screen, and is living abroad with her husband, Charles Eyton.[9] Another doorway reveals that name of Betty Compson, now Mrs. James Cruze. She is now featured in all-star casts…but her friends are predicting she will come back – to stardom.\n\nIn the Days of the Nickelodeon\n\nMemories…memories…Carlyle Blackwell is in vaudeville in England.[10] Fanny Ward is retired and living in Paris,[11] and so is Pearl White. Maurice Costello is on the stage in this country, but his two beautiful daughters, Dolores and Helene, are “carrying on” the Costello name in the films with tremendous success.[12] James Cruze, once famous as a leading man, and especially famous in The Million-Dollar Mystery,[13] in which his ex-wife, Marguerite Snow, played opposite him, is now one of the big directors, and is filming Old Ironsides.[14] Miss Snow is in vaudeville. Francis X Bushman is still in pictures, having last appeared in Ben-Hur.[15] J. Warren Kerrigan occasionally returns to the screen, as in The Covered Wagon.[16] He is living in semi-retirement in Hollywood.\n\nKing Baggot, Francis Ford, Robert Z. Leonard and Alan Hale are all directors, and Marshall Neilan, once tremendously popular as an actor, is now one of the biggest of directors.\n\nJuanita Hansen, once a Sennett bathing beauty and later a dramatic player, is in retirement.\n\nBetty Blythe is making pictures abroad, tho she is scarcely heard of any more. Mae Murray, another old-timer, is still going strong. Beverly Bayne is only seen at intervals on the screen.[17]\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nLois Weber, once a star, and former wife of Phillips Smalley, who played opposite her in most pictures, is the only woman director in the business, and is making a picture for Universal. Smalley is on the stage.\n\nIrving Cummings, an old-time hero, is directing. Mabel Normand, after a time out of pictures during which she was on the stage, has just returned and signed a half-million-dollar contract with Hal Roach. Another old-time actor is now the king of comedy producers – Mack Sennett. Theda Bara, once the vamp of vamps, is now trying to come back as a comedienne.[18]\n\nMabel Van Buren, the first leading lady at the studio, has retired altogether from the screen.[19] So have Edith Storey, Pauline Bush, Patty Darwell,[20] Grace Cunard,[21] Bessie Barriscale, Anita King, Marie Doro and Edna Goodrich. Marguerite Clark is married to a very wealthy New Orleans business man, and is no longer in pictures. Mae Marsh recently made a picture in England, but is now practically retired and living in Flintridge, California.[22] She is the wife of Louis Lee Arms, well-known newspaper man, and has two charming children.\n\nThe Fast Thinning Line\n\nAlice Joyce, once known as the “Kalem Girl,” continues her old-time popularity, and recently appeared in Mannequin[23] and Beau Geste.[24] Blanche Sweet, Marshall Neilan’s wife, is as popular as ever, and is now appearing in Diplomacy, which her husband is directing.[25]\n\nValeska Surratt has retired and is living in New York.\n\nConstance Binney left the atmosphere of the Kleigs some time ago in order to marry a Boston banker.\n\nHenry B. Walthall, famed as the “little colonel” in The Birth of a Nation,[26] after being out of pictures for some time, recently staged a comeback, as did Katherine McDonald.[27] Marguerite Fisher is married and is playing mother rôles and second leads.\n\nBut the passing flicker of film fame, like the verdict between the gladiators and the lions in the old Roman arena, is not always unkind.\n\nMary Pickford is still at the top of picturedom, and so are Doug Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. Owen Moore, Matt Moore and Tom Moore are still high in popularity. Thomas Meighan, another old-timer, so far as picture history goes, is still at the top of the heap, and Gloria Swanson is a star of stars.\n\nRobert Edeson, Hobart Bosworth, James Neill, William S. Hart, Shirley Mason, Viola Dana, Noah Beery, Wallace Beery, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, are all still receiving the rewards of popular favor.[28] Wallace Beery, after many ups and downs, is firmly established as one of the greatest of them all, vying for honors as a character actor only with a comparative newcomer in pictures – Ernest Torrence.\n\nRaymond Hatton is still keeping the even tenor of his way before for the cameras. Marjorie Daw is still prospering before the Kleigs.\n\nSome of them have passed clear out of the picture – into new realms. For instance, “Broncho Billy” Anderson is now running a string of race-horses at Tia Juana. And “Texas” Guinan, once famed as a picture star, is a witty ad lib. hostess at a New York night club. Elliott Dexter is on the stage, and so is Robert Warwick.[29] Vivian Martin is in musical comedy.\n\nDear old Theodore Roberts, the “grand old man” of pictures, is gradually regaining his health after a long siege of illness, and has just appeared in his first picture in two years – The Cat’s Pajamas.[30] He is now making a vaudeville tour. His big house on the hill, at the head of Vine Street, looks sadly down on the wrecked studio, where he came as one of the first actors, and where his portable garage, which he used as a dressing-room, was moved all over the lot as expansion began to take place.\n\nLike Ships That Pass in the Night\n\nGhosts…ghosts that seem to tread softly in the gathering darkness, ghosts that will soon be homeless, wandering sadly thru a new maze of buildings that will spring up on this site. Store buildings, cold, prosy, unromantic; buildings that will not bask gently under the pepper-trees, buildings that will not hide the glitter and pageantry of filmdom; ghosts that will turn over a dead leaf and poke into an odd corner in hope of finding a faded remnant of the studio glory that was. Ghosts that would not feel easy, ghosts who might even be unknown, should they haunt the bright modern buildings of the new studio where the army of film great, ever recruited anew, marches on and on, down the pathways of celluloid fame.\n\n[1] Farnum was in a stage production of The Littlest Rebel on Broadway between November 1911 and January 1912. The dates of when he was in the production at the Orpheum in L.A. are unknown.\n\n[2] The Squaw Man (dir. Cecil B DeMille, 1914)\n\n[3] No evidence has been found to say that this is true.\n\n[4] Charles Ogle retired in 1926 (the year of this article).\n\n[5] Florence Turner’s break from the screen was between 1916 and 1919 – ending some seven years before this article was written – hardly “recent.”\n\n[6] Wet Paint (dir. Arthur Rosson, 1926)\n\n[7] While she was no longer appearing in staged operas, Farrar continued giving recitals until 1931.\n\n[8] With the exception of Daughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan) in 1931, Hayakawa made no films in Hollywood between 1922 and 1949.\n\n[9] Williams returned to the screen after a two-year absence in 1927 with Sally in Our Alley (Walter Lang), and continued working steadily through the 1920s. Her last film was released in 1935.\n\n[10] Carlyle made films in the UK until 1930, as well as starring as Sherlock Holmes in a German silent film version of Der Hund von Baskerville (dir. Richard Oswald, 1929).\n\n[11] Actually “Fannie Ward.”\n\n[12] Maurice Costello was still working in film at the time this article came out, and continued to do so until 1928. His filmography resumes in 1934, but mostly in small or uncredited roles.\n\n[13] The Million Dollar Mystery (dir. Howard Hansel, 1914).\n\n[14] Old Ironsides (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[15] Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (dir. Fred Niblo, 1925).\n\n[16] The Covered Wagon (dir. James Cruze, 1923).\n\n[17] With the exception of an uncredited part in The Naked City (dir. Jules Dassin), Beverly Bayne’s last role for the big screen was Passionate Youth (dir. Dallas M. Fitzgerald, 1925).\n\n[18] Both Normand and Bara only made a handful of films during their mid-twenties attempt at a comeback, and then left film for good.\n\n[19] This was not the case, and she continued appearing in films throughout the 1920s.\n\n[20] Jane (Patti) Darwell would return to film in 1930 and work prolifically until her final role as The Bird Woman in Mary Poppins (Robert Sevenson, 1964).\n\n[21] Grace Cunard had not retired, and worked steadily until the mid-1940s, albeit in supporting (and, later, uncredited) roles.\n\n[22] The Rat (dir. Graham Cutts, 1925). Mae Marsh returned to film in 1931 and continued acting until the mid-1960s.\n\n[23] Mannequin (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[24] Beau Geste (dir. Herbert Brenon, 1926).\n\n[25] Diplomacy (dir. Marshall Neilan, 1926).\n\n[26] The Birth of a Nation (dir. D. W. Griffith, 1915).\n\n[27] Katherine McDonald’s comeback was not to be. It lasted two films, and she made no films after 1926.\n\n[28] William S. Hart released his final film a year prior to this article being published.\n\n[29] Robert Warwick returned to the screen in 1929 and acted prolifically until 1962.\n\n[30] The Cat’s Pajamas (dir. William A. Wellman, 1926)\n\nThe following article by Grace Halton first appeared in Motion Picture Magazine in October 1924. Along with twenty-seven other interviews with silent film stars, it is reprinted in Silent Voices: Vintage Interviews with Silent Film Personalities, available in paperback and kindle formats from Amazon online stores. The pictures do not originate from the original article.\n\n*\n\nTHE QUESTION OF JACK PICKFORD\n\nAn appreciation of this young star who, if he stood alone, and were measured in the public eyes only by the merit of his work –as an artist should be measured – would accomplish very great things indeed\n\nAuthor: Grace Halton\n\n(Motion Picture Magazine: October 1924)\n\nHe sat there behind a desk in the small studio office-room, and from time to time he lit a cigarette, rather nervously. When he smiled, it was quickly but with no reflection of an inner amusement in his eyes. He talked rapidly, but without ease. I felt that in his mind he was wondering what I would ask him next and wishing quite fervently that I would leave.\n\nOutside the summer sun beat down on the Pickford-Fairbanks lot. The walls of Mary’s old Rosita sets seemed to curl and quiver in the downpour of tropical sunshine.[1] The minarets of Bagdad rose, an eye-piercing blaze of silver against the hard blue of the sky. Only in the shelter of the mammoth walls of Doug’s mediaeval castle, erected for Robin Hood and later serving Mary well in Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall, was there shadow and cool.[2]\n\nAnd, quite wisely, a Pickford-Fairbanks chauffeur had parked one of the family’s Rolls-Royce cars in this grateful shade.\n\nSo Jack Pickford and I sat in the little office – Jack most immaculate in white trousers and well-cut gray coat – and when the riveters, working on a giant gas-tank nearby, did not drown out our conversation with their staccato clatter, we talked of various things.\n\nBut I knew, even as I asked him questions and he answered them obediently, like a little boy who hopes he’ll grade at least eighty per cent in examinations, but rather doubts it, that it was no sort of interview.\n\nOne gets no glimpse of the real Jack Pickford this way. I know, for I’ve met him a dozen times in the last half-dozen years, at parties, formal and informal, at the various dancing places, on transcontinental trains. Times when he was his natural, youthful self.\n\nHe was not himself the other day. His manner was guarded. He was earnestly striving to uphold the dignity of the Pickford family.\n\nHe endeavoured not to arouse interest in himself and in his reactions, veering ever from the personal with talk of Marilynn (sic), or Mary and Doug.[3]\n\n“It’s lonesome around here without them,” says Jack. “Sure.”\n\nHe has a way of saying “Sure,” as tho to emphasize his remarks.\n\nNews had come that day of a decoration upon Doug in Paris by the Ministry Beaux Arts. Two gold palms, crossed, and suspended by a purple ribbon. A great honor for Doug. No actor has ever before received this decoration, which was originated by Napoleon and has heretofore been awarded only to educators.\n\nDoug and Mary “have a new stunt” – thus the conversation continued. They like to go down to the Orpheum sometimes, when they’re here at home. It’s hard on Mary never having a chance to go out anywhere without being mobbed, and at last she and Doug have solved the difficult problem and how to enjoy a peaceful evening at a vaudeville show. They buy seats in the last row on the aisle, dress more inconspicuously and put on dark glasses. Then they slip into the theater after the show has started and out again just before the last act is over. The stunt works fine.\n\nThen – Marilynn. Marilynn Miller, before whom jaded first-night Broadway has bent the knee in homage, more than once. Mailynn of the soft golden curls, the babyish face, the twinkling toes. The adored “youngest star on Broadway.” Jack’s wife.\n\nOf these he will talk.\n\nHe and Marilynn are going abroad later in the summer, he says. Marilynn is to meet Barrie. She’s bringing Peter Pan to the stage in the fall and, well, it seems a good idea to meet Barrie beforehand. It’s an awful responsibility, you know, following Maude Adams in Peter Pan. Sure. Jack likes London. He has lots of friends in London. He lit another cigarette. No – he doesn’t like Paris.\n\nIt is later, perhaps, one remembers that Jack’s first wife, the beautiful Olive Thomas, met her tragic death in Paris, and one senses that Jack has been remembering all the time.\n\nOne brings him back from London – and Paris to the sunshine and heat of the Pickford-Fairbanks lot, the rat-tat-tat of the riveters working on the gas-tank, the light laughter of Marilynn and some other girls playing badminton on the studio court.\n\nJack’s next picture, he says, will be made in New York. Marilynn will be working there, he explains, as sufficient reason why he should desert Hollywood. Young Mr. Dudley is the title of the story and, the plot being conveniently laid in New York anyway, they’re going to shoot everything from the Battery to the Bronx.\n\nHis ideas of what he would like to do in future seem rather vague. The majority of actors, when one has talked to them for one consecutive minute, will tell one confidentially of their burning desire to bring to the screen some certain story or play, to create some certain character known to history or literature. But not Jack Pickford. In the main, his life has been mapped out for him by The Family. One feels that decisions as to what Jack will and will not do, rest with them usually, rather than with himself. Initiative is not developed under such circumstances. One feels also, that if he did cherish a secret longing to create some daring, difficult role, to depart in some manner from the comfortable, even routine mapped out for him, he wouldn’t be apt to say anything about it until he had The Family’s O.K.\n\nIn some obscure way, this irritates me, belonging as I do among those wilful persons who consider him an actor with tremendous possibilities. His work before the camera is stamped with authenticity. He possesses the rare ability to submerge himself in the character he is portraying. He never struts and poses in the well-known Hollywood male star manner. If his wild, primitive mountaineer boy in The Hill Billy isn’t as genuine a portrayal as the screen has seen this year, I’ll eat my fall chapeau.[4]\n\nBut he won’t talk about himself. Facing the interviewer, he becomes inarticulate. He’s not thinking of his work. He’s wondering just what sort of impression he is making on me. He is self-conscious, lacking the egotism on which a less sensitive soul might rely.\n\nThat soul of his has been scarred. He has seen his name in ugly headlines blazed across the world. That slight, nervous body has bent before the storm, and the years have passed. Jack hasn’t forgotten.\n\nAs I say, it was no sort of interview.\n\nI left him presently, and the white-hot glare of the Pickford-Fairbanks lot, with the haughty Rolls-Royce still standing in the thickening shadows of grey stone castle walls, and the silver minarets of Bagdad writing fairy tales unnumbered across the sky.\n\nBut the feeling of irritation persisted. I found myself wishing that Jack wasn’t a Pickford. That he hadn’t the fortunes of Hollywood’s royal family behind him. That the rare, delicate artistry of his work might draw strength from some hardier atmosphere. In short, that Jack wasn’t quite so smothered in The Family ermine.\n\nAfter watching the sensitive play of expression across his face for an hour, it intrigues one to muse on what Jack might accomplish if, freed from all prejudice, he stood alone, measured in the public eye by the merit of his work, as an artist should be measured.\n\nIt is good work, that the boy of Seventeen,[5] The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come, and innumerable other photoplays of the native American type, has given us. To one who watches with somewhat bored amusement the tug-of-war now going on between our middle-aged film heroes and the Latin lads, a Jack Pickford performance with its blending of humor and pathos, provides a welcome distraction.\n\nWe find it within us to hope that some day he may contribute to the screen a truly great performance.\n\n[1] Rosita (Ernst Lubitsch, 1923)\n\n[2] Robin Hood (Allan Dwan, 1922); Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (Marshall Neilan, 1924)\n\n[3] Marilyn Miller: Jack Pickford’s second wife.\n\n[4] The Hill Billy (George W.

The life above all other lives you would like to live if you could wave a magic wand, say Abracadabra and presto, have it so?”\n\n“If I had been a boy,” said Carol, “and I wish I had been a boy…I should like to have been a vagabond. A gypsy. A sailor sailing the Seven Seas. I should like to have tramped the earth, to have slept under sun and stars. I should like to have touched at strange ports…to have stayed in them just so long as I found color there. Romance. Adventure….then sailed on again…questing…seeking…working my way, if necessary…with just enough money to get from place to place… It seems to me that would be living at the quick of life. Really living, you know.\n\n“So few people really live. So very few really live their own lives. They live the lives of dozens of other people. They are circumscribed by this and that, caged, hemmed in, forced to do the thing they really don’t want to do, doing it gracefully or ungracefully as they happen to be. Poor things, most of them do it all gracefully. After awhile they don’t care. After awhile they become superficially content. That is the saddest time of all.\n\n“For me, the Perfect Life would be the life of a vagabond…roving…roaming…”\n\nWould Live a Man’s Life\n\nThe place was Sherry’s. The hour was the tea-hour. The atmosphere was one of head-waitered and hushed conventionality. Well-groomed women sat to left and to right of us, imbibing lemon-tinted tea and nibbling at pastried flakes with well-bred indifference. Carol herself, in dove gray, her gentle face musing, her clear eyes fired with dreams of the venturesome Might-Have-Been…if she had been a boy, with the heart of a vagabond.\n\nWe feel, now, that we did Carol some sort of injustice. We don’t know what kind of injustice, but some kind, we are sure. For we thought that she would say, demurely, “I should like a little rose-vined cottage in the country, with baby faces at the windows and a cow browsing in an adjacent meadow…” Or that she would say, intelligently, as her contemporaries have impressively said before her, “I should like best of all a life of study and meditation…a life among my books.” Or, possibly, “I live but for my Art…I wish to give to the world a Masterpiece…”\n\nBut she didn’t. The gentle gypsy, toying with lobster salad, and fresh from The Sorrows of Satan, bespoke a life of vagabondage, a gypsy life, a man’s life…hardy and adventuresome and free….\n\n“But as you were not born a boy,” we persisted, never knowing when to let well enough alone, “as you have to be a girl in this incarnation at rate, what then?”\n\n“I’d still like best of all to be a vagabond,” smiled Carol. “I suppose I’m not inherently domestic. Not yet at any rate. I wouldn’t want to do anything unconventional, however, being a girl. I’m no an admirer of unconventionality. It’s usually a pose – or worse. But if I could, even being a girl, I’d love to be a vagabond…”\n\nJust a Care-Free Girl\n\n“I seem to have no possessive instinct. I mean, I don’t care a bit about having things. I head girls say ‘Oh, I’d give my life to have this…or that…’ I never feel like that. I’m not crazy about clothes. I don’t care a bit about jewels. I haven’t the slightest desire to own cars or houses or anything concrete. That may be a part of my vagabonding instinct. Perhaps it is. The thought of owning things, possessing things, tires me. Bores me. The fewer possessions I have to think about, the more care-free I feel. I never want to have anything really desperately. The instinct of possession is simply left out of me…”\n\nRomantic Musings\n\n“I think The Sorrows of Satan will be a great picture. I’ve seen some of the rushes and it looks wonderful. I’m extremely grateful that I had the opportunity to play in it. Ricardo Cortez does the most splendid work…I don’t think he’s ever touched this standard before…and Mr. Menjou is marvellous, of course. He is, too, very lovely to work with.”\n\n“What do you think about Platonic friendship?” we asked. “We talked to John Gilbert on the subject quite a while ago, and he said that such a state is not possible between an attractive, unattached man and an equally attractive, unattached woman.”\n\n“I’m not qualified to speak in the way Mr. Gilbert is,” Carol said. “I never like to make a definite answer to any broad question, because I feel that I don’t know.\n\n“Life changes so. People change so. What is true for you today is not true for you today.\n\n“Besides, I’ve had so very little experience in the – well, the romantic way. I really feel unable to speak on that subject. But I don’t know why there shouldn’t be Platonic friendships between men and women. I can’t imagine any good reason why not. After all, every man doesn’t fall in love with every woman, nor every woman with every man. That element doesn’t always enter in, I’m sure. I know quite a few men I enjoy talking with, but wouldn’t even think of falling in love with. I’ll have to wait, tho, to deliver my final pronunciamento (sic) on that score.”\n\nHer Secret of Happiness\n\n“I’ve bought a little farm up in the country…outside of Brewster, New York. It’s an old house with old things in it…big trees…a swimming hole…I’m going up to it when I’m not working. When I am working I’ll live in hotels…Perhaps when I retire from the screen I’ll live there permanently…unless I go a-vagabonding…I’d rather like to retire in about two years. I know no one ever has retired when they have said they would – but I hope I do. I think it’s such a sad mistake to linger on after your pinnacle is reached. It’s a form of death and I am too keen about living…\n\n“Then, perhaps, I might marry…have children…I realize that, for a woman, is the only real life, the only satisfactory life, especially after your first youth is gone. It’s a matter of making choices, always, isn’t it? We usually want two things very much. To do two things. We’ve got to take one or the other, never both. Alternatives. I think I’m a bit of a fatalist. I believe in living each day as it comes along…doing the best you can…waiting for the next day to turn up. It seems to me that that is about all a person can do, really. If we plan – well, most of us know what becomes of plans.”\n\nObeys Her Hunches\n\n“If I have one talent about another, it’s that of being instinctive. Or, in the vernacular, I have ‘hunches’. If I obey my hunches I come out all right. If I dont (sic) – the reverse. Even in the smallest matters…I’ve come to trust my hunches…”\n\n*\n\nOver the last year or two I have been slowly working on editing together a collection of vintage articles from fan magazines and newspapers of the 1910s and 1920s that are written by – or interviews with – silent film personalities. It’s been an on/off affair, and there was one point when I abandoned the idea completely and so published a handful on this blog. But now it’s all but finished, and the final product (in paperback and Kindle format) will have twenty-five articles in total, covering eight stars/directors: Renee Adoree, Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, Theda Bara, Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, F. W. Murnau, and Jack Pickford. The hope is that further volumes will follow, but we shall see how it goes.\n\nThe above Carol Dempster article was intended for the project, but ultimately hasn’t made the grade. As it was already typed up, I thought I would share it here.\n\nF. W. Murnau Comes to America\n\nThe German Genius of the Films Talks of Movies and Men\n\nAuthor: Matthew Josephson\n\n(Motion Picture Classic: October, 1926)\n\n“Simplicity! Greater and greater simplicity – that will be the key-note of the new films.”\n\nMurnau was speaking with ardour, gesticulating with his long limbs, whenever his English, altho (sic) correct and without foreign accent, failed him.\n\n“Our whole effort,” he went on, “ must be bent toward ridding motion pictures of all that does not belong to them, of all that is unnecessary and trivial and drawn from other sources – all the tricks, gags, ‘business’ not of the cinema, but of the stage, and the written book. That is what has been accomplished when certain films reached the level of great art. That is what I tried to do in The Last Laugh.[1] We must try for more and more simplicity and devotion to pure motion picture technique and material.”\n\nExactly what I had longed to hear someone say here. Exactly what I hoped this giant of the moving pictures would say. But then Murnau went on to say something which gives his own spirit and personal style completely. Listen:\n\n“In the film you give a picture, for instance, of an object, a thing, and it has drama for the eye; because of the way it has been places, or photographed, because of its relation to the other people or things in this film, it carries on the melody of the film.”\n\nThis is Murnau, the man who created the most vivid drama we have ever seen out of the simplest and lowliest things in The Last Laugh; who made brass instruments ring with music on the screen, or lit up faces so that they were loud with speech; probably the finest director who has come to us from Germany.\n\nHis Influence is Felt\n\nWhat will his influence be here, I wondered? It has been very great already. It is not as if we have been backward, for in the last year or two a number of film masterpieces made by American or American-trained directors follow the same tendencies of those of Murnau. They are simple to the utmost and build solidly on the resources of the cinema – pictures like Vidor’s The Big Parade, Cruze’s Covered Wagon, Henry King’s Stella Dallas, And yet there are people who grumble at the inroads of foreign film stars and directors. How silly! If they could only see the mountains of inferior American celluloid that are shipped to foreign countries and blissfully consumed by the populace.\n\nW. Murnau arrives at exactly the psychological moment, as we are on the verge of an era of truly great pictures. In his valise he brought with him a new epoch-making film, Faust, which is to have its first showing in America. At the very moment, Variety, a seriously inspired German picture, was playing to filled houses with the temperature at ninety.[2] He is deeply interested in America; he has few false ideas about it, least of all that it is impossible to do anything fine over here. And he is here at the behest of the Fox Film Company, seldom noted hitherto for artistic films, but now going in for bigger things.\n\nHe is not merely a giant of the films as I have described him, but in stature towers some six feet and several inches. He is red haired; he has keen, steady eyes and quiet hands. He is a calm man, not easily ruffled or thrown into despair. His manner is unconventional, not at all formal or formidable as that of many Europeans. He is young, not much over thirty-five; his understanding and his knowledge are broad. I think that his abilities will make him respected, and his quiet, personal charm (so happily lacking in useless “temperament”) will make him liked.\n\nMurnau was born of good family in a small town of Westphalia. He was well educated. He became interested in the theatre a few years before the war, at a time when great things were being done in the theatre by men like Gordon Craig, Max Reinhardt and Granville Barker. He worked under the wing of Max Reinhardt as an actor and stage director in the world famous Grosses Schauspielhaus of Berlin. He was doing small things, but learning much under the brilliant Reinhardt, whose production, The Miracle, has thrilled so many thousands of Americans. Another young German was working quietly with Murnau under Reinhardt. They became friends, and were destined to become masters of a new art. The other young fellow’s name was Ernst Lubitsch.\n\nWhen the Great War came, young Murnau found himself in the first line of infantry, in the Royal Guards. Then for a year he was an officer in the aviation corps. Like many of us, he was glad when it was all over, and turned from the art of the theatre to the budding motion picture industry.\n\nSome of the most famous German actors, Emil Jannings, Werner Krauss, Paul Wegener, went into motion pictures.\n\nFew Good Ones in Germany\n\nWe talked about the German situation. What Murnau said will surprise many people.\n\n“Contrary to the impression prevailing here, very few good pictures are being made in Germany. There are few good directors or actors; there are few people who know anything about the cinema. The big companies are loaded with deadwood, sheep. They follow the tide, just as it is followed here. When an interesting experiment turns out to be a hit, as Caligari did over there, they all imitate it.[3] Or Variety. They are all doing circus pictures now. Those who have really been doing things, the talented, far-sighted men, have simply been feeling their way along. The artists who made Caligari had no idea when they started out what their results would be. And yet they discovered some wonderful things, they were pioneers.”\n\n“Too much influence of the modern stage,” I suggested.\n\n“Exactly. I have had to forget everything I learned about the stage. We have had to throw overboard everything that suggests the theatre.”\n\nHere, Murnau spoke with utmost feeling and reverence for Max Reinhardt.\n\n“I feel unbounded admiration for him. He knows more about the theatre than anybody living. I can never tell in words how much association with him meant to me. He seems to know everything, follow everything. He was the most inspiring of men to work under. He is an old man now and very tired; but he is deeply interested in what we are doing on the screen.[4] What we need is a Max Reinhardt of the cinema.”\n\n“Most of the film stars of Europe, like Jannings, come from the stage?” I asked.\n\n“Yes, but that isn’t necessary,” said Murnau. “We don’t need trained stage actors for the movies. There is splendid material everywhere which directors must take over and mold for the purposes of film.”\n\nLike most of the fine German directors, Murnau has a passion for perfecting each detail of his picture. That is one of the distinguishing features of the better importations. In a pinch, Murnau told me, he would rather have a raw, untrained person, who had never played before, than a seasoned star.\n\nWorking over his last picture, Faust, he searched for many months before he found a young female apparition who suited the part of Gretchen; she is the beautiful Camilla Horn, a discovery he is particularly proud of. Her face had just the degree of innocence and child-like beauty he wanted. What a search it must have been in those times?\n\n“In that way,” said Murnau, “I get exactly the effect, the feeling I want into the picture. For the character of Faust I found a truly old man, a Swede, Gösta Ekman, who had seldom played before on the screen.”[5]\n\nHigh Praise for Jannings\n\n“But Jannings is an amazing screen actor,” I said.\n\n“Yes, one of the finest in the world, and a dear friend of mine. Do not misunderstand me. Few people really know how to play before the camera. Jannings is superb before it. The secret of his power is that he uses his whole body for suggestion. He is like this – (Murnau was puffing out his chest and throwing up his shoulders) big as a mountain when playing a king. And when he is a clown or a beggar, he is able to shrink and quiver like the lowest toad. He is absolutely unique. But generally we can train players ourselves.”\n\nMurnau is convinced that there is great material for the screen here to work with in his own way. To find new “types” fills him with pleasure. What a chance for some of our film-struck children! Perhaps new life for some of our fading stars, even under the whip of a brilliant directorial genius, as Irene Rich, for instance, was glorified again under Lubitsch in Lady Windermere.[6]\n\nThe first picture he will work on will be based on A Trip to Tilsit,[7] a novel by the daring of Herman Sudermann,[8] with many interesting situations. This will be done for Fox. Murnau should distinguish himself; everything he does will have his own stamp, his own touch.\n\nScreen authorities, who seldom come near being in agreement, were almost unanimous in pronouncing The Last Laugh the “greatest film ever made.” Credit for this and for Jannings’ superb acting belong almost wholly with Murnau. He spoke of it with unconscious pride.\n\nTalks of The Last Laugh\n\n“I wanted to try a story that you could really tell in five words, an exceedingly simple idea or situation; but the range, the feeling of the film which gave this story was to be limitless in its power of understanding and dramatizing ideas. You can tell the story of The Last Laugh in a sentence, but I wanted the emotions of its central character to become something beyond the power of words to express. I wanted the camera to picture shades of feeling that were totally new and unexpected; in all of us there is a self-conscious self which in a crisis may break out in the strangest ways, and this picture at times reached the subconscious man under his hotel livery.\n\n“The whole action of the thing pointed, for instance to the moment where Jannings takes off his hotel uniform, so that as he removed the coat with its brass buttons the highest point of the drama was reached, a drama that was purely visual. The type of lighting and architecture we used helped a great deal toward this effect; everything superfluous that did not help to carry on the main idea was suppressed and thrown out of the picture.”\n\nFor his work here Murnau has brought over his own architect, a young man named Rochus Gliese, who has collaborated with him in several pictures towards getting the tripled intensity and directness that he goes for.\n\nFaust, the large feature film over which Murnau has been working for several years, is to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn soon. It differs widely from The Last Laugh. It may be another milestone in the progress of cinema. For one thing, it is drenched with atmosphere and color. It has been justly heralded as having the most beautiful photography. Murnau has handled his camera as if it were a great Renaissance painter, a Leonardo or an El Greco. For another thing, it is a great story, a universal theme, handled with great originality.\n\nEvery red-blooded German has had a yearning to do Faust. It is part of the native atmosphere; it is somewhere in the flavor of the good beer every German drinks. It is the rollicking legend of a bright, bold, bad man carrying out all his wicked dreams, that has gripped the imagination for centuries. Those who know their Goethe, or the opera of Faust, will find that Murnau has gone back to the original sources of the legend to create something particularly for the cinema.\n\n“In this film,” he said, “what interested me most was the relation between each scene or sequence. Every single shot has an inevitable part in the movement of the whole picture.”\n\nWe were driving down-town now, toward lunches, banquets, greetings of the Mayor.\n\nIssuing from the quiet, middle-class halls of the great hostelry on Fifth Avenue where Murnau seemed such an odd if good-humored-looking giant, he had shown only a single flash of temperament. This was his demand for a certain luxurious make of American car such as he owned in Berlin. We suggested that it must only be made in Germany.\n\nWe still talked movies. His views were of unfailing interest.\n\nOf Pictures and People\n\nWhat did he think of Variety – the hit of the moment, to the happy surprise of all?\n\n“Beautifully done. Photography, playing, direction. The vaudeville stuff is delightful. It was really planned with the hope of an American success, and I am very happy that it is going so well. Not because it is a German film. I don’t really think that it marked a step forward for the cinema. But it will improve the taste of the public, arouse them and interest them in this type of work.”\n\nCaligari? “It was frankly an experiment. It was aufregend (stimulating), aroused wider interest in motion pictures, showed what might be done.”\n\nLubitsch? “A brilliant man. A most interesting director. But I don’t think he has entirely cast off the influence of the stage that we both got under Max Reinhardt. Many of his films give you the feeling of watching action on stage.”\n\nChaplin? “The genius of the screen. His comedies have the most profound appeal. He is always doing something absolutely fresh and unconscious. There were thing in The Gold Rush that were revelations, he a fountain of cinematic ideas.[9] A Woman of Paris was extremely interesting; but, of course, it was in the European tradition.[10]”\n\nThat reminded me of something I had almost passed up.\n\n“And what do you think of – of – America? I really had to squeeze that in, you know?”\n\n“Thoroly exciting (sic),” he laughed. “My second visit, you know, but I am like a child about it. There are wonderful types here, wonderful faces. Tremendous energy. The whole tradition here suggests speed, lightness, wild rhythms. Everything is novel. Sensational. I was in Childs’ Restaurant last night. It was an amazing place to me. Tonight I am going to Coney Island. It must be barbarous there. I would like to do a wild picture about Alaska. What was the book they were considering? Something like Frozen Nights or Frozen Lights. It has wonderful possibilities. Wonderful. Wonderful…” he murmured as he drove on along the winding road that led thru banquets, receptions, Coney Island, to Hollywood, ultimately.\n\n[1] Der Letzte Mann/The Last Laugh (F. W.

However, at the height of his fame, he was tried for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. After three trials (the first two of which resulted in a hung jury), Arbuckle was acquitted, and received a written apology from the jury. However, it was too late. He was made a scapegoat for the so-called lack of morals in Hollywood and the current ban on his films stayed in place until 1923. The jury verdict seemed unimportant; he had been one of the first victims of “trial by media” and he was unable to get work in front of the camera, although he directed a number of films during the remainder of the 1920s. An on-screen comeback took place in the early 1930s, but just as his career was taking off once more, Arbuckle died of a heart attack, aged 46.\n\nThe following article is from a happier time in Arbuckle’s career, and he comes across in the interview as a warm, gentle man who was totally dedicated to his craft. Written in 1916, the article also indicates just how quickly film was changing and becoming ever more sophisticated during this period, with Arbuckle commenting on the way comedy was progressing from the pure slapstick of Mack Sennett. It’s a wonderful historical document and a lovely portrait of this much-loved comedian.\n\n*\n\nFatty Off Guard\n\nAuthor: Elizabeth Sears\n\n(Film Fun, March 1916. Source: Media History Digital Library)\n\n“Let’s go ‘round to the office,” said Roscoe Arbuckle. “We are not rehearsing today, so there is nothing doing here.”\n\nHe had been standing in the huge studio, with its roof of glass, watching workmen make a set and rapidly paper two walls with a vivid pink hanging. At the end entrance there was bunched an eager group of men and women, hoping against hope that they would have an opportunity to speak to him and get in the cast.\n\nWhen you see his jolly grin facing you from a picture or the covers of a magazine, you are minded to say, “Hey, there’s Fatty!” Somehow you have no inclination to call him “Fatty” when you come face to face with him in the flesh. True, if he were not fat, he might not be so funny; but there are brains there as well as bulk. And Arbuckle has not been idle all these years that he has been in motion pictures. He has been thinking out his plans and dreaming his dreams, and not he has an opportunity to put them on the screen and see how they pan out. He has passed the acrobatic stage and the business of flapping his hands against his sides, as the symbols of fun.\n\n“Of course we have to keep up a little of that stuff,” he explained. “The public has associated it with the Keystone Comedy, and it would not think it a Keystone without a little rough stuff. Wait a minute, until I call the projectionist room. I want you to see the first showing of the first picture we did back in New York – and you will see what I mean. We have tried to get some fine photographic effects here. I have always though there was room for beautiful scenic achievements in comedy as well as the kick and the custard pie.”\n\n“The motion picture world has turned over several times in the past two or three years,” I suggested, which we waited for the man who was to show us the picture. “What is the outlook?”\n\n“Outlook!” repeated the comedy star. “It’s as wide as the blue sky. Film standards change so fast and film styles come in so often that the director whose ideas were heralded as the climax of brilliancy six months ago is old-fashioned now. And if he fails to discard his old ideas and keep at least two laps ahead of the procession – you know what’s going to happen to him.”\n\nThe director-author-actor paused long enough to courteously assure a would-be actor that the rehearsals would not begin for a day or two and that there were no good positions open as yet. He bows out his applicants in such a pleasant and friendly fashion that they forget they were turned down and remember only that they have met “Fatty” and found him most delightful in his manner to them.\n\n“I hate to turn ‘em down,” he apologized, “but I haven’t a thing for them just now.”\n\n“Just a word about your scenarios,” I begged. “Where do you get them, who writes them, and how do you direct them?”\n\nMr. Arbuckle paused long enough to bid a courteous good-morning to three or four young women employes (sic) who passed through the office and who spoke to him shyly. He held open the door for one of them who wore her black hair low and held fast to her forehead with a blue silk garter.\n\n“Not a scrap of scenario paper in my studio,” he admitted. “I wouldn’t know what to do with a manuscript in my hand. I plan out the pictures, and we rehearse them – that’s all.”\n\nEasy enough, isn’t it? And Arbuckle has discovered a grand bit of audience psychology that some of the other stars might well copy. He allows a bit of the picture to film along without him once in a while. He gives the rest of the company a chance. He says he’d rather the audience would wish he would come on back than to wish somebody would sweep him out of the picture.\n\n“An actor doesn’t lose anything by effacing himself once in a while,” he said, as he swung himself comfortably aboard a chair to see the picture in the little projection room. “If he is a favourite, they are all the more certain to welcome him when he gets back in the picture.”\n\nWe viewed the opening of the picture in silent. Arbuckle, as the doctor in He Did and He Didn’t has struck a new note, although the film cutter has cut out a trifle too much footage here and there and leaves the picture a bit minus in continuity once in a while.\n\n“You are breaking away from the slapstick stuff,” commented some one (sic) from the gloom of the room. “How’ll Mack Sennett like that, huh? Sennett’s idea of humor seems to be one garnd slam of kaleidoscopic action that tires the eye and leaves no one strong point in the memory.”\n\nMr. Arbuckle continued to watch himself on the screen diving under the bed for a collar button.\n\n“Well,” he said calmly, “Mr Sennett trusted me to come to New York and put on these plays. He knows what my ideas are along the newer lines of screen comedy.”\n\nIt may be that Sennett has noted the trend and begun to moderate his inordinate frenzy of acrobatic falls and tumbles and violent and unnecessary smashes through breakfast rooms, with the unvarying accompaniment of broken china and ceilings.\n\n“What’s the worst thing that can happen to an actor?” I asked, apropos of the remarkable tumble down the stairs of the doctor in search of the burglar. Mr. Arbuckle handed me the answer slap off the shoulder.\n\n“To arrive,” he said promptly.\n\n“I thought that was what they all desired more than anything else,” I said, in surprise.\n\n“They do,” he replied, “but the trouble is, once they arrive, there isn’t much to do but leave again. When they are climbing up, the public applauds and says ‘That chap is coming right along – doing better every day.’ But once the actor is heralded as an absolute arrival, the public begins to criticise and pick flaws and expect him to better his own standard, and it is a tremendous strain. He simply is forced to keep ahead of the public’s opinion and to spring something newer and better every season. The man or woman who can survive an ‘arrival’ is a star of the greatest magnitude.”\n\nThere’s a bit of thought for you. We mulled it over and watched the picture silently, until Mr. Arbuckle began to chuckle over a scene.\n\n“We had an awful scrap over that,” he said. “You see, sometimes some of us disagree on an essential point of the production, and we stop the picture and thrash it out right there. Miss Normand is a very charming little lady, but she has a mind of her own, all the same, and we had some argument over that. My idea was to mystify the audience right there – not let ‘em have an inkling of why Mabel gets her visitor into her room there, until they see the burglar hauled out from under the bed.”\n\nI noticed that it was his part of the idea that got over, though.\n\n“That’s a good bit,” some one (sic) commented in the group, when the screen flashed the picture of the armchair before the fireplace. Mr. Arbuckle smiled happily.\n\n“That’s what I meant when I said that we need not rob the picture of scenic beauty to get humor into it. Clean comedy, with an artistic background, not merely hysterical laughter and situations.”\n\n“Think the public wants that kind of comedy?” queries one of the visitors. “I don’t believe the public wants to get its laughs mixed up with its thoughts, do you?”\n\n“I’m banking on it,” said Arbuckle confidently,” although older and more experience men that I am have failed to grasp the way of the public and what it will do at a given period. I believe in the comedy that makes you think, and I believe that the time has come to put it on – and that is what I am going to do.”\n\nWe stood a moment in the doorway, when the picture and the interview were over, and watched the little file of actors and actresses in the yard, who had been informed that there would be no use in waiting.\n\n“I’d like to go out to the car with you,” said Mr. Arbuckle, nervously glancing out of the window at the group; “but if I go out there and they see me, they’ll ask me for a job – and I haven’t a thing to offer them.” His blue eyes looked concerned with a boyish sentiment as he bent them on us. “I – I sort of hate to turn them down,” he said deprecatingly.\n\nYou see, responsibility takes the laugh out of you sometimes. And although Roscoe Arbuckle loves to see his public laugh, it takes the smile off his own face when he much in any way distress even a small proportion of it.\n\n“Miss Normand has a longing to play drama on the stage,” he said, as he bade us good-by (sic); “but I don’t believe there is any finer mission on earth than just to make people laugh, do you?”"
