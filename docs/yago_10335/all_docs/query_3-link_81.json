        "text": "This gem is presented by Silent Hall of Fame.\n\nPlease visit\n\nhttps://silent-hall-of-fame.org/\n\nto support our non-profit mission and the legacy of silent movie stars by making a tax deductible contribution.\n\nFEEL FREE TO FOLLOW US ON TWITTER @SilentFilmGems\n\nWe have included this film in our program to illustrate the work and contributions of Florence La Badie, a star of Silent Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Tannhauser\" (\"Tannhäuser\" in German) is a short fantasy drama made by Thanhouser Company. Because the film title and the company that produced it look almost the same, let's clear a possible confusion.\n\nThe film is based on \"Tannhäuser\", an opera by the German composer Richard Wagner; Tannhäuser is the name of the main male character of this opera.\n\nThanhouser Company was created by Edwin Thanhouser in 1910. It produced 1030 silent films (per IMDB).\n\nTannhäuser (James Cruze) and Princess Elisabeth (Marguerite Snow) fall in love, but she is engaged to Wolfram (William Russell). Then Tannhäuser is enchanted by the pagan goddess Venus (Florence La Badie).\n\nMost of the film consists of extended religious episodes, which may or may not appeal to contemporary audiences. For this reason we offer you two versions: the first one is the whole film and the second one includes only the episodes with Florence La Badie.\n\nLet's all give our thanks to Ned Thanhouser for the outstanding work he has done for the past 25+ years in archives around the globe to acquire and publish on DVD and online Thanhouser films starring Florence La Badie.\n\nDirected by Lucius J. Henderson\n\nProduced by Thanhouser Film Corporation\n\nStarring James Cruze, Florence La Badie, Marguerite Snow, William Russell\n\nDistributed by Mutual Film\n\nRelease date July 15, 1913\n\nRunning time 40 minutes\n\nCountry United States\n\nLanguage Silent film, English intertitles\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976:\n\n\"Allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use.\""
