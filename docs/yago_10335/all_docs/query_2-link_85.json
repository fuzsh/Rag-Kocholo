[222][223] 1972 The Last House on the Left Wes Craven Sandra Cassel, Lucy Grantham This film was unusually graphic for its time and many cinema machinists made their own cuts. As a result, some scenes are missing from most versions of the film and the sound is missing from other scenes. [224][225][226][227] 1973 The Wicker Man Robin Hardy Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward The original negative and film elements of Robin Hardy's 99-minute director's cut of The Wicker Man are lost and only survive on tape recordings. In 2013, StudioCanal launched a Facebook campaign to find missing material from the film, which resulted in the discovery of a 92-minute 35mm print at the Harvard Film Archive that saw a theatrical and home media release subtitled The Final Cut. This print, previously known as the \"Middle Version\", was assembled by Hardy for the film's then-U.S. distributor, Abraxas, for its 1979 U.S. theatrical re-release. [228][229] 1974 The Corpse Eaters Donald R. Passmore, Klaus Vetter Michael Hopkins, Ed LeBreton After being sold as a tax write-off, the film faded into obscurity for years until Encore Home Video rediscovered it in 1993 and released it on DVD several years later, claiming to have transferred their copy from the only known surviving print. This version runs 57 minutes and is considered incomplete. [230] 1977 Last House on Dead End Street Roger Watkins Roger Watkins The original cut of the film, bearing the title Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, was three hours in length. Although it was screened in 1974, this version has been lost; the original negatives are missing and may have been destroyed. [231] Star Wars George Lucas Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher For the 1997 Special Edition release of the original trilogy, a deleted scene featuring Jabba, played by Declan Mulholland, was added to the new cut, with Mulholland being replaced by a computer-generated Jabba, which was updated in the 2004 DVD release. The original version of this scene only survives in low-quality snippets stuck together. 1978 Wages of Fear William Friedkin Roy Scheider, Bruno Cremer, Francisco Rabal, Amidou Re-cut version of William Friedkin's 1977 film Sorcerer for international release outside USA and France. Unauthorized work by CIC against Friedkin's wish in effort to make the film more appealing to audiences. All opening prologues were removed and reinserted as short flashbacks, reducing the runtime from 121 minutes to 88 minutes. Contains some alternative scenes not seen on the original cut, alternative takes of some scenes, different dubbing and dialogue in some scenes. Tangerine Dream's music is used much more, and the film has a happy ending compared to the original cut's darker ending. So far the original print of this version has not been resurfaced, but some fans have managed to obtain 35mm print from Czech Republic with Czech language subtitles burned to the image, and are restoring this cut. 1979 Caligula Tinto Brass Malcolm McDowell Most of the third act and many small scenes in the first two-thirds of the film are missing.[citation needed]"
