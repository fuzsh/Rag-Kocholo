        "text": "About Bridal Veil Falls\n\nRating: 3.5\n\nDifficulty: 2\n\nHiking Distance: 2km round trip\n\nSuggested Time: 45 minutes (to base); wheelchair (to top)\n\nDate first visited: 2004-11-20\n\nDate last visited: 2004-11-20\n\nWaterfall Latitude: -37.90892\n\nWaterfall Longitude: 174.89663\n\nJump to: Photos, Videos, Other Info\n\nJump to: Comments and Reviews\n\nBridal Veil Falls was one of the more picturesque waterfalls we had seen in the North Island.\n\nThis particular waterfall was located near the surfing town of Raglan (which helps to differentiate this from the other waterfalls of the same name in New Zealand or in the world for that matter).\n\nWhat made the falls stand out was that its waters seemingly jumped off a 55m cliff then spent most of its time in air before crashing into its deep plunge pool below (see photo above).\n\nIn fact, the Maori name of the falls was Waireinga, which was said to mean “leaping waters”.\n\nIndeed, this name seemed to be far more descriptive of what a visitor would likely see here than the very common name of Bridal Veil Falls.\n\nAccessing Bridal Veil Falls\n\nOur visit to Waireinga (or Bridal Veil Falls) was pretty straightforward.\n\nFrom the signposted car park (see directions below), we briefly walked onto a bush track that then reached a T-junction.\n\nWe first went left at this junction to get right up to the top of the waterfall.\n\nAfterwards, we then went the other way on the T-junction and immediately encountered the next overlook.\n\nThis overlook yielded the view of Bridal Veil Falls that you see in the photo at the top of this page.\n\nFrom this angle, we could best appreciate the plunging nature of the falls.\n\nWe also noted the depth of both the cliff and the advanced recession of the underlying alcove, which suggesting that this was indeed an older waterfall.\n\nAfter having our fill of this lookout, we then continued on the 10-minute trail (20 minutes return) leading down steps through the bush.\n\nIt went all the way down to a dock-like observation area right at the fringe of the plunge pool opposite the waterfall.\n\nWhen we showed up here in the late afternoon in November 2004, we saw a rainbow arcing across its base just above the plunge pool, further adding colour to the scene.\n\nAuthorities\n\nBridal Veil Falls resides in the Raglan area in the Waikato region of North Island, New Zealand. It is administered under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation. For information or inquiries about the area as well as current conditions, visit their website.\n\nWe drove to Bridal Veil Falls from the city of Hamilton so that’s how we’ll describe the driving route here.\n\nFrom the SH1 and SH23 (Massey St) in Hamilton, we drove west on SH23 (becoming Whatawhata Rd) for about 36km.\n\nNext, we turned left onto Te Mata Rd (I believe there was a signpost for Bridal Veil Falls at this turnoff) and followed it for about 9.5km towards a fork.\n\nWe kept left at this fork to get onto Kawhia Rd, and then followed Kawhia Rd for about 4km to the signposted car park at the trailhead.\n\nFor geographical context, Hamilton was about 90 minutes drive (125km) south of Auckland.\n\nFind A Place To Stay\n\nTrip Planning Resources\n\nNearby Accommodations\n\nFeatured Images and Nearby Attractions\n\nTagged with: hamilton, raglan, auckland, surf, wairenga, waikato, north island, new zealand, waterfall\n\nVisitor Reviews of this Waterfall:\n\nIf you have a waterfall story or write-up that you'd like to share, feel free to click the button below and fill out the form...\n\nBridal Veil Falls has some hidden history by Roger Martyn - My Grandfather and in turn my father farmed land that backs onto the reserve that the Bridal Veil Falls is situated, the same farm that I was brought up on.
