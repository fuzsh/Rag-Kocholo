        "text": "Helen and Brian had a very non-traditional wedding day. How non-traditional, you may ask? They had no sit-down meal or dancing and instead, they opted for a cocktail party reception. Guests were told ahead of time that finding dinner and making reservations was on them as the reception was only going to have passed hors d'oeuvres, charcuterie and crudité platters, and cake. There was still an open bar, because what’s a cocktail party without cocktails?\n\nTheir wedding took place at The Maker Hotel on Warren Street in Hudson, New York. The day began rather rainy so we started out with everything inside. Helen and Brian got ready in separate rooms with their closest friends and family. Their outfits and overall styles worked so well together, like a classy punk rock couple, and the hotel’s decor and vibe really emphasized it.\n\nThe ceremony took place in the conservatory with all of their guests encircling the fiddle leaf fig tree arch. Tears came to Brian’s eyes when he saw his beautiful bride for the first time. He was speechless. I don’t know if either of them had ever been happier than they were at that moment. They were about to get married.\n\nBrian’s best friend officiated and put together a lovely ceremony. Helen and Brian spoke their personal vows (using some vow books I made and gifted them!) and exchanged rings and became husband and wife. It was very obvious and the guests clearly saw that these two were meant to find each other.\n\nAfterwards, the party began! Guests spread out between the library, lounge, bar, conservatory, and outside courtyard as the rain had stopped. Food was passed and numerous alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were doled out. In one room, there was a tarot card reader for any interested guest. Everyone mingled and had time to catch up and just enjoy each other’s company."
