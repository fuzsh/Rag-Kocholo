Typical internships can be as short as a few hours of working on an event and often last up to six months. These opportunities may be paid or non-paid. In many cases, these internship positions can lead to potential employment.\n\nDisclaimer: This course does not have an internship program through ed2go. Please check with your instructor for more information regarding internship opportunities.\n\nWhat does a wedding planner do?\n\nAccording to ZipRecruiter, a wedding planner coordinates and executes all aspects of a client's wedding day. Their duties include developing a detailed wedding plan and timeline for clients, such as researching and selecting vendors, managing budgets, and staying organized throughout the wedding planning process.\n\nWedding planners also manage bookings and contracts with vendors, ensuring all payments and deposits are made on time, coordinate all logistics from scheduling meetings with vendors and clients to overseeing set up on the day of the event to problem-solving any issues that arise and ensuring client satisfaction (communication, timelines, and budgets met).\n\nAs a wedding planner, you must be able to provide creative solutions and manage multiple projects at once. The ideal candidate is highly organized, creative, and has the ability to keep multiple projects on track simultaneously.\n\nTypically, how much does a wedding planner make?\n\nThe amount you can earn as a wedding planner is influenced by various factors, such as where you live, the population, your performance and business offerings, and how many weddings and social events you plan annually. Also, whether you plan on working full or part-time will be a major factor. Students who apply the training they obtain from this course to their careers have the potential to make $100,000 per year or more, depending on the volume of weddings and social events they manage each year. Your income and earnings will ultimately be determined by what you plan to offer in your business, any other products or services you provide, and your marketing efforts. This course will walk you through the process step-by-step, to show you how to figure out what you can earn and how to structure your business model and increase revenue. The average wedding planner salary is $53,400 per year, according to ZipRecruiter.\n\nWhat is a typical day like for a wedding consultant?\n\nA day in the life of a wedding consultant can be an exciting and rewarding one, but it's also hard work. Your workday will be a combination of phone calls, emails, and meetings with brides and vendors, plus research, and of course planning and designing that special day for clients. The needs of each bride will dictate the day's events. A large part of your job will involve communicating with vendors and conducting research for clients. You'll also be overseeing services on the day of the event and will be there to support the bride. Expect to include evening and weekend hours in your business schedule.\n\nWhat exactly is a certified wedding planner responsible for in working with a bride?\n\nIn the initial meeting with the bride, a wedding planner will be asking questions and learning more about what the bride would like for her wedding day. Once this information has been gathered, the consultant will then start researching and talking to vendors to see who is available on that date and will start booking vendors for the couple. If the bride needs a consultant to attend the wedding that day, the consultant will handle all necessary arrangements. It's the responsibility of the wedding planner to be a project manager and help the bride produce her ideal wedding, to guide her in the right direction, and to always look out for her best interest. Ultimately, the bridal couple will dictate what they would like a wedding planner to help with.\n\nWill the Certified Wedding Planner course give me the skills I need?\n\nCertified Wedding Planner graduates are better trained and earn a higher income than the average wedding planner. This is the most comprehensive certification course available for this profession.\n\nWhat is the difference between a wedding or bridal consultant, a wedding planner, and a wedding director?\n\nA wedding or bridal consultant works in partnership with the couple and guides them through the process of making wedding decisions. Couples working with a consultant are very much in control of their wedding plans, but can rest assured they have professional guidance and assistance when needed. This allows the couple to enjoy the wedding planning process, making it as fun and stress-free as possible. A wedding planner is similar to a project manager. A wedding planner takes charge and plans the details of a wedding from start to finish. The couple is still involved, but most of the leg work is left to the planner, who will make their arrangements for them. A wedding director coordinates the details, vendors, and itinerary on the wedding day. All concerns are placed on the shoulders of the wedding director during the event. The couple doesn't need to get caught up in the small details and can enjoy their guests and the day's celebration.\n\nDoes this course prepare you for a certification?\n\nThis course allows you to earn your certification through Lovegevity's Wedding Planning Institute (LWPI) as a professional wedding planner and will give you an opportunity to put your new skills to work in an optional internship.\n\nLovegevity's Wedding Planning Institute (LWPI) understands that wedding planning is a serious profession and wants to ensure it is treated as such. The Institute works directly with industry partners to create standardized programs that will bring professional recognition to the industry—and help wedding planning professionals demonstrate their commitment to being the best. LWPI's wedding planner certifications are always at the forefront of trends, and you can be as well when you enroll in a certified course from us.\n\nWhen can I start the course?\n\nThis course is open enrollment, so you can register and start the course as soon as you are ready. Access to your course can take 24-48 business hours.\n\nHow long does it take to complete this course?\n\nThis course is self-paced and open enrollment, so you can start when you want and finish at your own pace. When you register, you'll receive nine (9) months to complete the course.\n\nWhat if I don't have enough time to complete my course within the time frame provided?\n\nThe time allotted for course completion has been calculated based on the number of course hours.
