        "text": "There’s no one size fits all wedding budget. Every element—like location, decor, and guest count—will influence budgets, which makes them differ from wedding to wedding. If you’re an unconventional couple looking to ditch tradition and exchange “I do’s” in an adventurous way, a destination wedding is for you. Not sure it’ll fit in your budget? We’re here to remind you there are endless wedding styles fit for every couple and any budget—destination weddings included.\n\nThe price of destination weddings—much like local, close-to-home weddings—aren’t cut and dry. Most of the guidance you’ll see online will say, “it depends…” because it does! But we don’t like that answer. Helpful information is kind of our thing when it comes to planning your dream wedding. So instead of giving you another list of all of the reasons that it depends, we’ve compiled actual helpful information.\n\nWe’ve broken down every factor that’ll influence your wedding cost and destination wedding budget. Seriously, this is going to be a piece of cake.\n\nWhat Influences The Cost Of A Destination Wedding?\n\nLocation, time of year, wedding size, decor, fashion—almost everything influences your destination wedding cost. Destination weddings come with expenses that aren’t otherwise involved with the planning of a traditional wedding. Travel expenses—like flights and rental cars—along with lodging are the two biggest costs that couples and guests will have to fit into their budgets. So start with those and your wedding venue. These three pieces will likely make up the bulk of your budget.\n\nExpenses Factored Into Your Destination Wedding Budget\n\nWedding Vendors\n\nThe most common wedding planning tip we hear from couples is to hire a talented team of wedding vendors. We couldn’t agree more. This is especially important when planning a far-away celebration. Without a doubt, your wedding planner will be the most important investment for a destination wedding. They’ll be your eyes and ears when it comes to the details you can’t handle from home.\n\nHiring local vendors has many benefits. They’ll ease your wedding planning stress, handle any issues that require immediate attention and can recommend other vendors when building your dream wedding day crew. The average cost of wedding vendors is anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000. The benefits they provide, however, are priceless.\n\nTravel Expenses\n\nWe touched on this already, but we’re doing it again because it’s that important to remember. Whether you’re traveling domestic or international, expenses—like flights and rental cars—will be a large portion of your budget. The average price of travel expenses will range from $600 to $4,000, depending on your location and the time of year you’re going.\n\nYou and your partner should set aside approximately $1,500 per person for travel expenses if you’re planning an international destination wedding and about $600 per person for a domestic destination wedding. This amount doesn’t include travel expenses for your guests.\n\nSome couples planning a destination wedding choose to assist guests by paying for all or part of their travel expenses. While this is in no way a requirement, it’s a great way to show your appreciation for loved ones—if there’s room in the final budget. You should budget an extra $2,000 to $5,000 in your budget if you plan to pay a portion of your guests’ travel expenses and much more if you plan to pay for all of it.\n\nLodging For You And Guests\n\nYour lodging expenses will depend on location and guest size. Keep in mind, the average price for lodging will be between $100 to $300 per room, per night. As with the travel expenses, you aren’t required to pay for your guests’ accommodations.\n\nTo be helpful, you can set up hotel room blocks for your guests. Although it isn’t required, this is a great way to save money and ensure that you and your guests will have a place to stay close to your ceremony.\n\nVenue\n\nA stunning national park, an Airbnb property, or a beachfront winter wonderland resort. No matter which venue you’ve selected, there will be costs associated with each. As with any wedding budget, you should allocate about 50% of your total budget to the wedding venue. This is typically the same for destination weddings—unless you’ve decided to elope, which might just require a permit to legally tie the knot. The price of a wedding venue averages from $3,000 to $10,000.\n\nRecommended reading: The Ultimate Guide to Finding Your Wedding Venue\n\nWedding Decor\n\nWhether you’re dreaming of an intimate celebration—like an elopement or micro wedding—or a large, over-the-top nuptial, there are many elements that can be added to make your day even more you. Decor is a chance to personalize your big day, no matter the location or budget.\n\nOn average, decor—including florals—costs anywhere from $500-$5000. This price is dependent on your desired decor, the size of your wedding, and your choice of floral arrangements.\n\nIf you’re looking to save money you should consider renting larger scale elements, DIYing decor, or repurposing ceremony backdrops. For more budget-conscious ways to decorate your wedding, check out these tips for decorating on a budget.\n\nRecommended reading: How To Decorate Your Elopement\n\nCatering And Dessert\n\nIf you’ve chosen to elope there’ll be very small or even no food expenses. For couples sticking to the traditional wedding route, catering will be a large ticket item. Horderves, catered meals, and alcohol—there’s a lot that goes into the food and drinks portion of your budget.\n\nCatering prices are based on the catering style chosen, dessert choice, and reception bar style. After getting a finalized wedding guest count, selecting your catering style, and choosing dessert you’ll be able to more accurately estimate your catering price. On average catering can cost between $600-$7000.\n\nRecommended reading: Wedding Catering Options Explained\n\nThere’s no cookie-cutter wedding. Whether you’re eloping at your local courthouse, on top of a mountain, or in your dream destination location, it’s important to plan a day that authentically celebrates your unique love story.\n\nWe believe there’s something magical about tying the knot in a far away place. If you’re feeling inspired to ditch tradition by opting for a destination wedding, we’ve got you covered well beyond your budget. Kickstart your wedding planning process by checking out the ultimate guide to planning a destination wedding. Then, find a Junebug Weddings approved wedding planner anywhere in the world.\n\nPicture a day full of redwood trees, the sound of a nearby running creek, and romantic cafe lights lighting up the forest. That’s exactly what Jaclynn and Christian experienced during their wedding at Laughing Canyon. The couple wanted their day to represent their love for adventuring in the great outdoors with boho decor, and thanks to expert planner Lux & Jasper, it was just that.\n\nTheir special day included a reception entrance in a vintage car, drinks out of ox horn mugs, a cocktail named after their pup, and some good old fashioned barbecue. These are just some of the epic details that they included in their day. While their “I dos” are totally gush-worthy, we love how their photographer, Lynn Lewis Photography, summed it all up!\n\nLynn Lewis On The Special Day\n\nJaclynn and Christian said their vows to each other nestled in the Santa Cruz redwoods. Their wedding was absolutely dreamy–with intricate macrame creations, greenery tablescapes, and rust orange details. The bridesmaids danced in their velvet orange dresses, and the groomsmen toasted with their ox horn mugs.\n\nAll these special details only added to the beauty of their love that shined through in little ways–like how she gifted him moon cufflinks—knowing he would forget his—,the way he was just awestruck when he saw her coming down the aisle, and the infectious joy they shared in every moment of their wedding day.\n\nThe Couple:\n\nJaclynn and Christian\n\nThe Wedding:\n\nLaughing Canyon, Davenport, California\n\nThe Made With Love Gown, Accessories, And The Bridal Look\n\nI saw my dress on Instagram years before I was even engaged and just fell in love with it. I’m a huge macrame fan and am a sucker for anything boho, making my crocheted lace gown the best choice for me. It was the first dress of about ten I tried on, but I instantly knew it was the one. It was so feminine yet hippie and playful, which is sort of how I see myself. My accessories were simple–all gold jewelry and Jeffrey Campbell snakeskin booties. I wanted to keep my hair down and just have loose beach curls, nothing too tight or manicured.\n\nShop similar headbands: Double Star Headband ($18.90); Modern Star Silver Headband ($10.80); Baroque Vintage Gold Crytal Mult-Layer Star Headband ($42.39); Celestial Star Headpiece ($24.30)\n\nBoho Meets Rustic Wedding Vibes At Laughing Canyon\n\nChristian and I are always adventuring in the outdoors, whether it be hiking scenic paths or exploring faraway city streets. We wanted our vibe to reflect our interests and travels–boho and hippie meets rustic and shabby chic. It translated beautifully by becoming a little eclectic with hints of macrame, barn wood, copper and rust tones with whites, neutrals, and deep dark greens.\n\nShop similar boots: Marc Fisher Annabel Bootie ($198.95); Chinese Laundry Finn Bootie ($99.95); Seychelles At The Gate Bootie ($138.95); Dolce Vita Shanon Cream Crocodile Print Bootie ($140)\n\nPersonalizing The Wedding\n\nBoth of us were born on a full moon, so we figured it was only fitting to say our vows during a harvest moon, which is believed to be the time to reap what you have sown. Under the towering ancient redwoods, we promised ourselves to one another with all of our cherished friends and family as witnesses, with our Boston terrier, Dallas, acting as our ring bearer. There were so many unique details–from the specialty cocktail named after Dallas, made with local Swanton Berry Farm strawberry lemonade and prosecco, to Christian’s gold ring cast in sand from our favorite local beach. My garter also had blue buttons from my great grandmother that were sown in, and Christian’s eldest brother was our officiant.\n\nThe Wedding Team:\n\nPhotography – Lynn Lewis Photography\n\nEvent Planning – Lux & Jasper\n\nVenue – Laughing Canyon\n\nFloral Design – Flora & Fauna\n\nCatering – Mission Street BBQ\n\nCake – Buttercup Cakes\n\nDJ – Cartwright’s DJ Services\n\nVideography – Beyond the Ridge Films\n\nInvitation Design – Minted\n\nMakeup Artist – Blush Studio\n\nWedding Dress – Made with Love Bridal\n\nBridal Accessories – Jeffrey Campbell + Tilly Thomas Lux\n\nBridesmaids’ Apparel – RenzRags\n\nGroom’s Apparel – Calvin Klein\n\nGroomsmen’s Apparel – Men’s Wearhouse\n\nRings – Main St. Goldworks + Justin Duance Jewelry\n\nRentals – Chic Event Rentals\n\nTransportation – Sub Shuttle Service\n\nMacrame Bouquet Holders & Leash – Moon Looms\n\nCongratulations again to Jaclynn and Christian on their boho Redwood wedding at Laughing Canyon.
