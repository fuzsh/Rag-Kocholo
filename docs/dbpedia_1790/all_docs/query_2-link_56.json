        "text": "So you’ve got the ring, and you’ve got the dress – congratulations! It’s now time to move onto the part of the wedding ensemble that you didn’t realise was going to be so daunting – the veil.\n\nA lot of brides-to-be don’t realise there are so many options available for choice of styles and diversity when it comes to these elegant pieces. From masses of tulle, lace, beading and intricate details to select from, there’s a lot to think about. To help you out, we’ve compiled our best tips in this guide to help you kick start your search, and find the perfect look.\n\nHow to Choose a Veil for Your Sense of Style\n\nBirdcage\n\nELODIE veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nBirdcage veils bring a vintage twist to your bridal look; they are flirty and fun, skimming anywhere from your eyes to your nose and jawline. They work perfectly with every style of dress and can be positioned in varying angles throughout your hair, depending on the look you’re aiming for and the weight of the material. They are usually made of fine netting or lace, wide enough to ensure that you have full visibility, with a hint of intrigue.\n\nElbow or Waist\n\nEMMA veil, photo by Natasha Hurley\n\nOne of the classic wedding veil lengths, these styles cascade beautifully over your shoulders, and cut off at your elbow or waist, as the name indicates. For dresses with a show-stopping bottom half, an elbow or waist length design will allow your gown to shine, and showcase your figure flawlessly. For brides who prefer a more modest look – without a bolero or cover-up – this length can be draped around your shoulders and still allow full movement as you walk down the aisle.\n\nHip\n\nHip length veils offer similar construction as an elbow or waist-length one, with a slightly longer make. These are better suited to narrower style dresses than an elbow or waist-length design, as it will fall differently.\n\nFingertip\n\nMATHILDE veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nUniversally flattering, and a favourite amongst many brides, a fingertip design falls lightly at your fingertips and elongates your torso. The length allows for the back of the bride’s dress to be visible, so is perfect for showing off intricate detailing, as long as the material of the veil is sheer enough for you to see through.\n\nWaltz\n\nSTELLA veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nThis one sits at mid-calf length and was named after the traditional first dance of married couples. This style allows you to dance and move freely at your reception, without having to coordinate the removal of your veil (while leaving your hair intact). This size works well with narrower styles of dress, as it may catch or clash with a wider skirt, such as a ballgown.\n\nFloor\n\nA floor-length veil hits at the same length as your dress and adds the illusion of extra volume to your whole look. Given that this type is designed to just brush the floor, your dress should also stop at floor length, as a train will interrupt the flow and aesthetic of a floor-length veil.\n\nChapel\n\nAURELIE veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nExtending slightly out beyond floor-length, a chapel length veil is ideal for brides who want to forego a train on their dress. This design will create the illusion of a slight train, without the added weight and restriction of movement that some find with a built-in train.\n\nCathedral\n\nFLEUR veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nFor a bride who wants to turn heads when they walk down the aisle and isn’t afraid to bring the drama to their look, a cathedral is the second longest veil (shorter than a royal veil), trailing out beyond your gown. For brides with a built-in train, a cathedral design elongates the silhouette. It also screams ‘bride’ and will work with any style outfit, extending out far enough to allow every detail to be seen.\n\nBlusher\n\nANAIS veil, photo by Amelia Soegijono\n\nThere is no moment that says ‘fairytale wedding’ more than when the groom lovingly sweeps back the bride’s veil to reveal her glowing face. A blusher extends out over the bride’s face and can be incorporated with any other length, as well as a standalone. There are varying lengths of blushers, from shoulder-grazing to waist-length. A pushed back design will create volume on top of your piece and add some additional height to your bridal look.\n\nRemember that how you style your hair is also important and should factor in the length you choose.
