        "text": "Planning Your Wedding at Christ the King\n\nWe offer our congratulations to all anticipating marriage. Marriage is an important sacrament in the Church, and, as such, there are requirements necessary for having a marriage in the Church.\n\nSetting a Date\n\nWe schedule weddings on Saturdays at 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, and 6:00 PM.\n\nCancellation Policy\n\nThe wedding party may cancel their wedding date at any time and receive a full, partial, or refund, depending on the time frame. The Cathedral of Christ the King reserves the right to cancel the wedding if the Church or state legal requirements are not met.\n\nSee our Fee Schedule to learn about refunds\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nMeet the Wedding Guild\n\nWeddings at Christ the King are directed by your celebrant and the Wedding Guild. You’re welcome to hire your own wedding consultant, but they are required to abide by Cathedral policies, and operate only under the direction of the officiant and representatives of the Wedding Guild.\n\nOnce your wedding has been assigned to a Guild member, they will contact you!\n\nAttending a Wedding Guild Workshop\n\nAll brides (and anyone they’d like to bring) are required to attend a Wedding Workshop hosted by the Wedding Guild. They are normally the first Monday of each month at 7:00 PM in the Cathedral. Occasionally these dates change, so we recommend emailing weddingguild@ctking.com to confirm the correct date.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nSpecial Arrangements\n\nInterfaith Marriages\n\nIn an interfaith marriage, the Catholic party is required to “make a sincere promise to do all in his or her power so that all offspring are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church” (Code of Canon Law 1125). The spouse of a different faith needs to be clearly informed about that promise.\n\nIn addition, a “dispensation” is required from the Archdiocese. The priest or deacon facilitating your marriage preparation/documentation will help you obtain this permission.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nMarriage Preparation\n\nA $400 fee applies to couples receiving marriage preparation at the Cathedral, but planning a ceremony at a separate venue. This fee is included in the sanctuary fee for those couples planning a wedding at the Cathedral.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Liturgy\n\nSelecting a Sacred Space\n\nSelecting a Liturgy\n\nIn your meetings with clergy, you’ll select the most appropriate liturgy and receive a wedding planning guide that will help you select appropriate Scripture, music, and other elements of the ceremony.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Time\n\nManaging Time\n\nWith eleven Masses, baptisms, confessions, and up to three weddings each weekend, demand is high for our sacred spaces. Be prepared and have a plan when you arrive!\n\nNote on Receiving Lines and Guest Books\n\nBecause of this narrow timing, we can’t host guest books or receiving lines inside the church or the narthex. Make plans to station these at your reception.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Music\n\nMusic Guidelines\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Decorations\n\nFlowers\n\nOutdoors\n\nWreaths are permitted on entry doors, provided that tacks, staples, nails, or any material which might harm the door are not used. The Cathedral also prohibits rice, bird seed, confetti, bubbles, sparklers, confetti, or similar materials anywhere on campus.\n\nMake sure to plan for them to be cleaned up after the ceremony!\n\nOther decorations require the approval of the Cathedral Rector and the Wedding Guild, and we reserve the right to have unapproved decorations removed upon request.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Children\n\nParticipating Children\n\nWe recommend children participating in the ceremony be at least 4 years old.\n\nChild Care\n\nThe Cathedral doesn’t have a nursery available during weddings, and because of the Archdiocese’s Safe Environment policies, we can’t provide space for planned or impromptu child care by family or guests. Make sure to communicate this to your guests!\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Photography\n\nYour assigned Wedding Guild volunteer is the photographer’s main point of contact while on campus. They will help direct the photographer. The Bride and Groom are responsible for ensuring their photographer has received a copy of these guidelines and agree to abide by them. We reserve the right to ask any photographer/videographer who violates these rules to correct the violation or to leave the premises. No exceptions will be made.\n\nBefore the Ceremony\n\nDuring the Ceremony\n\nAfter the Ceremony\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nPlanning the Ceremony: Videography\n\nThe Cathedral does not offer videographer services. The Bride and Groom are responsible for ensuring their videographer has received a copy of these guidelines and agree to abide by them. We reserve the right to ask any photographer/videographer who violates these rules to correct the violation or to leave the premises. No exceptions will be made.\n\n.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nThe Dress\n\nNot sure about a dress? Send questions or pictures to Felricia Brown, our Wedding Scheduler, at fbrown@ctking.com.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nThe Bride’s Room\n\nThe Bride’s Room, located on the ground level of the Cathedral, can be accessed through the double doors behind the front desk. The Bride’s Room is for the exclusive use of the Bride and her bridesmaids.\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nConduct\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nForms and Documents\n\nChurch Forms\n\nCivil Forms\n\nBack to top ⤴️\n\nFees\n\nFor Weddings Reserved Prior to October 2023\n\n2024 Weddings\n\n2025 Weddings\n\nRefunds\n\nIn the event of a wedding cancellation, the party who paid the fee will be refunded based on when they canceled:"
