        "text": "Chris & Hannah\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club\n\n\"Chris and I lived right down the street from the Ponte Vedra Inn & Club while we were engaged, and we knew that there was no other venue for our wedding. Every detail and experience was beyond what we could have hoped for, and the PVIC team made sure we had the most enjoyable, memorable, and flawless wedding experience possible. From the food tasting and planning meetings to the wedding day, the team made Chris and I feel so special and stress-free. PVIC provides so many fantastic venue options, photography locations, and special additions that we felt like even our backup plan in case of weather would have been a Tier 1 decision. We are forever grateful to the PVIC team for helping us and our guests celebrate our marriage and new family in the best way possible. \"\n\nAngie & Zach\n\nThe Lodge & Club\n\n\"We are so happy we chose The Ponte Vedra Lodge & Club as our wedding venue. We knew we wanted to get married at the beach but initially had a tough time finding a venue that felt right for us. We fell in love with The Lodge while touring all of the beautiful oceanfront event spaces. The entire property is just stunning, but if I had to pick a favorite space it would be the gorgeous ocean dining room on the second floor where we held our reception. All of the arched windows overlooking the water, chandelier and detailed woodwork are so charming. The entire staff did an amazing job throughout both the planning process and execution of day of. We reserved a block of rooms for our guests on site for the weekend which was just wonderful, also! Both Jennifer and Alexandria were great with communication and keeping track of every detail for us. Our guests raved about the food and overall wedding for days to follow! Having our wedding at The Lodge was truly a dream come true and we look forward to celebrating future anniversaries there!\"\n\nTaylor & Josh\n\nThe Lodge & Club\n\n\"Josh and I got married at The Lodge & Club on January 22, 2022. We instantly fell in love with all The Lodge & Club has to offer as a wedding venue. Starting off, we knew that we were planning on having a very large wedding. This was initially a concern for us because we very much wanted to be at this venue, overlooking the beautiful beach of Ponte Vedra Beach. We first met with Jennifer at the beginning of our planning and she was fantastic at answering all of the hundreds of questions that we had. She kept in touch with us throughout the year of planning. We had planned to have the ceremony on the Ocean Lawn, then moving to cocktail hour on the Trellis, and finally making our way upstairs in the Ocean Room for the reception. Since we were planning a large wedding, we had the luxury of using the upstairs entirely, which was one of my absolute favorite parts of the venue. We started working with Alexandria about a month and half before our wedding and she instantly knew exactly what we had envisioned on our big day. Then came the coldest weekend that we had experienced in a very long time. We always had a plan b, which was to bring the ceremony into the Ocean Room where the ceremony was held, but she had the brilliant idea of using the Sea View Grille for the ceremony. This room is amazing! The wrap around view of the ocean made our ceremony what people dream of. It was an enchanting, intimate ceremony surrounded by love. The cocktail hour was, from what I have heard from our guests, just so beautiful. We did our first dance under the chandelier in the lobby, where we were encircled by all of our family and friends. Every little detail about this day was absolutely perfect. Thank you to everyone at The Lodge & Club, from the set up and break down crew, bartenders, waiters and waitresses. This was honestly THE BEST day of our lives. Thank you again, Alexandria and Jennifer for everything that you do! ~ Taylor, Bride\n\nMeg & Billy\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club, The Lodge & Club\n\n\"I had been dreaming of getting married at the Ponte Vedra Club since I was a little girl and it was everything we could have imagined and more! From the very first tour we went on I knew this was the place! Laura was our contact for most of the wedding planning process and she was beyond amazing! Now when we go to the club on the weekends I am always reminded of what an amazing day our wedding day was!\" ~ Meg, Bride\n\n\"My daughter's February wedding at The Ponte Vedra Inn & Club was incredible from start to finish. From her bridesmaids' luncheon in the Seafoam Room, to her rehearsal dinner at The Lodge, to her ceremony on the West Lawn, to her reception inside the Grand Ballroom, everything and every employee were top notch. Our guests loved staying at the resort and having all events on property. The food and service deserved five star ratings at every step. We simply couldn't have been happier with our dream weekend, and I'd highly recommend this venue and its staff, which are outstanding in every way.\" ~ Kelly, Mother of Bride\n\nSharon & Paul Davison\n\nThe Lodge & Club\n\n“The Lodge & Club truly set the scene for the best day of our lives. We can't express how much Annie supported us from start to finish. She captured the magic middle ground of running a \"well-oiled machine\" and personalizing our wedding to match our vision of the perfect day. Annie helped us create our menu and wine list and offered suggestions on innovative ways to blend our family. Annie was the last person I saw before I walked down the aisle and her calm demeanor was exactly what I needed at the moment. Our out of town guests raved about the Lodge & Club staff. They received world class treatment, not only at the wedding, but for their entire stay. I can only hope one of our children get married there so we can do it all over again.”\n\nRion & Cristian\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club\n\n\"The perfect place to have a wedding! I am originally from Georgia but my fiancé and I live in Chile. We chose the Ponte Vedra Inn & Club for our destination wedding. Our friends and family came from Chile, Georgia and all over the world to stay and celebrate with us. Everyone had the most incredible weekend. We worked with planner London Bloom throughout our engagement and she was simply amazing. She helped made all of our dreams into reality. She worked with our vendors from different states , was organized, always responded to our questions quickly and helped make it the best weekend of our lives. The food was hands down the best food I have ever had at a party. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful. We had our reception at the surf club and it was just beautiful. I would recommend this venue over and over again to any bride or groom. It is the perfect venue to bring together all of your loved ones to celebrate.\"\n\nTeal & Nick\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club\n\n\"This was my dream venue! We did the ceremony in the ocean front courtyard and the reception on the surf club patio. Needless to say, the setting was beautiful! Beyond that, we worked with Courtney to help coordinate and she was the best! She was always responsive and worked well with our planner. She really went above and beyond. She was there for every walk through, the tasting and even the day of. She even went out of her way to reach out when they got new plants for our reception space because she thought I would like to use them instead of renting plants! (Which we did—they were exactly what we wanted!) We also had the most wonderful personal attendant the day of the wedding, Jerry, who made sure we had everything we needed! The food and service were amazing as well! Ponte Vedra Inn & Club absolutely lived up to the five diamond reputation!\"\n\nCourtney & Paul\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club is outstanding! From the first interaction with the sales team all the way through our engagement and wedding, we felt extremely lucky to be working with such professionals. Our wedding day was an absolute dream and in particular, London Bloom made that possible. The detail and attention they show each and every wedding sets them apart. Our guests were thrilled with the food and have given rave reviews! On top of the amazing food, the staff is top tier and know how to make every guest feel welcomed. We wanted our wedding to feel elegant and seamless, and that is exactly what we got, thanks to the Inn & Club staff and London. The venue itself is absolutely beautiful and our pictures capture those memories we will cherish forever. We are forever grateful we were lucky enough to have our reception at Ponte Vedra Inn a& Club!\n\nJaclyn & John\n\nPonte Vedra Inn & Club\n\n\"I can't put into words how amazing Ponte Vedra Inn & Club was for our whole wedding weekend! We used them for rehearsal dinner, wedding ceremony, and reception! London was amazing and worked not only with the bride being a night shift nurse, but also out of town and made everything go so smoothly for us, from planning to date of. The rehearsal dinner got rained on from outside and they did a quick turn around for all our guests to move it inside for everyone to eat. The wedding was perfect and I had nothing to worry or fret about on the big day! I had Jerry as my bridal \"everything\". He picked me up on day of at the Inn and catered to our every need throughout the night. The staff goes above and beyond. We had our reception at the Surf Club and it was the most beautiful night. I would get married here again and again if I could! Such a beautiful atmosphere and they make sure everything goes without a hitch!\""
