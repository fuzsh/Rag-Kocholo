        "text": "Welcome back to another weekly blog. This week we will be discussing a topic we have yet to cover. Many of these readings have perused style, decor, trends, aesthetics, date ideas for the happy and so much more. But we have yet to discuss the best time of year to do all of this. Because we are the Brides Of Florida, we will be covering the best months for weddings in Miami. So if you’re a local or looking for a destination wedding spot, keep on reading to get the inside scoop.\n\nNow, because Miami is in the “Sunshine State” it’s commonly believed that it’s perfect sunny weather all year round. If you’re a true Miamian, then you know that this is far from the truth. While we may not get snow, we still have our peak sunny months as well as cooler weather times of the year. We’re gonna break it down for you. From the hottest months to the “winter” months to the rainy days. The tea is all in this post. Yes, we get rainy times of the year. No one wants a rainy wedding. It’s the biggest faux pas but do not worry. A wedding in Miami is still possible. Let’s begin with the diagram.\n\nThe “Cold” Months\n\nThe parenthesis in that title is quite essential. If you know anything about Miami, it’s that it’s not known for its cold weather. But every year we do get our fair share of winter. Those months are in January and February. At this point, the weather will decide to drop between the 50s and 70s which is a lot for us. When you’re accustomed to suntan weather every day, a switch to a cold breeze is definitely a game-changer. At this point, Miami will be one of two things: screaming and crying from freezing or pumping out the turtlenecks and riding boots they bought for this very moment. If you’re not from Miami, then you probably find this weather to not be wintery at all. And, you’re right but not on Miami standards. As for weddings, it’s the most wonderful time of year. The heat and rain are long gone on vacation at this point so you don’t have to worry about sweaty groomsmen or melted makeup. The cool weather mixed in with the sunshine makes it perfect for a destination wedding spot.\n\nSpring Has Sprung\n\nThe ice has begun to melt at this point. March and April weather is just perfect for weddings. No more cold fronts or rain. Flowers are blooming birds are chirping and we still got sunshine. But don’t worry, you won’t get sunburns. These months are probably some of the most common for weddings simply because they have some of the best Miami weather without heat exhaustion. At this point, beautiful flowers and greenery are in bloom which makes for lovely decor and aesthetics. You also won’t have to worry about overly humid weather. Florida is known for that but at this time of year, our humidity levels are down by 67%. So if you’re looking for that in-between weather in Miami look no further!\n\nSummer!\n\nWe have finally reached the months everyone avoids weddings in Miami for very obvious reasons. It's sweating season. No one wants melted cakes and frizzy hair but this season does have its perks. It’s definitely a low season but because of that vendors have much availability and are willing to work with budgets. This is definitely something to take into consideration. And while it may be sweaty season outdoors, there’s no reason to not book an inside venue. Miami offers many lovely inside venues for afternoon and evening weddings. Just because it’s Miami it doesn’t mean the wedding has to be outside. So take advantage of those summer months. They could definitely work for the better.\n\nFall\n\nThe weather during the fall time is optimal for wedding receptions as it can get cooler. Colors and aesthetics are richer. If you want to opt out of that summer look, the August, September, and October months are perfect. The coolest you can expect is about 73 with not much direct sunlight again. Think burgundy, orange, rust-colored hues. These shades can be beautiful for an outdoor ceremony in Homestead or anywhere with rustic decor. Many brides in Miami love having weddings during this time of year because of the creativity that can take place with decor. Just because the wedding is in Miami, doesn’t mean it has to be beach-themed in any way. There are definite ways to turn a very tropical place into something different. The right venue can coordinate your dream wedding.\n\nNovember\n\nThis month is actually perfect for beach weather. Maybe you’re the bride that wants that beach-themed wedding so look no further than November. Sunsets are beautiful with the change and the weather begins to cool off a lot earlier. You won’t have to worry about hot evenings. With the sun setting earlier there will be less time for that excruciating Miami heat. Most beach weddings will take place during this time especially when it's the theme. This isn’t to say that you can only have a beach wedding. November is so close to the holidays that any style is possible. If you want to lean more towards the season festivities then definitely follow the fall hues and aesthetics. Again with Miamis venue options, any theme wedding can come to life.\n\nRemember December\n\nFinally, we’ve made it to the last month of the year. The most wonderful time of year. December weddings have their perks and not perks. For starters, the weather is pretty great if you don’t want to drown in your own sweat. Temperatures range from 63 to 78. Cool and breezy but not freezing. The brutal heat your used to is on vacation this time of year. As for decor, there are options. You can go in the holiday route with burgundy and Christmas wreaths or completely avoid and do some neutral greenery and minimalism. The choice is yours. But December is a good month!"
