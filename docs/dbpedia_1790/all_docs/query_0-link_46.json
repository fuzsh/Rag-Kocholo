In particular, three Tang courtesans: Li Ye, Yu Xuanji, and Xue Tao, express in their poetry the powerful nature of the Tang patriarchy held in the precepts of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and civil law. Each Tang poetess contributes self-dialogue through her poetry that reflects her strength of character, deep sensibility, love of nature, and spiritual quest for the Goddess, The Queen Mother of the West ( //Hsi Wang Mu// ). Although the T'ang poetess is often numbed by the constraints of Chinese philosophy, religion, and civil human bondage, through her poetry the poetess finds her way back to her original self, allowing the rebirth of her soul. This dissertation explores two questions: What does depth psychology contibute to an understanding of T'ang courtesan poetry? What in Tang courtesan poetry contributes to an understanding of depth psychology? The work is an interdisciplinary approach. Chapter 1 introduces the method of hermeneutics as the route not only to understanding the poetry by analyzing and conceptualizing but to regarding the poetry as a voice we must hear, and through hearing (rather than seeing), understand. Chapter 2 focuses on the historical traditions of Chinese classical poetry. Chapter 3 presents the goddesses, NÃ¼ Kua and Hsi Wang Mu, and their spiritual impact on Tang women's poetry. Chapter 4 concerns Carl Gustav Jung and his psychological ideas relevant to Richard Wilhelm's translations of //The Secret of the Golden Flower// and the I Ching . Chapter 5 inquires into the psychological life of the modern Chinese woman comparable to the life of the Tang courtesan-poetess. Chapter 6 concludes with modern Chinese women's poetry, the concept of marginality, and the probing of the self as the poems resemble those of Tang women's poetry. Ultimately, as we listen in to the voices of Li Ye, Yu Xuanji, and Xue Tao, the poetry speaks for itself. <<<\n\n<<forEachTiddler where 'tiddler.title.replace(/^(A|An|The) /,\"\").substr(0,1).toUpperCase() && tiddler.tags.contains(\"Depth Psychology\")' sortBy 'store.getValue(tiddler,\"au\")' ascending write '\"|\"+store.getValue(tiddler,\"au\")+\" |[[\"+ tiddler.title+\"]] |\"+store.getValue(tiddler,\"yr\")+\" |\\n\"' begin '\"|sortable|k\\n|Author|Title|Year|h\\n\"' >>\n\n<<pl 1476209765>> <<< The overall structure of this research is an autoethnographic journey from the depths of deep space into the underworld of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice while considering the depth psychological implications of co-mingling electronic computer-mediated virtual realities and our human-sensed biological reality. In so doing, the effect of screens, the psychological tempo and consumption of imagery, is considered from a phenomenological viewpoint. Proliferating computational devices, with their emphasis upon increasing speed and acceleration, are viewed as connectors as well as psychic retreats. The research examines the contrasts between the electronic virtual construct and our vital lived surround of oxygen and water while considering the legacy and effects of these machines upon our perception of an increasingly degraded environmental circumstance. The research suggests that through an intentional physical and psychological slowing it is possible to reconnect with the elemental rarities of earth and through that sensitivity there opens a possible pathway of re-enchantment and environmental stewardship of the earth as a life. The research presents an alternative scenario of an electronically blinkered and tethered cyborgized people burrowing further into a virtual world until the earth, utilizing its nuanced language of wind, heat, and storm, demands that they look up from their machines and pay attention to the anomalies in their lived surround. The research indicates that the choice is clear but far from sure. <<<\n\n<<pl 1466023040>> <<< The comprehension of the vast and numinous psyche, an unconsciously dominated realm, is the work of depth psychology. Comprehending the domain of the psyche can be a guide into the unknown aspects of the human condition. Attempts to learn about the psyche can rely upon visions and concepts which work to achieve an eternal soulful presence. The use of matter to appreciate spirit is one medium from which psyche can be illuminated. This research study explores the in-between place of the psyche through the formations of the sky and its atmospheric contents. Depending upon the hermeneutic method as a tool to take one out of the literal and into the subjective will help to acknowledge the strong dialogue created through metaphors of the soul and its skyward partner. The relationship forged through this metaphor has provided a visual manifestation of the psyche within the atmospheric sky. This sky finds itself transformed through an alchemical method, from which an understanding of one's own psyche begins to take shape. The complex dynamic that can be found when working with the physicality of the sky and one's unconscious can find interpretations through alchemical, hermeneutic, and phenomenological methods. In comprehending the symbolic interactions between soul and sky, creative models are depended upon to present this research in a way that will apply to the applications of analytic or archetypal psychology. Utilizing active imagination and visioning, parallels between atmospheric and psychic states can be drawn, yielding a universe of imagery that quickens soulful understanding. The lens of the atmosphere provides a dreamscape of an \"atmospheric psyche,\" supplying a depth psychological focus that expresses a multiplicity of states, negotiating the psychic and external environments and their imaginal domain. <<<\n\n<<newTiddler label:'new2009' text:{{store.getTiddlerText('new2009','')}} tag:2009 [[Depth Psychology]]>> <<newTiddler label:'new2008' text:{{store.getTiddlerText('new2008','')}} tag:2008 [[Depth Psychology]]>> <<newTiddler label:'new2007' text:{{store.getTiddlerText('new2007','')}} tag:2007 [[Depth Psychology]]>>\n\n<<pl 928457840>> <<< This is a hermeneutic phenomenological study of the lived adoption experience of adults who were adopted as infants and who participated in systemic constellations. Systemic constellation work is a phenomenological process developed by Bert Hellinger that can, among other things, be used to examine and resolve issues related to family and ancestral dynamics. Five adults who were placed in their adoptive homes by the age of 6 months volunteered to be interviewed twice, once before and once four months after they participated in a systemic constellation group that included their own family constellation. In the first interviews, participants answered questions about the family they grew up in, how they learned about adoption, current relationships with adoptive and birth families, and what being adopted means to them, including any gifts that it has given them and how they perceive being adopted has influenced their life decisions. In the second interviews, participants answered the same questions and additional questions about their constellation experience and their perception of how it has impacted their life experience. Interviews and the constellations were recorded and transcribed. The interviews were analyzed iteratively to elucidate themes of both the lived adoption experience and the differences between the experience expressed before and after the constellation process. The lived adoption experience was found to be one of ambivalence: it is a difference that gets a lot of attention and is also ignored and misunderstood; it can be both a gift and an experience of loss; it can be shared but also must at times be handled privately with care. Only one of the participants reported feeling that the constellation experience impacted their adoption experience but each of the participants expressed some difference in their perception of family members. The five constellations provide an example of the variety of experiences and resolutions that can emerge in systemic constellations when an open, phenomenological stance is maintained. <<<\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Stephen Aizenstat'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Edward Casey'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Joseph Coppin'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Lionel Corbett'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Michael Denney'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Christine Downing'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Veronica Goodchild'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Stanislov Grof'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Harry Polkinhorn'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Patricia Katsky'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Alan Kilpatrick'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Aaron Kipnis'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Allen Koehn'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Helene Lorenz'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Deborah MacWilliams'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Valerie Mantecon'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Elizabeth Nelson'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Jeffrey Raff'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Robert Romanyshyn'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Susan Rowland'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Jennifer Leigh Selig'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Dianne Skafte'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Glen Slater'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Dennis Slattery'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Maurice Stevens'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Victoria Stevens'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Mary Watkins'>>\n\n<<tiddler adv with:'Barry Williams'>>\n\n<<tiddler [[Advisors:##a]] \"dp50\">><<tiddler [[Advisors:##b]] \"dp50\"]]>> <<tiddler br15>> /% !a * [[Aizenstat, Stephen|Advisor: Aizenstat, Stephen]] * [[Casey, Edward|Advisor: Casey, Edward]] * [[Coppin, Joseph|Advisor: Coppin, Joseph]] * [[Corbett, Lionel|Advisor: Corbett, Lionel]] * [[Denney, Michael|Advisor: Denney, Michael]] * [[Downing, Christine|Advisor: Downing, Christine]] * [[Goodchild, Veronica|Advisor: Goodchild, Veronica]] * [[Grof, Stanislov|Advisor: Grof, Stanislov]] * [[Katsky, Patricia|Advisor: Katsky, Patricia]] * [[Kilpatrick, Alan|Advisor: Kilpatrick, Alan]] * [[Kipnis, Aaron|Advisor: Kipnis, Aaron]] * [[Koehn, Allen|Advisor: Koehn, Allen]] * [[Lorenz, Helene|Advisor: Lorenz, Helene]] * [[MacWilliams, Deborah|Advisor: MacWilliams, Deborah]] !b * [[Mantecon, Valerie|Advisor: Mantecon, Valerie]] * [[Nelson, Elizabeth|Advisor: Nelson, Elizabeth]] * [[Harry, Polkinhorn|Advisor: Harry, Polkinhorn]] * [[Raff, Jeffrey |Advisor: Raff, Jeffrey]] * [[Romanyshyn, Robert|Advisor: Romanyshyn, Robert]] * [[Rowland, Susan|Advisor: Rowland, Susan]] * [[Selig, Jennifer Leigh|Advisor: Selig, Jennifer Leigh]] * [[Slater, Glen|Advisor: Slater, Glen]] * [[Slattery, Dennis|Advisor: Slattery, Dennis]] * [[Skafte, Dianne|Advisor: Skafte, Dianne]] * [[Stevens, Maurice|Advisor: Stevens, Maurice]] * [[Stevens, Victoria|Advisor: Stevens, Victoria]] * [[Watkins, Mary|Advisor: Watkins, Mary]] * [[Williams, Barry|Advisor: Williams, Barry]] !end %/\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3113901|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=765206571&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Girls are having sex sooner now than in earlier generations (Currie, 1999). Some authors have started to ask girls about their sexual attitudes and experiences (Hass, 1979; Martin, 1996; Ponton, 2000). Because historically, so little attention has been paid to the sexual fantasy and sexual experience of early teens (Tolman, 2002), there is still very little emotional and cultural support an adolescent, parent, or society can turn to when a young female crosses that first sexual threshold. The textual hermeneutic research method with a heuristic inquiry was applied to this topic in order to gather many-sided observations and attitudes about young teen girls and sexual initiations. The dialogue is an exchange between the ideas in mythology, anthropology, sociology, developmental psychology, depth psychology, my own experiences, and discussions with women and teens. Looking further into the experiences of so many young women who have sex at an early age, I am not merely pursuing facts, but hope to conduct an inquiry into the meanings of such significant socially perceived violations. The young women who have crossed this socially discouraged line need to be understood in order to bring honor to their mistakes and their discoveries. My experience as a young female teen who engaged in sexual intercourse gives me a fertile passion and entry into my subject matter. Counseling women and teens for 25 years has sensitized my ears and eyes to the underworld of young female teen sexuality. Listening to and learning from these girls' journeys of forbidden sexuality, one can begin to hear lost fragments in the development of a modern Western culture, to collect and reveal missing pieces from the initiating psyche, and tend the wounded nature of female adolescence and the corresponding wounds of uninitiated elders. Working with and learning from teenagers and grown women who have had sexual intercourse before the age of 15 years sheds light on the mysteries of female sexuality, spiritual longing, psychological individuation, and the climate of North American cultural messages toward women. <<<\n\n/*** |Name|AliasPlugin| |Source|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#AliasPlugin| |Documentation|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#AliasPluginInfo| |Version|1.1.2| |Author|Eric Shulman| |License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements| |~CoreVersion|2.1| |Type|plugin| |Description|Create text-substitution macros| Define macros for abbreviations and other \"aliases\", and then embed them in the rest of your tiddler content to quickly insert common terms, phrases and links without a lot of repetitive typing. !!!!!Documentation > see [[AliasPluginInfo]] !!!!!Revisions <<< 2012.08.10 1.2.0 handle backslash quoting to allow direct use of macro calls in aliases 2009.09.09 1.1.1 'tiddler' arg passed to wikify() so aliases containing macros render with correct context | Please see [[AliasPluginInfo]] for previous revision details | 2005.08.12 1.0.0 initial release <<< !!!!!Code ***/ //{{{ version.extensions.AliasPlugin= {major: 1, minor: 2, revision: 0, date: new Date(2012,8,10)}; config.macros.alias= { }; config.macros.alias.handler = function(place,macroName,params,wikifier,paramString,tiddler) { var alias=params.shift(); if (!alias) return; alias=alias.replace(/ /g,\"_\"); // don't allow spaces in alias if (config.macros[alias]==undefined) { // create new macro (as needed) config.macros[alias] = { }; config.macros[alias].handler = function (place,macroName,params,wikifier,paramString,tiddler) { wikify(config.macros[macroName].text.format(params),place,null,tiddler); } } var t=(params[0]?params.join(' '):alias); // construct paramstring t=t.replace(/\\\\n/g,'\\n').replace(/\\\\t/g,'\\t').replace(/\\\\([<>])/g,'$1'); // fixup escaped chars config.macros[alias].text = t; // set alias text } //}}}\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3281470|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1417798411&Fmt=7&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]) <<< The idea for this dissertation arose out of an image I beheld as a 6 Â½ year old South African child who immigrated to America. The image was of two angels in the snow, lying flat and somber, praying for a savior to help them find their way back home. The snow angels became a metaphor in this dissertation for the profound feelings of loss one experiences when one abandons one's childhood home and enters a foreign land devoid of connection and soul. The angels also serve in this study as an ongoing archetype for the relinquishment of the divine, spiritual realm and the interminable surrendering to the mundane, earthly world. The study addresses the questions: How can poetic images move and sustain us on a depth psychological level, ultimately leading us back home? And, how does one take such poetic visions and link them with academic research? To approach these questions, I chose the artistic method in the form of a memoir, //Angels in the Snow// , and novel, //The Gossamer Thread//, illustrating how both fact and fiction writing can assist in a deep sense of healing and in an exploration of the archetype of home. Both pieces ponder the depth psychological paradox between the conscious and unconscious, between the mundane realm and the imaginal realm, between the human and changeable and the immortal and permanent, and between life and art. Connecting scholastic research with a poetic sensibility required the tools or set of attitudinal skills defined by phenomenological hermeneutics and heuristic inquiry. By emphasizing the philosophy of both of these qualitative methodologies, I was able to link the snow angels within an academic research framework, honoring the lived experience while leaving room for the soul's deepest language, the primordial image. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3302073|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1481660131&sid=23&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< This dissertation is an exploration of Jung's dreams that appear to be about his relationship with the Self as well as the personal history surrounding those dreams. The intent of this exercise is to explore in what ways Jung's dreams in the first and second halves of his life and the experiences associated with these dreams point to his development of the Self concept. After each dream was first explored within its historical context, and Jung's interpretation of the dreams as well as some interpretations of his biographers were considered as well as my own interpretations, it seems that Jung's early childhood experiences as well as his dreams had a great influence on his ideas surrounding the relationship between ego and Self. The exploration also exposed a split in the child archetype that was reflected in Jung's life, his dreams, and even in the interpretations of his dreams and his life. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3029755|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=726045211&sid=3&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]) <<< For over 200 years, Jefferson's black and white relatives and their descendants lived separate existences. The interweavings of the larger family were consciously and unconsciously suppressed within and between each side of the family. This silence and separation contained many wounds. This dissertation explored the soul wounding that has occurred. A phenomenological and heuristic research design was utilized to explore the experience of racial separation among the descendants of Jefferson. What wounds, mythologies, and images still influence their lives? What silences were used to deny that relationship? How can descendants facilitate the recovery from such wounds and create healthy relationships? What insights can depth psychology contribute to the understanding and healing of this woundedness? These questions were addressed by exploring the lived experiences of a sample of 14 self-identified Jefferson's descendants. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with descendants from both the Martha Jefferson and the Sally Hernings, family lines. This researcher's own experience further complemented that understanding. The interview process consisted of two separate dialogues. Both utilized a semi-structured format to allow for the mutual exchange of family history and information. Participants were encouraged to ask any questions they had of this researcher. The participants' experiences portrayed a family legacy of silence, denial, disconnection, and fear that continues to the present day. Images of a void, a lost family, and the forgotten ancestors emerged from the histories of silence. A family paradigm of exclusion acted as an unhealed wound that continues to create barriers between individuals. Many believed that candid dialogue among family members was essential to nurture a new paradigm of inclusion and to facilitate healing. Additionally, a public voice and rituals of remembrance could facilitate the healing of those wounds that separate and alienate this family. The Jefferson family's story also reflects the legacy of racism in America. The family is engaged in personal and collective struggles regarding their history of slavery, their self-acknowledgement to one another, and their respective systems of power. All these issues too remain embedded in the psyche of our country. <<<\n\n<<pl 1330117962>> <<< The chief intention of this work is to bring attention to the importance, influence, and impact of the ancestors in one's existence. In order to achieve this objective, this dissertation undertakes a hermeneutic revision of ancestry which is largely based on the work of four major contributors to the field: Carl G. Jung and James Hillman, two depth psychologists; Bert Hellinger, the developer of the Family Constellations method; and Malidoma SomÃ©, an African elder, diviner, and shaman whose purpose has been to share ancient indigenous spiritual technologies with the western world. My approach is not purely hermeneutic and interpretative, but rather experiential, anecdotal, and inquisitive. Thus, I incorporate ideas and theoretical contributions from old Greek philosophy, phenomenology, Homeopathic medicine, Native American traditions, as well as insights from poetry. Hence, the goal of this study is not merely to develop a psychological view of ancestry, but to awaken an awareness of those deep hidden influences that can shift the perspectives upon which many practices are based, from psychotherapy and social work, to medicine and the healing arts. Rather than establishing fixed and clear conclusions, this weaving of theoretical arguments, therapeutic observations, lived experiences, and practical ideas aims to open a field of studies that can contribute directly to the ways and methods of practicing the healing arts (therapies), the different ways of knowing (epistemologies), and the studies of being (ontologies). <<<\n\n<<pl 304808705>> <<< For thousands of years, human mythology has described encounters with nonhuman intelligences. The mysterious creatures encountered in these anomalous visitations are commonly defined in terms of the cultural norms of the specific group experiencing the encounter. The present dissertation is a textual hermeneutic investigation of various reports of these encounters along with an examination of other researchers' attempts at analyzing the phenomena. This dissertation utilizes a theoretical methodology leaning heavily on the theories of C. G. Jung as an interpretive tool. In addition to Jungian theory, the discourse occurs within a framework of current studies in quantum physics which support many of Jung's ideas. The purpose of this study is to explore how the encounters being reported may be related not only to each other, but to Jungian perspectives of the collective unconscious in general, and of the psychoid in particular. It is hoped that studying this phenomena, using a depth psychological lens, results in an enhanced understanding of the nature and meaning of the apparition experiences. <<<\n\n<<pl 928457972>> <<< Animale-gazing, this inquiryâs defining thematic, is studied as an image arising within the psychotherapeutic milieu. The Latin word, âanimale,â derives from the root anima, or soul, and refers to entities having the breath of life. As such, the term animale is employed to convey equalitarian, psychically animated contact between beings. In general, the research queries the eco-archetypal nature of animale-gazing. More specifically, it asks what further imaginings might be realized or released by the gaze-image, and how might animale-gazing effect eco-consciousness. Guided by the interpretive poetics of alchemical hermeneutics, and through analogy to the shamanic vision quest, this qualitative research explores animale-gazing as a phenomenon that extends beyond perceptual optics. The studyâs essential approach might be described as an eco-archetypal amplification. This methodology tends the animale-gazeâs hidden nature, not only through association with particular ancestral practices and ancient tales, but also via the myths of our time; via the scientific, philosophic, and psychological tenets and cultural ideologies that influence and shape our perceptions. By prolonging the gaze, each chapter opens a space in which the gaze might dream itself along and reveal its conceptual and imaginal relations: reveal its unseen ties. For example, the workâs central chapter delves the analytical, archetypal, ecopsychological, sociological, and mythic dimensions of animale-death-gazing. Overall, animale-gazing emerges as a numinous encounter that attunes to the subtle pulsations and interconnectivities at the heart of earthly life and death. It can be envisioned as a kind of eco-psychical perception characterized by an aesthetic and metaphoric sensibility. As a way of regard that appreciates ecological parity and all that is circuitous and mysterious, it offers a reply to the rationalistic, dualistic, and anthropocentric biases which continue to inhabit depth psychotherapeutic praxis. Imagine: When we animale-gaze, we cultivate eco-consciousness. When we are eco-conscious, we are eco-gazing animales. <<<\n\n<<link 1793571601>> <<< This dissertation addresses the specific text of Antigone , a Sophoclean tragedy, by bringing the characters and the temperament of tragedy into the realm of modern businesswomen. Relying on areas of depth psychology and my own experience as a woman business owner for over 25 years, I believe that the figure of Antigone reveals insights for both women and men in the corporate environment. The central research question of this theoretical work is: How do both the play, Antigone , and the leading figure speak to women in business today, as regards both the individual psyche of women and the more corporate psyche of the business field? The framework is a textual hermeneutic method. Beginning with basic principles from Jungian psychology, the study explores how the anima and animus, along with aspects of the shadow and other archetypal images, interact in both the conflict between Creon and Antigone in the original work, and corporate situations as modern women become more present in the management layers of corporations. It continues with an overview of Jung's psychological types as utilized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which today is frequently applied in business management assessments. The subject of power throughout the original text and the ways in which power affects today's business world are crucial to this study. I include several profiles of modern businesswomen in various degrees of success to determine how power relates to business and also how power is used differently by men and women. The action of this tragedy, especially Antigone's suicide, topples Creon, the despot king, and collapses the government of Thebes. Antigone, who appears to have no power at all, directs the entire tragedy, including the suicides of Haemon, her betrothed, and his grief-stricken mother, Eurydice. When relying on the notion that tragedy is a symbolic space for discovery about both strengths and weaknesses within the human community, the actions and motives of these characters yield rich insights into the way in which people today interact. The result of this study evidences that human behavior, from ancient to modern times, is characterized by corresponding and similar archetypal patterns. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3043117|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=726336621&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< This qualitative study examined the experiences of seven individuals who were participants of the ancient Jewish ritual of divorce (the Get). The study explored the phenomenological experiences of the participants, both what was hurtful, and helpful and healing, to each person in making the transition from married to single life. The literature review focused on the following five areas: the Jewish divorce ritual (the Get); the psychological effects of separation and divorce on adults and children; separation, divorce, and the magic of transformation through suffering; rituals and rites of passage; and the depth psychological perspectives on divorce. Organic research methodology, based on a foundation of phenomenological, heuristic, and feminist research methodologies, was the method of choice because of its unique goals of on-going individual transformation of all the participants of the study (researcher, participants, and readers of the work), and its ability to maintain its reverence for the sacred in the work. Other goals of organic research methodology which were important to this study included grounding the study in the researcher's own story, allowing for the method to evolve creatively as the unconscious process and circumstances of the work unfold, and being fully present when dialoguing with the research participants. The participants' stories were presented individually, in the form of portraits. Following each portrait, the golden threads of wisdom emerging from each participant's story were presented. A brief section relating to how each participant and researcher was affected by participation in the study was also included. Factors common to the healing of all of the participants of the study were outlined. Factors that were found to be most significant and potentially helpful to those within the secular world who are seeking to develop new and creative rituals of divorce were also identified. The tremendous power of archetypal ritual rites of passage to contain and move individuals through the suffering and pain of divorce was demonstrated by the experiences of the participants of this study. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3281474|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1404353831&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]) <<< Human beings have systematically and rapidly engaged in the destruction of the natural world. Since long before modern times, the conscious or unconscious degradation of the environment, with its attendant pollution, atmospheric warming, soil loss, and elimination of species, has been accelerating, and is now climaxing at the most rapid pace ever recorded or studied. Humans are the primary disrupter of the natural balance and we remain as the principal disturbance to the self healing quality of the natural world. People, for the most part, are acting as if this destruction, also known as \"ecocide,\" it is not occurring. Social, economic and political structures both domestically and on the transnational level continue to support the status quo of humanity's destructive patterns. This study uses a depth psychological lens to examine possible root causes of ecocide. It provides a reflective space for discussing the propensity to ecocide in the human psyche, then investigates what distinguishes those who are awake and working to change our current destructive paradigm from those who are asleep and ignoring it. The data source for the study is interviews with eight ecological leaders/activists who have brought the reality of ecocide to consciousness and are working for change. The research methodology used participatory hermeneutics along with a strong heuristic exploration that involve the author's internal personal search including self-dialogue, meditation, introspection, and self-discovery. The study identified three important elements that are essential for the well-being of both the human psyche and the ecologically based soul of the world. The elements are (1) The critical need for the human psyche to have an ego strength with the ability to suffer marginalization, which is developed through the process of individuation as defined by C.G. Jung; (2) the need for an initiation into the dream of the end of the world with the ability to suffer the apocalyptic nature of our present life condition on the planet and act anyway; and (3) the need for a \"re-membering,\" which the author defines as a return to the sacred and reverential worldview in which our story and myth becomes once again immersed into the fabric of creation. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3067642| http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=764991451&sid=4&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< This research explores the experience of individuation for the self-identified gay men interviewed for this study. The study explores the dialectic between who they experience themselves to be versus the stereotypical projection by the patriarchal heteronormative culture in which they are immersed. The stories of each of these men encapsulate a uniquely individual journey from the suffering of dissociated isolation to the compassionate relatedness of connected knowing, a conscious participation and connectedness with a greater archetypal unity than that of their personal self or ego. Rather than a static conclusion or singular place of arrival, these journeys end in the recognition of an ongoing process of becoming. This process required them to develop the ability to tolerate disruption and mess, confusion and disorder in their internal experience as well as their interactions with the world in which they are immersed. It became imperative for them to develop not only the capacity for reflection on their internal intrapsychic processes and the effects that the interactions of their particular archetypal elements and complexes manifest, but also maintain empathy for themselves as they struggle through the resulting chaos. They have had to develop the capacity to hold on to optimism, in the face of withering negativity and opposition, as well as keep up a determined commitment to the ever evolving project of being able to imagine what-could-be-possible in order to discover the path appropriate for them as individuals given the combination of their particular archetypal endowment and personal experiences. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3211958| http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1127209191&sid=5&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< ''Abstract'' This study examined the sources of aliveness at Glide United Methodist Church in San Francisco, California. Glide has a reputation for being extraordinarily alive and vibrant as well as being a source of healing for a strikingly diverse range of people. The methodology followed a participatory hermeneutic approach in which Glide leadership, staff, congregants, clients, and I collaborated in a search to identify and articulate the sources of Glide's aliveness. Through multiple and spiracle conversations with each of 17 co-researchers, my own participatory observations, and a reading of literature related to Glide, a story of aliveness emerged and at its source was Glide's emphasis on recovery. The spirit and work of recovery that permeates every corner of Glide is about regaining our individual and collective wholeness, which we have lost living in a hierarchical and oppressive system that marginalizes far too many people and ways of being. Through the practices and rituals of recovery, Glide members liberate their authentic selves in community with others. The larger story of recovery was presented through the life/recovery stories of co-researchers. Then this story served as the text upon which a depth psychological hermeneutic was conducted using the lenses of Jungian, post-Jungian, post-Freudian, and liberation psychologies. The goal of this hermeneutic was to articulate new insights and additional dimensions of understanding regarding the aliveness at Glide brought about through its emphasis on recovering our individual and collective wholeness. Because this study limited its examination of aliveness to one historically located Christian church, its findings may not be easily generalizable to other churches and organizations. The study does, however, suggest the radically transformative role religious organizations dedicated to individual and collective healing can potentially play in American culture today. It deepens our understanding of the healing role a loving social space&mdash;-with rituals and practices aimed at wholeness&mdash;can have on thousands of lives. It illustrates a structure for religious community that appeals to many who have been alienated by organized religion. And because of these things, it may also inspire other religious organizations to embrace their potential as a vessel for recovery. <<<\n\n<<pl 1468978714>> <<< This dissertation circles around the creation of an arts-based film script entitled \"Behind Locked Doors.\" With a story that is located within a fictional psychiatric hospital, the text includes a number of characters whose psychic wounds allow for a depth psychological exploration into a variety of agitating symptoms: sexual trauma, bereavement, psychosis, grandiosity, narcissism, and multiple personality disorder, among others. The core theme underlying the creative work is that of imagination, especially how it reveals and expresses itself along a twisting ambivalent line between healing and disintegration. Viewing the imaginative function from diverse standpoints as embodied in each character's personality, the dissertation examines how traditional Western pharmaceutical and re-adjustment therapies stack up against more soul-oriented healing methodologies, including Jung's individuation process, Hillman's archetypal psychologizing, Sufi imaginal traditions, and creative play therapies. The literature review and methodology chapters survey the imaginal landscape from hermeneutic, phenomenological, active imagining, carnivalesque, narrative storytelling and arts based traditions, amongst others. Scientific and theological concepts, especially those that incorporate an abundance of imagination, such as cosmological physics and Dante's divine poetic crossing of life and death thresholds, are also explored. The concluding chapter reflects upon similarities between the alchemical process of psychic expansion as revealed in the Rosarium pictures and the film scriptwriting process of discovering transformational images through a long-term steady practice of active imagination. A brief review of popular films that address psychiatric hospital themes and issues rounds off the dissertation. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3318848|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1563029201&sid=22&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Gandhi's injunction, \"You must be the change you want to see in the world,\" inspired this study. It explores the journeys of citizen activists in light of the research question: \"How can a person be the change Gandhi described&mdash;a change that deepens and extends soulful, social responsibility in the culture?\" The study enlists a critical hermeneutic participatory approach to focus carefully on the descriptions of experiences and to discern the connections and common themes among the participants. Eight citizen activists from San Luis Obispo County, California, participated in two sets of one-on-one interviews: an initial series of prepared questions and a follow-up series designed to deepen the dialogue. All participants were adults from age 54 to 81, 4 females and 4 males. Each had at least 7 years of experience in socially or politically active work. The 6 categories of open-ended questions included: early history, turning points or callings, personal development, ways of working with others, taking action, and hopes for the future. The answers revealed common themes as well as differences among the participants. The study showed that people with widely different skills, interests, personality characteristics, and family backgrounds (some supportive and positive and others critical and negative), had similar commitments to social justice, diversity, unity, and interdependence. The themes revealed in this study echo those of earlier studies with some important differences. For example, almost all of the participants in this study reported that the dramatic events of the mid-20 th century (Civil Rights Movement, The Student Movement, Vietnam) had powerful effects on the direction of their lives. They also shared the shaping influence of individual, group, and community therapeutic experiences. The research also suggests that within this group of participants, each had moved toward a psychological integrity that emphasizes reconciliation with and responsibility to the larger natural, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of life. Finally, this study confirms the activist's vital role in creating a new story for ourselves and the future of the planet. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3247249|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1253509631&sid=6&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< In \"Between the Frying Pan and the Fire,\" we engage in an examination of vocational Orphanhood, a call to being an orphan, specifically of clergy who have made or are making a transition out of parish ministry into mainstream life. Definitions of vocation are themselves often distinguished by an affinity with the divine. Being between worlds, intermundia is demonstrated to be synonymous with notions of abyss and Void. Seen in this light, the dynamic images of intermundia, abyss, and Void are understood as that from which potentials might emanate and to which they might return. Our dissertation work, this piece on clergy in intermundia, is itself abyss, Void, intermundia, orphan, vagrant, foreigner/stranger, and alien, deconstructed in its own collapse, its own folding and unfolding. Utilizing a praxis of anamnesis, unforgetting, we deconstruct the deconstruction by approaching this piece Orphically. Through anamnesis, this deconstructive text of re-gard, which in effect is what we both are and do when we realize we are intermundia, re-calls for us the fact that we have forgotten we are ourselves Orphan: outlaw, pervert (thoroughly, entirely, to destruction turned around or turned the wrong way), vagrant, adventurer, hooligan, intermundianaut. This study researches phenomenologically seven members of the clergy who have made or are making the transition out of their respective calls to parish ministry to engage the world as part of the mainstream and find themselves between worlds, intermundia. From these seven portraits, this study moves into re-search through reflection upon their engagement with the numinous through a series of transference dialogues, extending beneath both the complexity of our knowledge and the knowledge of our complexity enfolded by fantasy and reverie. It is an attempt to process the material through an imaginal approach using an alchemical hermeneutic methodology. Finally, an epilogue offers for consideration proposals for an interventionless approach to the intermundia of clergy transitioning out of parish ministry. It is hoped that through this study some transformation may occur. Through our engagement with this material, we may experience an anamnestic shift occurring within our own psyches as the voice of the vocational Orphan makes itself heard within these pages. <<<\n\n<<pl 909870785>> <<< Tracing the origins of symptoms to our personal and immediate family history is commonly accepted in depth psychology. Is it possible that the origins of our wounds and suffering, our dreams and inclinations, are threaded within and through the fabric of our ancestors' lives? Could our bodies be an answer, an offering or sacrifice for the sins of our fathers? The known and unknown stories of our ancestors are present in personal symptoms, disposition, aspirations, and the questions which inform our lives. Within our hopes and traumas lie memories of generations past. Our ancestral and cultural legacies continue living in our bodies, through our relationships, in both matter and the timelessness of psyche. This study explores how conscious, less conscious, and unconsciously shadowed pieces of our personal, ancestral, and cultural stories continue through time, linking us personally in the present moment to the past and calling us into the future. The questions which provide the focus for this inquiry include: what is an individual's experience of being engaged in a more conscious relationship and dialogue with the ancestors? What effect does being in a conscious relationship have in and on the present? For the purposes of this study, ancestors include those we are connected to through our personal lineage, through our collective heritage(s), as well as those who continue to live in the nature and memory of this land. This study creates a bridge between a Western depth psychological research approach and indigenous science to provide the ontological and epistemological foundation for this Organic Inquiry. The research answers its primary questions by presenting the individual stories of five co-researchers, including the primary researcher, who participated in group and individual processes of dialogue with the ancestors for a period of 2 months. In addition, stories created using the autobiographical texts of Linda Hogan (2001), Kat Duff (1993), and Joellen Koerner (2003) are included. A descriptive analysis of some of the observable dynamics which are discernible in these stories is presented as a way to ground the theoretical aspects of the work in lived biographies and ancestral voices. <<<\n\n<<link 1793192981>> <<< Looking into the face of maternal suicide can be a shattering experience. Daughters who live through this event can be left with an underlying malaise, which trespasses onto their personal and professional lives. Other studies have analyzed the potential difficulties or pathologies which may arise following a maternal suicide. This study, by contrast, seeks to review the long-term implications of maternal suicide in a daughter's life, and the extent to which these daughters have been able to reshape their lives and their opinions after such an event has occurred. Using a hermeneutic phenomenology, this study will analyze the experiences of daughters at least four years after maternal suicide. It focuses specifically on the extent to which daughters have been able to generate feelings and experiences of hope, resilience, and novelty in their own lives. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3247247|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1253490951&Fmt=7&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]) <<< One of the fundamental dynamics of human existence is the tension between our need for individuality and our need for community, our need to be apart from others while at the same time having a need to be a part of others. How we navigate the borders between ourselves and others, how rigidly or how flexibly we hold these borders, and where we draw the line between us and them has great significance. Community, a paradoxical and sometimes vague term, is often used to lament what is felt to be missing in our fragmented, postmodern, suburban neighborhoods of America. Cohousing, a type of intentional community that originated in Denmark in the early 1970s, is designed to create and sustain a sense of community. Cohousing's five basic architectural and organizational tenets, which run counter to the traditional American housing values of privacy and ownership, seek to incorporate choice and change, the basic defining values of intentional communities. This study explores the question \"what is the cultural and psychological effect of a cohousing community on its surrounding neighborhood?\" The research is derived from interviews with members of a cohousing community located in a typical American suburb, along with neighbors of the community, and members of two other intentional communities that have significantly different organizational structures. The study revealed shadow aspects of idealism, identity, borders, and trust throughout the cohousing community and the surrounding neighborhood. Elements inherent in the design of cohousing deeply divide members of the cohousing community from each other, as well as from their surrounding neighbors. Although cohousing holds the possibility of providing an experience of community, it is critical to recognize that the essence of community is attitude, not address. To create generative communities there must be involvement, reciprocity, and engagement with the world beyond the borders of the community. Individuals who currently live in cohousing communities and professionals who help create them must address directly the shadow aspects that hinder the full potential of cohousing. Depth psychological personal work is an integral element to develop the individuated capacity for inner connection that is necessary to create community. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3081679| http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=765316281&sid=6&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Underprivileged, Black teenaged girls face the dilemma of becoming pregnant, which transports them from their world of growth into responsibilities of adulthood for which they are unprepared. All too often, these dilemmas result in nearly unbearable suffering and a lifetime of dependency and failure to be integrated into society. Worse yet, the social conditions which result from Black teenage pregnancy tend to perpetuate this problem for the offspring and for further generations. When addressing this problem, I decided to use an artistic methodology, which allowed me the freedom to incorporate heuristic and hermeneutic research while offering personal life stories in the form of memoirs. Initially, heuristic research was the path I had planned to take. But as the process began to work me, I considered hermeneutic research. Once I began to see myself as a part of this work, using an artistic methodology was what I knew I was supposed to do. The artistic method gave me the freedom to tell my story in the memoirs that are a part of this dissertation. Having come in contact with so many Black teens who are considered \"at risk,\" living in group homes, or pregnant, I was able to accept my past for what it was and accept myself for who I used to be. I allowed myself to go through my life using stories and the imaginal, going deep inside and realizing my connection with the girls I have come to know; learning our likenesses and feeling my pain, which is their pain as well. I have needed love from a mother and father that I have never received. These pregnant teens are looking for that identical love. But we all fail to realize that the love we seek is not in our parents, the fathers of our children, or our babies. It lives in the center of our souls. The love we need is the love we've always had. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3035185|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=726124341&sid=3&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< This dissertation investigates the passage of one archetypal symbol&mdash;blood&mdash;through the personal and the collective psyche of the individual and the world. In the context of depth psychology, the soul of an individual lacks corporeality; psyche resides in the mind severed from body. It is my contention that psyche or soul is an active corporeal agent that circulates in the blood, streaming through the body and the entire mental apparatus&mdash;the consciousness as well as the unconscious&mdash;of all beings. From this perspective beings consist of a body and mind that is ensouled. Blood Psychology is a theoretical study which focuses on blood as a powerful archetypal symbol and tracks its flow through the depth psychological landscape&mdash;a terrain that consists of eroticism, ecology, ancient mystery rites and ritual, literary motifs, alchemical symbolism, and the transferential dimension. Thorough studies in these areas suggest that blood correlates with the developmental movement of psyche on the path of individuation. By following the course of blood through history and culture, as archetypal symbol and image active in psyche and world, fascinating information is revealed. A new perspective emerges that applies to the revival of ancient wisdom rooted in the body's biology. The union of biology with depth psychology connects us to a deeper understanding of one collective body, ancestry, and soul. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3029756|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=726041441&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< The modern medical healing arts are caught in the prevailing scientific paradigm of Western culture, functioning with a biomedical science that privileges quantity over quality, fragmentation over wholeness, and matter over spirit. As a result, the emotional, spiritual, and soulful aspects of healing are often neglected. Addressing this schism, medical schools have included the humanities in education, pastoral workers have become active in hospitals, and psychologists tend to patients undergoing somatic care. Meanwhile, individuals have turned to various forms of alternative or complementary medicine, seeking to incorporate life meaning and spirituality within their illnesses and treatments. Although some individual practicing physicians and other healers have tried to include these alternative methods in standard medical practice, most of the members of the medical profession have kept these soulful practices clearly separate from \"scientific\" medical care. Motivated by regrets of my own dissociation of science and spirituality during my years of medical education, training, and practice, I have asked how I might inspire myself and others to build a bridge to connect science and spirituality in the medical healing arts. To approach this question, I chose the artistic method in the form of a series of essays. After constructing a thorough theoretical thematic hermeneutic argument outlining the problem, I chose to express the findings through a series of four confessional essays which tell their stories from the heart as well as the mind. With stories of personal experiences in modern medical care, the essays speak through the voice of both elder physician and fledgling depth psychologist and view modern medicine through the lenses of 20th-century depth psychology and its close relationship with complexity science, and quantum theory. In doing so, the essays begin to construct a bridge over which to bring an outdated biomedical science up-to-date. These essays are the first few stones in the construction of that bridge. <<<\n\nUMI No. [[3084885|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=765369821&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]. <<< This dissertation explores three contemporary borders and takes depth psychology out of the clinical setting and into the multidimensional context of âbody,â of habitat, and of a sense of place. The work of soul calls us to witness, to explore, and to discover fellow participants in the landscape where events reflect the larger story. The research employs tools inherited from depth psychology, the paradigm offered by Process Thought, and understandings from ecology. These tools and understandings offer a perspective for the process of exploring particular border landscapes as a participant. Re-visioning border psyche requires deep listening, unveiling, and mining subterranean levels of the dynamic web of border psyche. Both conscious and unconscious assumptions are explored and unveiled. Images, stories, and events became increasingly animated during the researcher's participation in the particular border landscapes. The research followed cues from the heuristic method, grounded theory, and hermeneutics in its exploration of the three contemporary landscapes. The soul work of re-visioning border psyche called for archetypal activism as described by Hillman (1997) and Aizenstat (1995). The researcher weaves in actual experiences and research as a participant in the three contemporary landscapes. Dream work, interviews, experiences, and theoretical research are integral aspects of the dissertation. An example of what became visible during the research was the illusion and desire for control. The image of flow as well as the natural energy of flow was discovered early in the research as a contrast to actual and psychological walls created by human beings participating in the three border landscapes. It appears that human beings respond to the âother,â such as at the Tijuana/San Diego Border and at the edge of a cliff where the sea meets the cliffs with responses that reflect styles of relating in intimate erotic relationships and intimate erotic relationships challenge couples to intentionally create relationships that are dynamic and that reflect each unique differentiating style and voice. Two theories emerged during the researchâthe embodying process and embodied borders. The two theories offer possibilities for perceiving animated and enchanted aspects of particular border, landscapes. Erotic nature is embraced and soul is experienced. Three illustrations of embodied borders are described in the final chapter. Dynamic life energy cried out for recognition and honor as fellow participants appeared. A way of perceiving beyond dualisms, beyond humano-centrism, and beyond a Euro centric perspective became evident. Embodied borders are profoundly relational, dynamic, and filled with interacting participants. Multiplicities and mysteries abound. <<<\n\n<<pl 1030159086>> <<< Although much of C. G. Jung's work is not compatible with neuroscientific methods or perspectives, his ideas on the structure of the psyche and self overlap with attempts to understand the phenomenon of a self in consciousness through mapping correlates with brain functions and processes. They are therefore appropriate to engage in dialogue with neuroscience. Through these dialogues we can further understand the construction of the self and identity in light of current findings in neuroscience and the theories of C. G. Jung, particularly the collective unconscious and archetypes. In this exploration we discover how the boundaries of the self in the imagination of the psyche are revealed as the horizon of the self in the brain emerges. This dissertation employs a dialectic methodology with a dual-aspect monism and complex systems theory perspective. Dual-aspect monism understands brain and mind as different aspects of the same phenomenon, whereas complex systems theory holds that the emergence of the psyche is of unique integrity and relative autonomy. Research on implicit consciousness and the right brain hemisphere indicates that the subjective experience of the collective unconscious is autonomous and thus outside the boundaries of the ego. Temperamental predispositions manifested through neurobiological profiles are analyzed through Jung's theory of typology, which is found to be the first subjective manifestations of physiological predisposition. A discussion of the role of experience and the external world is provided for balance and clarity in light of the self's construction through the interchange of brain, psyche, and experience. The theory of archetypes is analyzed through a current dialogue within analytical psychology in light of an emergent perspective in neuroscience. Further exploration considers the role of memory as the bridge between neuronal functions of the brain and imaginative functions of the self. Primary conclusions are that identity is the mythic skin of the self, whereas archetypes are emergent symbols of the potential becoming of the self. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3166381|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=885699241&sid=5&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Depth psychologists talk a lot about love, but very little about its mundane sister-practice of caring. Our silence mirrors the silence in the culture, where our unwillingness to care for each other and our earthly home has reached a state of crisis. Psychologist Carol Gilligan noticed the deadly impact of this silence on personal relationships. In our culture, she wrote, we are \"in love with a tragic love story.\" I have extended the reach of Gilligan's complaint from the personal to the cultural/global in order to argue that we are also in love with a tragic story of caring. My question involves how to bring this tragedy to consciousness and creative response, especially given the counterintuitive tendency for discussions on caring to spark into anger and spiral out of control. The issue is not only cloaked, it is cloaked and fiercely defended. People have literally trembled in fury over my attempts to explore the contradictions inherent in the roles of wife and mother. As a consequence, I had to find a methodology that would allow me to explore the nebulous coming-to-consciousness that must happen before creative responses are possible. The methodology I chose is called critical or emancipatory action research, and its most striking characteristic is a focus on the learning that may emerge through multiple and cyclical applications of action-reflection-action-reflection. I pursued this cyclical process with \"invitational\" narratives. Three separate times, I wrote an account of what I thought might be happening in our group and gave it to members for reflection and feedback. Eventually, our dialogue and reflection revealed a particularly poignant paradox: Even caregivers, it seems, host a covert but decidedly individualistic philosophy that sabotages our efforts to care and promote caring. Although it is possible to awaken a sense of this paradox, ultimately this study warns that it does not awaken gently. When it happened for us, the view of Soul was searing. We were neither soothed nor comforted nor inspired to collaborative action. And yet, perhaps, we were changed. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3119796|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=765336621&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< The city has always been many things to many people. As a phenomenon and archetype of collective human experience, the city is universal across all times and cultures. This study imagines the city as a psychological as well as a physical or cultural phenomenon. A desire to step outside the pragmatic and analytical thinking that dominates most contemporary work on cities and the built environment leads to the imaginal psychology of Jung and Hillman. Imagination becomes a way into the work, and a hermeneutic style of inquiry provides a means of working the texts of written material, myth, film, and literature with the stuff of lived experience. Varied themes and phenomena are explored to gain a deeper and more imaginative appreciation of the modern city and its multiple meanings. These include memory and forgetting, losses and memorials, and the quaternity of earth, air, fire, and water. These are explored in the context of cities and contemporary urban life. Troublesome urban symptoms are worked as images and metaphors. These symptoms include sprawl, environmental degradation, traffic congestion, polluted air and water, rampant growth and expansion, the pervasive impacts of technology, and the stifling plethora of regulations and bureaucracy that now plague so much of contemporary urban life. An archetypal psychology framework begins to reveal the presence of what might be imagined as gods and goddesses we have banished from the modern city. The dissertation closes with an inquiry into the presence (or absence) of beauty, and its importance to soul in the city. Unlike most studies on architecture and city planning, this study attempts to leave space for the personal and subjective in exploring multiple ways of understanding the city. I strive here to invite voices heard rarely in architecture and city planning: the more liquid voices of feeling, sensuality, and depth of lived experience&mdash;all of which invoke the shadowed presence of soul. That voice, wholly Other to contemporary narratives on the city, invites imaginal presences into the work. A second voice begins to speak through what would otherwise be solely a pragmatic or academic work. This is an attempted move toward integration and wholeness, at least partially dissolving the modern split between outer city and inner psyche. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3238862|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1251811991&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< The purpose of this dissertation is to delve into the roots of the historian's imagination. There is abundant evidence that many students hate history, considering it an irrelevant and boring subject with no connection to life. Working as a high-school history teacher for 20 years, I have been perplexed by the disconnect between the exciting creative process of writing history and the tedium of the experience of learning history for most high-school students. When educational theorists translate the process of creating history into the classroom they neglect the unconscious sources of inspiration which drive the call to write history. Fear causes many historians and educators alike to stay away from dreams, trance states, and visions. The problem is examined through a thematic, hermeneutic analysis of scholarly and literary texts during the creative phase of historical research. First the archetypal figures behind the creation of history are examined. These include Clio, muse of history in ancient Greece, and the griots or oral historians of ancient Africa. Next the experiences with historical imagination of depth psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung are used as a starting place for examining the memoirs of historians such as Arnold Toynbee, Richard Cobb, Simon Schama, Susan Griffin, and Aurora Morales. These are historians who dare to embrace the unconscious in their writing. The major idea developed is that dreams, trance states, and visions are an important but often unacknowledged part of the creative process for an historian. They often contain the seed which will germinate into a lifetime of historical research and writing. The final part of this dissertation carries the research forward into the history classroom. Building on my experiences with the nonprofit organization, Facing History and Ourselves, practical examples of history lessons are given. Their aim is to cultivate historical imagination, bringing history alive for students and creating an antidote to the boredom of textbook history. <<<\n\nBackground: #fff Foreground: #000 PrimaryPale: #8cf PrimaryLight: #18f PrimaryMid: #04b PrimaryDark: #014 SecondaryPale: #ffc SecondaryLight: #fe8 SecondaryMid: #0D86DF SecondaryDark: #841 TertiaryPale: #eee TertiaryLight: #ccc TertiaryMid: #999 TertiaryDark: #666 Error: #f88\n\n{ config.options.chkAnimate=false; config.options.chkBackstage=false; config.options.chkSliderOptionsPanel=false; config.options.txtFontSize=\"100\"; config.options.txtMainTab=\"Timeline\"; config.options.txtMoreTab=\"Shadowed\"; config.options.chkDisableNonExistingWikiLinks=true; config.options.txtMyTabset=\"2010\" }\n\n<<link 2115608721>> <<< Traveling the long and narrow footpaths that defines the intersection between celestial and terrestrial experiences in a modern world, this dissertation explores how human beings living in these times can tend to the work of their daily lives while staying deeply connected to the Divine, accessible through the range of lived experiences. Working within the spaces ruled by the gods Chronos and Kairos and the way they manifest, this work was guided by a central dream image that opened into what Henri Corbin (1972), the Sufi scholar, refers to as the intermediary world or the //Mundus Imaginalis//. Employing an intuitive inquiry research methodology, allowing for authentic experiences to be analyzed and these realms to be traveled, synchronicities were able to emerge. This research followed a carefully described approach to analyze experiences of this nature. A wide variety of mediums were incorporated to glean the data, including art, dreams, geographical inquiry, and extensive work with the imaginal. True to the process of Intuitive Inquiry, the author coded and tracked her experiences, integrating them using a grid suggested by Arnold Mindell's (1998) work on intuitive channels. The research was, for the author, a search and recovery journey of the Self and in turn a model of ways to find the often hidden coordinates and waypoints to the numinous world embedded in the ordinary. A newly realized image of divinity is peeking though the veil to this heavenly world, as seen in the \"Flammarion Woodcut\" of 1888. This dissertation has been a tribute to the humble pursuit of the thinly veiled footpath that separates the ordinary from the extraordinary and the meaningful ways to integrate the two realms. <<<\n\n<<pl 1269531587>> <<< This dissertation focuses on creating dances from dreams. The researcher's personal dreams are the central focus of the choreography that her college dance company performed as a main stage dance production. Hermeneutical phenomenology was the method used to address the primary research question: what is the lived experience of embodying dream images in choreography? The answer to this inquiry came through the interplay of the dreams and field notes of the researcher/choreographer, the researcher's facilitation of interviews with the dancers, and the thought letters of performers and audience members. The second question&mdash;how this process might contribute to our understanding of dreams as a creative resource&mdash;explored the creative potential of pursuing the central image of a dream through dance and, thereby, embodying the unconscious through choreography. This research determined that there is a relationship between dreams and dance. The image that defined the dream drove the dance, which made a powerful impression on all involved, addressing the third inquiry: What does enhancing the relationship with the unconscious by embodying dream images offer the choreographer, dancers, and audience? Each of these participants resonated with the imagery derived from big dreams and voiced a personal answer to this question in the body of the dissertation. The data collected from the dancers and audience members indicated that many felt they benefited from the visceral, embodied approach to addressing that which is terrifying. By dancing archetypal images, the unspeakable became less overwhelming and the impact of the archetype was extended beyond the personal into the communal. This research is a conversation between depth psychology and dance performance that mindfully taps the unconscious for images and discusses the process of transforming the unconscious into concert dance. The intention is to offer an intuitive guide for negotiating the terrain between the dream image and the creative process that consciously dialogues with the unconscious through dance improvisation. What is most relevant about this creative dissertation is the embodied manner in which depth psychological material is explored and communicated nonverbally to the community. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3211954|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1127197451&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=6993&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Creativity, the ability to bring something new into existence, has allowed humankind to attain its highest achievements. Looking into the lives of those honored as highly creative, however, we often find individuals who are also considered to be disturbed, and studies abound indicating a disproportionately high concurrence of creativity and psychopathology. Must we accept that there is something intrinsic to the creative process that links it to mental illness? Or might there be other relevant considerations, possibly overlooked until now, that could help us understand the high incidence of psychopathology among creative individuals? Employing a thematic, hermeneutic method that contains also a heuristic component, this theoretical dissertation proposes to bring to light a phenomenon that our culture has overlooked until now, creative flooding . Consider the following chart: | Creatively Blocked | &nbsp;&nbsp;Manageable Flow of Creativity&nbsp;&nbsp; | Creative Flooding | | Less flow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&larr;| &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; I &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; | &rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More flow | The individual at left is creatively blocked . There is no creative flow. At center is a person experiencing a manageable flow of creativity . Finally, consider a person experiencing creative flooding , where the increase in creative flow becomes overwhelming, no longer manageable. It is important to emphasize that creative flooding is not caused by disturbing or emotionally upsetting ideas. All of the creativity is positive and useful. At issue is the overwhelming too muchness of what this person must deal with. Unfortunately, within our culture, although extensive attention is given to increasing creativity, complaining about having \"too much creativity\" is considered inappropriate, in bad taste. Unrecognized and without assistance, the creatively flooded are eventually overwhelmed. This dissertation employs depth psychological principles to understand the creative process and the experience of creative flooding using the experiences of several artists as its data. Rather than perpetuating the practice of Western science, which merely pathologizes symptoms and then attempts to medicate them away, this work proposes that creative flooding can be understood as a subset of experiences which Grof (1990) calls spiritual emergencies . As it explores new insights and strategies for supporting this previously overlooked population, our culture and those who are creatively flooded will both be offered an opportunity to enjoy the fruits of full creative lives. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3128814|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=765942181&sid=6&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Jesse Jackson once said of Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Thinking about him is like thinking about the prism....You know there is another set of rays, and as many angles as you think about Dr. King, there is yet another set of angles with which to analyze him.\" Though King has been analyzed in detail from the angle of his leadership abilities, his social and historical legacy, his philosophical beliefs, his rhetorical and oratorical skills, and his theology, he has never before been analyzed in detail from the angle of depth psychology. The purpose of this dissertation is twofold: to see King in the light of depth psychology's rays, and to see depth psychology in the light of King's rays. Stated another way, depth psychology has much to offer to an understanding of King, but an understanding of King has just as much to offer to depth psychology. This study offers some answers and interpretations to the following questions: how aware was King of psychology and its principles? Which of those principles did he use to effect cultural transformation? What are the parallels between King's work with the nation, and a therapist's work with a client? In what ways did he embody a therapeutic attitude and ethos? How was King like Jung's \"great personality\": someone who \"acts upon society to liberate, to redeem, to transform, and to heal?\" What myths did King enact, what projections did he carry, and how did those myths and projections affect him? Finally, what insights can depth psychology glean from analyzing King, particularly as they relate to the alchemical process of cultural transformation and healing? The method for such a study is interpretative inquiry, defined by Martin J. Packer as an approach which opens up a perspective and articulates an accounting of a phenomenon. Packer states that the goal to which interpretive inquiry is ultimately directed is not just one of \"mirroring reality in a descriptive account, but of changing it for the better in some way.\" Thus, I make plain my hope that through this work, my readers will better understand the psychological nature of cultural transformation and healing and will incorporate that deeper understanding into their own interpretations and actions, with the ultimate hope of changing the world (and depth psychology) for the better. <<<\n\n<<pl 1239211715>> <<< This dissertation is a hermeneutic and heuristic study of methods experienced by Jewish and (non-Jewish) German descendants of the Holocaust to re-pair their severely ruptured relationships. It seeks to discover ways to create new compassionate relationships following the inhumane treatment and atrocities suffered during World War II. The research begins with a survey of methods used to re-pair relationships. Next, it more deeply explores and critically evaluates three types of cultural therapy, compassionate listening, One-by-One dialogue groups, and systemic constellations, which have been used to re-pair Jewish-German descendant relationships. The source of the research data includes websites, scholarly essays, nonfiction scholarly books, brochures, and testimonials describing the history, philosophy, techniques, and outcomes of the three methods. A further source of data is the critical evaluation and psychological insights drawn from the researcher's own experiences of the three methods as recorded in written journal entries and e-mails. The two data sources are clearly differentiated so that this project is credible while allowing another researcher to design and conduct future studies. The work concludes with a depth psychological discussion of the possibilities for re-pairing Jewish-German relationships, suggestions for additional research, and the researcher's creative synthesis that lays the foundation for a proposed group process based on the evaluation of compassionate listening, One-by-One dialogue groups, and systemic constellations. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3025063|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=725975021&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< This dissertation is an attempt to investigate the nature of the interactive field to deepen as well as broaden its scope as it applies to depth psychology and its praxis. With a phenomenological eye toward field dynamics from other paradigms, this exploration demonstrates an additional theoretical framework within the interactive field. It opens other possibilities creating a neither/nor position from which to contain our work with an alchemical/metaphorical position and allows for the liberation of the imaginal realm through which \"the Other\" may be of service, and in fact, may ask us to be in service to it. The literature review not only surveys the three primary schools in psychology&mdash;the psychoanalytical, the classical, and archetypal as the genesis of the interactive field, but also investigates shamanic realms as a backdrop from which to see field theory. Field theory is also explored in the world of quantum physics where the universal field is examined from paradigms situated in varied consciousness models. The somatic unconscious, an intrinsic part of the interactive field in mutual engagement with two or more persons, is also woven into the fabric of this study as an intersection between the universal field and the psychodynamic field. This study, as a psychological gnosis, initiates subtle body awareness from Eastern cosmologies from a depth perspective in the psychodynamics of the interactive field. Synchronistic encounters are integrated into field theory as a threshold where universal fields engage the somatic unconscious, initiating numinous and sometimes transformative change into one's life. <<<\n\n(Publication No. AAT [[3029756|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1031062721&sid=1&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< For 5 years, I taught creative writing in a California state men's prison. This was a searing personal journey and an eye-opening look into correctional dynamics, the psyche of the criminal, and the social and cultural factors underlying criminality, leading to a reimagining of the penal institution. This phenomenological and hermeneutical account honors image, poetry, memoir, and dream as modes for gaining insights into the personal and cultural dilemma that is prison, and explores the texts of the history of that investigation. Through the archetypal lens of the myth of Persephone, the prison is viewed as underworld/Hades/Hell, as seen by the men imprisoned there. Beyond the reach of most constructive influences, and thoroughly marginalized, like ghosts and shades, they are a population of invisibles&mdash;and thus, their association with Hades, the invisible god of the underworld. Bringing to light deeply buried, often scarifying, life experiences through creative writing, we began to witness an unimaginable reality: within an institution built on the punitive premise of separation, isolation, and hatred, we were present at the epiphany of Eros. An account of how this came to be, of the archetypal energies involved, and of implications for the correctional system makes up half the body of this work. A parallel inquiry into the nature of the Persephonic, or medial, woman&mdash;how her character is formed, how she accesses information through intuition and dream, her propensity for descent&mdash;supplies the other half. Within the closed and pressurized alchemical vas hermeticum of the prison, we encountered energies similar to those of the ancient Mystery schools of Greece, or in traditional shamanic cultures, and witnessed a profound paradox: in underground dimness, light began to manifest. We had discovered those conditions under which love might alight upon us and remain within us, even in the heart of darkness. <<<\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3247243|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1253484761&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]] ). <<< The primary purpose of this dissertation, whose Latin title is a prayer to Priapus meaning \"I owe you nothing,\" is to initiate a missing discourse within archetypal psychology: the subject of sexual identity. In this theoretical work, I attempt both to analyze this lacuna and demonstrate&mdash;through exegesis of the macrophallic image embodied by the god Priapus, the novel Satyricon and the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch&mdash;how archetypal psychology can be brought more into dialogue with poststructural discourses relevant to sexuality, including queer theory, for the sake of mutual enrichment. Fundamental to this effort are two subsidiary purposes. First, by discussing the construction of queer sexual identity, I demonstrate that studying the actual historical contexts of myths may reveal to us material occluded by a strictly psychological or mythopoetic analysis. In this case, I demonstrate that the modern definition of homosexuality is a conflation of categories whose repression, imaged in the macrophallus, returns to disrupt the dominant culture's effort to pathologize sexuality other than heteronormative types. Thus, my second subsidiary purpose is a more general demonstration of the way treating images purely as metaphors disembodies them&mdash;from the literal personal flesh and from the \"flesh\" of historical context. The latter in turn actually helps perpetuate and internalize the institutions of the dominant culture&mdash;in this particular case, patriarchy and homophobia&mdash;and tends to render archetypal psychology (or any other similarly self-limiting discourse) archaic in this context, even though one of its agendas is to move psychology out of the consulting room into the polis. The dissertation concludes with a recommended postmodern aesthetic method of imaginal psychology that values metaphor, image, and myth but does not ignore their historical contexts, in either cultural or personal terms. Employing Hillman's discourse on the fiction of case history, I demonstrate, in the Appendix, an aesthetic therapeutic method which also serves the purpose of completing the hermeneutic circle by disclosing my own projected Priapus complex in undertaking this study. <<<\n\n[[by Author]]\n\n<<link 1941994581>> <<< In this phenomenological hermeneutic study, seven mothers and one father shared stories of how they experienced daughter abduction. These included daughters who had been abducted through sexual and physical abuse, misguided religious teachings, drug addiction, mental illness, and untimely death. While conducting the interviews and reviewing the results, I imagined the experience of daughter abduction to be a tsunami, or terrifying, life-threatening storm at sea which tosses the ship, or the psyche of the parent, from the sea of life onto an unknown and barren island. I organized the emergent data into four themes and subthemes related to the metaphor of tsunami: (1) Wreck (with subthemes of Warning and Cracking), (2) Between Worlds, (with subthemes of Chase, Beached, Wrestling with God, Taking Care of Business, and Dry Grief, (3) Picking Up Pieces, with subthemes of Life, Body/Mind, Nature and God, and (4) Return with subthemes of Angels, the Daughter's Return to the Mother, and the Mother's return to the World. Using these themes as a template, I read through the mythological story of daughter abduction in Helene P. Foley's translation of The Hymn to Demeter (1994) to see if and where these themes from modern life might be represented and what further information and insights might be gleaned from this ancient story of daughter abduction. In an effort to find deeper, fuller, and more internal meaning to the experience of daughter abduction, I looked at the myth of Demeter and Persephone through the lens of Jung's concept of individuation where I found parallel themes and subthemes to that of the shipwreck in the sea of life located in the participants' stories. A summary of the findings from the three sources illustrate newly found interpretation, depth, and meaning to the myth of Demeter and Persephone and how the story continues to play in the modern world. <<<\n\n<<pl 858606781>> <<< How do 8 former Catholic nuns who are members of a traditional canonical religious community for women and who work within the patriarchal/ecclesiastical structures of the Catholic Church develop a critical consciousness of authority while pursuing the call of vocation to religious life? This study examines 4 facets of this question. First, this study focuses on patriarchy and genderism as we enter the second decade of the 21st century. Second, it focuses on some of the ways women develop a strong sense of self and agency given the realities of patriarchal tenets and traditional structures of authority. Third, it is interested in learning how women receive and construct knowledge. Fourth, it looks with a discerning eye to retrieve and preserve critical moments of history when women successfully resisted gender oppression and injustice. This study, which takes advantage of the traditions and methodologies provided within the evolving frameworks of depth and liberation psychology, including a feminist orientation towards research, is divided into two phases: conducting 8 individual interviews to gather the participants' oral histories and a modified critical hermeneutical participatory group process that brought together participants and members of a Witness Council in a 4-hour dialogical format. This study answers its primary research questions by providing insight into the internal and external factors that inspired 8 former Catholic nuns to challenge the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, to choose to surrender their canonical status within the Church, and to form a lay ecumenical community for Catholic-Christian women and men. The participants' negotiation of these historical encounters required shifts in their attitudes and beliefs about women's authority within patriarchal, hierarchical, and ecclesiastical systems. Following the results, the author applies theoretical constructs to the research findings. From depth-liberation psychology, the author interprets the results through Freirian theories of conscientization and the ontological call of humanization. Through the lens of psychoanalytical social theory, the author places the models of Julia Kristeva and Kelly Oliver in dialogue with the participants' experiences. <<<\n\n/*** |Name|DisableWikiLinksPlugin| |Source|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#DisableWikiLinksPlugin| |Version|1.6.0| |Author|Eric Shulman - ELS Design Studios| |License|http://www.TiddlyTools.com/#LegalStatements <br>and [[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 License|http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/]]| |~CoreVersion|2.1| |Type|plugin| |Requires|| |Overrides|Tiddler.prototype.autoLinkWikiWords, 'wikiLink' formatter| |Options|##Configuration| |Description|selectively disable TiddlyWiki's automatic ~WikiWord linking behavior| This plugin allows you to disable TiddlyWiki's automatic ~WikiWord linking behavior, so that WikiWords embedded in tiddler content will be rendered as regular text, instead of being automatically converted to tiddler links.

The study of trauma and its effects on the psyche, more specifically on children's developmental process, emerged. The analytic understanding of trauma has tended to dismiss the relevance and, to a degree, the importance of actual memory but rather delves more deeply into the nature of the unconscious (both personal and collective) as an individuation process that leads to healing and wholeness. A Hermeneutic method of research weaves the concept of the healing of trauma and its impact on children with the acceptance of past events and acknowledgement of the symbolic offerings of Nature. It offers understanding of how an alchemical relational vessel promotes the above healing to advance to a soulful connection with the universe. A heuristic style is employed at times as an illustration of how the hypothesis can be explored. Stories from film, literature, mythology, and case examples provide the basis of understanding for the concept. The problem of how some children are able to survive horrific childhoods and live fruitful and enriching lives is the focus of the study. Through working with three symbols&mdash;the horse, the dolphin, and the tree, the dissertation explores how Nature offers nurture and protection to children and adults in treatment. The questions that are addressed pertain to gaining an understanding of how Nature (the Great Mother) assists in the healing of traumatic wounds. Both schools of thought, abuse-focused therapy and the analytic approach, offer important insights and theories. It is suggested that symbolic reality and the world of the imaginal creates a field of dialogue and alchemical relationship that supports and encourages trust and an awareness of the numinous. An incidental finding that emerged indicates how symbols not only heal but call those who have been healed to a greater consciousness of the struggle of the collective. <<<\n\nAdvisor: +++^[Stephen Aizenstat] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Stephen Aizenstat\" ' >> === +++^[Joseph Coppin] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Joseph Coppin\" ' >> === +++^[Lionel Corbett] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Lionel Corbett\" ' >> === +++^[Veronica Goodchild] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Veronica Goodchild\" ' >> === +++^[Helene Lorenz] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Helene Lorenz\" ' >> === +++^[Robert Romanyshyn] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Robert Romanyshyn\" ' >> === +++^[Mary Watkins] <<forEachTiddler where ' store.getValue(tiddler,\"Advisor\") == \"Mary Watkins\" ' >> ===\n\n<<forEachTiddler where 'tiddler.tags && tiddler.tags.length' sortBy 'getSortedTagsText(tiddler)+\"###\"+tiddler.title' script 'function getSortedTagsText(tiddler) {var tags = tiddler.tags; if (!tags) return \"\"; tags.sort(); var result = \"\"; for (var i = 0; i < tags.length;i++) {result += tags[i]+ \" \";} return result;} function getGroupTitle(tiddler, context) {if (!context.lastGroup || context.lastGroup != getSortedTagsText(tiddler)) { context.lastGroup = getSortedTagsText(tiddler); return \"* {{{\"+(context.lastGroup?context.lastGroup:\"no tags\")+\"}}}\\n\";} else return \"\";} ' write 'getGroupTitle(tiddler, context)+\"** [[\" + tiddler.title+\"]]\\n\"' >>\n\n<!--{{{--> <div class='toolbar' macro='toolbar +saveTiddler -cancelTiddler deleteTiddler'></div> <div class='title' macro='view title'></div> <div class='editor' macro='edit title'></div> <div class='editor' macro='edit text'></div> <div class='editor' macro='edit tags'></div><div class='editorFooter'><span macro='message views.editor.tagPrompt'></span><span macro='tagChooser'></span></div> <div macro=\"showWhen tiddler.tags.contains('Depth Psychology')\"> Author: <span macro=\"edit au\"></span><br> Year: <span macro=\"edit yr\"></span><br> Advisor: <span macro=\"edit advisor\"></span><br> Methodology: <span macro=\"edit methodology\"></span><br> External reader: <span macro=\"edit externalreader\"></span> </div> <!--}}}-->\n\n(Publication No. [[AAT 3318835|http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1562574431&sid=2&Fmt=2&clientId=45844&RQT=309&VName=PQD]]). <<< Like many other disciplines, psychology is evolving into a new paradigm and struggling to break free from models of separation. The process of separation from self from an other is a core process intrinsic to living, but how this happens and where difference is experienced is highly culturally determined. It also can be seen as a generating process defining individual ethics. However, as C. G. Jung and Simone Weil observed, differencing can become a political weapon of the collective to obliterate those defined as Others.
