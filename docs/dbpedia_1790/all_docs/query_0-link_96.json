        "text": "So…\n\nHere are all the chapters in the Predator series, as well as Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, all wrapped up in one giant burrito. I’ve made a few changes and additions along the way, mainly to smooth transitions and to better integrate Beyond into the main story arc.\n\nThis was not the initial intent, however, so the two will, I think, reside side by side rather uneasily. And I wouldn’t be surprised if I come back to this one oneday, make a few tweaks here and there. It’s not finished yet, really, but what really ever is? As she stands, about 240 pages, single spaced, and I’ve divided the tale into Parts and Chapters.\n\nIf you’ve just finished reading the original (parts of the) story, I’m not sure you’ll find enough new material to justify the time, but who knows what works best on a rainy Sunday afternoon?\n\n+++++\n\nPredators\n\nPart I – Shadows Beyond the Reef\n\nChapter 1\n\nDallas\n\nHe was about forty, forty five years old, very tall, almost gaunt, and not very well groomed. The man was, in every way imaginable, a slothful looking creature, yet in a soiled, potbellied way, and he was wearing greasily tattered green chinos and an old, plaid short-sleeved shirt – not quite tucked-in all the way. His sneakers were foul looking and, to anyone unlucky enough to get close enough, truly foul smelling. Officer Amy Breedlove watched the suspect through binoculars from an unmarked patrol car, a battered, twenty-six year old Pontiac Grand Am coupe that had, once upon a time, been painted a nice, bright silver. She was parked beside a fragrant trash dumpster off Harry Hines Boulevard, deep inside the industrial wastelands of central Dallas, Texas, in an almost war-torn district full of taquerias, strip joints, peep shows and barren industrial warehouses. She had been following this ‘perp’, a 45 year old habitual offender named Bruce Walker, for three days – ever since CID had received an anonymous tip that Walker was downloading kiddy porn from the so-called ‘dark web’ – and that he had been roaming around schools and playgrounds. Walker had been released from from federal prison a month ago, and as a registered pedophile-rapist, local law enforcement had been tasked with keeping an eye on him.\n\nYet here he was in an area full of homeless addicts, scabby-legged hookers and tired old gays cruising glory holes for their next load – and not working the parks and playgrounds the detectives in CID were hoping for. Still, Breedlove had her orders – document all his activities – so she pulled a battered old Canon 1Ds from the seat beside her and slapped a 400/5.6 on it, then swung it to her face. She lightly depressed the shutter and centered his face in the viewfinder, then fired off a five frame burst when his face was clearly visible, then she snapped a few of the adult bookstore he was coming out of.\n\nIt was around two in the afternoon, two hours to shift change, and it was hotter than hell outside – maybe ‘110 in the shade’ hot, and of course the air conditioner in this stinking, fucked-up old car had seen better days – ‘like maybe ten years ago,’ she thought. Breedlove was baking in the afternoon heat, and with summer thunderstorms brewing sweat had been pouring down her neck for hours; now it was running down her back, and she wanted an ice cold Coke in the worst sort of way. She leaned forward and tried to pull her water-logged bullet-proof vest away from her skin, sure the goddamn thing was adding about ten extra degrees to her internal temperature, when she caught sight of really odd looking person following the suspect.\n\n“What the fuck! Is that – a woman?”\n\nThe woman was short, dressed in black fatigues – including a black hood covering her head – and every instinct Breedlove had screamed “wrong!” – that this woman was not simply following the suspect, she was stalking him – like a predator. Breedlove raised the camera to her face, fired off a long burst of the woman, but just then the woman stopped, turned and looked directly at her unmarked car. Breedlove instinctively fired off a burst with the Canon – and perhaps sensing this, the woman turned and disappeared in the shadows between two warehouses. Breedlove noted the time and location on her notepad, started the engine and slowly made her way over to the area where she had seen both the suspect and the woman, and when she came up empty she started to drive around the area, looking for any trace of either.\n\n“I don’t fucking like this,” Breedlove said to the hot air in the car, so she picked up the mic dangling from the radio and pushed the transmit button:\n\n“317 to 310 on two,” she said, calling the district patrol sergeant on the tactical frequency.\n\n“310, go head.”\n\n“Uh, 310, I’ve got a female over here in what looks like black fatigues, including a hood, following a signal 7 suspect.”\n\n“317, what’s your 20?”\n\n“Harry Hines at Freewood.”\n\n“10/4. 247, are you clear yet?” the sergeant said on the primary frequency.\n\n“247 to 310, 10/4, clearing now.”\n\n“247, back up 317, Harry Hines at Freewood on a signal 13. Contact 317 on Tac2 for more information.”\n\n“247, code 5.”\n\n“Central received, 247 en route at 1420 hours.”\n\nBreedlove circled the area, was driving north on Harry Hines when she saw someone running west from a Church’s Chicken a block ahead, so she jumped on the accelerator.\n\n“317 to 247, got the suspect running west on Mrytle Springs, away from the chicken place, black fatigues, black hood, looks like a large knife or machete in hand.”\n\n“10/4, almost code 6.”\n\n“310 to Central, get me some units heading to 317s location, and notify CID.”\n\n“Central received at 1422 hours.”\n\n“317, suspect running south on Maybank, through the trees!”\n\n“247, code 6 in the area.”\n\n“247 at 1426 hours.”\n\n“247, this is 310 and I’m about a minute out.”\n\n“Received, uh, 247, Signal 33, officer down, repeat, 33, officer down on, on Maybank, just south of Myrtle Springs…”\n\n“310, get air support headed this way, and all responding units go Code 3, now!”\n\n“1426 hours.”\n\n“310, code 6, oh, crap! 310, two officers down, repeat two down! I want a full tactical callout, now! Advise Watch Commander…oh, shi…”\n\n“310, received at 1427 hours.”\n\n“141, Code 6 in the area.” ‘141’ was Ben Acheson, a traffic officer a motorcycle cop, assigned to the northwest district that day, and as he was close when the call came out, he headed to the area to provide extra back-up. He was the next unit to roll up on the scene, and he nearly lost it when he saw the carnage in the street.\n\nHe jumped off his BMW R-1200-RT-P motorcycle and let it fall to the ground while he drew his Sig-Sauer P-226 from his holster and covered the scene.\n\n“141, I’ve got three officers down, decapitated, no suspect in sight.”\n\n“141 at 1429 hours.”\n\nAcheson kept his 9mm moving, his senses acutely tuned to pick up the slightest sight or sound, but all he heard now was a rolling avalanche of sirens, then a helicopter overhead. Within a minute he was relieved to hear a herd of patrol cars approaching, and he knew a mobile Command and Control Unit would be on the scene soon. He holstered his weapon and walked over to the three slain officers; their bodies were artificially positioned, leaning against one another, the heads placed neatly in their laps, and he fell to his knees and vomited, just as the first back-up units screeched to stop behind him.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAcheson could hear several helicopters over the crime scene now, and he knew the entire area was being cordoned off as detectives and Crime Scene Units from the department arrived. He saw techs from the Medical Examiner’s office looking over the bodies and his stomach lurched again. Looking around, Acheson guessed there were more than fifty patrol cars searching the area now, and news helicopters were circling overhead too. He poked his head in Breedlove’s unmarked car, looked it over, read her notes, and walked back to his BMW. Now he was trying to re-trace Breedlove’s route from where, he’d read on her notepad, she’d first sighted the female suspect.\n\nHe circled around a particularly seedy area on Harry Hines, a bunch of bunch of small businesses just south of Lombardy Lane, looking at a cluster of adult bookstore/video arcades that were usually full of gays, and worn-out hookers, worshipping cock on their knees, when he thought he saw something odd behind a tire store on the corner. He motored over and saw a leg sticking out from behind a pile of old, discarded truck tires, and got on the radio.\n\n“141, out on a possible Signal 1 at 10499 Harry Hines, believe this is related to 317s case.”\n\n“141 at 1455 hours.”\n\n“105, get some backup and CID over there, Code 3!”\n\n“1455 hours, 309, 315, respond Code 3 to 10499 Harry Hines, at Lombardy, back up 141 on a possible Signal 1.”\n\nAcheson got off his bike and walked over to the tires, looked down and suddenly felt like vomiting again. There on the ground lay what was left of an old man, his head severed and his green pants pulled down past his knees. The man’s penis had been cut off, his abdomen cut open from the sternum to the pubic area, and his intestines were spread out randomly on the dirty concrete. He walked around the tires, heard sirens closing in on his position when he found the man’s head.\n\nAcheson fell to his knees again and vomited uncontrollably when he saw what he assumed was the man’s severed penis lodged in a hideously contorted mouth.\n\nChapter 3\n\nCaptain John Wayne Dickinson, usually called “The Duke” by his team in CID, or the Criminal Investigations Division, was in charge of the Breedlove investigation, and he was tired, dog-tired, having been at the scene on Maybank since late afternoon – the day before. He picked up another glazed donut and took it down in one bite, then downed a pint of ice cold milk in one long pull.\n\n“Look, I want to get some sleep sometime this month,” he said as he looked over the crime scene photographs one more time, “so let’s summarize what we know so far.\n\n“First, Breedlove was assigned to tail this perp, Walker, and had been for three days;\n\n“Second, she had him near the cum-palaces on Harry Hines, south of Lombardy;\n\n“We also know she was detailed to photograph the perp, so she had one of the department’s Canons with her, a 1Ds with a 200 macro and a 400, and those are both missing;\n\n“Third, she calls-in and advises she has a suspicious person, dressed in some sort of black, maybe a ninja-style get-up, stalking the perp, this Walker guy…\n\n“So, do we assume she got some images of this suspect?”\n\nThe Duke looked around his briefing room.\n\n“Sounds reasonable to me,” Ben Acheson said.\n\n“Remind me, Officer Vomit, just why you’re here?”\n\n“Watch Commander assigned me, sir, in case I can fill in any gaps.”\n\nThe Duke sneered derisively. “Fine, but if you barf on my floor, you’ll be working Animal Control for the next five years. Got it, Meathead?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“Well, again, assume she got some images of the suspect, as well as the perp she was tailing. So, where does that leave us?”\n\nThe Duke looked around the room. “Anyone have any ideas?”\n\n“I do,” Acheson said.\n\n“I don’t give a fuck if you do or don’t, Meathead. Anyone else?”\n\nThe room was silent.\n\nThe Duke fumed.\n\n“Okay, Meathead, let’s hear it.”\n\n“Well, okay, assume she shoots them both, but the suspect sees her with the camera. Taking her photograph, that is. If that’s the case, it seems to me the suspects first priority would be to recover the camera, get the memory cards. So she disappeared, briefly, then lured Breedlove into a kill zone, took her out but then had to deal with two other officers who got on the scene quicker than anticipated. So, she took ‘em out too.”\n\nThe Duke nodded, grunted his approval. “Then what?”\n\n“She circles back to her original target, Walker, and takes him out, then gets the fuck out of Dodge.”\n\n“Okay, I like it, makes sense. What about the crime scene? What does that tell us, Meathead?”\n\n“First, she treated the officers’ bodies with respect. She placed the heads neatly on their laps, so my guess is she killed them reluctantly, out of perceived necessity. I guess we can assume the suspect was pretty pissed off when she did Walker, sir.”\n\n“Okay, the rest of you take off, get some sleep. I want to talk to Acheson for a minute before I go home.”\n\nThe room cleared, leaving The Duke and Acheson alone.\n\n“That’s pretty much what I took from things, kid. Good work.”\n\n“Thank you, sir.”\n\n“No sirs when we’re in here chewing the fat, kid. So, why are you on motors?”\n\n“Calculus, I guess, sir.”\n\n“Calculus?”\n\n“I have an engineering background, BS in Mechanical, UT Austin. When I finished my probation they moved me to Traffic, sent me to reconstruction school…”\n\n“Oh? Where?”\n\n“Northwestern, sir.”\n\n“No shit. So, you’re one of those hotshots, eh? You’re not exactly young. What did you do before?”\n\n“Air Force, sir. C-17s.”\n\n“Really? Why aren’t you flying for American or Delta, or some such shit?”\n\n“I did. For a couple of years. Layoffs got me, in 2008.”\n\n“Oh, yeah. Shitty times all over.”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“Duke. Call me Duke.”\n\n“Sorry sir, ain’t in my DNA.”\n\n“Alright. So. Did you know her?”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Breedlove. Did you know her.”\n\n“Yessir. Academy.”\n\nOuch, Dickinson said to himself. Academy classmates were always close. “You okay about that?”\n\n“I will be, sir. In a few days, I guess.”\n\n“Okay, understood, but don’t keep it bottled up. Any interest in coming to CID?”\n\n“No sir, none. I love it out there on motors.”\n\n“Yeah, I did too.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“I was in motors, Traffic, for about five years. Bad crash, fucked up my arm.”\n\n“You miss it, sir?”\n\n“Somedays, but not when it rains.” The Duke laughed, then shook his head. “Fucking shoulder is like a goddamn barometer now. Every time a fucking storm heads this way my whole fucking arm feels like it’s going to implode.”\n\nAcheson nodded. “Sorry, sir.”\n\n“You ride out there long enough and you’ll know what it’s like to feel like a barometer. Don’t you forget that.”\n\n“Yessir. You still ride?”\n\n“Yup. A hawg, every now and then. Electra-Glide.”\n\n“Heavy bike. Where do you ride around here?”\n\n“Hill Country. Llano. Usually run down to Cooper’s Bar-B-Q and pig-out, then come back up next day.”\n\n“I’ve heard about that place, sir. Good grub?”\n\n“The best.”\n\n“Well, next time you head that way, give me a yell if you want some company. I’d like to get out on the open road, away from all this traffic, anyway.”\n\n“Sure, kid. Well, I guess you’re with us on this one. You finish your report?”\n\n“Yessir, the original and two supplementals, one for each crime scene.”\n\n“Okay, I’ll look ‘em over later, but tomorrow. I’m going home now, get some shut eye. Report to me after briefing tomorrow morning, but write up your theory about what happened, put it in a supplemental and drop it in the Watch Commander’s box. Tell him I told you to.”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“And good work, Meathead.”\n\nAcheson turned, grinned. “Thank you, sir.”\n\nChapter 4\n\nAcheson wrote the report Dickinson wanted, dropped it off at the lieutenant’s office then walked to the locker room, grabbed his helmet and a fresh ticket book before he ambled through the station and out to the parking lot. He started the BMW’s motor and turned on the strobes, then walked around the bike, checking to see that all the emergency lighting was working properly. He mounted the bike, turned off the lights and was getting ready to retract the side-stand when a patrol car pulled up alongside.\n\n“Hey,” Carol Denison said as she rolled to a stop.\n\nAcheson looked at her and smiled. “Hey, yourself.” Then he looked at the thing next to her, and groaned. “Hey, Rookie,” Acheson barked.\n\n“Sir!”\n\n“Don’t you ever, and I mean ever, ever let me see you picking your nose when you’re in a department squad car. You got that?”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“And that bugger on your fucking finger? If you put that mother fucker in your mouth and I’ll put three rounds in your fuckin’ face. You, like, hear me, Rookie?”\n\n“Sir! Yes sir!”\n\n“You his FTO?”\n\n“Yup. Hey, someone’s gotta train these kids…”\n\n“Guess so.”\n\n“Well,” Denison said – rolling her eyes, “How’s it hangin’?”\n\n“Low. Like down in the weeds low.”\n\nShe nodded. “I don’t know how you did it, man.”\n\nHe looked away, didn’t really want to go there today.\n\n“So,” she said when she saw his eyes, “Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? Me and Brad are doing up some steaks by the pool. Maybe a salad and ice cream?”\n\n“Y’all still over in that complex off Northwest Highway?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\n“Well, sure. Unless…”\n\n“Yeah, I know, I know. There he is, ladies and germs: Joe Ace, Traffic Reconstructionist Extraordinaire. Gets called to go work every bad wreck in the county.”\n\nAcheson grinned. “I never, ever shoulda taken calculus. No good ever came from taking too much math.”\n\n“You finally figured that one out, like all by yourself?” Denison smiled. That knowing smile, the one he remembered from academy.\n\n“With a pencil, too. Say, that reminds me. Rookie!”\n\n“Yes sir!”\n\n“Do you know how a mathematician gets rid of constipation?”\n\n“No, sir!”\n\n“Works it out, with a pencil.”\n\nStone cold silence.\n\n“So, you get it?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Where do they dig up these morons,” Acheson moaned.\n\nDenison shrugged. “He’s not too bad, Ben.” But not as good as you were, she said to herself. She and Amy Breedlove and Acheson had become inseparable halfway through their academy class, and for a while there had been even money on who loved Acheson more, Carol Denison or Amy Breedlove. Yet Acheson had been oblivious to everything, was always the serious student and had never let on he noticed what was going on.\n\nAnd who knows, Denison thought, maybe he really hadn’t caught on. Better for him now if he hadn’t.\n\n“So, got a girlfriend yet? If so, bring her along!”\n\nHe shrugged. “You know me, still flying solo. You and Brad engaged?”\n\n“No way! He’s still married to his job…”\n\n“Still selling cars?”\n\n“Cadillacs, Ben, not cars.”\n\n“Oh, right. Silly me.”\n\nThey laughed.\n\n“Well, okay. Seeya around four thirty or five?”\n\n“Sounds about right, and Rookie? Keep that finger out of your nose.” he said, then he looked at Carol: “Be careful out there.”\n\n“You too, Ben.” She slipped the car into gear and eased away, pulled out into traffic and was gone.\n\n“141, are you in service?”\n\n“141, 10/4,” he groaned, knew what was coming next.\n\n“141, 27B, Lemmon at Turtle Creek. Vehicle on fire, one fatality reported.”\n\n“-41, Code 5.”\n\n“141, at 0910.”\n\n“Well,” he said as he pulled away from the station, “there goes the day.”\n\nChapter 5\n\nAcheson cleared from the wreck a couple hours later, then headed out Lemmon Avenue past Love Field, then wound his way over to Harry Hines and began cruising the area Amy had been working the day before. He didn’t have any idea what he was looking for; in fact, he felt kind of lost as he cruised up and down the streets around the crime scene. He stopped on Maybank, looked toward the tire store as a Southwest 737 lined up on final for Love Field, then made his way back to Harry Hines. He was waiting to make a left onto Lombardy when something, some sort of insight, flashed through his mind. The light turned green and he turned east on Lombardy, rode a few hundred yards, then stopped on the shoulder and looked around again. Something was bugging him, but after a minute he pulled back onto Lombardy, then turned south on Denton Drive. Another few hundred yards and he crossed a little concrete bridge over a paved storm-water runoff ditch that carried floodwaters down to the Trinity River, and there it was again – he knew he was missing something important. But what? He pulled the bike over onto the shoulder again, and something in his gut twitched, some little alarm in his head went off.\n\n“So, if I ran from Maybank to Lombardy, killed Walker there, where would I go next?”\n\nHe looked through the trees to his right. He could just see the tire store, there beyond the drainage ditch. And the crime scene on Maybank – was at the far end of an imaginary line running from here through the tire store.\n\n“Well, I’d keep on running, away from the scene on Maybank.”\n\nHe drew a line on the map in his head, and it led to right here. He pulled the BMW off the road, parked under a shade tree and walked down the sloped concrete to the drainage ditch, then over to the bridge that carried traffic on Denton Drive over the ditch. He saw a couple of water moccasins in the shallow, brownish water and skirted them warily, then walked under the low bridge.\n\nHe saw it immediately.\n\nA white towel, folded neatly on top of a small blue duffel bag.\n\nHe walked over to pile, took a pencil and unfolded the towel.\n\nA blood-soaked knife. A notepad.\n\nAnd some writing on the notepad.\n\n“Better luck next time, Ben,” was written on the pale yellow pad, and in a daze Acheson ran up to the BMW and called dispatch.\n\nThe mobile crime scene unit arrived before anyone from CID, and they secured the scene while Acheson paced ‘round and ‘round, obviously agitated.\n\nOne of the techs came up a few minutes later.\n\n“Any idea who this ‘Ben’ is?” the tech asked.\n\n“Yeah. Me.”\n\n“No shit? That’s fucked up, man.”\n\nAcheson looked at the guy, cold smoldering fury in his eyes.\n\n“Well, right, anyway, the camera is in the duffel, along with a bunch of shots of that Walker dude, probably from the CF card.”\n\n“That sounds about right,” he said as the implications of the note pounded away inside his head. He went to the radio again, shook his head, took a deep breath.\n\n“141,” he said into the mic.\n\n“141, go ahead.”\n\n“141, would you contact Captain Dickinson, advise him he needs to come to this location.”\n\n“141, at 1347 hours.”\n\nAcheson walked over to a telephone pole and put his hands out, leaned against the creosoted wood as his head began swimming in the currents of his doubts and fears.\n\nThen he vomited. Again.\n\nChapter 6\n\nDickinson arrived on the scene about an hour later; Acheson led him down into the ditch and over to the bridge. The CSU techs had left everything pretty much as they’d found things, primarily to let Dickinson look things over before they tagged and bagged the evidence and took it all down to Central Evidence.\n\nDickinson read the note, then whistled.\n\n“Holy fuck-a-doodle-do,” he said. “I didn’t see this one coming.”\n\n“No, sir. Neither did I.”\n\n“So, how the fuck did you find this shit?”\n\n“I worked a major accident first thing this morning. When I cleared I decided to come over here, just poke around. I thought, well, I tried to picture a vector, a trajectory, from the crime scene on Maybank to the tire store, and I carried that line forward. I, well, it pretty much leads to the bridge, sir. I came down there, and bingo. Here it is.”\n\n“Are you, like, a weirdo, or some kind of fucking genius?”\n\nAcheson shook his head. “Not hardly.”\n\n“I guess there’s no memory card in the camera?”\n\n“Uh, no sir,” the CSU tech replied, “it was in the bag. Probably wiped, but there are images on it.”\n\n“And no fingerprints?”\n\n“None.”\n\n“Fuck-a-doodle-do,” Dickinson said again. “Any theories, Meathead?”\n\n“It’s either a cop, sir, or an ex-cop. And maybe she put this stuff here yesterday, or saw me a while ago and dumped it then.”\n\n“Damn right it’s a cop, and a pissed off cop, too. Fuck-a-doodle-do.” He walked down the ditch towards Harry Hines. “Anyone check the area for footprints?”\n\nOne of the detectives from CID answered that she and her partner had just finished walking both sides of the ditch down to Harry Hines and back, and had found nothing.\n\n“Figures. Well, fuck-a-doodle-do. Guess we’d better send the towel and the bag over to the Federales, see what the fuck they can come up with.”\n\n“Yessir,” the CSU tech said. “Can I bag it now, sir?”\n\n“Yeah, go ahead. Acheson, let’s go grab some chow. If I can’t sleep, we might as well eat.”\n\n“Sir, one of my Academy friends is cooking steaks this evening. Meeting her around five. Could we head over there?”\n\n“Steaks? Well, why the fuck not. Never turned down a steak in my life.”\n\n“It’s not far from here, sir, if you want to follow me.”\n\n“Lead on, boy. Just don’t lose my ass. That fucking bike looks like it’s going a hundred miles an hour just standing still. Hey, come to think of it, we’d better stop off and pick up some extra meat. I’m fucking hungry!”\n\nChapter 7\n\n“So, just what did you run into over on Denton,” Carol asked when Ben and The Duke had settled down in lawn chairs out by the pool behind her apartment building.\n\nBen looked at Dickinson, who nodded it was okay to talk about it.\n\n“Some evidence. From the thing, uh, yesterday.”\n\n“What Mr Articulate here is trying to say, Officer Denison, is that he found the missing camera and the murder weapon.”\n\n“Really? That’s, uh, pretty wild. How’d you put that together?”\n\n“I can’t wait to hear this,” The Duke said. “I swear to god, Meathead, you ought to go into politics. You could bumfuzzle a raccoon.”\n\n“Yessir. Uh, well, I had a picture of the area, uh, in my mind. I just drew, well, a line. Well, in my mind…”\n\n“I just fuckin’ love this guy,” The Duke interrupted. “He’s like Cary Fuckin’ Grant. Suave, man, I mean fuckin’ grace under pressure.”\n\nCarol laughed, then looked at her watch.\n\n“Heard from Brad,” Ben asked.\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Well, I’m starved,” The Duke said. “Got some charcoal handy? I’ll get us a fire going…”\n\nCarol’s cell phone pinged, she answered, walked away from the pool while she talked, then came back a few moments later.\n\nShe did not look happy.\n\n“Well, I guess that’s that,” she said.\n\n“What’s up?” Ben asked.\n\n“Brad. He’s done with me, with us, the whole police widow thing.”\n\n“Hot damn!” The Duke yelled. “A purdy girl all to ourselves, and an extra steak for me! Fuck-a-doodle-do!”\n\nChapter 8\n\n“That guy’s a trip,” Carol said a few minutes after The Duke left.\n\n“Kind of a force of nature. And a legend in Texas law enforcement, from what I’ve heard.”\n\n“You know, he kinda looks like John Wayne, too. Spooky.”\n\n“I think he’s even bigger,” Acheson answered. “How’re you holding up?”\n\nShe shrugged, turned away, walked into the kitchen.\n\nBen heard tears from the living room, walked into the kitchen, stood behind her. “You going to be alright?” he asked.\n\nShe turned, walked into his arms and buried her face in his neck. “I don’t know. It’s kind of hard to blow off two years. You know what I mean?”\n\n“I reckon so.”\n\n“Haven’t you ever had a serious thing with a girl before?”\n\n“Yeah, once.”\n\n“Once? When…”\n\n“In college. Well, we were together from our second year ‘til we graduated.”\n\n“And you split up after…”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“Killed. An ice storm up in the panhandle, on 287. She was headed home for Christmas, a truck lost it on the ice, hit her head on.”\n\n“Oh. I’m sorry, Ben. I didn’t…you never…”\n\n“Nope, no reason to. Never been a big fan of pity parties.”\n\n“And, well, has there been anyone since?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“No one?”\n\n“Nope. Not a soul. Actually, I thought I’d make a decent priest, gave it some serious thought, too.”\n\nShe laughed, then stopped. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”\n\n“Oh, yes, but see, the thing is, I’m not big on the whole God thing. I figured that might not be the best way to approach the ministry.”\n\n“I can see that might present a few problems,” she said gently, almost smiling again.\n\n“A few?”\n\n“You know, Amy and I were both in love with you. Back in Academy.”\n\nHis eyes didn’t register the words, but his head shook a little. “What?”\n\n“We were both in love with you. Amy and…”\n\n“You?”\n\n“Me. I. Yes.”\n\n“Sorry. I had no…”\n\n“Idea. Yes, we figured that out. It still surprises me, though. I thought we were kind of obvious.”\n\n“That’s so…weird. I just never thought…”\n\n“Of me that way. Yup, I know.”\n\n“But…”\n\n“Yessiree. Good ole Carol, the invisible girl.”\n\n“What? Why do you…”\n\n“Why do I say that? Well, Officer, let’s look at the evidence before the court, shall we? See? There’s this girl in his arms, this suddenly available girl, and this girl’s had like a mad crush on him for like five years, and you aren’t even going to kiss me, are you? You aren’t even going to, like, throw me down on the kitchen floor and fuck my brains out, even though she’s just standing there, right in front of you, practically begging you to do just that?”\n\n“You want me to kiss…”\n\n“Oh-my-fucking-God! Do you like have some kind of brain tumor or something, some weird-ass-fucking-thing in your head that makes you totally stupid when it comes to girls?”\n\n“A tumor?”\n\n“Would you just shut the fuck up and kiss me now, you moron?”\n\nChapter 9\n\n“So, did you and Officer Carol swap some spit last night,” The Duke asked when Acheson made it into CID the next morning.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Are you, like, totally stupid? Or are you some kind of fuckin’ space alien, from, you know, like Mars or someplace like that?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Jesus H Fucking Christ, Meathead! I have never, and I mean never, ever seen a girl as crazy in love with a guy like that gal is with you! Tell me, really, you weren’t like, you know, picking up on that even just a little bit?”\n\n“I think she kinda got me dialed into that, sir. Took a while, though.”\n\n“Man, and I thought you was like half way smart, too. Shame on fucking me.” The Duke shook his head, grinned a little, then said: “You’d better go wash your hands again, son. I think I can smell a little, well, you know, on them fingers.”\n\nAcheson turned a deep crimson purple, put his hands behind his back.\n\n“I’m serious, slick. That hand smells like a can of tuna that’s been sitting out in the sun for a week. Now, git! And use some soap this time, too.”\n\nAcheson took a leak, washed his hands, then went back to CID.\n\n“So, did y’all set a date yet?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Jesus, this is fun.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Okay, Meathead, okay…where do we go with this case? Any ideas?”\n\n“Forensics. On the bag and towel. Any idea when we’ll get those back?”\n\n“Probably a week. Thereabouts, anyway, but I don’t feel like waiting. So? What’s next?”\n\n“We bait a trap.”\n\n“And how would we do that?”\n\n“We find another perp, another Walker, get CID onto him, put a tail on the guy.”\n\n“Tether a goat, wait for the lion?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“Might work. What else?”\n\n“Unmarked patrols around the bookstores and arcades. Clear out all the marked units from Harry Hines, for a while, anyway.”\n\n“Oh. Did you finish that accident report? From yesterday?”\n\n“Yessir. I came in early, 0600, and wrapped it up.”\n\n“She’s seems like a helluva girl, Ben. You figure that out yet, or are you going to pass?”\n\n“Carol?”\n\n“God, I’m sure there’s a fucking brain in there somewhere,” The Duke said as he squinted hard and looked at Acheson. “Yes, Carol. Did she say how long she’s been in fucking love with you?”\n\n“Since Academy. She’s says, sir.”\n\n“That fits. What district is she working?”\n\n“She’s floating, Field Training Officer this month. Working with a rookie around Love Field, I think.”\n\n“I’m going to pull her off the street, until this is over.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Well, first Breedlove is killed, then the note to you. It could be random, or you might be the common denominator in this case, and if that’s true then she’s at risk.”\n\n“Unless she did it, sir.”\n\n“Already checked that one, slick. Last night, while you had your fingers in the pie, so to speak. She was here in the station when you checked out on Maybank, doing paperwork, and she didn’t leave until it was all over. So…”\n\nAcheson nodded, felt a chill run down his spine. “Have to wait until the woman strikes again,” he almost whispered.\n\n“No way, Meathead. No fuckin’ way, and don’t ever let me hear you thinkin’ like that again, not even to yourself. We don’t wait for people to get killed, got it?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“Now, don’t make a fuckin’ stink about it, but go check your bike in, write it up on a mechanical or something, then check out an unmarked and head over to Harry Hines, just start setting up, scoping out those dirty movie places, them glory holes where the hookers hang out. My bet is she’s going to hit some guy who’s about to take out a hooker.”\n\n“What about the pedophile angle, sir?”\n\n“Possible, but we’ve got the district squads handling that, putting pressure on the parks, so maybe that’ll push her to the peep shows. Assuming she’s smart, but I’m assuming that’s her kill zone.”\n\n“Sir, if she’s inside, she probably knows every unmarked car we have.”\n\n“Hadn’t thought of that,” The Duke said as he looked out a window while he stood by a water cooler in the corner of the room. He bent over, took a little paper cone and filled it with cold water, then tossed it down while he looked out the window. He filled it again, tossed that one down too, then crumbled up the little cup and threw it across the room to a waste can by his desk.\n\nHe didn’t miss; the wadded paper flew straight in the can, and The Duke smiled.\n\n“That’s kind of like life, kid. You gotta take the shot, every time. But you can’t afford to miss.”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\nThe Duke looked around the room, walked over to a long table, opened up a white donut box sitting by some folders.\n\n“Empty! Motherfuckers! Not one fuckin’ donut left! Bunch of goddamned vultures! What kind of fuckin’ police station is this! Where are my Goddamn donuts!” The Duke screamed as he rambled off down the hall…\n\nChapter 10\n\nAcheson was driving an old, impounded Toyota past Love Field, on his way out to Harry Hines, and he stopped by the old Braniff hangers on the north side of the airport and watched as a Southwest 737 flared over the threshold and roared to a stop. He looked at the jet and had to admit that he missed it. Flying. Being in the cockpit. The economy that had ruined his career had turned around again – and he wasn’t too old, yet. He could get back on with a major again, or even Southwest, if he really wanted to. Get a type rating on 737s, or go back to 777s.\n\nStill, he really loved police work, and he’d never expected that. He loved riding motors, working wrecks. Even arresting people from time to time, those that really needed it, anyway. He could see himself doing the work, doing it for the rest of his working life, but every time he saw a 737 coming in to Love, or a heavy out at DFW, his heart fluttered a bit. It was a lot like loving two women, each with a lot of good things going for her, and then being forced to choose between them.\n\nHe shook himself back into the present, got back on Lemmon Avenue and headed toward Northwest Highway – then that instinct hit him in the gut again and he swung off Lemmon into a parking lot, cursing himself as he jumped a curb. He opened his briefcase and pulled out a map of the city, penciled in a line from the initial scene on Maybank to the tire store on Lombardy, then extended the line out in both directions.\n\n“Fuck!” he said. The line extended south, straight to Love Field, right through runway 1-3 Right until it veered slightly into a new parking garage across from the remodeled main terminal building. His stomach lurched as he got back into traffic, then he U-turned and backtracked on Lemmon until he hit Mockingbird Lane, then after another half mile he turned right on Cedar Springs and into the airport.\n\n“Now what?” he asked himself as he drove on to the terminal area. He slowed, looked at his marked-up map again, looked where the line crossed the runway and veered through a new parking garage, and so he headed for it. He came to a pay gate and took the time-stamped card the machine spit out at him, then drove inside.\n\nThe garage looked to be three, maybe four stories tall, so he started cruising the lanes, looking between parked cars as he worked his way up to the next level. There were construction trucks parked on the second level, and construction materials were stacked in a few corners of the building, but there were still a lot of parked cars, just normal airport traffic mixed in with the trucks and pallets…\n\n“What the hell is that?”\n\nHe stopped near a corner of the garage on the second level, and while there was some sunlight flooding through other parts of the building, this corner was dark, almost pitch black. He could just make out a large pile of what looked like garbage stacked in this corner, some construction debris maybe, but a blue plastic tarp covered a large part of the pile – but something else caught his eye.\n\nAcheson picked up his flashlight and got out of the car, then walked over to the pile, lifted the tarp, fell to his knees and started vomiting. Again.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCaptain Dickinson got to the scene fifteen minutes later, along with a few dozen patrol cars, and he made his way up to Acheson’s location as quickly as he could. The Duke got out of his Ford and walked over to the CSU van; he saw Acheson standing away from the scene, then he saw the fresh pile of puke Acheson had just deposited on the concrete.\n\nHe walked over to the victim, looked at the poor fucker and turned away before his own stomach started to heave.\n\n“Fuck-a-doodle-do-do!” he said as he made his way over to Acheson. “Man-o-man, she field dressed that poor sumbitch. Phew-whee, poor fucker must’ve eaten at Taco Bell. Wow! You ever small anything like that?!”\n\nAcheson stifled a heave. “Could you stop it, please?”\n\n“So, what got you this time? The olives? Or the sour cream?”\n\nAcheson dropped to knees again, and The Duke walked away with a big grin plastered all over his face, then ‘high-fived’ a CSU tech as he walked inside the van.\n\n“Got anything interesting?”\n\n“Nothing much, but a few differences. Same MO. Cut his head off, probably same type of blade, maybe a Special Forces K-Bar. Disemboweled, as before, only this time looks like she took a bite out of the large intestine.”\n\n“No shit? Hungry little bitch, I guess. Bite marks worth a damn?”\n\n“Still working on that. Anyway. Cut his penis off, same type knife, then put the pecker in the guy’s mouth, tip sticking out, just like the one yesterday. Another something different. She took the guys testes, put them where his eyes used to be.”\n\n“Now, that’s a nice touch. Find the eyes?” The Duke heard Acheson ask.\n\n“Not yet,” the tech replied.\n\n“Oh, you back among the living, Meathead?”\n\nAcheson was standing behind The Duke. “Yup.”\n\n“So, what do the eyes tell you?”\n\n“She thinks we’re blind. And we’re thinking with our balls, or think like men, I guess you’d say.”\n\n“Uh-huh. We probably are, but that’s the problem with having nuts. Anything else?”\n\n“Yeah, the shoe-print.”\n\n“She left…a shoe-print? Didn’t see that…”\n\n“Well, it’s over here, and I’d say it’s a plant. It’s too perfect.”\n\n“Show me.”\n\nThe tech, Acheson and The Duke walked over to the corner by the body; there were bright work lights set up now, and a team of techs was dusting everything down for fingerprints. A few feet away, bright yellow tape on the concrete demarcated a dark red shoe print on the concrete, and a tech was photographing it when the three of them approached.\n\n“So, what is it? Blood, or paint,” The Duke asked the tech.\n\n“Best guess right now? Blood.”\n\n“The shoe?”\n\n“Woman’s high heel, probably size 7. Imprint on the sole says Pepe Jimenez.”\n\n“An imprint?”\n\n“Yeah, that’s the giveaway. Probably a new shoe, never worn.”\n\n“Search the building. I’d make bet it’s in here somewhere.” He turned to Acheson. “So, what’s that shoe supposed to mean?”\n\n“Either, uh, wait a minute…” Acheson said as walked back to his unmarked car. He rummaged around on the floor, then came back carrying a compass and a map of the city in his hands.\n\n“Hey, look! It’s…Dallas!” The Duke cried when he saw the map. “Holy shit, what a clue!”\n\nAcheson ignored him, put the map down on the concrete, spread it out to show most of the city.\n\n“Okay, sir. Here’s how I found this scene. I drew the line…”\n\n“Yeah, from Maybank to the drainage ditch. You told me that. What of it?”\n\n“Well sir, I extended the line. It leads to the runway over there,” he said, pointing to the threshold of 1-3 Right, “but veers into the garage. Right here, as a matter of fact.”\n\nThe Duke kneeled down to the pavement and studied the map. “I’ll be damned.”\n\n“Now, that bearing is roughly 130 degrees true. My guess is if we take the heel and the tip of the toe on that shoe print and use that as a vector, we’ll get roughly 130 degrees.”\n\n“Do it.”\n\nAcheson walked over to the print and gently placed an edge of the map along the heel-toe axis, then placed the compass on the axis. “132 degrees, sir.”\n\n“Fuck-a-doodle-do,” The Duke said, looking at Acheson. The tech nodded, clearly impressed.\n\n“So…?”\n\n“So, think she’s pointing us to her next kill? What’s along that axis, Ben.”\n\nAcheson placed the map on the pavement again and extended the line on the map to the very edge of the paper. “Condos and high rises on Turtle Creek…”\n\n“Gucci Gulch, you mean?”\n\n“Yessir. Then along Haskell, on to the other side of Central, and then out to the north side of Fair Park.”\n\n“A lot of potential kill zones in there. Anything stand out?”\n\n“Besides the fair grounds? No, nothing jumps out at me, sir.”\n\n“What about the shoe? You were about to say something. What was it?”\n\n“Well sir, it’s feminine. The shoe, I mean, and it’s a woman’s size. She’s either telling us something about herself, or her next victim.”\n\n“Assume it’s hers. Then what?”\n\n“First, we find out about the shoe, find out who carries that brand, then try to find anyone in the area who bought one in that size, then cross check that info with women in the department, with that shoe size.”\n\n“Like we have that kind of information on file, Meathead!”\n\n“Then we get it, sir. Daily briefings. Shouldn’t take more than a few days.”\n\n“Okay. So I think we should extend that line north and south, plot it out on a really accurate, really big fucking map. Start patrols along that line. Like, today.”\n\nAcheson shook his head again. “Probably isn’t going to matter much, sir. Whoever it is, she’s probably inside, very dialed in to what we’re doing, my guess is she’s monitoring all our frequencies, and my guess is she has whatever equipment she needs to de-scramble every channel we use. She’ll know the patrol districts, squad numbers, you name it.”\n\n“Ben, you and I are going downtown, talk to the Chief. Leave that piece of shit car here, ride with me. Give the keys to…what’s your name?” The Duke asked the tech.\n\n“Logan, sir.”\n\n“Logan, have someone get that unmarked back down to Central when you clear.”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“I’ll go get my stuff out, sir,” Acheson said as he jogged over to the old clunker. Then…\n\n“What the FUCK!” he cried.\n\nThe Duke and an army of detectives and crime scene techs ran over to Acheson’s car.\n\nDown on the driver’s seat was another notepad, open to a fresh page.\n\nAcheson leaned over, read it aloud:\n\n– Not bad, Ben, but you’re not there yet. And time’s running out, so don’t waste any more of my time. Luv, C –\n\nEveryone stood up and looked around. Whoever planted the notepad had done it in the past few minutes, while the group had been over next to the body looking at the shoe print, only now the car’s passenger door stood open – and there was a stairwell just beyond the car’s open door.\n\nThirty cops and detectives took off running for the stairs; half ran up, half ran down, and nobody found anything or anyone in the least bit suspicious.\n\n+++++\n\n“You know,” the Chief said as The Duke looked on, “you took the sergeant’s exam, scored high, could have had your stripes but you turned ‘em down. I’m curious. Why?”\n\n“I would have had to give up motors, Chief. I like Traffic, I like what I do.”\n\n“I can relate to that,” he said. “I was on motors in LA for nearly fifteen years. Still, no ambition beyond motors?”\n\n“I’m not sure, Chief,” Acheson said as he looked away.\n\nThe Chief opened Acheson’s personnel file. “Oh, yeah, you’re one of the pilots. I understand now. Southwest’s hiring. So are United and Delta, maybe American, too. When are you going to apply?”\n\n“I haven’t decided what I want to do yet, Chief.”\n\n“You mean, you might stick it out here?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“You miss flying, son?”\n\n“Something awful, sir.”\n\nThe old man nodded. “Yeah, once it gets in your blood it’s hard to shake, and life’s short.”\n\n“Did you fly, sir?”\n\n“Me? Yup, a little – ‘Nam. Navy. RA-5C, recon bird. You know it?”\n\n“Yessir, probably the prettiest aircraft ever made. Must’ve been a hoot and half, sir.”\n\n“You flew, what, the C-17? Then for American? What did you fly with them.”\n\n“Right seat, 757s, then 777s, just before things turned south.”\n\n“Pretty bird, too. Still a lot of carriers using ‘em,” the Chief said, pointedly. “Bet you could get a job tomorrow.”\n\nAcheson shrugged, looked back at the man.\n\n“What could I offer you? To keep you here?”\n\n“I don’t know, sir.”\n\n“What about…if you could have ‘em both. Would that work?”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Go get your job, just keep yourself based here in the Dallas area, work some days off as a Reserve.”\n\n“Could I stay in Traffic, Chief?”\n\n“Maybe, sure, but the Duke wants you pretty damn bad. Over in CID.”\n\n“Maybe Traffic for a few more years, then jump over to CID?”\n\n“Duke? Would that work for you?”\n\n“Hell, Mike, we’re short downstairs, and I could use him full time, right now. I’d bump him up to sergeant tomorrow, get him on the list to take the Lieutenants Exam in September. I’m retiring in five years. He’s got the chops to take my place, the only one I’ve been around the past few years that has the mind for the job. Anyway, that’s what I want, Ben.”\n\n“Ben,” the Chief said, “I’m not a high pressure type of guy. You want to fly, you go fly. Do whatever you can in this life that makes you happy. I believe if you’re happy, your family will be happy, and the people you work with will be happy. That said, we can sure use you. We need men and women that can think on their feet. Hell, the world’s changing faster than ever and, well, we need officers like you more than we ever have. Ya know, the days of redneck policing are over, the job is simply getting too complex. Anyway. We need you. Please think about that…before you make any decisions. Okay?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“Oh, one more thing. I’ve got a complaint from a rookie about you. Says you threatened to blow his head off?”\n\n“Yessir, I did.”\n\n“Oh? I guess I’d kinda like to know why…?”\n\n“He was right seat, in a patrol car, saw him pick his nose, and I think he was getting ready to eat a pretty big bugger, sir.”\n\nThe Chief’s and The Duke’s eyes went round, the Chief made a small retching sound.\n\n“Tell you what, Ben; you see that sumbitch do that again you put that pistol of yours right in his mouth, and tell him I told you to pass along that’s his last warning. We clear on that, Officer?”\n\n“As a bell, sir.”\n\nThe Chief stood, held out his hand. “It was good to meet you, son. I hope you decide to stick around, and if you do just let Duke know. Now, Adios you two.”\n\n“Yessir. Thank you sir.”\n\nThe Duke and Acheson walked in silence down the hall to CID, the old man stopping once to look at a particularly nice pair of legs, then they went into the briefing room and sat down.\n\n“Nice set of stems on that one, eh?” The Duke said.\n\n“Hmm? Oh, yeah. That your secretary?”\n\n“Yup. New gal. Took her on a few months ago. Sweet as can be, had a sad life. Well, nice chat with the Chief. Guess you know where things stand.”\n\n“Yessir. Thanks. For what you said in there. I appreciate it.”\n\n“Well, you’ve got a report to write, me too, for that matter. Then why don’t you get over to that gal’s place, Carol, and take her out to dinner? You two might have a few things to talk over tonight, too.”\n\nAcheson smiled, nodded. He hadn’t thought about her all day.\n\n“Oh, by the way, I’ve got her detailed to dispatch for the time being, until we get this little fracas settled, anyway. In case you want to drop by or call her or something.”\n\n“Sir?”\n\n“Oh, man, you do disappoint the shit out of me sometimes, Meathead.”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n+++++\n\n“Sounds like you had another weird day,” Carol said as they settled in a dark corner booth at a decent little Mexican place close to her apartment.\n\n“Yup. Weird’s a good word.”\n\n“You found…another body?”\n\n“You want some guacamole or something?” he asked, hoping to change the subject.\n\n“Sure. Maybe about ten Margaritas, too!”\n\n“Yikes! Hope you got kneepads, and your plumbing works!”\n\nA waiter came by and Ben ordered a couple of Maggies and some green stuff…\n\n“Anyway, I had a ‘two-on-one’ with Dickinson and the Chief this afternoon.”\n\n“Uh-oh,” she said, turning serious. “About my rookie and that stuff about picking his nose?”\n\n“Oh, no, not really. More the ‘are you going to stay with the department?’ kinda stuff. Am I going to go back to flying, in other words, and Duke wants me to move to CID as of yesterday, will bump me to sergeant right away if I do, and as much as said he wants me working towards taking over CID when he leaves.”\n\n“Holy shit, Ben, that’s wonderful news. What did you tell them?”\n\n“Nothing, yet. It was more a ‘you need to go home and think about this for a few days’ kinda thing, but Duke seems to think you might have something to do with this decision.”\n\n“Oh, really? Me?”\n\n“Well, he seems to think you love me, and that I’d be crazy not to jump all over you…”\n\n“Or maybe he’s just using me to manipulate you?” she said.\n\nHe shook his head. “Maybe, but I doubt it.”\n\n“You like him, don’t you.”\n\n“Kinda reminds me of my grandfather. Hard around the edges, but a real softie inside.”\n\n“You trust him, then?”\n\n“I think so. He’s a natural leader, but an honest one, too. Rare, in other words.”\n\n“Loves donuts, or so I hear.”\n\n“Loves? Shit, he drinks ‘em down. I mean it, in like one bite. And he inhales a pint of milk after almost every one. Fucking amazing. Amazing he doesn’t weight four hundred pounds. Anyway,” he leaned forward, took a folded up letter from his shirt pocket and opened it. “It’s from United. Got it today. First officer’s position, 757s. Probably Seattle, maybe Denver. Pay is about twice what I’d make as head of CID five years from now.”\n\n“Uh-huh? But?”\n\n“But the Chief said I could fly and, if based out of Dallas, still do motors in the Reserves.”\n\n“But aren’t you still in the Air Force Reserves?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\n“So, you’d be flying three days a week, then maybe a day or two per week on the street, and what is it, a weekend a month driving C-17s for the Air Force? Sounds an awful lot to me like you’d be burning the candle at both ends.”\n\n“To me, too.”\n\n“So, you’ve got a big decision to make, don’t you?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\n“And do I fit in there, somehow?”\n\nHe sighed, nodded his head. “I, well, I guess that’s the question. I say we give it time, see where it goes.”\n\n“Yup, no need to rush.”\n\n“So, this stuff…when you say you loved me in Academy? Were you serious?”\n\nShe smiled, shrugged her shoulders. “I wasn’t making that up, Ben, but maybe it was more an infatuation, for a while, anyway. But over time, as I watched you, well, I don’t know. I began to feel something more, as I got to know you better. Amy did too, but I never thought it was anything like love – with either of us. It was more like we respected how you picked yourself up after getting dropped by American, how you didn’t give up. But it was more than that, too; it was how seriously you took becoming an officer, like you really respect the job, the problems we deal with, that people have to care enough about the world to try and make a difference. The funny-sad thing about Amy, though? I think she fell for you, hard. Like she really wanted to love you, somehow needed to…but she never really got over the idea when it looked like, well, you two just weren’t going to happen. I tried to move on, tried to tell her to, too, but really, it’s funny, I could never commit to Brad, and I think he guessed the real reason why. But Amy? Like I said, she never really tried to move on. I think she wanted to be near you any way she could, maybe even just to talk to you every now and then. Who knows, maybe she thought if she was around you long enough she’d get an opportunity.”\n\n“That sounds sad. And it’s like, well…I never had a clue.”\n\n“She was poor, I mean her folks never had anything. She never had anything, either. Then she met you.”\n\n“Why didn’t she say something? To me?”\n\n“What would you have done if she had?”\n\n“I don’t know. She was nice, I guess, but not my type. A little too wild.”\n\n“She could be. Remember the party, after graduation? When she started stripping?”\n\n“Not sure I’ll ever forget that. She was toasted.”\n\n“And she did come on to you, didn’t she? That night.”\n\n“Yeah, but she was coming on to everyone that night.”\n\n“No, Ben, she wasn’t. She was, well, she was making her play for you.”\n\n“Drunk people are a real turn off – to me. Maybe if she had…well, no, we just never clicked.”\n\nCarol nodded. “Did you feel anything last night? With me?”\n\nHe looked at her, wasn’t sure what he wanted to say. “Kinda hard to put into words.”\n\n“You’re off the next three days, aren’t you? What are you going to do?”\n\n“Going up to Denver, to United, and talk with them.”\n\n“It must be like a dream come true for you.”\n\n“In a way, yes. I never thought the choice would be anything but clear…like I always knew I would fly for a living. It’s what I always wanted to do.”\n\n“Then you should, Ben.”\n\nHe nodded his head. “If that’s the choice I make, well, would you stay with the department?”\n\n“It’s too soon to make those kinds of decisions, Ben, but if you want me there with you, I will be. If not, I’ll understand, and I like what I do. Life goes on.”\n\nIV\n\n“So, Ben,” The Duke said as Acheson walked into the CID briefing room, “how was Denver?”\n\n“Decent. Good package. Shitty city.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Uglier than this place, and I always thought that would be just about impossible.”\n\n“But the mountains…”\n\n“They’re there, all right. I guess. Smog was so thick I couldn’t see ‘em.”\n\n“Well, the Rockies are something else. Best motorcycle roads in the country.”\n\n“Yeah, imagine so.”\n\n“So. United? Good pay package, you say?”\n\n“Decent. Yessir.”\n\n“Did you sign with ‘em?”\n\n“No, not yet. Hung up on how long I’d have to wait before I could make Captain. I was due at American. United wants me there five years before they’d consider it. Not sure I want to wait that long.”\n\n“Hallelujah!” The Duke said as he slapped his desk. “Their loss! Anyway,” he said as he walked over to the wall behind his desk, “here’s the map, with your 130 degree vector drafted on it. City surveyor did it, so it’s accurate.”\n\nAcheson walked over and studied it, slid his finger along the line. “Oak Lawn, Holland, Turtle Creek, then…that Frank Lloyd Wright building. The Dallas Theatre Center, it’s right on the line.”\n\n“Theatre? Why – is that important?”\n\n“Maybe, but, well, this is, in a way, someone’s scripted drama unfolding slowly, isn’t it? What better place than a theatre!”\n\n“Let’s go!”\n\n____________________________________\n\nThey came down Blackburn, turned left on Sylvan and approached Wright’s cream colored masterpiece slowly, then turned up the hill into the little parking court and got out of The Duke’s Ford. Acheson walked up the stairs and over to the glass entry doors and peered inside. He tried a door – it was locked, so he walked over to a little fountain and stopped dead in his tracks.\n\n“I think this is what we’re looking for, Captain!”\n\nDuke walked over, looked down into the water and saw a woman’s shoe; it was already in a department evidence bag, sealed from the water. “The bitch is playing with us now, isn’t she?”\n\n“Gotta camera?”\n\n“In the trunk.”\n\nThey both heard it, at the same instant. Footsteps, running on gravel, then on pavement. Acheson ran to the car, looked on the front seat.\n\n“Mother fucker!” he yelled. Duke trotted up right behind him and looked down into the car.\n\nA note pad, open to fresh page.\n\n“What’s it say, Ben?”\n\nAcheson read it silently first, then aloud:\n\n– What? No back up? You guys are pathetic. Ben, you most of all. Expected more from you. Come on, get with it. Oh, Ben. I hope you enjoyed Denver as much as I did. Luv, C –\n\n“What the fuck?” The Duke said.\n\n“She followed me?”\n\n“Okay, let’s grab some pictures and bag that shoe, then get the fuck out of here…”\n\n“You think I should try to follow her?”\n\n“There?” The Duke said, pointing at the bamboo, and the trail beyond.\n\n“Used to be a railroad track up there, now it’s a jogging trail. She ran towards Lemmon…”\n\n“There are hundreds of joggers on that trail every hour. Forget it; let’s get to work. And I want to get you out of here, out of the city, before she nails you.”\n\n“Calm down, Duke. She wasn’t in Denver. It would be too damn easy to check passenger manifests against our employee roster, and DHS could run that down in about two minutes flat. Remember, look where we are. This is theatre, she’s the director, and she’s fucking with us.”\n\nThe Duke turned and stared at Acheson. “If you go to Denver it’s gonna be a black day for law enforcement in this town, Ben.”\n\n“Come on, let’s get the camera.”\n\n“Yup. We were stupid, Ben. Shoulda had the area surrounded before we got here.”\n\n“She would have known, Duke, and wouldn’t have shown up here, or maybe just jogged on by when she made us.”\n\nThey got back to the fountain, and Acheson looked at the shoe for a moment, then looked up and drew his pistol. Dropping into a combat stance he moved forward toward some deep bushes at the periphery of the building, then stepped into the undergrowth. He looked back at the shoe once, then pushed his way deeper until he came to the next body, then he jumped back out of the bushes, fell to his knees – and vomited.\n\nV\n\n“So, the shoe is made by Pepe Jimenez, style is ‘Lola,’ a 4-inch pump, size seven, made in Spain and imported into the US by a firm in Illinois called Classic Pumps; in the past 12 months they’ve shipped this size and color to 21 addresses in the Metroplex. If you look at all sizes and colors shipped here, then it’s to almost a three hundred addresses in the region. None of these addresses collate in any obvious way to any officer in the department.”\n\n“What about P O Boxes?” Duke asked.\n\n“Just six, sir,” the CSU tech advised.\n\n“Let’s get to those POs, pull the cards, see who signed for those boxes,” The Duke said to the detectives from CID, “and let’s get those by lunch time, okay?”\n\nHe motioned to the tech by the video projector to move on.\n\n“Now, the bodies,” the tech resumed. “The victim at Love Field was one Jonah Feldman, 42, lived in an apartment over off Northwest Highway. Mister Feldman is, or was a registered sex offender, three convictions for child pornography, a couple misdemeanors for lewd conduct, exposing himself in adult movie theaters…”\n\n“Sounds like my father-in-law,” someone said.\n\n“Knock it off!”\n\n“Anyway, his parole officer noted some porn in his apartment on his last home visit, wrote him up…”\n\n“Parole officer?” The Duke sat up. “Cross check all female parole officers with the shoe data, and the post offices.”\n\n“Maybe we should cross check with female sheriff’s deputies too,” one of the detectives added.\n\n“Do it.”\n\n“Right on it, sir.”\n\n“What about his computer? Anything on it?”\n\n“About twenty thousand encrypted images sir, mostly young boys being sodomized, but there’s a bunch snuff porn, again, young boys, looks like southeast Asian stuff, some south of the border stuff too, and more recent. His email contacts were sent to the FBI, and to Interpol.”\n\n“Anything else on this guy?”\n\n“Not much at this time. Nothing much on phone records, neighbors didn’t say much one way or another, parole officer thinks he was born again, reformed, but he ran his PC through a maze of fire-walled networks set up by other kiddy pornsters. How he hid his activity. Pretty common.”\n\n“What about that duffel and towel from the Walker crime scene? Anything back on that yet?”\n\n“Lands End duffel, both mail order and sold at Sears, more than four thousand sold in the area over the past two months, in this sales region alone, sir. The towel is worse. Target’s house brand, pretty generic, maybe twenty plus thousand sold over the past year in Dallas County alone.”\n\n“Shit.”\n\n“Could be our girl chose these items for their anonymity,” Acheson said. “What did you find on Walker’s computer?”\n\n“Lot of porn, kiddy porn. Boys, sodomy, mainly stills, but a few snuff videos, too.”\n\n“Well, there’s a link,” Acheson added.\n\n“Rodriguez,” the Duke interjected, “did you check air traffic to Denver and back for the weekend?”\n\n“Yessir. Nada. DHS ran a broader crosscheck of all LEOs in the region. Only one made the trip, a male, Tarrant County SO lieutenant, went up to Ft Collins for his mother’s funeral.”\n\n“Okay, that’s a blank, just like you called it, Ben. What about the victim on Turtle Creek?”\n\n“That would be,” the tech resumed, pausing to look at his notes, “one Rueben Salazar, thought to be a mule for one of the big border cartels, been running junk and girls out of Oak Cliff, DeSoto, Cedar Hill, and The Grove, and with some recent moves into Waco reported. Been using girls to move product, works ‘em for a while then allegedly dumps ’em.”\n\n“Dumps? You mean kills ‘em?”\n\n“Well sir, no one knows. Most of his girls, well, all of ‘em, probably, are illegals. There’s just no record of them, no way to track ’em.”\n\n“So, what are you telling me? There are drug runners up here using girls to move product and possibly killing them off after a while? And we have no idea how many have been killed, or even where the bodies are?”\n\n“Yessir,” the tech said, looking down at his notes. “That about sums it up.”\n\n“Holy Mother of God. So, this Salazar? Any porn on his drives?”\n\n“Stuff’s still downstairs in Evidence, not in the lab yet, sir.”\n\n“Expedite that. So,” The Duke said to the detectives in the room, “why does this one feel important? Why hit Salazar? Maybe he into porn. Or was he?”\n\n“Well,” Acheson replied, “he’s trafficking women, now purportedly killing them, too. That makes our Ninja an avenging angel, doesn’t it? Out doing what we can’t, or haven’t been able to do.”\n\n“Like that movie, Death Wish,” one of the detectives added.\n\n“Maybe,” Ben said. “Could be as simple as that, but I kinda doubt it. That Bronson character in the movie is motivated by revenge, isn’t he? Hoods break into his apartment, rape and kill his wife, beat up his daughter, rape her too, and the cops seem powerless to do anything about it so he goes on a killing spree. Becomes known as a vigilante killer. Public see him as doing the cops’ work for them, crime goes down as ‘scrotes get taken out, and in the end he becomes an invisible hero.”\n\n“So,” The Duke said, “are we missing something big here? Motive? Revenge is the oldest motive in the world, isn’t it?”\n\n“My guess is Salazar is the key,” Acheson replied. “He seems atypical, as a victim anyway, but something atypical might be on his computer, something that links him to the first two perps. Say,” Acheson said to the tech, “that email list? Is it possible that Feldman was getting images from either Walker or Salazar? Or the other way around? Are they linked somehow?”\n\n“Haven’t checked that angle, sir.” The tech got on his cell and made a call.\n\n“Well, Salazar was running women and drugs up here,” Acheson continued. “He had a working pipeline, a renewable, fresh supply of talent, so who’s to say he wasn’t running families, and families have little boys in ‘em. Maybe he was providing kids to these perps, for them to photograph, or have, uh, sex with. Or…oh sweet Jesus.”\n\n“What, Ben? What is it?”\n\n“Or to kill. Snuff vids,” Acheson groaned. “What if these guys were making snuff vids, then dumping the bodies. Kill the kids, then kill their moms. Leave no trails…”\n\n“BINGO!” cried the CSU tech. “Multiple IP hits on Feldman’s drive with Walker. As soon as we know Salazar’s IPs we’ll run crosschecks on that one too.”\n\n“Cloud storage,” Acheson said. “Check to see what kind of Cloud storage facilities Feldman used, see if Walker…”\n\n“Right! Got it!” The tech was back on his phone, relaying instructions.\n\n“Cloud storage?” The Duke asked.\n\n“Places to store huge files off site, video files mainly, encrypted and easy to share with known associates. Be hard to locate because he’s got so many…was he using Tor?”\n\n“Yeah,” the tech said, “they all do, but it’s not as bullet proof as they think. NSAs been inside Tor for years.”\n\n“So, we ask NSA to run down these guys, see if they were running a network together. Captain? That might have to go through the Chief, via the FBI.”\n\n“Got it, Ben. I’ll go have a chat with him. Say, do you think our suspect is leading us to these guys?”\n\nAcheson leaned back in his chair, looked up at the ceiling. “There’s not a doubt in my mind now, Captain. That’s exactly what she’s doing.”\n\n“So. Do we really want to run her down?”\n\nAcheson looked at The Duke. “She killed three of our own, sir.”\n\n“Yeah. She’s gotta pay for that.”\n\n“Uh-huh, but my guess is she’s always going to be at least two steps ahead of us. So in the end, Captain, when she’s got what she wants she’ll either turn herself in, or just disappear.”\n\nThe Duke nodded, left to go see the Chief, grateful this stuff hadn’t got too much attention in the press. Yet.\n\nBut it would. Stuff like this always did.\n\n+++++\n\nThe Duke, Acheson and a handful of detectives from CID were sitting behind little school-desks eating ribs and brisket at Sonny Bryans’ on Inwood Road, and had been talking about the case and where it was leading them – before their food was ready.\n\n“You know, potentially, this shit’s going to go international. Those pedophiles had, have, a huge network set up,” Acheson said, “so there’s just no way of knowing where this is going lead.”\n\n“God damn, these are good fucking baked beans!” The Duke cried. Acheson took that to mean it was time to stop talking shop.\n\n“Ribs ain’t too bad today, neither,” Deke Slater, one of the senior detectives added. “Still, too much sauce. Like mine dry, any-who.”\n\n“How’s that sam’ich, Ben? Got onions and relish over there if it’s too dry.”\n\n“It’s fine, sir.”\n\n“Ya know, this is still the best place in town,” The Duke continued, “Has been since the sixties, when Sonny was still cookin’. Heard he was a dentist! Did y’all know that? Come in and stoke the fires on his way to his office. Course, don’t know if that’s true or not, but it sounds good. Died of cancer. Shame. He was a good man.”\n\n“You knew him, Captain?”\n\n“Yup. Short man, nice smile. Had this old 60-something Mercedes, silver I think, drove it in every morning, always around four or so, almost always had a police escort, or so legend has it. When they opened up in the mornin’ there’d always be about ten squad cars out back, just waitin’. Shame he didn’t sell donuts, ya know? He’d a been a gozillionaire.”\n\nNods around the group, then The Duke’s cell phone pinged.\n\n“Dickinson,” he said into the thing as he took out a notepad. “Okay, go ahead…yup…yup…you don’t say. Well, fuck-a-doodle-do. Alright. We’ll see you back at CID in, say,” he looked over at the desert menu on the wall, “in about forty five minutes. Right. Bye.”\n\n“Anything new?” Acheson asked.\n\n“Probably. That cloud shit? They’re all linked. Internet addresses, too. Looks like twelve more here in town, on Feldman’s list anyway, and seems they share the same cloud storage thingy, so presumably we got eight or nine more potential targets. FBI’s running down the addresses now, they’re gonna meet us at the station, go over what they got with us, then maybe we’ll go pay some of these boys a little visit this afternoon. Say, Slim, is that peach cobbler worth a shit today?”\n\n___________________________________\n\nThe group got back to Central CID just before noon, just before a small contingent of FBI agents arrived, and The Duke took a seat, loosened his belt a notch, then lifted a cheek and cut loose a monster fart.\n\n“Jesus H Christ, Captain, smells like you ate fuckin’ road kill for lunch.”\n\n“Don’t smell half as bad as that after-shave crap you’re wearin’, Slim,” The Duke parried. “By the way. You ever heard of deodorant?”\n\nThen, a knock on the door.\n\n“Y’all come on in.”\n\nA handful of federal agents, easily identifiable in their blue suits, white shirts and red ties, walked into the room, but all the detectives’ eyes zeroed in on one agent in particular.\n\nAbout five foot six, trim, navy blue blazer and mid-length skirt, sheer stockings and…\n\n‘Navy blue pumps…’ Acheson said to himself. ‘About a seven, seven and a half.’ He stared at her shoes, then up at the woman’s eyes. ‘And looks exactly like the shoe in the fountain,’ he thought as he looked at her legs and shoes again. ‘A she’s got a runner’s legs, too.’\n\nHe looked up at her again, only now saw she had stopped in her tracks – and was staring at him.\n\nHe pursed his lips, turned red and looked away, then the woman came and sat next to him.\n\n“Genie. Genie Delaney. And you are?”\n\n“Ben Acheson.”\n\n“Oh, right, the motor-jock.” She held out her hand. “Read your reports, good work. Nice to meet you.” She then leaned over, almost conspiratorially, and whispered: “Say, you got, like, a shoe fetish thing going on there, Ben?”\n\nAcheson pulled away, turned even redder in the face.\n\n“Not your thing, huh?” Delaney said triumphantly as she leaned back in her chair.\n\n“Guys,” The Duke began, “This here’s Red Gibbons, SAC Dallas. Red? Why don’t you make up a few introductions?”\n\n“Well, let’s see, that’s John, Paul, George and Ringo,” the Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas Bureau said sarcastically as he pointed at four of the sunglass’d agents, “they do computer crime when they’re not playing video games. The shady looking pervert over there is, uh, Mick Jagger. Sex Crimes are his thing, when he’s not in the bathroom jacking off. The chick with the legs is, what the fuck, she’s Twiggy today, and she’s our profiler. A psychologist too, so watch what you say around her, boys, or you’ll be on the couch.”\n\n“So,” Acheson said. “We’re keeping this on a bogus, first name basis. Cool.”\n\n“Yeah, well, these guys are from D.C., but they’re not here, if you know what I mean.”\n\n“Ah. Quantum teleportation, is that it?” Acheson said.\n\n“Whatever, slick,” the SAC said sarcastically. “Anyway, where are you guys on this thing?”\n\n“Ben, this is pretty much your show. Why don’t you get these freaks up to speed?”\n\nAcheson jumped a little, looked down, saw Delaney’s shoe rubbing against the inside of his right ankle, then he looked up, caught a faint smile on her lips. He stood and went to the map on the wall, the new one with the vector drawn on it, then recounted events of the last week.\n\n“So, you’re the one that figured out the line linking the kill zones?” Gibbons said when Acheson finished. “How’d you come up with that?”\n\n“I’m not really sure. I think I was looking up at a jet on final, landing at Love. I was over on Maybank, and I could see the tire store, well, some trees by the store, and everything was lined up just right. From where I was to the tire store, and then there was this aircraft, a 737, right above the store, and on the same line. Anyway, I just started looking along that vector…”\n\n“Vector? You a math freak?”\n\n“BS in Engineering, UT Austin, sir.”\n\n“No shit? Not exactly common for a traffic cop?”\n\n“He’s a pilot too, Red,” The Duke added. “Air Force, American Airlines. Got dropped when the shit hit the fan back in ‘08.”\n\n“Okay,” Gibbons nodded. “So, that’s how you found the duffel?”\n\n“Yessir. And that’s when I started thinking more and more about the vector. Anyway, that’s what took me to Love Field, and that confirmed the theory.”\n\n“Interesting. And the shoe? You figured out the compass thing from that?”\n\n“Yessir, and the shoe at the Theatre Center, that it pointed to Salazar, in the bushes.”\n\n“How long had Salazar’s body been in there, Duke?”\n\n“About two hours, plus or minus.”\n\n“So she knew you were out of town, when you’d get back to the station, and about how long it would take you to figure out the next kill zone.”\n\n“Yessir, and I’d say her note mentioning Denver proves that.”\n\n“Why didn’t you guys set a trap for her there?” Delaney asked.\n\n“I fucked up,” Acheson said.\n\n“We fucked up,” The Duke added. “My fault. Shoulda seen that one coming.”\n\n“She wouldn’t have shown if you had,” Delaney said.\n\n“I know,” The Duke said, “and Acheson told me that too, at the time.”\n\n“Solid work, Acheson,” Gibbon said. “Why don’t you take a seat. We’ll fill y’all in with what we found, then we’d better hit the street, see if we can round up a few of these fuckers.”\n\nAcheson returned to his seat, Delaney leaned over again and whispered in his ear: “You have a cute ass, too.”\n\nHe turned beet red. Again.\n\nHer shoe was on his ankle a second later, and she poured it on now: “I wore these today, just for you.”\n\nHe sat back, pushed his chair away from her, then she winked at him.\n\n“Hey, Ben,” Gibbons said, smiling, “don’t let her fuck with your head too much, okay? She’s a pro, but I think she’s having way too much fun today.”\n\nDelaney sat back in her chair, a mock pout on her face, her lower lip leading the way. “You’re no fun, Red, you know that?”\n\n“Yeah, well, deal with it, Delaney – and stop dangling that shoe,” Gibbons smirked as he began handing out papers, “Anyway, these are the addresses associated with the IPs and links you gave us this morning. Most are known sex offenders, a few are registered, all have been confirmed as using the cloud storage box Feldman was using, and it shows a lot of recent activity from these guys, within the past 48 hours too. I say we break up into two man teams and hit them right now.”\n\n“Warrants?” Acheson asked.\n\n“No time, exigent circumstances.”\n\nThe Duke nodded. “Agree.” He looked at the printout in his hand, then around the room, and called out assignments. “Ben, why don’t you take Miss Twiggy there and hit the guy at 4408 McKinney.”\n\n‘Swell,’ Acheson groaned as he looked over at Genie – again.\n\n“Oh, this is gonna be fun,” Delaney said – as she rubbed his ankle again.\n\nThey left the station and were making their way through town to Central Expressway when she started in on him.\n\n“So, you a leg freak?”\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n“You were practically drooling over my legs when…”\n\n“I was looking at your shoes. They look like a match…”\n\n“But the color’s off, don’t you think, Darling?” Delaney said in a patently sultry voice.\n\n“Are you for real?”\n\n“Oh, alright. I’ll be good. So, you have a girlfriend?”\n\n“Jesus H Christ! Would you like me to pull over right here? Fuck you now, so we can get it over with?”\n\nShe laughed. “Not a bad idea, Ace, worth thinking about anyway, but maybe we ought to check out the place on McKinney first?”\n\nHe grumbled, looked ahead, still shaking his head. “And yes, I have a girlfriend.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Well, sort of.”\n\n“Uh huh.”\n\n“But your legs aren’t bad,” he said, smiling.\n\n“You oughta smell these things…”\n\n“What?”\n\n“The shoes! The leather! Spanish…and, well, it’s just kinky as hell.”\n\n“So, are we kinky?”\n\n“Play your cards right Ace, and you might find out.”\n\n“Uh-huh, So, I take it, you just got them?”\n\n“The shoes? FedEx, this morning. Hit the web, called the owner, ordered ‘em after I read your report. You know, for follow up, evidence, that kinda thing.”\n\n“Wow.”\n\n“So? You think they’re sexy?”\n\n“If you want to get there in one piece, you’ll knock it off, right now.”\n\nShe laughed again. “Never had anything quite like ‘em. Ever since I put ’em on this morning it’s been nonstop stares. Kinda cool.”\n\n“If you dig giving men woodies, yeah, I guess that’s kinda cool.”\n\n“Oh? You feeling a little stiff?” she said as she started to go for his ankle again.\n\n“Stop it!” Acheson said as he pulled onto Central.\n\n“Traffic’s not too bad,” she said, suddenly all business and looking at her GPS. “Better take Henderson.”\n\n“I know…”\n\n“Of course you do, darling. I’m so sorry.”\n\n“You just won’t let up, will you?” he said as he rolled his eyes. He exited on Henderson, turned across the highway, then south on the frontage road.\n\n“Looks like Oliver is the best cross street – and park just after you make the turn.”\n\nHe turned, pulled to a stop and parked the car, then checked out on the radio.\n\n“Is it an apartment?” he asked.\n\n“Yeah, back right corner, looks like,” she said, glancing at her iPhone. She looked up, then around the area, before pointing – “Right over there.”\n\n“Okay, let’s do it,” he said.\n\n“Glad you’re not in uniform,” she said. “What are you carrying?”\n\n“Sig, 226.”\n\n“Great, me too. Got extra clips in my coat pocket if you need ‘em.”\n\n“Yup, got three in mine.”\n\n“Cool.”\n\nThey walked to the alley behind the building, stopped at the tall iron fence that surrounded the parking area in the rear; Acheson hopped over, then drew his pistol and went into a low combat stance. When he heard Delaney, cursing her high heels now, behind him as he moved towards the building, a maroon brick two story affair that looked – vaguely – like Frank Lloyd Wright had inspired the design.\n\n“Which unit?” he whispered.\n\n“That one,” she pointed, then they ran for the door.\n\n“Fuck!” they whispered – in unison. The door was ajar, there was blood on the sill and on the floor just inside the door, and Delaney bent down, touched it, rubbed it between her fingers.\n\n“Still warm,” she whispered.\n\nAcheson kicked the door gently, stuck the Sig, then his head inside the doorway.\n\n“Stairs right here, covered in blood, looks like someone was just pulled down.”\n\n“You lead,” Delaney said, and Acheson slipped inside, began heading up the stairs – with his 9mm in the lead. There was a living room at the top of the stairs, a dining room to his left in the far corner. The kitchen was to his left, and he guessed the bedroom and bath would be behind and to his left. He led off to the kitchen and walked through it, then headed back toward the bedroom…\n\n“Oh, shit,” Acheson said as Delaney came up behind him.\n\n“Oh, bloody fucking…” She bent over, retched once, then vomited.\n\nThe little bedroom was almost completely bathed in blood, there were splatters on the ceiling, huge sprays on the walls, but worst of all was the bed. A middle aged male, decapitated, penis in mouth, lay on the floor, and a little Mexican kid was tied by wrists and ankles to bedposts, spread-eagled, obviously dead and floating in a pool of almost black blood; what appeared to have been a fairly sophisticated video recorder, on a tripod, lay by the foot of the bed. Acheson looked at the rig, guessed it had been set-up at the foot of the bed, but now lay in pieces on the carpet. The CF card was gone, the battery too, so everything in memory was wiped.\n\n“You better call Gibbons; I’ll go get the car, get dispatch on…”\n\n“Okay…” Delaney groaned.\n\n“You alright?” Acheson looked at Delaney. She seemed pale, more than upset.\n\n“No. No, I’m not.”\n\n“I know. Sometimes it helps if you barf, sometimes it doesn’t.”\n\n“So I’ve heard.”\n\nThey laughed.\n\n“Yeah, I must be famous by now. Well, I’ll be right back.”\n\n“I’m going with you,” she said.\n\nHe turned, looked at her. “What is it?”\n\n“Something, I don’t know, monstrous. Evil. It’s everywhere, and it’s close, too,” she said, shivering, then she looked at the bed again. “Poor fucking kid. Never had a chance in this world, did he?”\n\n“Don’t think about that right now. Think about the evidence, the scene.”\n\n“You’re right. Sorry.”\n\n“Okay, let’s get downstairs. You stand outside the front door; we have to secure the scene.”\n\nShe nodded her head, seemed unsteady. “Yeah.”\n\n“Give me your hand,” he said when he got her to the top of the stairs. “You look kind of shaky.”\n\nHe led her down the stairs, noticed she was still shivering when he got her out under the mid-summer sun. “Can you call Gibbons?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Okay, I’ll be right back.” Acheson ran to the iron fence and jumped it, then ran over to the car and got on the radio.\n\n“741 to 700,” he called, using his temporary and The Duke’s call numbers.\n\n“Go ahead, 41.”\n\n“We have multiple Signal 1s at this location.”\n\n“You aren’t the only one, 41. Does it look fresh?”\n\n“10/4, yes sir, maybe an hour, maybe less.”\n\n“700, get back-up headed to 741s location, Code 3!”\n\n“700, at 1418 hours.”\n\nAcheson grabbed his hand unit, cursed himself for forgetting it, then jumped out of the car and drew his weapon just in time to hear Delaney scream, followed by rapid bursts of gunfire.\n\nThen… silence.\n\n“741, shots fired this location!”\n\n“741 at 1419 hours.”\n\nHe ran for the fence, jumped it, sprinted across the parking lot and found Delaney breathing heavily, blood all over her blouse and jacket and a defensive knife wound on her left forearm.\n\n“That way,” she said, pointing towards McKinney Avenue. “Black one piece suit, hood, about a fifteen inch blade,” she said, gasping. “Black hair maybe,” she said airily as she slumped to the ground.\n\n“741, Signal 33, officer down behind 4408, am in foot pursuit of suspect at this time!” he yelled into the hand unit.\n\n“741 at 1420 hours.”\n\nHe heard sirens everywhere as he ran between buildings and out onto the grassy lawn in front of the apartment building. He shuddered to a stop, turned and looked both ways down McKinney.\n\nNothing.\n\n“What the Fuck!”\n\nHe heard a car peeling out behind 4408 and ran back between the buildings for the alley, ran right past Delaney and hopped the iron fence again, then stopped in the alley.\n\nNothing.\n\n“741, lost contact, heard a car leaving the area at high speed, going back to down officer.”\n\n“741 at 1421 hours, paramedics advise ETA less than two minutes.”\n\n“Received.”\n\nHe jumped the fence again and got to Delaney’s side; she was pale, breathing rapidly, and he pulled her coat open, saw a massive slashing wound across her belly, could make out her intestines through a pool of blood.\n\n“Did you see the car?” he asked.\n\nShe nodded. “Bla-ck. Camaro. May-be – mid 80s. T-tops. Clean. Two people inside, both masked.”\n\n“741, stand by for BOLO!”\n\n“741, go ahead at 1422 hours.”\n\n“741, BOLO black mid-80s Chevrolet Camaro, t-tops, two occupants. Vehicle described as clean…”\n\n“I seen ‘em.”\n\nAcheson spun around, saw an old homeless man standing in the alley behind the fence, and he could smell alcohol on his breath from ten feet away.\n\n“Describe them!”\n\n“Yeah, okay. Only one I saw good was a gal, had on some kind of leotard like thing. Black. Her skin was real white, black hair. Had on…”\n\nSirens were close now, Acheson ran to the gate and hit the inside release and the powered gate started retracting just as the Fire Department’s ambulance unit pulled onto Oliver.\n\n“In here!” he yelled, waving his arms. When the driver saw him he turned and ran back to Delaney.\n\n“They’re here, kid, just hang on.”\n\n“Not feelin’ too hot, Ace. Sorry.”\n\nHe ran his hands through her hair, looked her in the eye. “C’mon. Just fight it a few more minutes. Keep breathing! You can do it!”\n\nShe nodded her head just as the first paramedic ran up.\n\nAcheson backed out of the way, turned to the homeless man. “Okay, she had on what?”\n\n“Well, like that girl there. High heels. Real nice ones.”\n\n“Color?”\n\n“Black, man, like everything else she had on.”\n\n“741, more BOLO information. Suspect one, white female, black leotard, black high heels, very white skin, black hair, and, wait one…what did you say?”\n\n“She had a big knife, man, and a gun, a pistol, in a black shoulder holster.”\n\n“741, suspect one armed with a knife and a handgun in a shoulder holster.”\n\n“741, at 1424 hours.”\n\n“Okay, did you see the driver of the car?” Acheson asked as he watched one paramedic starting CPR, while another started an IV.\n\n“Not real good.”\n\n“Male, or female.”\n\n“Oh, a girl, same black hair, same clothes.”\n\n“Anything else stand out?”\n\n“Yeah, the car. It had Oklahoma license plates.”\n\n“You sure?”\n\n“Yeah…”\n\n“741, BOLO update, suspect two probably a white female, same description, black hair, black clothing. Suspect vehicle reported to have Oklahoma license plates.”\n\n“741, at 1426 hours.”\n\n“700 to 741 on tactical, how’s your partner?”\n\nAcheson switched to the encrypted TAC channel, then keyed the mic: “Alive. Multiple knife wounds, bleeding out, looks bad. CPR and IV going now.”\n\n“Be there in about five.”\n\n“10/4. Sir, the suspect dragged a body from here, to their car, wherever that was. There’s gonna be a blood trail. We need a lot of manpower here, right now.”\n\n“I’ll take care of it, you look around but stay close to Delaney, ride with her in the box if we don’t get there first. Find out anything you can, got it?”\n\n“Yessir.”\n\n“We’re going to transport now,” a paramedic said. “You coming?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\n+++++\n\n“We’ve got a blood expander going now, and her BP’s stabilized. Bad belly wound, but it doesn’t look like the intestine or stomach is cut, so probably no peritonitis. There’s a really, really good cutter at Parkland right now, guy named Sanchez, and he’s standing by in the ER. My guess is she’s going to be fine.”\n\nAcheson held her hand, squeezed it, and he felt her squeeze his hand in return: “Hear that, kid,” he said gently in her ear, “everything’s going to be okay.”\n\nShe opened her eyes, looked at him oddly. “Are you crying?” she asked through the clouded green oxygen mask.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes. “Guess so. Sorry.”\n\nShe squeezed his hand again. “Don’t be sorry. It’s not so bad.”\n\n“Shouldn’t have left you alone.”\n\n“Bullshit. You did everything right. I screwed the pooch, lost my concentration.”\n\n“You remember anything?”\n\n“Pretty sure I hit her in the arm, left arm, maybe her side too, like near the left ribcage. And her eyes. They were bright blue. Like really bright.”\n\n“Contact lenses?”\n\n“Probably. And the hair. It’s a wig.”\n\n“Witness said she was wearing shoes like yours.”\n\nShe thought for a moment. “Didn’t see that, but it wouldn’t surprise me.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“They’re nice shoes, Ace. Got you going, didn’t they?”\n\n“They sure did, baby.”\n\n“Why’re you calling me that?”\n\n“Because I don’t want you to leave me.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nHe shrugged, shook his head. “I guess because…”\n\nHer eyes fluttered, closed. The EKG began to dance, her BP started falling.\n\n“Step on it, manno!” the medic called out to the driver. “She’s crashing!”\n\n“‘Bout three minutes, Steve! Pump some more of that secret sauce in the bag!”\n\nThe ambulance pulled into the ER’s parking area and backed up to the huge, covered unloading ramp; a team of nurses and medics was waiting and pulled Delaney from the box, then rushed her through sliding doors into Trauma 2; Acheson ran in behind them, only to be pulled out of the room by a uniformed officer. Acheson stepped back, pulled out his badge and the other officer let him go.\n\n“Who is that,” the officer asked.\n\n“FBI.”\n\n“Oh, shit. Say, you wouldn’t be Acheson, would you?”\n\n“Yup.”\n\nThe other officer stepped back. “Hey, man, that’s cool…just don’t, you know, like barf on me, okay?”\n\n+++++\n\nThe Duke, Red Gibbons and Acheson sat in the surgical waiting room somewhere in the UT Southwestern hospital complex, and they were worried. Delaney’s operations was supposed to last two hours max, but she had been under now for almost five hours.\n\nFor the first hour or so they had talked about the case, and the fact that the Camaro had been abandoned a few miles away and, not surprisingly, that the car had been reported stolen a few days hours earlier by some kids visiting from Tulsa. And again, no surprise, there were no unaccounted for fingerprints in the car, only a single Pepe Jimenez pump in the back seat, size seven, this one Navy blue.\n\nJust like Delaney’s.\n\nAs the second hour approached – and passed, the talk turned more to Delaney, her background, and Gibbons talked about her like he knew her pretty well.\n\n“She’s just a kid, you know? Bright as hell, a psych major at Penn, went from grad school straight to the Academy at Quantico. Valedictorian. Hates guns, so with her background went into profiling. Seemed a natural, ya know what I mean? But she likes to play games, fuck with people’s heads. Been bounced out of two postings, doesn’t make friends. Probably intimidates too many people, those she doesn’t irritate the hell out of, anyway.”\n\n“No boyfriend we need to call?” Acheson asked.\n\n“She’s cute, Ben, but watch out. Still waters – know what I mean?”\n\n“So that means, I take it, no boyfriend?”\n\n“No one. You spend enough time around her and you’ll get it.”\n\nThe Duke watched this exchange knowingly, looked at Ben and saw all the signs, then shook his head. ‘Well,’ he said to himself, ‘you never know when it’s going to hit, do you?’\n\nPassing four hours, Ben was almost beside himself. He was up and down, pacing back and forth, looking at the clock on the wall one minute, at his wristwatch the next, then a few minutes later a surgeon in bloody scrubs came into the waiting room.\n\nRed and The Duke came over, stood next to Ben.\n\n“A real mess in there,” the doctor began. “Thought all we had was a knife wound, but we found this in there.” He held up a bullet, and the three cops’ eyes went wide. “.223, best guess, anyway. AR-15 probably. Too bad she wasn’t wearing a vest.”\n\n“Is she okay,” Acheson asked, now almost pleading.\n\n“Well, yeah. Her gut’s a mess, the bullet’s the problem, though. Why she crashed, anyway. Nicked her aorta. Close call. Tim Snyder, a great vascular cutter, just happened to be around the corner when we put out the first Code Blue, but he was there when we needed him. He’s still in there, finishing up. Her lucky day, I guess. Not too many docs around here could’ve handled a clusterfuck like this, and he’s the best we got, period.”\n\n“So, she’s gonna make it?” Acheson asked pointedly.\n\n“Well, yeah. Didn’t I just say that?”\n\n“Thank you, doctor,” The Duke said, taking Ben by the shoulder and turning him away. “Say, let’s go get some dinner. Red? Wanna tag along?”\n\n“Might as well,” he said, looking at Acheson and shaking his head. “Where to?”\n\n“Want some ribs? Sonny’s is still open, and they’re just across the street?”\n\n“Didn’t we eat there, for lunch?” Acheson asked through a fog.\n\n“What, you some kinda Yankee? Can’t eat Bar-B-Q two times in one day?”\n\n“Well, I kinda wanted to keep my cholesterol under 1500, at least once in my life, anyway.”\n\n“Shee-yit, then don’t eat two desserts this time, Meathead!”\n\n+++++\n\nHe went up to her room after The Duke and Gibbons took off, sat up beside her while she slept – until he too fell asleep – sitting up in an old blue vinyl recliner. Sometime in the night a nurse came in and reclined his chair, covered him with a blanket, and he slept through a world of nightmare images: little boys being cut up by butchers, drowning in oceans of blood. Then he woke with a start around five in next morning – when another nurse was drawing blood and checking vitals.\n\n“You’ve been here all night?” he heard Delaney ask.\n\nHe sat up, rubbed his eyes, smiled when he saw her face. “Yeah, guess so. Where are all the horses?”\n\n“Horses?” Delaney said. “What are you…”\n\n“The ones that walked through my mouth. Tastes like one took a shit in here.”\n\n“Goddamn!” she cringed. “Don’t make me laugh, you asshole!”\n\nHe came to her side. “Hurts, huh?”\n\n“Feels like I’ve been shot.”\n\n“You were.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“.223. Just missed your right kidney, nicked your aorta.”\n\n“Shot?”\n\n“In the back, kid. Whoever these bitches are, they’re playing hardball.”\n\n“That’s right. There’s more than one.”\n\n“It’s worse than that, kiddo. Best estimate is, as of now, anyway, there’s at least four two-girl teams out there.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Three of the other search teams ran into them, when they went to their target houses.”\n\n“This is unreal. Have you ever heard of anything like this before?”\n\nAcheson shook his head. “No one has. Gibbons told me last night the FBI is bringing a few hundred agents down from D.C. Full court press, I think he called it.”\n\n“How long am I going to be here? Anyone tell you?”\n\n“Depends on your aorta, how it heals. Maybe a while, so maybe you’re taking an early medical retirement.”\n\n“That bad?”\n\nHe nodded. “Could be, from what the doc told Gibbons. You’re lucky to be here right now; that’s what an OR nurse told me, anyway.”\n\n“Got that right, sweetie,” the nurse finishing up her rounds added. “You coded, twice. Lucky ain’t the half of it, sister!”\n\n“Coded?”\n\n“You was dead, sweetheart. Dead times two. Now, can I get you anything? Pain alright?”\n\n“Feels okay. Kind of a bad burn in my back, that’s all.”\n\n“Okay, I’ll slip you something in your IV. You’ll sleep good for a while, too.”\n\n“Could you give us a few minutes?” Delaney asked.\n\n“Sure. Just hit that call button when you’re ready.” The nurse left the room.\n\n“So, I remember you crying,” she said.\n\n“Yup. Like I said. Sorry.”\n\n“And I remember you squeezing my hand.”\n\n“Guilty, your honor.”\n\n“So, uh, I’m not going to ask any questions. Well, maybe one.”\n\n“Fire away.”\n\n“Are you, like, crazy or something?”\n\nHe laughed. “I wasn’t. Not until I met you.”\n\n“Oh. What was it? My sparkling wit, or the shoes?”\n\n“I’ll never tell.”\n\n“Prick,” she said with a smile.\n\n“Douchebag.”\n\nThey both laughed, then she winced, one eye closed tightly.\n\n“Time for Mister Morpheus, me thinks,” she said.\n\nThen Acheson’s phone rang.\n\nNumber blocked. He ignored it. Then it rang again. And he ignored it.\n\nThen again.\n\nHe answered.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Tell her we’re sorry.” It sounded like a middle aged woman, mid-western accent.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Delaney. Agent Delaney.”\n\n“And who would you be?” He reached down, put the phone on speaker.\n\n“A friend of Anne’s. I shot Agent Delaney.”\n\nDelaney’s eyes went wide.\n\n“So, why’d you shoot her?”\n\n“I was trying to knock the gun out of her hand.”\n\n“Nice shooting. Any of your people hurt?”\n\n“No. Tell Delaney, when she gets back to D.C. she needs more time on the range.”\n\n“Right. So, when is this going to end?”\n\n“We’re almost done. In Dallas, anyway. Then we’re moving on.”\n\n“Moving on? We?”\n\n“We accomplished what we set out to do. We’re moving on.”\n\n“Don’t suppose you want to tell me who ‘we’ is, do you?”\n\n“Hang on.”\n\nThey heard a phone being exchanged between people.\n\n“Hello?” It was a new voice, an older woman’s.\n\n“Acheson here.”\n\n“Oh, hello, Ben.”\n\n“Excuse me, but have me met?”\n\n“Only indirectly, but yes, we have.”\n\n“Oh? Are you Anne?”\n\n“No names, Ben. Not yet.”\n\n“Got it. So, maybe someday?”\n\n“Maybe, but I owe you another apology.”\n\n“Oh? What for?”\n\n“Amy,” she said, “and the other officers. I didn’t find out Breedlove was a friend of yours until yesterday. Were you close?”\n\n“Friends. From Academy.”\n\n“Oh. I understand. Well, I’m sorry.”\n\n“I’m curious,” Delaney interrupted, “why are you calling now?”\n\n“Agent Delaney? You’re awake?”\n\n“It’s either that, or this is one seriously fucked up dream…”\n\nThe voice on the other end laughed, and they heard other women’s voices in the background laughing as well.\n\n“Obviously I’m not going to answer that, Agent Delaney, but you’re on the right, shall we say, track?”\n\nThen the line went dead.\n\n“Now what did she mean by…Ben, what is it?”\n\nBut Acheson had gone stiff, as if an icy hand had suddenly gripped his heart.\n\nHe looked at his iPhone, found The Duke’s home number and dialed it.\n\n“Ben? That you?”\n\n“Sir, I know where the bodies are, and there’s something else.”\n\n“Ben, it’s like five in the morning. Where are you?”\n\n“Sir, with Delaney. They just called, here.”\n\n“Who? Who called you?”\n\n“Them. The suspects. Just now.”\n\n“Fuck-a-doodle-do!” Acheson could tell the old man was now wide awake.\n\n“Meet me at Fair Park, sir. On Washington, by the train exhibit, and get a CSU rolling.”\n\n“Do we need a TAC team?”\n\n“I doubt it, sir, but better safe than sorry. They told me they’re finished in Dallas, and moving on.”\n\n“What? Told you? You believe ’em?”\n\n“Yessir. I think so. Still, it could be a trap.”\n\n“Okay. Give me…uh…we’ll be there in about forty five minutes or so.”\n\nAcheson cut the connection, looked at Delaney.\n\n“Holy mother-fucking guacamole,” she said.\n\n“I know. Gotta go, but…mind if I kiss you first?”\n\n“If you don’t, I’ll shoot you myself.”\n\nHe leaned over, kissed her gently on the lips.\n\n“That feels nice,” she sighed. “I could get used to that.”\n\nHe kissed her again. Longer this time, and deeper, then he leaned back, ran his fingers through her hair, and noticed her eyes were locked on his.\n\n“I’ve been waiting for you, for a long time,” Delaney said.\n\n“Have you now?” She winced again, took a deep breath. “Pain getting worse?”\n\n“A little, yes.”\n\n“I’ll get the nurse.”\n\nShe nodded, but the skin on her face looked pale and waxy, and her brow was lined with beads of perspiration. “Ben, be careful. I doubt this is over. These aren’t the kind of people that leave loose ends, and I sense something much bigger is going on.”\n\nHe nodded. “I think you’re dead right.”\n\nChapter 11\n\nAcheson took surface streets through town as dawn came to the city, and he made his way to Haskell Avenue and streaked east through light traffic towards Fair Park. As he approached Washington he turned off his headlights and wound around the convoluted intersection until he was sitting a few hundred yards away from a fairly large exhibit of old steam engines and passenger cars.\n\nWithin minutes he spotted The Duke’s Ford, followed by several large dark blue step-vans, all with their headlights off.\n\nAcheson flicked his lights once, and the caravan headed for his position.\n\n“Seen anything,” The Duke asked as he pulled up to Acheson’s open window.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Okay, so why are we here?”\n\n“A pun.”\n\n“A pun?”\n\n“She said we were on the right track. This exhibit is right on the line, sir.”\n\n“Oh, fuck-a-doodle-do.”\n\n“Yessir. My sentiments, exactly.”\n\nThe Duke picked up his radio’s mic: “700 to all units, let’s move in on foot, surround the train exhibit. Anything in there moves, kill it, ask for ID later. Got that?”\n\nSeventy Tac Team officers poured out of the vans and sprinted around the fenced-in exhibit; Acheson and The Duke followed and went to a gate in the fence; the lock was destroyed. Some sort of acid had been poured on it, the metal had simply melted away, leaving the gate ajar.\n\n“Blood?” Acheson said, pointing down at the ground. “Is that blood?”\n\nA Tac sergeant came over, took out his SureFire and hit the ground with it’s intense beam.\n\n“Looks red to me,” the sergeant said.\n\n“Okay Collins, get ten of your best over here, and let’s follow the trail.”\n\nThe sergeant turned, called out names and a new team formed and assembled by the gate.\n\n“Weapons free,” The Duke whispered hoarsely. “Y’all follow me.” He led off, the TAC sergeant by his side, Acheson just behind, and the rest of the team fanned out beside and behind the leaders, H&K MP-5s sweeping the area as they followed the blood trail…\n\n…which led between two rows of old “heavyweight” passenger cars, and ended at an old Railway Post Office baggage/mail car…\n\n…and the lock on this car had been similarly defeated; drooping bits of melted metal lay on the sill, and had dropped down onto the ballast below in slagging heaps…\n\n…The Duke slid the door open…\n\n…The Tac sergeant shined his light inside…\n\n…and Acheson looked in, then fell to his knees and started vomiting. Again.\n\n+++++\n\nThe rest of the pedophiles were inside the baggage car, hanging from meathooks strung out evenly from the ceiling – heads lay below each disemboweled body, a severed penis in each mouth, testes in each eye socket, and seething piles of warm intestine lay oozing all over the old oak floor.\n\nThe sun was up now, and it was getting hot – very, very hot. Acheson took notes for his report but was already getting tired of all this detective crap. He wanted nothing more than to get on his BMW and hit the streets, write a few tickets even, if only because all this ‘blood & guts’ crime shit was starting to get on his nerves. He popped another Tums and chewed the chalky crud, then swallowed it.\n\n“Here, have a donut,” The Duke said, holding out a fresh, warm glazed one.\n\nAcheson scowled at the thing. “No, thanks.”\n\n“Man, ain’t you figured out why cops eat donuts yet?”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Well, Meathead, it’s because nothing, and I mean nothing neutralizes stomach acid faster than a fresh glazed donut and a pint of ice-cold milk. And besides, they kinda help keep things in perspective.”\n\n“Well then, you better give me a couple.”\n\n“See? You ain’t as dumb as you look, Meathead.”\n\n“Got Milk?”\n\n“Hey, beggars can’t be choosers.”\n\n“Swell.”\n\n“Got any more of them Tums?”\n\n“Yup.” Acheson handed his bottle over. “Perspective, huh?”\n\n“One born every minute, Meat. Did you stay up with her all night?”\n\n“Think I slept some.”\n\n“How is she?”\n\n“Better.”\n\n“I could see it in your eyes last night. She hit you like a ton of brick"
