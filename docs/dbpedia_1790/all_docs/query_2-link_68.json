        "text": "Happy New Year! Even though I am (a few weeks) late, I wanted to express my thankfulness for an exciting new year. Thank you to EVERYONE who made Løv Bridal Sartorial a success in our first year, whether you bought a dress/suit, shared our posts, told friends about us or gave us an encouraging note, we appreciate you! I am so thankful for all the customers, especially those who have become our friends!\n\nBridal has been a part of me for over half my life, since I was 16 years old. No kidding, I have helped thousands of brides throughout my life and am so honored to be able to do so in our own boutique. No matter what life has thrown as us, I have always known I wanted to be there for brides during this time of their lives. Over the past 6 years, Oscar and I bought this building and completely renovated the upstairs to live in. With the help of great family and friends, we renovated what is now Løv Bridal Sartorial in 5 months! Whew!\n\nYou are letting me live my best life, where I get to do what I love while still getting to have lunch with my kids (they usually bring lunch downstairs to me!). I get to work with my best friend to create bespoke suits in a truly tag team effort. Oscar is truly the fabric expert and can help find the perfect shade of whatever color you are dreaming while I do the measurements. It is so rewarding to exceed expectations in custom suiting because of the amazing fit and fabrics.\n\nWe continuously seek out the best makers in Europe so you can find truly unique pieces at Løv Bridal Sartorial. I had a bride tell me today she had all of these ideas in her head but she hasn’t been able to put them all together in one dress until now. That is why we do what we do: to make you feel extraordinary. There is only one you, and we help you feel as amazing as you look.\n\nCheers to 2024 and we can’t wait to create something beautiful with you!\n\nWith Løv,\n\nOscar and Katie Durán\n\nWhen October hits, it (typically) feels like fall is finally here (except for this weekend). Everything pumpkin from flavors to décor is evident and we are all here for it.\n\nPeople don’t always correlate October with brides, but October has become such a busy month for weddings. Did you know that 1/5 of all weddings take place in October, and September-November is the busiest wedding season? While everyone is in the wedding mood, we decided it’s a great time to have some fun at Løv Bridal Sartorial!\n\nOctober 6-16 Eddy K Trunk Show\n\nIf you love sparkle, or simple, or sleek, or boho, or lux, there is a dress for you in this trunk show! Eddy K dresses are designed in Milan to create beautiful reflections of bold, powerful women. An Eddy K bride values exquisite designs without a couture price tag. Book your appointment for the next two weeks find these show stopping dresses.\n\nWho ‘s getting married? We are kicking off wedding shopping season with some great events! Whether you are looking for a wedding dress for your destination wedding in two months or are planning an elaborate soiree next year, our wedding dresses will fit your vision.\n\nA bride wants to be memorable on her wedding day; she wants something that reflects her style while not looking like another bride. At Løv Bridal Sartorial, we want you, the bride, to be extraordinary. That’s why we have carefully curated a team of artists to have the most stellar, unique, extraordinary dresses in our store that you won’t find anywhere close. We have exclusive rights to a few designers that won’t sell to any other boutique in Nebraska or Iowa because who wants to try on the same dress that other stores carry?\n\nWe want to celebrate YOU this month! Between bringing in exclusive designs to giving you some unbelievable opportunities on samples, Løv Bridal has your dress. Yes, we have YOUR wedding dress!\n\nLa Curve/Anna Kara Sample Sale July 28-August 5\n\nFor the first time, our La Curve and Anna Kara dresses are going on sale!\n\nAnna Kara\n\nAnna Kara is a bride favorite with her clean silhouettes, buttery soft fabric and delicate details. Almost every bride tries on an Anna Kara dress but it’s time to make room for 2024 dresses.\n\nRegular price: $2,600-$3,200\n\nSale price: $1,400-$2,500\n\nChances are, those details were reserved for you and your fiancé and your opinions were the only ones that mattered in those decisions. However, we have it engrained in our minds that wedding dress shopping should include everyone: your mother-in-law, sisters in law, bridesmaids, grandmas, mom, sisters, but that also gives them the mindset that their opinion will help shape what you will wear.\n\nShopping for a wedding dress is a very emotional experience for everyone. It's emotional for the bride but it can also be emotional for the mom, sisters and family because it's the realization that the bride is no longer a little girl and will be a part of someone else’s family. Sometimes objections to the dress aren't even about the dress but about how they feel a bride should look. Take it easy on yourself and don't allow the pressure of 6 opinions sway how you feel about a dress.\n\nThink really hard about who's opinion really matters. Will your mom's opinion of the dress keep you from purchasing something you love? What if you absolutely love the dress but your sister doesn't? Will her opinion beat out yours? Will Aunt Mary very vocally give it the thumbs down because it isn't her taste? Do you want their honest opinions, or do you want validation in your dress choice because it's a decision made without your fiancé?\n\nMy professional tip is to invite 1-2 people who have your best interest at heart. It could be your mom, it could be your sister, or it could be two of your best friends. I had a bride last week whose mom didn't live nearby, and she came with two of her friends. Let me tell you, those girls were the biggest hype girls ever. They were excited for her when she came out in a dress, they complimented things they liked about each dress even if it wasn't her favorite but waited to tell the bride it wasn't a favorite until after the bride said it first.\n\nFriends and family; be gentle with the bride. This is a very big wedding decision that she is making without her fiance. Maybe she has been pinteresting for months and has an idea of what likes. On the other hand, maybe she does not like shopping for regular clothes and shopping for a wedding dress is giving her lots of anxiety. One her wedding dress shopping day, it is your job to build her up and encourage her. Be the best hype ladies you can be!\n\nBrides: If you want to involve more people in the dress experience, take part in one of our new reveal appointments. This occurs once your dress has come in and you try your dress on for the first time: this is a chance for your loved ones to get a “sneak peek” of the dress before the big day! A wedding is a big day for everyone; your friends and family are coming together to support your marriage to your fiancé, but they don't have to be a part of the planning decisions to be involved. There will be many showers and engagement parties where you can spend special time with them while celebrating your marriage.\n\nNow it’s time to grab your trusted friends/family and make an appointment! We are open Monday, Thursday and Friday from 10-5, Saturday from 9-4 and Sunday 11-4. We look forward to helping you find the special one!\n\nWith Løv,\n\nOscar and Katie Duran\n\nPlanning a wedding can be stressful. There are so many details and the clock is always ticking; it's easy to find yourself overwhelmed and not knowing when to do what task. Don't panic when you’ve starting your shopping; we will keep you on track to find the best dress in a timeframe that will let you enjoy the shopping experience while checking something big off your list.\n\nIt seems like venues now determine when your wedding is based on their availability. Once you have your venue and date locked down, you can start making other plans. Wedding dresses typically take between 5 and 8 months to come in at Løv Bridal Sartorial, depending on the designer. We have carefully chosen designers who have their own studios; they create the dresses `in house instead of having them mass produced in a factory where they have to wait on other designers’ schedules too.\n\nNext, discuss who will be paying for the dress. Will you be paying for the dress on your own? Is a loved one pitching in to help you get the dress of your dreams? We do not require payment in full to order a dress to assist you in your wedding budget planning. However, you will get a discount on the dress if you pay in full.\n\nWhen you order your wedding dress, contact your seamstress so you can get on their list. Even though your dress isn’t in yet, it would be crunching on time if your dress came in 4 months before the wedding but the seamstress already had as many dresses as she could handle.\n\nEnjoy the shopping experience! Even though there is no exact time frame of when to order a dress, I suggest starting around a year before the wedding. If you start shopping a year and a half before the wedding, your wedding style can change between now and then. If you start shopping 4 months before the wedding, your best option is to purchase a sample dress. That way, you don’t have to wait for it to come in and can take it home that day.\n\nFor the most relaxed yet professional wedding dress shopping experience, contact Katie at Løv Bridal Sartorial at hello@lovbridal.com .\n\nOscar has always loved traveling. Right before we met, he just returned from his second trip to Peru through UNO. We laugh because when we met, he asked, “If you could go anywhere, where would it be?” I eagerly shared Colorado.\n\nHe paused, being the international traveler that he was and then there is me, “traveling” to the next state over. “Oh,” he said, “have you never been there before?”\n\n“Oh I’ve been a lot of times, I really love it there!” It makes for a funny story about my different we are: my contentment to stay and his sense of adventure.\n\nLately, we have had so many brides planning destination weddings. The mountains of Italy, beautiful waterfronts of Mexico, sandy beaches Belize, beauty of Vietnam; so many places to see! These beautiful destination wedding locations made us want to get married all over again.\n\nDestination weddings aren't just a quick trip. Couples are planning week long adventures for their guests to truly enjoy the destination and experience a relaxing vacation.\n\nDon't forget about the men! Full suits aren't ideal for beach weddings, but our made to measure shirts and pants are the perfect way for the groom to get something amazing to wear. Going for the linen and khaki look? Why not pick something that fits them and they can wear again?\n\nNow is the next question: what does a bride wear to a destination wedding? The style used to be short dresses or very simple dresses, but anything the bride wants is acceptable.\n\nWe have put together our favorite destination wedding dresses at Løv Bridal Sartorial. You can definitely wear these for non-destination weddings; they look gorgeous everywhere!\n\nWarren Buffett once said in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in chief Andy Serwer, “By far the best investment you can make is in yourself.” At Løv Bridal Sartorial, we whole heartedly believe this to be true.\n\nOscar has been wearing suits every day to work for the past three years. He dutifully purchased his two shades of navy and two shades of grey suits to mix and match with his dress shirts. However, he wasn’t feeling great. If it fit through his shoulders, it didn’t fit his waist correctly. If it fit through his waist, it sometimes looked like he was wearing football pads. It wasn’t until he purchased his first made to measure suit that he really understood how a suit should fit.\n\nWith a made to measure suit, we make every aspect of a suit fit impeccably. Guys come to us, frustrated with arms not being long enough, waists being too boxy and tight through the arms. The beauty of a custom suit is we take measurements for each area to create a piece that fits you not only physically but also as an extension of you personality.\n\nOur made to measure suits are hand crafted by renowned makers in Italy, arguably one of the biggest fashion countries in the world. An impeccable amount of detail is taken into each fully customized suit. The fit, color, buttons, lining and even stitching color are just the basis of a made to measure suit.\n\nEach suit is carefully constructed with canvas, meaning a layer of horsehair is intertwined in the inside that molds to one’s body, so overtime, it actually fits the body even more properly as opposed to breaking down like many off the peg suits. We have seen countless times the increased amount of confidence that is exuded when a man puts on his custom suit.\n\nInvest in yourself. You don’t need to buy a new wardrobe every few years. Instead, invest in a few quality pieces that will last many years to come. Let us help you create a piece that will feel like nothing you have ever worn before.\n\nwww.lovsartorial.com\n\n(402) 620-4395\n\nWith Løv,\n\nThe Duráns\n\nQ: When should I wear a cathedral veil?\n\nContrary to its name, a cathedral veil doesn’t have to only be worn in cathedrals. I recommend cathedral veils for a few reasons.\n\n1. You want to compliment the details of your dress. If you have a dress that is busy with lace, beads, etc., a cathedral veil can add to the grandness of the bridal look without taking away from it.\n\n2. You want to dress up a simple look. I absolutely love a lace trimmed veil with a simple wedding dress. It can give the illusion of a detailed train without wearing a dress with a long train.\n\nQ: When shouldn’t I wear a veil?\n\nAgain, it is personal preference. It’s popular to take pictures outside with cathedral veils blowing in the wind, which is great, but I do not recommend cathedral veils for outdoor ceremonies. Concrete and dirt are not materials that do well with fine tulle veils and if there is any sort of breeze, it will keep blowing and not lay how you want. Even fingertip length veils can become a distraction on a breezier day. I love a good headpiece for outdoor weddings and forgo the veil. I don’t know any outdoor wedding brides that said, “I wish I wore a veil.” :)\n\nQ: I like the idea of walking down the aisle with the veil covering my face but I don’t want it to look poofy. What can I do?\n\nThere are two types of veils that get this effect. A double layered veil Is two pieces of tulle fabric sewn together onto a comb. The wider the fabric is bunched on the comb, the more volume there will be. A typical width of fabric is 72” that is scrunched to a 4 inch comb.\n\nA style that is gaining popularity is a circle veil. This is one piece of tulle cut into a circle but the comb isn’t placed right in the middle. It is placed off center so it will give you the illusion of two pieces when it is towards the back but there is no bunching on the comb like on a two piece.\n\nOur fascination for fashion goes beyond the awards given for the evening. The Academy Awards is the mecca to see who is wearing who, what styles they think reflect their personalities and who is the most memorable. It’s a time to admire the craftsmanship artists put into their dresses and the thousands of hours poured into their works of art. This year saw a wide range from one shouldered dresses to capes to high slits.\n\nWe admire the creativity and attention to detail that our designers put into each dress in our store. We want our brides to feel like they can do anything and are so confident in the wedding dress they choose. It’s a reflection of who they are and want something that will stand the test of time when it comes to fashion.\n\nTake a look at some of the best dressed and Løv Bridal’s wedding dress answers. All of these wedding dresses are in store now to try on! We are thrilled to be able to carry such a diverse collection of wedding dresses from some of the world’s best designers.\n\nI have always loved wedding dresses. I still remember one of my many Barbie dolls from when I was about six. She had a short wedding dress, presumably to wear to her reception, but also came with a removable overskirt and detachable sleeves. I would spend hours creating different wedding scenes with her different outfits. Fast forward almost 30 years and I get to have life sized version of that in our boutique! We have removable overskirts and sleeves are so popular right now.\n\nOne of the things I am really proud of is the ability to customize our wedding dresses so much. Typically, a dress will come in one cut and then maybe come in 2-3 colors. This is because they are mass produced in factories and they don’t have the time or resources to customize. These companies want to get as many wedding dresses out as they can.\n\nHowever, we carefully selected designers who still have the heart for fashion, wedding dresses and the process. They have their own makers in house creating the dresses to their clients’ needs. I texted Stacey from La Curve and asked if she could put the lace top of one wedding dress with the flowy skirt of another wedding dress and add drapy sleeves, and she said yes! I emailed Mozey (Who has an 8 hour time difference in Tel Aviv) if he could line a skirt, close up the V in the front and extend the lining from side seam to side seam instead of a V shape. He replied to me in the middle of his night to say absolutely.\n\nWe are creating international relationships to create dream dresses for women. I still get to play dress up, except now I am helping women find the dress they will wear for one of the most memorable days of their lives."
