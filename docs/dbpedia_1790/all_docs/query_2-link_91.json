        "text": "This is one of the most commonly asked questions asked by brides seeking to complete their bridal ensemble. With today’s bridal gown designers adding a touch of color and using a variety of fine fabrics in a plethora of shades — white is no longer “white” and ivory is no longer “ivory. There are several ranges of golds and silver, pinks and blues, black and red and so forth. So, what’s a bride to do?\n\nPlatinum Wedding Dress by Demetrios; Pink Wedding Dress by Le Spose di Gio; Gold Wedding Dress by Demetrios; Veil Swatches by Distinctive Veils & Accessories\n\nIf a bride is fortunate enough to be in the beginning stages of her purchasing process — ask for a swatch of fabric from which your gown is made of from your gown designer, bridal store, or vendor if possible. If this is not possible be sure to obtain a photo of your gown in the tone you are wearing whether from the bridal shop or from your designer’s site. Since gown is the basis of your entire wedding ensemble, having this available will help you and any of the vendors choose to assist you in selecting the best bridal accessories to coordinate with your gown.\n\nOnce you have a swatch of your gown and/or picture of your gown, start shopping for your veil. One of the most common mistakes made by brides looking for a veil is waiting until the last minute. Most veils are made to order just for you. Some are ready-made and available but, if a bride desires any details such as added crystals or pearls, embroidered, or lace on their veils, allow sufficient time to choose, order, and receive your veil for your special day. Two to three months before your wear date gives you a good deal of breathing room. A good rule of thumb is to start looking for your veil shortly after purchasing your gown.\n\nDoes it Have to Match Perfectly?\n\nColors will vary from dye lot to dye lot, designer to designer, and manufacturer to manufacturer. Just because your dress designer calls their gown diamond white does not mean the veiling you order is the exact same tone. Unless you buy a wedding veil from the same designer as your wedding gown, it is not likely to be an exact match. For this reason, when shopping for a veil online or at a brick-and-mortar inquire as to whether they offer wedding veil swatches. Most do offer swatches at no charge or for a small fee that is applicable to your order if placed with them. This is highly recommended before purchasing a veil to ensure your veil will match your gown."
