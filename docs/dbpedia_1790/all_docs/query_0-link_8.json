For example\n\nDemographic Transition Model\n\nBurgess Model\n\nBid rent theory\n\nIt may be that this already exists and I just can't find it. In which case it needs to be more prominent. Nengscoz41620\n\nYes it's possible to have one. I looked, and don't think we have one. You could create an article or a list. Click on Geographic model or List of geographic models and start typing. You'll need to find a source that defines what a geographic model is, but that shouldn't be too difficult. Good luck. The Transhumanist\n\nCurrently the article is at Peirce F. Lewis, yet I've also seen Peirce K. Lewis on some of his articles. Does anyone know which is correct? -- John Reaves\n\nPeirce F. Lewis is correct. The Transhumanist (talk)\n\nHi. I have created a new article called Physiographic regions of the world. It is still obviously a Start-class article though. I have also created three new categories Category:Physiographic divisions, Category:Physiographic provinces, and Category:Physiographic sections. Any help on expanding these would be appreciated. Also, I don't where in the above 'lists' to place these. To me, it seems they could be in several different places, but I figured I'd let somebody else make that decision. Thanks. wbfergus Talk\n\nKind of as an addendum to this, I just went back through the articles that under the \"Physiographic divisions\" category and addedd the \"Geography navigation\" and \"Physical Geography Sub-disciplines\" templates to the main article's page, and also added this projects template to the talk pages. I'll next start on the provinces, then move on to the sections, though those will take a lot longer. wbfergus Talk\n\nSomething else I noticed as I was going through the above process is that there is a lack of consistency in the various articles I've gone through. Of course part of that is becuase of the article class (Stub, Start, etc.). But, I was wondering if it would make sense for the project to have some sort of consistent guidelines for these articles, so say for instance, for an article to get to \"A\" class for this project, the article 'should' include a (more-or-less) 'standardized' section, similar to the various sections in Physical geography#Fields of physical geography? It adds a consistent layout to the project's articles, and it also would seem silly to have an \"A\" class article that didn't at least address those topics somewhat (if it is possible). Also, the earlier in the process articles adopt such a layout, the easier it is to spot areas still needing work. Comments or other ideas? wbfergus Talk\n\ncategories of Surface features of celestial bodies has been nominated to rename from cat:X on Y to cat:X of Y. See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2007 December 9#Surface features of celestial bodies 132.205.99.122 (talk)\n\nIs this article within your scope? Taemyr (talk)\n\nI don't know much about how the templates work on here, so before I take a crack at it I figured I'd also mention it here in case anybody else does and add this enhancement.\n\nIt would be \"real nice\" if the tl:Geography topics template would accept the \"nested=yes\" syntax (or something similar), so that it's not automatically expanded. Or, is that capability already 'built-in' somehow? Thanks. wbfergus Talk\n\nOkay it's done. Here's a cut'n'paste from the template talk page:\n\nI just redesigned the template to use the navbox template. I think it looks 'almost' the same. I can't get the 'boxes' on the left (General, Lists, etc.) to have alternating colors, but I think it's comparable to what it was in the original template. This variation defaults so that the box is collapsed, so it is not so obnoxious on the pages where it resides, and therefore fewer people should object.\n\nAlso, this template can be forced into autocollapse (where it is collapsed if two or more boxes are on the same article), or plain (always explanded and the [hide] link on the right will not be displayed). This can be toggeled by specifying \"state=which_mode_you_want\" when calling the template, as in:\n\n{{Geography|class=Start|state=plain}}\n\nI hope this is acceptable. I can't figure out how to get the 'boxes' on the left to alternate colors, I think a change in the main navbox template is required for that. Otherwise, I think it looks 'almost' the same, but adds a bit more functionality. wbfergus Talk\n\nHi. I just acquired an undated map and did what I always do: determine the date by checking borders and names. In this case, it was made after the partition of Korea (ca. 1953) but before the independence of Gold Coast/Ghana (ca. 1957). I thought it would be useful to write up a list of such events in Wikipedia. Is there anything like this? Do you think it would be better to set it up as a category, including articles like Korean war alphabetized under 1953 or 1953.07 (July), as its own article, or both? What rubric? I'm not a Geography person, so I'm not sure if any of this has been addressed before. --Kenmayer (talk)\n\nPerhaps in the List_of_basic_geography_topics#Lists_of_manmade_geographical_features section under the rubric \"List of map-changing events by date\" to include both boundary changes and name changes (British Honduras-->Belize for example), perhaps with subcategories of \"Sovereign name-changing events by date\" and \"Boundary changing events by date.\" --Kenmayer (talk)\n\nFound it! It already exists at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Map_changes Now I have to delete the stub that I started. Dang. --Kenmayer (talk)\n\nDoes every geographical feature need to be added to this project (e.g. mountain ranges, etc.)? For example, I've noticed several articles relating to WikiProject Oregon being added to the Geography project. I'm thinking that the state projects should perhaps be made subprojects of this one as the state projects are most likely going to be able to provide better oversight of the articles in question. Adding WikiProject Geography to likely tens of thousands of articles seems counterproductive. Thoughts? Katr67 (talk)\n\nI also feel adding the generalized geography navboxes to specific articles, like Klamath Mountains isn't helpful and that these templates should only be used on the articles linked in them. The casual reader isn't necessarily going to want to look at geography articles in general when looking up a specific geographical place, and if s/he is interested in browsing geographical topics, s/he can easily access the geographic categories the page belongs to. I'm curious whether this tagging effort is sanctioned by this project? Katr67 (talk)\n\nTo keep everything in one place, it was agreed to copy discussions from our talk pages over here. I am doing that, but may still make a couple minor formatting changes so things appear in the proper order. That will be the only change, so some things may not appear to be in the proper context of this project. wbfergus Talk\n\nHi. May I ask why you removed the geography templates from the article? They (the Klamath Mountains) are clearly a geographic feature. The 'Geography navigation' template merely provides further guidance to othe geography related ::subjects, in case that is how the user navigated to the page. The 'Physical Geography Sub-disciplines' template will help to highlight additional areas in the article that need information of further expansion. Some of those 'sections' are already included in the article, but not all. Since the Klamath Mountains are also a distinct physiographicla section of the United States, to properly 'fill out' the article, those sections should be present, as much as possible, therefore especially the second template is even more important. Please reconsider the removal, or at least make a good case for why they shouldn't be included on the article. Thank you. wbfergus Talk\n\nI too feel that these templates are overbroad and should not be added to specific geographical features. Generally templates should only be added to articles that are linked from them. While I appreciate your effort to promote and improve geographical coverage in Wikipedia, overtemplating articles is not the way to do it. Katr67 (talk)\n\nHi again. Thanks for the quick reply. I am not adding them to every geographic feature, only those specific geographic features on Physiographic regions of the world. All of these articles are of a higher 'importance' than say Mt. Hood, as they used in various studies very similar to ecoregions. As such, they eventually should have sections within the articles to cover all of the various physiographic (Physical Geography) subjects. I have made the more general 'Geography navigation' template collapsible, so that it takes up less room on the screen and is more unobstrusive. I also just sa your other post on the Geography project. Should these 'discussions' be perhaps moved over there, or is this forum adequate to discuss this? Thanks again. wbfergus Talk\n\nI share this concern. I don't know the precise policy on navboxes, but I think these boxes, which may be excellent additions to the right articles, are out of place on specific mountain range pages like Klamath Mountains and Oregon Coast Range. -Pete (talk)\n\nI think it's better to have the discussion over there, since I'm not the only one who has questioned this. Katr67 (talk)\n\nWbfergus, I replied on my talk page--re: let's move this discussion to the project page. Thanks! Katr67 (talk)\n\nThat's what I was thinking as well. It would save an awful lot of retyping and keep everything in one place. I will go ahead and copy unless you have already started to. I will wait a few minutes to see, so we don't get an 'Edit conflict' (I hate those!). Thanks again. wbfergus Talk\n\nCopy away. I have some other stuff I should be doing right now... Katr67 (talk)\n\nOkay, the copy is out of the way, so now to try address the concerns and my reasoning (which may be flawed). All of the pages I have added the two templates on have been specific geographic feature that have been identified distinct physiographic 'areas', per this fairly new article I'm working on, Physiographic regions of the world. I am not adding the templates to very specific articles, such as a Mt. Hood or anything. These physiographic 'areas' are very similar to ecoregions, in that they have specific contexts and applications, other than merely describing a nice place to camp for the weekend. My agency has a specific database that uses this information, but some (many) of the definitions are incomplete. It was my intention that by creating the artcile with the list, I could link to the specific 'areas' articles, and make it more well known that these 'types' of area definitions exist, and eventually other editors could help contribute further information from reliable and verifiable sources, not only for our own database's use, for for other countries/aganies as well.\n\nWith that basic preamble out of the way, it would 'be nice' if all of those articles had fully fleshed out sections (as much as possible anyway), as that would further describe the area in it's entire physiographic context. If/when this is done, it is far more difficult trying to find those article and ensuring they have the 'Physical Geography Sub-disciplines' template, than it is to just go through all at once and add them. If they do have all of the sections to fully describe the physiography, then they clearly should have at least that template.\n\nAs far as the more general 'Geography navigation' template, I felt it wouldn't hurt any article to have it (especially the myraid of stubs I've run across), but I also modified the template so that it is collapsed by default and therefore more unobstrusive to the casual reader. I felt it could very well add to the occasional users reading, as they may very well have navigated to that article from a geography related page, instead of just of a search for that specific article. They also may see a term or concept on the page and could have a quick way to see related subjects for further information. I beleive that is what the template was designed for, though I could be wrong. As it is, the template only takes about two lines of screen room, so it doesn't 'cluuter up' the screen if someone is not interested in it. Let the arrow flinging begin. wbfergus Talk\n\nFurther comment. I ran across a similar objection from another user a few days ago, Darwinek who mainly objected because the 'Geography navigation' box was not collapsable and took a large amount of screen space, which is why I redesigned it so that it was collapsed by default. After this change, he withdrew his objections to their presence and re-added the templates to the pages he had removed them from. We both reached a mutual agreement and saw the merits to both sides. I have no problems with trying to work out any other mutaul agreements, or even just being slapped around if I'm way out of line. I think though that at least the 'Physical Geography Sub-disciplines' template should stay, as all of the articles I've added that to 'should' have those sections populated. A few articles actually seem to do already (much to my surprise), but having the template available helps to highlight other areas of the article that may be missing or incomplete. wbfergus Talk\n\nOK, whatever your argument is, you lost me at: \"My agency has a specific database that uses this information...\" Excuse me, but what agency? This now stinks of some sort of conflict of interest and/or point of view pushing. Aboutmovies (talk)\n\nOkay. I don't really feel it's pertinent, but I work for USGS. We have a mineral database that contains information on mineral/mining 'sites' (occurences, mines, refactories, smelters, etc.) world-wide. At one point in time, it was suggested to also add in the physiographic areas, so future studies and analysis could be done to see if one sort might be more conducive that other types of areas. In the US, these areas have been pretty well defined since at least the 1920s, if not even earlier For the rest of the world, it's pretty hit and miss on how well they've been defined, hence my desire to get other Wikipedians to 1.) know about this particular field (even though it's been around for quite some time), and 2.) hope that other Wikipedians can help supply additional information to help further define the different characteristics of this field to the different physiographic 'areas'. Please see Physical geography for additional information on exactly what fields are in this 'subject'. As you can see, most, if not all of these 'subjects' would be a benefit to all of these various articles if covered (as far as possible anyway). Many of these articles already exist on Wikipedia, and have been defined many years ago by people outside of USGS as distinct physiographic 'areas'. Therefore, these articles do fully warrant the 'Physical Geography Sub-disciplines' template, as they clearly have been defined as such by numerous others. So, as I said, I really don't see any conflict of interest or POV. This is a well-defined field consisting of many different sub-disciplines, as even a cursory search would reveal. I'm merely asking for other Wikipedians to help define (or fill out) information for the various subjects this field encompasses. It will definately help the article, it will probably help us with our database, and the additional information will probably help other Wikipedians know that 'area' better than the current article. The main article I created, and probably will be working on for quite a while, Physiographic regions of the world is the only comprehensive list of this information from all sources that I have been able to find, which is another reason that I decided to create the article, so finding this was much easier. Now there may be some errors, omissions, etc. in the table, but that's yet another reason for a Wikipedia article. Others can find additional sources to further correct the table and data. So basically to me, the whole issue is whether it's disrupting to use about two lines of screen space per article for these two templates. I don't think it is, especially when most 'state' templates take around 4 or more lines per template. These two are some of the most unobtrsuive there are, and whatever points can be made about state templates can just as easily be made about these two, and vice versa. The information can be easily wiki-linked in the article, etc. easily applies both ways. Either keep these two templates (though I can possibly see a small point about the 'Geography navigation'), or remove all templates, the same arguments apply to them all. Look at the various geographic features that extend across multiple states or countries, and each state wants to have their own template on it, at around 4 lines per state template. For a perfect example, see Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Which is more annoying, the state templates or the two I added at the top of the templates (bottom of page)? This has gotten so long I probably forgot a 'subject' or two, but if I did, please feel free to ask further about it. Thanks, I'm glad for the discussions on this subject. wbfergus Talk\n\nWow, I'm embarrased by all of my typos I see above (sheepish grin). Anyway, I also wanted to state that the talk pages of the articles that are physiographic 'areas' (divisions, provinces or sections), I have also been add the 'Wikiproject Geography' template, which I 'think' the subject line refers to, but I wanted to further clarify this issue in case it came up. It would be beneficial if other members would participate in this discussion. I am holding off on further edits to give other a chance to weigh in, but I also don't think I should be left waiting more than a day or two. Thanks. wbfergus Talk\n\n(outdent)Looking at the Project page itself, where the templates are listed, the column labeled \"What it's for\" clearly states that the 'Geography navigation' template is for \"The geography Navigation has been designed to be placed at the bottom of articles relating to geography to provide an easy link to important articles.\" and the 'Physical geography sub disciplines' tag states \"The physical geography sub-discipline tag has been designed to be placed at the bottom of articles relating to physical geography to provide an easy link to important articles\". So, by the first definition, I have been placing them (the templates) on articles that clearly relate to geography for the purpose of allowing navigation back to important geography subjects. By the second definition, these are clearly physical geography articles by definitions at least around 80 years old, if not far older, used by many different professions and professionals.\n\nFurthermore, I have already added these templates to probably a little over 200 different articles so far. This is only the second time the templates were 'questioned'. The first time, the user actually had a good argument, because the template was non-collapsible and did take up a lot of screen space. I subsequently modified the template so it defaulted to collapsed, the user withdrew their objection, and self-reverted the articles he had removed them from (around 20 or so). Most of the other articles have had numerous edits, vandalism, reverts, etc. performed on them since I added the templates, and they haven't been questioned. There are to many diffs (around 200 articles, with usually several or more edits apiece) to even begin to list here, so if anyone doubts this claim, all I can do is to offer you to go to Physiographic regions of the world, click an article, and then check the history.\n\nSo, lacking any opposistion other than it doesn't look good or whatever (something not based upon policy, guidelines or anything else 'concrete'), I will continue my editing of the remaining 50 or so articles and re-add them to the (I think) 4 articles from which they removed, which also started this discussion. wbfergus Talk\n\nFYI, these discussions usually do not end after a couple days, people have regular lives and do not always respond immediately. My question is this, did the USGS ask you to do this? I ask because that is where the COI would come in, and that was what I took from the \"my agency\" bit above. Outside of this, I too would object to the placement of the templates on articles outside of those listed on the templates. Please note that whatever instructions you are referring to were likely written by the template author, and like most of those instructions there was little or no input from anyone else. I include general instructions whenever I make a nav template so that whenever someone new comes along they might know what it is used for, but these have no actual authority to them (FYI the geography template needs to be fixed, there is a DAB issue). The problem with adding the nav templates to all these lower level articles is it looks like link spam. If an article needs a link within it to one of these, it should be linked from within the body of the article (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)) to provide context for the reader. Since that should cover what you seem to be adding the templates for, the only other legitimate use of the template would seem to be an attempt to provide navigation. Nav templates normally are only added to articles that are listed in the template, and in some cases closely related articles. In this case I'm guessing the templates were designed for that type of use, with the closely related being other geography related articles such as Geodesy for the sub-fields template, and not specific physical named features (i.e. mountain ranges, not the Rocky Mountains). Would you place these templates on notable geologists? Doubtful, and I'm sure the editors who watch those pages would object.\n\nFor me, I think it would be fine to place the \"sub fields\" template in the articles listed at the \"division\" level in your Physiographic regions of the world article, but nothing lower. Then maybe make a template for each division to be used to navigate between articles with that division. But anything more expansive becomes too broad and tertiary. Aboutmovies (talk)\n\nHi and thanks for commenting! I thought I stated above (maybe poorly), that I took the initiative to create the article. I was not asked to do it. As I was building my 'list' around 6 or 7 years ago (maybe even longer), I had to go to numerous sources to compile this list. I still can't find just one single place where this 'list' of physiographic 'areas' exist for the entire world, which is one of the reasons I decided to create the article, to help others trying to do the same thing. I think I explained my other reasoning above, about hoping other Wikipedians could help contribute to that article, and also to the various articles it links. If I wasn't very articulate about it, then please ask for further clarification.\n\nI wouldn't add either of the templates on specific Geologist's page. It clearly wouldn't be appropriate there. However, these are clearly geography articles, so the usage (addition) of the 'Geography navigation' template 'seems' warranted, per not only the 'instructions', but just normal categorization. However, I can also see your point, though I also will admit that to me, it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. Maybe a project 're-definition' of where and when they are appropriate would be needed?\n\nRegarding the second template, I personally feel that each article linked from the Physiographic regions of the world article should have it. They are both directly related. The articles themselves wouldn't even be tagged as such if the weren't physiographic 'areas', and each of those articles would improve in their content 'coverage' if each of the various sub disciplines of physical geography had it's own sub-section under the 'Geography' section. Having that template available on each of those articles helps to highlight what additional coverage could improve the article, unless those who are watching the article don't really care much about giving the article a full and nuetral coverage of all related information for that 'area'. It seems to me that they would, as it (the additional information) helps highlight the various reasons that 'area' is so distinct, special, and notable. It also helps to highlight (especially to those that don't know), that a myriad of other disciplines have or probably will be, studying that 'area' to further their knowledge. All of the articles where I added the second template are closely related to physical geography, they wouldn't have the same 'importance' without that particular field. I don't think it is worth it to have 300-400 different nav templates to tie each division to each province and then each of the constitient sections. That can clearly (and easily) be done within the article, in the process of creating a full-fledged 'Geography' section with the applicable physiographic topics/disciplines underneath as 'sub-sections' to 'Geography'.\n\nRegarding my last statement about continuing, I mainly made that after seeing that one of the editors above, without any further discussion here, even after being given a link to this page to participate, and asked politely to participate, has gone ahead and removed the templates from at least one other article. Evidently they feel participation doesn't matter, though I think it's fairly obvious I'm willing to participate. I have a life as well, and if the individual takes the time to question something and still has the time to continue editing, participation should be a given. Why question something if you don't or can't participate, listening to answers and maybe asking additional questions. If they have the time to edit, they have the time to participate. I should be accorded the same courtesy as well. wbfergus Talk\n\nHello All,\n\nI've just been reading the discussion above and quite a few good issues have been raised as to whether the geography and physical geography navigation templates ought to be used in specific articles or remain as navigation to the articles listed on them. I can see both sides of the argument that the physiographic areas are indeed related to physical geography and the placing of the template highlights this, however I can also the counter arguments point that wikipedia has a tree like structure and that navigation through the categories at the bottom of the page are enough for the reader.\n\nAs such I've tried to come up with a solution that should appease both sides. The below template is a draft template of all the physiographic regions etc. It has a link at the bottom to the physical geography page and also categorises each article to the physical geography category and also the physiographic divisions category (this can be changed, such as if a physiography category is created allowing all regions, divisions etc to be put into one category with the sub-sections then branching of i.e. as an umbrella category listing everything while the other categories remain and list the regions etc more specifically). As such allowing the reader to see that it is related to physical geography and categorised as such whilst also leaving the physical geography template to be used as a direct navigation bar.\n\nThe below is only a first draft, and any changes are more than welcome. The general gist is that each region has a row followed by division and then provinces as the small text (e.g.Africa ->African Alpine System -> Atlas Mountain). I've stopped after Africa as this is only a suggestion and if taken on-board the rest can be added. AlexD (talk)\n\np.s. Forgot to mention, wbfergus raised a good point on my talk page about the use of the term physiography as a synonym for physical geography and as such a section could be added to the physical geography article explaining how the use of the term has changed from a synonym to being mainly concerned with landforms and topography, thereby making the link on the bottom of the template more useful. AlexD (talk)\n\nFrom first impressions, it looks pretty darn good. I'll take a little more detailed look at it, and think it over a bit, but I don't have any objections to it. Thanks Alex! wbfergus Talk\n\nAfter a bit of thinking, here's what my 'opinion of the hour' is. At first, I was thinking that the 'sections' should be included also. But, further reflection made me relaize not only how 'busy' it would make the box, but also the difficulties inherrent in trying to implement it. I thought about maybe sub-nav boxes included within the larger box, but I don't know if that's possible and it would probably look really wierd also. I then thought about maybe different deliniation, like Pacific Mountain System (Pacific Border province ((Olympic Mountains, Oregon Coast Range, etc.), Cascade-Sierra Mountains ((Northern Cascade Mountains, Middle Cascade Mountains, etc.)), etc.), but that really doesn't look very good either. So, as it is, it appears a pretty equitable solution. The box can still be included on the 'physiographic section' articles, as it would still aid navigation to the higher level province, or other physiographic 'areas'. As I stated previously (kind of anyway), the only problem would be with navigation between the different physiographic 'sections'. That's really not to to bad of an issue though, it just requires the user to make a few extra mouse-clicks and maybe look a bit more to decide how to get there. The major points (subjects/articles) are still easily accessible though.\n\nOn a side issue, I see from the project page that you seem to have a far better grasp and knowledge of the subject than I do. Can you find and provide a ref or two to further clarify the 'physiography' 'physical geography' distinctions and/or similarities? As I said on your talk page, like you, I originally thought physiography was primarily about landmasses and geomorphology, but another user said that physiography was actually just a contraction of 'physical' and 'geography' and included all of the various subdisciplines, so I'm confused on that point, as I'm sure many other Wikipedians would be as well. Also, I see in your new navbox that you include Antarica with two subdivisions. I don't have those in the main article (or list), but to include them, I should probably have a reference that they are defined as such, and the articles don't seem to have any that say that. Could you point me to some source so that I could include them please? Thanks, and it looks like a great job. wbfergus Talk\n\nApologies for the wait wbfergus, I am in the middle of doing a pollen count, where there seems to be a lack of pollen and therefore results in me not being able to reply quickly. Anyway, the sources you asked for:\n\nLeighly, J. (1955), What has happened to physical geography?, The Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 45, No 4, pp309-318 (Equates physiography with geomorphology)\n\nDavis, WM. (1903), A Scheme for Geography, The Geographical Journal, Vol22, No 4, pp413-423\n\nAlthough these are rather old articles, if I remember correctly the term changed from being synonymous with phys. geo. due to Davis as he used it only for geomorphology and thereafter it became the general definition.\n\nFor Anarctica:\n\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/261/5117/45\n\nhttp://pangea.stanford.edu/research/crustal/abst.txt\n\nIf the template is to be used, would you be so kind as to finish of the similar parts that are in parentheses in the Africa section for the remaining areas? Thanks AlexD (talk)\n\narbitrary break\n\nI’m more OK with the new template, that is far more closely tied to individual regions. But again I reiterate that nav templates normally allow for navigation between related articles in that the article a template is on is included within the template. Otherwise it comes across as advertising/promotion for the other articles, and that is not what templates are for. A few other points, readers of an article on Death Valley are likely not interested in topics like the Saudi Geographical Society listed in the “Geography” template. Additionally, most of the topics in the “sub fields” template are covered in the general template, so these are redundant and should not be on the same article. Next, as to you saying you would not place the original templates on individual geographers and articles like Mt. Hood, why not? They fit your inclusion criteria. That in itself means the criteria is rather arbitrary, and on Wikipedia we try to avoid arbitrary decisions/criteria (see WP:NOTE and WP:OVERCAT for examples). Honestly, as a general interest editor and reader who edits lots of bios, some geography related topics, some government related, and many history articles I think I am a good example of the average reader. As such, when I go to one of these articles I do not see myself as reading them to learn more about geology/geography, but to read about a specific physical feature in a specific place. That is on an article about the Rocky Mountains I’m going to want to know what formed them, when, how long they are, the average height, maximum height, and area covered. That’s about it. You as a geo-person would likely delve further into the subject, and that’s where those templates come in, and I think that’s why you want to include them, as a professional in the subject. It’s similar with the law people, they want to add their “law” template to many articles, but even as a member of the WikiProject I do not add the template to every law related article as the topics (though within law) are too far removed from the article. Constitutional law and a variety of other legal topics do have a bearing on Oregon Ballot Measure 5 (1990), but these legal topics are too far removed from the ballot measure. A nav template for people generated laws or ballot measures or property tax reform would be appropriate, but a general law template is not. And that goes for these templates as well. As to 300-400 sub templates, many of these already exist. I know there are several for the Cascade Range, and I made one for the Oregon Coast Range that “uplinks” to the Pacific Coast Ranges that it is a sub region off. Hopefully that all makes sense. Aboutmovies (talk)\n\nThanks for your comments. I can see your point of view now (and not with the bias usually assiociated with a statement about POV). Let me clarify a point though before I progress. I am not a geologist or geographer or anything like that. About the extent of my active interest in geology is the occasional gold panning trip with my son, and about the extent of my interest in geography is the physiographic 'stuff', as it's a weak area in our database. I'm primarily (actually almost entirely), a 'database guy'. Almost all I know about rocks is they usually hurt when I'm hit in the head with one. I agree with your statement about the various countries Geological Societies, and is a good point about the first template. I'm not totally convinced about it's inclusion myself, but it did seem like a good fit. For Mt. Hood, on certain days, I would probably be tempted to add it to the article though, while I other days I probably wouldn't. It to is clearly an article about a geographic feature, and much more pertinent than an article about a geographer. Many times I would also be sorely tempted to add it to articles about practically any natural geographic feature (man made ones like cities, towns, dams, etc. don't really seem as appropriate, even if they are geographic features as well).\n\nI wouldn't add the second template to an article about Mt. Hood (or similar 'features') because it clearly doesn't belong. When talking about a 'larger' feature though, such a mountain range that has been defined as a physiographic area in its own right, and with it's own significance, then it's a slightly different context then though. It seems that since it is (and has been for many, many years) defined as a physiographic feature, that the article itself (at least the fairly complete, good ones) would also have sub-sections within the article addressing the different subject areas of physical geography. It provides much more information about the area to the casual reader, especially since most readers have probably never heard of physiography (I never did until about 8 years ago). Those additional sub-sections would help the casual reader understand the various 'things' that help make that area distinct and 'special', and isn't that the purpose of having the article here really is? Somebody created the article because they thought it was important in some regard. Other editors come along and add further information, and somehwere along the line an editor or two comes along that has a POV about it, because they live close, camp there a lot, live there, whatever, and more or less assumes a personal interest in the article, wanting it to be 'better'. Doesn't knowing those additional subjects make the article better? Conversely, can't there many cases where somebody coming sees the article, and goes \"Wow. I didn't know that. I wonder what other information is available?\", or maybe even wonders \"Why is this subject here?\". Now, a navigation box would be useful for those readers, though it could also be handled by wikilinks in the article as well. But, to use a wikilink, the user has two options. Follow it right away to further investigate the 'subject', and then (usually) return back to the article, or read the entire article to the bottom, then scroll back up to try and find the link. This is where the navboxes are beneficial.\n\nBut, with all that out of the way, and after Alex's comments and navbox above, I'm not as adamant about the second template now. I still clearly think that it's highly pertinent to those articles, and I think those articles themselves should be much more concerned about useful and pertinent content than on how pretty the article looks, and that really seems to be the only objection to the second template, the 'appearance'. Not whether or not the 'Climatology' link in the navbox is appropriate, especially if a complete article has a sub-section on 'Climatology'.\n\nNext, also in light of Alex's comments and after a trip to the library, I am still just as confused as I was 8 years ago. Is physical geography the same as 'physiography', or are they two completely different fields of study. I found as many references saying one did for the other, in both new and old books. There doesn't seem to any clear or definate answer, so especially with Alex' excellent alternative, I would be willing to let a few US articles with some editors with a personal interest in the article, go ahead and skip the second template so it looks prettier. Those articles will thereafter look pretty, but wil be slightly inconsistent with the rest of the US and the world for those that fall in the 'physiographic' field of study, but I guess that's the editors choice in light of Alex's alternative.\n\nSo, since you have at least given me the courtesy of discussion, without even having asked for discussion, I can readily abide by our discussion and allow the removal of the two templates from those articles. I will however add in Alex's template once it is finished, as it is more pertinent and specialized, and therefore more applicable to the articles. Is that acceptable?\n\nFinally, let me thank you again for participating in the discussion, instead of asking for a discussion, then ignoring the discussion while you continued to edit and remove material that was the subject of discussion, like others have. You weren't originally involved, but at least you utilized common courtesy. Thank you for that.\n\nAlex, is there anything I can do to help? wbfergus Talk\n\nTwo quick points. It is not the appearance of the article (prettiness), Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context, and in this case I think many of the links are not relevant enough to the topic, and thus leads to overlinking. Both of these are WP:MOS items, thus not only do articles need to abide by them in general, but when try to get articles through GA and FA they must comply with these guidelines. Templates at the bottom of articles are unintrusive and have little to do with the look, but they must be closely related to the topic, which is why I am far more inclined to have the new template on an article such as Oregon Coast Range, as these are similar topics. Topics like those related to glaciers have no business on that range as glaciers were not a major shaper of the range, and if they had it would be mentioned and linked. The relevant items to geography (physical and political) should already be linked in the body. And secondly, try to assume good faith with why others have not discussed more here. Note that even with their reversions the articles are back at the same point as they were before you edited them. The articles would either be your preference or theirs, it could not be both, and from my own experience I will often revert back to the previous version while a \"controversial\" edit is discussed, since the prior version was implicitly OK. Aboutmovies (talk)\n\nHmm. I hope you weren't referring to me above. (Though I asked for the discussion, I don't believe I have continued to remove templates, so if you have diffs to show that, and I am wrong, I apologize). Your posts here are quite long and I haven't had time to give them the proper consideration so I could formulate a thoughtful reply. Also, I've been busy. Besides which, I've pretty much stated my case already (that the templates add clutter, are only tangentially related to the subject at hand, are overbroad in relation to the articles to which they were added, and are not useful to the casual encyclopedia reader). For my part, that is the end of the discussion, and you either agree or you don't. I won't revert if you decide to replace the templates. Do what you will, my goal was simply to open this up to a wider discussion, which has been accomplished. Though if this were a !vote, I would register my Oppose to the use of the templates on specific mountain ranges and the like. Katr67 (talk)\n\nNo Katr67, I wasn't referring to you. I try (though quite often fail) to be semi-diplomatic and not specifically name any individuals or other such non-tactful actions. I duly note your position and your continued lack of support for the templates, more or less, within the Oregon area. It appears though, that from any opposition in the other 200 or so articles on which I've already added them, the folks that watch those pages don't share your concern. Quite a few of those pages have been edited several times or more since I added the templates, in many cases even reverted back to my last change. So, I will respect your position as well and not add them back. However, do you have any objection to the new template that Alex has proposed above? I see that as a fair compromise, besides being more specialized.\n\nRegarding my frustration, I just felt that I was being unduly subjected to a request to wait, which I did in all good faith, so that further discussion could continue before any further edits either way were performed. After discussion, then additional edits could be made, but only after the discussion. That is only common courtesy and respect that should be accorded to all editors, regardless of 'most' circumstances (vandalism obviously one of those). When I abide by it, and then see another party not only make additional reverts without any more discussion, and then continue to edit other things (related or not) without any further discussion, then I (and most editors) would tend to get a bit frustrated. As several long-time editors on some policy pages are currently saying, silence equates to approval, or at least lack of objections. If I wasn't acting in good faith, I could have easily interpreted the silence as the other editors had read my further discussion/explanation here, and saw my point, and had no further objections, especially with other editing activity going on. It was simply a matter of common courtesy and respect, not an assumption of bad faith. wbfergus Talk\n\nI honestly no longer have an opinion. Like I said, do what you want. Katr67 (talk)"
