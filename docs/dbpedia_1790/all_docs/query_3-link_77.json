        "text": "Have A Blessed Beach Wedding In Florida\n\nDoes a wedding ceremony have to be religious? Not at all, but you can incorporate some blessings into your special day that can be meaningful for you and your family. If you choose a beachfront wedding in Florida, along with one of our beach wedding packages, you can definitely experience a piece of paradise that you all remember forever while incorporating those traditional elements. Even if you elope in Florida, these special blessings can be part of your simple beach wedding.\n\nCeremony Options\n\nOur officiant will always be delighted to officiate your wedding ceremony, as well as coordinate the proceedings so you know when to walk down the aisle, etc. Religious-toned or non-religious can be accommodated. If you have a minister that you wish to preside over your vows, just let us know. Your vows are so special and should be the way you both want them to be. Maybe you want to write your own vows, or use one of ours with a touch of customization. Anything goes for your special day on a Florida beach.\n\nBlessings\n\nA Unity Sand Ceremony by definition is a tradition in which a couple getting married pours sand from separate containers into one central one. It represents the two people uniting together in marriage. Children love it because they get to pick the color they love and blend it into the vase with the rest of the family. Historically, this type of ceremony was performed in a church, but on the beach its too windy for candles and the sand is much more meaningful. Many brides coordinate the sand color with their beach wedding theme colors. Usually your minister or officiant will say a few words that resonate with the two of you as you pour your beautifully colored sand together into the unity container.\n\n“As these separate containers of sand are poured into the common container, the individual containers of sand will no longer exist, but will be joined together as one. Just as these sands can never be separated, and poured into their individual containers, again, so will your marriage, and family, be.”\n\nTie the Knot on Your Favorite Beach\n\nGulf Beach Weddings\n\nSiesta Key. It embodies everything you’ve dreamed of for a destination wedding. White sand, turquoise water as far as the eye can see. Your wedding guests will not be able to say, “no” to a wedding on Siesta Key Beach or its quieter cousin: Lido Beach. Plus the sunsets are hard to beat and make incredible wedding photos.\n\nWeddings in Clearwater, Florida seem to be more popular than ever. It’s because there’s just so much to do and the beach is beautiful. You and your guests may see dolphins, manatee and pelicans during your ceremony. Afterward, have your first toast as a married couple as the sun sets over the Gulf of Mexico. What could be better?\n\nEast Coast Beach Weddings\n\nWhen it comes to having a beach wedding in the sun and sea, choosing a location on the east coast of Florida will tick all the boxes. Why? It’s simple…the Atlantic ocean! Nothing beats the cooling sea breeze on a summer day or the sound of ocean waves as you say your vows. Up and down the Florida Atlantic coast you will find a wide variety of beach and sand types, depending on what activities you want to do after your beach wedding. Our couples choose St. Augustine as one of their favorite beach wedding locations because of the historic and romantic atmosphere. Daytona Beach is perfect for biking and walking with its firm sand, Cocoa Beach for surfing and Boynton Beach or Fort Lauderdale for shopping and beautiful blue green ocean views.\n\nPackage Decorations\n\nDesigning your wedding is so important and contributes to the type of experience you and your guests desire. A beach wedding will be much easier with the purchase of a complete package that comes with unique decorations for a tasteful and lovely ceremony. This is where it’s helpful to talk to a beach wedding specialist who can guide you in choosing the best theme for your destination wedding. You might think you want a tropical theme, but after browsing our all inclusive packages and talking to others, you may end up with rustic wedding…both are beautiful!\n\nAfter The Wedding\n\nWhen it comes to your special day, you will want to consider activities after the wedding ceremony. Many couples getting married on the beach just want to have a relaxing dinner with family and friends. Again, our beach wedding specialist will help advise you. We provide our brides with a list of quality options for dining and entertainment near your beach wedding venue. It might even be at your hotel.\n\nBest Beach Wedding Company\n\nDealing with an experienced beach wedding company and their wedding specialist will just ensure your day is perfect.

Right now that means a more simple wedding, usually outdoors. The perfect place? Siesta Key beach embodies romance and is ideal for a destination wedding that is affordable. Let’s explore how to make your beach wedding ideas a reality with this type of simple beach wedding.\n\nSave Money\n\nA weekday wedding is often the best way to save money on any wedding expenses and that goes for Florida destination weddings too. Although it can be difficult for some wedding guests to attend due to working schedules, consider a weekday wedding in Siesta Key Beach for an elopement or vow renewal. Save a few bucks and experience a less busy beach: we all know the beach is more crowded on the weekends.\n\nFlorida Wedding Packages\n\nAll-inclusive destination weddings are really the easiest way to go and the most budget-friendly, and you can do it all online from your home. Even with photography opted in, most beach wedding packages are less than $3,000! So what Florida wedding package do you choose? It depends on many things:\n\nyour guest count\n\nyour budget\n\nyour level of desired decorations\n\nyour options for first dance, toast as a married couple, wedding photography\n\nyour location and permits – in this case Siesta Key Beach or Lido Key Beach.\n\nThe best wedding package for under 10 guests:\n\nOur Beach Beginnings Package is elegant and one of our couples’ favorites! Up to 10 people and chairs for your guests to witness your vows between two bamboo poles, along with shells and white/ivory flowers. Want tropical? You can have those flowers if you choose.

And depending on your starting and ending point, your most affordable option can vary.\n\nLand: Calculate gas/mileage for a Florida road trip and travel time to your beach wedding location.\n\nAir: Check travel sites like Orbitz or Travelocity to see flight costs. Don’t forget to consider additional fees like baggage (your wedding dress), seat selection, cost to park at the airport. Sometimes choosing a slightly higher “upfront” ticket can be cheaper in the long run by including free bags or seat assignment. Also check out Trip Advisor’s handy tool for some Sarasota, Florida Flight Stats.\n\nNicer Than You Can Imagine\n\nTime of Year: Spring break is a hot season for travelers to Florida and hotel prices often reflect those demands. You can often get late August/September discounts as long as you can handle the heat. Otherwise, Fall is a great time to plan a Florida beach wedding. Less heat, less travelers, and traditionally cheaper rates. Also, avoid price hikes during holiday weekends. If you are a northerner looking to take a break from the brutal winter, Florida’s mild winter weather may be the perfect reason to ditch the snow shovel and get some Florida sunshine on Siesta Key or Lido Key beach.\n\nLess Stress Than Traditional Weddings\n\nA small wedding of your dreams can be easy and beautiful at the same time.

For us, as beach wedding planners, part of the thrill is seeing each bridal gown as the ceremony begins. Each bride has different taste so it’s a real treat for us to participate and photograph the wedding dresses. You might think we’d see mostly short wedding dresses, but most of the time our Florida beach brides choose full length gowns and they look incredible! The secret is in the material and style they choose to keep them comfortable on these Gulf beaches. And shoes…who needs them? If you begin your beach ceremony with shoes, we are almost certain they will be off by the time we get to the photography session! That warm Gulf of Mexico water is too hard to resist, and with a St. Pete Beach wedding the sunsets will leave you both breathless.\n\nBecause the internet is so crowded with wedding dresses, we thought we’d share with you some ACTUAL dresses that our brides chose. Don’t become a slave to social media dresses either; you are an individual and what you love matters most. Just keep in mind a few tips we can give you as experienced Gulf Beach wedding planners. In over 13 years in business we’ve seen it all and know what works in this unique Florida wedding environment an you might be surprised. Here we go…\n\nSpaghetti Strap Gowns\n\nKaty wore a lace bodice gown with spaghetti straps for her Gulf Beach wedding. You can see how gorgeous it is from the back too as it flows in the sea breeze. This type of wedding dress is perfect for humid or very warm weather that Florida experiences on the west coast. Classic and cool is the name of the game in Clearwater St. Pete, and this bride made it look so easy. Even her hair was beachy with just a small beaded accessory to show off her sun kissed face.\n\nLace Wedding Dress\n\nAn outdoor wedding is a beautiful thing, especially on a Florida beach. With heat, humidity and breezy conditions on St. Pete Beach, a shorter dress can be a really smart choice. This bride chose a tea length gown with a vintage feel in lace which was perfect for her simple beach wedding. The strapless, sweetheart neckline however, gives it a modern update as well as the little jacket. Let’s give this bride props for wearing heels on the beach!\n\nMermaid Wedding Dress\n\nWho can deny a mermaid gown isn’t beachy and seaside ready? By its very nature, the mermaid wedding dress is sweet and very romantic. Without a long train, it makes an impression while being easy to wear at one of our beach wedding places in Florida. Add lace to the mix and how can a beach bride go wrong!\n\nWedding Gown Trains and Veils\n\nWe are often delighted to see our brides wearing formal wedding gowns and it is always beautiful! In Clearwater St. Pete Beach, the sea breeze is often just right so a train will move in the breeze which is perfect for wedding pictures. Veils are a little more tricky, but still popular on the Gulf beaches. There is less wind on the west coast of Florida so brides can choose a veil. It is all a personal choice and just about anything goes when you have a Florida beach wedding. Even if you have a very small beach wedding or beach elopement, you can still arrive and get tie the knot in style. Even for vow renewals, we have seen couples decked out in full wedding.\n\nSo find out how you can get married in style with a Florida destination wedding package all-inclusive. Check out our Clearwater elopement packages and learn how to have a beach wedding in Florida to remember. We even help with your Florida marriage license and permits too. Contact our wedding planners today.\n\nTips for Clearwater Beach Wedding Planning\n\nYou’re big day is approaching on Clearwater Beach. And you’ve got the wedding planning ideas rolling like the waves! But before you end up drowning in the ocean of wedding planning, be sure to avoid these common mistakes. It’s easy to get caught up in your dream of getting married on the Gulf beach in the sun and white sand, but we have some professional advice to make your day a complete success.\n\nWedding Planning Mistakes To Avoid\n\n1. Poor Budgeting\n\nFrom underestimating to overspending, don’t fall into the dreaded wedding money pit. Before you really get into any planning, know your budget. What’s your top dollar and what does your wedding week look like? If it is a destination wedding in Clearwater Beach, then you here are some budget items to consider:\n\nwedding set up or planner\n\nbride and groom attire, your wedding dress, flowers\n\nhair and make up professionals\n\nhotel accommodations for you and planning for any wedding guests\n\ntravel expenses (airfare, baggage, airport commute or car/gas)\n\nfood before and after the wedding including a reception if desired\n\nextra activities while on your honeymoon or pre-wedding\n\nFlorida marriage license\n\n2. Over-planning\n\nType “A” brides listen especially closely: there is such a thing as over-planning. Trying to plan out every minute is going to drive you to the “crazy bride ward.” That’s why choosing one of our Clearwater beach wedding packages really makes sense. Let Florida Beach Weddings do all the wedding planning for you so you have more time to focus on fun things. Things like which beachfront restaurant in Clearwater you’ll hit up after your Gulf beach wedding. Or what color is perfect for your bridesmaids’ dresses? And over-planning beach weddings only leads to our next mistake…\n\n3. Stressing Out\n\nThere is certainly a healthy level of anxiety that comes with committing yourself to another human for the rest of your life. But cold feet and a stone cold stressed out bride are two different wedding animals: avoid falling into either category. At the end of the day, you’ll want to look back with fond memories of planning and your actual wedding ceremony.
