        "text": "My objective for this session was to capture M31 and M81/M82 in Ha. This was my first Ha-only session since discovering that filter offset focusing doesn’t work for Ha and broadband in the same session, because correct focusing of the main camera throws the guide camera too far out of focus. Ironically, filter offset focusing caused much difficulty in getting the session started, even though I was only using one filter for the entire session. In the same line of thinking that led me to change RGB exposures from 120s to 60s, I wanted to try changing Ha exposures from 7m to 5m.\n\nThe sequence that I assembled during the early afternoon was straightforward. All imaging would be 5m exposures through the Ha filter. The default autofocus filter was changed from L to Ha, and only one autofocus run was called for, and that was just before the first light frame was captured. Any refocus for the remainder of the session would be as a result of HFR increasing more than 5%. The rotation for this session was set at 30 degrees. M31 was the first target and it would be starting just before the meridian and continue until 0000. After a park/unpark pair to get the scope ready for return to the eastern hemisphere, the next target was M81/M82, and that target would continue until dawn.\n\nSunset was at 1646, and the end of astronomical dusk was 1820. The moon is close enough to New that it will be rising in the dawn and the waning crescent will not be a factor. Astrospheric was calling for below average seeing improving to average seeing.\n\nI ventured outside at 1520 to uncover the scope, attach the imaging train and flats panel, and connect the power and data cables. This only took a few minutes. At 1610, I was back at the scope to power up. I came back inside to establish ASCOM connections to all of the devices in NINA.\n\nWith regards to startup activities, I elected to retain the previous session’s polar alignment. Because of the Ha filter’s much lower transmissivity, slightly modified approach was used to focus the main and guide cameras. I first acquired and zoomed in on Polaris using the L filter and .5s exposures. Then I switched to the Ha filter with 10s exposures and went outside to focus the main camera. This stage of focusing took about a minute of outside time. I came back in side to prepare for focusing the guide camera by slewing to meridian/equator and waiting for the sky to become dark enough. Once dark enough the trip outside to focus the guide camera took about another minute. I came back inside to initiate the PHD2 calibration and GA runs.\n\nCalibration completed nominally. GA returned hi-freq star motion of .26” and PAE of .5’. I observed the Dec plot line during the GA run, and noticed that the reported PAE varied with each plot’s variance from 0, or no error. At 0 error, PAE was 0, and the PAE was larger or smaller depending on the error of each individual plot.\n\nI initiated the sequence well before the sky was dark enough to begin imaging. As the sequence approached the end of the built in the wait time, I monitored the physical progress of the flats panel and the initial slew.\n\nThe panel performed flawlessly, but the slew was putting the scope on the east side of the pier, which was a reach back into the eastern hemisphere. The scope was coming close to the pier, so I stopped the slew and reset the M31 target portion of the sequence, and restarted it with the scope already pointing toward the eastern hemisphere. This time it slewed correctly.\n\nNext the sequence attempted to center the target, and that failed. It then stepped right into the first autofocus run, which also failed. I suspected the focuser, so I reset the M31 target in the sequence, and I reset the focuser ASCOM connection, both to no avail. I continued to fight the problem until I about 1930 when I noticed that the focuser was making an adjustment after the autofocus run, then I realized what was going on.\n\nAlthough I was smart enough to set the default autofocus filter from L to Ha for this Ha-only session, it didn’t occur to me to turn off offset focusing. Because it was left on, NINA would add the offset steps after every movement of the filter. This would throw the main camera too far out of focus to complete plate solving to center the target or to complete an auto focus run. After turning offset focusing off and restarting, I monitored the sequence start up, which went flawlessly. At 1945 I left the session on its own for the balance of the evening.\n\nI checked the session at 0550 and found it capturing M81/M83 as expected, and the session was performing well. Guiding was 0.75” RMS, star HFRs were 1.81. Even though I had forgotten to check the minimum ADU value at session start up to ensure separation from the left side of the histogram, I found it at a comfortable 370 ADUs. The session was set to complete at 0612.\n\nAfter the session completed, the scope parked, the camera cooled, and the flats panel closed.\n\nTake:\n\nM31: 49 Ha x 5m for 4:05\n\nM81/M82: 69 Ha x 5m for 5:45\n\nSession integration total: 9:50\n\nSession total: 1945 to 0615 = 10.30\n\nSession Efficiency: 9.9/10.5 = 90.5%\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe initial slew of the scope to the wrong hemisphere requires additional investigation. Perhaps the mount safety eastern safety limit is set too wide. It probably make more sense to be very conservative here rather than have a permissive limit. Solution: Reset mount safety limits and used a more conservative eastern safety limit.\n\nSession efficiency was great, but this was with just one filter. I detected only five autofocus runs. More sessions with seeing and star motion information are required before any conclusions can be drawn.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe observed relationship in GA between the variance of each Dec plot and the PAE tells me that the overall trend of the Dec plots is the only important polar alignment indicator. A flat trend is great. One that slopes up or down just a little is good. One that slopes up or down a lot is bad. Simple. Observe the trend and go with one that is great or even a good one.\n\nTo-Do List\n\nCheck the eastern safety limit.\n\nOverall and in spite of the rough start up, this was a good session. Learning how to properly set up focusing for an Ha-only session was a significant advancement in my craft. It may be a while before I am able to process this data.\n\nSeeing unexpected clear sky shaping up in the late afternoon, I made a last-minute decision to uncover the telescope. My objectives were to determine at what time I could safely capture light panel flats without light leakage in the imaging train, and to determine where flats capture best fits into my workflow. Time permitting, and since the waxing gibbous moon was high in the sky, I would capture a stars-only target like M35.\n\nThe daytime temperature had been near 60 degrees and I did not spend much time at the scope, so I was comfortable outside without doing more than throwing on a coat as I went out the door. The temperature was in the 40s, and there was no dew on any surface during the session. I could not detect any breeze at all. Seeing was forecast to be below average, but that was not a factor at my image scale.\n\nIn order to test for light leakage, I took the first test flat at 1630 while the sun was still shining directly onto the telescope. I had wrapped the imaging train with a small tarp, but as expected I could clearly see evidence of light leakage. The next test flat was taken at 1700, and by then the telescope was in the shadow of the cottage. I could not see any evidence of light leakage. To be sure, I waited until just after sunset and took another test flat at 1730. It looked exactly like the first one, so I concluded that sunset or later is a safe time to capture light panel flats.\n\nI proceeded to capture 30 x LRGB flats right after inspecting the 1730 test flat. My light panel setup (full brightness with two layers of t-shirt material) and NINA Flats Wizard settings were perfect. I captured the full complement of 120 frames in about five minutes.\n\nPolar alignment was off by a slight amount. Running through the process and adjusting went off smoothly. It occurred to me to check the bubble levels, and they were off significantly due to settling. I don’t recall how long it had been since the tripod was last set up and leveled.\n\nThere was a small issue with calibration. After slewing to 0,0 I stepped right into calibration, which threw a backlash error. I had forgotten to nudge north before initiating calibration. When I gave the telescope a nudge north prior to repeating the process, it slewed 24 degrees east. I slewed back to 0,0 and retried twice with the hand controller and got the same result. I next tried with the Gemini.net ascom software controller, and got the same result. I restarted the mount, and that cleared the problem. I cannot think of anything that would cause this to occur.\n\nCapture of M35 went well. I had setup a sequence to slew to and center the target, initiate an autofocus run, and capture 21 L, and 7 each RGB with an autofocus run after each focus run. This went off start to finish without a hitch, but intermittent clouds rolled through and ruined several frames. I will probably only process them enough to check how well a prominent dust mote gets flatted out.\n\nGuiding was about as good as I have been able to get lately. Ra/Dec/Tot RMS for the longest session (42m) were .67”/.28”/.72”. Even with Ra being nearly 3x that of Dec, stars appeared round in the images. I would like to get Ra under better control, but that might night happen until Level 6 upgrade, which might help by itself, and GEM-Pro is available.\n\nEven with the clouds, the session was productive. With practice, flats capture has become easy and fast, and I have a better sense of how Flats fit into my session start up. With respect to efficiency and how smoothly I am able to get a session started, I am at least back to the point that I had reached last summer, perhaps even better.\n\nI somewhat later realized that while being close to focus from the last session, I would have preferred to have waited until after focusing before capturing flats. I took a few minutes to think about where to fit flats into workflow. Dusk sky flats doesn’t work because the telescope hasn’t been focused. Dawn sky flats doesn’t work because I do not want to create a requirement to stay awake until the sky gets bright enough. That leaves me with light panel flats capture needing to be incorporated into my start up, which I strive to have complete by the end of astronomical twilight (about 90 minutes after sunset).\n\nMy pre-flats routine was to polar align (about 35 minutes after sunset), initial focus, and calibration. There are two primary considerations in sequencing with flats capture inserted into session start up: 1) focus needs to be done before capturing flats, and 2) I don’t want to do flats after polar alignment because of jostling the telescope when removing the flats panel could perturb the polar alignment.\n\nThe sequence that I want to test next time is to monitor the main camera to determine how soon after sunset that I can see stars well enough to focus. I am guessing that it will be about 35 – 40 minutes after sunset. If that’s the case, then I can focus and capture flats without delaying polar alignment more than about 20 minutes compared to the previous workflow. With end of astronomical twilight being the goal for completing start up, I still have 30 minutes or more to complete calibration. I think that this is workable.\n\nThere are three things for me to work on before my next session. I had to use the home wifi for remote connectivity, because I could not connect through either of the Mango nano routers. I suspect that resetting them is all that is required, but I’d like to know why they stopped working after performing so well for several weeks. I would feel better about the tripod being level, so I want to straighten that out. And finally, and this is a hold over from measuring per filter focus positions, I want to take apart the focuser clutch to see if I can figure out why the focuser position for the same filter is always smaller on subsequent measurements. Since rain is likely to prevent me from working on it today, I will probably reach out to Ron at Moonlite to see what he advises.\n\nYesterday morning I saw what looked like halfway decent weather from dusk through about 2200 for capturing some test data in the evening, but I was afraid that I was going to miss the opportunity due to my mother-in-law’s birthday. I managed to get the scope set up, and to find some time to get an imaging session going, at which time it pretty much ran itself.\n\nMy objective for this session was to capture some calibration frames and some test data on the Monkey Head Nebula to check a capture change that I made and to check my processing workflow. Overall, I am pleased with the session. The problem areas were all related to focus. Some were bit of Jim silly-ness that I can easily avoid going forward, and I uncovered some technical focusing issues, most of which can be resolved easily.\n\nSet up went very well at about 1650, about 30 minutes before sunset. The temperature was 41 degrees when I went back out to get the session going at 1750, about 30 minutes after sunset. There was no surface breeze at all. The seeing was forecast to be marginal, but I thought that it looked pretty good.\n\nMy first task was to shoot some calibration frames. Without too much difficulty I was able to get the Flat panel brightness set to deliver proper Flats, and I shot 30 Flats for each filter in the LRGB set, 120 frames total. I remembered shooting Bias frames last year, but since they are more than six months old, I decided to shoot another set instead of looking for the old ones.\n\nI was able to finish the calibration frames, polar align, get an initial focus, and complete PHD calibration and GA run in just about an hour, which was before the end of astronomical twilight at 1853. I had to wait a few minutes beyond that time for the target to ascend above the trees.\n\nJust a word on sequencing here. I was lucky that I found the main camera through the L filter to be in perfect focus (from the last session), but changing focus after taking Flats is not the right sequence. I need to add to my workflow to capture Flats after achieving an initial focus that is validated by an autofocus run. Doing Flats after polar alignment and initial focus seems to have an added benefit in that the sky is dark enough that I need not worry about light leaks in the imaging train ruining my calibration frames.\n\nI set up NINA to shoot 45 Lum frames at 60s each, and 15 R, G and B frames at 90s each and initiated the capture sequence.\n\nThe first focusing issue that I had was self-induced. I set up NINA to do an autofocus run after every filter change, but I forgot to include a line for an auto focus run at the start of the capture run. Since the L filter was already in place when I started the run, there was no autofocus on the L filter. I realized the oversight several minutes into the run, but since I had just obtained a precise focus position with the Bahtinov mask, I decided to let the session run instead of interrupting.\n\nAn autofocus did execute after changing to the R filter. This is where the second focuser issue appeared, which was that the new focus position after the filter change was about 100 steps less than the one before it. This is a lot of steps, so the quality of my L frames were now suspect. Just in case, I added a line at the end of the sequence to capture another set of luminance images. This line of the sequence would execute after a filter change, so there would be a fresh autofocus run before shooting the L filter again.\n\nThe 100-step problem continued after the change to the G filter, after the change to the B filter, and after the change back to the L filter. As a result of this, the focuser position for the second L filter run at the end was almost 500 steps short of the initial L filter run. The stars for all of the runs looked pretty good, so the different focuser positions didn’t seem to indicate an out of focus position. The autofocus graph did reveal something interesting.\n\nA normal autofocus run starts at a good focus position, backs the focuser out a certain amount, then takes an image and measures the FWHM (star size) and plots it on a graph with the focuser position. It nudges the focuser in a prescribed amount and then measures again. The FWHM plot begins as a downward (negative) sloping line. After about four iterations of this activity and as better focus is achieved, the slope of the FWHM plots will begin to increase from the initial negative slope toward zero, and eventually the slope will become positive on the other side of the best focus position. The finished curve is hyperbolic with maybe five plots on each side of the center, which is the “perfect” focus position.\n\nAgain, that description was for a normal run. The runs that I was seeing last night required maybe eight or ten plots to get back to the focus position. I attribute this to a loose clutch between the stepper motor and the draw tube. Because the loose clutch was slipping, each inward nudge was not moving the draw tube as much as it would have moved if it were tight, so more inward steps were required to get to the low point on the hyperbolic curve.\n\nThe third focusing issue was that the guide camera was in focus for the initial L filter run. The HFD numbers we bouncing around between the low 3s to low 4s. After the change to the R filter (and subsequent autofocus run, I noticed that the stars in the PHD display were quite bloated, and the HFD numbers were in the low 6s to high 7s. I attributed this to the new focuser position. Guiding was a little degraded, but good enough. At this point I thought in for a penny, in for a pound, so I let it run. This condition persisted for the G and B filter runs, but the HFD numbers got better for the final L run. I concluded from this that the L and the RGB filters are not parfocal\n\nThe temp was 34 degrees and RH was 75% when I ended the session at 2230. There was light frost on the grass, but nothing else. I also noticed as I was coming back inside that a light fog had set in.\n\nI was set up to for about 1.9 hours of integration time with the LRGB. If I am able to use the second set of L frames in processing (LRGBL), then I’ll have something closer to 2.5 hours.\n\nAn overall conclusion that I have reached is that my guiding is good enough that I want to dedicate sessions when sky conditions are good to capture higher quality calibration and light frames for the purpose tweaking capture and processing. When sky conditions are good enough to work at the scope, but seeing and transparency are marginal, I will dedicate to guiding and focus tweaks.\n\nThinking through the focuser issues, all of them seem solvable, but I will probably need a night just to work on focusing to resolve them. Not getting an autofocus run before shooting the first L images is easy. I just have to remember to add the line to the sequence. As for the extra 100 steps the focuser was taking to get back to focus in the autofocus runs, I need to check the clutch, and that is easy to tighten. I have a step in my capture workflow to do this, but I was working off script last night. With the clutch operating properly I can measure precise focus positions for all of the filters.\n\nThe filters not being parfocal will be tougher to solve that I had imagined last night. Let’s assume that I have the main and guide cameras perfectly and simultaneously focused with the L filter in the optical path. Also assuming the L and the RGB filters are not parfocal, the focuser positions for the filters will be slightly different. The guide camera, which picks off its light in front of the filter, will move with the main camera as it moves from the L focus position to the R focus position. If the guide camera were in focus at the L position, it would have to be out of focus when it arrives at the R position.\n\nPutting the OAG behind the filter wheel is not an option. I hope to transition to narrowband imaging this year. Main camera exposure durations through narrowband filters are on the order of tens of minutes. Guiding could never work with that tiny amount of light falling on the guide camera sensor. Since guiding worked both when well-focused through the L filter, and it worked ok when at maximum out of focus experienced through one of the RGB filters, maybe I should find an average focus that works well for all filters. Another alternative might be to obtain a parfocal filter set. More to come on this one.\n\nI have recently read about a new NINA plugin called Hocus Focus that is an auto focus improvement. Before last night I had decided to put that into the category of new things to try after WSP. Hocus Focus provides better focus by better management of how stars are selected for measuring and how they are measured. Given how important good focus is to good guiding, I am going to load it up and try it.\n\nGuide Log Analysis\n\nSession 1: Calibration run, abandoned because I forgot to nudge north before initiating. I was working off script.\n\nSession 2: A successful calibration run\n\nSession 3: GA unguided run\n\nSession 4: 21m run while I was waiting for the target to ascend above the trees\n\nSession 5: 52m L filter run\n\nSession 6: 25M R filter run\n\nSession 7: 25M G filter run\n\nSession 8: 25M B filter run\n\nSession 9: 52m 2nd L filter run\n\nOverall:\n\nI was looping 1s exposures. I would have preferred to have been at 3s, but I attribute this error to working off script.\n\nPolar alignment error measurements (Drift tab) varied from .1’ to 2’ through the session. As opposed going from good to bad, or the other way around, the variation as all over the place between the high and low errors reported. As I suspected, PAE cannot be accurately measured, probably due to seeing. Taking the max PAE that I saw in any one session (2’), I can say that my PA was pretty good.\n\nSeeing (RMS noise) and transparency (SNR decrease) seem to have worsened during Session 8 (Blue filter)\n\nUnguided Ra in the GA run was 1.97” due to the worm periodic error. Through the well focused L filter, guided Ra in sessions 4 and 5 improved to about .55”, and maybe got a little worse when the seeing and transparency worsened.\n\nUnguided Dec in the Ga run was .40”. Guiding through the well focused L filter in Sessions 4 and 5 improved RMS to .33”. Dec guiding through the poorly focused RGB filters was .56 or worse. It seems that I would have been better off not guiding on the Dec axis.\n\nThe PHD GA set the Dec limit was set at about .35”, but the seeing noise suggests that maybe it should have been set higher. I don’t want to conclude anything at this point because my looping duration was too short. I do want to pay attention to what I see as the possibility of PHD actually making RMS worse.\n\nIt is interesting to turn on the Scatter and SNR graphs, and watch how the graphs change through the sessions. Session 3 (unguided) shows Dec as no drift but with seeing noise exceeds the limit. The non-seeing variation in Ra is periodic error, which shows up as the wider left-right scatter. Sessions 4 through 6 show fairly good scatter. Scatter gets worse in 7 and 8 (unfocused, worse seeing), before getting better in 9 with better guide camera focus, but not as good as the other L filter session. I attribute the difference between the to L sessions as worse seeing. I still need to analyze the data in PixInsight. I am interested in seeing how the star size metrics changed through the focusing issues.\n\nImage analysis: While not perfect, because the conditions were not perfect, the data are pretty good. Everything looks to be focused. I saw a little bloat late in the session due to deteriorating conditions. I also saw a little less noise in my RGB (90s exposure) frames than in the L frames (60s per exposure). In short, I think that captures are going well, and there are no further capture issues to work on before WSP.\n\nThere’s just one thing that I don’t want to learn, and that’s a lesson.\n\n– Homer J. Simpson.\n\nGenerally, I find that as I make astronomy easier, I tend to do more of it. This note is about the lessons-learned that I have applied to make astronomy easier, and then do more of it.\n\nMAINTAIN A WARM SCOPE\n\nAs my setup is quite sophisticated, setup and tear down time for every observing session can be as much as two hours. By having a telescope on a mount with decent polar alignment shortens the time to about twenty minutes to uncover the scope, add a camera, and add power. There have been occasions that I have unexpectedly woken up in the wee hours of the morning, found clear skies, and decided to go out to the scope, and add a camera and power for an imaging session. I seriously doubt that I would ever do a from-scratch setup in the middle of the night. Two keys to making this possible are a 365-day cover, and a couple of pavers set into the turf to prevent the telsecope legs from sinking into the soft soil.\n\nIMAGE REMOTELY\n\nSitting alone in the dark to manage an imaging session is not fun. Doing it on a freezing cold night is even less fun. Being able to spend 15 minutes to prepare for a session during the daylight, and another 15 minutes to polar align and get an initial focus position removes a lot of imaging downside. Being able to conduct an imaging session from a warm house after polar aligning and focusing is fun. The two keys to making this possible are having an extra computer so that I can leave one connected to accessories at the scope, and another computer that can remotely access the scope-side computer from in the house or camper. The other key is a nano router that enables remote access when away from the home WIFI network.\n\nBUNDLE WIRES\n\nI use many accessories to automate various aspects of my imaging sessions, which include mount controller, electronic focuser, guide camera, filter wheel, and main camera. These accessores require 12vdc power or data (USB) connections, or both. My single cable consists of about ten individual wires. In the bundling. At some point in the development of my setup, the wires hanging off of the back of my scope made it look like a ghilley suit, and I had a rat’s nest of wires beneath the tripod. Slewing was hazardous because wires were dragging behind the scope, and prone to snag. My solution was to bundle wires so that a single cable runs from the scope, connects to the mount controller, and then to a power board on the ground. I leave connection ends where they need to be to connect to their device. Running each of these wires separately, and then zip tying them to prevent snags takes a considerable amount of time and effort. With my present setup, I pick up one cable (instead of ten wires) I spend about a minute making wiring connections, and I need to add only one zip tie.\n\nWRITE\n\nThis item goes to the Jim-ism, you won’t remember as much as you think that you will.\n\nWrite and use workflow documents. Common mistakes that I make during an imaging session are forgetting to do something important, doing it in the wrong sequence, or just plain doing it wrong. This goes to the Jim-ism, you won’t remember as much as you think that you will. I add the word “use” to the title of this section, because I notice several instances of making rookie mistakes by going off script. In addition to keeping me on track, a write work flow is a great place to insert an obscure new step that I learn, and might be otherwise likely to forget by the time of my next imaging session. For me, it is so tempting to just forge ahead on my own, but looking at a script keeps me on track. In places were I know the procedure very well, I might read (glance at) several steps, execute them, then read again to make sure that I covered everything. I tend to pare down the steps as I become more proficient. I no longer need the details, so polar alignment, for instance, has become a single step. I consider my workflow documents to be as important as my equipment and my skills. I do better astronomy and have fewer imaging sessions end badly when I stay on script.\n\nWrite up observing reports. By writing observing reports, I have a record of what I have done, and useful patterns emerge. I also document the problems that I had, so that I can track them to resolution. Just the act of writing them alone forces me to think more deeply about what I have done during a session. I can also just look at the titles and see overarching patterns, like how many sessions have been dedicated to one kind of astrophotography or another, or how long it has been since I have devoted a session to a certain kind of session.\n\nDRESS FOR THE WEATHER\n\nEven if I have the gear, I must be sure to wear it when appropriate. I have had imaging sessions ended by cold weather because I tried to tough it out early on, and then found that I couldn’t wam up after having let myself get cold. I have heard it said that the best way to stay warm is to never let yourself get cold. My warm weather gear consists of a warm hat, a parka under which I wear several layers, ski pants under which I wear several layers, insulated boots in which I can put battery powered feet wamers, and thin and thick gloves in which I can put chemical hand warmers.\n\nGO TO DARK SITES\n\nDSO imaging at a dark site is more efficient than at a bright sky site. For DSO imaging in my backyard under a Bortle Class 6 sky, eight to ten hours of image data collect is required to support a high quality image of a dim nebula. At a dark site, two to four hours of collection is sufficient for many dim targets. As my DSO imaging skill improves, I expect to collect on multiple targets in a single night at a dark site.\n\nDAILY SCAN AND PLAN\n\nIt is my habit to do a scan soon after I am awake every morning. I conduct this scan with an eye toward what astronomy things that I want to do on that day. First, I want to know what my commitments are. That can take out small or large parts of day, take out a whole day, or take out several days. Before deciding on the day’s activities, I make a weather and conditions-based decision about what imaging that I might want to do. For example, if the moon is out, I might image it, planets, or star clusters. If the moon is away, I might choose nebulous targets. The seeing and transparency forecast might affect my decision. After deciding that, I consider what daytime work might be needed to support that evening’s imaging. I also consider other equipment work or tweaks that I can accomplish.\n\nDo daytime work during daylight hours. I am constantly alert for opportunities to accomplish every task that I can during daylight hours. First of all, any task is likely to be easier in the daylight, so why not do then what can be done then? Secondly, clear night skies are a rare commodity, so why defer tasks more appropriate for daylight hours until darkness?\n\nMake the best use possible of marginal nights. One of my chief goals is to be as prepared as possible for collecting the highest-quality image data on nights with the best transparency, in the darkest sites. If I defer testing and tweaking of equipment, for instance, to these nights, then I have squandered premium image time on something that very well could have already been done. For instance, if I can tune my autoguiding on marginal nights, then I am prepared to collect image data when a rare premium night comes along. Other tasks are even more obvious. I would never attempt a delicate backlash adjustment at night.\n\nPractice. This section goes to another Jim-ism, one must learn new things quicker than onld ones are forgotten in order to improve one’s skill. All aspects of a session need to be practiced. If I set up during an afternoon that promises marginal skies that evening, and then it is completely clouded out, then I have paracticed setting up. If I work with my autoguiding system on a marginal night, then I have practiced imaging. If I have spent most of the summer and the entire fall on planetary imaging, then I have not practiced DSO imaging, and it will take me a while to get good at it again.\n\nMy objective for this session was to take advantge of the forecasted average seeing to brush up on my planetary imaging skills.\n\nSetup went without a hitch. I also set up to check collimation with the artificial star, but the air was not still enough before I had to begin cooking dinner at 1800. I set the dew heater on high and came back inside.\n\nI was back out at the scope by 1915. The temperature was around 51 degrees and the RH was 75%. The air was completely still and the metal table was completely dry. I noticed that the moon was down in the tress as Stellarium had projected.\n\nMy first task was to check collimation. The artificial star was still quite jumpy, but on average seemed to be more or less centered. I didn’t think that I could improve the collimation, so I moved on to polar alignment.\n\nAs I was about to check polar alignment, I noticed the moon peeking through a small gap between two trees, so I decided to attempt a capture. I was unable to acquire it and get focused before it had moved into the next tree.\n\nNext, I checked polar alignment, which I expected to be significantly off as a result of jostling the mount to get the Meade up on it. I would guess it was about a degree off. I adjusted the mount and moved on.\n\nAlthough I wanted to wait until after 2200 to image Jupiter with the GRS in view, I went ahead and did a preliminary capture of 5 RGB runs at 30s per filter. This preliminary image was processed and posted while I was waiting to go back out for the main Jupiter capture.\n\nI was back inside by 2010. The temperature was 47 degrees when I came in, and there was no dew on the metal table.\n\nThe second Jupiter capture was from 2205 to 2225. The temperature was 42 degrees and the RH was 85 percent. There was no dew on the table and the air was still. The image on the display during the capture was consistent with the Average seeing forecast. My main capture with the GRS visible was 10 RGB runs at 30s yielding 2900 frames per filter.\n\nAfter setting an alarm for 0330, I made it outside for Mars captures at 0345 and was out until 0425. The temperature was 35 degrees and RH was 98%. The air was still and there was dew on the metal table. The front glass was as clear as a bell. The live image on the display looked better than Average. I was well-bundled but started getting chilly by the end. My fingers were getting cold, but I couldn’t operate the handset to manually guide with gloves on.\n\nI made three capture runs in a small ROI: one IR run of 90s, three RGB runs of 60s per filter, and one RGB run of 90s per filter. I’ll look up more frame counts and rates when I process, but I was seeing the FPS bounce around between 400 and 700 when during the R captures. And finally, I made one full FoV run of 30 frames with 1s shutter in L to capture Phobos and Dione.\n\nUnless I discover something else in processing, the only item I have that requires attention is autoguiding in Firecapture so that I do not have to work for extended periods of time with my hands exposed. The remaining captures this year are likely to be as cold or colder. Jupiter and Saturn will have shifted toward the cooler months when they come around again next year. How to connect to the mount requires some thought as both of my laptop USB ports are occupied by the camera and the filter wheel. Two initial ideas come to mind. First, and probably simplest, is to connect to the mount and filter wheel through a USB hub and connect the laptop directly to the camera since the camera requires the highest data throughput. Another idea is to connect the nano-router to the Ethernet port on the mount control panel and connect to it that way.\n\nI discovered a camera rotation issue when I was processing the images. I noticed that the camera alignment had changed when I went out to image Mars. I really didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nMy habit is to align the long axis of the camera frame with the Dec axis of the mount. That way, north and south of the planet (or any object) is at the top or bottom of the frame. Another benefit of this alignment is that during manual guiding, I can recenter the object with just one directional arrow on the hand controller. Having this alignment will be essential to get Firecapture’s auto guiding to function correctly.\n\nWhen I came out to image Mars, the alignment had rotated about 45 degrees. I was able to quickly figure out which keys to press to recenter, and I moved on. It was too cold to troubleshoot.\n\nBut the problem appeared before then. While derotating my 2nd Jupiter image in WINJUPOS, the last image that I captured (at 2200-ish) before shooting Mars, I noticed that the rotation of the wire frame needed to be rotated a just two nudges between any two images. I did not expect much from the final image, but it turned out ok.\n\nIt turns out that the issue causing the rotated images was the ASI290 threaded connection to the back of the filter wheel had come loose. The cable and camera stayed in one orientation with respect to the ground, while everything forward of the camera rotated as the telescope tracked the sky. I try to be careful not to overtighten threaded connections as sometimes threads bind up and are difficult to break loose. There’s gotta be a sweet spot somewhere in between.\n\nNow that I have the camera rotation problem solved, I should not have to adjust the wire diagram once it is set properly. It should be good for measuring all of the images in a single run. I didn’t image Saturn last night, but if I had I would have gone 90s per filter, and I would not expect to need to adjust the wire diagram once it is set.\n\nNo big breakthrough moments last night, but sessions where all goes as it is supposed to are always enjoyable. I feel that I am “staying in shape” for that elusive perfect imaging night.\n\nThe primary equipment that I used for all runs was G11, LX850, and ASI290MM. This setup, polar alignment and collimation held over from the previous night were all good for another night. The only change up was replacing the dew strap with the dew shield/heater. I powered up the equipment before sunset, to include turning the dew heater on high, so starting my session when I came out at 2100 consisted of acquiring my first target, connecting the laptop, and starting Firecapture.\n\nThe Astrospheric forecast was for transparency to be average throughout the night, and seeing started off at average, then improving to above average at 0100. The temperature was forecasted to be a few degrees warmer than the night before, and I planned to dress a little more warmly. The forecasted temp and dew point did not completely converge until right before daybreak, but I expected dew to form before then.\n\nThe Astrospheric forecast mostly held up, but I don’t think that the seeing improved until closer to 0230 and not by as much as I had hopped. With the slightly warmer temps and being dressed properly, I was much more comfortable than the night before. I had the dew shield/heater turned on since right before sunset. With that and the slightly better dew forecast I didn’t see any dew on the front glass at all during the night.\n\nThe temperature was still 49 degrees when I came outside at 2100, and no dew had formed on the table-like dew measuring device (aka metal table) at that point.\n\nMy first target was Saturn just as it came off of the meridian. The seeing was ok, but not great, so I grabbed the best focus that I could by eyeballing it and at 2118 I went on to capture 10 RGB runs at 60s/filter with a 750 x 450 ROI. Shutter speeds were about 91ms at 550 gain, which yielded a 95% histogram (I should have traded some of that histogram, say down to 70%, for a faster shutter and higher frame rate). Frame rate was about 10FPS, which yielded about 330 frames per filter for a total of 9,900 frames. Saturn was at 0.58 magnitude with an apparent diameter of 17.86” and elevated 34 degrees.\n\nBy 2200, Jupiter was out of the trees, so I turned to it. Again, the seeing wasn’t great, but the GRS was right on the central meridian, so I didn’t want to miss that. I knew that I could come back to Jupiter when it had ascended to a greater elevation and the seeing had improved. I shot 10 RGB runs at 30s/filter with a 700 x 700 ROI. Shutter speeds were about 4ms with about 400 gain, which yielded an 88% histogram. Frame rate was around 100FPS, which yielded about 2900 frames per filter, and about 87,000 frames total. Jupiter was at magnitude -2.91 with an apparent diameter of 49.39”, and elevated 43 degrees. The detail that I could see on the display was not quite what I had experienced the previous night.\n\nIt was 2225 when I finished the Jupiter runs. I noted that the metal table was still dry. I covered the front glass and came back inside to wait for the seeing to improve and for Mars to clear the trees. My intention was to head back out at midnight, but I fell asleep (high quality problem) in the chair until 0115.\n\nReturning to the scope, I found that the metal table was dewy, but the front glass still dry. Jupiter had crossed the meridian by this time. I was disappointed to find that the seeing had worsened. The dark bands were not just rippling, but they were jumping from place to place on the face of Jupiter. I watched for maybe 20 minutes and this did not improve. I decided not to bother with a capture and to move on to Mars via a short focusing session on Aldebaran with the Bahtinov mask. After doing the mask focus, I would not touch the focus for the Mars runs. I did check the front glass and found that it was still dry.\n\nAn observation regarding the seeing. I have been monitoring seeing as it seems to get worse with humidity. What I saw with my second visit to Jupiter seems to support my hunch that higher humidity portends worse seeing. That the Astrospheric forecast was for above average seeing by this time seems to lend greater support for humidity adversely affecting seeing. But I’ll add that I thought that higher humidity was supposed to calm the seeing. I will continue to watch this relationship.\n\nOn arrival at Mars, the seeing was not what I had hoped for. I waited until about 0225 before I started imaging. The seeing had improved a little. I captured 5 iRGB runs at 60s/filter with a 320 x 320 ROI. Shutter speed was about 1ms with about 400 gain, which yielded a 70% histogram. Frame rate was about 573 FPS, which yielded about 34,400 frames per filter, or 172,000 frames total. Mars’ magnitude was -.76 with an apparent diameter of 12.8”, and elevated 50 degrees above the horizon.\n\nI think it is worth pausing here to note the observable differences between the three planets that I imaged, and the image settings. Jupiter and Mars’s were brightest in the negative magnitudes and Saturn was a half magnitude. From an appearance perspective there is a vast difference between Jupiter and Saturn. With regard to apparent size, Jupiter is by far the largest, and Saturn barely beats Mars. And looking at elevations, Mars was by far the highest, and I could have waited for more elevation. Similarly with Jupiter, as it was not going to get much higher than it was at capture. Saturn was at the lowest elevation of the three planets, but it was near its highest elevation for the evening. Jupiter, in spite of the larger and shorter limit per filter yielded by far the highest number of frames. Dimmer Saturn forced setting that yielded the smallest number of frames.\n\nAs I shut down the session, I checked the front glass and it was still dry, and I was still comfortable when I came inside at 0300 and saw that the temperature was 45 degrees.\n\nYesterday was a busy astronomy day, even before getting to the targets that this report covers. Today I set up the GM8/TV/ASI178 for shooting the Moon, and I put the ASI290 non the Meade for shooting the three planets.\n\nOn the path to getting ready, I set up to check the Meade’s collimation by putting out the artificial star and pointing the telescope at it at around 1400. Knowing that collimating is difficult in the bright daylight, I came out to actually do the collimation at 1700. There was some residual sunlight across the grass, but it was gone within minutes of my arrival at the scope. The diffraction rings were shimmering all over the place as a result the ground surface still radiating a lot of heat. This caused the center of the unfocused star appear as three for four centers rapidly orbiting about one another. I watched and waited, and everything got steady about half an hour later. I was surprised to find that the center of the unfocused image was about 1/3 of the way between the center and the outer diffraction ring. I made my best guess about which adjustment screw to turn, and that guess was correct.I was able to quicky make the necessary tweaks to get to good collimation. The sky was not dark enough to begin polar alignment when I finished collimating, so I went inside for dinner. What I learned here is that with prior setup, collimation can be done without delaying polar alignment. From now on I will do a collimation any time that the scope has been handled.\n\nWhen I came back outside at 2030 it was rather chilly with the temperature in the upper 40s already. I put on my heavy blue parka and was just fine. First task was to check PA with PoleMaster. The Meade had settled a little, and the TV was about two degrees off. PoleMaster PA will be good enough for the lunar and planetary work that I have planned.\n\nFinishing up the PA more than an hour before Jupiter came out of the trees, I came inside to warm up. I headed back out at 2130 to begin imaging. The temperature was 45 degrees, and the temp and dewpoint plots were converging, so I was expecting dew. There was no surface wind. Astrospheric was showing average seeing and average transparency.\n\nAt 2145 I came back outside to work with the G11/Meade on Jupiter. Its apparent diameter was 49.44”, and it was I could see more Jupiter detail on the FC display that I had ever seen before. Seeing appeared to be better than average, so that could help account for the better image. The Chroma filters and better collimation could have helped with this, which would have improved focus as well. I captured one RGB run on Jupiter with Io and its shadow about to move off of the western limb. After Io was well separated from Jupiter’s disk, I captured another RGB while the shadow was still visible.\n\nWanting to wait until Io’s shadow had moved off of Jupiter’s disk before continuing with my main capture of Jupiter, I moved to the GM8/TV to capture the moon. At the TV/ASI178 image scale, I could see no evidence of bad seeing. Since the moon is ever so slightly larger than the frame height, I captured one run of the top of the moon and another of the bottom. These two images will be stitched together in PS during processing.\n\nThe capture details are two OSC runs (one top and one bottom) with the ASI178. My exposure strategy for this target and this setup was to set a frame limit instead of a time limit for the capture. In this case, I shot 10,000 frames with 0.75ms exposures at 104 gain. The total duration for each run was about 165s. I was getting about 60fps capturing the full frame instead of selecting an ROI. The capture time was around 2300, at which time the Moon was about 1.5 hours before the meridian and 45 degrees elevated above the horizon with the Ra being N5 degrees. The Moon was about 2 degrees below the ecliptic. At 15.0 days old, it was 99% illuminated. Its apparent diameter was 31’54”.\n\nWhile on the Moon, I found what appeared to be something pushing the scope slightly to one side, then releasing. This was accompanied by an audible tick that seemed to be coming from the Ra gearbox. My guess at the time was that the Oldham coupler was binding, but I don’t think that it turns that fast. I’ll need to investigate this.\n\nMoving back to the G11/Meade to shoot ten RGB runs on Jupiter, it was about 90 minutes before the meridian. It’s Ra was just below the celestial equator. This time I remembered to verify that the filter wheel was actually turning, and found that it was not, and I might find that the filter wheel did not rotate during the first two runs that I did on Jupiter. I found the cause was a driver error that I was able to clear by restarting the computer. I think that this error popped up as a result of switching between the monochrome (needs filter wheel) and the OSC camera (does not need filter wheel), or perhaps switching improperly. For example, maybe I should have closed and re-opened FC between captures. I also found dew on the front glass of the scope. Expecting dew, it would have been prudent for me to have covered the Meade while I was working on the TV. I put my finger under the dew strap to verify that it was warm, and it did not seem to be warm at all. It occurred to me that maybe the warmth that I could feel when the scope was 65 degrees might not be discernable when the heat is being more rapidly conducted into the 40 degree scope.\n\nThe ten runs were shot at 30s/filter through the RGB set. Exposure was about 3-4s and gain was about 325, which resulted in a 80% histogram. With a 720 x 710 ROI, I was getting around 100 fps, which yielded about 2900 frames per filter.\n\nI slewed to Uranus to see if it had cleared the trees, and not only found that it had, but it landed in my FC display without having to hunt it down. I was so excited about having landed on it that I forgot to check the front glass, which I am sure was already getting dewed up again. Going to normal exposure settings, I found Uranus to be a shimmering mess due to worsening seeing, but I captured six RGB runs since I was already fairly well invested in this target. I was shooting 60s/filter with an exposure duration of 81.5ms and gain 450. This yielded a 12 fps for a total of 730 frames per filter and histogram of 85%.\n\nBefore leaving Uranus, I captured 20 1s exposures at 600 gain that were highly over exposed to reveal Uranus’ satellites.\n\nMy final slew was to Mars. Fortuitously, I had left Uranus’ highly over exposed capture settings in Firecapture. Because of this I saw one of Mars’ satellites to the east of the planet as it settled into the FC display. I checked in Stellarium and found that it was Phobos. This is something that I never expected to see in my life! I then slewed to the west side of Mars where Deimos was supposed to be and there it was as well!\n\nUnfortunately, I was under time pressure because of the dew situation, so I captured five iRGB runs on Mars before coming back to the two satellites. The reasons why I shot just five runs were that Mars looked too crappy for me to invest to much time on this target. Also, I had doubled by exposure limit to 60s, and was getting about 35 frames. Exposure duration was 1ms and gain 400. ROI was 730 x 730, which at a 68% histogram yield 570 fps for a total of 35,000 frames per filter. Mars was elevated 55 degrees and presented at nearly 13” apparent diameter at the time of this capture.\n\nWhile setting up to capture Mars’ satellites, found that I could bring out Phobos and Deimos a little better at 1.2s so I went with that. Mars itself was a huge bright blob that wanted to wash out the entire frame at this exposure setting, but I found that I could improve the contrast on the satellites by moving it off of the edge of the display.\n\nI finished my work at the scope and came back inside for good at 0300. The temperature was 41 degrees, and the dew on surfaces was approaching Farm quality. By the end of the Mars capture, I was getting very cold. Even though my time outside was rather brief, I should have been dressed with more layers.\n\nHere is what I learned from this session:\n\nA pattern that I have noticed over the past two sessions is that seeing will be pretty good at first, and then decline as the dew gets worse. For some reason I was expecting better seeing to accompany high humidity, but that may not be the case. I’ll keep an eye on this relationship in future sessions.\n\nI may be surprised at what satellites of other planets can be brought out with 1s and longer exposures. I look forward to experimenting with this.\n\nWith prior setup, collimation is fast and easy, and should be done before using the scope any time that it has moved.\n\nAnd here is a to-do list:\n\nLooking at my log files to get exposure parameters, I was reminded of some FC settings that are somewhat hidden. I will send you those on top of the email that walked you through your initial FC setup. I eventually want to include all of the settings in a planetary capture guide.\n\nCheck to see if the dew strap is heating\n\nCheck the GM8 tick/jerking motion\n\nFrom yesterday afternoon into the early hours of this morning I have had what is perhaps on of my most demanding astronomy days ever. This was not just the capture, but the setup, preparation, and session management. I had to fight through a great deal of fatigue to stay on my game, and to keep leaving the warmth of the house to come back to the scope. That’s right, this was a fantastic day! Although everything wasn’t “guns-n-roses” (sic) tonight, I am better prepared for my next session.\n\nAfter watching the clouds gather during the day, I wasn’t hopeful that I would get a chance to image that night. I checked Astrospheric and saw that it would clear off with below average transparency and average seeing starting in the 1 O’clock hour. I could also see the temperature and dew points converging well before then, so I expected dew. The G11/Meade were already set up. The only additional set up was to add the ASI90. I set an alarm for 0100, went to bed at 2030, but woke up on my own at 0045.\n\nI got dressed and was at the scope by 0100. Temps were in the mid-50s, RH was 94%, and the air was completely still. There was some moisture on my table, but not too bad.\n\nAs I had planned, I powered up and checked that the dew heater was on first, leaving the front cover on the scope allowing some time for the glass to warm up before exposing it to the moist air.\n\nOn going outside, I found a very gibbous waxing Moon well past the meridian, and Jupiter was just past it. Mars was not yet out of the trees at this point.\n\nI did not check polar alignment. I expected it to be somewhat off as the new blocks under the tripod were sure to have settled, and that turned out to be the case. A little more guiding input was required from me than last time, but it was not excessive.\n\nSince I already had the ASI290 on the scope, I slewed to Jupiter first and found it right at the edge of the 40mm eyepiece fov. I adjusted the scope to put it where I thought it needed to be in order to be visible on the FC display, and it was there when I flipped the mirror. Also, I noted that the filter wheel connected on start up. I verified that it was moving by watching two dividers past between R and G, and then G and B. I could also hear the filter wheel motor as it turned.\n\nI captures 10 RGB runs at 30s per filter. Exposure was around 4ms and gain about 380. I was getting about 90 FPS. Histogram was peaking at just under 90% on all filters. The yield was just under 3000 frames per filter. The data looked pretty good as it was coming in.\n\nMars was not quite over the trees yet, so I decided to shoot the Moon next. As I was about to change over to the ASI178MC, I noticed that Jupiter’s historgram had decreased to about 50%. I checked the front of the scope and found that I was completely dewed up. I also noticed that the table was much wetter. This was feeling pretty close to Farm dew.\n\nSeeing that I would soon be losing the Moon behind the cottage, I decided to pass on that target and see if I could get the front glass dried so that I could shoot Mars. Toward that end, I decided put the front cover back on the scope to see if the dew would clear while working on this report.\n\nAfter giving it an hour to dry off, I came back out to attempt Mars. It was well above the trees. Even though it was not yet close to the meridian, I could tell that it was going to pass at a very high elevation.\n\nI found that the front glass of the scope had completely dried. I noticed that the table had dried somewhat as well. I had no issue acquiring Mars, and I was struck at how much worse the seeing had become. Astrospheric was still showing below average transparency and average seeing.\n\nFor Mars, I shot 10 iRGB runs at 45s per filter. The exposure was about 4ms with the gain at 400. I was getting close to 450 fps with the histogram peaking at about 70% on all filters. The yield was about 20,000 frames per filter, which I hope will help compensate for the bad seeing. I did not feel very good about the quality of the data as it was coming in.\n\nWith the seeing being so bad, which makes precise focusing very difficult, I decided to try focusing on a star. I understand that mirror shift can change the focus when slewing from the star back to the target, but my thinking at the moment is that the resulting focus when I get back to the target is much better than I could achieve trying to focus on the target itself.\n\nFor this exercise, I first achieved the best focus (a guess) that I could on Mars itself. I then selected the star icon (instead of the Mars icon) and set the exposure to about 4s. I moved off of Mars and nudged the scope around until I found a star. It was not very bright, so I did not get sufficient diffraction spikes when I put the Bahtinov mask in front of the scope. I then tried slewing to Aldebaran, about 20 degrees away from Mars, and could clearly see the diffraction spikes. It turns out that my focus was off just a little from my best guess while trying to focus on Mars. I have decided to continue to use this technique for lunar and planetary imaging into the future.\n\nThe session ended at 0400.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIn spite of the mis-cues that will be described next, the dew, and the seeing, I felt that this was a worth while session. I got some mistakes out of the way, gained some experience, and improved my technique so that I am better prepared for that perfect night should it ever come along.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe seeing and transparency were worse than expected.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nFirst mistake tonight is that I did not do any planning. I should have opened Stellarium to see what features would be on visible on the three targets and to see where they would be placed. Not a horrible mistake, but that kind of situational awareness would have influenced the order in which I went after the targets. Second rookie mistake is that seeing what the dew situation was going to be, I should have put the dew shield/heater on the scope, and I should have allowed half an hour for it to heat up before removing the front cover. Third rookie mistake is that I am not feeling too good about collimation, so I should have set up the artificial star and checked it when I was prepping the scope yesterday afternoon.\n\nI had no equipment issues. Everything worked as it was supposed to.\n\nOn Wednesday morning I saw a very astro-friendly forecast for the evening, but I wasn’t sure if I would have an opportunity to work at the scope that night. Also, I wasn’t able to get a nap during the day, so I didn’t know if I would even feel like going out if I was otherwise able.\n\nAs it turned out, I was able to get out to the scope, and although I was very tired, I went out anyway. The Moon the whole session was huge fun with very little frustration. I had no trouble staying awake until the session ended at 0430.\n\nAstrospheric forecasted above average transparency and seeing through midnight, and then both dropping off to average afterward. Wayne called an impromptu star party and mentioned that wildfire smoke would become an issue after midnight. I didn’t think that light smoke would be an issue for imaging planets.\n\nThe Moon\n\nDuring the day I removed the ASI290 and put the ASI178 back on the scope anticipating that I would be doing lunar work first. I had made a list of eleven targets that I wanted to shoot, and memorized where they were while I was waiting for it to get dark. Stellarium showed me that I had about half an hour between the time that it got dark enough to start imaging at 2150 until the Moon began to creep over the cottage roof at about 2115. The night prior, the moon was lower, and it was already over the cottage roof before I could start shooting, so already this was shaping up to be a good night. I had also read about some performance updates to Firecapture that I was hoping would yield frame rates better than the 30 – 40 fps that I was getting the night prior.\n\nI set my limit to 4000 frames and I started my first capture at 2048. I was seeing frame rates of around 100 for full frame captures, and up to about 200 fps for smaller ROIs. With these frame rates I was able to work through my list pretty quicky, and I may have ran two or three additional unplanned captures. I was finished capturing by 2113. I captured 150 Gb of data in that short time!\n\nI was a little rusty on Tuesday night, and much smoother tonight. It felt good to be able to knock the rust off that quickly. I hope that I am as lucky when I start shooting the planets.\n\nThe temperature was about 73 degrees. There was the slightest occasional breeze, and everything was still dry when I cam in from that part of the session. Transparency seemed inline with the forecast, and seeing was definitely better than the previous night.\n\nThe Planets\n\nAs I finished the lunar session, took the ASI178 off of the Meade and put the ASI290 back on the telescope. I also made sure that camera and filter wheel connected to the computer, and I verified that the filter wheel was actually turning in response to me pressing the Skittles. I also made sure that I remembered how to set up filters for RGB autoruns. I am glad that I did bang that bit of rust off before I was ready to start imaging.\n\nMy plan was to shoot everything as soon as it became available. Saturn would be out of the trees first, and very close to the meridian at 0115. Jupiter would be next at 0210. It would be a couple of hours before the meridian, but the GRS would be more favorably positioned at the tree line. And Mars brings up the rear at about 0400. It is very highly elevated, but it would be 8” in apparent diameter. I didn’t know if I would be able to make it that long.\n\nGetting Saturn onto the display took a little work because I was rusty at this process – maybe 10 minutes to relearn. It only took me a couple of minutes to dial in a good gain/exp combination for each of the RGB filters. After doing a manually advancing through the filters for a 30s run on each, I turn on Use RGB and let FC automatically run through the filters. That worked great, so I opened up Autorun, and set that up for maybe three runs. And finally I went to L and did a massively over exposed 30s run to see which satellites I could pick up. As was my practice last year, I manually guided. After truing my polar alignment up the night before, was able to stay within a reasonably small ROI box with little difficulty. Total capture on Saturn was 14 Gb.\n\nJust as I finished on Saturn, Jupiter was about to come out of the trees. I slewed to it and was able to wrangle it onto the display in just a couple of seconds. I did a couples of Autoruns – 3, 5, and 10 – using variously sized ROI boxes. I was getting about 100fps at one point. I also did a run with Europa and Io in the frame. I finished up by doing a massively overexposed 30s run to see if I can pull out any other satellites. Total capture on Jupiter was 110 Gb.\n\nAfter an hour’s break, I went back out to meet Mars as it came out of the trees. Just like with Jupiter, I was able to get Mars onto the display within a couple of seconds. The seeing seemed much worse while shooting Mars than it did for Saturn and Jupiter. This could have been an actual deterioration in seeing, or it could have been because was zoomed in on a much smaller ROI box. I manually walked through each of the RGB filters, then I used Autorun for three sets of RGB. After that I did an Autorun for three sets of iRGB. And finally, I did an over exposed run to see if I could pick out any satellites. I was seeing 500+ fps in R and iR, and 2-300 fps in G and B. I captured 10 Gb on Mars.\n\nThe temperature had actually warmed up a little from the time that I had went out to work on the moon. There was light dew on a few things, but my front glass stayed clear with a low dew controller setting.\n\nGeneral\n\nWhile dust plagues me no worse than any other astronomer, I find it frustrating that no matter how carefully that I clean optics, there is always dust that shows up in my images. I may have stumbled onto something. I shined my headlamp down the front of my telescope so that I could see the filters cycle through the field of view whenever I pressed a Skittle. With the bright light shining down the front of the telescope, I could see every speck of dust in the universe on the display. So, I am going to try checking my optics with a flashlight and a telescope the next time that I clean optics.\n\nThe session on the planets went so well that I am inclined so see if I can my Firecapture’s autoguiding work for me. Also regarding the planets, with Mars being so small, and with seeing being so good while shooting the planets, the 5x PowerMate sounds like something to think about.\n\nI left the dew shield off and used just a dew strap on the front of the scope so that I could check collimation. I completely forgot to do the collimation check.\n\nTotal capture for the session was about 285 Gb!\n\nMy objectives were to check Dec backlash after adjusting it last week, test the autofocuser position consistency, and get some experience with the IR temp gun and dew point indicator. I also wanted to take a south horizon cell phone image for comparison to my backyard horizon rendering in Stellarium, and gain some experience with the smartphone camera doing wide-field night sky shots. Progress was made on all objectives.\n\nAn overall observation\n\nAs tonight’s work was almost entirely dedicated to testing for the purpose of making improvements, I realized that since April I have been taking an informal Lean Six-Sigma approach to process improvement to get consistent and high-quality imaging results. Thank you NGA for the LSS class!\n\nAlso, as I am getting better and documenting my sessions, I am getting better at noticing more subtle connections. There is an example of this in the PHD guiding section where I noticed bi-directional Dec guiding adjustments and how that might related to the inability to measure backlash\n\nI have also noticed that the items that I fix, with the exception of RDT, stay fixed. My set up and automation is complex, but it does feel that I am making progress toward where I want to be.\n\nThe Astronomer\n\nI was very tired at the outset, and got a little chilly as the night wore on. I think that a chair nap would have helped, and I could have done that while clouds were rolling through. Chair naps seems to be a lesson that I refuse to learn. I was in bed by 0215. I tried to get up when Lisa did at 0700, but ended up going back to sleep until 0950.\n\nThe Clouds\n\nThe first cloud bank rolled in at 2200, but by then I had completed polar alignment and calibration, and had started on a Guiding Assistant run. I went inside and came back out 45 minutes later, and the clouds were gone. I completed a Guiding Assistant run, and started on the autofocuser/filter test. Another bank of clouds came through, but I stuck with the test and got enough information to reach a conclusion. The sky was completely clear when I ended the session at 0130.\n\nEquipment\n\nSetup, power up, and start up went extremely well. The equipment did everything that I asked of it, but testing revealed that I need to make some adjustments in what I am asking of it.\n\nPHD2/Backlash test\n\nThe backlash test is a part of my usual PHD2 start up, and is done in calibration and GA tool.\n\nIn calibration, the orthogonality error was 6.7 degrees and the graph had a slight S-curve for the Dec leg, probably due to backlash. The orthogonality error was about the same as last time,, but the results graph looked a lot better than before. The orthogonality error makes me wonder if there is another problem causing that error, but for the time being, I want to get backlash squared away before chasing that problem.\n\nIn the GA tool, I was able to see that the polar alignment error was 2.7’. The backlash measurement failed (like last time) because PHD could not detect a consistent south response., so I still do not have a measurement in ms. The results graph looks a lot better. Before, the leg that was supposed to slope downward at 45 degrees was horizontal, which is consistent with no consistent south response. This time, there was some downward curvature, which is a slight improvement. Thinking about this today, the Dec drift was southward and the slope was pretty steep. Maybe tightening up the worm gear adjustment will help, but maybe I should try using PHD Drift Alignment Tool to decrease the Dec drift.\n\nWhile monitoring the guiding graph after the GA run, I noticed that PHD2 was issuing both north and south guiding nudges. While monitoring the graph during the GA run, I noticed that the Dec drift was south. As this is a function of polar alignment error the Dec drift can be in only one direction, and since the drift is south, the Dec\n\nguide commands should only be northward.\n\nAfter the GA run, the Ra/Dec/Tot guiding RMS was 1.37’/.57’/1.59”, which is worse than I have been getting lately. After changing the guiding algorithm from Auto to North Only, the Ra/Dec/Tot RMS improved to .78’/.49’/.90’. This is a dramatic improvement, but thinking about it as I write this up, it seems that going to North Only would have affected the Dec RMS, but it was the Ra (and total RMS) that improved dramatically.\n\nTo-do Items related to Guiding:\n\nTighten up the worm gear adjustment a little more and see what happens next time.\n\nAdd a DSO Workplan Step to check for N and S guiding on the Dec axis, and to reduce Dec drift with the PHD2 Drift Alignment Tool\n\nInvestigate Ra guiding improvement as a result of going to North only guiding on Dec axis\n\nAutoFocus/Filter Test\n\nThe reason for designing this test was to investigate the appearance of a highly bloated guide star in PHD2 well into my last few sessions. My hypothesis was: Since the main camera and the guide camera move in unison as the focuser is racked in or out, maybe the focus position from an autofocus run was different from filter to filter, or maybe autofocus was not consistent for the same filter.\n\nThe test that I designed to evaluate this was to set up a sequence in NINA that would autofocus on a filter, do a 10s exposure on that filter, and repeat for the next filter. After cycling through RG&B, the RGB sequence was to repeat RGB ten times.\n\nMy expectation was that every time the same filter came around, the autofocus position for that filter would be very close the same for each measurement, an maybe the autofocus positions for the RG and B filters would all be close enough to use one focus position for all three filters.\n\nWhat I found was that there was no consistency in focuser position for any filter. The results could very by 20 steps for the same filter. This could account for star bloat in PHD2.\n\nI have found a CN post that addresses settings that will improve this. I will read, adjust the settings, and re-run this test.\n\nNight Sky Imaging with the Smart Phone\n\nI mounted the smart phone on a regular camera tripod using the $10 adapter that I bought for the backyard horizon panorama. Some exposures appeared to be a single image, whereas other exposures clouds could be seen moving across the FoV. Not sure why the difference, but worth investigating.\n\nThe moon tracked higher across the trees than Stellarium had projected, which seem so suggest that something needs to be adjusted. It could be that my accuracy expectations are completely unrealistic.\n\nI would like to experiment with the smartphone and the adapter on the wind up star tracker that I used for Three Comets.\n\nObjective Lens Dew Monitoring\n\nI set the dew controller to 33% at sunset, and left it there for the rest of the night, and periodically monitored the air temperature, lens temperature, dew point, and relative humidity. I also noted if there was dew on surfaces (like my metal table) or on the lens. Ideally, I would have had a control lens that was unheated so that I could really know if my heating approach was successful. Also, this is just one night’s observations with just one telescope.\n\nOne difficulty was the impact on the imaging sequence. I had to stop the sequence before pointing a laser dot down the front of the telescope. It seemed worth it time impact. I expect that as I gain enough experience that at some point I may no longer need to monitor the lens temperature\n\nHere are the raw numbers:\n\nLooking at the data, I have made some observations\n\nDew did not appear on other surfaces until the RH jumped up into the high 90s.\n\nThe lens temperature consistently stayed about 5 degrees warmer than the air temp.\n\nThe air temperature and the dew point in the backyard weather station began running parallel at 2300, converged at midnight and remained converged for the balance of the night. This is consistent with the observations that I recorded.\n\nFrom these observations I have drawn some conclusions.\n\n33% dew controller heat kept the dew off the scope all night, but future monitoring is necessary\n\nMaybe the RH% is a good metric to monitor for knowing when to crank up the controller.\n\nTodo Item: Add wind speed and direction to the observations that I collect.\n\nWhere to go from here.\n\nThe Astrosphereic forecast for tonight is for better cloud cover, transparency and seeing than last night, but the nearly Full Moon dominates the sky. It is still a good night to get some useful work done, so I am planning to work at the scope again tonight. I think that my prep time today will be best spent on the updates to my work plan that could give me a better dec backlash result, so I want to try this before I actually adjust the backlash. I also want to read and tweak AF settings before I repeat the filter/autofocus test.\n\nI will work off of last night’s polar alignment, I and can probably get through the PHD start up calibration and GA run pretty quickly. Once that is done, I can load and initiate the NINA sequence, which takes a quite a while to complete, but it runs autonomously. I am available to work with you and the CG5 if you want to come over. I can monitor both scopes for dew.\n\nMy objective tonight was a pre-Farm practice session so that I might have the opportunity to discover and correct problems before going to a dark sky site.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI changed my target from Crescent Nebula to Sadr, which is a star located at the intersection of Cygnus’ wings and fuselage (sic). It is situated in an interesting and dense Milky Way star field. It lies less than a sensor frame to the east of Crescent Nebula. I may do a multi night collection on this target, but I think that ultimately it will be a better narrowband target.\n\nSetup:\n\nI had taken the TV of off the mount right after the last session so that I could attend to a todo list item, which I got taken care of yesterday. I started setting up at 1935. After putting the scope back on the mount, I added the camera, and made power and data connections. Initial power up was complete by 1955, and I was waiting for the sky to get dark enough to polar align. All activities here went smoothly.\n\nWhen I returned to the scope at 2115, the temperature was 70F and the dew point was 68F. There was no discernable surface wind, and there was some dew on metal surfaces. Later, a slight breeze picked up and the dew went away. The sky was completely clear. The forecast was for the temp and dew point to stay separated by about 10F all night. Tracking together but at a greater separation than usual was new to me, so I didn’t know if that would mean a dewy night. Astrospheric forecasted 0% cloud cover, above average transparency, and below average seeing.\n\nThe sky was dark enough for me to acquire Polaris at 2122, and I was able to complete polar alignment in one iteration by 2227. Polaris was just inside of the alignment circle at the end of the procedure, and it needed very slight adjustments in El and Az to center it up.\n\nI began the initial focus at 2127. The focus position was pretty good when I checked with the Bahtinov mask as the position was not perturbed from the previous session. I initiated an auto focus run, that showed a R squared value of slightly less than 1 (I am used to getting perfect 1s lately) and finished up by focusing the guide camera at 2147.\n\nPHD2 calibration began at 2147, and it went smoothly. The orthogonality was off by only 6.5 degrees, and the chart looked pretty good. Initial guiding was Ra/Dec/Tot of .94”/.38”/1.03”.\n\nThe Guiding Assistant tool ran from 2154 to 2207. It found that the polar alignment error was only 1.6’ – the best I’ve seen yet. The backlash measurement failed because the mount never established consistent south moves. The chart was horrible. The south leg of the chart was horizontal instead of the nominal 45d downward slope. Guiding Ra/Dec/Tot afterward were 1.03”/.68”/1.19”\n\nWith the minor exception of the R squared < 1, everything up to this point was as good as the results that I have been getting lately.\n\nAt 2207, I started target acquisition, using the NINA manual rotator. I don’t think that it will work with my setup because the sensor and OAG cannot rotate independently. The only rotatable point is the focuser body, and since it is forward of the OAG, the rotation ruined the calibration. After manually rotating to get approximately the 45 degrees that I wanted, I initiated another calibration run. The dec leg of the chart was extremely bowed away from the ideal path. Guiding Ra/Dec/Tot were .66”/.79”/1.08”, so I accepted the calibration and moved on by slewing to the target. Since Sadr does not have an image in the framing data base, I elected to slew to it using coordinates in the Gemini hand controller. I had Stellarium connected, and in retrospect I wish that I had used it to command the slew to the target because that would have been easier. Sadr landed exactly where I wanted it within the frame.\n\nLights\n\nThe imaging sequence was: slew to target, center target, start guiding, start imaging (RG&B: 20 x 120s, L: 140 x 60s)\n\nI initiated the imaging run at 2233, just four minutes before end of astronomical twilight. The plate solver needed a slight adjustment and the autofocus ran flawlessly. I noticed as the first image started that I had set the exposure duration to 480s, the number that I was using for farm planning purposes. I aborted the run, and reset the exposure duration to 120s, which is more appropriate for the R filter in the local Bortle 6 sky. I had to reinitiate the exposure sequence which drove a time impact of another plate solve and autofocus. The first image was downloaded by 2250, and although it was a single roughly stretched image, it looked pretty interesting. The Ra/Dec/Tot guiding were .94”/.68”/.99”\n\n0240 Checkup: Temp was 61F and dew point was 51F. There was no dew on metal surfaces. Unable to re-establish RDT except through Ethernet cable. Sadr was nearly on the meridian, so I stopped the sequence and initiated a meridian flip with the hand controller. I used the hand controller and Ra/Dec coordinates to return to Sadr. NINA executed a plate solve and autofocus without difficulty after I resumed the sequence. I think that I am ready to implement flips in NINA. Guide star FWHM had bloated to 7. I need to study this more closely to determine what is going on. Guiding was pretty good after the flip. Ra/Dec/Tot were .54”/.66”/.85”. The L sequence line was executing. Subs 57 through 61 could have been affected by the flip. Sequence ends at 0420.\n\n0415 Checkup: Although the image session was set for 140 L subs, I cut it off at 100 at 0425. Guiding Ra/Dec/Tot were .74”/.43”/.86”. I noticed that post-dither PHD settle time seemed long, but I could not find a setting in PHD or NINA. Temp and dew point were 60F and 50F, and there was no dew on metal surfaces. There was no discernable surface breeze. The sky was completely clear.\n\nFlats\n\nStarted Flats capture of 30 subs/filter at 0425 and finished at 0505 (25 minutes). Exposures ranged from 3 to 9s. I changed each filter’s max and min exposures to 1s and 3s respectively to shorten them even more next time. I think that I can force that range for all filters with brightness adjustments and removing card stock sheets if needed.\n\nDark Flats capture of 50 subs/filter began at 0506 and lasted until 0550 (44 minutes). It was getting pretty light by then so there is some worry about light leak.\n\nWrap up\n\nMy attempt to use the rotator cost some time, but that’s ok. I was really intrigued by the possibility of being able to get the exact same sensor rotation when collecting data on the same target over multiple nights, and I was disappointed that it doesn’t appear possible on my equipment, but I do want to explore other ways to handle rotation. Thinking about it afterward, it seems easy enough to rotate the camera to where I want it when I install the camera. I can use a piece of tape to mark the rotational alignment if I plan to collect more data on that target on another night.\n\nAfter keeping my head in the work plan up to Polar alignment, I got away from it once I reached that point. Having the discipline checking my activities against the plan would have avoided the Stellarium error. It is not as easy to see the plan in the dark, but it is not that hard either. Also, I wasn’t careful enough when adjusting the exposure duration numbers that I plan to use at the farm for use at home.\n\nLater auto focus runs had better R squared numbers. Focus positions sometimes were consistent and sometimes changed a pretty good bit. This is something that I will monitor.\n\nRDT connects easily, but the connection is periodically interrupted. Reconnect happened quickly and without trouble through initiation of the image sequence. Checkups that came later checks required the Ethernet cable.\n\nThe Dark Flats were ruined by light leaks, but I can recover by reshooting these in the dark box. Going forward it will be better to begin the Dark Flats earlier/while it is darker. I must begin the Flats earlier than I did this morning (0425), and I need to limit them to 5s so that both the Flats and Flat Darks finish while it is still dark. Also, I left the Flat light panel on top of the telescope, switched off, when covering it for the Dark Flats instead of screwing the cover back on.\n\nTodo List\n\nResearch workarounds for rotating the ASI6200 independently from the larger/M66-threaded OAG.\n\nInvestigate increase in guiding FWHM\n\nConsider automating meridian flips in NINA\n\nMonitor guide star FWHM bloat\n\nTest for autofocus offsets across the LRGB filter set.\n\nInspect L frames #57 through #61\n\nProcess and archive data\n\nCheck chair rivets\n\nLook for post-dither settle time setting.\n\nRe-shoot Dark Flats\n\nUpdate the work plan to reflect getting an earlier start on Flats/Dark Flats, shorter sub exposures, and screwing on the front cover.\n\nWith Astrospheric indicating that the transparency would be great, even though the seeing would be poor, I thought that it would be a good opportunity to work with the telescope and camera to tune skills and equipment tonight, and maybe even accomplish the dress rehearsal that I want to do before going to the farm.\n\nStart Up:\n\nThe NP101 was already on the G11. At 1800 I added the ASI6200 and connected power to everything and was ready for darkness in just a few minutes. Even though the Sun was shining brightly, the wind made it feel uncomfortably chilly.\n\nAs I wanted to make this my full dress rehearsal, I used batteries were my only power source, and I had hoped to rely strictly upon the field router’s wifi, or Ethernet at worst.\n\nI went out to power up, start software, and connect software to devices at 2052. The wind had calmed way down with only an occasional slight breeze discernable. Temperature was 68F and dew point was 44F. The wind and the temp-dew point spread suggest that there will be no dew. Astrospheric is projecting 0% cloud cover, above average transparency, and poor seeing.\n\nAt power up I encountered expected problems with RDT, which is already on my to-do list. I have been working on the list but I haven’t gotten to RDT yet. Last night it would connect to either the home wifi or the field nano router, but if Ethernet cable was connected. It would not connect to either wifi network without the Ethernet cable, nor would it connect via the Ethernet cable alone. As the farm is potentially just a week away, this item needs to float to the top of my priorities. All other powerup activities went smoothly.\n\nPolar alignment took nearly 15 minutes, which was a little more time than usual. I did a second run and got a different result from the first run.. Not being happy with that outcome I did a third run, which yielded a different result from the second run. I tried a fourth and accepted that result as the 3rd and 4th were the same.\n\nAfter polar alignment, I did my initial focus while still on the NCP region. Polaris is a nice bright star for initial focus with the Bahtinov mask. I was able to see nice bright spikes with just .5s exposures. Focus of the main and guide cameras went smoothly.\n\nBefore leaving the NCP region, I did test exposures. I settled on 60s for L, and using the G filter as a proxy for all three color filters I came up with 180s.\n\nPHD2 Calibration and GA run went well. In calibration, orthogonality was off, but the curved plot for one leg of the graph seemed to suggest that it is off due to backlash. Guiding RMS after calibration was .78”, .32”, and .92” for Ra, Dec, and Tot, respectively. GA reported PAE of 4.2’ and that a backlash was 2830ms. I would like to see the backlash come down some more. After the GA run, RMS errors were worse at 1.46”, 1.32”, and 1.92” for Ra, Dec, and Tot, respectively. These errors are approximately the TV/6200 image scale, so the guiding result shouldn’t be too bad. The wind had picked up and could have contributed to the increased RMS error.\n\nLights Capture\n\nI initiated the imaging sequence just before the end of astronomical twilight. From the equator-meridian position, NINA slewed to the target, plate solved and centered on the target, and initiated an auto focus run. All of this executed almost flawlessly. A slight problem was that I left the G filter in place after doing the exposure test, and this was the filter that was used for the first auto focus run. The first exposure line in the exposure sequence called for an L filter, and the filter change from G to L drove a second autofocus run immediately after the first one. Since everything was otherwise going smoothly, I let the second run continue, but I made a note to put a step in my work plan to cycle back to the L filter after doing exposure tests.\n\nThe imaging sequence was L: 15 x 60s, R, G and B: 15 x 180s. Gain 100. Dither on.\n\nThe back to back autofocus runs made me start thinking more deeply about filters and focus. I have read that many times filters in less expensive sets will require slightly different drawtube positions to be in focus. Now that I have an L and color filters by different makers, and now that I am getting highly reliable autofocus runs, I think that I can measure the offsets between filters and include that in the exposure sequence.\n\nGuiding RMS improved after slewing to M101, which at this time was about 70 degrees elevated. I was getting .65”, .40”, and .75” for Ra, Dec, and Total RMS, respectively. I believe that the guiding improved because the angular tracking speed needed near the equator is higher than the angular tracking speed needed at higher declinations. After thinking about this for a moment, I etired to the house at 2240\n\n2325 Checkup: It was 63F and pretty breezy when I went out to check on things at 2330. I was chilly with a light jacket on. Still on the first 33AH battery with 12.3V remaining. No danger of mount crash or cable snag. Images are coming in with round stars. Still getting about .72” total RMS guiding!!!!!!\n\n0015 Checkup: 61F. Still on first battery, which is at 12.1V. Wind has died down. Total RMS is up to .85”, which seems reasonable now the target has descended to 54 degrees elevation.\n\n0150 Checkup: Still on first battery which is at 11.9V. Wind died down. It was 57F. The last frame was being exposed. I noticed that the PHD FWHM was nearly 7. I was able to refocus id down to 4.5. Guiding was Ra: .81”, Dec: .70”, and Tot: 1.04”. The target was 44 degrees elevation\n\nFlats Capture\n\nThis was my first attempt at a full Flats capture – 30 Light frames and 30 matched Dark frames for each filter. Set up (20 min) and capture were about 1.5 hours. Much longer than I expected. The filter times were L: 5.25s, R:10.99s, G: 28.11s, and B 5.75s. This was with the bare panel on low, and I had to insert 2 sheets of card stock for the colored filters. This doesn’t seem to make sense. There may be ways to reset the way the Flat Wizard finds exposure times to reduce the 10s and 28s exposures. I have some work to do here.\n\nThe NINA Flat Wizard is convenient in that once it is set up properly it will cycle through whichever filters that I designate on its own. I am prompted to cover the scope after the last set of Flats is captured, and then it starts capturing Dark Flats.\n\nLooking at the Flats during capture, the L, R, and G images looked weird. The B images looked as I expected\n\nI swapped batteries while the Dark Flats were being captured. The “old” battery was 11.8v\n\nThe scope, which sits forward in its rings, slipped downward in the rings when I pointed the scope to the vertical and put the Flats panel on top/front of the scope.\n\nWrap up\n\nThat guiding is better nearer the NCP than the equator is not surprising as the angular movement is faster near the equator and slower near the NCP. I need to keep this in mind until I can improve the mounts performance, and as I begin to work with the Meade.\n\nI have to think about the guide camera being so far out of focus at the end of the session. It seems that as the main camera was periodically refocused the guide camera would also remain in focus. It also seems possible that if different filters come to focus on the main camera sensor at different draw tube extension distances then it might impossible for the guide camera to remain in focus across all filters.\n\nNot that I was trying, but coincidentally the first image was snapped right at the end of astronomical twilight. Any earlier the sky would have been too bright, and later would have meant lost time that I could have been capturing. Getting past polar alignment, initial focus, and test exposures by the end of twilight will be a goal going forward.\n\nThe dew heater was off all night, and there was no dew on metal surfaces by the end of the session. In retrospect, I wish that I had turned it on to assess the impact on the batteries.\n\nThe Samsung laptop battery was at 40% at the end of the session. I had it open and running more way than absolutely needed as I am still in the learning phase and watching everything very closely.\n\nEven though the wifi router kept this session from being exactly as I hope to operate in the field, I was still able to have a very good imaging session. I would not have been disappointed if this had happened at the farm.\n\nThis is a big report, but I have two big take aways: First, poor seeing nights are certainly just fine for tuning equipment and skills. It remains to be seen how the data look, so I don’t know if a poor seeing night is good for short focal length DSO work. I know that this condition does not work for long focal length planetary work. Also, as a result of being more disciplined about writing things down, I think that I am still paying closer attention to more details that might not have been noticed, or that would have been soon forgotten. I still am not anywhere near where I want to be with respect to DSO imaging, but I feel like I am getting there.\n\nTo-do List:\n\nMake RDT a higher priority\n\nCheck for Windows updates on the mini computer\n\nAdjust Dec backlash after New Moon period\n\nMeasure filter offsets\n\nAdd longer range items (Like Gemini Lvl 6 upgrade this winter) to to-do list as the come to mind for tracking\n\nResearch how others are taking Flats with an eye toward reducing the amount of time it takes to set up and capture. Read about Dynamic Exposure in the Flat Wizard\n\nPut one wrap of friction tape around the OTA where the rings are clamped on\n\nCapture Bias frames\n\nSeeing how the Flat exposure times varied by filter, I need to do test exposures for each filter.\n\nUpdate NINA on the mini computer\n\nProcess images\n\nThe objective of this session was to attempt guiding with the Meade LX850 (12″ f/8) on the G11 mount. The session did not go too well.\n\nI had a better result with the Pronto last night than I did with the OAG the night before. Even so, there are plenty of problems to work through before I can claim success, and I hold open the possibility that I might not ever be able to do guided DSO imaging with the G11/Meade. It also occurs to me that I can usually break through what may at first appear to be an insurmountable problem if I keep chipping away at it. This will be a tough one!\n\nThe Meade with the ASI6200 were already on the G11 from the night before. I added the Pronto as a guide scope and moved the guide camera from the OAG to the Pronto. I had planned to move it back to the OAG and re-test that configuration. My present thinking is that I will make some adjustments and try the Pronto again for at least one more session, and that I will try the OAG again to see if I get a better result with better sky conditions than I had when I used it on 2022-06-04.\n\nI went out the to scope to begin powering up and connecting software to equipment at 2105. The temperature and dew point were 66F and 53F, respectively. The air was still, and the sky was clear. A 33% illuminated moon was in the west. Astrospheric forecast was for Below Average transparency and Average seeing.\n\nFocusing both scopes took 45 minutes, which was way too long. Focusing the main scope with the 6200 and the Bahtinov mask took longer because I had to work out the technique for this setup. All of the stars in the Meade FoV were rather dim, so it was hard to read the mask spikes due to the Meade’s f/8 slower speed. I overcame that by upping the exposure time on the camera, which added more time to the process. Next time I will try nudging the scope around to find a brighter star. On the guide camera, I had trouble finding focus, and ended up needing a longer extension. Also, there were halos surrounding the stars when focused to the lowest FWHM number and I could go a little higher than that FWHM and see pin-point stars. Not sure which position is the best to use. There was no moisture on the objective, but maybe I need to clean it. Even starting from an unknown focus position next time, I can complete this activity much more quickly.\n\nAfter focusing I ran though a guiding assessment. My approach was to go through the process without making adjustments to get a baseline result, to include image results, afterward.\n\nI slewed to meridian-equator for calibration. PHD reported the result as suspect. I examined the orthogonality graph and found that it was close, and there were maybe three plots that were out of line. Not having any idea what the issue was, I decided to proceed.\n\nInitial guiding RMS was Ra 1.19”, Dec .62” and Tot 1.28. This was not a bad starting point compared to what I got with the TV on the mount, but it was at times much worse. With the Meade/6200 image scale, I’d like to see a total RMS of about .5” with Ra and Dec values being about equal. That’s going to be tough!\n\nNext I ran the Guiding Assistant tool. After a 3-minute run, I was seeing a polar alignment error of 36.4’ (yes, minutes). I don’t think that it was actually that far off, but I did not recheck with PoleMaster. The backlash measurement failed, because the mount did not consistently respond to south guiding commands. After accepting the GA tool recommendations, the guiding RMS was Ra 2.76”, Dec 1.31” and Tot 3.02”.\n\nI noticed a curious pattern in the PHD2 scatter graph. There were two groups of plots. A small number of plots was located in a rather linear formation just below the Y axis between the X axis and the outer circle. The majority of the plots were in a decently tight circular formation located completely outside of the circle at about the 7 o’clock position. I am not sure what to make of the two groupings or of the main one being so far from the center.\n\nFor imaging, I let NINA handle the slew to and center on M13.\n\nI believe that the initial slew is based on Ra/Dec coordinates that are passed to the mount. Then plate solving engages to center the target, and in this case it failed. The target ended up slightly off center, but it was good enough for my purposes. I suspect that ASTAP (plate solver) did not have correct parameters for the Meade/6200.\n\nI set up and ran a sequence for 60s on the L filter, and 120S each on the RGB filters. The first images were completely horrible from a guiding perspective, and later they cleaned up a good bit. I noticed at the end that 60s on L and 120s on the colors did not move the histogram completely out of the noise. While these exposure values worked well with the TV at f/5.4, they were completely inadequate for the Meade at f/8. Experimentation is needed, but I suspect that 3x longer exposures.\n\nWhen I ended the session, the temperature was 60F and the dew point was 52F. There was dew on the grass but not on the metal surfaces. The sky was clear and there was no breeze, and by my estimation met the Astrospheric seeing forecast. I wore a light jacket but was a little chilly by the end.\n\nAfter thoughts:\n\nOne possible (probable?) guiding problem is the weight on the mount. I see two prevalent points of view in Cloudy Nights. First is that the 12” LX850 is near the G11’s max capacity, and that imaging is best done at about half of a mount’s max capacity. In my case, it gets worse as I add the electronic focuser, five pounds of imaging package, and supporting accessories. Another point of view is that the G11 can handle it. For the time being, I’m going to assume that the G11 can handle it, and that its up to me to figure out how to help the G11 guide with some extra weight.\n\nI also see to CN points of view on guide scope vs. OAG, and most come down on the side of OAG as the best guiding performer. It is too early to rule out OAG!\n\nThis morning I have thought of three more things to try. First is to make sure that I am balance with an east bias. That went through my mind last night, but I was so freaked out by the amount of counterweight on the bar (59 lbs) that I dare not touch it. I really need to touch it. Perhaps pre-setting it to east bias in the day light will help me get past that. Next, I will re-test the OAG with better sky conditions, probably in a separate session after I am through working with the Pronto. And finally, if it turns out that using a guide scope is going to be the best solution, then"
