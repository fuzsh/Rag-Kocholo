        "text": "In our previous post, The Budget-Savvy Bride…Part I: http://stpucchi.com/blog-1/2019/4/2/the-budget-savvy-bridepart-i we delved into Online Purchases and what to look out for.\n\nToday we will talk about Samples and Clearance Sales:\n\nMost bridal salons and designer websites have sample and clearance sales to make room for new merchandise as well as to get rid of discontinued styles due to lack of space and changing demands. This is your chance to purchase a fabulous gown sans the hefty price.\n\nSince wedding dresses are sized differently compared to ready-to-wear clothing, make sure you know where you are on the size chart prior to purchasing your sale gown, as most sales are final.\n\nIn most cases, though, the store may not have the size or the color you need. Floor samples in stores are usually smaller in size and have been tried on by several brides-to-be, so expect some wear and tear.\n\nA sale is only good if you are flexible and willing to settle for whatever you can get. Most stores do not disclose which styles and sizes they will be offering for sale. Also, don’t expect to find the current year and season’s models, as they would not be among the sale items.\n\nCall the stores where you found some styles you liked to see if and when they will be having their sale. Plan in advance so you don’t get caught up in the mayhem, as it can get quite chaotic as other brides are also there searching for their dream gown at a bargain price. Some stores require an appointment, so do your homework.\n\nHere are ten steps you can take to pick the right dress with minimum hassle:\n\n1. Visit the bridal salons in advance to find out what choices are being offered. Try on several dresses and shortlist a few that you love.\n\n2. Note the dress model numbers and sizes so that you reach them first on the day of the sale.\n\n3. Get your friends to pitch in and help to scout out the potential gowns faster by showing them pictures of styles you are looking for.\n\n4. Dressing rooms can be rushed and chaotic during sales, so don’t expect to spend too much time trying on one gown after another.\n\n5. Be ready to make a quick decision and get ready to make your purchase there and then.\n\n6. Expect that this is a final sale.\n\n7. In the event that the dress is not in your size, ask the store if they offer alterations and the costs involved.\n\n8. Make an appointment to bring the dress back for alterations and fittings.\n\n9. If your sample gown is soiled from dirt and sweat from having been tried on, then you may need to get it cleaned. Ask the store for their recommendations.\n\n10. Factor in alteration and cleaning costs and make sure you are within your budget.\n\nUnfortunately, if you have only a single style in mind, then your chances are not so good and a sale is not the answer to finding the dress of your dreams.\n\n*Above is an excerpt from the #1 International Bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams\n\nBelow are a few of styles offered exclusively via our website www.stpucchi.com. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to style@stpucchi.com and our expert stylist will be happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nMaybe the thought of spending more than two months’pay on a wedding dress never even occurred to you when you accepted the ring.\n\nJust a few short years ago, finding a beautiful and elegant wedding dress would have required an all-hands-on-deck manhunt and a considerable amount of spare time and some change. Not so today. And seeing that time and money are very precious commodities, luxuries not everyone can afford, there are quite a few options for you to consider when looking for an incredibly memorable wedding dress.\n\nWhether you’re looking for an unfussy gown for your beach wedding, trying to find a lace-adorned midi dress to wear to City Hall, or you’re going all out but still want something spectacular, there are so many options for you today to realize your dream.\n\nIn this first part of the series we will explore one of the three options that are available to you…\n\nONLINE PURCHASE:\n\nLike the rest of the fashion industry, the bridal world, too, is experiencing change. Many reputable designers have adopted the digital trend and are now offering their designs online.\n\nCan you really get a wedding gown delivered to your doorstep? Yes, absolutely.\n\nFor many brides, the ability to purchase designer gowns in this most effortless way is a dream come true. Often the prices offered online are considerably lower than the dresses sold in stores due to lower overhead costs to designers, which affords savings to you, the bride.\n\nOne thing to bear in mind is that some online bridal stores offer a try-on option, while others do not. If it is a brand that you are familiar with and which has a good reputation, then there should be no need to worry. Do your homework and check the seller’s policies and procedures.\n\nToday, an ocean of choices has become available online, which can often overwhelm and cause confusion.\n\nHere are ten steps you can take to make your choice easier:\n\n1. Make a list of the features you wish for in a dress that would look good on your body type such as silhouette, neckline, sleeves, and fabric. Also list what you would like to avoid (I have laid this out clearly in my book, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams. Read Chapter 5: Lines That Flatter: Choosing a Style for Your Figure, and Chapter 6: Wedding Dress Silhouettes).\n\n2. Filter by price to make sure you’re staying within your dress budget.\n\n3. Pick out a number of gowns that fit the aforementioned criteria.\n\n4. Pin these on your online inspiration board or print them out so you can lay them all out and compare them.\n\n5. Eliminate the dresses that do not match your needs.\n\n6. Pay attention to details on the chosen dresses: note the fabric, construction, and how it drapes on the model.\n\n7. Get help from those whose opinion you trust and make your decision.\n\n8. Check the manufacturer’s measurement chart and determine the optimal size.\n\n9. Place your order.\n\n10. Find a good seamstress who has experience working with complicated gowns. Once your dress arrives, you will more than likely need some alterations.\n\nHere are just a few of the dresses from our St. Pucchi Collections made available directly from our design house to you, the bride, at a fraction of the cost…Visit www.stpucchi.com for all available styles.\n\nHow about a bustle and a modesty piece?\n\nAside from obvious silhouettes such as A-line, sheath, column, ballgown—some details can make any bride seriously confused and frustrated.\n\nIf you would like to be well-versed, and have some answers at your fingertips, here are ten most commonly used terms to know ahead of your biggest shopping trip.\n\n1. Alençon lace: Originally produced by hand in Alençon, a town in Normandy, France, it is a light, airy needle lace made of linen thread. This is one of the most popular and traditional laces used on wedding dresses.\n\n2. Boning: Plastic or metal sewn into the bodice of the dress, especially a corset on a strapless wedding gown, to ensure the fit is snug and the fabric does not droop.\n\n3. Bustle: The art of pinning a train and securing it by using hidden hooks on the back of the dress so it does not drag around on the ground after the ceremony. There are several different ways to bustle. The French bustle is the most popular, whereby the train is tucked underneath and pinned or hooked to the fabric of the dress.\n\n4. Chantilly lace: Delicate lace that originates from the city of Chantilly in France. This is one of the more popular laces used on wedding dresses. It comes in small, detailed patterns and look best when worn sheer over the arms, back, and neckline.\n\n5. Court: Refers to a type of train that is short—generally three feet from the waist—and drags a few inches on the ground.\n\n6. Crêpe: Thin, soft fabric with a slightly wrinkled surface, ideally used on a draped wedding gown or one that is form-fitting and clings to the body. Great for a beach wedding.\n\n7. Dropped waist: A longer bodice attached to the skirt at the seam that falls below the natural waistline. Gives an illusion of a longer torso and looks best on taller women.\n\n8. Guipure lace: French bobbin lace, used on the bodice, skirt, or train of a wedding dress. It is heavier than Chantilly lace.\n\n9. Mermaid: One of the more popular skirt styles, where the bodice is fitted and then flares from under the hips in a mermaid-tail fashion.\n\n10. Modesty piece: A piece of fabric that is sewn into the middle of the neckline, especially a V-neck, to make it less revealing.\n\nArmed with this basic terminology you are now ready…\n\nShall we go shopping?\n\n*Above is an excerpt from designer Rani St. Pucchi’s #1 International Bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams\n\n___Order bridesmaids’ dresses\n\nAbove is an excerpt from the bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams\n\nFor more details and in-depth tasks pick up your copy here: goo.gl/96TnqT\n\nWatch the book trailer here: https://youtu.be/FEsuefkzIRs\n\nAnd visit www.stpucchi.com for St. Pucchi couture collections to find your dream dress!\n\nIn the following articles we will continue this conversation where I break down tasks that need to be accomplished as you plan ahead of your most important day:\n\na. 5-9 months prior\n\nb. 1-2 months prior\n\nc.

Worse still, if you happen to be a perfectionist, the stress level alone can soar off the charts! You soon realize how long your to-do list is, from shopping for your wedding dress and accessories to setting up the guest list, planning the wedding theme, and finding the venue.\n\nVery soon, you may find your own ideas slipping through the cracks as your well-meaning friends and relatives step in to “help” with their advice and recommendations. Isn’t it amazing how everyone wants to weigh in? Too many voices can cloud your vision. Eventually, it can take all the fun out of your wedding.\n\nTake heart. You can manage it all. Yes, you can!\n\nThere are hundreds of truths you know about yourself, so start by writing down everything that you love, everything that gives you joy. Close your eyes, and what do you see?\n\nWhat are your favorite colors, hues that you love?\n\nYour favorite foods?\n\nFlowers?\n\nHow about your favorite venue?\n\nDo you see a castle with crystal chandeliers and red roses?\n\nDo you see yourself in nature and dancing under the stars with your sweetheart?\n\nPerhaps at the beach?\n\nListen to what your heart is saying, trust it, and know that it will not steer you wrong.\n\nAs the process unfolds and you have all your ideas, plans, and inspirations on paper, you will find that you feel calm, collected, and confident.\n\nNow you know what you want and can start researching venues and vendors and planning your timelines.\n\nNow you can split the tasks—those you will personally handle and those you will delegate—and assign dates to each one of them during the various stages of wedding planning.\n\nNow you are better equipped to see the process through with great success and pride.\n\nHave fun as you go on this journey so that you are not scattered and stressed out.\n\nWith all that you will be doing, make sure to pause and take care of yourself. Wedding planning is important, yes, but what is more important is to occasionally stop whatever you’re doing, smile, dance, laugh, and spend quality time with your fiancé.\n\nNever allow the process to make you lose sight of the reason you’re doing this, nor the strength and depth of your love for each other. After all, you are creating memories. Make them good ones!”\n\n**Above is an excerpt from designer Rani St. Pucchi’s bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams\n\nWatch the book trailer here: https://youtu.be/FEsuefkzIRs\n\nAnd visit www.stpucchi.com for our couture collections to find your dream dress!\n\nHow excited you must be as you start thinking of your upcoming wedding! So much to do, so many decisions to make . . .\n\nPerhaps you are a little confused, somewhat overwhelmed. Fret not. I can help you get there. But first things first . . .\n\nYou will want to share the wonderful news with your most important family members and friends before the rest of the world finds out. People can be sensitive, especially if they find out secondhand about your big decision. This way, you’re showing them how much you care.\n\nThe days when everyone else discovered your big news via the announcement section in the Sunday edition of the local paper are behind us. Social media is most definitely the new platform. So, go ahead and share ring selfies and hashtags to communicate your new relationship status. Make sure to include your significant other when sharing your joy.\n\nNext, you may want to plan an engagement party. This is not mandatory—many couples today don’t have one at all. If you do, then plan on having it soon after you get engaged—ideally, within three months. Hopefully, by then, you have set a wedding date, as this is the first question everyone will certainly pose to you. An engagement party is a great way to gather together to celebrate and is especially nice to have if your families don’t know each other well so they can get better acquainted.\n\nThink of the engagement party as a kickoff to all the wedding events that will happen on your way to the altar. It can be as simple as having a cocktail party at your or someone’s home or as extravagant as renting a club or your favorite restaurant. The party is often hosted by one or both sets of parents, or if an aunt or a close friend wants to host the party, that’s fine too. Just don’t expect someone to host one for you. Engagement parties aren’t an obligation.\n\nUsually only family and close friends are invited to the engagement party, so don’t feel like you have to invite a ton of people. It’s totally fine to keep it intimate. Just make sure not to invite anyone who won’t be on the wedding guest list.\n\nYou may want to have a small registry ready since guests might want to give you an engagement present. Remember, though, that people are not obligated to bring gifts, so don’t be upset if guests arrive empty-handed.\n\nWhat you’ll wear depends on the formality of the event and the venue. If you are going formal, then an evening gown would be appropriate and help you stand out. Shorter dresses with interesting details, perhaps with lace trimmings, are a good choice for a casual outdoor affair.\n\nOne of the foremost concerns on the mind of most brides as they prepare for their wedding are questions such as:\n\nWhat do others expect of me?\n\nHow will I come across to my family and friends?\n\nWhat will they say?\n\nI find that a little sad, seeing that it is YOUR day.\n\nWhat about YOUR dreams?\n\nI’m sure you’ve waited for this day with anticipation and excitement. Should you not share with others what it is that you want? Involve your near and dear ones, those you’re closest to and who understand and support you, so that they share in your excitement and help you realize your vision for your day.\n\nWhat is it that you would like?\n\nWhere would you like to get married?\n\nWho would you like to invite?\n\nWhat would you like to wear?\n\nWhat décor, colors, music, …. have you envisioned for your day?\n\nWhat exactly does YOUR heart desire?\n\nIf you’re like most brides you can get swayed by others’ opinions and get caught up trying to please everyone. More often than not this leads to some resentment after the fact, perhaps even leaving you with feelings of regret that you didn't go with what you had envisioned, what you always longed for, what would make you happy..\n\nPlanning a wedding should be fun!\n\nDon't let anyone steal you of your moment, of the joy that is rightfully yours.\n\nBask in your love and love your journey.\n\nIn the next series of blogs I will share with you the different aspects of your wedding and the choices you have so you may pick what resonates most with you, and meets your heart’s greatest longing for your special day as you prepare to walk down the aisle to say “I Do”\n\nAfter all, the walk down the aisle is the moment of a lifetime - a moment to be treasured forever.\n\nFor a complete guide to planning your wedding, pick up the international bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Plan the Wedding of Your Dreams.\n\nHere’s the link: goo.gl/FDNwbF\n\nWatch the book trailer here: https://youtu.be/FEsuefkzIRs\n\nAnd visit www.stpucchi.com for our couture collections to find your dream dress!\n\nUntil next week…\n\n© Rani St. Pucchi, 2018\n\nRani St. Pucchi is an award-winning Couture Bridal Fashion Designer, Style & Image Consultant, and a Relationship Expert.

It also ensures that the gown does not drag around on the ground after the ceremony and get soiled. To accomplish this, the train can be pinned up and secured by hidden hooks on the back of the dress.\n\nA bustle is useful when the bride chooses a dress with a train. Many brides love the formality of a wedding gown with a long train, but it can be cumbersome at the reception.\n\nAll dresses with trains from the smallest sweep to the grandest cathedral can benefit from a proper bustle. Depending on the length of the train, a dress can be bustled by lifting and tucking the extra fabric underneath or over the skirt. Larger trains may need to be folded up using a system of hooks.\n\nA bustle is a unique and amazing creation that not only serves a practical purpose, but also adds tremendous style and interest to the bridal gown.\n\nThere are two basic types of bustles: the Traditional bustle, and the French bustle. Each look is a little different, but both serve the same purpose, and work well with all types of trains.\n\nTraditional bustle: Also known as the over-bustle, this type of bustle is recommended for gowns with waistlines. It is created by gathering up the train and securing it with buttons or hooks and loop attachments at points on the waistline or elsewhere on the back of the gown for a cascading effect.\n\nFrench bustle: Also known as the under-bustle, this is the most popular type of bustle and is appropriate for all types of gowns. It is more elaborate and can seem almost Victorian on many dresses. With the French bustle, the buttons and loops or ribbons are attached to the underside of the skirt and train so that the train is actually tucked underneath and pinned or hooked to the fabric of the dress that way.\n\nFor more ideas and advice on choosing the perfect dress for your body type, and on planning your dream wedding, pick up Rani’s #1 bestseller, Your Bridal Style, Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams.\n\nAll gowns shown are available for immediate purchase at www.stpucchi.com\n\n© Rani St. Pucchi, 2018\n\nRani St. Pucchi is an award-winning Couture Fashion Designer, a Style & Image Consultant, and a Relationship Expert.

Intense and enveloping, it will be impossible to resist this shade, just like it’s impossible to resist a chocolate praline. Use this as a sash or in your cake frosting. Or how about a chocolate cake?\n\nYellow: A vibrant, energizing tone, and a little wild too! Just think of paintings by Kandinsy or Matisse. Note that yellow’s comeback for 2018 is strictly connected to purple, its complementary color. Think yellow flowers such as Forsythia, Daffodil bulbs, double yellow Begonia.\n\nWhatever your choices are, whatever colors suit your fancy, don't hesitate!\n\nBe bold.

Her memoir, Unveiled: A Celebrity Fashion Designer’s Story will be released in 2019.\n\nFor more information on Rani please visit www.ranistpucchi.com\n\nMany a starry-eyed couple goes into marriage with their blinders on.\n\nThey’re in love and caught in a whirlwind of romance. They are confident beyond any doubt that they have made the absolute right choice. After all they have found the love of their life, their life partner, their soul mate – one with whom they will spend the rest of their life with - for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do they part…\n\nSome are indeed lucky to have found their forever love, and because they are committed their love withstands the test of time. Many, however, are not so fortunate.\n\nStatistics show that 50% of first time marriages in the Western world ends in divorce. That percentage jumps to a staggering 70% for second and third time marriages.\n\nWhy is that so? Well, for one thing we live in a world of instant gratification. Blame it on technology too if you will, contributing to each person’s lack of focus and leading to short and scattered attention span. It is becoming rare to find a couple completely invested in, and consciously working at, their marriage especially during times when it needs their loving attention and participation.\n\nSo, what is a couple to do to protect themselves? If divorce does enter into the equation the heartache will potentially mend over time, but the pocketbook may not survive. Finances may be drained in the process and take forever to recover. How is one to protect one’s life savings, assets, life’s work, so they can survive a failed marriage if, unfortunately, that does happen?\n\n‘Prevention is better than cure’ is not just an adage for the health of a person, but also the health of a marriage. It’s always better to protect what you have built over the years and step into a practical mode of thinking before tying the knot. Let the head rule over the heart before you embark on your journey just so you don't fall on hard times if divorce does enter into the equation down the road. Such is life, and such are the times we live in - sad but true.\n\nA Prenuptial Agreement may feel like an insult and sound negative to an experience that should be one filled with love and bliss, suggesting that either partner is not sure that their marriage will last.\n\nWhen one is in love, tending fences can be overlooked. However, since so many marriages\n\nend in separation or divorce today, having a prenuptial agreement in place is wise. Having a prenup doesn’t mean that your marriage will fail or that you don’t love each other. It just helps each partner keep what was originally his or hers in individual, separate accounts. This saves you from being embroiled in any lawsuits or held accountable for your spouse’s previous debts so that you don’t risk having to split your premarital assets in a divorce.\n\nA prenuptial agreement can also include provisions for division of property and spousal support in the event the marriage breaks up and ends in divorce, as well as further conditions of guardianship.\n\nConsult with your lawyer and make sure your prenup is watertight and spans the length of your marriage. Both sides must have legal representation for a prenup to be valid.\n\nGetting married involves legal expenses, ramification, and requirements. Those are the facts of life. So go into a marriage with an open mind along with a love-filled heart.\n\nYou will find a guide to some other legal practicalities that need to be in place before you tie the knot in Chapter 23 of Rani St. Pucchi’s #1 bestselling book, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams.

The corset lace starts either at the bottom or at the top and is zigzagged through the staggered holes on each side in a series of crossings.\n\nWe have also created double corset ties, where one starts from the top and another from the bottom and both meet and tie in the middle. Sometimes the vertically set bones are visible all around, but in most cases, the pockets with inserted bones/metal are built underneath the outer shell so as not to be visible.\n\nOpen corsets are either laced up at the center front or fastened at the center front with a number of hooks and eyes, sometimes with as much as eighteen to twenty-four pairs.\n\nA corset can be either fully boned or half-boned, depending on the style, with as much rigidity as the support the design calls for. Whalebone bodices with a different number of bones or stays are added around the sides of the corset. The direction of the bones is also important, as they help to shape the figure and narrow the waist.\n\nMany brides tend to wear boned corsets or “stays,” also called girdles or long-line bras, as the foundation garment under their bridal gown since it is easier to fit the dress over a firm foundation, and it also contributes to an erect posture. For brides wearing figure-hugging slim silhouettes, the right form-fitting all-in-one foundation that offers smooth, supple control from the bust through the thighs can make all the difference for a smooth fit into sheath dresses.”\n\nAbove excerpt was taken from Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams by Rani St. Pucchi.

The question is, what’s appropriate and what’s not?\n\nHere are the general rules:\n\nLong gloves: For a longer, more formal dress, gloves of either elbow or opera length (above the elbow) give an elegant look. They draw attention to your arms, especially if your shoulders are bare and you have on a sleeveless dress or one with spaghetti straps. Opera-length gloves also provide warmth and flair if you’re having a winter wedding.\n\nShort gloves: These are great when wanting to create a subtler effect. For a summer garden wedding, short gloves lend a fresh and light flavor and give your gown a daintier, less formal look.\n\nIf you have heavy arms, gloves will call attention to them, rather than camouflage them. If you have short arms but love the look of a long glove, choose an elbow-length pair rather than opera-length. Stay away from gloves that cut your upper arm at its heaviest point.\n\nLeather can be worn year-round, but save velvet gloves for winter.\n\nWhen wearing a suit jacket with a skirt or pants, gloves should be classic and simple. Forget wide cuffs and embellished trim. Short, wide kid gloves look best with suits.\n\nA fashion-forward bride can pair her gown with a colored glove, perhaps an ice blue or a lilac that coordinates with her bridesmaids’ dresses.”\n\nFor answers to your most pressing questions while you plan your wedding, or to learn about the best styles for your body type, the bridal fitting process, and the do’s and don’ts to help you with every stage of your dream wedding, pick up Rani St. Pucchi’s #1 bestseller, Your Bridal Style: Everything You Need to Know to Design the Wedding of Your Dreams.\n\n© Rani St. Pucchi, 2018\n\nRani St. Pucchi is an award-winning Couture Fashion Designer, a Style & Image Consultant, and a Relationship Expert.
