        "text": "Bridal Party 101 | Responsibilities\n\nThere’s More Than Just Partying in the Bridal Party\n\nExpected Duties, Planning, and Etiquette\n\nWhether you have tons of experience being part of a bridal party, or it’s your first time, we’ve collected all you need to know about the roles and duties that they come with. In general, the wedding party–meaning the people the happy couple chooses to stand up with them during the ceremony–is responsible for helping the happy couple plan, stay sane, and cheering them on during the big day. The wedding party’s most commonly known duties include taking photos with the bride and groom on the wedding day, planning special pre-wedding events like the bridal shower or bachelor/bachelorette parties, and helping the bride and groom get ready before the ceremony. They also usually have a special seat at the reception. We understand that every wedding is different depending on how involved family members are or how large the bridal party ends up being. So as a party member, always reach out to the happy couple to offer help!\n\nGeneral Bridal Party (Bridesmaids/Groomsmen/Maid of Honor/Best Man)\n\nEach couple will customize their bridal party to fit their ideal group’s idea for their big day. It’s up to the party members to be available to help make the magic happen as smoothly as possible and offer their services in any way they can. Most couples tend to worry about burdening their friends with the planning details, but if you feel comfortable offering an extra hand anywhere, they’ll be forever grateful. Below, we’ve gathered the general responsibilities expected of all members of the bridal party.\n\nOffer to help with wedding planning and pre-wedding events.\n\nBe knowledgeable of, spread the news about, where the happy couple is registered, when and where the ceremony will be taking place, and where to send gifts.\n\nHelp choose wedding day attire and accessories if asked.\n\nHelp the Maid of Honor and Best Man with details to plan the bachelor/bachelorette party.\n\nPay for own wedding attire and travel expenses.\n\nAttend any pre-wedding events. (Depending on if they’re co-ed or not.)\n\nPurchase wedding day attire and accessories promptly as requested by the couple.\n\nAttend the wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner.\n\nOffer the happy couple and their families help and emotional support on the day of the wedding.\n\nAt the reception, help make sure everything goes according to plan.\n\nBeing social and helping make guests feel welcome.\n\nGetting the party started on the dance floor.\n\nDecorating the getaway vehicle to help give the happy couple a proper send-off.\n\nAttend the send-off or post-wedding brunch.\n\nMaid of Honor\n\nBeing chosen as Maid of Honor (MOH) is an incredible honor. Essentially, the bride is asking you to be her go-to for anything she might need, from engagement to the final send-off. Not only are you head of the bridesmaids, but duties also include planning the bachelorette party and being the bride’s right-hand woman on the big day. The bride usually gives this role to a sister or her closest female friend. Before accepting this honor, check out the duties listed below that rest on your capable shoulders. (Anything we’ve italicized is uncommon, although considerate, duties to offer to the bride but can vary depending on the situation.)\n\nManage the bridesmaids and mediate any conflicts that may arise.\n\nMaintain a level head throughout the bride’s wedding planning.\n\nOversee and keep track of pre-wedding expenses for the bridesmaids.\n\nHelp the bride shop for her wedding dress and bridesmaids’ dresses.\n\nCoordinate any necessary bridesmaid fitting and ensure bridesmaids are getting their dresses and accessories on time.\n\nOffer to address wedding invitations and assist with miscellaneous wedding projects.\n\nOrganize and host or co-host the bridal shower.\n\nOrganize and plan the bachelorette party.\n\nOffer to help the bride pack for the honeymoon.\n\nMake sure the bridesmaids all arrive at the wedding on time with everything they need.\n\nAssist with the bride’s appearance during the ceremony and rehearsal. (Keep an eye out for smudged makeup or stray hairs and help her with her veil, dress, and arranging her train during the ceremony.)\n\nHold the bride’s bouquet during the ceremony.\n\nHold the groom’s ring during the ceremony if asked.\n\nSign the marriage certificate.\n\nGive a toast to the happy couple at the reception.\n\nMake sure the bride eats and drinks water.\n\nHelp transport wedding gifts from the reception.\n\nBest Man\n\nAccording to history, the best man was a groom’s kidnapping accomplice and willing to fight to the death for the bride’s honor. These days, kidnapping is thankfully off the agenda, but the best man still has many important responsibilities. Serving as the groom’s right-hand man throughout the wedding planning process hasn’t changed. He’s also in charge of wrangling the other groomsmen during wedding planning and on the big day. This role is usually filled by the groom’s brother or closest male friend. Below, we’ve listed some of the other duties that come with this title. (The duties in italics are optional and vary depending on the happy couple and their family’s traditions.)\n\nHelp manage groomsmen and mediate any conflicts that may arise.\n\nOversee and keep track of pre-wedding expenses for the groomsmen.\n\nCoordinate suit or tuxedo fittings for all groomsmen and ushers.\n\nOrganize and plan the bachelor party.\n\nOffer support to the groom and groomsmen during wedding planning and on the day of the wedding.\n\nHelp orchestrate toasts at the rehearsal dinner.\n\nMake sure all groomsmen and ushers arrive at the wedding on time and with everything they need.\n\nHold the bride’s wedding ring during the ceremony if asked.\n\nSign the marriage certificate.\n\nGive a toast to the happy couple at the reception.\n\nCoordinate with the happy couple’s parents to ensure all service providers have received the necessary payment and tips.\n\nOther Party Members\n\nParents of the Groom: The Engagement Party and Rehearsal Dinner are usually the groom’s parents’ responsibility in Western Cultures. Depending on the cultural traditions of each family, this may change.\n\nParents of the Bride: As mentioned above, in typical western culture, the bride’s parents are the designated Wedding Reception Hosts. Recently, we’ve seen more happy couples become their own reception hosts, so this tradition of “who pays for the wedding” can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nJunior Bridesmaids and Groomsmen: Typically, junior bridal party members are do not attend the Bachelor/Bachelorette parties, but for young adults between 9-15, including them in the bridal party is a great way to get them involved in the big day. They usually stand up with the happy couple during the ceremony and are included in any engagement parties or co-ed bridal showers.\n\nRing Bearers and Flower Girls: This role is usually reserved for children between 4-8 years old, and responsibility for attendance and attire goes to their parents. It’s recommended to include them in the wedding rehearsal to get a little practice for the big day. Flower Girls traditionally walk right before the bride to scatter petals while ring bearers can be fit into the processional wherever the happy couple sees fit.\n\nFinal Notes\n\nThe responsibilities we’ve listed usually come pretty naturally since you’re there to support your friends in their love story. So enjoy the day, and always remember to offer your help wherever you can! Being part of this big day is a ton of fun! Planning a wedding isn’t for the faint of heart, and your friends will be forever thankful that you’re there to lean on.\n\nOur Top Tricks and Tips for Booking Holiday Events\n\nin faq\n\nby lcr\n\nCelebrate your company’s accomplishments, bolster the company culture, and boost morale! A holiday party is an easy means to escape all those work worries and gather together to create a better overall workplace environment. When planning a party, the venue is all-important – and there are many holiday event venues to choose from in the Carlsbad area. What should you anticipate when planning an off-site party? Here are six major points our experts suggest you consider.\n\nExplore Your Budget\n\nAn overall budget will help steer you towards the type of venues available. It’s best to balance the budget with the cost of the venue and associated services. Consider all party costs – not just the venue rental. That includes entertainment, food and beverage, logistics rental, and staffing. Determine an overall budget before beginning a search for possible venues.\n\nPick The Date\n\nWhen choosing a holiday party venue, the event date is a key factor. This means that it is imperative to book the event as early as possible before your preferred date fills up. Waiting too long to reserve a date may cause a company to settle for a venue that isn’t at the top of your list. If you’re flexible about the date, however, you may find more options available.\n\nCompanies like to get holiday parties on the calendar well before the holidays – especially before their employees start taking off for holiday vacations. In years past, many companies preferred to host parties on either the first or second Friday or Saturday in December. This trend is changing, however, with holiday parties extending well into January of the following year.\n\nTailor-Fit Your Party To Your Needs\n\nBefore putting any firm decisions in place, think about what kind of party fits the company best. What do people want? Formal or a more casual event? Is an indoor party the way to go, or do people like an outside option? Are you hosting a dancing crowd or a more relaxed group? Getting all these answers will help your party take shape quickly, allowing you to move forward easily.\n\nPre-defined options also help narrow the focus. This way, you can take polls faster while limiting the number of off-the-wall suggestions. Not all participants will get their first choice, but everyone will be on board if you come up with a popular solution.\n\nElevate The Theme with Decor and Rentals\n\nSome venues are truly full service, like our Ranch; others are more bare-bones. Thus, it is helpful to understand what the venue supplies and what you need to source yourself. Yes, the venue probably has tables and chairs (although these may need to be rented, too), but what about decorations? Do you need to supply or rent these yourself, or can the venue help line everything up? Don’t forget audio/video needs; will you need to rent a computer, projector, screen, or even a microphone and speakers? If the event is outdoors, what about heat lamps? (Even San Diego can get chilly in December.)\n\nImbibe And Dine!\n\nA bad dining experience might be the only thing your coworkers remember about your holiday party if your food choices flop. When reviewing possible venues, find out which food and drink options are available. According to our experts, these are the questions to ask: Does the venue have on-site food services, complete with kitchen and servers? Or does a catering service need to be brought in? Alcohol will probably be part of the mix, and most venues will provide it, but how much does it cost? Will the company offer an open bar, or is a cash bar more appropriate for your budget?\n\nFood and beverage costs can account for a fair percentage of your party expenditures. Make sure to include this on your list when you’re evaluating venues. It will help to know whether the venue provides these services (and at what cost) or whether you need to use a separate caterer.\n\nHow To Entertain The Masses\n\nYou’ve got the food, decorations, and a stunning venue, but it’s awfully quiet… Jazz up the party with some music, either in the background or upfront for dancing. Take into consideration that not all venues can accommodate all types of entertainment. A single DJ with all his equipment only takes up ten square feet of space. However, booking an eight-piece party band will require much more.\n\nLooking for a little something extra? For more family-oriented parties, try booking magicians or caricaturists! Face painters will be sure to delight kids of all ages! For the adults, offer casino games or a photo booth. Outdoor events are perfect for late night lawn games. Just check with the venue that they can accommodate the entertainment selected.\n\nIf this all seems a little overwhelming, reach out to our talented coordination team!\n\nWith a few simple questions answered, we’ll take care of everything. Your party planning experience will be a breeze, and your coworkers will marvel at how you pulled it off with such ease.\n\nOur Events Are All-Inclusive, All Of The Time.\n\nWhat do we mean by an “All-Inclusive” event?\n\nAll-inclusive refers to a venue that provides everything you would need to make your event come together. The term all-inclusive usually describes a venue that includes everything from the food and drinks to the table linens and event rentals. Some all-inclusive event spaces offer (or partner with) DJs, floral designers, and photography services, although this depends on your specific needs and style.\n\nSome of the things you can expect from a San Diego all-inclusive event solution include:\n\nDay of wedding or event coordinator\n\nEvent manager and wait staff to make sure everything runs smoothly\n\nCustom menus and bar options\n\nChampagne or sparkling cider for the toast\n\nComplimentary cake cutting service\n\nTables, including sweetheart table for a wedding\n\nGuestbook tables and place card tables\n\nBelly bars with stools for cocktail hour\n\nPatio heaters for outside events\n\nFloor-length linens (color options typically provided)\n\nChoice of chargers for plates\n\nCandle options\n\nChina and champagne flutes for dining\n\nSetup and clean up services\n\nWhat is Not Provided in All-Inclusive Event?\n\nThis depends on the venue. Many times, the venue will offer flexibility in the available packages. For example, clients may be presented with different menus styles and not be limited to one fixed choice. These options may include variations of a sit-down menu, tray-passed appetizers, and / or specialty dining stations. Clients may also have to say over the color of linens and table layouts.\n\nThe following services are typically not included in an all-inclusive event:\n\nPhotographers and videographers make precise decisions during an event. Every photographer and videographer has a unique approach to their style of shooting. So each individual should choose who to work with based on your compatibility and style.\n\nDJ — DJs are also particular and tend to play towards a specific genre or musical taste. DJs play important roles in San Diego weddings and events as they use their personalities and energy to lead the crowd and change the room’s mood.\n\nFloral designers — choose a floral designer who is also closely based on your similar personal preference. These are usually chosen by the couple, or event host, as the style and type of flowers can set the entire event’s tone.\n\nHowever, it is typically a great idea to have an all-inclusive event for the convenience of it all. If you would like suggestions for the DJ, floral designer, photographer, or other services not included by default, ask your coordinator! Our talented team of venue coordinators will suggest vendor partners or favorites based on their network and connections. Experienced wedding and event coordinators in San Diego are well connected within the community and will have plenty of top-notch vendors to recommend.\n\nTalk to a Professional about an All-Inclusive Event in San Diego\n\nIf you are looking for an all-inclusive event venue in San Diego, look no further!

This way, everyone feels included, and nobody accidentally gets stepped on during the excitement!\n\n-Cash Incentive (AKA Singles for the Singles): Placing a bit of money on the bouquet, or with garter, before the toss can add a little motivation for your guests to claim the prize! Gift cards are a fun alternative as well and could encourage future romantic dates for the lucky winner.\n\n-Bottle of Booze: Winning a bottle of something nice to accompany the bouquet or garter might also promote a little more interest from guests!\n\nNew Methods: Fresh perspective on old fun!\n\n-Hot Potato: (Similar to musical chairs, but with fewer chances for accidental injuries.) While a song plays in the background, guests can pass the garter or bouquet around in a circle until the music stops. The one left holding the prize is the lucky winner!\n\n-Box of Treasure: Have guests pick a key out of a mixed pile to unlock a box or birdcage with the award.\n\n-Ribbon Pull: An old European version of this tradition. Many false ribbons are held in the Bride’s hands above her head, with one secret winner tied around the bouquet. Everyone pulls at the same time and the winning ribbon reels in the prize!\n\n-Toss the Boutonniere: If you still want to throw something to the single men, but you don’t want the scandal of the garter toss, then toss the boutonniere – but take the pins out first!\n\n-Football/Three Flies Up: Easier to throw and catch–especially concerning the garter, a football can be an easy alternative. This saves the integrity of the bouquet and modesty of the Bride.\n\nPranks: For couples Who Love to Laugh Together.\n\n– Blindfolded “Quick Switch”: Groomsmen can throw on a thrift store wedding gown and swap out with the Bride in the chair. The blindfolded Groom will be none the wiser when he goes for the garter, and guests will be on the floor rolling with laughter. The topic of family gatherings for years to come!\n\n-Magic Trick: Pull random items from beneath the dress stashed out of sight behind the Bride. She’ll be shocked as everything, but the kitchen sink comes out from under her skirt!\n\n-Breakaway Bouquet: Why battle over a single bouquet? Throw a “Breakaway Bouquet” made of separated flowers, so everyone in the crowd gets one!\n\n-Gender-Bend: Surprise unsuspecting guests by swapping outfits, and reverse the garter retrieval! Hilarity is sure to ensue.\n\nOr, Toss the Tradition Entirely.\n\n-Anniversary Dance: Honor the longest-married couple by giving them the bouquet.\n\n-Cake Pull: Many variations of this technique exist, but it is popular in Southern traditions and similar to a “King Cake” from Mardi Gras celebrations. Small charms placed in a cake or cupcakes for participants indicate different types of prizes, such as good fortune in money or love. By either pulling a ribbon to extract the charm or eating the cake, guests can see what they’ve won. Be sure to warn guests before they take a bite!\n\n-Pass The Torch: Give the Bouquet to the next Bride-to-Be with a wedding coming up. The ribbon or other decoration from that bouquet can be for “something borrowed” on her wedding day.\n\nHave fun with the tradition and make it fit your personality however you see best!\n\nGuests will be delighted by any efforts to keep it alive in your special way.\n\nThanks to True Photography for the fantastic pictures!"
