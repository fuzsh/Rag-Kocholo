You can plan to have the perfect table settings at the most beautiful venue, hire the best band or DJ you’ve ever heard, and serve the most incredible food known to man…but if the dress isn’t right, does any of that other stuff even matter? In our efforts to help you find the ideal wedding dress, we’re uncovering a little style secret that the most fashionable brides out there are embracing more and more—the two-piece wedding dress. Bridal gown separates are becoming increasingly more popular as brides everywhere are starting to catch on to all the benefits that a two-piece dress can offer. Not only can you find a top and bottom that perfectly captures your sense of style, you can find cuts and silhouettes that flatter your unique proportions, customize a one-of-a-kind dress that no one else will have, and maybe, if you’re creative and daring enough, actually wear your dress—or at least one of the pieces—again. Wedding dress separates are versatile, chic, and perfect for any bride-to-be. If you’re not convinced, we’ve got a few good reasons why you should at least consider this growing trend!\n\n1. You Want to Show Some Skin\n\nYou can be a classy, tasteful bride and still flash a little bit of skin. With the crop top trend showing no signs of slowing down, it’s easy to understand why the two-piece wedding dress has become so popular over the past season. You’ve spent hours in the gym working on those incredible abs, and you’ve embraced your femininity to the point that you’re not afraid to show a little bit of skin at the midriff. So why not let your personal style shine on your wedding day? With a two-piece crop top wedding dress, you can do just that. Bridal designers, such as Sottero & Midgley and Willowby by Watters, have embraced the crop top trend and incorporated it into some of their most beautiful bridal tops. In silhouettes that range from bead-encrusted halters to smooth and lustrous satin tanks to simple camis embellished with Swarovski crystals, it’s easy to find a crop top that fits your body to perfection, captures your personal sense of style, and coordinates effortlessly with your choice of a separate bridal skirt.

You Want to Create Your Own Look\n\nTwo-piece wedding dresses allow you the opportunity to create a one-of-a-kind look for your wedding day. For the bride who loves fashion and isn’t afraid to customize her own look, two-piece wedding dresses let you play with proportions. You’ll never find that with traditional bridal gowns. When it comes to bridal tops, you can find options that range from 3/4 sleeve lace crop tops with bateau necklines to midriff-baring halters embellished with beads to strapless corset-inspired styles that create a molded, sculpted bodice. Coordinating bridal skirts range from tiered organza ball gown skirts to full-length net A-line skirts to mermaid net skirts complete with chapel length trains. No matter what silhouette you want to wear, bridal separates are available to help you achieve your ideal look! Lanikai Willowby by Watters | Bree by Wtoo It’s no secret that the budget you’re working with and the resources you have can dictate the type of dress you wear on your wedding day. But what so many brides don’t realize is that separates—even though you have to buy two—can be incredibly affordable while offering you the option to create your own one-of-a-kind look! We love the idea of putting together the top we love with the skirt we adore. It’s what we do every day. With so many bridal gown separates available, it’s easy to do that on your wedding day as well.\n\n3. You Want to Find the Perfect Fit\n\nMany women will agree that they wear one size on the top and a different size on the bottom. It can be a challenge to find a dress that fits you perfectly from head to toe when your upper and lower proportions are not the same. When you opt for bridal gown separates as opposed to a traditional one-piece gown, it’s much easier to find the silhouettes and styles that flatter your figure. One of the best things about two-piece wedding dresses is that you can wear the exact top and bottom you want to wear, without having to search through thousands of wedding dresses to find the ideal ones that captures both elements of your desired look. Pair a cap sleeve lace bodice with a simple A-line skirt or team a beaded, embellished corset with a tiered ball gown bottom. Whatever you desire your perfect look to be, you can create it with separate styles that can be easily coordinated together.\n\nVoyage by Mori Lee | Sottero + Midgley Ashby Skirt\n\nOffering the option to order different sizes on the top and bottom can also dramatically reduce the cost of alterations. If you’re shopping for a one-piece gown and you wear a size 16 on the top and a size 12 on the bottom, chances are that you will need to order a size 16 gown and spend more money to have the bottom tailored to fit your curves. But why spend money on extra fabric only to have to then spend more money to have it cut and trimmed? With bridal gown separates, you can order the exact sizes you need to fit your specific body shape.\n\n4. You Want to Wear Your Dress Again\n\nMost brides don’t expect to ever be able to wear their wedding dress again. By the time the honeymoon is over, most brides are looking into dress storage options and preservation techniques to keep their dress safe and clean for years to come. We happen to think that if you’re going to shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a dress, you may as well be able to get at least one more wear out of it. With a two-piece wedding dress, you can actually get more than one wear out of your beautiful bridal look. We love the idea of re-inventing a bridal top into an ensemble that works for an anniversary dinner or a special post-wedding celebration with your spouse. Wtoo Effie Bridal Skirt | Sottero + Midgley Shayne Bodice While you may not want to pair it with a ball gown skirt, a pretty lace or beaded bodice can be mixed and matched with everything from jeans to trousers to mini or midi skirts. Layer a 3/4 sleeve lace bodice with a pleated midi skirt and pumps for classic, ladylike style. Team your beaded corset bodice with jeans and a great blazer that offers the element of surprise. Your bridal top can go the distance! If you’re wearing it on a date with your beloved spouse, it just might bring to mind all that romantic spirit you felt on your actual wedding day. Bridal gown separates are available in a wide variety of fabrics and silhouettes, allowing you to find your perfect look, create a dress that fits your unique proportions, and express your personal sense of style for your wedding day and beyond.\n\nYou may also like...\n\nBlack Friday in July Sale: $99 Bridesmaid Dresses!\n\nMost bridesmaid dresses are $99 (up to $50 OFF) + up to 55% OFF wedding accessories.\n\nSHOP BLACK FRIDAY IN JULY DEALS"
