A case study from the evaporite karst of the Fluvia Valley, NE Spain.\n\nPubMed\n\nLinares, Rogelio; RoquÃ©, Carles; GutiÃ©rrez, Francisco; Zarroca, Mario; Carbonel, Domingo; Bach, Joan; Fabregat, Ivan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis work introduces the concept that sinkhole frequency in some karst settings increases during drought periods. This conception is tested in a sector of the Fluvia River valley in NE Spain, where subsidence phenomena is related to the karstification of folded Eocene evaporite formations. In the discharge areas, the evaporites behave as confined aquifers affected by hypogene karstification caused by aggressive artesian flows coming form an underlying carbonate aquifer. A sinkhole inventory with chronological data has been constructed, revealing temporal clusters. Those clusters show a good correlation with drought periods, as revealed by precipitation, river discharge and piezometric data. This temporal association is particularly obvious for the last and current drought starting in 1998, which is the most intense of the record period (1940-present). Climatic projections based on recent studies foresee an intensification of the droughts in this sector of NE Spain, which could be accompanied by the enhancement of the sinkhole hazard and the associated risks.

P.; GutiÃ©rrez, F.; Remondo, J.; Bonachea, J.; Lucha, P.; Cendrero, A.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nMultiple sinkhole susceptibility models have been generated in three study areas of the Ebro Valley evaporite karst (NE Spain) applying different methods (nearest neighbour distance, sinkhole density, heuristic scoring system and probabilistic analysis) for each sinkhole type separately (cover collapse sinkholes, cover and bedrock collapse sinkholes and cover and bedrock sagging sinkholes). The quantitative and independent evaluation of the predictive capability of the models reveals that: (1) The most reliable susceptibility models are those derived from the nearest neighbour distance and sinkhole density. These models can be generated in a simple and rapid way from detailed geomorphological maps. (2) The reliability of the nearest neighbour distance and density models is conditioned by the degree of clustering of the sinkholes. Consequently, the karst areas in which sinkholes show a higher clustering are a priori more favourable for predicting new occurrences. (3) The predictive capability of the best models obtained in this research is significantly higher (12.5-82.5%) than that of the heuristic sinkhole susceptibility model incorporated into the General Urban Plan for the municipality of Zaragoza. Although the probabilistic approach provides lower quality results than the methods based on sinkhole proximity and density, it helps to identify the most significant factors and select the most effective mitigation strategies and may be applied to model susceptibility in different future scenarios.\n\nSummer mistral at the exit of the RhÃ´ne valley\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrobinski, P.; Bastin, S.; Guenard, V.; Caccia, J. L.; Dabas, A. M.; Delville, P.; Protat, A.; Reitebuch, O.; Werner, C.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe paper examines the three-dimensional structure and dynamics of the mistral at the RhÃ´ne valley exit on 28 June 2001. The mistral refers to a severe wind that develops along the RhÃ´ne valley in southern France. This summer mistral event was documented in the framework of the ESCOMPTE field experiment. The dynamical processes driving the circulation of the mistral in the RhÃ´ne valley and particularly wake formation and planetary boundary layer (PBL) inhomogeneity at the scale of RhÃ´ne valley delta are investigated. Several important data sources are used (airborne Doppler lidar, radiosondes and surface stations) as well as non-hydrostatic mesoscale simulations. This paper analyses experimentally, numerically and theoretically the mechanism of wake formation. It shows that the flow impinging on the Alpine range and the Massif Central becomes supercritical all along the ridge line, including the RhÃ´ne valley and continues to accelerate in the lee regions until a hydraulic jump occurs. It leads to the formation of wakes behind and close to the mountain peaks. Compared to the Massif Central wake, the origin of the western Alps wake is rather complicated. In this study, the observations and simulations suggest a combined wall separation/gravity wave breaking mechanism to explain the western Alps wake. Indeed, it is shown that in addition to the flow descending the western Alps slopes and experiencing a strong hydraulic jump, the point where the mistral flow separates from the eastern flank of the RhÃ´ne valley located at about 44Â°N is associated with a 'flank-shock' which is an oblique hydraulic jump (i.e.the downstream Froude number is supercritical). Wake formation in the lee of the Alps and the Massif Central causes large inhomogeneity of the PBL with differences between land and sea. In the Massif Central and western Alps wakes, the continental PBL is deeper (1.8 km) than in the mistral flow (1 km), which is consistent with a subcritical regime associated\n\nImpact of the RhÃ´ne and Durance valleys on sea-breeze circulation in the Marseille area\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBastin, Sophie; Drobinski, Philippe; Dabas, Alain; Delville, Patricia; Reitebuch, Oliver; Werner, Christian\n\n2005-03-01\n\nSea-breeze dynamics in the Marseille area, in the south of France, is investigated in the framework of the ESCOMPTE experiment conducted during summer 2001 in order to evaluate the role of thermal circulations on pollutant transport and ventilation. Under particular attention in this paper is the sea-breeze channelling by the broad RhÃ´ne valley and the narrow Durance valley, both oriented nearly-north-south, i.e., perpendicular to the coastline, and its possible impact on the sea-breeze penetration, intensity and depth, which are key information for air pollution issues. One situation of slight synoptic pressure gradient leading to a northerly flow in the RhÃ´ne valley (25 June 2001) and one situation of a weak onshore prevailing synoptic wind (26 June 2001) are compared. The impact of the RhÃ´ne and Durance valleys on the sea-breeze dynamics on these two typical days is generalized to the whole ESCOMPTE observing period. The present study shows by combining simple scaling analysis with wind data from meteorological surface stations and Doppler lidars that (i) the Durance valley always affects the sea breeze by accelerating the flow. A consequence is that the Durance valley contributes to weaken the temperature gradient along the valley and thus the sea-breeze circulation. In some cases, the acceleration of the channelled flow in the Durance valley suppresses the sea-breeze flow by temperature gradient inhibition; (ii) the RhÃ´ne valley does not generally affect the sea breeze significantly. However, if the sea breeze is combined with an onshore flow, it leads to further penetration inland and intensification of the low-level southerly flow. In this situation, lateral constriction may accelerate the sea breeze. Simple scaling analysis suggests that Saint Paul (44.35Â°N, about 100 km from the coastline) is the lower limit where sea breeze can be affected by the RhÃ´ne valley. These conclusions have implications in air quality topics as channelled sea breeze may\n\nRailway deformation detected by DInSAR over active sinkholes in the Ebro Valley evaporite karst, Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalve, J. P.; CastaÃ±eda, C.; GutiÃ©rrez, F.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nSubsidence was measured for the first time on railway tracks in the central sector of Ebro Valley (NE Spain) using Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques. This area is affected by evaporite karst and the analysed railway corridors traverse active sinkholes that produce deformations in these infrastructures. One of the railway tracks affected by slight settlements is the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed line, a form of transport infrastructure highly vulnerable to ground deformation processes. Our analysis based on DInSAR measurements and geomorphological surveys indicates that this line shows dissolution-induced subsidence and compaction of anthropogenic deposits (infills and embankments). Significant sinkhole-related subsidence was also measured by DInSAR techniques on the CastejÃ³n-Zaragoza conventional railway line. This study demonstrates that DInSAR velocity maps, coupled with detailed geomorphological surveys, may help in the identification of the railway track sections that are affected by active subsidence.\n\nRailway deformation detected by DInSAR over active sinkholes in the Ebro Valley evaporite karst, Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalve, J. P.; CastaÃ±eda, C.; GutiÃ©rrez, F.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nPreviously not measured subsidence on railway tracks was detected using DInSAR displacement maps produced for the central sector of Ebro Valley (NE Spain). This area is affected by evaporite karst and the analyzed railway corridors traverse active sinkholes that produce deformations in these infrastructures. One of the railway tracks affected by slight settlements corresponds to the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed line, a transport infrastructure highly vulnerable to ground deformation processes.

By using DInSAR techniques, it was also measured the significant subsidence related to the activity of sinkholes in the CastejÃ³n-Zaragoza conventional railway line. Thus, this study demonstrate that DInSAR velocity maps coupled with detailed geomorphological surveys may help in the identification of the sectors of railway tracks that may compromise the safety of travellers.\n\nThermal shock and splash effects on burned gypseous soils from the Ebro Basin (NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeÃ³n, J.; Seeger, M.; BadÃ­a, D.; Peters, P.; EcheverrÃ­a, M. T.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFire is a natural factor of landscape evolution in Mediterranean ecosystems. The middle Ebro Valley has extreme aridity, which results in a low plant cover and high soil erodibility, especially on gypseous substrates. The aim of this research is to analyze the effects of moderate heating on physical and chemical soil properties, mineralogical composition and susceptibility to splash erosion. Topsoil samples (15 cm depth) were taken in the Remolinos mountain slopes (Ebro Valley, NE Spain) from two soil types: Leptic Gypsisol (LP) in a convex slope and Haplic Gypsisol (GY) in a concave slope. To assess the heating effects on the mineralogy we burned the soils at 105 and 205 Â°C in an oven and to assess the splash effects we used a rainfall simulator under laboratory conditions using undisturbed topsoil subsamples (0-5 cm depth of Ah horizon). LP soil has lower soil organic matter (SOM) and soil aggregate stability (SAS) and higher gypsum content than GY soil. Gypsum and dolomite are the main minerals (>80%) in the LP soil, while gypsum, dolomite, calcite and quartz have similar proportions in GY soil. Clay minerals (kaolinite and illite) are scarce in both soils. Heating at 105 Â°C has no effect on soil mineralogy. However, heating to 205 Â°C transforms gypsum to bassanite, increases significantly the soil salinity (EC) in both soil units (LP and GY) and decreases pH only in GY soil. Despite differences in the content of organic matter and structural stability, both soils show no significant differences (P < 0.01) in the splash erosion rates. The size of pores is reduced by heating, as derived from variations in soil water retention capacity.\n\nDeciphering tectonic, climatic-induced and hydrothermal signals in the late-stage exhumation history of the upper RhÃ´ne valley (Swiss Alps)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nValla, Pierre; Rahn, Meinert; Shuster, David; van der Beek, Peter\n\n2015-04-01\n\nNeogene exhumation of the European Alps is understood as the interplay between tectonics and climatic-induced erosion. While the former has been influenced by a decrease in plate convergence, the latter has been suggested to be affected by climatic variation and the onset of Plio-Quaternary glaciations, leading to relief amplification. However, even though geomorphologic and sedimentologic studies both suggest topographic relief change and transition from fluvial to oscillations between glacial/fluvial conditions, precise quantification on both the timing and magnitude of this transition are yet sparse. Our study focuses on the upper RhÃ´ne valley (Swiss Central Alps) within the Visp-Brig area (Aar massif). This area encompasses some of the most spectacular reliefs within the Alps with several nearby summits around or above 4000 m crosscut by the glacially overdeepened RhÃ´ne valley. It also shows among the highest late Neogene exhumation rates within the Western-Central European Alps, influenced by tectonic activity along the major Simplon-RhÃ´ne extensional fault system. Moreover, the upper RhÃ´ne valley has experienced enhanced glacial erosion associated with strong relief development during the Pliocene-Quaternary period. Finally, structural inheritance, late-stage tectonics and rapid exhumation may have promoted recent hydrothermal activity in this region, although timing of its onset and its precise causes remain poorly understood. We investigated the late-stage cooling history by using different low-temperature thermochronometers along a pseudo-vertical bedrock profile (elevation between 600 and 2900 m) and additional samples from an on-site 500-m geothermal well, resulting in a total elevation difference of nearly 3 km. Apatite fission-track (AFT) ages and track-length data have been added to previously published and new apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He (AHe) and 4He/3He data. Our results confirm high-exhumation rates (0.6 to 0.9 km/Myr) within late-Cenozoic to\n\nTectono-geomorphic indices of the Erin basin, NE Kashmir valley, India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAhmad, Shabir; Alam, Akhtar; Ahmad, Bashir; Afzal, Ahsan; Bhat, M. I.; Sultan Bhat, M.; Farooq Ahmad, Hakim; Tectonics; Natural Hazards Research Group\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe present study aims to assess the tectonic activity in the Erin basin (NE Kashmir) on the basis of several relevant geomorphic indices and field observations. We use Digital Elevation Model (SRTM) and Survey of India (SoI) topographic maps in GIS environment to compute the geomorphic indices. The indices i.e., convex hypsometric curve, high hypsometric integral value (Hi > 0.5), low basin elongation ratio (Eb = 0.17), low mountain front sinuosity values (Smf = 1.08 average), low valley floor width ratios (Vf < 1), topographic assymetric character (T < 1), uneven basin asymmetry factor (AF < 50), elongated shape (Bs > 4) suggest that the area is tectonically active. Moreover, prominent irregularities (knickpoints/knickzones) along longitudinal profile of the Erin River even in homogenous resistant lithology (Panjal trap) and anomalous stream gradient index (SL) values reflect that the Erin basin is dissected by two faults (EF-1 and EF-2) with NNW-SSE and SSW-NNE trends respectively. The results of this preliminary study further substantiate the recent GPS studies, which argue that the maximum strain is accumulating in the NE part of the Kashmir Himalaya.\n\nSeismic local site effects characterization in the Andarax River Valley (SE Spain) from ambient seismic noise\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCarmona, Enrique; GarcÃ­a-Jerez, Antonio; LuzÃ³n, Francisco; SÃ¡nchez-Martos, Francisco; SÃ¡nchez-Sesma, Francisco J.; PiÃ±a, JosÃ©\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThis work is focused on the characterization of seismic local effects in the Low Andarax River Valley (SE Spain). The Low Andarax River valley is located in an active seismic region, with the higher seismic hazard values in Spain. The landform is composed mainly by sedimentary materials which increase its seismic hazard due to the amplification of the seismic inputs and spectral resonances. We study seismic local effects in the Low Andarax River by analyzing the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) of ambient noise records. The noise data were recorded during two field campaigns in 2012 and 2013. There have been a total of 374 noise measurements with 15 and 30 minutes duration. The acquisition was performed with a Digital Broadband Seismometer Guralp CMG-6TD. The distance between measurements was about 200 meters, covering an area around 40 km2. There have been 6 significant peak frequencies between 0.3 Hz and 5 Hz. It was possible to find interesting areas with similar spectral peaks that coincide with zones with similar microgravimetric anomalies at the alluvial valley. It is also observed a decrease in the frequency peaks from West to East suggesting increased sediment layer. We also compute the soil models at those sites where geotechnical information is available, assuming that the seismic noise is diffuse. We invert the HVSR for these places using horizontally layered models and in the imaginary part the Green functions at the source. It is observed that the S wave velocity inverted models are consistent with the known geotechnical information obtained from drilled boreholes. We identify the elastodynamic properties of the limestone-dolomite materials with a formation of phyllites and quartzite that form the basement of the depression, and those properties of the Miocene and Pliocene detrital deposits (marls, sandy silts, sands and conglomerates) that fill the valley. These results together with the observed resonant frequencies along the Andarax\n\nThe Politics of Place: Official, Intermediate and Community Discourses in Depopulated Rural Areas of Central Spain. The Case of the Riaza River Valley (Segovia, Spain)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPaniagua, Angel\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis paper provides theoretical and methodological arguments to study the politics of space in small marginal and depopulated areas of Spain. The case for research is the Riaza river valley in the province of Segovia. Usually the analysis of rural space (and the geographical space in general) provides opposing presentations: vertical, betweenâ¦\n\nClimatic implications of correlated upper Pleistocene glacial and fluvial deposits on the Cinca and Gallego rivers, NE Spain\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLewis, Claudia J; Mcdonald, Eric; Sancho, Carlos\n\nWe correlate Upper Pleistocene glacial and fluvial deposits of the Cinca and Gallego River valleys (south central Pyrenees and Ebro basin, Spain) using geomorphic position, luminescence dates, and time-related trends in soil development. The ages obtained from glacial deposits indicate glacial periods at 85 {+-} 5 ka, 64 {+-} 11 ka, and 36 {+-} 3 ka (from glacial till) and 20 {+-} 3 ka (from loess). The fluvial drainage system, fed by glaciers in the headwaters, developed extensive terrace systems in the Cinca River valley at 178 {+-} 21 ka, 97 {+-} 16 ka, 61 {+-} 4 ka, 47 {+-}moreÂ Â» 4 ka, and 11 {+-} 1 ka, and in the Gallego River valley at 151 {+-} 11 ka, 68 {+-} 7 ka, and 45 {+-} 3 ka. The times of maximum geomorphic activity related to cold phases coincide with Late Pleistocene marine isotope stages and heinrich events. The maximum extent of glaciers during the last glacial occurred at 64 {+-} 11 ka, and the terraces correlated with this glacial phase are the most extensive in both the Cinca (61 {+-} 4 ka) and Gallego (68 {+-} 7 ka) valleys, indicating a strong increase in fluvial discharge and availability of sediments related to the transition to deglaciation. The global Last Glacial Maximum is scarcely represented in the south central Pyrenees owing to dominantly dry conditions at that time. Precipitation must be controlled by the position of the Iberian Peninsula with respect to the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation system. The glacial systems and the associated fluvial dynamic seem sensitive to (1) global climate changes controlled by insolation, (2) North Atlantic thermohaline circulation influenced by freshwater pulses into the North Atlantic, and (3) anomalies in atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic controlling precipitation on the Iberian peninsula. The model of glacial and fluvial evolution during the Late Pleistocene in northern Spain could be extrapolated to other glaciated mountainous areas in southern Europe.Â«Â less\n\nThe 14 July 2001 hailstorm in northeastern Spain: diagnosis of the meteorological situation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTudurÃ­, E.; Romero, R.; LÃ³pez, L.; GarcÃ­a, E.; SÃ¡nchez, J. L.; Ramis, C.\n\nHail producing thunderstorms developed over the Ebro valley (NE Spain) during the evening of 14 July 2001, affecting mainly the Lerida province. Hail stones as large as 3 cm in diameter produced damage on 2979 ha of fruit trees, vineyard and cornfields. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front, which was moving from the Gulf of Biscay towards inland Spain. Meteosat images and radar data demonstrate that the storms formed over the central part of the Ebro valley and moved towards the east attaining their maximum development in Lerida province. A diagnosis, using data from ECMWF, shows that at surface there was a cyclonic circulation over northeastern Spain and at medium levels (500 hPa) a trough with cold air located towards northwestern Spain. The Q vector diagnosis demonstrates that the forcing for upward vertical motions was rather weak at both low and medium levels over the area where the thunderstorms developed. However, a significant frontogenesis contribution is identified over the Ebro valley. A more detailed handmade analysis shows that over the Ebro valley there was a thermal mesolow, which favoured the inland entrance of humid air from the Mediterranean. Frontogenesis and the humid air intrusion coexisted where remote-sensing observations indicated that the storms developed. A numerical study of the event using the MM5 model has been carried out. In a control experiment, the model is able to develop the thermal mesolow and reproduce, quite well, the convergence produced by the front as well as the timing of the event. In order to study the genesis and influence of the thermal mesolow, another simulation has been performed without consideration of solar radiation. The results indicate that the thermal mesolow does not develop, the convergence ahead of the cold front is significantly weakened and the front itself becomes increasingly progressive. As a result, thunderstorms do not develop and very little precipitation falls in the area.\n\n700 years reconstruction of mercury and lead atmospheric deposition in the Pyrenees (NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCorella, J. P.; Valero-GarcÃ©s, B. L.; Wang, F.; MartÃ­nez-Cortizas, A.; Cuevas, C. A.; Saiz-Lopez, A.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nGeochemical analyses in varved lake sediment cores (Lake MontcortÃ¨s, Pre-Pyrenees) allowed reconstruction of mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) atmospheric deposition over the past seven centuries in the Pyrenees (NE Spain). Accumulation Rates (AR) from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Period ranged from 2500 to 26130 Î¼g m2.y-1 and 15-152 Î¼g m2.y-1 for Pb and Hg respectively. Significant metal pollution started ca CE 1550 during a period of increased exploitation of ore resources in Spain. Colder and humid conditions in the Pyrenees during the Little Ice Age may have also favoured Hg and Pb atmospheric deposition in the lake. Therefore, the interplay between increased rainfall (wet deposition) and mining activities in the Iberian Peninsula has driven Hg and Pb AR during the Pre-industrial Period. More recently, the use of leaded gasoline in Europe in the mid-20th century may explain the highest Pb AR between CE 1953 and 1971. The highest Hg AR occurred in CE 1940 synchronous with the highest Hg production peak in AlmadÃ©n mining district (southern Spain) and the Second World War. The record of Hg enrichment in Lake MontcortÃ¨s shows a decrease during the last decades in Western Europe similar to other regional records and global emission models. This study highlights the exceptional quality of varved sequences to tease apart pollutants depositional mechanisms, identify historical periods of increased atmospheric pollution and provide a historical context for pollutant baseline values to make correct assessments of recent (atmospheric) pollution in lake ecosystems.\n\nFluvial diffluence episodes reflected in the Pleistocene tufa deposits of the River Piedra (Iberian Range, NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVÃ¡zquez-Urbez, M.; Pardo, G.; Arenas, C.; Sancho, C.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Pleistocene deposits of the valley of the River Piedra (NE Spain) are represented by thick tufas with small amounts of detrital material; the development of these deposits correlates with marine isotopic stages 9, 7, 6, and 5. The sedimentary scenario in which they formed mostly corresponded to stepped fluvial systems with barrage-cascade and associated dammed areas separated by low gradient fluvial stretches. Mapping and determining the sedimentology and chronology of these deposits distinguished two main episodes of fluvial diffluence that originated as a result of the temporary blockage of the river â a consequence of the vertical growth of tufa barrages in the main channel. In both episodes, water spilt out toward a secondary course from areas upstream of barrages where the water level surpassed the height of the divide between the main and secondary course. As a consequence, extensive and distinct tufa deposits with very varied facies formed over a gently inclined area toward and, indeed, within the secondary course. The hydrology of this secondary course was episodic, fed only by surface water. The two diffluence episodes detected occurred during MIS 7 and 7-6 and were interrupted by incision events, reflected by detrital deposits at the base of each tufa sedimentation stage in the main channel. Incision, which caused the breakage of the barrages, allowed water to again flow through the main channel. No evidence of diffluence was seen in any younger (MIS 5 to present-day) tufa deposits. The proposed diffluence model might help explain other carbonate fluvial systems in which (1) tufas appear in areas with no permanent water supply, and (2) tufas are absent over extensive areas despite conditions favourable to their formation.\n\nThe 1.5-ka varved record of Lake MontcortÃ¨s (southern Pyrenees, NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCorella, Juan Pablo; Brauer, Achim; Mangili, Clara; Rull, ValentÃ­; Vegas-VilarrÃºbia, Teresa; MorellÃ³n, Mario; Valero-GarcÃ©s, Blas L.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe karstic Lake MontcortÃ¨s sedimentary sequence spanning the last 1548 yr constitutes the first continuous, high-resolution, multi-proxy varved record in northern Spain. Sediments consist of biogenic varves composed of calcite, organic matter and detrital laminae and turbidite layers. Calcite layer thickness and internal sub-layering indicate changes in water temperature and seasonality whereas the frequency of detrital layers reflects rainfall variability. Higher temperatures occurred in Lake MontcortÃ¨s in AD 555-738, 825-875, 1010-1322 and 1874-present. Lower temperatures and prolonged winter conditions were recorded in AD 1446-1598, 1663-1711 and 1759-1819. Extreme and multiple precipitation events dominated in AD 571-593, 848-922, 987-1086, 1168-1196, 1217-1249, 1444-1457, 1728-1741 and 1840-1875, indicating complex hydrological variability in NE Spain since AD 463. The sedimentary record of Lake MontcortÃ¨s reveals a short-term relation between rainfall variability and the detrital influx, pronounced during extended periods of reduced anthropogenic influences. In pre-industrial times, during warm climate episodes, population and land use increased in the area. After the onset of the industrialization, the relationship between climate and human activities decoupled and population dynamics and landscape modifications were therefore mostly determined by socio-economic factors.\n\nPhenomenology of high-ozone episodes in NE Spain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuerol, Xavier; Gangoiti, Gotzon; Mantilla, Enrique; Alastuey, AndrÃ©s; Cruz MinguillÃ³n, Maria; Amato, Fulvio; Reche, Cristina; Viana, Mar; Moreno, Teresa; Karanasiou, Angeliki; Rivas, Ioar; PÃ©rez, NoemÃ­; Ripoll, Anna; Brines, Mariola; Ealo, Marina; Pandolfi, Marco; Lee, Hong-Ku; Eun, Hee-Ram; Park, Yong-Hee; Escudero, Miguel; Beddows, David; Harrison, Roy M.; Bertrand, Amelie; Marchand, Nicolas; Lyasota, Andrei; Codina, Bernat; Olid, Miriam; Udina, Mireia; JimÃ©nez-Esteve, Bernat; Soler, MarÃ­a R.; Alonso, Lucio; MillÃ¡n, MillÃ¡n; Ahn, Kang-Ho\n\n2017-02-01\n\nGround-level and vertical measurements (performed using tethered and non-tethered balloons), coupled with modelling, of ozone (O3), other gaseous pollutants (NO, NO2, CO, SO2) and aerosols were carried out in the plains (Vic Plain) and valleys of the northern region of the Barcelona metropolitan area (BMA) in July 2015, an area typically recording the highest O3 episodes in Spain. Our results suggest that these very high O3 episodes were originated by three main contributions: (i) the surface fumigation from high O3 reservoir layers located at 1500-3000 m a.g.l. (according to modelling and non-tethered balloon measurements), and originated during the previous day(s) injections of polluted air masses at high altitude; (ii) local/regional photochemical production and transport (at lower heights) from the BMA and the surrounding coastal settlements, into the inland valleys; and (iii) external (to the study area) contributions of both O3 and precursors. These processes gave rise to maximal O3 levels in the inland plains and valleys northwards from the BMA when compared to the higher mountain sites. Thus, a maximum O3 concentration was observed within the lower tropospheric layer, characterised by an upward increase of O3 and black carbon (BC) up to around 100-200 m a.g.l. (reaching up to 300 Âµg m-3 of O3 as a 10 s average), followed by a decrease of both pollutants at higher altitudes, where BC and O3 concentrations alternate in layers with parallel variations, probably as a consequence of the atmospheric transport from the BMA and the return flows (to the sea) of strata injected at certain heights the previous day(s). At the highest altitudes reached in this study with the tethered balloons (900-1000 m a.g.l.) during the campaign, BC and O3 were often anti-correlated or unrelated, possibly due to a prevailing regional or even hemispheric contribution of O3 at those altitudes. In the central hours of the days a homogeneous O3 distribution was evidenced for the lowest\n\nGypsum scarps and asymmetric fluvial valleys in evaporitic terrains. The role of river migration, landslides, karstification and lithology (Ebro River, NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuerrero, J.; GutiÃ©rrez, F.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMost of the Spanish fluvial systems excavated in Tertiary evaporitic gypsum formations show asymmetric valleys characterized by a stepped sequence of fluvial terraces on one valley flank and kilometric-long and > 100-m high prominent river scarp on the opposite side of the valley. Scarp undermining by the continuous preferential lateral migration of the river channel toward the valley margin leads to vertical to overhanging unstable slopes affected by a large number of slope failures that become the main geological hazard for villages located at the toe of the scarps. Detailed mapping of the gypsum scarps along the Ebro and Huerva Rivers gypsum scarps demonstrates that landslides and lateral spreading processes are predominant when claystones crop out at the base of the scarp, while rockfalls and topples become the dominant movement in those reaches where the rock mass is mainly constituted by evaporites. The dissolution of gypsum nodules, seasonal swelling and shrinking, and dispersion processes contribute to a decrease in the mechanical strength of claystones. The existence of dissolution-enlarged joints, sinkholes, and severely damaged buildings at the toe of the scarp from karstic subsidence demonstrates that the interstratal karstification of evaporites becomes a triggering factor in the instability of the rock mass. The genesis of asymmetric valleys and river gypsum scarps in the study area seem to be caused by the random migration of the river channel in the absence of lateral tilting related to tectonics or dissolution-induced subsidence. Once the scarp is developed, its preservation depends on the physicochemical properties of the substratum, the ratio between bedrock erosion and river incision rates, and climatic conditions that favour runoff erosion versus dissolution.\n\nModeling the Long-term Planform Evolution of Meandering Rivers in Confined Alluvial Valleys: Etsch-Adige River, NE Italy.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZen, S.; Bogoni, M.; Zolezzi, G.; Lanzoni, S.; Scorpio, V.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe combine the use of a morphodynamic model for river meander planform evolution with a geological dataset to investigate the influence of external confinements on the long-term evolution of a meandering river flowing in an Alpine valley. The analysis focuses on a 100 km reach of the Adige River, NE Italy, which had several sinuous/meandering sections before being extensively channelized in the 1800s. Geological surveys and historical maps revealed that many sections of the study reach impinge on the borders of the valley during its evolution. Moreover, a marked spatial heterogeneity in floodplain vertical accretion rates likely reflects preferential positions of the river channel in the floodplain. Valley confinements are represented by bedrock outcrops and by alluvial fans created by lateral tributaries, and were extracted from the geological and historical maps to build the computational domain for the meander morphodynamic model. The model predicts the long-term planform evolution of a meandering river based on a linear solution of the 2D De St Venant-Exner differential system and can manage changes in floodplain erodibility. Model applications allow to isolate the effects of valley bedrock and of alluvial fans in constraining the lateral channel migration. Modeled river channel persistence maps are compared with the available geological information. The present work allows further insights into the role of external confinements to river meander belts, which have been conducted so far mostly assuming the channel to evolve in unconfined floodplains. Future research shall incorporate model components for floodplain vertical accretion rates and for the advancement of alluvial fans occurring at the same time scale considered for meander evolution.\n\nSoil moisture availability as a factor affecting valley oak (Quercus lobata NeÃ©) seedling establishment and survival in a riparian habitat, Cosumnes River Preserve, Sacramento County, California\n\nTreesearch\n\nVirginia C.

The continental collision between the Iberian and Eurasian plates induced a double vergence orogen, the Pyrenees, which has been considered as a mature mountain range in spite of significant seismicity (e.g. Chevrot et al., 2011) and evidence of neotectonics (e.g. Goula et al., 1999). Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that the range may have never reached a steady state (Ford et al., in press). One option for resolving this controversy is to quantify the incision rates since the Miocene by reconstructing the vertical movement of geometric markers such as fluvial terraces. However, the few available ages from the Pyrenean terrace systems do not exceed the middle Pleistocene. Thus, to enlarge the time span of this dataset, we studied alluvium-filled horizontal epiphreatic passages in limestone karstic networks. Such landforms are used as substitutes of fluvial terraces because they represent former valley floors (e.g. Palmer, 2007; Audra et al., 2013). They record the transient position of former local base levels during the process of valley deepening. The TÃªt river valley (southern Pyrenees) was studied near the Villefranche-de-Conflent limestone gorge where 8 cave levels have been recognized over a vertical height of 600 meters. Given that 26Al/10Be cosmogenic burial dating in this setting was limited to the last ~5 Ma (Calvet et al., 2015), here we used the cosmogenic 10Be/21Ne method in order to restore a more complete chronology of valley incision (e.g. Balco & Shuster, 2009; McPhilipps et al., 2016). Burial age results for alluvial deposits from 12 caves document incision rates since the Langhian (~14 Ma). Preliminary results indicate a history of valley deepening in successive stages. The data show a regular incision rate of 70-80 mm/a from the Langhian to the Messinian\n\nGeophysical setting of the Wabash Valley fault system\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHildenbrand, T.G.; Ravat, D.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nInterpretation of existing regional magnetic and gravity data and new local high-resolution aeromagnetic data provides new insights on the tectonic history and structural development of the Wabash Valley Fault System in Illinois and Indiana. Enhancement of short-wavelength magnetic anomalies reveal numerous NW- to NNE-trending ultramafic dikes and six intrusive complexes (including those at Hicks Dome and Omaha Dome). Inversion models indicate that the interpreted dikes are narrow (???3 m), lie at shallow depths (500 km long and generally >50 km wide) and with deep basins (locally >3 km thick), the ancestral Wabash Valley faults express, in comparison, minor tectonic structures and probably do not represent a failed rift arm. There is a lack of any obvious relation between the Wabash Valley Fault System and the epicenters of historic and prehistoric earthquakes. Five prehistoric earthquakes lie conspicuously near structures associated with the Commerce geophysical lineament, a NE-trending magnetic and gravity lineament lying oblique to the Wabash Valley Fault System and possibly extending over 600 km from NE Arkansas to central Indiana.\n\nConservation genetics of the endangered Iberian steppe plant Ferula loscosii (Apiaceae).\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez-Collazos, E; CatalÃ¡n, P\n\n2008-07-01\n\nFerula loscosii (Lange) Willk (Apiaceae) is a threatened endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. The plant has a narrow and disjunct distribution in three regions, NE, C and SE Spain. Genetic variability within and among 11 populations from its natural distribution was assessed using allozymes. Intermediate levels of genetic diversity were detected in F. loscosii (P(99%) = 36.83; H(E) = 0.125; H(T) = 0.152). However, the highest genetic diversity (58%) corresponded to the threatened populations from SE and C Spain (H(T) = 0.169) rather than the more abundant and larger populations from NE Spain (Ebro valley) (H(T) = 0.122). Low to moderate levels of genetic structure were found among regional ranges (G(ST) = 0.134), and several statistical spatial correlation analyses corroborated substantial genetic differentiation among the three main regional ranges. However, no significant genetic differentiation was found among the NE Spain populations, except for a northernmost population that is geographically isolated. Outcrossing mating and other biological traits of the species could account for the maintenance of the present values of genetic diversity within populations. The existence of an ancestral late Tertiary wider distribution of the species in SE and C Spain, followed by the maintenance of different Quaternary refugia in these warmer areas, together with a more recent and rapid post-glacial expansion towards NE Spain, are arguments that could explain the low genetic variability and structure found in the Ebro valley and the higher levels of diversity in the southern Iberian populations.\n\nFour-year advanced monitoring program of polar pesticides in groundwater of Catalonia (NE-Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶ck-Schulmeyer, Marianne; Ginebreda, Antoni; Postigo, Cristina; Garrido, Teresa; Fraile, Josep; LÃ³pez de Alda, Miren; BarcelÃ³, DamiÃ\n\n2014-02-01\n\nPesticide contamination of groundwater is of paramount importance because it is the most sensitive and the largest body of freshwater in the European Union. In this paper, an isotopic dilution method based on on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography (electrospray)-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC(ESI)-MS/MS) was used for the analysis of 22 pesticides in groundwater. Results were evaluated from monitoring 112 wells and piezometers coming from 29 different aquifers located in 18 ground water bodies (GWBs), from Catalonia, Spain, for 4 years as part of the surveillance and operational monitoring programs conducted by the Catalan Water Agency. The analytical method developed allows the determination of the target pesticides (6 triazines, 4 phenylureas, 4 organophosphorous, 1 anilide, 2 chloroacetanilides, 1 thiocarbamate, and 4 acid herbicides) in groundwater with good sensitivity (limits of detection <5 ng/L), accuracy (relative recoveries between 85 and 116%, except for molinate), and repeatability (RSD<23%), and in a fully automated way. The most ubiquitous compounds were simazine, atrazine, desethylatrazine and diuron. Direct relation between frequency of detection of each target compound and Groundwater Ubiquity Score index (GUS index) is observed. Desethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine, metabolites of atrazine and simazine, respectively, presented the highest mean concentrations. Compounds detected in less than 5% of the samples were cyanazine, molinate, fenitrothion and mecoprop. According to the Directive 2006/118/EC, 13 pesticides have individual values above the requested limits (desethylatrazine, atrazine and terbuthylazine lead the list) and 14 samples have total pesticide levels above 500 ng/L. The GWB with the highest levels of total pesticides is located in Lleida (NE-Spain), with 9 samples showing total pesticide levels above 500 ng/L.

The study focused on atmospheric Hg and its incorporation in soils and lichens close to a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant (CAP), which has been operating since the end of the 19th century. Atmospheric Hg present in the area was characterized by means of seven total gaseous mercury (TGM) surveys carried out from 2007 to 2012. Surveys were carried out by car, walking, and at fixed locations, and covered an area of some 12Â km(2) (including the CAP area, the village in which workers live, Flix town, and the Sebes Wildlife Reserve). Finally, an atmospheric Hg dispersion model was developed with ISC-AERMOD software validated by a lichen survey of the area. The results for the atmospheric compartment seem to indicate that the Flix area currently has the highest levels of Hg pollution in Spain on the basis of the extremely high average concentrations in the vicinity of the CAP (229Â ngÂ m(-3)). Moreover, the Hg(0) plume affects Flix town center to some extent, with values well above the international thresholds for residential areas. Wet and dry Hg deposition reached its highest values on the banks of the Ebro River, and this contributes to increased soil contamination (range 44-12,900Â ngÂ g(-1), average 775Â ngÂ g(-1)). A good fit was obtained between anomalous areas indicated by lichens and the dispersion model for 1Â year.\n\nRegional soil geochemistry in the Ojailen Valley: a realm dominated by the industrial and mining city of Puertollano (South Central Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ³pez-Berdonces, Miguel; Fernandez-CalderÃ³n, Sergio; Higueras, Pablo; MarÃ­a EsbrÃ­, Jose; Gonzalez-Corrochano, BeatrÃ­z; GarcÃ­a-Noguero, Eva MÂª; MartÃ­nez-Coronado, Alba; GarcÃ­a-Noguero, Carolina\n\n2013-04-01\n\nRegional soil geochemistry in the OjailÃ©n Valley: a realm dominated by the industrial and mining city of Puertollano (South Central Spain).

OjailÃ©n Valley is situated in South Central of Spain, an area where livestock, agriculture, mining and industry coexist. This work tries to assess the relationships between these activities and local environmental compartments: water, soils and heavy metal contents, and establish the most appropriate methodology of sample treatment and analytical techniques that can be employed on this kind of studies. For soil geochemistry, 152 samples were taken at two different depths, one at surface layer and another at 20 cm depth, and establish relationships between them and the possible sources. For this purpose, we determine soil parameters (pH, conductivity and organic matter) and total metal contents by Energy Dispersion of X Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF). Samples with higher nickel contents were analyzed with Inductive Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) after acid digestion. The study of surface waters includes 18 samples along the river and tributaries near mining and industrial areas. Water analysis was performed by ICP-OES. Soil samples shows pH between 6 and 8.5, highest located near on the east part of the valley, in the vicinity of petrochemical complex. Conductivity values show higher levels (1600 ÂµS cmÂ¯Â¹) in the vicinity of Puertollano and the industrial sites. Local reference value (LRV) for contaminated soils were determined according to the methodology proposed by Jimenez-Ballesta et al. (2010), using the equation: LRV=GM + 2SD, where LRV: Local Reference Value, GM: Geometric Mean, SD: Standard Deviation\n\nEPA Region 1 - Map Layers for Valley ID Tool (Hosted Feature Service)\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThe Valley Service Feature Layer hosts spatial data for EPA Region 1's Valley Identification Tool.

Nevertheless, the increase is not equally distributed all over the world, varying from one region to others. Thus, it becomes interesting to study the evolution of temperature indices for a certain area in order to analyse the existence of climatic trend in it. In this work, monthly temperature time series from two Mediterranean areas are used: the Umbria region in Italy, and the Guadalquivir Valley in southern Spain. For the available stations, six temperature indices (three annual and three monthly) of mean, average maximum and average minimum temperature have been obtained, and the existence of trends has been studied by applying the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. Both regions show a general increase in all temperature indices, being the pattern of the trends clearer in Spain than in Italy. The Italian area is the only one at which some negative trends are detected. The presence of break points in the temperature series has been also studied by using the non-parametric Pettit test and the parametric standard normal homogeneity test (SNHT), most of which may be due to natural phenomena.\n\nPerfluoroalkyl substance contamination of the Llobregat River ecosystem (Mediterranean area, NE Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nCampo, Julian; PÃ©rez, Francisca; MasiÃ¡, Ana; PicÃ³, Yolanda; FarrÃ©, Marinel la; BarcelÃ³, DamiÃ\n\n2015-01-15\n\nThe occurrence and sources of 21 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs: C4-C14, C16, C18 carboxylate, C4, C6-C8 and C10 sulfonates and C8 sulfonamide) were determined in water, sediment, and biota of the Llobregat River basin (NE Spain). Analytes were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and determined by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC-QqQ-MS). All samples were contaminated with at least one PFAS, being the most frequently found perfluorobutanoate (PFBA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (L-PFOS). In general, mean PFAS concentrations measured in sediments (0.01-3.67 ng g(-1)) and biota (0.79-431 Î¼g kg(-1)) samples were higher than those found in water (0.01-233 ng L(-1)). L-PFOS presented very high levels in biota and water, particularly in the Anoia River where a maximum concentration of 2.71 Î¼g L(-1) was related to important industrial activities. However, this pollution does not extend down the Llobregat River according to cumulated values. None of the hazard quotients (HQ) calculated indicate potential risk for the different tropic levels considered (algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). According to Maximum Allowable Concentration (MAC) proposed by the European Commission (L-PFOS) and to Provisional Health Advisory (PHA) values (PFOA, L-PFOS) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), only two water samples exceeded PHA concentration for L-PFOS.

The RhÃ´ne River is emblematic of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) impact on landscape morphology. Along the edge of the Saint-RemÃ¨ze Plateau, the RhÃ´ne valley displays four benchmark levels generated by the MSC: the Pre-evaporitic abandonment surface (1), the Messinian erosional surface (2), the Marine/non-marine surface of the Pliocene ria (3) and the Pliocene abandonment surface (4). The study of these benchmark levels allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the regional base level over the last 6 Ma. We obtain a curve for base-level evolution that provides a geodynamic reference, which is used to investigate the morphogenesis of the Saint-RemÃ¨ze karstic plateau. The ArdÃ¨che River downcuts the Saint-RemÃ¨ze Plateau in a deep canyon, from Vallon-Pont-d'Arc to the West, to its confluence with the RhÃ´ne to the East. Several abandoned valleys are present along the western edge of the Saint-RemÃ¨ze Plateau at the inlet of the ArdÃ¨che canyon. In these abandoned valleys, the fluvial deposits are related to several periods, from the Pliocene onwards. They provide important insights into the fluvial dynamics: a 160 m-thick aggradation sequence infilled the ArdÃ¨che canyon during the Pliocene. This aggrading river caused the first lateral shifting, as an aggradation epigenesis. This first infilling shows that the ArdÃ¨che canyon already existed before the Pliocene. Secondly, it has been demonstrated that the ArdÃ¨che Canyon is downcut into the Pre-evaporitic surface of the Saint-RemÃ¨ze Plateau, dated to 5.45 Ma [Martini, J., 2005.

Combining geochemistry, mineralogy, ostracods, diatoms, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal and archaeo-historical datasets we reconstruct: 1) the transition of the lagoon from a marine to a marginal environment between ~3150 cal BC to the 17th century AD; 2) fluctuations in salinity; and 3) natural and anthropogenic forces contributing to these changes. From the Late Neolithic to the Medieval period the lagoon ecosystem was driven by changing marine influence and the land was mainly exploited for grazing, with little evidence for impact on the natural woodland. Land-use exploitation adapted to natural coastal dynamics, with maximum marine flooding hampering agropastoral activities between ~1550 and ~150 cal BC. In contrast, societies actively controlled the lagoon dynamics and become a major agent of landscape transformation after the Medieval period. The removal of littoral woodlands after the 8th century was followed by the expansion of agrarian and industrial activities. Regional mining and smelting activities polluted the lagoon with heavy metals from the ~11th century onwards. The expansion of the milling industry and of agricultural lands led to the channelization of the river Muga into the lagoon after ~1250 cal AD. This caused its transformation into a freshwater lake, increased nutrient load, and the infilling and drainage of a great part of the lagoon. By tracking the shift towards an anthropogenically-controlled system around ~750 yr ago, this study points out Mediterranean lagoons as ancient and heavily-modified systems, with anthropogenic impacts and controls covering multi-centennial and even millennial timescales.

Over the past 60 years, the Laguna de Gallocanta, an ephemeral lake situated in the closed Gallocanta basin, experienced a sequence of wet and dry phases. The lake and its surrounding wetlands are one of only a few bird sanctuaries left in NE-Spain for grey cranes on their annual migration from Scandinavia to northern Africa. Understanding the impact of climate change on basin hydrology is therefore of utmost importance for the appropriate management of the bird sanctuary. Changes in lake level are only weakly linked to annual rainfall, with reaction times between hours and months after rainfall. Both the total amount of rainfall over the reaction period, as well as individual extreme events, affect lake level. In this study the characteristics and frequencies of daily, event, monthly and bi-monthly rainfall over the past 60 years were analysed. The results revealed a clear link between increased frequencies of high magnitude rainfall and phases of water filling in the Laguna de Gallocanta. In the middle of the 20th century, the absolute amount of rainfall appears to have been more important for lake level, while more recently the frequency of high magnitude rainfall has emerged as the dominant variable. In the Gallocanta Basin, climate change and the distinct and continuing land use change since Spain joined the EU in 1986 have created an environment that is in a more or less constant state of transition. This highlights two challenges faced by hydrologists and climatologists involved in developing water management tools for the Gallocanta Basin in particular, but also other areas with sensitive and rapidly changing environments. Hydrologists have to understand the processes and the spatial and temporal patterns of surface-climate interaction in a watershed to assess the impact of climate change on its hydrology. Climatologists, on the other hand, have to develop climate models\n\nExtensional Structures on the Po Valley Side of the Northern Apennines\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBettelli, G.; Vannucchi, P.; Capitani, M.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nThe present-day tectonics of the Northern Apennines is characterized by extension in the inner Tyrrhenian side and compression in the outer Po Valley-Adriatic side. The boundary separating the two domains, extensional and compressional, is still largely undetermined and mainly based on geophysical data (focal mechanisms of earthquakes). Map-scale extensional structures have been studied only along the Tyrrhenian side of the Northern Apennines (Tuscany), while along the Po Valley-Adriatic area the field studies concentrated on compressional features. A new, detailed field mapping of the Po Valley side of the Northern Apennines carried out in the last ten years within the Emilia Romagna Geological Mapping Program has shown the presence of a large extensional fault crossing the high Bologna-Modena-Reggio Emilia provinces, from the Sillaro to the Val Secchia valleys. This Sillaro-Val Secchia Normal Fault (SVSNF) is NW-SE trending, NE dipping and about 80 km long. The age, based on the younger displaced deposits, is post-Miocene. The SVSNF is a primary regional structure separating the Tuscan foredeep units from the Ligurian Units in the south-east sector of the Northern Apennines, and it is responsible for the exhumation of the Tuscan foredeep units along the Apennine water divide. The sub-vertical, SW-NE trending faults, formerly interpreted as strike slip, are transfer faults associated to the extensional structure. A geological cross-section across the SVSNF testifies a former thickness reduction and lamination of the Ligurian Units, as documented in the field, in the innermost areas of the Bologna-Modena-Reggio Emilia hills, implying the occurrence of a former extensional fault. These data indicate that the NE side of the water divide has already gone under extension reducing the compressional domain to the Po Valley foothills and plain. They can also help in interpreting the complex Apennines kinematics.\n\nThe net effect of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in a semi-arid ecosystem NE Spain: implications for the management and restoration.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPueyo, Yolanda; Arroyo, Antonio I.; Saiz, Hugo; Alados, ConcepciÃ³n L.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nDegradation in arid and semiarid lands can be irreversible without human intervention, due to a positive plant-soil feedback where the loss of vegetation cover leads to soil degradation, which in turn hampers plant establishment. Human intervention in restoration actions usually involves the amendment of the degraded abiotic conditions, revegetation of bare areas, or both. However, abiotic amelioration is often expensive and too intrusive, and revegetation is not successful in many cases. Biotic interactions between plants, and more specifically facilitation by a \"nurse\" plant, have been proposed as a new via to take profit of improved abiotic conditions without intervention, and to increase the success rate of revegetation actions. But \"nurse\" plants can also interfere with others (i.e. by competition for resources or the release of allelopathic compounds), and the net balance between facilitation and interference could depend on plant types involved. We present recent observational and experimental studies performed in the semiarid ecosystems of the Middle Ebro Valley (NE Spain) about the role of abiotic conditions and biotic interactions in the productivity, dynamics and diversity of plant communities under different stress conditions (aridity and grazing). We found that all plant types studied (shrubs and perennial grasses) improved abiotic conditions (soil temperature and water availability for plants) with respect to open areas. However, only some shrubs (mainly Salsola vermiculata) had a positive net balance in the biotic interactions between plants, while other shrubs (Artemisia herba-alba) and perennial grasses (Lygeum spartum) showed interference with other plants.

Moreover, the characterization of these environments from ecological, biochemical and microbiological perspectives has become a key focus for many research groups all over the world over the last 20 years. In countries such as Spain, there are several examples of coastal solar salterns (mainly on the Mediterranean coast) and inland solar salterns, from which sodium chloride is obtained for human consumption. However, studies focused on the characterization of inland solar salterns are scarce and both the archaeal diversity and the plant communities inhabiting these environments remain poorly described. Results Two of the inland solar salterns (termed Redonda and Penalva), located in the Alto VinalopÃ³ Valley (Alicante, Spain), were characterized regarding their geological and physico-chemical characteristics and their archaeal and botanical biodiversity. A preliminary eukaryotic diversity survey was also performed using saline water. The chemical characterization of the brine has revealed that the salted groundwater extracted to fill these inland solar salterns is thalassohaline. The plant communities living in this environment are dominated by Sarcocornia fruticosa (L.) A.J. Scott, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum (Moris) K. Koch, Suaeda vera Forsk. ex Gmelin (Amaranthaceae) and several species of Limonium (Mill) and Tamarix (L). Archaeal diversity was analyzed and compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular phylogenetic techniques. Most of the sequences recovered from environmental DNA samples are affiliated with haloarchaeal genera such as Haloarcula, Halorubrum, Haloquadratum and Halobacterium, and with an unclassified member of the Halobacteriaceae. The eukaryote Dunaliella was also present in the samples. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first analysis centered on inland solar salterns located in the\n\n24.

Recent data on the lithostratigraphy of the evaporite sequence allow relating the alluvium thickenings with either halite or glauberite dissolution. The alluvium-filled dissolution basin underlying the youngest terraces (T8-T11) is ascribed to halite karstification; the top of a halite unit approximately 75 m thick is situated 40-15 m below the valley bottom. The thickenings of terrace (T1-T7) and pediment sediments are attributed to interstratal glauberite karstification: (1) Coincidence between the elevation range of the terraces and that of the glauberite-rich unit. Glauberite beds reach 30 and 100 m in single-bed and cumulative thickness, respectively. (2) The exposed bedrock underlying thickened alluvium shows abundant subsidence features indicative of interstratal karstification. The most common structure corresponds to hectometer-scale sag basins with superimposed collapses in the central sector of each basin. The subsided bedrock is frequently transformed into dissolution-collapse breccias showing a complete textural gradation, from crackle packbreccias to chaotic floatbreccias and karstic residues. (3) Paleokarst exposures show evidence of karstification confined to specific beds made up of secondary gypsum after precursory glauberite, partly dissolved and partly replaced. Despite the magnitude of the subsidence recorded by the thickened alluvium and unlike nearby tributaries, the terraces show a continuous and parallel arrangement indicating that the fluvial system was able to counterbalance subsidence by aggradation. A number of kilometer-size flat-bottom depressions have been developed in the valley margin, typically next to and inset into thickened terrace and pediment deposits. The subsidence structures exposed in artificial\n\nRecent climate trends and multisecular climate variability: temperature and precipitation during the cold season (October-March) in the Ebro Basin (NE of Spain) betrween 1500 and 2008\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaz-Sanchez, M.-A.; Cuadrat-Prats, J.-M.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nOne of the goals of Paleoclimatology is to assess the importance and the exceptional nature of recent climate trends related to the anthropogenic climate change. Instrumental data enable the analysis of last century's climate, but do not give any information on previous periods' precipitation and temperature, during which there was no anthropic intervention on the climate system. Dendroclimatology is one of the paleoclimatic reconstruction sources giving best results when it comes to reconstructing the climate of the time before instruments could be used. This work presents the reconstructed series of precipitation and temperature of the cold season (October-March) In the central sector of the Ebro Valley (NE of Spain). The chronologies used for the reconstruction come on the one hand from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) and on the other hand from the dendrochronological information bank created in the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula within the framework of the Spanish Interministerial Commission for Science and Technology (CICYT) CLI96-1862 project. The climate data used for chronology calibration and the reconstruction of the temperature and precipitation values are those of the instrumental observatory number 9910 (Pallaruelo) belonging to the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (Agencia Estatal de MeteorologÃ­a or AEMET), located in the central sector of the Ebro Valley. The reconstruction obtained covers the 1500-1990 period. In order to extend the series up to 2008, instrumental information has been used. Thanks to data from a set of AEMET instrumental observatories close to the one used for chronology calibration, a regional series of temperatures as well as a precipitation one were generated. The series reconstructed through dendroclimatic methods and the regional series do not show statistically significant differences in their mean and variance values. R values between both series exceed 0.85. Taking these statistical characteristics\n\nA database about the tornadic activity in Catalonia (NE Spain) since 1994\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorales, M. E.; ArÃºs, J.; Llasat, M. C.; CastÃ¡n, S.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nAlthough tornadic activity is not the most important hazard in Spain, the damages that tornadoes and downburst generate are considerable in urban areas, giving place in some occasions to casualties. In Spain, the oldest systematic works collecting data about tornadoes, refer to the Balearic Islands, although some series about tornadoes in Spain have also been collected and analysed (GayÃ , 2005). These series shows a positive increase that is probably more related to a change in the perception level of the population than to climatic change. In some occasions it is difficult to separate the damages produced by the tornado itself from those produced by other associated hazards like heavy rains, hail or a wind storms. It was the case of the September 2006 event, in which flash floods and tornadoes were recorded. In the same sense in some occasions, damages produced by a downsburt are confused with those that produced by a tornado. Having in mind all these facts, having a good systematic data base about tornadoes is necessary, before to obtain some conclusions not enough justified. This kind of database is not easy to obtain, because of it requires to have detailed information about damages, meteorological observations and testimonies that has to be filtered by a good quality control. After a general presentation about tornadoes and downsbursts in Mediterranean Region, this contribution presents the database that have affected Catalonia during the period 1994-2009, starting with the tornado recorded on the Espluga de FrancolÃ­ the 31 August 1994.This database has been built in basis to the AEMET information, the Consorcio de CompensaciÃ³n de Seguros (the insurance company of Spain for natural disasters), the newspapers and field visits to the affected places.\n\nPaleomagnetic data support Early Permian age for the Abor Volcanics in the lower Siang Valley, NE India: Significance for Gondwana-related break-up models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, Jason R.; Aitchison, Jonathan C.; Chik, Sam Y. S.; Baxter, Alan T.; Bryan, Scott E.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nConfusion exists as to the age of the Abor Volcanics of NE India. Some consider the unit to have been emplaced in the Early Permian, others the Early Eocene, a difference of Ë230 million years. The divergence in opinion is significant because fundamentally different models explaining the geotectonic evolution of India depend on the age designation of the unit. Paleomagnetic data reported here from several exposures in the type locality of the formation in the lower Siang Valley indicate that steep dipping primary magnetizations (mean = 72.7 Â± 6.2Â°, equating to a paleo-latitude of 58.1Â°) are recorded in the formation. These are only consistent with the unit being of Permian age, possibly Artinskian based on a magnetostratigraphic argument. Plate tectonic models for this time consistently show the NE corner of the sub-continent >50Â°S; in the Early Eocene it was just north of the equator, which would have resulted in the unit recording shallow directions. The mean declination is counter-clockwise rotated by Ë94Â°, around half of which can be related to the motion of the Indian block; the remainder is likely due local Himalayan-age thrusting in the Eastern Syntaxis. Several workers have correlated the Abor Volcanics with broadly coeval mafic volcanic suites in Oman, NE Pakistan-NW India and southern Tibet-Nepal, which developed in response to the Cimmerian block peeling-off eastern Gondwana in the Early-Middle Permian, but we believe there are problems with this model. Instead, we suggest that the Abor basalts relate to India-Antarctica/India-Australia extension that was happening at about the same time. Such an explanation best accommodates the relevant stratigraphical and structural data (present-day position within the Himalayan thrust stack), as well as the plate tectonic model for Permian eastern Gondwana.\n\nClassification and statistical analysis of mine spoils chemical composition from Oliete basin (Teruel, NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeseguer, S.; Sanfeliu, T.; JordÃ¡n, M. M.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nThe Oliete basin (Early Cretaceous, NE Teruel, Spain) is one of the most important areas for the supply of mine spoils used as ball clays for the production of white and red stoneware in the Spanish ceramic industry of wall and floor tiles. This study corresponds to the second part of the paper published recently by Meseguer et al. (Environ Geol 2008) about the use of mine spoils from Teruel coal mining district. The present study shows a statistical data analysis from chemical data (major, minor and trace elements). The performed statistical analysis of chemical data included descriptive statistics and cluster analysis (with ANOVA and ScheffÃ© methods). The cluster analysis of chemical data provided three main groups: C3 with the highest mean SiO2 content (66%) and lowest mean Al2O3 content (20%); C2 with lower SiO2 content (48%) and higher mean Al2O3 content (28%); and C1 with medium values for the SiO2 and Al2O3 mean content. The main applications of these materials are refractory, white and red ceramics, stoneware, heavy ceramics (including red earthenware, bricks and roof tiles), and components of white Portland cement and aluminous cement. Clays from group 2 are used in refractories (with higher kaolinite content, and constrictions to CaO + MgO and K2O + Na2O contents). All materials can be used in fine ceramics (white or red, according to the Fe2O3 + TiO2 content).\n\nSediment discharge of the rivers of Catalonia, NE Spain, and the influence of human impacts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiquete, Camino; Canals, Miquel; Ludwig, Wolfgang; Arnau, Pedro\n\n2009-03-01\n\nSummaryThe environmental and anthropogenic factors controlling sediment delivery to the sea are numerous, intricate and usually difficult to quantify. Mediterranean watersheds are historically amongst the most heavily impacted by human activities in the world. This study analyzes some of these factors for nine river systems from Catalonia, NE Spain, that open into the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, and discusses the results obtained from sediment yield models and sediment concentration data series. General models indicate that the natural suspended sediment yield by individual Catalan rivers ranged within a fork from 94 to 621 t km -2 yr -1. Such a sediment yield would be noticeably reduced (moving the fork to 7-148 t km -2 yr -1) because of lithological factors and direct anthropogenic and, possibly, climatic impacts. Damming, water extraction and urbanization appear as the most important direct anthropogenic impacts in Catalonia. Water discharge and sediment concentration measurements by basin authorities provide much lower sediment yield estimations, from 0.4 to 19.8 t km -2 yr -1, which is probably due to the lack of measured sediment loads during flood events, as it is the case in many other Mediterranean rivers. The Catalan watersheds have some of the smallest runoff values amongst Mediterranean rivers. Of the nine river systems studied, water discharge tends to decrease in two and to increase in one. The other six river systems do not show any clear tendency. Related to climatic parameters, temperature raised in all the watersheds between 1961 and 1990, while precipitation did not show significant trends.\n\nRegistration of NE Trailblazer C-1, NE Trailblazer C0, NE Trailblazer C2, NE Trailblazer C3, NE Trailblazer C4, and NE Trailblazer C5 Switchgrass Germplasms\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nNE Trailblazer C-1 (GP-101, PI 672015), NE Trailblazer C0 (GP-100, PI 672014), NE Trailblazer C2 (GP-102, PI 672016), NE Trailblazer C3 (GP-103, PI 672017), NE Trailblazer C4 (GP-104, PI 672018), and NE Trailblazer C5 (GP-105, PI 672019) switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) germplasms were released by ...\n\nHillslope terracing effects on the spatial variability of plant development as assessed by NDVI in vineyards of the Priorat region (NE Spain).\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-Casasnovas, JosÃ© A; Ramos, MarÃ­a ConcepciÃ³n; Espinal-UtgÃ©s, SÃ­lvia\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe availability of heavy machinery and the vineyard restructuring and conversion plans of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (Commission Regulation EC no. 1227/2000 of 31 May 2000) have encouraged the restructuring of many vineyards on hillslopes of Mediterranean Europe, through the creation of terraces to favor the mechanization of agricultural work. Terrace construction requires cutting and filling operations that create soil spatial variability, which affects soil properties and plant development. In the present paper, we study the effects of hillslope terracing on the spatial variability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in fields of the Priorat region (NE Spain) during 2004, 2005, and 2006. This index was computed from high-resolution remote sensing data (Quickbird-2). Detailed digital terrain models before and after terrace construction were used to assess the earth movements. The results indicate that terracing by heavy machinery induced high variability on the NDVI values over the years, showing significant differences as effect of the cut and fill operations.\n\nHercynian Pb-Zn mineralization types in the Alcudia Valley mining district (Spain) and their reflect in Pb isotopic signatures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcÃ­a de Madinabeitia, S.; Santos Zalduegui, J. F.; Palero, F.; Gil Ibarguchi, J. I.; Carracedo, M.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nMore than 450 ore deposits indexed within the Alcudia Valley of the Central-Iberian Zone (Spain) may be grouped by their tectonic and lithologic characteristics (1,2) as follows: type A of rare stratabound mineralizations, and types B, C, D and E represented by abundant Hercynian veins (post-Namurian). 86 new Pb isotope analyses of galenas from the four vein types reveal that types B and C have similar isotopic ratios with values of Î¼_2 = 10.07, Ï_2 = 40.6 and a mean model age of 564 Ma. Types D and E have Î¼_2 and Ï_2 values of 9.79 and 38.5, respectively, but differ each other with respect to their model ages, 600 Ma (type D) and 335 Ma (type E). The observed variations appear to be related to the geochemical features of the metasedimentary host-rocks of the mineralizations where two distinct types of Pb isotopic ratios have been reported (3): one with Î¼_2 and Ï_2 comparable to those of the D and E types and another with a more radiogenic composition, close to those of the B and C types of galenas. NÃ¤gler et al. have suggested partial rehomogeneization of Pb isotopic composition within the metasediments at ca. 330 Ma, that is, prior to the mineralization events, but the extent of this process and its effects on the ore bodies isotopic features is not evident. The origin of the more abundant E type ore bodies has been related to the Hercynian granitic rocks in the area (2, and references therein). Other plutons within this sector of the Central Iberian Zone (e.g., Linares, etc.; cf. accompanying Abstract) associate ore bodies whose Pb isotopic composition is very similar to that of the E type galenas from the Alcudia Valley. The isotopic data obtained thus point to a related or common source material for the various types of granites within the area studied. Yet, the Pb isotopic composition of other mineralizations (B, C, D), likewise located in Hercynian veins, allow to consider different types of Pb-Zn ore bodies and point therefore to different sources of\n\nDistribution of Thorium, Cesium, Yttrium and Zirconium in Alfisol pedons in the Catalan Coastal Range (NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBech, J.; Rustullet, J.; Tume, P.; Roca, N.; Tobias, F. J.; GarrigÃ³, J.; Reverter, F.; SÃ¡nchez, P.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to estimate the concentrations and vertical distributions of Th, Ce, Y, and Zr in eleven Alfisol pedons from the NE Garraf Coastal massif (Catalonia, NE Spain). These soils were developed mainly on Mesozoic limestones. The concentrations were determined by XRF and the results were then compared to soil properties (pH, organic carbon content, CaCO3, particle size distribution and Fe forms: total iron, Fet, dithionite-extractable iron, Fed and oxalate-extractable iron,Feo). The range of Th values is: min 3 mgkg-1, max 16 mgkg-1, mean 10.4 mgkg-1 and median 11 mgkg-1. The range of Ce values is: min 22 mgkg-1, max 116 mgkg-1, mean 73.9 mgkg-1 and median 76 mgkg-1. The range of Y values is: min 10 mgkg-1, max 43 mgkg-1, mean 27.5 mgkg-1 and median 27 mgkg-1. The range of Zr values is: min 101 mgkg-1, max 418 mgkg-1, mean 253 mgkg-1 and median 252 mgkg-1. The Th concentrations obtained are similar to world soil and NASC values. These concentration data of Th, Ce, Y and Zr were correlated with each other and with the soil properties. Th correlates positively with Ce (0.95), Y (0.92), Zr (0.80), Fet (0.75), Fed (0.85) and Fed-Feo (0.85), clay% (0.55) and silt% (0.31) and negatively with sand% and CaCO3. The correlations do not indicate any significant relationship between Th and organic carbon or Feo. The ranking of the horizons by Th concentration is: BC hor. (12.5 mgkg-1), Bt hor. (11 mgkg-1), A hor. (10.1 mgkg-1) and finally C horizons (7.2 mgkg-1). The ranking of the Alfisols by Th concentration, taking into account the litology is: those derived from limestones (14.5 mgkg-1), those derived from schists (12.5 mgkg-1), those originated over dolomites (11.8 mgkg-1), those developed over Pleistocene colluvium (9.2 mgkg-1) and finally those originated over Keuper marls (6 mgkg-1).\n\nSoil-plant abstract of heavy metals in Pb-Zn mining sites from Alcudia Valley (South Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLÃ³pez-Berdonces, Miguel; Higueras, Pablo; EsbrÃ­, Jose Maria; GonzÃ¡lez-Corrochano, BeatrÃ­z; GarcÃ­a-Noguero, Eva MÂª; MartÃ­nez-Coronado, Alba; Fernandez-CalderÃ³n, Sergio; GarcÃ­a-Noguero, Carolina\n\n2013-04-01\n\nSoil-plant transfer of heavy metals in Pb-Zn mining sites from Alcudia Valley (South Spain).

Manuel Meca, 1. 13400 AlmadÃ©n, Spain. Alcudia Valley is a vast territory recently declared Natural Park, located in South of Spain. It is an area rich in mineral deposits of Zn and Pb and mining exists since the first millennium BC., having its highest ore production between mid-nineteenth century and the middle of the twentieth. This area has been selected because has more than 120 abandoned mines without remediation actions, with dumps and tailings with high contents of zinc and lead sulfides, and Cu, Ag, Cd, As, Sb in minor concentrations. In this study we determinate the transfer rate of these metals from soils to plants represented by oak leaves (Quercus ilex), because this specie is common within the selected area. To evaluate the soil-plant transfer were studied the correlation of contents, total and extractable, in soil-leaves. Extractable fraction was done by for different methods in water, EPA 1312 sulfuric acid: nitric acid 60:40 v., Ammonium Acetate and EDTA. To establish the correlation between heavy metals from soils to plants is necessary to know the contents of these and bioavailable content in soil. Three areas (S. QuintÃ­n, Romanilla, Bombita) were selected, taking 24 samples of soils and leaves. Analyzed leaves by XRF showed that Mn, Pb, Zn and Mo in S.Quintin and Romanilla, Mn, Pb in Bombita, exceeded the toxicity threshold. The same samples analyzed by ICP show us the toxicity threshold is exceeded Pb, Zn and Hg in S.Quintin, and Pb in Romanilla. The heavy metal content in leaves compared between two techniques analytical gives an acceptable correlation Zn - Pb\n\nSpatial and temporal variability of PM levels and composition in a complex summer atmospheric scenario in Barcelona (NE Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nViana, M.; PÃ©rez, C.; Querol, X.; Alastuey, A.; Nickovic, S.; Baldasano, J. M.\n\nSummer atmospheric coastal dynamics exert a significant influence on the levels and composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) in the North-Eastern Iberian Peninsula. Summer atmospheric scenarios in this region present a high degree of complexity as they are characterised by the absence of synoptic-scale air mass advections, the development of breeze circulations, enhanced photochemistry, local mineral dust re-suspension and the occurrence of African dust outbreaks. Three sampling sites were selected in Barcelona (NE Spain), an urban coastal site surrounded by complex topography. Regional dust modelling (DREAM) and high resolution meteorological modelling (MM5) were used to interpret PM levels and composition at the three sites. The results outline the effect of breeze dynamics and thermal internal boundary layer formation as the main meteorological drivers of the hourly evolution of PM levels. Levels of crustal components, secondary inorganic and carbon species are higher during the night, and only the marine aerosol content is higher during the day. Nitrate levels are higher during the night due to the thermal stability on NH 4NO 3. Sulphate levels are higher during the night as a consequence of the drainage flows. Lidar measurements and model results signalled the occurrence of two African dust episodes during the study period which mainly affected the free troposphere over Barcelona.\n\nThe beginning of the Buntsandstein cycle (Early-Middle Triassic) in the Catalan Ranges, NE Spain: Sedimentary and palaeogeographic implications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGalÃ¡n-AbellÃ¡n, BelÃ©n; LÃ³pez-GÃ³mez, JosÃ©; Barrenechea, JosÃ© F.; Marzo, Mariano; De la Horra, RaÃºl; Arche, Alfredo\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe Early-Middle Triassic siliciclastic deposits of the Catalan Ranges, NE Spain, are dominated by aeolian sediments indicating a predominance of arid climate during this time span, in sharp contrast with the coeval fluvial sediments found in the Castilian Branch of the Iberian Ranges, 300 km to the SW. The NE-SW-oriented Catalan Basin evolved during the Middle-Late Permian as the result of widespread extension in the Iberian plate. This rift basin was bounded by the Pyrenees, Ebro and MontalbÃ¡n-Oropesa highs. The Permian-Early Triassic-age sediments of the Catalan Basin were deposited in three isolated subbasins (Montseny, Garraf, Prades), separated by intrabasinal highs, but linked by transversal NW-SE oriented faults. The three subbasins show evidence of diachronic evolution with different subsidence rates and differences in their sedimentary records. The Buntsandstein sedimentary cycle started in the late Early Triassic (Smithian-Spathian) in the central and southern domains (Garraf and Prades), with conglomerates of alluvial fan origin followed by fluvial and aeolian sandstones. Source area of the fluvial sediments was nearby Paleozoic highs to the north and west, in contrast with the far-away source areas of the fluvial sediments in the Iberian Ranges, to the SW. These fluvial systems were interacting with migrating aeolian dune fields located towards the S, which developed in the shadow areas behind the barriers formed by the Paleozoic highs. These highs were separating the subbasins under arid and semi-arid climate conditions. The dominating winds came from the east where the westernmost coast of the Tethys Sea was located, and periods of water run-off and fields of aeolian dunes development alternated. Some of the fluvial systems were probably evaporating as they were mixed into the interdune areas, never reaching the sea. From the end of the Smithian to the Spathian, the Catalan Basin and neighbour peri-Tethys basins of the present-day southern France\n\nHydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater in Kashmir Valley, India\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJeelani, G. H.; Shah, Rouf Ahmad; Hussain, Aadil\n\n2014-06-01\n\nGroundwater samples ( n = 163) were collected across Kashmir Valley in 2010 to assess the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater in shallow and deep aquifers and its suitability for domestic, agriculture, horticulture, and livestock purposes. The groundwater is generally alkaline in nature. The electrical conductivity (EC) which is an index to represent the total concentration of soluble salts in water was used to measure the salinity hazard to crops as it reflects the TDS in groundwater ranging from 97 to 1385 Î¼S/cm, except one well in Sopore. The average concentration of major ions was higher in shallow aquifers than in deeper aquifers. In general, Ca2+ is the dominant cation and HCO the dominant anion. Ca-HCO3, Mg-HCO3, Ca-Mg-HCO3, Na-HCO3 were the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. High concentration of HCO3 and pH less than 8.8 clearly indicated that intense chemical weathering processes have taken place in the study area. The groundwater flow pattern in the area follows the local surface topography which not only modifies the hydrogeochemical facies but also controls their distribution. The groundwater in valley flows into four directions, i.e., SW-NE, NE-W, SE-NW and SE-NE directions. The results suggest that carbonate dissolution is the dominant source of major ions followed by silicate weathering and ion-exchange processes. The concentrations of all the major ions determined in the present study are within the permissible limits of WHO and BIS standards. The results of Total Hardness, SAR, Na%, Kelly Index, USDA classification, Magnesium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, and PI suggested that groundwater is good for drinking, livestock, and irrigation purposes.\n\nComparison of the triple-point temperatures of {sup 20}Ne, {sup 22}Ne and normal Ne\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNakano, T.; Tamura, O.; Nagao, K.\n\n2013-09-11\n\nAt the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), the triple points of {sup 20}Ne and {sup 22}Ne were realized using modular sealed cells, Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22, made by the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Italy. The difference of the triple-point temperatures of {sup 20}Ne and {sup 22}Ne was estimated by using the sub-range of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) calibrated by NMIJ on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). The melting curves obtained with the Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22 cells show narrow widths (0.1 mK) over a wide range of the inverse of the melted fraction (1/F) frommoreÂ Â» 1/F=1 to 1/F=10. The liquidus point T{sub tp} estimated by the melting curves from Fâ¼0.5 to Fâ¼0.85 using the Ec8Ne22 is 0.146 29 (4) K higher than that using the Ec3Ne20 cell, which is in good agreement with that observed by INRiM using the same cells. After correction of the effect of impurities and other isotopes for Ec3Ne20 and Ec8Ne22 cells, the difference of T{sub tp} between pure {sup 20}Ne and pure {sup 22}Ne is estimated to be 0.146 61 (4) K, which is consistent with the recent results reported elsewhere. The sub-ranges of SPRTs computed by using the triple point of {sup 20}Ne or {sup 22}Ne realized by the Ec3Ne20 cell or the Ec8Ne22 cell in place of the triple point of Ne for the defining fixed point of the ITS-90 are in good agreement with those realized on the basis of the ITS-90 at NMIJ within 0.03 mK, which is much smaller than the non-uniqueness and the sub-range inconsistency of SPRTs.Â«Â less\n\nClimatic implications of the Quaternary fluvial tufa record in the NE Iberian Peninsula over the last 500 ka\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSancho, Carlos; Arenas, Concha; VÃ¡zquez-Urbez, Marta; Pardo, Gonzalo; Lozano, MarÃ­a Victoria; PeÃ±a-MonnÃ©, JosÃ© Luis; Hellstrom, John; Ortiz, JosÃ© Eugenio; OsÃ¡car, MarÃ­a Cinta; AuquÃ©, Luis; Torres, Trinidad\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe drainage area of the Iberian Ranges (NE Spain) houses one of the most extensive Quaternary fluvial tufaceous records in Europe. In this study, tufa deposits in the AÃ±amaza, Mesa, Piedra and EbrÃ³n river valleys were mapped, stratigraphically described and chronologically referenced from U/Th disequilibrium series, amino acid racemization and radiocarbon methods. Tufa deposits accumulated in cascades, barrage-cascades and related damming areas developed in stepped fluvial systems. The maximum frequency of tufa deposition was identified at 120 ka (Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage [MIS] 5e), 102 ka (MIS 5c), 85 ka ( MIS 5a) and 7 ka (MIS 1), probably under warmer and wetter conditions than today. Additional phases of tufa deposition appear at 353 ka ( end of MIS 11), 258-180 ka (MIS 7) and 171-154 ka (MIS 6). Although most tufa deposition episodes are clearly correlated with interstadial periods, the occurrence of tufa deposits during the penultimate glaciation (MIS 6) is remarkable, indicating that the onset of this stage was climatically favourable in the Iberian Peninsula. Biostatic conditions and the dynamics of karstic systems regulating tufa deposition seem to be sensitive to the precipitation regime, controlled by shifts in the position of North Atlantic atmospheric belts, and summer insolation, regulated by orbital forcing.\n\nPerformance comparison of NE213 detectors for their application in moisture measurement\n\nPubMed\n\nNaqvi; Nagadi; Rehman; Kidwai\n\n2000-10-01\n\nThe pulse shape discrimination (PSD) characteristic and neutron detection efficiency of NE213 detectors have been measured for their application in moisture measurements using 252Cf and 241Am-Be sources. In PSD studies, neutron peak to valley (Pn/V) ratio and figure of merit M were measured at four different bias values for cylindrical 50, 125 and 250 mm diameter NE213 detectors. The result of this study has shown that better PSD performance with the NE213 detector can be achieved with a smaller volume detector in conjunction with a neutron source with smaller gamma-ray/neutron ratio. The neutron detection efficiency of the 125 mm diameter NE213 detector for 241Am-Be and 252Cf source spectra was determined at 0.85, 1.25 and 1.75 MeV bias energies using the experimental neutron detection efficiency data of the same detector over 0.1-10 MeV energy range. Due to different energy spectra of the 241Am-Be and 252Cf sources, integrated efficiency of the 125 mm diameter NE213 detector for the two sources shows bias dependence. At smaller bias, 252Cf source has larger efficiency but as the bias is increased, the detector has larger efficiency for 241Am-Be source. This study has revealed that NE213 detector has better performance (such as PSD and neutron detection efficiency) in simultaneous det"
