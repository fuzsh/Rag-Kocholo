        "text": "Want your wedding ceremony to go without a hitch?! Read on for some essential tips which will ensure it‚Äôs seamless: 1. Bridal party: leave plenty of time for you all to get into your dresses (aim to start at least an hour before your ceremony time) to avoid any last minute rushing and to allow for final tweaks to hair, veil and accessories. This is especially true if you are having a Church or registrar led ceremony as they work to strict schedules! 2. Traditionally, grooms face forward as the bride enters. However, feel free to steal a glance if you can‚Äôt resist! Some guests enjoy watching the groom‚Äôs reaction, but don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt shed a tear ‚Äì it‚Äôs not obligatory. If you do get emotional, have a handkerchief handy (This insight comes from personal experience, as my husband and I both needed one!) 3. Brides, remember to walk down the aisle slower than you think ‚Äì savour the moment and give your photographer and videographer ample time to capture every detail. The same applies to bridesmaids; ensure they maintain a suitable distance between each other 4. Carry your bouquet at waist height with the flowers facing outward 5. Prior to the ceremony, ask your registrar/celebrant/vicar to step aside for your first kiss for it to be beautifully captured 6. Walk back down the aisle as a married couple at a relaxed pace, allowing your guests to shower you with confetti (thrown upwards, not towards you!). Perhaps pause midway for another kiss ‚Äì it could result in a stunning photo. If all of this feels overwhelming, consider hiring a planner to ensure everything goes smoothly - we can also make sure your dress train looks perfect as you take those first steps!
