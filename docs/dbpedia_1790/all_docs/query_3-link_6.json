        "text": "When it comes to bridal styling, it’s often said your wedding veil should accentuate your bridal look and not distract from your wedding dress. We generally agree to this. But, there’s always exceptions. For a lot of brides, the look comes down to their veil and they then choose their dress that best showcases their statement accessory.\n\nBut let’s be honest: there’s no rule book. Yes, there are traditions and conventions to be respected. For example, some religious and cultural customs require brides to cover their shoulders if they wed in a church. There are also certain symbolic colours that are best avoided. But beyond the walls of religious institutions and family/cultural traditions, brides today have more freedom than previous generations to be expressive and showcase their own style on their wedding day.\n\nBefore we can explore how to style a dramatic veil, let’s explore how to choose the right veil in the first instance.\n\nYou might have chosen a dramatic wedding dress and you’re looking for a simple veil to complete the look. Or, your style might be minimal which allows room for expression where your veil is the perfect piece to capture your essence of your style and personality.\n\nA cathedral length veil is all about regal appeal but you don’t need to have an extra long veil to create an impact. A short veil combined with handcrafted details, such as the WEEPING CHERRY veil, can be just as dramatic as a heavily embellished long veil as seen in our NIGHT GARDEN, ATHENA or RIVIERA veils.\n\nYour veil should complement your wedding dress without overpowering it. Consider the style, shape and details on your wedding dress.\n\nTry to define your bridal style with a few words. Free-spirited, relaxed and fashion forward? Or modern, clean and high end? If you’re struggling to find the words to best describe the vision you have in your head, a Pinterest board will help you gather your thoughts and better understand your vision.\n\nAs a general guide, your veil should accentuate and be proportional to your dress. When it comes to statement veils, we like to pair them with simpler silhouettes so that they doesn’t overpower or take away from the details of the dress.\n\nThe details on your wedding dress:\n\nIt’s important to consider the placement of any defining details on your wedding dress. Look for any focal points on the dress to ensure that the veil doesn’t interrupt the flow or details of the dress. Some things to consider include:\n\nAre the embellishments on the dress mainly on the bodice, straps, on the skirt or all over?\n\nWhere is the main structural focal point on the dress? Is it a dramatic neckline, a low back or extravagant train that draws your eyes.\n\nDoes the dress feature a variety of embellishments such as flowers, lace, sequins and hand-beading?\n\nOr all of the above?\n\nWe love the look of a veil where it falls where a focal point begins, for example a defined waist line. Where the defined horizontal line is at the hip, we recommend choosing a shorter or longer veil so it doesn’t visually cut you in half and interrupt the flow of your look.\n\nColour coordination:\n\nEnsure your veil is a complementary colour to your wedding dress. Very few wedding dresses are actually white. Most are shades of off-white, light ivory or warm ivory."
