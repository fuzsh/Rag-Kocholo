We are a group dedicated to improving Wikipedia's coverage of listings on ghost towns throughout the world.\n\nImprove Wikipedia's coverage of listings on ghost towns.\n\nCreate guidelines for ghost town articles.\n\nDetermine guidelines for article creation and notability of individuals and companies affiliated with ghost towns.\n\nThe project covers all articles about ghost towns and defunct settlements. This is to include any towns or municipalities which were absorbed by another entity. Though the popular image (and the images to the right) are of ghost towns in the Western United States there are myriad defunct settlements and ghost towns in the eastern half of the U.S. as well. Ghost towns exist worldwide, in the classical \"old west\" sense as well as in the non-traditional sense, e.g. cities abandoned because of wars. This project will strive to be all-inclusive. This page should be revamped, be bold, and the U.S. stuff put into its own division. Other division should be created as interest merits. The division pages should be like so: Wikipedia:WikiProject Ghost towns/United States, Wikipedia:WikiProject Ghost towns/Canada, Wikipedia:WikiProject Ghost towns/Australia etc. The pages should be structured after this main page, ah yes, copy and paste, for the sake of consistency.\n\nOur main categories for this project are:\n\nCategory:Ghost towns\n\nCategory:WikiProject Ghost towns articles\n\nSee also, a list of all subpages of this page.\n\nPlease feel free to add yourself here, and to indicate any areas of particular interest, state, territory, country.\n\nAudi1merc2: Ghost towns in Europe\n\nWstock70: Central Illinois\n\nDan Tromedlov: Mississippi, Florida\n\nUser:Transity: Arizona.\n\nCrazyjae: Arizona.\n\nronbo76: California.\n\nPlazak: Colorado\n\nEbyabe: Florida.\n\nDeelzbub: Georgia, USA\n\nDrewfountain: Georgia, USA\n\nfiwar:Western Pennsylvania\n\nHuwmanbeing: Indiana and Illinois.\n\nChupper: Illinois.\n\nElle: Kansas, Oklahoma\n\nTiebelex: Minnesota\n\nGeologyguy: Montana.\n\nMauraWen: California, Nevada\n\nmrmcdonnell: Centralia, PA\n\nIvoShandor: Texas, Illinois.\n\nGnangarra : Western Australia\n\nPete Tillman: AZ, NM, NV\n\nTamás Kádár: Hungary, Budapest (I'm interested in Lake Aral's Ghost towns)\n\nNtsimp: Utah.\n\nSaint Jimmy: Western USA, esp.

A more detailed discussion will be taking place here, for ideas on improving any of the following.\n\nArticles should include: Map and external link, as well as coordinate information at the top right of the page. information as any other settlement on Wikipedia would.\n\nThis code may help for US cities. I have included an arbitrary example, fill in the coordinates of the settlement your article is about:\n\n{{Geolinks-US-cityscale|42.0336383|-88.9356512}}\n\nBasically, I like to follow conventions that seem to have become the norm on Wikipedia regarding cities, villages, towns and other municipalities.\n\nLike so:\n\nIntro\n\nThe intro should have basic information. Place name, county, state, founding if known and any other important info that needs to be top loaded.\n\n==History==\n\nAny history section should be more than mere speculation if possible. Cite reliable sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources\n\n==Geography==\n\nThis section should always contain the coordinates, as accurately as possible. Use the following:\n\nEsmond is located at {{coor dms|42|02|01|N|88|56|08|W|city}} (42.0336383, -88.9356512){{GR|3}}.\n\n==Demographics==\n\nThis section is often the hardest to know to any real degree of accuracy when dealing with ghost towns. Sometimes places will be near ghost towns or ghost towns and still have some available U.S. Census data, it's good to just check anyway. Any information must also be sourced and referenced in this section.\n\n==See also==\n\nAny pertinent internal links that weren't (preferably) linked in the article.\n\nUse this code: {{Geolinks-US-cityscale|42.0336383|-88.9356512}}\n\nArticles should be named as any other settlement would be, e.g. (Place name, State/Territory name). In cases where there is more than one place in the same state/territory/province etc. with the same name, include the county, country, township or other higher identifying incorporaion, e.g. (Place name, State name (County name)).\n\nFor free-license historic photographs to illustrate your USA ghost town article, the best place to start is the Historic American Buildings Survey and Historic American Engineering Record:\n\nSearch HABS/HAER\n\nOther photo resources:\n\nUNR, Nevada photos, not all free, most OK for fair use.\n\nWestern Nevada Historic Photo Collection\n\nThe most important open task you can participate in is what is happening at the Article guidelines talk page, make sure you check the open questions first, then chime in. We need consensus and quickly if we are going to get the initial tasks and organization completed.\n\nSee also: /Assessment\n\nElcor, Minnesota (TFA for March 18, 2018)\n\nManganese, Minnesota (TFA for October 16, 2021)\n\nMonte Ne (TFA for July 24, 2017)\n\nPithole, Pennsylvania (TFA for April 9, 2011)\n\nRhyolite, Nevada (TFA for September 28, 2012)\n\nRosewood massacre (TFA for August 4, 2009}\n\nThistle, Utah (TFA for April 17, 2013)\n\nSilver Reef, Utah\n\n...that Providence, Ohio became a ghost town in the mid-nineteenth century after suffering both a catastrophic fire and a cholera epidemic?
