        "text": "Pre lace your corset to save time the day of (if you have one).\n\nKnowing how to bustle the train is important. Please ensure someone in your wedding party is an expert!\n\nRemind your bridesmaids to try on their dresses and to get them tailored if needed. I had a size 4 bridesmaid accidentally given a size 10 dress, which she noticed the morning of (yikes!).\n\nI am going to sound like my mom here, but make sure that everyone can sit/walk in their dresses and wears the right undergarment (nothing peeking through or visible through fabric).\n\nBring backup wedges/flats for the reception so you are not in your heels all day –your feet will thank you!\n\nBreak in your shoes by wearing them in the days leading to your wedding day. Wear them (when cooking, for example) with men's thick white socks. It'll break them in and make even the most uncomfortable shoes bearable.\n\nTypically you want to begin the alteration process two months prior to the wedding day. Some clients have gone four times total: initial consult, initial fitting, fitting after additional adjustments, final fitting and pickup.\n\nThese services can run late. Tell your HMUA providers that you need to be done 30-45 minutes earlier than you really do. If they are on time, great! You can relax and enjoy the extra time.\n\nPlease make sure that you are happy with your hair, makeup, nails, attire, and anything else the day of.\n\nI highly encourage you to do a makeup trial. That way you know exactly what you will be getting the day of your wedding.\n\nAlso, inform your hair artist of any veil or hair pieces you plan to wear the day of your wedding. This will help them craft an appropriate hairstyle AND tell you how to place it later if needed.\n\nWear a similar neckline and color to your dress so that you can get a feel for what it will all look together.\n\nSuggestion: schedule an engagement session and dinner right after your trial.\n\nPack a mini makeup kit. If your HMUA will provide you with one, ask what is in it.\n\nBring your own chapstick/lipstick/translucent powder (many clients have wished they had the one brand they loved instead of what they were given). Between ceremony and reception is a great time to touch up your makeup.\n\nPricing varies with experience and the quality of the products used. Many clients have spent $350-800 for both bridal hair and makeup in Orange County and Los Angeles.\n\nWe, photographers, dread the line “You can photoshop that, right?” No, not when your tan line will show in 300 photos and fixing it takes 3-5 minutes per photo (that would be at least 15 hours of additional work).\n\nAny retouching request will incur a $15 fee per photo. I will, however, select a few photos at my discretion for complimentary retouching service.\n\nI strongly recommend you and your loved one get ready in separate rooms at the same location.\n\nIf you will be staying outside your home, have a designated spot for keys (or a dedicated person to hold them). These have a tendency to get misplaced!\n\nConsider taking water bottles, snacks, scissors, and garbage bags with you.\n\nAssign someone to keep your rooms tidy, wearing clean getting-ready attire (if you chose to document this portion of the day), and ensuring that your bridesmaids get ready first.\n\nSteam any garments prior to getting your makeup ready.\n\nLately, many of my couples do not have a wedding party (especially for micro weddings) but still get ready with their parents, grandparents, closest friends, etc.\n\nIf you do have one, choose at least one person who is helpful and attentive. Explain what you will need during the day.\n\nHaving many people while getting ready can make capturing peaceful moments more challenging but can also create fun, high-energy moments. Choose who will be in there with this in mind.\n\nStay hydrated and remember to eat! Get a large water bottle and drink it while getting ready.\n\nFloss prior to portraits (I will have floss in my purse; just ask).\n\nGet properly fitted, which includes the shirt, vest, jacket, etc. Spend the money, and get a tailor.\n\nLearn how to tie a tie/bow tie and pin a boutonnière beforehand. Youtube it and practice.\n\nIf your tuxedo rentals come with both a belt and suspenders, you wear one or the other, not both.\n\nWill you be wearing a pocket square? Practice folding it and looking in the mirror (it can be tricky!).\n\nConsider using non traditional items for your traditions! For example, I once saw a groom throw his bowtie instead of a garter.\n\nEmpty your pockets for photos. Button the top button. Your hands go in your pockets or on your partner’s body.\n\nHave fun during your wedding party photos! My team and I will make suggestions, but we are always happy to implement your ideas, too!\n\nMany of my clients choose to do a first look, which typically takes 15-30 minutes.\n\nPROS: It helps you make time for yourselves on your wedding day, it gives us more time for portraits, you get to go to cocktail hour faster, and you will be more relaxed at the ceremony because you already saw each other. You can also use this time to read some private vows to each other, pray together, share a tequila shot, exchange a small gift, etc.\n\nCONS: you have to get dressed hours earlier, you will not see each other for the first time in the aisle, and it may be shortened/not happen at all if anything runs late initially (that is why it is important to pad the timeline!).\n\nA wedding planner (full or partial) helps you select vendors and locations, communicate with vendors, attend vendor meetings, manage the budget, design and style your wedding day, and coordinate other logistics.\n\nA day-of coordinator (role which can be fulfilled by the event planner as well) is strongly encouraged. Actually, it should almost be a must have. Coordinators do a lot of prep work leading to the wedding day (they should be called month-of, not day-of). They help review contracts and existent plans, confirm logistics, do a final venue walk-through, manage your rehearsal, and definitely make your day run smoothly.\n\nBy the way, the venue's coordinator is NOT the same as a day-of-coordinator. The venue coordinator usually does not set up your seating charts, welcome table, floral arrangements, etc and most definitely won’t run to get your bouquet for portraits, for example. Think of it like this: a venue coordinator works for the venue. The day-of coordinator works for you, as a personal assistant. Coordinators are 100% worth the investment.\n\nYour sister or mother can probably coordinate if they are experienced enough. However, they will not get to enjoy your day if they have to run around constantly.\n\nI have worked with quality vendors over the years and can recommend a planner/coordinator and any other vendors you may need.\n\nI need at least 20 minutes with the two of you for the couple portraits. Ask your video team if they will need additional time, or if they can capture footage simultaneously. Some like to direct scenes while others approach the day in a documentary fashion.\n\nPlease let them know that photography will have priority of placement and direction on the wedding day, as per your contract with me.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, ask your videographer about turnaround times: how long will it take to get the final product? What IS the final product? A highlight reel and/or raw footage? Will audio such as ceremony vows and reception speeches be recorded, or will it be video only? Get that in your contract or at least in writing.\n\nMy team and I try to be as unobtrusive and respectful as possible. We will block a guest’s view only if it is strictly necessary and will do so briefly. We understand that the day is about you and your guests’ enjoyment. Please ask your videographers what their approach is. Some set up equipment right in the middle of the aisle or in front of your guests… the entire time! Some only bring “wide” lenses meaning they will be really close to you, for example, walking up to your face during the first dance. We bring a variety of lenses and use them accordingly. For example, we utilize “long” zoom lenses (24-70, 70-200 mm) during the ceremony to minimize disruptions.\n\nIf you need a video team recommendation, allow me to say that Herbert from A Colored Mind is the best wedding videographer in Orange County and possibly Southern California. His easygoing yet professional approach to the wedding day has made working with him a seamless experience over the years.\n\nI do not mind guests taking photos. I understand their excitement and appreciate the intention! However, overly enthusiastic guests could block my view as you are coming down the aisle, just to name one example.\n\nIf you have friends who you know like to take a lot of photos, please let them know that you have hired a professional team and that they will be the only ones covering the event.\n\nOr you could have the officiant announce this while everyone is seated waiting for the processional: that guests will have 30 seconds to take video/photos of you two by the altar at a designated time; after that, *all* devices must be put away to let the pros handle it and allow for a present audience.\n\nI will be candidly photographing your guests and special moments throughout your day.\n\nIf there are specific people who are particularly important (and who might not be as involved throughout the day), who you want me to pay extra attention to, please let me know.\n\nSimilarly, if there will be any traditions or customs that we should know about, please mention them as well (for example: washing each other’s feet, breaking of the glass, pouring sand into a jar, lighting a candle, hand binding, presenting gifts to parents, jumping of the broom, choreographed/surprise dances, taking a tequila/whiskey shot together, and sparkle exit).\n\nThere will be a section in your timeline Google Doc for the names of everyone in your wedding party and immediate family. I will try to memorize these to address your loved ones appropriately.\n\nI require that you make a list of the people that you want to take photos with.\n\nWe can photograph you and your families in a formal manner before the ceremony (if you are planning on seeing each other before) or right after (while everyone else is at cocktail hour).\n\nThe challenge with doing the formals before the ceremony is having everyone show up on time. If necessary, tell your loved ones to arrive at least 15 mins earlier than the actual start time.\n\nThe challenge with taking these photos after the ceremony is people wondering off to Starbucks (it has happened!) or cocktail hour. Please ask them to stay until instructed differently.\n\nIf possible, assign a \"wrangler\" for both sides of the family –someone who knows them by name. I will print an extra group photo list for them to use.\n\nWe can take as many photos as you wish to, but keep it mind that it can take anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 minutes per group. Typically, clients set aside 20 to 45 minutes for this portion of the day.\n\nFollow this example when making your list:\n\ncouple\n\ncouple + officiant/priest\n\ncouple + parents\n\ncouple + parents + siblings, etc\n\nIf you are pressed for time, cover your immediate family only.\n\nBut please ask your parents (both sides of the family) as they will often have their own specific requests (including the aunt who traveled from far away, for example).\n\nI will need this list of group photos at least two weeks before your wedding day to have an opportunity to ask for clarification and reorganize the list as needed.\n\nIf your list gets long, ask yourself how important that photo is? Will you print it? Can it be taken later, during reception time?\n\nSometimes guests line up during family formals to request their own photo combinations. We can do these additional groupings if time allows, or we can tell them we will take these during reception time (I will make a note on my timeline).\n\nAlso, let me know if you’d like to include more casual posing (like in the photo below) in addition to “regular” formal group photos.\n\nPlan to have everything all at the same location if at all possible. Do not waste your photo/video coverage time driving around from place to place.\n\nIf you must, choose the number of locations wisely. Why?\n\nBecause you likely have guests and family waiting for you.\n\nBecause frequently trying to do too much can make you two tired in the process (especially if it is hot!).\n\nBecause transporting groups of people takes time.\n\nConsider: how will you get to multiple locations? Will it be just the three/four of us? Or will it be the entire wedding party? Is parking readily available at all destinations? Are you padding the timeline to allow for heavy traffic or unforeseen events like a flat tire?\n\nPerhaps scheduling a “day-after” (or weekend-after) photo session could help you cover those special locations without worrying about a wedding day timeline.\n\nThe two tangible things you walk away with from your wedding day are your new spouse and your photos/video. Anything else gets trashed, eaten, or packed away in the attic.\n\nTherefore, think ahead about the importance of good photos, lighting, and backgrounds.\n\nConsider the look of the following backdrops such as the altar/ceremony site, sweetheart table, dance floor, and cake setting, carefully as most of your photos will showcase them. Make sure that you are happy with their design and aesthetics.\n\nSpeaking of sweetheart tables, I have seen many flower arrangements that completely or partially blocked the view of the couple. While the flowers may be gorgeous and you get to have extra privacy, keep in mind that we won’t be able to photograph you from the front, only from the side angles.\n\nI always note sunset time when creating your timeline. Why?\n\nIf your wedding ceremony is going to take place outdoors at noon in direct sunlight, your photos will NOT look as if they were taken in softer sunset light.\n\nI will do my best to photograph your ceremony in a flattering way, but choosing the timing can certainly help (the best light is 1-2 hours before sunset).\n\nVisit your venue one month before at the exact time you plan to have your ceremony. At that time, the sun should be lighting the area in approximately the same way (as opposed to visiting during the summer for a winter wedding).\n\nIf the lighting is not ideal, consider using alternative locations or adding shade.\n\nNote the altar/couple/guest placement in relation to the sun. Will the sun be shining directly into someone’s face? This is specially important for warm Southern California summer weddings.\n\nIf you will host a summer outdoor ceremony, consider providing sunscreen, water, and shade (umbrellas, for example) to your guests, especially the elderly.\n\nVirtually every single wedding I have photographed has ran late at least momentarily.\n\nThat is why it is important to pad your timeline. It is expected, and we can recover, except for the next case. Let me tell you that story.\n\nI once photographed a wedding where the ceremony was scheduled to start 30 minutes before sunset, but hair and makeup ran late, and the ceremony took place in deep darkness (we were away from the city lights). My video light came in handy, and while I was still able to produce beautiful photographs, it was definitely not the vision my client had for their “I do” moments. Had the bride allocated a 30-minute buffer for hair and makeup (the minimum I recommend), she would have been ready just on time for her sunset ceremony.\n\nPlease allocate enough time so that your ceremony starts at least 1 hour before sunset.\n\nBy the way, the point of my stories and advice is not to scare you! My intention is to share the lessons learned over the years so that you realize that “things happen,” so it is best to prepare.\n\nIf you want sunset couple portraits, schedule your outdoor ceremony 2 hours prior to sunset followed by your family group photos, then at least 20 minutes of sunset portraits with me, which is what Mamie & David did above.\n\nBy the way, I can and will help you with all of these scheduling decisions during our timeline review meeting!\n\nDo not wait until the day before to write your vows! Many activities will occupy your mind in the days leading to your day.\n\nConsider having an unplugged ceremony. Reassure your guests that you will share your photos (if you will). You can share your online photo gallery for viewing only or for viewing & downloading.\n\nThis one is hard to remember: hold your bouquet near your belly button. Otherwise it will cover your dress detail!\n\nExchange rings slowly. Look at each other. Smile. Take it all in!\n\nEnjoy your kiss, maybe kiss multiple times if you feel like it! My only request is: no fish lips, hehe.\n\nAsk your officiant ahead of time to step aside for the kiss –unless you want him/her in your photos!\n\nYou can do the traditional kiss at the altar and anywhere else during your recessional, like in the middle of the aisle with all of your guests surrounding you.\n\nSome clients have walked down the aisle alone while others walk together instead of having parents give them away. Do what feels best for you.\n\nMake sure the aisle is wide enough to accomodate people walking down. I have seen narrow aisles where elderly moms and dads have struggled to walk in next to their children.\n\nIf symmetry is important to you, ask your venue to align the centers of the aisle and your arch/altar when setting up.\n\nYour wedding party can carry non-traditional items, not just flowers. For example, puppies for adoption!\n\nOn 02/26/2022, I photographed a very unique wedding where every couple and person walking down the aisle was introduced. Yes, it took a little longer, but it was very meaningful as we learned about them and their relationship to the couple. The intros were told with a sense of humor by the teenage daughter and grandfather of the bride, both of whom officiated the wedding together. It was a very heartwarming one!\n\nOn 06/17/2023, a bride and groom decided to read each other’s vows (meaning the bride read what the groom wrote and vice versa). It was sweet and emotional.\n\nPlan to provide a meal for your wedding coordinator, photographer, videographer, and DJ if they are working long hours for you.\n\nWe request a meal for any coverage over 6 hrs (yet most clients insist on feeding us regardless of coverage length).\n\nPlease give us at least 15 minutes to eat and use the restroom.\n\nCoordinate with your caterer to feed the video and photo teams at the beginning of food service, NOT after all guests get their meals. We need to be ready to go back to work by the time you and the first few guests finish their meals (or earlier, as often speeches and toasts are scheduled during dinner service).\n\nDon't start your first dance or any other important activities while we are eating. You may think this is obvious, right? But it is not! Just last week, the bride’s dad decided to start the formal dances while my assistant and I were eating. Luckily, the coordinator noticed and ran to get us just on time to photograph the dances. The sad part? We went back to cold food 10 minutes later.\n\nLastly, I love cake dearly. I hope you do not mind me eating a slice at the end of the day! :-)\n\nOffer some guidance to those who will be giving speeches. If there are topics you do not want mentioned, even if people might think they are funny, be sure to tell them ahead of time. Also inform them of any time considerations.\n\nDo you want to walk around and take photos with each table? If so, make sure you communicate this to me and set time aside.\n\nIf you will have a photo booth, make sure people use it! Place it in an accessible place and have your DJ let people know it is there. Also, ask if they will provide you with an electronic copy of all of the photos taken (those are fun to watch!).\n\nBring your own card box and designate a trusted person to be in charge of it.\n\nPlease feel free to ask for any photos with guests during reception time. That is what we are there for!\n\nDo you want to get everyone on the dance floor for a photo? Let’s coordinate with the DJ to do so.\n\nTraditionally, the couple dances first followed by the groom and his mom dance and the bride and her dad dance after. Some clients have had both parent dance simultaneously to save time. In contrast, some clients have had all four parents dance, which I personally think is only fair!\n\nRecently, a couple decided to set up a board with 3 song options for guests to vote for. In the end, the couple first danced to the song that had accumulated the most votes!\n\nAnother client decided that the groom would dip the bride dancing as expected, but guess what? She also dipped him!\n\nTalk to your DJ about the lighting they are going to be using for your wedding and ask them to turn off colorful laser lights for formal dances (unless you want that look). Here you can see the purple DJ lights on my client’s dad’s skin during the father-daughter dance.\n\nThe day goes by very fast. Really, it does!\n\nGuests (and us vendors) will pull you in different directions because they will want to spend time with either or both of you.\n\nPlease, please take a moment at some point to *just be* present with each other.\n\nThis can be an opportunity to enjoy a quiet moment, share your thoughts, make out a little (LOL), and feel thankful for your day.\n\nYou can set aside time after the ceremony and/or before your grand entrance, for example. Reflect on the fact that everyone is there to celebrate your love, which is pretty cool!\n\nWeddings can be stressful so take a couple of minutes to just breathe and take everything in.\n\nIf you two share a common interest, incorporate it into your wedding day!\n\nThemes clients have used include Star Wars, Disney, martial arts, and cats (now that I am a cat owner, I appreciate this one even more).\n\nPets are welcome during your photo session (assuming we have no onsite restrictions). I love furry family members!\n\nIf your pets won’t make it to the celebration, you can: bring them to your first look, name cocktail drinks after them, bring a cardboard cutout with their cute faces, and/or wear their faces in your socks or bouquet charm.\n\nGet a venue that is intrinsically beautiful so you do not have to decorate it as much.\n\nHave a smaller guest count. The pandemic showed me that smaller weddings are typically more intimate and emotional.\n\nThe same applies to having a wedding/bridal party. You don’t “need” one. You can have fun with all of your special people regardless.\n\nConsider offering relaxed food —it is usually less expensive and well liked.\n\nDon’t offer a full bar. Instead offer beer, wine, and two signature cocktails.\n\nGet a small cake to cut and sheet cakes to pre cut and serve.\n\nSkip the party favors. Seriously. Most people do not keep them.\n\nSimilarly, individual day programs end up in the trash. You can print a large one to have on an easel by the door instead.\n\nSkip the “Unplugged wedding ceremony” sign. Guests will not listen anyway, ha! But if yours do, have your officiant announce the “no phone/be present” guideline instead.\n\nCenterpieces do not have to be flowers. They can be greenery, candles, and unique themed items (Harry Potter, etc) that speak to who you are as a couple.\n\nYou can also repurpose your and other bouquets to decorate tables.\n\nA good DJ/MC can make a huge difference, especially in keeping the dance floor busy. Ask me if you need a recommendation. Do not save money here. Or on your photographer! :-)\n\nTry to remember other weddings to understand what you value and spend money on that.\n\nAt the end of the day, guests generally do not remember colors and decor. They remember what they ate and how they felt."
