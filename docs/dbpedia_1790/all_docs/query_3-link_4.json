        "text": "Adding embellishments to a wedding veil\n\ncan highlight the wedding dress and personalize the bridal veil. We take care to ensure your veil looks great from the front and back, especially important for a blusher, we place the Swarovski rhinestone crystals back to back and and on a blusher we alternate pearls and/or beads between the front and back so it is beautiful worn up or down. Embellishments create stunning beaded bridal veils and add a little weight making them a great idea for beach weddings or outdoor weddings. Order wedding veil embellishment samples today!\n\nWhere do the embellishments go on the veil?\n\nWe offer two great standard ways, and we take special requests, so let us know if you want heavier veil embellishment, a different pattern or a different type of embellishment.\n\nScattered throughout: Veil embellishment is sprinkled throughout the entire veil. We work on the veil in an 18″x18″ area at a time, scattering about 8 crystals, pearls or beads in this area (4 if it’s teardrop crystals). Request a quote if you’d like more than that or if you want your veil embellished with something other than what you see below. (For lace appliques it’s a total of 4 spread out on the veil)\n\nSwarovski Elements Crystals: These rhinestone crystals have a mirror back for brilliant sparkle. Swarovski Elements is the best crystal on the market. It’s made in Austria and the clarity and shine are superb. The rhinestone crystals are a flat back crystal and work very well on bridal veils. The crystals are raised and faceted on the front and flat on the back. We always place them back to back on bridal veils because the backs have a plain gray circle which is not so pretty and always ends up showing as veils turn in and out. We stock the colors: clear, golden shadow, silk and AB (Aurora Borealis, an iridescent crystal that looks like the clear crystal). They come in many other colors just send us a special request form. Crystals on veils are usually done in 4mm size, we have 3mm too, or special request a different shape or size.\n\nSwarovski Elements HFT Clear No Mirror Crystals: This is a transparent flat back crystal called HFT. They are more subtle than the rhinestone type but still catch the light. There’s no mirror so the back is as clear as the front. These wedding veils are simply beautiful. They look like sparkling drops of water on the veil. The come in clear and AB and are usually done in 4mm, can be done in 3mm.\n\nFaux Pearls: 4mm faux pearls come in white and ivory. Pearls are attached using a special milliners glue that is invisible and secure when finished. Pearls on a bridal veil will coordinate with a pearl embellished wedding dress.\n\nSwarovski Pearls: Faux pearls by Swarovski have a crystal core for the smoothest shape along with the beautiful outer pearl finish. The crystal base give them a realistic fWe usually use the 4mm white and ivory Swarovski pearls on wedding veils, but they do come in other sizes and colors just ask!\n\nSwarovski Crystal Beads: 4mm brilliant faceted crystal beads, also comes in 3mm, are used for our embellished beaded veils. These beads must be hand sewn to the wedding veils. Made of Swarovski Elements crystal, these bi-cone beads are brilliant. We stock clear, Golden Shadow and AB (iridescent), but they come in many other colors too. The beads add some weight to the veil making them ideal for beach weddings or outdoor weddings.\n\nSwarovski Teardrop Crystals: Teardrop crystals dangle from the veil. They are larger and more expensive so they are spaced further apart than with our other embellishments. Teardrop crystals are beautiful dangling from the edge of the veil. When you choose staggered along the edge for teardrop crystals they will be sewn right at the edge of the veil spaced 4 inches apart. When you choose scattered throughout they dangle from on top of the fabric throughout the veil at a spacing of 4 teardrops within an 18 x 18 inch area.\n\nLace Appliques: Appliques are lace designs as individual pieces. They come in many shapes and sizes, but most are a long narrow size. We will place up to 4 lace appliques on your veil if you choose lace appliques on any of our regular veil items. We can use more, but request a quote for that. Lace appliques can be staggered along the edge, with appliques that means the 4 appliques would be lined up near the edge with some space between each. They can also be scattered throughout, with appliques that means the 4 appliques would be arranged inside the veil in a design.\n\nWhen you choose lace appliques on your veil tell us about your dress, email a photo. We will find lace appliques that could work with your dress and email you photos to choose from.\n\nFuture Embellishments – let us know if you want one now!\n\nMarabou Feather Veil Embellishment: Round feather clusters made with marabou feathers. Add a winter look for your winter wedding!\n\nButterfly Wedding Veil Embellishments: The butterfly is a symbol of a new beginning, perfect for a wedding. Add butterflies to your veil, chose white, champagne, green or blue.\n\nEmbellishments Requested in the past\n\nCultured Freshwater Pearls: genuine pearls, 3mm to 4mm, potato pearls can be used to make truly luxurious wedding veils. Freshwater pearls natural irregular shape. They also add some weight which is a good idea for beach or outdoor weddings.\n\nSwarovski Crystal Heart Beads: Swarovski crystal beads come in many shapes and sizes. One bride requested them in a heart shape. Prefect for a wedding!\n\nShell Beads: One bride requested beads made from shells. A great match for a beach wedding!\n\nSwarovski Oval Rhinestone Crystals: These rhinestones are an oblong leaf shape. The bride was matching them to her dress.\n\nSwarovski Red and Green Rhinestone Crystals: This bride wanted crystals on her veil that would match the beading on her dress. We placed the red and green rhinestones on her veil in a design similar to her dress."
