        "text": "Everything you need to know about choosing, wearing, and styling a jaw-dropping veil.\n\nEvery bride wants to have that moment when they try on the perfect dress and know that it’s the one. For many brides, however, that moment doesn’t come until they try on the veil. That’s the moment they first feel like a bride, and the reality sinks in that they really are getting married.\n\nVeil styles change just like wedding dresses, and most recently, the biggest trend is for long, dramatic veils. Floor length, chapel length, cathedral length—anything long and sweeping. However, there’s more to veil styles than length, and it’s important to find the right one for your dress to have the right effect. Here are six different styles of long, dramatic veils to inspire your search.\n\n1. Long and ultra-sheer.\n\nOne of the magical qualities of ultra-long veils is that, unlike birdcage or blusher veils, which tend to be of stiffer tulle to generate height, long veils are made of soft fabric so that they can drape beautifully and flow out behind the bride as she walks.\n\nThe simplest style of these veils is usually worn farther back on the head, and has few embellishments—if any. Because there isn’t any beading or lace to weigh it down, these ultra-light veils form a billowing backdrop to the bride in all her wedding pictures. Simple, yet stunning.\n\n2. Elegant edges.\n\nA simple veil has its charms, but what if you want something with a little more embellishment? Finding a veil with lace appliqué edging will have a slightly less billowing and ethereal look, but that may be just right if you want your veil to fan out behind you in a shape that repeats the cut of your train.\n\nFor instance, we love how this style from Allure Bridals pairs with the train of this figure-fitting gown. The added lace helps give shape to the veil and balances the otherwise simple cut of the gown.\n\n3. Dotted with appliqués.\n\nOne of the more modern veil trends is a dotted style—one in which lace or bits of sparkle are scattered down the entire length of the veil. Depending on the design, the decoration can look like stars, falling snow, or flower petals.\n\nCase in point: this beautiful veil from Belaire Bridal, features a sprinkling of lace appliqués throughout that add depth and interest to the veil. It’s a beautiful look that looks charming with form-fitting or A-line silhouettes.\n\n4. Romantic mantillas.\n\nA mantilla is a veil of Spanish origin that is worn further forward on the head, but which does not cover the face. The history behind them has made them a romantic and popular choice for many brides, especially those who are planning on a more traditional church ceremony.\n\nA traditional mantilla is often all-over lace, often with a scalloped edge to frame the face. This beautiful mantilla veil from Belaire Bridal is a perfect example of this style. We love how the lace edging frames the face for a beautiful old-world look.\n\n5. Heirloom lace.\n\nYou may have to turn to your family for this one. Many brides decide to have their veil be the “something old” of their wedding, choosing to wear the same veil as their mother or grandmother, or else having pieces of lace from these veils incorporated into her own.\n\nIf you can’t find heirloom lace from your family, look for a style that uses vintage-quality lace, such as this one from Belaire Bridal. After all, with Venice lace of this quality, it may be your own wedding veil that supplies the heirloom lace for future generations.\n\n6. Cathedral-length for full drama.\n\nFinally, if the deepest desire of your heart is to wear a long veil that trails the entire length of the aisle, a cathedral-length veil is for you. As its name implies the length of this veil is designed to help the bride from being lost when surrounded by a large cathedral.\n\nBecause of this, think carefully about your venue before you jump on one. If you’re planning a ceremony in an outdoors location, a veil of this length is likely to get caught on undergrowth, or become filled with sand. And if you’re getting married in a smaller chapel, be sure there’s enough space for your wedding party to be able to step around your veil during the ceremony.\n\nThat said, if your venue is grand enough to allow it, then don’t hold back. This veil from Allure Bridals goes all-out, with a veil long enough to impress Princess Kate herself.\n\nBudget wisely for your showpiece accessory.\n\nA super long veil is sure to impress your wedding guests and leave your groom speechless. Keep in mind, however, that longer veils cost more than shorter ones. As such, you may find the veil of your dreams competing against your perfect dress for a portion of your budget.\n\nTo avoid this, think about dress styles that are simpler so as not to compete with the drama of your veil. A flowing A-line dress will likely cost less than a ball gown, due to the and is more likely to compliment the draping, figure-hugging silhouette of a long, soft veil.\n\nMost importantly, find a veil that you’re comfortable wearing, and that suits your gown. No matter how exciting the trend may be, remember that your veil should be a reflection of your own personality, not a sign of the times.\n\nWant to switch up your bridal look without buying a second dress? We’ve got you covered.\n\nIf you’ve been to more than one wedding, you’re probably well aware that the ceremony and reception are two very different events. What works in one—dramatic trains, cathedral-length veils—will quickly become a hassle in another. On top of practical concerns, many brides also feel that the expectations about what they should be wearing are different in each location. Many brides want to wear a more traditional, conservative style in church, and save the more trendy or revealing styles for the reception.\n\nSome brides have gone so far as to buy two entirely different dresses for each venue, but this is obviously an expensive option that is out of the price range for many of our brides. We’ve also worked with enough brides to know how many of them never want to take off their dream dress once they’ve found it. Instead, they’re looking for creative ways to change up their look from day to evening—and we are here for it.\n\nWe’ve created a round-up of creative ways to change your wedding look between ceremony and reception. And just like your wedding style, these are easy to mix and match!\n\n1. Wear a lace topper or jacket during the ceremony.\n\nYour ceremony venue may have a dress code about what is considered appropriate to wear—especially if your ceremony is more traditional or religious. Convention aside, many brides themselves want a more demure look for the ceremony. This can be a problem if you’ve also got your heart set on a strapless dress with a plunging back. Fortunately, a lace jacket is here for the rescue. We love the look of lace sleeves for the ceremony, but they can be constricting once you hit the dance floor. Lace toppers give you the best of both worlds!\n\n2. Add a splash of color for the reception.\n\nWhite is the traditional color for brides, but conventions in this regard are beginning to shift as more and more brides strive to incorporate more personal details into their bridal look. While you probably want to keep the traditional look for the wedding, the reception is the perfect place to add a colorful sash, incorporate some of your bouquet flowers into your hair piece, or throw on a bright pair of shoes.\n\n3. Put on your party shoes.\n\nSpeaking of shoes, you may want to consider a few different options for your wedding day. Depending on your dress style, you may not see much of your feet during the ceremony, and you may even want to have a pair of boots ready if you plan to hike out into the middle of a meadow or through a field of freshly-fallen snow for your pictures. But once you’re ready to dance the night away, you want to be sure your shoes won’t let you down. Look for comfort, but also think about adding some sparkle and color to your footwear. Just be sure that you pay attention to heel height, as this will affect the look of your hemline.\n\n4. Glam up your makeup.\n\nMakeup styles often vary greatly from day to night. In broad daylight, simpler, more natural makeup styles fare best, because the strong light is likely to make heavier makeup more noticeable. But once evening falls, that simple makeup may make your features harder to distinguish in the dim lighting. Plus, the reception is just the right time to pop on a bold lip color or add some smoky eyeshadow to your look. Whatever you choose, make sure you practice the two different looks ahead of time so that you know they will work together.\n\n5. Substitute veil for tiara.\n\nVeils are a romantic and dramatic way to style a wedding dress, and one of the key elements to pull the look together for a ceremony. But once the ceremony is over, a long veil can quickly get in the way and become a hindrance during dinner and dancing. Fortunately, it’s easy to remove a veil and substitute it with another stunning hair piece. So, if you’re torn between a tiara or tulle, why not plan on both?\n\n6. Change up your jewelry and add a bit of bling.\n\nOnce you start changing up your look, you may realize that some of your accessories don’t fit the style as well as you had planned. Chandelier earrings may be too much with a tiara, for instance, or you may want a statement necklace that would be too much for church. Adding and removing jewelry is an effective way to customize your bridal look and make it all your own.\n\n7. Let your hair down.\n\nChoosing a hair style can be tough. Up? Down? Half up and half down? Why not one of each. Pick a sleek style for the ceremony, then pull the bobby pins out for the reception. Be ready to touch your style up with a curling iron, or have a plan for adding in a new hair piece.\n\n8. Wear a removable train or overskirt.\n\nTwo-piece bridal outfits are becoming more popular as they allow brides to switch up their entire silhouette from day to night. Maybe you wanted a full ball gown for the church, but a short party dress for the reception? Have at it. Or, for a similar and faster way to change up your bridal style, try a removable train or overskirt. These are less pricy options that still allow for the dramatic day-to-night transformation you want, and are easier to work with than two different skirts.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do with just a few changes.\n\nSome brides are interested in a dramatic costume change between the church and the reception. Others want only subtle alterations that make it easier to move around in a crowded room. Either way, altering your wedding look doesn’t have to be a major ordeal. In fact, you can accomplish a lot with just a few of the changes we mentioned above.\n\nWhether you choose to keep your bridal look the same or change it entirely is up to you. This is your day—express yourself however you choose.\n\nLong sleeves are an elegant, stylish choice for your wedding dress. Should you try them?\n\nLong-sleeved wedding dresses are having a moment. Maybe it’s the long, graceful lines they add to a silhouette, or perhaps it’s the parade of gorgeous long-sleeved Royal wedding gowns, but either way, many brides are choosing this style for their big day.\n\nThat said, while many brides are eager to hop on the trend, new styles sometimes come with some unexpected caveats—like how a tight, fishtail gown may be hard to dance in, or how a cathedral-length veil may not be appropriate for the beach.\n\nFor long-sleeved wedding dresses, brides should bear two things in mind. First, even lace sleeves can be too warm in the summer. Think about wearing pantyhose: even the sheerest styles still put a barrier between your skin and a cooling summer breeze. Lace sleeves are the same.\n\nSecond, long-sleeves are often more constricting on bridal styles than what most brides are used to from casual wear. This is because the sleeves tend to be fitted more closely, as well as being made from material that has less stretch to it. So, if you planned to do a lot of dancing, or if you had a special photoshoot planned that might require more freedom of movement for your arms, you will want to be careful about what sleeve style you choose.\n\nHowever, if neither of those considerations are a concern for you, then the long-sleeved style may be perfect for your wedding. So, whether you’re in love with the illusion lace of Kate Middleton’s gown or the clean, couture simplicity of Meghan Markle’s, we carry a variety of gowns with long sleeves in our store. Here are just a few you can try on at our bridal boutique in Brighton, MI.\n\nLacy A-lines\n\nThe Felice gown will have you looking and feeling like a princess all day. The lace sleeves are mostly sheer but with perfectly placed appliqué details along the upper arm and cuffs. The A-line skirt gives the dress a graceful flare without the full drama of a ball gown.\n\nWith a similar lacy A-line style, the Audrina dress matches full lace sleeves with bare shoulders for an elegant look that is the epitome of romance. The all-over lace on this gown adds to the appeal without complicating the silhouette.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want a more structured look, Maxine combines sheer sleeves and lace details with a plain skirt that is dramatic in its simplicity. Meanwhile, the deep V neckline and plunging back keep this style from being two demure.\n\nChic, Boat Neck Fit-and-Flares\n\nThere’s something chic and elegant about a boat neck that is hard to match with other styles. Case in point: Melina. Apart from a long train and fabric-covered buttons down the back, there’s not much embellishment to this dress. That said, Melina doesn’t need it. This dress makes a statement with minimalism, and the effect speaks loud and clear.\n\nFrom the front, Jolie looks much the same, with clean lines and a stunning silhouette. But the illusion back features a gorgeous appliqué for brides who want a touch more bling on their wedding gown. Want a similar, minimalist style but with all-over lace? Dominique is an enchanting blend of the two that will leave your partner speechless.\n\nFinally, if you can’t make up your mind between the beauty of a boat neck and the romance of a sweetheart neckline, Marlee is the best of both worlds. The dress is a beautiful fit and flare silhouette with a sweetheart neckline, but with a lace overly featuring the boat neck style.\n\nGraceful flowing A-lines.\n\nLong lacy sleeves, a sweetheart neckline with just a hint of a plunge, and a flowing chiffon skirt, Arwyn is one of our most romantic gowns. For a gown in a similar style, we love how the James gown shines in winter scenery. It features a V neckline in front and back, along with sleeves with a denser lace for a look with more coverage.\n\nFor a more bohemian look, Jelena combines long lace sleeves with an illusion back and plunging neckline. Its carefree style is perfect for a beach wedding, where the sleeves might be the perfect balance between the summertime heat and a cool breeze coming off the water.\n\nFigure-hugging, illusion-back dresses.\n\nFinally, there are some gowns that manage to blend the modesty of a long-sleeved gown with the allure of an open back. First on our list is Delphina, a gown whose design elements include not only an illusion back and side cutouts, but detachable full-length sleeves.\n\nMeanwhile, the Danika dress saves some of the drama for the godet train. Combined, the neckline and back are the perfect blend of sweet and sexy. Want something even more jaw-dropping? Haven is an absolutely scintillating dress that hugs every curve and isn’t shy about it at all.\n\nFinally, Emilee skips the illusion and goes straight for the plunging back. We also love the stunning lace detail in the train—a design element that won’t be overlooked as you’re walking down the aisle.\n\nLong-sleeved bridal gowns are a trend we expect to stick around.\n\nWe love a long-sleeved wedding gown.

You may just be able to find the long-sleeved wedding gown of your dreams at a bargain price.\n\nHow to choose a wedding veil style for any dress.\n\nYou’ve chosen your dress, now it’s time for the extras. None of your other accessories are more important than the veil, which can transform your look entirely. While it’s important to coordinate the style of veil with the style of gown you’ve chosen, usually you have some latitude for self-expression. Most wedding dresses look lovely with several different wedding veil styles.\n\nThat’s why choosing your wedding veil is all about determining your personal wedding style. Are you looking for something formal and dramatic? Fun and flirty? A little bit whimsical? There are wedding veil styles to suit every mood and venue. Below we look at just a few of the more popular lengths and ways to customize your veil.\n\nBird Cage Wedding Veil: 4-9″\n\nThis short and flirty wedding veil, also sometimes called a bandeau veil, really stands out. It’s always quite short, but it can cover just the eyes, skim the nose or fall at the jawline. It’s often made of a net or lace rather than the traditional tulle, leaving more of the bride’s face visible.\n\nThere’s no reason you can’t wear a bird cage wedding veil at a traditional church ceremony, and it’s also the perfect complement for a shorter dress and a city hall wedding. A bird cage veil is a good choice for a bride who likes the vintage look, or even something just a little different.\n\nBlusher Wedding Veil: 30″\n\nThe blusher wedding veils is also known as an angle veil or wedge veil. Although it has vintage appeal, it’s not overly formal. It falls over the face, so it’s a good choice for the bride who wants that dramatic moment when her face is revealed at the end of the aisle.\n\nBrides can also add a blusher to a longer veil, like Kate Middleton did on her wedding day. It can be held in place by a dramatic headpiece or just a simple comb, depending on the look the bride wants. Because it’s so customizable, the blusher is an enduringly popular wedding veil style.\n\nFingertip Wedding Veil: 38-40″\n\nIt makes sense that a lot of wedding dresses save the drama for the back. After all, people will be looking after you as you process down the aisle. When you’re choosing a veil, it’s important that the length and fabric don’t obscure any important back detail.\n\nThat’s why fingertip veils remain so popular. Not as heavy or long as chapel or cathedral veils, they still fall low, just below the hips and at the fingertip as the name implies. The length allows any design on the back of the bride’s gown to show through the sheer tulle. Fingertip veils are similar to ballet veils, which are just few inches longer.\n\nFloor-Length Wedding Veil: 72″\n\nA floor-length veil just reaches the floor, hitting at the same place as the bride’s dress. This style is dramatic but not overwhelming, adding extra volume to your look, but still preserving a streamlined silhouette.\n\nThis wedding veil style is a nice choice for a bride that wants the Disney princess look but isn’t interested in the chapel or cathedral veil, which can be a lot to manage. Floor length veils look lovely with sheath dresses especially, and are a good choice for nontraditional venues, like beaches, where you might want length but not fabric dragging in the sand.\n\nChapel Wedding Veil: 90″\n\nHave you chosen a shorter dress but still want the look of a train? A chapel-length veil gives the illusion of a train, but can be taken off during the reception when you want more freedom of movement. Chapel-length veils are not overly long, but they do extend slightly beyond the hem of the bride’s gown.\n\nLovely and traditional, a chapel length veil never goes out of style. It’s also adaptable to many different venues and types of weddings, just as pretty in a ballroom as it is in a garden. It also provides plenty of space for different embellishments, which can dramatically change the look of the veil.\n\nCathedral Wedding Veil: 108-120″\n\nWhen you want to look like a queen on your wedding day, choose a cathedral-length wedding veil. This is undoubtedly the most dramatic style, associated with royalty and over-the-top celebrations. It looks stunning during the ceremony and makes for incredible pictures.\n\nA cathedral wedding veil can be worn with many different styles of wedding dress, but it pairs most naturally with ball gowns and more elaborate dresses. However, there are many different styles of cathedral veil, and some look just right with less ornate gowns.\n\nGet creative with color and embellishments.\n\nWhatever wedding veil style you choose, remember that your veil is a beautiful place to add some color to your wedding look. We all remember Angelina Jolie’s fabulously illustrated veil, and you can be just as fearless. Try colorful embroidery or blush tulle to make a statement.\n\nDifferent embellishments also radically change the look of a veil. Whether you want the sparkle of Swarovski crystals or the delicate leaves and petals of hand-embroidered flowers, you can choose a veil that perfectly matches the style of your dress and wedding.\n\nUse a fitting appointment to test-run your hairstyle with a veil.\n\nSometimes you just have to see how a veil looks with your gown. And, since how you style your hair will impact the look and feel of your wedding veil, it may be appropriate to use a fitting appointment or a day of bridesmaid shopping as a chance to test the two together. Do a hair and make-up run through at the salon, and then come into The White Dress to see how different veils pair with your wedding tresses. We’re happy to help you find the veil of your dreams."
