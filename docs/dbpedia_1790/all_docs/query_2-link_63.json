        "text": "We’re either the whole painting or the entire canvas.\n\nIn curating our house we design and curate collections that meld an East meets West feeling.\n\nOur aesthetic is both artisanal and modern. We are Timeless: Romance (adventure), Nostalgia (sentiment), Poetry in Cloth (simplicity).\n\nWe approach design manufacturing and sewing from the East: Tradition, old world ways of making quality garments and fabrics from hand and machine. We approach design from the West: Enlightenment, modernity; An appreciation for new technology, silhouettes, and fabrics for wear.\n\nIn curating Gee June we chose Designers, who like us, have lived in both urban and suburban areas and have swapped the East coast for the Pacific or vice versa, and who strive to make product that is made & designed in the U.S.A. and abroad by skilled artisans and craftsman.\n\nWe prioritize authenticity. The pieces picked and designed for and by Gee June Bridal are eclectic, sentimental, and fluid.\n\nPoetry & Romance, Creating Nostalgia\n\nNostalgia, Romance, Poetry in Cloth made by a Designer, Couturier and Craftsman in the Finger Lakes.\n\nGee June was created by a Designer to focus on the craft of dress making and fine sewing. Using old and new world sewing techniques suited to the lady and her story: Who she is, who she was, and who she will be matter. The details, the labors of handwork and the feel of it’s fabric are what personifies a gown, veil, headpiece or adornment's personality as inspired by the lady who commissions it.\n\nGee June Bridal originally began, in 2010, as a Designer’s pursuit to personify bridal wear. In the beginning the climb was slow and steady. Gee June was a ‘side gig’ in what we now understand to have been ‘Gig Nation.’ As most Millennial’s, Gee June began because a college graduate (after having lived and worked in Fashion from NYC to LA) with dual degrees in Apparel and Textiles needed work. In 2008, jobs were scarce. In 2009, jobs were liquidated. In 2010, jobs seemed to not exist. To stay employed: Gee June began as an idea that if it took off would make for a nice career; otherwise, it would be a band-aide to keep a Designer’s portfolio going and relevant, when the main gig might have been Serving (or Retail, Sales, Banking, Stocking, Cleaning, or a combination of three to four at a time) through the ‘Great Millennial Hiring Freeze.’\n\nGee June Bridal initially set out to provide custom dresses for Bridesmaids. In 2012, Gee June grew into making custom gowns for the Bride; which, quickly transitioned into making headpieces, adornments, veils, and christening gowns from family heirlooms that led us into cleaning and rebuilding vintage and antique pieces of clothing. In 2015, after having designed a collection for a New York Designer’s CFDA recognized, NYFW presentation: The ‘gig’ was full time. The phone kept ringing and in 2017, Gee June Bridal was deemed as one of Ithaca’s Race for the Space winners (Race for the Space is a competition hosted by two U.S. cities where contestants compete via a business plan for a retail location. The grand prize being abated rent for one year: Gee June was a Grand Prize Winner)!\n\nOur Namesake\n\nGee June: Gee = Grace, effortless, elegance for June —> Forward.\n\nMrs. Grace June is a family name for us. Gee is her first initial spelled out.*\n\nGrace is marriage.\n\nJune is the sixth month of the year, the start of Summer, and the wedding month. For us, June is the big kick-off to the beginning of high-wedding season and October is our Super Bowl month! Weddings happen all year long, but the new season, our New Year begins with the Strawberry Moon in Peony season of June —> Forward (everything before June is just pre-season/practice)!\n\n*When we began G. June could not be our domain, in the middle of an e-mail address, and not as friendly for Garmin (pre-Google maps and Alexa) to pronounce while reciting directions. We spelled out the Gee to exercise good manners. Gee ensured that those finding us who may not have English as their primary language would feel confident in contacting us knowing they had our pronunciation correct."
