        "text": "Typical questions asked about LGBTQ Destination Weddings\n\n1. Why should we get married abroad?\n\nOne of the many benefits of marrying abroad is that you are expected to invite a smaller amount of wedding guests, making the occasion more intimate. You may also choose a destination that is special to you both, adding an extra sentiment. Wedding packages also tend to be cheaper abroad and you can tie in your honeymoon.\n\n2. What makes a Mediterranean wedding special?\n\nFirst, imagine the incredible backdrop that will be part of your wedding. Next, think about incorporating the delicious local food and wine that will give you wedding that something a little bit different. You can also almost guarantee that you will have amazing weather.\n\n3. Are same sex weddings legal abroad?\n\nYes! Gay marriage was legalised in October 2017. This came into effect in 25 countries. You can now choose to have your wedding in over 30 countries.\n\n4. Can both brides wear a wedding dress?\n\nOf course! Both brides are definitely able to wear wedding dresses although this isn’t always the case. If a dress isn’t for you, there are plenty of other options. You could try a bridal jumpsuit, traditional suit or whatever you want to!\n\n5. Can both brides wear veils?\n\nAgain, yes! The addition of a veil is personal preference for any bride and some brides choose not to wear one at all. If you do choose to wear veils, you may choose completely different or very similar styles. For example, one bride could choose a short veil and one bride could choose a very long veil such as our Elizabeth veil.\n\n6. Should two brides coordinate their wedding dresses?\n\nYou certainly could if you wanted to, however, if you’re trying to keep your outfits secret from each other this might prove tricky! If you’ve both agreed on an overall theme for the wedding, however, as well as the location and time of year, you would likely naturally choose dresses that complement each other nicely enough, even if you decide to each go for a different silhouette and finer details.\n\nThat said, here are some ways you can coordinate both brides at a lesbian wedding.\n\nMatching accessory colour, e.g. all silver or all gold\n\nMatching, or complementing bouquets.\n\nMatching or coordinating dress colours (you may decide not to wear white or ivory)\n\n7. How do two brides walk down the aisle at a same sex wedding?\n\nThere are a few options for this. You could go down the traditional route and have one bride waiting at the alter while the other bride walks down. You could both walk down the aisle together, unified. Alternatively, my favourite, you could arrange your venue seating to make two aisles either side, both walk down them and meet in the middle at the alter.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is – It is YOUR wedding so do what YOU want!"
