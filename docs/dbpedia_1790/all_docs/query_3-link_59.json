        "text": "Your Guide to Wedding Terminology\n\nCongratulations on your engagement and upcoming wedding! During the planning process, you will meet with lots of vendors: planners, florists, venue coordinators, and more. Therefore, it’s very helpful to learn some of the wedding terminology or lingo before you start meeting them. That’s why we have compiled a huge, comprehensive list of wedding terminology with definitions. Keep reading to learn all the wedding terminology you may need to know to help you eat, drink, and be married!\n\nWedding Terminology: Wedding Party\n\nBM – Best Man\n\nFOB – Father for the Bride\n\nFOG – Father of the Groom\n\nMOB – Mother of the Bride\n\nMOG – Mother of the Groom\n\nMOH – Maid of Honor\n\nBest Man\n\nThe closest male in the groom’s life is usually chosen to be his best man. It could be a brother, father, son, cousin, or best friend. This person organizes the bachelor party. TIP: In modern weddings, the best man can be either gender.\n\nBridal Party\n\nThe bridal party is your maid and/or matron of honor, bridesmaids, the best man, groomsmen, your ring bearer, and your flower girl. These are the people closest to you, like your best friends or family members. They are there by your side to help you from start to finish to have the best wedding possible.\n\nBridesmaids\n\nThese ladies are your closest girls. They can be sisters of yours or your fiancé, friends, cousins, daughters, etc.\n\nFather of the Bride\n\nThe Father of the Bride is the bride’s Daddy. His role is usually escorting is daughter down the aisle and ‘giving her away’ to her fiancé.\n\nMaid / Matron of Honor\n\nThe Maid of Honor or Matron of Honor is a title is given to a special woman in your life. They will be standing directly beside you on your wedding day and will be your right-hand woman during the planning process and on the day of your wedding. Maid of Honor is the correct title for her if she’s unmarried and Matron of Honor is the correct title is, she’s married. One way to help her stand out from the other bridesmaids it to have her wear a slightly different dress or carry a distinctly different bouquet. TIP: The maid of honor is your go-to for planning your bachelorette party and often times carries a big role during your bridal shower.\n\nGroomsmen\n\nThese guys are your groom’s closest people. They can be brothers of his or yours, friends, cousins, sons, etc., but are the ones who he is closest too.\n\nRing Bearer\n\nThis is a small child, usually a boy, who carries the rings down the aisle and presents them to the couple during the exchange of rings.\n\nFlower Girl\n\nThe young girl that starts your bridal procession by scattering flowers as she walks down the aisle is your flower girl.\n\nPage Boy\n\nA page boy is a small boy who follows the bride down the aisle. His role is to carry her train.\n\nAttendants\n\nAnyone that plays a role in the wedding is an attendant and include the best man, bridesmaids, ushers, flower girls, etc. Attendants are called this because they have roles and responsibilities to “attend” to during the wedding.\n\nUsher\n\nDuring the ceremony, the ushers escort guests to the seats and help to keep things organized before the processional starts. It’s a very important role. Ushers can be friends or family members. Ushers let guests know which seats are reserved and if there is a certain side of the aisle that they should be sitting. TIP: Have your groomsmen dress in attire that matches the groomsmen or wear coordinating attire that is just for them. And be sure to have them wear a boutonniere so they stand out as the ushers.\n\nWedding Terminology: Food, Beverage, & Catering\n\nConsumption Bar\n\nThis setup bills you by the number of drinks that are consumed during your wedding. This is a good option if you don’t have a large number of guests.\n\nFlat-Rate Bar\n\nThis setup bills you by the person, per hour… for example, $35 per person per hour. This is a good option if you have a of guests that like to drink a lot.\n\nCorkage Fee\n\nIf you want to enjoy alcohol at your wedding, it’s going to cost you! Most venues and caterers charge an ‘opening fee’ per bottle of alcohol that you bring. The price can range anywhere from $5-$10 per bottle. TIP: If your caterer or venue provides the alcohol, you may be able to get away with not paying a corkage fee.\n\nFood Station\n\nA food station is a dinner where there are multiple smaller buffets or stations set up through the wedding reception area. Food stations allow your guests to mix and mingle with others while sampling a variety of menu items.\n\nCanapé\n\nA canape is cracker or puff pastry topped with something savory. But, the term can be interchangeable for small bites, hors d’oeuvres, or appetizers that are served before the dinner. TIP: Whatever you choose to serve during cocktail hour, try serving it canape style by making each dish bitesize.\n\nPiping\n\nThis is a technique used to decorate a wedding cake.\n\nCrudités\n\nCrudidés is a fancy word for a simple appetizer of raw vegetables that are cut up and served with dip. Sounds like “veggies and dip” to me!\n\nButtercream\n\nFrosting made of butter, sugar, and milk. The soft, creamy texture makes it the most common (and delicious!) icing for wedding desserts.\n\nFondant\n\nFondant is sweet tasting dough. It’s what gives wedding cakes a smooth exterior. Fondant provides a blank slate for the cake designer to build upon to create a specific look. For example, fondant can be dyed, marbled, molded, shaped, and sculpted to take your cake to an artistic level. It is edible, but some people prefer to remove it before serving cake slices to guest as it can be very sweet and a little gummy.\n\nGanache\n\nThis is a mixture of chocolate and cream, usually used to fill or garnish a wedding cake.\n\nRoyal Icing\n\nThis is a mixture of powdered sugar, water, and meringue powder. Royal Icing holds decorations together.\n\nNaked Cake\n\nYou can easily identify this cake because it has almost no outer layer of frosting. It shows off the cake’s texture and filling. This trend has been around for some time now and has become quite popular.\n\nCutting Cake\n\nThe cutting cake is the cake that gets cut during the reception for the photo purposes. Therefore, it is not usually served to all the guests at the wedding. This is also a more expensive cake.\n\nSheet Cake\n\nThis is t a less expensive cake option but is a little different from your cutting cake typically. This cake usually cut in the kitchen and served to guests as individual slices.\n\nTopper\n\nReferring to the display on top of your wedding cake, this can be a traditional couple figurine or something more modern like laser-cut lettering.\n\nGroom’s Cake\n\nThis is a small cake that represents the groom’s likes. The groom’s cake is served at the rehearsal dinner.\n\nHors d’oeuvres\n\nHors d’oeuvres are appetizers. Served them hot or cold during happy hour, your reception or at a cocktail party.\n\nIn-House Catering\n\nThis means that all of your wedding food and beverages will be handled by the venue, not an outside catering vendor. TIP: In-house caterers know their venue inside and out as well as how to operate within that space. Some venues will require you to use their in-house caterer, so ask about this when you first visit.\n\nMenu Tasting\n\nYour menu tasting is a sampling of the reception food and it happens about a month in advance of your wedding.\n\nCocktail Hour\n\nCocktail hour directly follows the ceremony and is a fun transition between quiet, emotional ceremony and the lively reception. Often times, this is when your photographer will take formal wedding photos of you and your spouse, the wedding party, and your family. To hold a successful cocktail party, you need 3 things: drinks, food, and music. TIP: Consider a signature cocktail, a specific selection of wine or beer, or open bar. Think small bitesize grazing stations where guests have to move about.\n\nBuffet\n\nA catering style where the food in arranged in one place for guests to walk by and take some of what seems enticing. This is an alternative to the usually three-course meal and is less formal.\n\nOpen Bar\n\nIf you have an open bar at your wedding, you are providing your guests a full bar of liquor, wine, and beer. It’s definitely the most expensive route when serving alcohol to your guests, so you may want to get creative if it’s not in your budget.\n\nSignature Cocktail\n\nYay! You are finally married… time to get the party started with cocktail hour. Make the occasion really memorable with a signature cocktail that you and your spouse love. It could be classic, or a creative seasonal concoction crafted by your caterer just for your big day! TIP: Don’t’ forget the sign that tells all of your guests about your signature drink and what’s in it!\n\nWedding Terminology: Floral\n\nFiller\n\nFlowers and foliage “fill” the spaces between flowers in bouquets and floral arrangements. These are filler. They have clusters of individual flowers on a single stem or multiple leaves.\n\nPomander\n\nA pomander is a round bouquet of flowers with a ribbon handle. This is a really cute option for a flower girl who won’t be throwing flowers down the aisle.\n\nCorsage\n\nMothers and grandmothers usually wear corsages. Corsages are petite floral arrangements worn on the wrist. TIP: For a modern twist, swap out the elastic for a metal cuff with flowers attached or a pinned boutonniere.\n\nBoutonniere\n\nFor me, this word is one of the hardest words to spell in the wedding industry. Men traditionally wear a small flower pinned on their left lapel, over their heart. TIP: Consider opting for a boutonniere-style flower for the Mother of the Bride, Mother of the Groom and Grandmas as an alternative to a corsage.\n\nBouquet\n\nA bouquet is a bundles of flowers that you and your bridesmaids carry as you all walk down the aisle. They care range in size from petite (called a nosegay) to large. The shape of your bouquet can make a statement by being lush or more architectural in shape.\n\nNosegay\n\nA small, handheld bouquet of flowers is a nosegay. You will know the bouquet is a nosegay by its petite size and shape. Bridesmaids or junior bridesmaids carry nosegays to contrast in size against your much larger and more ornate flowers.\n\nCenterpiece\n\nThese are arrangements that fill the center of a table. Many times, the centerpiece is a floral arrangement that displays the colors of the wedding. Often you will find some kind of lighting element or an unexpected element like fruit to add beauty and interest.\n\nFlower Wall\n\nThe dramatic installation of florals and greenery on a wall is, just like it sounds, a wall of flowers! It’s major statement piece and makes a gorgeous backdrop for the ceremony and photos. You can also use it later during the day as a creative way to display your escort cards, as a backdrop for a photobooth, or as a play for the band or DJ to set up.\n\nGarland\n\nA strand of greenery or flowers used to decorate any surface or space at your wedding is garland. TIP: Consider combining greenery and flowers to create a garland that will drape the length of the table and drag the floor on either side. Nest votives randomly throughout the garland and add a few taper candles to the display to add a little height to the table and draw the guest’s eyes upward. Wedding photographers love to photograph these kinds of displays in a table scape.\n\nInstallation\n\nNo doubt you have seen the lush floral chandeliers, flower walls, towering arrangements, and waterfall style garlands. They are gorgeous and eye-catching, but they require more time and technique to bring the vision to life in the space to put together. These are installations. And the effect that these installations have on the overall space and your guests is priceless. TIP: If you want a beautiful statement piece but don’t want to blow your budget, consider having one single dramatic installation over the dance floor and simpler centerpieces.\n\nWedding Terminology: Music & Ceremony\n\nFirst Look\n\nThis special moment happens before the ceremony. It’s the time that you reveal your wedding day look to your fiancé and spend time together. Other variations are a first look with your Dad or with your bridesmaids. This is also a great way to gain more photos from your BIG day.\n\nCelebrant / Officiant\n\nThis is the person who actually marries you and your fiancé. The must have the “power” to pronounce you married which is earned by being ordained. So, just about anyone can marry you… so long as they are ordained.\n\nJustice of the Peace\n\nThis is a judge (usually over a local jurisdiction) who is able to perform civil marriages in addition to overseeing court cases. He or she is a secular alternative to a religious leader and can perform your marriage ceremony in a courthouse setting and sometimes at your venue.\n\nVows\n\nThese are the promises make by the wedding couple to each other during the ceremony. These promises usually consists of vows to trust, love, and support one another. While some couples prefer to use more traditional vows or readings, others prefer to write their own.\n\nProcession\n\nThis is the part of the wedding ceremony when each member of your wedding party will walk down the aisle and take their place on the appropriate side. The procession ends with your grand entrance! It specifically refers to the order in which the brides and bridesmaids walk down the aisle toward the awaiting groom and groomsmen.\n\nPrelude\n\nThis is the soft background music at the beginning of the wedding, before the ceremony begins, as guests arrive and are seated. TIP: This is a great way to include your aunt who plays the piano or your 13-year-old cousin that plays the violin, viola, or cello!\n\nProcessional\n\nThe music that plays while your wedding party and ultimately you walk down the aisle. This can be one song or a combination of songs. It’s what officially begins the ceremony.\n\nRecessional\n\nThis is the music that you and your spouse will make your grand exit to followed by your wedding party. Photos during the recessional are some of our favorites from the ceremony. You can just see the joy and happiness on each couple’s faces!\n\nAisle\n\nThe walkway at your ceremony between seating areas for your families and friends that you and your fiancé will walk down. TIP: make sure that there is enough walking room width for your dress and whoever is going to walk you down the aisle, so you don’t brush any decorations on the outsides of the rows.\n\nAlter\n\nSpecifically, this is the structure or table at the front of the house of worship. In a wedding, the altar is the physical spot where you and your fiancé exchange your vows during religious and non-religious ceremonies.\n\nWedding Terminology: Dress Shops\n\nSample Sale\n\nTrying to save money on your wedding dress? Look for sample sales at your local bridal salons. Salons run these kinds of sales from time to time in order to clear out the existing inventory and make room for new inventory. Chances are, you can buy the dress of your dreams at an incredible price. Just remember that samples have been tried on by other brides, so your dress may need to be cleaned before you walk down the aisle. The bridal salon can recommend a local dry cleaner and seamstress make your off-the-rack dress look and feel like it’s brand new.\n\nTrunk Show\n\nWhen bridal salons hold sample sales, they are making room for new merchandise. One of the best ways to purchase a made-to-order wedding dress is from the newest collection is to attend their trunk show. Often times the designer will attend. So why should you shop for your dress during a trunk show? Most bridal salons don’t carry every dress in a designer’s line, but those additional dresses may be displayed during the trunk show which means the selection will be bigger. Bridal salons often offer special pricing during the show, so you mind find your dream dress for less. And finally, when the designer is in the bridal salon with you, they can share customization options like a slight neckline change or a different fabric type.\n\nAppliqué\n\nThis term is used a lot at wedding dress shops. Appliqués are 3D, textured designs created from pieces of lace or fabric that is sewn onto a base fabric. One of my favorite appliqué ideas is putting your wedding date on the underside of your wedding gown.\n\nA-Line\n\nThis is the most universally flattering dress style. It’s slim through the bodice and gradually flares out from the waist forming a soft “A” shape.\n\nBodice\n\nThe bodice is the upper part of your wedding dress that goes around your ribcage. It connects the neckline, bust and waistline. The bodice’s fit is the most important because the lower part normally has a looser or more forgiving fit.\n\nAlterations\n\nAlterations are adjustments made to your wedding dress by a seamstress to custom fit it to your body. Because most wedding dresses and bridesmaids’ dresses are not usually custom-made, alterations are needed to ensure a perfect fit. TIP: Altering and tailoring are the same thing, just like a seamstress and tailor are the same.\n\nBall Gown\n\nThis style of wedding dress is the most formal. It has a traditional shape and is fitted through the bodice and dramatically flares away from the body into a full skirt. TIP: This style of wedding dress often needs a crinoline to help hold the shape and extra floofing before you walk down the aisle.\n\nCrinoline\n\nYour bridal stylist is an expert in helping you choose the right underpinning for your wedding dress. You’ll be able to accentuate the line of almost any style wedding gown you chose with a bridal slip. A poofy crinoline will add dimension and fluff to your ballgown skirts, while a tiered slip with a train will support any softly layered skirt.\n\nFloof\n\nThis is another way of saying fluff your wedding dress.\n\nFit-and-Flare\n\nThe fit-and-flare style of wedding dress is fitted through the bodice and hips and softly flares out just below the hip line.\n\nMermaid\n\nThis style of wedding dress tightly hugs the torso and hips and the mermaid skirt dramatically flares out from the knee or just below it.\n\nEmpire\n\nThis style of wedding dress is a high-waisted style that cinches just below the bust line. TIP: This is a fantastic wedding dress style for pregnant bride or brides with curvy figures.\n\nSheath\n\nThis style of wedding dress has very little structure. It is a long, narrow, close-to-the-body style wedding dress that is designed to loosely show off your curves.\n\nBateau or Boat Neck\n\nThis style of wedding dress has a wide, modest neckline that runs horizontally across the collarbone from shoulder to shoulder. TIP: A great example of this neckline is Megan Markle’s wedding dress!\n\nQueen Ann Neckline\n\nStrapless, V-neck, off-the-shoulder… so many terms. So, what exactly is a Queen Anne neckline? This neckline is so flattering and frames your face while making you feel royal. Wedding dresses with this neckline will have a high back and sleeves and a sweetheart neckline. Cap sleeves and full-length sleeves are the most common. The neckline accents your chest and neck while keeping your shoulders coverage which is a beautiful compromise for any bride who wants to modestly show a little skin. TIP: You can also achieve this same look by wearing a jacket over a strapless gown that has a sweetheart neckline.\n\nIllusion Neckline\n\nAn illusion neckline is made from tulle, net, or lace. It’s a panel of sheer fabric attached to the bodice that extends to the collar. TIP: This is a great option for the bride who wants coverage at the top, but also wants a sweetheart neckline.\n\nSweetheart Neckline\n\nThis neckline has a distinctive heart shape and is perfect for the bride who wants to enhance or create the illusion of curves. It also lengthens the neck and adds balance to the brides’ overall shape.\n\nConvertible Dress\n\nA convertible dress is a wedding dress that can be worn multiple ways. For example, a wedding dress with a detachable skirt is a convertible dress.\n\nSheet Lace\n\nSheet lace is a soft, delicate type of lace that lays over another fabric. It has a consistent pattern. Sheet lace is typical on wedding dresses and bridesmaids’ dresses.\n\nEmbroidered Lace\n\nEmbroidery is a detailed stitching pattern that is bolder and more patterned than sheet lace.\n\nGusset\n\nA gusset is a diamond or triangle piece of fabric. The gusset is added to the side of your wedding dress or a bridesmaid’s dress when the dress is too small.\n\nSilhouette\n\nAs it applies to weddings, this refers to the shape of various wedding dress styles. Experts will refer to the different styles by their silhouette name most often. These include ballgown, fit-and-flare, mermaid, and more.\n\nBustle\n\nBustling is a tailoring trick used to allow you to walk and dance in your wedding dress after the ceremony and photos are done. It’s a series of loops and buttons that creatively pull up, tuck, and shorten the back of your dress so you can move around easily. There are two types of bustle: French bustle and American bustle. The French bustle tucks most of the train up and under your dress. Because it attaches to the underside of your dress, most of your train will be hidden. The American bustle is the opposite… it attaches on the outside of your dress and pulls the train up towards your waist to create a pretty drape that’s visible from the outside. The dress shop or seamstress will help determine which bustle is most flattering to your dress at your fitting.\n\nGarter\n\nThe wedding garter is a piece of lingerie that you wear under your wedding dress just above the knee. During the reception, your groom will remove the garter from underneath your dress and toss it the single guys. It’s very similar to the bouquet toss… the bachelor that catches the garter is believed to be the next one to marry.\n\nTrain\n\nThe train is an extension on your wedding dress, and it can range from a few inches to multiple feet trailing behind you. A dramatically long train makes a grand entrance. Most guests will be looking at the back of your dress during the ceremony so pay attention to the train and how the back looks. Bustling the train on your wedding dress is a must if you want to be able to move about freely and dance during your reception. TIP: Don’t forget to have your wedding planner fluff your dress and train just before you walk down the aisle for maximum drama. And be sure to have your train bustled so you or someone else doesn’t trip on it during your reception.\n\nWatteau-Length\n\nA watteau train attaches to the shoulders and falls loosely to the hem of the dress creating a dramatic cape-like effect.\n\nSweep-Length\n\nA sweep train, also called a “brush,” train. It extends a foot or less from where the dress fabric hits the floor. A sweep train is subtle, yet romantic.\n\nCourt-Length\n\nA court train extends two feet from where the fabric hits the floor. It extends one foot beyond the sweep train.\n\nChapel-Length\n\nA chapel train is one of the most popular train styles. A chapel train extends three to four-and-a-half feet from the waistline.\n\nCathedral-Length\n\nA cathedral train is formal style train that extends six to seven-and-half feet from the waistline and has a dramatic look and feel.\n\nMonarch-Length\n\nA Monarch train, as “royal” train, is a very formal style train that flows 12 feet or more from the waist.\n\nTulle\n\nVeils and wedding dresses are made from a fine mesh called tulle. Tulle is commonly used in princess gowns to add extra ‘floof’.\n\nTemple Ready\n\nTemple ready means the dress is acceptable for the place of worship, such as the temple. To be temple worthy, the wedding dress should be white, which is symbolic for purity, with a high neckline, long sleeves, and a floor-length skirt. An off-the-rack wedding dress can be altered to meet the temple-ready requirements.\n\nWedding Terminology: Wedding Planning\n\nWedding Planner\n\nThis is a wedding progression hired to orchestrate your wedding from start to finish. This person handles all of the pre-wedding planning, set-up and installation for your BIG day, and keeps you on time according to your timeline on the BIG day.\n\nWedding Coordinator\n\nMost wedding planners offer coordination services, but a wedding coordinator specifically keeps contact with all of the vendors and serves as a liaison for you and your fiancé. Most wedding coordinators offer month-of, week-of, and day-of services.\n\nDay-Of Coordinator\n\nIf your wedding budget won’t allow for a full-service wedding planner, consider hiring a day-of coordinator. They are professionals who take over the production side of your wedding day by overseeing set-up and making sure your timeline runs smoothly. This is very important! By hiring a day-of coordinator, you are free to focus on being a Bride and you and your loved ones can celebrate your marriage rather than stress over whether or not they brought your wedding day vision to life.\n\nFull Planning\n\nThis is a wedding planning and coordination combination for couples who want a full-time wedding planning professional to oversee every single aspect of their wedding planning process and their wedding day. Full planning includes vendor management, scheduling, marriage license, tracking RSVPs, creating the planning timeline, and overseeing the big day itself, etc.\n\nPartial Planning\n\nThis is for the couple who needs some help but has also got the majority of the planning done. It usually involves month-of wedding coordination and some additional planning services for a set number of hours determined by the couple. This is very helpful for couples who want to be very involved in the planning but need professional coordination as the day gets closer.\n\nKickback\n\nIt’s important to ask your vendors if they receive referral commissions or kickbacks when they refer you to another vendor in their network of friends before you sign a contract. Kickbacks are an amount of money that a vendor receives in return for getting a client to hire another vendor. For example, a wedding planner may get kickbacks from a florist if you hire them based on the wedding planner’s recommendation. Just have a conversation before you sign a contract to make sure that you aren’t paying a premium to cover a communion that will be paid as an incentive for a recommendation. TIP: The best time to have this conversation is when you discuss pricing and fees with each vendor.\n\nRain Plan\n\nYour rain plan is the wedding day backup plan for in case of rain and inclement weather.\n\nWedding Terminology: Reception Details & Decor\n\nPalette\n\nThe word palette refers to your selected group of colors for your wedding day. Your palette usually features three colors – a main color, a neutral, and an accent. It influences everything related to your wedding from the linens to the flowers, even down to the color of ink that will be printed on your invitation suite. TIP: You may want to include a few different shades of a color in your palette like blush, pink, and fuchsia.\n\nMood Board\n\nA collection of images and swatches that you gather together to use as inspiration for your wedding day vibe and design and then mounted onto a board is called a mood board. This is very helpful when you are trying to convey your overall design and vision for your wedding to other vendors. Your wedding planner can help you put your mood board together. TIP: Take your mood board with you when you visit with vendors and go shopping for your wedding. It will help keep your design and overall vision on track and help your vendors to visually understand your goals.\n\nFloor Plan\n\nThis is the layout of your reception area. It’s a bird’s eye view of your reception area specifying where tables, chairs, wedding cake, head table, dance floor, etc. will all be located.\n\nSeating Chart\n\nThis is a complete list of all of the guests that will be attending your wedding and where they will be sitting. From this, you can make the Escort Cards, Escort Card Display, or Place Cards.\n\nEscort Card\n\nPlace cards (covered below) and escort cards are often used interchangeably. Escort cards are displayed clos tot the entrance of the reception space to direct each guest to an assigned dinner table.\n\nEscort Card Display\n\nRather than displaying several individual escort cards, many couples are choosing to have a sign that is a statement piece at their wedding. In an escort card display, the table assignments are notated larger on the sign with the guest names arranged below.\n\nPlace Card\n\nIf you recall, the escort card tells your guests what table they will be sitting at during the reception. Once your guests reach their table, the place card tells them exactly which seat is theirs. If your wedding is less formal, you could choose to omit place cards altogether giving your guests the open seating option. Your escort card will tell each guest which table is theirs, but once they find that table, they can choose their own chair. TIP: If your wedding is a formal affair or black tie, it’s essential to use place cards and carefully choose the seating arrangement in advance.\n\nHead Table\n\nPerhaps you have heard of the sweetheart table? Well, this is just like that, only bigger. It’s a larger VIP table where you and your spouse sit, surrounded by your wedding party and/or families. Usually, the head table is centered off to the right of the dance floor for best views of the toasts. And it will often times have more elaborate decorations than the other tables in the reception area.\n\nPlace Setting\n\nThe place setting is the grouping of items that sits on the table in front of each guests chair around the table. Place settings can be very simple or quite elaborate. Often times the place setting is more elaborate than what you’d see at home because of the large number of courses served. A customary place setting at a formal wedding would include a charger, a dinner plate, a salad plate, a bread plate with bread knife, salad and dinner forks, salad and dinner knives, a soup spoon, a dessert spoon and fork, a water glass, and at least one wine glass. TIP: Try to coordinate your place setting color and style with the florals on the table, the linens, and the printed menu. This will not only support for color palette but also make for beautiful detail shots in your wedding album.\n\nCandle\n\nThere are so many names for various sizes of candles. Tealights are small, ½ inch tall candles that offer delicate low light. Floating candles are round candles that are designed to displace more water by weight than the candle weighs. So, when placed in water, it floats. Some tea lights can float, but it’s best to go with a traditional floating candle. Next is the votive candle. It’s 1 ½ inches tall and is often tucked into centerpieces and scattered throughout the room. Taper candles are tall, skinny candlesticks that can be arranged in elegant candle holders or clustered together in a classic candelabra for a statement. Pillars are classic and elegant candles don’t have to be paired with any holder or base and provide ample light. They often come in thick cylindrical or square shapes and are versatile enough to work in the majority of lighting designs.\n\nCharger\n\nWe’re not talking about your cell phone cord here. In the world of weddings, a charger is a larger sized plate that is the base of your place setting. It essentially takes the place of the placemat. Each plated course is set on top of your charger to give a bit more glam to the table.\n\nSweetheart Table\n\nA sweetheart table is a table that has been set for two, you two. This is a great option for couples who want to enjoy dinner during the reception together. TIP: Don’t forget to display signage and decorate the table and chairs to make your sweetheart table really special.\n\nTablescape\n\nWhen the entire table design comes together, you get a tablescape. From the plates to the flowers, the flatware to the candles, every detail matters. As you are envisioning your wedding design think about the overall picture and how it will look in your wedding photos. Work with your wedding planner, florist, and rental company to design the finishing touches that will make your guests say, “wow!” while bringing your vision to reality.\n\nUnderlay\n\nAn underlay is full-length linen that falls to the floor found under the overlay.\n\nOverlay\n\nAn overlay is a directive cloth extending halfway down the table to add color or texture. It is over top of the underlay.\n\nBouquet Toss\n\nThis tradition is a ceremonial gesture, and the woman who catches the bouquet is going to be the next to marry.\n\nGrand Exit\n\nAs the night begins to end, complete it with a grand exit as you enter into your married life together. Sparklers, glow sticks, confetti, rice, bird seed, bubbles, fireworks… whatever you choose to represent that the party is over, but your life together is just beginning, make sure it’s special and represents you.\n\nGrand Entrance / Introduction\n\nIntroducing Mr. and Mrs. is when the couple is introduced for the first time as husband and wife and they enter the reception area in grand style.\n\nReceiving Line\n\nYour receiving line is made up of you and your fiancé, both sets of parents, and your bridal party. Everyone forms a line welcoming your guests outside the reception entrance. This is a great time to get in your hello’s and to thank your guests for coming.\n\nFirst Dance\n\nFor you and your fiancé, the first dance is something special to look forward too. Most couples choose a song that is special both of them and that they will remember always. After the bride and groom dance, the bride and her father will get to dance together as well as the groom and his mother. Some couples choose to take dance lessons for this occasion for a choreographed touch.\n\nToast\n\nDuring the reception, the Best Man and Maid or Matron of Honor toasts. Many times, the parents of the Bride and Groom say a few words as well. Some toasts are quite long, and some are short, sweet, and funny.\n\nMaster of Ceremonies\n\nThe master of ceremonies is also referred to at the toastmaster. This person basically hosts the wedding reception. They announce the toasts, introduce the newlyweds when they enter the wedding reception.\n\nRSVP\n\nRSVP is short for the French phrase ‘Répondez, s’il vous plaît! Including an RSVP card in your invitation suite is the polite way to request that your guests let you know if they will be attending your wedding by a certain date. Most invitation suites include a self-addressed stamped envelope so your guests specify how many people will be attending and drop it right in the mail. Nowadays, a URL where guests can RSVP online is helpful. TIP: Include details about the menu so your guests can make their selections. You may even want to take requests for music that will be played during the reception and give that to your DJ.\n\nVenue\n\nThis is the location that your wedding will happen. You may need to distinguish between wedding venue and reception venue if you have different locations for both.\n\nWalk-Through\n\nWhen you go see a venue for the first time, you are doing the initial walk-through. This time is for you to ask questions and see if the venue is right for your wedding. When you get to see the venue one last time before the BIG day, this is your pre-wedding walk-though. During this time, you will finalize the details and make any last adjustments before you walk down the aisle.\n\nVendor Meal\n\nSometimes an additional meal may be needed for a vendor that will be working at the event itself. For instance, vendors that may request meals are photographers or videographers. They are there for the entire duration of the wedding and will need to eat.\n\nVenue Coordinator\n\nThis is your point-personal at the venue that will book your wedding. This person will help with and services that are in-house, such as catering and alcohol.

These are stencils that are placed on the front of lights. They used in your reception area to create a pattern that can be projected on a floor or wall. You can create an immersive experience for your guests by shining a light with a leaf or floral pattern stencil on the wall. TIP: Work with your lighting designer to create a custom monogram stencil to shine on your reception area dance floor.\n\nUp lighting\n\nThese are special lights placed on the ground pointed up around the perimeter of a tent or space in a venue to illuminate the walls or the ceiling. TIP: Use colored up lights to help you create that special look or feel.\n\nWedding Terminology: Guests\n\nGuest List\n\nA list of guests made by the Bride and Groom to make sure they invite they want to attend their wedding.\n\nGuest Book\n\nThis is a small book that your wedding guests sign, write a brief comment, or share a memory of the wedding day to look back on with happy memories.\n\nPlus-One\n\nThis is a big part of the planning process, and for good reason! A plus one is an additional invitation for a wedding guest so they can invite a date. As you massage the guest list to stay within your budget, you may decide to give some guests the plus one option and not others. And that’s totally okay! There are not hard and fast rules… the plus ones are determined by your budget, wedding size, and your overall vision for you big day. TIP: Generally married couples and established couples, and couples that live together get the plus ones. It’s also courteous to extend a plus one to any guests that may not now anyone else at the wedding.\n\nFavor\n\nThanking your guests with a take-hoe gift or treat is very thoughtful. These gifts can be whatever you want! TIP: You guest may appreciate an edible treat to take home after dancing at your reception for several hours. Consider a custom-made piece of chocolate wrapped in a cute box with each guest’s name written in calligraphy on the exterior.\n\nWelcome Bag\n\nThis is a gesture meant to great your out-of-town guests. It can be a box or a bag and as simple or complex as you’d like. Ideas for things to include are the weekend’s itinerary and something edible. So, you could include a small bottle of wine, snacks, water, etc. TIP: Make sure you include a thank you note for your out-of-town guests in each bag. It lets them know you were thinking of them and makes it personal.\n\nOut-of-Town Guest\n\nAny guest who needs to book a hotel in order to attend your wedding is considered an out-of-town guest. This isn’t the guest who wants a hotel just so they don’t have to drive home after they party the night away with you. AS a courtesy, many couples invite their out-of-town guests to a welcome event that follows the rehearsal dinner. The welcome event could range from a full dinner to just drinks and deserts. TIP: consider giving your out-of-town guests a welcome back with a little gift. It’s a nice touch especially if the wedding destination comes with unique needs. You could give a reusable water bottle for a wedding held in the mountains with high altitude or a small bottle of sunscreen is your getting married on the beach.\n\nRoom Block\n\nWhen you block off 10+ rooms at a hotel or hotels for out-of-town guests you are creating a room block. These rooms are especially helpful for guests to locate a convenient place to stay while they are in town for the wedding. TIP: Ask for discounts for your room block since you are booking so many rooms.\n\nWedding Terminology: Wedding Types\n\nDestination Wedding\n\nDestination weddings are the best of both worlds: vacation and marriage… it’s a fantastic way to share a place that you love with the people closest to you while getting married. So, what qualifies as a destination? Really, any location where you and your guests will need to book a hotel rather than drive home at the end of the night. Your destination wedding could be several hours drive or require a long flight. Either way is perfect so long as it creates an intimate and personal experience that you can share with your guests.\n\nElopement\n\nThis is an extremely small ceremony where only the couple and a witness attend. It’s often performed in secret although not always.\n\nMinimony\n\nA minimony is a commitment ceremony between you and your partner and can include up to 10 people so long as social distancing measures are adhered to. If gathering limits are in place in your state, it’s strongly encouraged that you hold a minimony on your actual wedding day and hold off on the large celebration, or sequel wedding, until it’s safer.\n\nMicro-Wedding\n\nA micro-wedding is smaller than an intimate wedding but larger than a minimony. A typical guest list would include up to 50 guests and super-close friends.\n\nIntimate Wedding\n\nThis is a wedding where the guest list is under 75 people.\n\nWedding Terminology: Engagement\n\nFiancé\n\nThis is the title given to the groom after the engagement until the marriage meaning engaged to be married.\n\nFiancée\n\nThis is the title of the bride after she’s engaged until her wedding day meaning engaged to be married.\n\nWedding Website\n\nMany wedding couples use a wedding website to display all important info about their wedding online.

A Tux is commonly worn with a bowtie and cummerbund.\n\nWaistcoat\n\nThis is the vest worn by men over a shirt and under a jacket.\n\nCummerbund\n\nThis is the broad waistband worn in place of a vest.\n\nCufflinks\n\nThis is a device used for fastening two sides of a shirt cuff together. These also make great wedding gifts to your fiancé. TIP: Consider purchasing custom cufflinks for a personal touch. And be sure to let your photographer know so they can include them in the photos.\n\nVeil\n\nA veil is hair accessory that makes a bride look and feel like a bride.

We suggest the chapel-length or cathedral-length for best results.\n\nBlusher Veil\n\nA blusher is short, single layer veil worn over the face. It’s flipped back once the bride reaches the altar or right before the big first kiss! It’s about 30 inches in length.\n\nClassic Veil\n\nThis veil is a “U” shaped veil that has been gathered onto a comb. This is the most common veil style and will compliment almost any dress style.

TIP: This is a create veil option for a bride that wants a vintage look.\n\nBirdcage Veil\n\nThis veil is made from birdcage netting instead of tulle or chiffon and is very similar to a blusher. A birdcage veil is typically 9-10 inches in length.\n\nBlack Tie\n\nIf the wedding is formal and a black-tie dress code is expected, this will be indicated on the wedding invitation. Formal weddings generally happen after 6pm and men should wear a tuxedo. Women should wear either a long formal evening gown or a short, formal cocktail dress.\n\nBlack Tie Optional\n\nThis phrase tells us that the dress code for the wedding is a very dressy. When choosing your attire, choose something slightly more casual than black tie or black tie. Women should opt for wearing a formal gown whether long or short and men should wear a suit. Of course, dressing in a tuxedo and evening gown will still be appropriate.\n\nCocktail Attire\n\nCocktail attire is semi-formal wear. For men, a nice classic suit, shirt, and tie along with dress shoes would be acceptable.

Generally only women are invited and sometimes it can include alcohol, games and some sort of hired entertainment. TIP: for a classier option, include wine tours or destination weekends away.\n\nRehearsal Dinner\n\nThis dinner is pre-wedding, usually the night before the big day, and follows the actual rehearsal. That’s how it got its name. The dinner typically includes, you and your finance, your wedding party and your families, although there is not a hard a fast rule on this. TIP: Consider inviting your out-of-town guests to your rehearsal dinner as well as your close friends.\n\nWedding Terminology: Printed Details\n\nSave the Date\n\nOne of the best ways to tell your guests to put your big day on their calendar before you have enough details in place to send out invitations is with a save the date. They are especially helpful is your big day is a destination wedding or on a really popular date, like a holiday weekend. The sooner you let your guests know, the better. And your guests will know to expect an invitation before they make any other plans. TIP: If you have a wedding website, be sure to include the URL on the save the date so your guests can start following along. As details become available, you can provide information on lodging and travel tips so your guests can begin planning to attend.\n\nInvitation Suite\n\nAn invitation suite will generally include the save the date, invitation, RSVP card, and may also include additional information on a card that needs to be featured like your wedding website URL or travel information.

TIP: When planning your wedding day timeline, consider the time of day that the sun will set.

Having a second photographer means one photographer can be dedicated to the bride and one can be dedicated to the groom, more coverage, more angles, more candid moments captured, and an enhanced experience. The second shooter will look to capture candid moments and different angles than what your lead photographer is capturing. TIP: Look for a photographer that has a designated second shooter. This means that they will anticipate each other’s moves and be able to offer better coverage and capture more images that will benefit you in the long run.\n\nWedding Day Questionnaire\n\nThe wedding day questionnaire is essential for your wedding photographer. It includes details for your wedding day like the getting ready location, first look location, portrait groups and what time they will happen, locations for the ceremony, reception, and portraits, details about special items, events, and wedding colors, a list of all vendors, and details for your exit.

This allows your photographer the most freedom to edit and retouch your photos. High-resolution images / digital files are not the RAW files. These are .PNG or .JPEG files that have been edited. You do not want the RAW files; they will not be edited and are extremely large files. You also special software to open a raw file.

Couples are personalizing their photo booths for a personalized experience. Modern photo booths can upload photos directly to social media whereas retro versions print Polaroid prints automatically for you. TIP: Be sure to look for full-service companies that can bring backdrops and props.\n\nNatural Light\n\nRather than using flash (on or off the camera), natural light photographers use the natural light found during golden hour to light the photo. The look is warm and natural. The photographer must be skilled enough to deal with shadows and ever-changing lighting as the sun sets.\n\nArtistic\n\nWith this style, the photographer’s interpretation of a scene or composition allows for a different perspective. For example, the couple may not be looking at the camera, but rather off to the side. If you don’t want photos that to look like anything you’ve seen on the internet, choose with a photographer who is able to use artistic flare to tell your story.\n\nClassic\n\nClassic images are the ones that your parents are going to want and the style that you will want to include in your wedding album or turn into wall art. These images stand the test of time; they are striking, gorgeous and a bit formal. Classic photos reflect reality (similar to documentary), but they’re created with the photographer’s artistic eye.\n\nDocumentary\n\nRather than posed or highly styled shots, documentary photography captures candid or spontaneous pictures of people, décor and action while it’s happening. These shots feel “real”, like you were there in the moment.\n\nDramatic\n\nLighting plays a large role in how dramatic a shot is. By using an off-camera flash, a key component of dramatic photography, a photographer can create one-of-a-kind images that will take the viewer’s breath away. If the lighting outside isn’t cooperating, the photographer can use lighting equipment to create a gorgeous effect.\n\nCandid\n\nThis take on wedding photography is mostly natural with almost no direction. Candid photography is best when the subject isn’t aware of the photographer. The end result is a beautiful, relaxed, natural image. A good photographer will look for moments that help set the scene and tell the story.\n\nStyled Shoot\n\nIt’s not hard to fall in love with the beautiful photos you see in all of the wedding magazines. Sometimes, those beautiful weddings are staged in the form of a styled shoot. It’s a great way for vendors to unleash their creative juices in a collaborative effort to build the portfolios of everyone involved. But styled shoots are not real weddings.\n\nReal Wedding\n\nIf you see the term ‘real wedding’, that means that the couple was a real bride and groom who actually got married. Real weddings tell the story of a real-life couple, from how they met to saying their “I Do’s”. If you are lucky enough to find a wedding photographer who submits their work to various magazines and blogs, your actual wedding could be featured!! TIP: If this is something that interests you, be sure to talk to your wedding planner and photographer so they can make sure to get those ‘key photos’ that editors look for when publishing real weddings.\n\nVideographer\n\nLike your wedding photographer, you’ll be thankful that you added this fantastic addition to your team of vendors. The videographer is looking to capture every aspect of your wedding day from getting ready to your grand exit. However, they are recording video clips from the day, not still images like a photographer. Through skilled editing, you can relieve your wedding day over and over again through a full-length video or wedding trailer.\n\nCinematic Style\n\nTo create a cinematic wedding video, your videographer will cut, edit, and splice their footage to make scenes that flow together like a real movie. The events may not be in sequential order. For example, clips of the vows might be interspersed with clips from the dance floor. By doing this, the videographer is making a more artful depiction of your wedding day’s events.\n\nDocumentary Style\n\nThis style of wedding videography is very common and is sometimes called video journalism. Documentary style shows all of the day’s events in the order that they occurred and is edited in a straightforward, non-cinematic style.\n\nFull-Length Video\n\nA full-length video is would include all of the day’s important moments in their entirety. The exact length of a full-length wedding video varies from wedding to wedding because each wedding’s length and elements will be different.\n\nHighlight Reel\n\nA highlight reel is usually 5- to 15-minutes long and includes just the highlights from your wedding day. For example, the vows, the cake cutting, the toasts and the dances, etc.\n\nWedding Trailer\n\nA wedding trailer is a 3- to 5-minute-long video that wraps up the day in one pretty, shareable package. Wedding trailers are usually edited in a cinematic style to include different scenes from the day blended with music. It can include vows, interviews with your family and wedding party, or just music only. Most videographers will provide a link so you can share your trailer online.\n\nB-Roll\n\nThese are the clips shot of the scenery, the venue, the décor, guests milling around, etc. It’s basically footage that isn’t a specific wedding moment but acts as filler to further tell the wedding day story. Videographers can use these clips in wedding videos to help set the scene or as a transition.\n\nDSLR Camera\n\nMany videographers use high-definition DSLR cameras (digital single-lens reflex) to achieve a sharp, high-quality video. It’s likely the same type of digital camera your photographer is using for your still wedding photos.\n\nPost Production\n\nAlso known as editing, this is everything that your videographer or photographer does between when the cameras stops and when you receive your completed video or photos. It’s the process of culling and re-touching images or splicing together clips and adding music, and words to create the type of finished product you want.\n\nSame-Day Video Edit\n\nA same-day video edit is a short wedding highlight that you can watch at your wedding! An editor will step out mid-reception with a laptop computer to quickly edit clips to create a brief highlight video that includes getting ready, the ceremony, and possibly even your grand entrance to your reception.\n\nWedding Day Timeline\n\nThis is schedule for the day of your wedding broken down into 30- or 60- minute increments. This is extremely important if you want your ceremony to happen as the sun is setting. Your wedding planner, photographer, videographer, etc. will need a detailed copy. Your guests and wedding party will appreciate a less detailed version, so they know what to expect next. TIP: Build in more time than you think you will need. As much as you plan for your wedding day to run smoothly or on time, there are always things that happen to throw off the schedule. So, building in extra time will help to keep you on time.\n\nBride’s Details\n\nA photographer or videographer will want to document all of the little details that you put so much time and effort into planning. Examples of bride’s details are the items she chose to represent her “something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue “, her flowers, her veil, her jewelry, the rings, her shoes, the wedding invitation suite, etc. All of this may be forgotten overtime without photos or videos of these little details that helped to make your wedding day so special and personal.\n\nGroom‘s Details\n\nA photographer or videographer will want to document all of the little details to go into how your groom looks. This could be his tie, tiepin, jacket, shoes, socks, suspenders, belt, flask, cufflinks, boutonniere, etc. These are often overlooked or seen as not as important, but they are just as important as the bride’s details. Documenting these details will prevent you and your groom from forgetting them as you grow old together."
