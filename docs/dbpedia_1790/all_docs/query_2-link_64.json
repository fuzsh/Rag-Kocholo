        "text": "What I’m really thinking when I say brides, bridalwear etc\n\nMy blog post that’s currently blowing up (for me; everything’s relative) about making wedding dresses for people of all genders and sexes included this side note about the term ‘bridalwear’:\n\nI use the term bridalwear as loosely as possible because not all of my customers identify as brides. I try to use more inclusive terms where I can. I specialise in dresses and the traditionally more feminine styles of weddingwear such as dresses, veils, jumpsuits and separates rather than men’s suiting and tailoring and I’m still answerable to the SEO gods – I need people to find me! As language, attitudes and social mores evolve, this will change of course. In the meantime, I’m always happy to learn and stand corrected if I’m saying or doing something deplorable.\n\nI want to elaborate. I almost always do.\n\nIt’s a topic very close to my heart, my family and my English Language degree.\n\nI can’t do away with the term. At least not yet.\n\nMany of my customers not only identify as a bride but embrace the (hopefully) once in a lifetime opportunity to be The Bride. I don’t want to deny them that.\n\nWhen I know someone is happy to be called a bride, I will use the term for that individual in my conversations with them and in describing them publicly.\n\nOthers don’t. I equally don’t want to force an erroneous identity on them or make them feel excluded or othered. I always endeavour to check. Some prefer marrier, partner, or something else.\n\nWhen I’m talking generally about unknown individuals, I use inclusive, gender-neutral language such as couples, spouse, nearly-weds or customers.\n\nI completed an LBGTQ Awareness Course four years ago with the sadly now defunct Wedding Business School a few years back.\n\nI’d hoped to revisit it for this post but will have to rely on my memory. Quite rightly, it advocated gender-neutral terms.\n\nBut I’m finding it tricky to describe what I do, and who I do it for, without saying bridal or bridalwear.\n\nI could – and do – say I make wedding dresses, but I don’t just make those; I make veils, jumpsuits, playsuits and separates including trousers, skirts, capes and overskirts too. My very first foray into creating wedding outfits was inspired by the bow-ties and masculine tailoring of Marlene Dietrich in the film Morocco.\n\nAnd I love throwing androgynous flamboyance into the mix, like I did when I created the Skye shirt-cape:\n\nBut if I say I make wedding outfits or weddingwear, that feels like it covers more than I actually do, because I don’t make traditional menswear like tailcoats, shirts, waistcoats and morning suits.\n\nSo I don’t want to waste anyone’s time by contacting me about making them something I don’t make.\n\nAnd I do want to stay visible in search results when people look for “bridalwear near me”. Don’t even get me started on hashtags. I have to use the hashtags that people looking for the kind of things I make use so they can find me.\n\nHow about emojis? Decorative, convenient shorthand, especially where there are character limits. When there are gender neutral options, I use those. If I can use female, male and non-binary together, so much the better.\n\nFor example, on my Instagram, I have a highlight featuring my customers in my creations on their wedding days. Originally I called it Real Brides, which was the maximum character limit that would stay visible on my profile. When I realised this was not only not inclusive but also inaccurate, I changed it to Real Customers, but only Real Custom remained visible and just looked odd. Similarly, Real Weddings became Real Weddin.\n\nEmojis to the rescue. Then I had to pick which skin colours to include (and exclude). ARGH!\n\nUltimately, I have carved a career out of celebrating individuality. That’s what bespoke is.\n\nSo whoever you are and however you identify, please know that I see you, I love you and I’m just waiting for the language and SEO gods to catch up.\n\n*Venue: @weddings_the_boat_shed_salt\n\nPhotography: @photosbypaloma\n\nBridalwear: me! @hollywintercouture\n\nModel: @gabbywaite97\n\nFlowers: @lilybee822\n\nJeweller: @bishboshbecca\n\nHeadpieces: @peacock_and_pearl\n\nShoes: @irregularchoice\n\nHair and make-up: @tonisearlemua\n\nCakes: @annalewiscakes\n\nMobile bar: @effervescerefreshments\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDressmakers are awesome. I love my network.\n\nPerhaps we should be rivals, but we don’t see it that way. There’s plenty of work to go around and we need to know who we can recommend when we’re fully booked. And you can’t work in weddings and not have at least one back-up plan if something takes you out of action in peak season; last year for example, just as I recovered from Covid, I broke my arm. The year before, I’d picked up brides when a dressmaker friend broke her leg.\n\nWe have Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups and Christmas parties. We celebrate each other’s new shop openings, dress designs, birthdays and business anniversaries.\n\nMore tellingly, we are open and vulnerable with each other. We ask for advice and help. We admit when we don’t know the technique for something or have never used a particular machine or stitch.\n\nEven better, within minutes usually, someone provides the answer and willingly, voluntarily, steps in to teach what we need to know.\n\nLast month, I wanted to know how to do a delicate edging stitch I’d seen at the V&A’s Chanel exhibition. Unfortunately in that case, it turned out I would need two new machines: a picot hemming machine and a time machine, because picot hemming machines haven’t been manufactured for a century, BUT it was dressmakers in my network who told me this.\n\nAnyway. I’m going to go against the sisterhood grain here and call someone out, albeit not by name.\n\nI’d made a veil a bride not local to me who was having her dress altered by someone else. I’d made her friend’s wedding dress a few years back and included a bustle hook as standard, and she asked her seamstress to add one to her dress. She even described quite specifically the type she wanted (there are several).\n\nWhen she went to pick her dress up, there was no bustle hook. Instead, the seamstress handed her these three safety pins.\n\nThere are bustle pins you can buy, but I’ve never recommended them. Figuring out which bits of many layers to attach them to, usually at the point of the wedding when most people have had a few sherberts, is not simple. Worse, they make holes in the fabric, and my bride asked whether this would happen.\n\n“Yes,” was the response, “but hopefully no-one will see them.”\n\nPick. My. Jaw. Off. The. Floor.\n\nI want to give the seamstress the benefit of the doubt. We all have off days. Maybe she forgot. Maybe she was rushed. Maybe she didn’t actually know how to bustle this dress but she’a a professional seamstress workong with a bridal boutique. Maybe there was a reason she couldn’t do it that hasn’t occurred to me, because I can’t fathom why she recommended this.\n\nI’m not local or available in time so couldn’t do it myself but, predictably, someone from my needle ninja network stepped in within hours to add the bustle hook (thank you again, Tina).\n\nA member of our Facebook group said of she found out the safety pin seamstress was a member, she’d be kicked out.\n\nAnother customer, a tattoo artist, was in awe when I told her about how supportive dressmakers are, and was rightly envious. She told me that her industry was rife with rivalry and bitchiness.\n\nWe are so passionate about what we do and seeing it done well. Keep your safety pins for emergencies, not your bustles.\n\nI love my dressmakers.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nYour dress is a good start.\n\nIt’s finally happened. I’ve had brides arrive for wedding dress fittings without their shoes or underskirt several times but today brought a first: a bride just arrived for her without… her dress.\n\nIt’s absolutely not her fault; she’s storing it at her parents’ house and her dad handed her the wrong grey storage box. We only realised what had happened when we opened it in my fitting room and found an assortment of summer clothing and books.\n\nWhile she runs back to her parents’ house for the correct grey box, I thought I’d put together a list of what you need to have with you to make sure I get your dress fitting perfectly:\n\nYourself. As you are, no worries about whether you’ve gained/lost weight or that your dress won’t fit. That’s why you’re here.\n\nYour dress. Obviously.\n\nYour shoes. Unless you’re absolutely 100% certain you don’t need your dress taking up.\n\nYour underskirt. This can make an inch or more’s difference to the length, especially if it’s hooped. If it has a suck-you-in waistband, it can also change how the bodice fits. They tend to sit Simon-Cowell-waistline high so if you have a sheer bodice and/or an open back, nows also the time to check whether it’ll be on show if we don’t do something about it.\n\nYour undies. Anything that changes your shape or size such as a padded bra, minimiser bra, shapewear, padded knickers (would not be a first) will need to be on you when I pin you in your dress. Just remember to take them with you when we’re done (but it also wouldn’t be a first if you forget).\n\nBelt. Especially if you want it sewn on.\n\nNot essential, but feel free to bring your veil, jewellery, garter, and anything else you’d like to try to see if it works with your dress if you’d like and we’ll have a proper play.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI just posted some pics of a veil I made for a bride, Kira, getting married today in Sydney. Seconds later, I saw she had published a video on Instagram of her (still in her veil and wedding dress) and her husband from an hour previously, STRANDED in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI can’t (and won’t) post Kira’s video because of her privacy settings but it seems that they had switched their accommodation some time ago, but no-one told their driver. By the time they realised they were at the wrong cottage – because it was locked and no-one was around – the driver was gone.\n\nAnd there was no phone reception. The video shows John some distance away down the shiny wet road trying to find a bar of network to call for rescue.\n\n“I’m not happy,” Kira stoicly comments, adding that this isn’t quite the wedding night she had imagined.\n\nIn the time it’s taken me to type, they have posted an update from their actual accommodation, so I’m pleased to report that they have been rescued from the arse-end of the outback. However, despite it being a lukewarm autumn night, they arrived to find the aircon on full blast.\n\nSeeking refuge from the frigid room in a nice hot shower, they’ve discovered only cold water streaming from every tap.\n\nI’m sure they’ll think of something, but what a start to married life! The best is yet to come. Or at least it had bloody better.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDisaster!\n\n“We recently attended a wedding and the bride wore THE DRESS I brought to you a few months ago. I could have screamed!!”\n\nSo began an email from one of my brides whose dress I’m altering later this year. Imagine. You’ve just spent more money than you’ve ever spent on one item of clothing that you’ll probably only wear once, on arguably the most significant day in your life with all eyes on you… and someone has beaten you to it.\n\nI imagine the feeling must be similar to that felt by Captain Scott’s Antarctic party when it finally ended the near 900 mile expedition at the South Pole over a year after setting out, only to find a note from their rival Norwegians informing them they’d beaten them to it by 35 days. But without the prospect of imminent death from hypothermic exposure.\n\nShop closures reduce choice\n\nThe closure of many traditional bridal boutiques – all but one within three miles of me in the last few years – is limiting choice for brides so the chances of buying the same dress as a friend or relative has increased.\n\nBrides usually come to me for bespoke dresses because they have a good idea of what they want but it doesn’t exist in boutiques. A secondary reason is that they want the peace of mind that no-one could possibly have the same dress (or whatever) as them. But I digress.\n\nThis bride is actually the third customer I’ve had in this predicament, although hers was all the more galling because the dress in question was already the third one she’d bought and had to return. The silver lining is that she now has a new dress, completely different, but absolutely stunning, and we’re working on incorporating some of the meaningful details she loved.\n\nEach of my other brides handled the predicament differently. The first asked me to completely restyle the back of her dress, removing most of it and dropping the flare point of her fit-and-flare skirt section (below). That made it sufficiently different from the bride with the same dress, plus there wasn’t a lot of crossover of guests attending each wedding.\n\nThe other bride’s dress doppelganger was closer to home: her new sister-in-law. This meant that a lot of guests – my customer’s entire family – would attend both weddings.\n\nHowever, she decided to wear her dress anyway. You know how people complain that wedding dresses look completely different on the model? My bride reasoned that their different body types, flowers and accessories would make enough of a change that not many people would notice, and she didn’t mind too much if they did.\n\nHow do you think you would feel?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMy lovely friend Alex shared photos of her brother’s wedding last week, featuring the happy couple flanked by male family members clutching bouquets of broccoli.\n\nIt seems to be a growing trend in Asia. Alex’s new sister-in-law YaChun Yang (aka Allie) had seen a YouTuber in her native Hong Kong propose to her boyfriend with broccoli, and there are plenty of examples from Japan too (although I never saw it when I lived there 20-odd years ago).\n\nI’m absolutely here for bouquets for all. They’ve only become associated with women/brides because they were originally composed of fragrant herbs to ward off evil spirits marauding for virgins. And as we know, all brides are virgins, because who in their right mind would marry a woman who wasn’t?\n\nThese days of course, wedding bouquets are more for aesthetics than their proficiency at repelling randy wraiths. Grooms and their parties usually wear flowers in their buttonholes, so it’s no great leap to give them something floral to hold and save them awkwardly twiddling their thumbs in the photos.\n\nIn Japan, where the garter toss has never taken hold, grooms now have their own bouquet to throw.\n\nAnd why broccoli in particular? Some say the way it grows, with many stems branching out from the central stalk symbolises a growing family, and so brings fertility to whoever catches it. But don’t let that put you off; an alternative theory is that the nutrient-rich brassica simply brings good health.\n\nBut it doesn’t have to be broccoli. Ornamental cabbages are fairly common here in the UK and I’ve seen chillis used in bouquets and decor. A cauliflower or brightly coloured vegetable selection could also look elegant.\n\nAnd there’s another benefit to clutching your five-a-day at your wedding: a vegetable bouquet would inflict a weighty blunt-force trauma to any lurking demon, should the bride or groom – both virgins of course – find themselves so accosted. 🥦\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHelping brides whose wedding dresses were being made in Ukraine, AND their Ukranian dressmakers.\n\nWhile Putin’s troops attacked Ukraine this week, two british brides contacted me. Both had ordered wedding dresses that were being made in Ukraine. Now this can no longer happen, they asked if I could make them instead.\n\nI could have rubbed my hands with glee and snapped up the extra orders. But I shouldn’t profit from a loss of business from someone potentially losing everything, just because they happen to have had their country invaded this week, and I haven’t.\n\nSo I *think* I have figured out a way to help both the brides and their original dressmakers in Ukraine. I will make what they had ordered, for the same price. Then, after hard costs (fabric etc), I would donate the rest of the price to the ukranian dressmaker (if it was a small, independent operation like mine) or to the Disasters Emergency Committee (if it was a factory contracted by an international brand).\n\nThe first bride has just agreed and we tracked down her original, ukranian dressmaker on Etsy. Her name is Vera. She leads a small team and, her shop’s announcement tells us, is currently living in an underground shelter with her family.\n\nAs a stroke of genius, Vera created digital, downloadable postcards so people can donate directly. So I did.\n\nI’d been wondering how the hell I could offer practical support in a war zone from the UK, with my skill set limited to making wedding dresses and writing the odd blog. I know what I’m doing* is a drop in the roaring ocean but it’s something. I hope.\n\n💛🇺🇦💙\n\nIf you or someone you know is in the same position as my two brides, please get in touch and I will help if I can.\n\nTo my fellow wedding industry pros, if you’re able to help by doing something similar, let’s work together.\n\n*For what it’s worth, I have also donated to the DEC and encourage those who are willing and able to do the same.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHow Queen Victoria, new-fangled photography and rubbish laundry facilities created the iconic western tradition\n\nEver wondered why western brides wear white? Queen Victoria sparked the trend in 1840 and actually raised eyebrows by choosing white, which was usually only worn by debutantes for their presentation to court.\n\nBefore then (and for a while after), brides would wear their best dress, whatever colour(s) it happened to be. There wasn’t even a concept of a wedding dress as something you wore just for your wedding day. It was expected that you’d wear your wedding dress again for other functions ans indeed, Queen Victoria did.\n\nThis expectation helped make the white wedding dress aspirational as it was only really practical to wash and maintain white fabrics, especially silk, if you were mega-rich. Ideally, you had staff to take care of that for you. European royals and nobility did of course and so the white wedding dress became associated with wealth and high social standing.\n\nSimultaneously, photography was becoming more advanced and accessible and white dresses looked good in the early sepia photographs. Even nearly 200 years ago, we were all about the ‘Gram.\n\nAll of this means that you can still consider yourself a traditional bride if your dress isn’t white. This week, I took delivery of this stunning lace-satin-glitter (yes, all of them, in one fabric) fabric and I am ridiculously excited about it.\n\nSatin, lace AND glitter all in one fabric. BIG plans for this beauty. HUGE.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
