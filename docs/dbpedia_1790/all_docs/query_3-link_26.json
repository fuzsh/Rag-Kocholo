        "text": "I cannot say enough great things about Veil Events, with heavy emphasis on Kaylie! We used Veil Events’ Full Service Planning, and they did not disappoint. I had the pleasure of working with Kaylie for 13 months. We met every month – she was organized and ready to roll each and every time, with open communication in between. As an indecisive bride (to say the least), Kaylie was there to walk me through every aspect of the planning process.. excited with me for all the highs, and supported me when I was so stressed about the silliest of things. Kaylie is capable of the unthinkable.. if you have a vision, she will do anything.. ANYTHING, to make it a reality. I honestly could not have planned the wedding without her. She is so smart, talented, and just a true joy to be around. She made my wedding dreams come true! The day was an absolute breeze knowing Kaylie and her team were there – their emergency kits are no joke! From needing new contact lenses and suit buttons popping off..they were prepared for it all. It really was the best day ever!! I gained a friend in her and would trust her with anything. If I had to do it all again, I’d pick Kaylie and Veil Events every time !!\n\nAs the mother of the bride I knew that when the day came for my daughter to get married we were going to use a wedding planner. We chose Kaylie Rogers at Veil Events and used their full service planning. It was the best decision ever! Kaylie was nothing less than amazing! She went above and beyond from the very beginning to the very end. The week before the wedding people asked how stressed I was. I told them, “Surprisingly I’m really not. I know Kaylie has made sure we have everything covered”. The day before the wedding she was there for setup and rehearsal. She was organized and knew exactly where things were to go and what needed to be done. As a mom the thing I worried about the most was the day of the wedding and not being able to spend much time with my daughter. Kaylie was my saving grace. Kaylie told me that my only duty that day was to spend time with my daughter and enjoy the wedding. She handled everything that day. She wore so many hats and did it all calmly. I even had people tell me how amazing she was at dealing with everything that came at her. I truly got to enjoy the entire wedding day from beginning to the end!! I can’t brag enough on her and the company. Having a planner is worth every dime you spend. My day would of been overwhelming and I would not have got to spend that quality time with my daughter if we would not of had a planner.\n\nKaylie was the one thing that single-handedly made our wedding perfect. She thought of every little detail to make sure we had an opinion on them, asked all the right questions during meetings with the vendors, made me feel absolutely comfortable in any decisions that needed to be made. I leaned in on Kaylie’s professional and personal opinion more than my own. I wish our wedding was almost still in the future so I could spend more time just getting to know her. She’s a phenomenal human with a huge heart and passion for animals, made me and my husband feel so comfortable and she fit right in with all of our wedding party. Do yourself a favor and don’t over think if you need a wedding coordinator or not. You do, and her name is Kaylie. Additionally the owner, helped us out with a huge task I wanted to take on but in the end I didn’t get to it. Just a great group of women that know how to make your day as special as they felt on theirs.\n\nUsing Veil Events was the best money spent on our wedding. We are certain that our day wouldn’t have gone as well as it did without them. From the moment we had our consultation down to the last minute of our wedding day, they were there to help with anything we needed. Kaylie was the best help throughout wedding planning and on our wedding day. She showed up at the very beginning and stayed until the very end – she made our day go so smooth and we know that it wouldn’t have been the same without her. We knew that if there was an issue, Kaylie was going to handle it with no hesitation, making our day stress free. She was always very patient, responsive, adaptive, and FUN. Our day was a dream come true and we truly have Veil Events and Kaylie to thank for that! We love them and could not recommend Veil Events enough!\n\nI’m not quite sure where to begin when it comes to expressing our gratitude for Kaylie of Veil Events. Our wedding day on August 5th, 2023, would not have been the same without her incredible coordination. From the very beginning of our wedding planning journey, Kaylie was there with unwavering joy and support.\n\nKaylie’s attention to detail was impeccable. She thought of every possible detail, some of which hadn’t even crossed our minds. Her organizational skills are unmatched; every “t” was crossed, and every “i” was dotted. But beyond her competence, Kaylie has a remarkable quality that brings calmness in moments of stress.\n\nIn summary, Kaylie’s involvement in our wedding was invaluable. She ensured that our special day went off without a hitch, and her presence alone brought peace to our hearts. We are immensely grateful for her dedication and expertise in making our wedding day truly memorable. Thank you, Kaylie, for being the best coordinator we could have asked for!\n\nI do not even know where to begin with how wonderful Kaylie was not only during planning but on our wedding day! She was absolutely the best! Durning the months of planning she kept me calm and on track. She was very organized and helped me with every single detail. One of the best things about Kaylie during this process is that she was there whenever I needed her and I am forever grateful for that. On our wedding day Kaylie was an absolute BEAST. She made sure everything was happening when it was supposed to, she checked on me throughout the day while going back and forth from the hotel to the venue, she made sure everything was in its place and set up before we got there. Not ONE thing went wrong on our day and it could not have happened without Kaylie and the help of Ellery. It couldn’t have been a more perfect day. Kaylie is definitely meant to be a wedding coordinator. I highly recommend getting a wedding coordinator for your wedding and I cannot recommend Veil Events enough.\n\nI have been trying forever to come up with the right words to do our experience with Veil Events justice! The word I keep coming back to is purposeful. Everything Lindsay and Kaylie did was done with intent and purpose. Before hiring Veil Events, I struggled to keep all of my ideas on track. After starting the Wedding Management package, I immediately felt more focused. While their spreadsheet provided a physical place for me to collect my thoughts, it was the one on one meetings with Lindsay that helped guide and round out my vision. Planning a New Years Eve wedding took incredible attention to detail, and unique adjustments to the timeline that I never would have been able to manage myself. Lindsay has such an innate sense for what you will need not only the day of, but also leading up to the event, and Kaylie was so supportive in making sure everything was organized and went smoothly! It was such a blessing to work with a team who cared about our day as much as we did!\n\n“We purchased the 6-week prep package through Veil Events and worked with Dani & Kaylie in the weeks leading up to our wedding. I cannot stress how much our day would not have been possible without these two amazing women organizing our day, and ensuring everything ran smoothly. Both Dani and Kaylie were kind with my husband and I, as well as our large party and families. They anticipated every possible situation and need. Not only were they incredibly receptive, respectful, and prompt but also easy going, fun to be around, and flexible.\n\nMy only regret with booking Veil events is not doing so sooner in our planning process!! I booked with them about 2 months before our wedding when it should have been the first thing I booked 6-12 months prior to our date. Immediately after booking their services, I was sent a care package with a bridal planning book and extensive google doc for planning and itemization that would have saved months of stress and haphazard planning. Soon after, we had our first Zoom meeting with Dani and Kaylie and clicked right off the bat.\n\nI am very much a “type A” personality, as are many in my family. I was so incredibly stressed about every aspect of the day when it came to planning and was also concerned that my mother and mother-in-law would feel the need to organize and coordinate many of our day of needs instead of enjoying our wedding. Dani & Kaylie put everyone at ease during our wedding day and lifted such an immense weight off of our shoulders. Words cannot express how much I appreciate their professionalism, kindness, and hard work.\n\nMy fiance was not feeling well the weekend of our wedding and lost his voice mid-reception. Kaylie had a little case filled with emergency medication and was so kind to give him some. I was also so nervous the morning of, that I forgot to eat a lot of the food we had delivered to the venue. Kaylie and Dani made sure I was eating and drinking enough water. They helped me manage my monstrous train and helped every member of my part feel special and put together. Dani also took several BTS videos and photos of our day which I will always hold dear, as we did not opt for a videographer but regretted it after the fact. These are just a few of the numerous small, and large acts that made me fall in love with these gals. Dani and Kaylie treated my (now) husband and I with such warmth and kindness, in addition to the rest of our family. We literally could not have coordinated our day had it not been for these two and would recommend them to anyone without a second thought.”\n\n“Shout out and a big thank you to Veil Events for EVERYTHING that they did to make our day just perfect. There was so much that they did to make the day run smoothly and make sure that all of the personal touches we wanted were there. We even noticed the personal touches that they put on the day – like bringing a metal bucket for the poppers for our exit – something we didn’t think of. So many times someone made the comment we need to do x, y, or z, and someone would remind us that Kaylie was on it. And on it she and Jaclyn were. From finding diaper bags and diamonds and cleaning wax off of the groom’s suit, they fixed all the “problems.” I appreciate all the work they did to work with each of our vendors; even when it wasn’t easy, like fighting the good fight to get us some cookie sandwiches. It was a smooth transition from Lindsay to Kaylie when our date changed, and they didn’t miss a beat. We wanted our day to be fun, stress-free, and for everyone to leave feeling loved and cared for. I got a message from a guest that her son had said that his cup was filled from the day and hers was too. They were an integral part of making that happen, and filling our cups that day (literally – thank you Jaclyn – and figuratively). They listened to what was important to us, gave advice, but never pushed their agenda. Thank you, we appreciate it more than you know. While almost all our friends are married (as evidenced by all the children at our wedding), know that Veil Events – Lindsay, Kaylie, and Jaclyn – will always have a referral from us. We are big fans of you all and we are so grateful.”\n\n“Hiring Veil Events was one of the best decisions we made in the wedding process. First off, the wedding planning guide they mail you (and give to you in excel form) is absolutely fantastic and made planning so straight forward. Our planner was Kaylie and there are not enough great words that we can say about her. While we got married in Kansas City, we actually planned our wedding from Virginia where my husband is stationed which meant mostly meeting via Zoom. While this is not ideal for most people, Kaylie made it an enjoyable, stress-free process which made us feel comfortable with the decisions we were making. Her wealth of knowledge about vendors and wedding tips was incredibly useful and helped us to make informed decisions about vendors and decor. If she didn’t know a vendor, she reached out to other members of the Veil Events team to get their opinions and experiences, ensuring that every vendor we went with was top notch. On the day of the wedding, I as the bride, was completely stress free and confident with everything due to Kaylie’s and her assistant Marlyn’s professionalism and calm demeanor. They covered every detail and the fact that Kaylie rolls in with a full-on suitcase full of everything you could possibly need on the wedding day (seriously, she brought the cake knife) just shows how focused on you and your day they are. Also, if you need a hype squad, they will be there for you. I can’t say enough about great they are. Go with them, it will be the best decision you will make in your wedding planning process. Thank you, Veil Events. You made our wedding day perfect!”\n\n“Choosing Veil Events was definitely one of the best decisions we made for our wedding. As soon as I hired Kaylie, she reached out to us and scheduled our first zoom meeting so we could all be on the same page. Throughout the entire planning process, Kaylie was SO friendly and easy to communicate with. The wedding planning guide was extremely helpful throughout wedding planning. I used the checklists often to make sure I wasn’t forgetting anything for our big day. Kaylie did an amazing job at reaching out to all of my vendors and pinpointing arrival times for the wedding day. Our big day was absolutely perfect. As the bride, I was able to relax and enjoy the day. Kaylie and Kendra were so helpful and friendly to all of our friends and families. Brides, book with Veil Events! You will not regret it! I am so thankful for the above and beyond service we received.”\n\n“Kaylie and the entire Veil Events team are another level of amazing! We found Veil Events in a very unconventional way. We had previously hired a different wedding coordinator who my mom had worked with previously and won a discount on her services from a Facebook competition. The first coordinator became pregnant (which we were so excited about!!), but unfortunately her due date was our wedding day and she wanted to make sure we would have a coordinator. Enter Veil Events! They were gracious enough to take on coordinating our wedding AND they honored the discounted price that we were going to pay our previous coordinator! From the moment I met her, Kaylie was phenomenal: so welcoming, so accommodating, listened to my ideas, and eased any concern I had throughout the process. She made the day of our wedding seamless! She did everything she could do to make sure I wasn’t stressed. She’s wonderful in every way! Thank you Kaylie and Veil Events!”\n\n“I knew from day 1 that I wanted Veil Events to be apart of my wedding day because they were apart of my best friends big day. & I saw how they went above AND beyond for her. Paige was there for me throughout my entire engagement and was always ready and willing to help. She even made sure I knew she was one text away if I needed her for absolutely anything- even the stress of the big day approaching. I highly recommend Veil Events – they will make the process smooth, organized and just plain LOVELY. The wedding planning guide was extremely helpful and sets them apart from other coordinators (although they were truly the only coordinator I was even considering). I used it up until my big day as it was an easy guide to refer back to and had everything I needed- from each vendor down to their phone numbers. We chose to add on the end of the night service and I mean to tell you Kaylie was an angel. She knew exactly what needed to be done and was SO helpful. This was an important service to add on and I don’t know how brides go without. I truly could cry writing this – I am forever thankful for these girls and how much they made my day! They are the BEST!“"
