        "text": "So youâ€™ve decided to run away to the mountains, but now you need to decide what to wear when you elope. The best thing about eloping is that there are zero rules or expectations. You are free to be as tame or wild as your heart desires, as long as it makes you and your partner happy! When planning an outdoor adventure, there are a few extra things to consider that you might not have to worry about at the country club; gusty winds, mountain treks, and muddy trails to name a few. Styling for an elopement is very similar to styling for a traditional wedding, just with a few special factors. Youâ€™ll want to make your wedding day choices with the location, weather, and level of adventure you plan on in mind. Remember, this is a day just for you and your love, so be creative, and chose whatever outfit brings you the most joy.\n\nComfort, Style, or Both?\n\nThis is the first thing to ask yourself; how much dress do you want to put up with? Some brides are perfectly okay to wear a huge ball gown on a 8 mile hike, because they want the most glamorous pictures they can have. Other brides would rather hike in a simple satin dress tucked into their leggings, until they get to their photo spot. It is completely up to you, how much you want to deal with.\n\nWhatever style of dress you choose, youâ€™ll want to make sure that the dress allows you to move around. Depending on the material, dresses that are tight on your legs or hips (like trumpet-style or mermaid dresses) could limit movement in your legs, and a long-sleeved dress might limit your arm motion. Try gathering up the skirt, and doing some stretches and lunges. You might look a little crazy in the dress shop, but this will give you an idea of how much mobility youâ€™ll have. Youâ€™ll be very thankful you checked once youâ€™re trying to scramble up a rock to get your perfect shot.\n\nLong trains can be absolutely stunning, cascading down the granite boulders of Yosemite. However, they can be a bit bothersome to roam around in. If this is a style that calls to you, look for dresses with trains that detach (yes, this is a thing!), or can be bustled up easily.\n\nPouf or no pouf? Whatever shape you want, keep in mind that the bigger the dress, the more maneuvering needed in the wild. Think about how you'll scoop it up and walk with it, and how heavy it is. Weâ€™ve had so many brides be surprised at how heavy their dress can get after carrying it around for hours of adventuring!\n\nNo matter what style you pick, make sure the bodice of the dress isnâ€™t so tight that you can't take full and deep breaths. Even if you donâ€™t plan to hike, you still will usually be more active than a traditional wedding.\n\nFabrics\n\nThe fabric of your dress can have a huge impact on your comfort during your experiance. If youâ€™re concerned about having a dress thatâ€™s lightweight and not bulky, fabrics like silk, rayon, chiffon, and even cotton will be your best friends. If youâ€™re planning to not even wear your dress hiking, but change into it later on, youâ€™ll want to look for fabrics that wonâ€™t wrinkle; lace and tulle are great, whereas satin wrinkles if you look at it wrong. Dresses with beaded fabric can be absolutely stunning, but they are usually the heaviest dresses. Tulle and lace tend to gather twigs, leaves, and sometimes small creatures; weâ€™ve had many a beetle or bug live in the layers of a dress throughout a hike. They can also potentially rip along the bottom edges, but luckily the many layers will usually hide any small tears well. Keep in mind that despite the fabric you choose, there is almost a guarantee that your dress will get a little wrinkly, and a little dirty. Youâ€™ll rarely see the dirt along the bottom of your dress in photos, so donâ€™t stress it too much; itâ€™s just part of the adventure!\n\nDress Alternatives\n\nMaybe a dress just isnâ€™t your vibe at all. Clothing is one of the most personal forms of outward expression, and you should choose exactly what brings you the most joy. This is you and your partnerâ€™s day, you write your own rules! We love a bride in a tailored suit, jumpsuit, or anything else you can dream up. Pantsuits can look extremely chic, while allowing for a lot of movement and comfort during the day. You could also opt for a two piece skirt and top, which can let you play around with mixed textures and color, while also giving you lots of movement. Your skirt can be packed away in your backpack, while you adventure in your favorite hiking pants. Just remember that itâ€™s your wedding day, so choose the outfit that feels most authentically you.\n\nVeil or no Veil?\n\nVeils can be stunning auditions to your wedding attire, and you can absolutely make them work if you choose. The contrast of wilderness and a beautiful veil is simply incredible. Just like with the dress, try on different veil styles and lengths to see what youâ€™ll be most comfortable in. The longer the veil, the more work youâ€™ll have to keep it from tangling in branches and staying in your hair, but the drama it adds to photos can make it all worth it. A mid-length veil is easier to keep clean and snag free, but it is also more prone to blowing in your face on a windy day. A veil with lots of tulle layers can sometime be scratchy to hold, and will become a home to lots of little critters and twigs; they are also beautiful to see billowing through the breeze against the backdrop of Taft Point. A lace veil can be easier to manage than tulle, and less likely to gather visitors, but are more delicate overall. Just keep in mind your location and plans once you find a veil youâ€™re obsessed with.\n\nThere are SO many fun fabrics and decorations for veils, that you can really let your personality come out here. From bright colors to soft laces, appliques, and beadwork, your veil is a great way to express yourself, especially if you go with a more traditional dress. No matter what veil you choose, make sure you find a veil that matches the color of your elopement dress if you're wearing white or cream. If they unintentionally mismatch, it can be very obvious in photos.\n\nFlower crowns are a beautiful way to bring some nature into your look. They are a great way to still have florals even if you donâ€™t want to hold your bouquet all the time, or donâ€™t want one altogether. Try to pick flowers local to where you will be eloping, as it's more environmentally friendly. Not only will it coordinate with your wild backdrop better, but it is actually preferred by most parks. Using hardy flowers and greenery ensures seeds do not fall and germinate, spreading invasive species; for example Babyâ€™s Breath is prohibited by many national parks, including Yosemite, as it is a germinating machine. For the most eco-friendly way of incorporating a flower crown, you can opt for a sola wood crown! Not only does it eliminate the worry of spreading invasive seeds, but it will also last you forever as memento of your magical day. There are many sola wood florists on Etsy, who can craft you the crown of your dreams!\n\nVeils or flower crowns not your thing? Try a headband instead! They can add a lot to your hairstyle, and complete a look while being lightweight, and easy to deal with. They are probably the most hiker-friendly accessory, and easy to stow away in a bag if you want; just make sure you get one that is comfy, and doesnâ€™t leave you with a mid-day headache. They can range from very simple and modern, to ornate crown or tiara styles, so there is a huge variety to fit your tastes.\n\nHats are another hair accessory you could chose, that are relatively easy to explore in. Whether you choose a vintage pillbox, or a more modern style, they can also serve to keep some of the sun off your face during the day, which is always a great thing while hiking. Just make sure the hat you choose doesnâ€™t have a significant brim, as it can cast shadows on your face in photos.\n\nBridal outerwear\n\nYou probably chose to elope in the National Parks because you love the beautiful backdrops of wild nature. With nature comes weather, and that can change drastically throughout the day. If itâ€™s the rainstorms of Olympic National Park, or the heavy winds of Joshua Tree, youâ€™ll want to be prepared for whatever may come your way. This is a perfect opportunity to add some extra style to your ensemble! Since youâ€™ll be in the often unpredictable outdoors, we always recommend bringing a jacket, or something to keep dry and warm with. You can definitely reach for your regular Patagonia puffer, but what about choosing something as a part of your outfit? Jackets and outerwear can add to the aesthetic of your elopement photos in a really great way, and show your personality.\n\nIf youâ€™re not worried too much about warmth while hiking, a colorful shawl or even a blanket to drape over your shoulders can add a pop of color and pattern. Pendelton blankets are awesome for this purpose, and fit right in with the National Parks. There are even park specific Pendletons, which would be an incredible wedding heirloom.\n\nFor the colder climates, try to choose something you can have as a part of your pictures, not just utilitarian. A faux fur stole, leather jacket, or a wool coat all make stylish additions to your outfit. The more looks you have, the more variety of shots you can achieve during your photography session. Just make sure to coordinate with your partner, so you both have a cohesive look.\n\nAdventure worthy Shoes\n\nBrides often ask what shoes they should wear for their adventure elopement. The best shoe to wear is one you can walk in, and feel comfortable in. Weâ€™ve had brides wear heels all day, and blow us away with their rock climbing skills. Weâ€™ve also had brides wear custom wedding Converse, for maximum comfort and personality. You know your feet better than anyone else, so choose what will allow you to enjoy your day the most.\n\nHiking boots are the most supportive shoe for this kind of experiance, and they can be worn all day, or changed out of for your photos. If youâ€™re planning on a longer hike during the day, or an area with rough/slippery terrain then theyâ€™ll probably be your best choice. Just make sure that you break them in before your big day! REI has an excellent try and return program, so go on a few nature walks or hikes with your new boots, to keep your elopement day from being blister filled.\n\nTennis shoes are a comfy choice, if those are what you're used to wearing for activities. There are a lot of cute options, like Keds, Converse, and even Adidas, that offer customization. These can make for a super unique and special shoe choice that still gives you support for your trek up the trail.\n\nIf your dream wedding shoe is a heel, try to find a heel you can at least stand on uneven terrain with. Even if you donâ€™t plan on hiking at all, youâ€™re still out in a natural environment, and will encounter some rough areas of walking. Do keep in mind, shoes often canâ€™t be seen in many wedding photos, especially if your dress is to the floor. So weigh the pros and cons of your heel choice carefully; no one wants to end their big day with a sprained ankle!"
