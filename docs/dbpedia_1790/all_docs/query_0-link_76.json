Also, the ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes (SEN) have for many years contained highlights of items from online RISKS, along with one-liners of additional items of note.

In this collection of mostly one-liner summaries, (R i j) denotes RISKS volume i issue j; (S vol no:page) denotes an issue of SEN, where there has been one volume per year, with vol 33 being the year 2008; page numbers are given fairly regularly from 1993 on; (SAC vol no) indicates an item in the quarterly SIGSAC Security and Control Review, where vol 16 is 1998, which was the final volume. The RISKS-relevant SEN material prior to 1995 is summarized in my Computer-Related Risks book (see below). SEN material is now being brought on-line by Will Tracz: http://www.acm.org/sigsoft\n\nSome incidents are well documented, while others need further study.

Archives are available at http://www.risks.org, which redirects to Lindsay Marshall's Web site at Newcastle http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/, including a nice search facility. Specific issues can be read directly as http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/I.J.html [where I=volume#, J=issue#]. SRI's archive is at ftp://ftp.sri.com/risks or by \"ftp ftp.sri.com\", \"login anonymous\", \"cd risks\" (which gets the \"dir\" for the current volume, and \"cd i\" then gets you into the subdirectory for noncurrent volume i). An Australian mirror is at http://the.wiretapped.net/security/textfiles/risks-digest/. \"Inside Risks\" distills some of the discussion into a monthly inside-back-cover column in the Communications of the ACM. The list of columns to date is given at the end of this document.\n\nMy book (Peter G. Neumann, Computer-Related Risks, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0-201-55805-X) and ACM Press (ACM Order 704943), 1995) summarizes many of these cases and provides additional analysis. (A few errata for the first three printings are on my Web page, noted above.) Most of the (S vol no) items listed below for no < 20 are discussed in the book; more recent items generally include the relevant on-line (R i j) references. If you cannot find the book in a bookstore, it is on amazon.com, or call A-W within the U.S. at 1-800-822-6339 - or if you are outside of the U.S., 1-617-944-3770 and ask for International Orders. The book is now also available in Japanese (ISBN 4-89471-141-9). Instead of trying to produce a second edition in the face of a massive influx of new RISKS cases, the fourth and fifth printings of the book gives the URL for the Addison-Wesley Web site (http:www.awl.com/cseng/titles/ISBN-0-201-55805-X/), which includes the first chapter of the book and an extended preface. That Web site and my own contain further material that would otherwise have gone into the second edition.\n\nHenry Petroski (among others) has noted that we rarely learn from our successes, and must learn more from our failures. The collection of cases cited here provides rich opportunities for reflection that could help us to avoid similar problems in the future. Unfortunately, it also demonstrates that the same types of mistakes tend to recur, over and over...\n\nSEN and RISKS also consider approaches for developing better computer systems, e.g., safer, more reliable, more secure, fewer cost and schedule overruns, etc. There are many approaches to developing sound systems; none is guaranteed. Whereas the emphasis in the following list is on problems rather than on would-be solutions, the pervasive nature of the problems suggests that techniques for the effective development and operation of computer-related systems are frequently ignored. Worse yet, even ideal systems can result in serious risks, through unanticipated technological problems or human foibles. We include here primarily cases that have been publically reported, although we know of various additional cases whose existence for one reason or another has not seen the light of day. A few successes are also included, although the failures seem to predominate. We are always interested in hearing more about successes. Although I receive occasional complaints about the preponderance of failures in RISKS, there appear to be very few real successes. Perhaps not enough folks are heeding some of the advice that you can gather from RISKS and that are distilled in Computer-Related Risks.\n\nDescriptor Symbols\n\nThe following descriptor symbols characterize each entry.\n\n! = Loss of life/lives; * = Potentially life-critical or safety problem\n\nV = Overall system or subsystem surViVability problems (with respect to diVerse adVersities, including attacks and malfunctions).
