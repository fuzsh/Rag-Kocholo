        "text": "James H. Wojahn Sr. passed away on April 10, 2018 with his family by his side, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\n\nJames (Jim) was born on January 22, 1933 to the late Pauline and Henry Wojahn. He spent many years working for Wisconsin Bell, which became Ameritech and now part of AT &T, until his retirement. Jim enjoyed spending time at the “cottage” with family and friends. He had a love for animals like no other and always made sure the squirrels and birds would not go hungry. Jim will be deeply missed by all whose lives he touched.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Diane (Bloechl) Wojahn, who would have been married 66 years on May 3, 2018. He is also survived by his children, Linda Leichtfuss (Todd) Moon, Oshkosh, James (Doris) Wojahn Jr., Oshkosh, Penny (Mark) Robinson, Knowlton, WI, Weston Wojahn (Jessie), Oshkosh; grandchildren, Marty (Jenny) Wojahn, Oshkosh, Tyler (Stephanie) Robinson, Kronenwetter, WI, Katy Leichtfuss (fiancé Kevin Schmick) Oshkosh, Sarah Wojahn, Oshkosh, Shaylyn (David) Lamie, San Diego, CA; great grandchildren, Maree Rose Robinson, Merritt Justin Robinson, and James River Wojahn.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Henry (whose birthday was April 10) and Pauline Wojahn; and sister, Joyce Wojahn.\n\nFuneral service will be at 11:00am on Saturday, April 14, 2018 at Konrad-Behlman Funeral Home- Westside, 100 Lake Pointe Dr., Oshkosh. Pastor Greg Koepsell (Good Shephard Lutheran Church-Oshkosh) will officiate. Visitation will begin at 10:00am and continue until the time of the service.\n\nThe Wojahn family would like to thank all of those who provided comfort, prayers, and support."
