        "text": "Local 21 Ratifies Agreement\n\nWith SBC/Ameritech\n\nAugust 15, 2001\n\nMembers of Chicago's Local 21 have overwhelmingly ratified an agreement with the Ameritech division of SBC. Ninety-two percent of the members voted in favor of the agreement.\n\nThe four-year contract covers 12,000 workers in the largest IBEW communications local in North America. It provides for a 4.25 percent wage increase this year, 3 percent next year and 5 percent in 2003. The agreement also increases pension bands, and includes better health insurance and more fringe benefits.\n\n\"The solidarity and determination of Local 21 members was the key to bringing home this highly progressive agreement,\" said Local 21 Business Manager Ronald E. Kastner. \"While IBEW members stand at the cutting edge of the ever-changing telecommunications industry, they will also stand as forerunners of today's industry standard for wages, benefits and working conditions.\"\n\n\"The improvements negotiated in this agreement are a perfect example of why America's working families need to belong to unions,\" said Local 21 Business Representative Thomas Hopper.\n\nAmeritech is a subsidiary of the international communications company SBC. Ameritech's IBEW members perform inside and outside installation as well as acting as technicians, sales representatives and marketing specialists."
