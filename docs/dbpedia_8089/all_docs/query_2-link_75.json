        "text": "Ameritech Announces Details On First Phase Of High-Speed DSL Internet Service Rollout In Wisconsin\n\nAggressive Deployment Brings Service to 580,000 Wisconsin Homes and Businesses This Year\n\n, , February 23, 2000\n\nMILWAUKEE, Feb. 23, 2000 - Ameritech today released details on the first phase of its deployment of high-speed Internet access service in Ohio through the company's Project Pronto initiative. With network enhancements already underway, Ameritech expects to make its Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service available to 1.2 million homes and businesses throughout the state by the end of this year, including cities, towns and communities.\n\nIn Ohio, Ameritech's DSL service* will be available in several neighborhoods throughout Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Akron, Canton, Toledo and Youngstown In all, Ameritech expects to launch service in more than 70 Ohio cities this year. As part of its announcement today, Ameritech issued initial deployment maps for some markets.\n\nWith Ameritech's DSL service Ohioans will have access to always-on Internet connections that will offer high-speed access, making the computer a true information appliance.\n\nDSL service enables customers to access the Internet or corporate networks at speeds up to 200 times faster than standard analog modems. DSL enables customers to instantly connect to the Internet without the hassle of busy signals or waiting for the modem to dial-up. Each DSL customer will receive a dedicated connection to their central office with guaranteed minimum connection speeds.\n\n\"There is tremendous demand among consumers, telecommuters and small businesses for high-speed Internet access, and Ameritech Corporation is moving quickly to meet this demand by making DSL service available to many Ohio customers this year,\" said Jacqueline F. Woods, president, Ameritech Ohio. \"We're transforming the Ameritech phone line running into homes and businesses from a narrow two-lane road into a wide, super-fast Internet highway for our customers.\"\n\nUnder the initial deployment, in most markets the length of the phone line running from customers' homes to a DSL-equipped central office must be approximately 3 miles or less, and must meet certain transmission criteria. But through the $6 billion Project Pronto initiative Ameritech and other SBC Communications Inc. companies will virtually eliminate these distance limitations over the next three years. Ameritech will push fiber deeper into neighborhoods and install or upgrade \"neighborhood broadband gateways\" containing next-generation digital loop carriers to push the capabilities now housed in central offices closer to customers. The redesign of the local network will enable Ameritech to provide nearly all customers in targeted markets with DSL service, and at dramatically faster speeds.\n\nAmeritech will make a second announcement later in the year when customers in these initial deployment areas are able to order the service.\n\nProject Pronto is transforming SBC into America's largest single broadband provider, and creating a platform to introduce a host of next-generation, broadband-powered services. Project Pronto will make SBC's DSL service available to an estimated 77 million Americans - 80 percent of SBC's customers - over the next three years, and is the first of many initiatives SBC will undertake to secure for customers and shareholders the benefits of its merger with Ameritech.\n\nProject Pronto will create a platform to deliver next-generation voice, data and video services over a single network. With the DSL speeds Ameritech offers, users can quickly download large files or video feeds from the Internet or corporate networks, send and receive video messages, and even videoconference. Small businesses can easily and affordably become e-businesses, giving them new ways to reach customers and increase sales. For schools and libraries, readily available DSL service offers an affordable, high-speed service that can help bridge the \"Digital Divide.\"\n\n\"We're transforming our network in Illinois to give customers the most advanced broadband network in the industry,\" said Wright. \"Project Pronto, combined with our plans tooffer long-distance service, will enhance Ameritech's position as the leading full-service provider of communications services in Illinois.\"\n\n* Ameritech's DSL service is provided by Ameritech Corp.'s wholly owned data subsidiary, Ameritech Advanced Data Services."
