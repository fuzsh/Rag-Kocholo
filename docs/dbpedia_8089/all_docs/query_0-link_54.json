        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - SBC Communications Inc., parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone, has agreed to buy Ameritech Corp. for about $61 billion in the second-largest merger ever, creating the nation's largest local phone company, with service reaching from Detroit to Los Angeles.\n\nIn what would be the biggest merger in the telecommunications industry, SBC will add another of the seven Baby Bell telephone companies created in the 1984 breakup of AT&T to the two it already owns.\n\nThe merger is not expected to have any direct effect on Southwestern Bell's local service in Oklahoma or the company's employment in this state. The merger also is not expected to affect Southwestern Bell's efforts to win approvals or rulings needed for the company to start offering full long-distance service to Oklahoma customers.\n\nAnalysts said the merger deal, which SBC and Ameritech jointly announced Monday, is likely to elicit opposition from some regulators and consumer groups.\n\nOklahoma Corporation Commission Vice Chairman Bob Anthony said Monday, \"The federal Telecommunications Act (of 1996) anticipated that telephone companies would engage in competition\" that would focus on providing benefits and choices to phone users. \"Unfortunately, the trend among many different types of telephone companies is toward mergers.\"\n\nThe SBC/Ameritech merger would eclipse the $37 billion that WorldCom Inc. agreed to pay for MCI Communications Corp., and would rank second among overall mergers, behind the $73 billion Travelers Corp. is paying for Citicorp.\n\nWith the merger, SBC would add Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin to the two regions where it already provides local telephone service.\n\nWhen it was created as Southwestern Bell, its local exchange phone service territory covered parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas. A year ago, the company bought Pacific Telesis, adding markets across California and Nevada to its local service area.\n\nTogether with last year's merger of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, the latest deal would reduce the seven original Baby Bells to four.\n\nThe deal also marks the second acquisition this year for SBC. It agreed to buy Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. for $4.4 billion in January.\n\nIn a teleconference with reporters, SBC Chairman Ed Whitacre said he was not putting the Bell telephone monopoly back together.\n\n\"The Bell system had national monopoly. This merger talks about 12 states, not 50 states,\" Whitacre said.\n\nSBC and Ameritech said the deal will result in significant opportunities for revenue growth, technology development and other benefits. No job cuts are expected.\n\nWhitacre said the merger would reduce SBC's earnings per share for the next few years, but that the companies believed the combination could have about $1 billion in unspecified \"synergies.\"\n\nThe combined company, to be called SBC, will serve customers in the top 50 U.S. markets. The companies will divest certain cellular properties to comply with federal law prohibiting ownership of overlapping licenses.\n\n\"Our industry is rapidly changing.\" Whitacre said. \"Over the next few years, we'll see the emergence of a limited number of integrated national and international operators. SBC intends to be one of the successful global operators.\"\n\nThe companies expect the deal to close within one year, but analysts expect that target may be optimistic as the consolidation of the Baby Bells will likely raise opposition from regulators and consumers.\n\nWall Street reacted cautiously to the deal. SBC shares fell $2.626 to $39.75 and Ameritech gained $3.25 to $47.125, both in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.\n\nStaff writer Bob Vandewater contributed to this story.
