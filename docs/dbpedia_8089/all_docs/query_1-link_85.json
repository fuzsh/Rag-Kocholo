        "text": "A once-nationwide phone strike inched closer to a conclusion Monday as strike by telephone workers in four East Coast states and the nation's capital was called off, and a tentative agreement was announced in Illinois.\n\nThe agreement between the Communications Workers of America and Illinois Bell made Illinois Bell the fourth out of six units of Ameritech to settle their differences. Ameritech is one of the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies hit by a nationwide strike Aug. 6.\n\nAnd at NYNEX, the 'Baby Bell' company representing New York and most of New England, talks were to resume this week.\n\nCWA officials said Monday they had told striking Bell Atlantic telephone workers in NewJersey, Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia to return to work. 'The strike is over,' CWA spokeswoman Gaye Williams Mack said in Washington.\n\nMack said workers at Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. in the nation's capital and three states would start returning to work on their usual shifts immediately, which in some cases could be midnight Monday.\n\nBell Atlantic and the CWA reached tentative agreement Aug. 17 on major economic issues in the strike that began began Aug. 6. The three-year pact includes a 3 percent wage increase the first year and 2.25 percent in each of the last two years. The company also has agreed to cost-of-living adjustments, a profit sharing plan and a new health care plan.\n\nBut the union's 41,000 workers remained off the job pending settlement of local issues in bargaining with state subsidiaries.\n\nTentative agreements on local issues at C&P and Bell New Jersey also were announced last week.\n\nTalks were scheduled to resume Tuesday between Bell New Jersey and a second union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which last week rejected the company's 'final' offer.\n\nClara Allen, CWA spokeswoman for New Jersey Bell, asked if workers would return to work despite the continuing IBEW strike, said, 'It's our policy to respect bona fide picket lines.' She said she did not know if the IBEW would set up picket lines at all facilities where CWA members work.\n\nSettlements also were reached Monday between the CWA and local telephone companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware.\n\n'We do expect a majority of the people will be on their jobs (Tuesday) morning,' said Robert Williams, spokeswoman for Diamond State Telephone Co. of Delaware. The company's 864 striking workers were the last of the Atlantic Bell Companies to reach a tentative agreement.\n\nIn the Midwest, meanwhile, Illinois Bell spokeswoman Pat Montgomery said in Chicago that details of the agreement with the CWA would be withheld until all employees could be notified. The agreement follows weekend agreements at Ameritech subsidiaries in Wisconsin and Ohio.\n\nSome forward movement was reported at Ameritech companies in Michigan and Indiana. Steve Ford, a spokesman for Ameritech, said earlier Monday there had been progress in talks at Indiana Bell and Michigan Bell.\n\nFord said settlements were possible Monday, 'but again, while close, it could take some time to have the final issues resolved. It's fair to say both sides have shown some flexibility.'\n\nTentative agreements were announced Saturday at Ohio Bell and Sunday at Wisconsin Bell, both Ameritech subsidiaries. Ameritech Services, another subsidiary, also announced a tentative agreement. Details of the agreements were not released.\n\nThe CWA represents 10,100 at Ohio Bell, 4,200 at Wisconsin Bell, 580 at Ameritech Services, and about 20,000 at the companies in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois. Unlike the other 'Baby Bell' companies, Ameritech has refused to negotiate a region-wide contract.\n\n'We made it very clear from Day 1, as far as we were concerned, if we went out, our people would stay out until all the companies settled,' CWA spokesman Steve Rosenthal said. 'We do not want anyone to be left hanging.'\n\nThe walkout by Ameritech's 35,000 CWA members began Aug. 12, and has slowed some operator services and repair and installation work but, due to automation, has had little effect on most phone service.\n\nNYNEX, with 60,000 workers off the job since Aug. 6, provides telephone service to 10.5 million customers in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine and two towns in Connecticut.\n\nFour other 'Baby Bells' across the nation, Pacific Telesis, BellSouth, US West and Southwestern Bell, settled with their employees earlier in the month."
