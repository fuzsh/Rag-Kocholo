        "text": "Bell System Description Industry: Technology Type: Telecommunications Years Active: 1877-1984 Defunct Reason: Company Breakup, name dissolved\n\nBell System is a former Telecommunications brand.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Bell System was founded with opening of a telephone exchange office in 1877. These offices quickly expanded, with more of them opening throughout the country. This prompted the Bell Company to create a new subsidiary to control and own all of these offices in 1885. With said company being known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, or AT&T for short.[1][2] In 1899, the Bell System made the decision to reverse the order of it's companies, making AT&T the new parent company, and Bell the subsidiary.[3]\n\nBreakup[]\n\nWhile The Bell System was the first telecommunications provider,[4] Other companies began to enter the field and take market share starting in the 1960's and 1970's. Bell owned and operated most of the other other smaller, local, phone companies, owning over 85% of the telecommunications market.[5][6] The government considered this to be a monopoly, and took AT&T/Bell System to court in 1974. The trail lasted 8 years before ending in 1982, with the courts ruling against AT&T.[7][8][9] The government ordered a breakup of the Bell System, which wouldn't take place until two years later.[10]\n\nThe 'Baby Bells'[]\n\nThe breakup of the Bell System finally happened in 1984, which caused the main company to be split into seven separate, smaller, and unrelated, companies, all of which serving their own respective region of the United States. The 7 new companies would be known as 'Regional Bell Operating Companies' (RBOCs) or the 'Baby Bells.'[11] Said new companies would be; Pacific Telesis, who operated in the states of California and Nevada; US West, who operated in most of the Western area of the United States; Ameritech, who operated in the East North Central region of the United States, BellSouth, who operated in the South; Southwestern Bell, who operated in the Southwest; Bell Atlantic, who operated in some Mid Atlantic and Southeastern states; and Nynex, who operated in New York as well as all of the New England states.[12][13] Despite the breakup, all 7 Baby Bell companies owned even smaller 'operator companies' also under the Bell name (Nevada Bell by Pacific Telesis would be one example), with there being a grand total of over 20 operating companies, all of which using the same Bell name.[14]\n\nThe Bell Companies Today[]\n\nAlmost all of the Baby Bell companies, as well as the smaller operating companies, are now defunct. Most of them were dissolved after eventually being acquired SBC Communications, which acquired, as rebranded as, AT&T, who dissolved it and all related brands. There are four Bell companies left, though only one of them currently operate under the Bell name. The first one is the original Bell company, which currently operates as AT&T. The second one is Verizon, which was created as a merger between Bell Atlantic & GTE. The third one is Altafiber, which was previously Cincinnati Bell (an operator company which AT&T never fully owned) until a name change 2016. They also used the original Bell System logo until 2008.[15] The last Bell company to still exist is Bell Canada, which was the Bell System's Canadian division until it was split off from the main company in 1975.[16]\n\nDefunct AT&T Brands / The Bell System\n\nA2B Music | Aio Wireless | AT&T Broadband | AT&T Digital Cable | AT&T Phone Center | Audience Network | Cingular Wireless | TCI | Vanguard Cellular Systems\n\nBell System\n\nBell System\n\nBell Phone Center Store | Western Electric\n\nRegional Bell Operating Companies / 'Baby Bells'\n\nAmeritech1 | Bell Atlantic | BellSouth | Nynex1 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | US West\n\nAmeritech\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Illinois Bell | Indiana Bell | Michigan Bell | Ohio Bell | Wisconsin Bell\n\nBell Atlantic\n\nBell Atlantic | Bell Of Pennsylvania | Diamond State Telephone | GTE | New Jersey Bell | Nynex1 | Tele-TV2 | The C&P Telephone Company | The C&P Telephone Company Of Maryland | The C&P Telephone Company Of Virginia | The C&P Telephone Company Of West Virginia\n\nBellSouth\n\nAmericast2 | BellSouth | Cingular Wireless2 | South Central Bell | Southern Bell\n\nNynex\n\nIBM Product Center | New England Telephone | New York Telephone | Nynex1 | NYNEX Business Centers | NYNEX CableComms | Tele-TV2\n\nPacific Telesis\n\nPacific Telesis1 | PacTel Cable UK | PacTel Cellular | Pacific Bell | Pacific Bell Digital TV | Nevada Bell | Tele-TV2\n\nSBC Communications\n\nAmericast2 | Ameritech1 | Cingular Wireless2 | Pacific Telesis1 | SBC Communications | SNET | Prodigy (Internet Service)\n\nUS West\n\nContinental Cablevision | MediaOne | Mountain Bell | Northwestern Bell | Pacific Northwest Bell | US West\n\n1Baby Bell company which was acquired by another Baby Bell company\n\n2Joint Venture"
