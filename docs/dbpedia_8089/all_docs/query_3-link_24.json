        "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nSTIPULATION OF CONSENT TO PROPOSED ORDER\n\nThe United States has filed a motion, under section VII of the decree, for entry of the attached proposed order to permit a trial, supervised by the Department of Justice and the Court, in which Ameritech could provide interexchange service for a limited geographic area, with appropriate safeguards, when competitive local exchange services become available.\n\nPursuant to Section VII of the Decree, the United States, Ameritech Corporation and AT&T Corp. hereby stipulate that the attached proposed order is in the public interest and they consent to its entry by the Court on that basis, in the form attached hereto, at any time after the filing of the United States' Memorandum and the responses and replies of other parties and interested persons.\n\nFOR THE UNITED STATES:\n\n______________________________\n\nANNE K. BINGAMAN\n\nAssistant Attorney General\n\nAntitrust Division\n\nUnited States Department of Justice\n\nFOR AMERITECH CORPORATION:\n\n______________________________\n\nTHOMAS P. HESTER\n\nExecutive Vice President and General Counsel\n\nAmeritech Corporation\n\nFOR AT&T CORPORATION:\n\n______________________________\n\nMARK C. ROSENBLUM\n\nVice-President - Law\n\nAT&T Corporation\n\nDATED: April 3, 1995\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nO R D E R\n\nUpon consideration of the motion of the United States, pursuant to Section VII of the Modification of Final Judgment, to permit a trial, supervised by the Department of Justice and the Court, in which Ameritech could provide interexchange service for customers within a limited geographic area, with appropriate safeguards, when competitive local exchange services become available, and upon consideration of the responses of other interested parties; and the Court being otherwise fully advised in the premises;\n\nIT IS, this ______ day of ____________, 199__, ORDERED as follows:\n\nDefinitions\n\n1. As used in this Order, all terms defined in the Modification of Final Judgment entered August 24, 1982 (hereinafter \"decree\" or \"MFJ\") shall have the same meanings as interpreted by the courts unless otherwise redefined herein. Provided, however, for purposes of this Order, the following terms shall be defined as indicated:\n\n\"Ameritech interexchange subsidiary\" means the separate subsidiary of Ameritech that is authorized to offer interexchange telecommunications and other services pursuant to this Order.\n\n\"Ameritech local exchange operations\" means the parts or units of Ameritech's business that are regulated as a local exchange carrier (\"LEC\") by the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") and the applicable state regulatory authorities in their provision of local exchange telecommunications and exchange access service except that for the purposes of this Order, the term \"Ameritech local exchange operations\" excludes the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary and other portions of Ameritech to the extent that they are operating as an Exchange Carrier or are providing telecommunications other than local exchange telecommunications and exchange access services. The term \"local exchange carrier\" (\"LEC\") is as defined by the FCC and the applicable state regulatory authority(s) in the Trial Territory.\n\n\"Dialing parity\" with respect to interexchange or intraLATA toll telecommunications means that subscribers may select any available interexchange or intraLATA toll carrier, including Ameritech, to receive interexchange and/or intraLATA toll telecommunications traffic that is direct dialed (without an access or other code) from their local exchange telecommunications service. \"Dialing parity\" with respect to local exchange telecommunications means the ability of subscribers of other Exchange Carriers or exchange access service providers to reach subscribers of Ameritech's local exchange operations or Ameritech's interexchange subsidiary by dialing the same number of digits (without an access or other code) as an Ameritech subscriber at that location would have to dial to reach the same called party.\n\n\"Exchange access\" shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Decree, except that in addition, for purposes of this Order, the term includes comparable exchange access provided to the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary, or provided to other intraLATA toll carriers, for the purposes of originating and terminating intraLATA toll telecommunications.\n\n\"Exchange Carrier\" means a carrier, including a cable or video dialtone system, that provides, and is authorized by the appropriate state regulatory authority to offer, local exchange telecommunications as an alternative to those offered by a LEC.\n\n\"Interexchange carrier\" means a carrier that provides interexchange telecommunications. For purposes of this Order, an interexchange carrier may also provide other telecommunications.\n\n\"Interexchange telecommunications\" and \"InterLATA telecommunications\" means interexchange telecommunications as defined in the MFJ. Such interexchange telecommunications shall not include exchange access.\n\n\"IntraLATA toll telecommunications\" means telecommunications between points located within the same LATA, but for purposes of this Order excludes local exchange telecommunications and exchange access service.\n\n\"Interim number portability\" means one or more mechanisms whereby a local exchange telecommunications subscriber at a particular location may change its local exchange telecommunications service at that same location from one carrier to another without a change in the local exchange subscriber's telephone number.\n\n\"LATA\" means \"exchange area\" as defined in the MFJ.\n\n\"Local calling\" is as defined in the statutes, regulations, rules, orders, and tariffs in each state and through custom and usage in that state, but generally includes intraLATA telecommunications within the subscriber's local calling area, or other zone(s) that surround the end office serving the subscriber, and excludes intraLATA toll telecommunications.\n\n\"Local exchange telecommunications\" means basic telecommunications subject to the regulation of the states, as specified by the Communications Act of 1934 as \"telephone exchange services,\" and as defined in the statutes, rules, orders, and tariffs in each state and through custom and usage in that state. For purposes of this Order, the term shall include Centrex services offered within a LATA.\n\n\"Loop\" is the transmission facility between the network interface on a subscriber's premises and the main distribution frame in the serving central office. This definition is without prejudice to the power of a state to require further unbundling of that facility or of the Department to consider the competitive effects of such unbundling.\n\n\"Port\" for purposes of this Order comprises the entirety of local exchange telecommunications with the exception of the loop and, by way of example, includes dial tone, a telephone number, local switching, local calling (if applicable) directory assistance, a white pages listing, operator services, and access to interexchange and intraLATA toll carriers. This definition is without prejudice to the power of the state to require further unbundling of those functions or facilities, or to use a different definition of a port for its own regulatory purposes not connected with this Order.\n\n\"Trial Territory\" means the exchanges within the limited geographic area described in Exhibit A that are either (i) Ameritech exchanges or (ii) other Local Exchange Carriers' exchanges in which, because dialing parity for intraLATA toll service has been implemented or for other reasons, Ameritech does not automatically receive interexchange or intraLATA toll traffic for which no access code has been dialed.\n\n\"Transport\" means facilities that carry telecommunications traffic from one point to another point on a carrier's network and includes the functions offered as transport in the duly published FCC exchange access service tariffs of the Ameritech local exchange operations.\n\n\"True number portability\" means the capability for local exchange telecommunications subscribers at a particular location to change their local exchange telecommunications service from one provider to another at that same location without a change in the subscribers' telephone number, while preserving the full range of functionality that the subscribers could have obtained had they not changed their providers, and allowing carriers that so choose to deliver traffic directly to that provider without first having to route traffic to Ameritech or otherwise use Ameritech's transmission or switching facilities to complete the call. The facilities for providing such capability may be owned and/or operated by Ameritech for purposes of this trial, but Ameritech shall continue to explore other alternatives, including having those functions performed by a neutral third party.\n\n\"Unbundling\" means the offering of a specified telecommunications service, facility, or component on a stand-alone basis, without requiring the user to subscribe to other telecommunications services.\n\nGrant of Waiver Authority\n\n2. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech may commence to provide interexchange telecommunications, subject to the provisions and limitations of this Order.\n\n3. ORDERED FURTHER, that nothing in this Order shall preempt the jurisdiction of the FCC and the applicable state regulatory authorities or their successors in the Trial Territory and that Ameritech's authority to provide interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order, and to provide intraLATA toll, exchange access, and local exchange telecommunications, are subject to the applicable regulations of the FCC and the applicable state telecommunications regulatory authorities or their successors in the Trial Territory.\n\n4. For the purposes of this Order, terms such as \"may commence to provide interexchange telecommunications\" and \"authority to provide interexchange telecommunications\" shall be understood to mean only the temporary and limited waiver of the line of business restriction of Section II(D)(1) of the Decree and only to the extent specified in this Order.\n\nScope of Waiver Authority\n\n5. ORDERED FURTHER, that neither the authority granted nor the restrictions imposed in this Order shall be construed to be permanent except upon further order of the Court.\n\n6. ORDERED FURTHER, that the trial authority to provide interexchange telecommunications granted in this Order shall relate only to the geographic area defined as the Trial Territory.\n\n7. ORDERED FURTHER, that the trial authority to provide interexchange telecommunications granted in this Order shall include, and be limited to:\n\nproviding interexchange telecommunications originating in the Trial Territory and terminating anywhere in the United States or the world, including within the Trial Territory (other than interexchange telecommunications terminating outside the Trial Territory that are of a type that is ordinarily carried by the interexchange carrier selected at the terminating location);\n\nproviding collect, inbound 800, 900, 700, and other services billed to the called party to subscribers' locations in the Trial Territory;\n\nproviding 500, third-number, calling card, and debit card services marketed in the Trial Territory to subscribers in the Trial Territory, including the provision, in connection with those services, of resold switched interexchange services procured pursuant to tariff or contract from unaffiliated interexchange carriers;\n\nprivate line and other dedicated services with one end of the communication in the Trial Territory; and\n\nsubject to the notification, objection, and withdrawal provisions of this subparagraph, providing other interexchange telecommunications of a type that is provided, or would reasonably be provided, by interexchange carriers to their subscribers in the Trial Territory. Ameritech shall fully describe, to the Department, the appropriate state regulatory authorities, and all other interested persons, all such other interexchange telecommunications in a nonproprietary writing that shall be used by the Department to solicit comments, at least 30 days prior to their provision. Ameritech may also provide confidential information concerning the scope and nature of the proposed services to the Department, and the appropriate state regulatory authorities, but not to other persons, at the same time. In the event the Department does not object to Ameritech's provision of any such other telecommunications during said 30-day notification period, Ameritech may offer such other telecommunications, subject to any other applicable state or federal law and to the later withdrawal of authority under Paragraphs 15 and 16.\n\n8. ORDERED FURTHER, that the authority granted pursuant to this Order is limited to the provision of landline or wireline interexchange telecommunications other than any interexchange telecommunications service that originate on systems that provide commercial mobile radio services. Nothing contained within this Order exempts or otherwise relieves Ameritech or any of its affiliates from any applicable restrictions relating to the provision of wireless telecommunications.\n\nPreconditions to Waiver Authority\n\n9. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech shall not offer interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order until the Department has approved the offering of such telecommunications pursuant to the standards set forth in Paragraph 11. Ameritech shall have the burden of initiating the process of seeking such approval by reporting to the Department in writing, and providing copies of the report to the appropriate state regulatory authorities, and all other interested persons that within the Trial Territory:\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have implemented the unbundling of loops and ports for business and residential customers on terms approved by the appropriate state regulatory authority;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have made the necessary technical, operational, administrative and other changes to implement dialing parity for intraLATA toll telecommunications no later than 21 days prior to the effective date of Ameritech's authority pursuant to Paragraph 13 of this Order, on terms approved by the appropriate state regulatory authority;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have filed, and the appropriate state regulatory authority has approved, such tariff changes as are necessary to allow non-facilities-based competition (either through resale of the bundled local exchange telecommunications, or resale of unbundled loops and ports, or both, so long as the means chosen allow such competition) for all classes of service, including residential service;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have made and implemented reasonable and nondiscriminatory arrangements for sharing of pole attachments and conduit space, and reasonable and nondiscriminatory arrangements for Exchange Carriers to secure access to entrance facilities, risers, and telephone closets, to the extent such arrangements are under the control of Ameritech;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have implemented and publicly filed arrangements for interconnection with Exchange Carriers on terms acceptable to such Exchange Carriers or approved by the appropriate state regulatory authority and made generally available to all Exchange Carriers with respect to the same type of traffic, including arrangements for reciprocal compensation (if any) for terminating telecommunications traffic, provision of local exchange telecommunications support functions, dialing parity for local exchange telecommunications, and access to necessary services (including unbundled signalling and 611, 911, E911, call completion, and TRS relay services;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have implemented arrangements to offer all data necessary to provide 411 service under reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms;\n\nthe Ameritech local exchange operations have implemented appropriate arrangements, including obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, if any, for true number portability in the Trial Territory, with arrangements for allocating the costs thereof that do not place an unreasonable burden upon Exchange Carriers, except that if Ameritech is unable to fulfill this condition as of the date 120 days before the anticipated implementation of intraLATA dialing parity, this condition may be waived by the Department for purposes of the initial inception of interexchange authority under paragraphs 9-14 if (i) Ameritech explains in writing and with particularity why it is unable to meet this condition and sets forth a plan acceptable to the Department for achieving true number portability and (ii) the Ameritech local exchange operations have implemented arrangements, acceptable to such Exchange Carriers or approved by the appropriate state regulatory authority, for interim number portability from its central offices, with as little loss of functionality as reasonably possible, and with arrangements for allocating the costs thereof that do not place an unreasonable burden upon Exchange Carriers; and\n\nto the extent that Ameritech serves as the central office code administrator, the Ameritech local exchange operations have made reasonable efforts to transfer their duties as the central office code administrator to a neutral third party, and to the extent such efforts are not yet successful, have explained in writing why they are not yet successful, outlined the further steps they plan to take, and implemented a nondiscriminatory procedure for assigning central office codes.\n\n10. ORDERED FURTHER, that the Department shall not authorize Ameritech to offer interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order until Ameritech shall also have filed, and served on the appropriate state regulatory authorities and on all other interested persons, a compliance plan for the implementation of this Order. The compliance plan shall include:\n\na plan for implementing equal access to interexchange telecommunications sufficient to ensure that Ameritech provides access on a nondiscriminatory basis even where Ameritech is also a competing interexchange carrier;\n\nprocedures for identifying to new Ameritech local exchange telecommunications subscribers their choices for interexchange and intraLATA toll telecommunications;\n\nprocedures, in compliance with paragraph 23, for disseminating to interexchange carriers, intraLATA toll carriers and Exchange Carriers any plans for changes in its telecommunications facilities or for the implementation of new telecommunications, including signalling and support functions, that may affect such carriers' interconnection with the Ameritech local exchange operations;\n\na plan for separating the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary from Ameritech's other operations, as provided in Paragraph 20 and other paragraphs of this Order;\n\na plan setting out the conditions under and extent to which the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary shall be allowed to offer pricing for local exchange and interexchange telecommunications whose availability is contingent upon the subscriber's selection of Ameritech for both such services, when other carriers are offering similar pricing arrangements;\n\na plan setting out the terms whereby the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary may offer pricing for intraLATA toll and interexchange telecommunications whose availability is contingent upon the subscriber's selection of Ameritech for both such services, consistent with practices common in the industry;\n\nto the extent that contingent pricing as described in subparagraphs (e) and (f) is not permitted, a plan for notifying customers of the availabililty of such services on an unbundled basis;\n\na plan setting out the conditions under which the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary will be allowed to own, lease, or control any of the facilities it uses to provide local exchange telecommunications and exchange access services, including steps to ensure that any local exchange telecommunications or facilities obtained from the Ameritech local exchange operations are available to unaffiliated carriers on a nondiscriminatory basis;\n\na plan for detecting and reporting violations of this Order or of this compliance plan; and\n\na plan for orderly withdrawal from the provision of interexchange telecommunications in the event Ameritech's authority to offer interexchange telecommunications is discontinued pursuant to Paragraph 16 of this Order.\n\n11. ORDERED FURTHER, that:\n\nwithin 30 days following the filing of both the report pursuant to Paragraph 9 and the compliance plan pursuant to Paragraph 10 of this Order, the Department shall issue to Ameritech its request for additional information, if the Department elects to issue such a request. Within 60 days after Ameritech has substantially complied with the Department's request for additional information or 120 days after the filing of both the report pursuant to Paragraph 9 and the compliance plan pursuant to Paragraph 10 of this Order, whichever date occurs later, the Department shall issue its decision whether Ameritech may begin to offer interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order, which decision it shall file with the Court. Prior to rendering said decision, the Department shall solicit comments from the appropriate state regulatory authorities and interested persons, investigate the accuracy and sufficiency of the report and compliance plan, and take all other action reasonably necessary to the rendering of its decision. In obtaining comments from state or federal regulatory authorities, the Department may share any information received from Ameritech or other interested persons, subject to appropriate assurances against further disclosure by those authorities of confidential business information.\n\nTo render an affirmative decision on Ameritech's application, the Department must find that\n\nactual competition (including facilities-based competition) in local exchange telecommunications exists in the Trial Territory,\n\nthe conditions specified in paragraph 9 have been substantially satisfied, and that regulatory developments (including but not limited to those developments set forth in Paragraph 9 and the terms and conditions thereof) and market conditions offer substantial opportunities for additional local exchange competition, as evidenced by, among other things, the increasing availability of local exchange telecommunications alternatives for such customers,\n\nthe conditions described in (i) and (ii) above, together with regulatory protections, the Department's right to terminate Ameritech's interexchange telecommunications authority under Paragraph 16, the transport facilities restrictions of Paragraph 19, the compliance plan, the limited geographic scope described in Exhibit A, and the other provisions of this Order, are sufficient to ensure that there is no substantial possibility that Ameritech could use its position in local exchange telecommunications to impede competition for the provision of interexchange telecommunications to business or residential customers in the Trial Territory.\n\nIn making its decision, the Department may also take into account:\n\nthe extent of regulatory, statutory, and other legal certification, licensing, franchising, and similar requirements and the effect of such requirements on the development of local exchange telecommunications competition in the Trial Territory, and\n\nthe extent to which the Ameritech local exchange operations make available to unaffiliated interexchange and intraLATA toll carriers and Exchange Carriers in the Trial Territory electronic access to ordering, provisioning, and repair systems equivalent to the electronic access provided to its own local exchange operations' ordering, provisioning, and repair activities.\n\nPrior to rendering an affirmative decision on Ameritech's application, the Department shall ensure that Ameritech has installed and tested the capability of providing dialing parity for intraLATA toll telecommunications throughout the Trial Territory, and that Ameritech has taken all steps necessary to carry out the terms and conditions of its compliance plan.\n\nAn affirmative decision on Ameritech's application may be conditioned on any other terms that may be appropriate to further the purposes of this Order.\n\n12. ORDERED FURTHER, that the Department may engage the services of independent experts, selected by the Department in its sole discretion, to assist in its investigation, and Ameritech shall pay the reasonable expense incurred by the Department resulting from said engagement.\n\n13. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech shall not commence to provide interexchange telecommunications under this Order until the effective date of its authority to do so. Said effective date shall be at least 30 days subsequent to the date on which the Department issues its decision granting Ameritech authority under this Order.\n\n14. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech shall not publicly advertise its ability to provide the interexchange telecommunications authorized by this Order at any time prior to 10 days after issuance of the Department's decision granting Ameritech authority under this Order. Ameritech, however, may issue press releases, circulate intracorporate communications, make presentations to security analysts, and undertake similar activity regarding the subject matter of this Order at any time.\n\nDepartment Supervision\n\n15. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech shall report to the Department any violations of this Order or of its Compliance Plan, including corrective action taken, if any. If the Department, whether in response to such report or otherwise, determines (a) that Ameritech is violating any of the terms of this Order, its compliance plan, or terms imposed on Ameritech in connection with paragraph 11, or (b) that other conduct by Ameritech may impede competition for interexchange telecommunications in the Trial Territory, the Department, by written notice delivered to Ameritech and signed by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, may require Ameritech to discontinue such violations or other conduct forthwith, specifying with particularity the violations or other conduct to be discontinued. If Ameritech seeks review of the Department's decision by the Court, it shall have the burden of establishing that it is not in violation of this Order, or, in the case of other conduct, that there is no substantial possibility that such conduct will impede competition in interexchange telecommunications in the Trial Territory; provided further, that the Department may authorize the resumption of any conduct discontinued under this paragraph upon receipt of assurances from Ameritech satisfactory to the Department that the objectionable aspects thereof will be removed. If Ameritech violates any of the terms of this Order, its compliance plan, terms imposed on Ameritech in connection with paragraph 11, or requirements imposed pursuant to paragraph 15, the Department may seek civil fines.\n\n16. ORDERED FURTHER, that if the Department, irrespective of whether it has previously taken action under paragraph 15, determines that Ameritech has violated a provision of this Order or that the Department no longer believes that there is no substantial possibility that continuation of Ameritech's provision of interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order would impede competition for interexchange or intraLATA toll telecommunications, exchange access services or local exchange telecommunications in the Trial Territory, the Department, by written notice delivered to Ameritech and signed by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, stating the reasons for its determination, may require Ameritech to discontinue interexchange telecommunications authorized by this Order on or before the effective date stated in such notice, which effective date shall be not less than sixty days after the date such notice is delivered. Financial hardship to Ameritech resulting from such disconinuance shall not be a ground for opposing such discontinuance. If Ameritech seeks review of this determination by the Court, it shall have the burden of establishing that it did not violate this Order and that there is no substantial possibility that continuation of the provision of interexchange telecommunications pursuant to this Order would impede competition in interexchange, intraLATA toll, or local exchange telecommunications or exchange access services. The Department, having given such notice, may revoke or rescind it at any time before its effective date or may supplement its statement of reasons.\n\n17. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech may petition the Department for (a) the modification or elimination of any of the provisions of paragraphs 7(e) and 19-47 of this Order upon a showing that developing conditions warrant such a change, or (b) a geographic modification of the Trial Territory within the states listed in Exhibit A under the standard set forth in paragraph 11(b), giving notice to interested persons, the appropriate state regulatory authorities, and the Court. The Department may, prior to rendering its decision, solicit comments from the applicable state regulatory authorities and other interested persons or take any other investigatory action, including the sharing of information with state and federal regulatory authorities as set forth in paragraph 11. The effective date of any decision allowing such modification or elimination shall be not less than 30 days after the date such decision is rendered.\n\n18. ORDERED FURTHER, that the Department shall conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of the temporary waiver described in this Order and shall file a written report of this review with the Court on or before the third anniversary of the effective date of the authority provided under this Order.\n\nInterexchange Facilities\n\n19. ORDERED FURTHER, that Ameritech shall not own any of the transport facilities used to provide interexchange telecommunications authorized by this Order, but shall lease or otherwise procure the use of such facilities under tariffs or contracts from any provider not affiliated with Ameritech. None of the leases or other contracts for the use of interexchange transport facilities shall have a term in excess of five years.\n\nSeparate Subsidiary\n\n20. ORDERED FURTHER, that all Ameritech interexchange telecommunications authorized by this Order shall be provided by the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary. As provided by Paragraph 10 of this Order, the compliance plan required to be filed by Ameritech shall describe in detail the separation of Ameritech's local exchange operations from the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary.

Such parity reports shall, to the extent feasible, utilize the format of parity reports that Ameritech is then filing with the FCC.\n\n27. ORDERED FURTHER, that if the Ameritech local exchange operations provides billing services to the Ameritech interexchange subsidiary, the Ameritech local exchange operations shall offer equivalent billing services to unaffiliated interexchange and intraLATA toll carriers and Exchange Carriers on nondiscriminatory terms and rates.\n\n28.

ORDERED FURTHER, that for so long as this Order remains in effect, the Ameritech local exchange operations shall continue to make customer name and address lists relating to their local exchange telecommunications subscribers that are listed in its White Pages Directories commercially available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and rates.\n\n31.

ORDERED FURTHER, that in the event this Order is vacated or revoked, in whole or in part, or the furnishing of interexchange telecommunications is terminated pursuant to Paragraph 16 hereof, and no Order granting Ameritech a permanent waiver of the interexchange telecommunications restriction throughout its territory has by that time been granted, Ameritech shall be allowed 180 days to dispose of the assets deployed to provide the interexchange telecommunications authorized by this Order, or such lesser part of such assets as shall have become unlawful, by sale of such assets or by other means of separation of ownership, and no such sale or disposition shall be deemed to violate either the prohibition against providing telecommunications products contained in Section II(D)(2) of the Decree, provided, that the Court may extend the 180-day period provided for above for good cause shown.\n\n49.
