ACTION: Final rule; waiver. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission grants the Petition for Limited Waiver of Ameritech Communications Incorporated (``ACI''). In the petition, ACI sought a limited waiver of certain provisions of Section 22.903 of the Commission's rules, which set forth limitations on Bell Operating Companies that provide cellular service. As a result of the Commission's grant of the waiver, ACI is allowed to provide cellular service with access to ACI's landline facilities both inside and outside of Ameritech's region, on the conditions described further below.

Synopsis of the Memorandum Opinion and Order I. Background 1. On October 11, 1995, Ameritech Communications, Incorporated (``ACI'') filed a Petition for Limited Waiver (``Petition'') with the Commission. The Petition sought a waiver of certain provisions of Section 22.903 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR Sec. 22.903, which set forth various limitations on Bell Operating Companies (``BOCs'') that provide cellular service. Specifically, ACI, as an affiliate of Ameritech Corporation (a BOC), sought a waiver of Section 22.903(a), 47 CFR Sec. 22.903(a), which prohibits BOC affiliates that provide cellular service from owning any facilities for providing landline telephone service. ACI also sought a waiver of Section 22.903(e), 47 CFR Sec. 22.903(e), which prohibits BOCs from promoting or selling cellular service for their affiliates; ACI sought such a waiver to the extent that the provision would prohibit it from promoting or selling cellular service for Ameritech's cellular subsidiary, Ameritech Cellular Services (``ACS''). According to its Petition, ACI contended that it sought these limited waivers so that it could resell cellular services, or sell cellular services as a sales agent for ACS, to ACI customers, and thereby offer those customers one-stop shopping opportunities. 2. On October 19, 1995, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau sought comment on ACI's Petition to determine whether the request was consistent with the waiver criteria set forth in the Commission's rules, and whether the request was consistent with the Commission's public interest goals. See Public Notice, DA 95-2198, ``Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Seeks Comment on Ameritech's Petition for Partial Waiver of Section 22.903 of the Commission's Rules'' (released October 19, 1995). The Bureau received several comments. In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission grants ACI a waiver of Section 22.903(a), and declaratory relief from Section 22.903(e). II. Discussion 3. In its Petition, ACI, as a separate affiliate of Ameritech, sought authority to provide wireless and wireline service, as a facilities-based carrier. ACI sought a waiver of Section 22.903(a), which prohibits BOC affiliates from owning facilities for providing landline telephone service, because it needs to purchase switching equipment for landline traffic. ACI also sought a waiver of Section 22.903(e), which prohibits BOC affiliates from promoting or selling cellular service for another BOC affiliate, because ACI wishes to be a sales agent for ACS. In support of its Petition, ACI explained that it is a start-up carrier, and is structurally separate from Ameritech Operating Companies in all material respects, thereby diminishing opportunities for BOC cross-subsidization and interconnection discrimination. Thus, ACI explained, a waiver would further the public interest by promoting competition. 4. Several commenters opposed the waiver, claiming that a waiver would be anticompetitive. However, based on the record in this proceeding, and uncontroverted information received in another proceeding, ``Ameritech Communication's Inc. Petition for Nondominant Status'' (filed July 21, 1995), the Commission disagreed, and granted the waiver. 5. The Commission concluded that ACI's relationship with Ameritech and its other affiliates complies with the basic requirement of Section 22.903, which requires that BOCs provide cellular service through structurally separate subsidiaries. 6. In granting the requested waiver, the Commission noted two important events that transpired since ACI filed its Petition. First, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted. Public Law No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (1996), amending the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Secs. 151 et seq. Section 601(d) of the Act permits ACI to engage in joint marketing and resale of cellular services with landline services on the terms set forth in its Petition. However, the Commission stated that it would continue to apply the other requirements of Section 22.903 to ACI (except for 22.903(a), for which a waiver was granted, as explained below). Thus, the Commission noted that ``joint sales'' or resale by ACI of Ameritech's cellular services together with landline services must involve services acquired on an arm's length basis from ACI's affiliates, consistent with the affiliate transaction accounting rules and with the basic structural separation requirement of Section 22.903. The Commission observed that, because ACI is already established as a structurally separate affiliate, this requirement conforms not only with Section 601(d) but also with ACI's business plan. The Commission thus granted declaratory relief from Section 22.903(e), subject to certain conditions, discussed above. 7. The second development since ACI filed its petition is that the Commission has commenced a comprehensive review of competitive safeguards as they apply to local exchange carriers that provide commercial radio services (``CMRS''), including BOCs that provide cellular service. In the CMRS Safeguards Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 61 FR 46420 (September 3, 1996), the Commission proposed to amend Section 22.903(a) to permit a BOC cellular affiliate to own landline facilities for the provision of competitive landline local exchange service. The Commission has already waived Section 22.903(a) for all BOC affiliates' out-of-region operations (i.e., regions where the BOC is not the local exchange carrier), including ACI. The Commission concluded that ACI's separation from Ameritech's other affiliates provided a substantial basis for extending a waiver for ACI's in-region [[Page 50737]] operations as well. ACI's separation from both incumbent cellular operations and from incumbent local exchange operations lessens the Commission's concerns about improper cross-subsidization and discriminatory interconnection practices. Therefore, the Commission decided to permit ACI to provide cellular service with access to the landline facilities, both inside and outside Ameritech's region, as long as ACI remains structurally separate from Ameritech's telephone local exchange operating companies and its cellular affiliate. III. Ordering Clauses It is ordered that, pursuant to Sections 4 and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Secs. 154 and 303, and Sections 1.3 and 22.119 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR Secs. 1.3 and 22.119, a waiver of Section 22.903(a), 47 CFR Sec. 22.903(a), is GRANTED to Ameritech Communications, Incorporated. It is further ordered that, pursuant to Sections 4 and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. Secs. 154 and 303, and Section 1.2 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR Sec. 1.2, Ameritech Communications, Incorporated, IS DECLARED not subject to Section 22.903(e), subject to the conditions discussed herein.
