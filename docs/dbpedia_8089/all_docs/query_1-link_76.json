I'll get the rest of them going one of these days. Please - no spam on this group of subs. Only serious inquiries & answers.\n\nTOPIC - MLAC\n\nDATE - 02/02/98 22:32:32\n\nFROM - rbcp Ohio - bright.net\n\nFrom my recent experiences, I've found that all Bell Atlantic territory is near impossible to get any information out of mlac/facs. I've always claimed to be a tech working in a box, but BA says that techs never call mlac, they call their supervisors.\n\nAnyone have any experience/ideas with these guys? I'm a really persistant person and I've had no luck at all with BA. I'm using their employee locater to create a list of employees in specific areas so I can start dropping names but that'll take awhile.\n\nAlso, what the hell is the difference between FACS and MLAC. I mean, I know what the acronyms stand for, but why are they named different? As far as I can tell, they do the same things.\n\nTOPIC - handset\n\nDATE - 02/06/98 14:35:43\n\nFROM - hobKnob 414\n\numm n/m i spoke w/ my friend...\n\nit's apparently not an \"ameritech\"\n\nhand set..

Jimbo works in Indianapolis in the downtown building. I used to sleep on their sidewalk so Jimbo probably stepped over me before to get in the building. Then again, he probably didn't.\n\nTOPIC - Ameritech\n\nDATE - 02/04/98 12:34:59\n\nFROM - The MF\n\nTo think at my job I've talked with my share of high ranking Ameritech people, but alas, I never got to talk to meet Jim Bayless.\n\nTOPIC - Wisconsin Bell\n\nDATE - 02/02/98 22:26:48\n\nFROM - rbcp Ohio - bright.net\n\nWisconsin Bell is what it was called before they renamed themselves Ameritech in 1993. There was also Illinois Bell, Indiana Bell, etc. They're just too damned lazy to replace all of the pay phones. I still see alot of Indiana Bell pay phones when I'm driving through there.\n\nTOPIC -\n\nDATE - 02/02/98 08:38:49\n\nFROM - Interrupt\n\nCathode do you lugg that around. I hate my Ameritaech handset. It sucks it is huge. Also alot of other electronic companies sell handsets. Search the net if anyone needs to find one\n\nTOPIC -\n\nDATE - 02/02/98 07:43:49\n\nFROM - Cathode Ray\n\nCheck out www.tech-tools.com. I dont know if they have their line handsets featured on the web page, but if not, order a catalog. They have a handset that was around 4 grand. I creamed my jeans when reading that stats on it. Its called the \"Helix\" or some shit like that. A must see, it will blow you away.\n\nTOPIC - Ameritech\n\nDATE - 01/30/98 08:38:39\n\nFROM - Interrupt\n\nTheir ANI numbers change every three months. Which sucks. Here is an ANI number that has worked for me in Flordia, WI, IL, Indiana, and ohio.\n\n11073217709889664\n\nThis also gives Area Code and A bunch of bullshit numbers at the end. This is an ATT ANI number. Have phun!!\n\nI hate Ameritech Lineman's Handset's. They are Orange and fucking huge. I have one(I obtained Legally)and it sucks. All though if you have ever ripped of a truck They have a whole bunch of kick ass tools like those that open up the screws on payphone panels\n\nTOPIC - test numbers\n\nDATE - 01/30/98 07:48:50\n\nFROM - siliconphreak 812, IN -\n\ni am looking for a proctor test number. if anyone has it let me know.\n\n200 ANI\n\n777,phone num, flash, hangup\n\nif anyone has any numbers let me know.\n\nTOPIC - Ameritech\n\nDATE - 01/28/98 20:22:43\n\nFROM - The MF\n\nWho's bright idea at ameritech was it to initiate ZONE calls and so forth? Long distance charges shouldn't apply to calls that would be a mere 9 miles away.\n\nSure, ISDN is quite affordable there, but the price you pay for just basic local service is outrageous. Thank gawd I'm in US West, where you can call anywhere in the area code for no metered costs or anytting like that. But the downside is that ISDN is prohibitely expensive(metered). Guess you can't have it both ways.\n\nTOPIC - AmeriBel\n\nDATE - 01/28/98 16:49:43\n\nFROM - hobKnob\n\nok.. i'll be the first...\n\non wisconsin payphones.. milwaukee ones at least... it says..
