        "text": "Frank Saul, Jr., who started at Seton Hall in 1942, left to serve in World War II and then came back to the University in 1946, was the first Pirates basketball player to score 1,000 career points. He captained the team for three seasons and was part of the 1946–47 team that came back from World War II to win its first 18 games. At the time of his induction, he was seventh on the all-time scoring list with 1,011 points. After graduating, he spent six years in the NBA and was a member of four championship teams — Rochester (1951) and Minneapolis (1952, ’53, ’54)."
