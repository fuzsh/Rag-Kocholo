        "text": "Being diagnosed with cancer catapults patients and their families into an unfamiliar landscape of medical terminology, decision-making, and lifestyle changes. As a result, cancer patients encounter a new set of informational needs. Research has shown that most cancer patients (74%–98%) want as much information as possible about their disease and its treatment (Cassileth, Zupkis, Sutton-Smith & March, 1980; Chen & Siu, 2001; James, James, Davies, Harvey, & Tweddle, 1999; Jenkins, Fallowfield, & Saul, 2001). Although doctors and other medical professionals are generally the cancer patients’ primary source of information, most patients seek out additional information about the cancer itself (e.g., etiology and course of disease, physical effects of disease, and stage of disease), rehabilitation (e.g., recovery time and nutrition during recovery), and prognosis (Finney Rutten, Arora, Bakos, Aziz & Rowland, 2005; Nair, Hickok, Roscoe, & Morrow, 2000; Talosig-Garci & Davis, 2005) from a variety of interpersonal (e.g., friends, family, and other cancer patients) and mediated sources (e.g., TV, magazines, and the Internet) (Jenkins, Fallowfield, & Saul, 2001; Finney Rutten, Arora, Bakos, Aziz & Rowland, 2005; Carlsson, 2000; Mills & Davidson, 2002; Silliman, Dukes, Sullivan & Kaplan, 1998).\n\nSome evidence suggests that information can reduce anxiety associated with the diagnosis (e.g., Davidson, Goldenberg, Gleave & Denger, 2003; Michie, Rosebert, Heaversedge, Madden & Parbhoo, 1996) and assist in coping with the effects of the disease itself (e.g., Harrison-Woermke & Graydon, 1993; Zemore & Shepel, 1987). One study found that cancer patients who sought information via the Internet participated more actively in treatment-related decision-making, and asked more questions of their doctors during a visit (Bauerle Bass, Burt Ruzek, & Gordon, 2006). However, other studies have found that information seekers and non-seekers may differ demographically (Czaja, Manfredi & Price, 2003) as well as in terms of informational coping styles (i.e. monitoring vs. blunting) (Barnoy, Bar-Tal & Zisser, 2006), suggesting that the effects of information seeking may not be independent of one’s propensity to seek out information. Nevertheless, a randomized clinical trial examining the effects of providing (or not providing) women attending an out-patient breast clinic with information prior to their initial consultation found that members of the information-receiving treatment groups experienced less anxiety about their exam, less anxiety about what the doctor might find, and perceived their problem as less serious than did those in the no-message control group (Michie et al., 1996). Studies using more macro levels of analysis have noted that rates of breast-conserving surgery were highest in states that had informed-consent laws requiring physicians to provide patients with information about different treatments options (Farrow DC, Hunt WC, Samet, 1992; Ganz, 1992; Nattinger, Gottlieb, Veum, Yahnke & Goodwin, 1992; Fraenkel & McGraw, 2007). These studies suggest that the effects of information on cancer patients’ decision-making are not limited to those who are inclined to seek out information on their own, and that encouraging cancer patients to seek out information about their cancer may lead to more informed cancer-related decision-making.\n\nAlthough, some research has identified a few demographic (Czaja et al., 2003; Mayer et al., 2007) and psychological differences (Barnoy et al., 2006) between those who tend to seek out cancer-related information and those who do not, little is known about the psychosocial factors that predict cancer patient’s intentions to seek out information related to their cancer, or about the relation between intentions to seek information and actual seeking behavior. This study uses the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (IM) (Fishbein, 2000, 2008; Fishbein & Yzer, 2003) as a theoretical model for examining predictors of cancer patient’s intentions to seek information about their cancer from sources other than their doctors at baseline, as well as their actual information seeking behavior at follow-up one year later.\n\nThe Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction\n\nThe IM is a model that specifies a set of constructs that predict behavioral performance, and is based on the health belief model (Janz & Becker, 1984; Rosenstock, 1974), the theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986), and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1988, 1991) and is illustrated in . The IM posits that an intention to perform (or not perform) a behavior is a precondition for engaging in the behavior. Behavioral intentions (BI), in turn, are a function of attitudes (ATT) toward performing the behavior in question, perceptions of normative pressure (PNP) to engage in (or not engage in) the behavior, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) with respect to performing the behavior. More specifically, ATT toward the behavior refers to the degree to which one is in favor of or opposed to performing the behavior; is my performance of the behavior pleasant or unpleasant? Is it wise or foolish, harmful or beneficial? PNP refers to a person’s perception of the degree to which important others think he or she should or should not perform the behavior, as well as perceptions of whether or not similar or important others are themselves performing the behavior. PBC assesses a person’s belief that they do, or do not, have the ability to perform the particular behavior under a number of challenging circumstances; that performing the behavior is, or is not, under the person’s control. Also according to the IM, the influence of distal variables, such as demographic factors, cancer type, and cancer stage, on intention should be mediated through ATT, PNP, and PBC. The influence of ATT, PNP, and PBC on behavior should be mediated through BI, although in some instances PBC may have a direct influence on behavior.\n\nThe Current Study\n\nThis study was designed to test some of the IMs theoretical predictions as a means for understanding the factors associated with cancer patient’s intentions to seek information and their actual information seeking behavior. Specifically, we examined three main hypotheses. First, according to the IM, behavioral intentions should be reliably predicted from the psychosocial variables ATT, PNP, and PBC. Second, the effects of demographic variables on intentions should not contribute, or contribute very little to the prediction of intentions over and above the effects of ATT, PNP, and PBC. Third, BI should have a direct and significant impact on behavior and should mediate the effects of ATT, PNP, and PBC on behavior. Tests of these relationships will provide insight into the factors that contribute to information seeking among cancer patients, and suggest strategies for modifying information seeking intentions and behavior.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough numerous studies have examined the sources that cancer patients consult for information about their cancer, and the types of information they look for (e.g., Finney Rutten et al., 2003), this is the first study to examine the attitudinal, normative, and control factors that drive cancer patient’s intentions to seek information about their cancer from sources other than their doctors, as well as their actual information-seeking behavior. This study demonstrates that the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction (Fishbein, 2000, 2008; Fishbein & Yzer, 2003) is a useful model for understanding the psychosocial predictors of cancer patient information-seeking intentions and behavior. Specifically, patients’ intentions to seek information about their cancer from sources other than their doctor(s) were reliably associated with ATT, PNP, and PBC about information seeking. Seeking intentions were driven primarily by attitudes toward seeking and normative pressure and PBC played a relatively minor role in accounting for seeking intentions. These findings are consistent with others who have found that attitudes and normative pressure are predictive of cancer patients’ intentions to seek out psychosocial support in the form of support groups, social workers, and others (Steginga, et al., 2008).\n\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that, although their contribution to the prediction of intentions was small (together they accounted for an additional 3%), level of education, age, having breast cancer, and being diagnosed with advanced stage disease contributed significantly to the prediction of seeking intentions over and above the IM constructs. The theoretical explanation is that these background variables are proposed to influence the behavioral, normative, and control beliefs that underlie ATT, PNP, and PBC respectively, not necessarily through the direct measures of these constructs included in this study. Nevertheless, in practice it is important to realize that older individuals and those with lower levels of education are less likely, and those with breast cancer and more advanced stages of cancer are more likely to intend to seek out information from sources other than their doctors.\n\nThe majority (76%) of those who expressed intentions to seek at baseline reported having sought at follow-up. As predicted by the IM, intentions to seek predicted actual seeking and mediated the effects of ATT and PNP on behavior (there was no direct effect of PBC on behavior). Being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer was the only background variable associated with seeking behavior after accounting for the predicted effects of the IM constructs and past seeking behavior. Interestingly, there was a significant effect of PNP at baseline on follow-up behavior that was not entirely mediated by intentions. One possible explanation is that those who experienced more normative pressure to seek out information at baseline eventually complied and sought information at follow-up even though at baseline they had not initially intended to do so. The effect of PNP on behavior may also help to account for a portion of the 41% of respondents who did not express intentions to seek at baseline but reported seeking at follow-up. This finding also suggests that many cancer patients may not anticipate the advent of new health or psychosocial issues about which they might seek information, and seems to indicate that a considerable proportion of cancer-related information seeking occurs in response to unanticipated informational needs. Our results might be accounted for if patients’ attitudes towards seeking became more positive and/or they experienced substantial normative pressure to seek between baseline and follow-up.\n\nFinally, compared to those diagnosed with less advanced disease (stages 0, 1, and 2), being diagnosed with advanced stage disease was predictive of both intentions to seek and actual seeking of cancer-related information from sources other than one’s doctor(s). Others have found that relative to medical treatment information, patients receive significantly less advice about psychosocial care and must therefore seek out that information on their own, and those who experience more cancer-related distress have stronger intentions to seek (Steginga, et al., 2008). Although our data do not speak to this directly, it is likely that compared to those diagnosed with less advanced disease, those diagnosed with more advanced disease may experience more distress and be faced more acutely with psychosocial issues about which information from sources other than their doctors may be quite useful (e.g., learning to live with cancer, and end of life issues).\n\nPractical implications\n\nInformation seeking among cancer patients is a fairly common behavior, and previous research suggests that information seeking is associated with a number of positive outcomes (Butow, Boyer, & Tattersall, & Brown, 1999; Davidson, et al., 2003; Ganz, 1992; Michie, et al., 1996). Given that intentions to seek information were most strongly associated with attitudes toward information seeking, persuasive appeals targeting patient’s attitudes toward information seeking by highlighting the usefulness of information seeking will likely lead to changes in information seeking intentions and behavior. The finding that norms are also important predictors of information seeking intentions and given that doctors and family members are among cancer patients’ most important referents (e.g., Talosig-Garcia & Davis, 2005) it would seem that these referents can have a significant impact on the patients’ information seeking behaviors. In addition, it could be hypothesized that older individuals and those with lower levels of education are most likely to benefit from encouragement to seek out information. However, research has shown that some informational resources are of questionable quality (Chen & Siu, 2001; Hoffman-Goetz & Clarke, 2000; Silberg, Lundberg, & Musacchio, 1997). Providing patients with a circumscribed list of reliable informational resources may make the information seeking process more enjoyable and assure exposure to high-quality information. Future research could test these hypothesized causal associations by examining the effects of persuasive messages aimed at creating positive attitudes towards seeking information about cancer. More specifically, according to the Integrative Model, one strategy would be to identify the specific behavioral beliefs that distinguish those who intend to seek information from those who do not. Messages should emphasize positive beliefs about information seeking held by intenders and redress negative beliefs held by non-intenders. Also, according to the results reported here and the IM’s theoretical predictions, these messages might be most effective if delivered by an important source of social influence such as the patient’s doctor or significant other.\n\nLimitations\n\nWe should note some specific limitations of this study. This study’s sample consisted entirely of Pennsylvania residents who may not be representative of cancer patients from other regions. Generalization of these results to other populations should be made cautiously where reason exists to believe that cancer patients in Pennsylvania differ from other populations on relevant dimensions. Also, this study relied exclusively on self-report data and no attempt was made to verify any actual information seeking. As such, rates of reported seeking behavior are subject to the problems inherent in using self-report data such as recall bias and social desirability influences. Another limitation is that the study did not measure patient’s anxiety about their cancer or their level of literacy, two factors that research suggests may be associated with cancer information seeking (Dubois & Loiselle, 2009; Kim, et al., 2003). In addition, some research suggests that there are gender differences with regard to the use of and satisfaction with cancer information (e.g., Dubois & Loiselle, 2009). Because we chose to examine patterns across three types of cancer and cancer type was confounded with gender, our findings are not informative with regard to any gender differences in cancer information seeking intentions or behavior."
