        "text": "DALLAS LatinWorks is taking its “Never blend in” Hennessy campaign to the East Coast.\n\nThe Austin, Texas-based independent Hispanic agency first broke work for the campaign last fall in spot markets including Houston and Dallas. The campaign is designed to show a connection between celebrities who, like the cognac, are unique. The earlier effort, which is still running, features Mexican rocker Saul Hernandez.\n\nThe new campaign, which breaks this week in New York and New Jersey, features Tego Calderon, an artist who specializes in a mix of hip-hop, reggae and tropical dance genres."
