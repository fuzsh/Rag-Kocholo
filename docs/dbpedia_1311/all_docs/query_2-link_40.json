        "text": "I'm getting ready to head to D11, the latest edition of the tech conference run by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher of AllThingsD. I haven't been to all of them, but I've been to most of them starting with the very first one in 2003. I consider it to be the second-best conference in the world behind TED, although I've never been to Davos or Sun Valley. Coincidentally, the conference was named \"D\" for Digital by Richard Saul Wurman who started TED.\n\nWhat makes it so great? The Speakers and the Audience. Every year you ask yourself \"how can they top the speaker list next year?\" and yet they do it again and again. The audience is a veritable \"who's who\" in the tech world, and most of them would be the speakers at any other conference. It also has one of the best swag bags in the business - lately there's usually been a smartphone with working SIM card, and I think this year it would be a brilliant marketing move by Google to include a pair of Glasses (wishful thinking). Here's a look at what was in a recent gift bag.\n\nSome highlights over the years:\n\nD1 in 2003 - Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Barry Diller, Sergey Brin,\n\nD2 in 2004 - The iconic Red Chairs appeared, as did Steve Jobs again, Larry Ellison\n\nD3 in 2005 - Nicholas Negroponte, Gates, Jobs\n\nD4 in 2006 - Marissa Mayer, Steve Burke, Howard Stringer, Vinod Khosla\n\nD5 in 2007 - Bill Gates and Steve Jobs together, George Lucas, Eric Schmidt\n\nD6 in 2008 - Mark Zuckerberg, Bobby Kotick, Jeff Bezos, Jeff Bewkes,\n\nD7 in 2009 - An infamous Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz interview, Ev and Biz from Twitter, John Malone, John Lilly\n\nD8 in 2010 - Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steve Jobs' last D interview (if you're counting, he spoke at 5 D conferences over the years - that might be as many as all the other non-Apple conferences he ever spoke at combined)\n\nD9 in 2011 - Bob Iger of Disney, Reed Hastings of Netflix, Marc Andreessen, Andrew Mason of Groupon.\n\nD10 in 2012 - Mary Meeker, Mark Pincus, Aaron Sorkin,\n\nSome Iconic moments -\n\nZuckerberg sweating about privacy\n\nAndrew Mason's death stare when asked about the impending IPO\n\nBill Gates and Steve Jobs - the full interview with them together\n\nLarry Ellison on what he learned from Steve Jobs and how he feels about Marc Benioff.\n\nAri Emanuel, Superagent.\n\nStanford President John Hennessy and Khan Academy's Salman Khan on the future of higher education\n\nThe tech demo section includes as many misses as hits - but on the positive side there were some real hits and firsts, like Pure Digital's Flip that was pretty much flipped to Cisco because of their time on the D stage, and then there was Siri and their first public demo, along with the first XBox Kinect demo.\n\nMy personal favorite moments include:\n\nGoing for a run one morning with Garry Betty, the former CEO of Earthlink at my first D in 2003 - he was such a nice guy, and sadly he passed away in 2007.\n\nSitting down for dinner and starting a conversation with the one other person at the table - only after a while do I learn he's Barry Sonnenfeld who directed some of my favorite movies ever including Get Shorty. Then Martha Stewart comes by and joins us.\n\nAt D1 in 2003 my Handspring Treo 90 phone broke and I happened to see Handspring founder Jeff Hawkins there and took it up to him - he looked at it, acknowledged what was a widespread problem, and apologized along with a suggestion of how to get it fixed at the nearest Sprint store. I later heard from people who worked at Palm, \"YOU were the guy that walked up to him with the physically broken Palm at D?!? We never heard the end of that one...\"\n\nAnd my question from the audience with Steve Jobs during his last appearance there that turned into more than I bargained for - the clip is at the bottom of this post on How to Work a Conference.\n\nSo that's why I think D is worth going to if you have a chance -- and definitely a conference worth working.\n\nRead more coverage of D11 from Influencers:\n\nEsther Dyson: From 3D Printers to Fancy Swag, What I Expect to See at D11\n\nJohn Abell: Google, Give Us a Hint -- Is Chrome or Android the Future?\n\nIlya Pozin: The Tough Questions Tech CEOs Need to be Asked\n\nRita King: When Will Twitter Monetize TV?\n\nDave Kerpen: 6 Secrets to Better Networking at D11, or Any Conference\n\nPhoto: Screenshot from D5, 2007, allthingsd.com"
