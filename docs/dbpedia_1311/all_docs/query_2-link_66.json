        "text": "John Morton famously was a member of Seton Hall’s 1989 NCAA Final Four team. During that season, he averaged a team-high 17.3 points a game, was named All-BIG EAST, BIG EAST All-Tournament and the recipient of the Haggerty Award as the Metropolitan area’s most outstanding player. In the national championship game vs. Michigan, he scored 35 points, including an NCAA record 25 in the second half. At the time of his induction, he ranked 10th on the all-time scoring list with 1,621 points. Selected in the first round of the 1989 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Morton played in the NBA for three seasons before moving overseas and then beginning a career in collegiate coaching."
