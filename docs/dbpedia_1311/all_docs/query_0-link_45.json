Participating students may sign up for CIC courses and, upon\n\ncompletion of appropriate associated academic activities, receive credit for\n\ntheir participation.\n\n4. The\n\nSenate reminds the campus that, because of the paucity of available Mondays in\n\nthe Fall 2007 semester, finals will be held on the first and last Saturday of\n\nfinals week.\n\n5. Gene\n\nChelberg, Director of Disability Programs and Services, has been appointed\n\nAssociate Vice President for Student Services.

She will administer four areas: AV and media services, online\n\nteaching and learning including iLearn, instructional media production and\n\nenhanced classrooms. Her position reports to the AVP for Academic Resources.\n\nShe has initiated an inventory of all physical and human computing resources\n\nand needs on campus as a preliminary step to developing a vision for the\n\neducational uses of technology at SF State. Dr. Beers pointed out that CSU\n\nexpects to devote $180M to academic technology purchases over the next three\n\nyears, and campuses need a coherent plan to apply for a share of these funds.\n\nShe will work with the Senate through the Strategic Issues Committee to develop\n\npolicies regarding on-line courses and teaching.\n\nA description\n\nof the position of Director of Academic Technology was attached to the agenda.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #1—Approval of the Agenda for September\n\n11, 2007\n\nThe agenda was\n\napproved by acclamation.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #2—Approval of the Minutes for the last\n\nmeeting of 2006-2007 Academic Senate on May 15, 2007\n\nThe minutes were\n\napproved by acclamation.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #3—Approval of the Minutes for the first\n\nmeeting of the 2007-2008 Academic Senate on May 15, 2007\n\nThe minutes were\n\napproved by acclamation.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #4—Election for the Academic Senate\n\nElections Committee: Three members of the Academic Senate are needed to run\n\nSenate Elections and both oversee and validate University-Wide Elections.\n\nNominations will be accepted from the floor of the Senate\n\nSix Senators were nominated:\n\nYitwah Cheung, Sudip Chattopadhyay, Don Danner, Wei Ming Dariotis, Donna\n\nHubbard, Dianne Mahan and Hafez Modirzadeh.

The\n\nmost current estimates show that the University's budget has a deficit of\n\n$6.5M, due mostly to shortfalls in non-resident tuition and increased costs of\n\nsalaries and benefits. CSU did not fully fund the campus for increased costs\n\nincurred as a result of new contracts with faculty and staff signed last year.\n\nSF State enrollments continue to grow, and the budget situation would be worse\n\nwithout the funds received to support this growth.\n\nDr. Morishita reported on the SF\n\nState Master Plan, which may go to the Board of Trustees for approval in\n\nSeptember. Recent changes to the plan have included increased student, faculty\n\nand staff housing and a reduction in the size of the conference center. SF\n\nState continues to negotiate with the City and County of San Francisco over the\n\neffects of the plan as outlined in the Environmental Impact Report.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #6—Report from Ramon Castellblanch,\n\nPresident, California Faculty Association (CFA)\n\nDr. Castellblanch addressed the\n\nSenate on the aims and goals of the California Faculty Association, both\n\nlocally and statewide. He said that CFA works to protect the quality and\n\naffordability of public higher education in California through campus\n\nactivities, systemwide negotiations and political lobbying. They aim to be more\n\nvisible on campus and hope to participate in future Fall Convocations. Dr.\n\nCastellblanch reminded the Senate of the need for departments to create a pool\n\nof candidates for Faculty Hearing Panels as required by the contract.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #7—Report from Susan Shimanoff, Chair,\n\nGraduation Requirements Task Force\n\nDr. Shimanoff reviewed the history of the Task Force and\n\nreported that the Task Force has developed a draft statement of goals for the\n\nSF State baccalaureate degree (which was attached to the agenda). It will be\n\nsent to the campus shortly for comment. The Senate discussed the draft briefly,\n\nand Dr. Shimanoff asked those concerned send their comments in writing to the\n\nTask Force. She emphasized that the Task Force has not begun translating the\n\nvision contained in the draft statement into course and unit requirements.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #8—Report from Helen Goldsmith,\n\nAssociate Dean, Undergraduate Studies: New Liberal Studies Faculty\n\nThe Liberal Studies Program hired five faculty last year, the\n\nfirst to report directly to the Liberal Studies Program. The focus of the\n\nProgram will continue to be on teacher-training, but changes in state and\n\nfederal regulation have provided Liberal Studies with the opportunity to revise\n\ntheir curriculum. Since they are the first faculty hired by a campus program\n\nnot housed in a college, Senate rules will need to be modified to include the\n\nLiberal Studies faculty in shared governance and the structure of the Liberal\n\nStudies Council may have to be modified to take account of their role.\n\nAGENDA ITEM #9—Academic Senate Elections\n\nList of nominees was distributed at the meeting.\n\n1.
