        "text": "Alex John London\n\nK&L Gates Professor of Ethics and Computational Technologies\n\nBio\n\nAlex John London is the K&L Gates Professor of Ethics and Computational Technologies, co-lead of the K&L Gates Initiative in Ethics and Computational Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University, Director of the Center for Ethics and Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, and Chief Ethicist at the Block Center for Technology and Society at Carnegie Mellon University. An elected Fellow of the Hastings Center, Professor London’s work focuses on ethical and policy issues surrounding the development and deployment of novel technologies in medicine, biotechnology and artificial intelligence, on methodological issues in theoretical and practical ethics, and on cross-national issues of justice and fairness. His book, For the Common Good: Philosophical Foundations of Research Ethics is available in hard copy from Oxford University Press and is available here in PDF as an open access title. His papers have appeared in Mind, The Philosopher’s Imprint, Science, JAMA, The Lancet, The BMJ, PLoS Medicine, Statistics In Medicine, The Hastings Center Report, and numerous other journals and collections. He is also co-editor of Ethical Issues in Modern Medicine, one of the most widely used textbooks in medical ethics.\n\nProfessor London is a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Group on Ethics and Governance of AI whose “Guidance on Large Multi-Modal Models” was published in 2024 and whose report, “Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health” was published in 2021. From 2022–2023 he was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine Committee on Creating a Framework for Emerging Science, Technology, and Innovation in Health and Medicine, whose report \"Toward Equitable Innovation in Health and Medicine: A Framework” was published in 2023. He is currently a co-leader of the ethics core for the NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING). In 2023 he was a conference program co-chair for the 6th AAAI / ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Society (AIES) and he has served on the program committee for the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) conference and AIES (in 2021 and 2022) and from 2017-2019 he was a judge for the IBM Watson AI X-Prize.\n\nFor more than a decade, Professor London has helped to shape key ethical guidelines for the oversight of research with human participants. He is currently a member of the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB). From 2012-2016 he was a member of the Working Group on the Revision of CIOMS 2002 International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects. Prior to that he was an expert commentator at three World Medical Association meetings for the revision of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki. From 2007-2018 he was a member of the Ethics Working Group of the U.S. HIV Prevention Trials Network where he was part of the group that drafted the HIV Prevention Trials Network Ethics Guidance for Research. From 2016-2017 he was part of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine Committee on Clinical Trials During the 2014-15 Ebola Outbreak and in 2016 he was appointed to the U.S. Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Blood and Tissue Safety and Availability. He is currently a member of the board of directors for Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research and he has served on the board of the International Association of Bioethics and the American Society of Bioethics. He has served as an ethics expert in consultations with numerous national and international organizations including U.S. National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization (here, and here), the World Medical Association, and the World Bank.\n\nEthics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nProfessor London’s work in ethics and AI focuses on structural obstacles to safe and effective technologies and mechanisms for ensuring social trust, accountability and non-domination. This includes work on the nature of bias in algorithms and the disconnect between technical uses of this concept and ethical benchmarks. He has critiqued requirements of explainability and interpretability in the medical context and argued instead that accountability and freedom from arbitrary interference are better served by institutions and process for validating claims about what AI systems can do, clarifying the contexts under which those claims hold and when they do not. His work on ethical issues in the development and deployment of AI systems extends beyond medicine to include the regulation and evaluation of autonomous vehicles and ethical issues arising from real-time video surveillance of older adults.\n\nEthical Foundations of Research with Humans\n\nProfessor London has written widely on foundational issues in the ethics and design of research with human subjects. His work on clinical equipoise and the “integrative approach” to risk assessment provides clear operational content to the requirement that risks in research be reasonable and that research should be designed to produce valuable information. His work on the ethics of international research has helped to shape the debate about the requirements of justice, responsiveness to host community health needs, post-trial access, how to define the standard of care and how to use the concept of clinical equipoise in cross-national research.\n\nEthics of Regulation and Oversight\n\nProfessor London has articulated a non-paternalistic foundation for the ethical oversight of research involving human subjects. With colleagues, he has written a series of papers articulating a model for understanding clinical translation that identifies key benchmarks for assessing the ethical and scientific merits of proposals to reform research practice. This work emphasizes the role of incentives in aligning the parochial interests of stakeholders with the social mission of producing valid, reliable, and relevant scientific information.\n\nFoundational Ethical Issues\n\nIn addition to his work on practical ethical and policy issues, Professor London maintains an active research program on foundational ethical and methodological issues in theoretical and practical ethics. He has explored the value of dignity in Kantian moral frameworks and the challenges this concept poses for rational decision making, in both group and individual choice settings. He has also written about methodological issues in practical ethics.\n\nHonors and Awards\n\nProfessor London received the Elliott Dunlap Smith Award for Distinguished Teaching and Educational Service in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. He received the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) and a New Directions Fellowship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nProfessor London is an affiliated faculty member of the Center for Bioethics and Health Law at the University of Pittsburgh and was previously a Visiting Scholar at the Harvard University Program in Ethics and Health. Before joining Carnegie Mellon in 2000, he was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics and he received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Virginia.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nThe PDFs of these papers are intended for personal academic use only and should not be distributed in any way.\n\nBooks\n\nLondon AJ (2021) For the Common Good: Philosophical Foundations of Research Ethics. Oxford University Press.\n\nAvailable here in PDF as an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.\n\nAvailable in hard copy from Oxford University Press.\n\nThe foundations of research ethics are riven with fault lines emanating from a fear that if research is too closely connected to weighty social purposes an imperative to advance the common good through research will justify abrogating the rights and welfare of study participants. The result is an impoverished conception of the nature of research, an incomplete focus on actors who bear important moral responsibilities, and a system of ethics and oversight highly attuned to the dangers of research but largely silent about threats of ineffective, inefficient, and inequitable medical practices and health systems. In For the Common Good: Philosophical Foundations of Research Ethics, Alex John London defends a conception of the common good that grounds a moral imperative with two requirements. The first is to promote research that generates the information necessary to enable key social institutions to effectively, efficiently, and equitably safeguard the basic interests of individuals. The second is to ensure that research is organized as a voluntary scheme of social cooperation that respects its various contributors moral claims to be treated as free and equal. Connecting research to the goals of a just social order grounds a framework for assessing and managing research risk that reconciles these requirements and justifies key oversight practices in non-paternalistic terms. Reconceiving research ethics as resolving coordination problems and providing credible assurance that these requirements are being met expands the issues and actors that fall within the purview of the field and provides the foundation for a more unified and coherent approach to domestic and international research.\n\nTextbook\n\nEthical Issues In Modern Medicine, 8th edition.
