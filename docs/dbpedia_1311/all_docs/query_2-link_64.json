        "text": "Scott was born Melody Ann Thomas in Los Angeles, California. Her first film credit was as a child actress in the 1964 Alfred Hitchcock movie, Marnie (1964). After bit parts in movies in the mid-'70s (most notably in John Wayne's final film, Der Scharfschütze (1976)), she was offered bit parts on nighttime series, such as Die Waltons (1972), Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974) and Drei Engel für Charlie (1976).\n\nIn 1979, at the age of 23, she began playing the part of stripper \"Nikki Reed\" on the daytime serial, Schatten der Leidenschaft (1973), choosing the part over a sitcom pilot that, in the end, was not picked up. She was a replacement for the previous Nikki, who had lasted six months. Over time, her character reformed and became an important part of Genoa City society, as she married \"Victor Newman\" (Eric Braeden). Scott has said, \"It's a miracle for an actor to have a job last 28 years\", although she finds it frustrating to go through periods when she doesn't have a storyline. In 1987, she was offered to play the role of \"Taylor Hughes\" on Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956), but turned the offer down.\n\nScott was parodied in the satire publication, \"The Onion\", in 1999, in which a picture was edited to show her holding a Daytime Emmy (that year, Susan Lucci won the Emmy after 19 nominations). The caption read \"Awards Given Out Randomly To Skinny Blonde Women\". She appeared on various game shows over the years, including Family Feud (1976) (with various \"Young and the Restless\" co-stars), The $10,000 Pyramid (1973), Body Language (1983) and Match Game (1990).\n\nAisha Tyler is an award-winning director, actor, comedian, New York Times bestselling author, podcaster and activist.

It won Outstanding Achievement in Feature Filmmaking at the 2017 Newport Beach Film Festival and was chosen \"Best of the Fest\" at the Sarasota Film Festival. Scene Magazine said of AXIS, \"the directorial debut of Aisha Tyler is a revelation... brilliant in every way.\" And Paste Magazine wrote: \"to make a film this experimental, this compelling, your first time out as a director is just extraordinary.\" AXIS was released wide in 2018 and is available everywhere on multiple VOD platforms.\n\nAisha has directed several episodes of television, including Fear the Walking Dead (2015), Roswell, New Mexico (2019), and Criminal Minds (2005), where she made her television directing debut.
