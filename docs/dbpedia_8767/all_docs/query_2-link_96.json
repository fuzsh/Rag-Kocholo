        "text": "A Mountain Estate Airpark....Like No Place On EARTH!\n\nWelcome to Heavens Landing, the most unique and beautiful Mountain Estate Airpark in the world. Located three miles northwest of the City of Clayton, Heavens Landing is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northeast Georgia.\n\nHeavens Landing is a 639 acre gated community surrounded by thousands of acres of National Forest, but uniquely located only minutes from downtown convenience. . The aviation centerpiece of Heavens Landing is a 5,200 foot paved concrete runway with an FAA certified GPS approach and pilot controlled lighting. The runway is designed to accommodate most any private aircraft, but is exclusively used by community members and guests only. Four hundred estate sized lots with heavenly views encircle the landing strip. Check out Heaven's Landing's featured videos here.\n\nA short minute drive from Heavens Landing to downtown Clayton Ga provides for a multitude of area amenities in a home town atmosphere that includes four of the \"Top 100\" rated restaurants in the United States. Rabun County was also recently named the \"Farm to Table Capital of Georgia\". Great food is plentiful and shopping is abundant, yet big city traffic is never an issue.\n\nThe climate at Heavens Landing features a perfect balance of all four seasons.

Fall colors are breathtaking, and Winter at Heavens Landing is most always mild.

However, many of our property owners opt for one of our spectacular mountain vista lots as a desirable alternative. In order to accommodate housing the aircraft belonging to our non-taxiway residents, we have an exquisitely designed hangar facility located adjacent to the runway. All hangars feature standing seam roofing, bi-fold doors, bathroom facilities, and windows that aesthetically cause these hangars to look nothing like hangars at all!\n\nHeavens Landing is a one stop fly-in community as well. With some of the lowest priced 100LL and Jet A fuel in the country, there is rarely a need for an intermittent stop in route to your destination.

This partnership officially establishes a Heavens Landing Beachfront Outpost at a highly exclusive private ocean side resort with a Greg Norman Signature Golf Course! No other residential fly-in community in the world offers anything close, and amazing destinations like this are the essence of why all of us love to fly!
