        "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - The mainstream college football recruiting world doesn’t know the name Elijah Haven right now but it will very soon. A star is emerging in Baton Rouge, Louisiana at Dunham High School. The same program that produced former five-star recruit Derek Stingley Jr. figures to pump out another blue chipper in Haven, a rising sophomore.\n\nThe two-sport athlete exploded in his first year as the starting quarterback with the Tigers. Dunham won a district title and earned a first-round bye in the playoffs before falling in a thriller to Parkview Baptist 39-32. Haven had a lot of success as a rookie but he expected that from himself.\n\n“I hold myself to a high expectation and all the hard work we put in throughout the summer, throughout the spring it just paid off in the fall,” Haven said.\n\nSeveral division-one programs took notice of the success. Haven has already received offers from Florida, Ole Miss, Miami, and Texas Tech. LSU’s recently promoted offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Sloan was seen at one of his basketball games. It seems the Tigers are interested in the Class of 2027 star.\n\n“I’ve definitely been in contact with LSU and Coach Sloan, definitely having a relationship with them in the future for sure,” Haven said. “He’s not fast to recruit (Sloan), he really wants to build a relationship with me and I really appreciate that. He just wants to get to know me for me.”\n\nThe interest is mutual too, Haven has game that’s very comparable to LSU quarterback and recent Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels, the two even rock the same number five uniform. Haven had some intriguing things to say about the program and a school he’s particularly hoping to play for in the future potentially.\n\n“For football, I’d definitely say LSU, I want to play for my hometown if the opportunity presents itself for sure,” Haven said.\n\nFor more on Haven’s recruitment, points of improvement in 2024, and much more check out the full interview above or on YouTube!\n\nClick here to report a typo."
