        "text": "New Haven, city, coextensive with the town (township) of New Haven, New Haven county, south-central Connecticut, U.S. It is a port on Long Island Sound at the Quinnipiac River mouth. Originally settled as Quinnipiac in 1638 by a company of English Puritans led by John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton, it was renamed in 1640, probably for Newhaven, England. In 1643 it combined with several adjacent towns, including Milford and Guilford, to form the New Haven colony, of which Eaton was governor until his death in 1658. In 1665 New Haven colony reluctantly accepted absorption into the more liberal and democratic Connecticut colony, which was based in Hartford and enjoyed a royal charter. From 1701 New Haven was co-capital with Hartford, a position it maintained in both colony and state until 1875. During the American Revolution it was sacked (July 5, 1779) by loyalist forces under Major General William Tryon. The town was an important centre of abolitionist sentiment during the American Civil War.\n\nNew Haven’s historical preeminence in many industrial fields is manifest in the number of inventions that first appeared in the area. These include Eli Whitney’s mass-production technique (Hamden), Charles Goodyear’s vulcanized rubber (Naugatuck), Samuel Colt’s improved repeating revolver (Hamden), and sulfur matches (Woodbridge). The Winchester repeating rifle (the gun that “tamed the West”) was made in New Haven. Diversified manufacturing, educational services, and shipping are the modern economic mainstays. In 1957 New Haven was one of the first Eastern cities to undertake wholesale urban renewal of its decaying downtown area. Nonetheless, the neighbourhoods surrounding New Haven’s downtown core remained run-down in the late 20th century and had such inner-city problems as unemployment, drugs, and crime."
