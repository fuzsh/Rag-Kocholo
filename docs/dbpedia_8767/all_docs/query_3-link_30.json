        "text": "BELLEFONTE — Historic Bellefonte, Inc., recently announced the fifth round of Hometown Hero Banners.\n\nSince the program began in 2015, hundreds of Hometown Heroes have been honored by placing a banner on display throughout downtown Bellefonte.\n\nThe Hometown Hero Committee is offering yet another chance this year for the community to honor our heroes — military veterans and first responders — by purchasing a Hometown Hero Banner that will be displayed in town for the next two years beginning this fall.\n\nCurrent banners hanging will be taken down in the fall and returned to the sponsor. More information will be sent to the current sponsors with a time and place to pick up the banners currently being displayed.\n\nTo purchase a banner to honor your Hometown Hero, an application will need to be completed with the name and information of the veteran or first responder, accompanied by their photograph to be used on the banner and a payment check for $200 before the July 31 deadline.\n\nHometown Hero applications and additional information can be found at www.bellefonte.net.\n\nPayment checks should be made payable to Historic Bellefonte, Inc., and may be dropped off at the Bellefonte Train Station or mailed to the Bellefonte Train Station, 320 W. High St., Bellefonte, PA 16823 to ensure they are received before the July 31 deadline."
