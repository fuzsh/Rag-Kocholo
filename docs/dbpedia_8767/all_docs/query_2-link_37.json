        "text": "There’s no limit to what you can do here. If you’re passionate about it, you can study it. As a Husky, we’ll help you develop a personalized academic plan to keep you on track to graduate and land a job before even walking the commencement stage. Among Bloomsburg’s most popular and unique programs: speech-language pathology and audiology, nursing; digital forensics and cybersecurity, American Sign Language (ASL) and English interpreting, media and journalism; special education; professional sales and marketing, and international business.\n\nMore than 3,500 students call campus home, living among seven residence halls, three apartment complexes, and a sweet suite-style complex — all within steps of dining options, available recreation, and picturesque views. An added perk and unique value to the Husky experience are our learning communities, where students with similar majors, interests, and life goals participate in a variety of programs and field trips, take a cluster of classes together, and navigate their first year of college under the guidance of upperclass mentors. No matter where you come from — the city or a small town — you’ll find your niche here ... and your crew, your “Bloom people.”\n\nFace it, you got to eat. And we’ll deliver — not literally — but being ranked by Niche as the #10 Best College Food in Pennsylvania gives us the cred to do just that. It all starts with our flagship all-you-care-to-eat dining facility, the Scranton Commons. On upper campus? We got you covered at Monty’s, a cafe-style spot with a view popular with our student-athletes but a nice change of pace for all. No time to sit and chat? Then it’s to the Husky Lounge for overstuffed wraps, fresh bagels, and made-from-scratch soups. And when you’re really on the go, there’s always Qdoba, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Bento Sushi, Starbucks, and Dunkin Donuts. Yes, we have both — Dunkin and Starbucks!\n\nAt Bloomsburg, we’re working to improve our lives — and at the same time — lift others up. We take charge and get to work. We get involved and get things done. It’s in our nature as Huskies. The opportunities are here for the taking: volunteer on and off campus or join a club or two. We have 225-plus to choose from! Have a new one in mind? You can even start your own. Compete or cheer on your friends in intramural basketball, ultimate Frisbee, or sand volleyball. Or take it to the next level with club sports, such as ice hockey and rugby. Impact the community through The Big Event with the Community Government Association or help run the biggest Relay for Life event in the area with Colleges Against Cancer.\n\nYou’ll find ample opportunities at Bloomsburg for all levels of fitness and athletic ability — including playing on or cheering for one of 23 intercollegiate athletics programs. Get competitive or go the recreational route. Whatever your choice, you’ll be ahead of the game running with pack. Stay active at the Student Rec Center where you’ll find an impressive array of strength and cardio equipment, fitness classes like yoga and Zumba, rock-climbing walls, an indoor track, a CrossFit space, and multi-purpose courts. Get in the game by testing your mettle during intramural competition (including Esports) or step up and square off against our rivals as a member of a club team, such as men’s and women’s rugby, ice hockey, and Ultimate Frisbee. Be adventurous through Quest, our outdoor adventure and leadership program that offers exciting outdoor and educational courses throughout the United States."
