The idea is to serve the community by giving citizens from the area a chance to conveniently and safely drop these recyclables, and to provide information about services to the public as well.\n\nNeighborhood residents, students and all New Haveners can bring their unwanted or broken electronic devices (t.v.'s, monitors, computers, phones, printers, wires, etc.), mattresses and box springs, and textiles (clothing, shoes, linens, handbags, belts and accessories) for recycling.\n\nSaturday, October 24, 9am â€“ 2pm\n\nTruman School, 114 Truman St., New Haven\n\n(Entrance: Washington Ave. at Barclay St.)\n\nWHAT YOU CAN BRING:\n\nELECTRONICS (TVs, cell phones, monitors, stereos, printers and wires)\n\nMATTRESSES and BOX SPRINGS (in decent condition, no bugs or mold, dry)\n\nTEXTILES (clothing, shoes, belts, hats, handbags) (dry and in plastic bags)\n\nRECHARGEABLE BATTERIES\n\nDOCUMENTS (sensitive papers to be shredded)\n\nThe Facts: Did you know that only 30% of the current amount of waste in CT is recycled, reused or reduced?\n\nIn the U.S., only 12% of unused electronics are recycled. Only 15% of unwanted textiles (clothing, etc.) are recycled. And 50,000 mattresses are discarded every day. YOU can help change all of this AND get rid of your unwanted items at no charge, on Saturday, October 24th!"
