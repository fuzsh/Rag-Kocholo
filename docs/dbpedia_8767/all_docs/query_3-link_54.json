        "text": "Introducing Hometown Hearts – A New Romance Line Celebrating the Power of Community and Second Chances\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of Hometown Hearts, a heartwarming new romance publishing line from Sunrise Publishing. Slated to debut in 2025, the Hometown Hearts line will transport readers to the quaint shores of Jonathon Island, a picturesque lakeside town off the coast of Michigan.\n\nEach season of Hometown Hearts will center around a specific romance theme, kicking off in 2025 with a focus on “Restoration.” Spanning approximately 60,000 words, these binge-worthy tales will explore the journeys of characters rediscovering love, purpose, and their connection to community.\n\n“Hometown Hearts is a labor of love that celebrates the powerful pull of small-town life and the profound impact of second chances,” said Lindsay Harrel, Line Producer for the series. “As readers join these characters in rebuilding their lives and relationships, we hope they’ll be inspired by the warmth, resilience, and faith that can be found in the most unexpected places.”\n\nHeading up the Hometown Hearts line is acclaimed romance author and editor Lisa Jordan. With a passion for crafting uplifting, character-driven stories, Lisa will work closely with a talented team of writers to bring the island of Jonathon and its residents to vivid life.\n\n“There’s something so special about the way a tight-knit community can lift you up, even in your darkest moments,” said Lisa Jordan, Line Director. “The Hometown Hearts series will celebrate that sense of belonging, whether it’s a homecoming, a second chance at love, or the power of redemption. I can’t wait for readers to fall in love with these stories and characters.”\n\nIt’s with pleasure that we announce our talented and innovative Jonathon Island authors—Lindsay Harrel, Andrea Christenson, Christen Krumm, Rachel D. Russell, Lisa Jordan, and Sarah May Warren."
