The demands of active addiction, working as a nurse, and having a young family had me stretched out thin. When my job intervened and I was referred to HAVEN, I thought it was the end. Looking back, it was the beginning. I am grateful that I had the chance to participate in the HAVEN program. My family got the real me back. I am proud of how I am living today. I am happy! The HAVEN program gave me the anonymity and the structure that has set me on my sober path!”\n\n“I celebrate my sobriety and I feel like my healing in my mind , body and spirit has started my path to forgiveness of myself. I have HAVEN to thank for this and will always be grateful!! Thank you HAVEN.”"
