Yale is a remarkable urology residency program in the northeast that provides excellent training in all of the subspecialties of urology. The program is designed to make you become the best possible urologist you can be. The residents in the residency program are down-to-earth, fun-loving, and a motivated group of individuals. This allows us to get residency work done in a relatively stress-free and enjoyable environment.\n\nWhy New Haven? New Haven is a blend of an urban city along with a residential town, allowing you to feel comfortable without becoming overwhelmed. It brings the convenience of a city along with the calmness and familiarity of a town. From all the places I have lived, New Haven has the best food scene I have experienced. Cost of living is very affordable. The culture and history of the undergraduate campus adds an extra flair to the place. If you drive 10 minutes in one direction, you’ll reach amazing hikes, while driving 10 minutes in the opposite direction will bring coastal beaches.\n\nRandom fact: I like to dance Bollywood.\n\nHometown: Owensboro, Kentucky\n\nUndergrad: University of Kentucky (Go Cats!)\n\nHobbies: golf, hiking, traveling with my wife, playing cards, financial literacy\n\nSpecialty Interests/Career Plan: Complex stone disease and BPH management\n\nWhy Yale? Yale Urology has a unique blend of excellent clinical volume, multiple training sites, a wide array of opportunities for clinical research, and a supportive training environment. I am most proud of our resident culture. We support and look out for each other. The attendings here are also very approachable. As someone who had never lived outside of their home state (Kentucky), I quickly felt at home here at Yale and am very thankful for the opportunity to train here.\n\nWhy New Haven? New Haven is an awesome place to live during residency training. First, the city is affordable. The restaurant scene is great for a city of its size. From Yale museums to events put on by the city of New Haven, there is always something to do. Additionally, the city is very close to Boston and NYC. Whether you take the train or drive by car, it is easy to make a weekend trip to multiple locations on the Northeastern seaboard.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology? Consulting\n\nRandom fact: I am learning to play the banjo.\n\nHometown: Roslyn, NY\n\nUndergrad: NYU\n\nHobbies: avid binge watcher, anime, gym\n\nSpecialty Interests/Career Plan: Urologic Oncology\n\nWhy Yale? Yale provided the sense of family and community I was looking for in a program.\n\nWhy New Haven? New Haven has that New England charm, while not being super far from NYC. I’ve never lived outside of NY, and New Haven was perfect because it’s not far from all my friends and family.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology? Research\n\nRandom fact: I’m naturally nocturnal and drink 3 Bang energy drinks a day.\n\nHometown: Sacramento, CA\n\nUndergrad: UC Berkeley\n\nHobbies: Hiking, rock climbing, scuba diving, ultimate frisbee, anime, mixology, travel\n\nSpecialty Interests/Career Plan: Currently considering general urology or andrology; also plan to stay involved in the healthcare innovation space\n\nWhy Yale?: Great mix of clinical settings, excellent surgical volume (robotic vs open vs endoscopic), early operative experience, all subspecialties well-represented\n\nWhy New Haven?: Having lived in California most of my life, New Haven initially took some getting used to — but the abundance and diversity of food options, eclectic neighborhoods, bustling college-town feel, and proximity to NYC/Boston have made it a wonderful place to call home.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology?: Adventure photography, writing a travel/food column for the NYT, working at a digital health startup\n\nRandom fact: I once visited the Icelandic Phallological Museum\n\nHometown: Cheshire, Connecticut\n\nUndergrad: University of Connecticut\n\nHobbies: Culinary arts, hiking, running/cycling, traveling to new places (mainly for food)\n\nSpecialty Interests/Career Plan: I have a very open mind when thinking about urologic subspecialties, however, currently I am interested in pediatric and reconstructive urology.\n\nWhy Yale? Yale Urology covers the full breadth of urology offering residents experience in all sub-specialties of urology. Over the years, Yale Urology has consistently matched residents into various fellowships and private practice jobs throughout the country giving me confidence that I can truly pursue any route that interests me. In addition, mentorship and research opportunities are available in abundance. The emphasis placed on work-life balance by faculty and the residency overall is yet another reason why I chose to join the Yale Urology family.\n\nWhy New Haven? Growing up just 20 minutes north of New Haven, I have always loved the many apizza options. However, as I explore New Haven more during residency I am realizing how much more the city has to offer. The food scene is ever-growing, the music and theater offerings are numerous, and the local hikes and outdoor activities are endless.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology?

While doing my sub-I, I was struck by how welcoming and educational the entire program was, from interns to attendings. There is an excellent diversity of cases and attending specialties, and excellent autonomy, particularly as compared to other northeast programs.\n\nWhy New Haven? New Haven is a small city that punches way above its weight culturally and in the culinary world. There are cool museums, excellent restaurants (and new ones opening regularly), and good concerts. The downtown is easily walkable. With our salaries and the cost of living, you can easily enjoy all those things too.\n\nOn top of that, New York is a quick train ride from downtown, Boston a quick Amtrak ride. You can be in Vermont, New Hampshire, or large cities easily enough for a quick weekend trip, and with the New Haven airport (10 minutes from downtown) you can easily go anywhere on the east coast.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology?

My first experience with Yale Urology was during my surgery clerkship rotation. I was amazed by the warmth, kindness, and mutual respect between faculty, residents, and staff. I laughed the most I had ever laughed in medical school during that rotation. As a resident, I truly enjoy spending time with my co-residents, we all support each other. The surgical training here is top notch, we get early exposure to every sub-specialty in urology. I am confident that I will be a well-rounded urologist at the end of my training here.\n\nWhy New Haven? I have lived in several cities, and New Haven is my favorite so far. It’s a small town with a lot of charm. There hasn’t been anything I wanted to do that I haven’t been able to do here. The proximity to major cities and New England tourist attractions is also a major plus. I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I’ve loved having 4 seasons, fall and spring seasons are gorgeous here!\n\nNew Haven: I’m excited about all the new food spots opening up in and around New Haven and exploring New England as much as residency schedule allows.\n\nWhat would you be doing if not urology?
