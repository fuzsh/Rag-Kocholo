        "text": "Program Director, Recruitment | andrea.flores@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Miami, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S.

From the first day I stepped onto FSU's campus, I felt at home. Whether it was just a simple wave as I crossed paths with another student, new friends inviting me into a study group in the library, or how helpful and courteous faculty and staff were, I knew I had found somewhere special!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Live on campus if you can! It will help you meet people, get connected across campus, and help ease the transition into college.\n\nAdmissions Counselor | sbuxbaum@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Little Rock, AR\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.A. (English); M.S.

From the red brick to the Spanish moss, it's nice to just find a quiet spot on campus and soak it all in every once in a while!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Document your college journey! Take lots of pictures, save that ticket stub from your favorite football game, and create a memory box with tokens from all your favorite college memories.\n\nProgram Manager, Scholarships | hclayton@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Perry, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S.

There is no judgment or imperfections, just improvements that can contribute to one's personal growth.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: You will be discovering and experiencing many new things about the world around you and yourself. It is an exciting time and a new adventure. Enter this experience with an open mind; if you come into this new experience with hopefulness and a positive attitude, your experience will be a lot more rewarding.\n\nAdmissions Counselor | csalinas@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: West Palm Beach, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S. (Social Science Education)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Coming from a fast paced town, everything is calmer and cozier. In addition, all the beautiful greenery. Tallahassee has so many beautiful parks that allow you to immerse yourself with nature. And finally, being able to experience seasonal changes is something that I did not experience in South Florida.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: What I enjoy the most about FSU is how much FSU cares about students. There is always something for everyone to participate in or join. Not only that, FSU wants their students to succeed in every aspect of their college careers. They offer plenty of resources and help for students to use to make sure they are getting the best of their college experience.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, it may feel uncomfortable but you never know when a great opportunity might present itself.\n\nAdmissions Counselor | cearthur@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Orlando, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee is one of those rare places that instantly feels like home no matter how far you have travelled or how long you've been here. Every person you meet is welcoming and kind and wants to show you the often-unnoticed beauty in every aspect of this city.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: I love the culture of this university and how contagious everyone's love for Florida State is. Whether it is through academics, athletics, or research, there is something every single person has an unwavering passion for, and they would love to help you in gaining that same passion. Personally, I love going to FSU football games to really see everyone showcase their passion for Florida State loudly and proudly!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Get involved with something you never thought you would enjoy. There are hundreds of student organizations that cover a vast variety of interests that maybe you haven't even considered, and getting involved with an unfamiliar one may lead you to a group of new friends and experiences you will never forget!\n\nAdmissions Counselor | smturner@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Gray, TN\n\nDegrees: University of Pennsylvania, B.A. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: I love the feel of Tallahassee, it feels like a small town but has so much to do. I also am from the smoky mountains, so I love being in a wooded area but only a short drive to a beach\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: The School Spirit from students, alumni, and the surrounding community. I grew up to be a sports fan and there is nothing like being at a school where everyone feels school spirit and goes to all the sports games. I also love that at FSU, it's not just a football school, here, all of the sports are widely attended and cheered for.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Don't hesitate to take a chance that might seem small like joining a club or taking an internship that is out of your comfort zone. I found my two passions- higher education and sports photography- by taking opportunities that didn't align with what I ended up going to school for. Both of those opportunities changed the direction of my life. So even if its just a small organization or job that you only spend a few hours a week or something that is larger, take a leap with something new at FSU. You may just find a new passion.\n\nAssistant Director | c.wood@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Valdosta, GA\n\nDegrees: Valdosta State University, B.A. (History)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: Tallahassee is a haven for foodies, there are so many different options to choose from when it comes to food.

Florida State has so many options to help you broaden your horizons, take advantage of attending a campus rich with opportunities! You never know when you'll discover a new passion or hobby.\n\nAdmissions Counselor | hgodfrey@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Orlando, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S. (Psychology)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: I love how unique the city of Tallahassee is, blending historic landmarks, modern architecture, and lush green spaces. With the capitol, extensive parks and trails, and vibrant art scenes, every street in Tallahassee promises a distinct experience.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: FSU felt like home from the moment I stepped onto campus. Our emphasis on traditions and community makes our school one of a kind. The school spirit within the community extends beyond sports and into our research, student organizations, and academics. For me, few things were more special than waking up on campus for the first home football game. Experiencing the War Chant echoing through campus and witnessing locals, students, faculty, and alumni alike show their support for FSU is something I wish everyone could experience.\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Take advantage of everything our campus has to offer and fully immerse yourself into the experience. Outside of student organizations, there are always events happening on/around campus that provide students with an opportunity to meet new people, engage in fun activities, and even learn new skills. Take every opportunity to explore yourself and allow yourself to step outside of your comfort zone. These years provide a once in a lifetime opportunity, enjoy them!\n\nAdmissions Counselor | aaalvarez@fsu.edu\n\nHometown: Miami, FL\n\nDegrees: Florida State University, B.S (Political Science)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: The food!

(Human Development and Family Sciences)\n\nMy favorite thing about Tallahassee: As a local I've always had a love for Tallahassee for many reasons. There are many parks to explore including Tom brown park and Piney Z, which has a great walking trail my mom and I love to go on! Tallahassee also offers lots of variety. While FSU brings a vibrant energy into the city (especially during football season!), you can easily escape to a \"small town vibe\" within a 10-minute drive. Above all, the kindness of its people and the sense of community make Tallahassee truly special.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about FSU: The environment here is truly unique. Whether inside the classroom or out, there's a genuine desire for your success. You will find support in every aspect of your college experience. FSU quickly feels like home, and the campus itself is stunning!\n\nMy advice for future Seminoles: Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Even now, I'm discovering events, resources, and activities on campus that I wish I had known about earlier. You might be pleasantly surprised. Every experience you have is an opportunity to learn.
