        "text": "25. Hudson, New York\n\nMillionaire households: 1,810\n\nTotal households: 25,243\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.2%\n\nMedian income for all households: $63,032 (U.S.: $61,937)\n\nMedian home value: $231,100 (U.S.: $229,700)\n\nThe Hudson, New York, micro area has emerged as an upstate hidey-hole for the well-heeled. Roughly 35 miles south of the state capital of Albany, the area abuts the banks of – you guessed it – the Hudson River. Water views, rolling hills and a verdant landscape (at least in the warmer months) make for many an idyllic scene.\n\nHudson has become popular with millionaires and non-millionaires alike thanks to its myriad restaurants, art galleries and nightlife. But the town's signature draws are antiques and architecture.\n\nHudson boasts scores of antiques dealers, which led the charge in making the town attractive for new residents, tourists and wealthier folks in search of second homes. At the same time, Hudson is chockablock with architectural gems. The Hudson Historic District is listed with the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nUnfortunately for millionaires and folks of lesser means, New York State taxes take a bite. Hefty income taxes and high property taxes make the Empire State one of Kiplinger's 10 least tax-friendly states.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n24. Laconia, New Hampshire\n\nMillionaire households: 1,840\n\nTotal households: 24,739\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.2%\n\nMedian income for all households: $68,368\n\nMedian home value: $222,300\n\nIf your ideal summer retreat is a lakeside getaway, you could hardly do better than Laconia. The area sits between Lake Winnisquam and Lake Winnipesaukee in the middle of New Hampshire's famed Lakes Region.\n\nAnd, unlike more rural parts of the vacation wonderland, Laconia is just a few miles off Interstate 93. That makes for easy access to the White Mountain National Forest about 30 miles to the north. More importantly, it makes Laconia a relatively easy drive from points farther south where millionaires maintain their primary residences.\n\nIt also helps that New Hampshire is a relatively tax-friendly state. As we shall see, another area near Laconia makes this list of small towns with a high percentage of millionaires.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n23. Claremont-Lebanon, New Hampshire/Vermont\n\nMillionaire households: 6,675\n\nTotal households: 90,652\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.3%\n\nMedian income for all households: $61,558\n\nMedian home value: $216,800\n\nThe Claremont-Lebanon micro area abuts Laconia and has plenty of its own attractions, as well. Perhaps best known is Hanover, N.H., which forms the northern tip of this urban agglomeration.\n\nLocated along the Connecticut River bordering Vermont, this 50-square-mile town in the Upper Valley is home to Dartmouth College, the smallest of the eight Ivy League colleges. As a result, Hanover buzzes with a diverse mix of art, culture and outdoor sporting and recreational activities year-round.\n\nAnother attractive aspect of the area is that the City of Lebanon operates Storrs Hill, a 20-acre ski area that hosts three ski trails, two ski jumps, a surface lift and ski lodge. As residents like to point out, few towns have a groomed ski area right in their downtown that is accessible to all.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n22. Steamboat Springs, Colorado\n\nMillionaire households: 818\n\nTotal households: 9,552\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.4%\n\nMedian income for all households: $74,273\n\nMedian home value: $510,600\n\nSkiing, duh.\n\nWhen folks think of Steamboat Springs, its reputation as one of the best ski resort towns in the world is likely what first comes to mind. But the area offers a wealth of outdoor fun year-round. Thanks to its location on the Yampa river, Steamboat Springs is perfect for fishing, rafting, tubing and kayaking. The rugged mountain terrain is ideal for hiking, mountain biking, camping, you name it. It also has a trio of 18-hole golf courses.\n\nMillionaires building second homes in the Steamboat Springs area have done more to push up house prices than wages. Although median income in the micro area is roughly $12,000 above than the national level, median home value beats the U.S. median by a whopping $280,900.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n21. Faribault-Northfield, Minnesota\n\nMillionaire households: 1,766\n\nTotal households: 23,358\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.5%\n\nMedian income for all households: $65,839\n\nMedian home value: $218,100\n\nThe Faribault-Northfield area is so desirable that Kiplinger has named it a great place to retire. The Cannon River runs through town, and several parks and walking paths provide access to fishing, canoeing and kayaking.\n\nFitness buffs have plenty of options: In the snowy Minnesota winter, you can cross-country ski along miles of groomed trails or snowshoe through Carleton's Cowling Arboretum. Too cold outdoors? Run, swim or take exercise classes at the YMCA Community Center. No need to worry about health care, either. If you need access to specialists not available at Northfield Hospital & Clinics, the Mayo Clinic is about 60 miles away, in Rochester.\n\nOn the downside, Minnesota is not a friendly state when it comes to taxes. The North Star State hits hard with income tax and property taxes are on the high side, too.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n20. Gardnerville Ranchos, Nevada\n\nMillionaire households: 1,562\n\nTotal households: 20,579\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.5%\n\nMedian income for all households: $62,503\n\nMedian home value: $346,500\n\nGardnerville Ranchos is a favorite hiding place for millionaires because of its proximity to Lake Tahoe, which has long been a getaway for the rich and famous. With everything from ski resorts to beaches, the Lake Tahoe area offers year-round activities for well-heeled tourists and full-time residents alike.\n\nCarson City, capital of the Silver State, is just 20 miles to the north of Gardnerville Ranchos, and high rollers can reach Reno's casinos in an hour.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n19. Glenwood Springs, Colorado\n\nMillionaire households: 2,263\n\nTotal households: 26,357\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.6%\n\nMedian income for all households: $76,184\n\nMedian home value: $383,300\n\nIt's easy to see why Glenwood Springs is popular with millionaires. The small resort city about 160 miles west of Denver is loaded with fun stuff to do – and not just in winter, when skiing is the main attraction in the Colorado Rockies. Hot springs, rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking, mountain biking and golf, among many other activities, make Glenwood Springs a year-round destination.\n\nThe city's great appeal is no secret. Glenwood Springs has collected many accolades over the years. It has ranked in the top five of Outside magazine's best places to live in America, and Southern Methodist University once named it the \"Most Vibrant Small Town Arts Environment in the United States.\"\n\nSponsored Content\n\n18. Dickinson, North Dakota\n\nMillionaire households: 985\n\nTotal households: 12,150\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.6%\n\nMedian income for all households: $75,708\n\nMedian home value: $238,100\n\nThe boom times looked to be rolling again in North Dakota until COVID-19 gutted oil demand. Indeed, benchmark U.S. crude oil is off about 35% over the past year.\n\nIn the first half of the 2010s, North Dakota had the fastest-growing economy in the nation, thanks to the explosion in shale oil drilling. Places like Dickinson, located in the oil-rich Bakken Formation, were mining millionaires. Then oil prices collapsed in 2014 and some folks even started pulling up stakes. By the end of the last decade, fortunes were once again looking up, but that came to a halt with the coronavirus.\n\nDickinson's number and percentage of millionaire households declined year-over-year.\n\nIf there's a silver lining, it's that North Dakota is one of the nation's more tax-friendly states. Indeed, it has been cutting income taxes for several years in a row – to the point that they barely exist.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n17. Oak Harbor, Washington\n\nMillionaire households: 2,839\n\nTotal households: 34,572\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.9%\n\nMedian income for all households: $64,793\n\nMedian home value: $392,500\n\nThe Oak Harbor, Washington, micro area actually encompasses all of Whidbey Island. That helps explain its inclusion on the list of small towns with high concentrations of millionaires.\n\n\"Oak Harbor is usually regarded as the poorer but more developed stepsister when compared to other Whidbey municipalities,\" notes the Whidbey News-Times. \"Coupeville and Langley have higher incomes, swankier homes and older residents.\" Oak Harbor itself plays host to nearby Naval Air Station Whidbey Island.\n\nHappily for residents, Washington is among the most friendly states for taxes. The Evergreen State makes the cut because it doesn't have an income tax. Unfortunately, some of the other state and local taxes aren't quite so taxpayer-friendly.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n16. Elko, Nevada\n\nMillionaire households: 1,589\n\nTotal households: 18,438\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 7.9%\n\nMedian income for all households: $77,222\n\nMedian home value: $197,700\n\nTiny Elko, Nevada, owes its high concentration of millionaires to its status as the capital of Nevada's gold mining industry.\n\nAlthough gold mining is no longer much of a growth area, pulling the yellow metal from the ground does remain a productive endeavor. Indeed, if Nevada were a country, it would be the world's fourth-largest producer of gold behind China, Australia and Russia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nElko's fortunes rise and fall with the price of gold, so one would hope that its millionaire population is properly diversified. Happily, for all of Elko's residents, Nevada is a no-income-tax haven, and one of Kiplinger's top 10 most tax-friendly states.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n15. Concord, New Hampshire\n\nMillionaire households: 4,716\n\nTotal households: 58,521\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.0%\n\nMedian income for all households: $75,088\n\nMedian home value: $239,100\n\nThe New Hampshire state capital is home to a horde of state, county, local and federal agencies – and the law firms and professional agencies that support them.\n\nConcord also is a major distribution, industrial and transportation hub. Tourism is a key contributor to the local economy, thanks to the nearby New Hampshire International Speedway, as is the state's increasing emergence as a center of high-tech manufacturing.\n\nConcord also benefits from being within easy reach of Laconia and the state's famed Lakes Region, as noted earlier. Residents seeking a break from quaint New England living can drive to Boston in less than 90 minutes.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n14. Truckee-Grass Valley, Calif.\n\nMillionaire households: 3,448\n\nTotal households: 41,447\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.0%\n\nMedian income for all households: $66,299\n\nMedian home value: $456,000\n\nYou'll find the Truckee-Grass Valley area on the California side of Lake Tahoe, with Truckee proper situated near the shore of the famed lake itself and Grass Valley sitting farther to the west.\n\nMultiple bodies of water including Donner Lake, where the Donner Party met its gruesome demise, make the entire area a recreational haven for water sports. And the long, snowy winters are perfect for the numerous ski resorts in the vicinity of Truckee and Grass Valley.\n\nAnother appealing aspect of the area for millionaires: It's a straight shot down Interstate 80 to reach Sacramento, the state capital, and San Francisco.\n\nThe Golden State's reputation as a high-tax destination is built in part on how aggressively it goes after big earners, with a 13.3% tax rate that kicks in at $1 million (for single filers) of taxable income. But for more modest incomes, the impact is far milder, and property taxes are low.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n13. Key West, Florida\n\nMillionaire households: 2,867\n\nTotal households: 31,362\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.1%\n\nMedian income for all households: $71,973\n\nMedian home value: $541,900\n\nThe appeal of Key West to millionaires – and heck, everyone – is pretty self-evident. The sun-kissed island and nearby neighbors offer a tropical paradise in the good ol' U.S. of A.\n\nThe allures of the Key West area are well known. Boating, fishing, snorkeling, scuba diving and lazing on the beach are just some of Key West's draws. And don't forget the incomparable sunsets.\n\nLike all Floridians, Key West's millionaires save a bundle on taxes. The Sunshine State is well known for its absence of a state income tax, which helps make it one of Kiplinger's 10 most tax-friendly states.\n\n13 Best Vanguard Funds for the Next Bull Market\n\nSponsored Content\n\n12. Kapaa, Hawaii\n\nMillionaire households: 2,118\n\nTotal households: 22,685\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.3%\n\nMedian income for all households: $80,921\n\nMedian home value: $627,800\n\nThe Kapaa micropolitan area includes the entirety of Kauai, Hawaii's fourth-largest island.\n\nKnown as the Garden Island, Kauai is one of the state's less developed locales. With pristine beaches, lush forests, soaring mountains and relatively few people, Kapaa (and the surrounding area) is an ideal place for a millionaire's tropical island nest.\n\nThe downside? The Aloha State is known for its high cost of living – and a mixed picture when it comes to taxes. Be that as it may, property taxes as a percentage of home value are the lowest in the U.S.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n11. Breckenridge, Colorado\n\nMillionaire households: 1,137\n\nTotal households: 9,707\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.5%\n\nMedian income for all households: $77,589\n\nMedian home value: $563,000\n\nBy this point in our list of small towns with the highest concentrations of millionaires, it should be clear that Western ski resort towns are mighty popular with people of means. (See below for yet even more examples.) So it should come as no surprise that Breckenridge would make the cut.\n\nNaturally, skiing is what first comes to mind when it comes to Breckenridge, but the area supports a wide range of sports and cultural activities through all four seasons. Mountain biking, hiking and fly fishing are just a few of the allures for the millionaire who likes the great outdoors.\n\nFor more sedentary folks, Breckenridge hosts the National Repertory Orchestra every summer and the Breckenridge Film Festival every autumn.\n\nSponsored Content\n\nJackson, Wyoming/Idaho\n\nMillionaire households: 1,236\n\nTotal households: 12,894\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.7%\n\nMedian income for all households: $78,452\n\nMedian home value: $563,100\n\nJackson is a town in Wyoming's famed Jackson Hole valley. The greater area we're talking about here spills over into Idaho, too, and includes Grand Teton National Park, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park and The Teton Wilderness Area.\n\nWith three major ski resorts and an abundance of other year-round recreational activities, it's easy to see the appeal for those with means.\n\nAnd thanks to abundant revenue that the state collects from oil and mineral rights, Wyoming millionaires shoulder one of the lowest tax burdens in the U.S. For those living in Idaho, the tax situation is a bit more mixed.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n9. Heber, Utah\n\nMillionaire households: 921\n\nTotal households: 9,567\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.7%\n\nMedian income for all households: $77,449\n\nMedian home value: $388,900\n\nHeber boasts world-class recreational activities for the wealthy and regular Joes alike. In winter, it's all about skiing. Five-star skiing at the Deer Valley and Sundance ski resorts is roughly a half-hour away. For year-round activities, the Heber Valley features five 18-hole championship golf courses, three state parks and a historic tourism railroad.\n\nThe micro area even holds a charming Swiss-themed village.\n\nFully 8.7% of Heber's 9,567 households have at least $1 million in investable assets. Median income is more than $15,000 above the national level. Median homes prices top the U.S. median by more than $159,000.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n8. Easton, Maryland\n\nMillionaire households: 1,412\n\nTotal households: 16,627\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 8.9%\n\nMedian income for all households: $67,204\n\nMedian home value: $331,500\n\nTiny Easton, on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, prides itself on its out-of-the-way feel, with country farms mixing with lavish waterfront estates. It has long been a retreat for the well-to-do of the Mid-Atlantic seeking antique shops and solitude. Easton's proximity to the beach, abundance of parks and good schools make for an idyllic small-town experience for residents.\n\nAt the same time, the town offers easy access to several major cities. It's less than an hour away from Annapolis, the state capital, while Washington, D.C., and Baltimore can be reached by car in about 90 minutes (traffic willing).\n\nMaryland has the second most millionaires per capita of any state in the U.S., according to Phoenix Marketing International, but it's unfriendly when it comes to taxes.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n7. Edwards, Colorado\n\nMillionaire households: 1,877\n\nTotal households: 17,750\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 9.2%\n\nMedian income for all households: $84,685\n\nMedian home value: $538,600\n\nYou can sum up the appeal of Edwards in one word: skiing.\n\nThe nearby world-class resorts of Vail and Beaver Creek draw big-spending skiers hoping to see and be seen all winter long. But the area offers much more than pricey lift tickets and celebrity spotting. Fly fishing, hiking and whitewater rafting draw folks to town in the summer months. High-end restaurants, plush lodges and spas are just some of the ways that millionaires can pamper themselves.\n\nBut it's Colorado's status as a tax-friendly state for both retirees and working residents that helps make Edwards a great deal for year-round living. It's a good thing, too, considering the high price of homes in the area.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n6. Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts\n\nMillionaire households: 736\n\nTotal households: 6,367\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 9.3%\n\nMedian income for all households: $71,224\n\nMedian home value: $667,400\n\nNo surprise here.\n\nVineyard Haven is a town on Martha's Vineyard. This island off the coast of Cape Cod – the Census Bureau classifies the entire island as part of the Vineyard Haven micro area – is one of the most desirable summer vacation spots in the Northeast and has long been a favorite of the rich, the famous and the powerful. Indeed, former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have summered there, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis long maintained a home on the island.\n\nNaturally, this tony locale is not easy on the wallet, as evidenced by the exorbitant real estate prices. It also can get a bit crowded. Martha's Vineyard has 17,000 or so year-round residents, but the population can swell to 200,000 during peak summer months.\n\nOn the plus side, Massachusetts' reputation as a high-tax state is overblown.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n5. Williston, North Dakota\n\nMillionaire households: 1,312\n\nTotal households: 13,695\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 9.4%\n\nMedian income for all households: $86,575\n\nMedian home value: $256,000\n\nThe city of Williston expanded rapidly during the first half of the 2010s, driven by the explosion in shale oil drilling that once gave North Dakota the fastest-growing economy in the nation. This city in the oil-rich Bakken Formation soon found itself home to fracking millionaires.\n\nBut as anyone who works in the oil patch knows, booms and busts are an integral part of the industry.\n\nA steep drop in oil prices first sparked pain across the Bakken about five years ago. And when demand finally started to improve, the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the energy sector. Demand for oil is gradually coming back, but it is by no means taking off.\n\nMore than 9% of Williston's households are considered to have millionaire status, but the absolute number of millionaire households actually declined from 2019.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n4. Torrington, Connecticut\n\nMillionaire households: 7,060\n\nTotal households: 73,598\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 9.5%\n\nMedian income for all households: $76,043\n\nMedian home value: $256,100\n\nTorrington is the largest town in Litchfield County, which has long been a popular retreat for Manhattan's wealthy and chic looking for a remote, mountainous retreat. (It's an in-state draw for all the millionaires from the Stamford area, too.)\n\nAs Vogue magazine has said of the area:\n\n\"There's something for everyone: art galleries, outdoor activities, shopping, great food. With its covered bridges, forests and rivers, the scenery is gorgeous. In fact, every season challenges the next for which is more beautiful.\"\n\nAlthough Torrington might be hidden in the northwest corner of the state, millionaires can't escape Connecticut's onerous tax bite. Real estate taxes are among the highest in the country, and the state has not only a luxury tax, but the country's only gift tax.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n3. Juneau, Alaska\n\nMillionaire households: 1,231\n\nTotal households: 12,521\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 9.7%\n\nMedian income for all households: $88,213\n\nMedian home value: $344,000\n\nEverything costs more in Juneau. Indeed, it's one of the more expensive cities in the U.S.\n\nChalk it up to the remote location of Alaska's capital, which is tucked away in the southeast corner of the state hard against the Canadian border. Groceries alone cost almost 40% more than the U.S. national average, according to the Council for Community and Economic Research's Cost of Living Index.\n\nAnd while it helps to be a millionaire to live in Juneau, it's increasingly difficult to become one. Much of Alaska's wealth is tied to the energy business. The 2014 slump in energy prices touched off the state's worst recession in three decades. And just when Alaska could see an end to the downturn, COVID-19 hammered the energy sector.\n\nOn the plus side, Alaska is one of the most tax-friendly states in the union. Not only is there no state income tax, but the government actually pays residents an annual stipend.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n2. Summit Park, Utah\n\nMillionaire households: 1,987\n\nTotal households: 14,555\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 13.0%\n\nMedian income for all households: $100,453\n\nMedian home value: $598,900\n\nSkiing, luxury shopping, world famous film festivals – the Summit Park, Utah, area has everything a millionaire could ask for and more.\n\nThe Summit Park micro area, which also includes Park City, is a short drive from Salt Lake City and has the second highest concentration of millionaire households of any small town in the U.S.\n\nThe aforementioned Park City, which hosts Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival, also boasts several world-class ski resorts.\n\nAs for taxes, millionaires could do worse. The Beehive State isn't as tax-friendly as it used to be. Sure, the loss of the federal personal exemption due to the new tax law means that many Utahns, particularly those with multiple dependents, will pay higher state taxes than before. But the state has a 4.95% flat income tax system, property taxes are low and sales taxes are average.\n\nSponsored Content\n\n1. Los Alamos, New Mexico\n\nMillionaire households: 1,107\n\nTotal households: 7,567\n\nConcentration of millionaires: 13.2%\n\nMedian income for all households: $115,248\n\nMedian home value: $292,200\n\nLos Alamos sounds like an unlikely place to find a lot of millionaires, but we're talking about the concentration of millionaire households, not the total number of millionaires. And on that relative basis, Los Alamos really stands out.\n\nThe tiny town about 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe is home to a government nuclear weapons laboratory and a number of chemists, engineers and physicists. It's a small area with a small population but a large percentage of highly educated and highly trained engineers and scientists.\n\nNew Mexico's personal income tax rates top out at 4.9% on taxable income over $16,000 for single filers and over $24,000 for married couples filing jointly. And, hang in there until you're 100 and your income taxes are waived altogether.\n\nProperty taxes are modest, but sales taxes lean high."
