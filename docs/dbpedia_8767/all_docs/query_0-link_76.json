        "text": "FORT KNOX, Ky. â€“ The remains of U.S. Army Sgt. Sam A. Prince, a Soldier killed during World War II, will be interred Aug. 8 at Lawn Haven Memorial Gardens, Clovis, New Mexico. Muffley Funeral Home will perform graveside services preceding the interment.\n\nA native of Clovis, Prince was a member of Headquarters Battery, 200th Coast Artillery Regiment, U.S. Army, when Japanese forces invaded the Philippine Islands in December 1941. He was among thousands of U.S. and Filipino service members who were captured, subjected to the 65-mile Bataan Death March, and interned at POW camps after U.S. forces fell to the Japanese. Prince died a prisoner of war Sept. 22, 1942, at age 28.\n\nHe was accounted for by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency April 25, 2024, after his remains were exhumed April 2019 from Manila American Cemetery and Memorial, Philippines, for laboratory analysis and identification.\n\nThe Past Conflict Repatriations Branch, under the Army Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Division at the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, Fort Knox, Kentucky, plays a key role in the process of locating Family members of missing Soldiers from WWII, the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nThe process begins with locating the Family member most closely related to the missing Soldier, known as the primary next of kin, followed by a request for Family reference samples or DNA, which are used as a main source in identifying remains.\n\nOnce a Soldier has been identified by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the PCRB notifies and briefs the Family about the results of historical, forensic and DNA reports, benefits and the mortuary process including burial with full military honors.\n\nFor additional information about Sgt. Prince go to: https://www.dpaa.mil/News-Stories/Press-Releases/PressReleaseArticleView/Article/3809467/soldier-accounted-for-from-wwii-prince-s/\n\nMedia interested in covering and/or obtaining more information about the funeral and interment should contact the Army Casualty Office at (800) 892-2490 and/or Muffley Funeral Home, 575-762-4435.\n\n-30-"
