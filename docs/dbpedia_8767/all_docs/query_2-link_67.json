        "text": "There are a lot of news stories going around right now, and it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle between our historically rainy summer, the Olympics and the presidential election. In an effort to put our slice of Minneapolis in the spotlight, I want to recap what’s happening, why it’s important and why I’m running for the Minnesota House in District 61A.\n\nWe live in a simultaneously exciting and potentially dangerous time. Representation may not be the end-all, but it matters. Like many of you, I was surprised to see President Joe Biden announce he’s no longer running for re-election. Also like many of you, I was ecstatic to hear Vice President Kamala Harris is the nominee to replace him. As a woman from India, it means so much to me to see that our next president could also be of South Asian descent. As a woman, I am only too happy to support other women, but it doesn’t stop there. Even more important is women supporting women of color, LGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities.\n\nIntersectionality is a core belief of mine, especially as a queer woman of color. It is a belief I promise to uphold and uplift as a state representative. It’s disappointing that we still haven’t passed the Equal Rights Amendment that women have been working on since the Nixon administration. It’s downright appalling when we see what little protections my friends have today. In Minnesota, I’m ready to take my experience from working in the House as staff, to pass the ERA right away this coming January, and cement protections for all women in Minnesota.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, we saw our democracy challenged in a way we haven’t seen or ever could have predicted. It is absolutely vital that we have free and fair elections, and that the results not be violently protested. I hold the endorsement of House Elections Chair Mike Freiberg, D-Golden Valley, and I know if elected I will be able to partner with him to find innovative solutions to protecting democracy, as well as ways to engage all voters. I’m proud of what Minnesota has accomplished in the arena of democracy, and I hope to be elected so I can actively further voter protections and accessibility. Never in our lives did most of us think our democracy would be threatened, and I will vociferously defend it as an elected official.\n\nI’m running to represent the Uptown area, the downtown area, and along the Chain of Lakes. Nowhere in Minneapolis, let alone Minnesota, is there such diversity as in these neighborhoods. It’s what makes our city cool. Yes, cool. From top chefs to food trucks, from shaded parks to sunny fields, from big chain stores to small shops; you get the picture! We have a variety that no one else can boast, and we should boast about it. I boast about us now, and will continue to do so when serving at the State Capitol. As someone who grew up without this wonderful blend of opportunities, I can vouch for how cool we are, and I have the experience and understanding of what it will take to secure funding for District 61A.\n\nIn the vein of funding our district, the manner in which we do that at the House is through the Capital Investment Committee. Chair Fue Lee, D-Minneapolis, whose endorsement I carry, sorts through all the proposals that are pitched to the committee for local and municipal funding, and awards the most feasible requests to their respective districts. I’m fortunate to have a robust understanding of this process, and am ready to bring funding back to 61A.\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota and the United States are teetering on a fulcrum balancing greatness and despair. It doesn’t take celebrity status or multiple streams of income to be able to be a good leader. I believe the best leaders need to have something at stake as well. We often hear we need to make things easier for renters, or provide protection for marginalized communities. That is all true and great, but who better to fight for those protections than someone in those groups? I can speak to that from being around so many wonderful DFL legislators who come from all sorts of personal and professional backgrounds. If elected to represent the DFL Party on Aug. 13, I will choose kindness, compassion and action to deliver according to the voices of 61A.\n\nIsabel Rolfes is a legislative assistant to the DFL majority leader and candidate for the Minnesota House in the Democratic primary election for District 61A. Rolfes’ opponents in the primary are Katie Jones and Will Stancil. Jones’ article “What’s good for Minneapolis is good for Minnesota” was published July 15. Stancil’s article “We can be both progressive and forthright about problems” was published Aug. 6."
