        "text": "Looking at NYC today, it’s difficult to imagine that just four years ago there were prominent declarations that its global, vibrant, cheek-by-jowl urban experiment was finally over. The mid-pandemic exodus and subsequent cratering of real estate sales and rentals has since shot up to the highest-ever median rents in Manhattan (currently registering at a new all-time high in the mid-$5,000s per month).\n\nTourism, the accelerant for so many of the city’s amenities, was a priority for a sustainable recovery, and city leaders are doing everything in their power to bring back not only those apprehensive New Yorkers whose hunger for regular bites of the Big Apple is finally being sated, but also the nearly 70 million people who visited in 2019 and spent $46 billion across the expansive quilt of its #1-ranked Sights & Landmarks.\n\nThe city has no other choice: office occupancy remains about 50% of pre-pandemic levels, according to local numbers. For example, Bloomberg examined data from eight major Manhattan office buildings and discovered that “foot traffic is down about 52% on Fridays and 45% on Mondays compared with pre-COVID.”\n\nThe domino effect is perilous: an estimated 40% drop in office market value as office towers sit partially empty could cost $5 billion in lost tax revenue (an astonishing 5% of the city’s annual budget). Subway ridership is equally concerning, resulting in service cuts.\n\nFortunately, tourism numbers have had a breathtaking return, from 33 million visitors in 2021 (less than half of 2019’s total) to 62.2 million in 2023 (11.6 million international and 50.6 domestic)—and onward to a projected\n\n64.5 million in 2024 according to New York City Tourism + Conventions, the city’s official tourism marketing arm.\n\n“We are so appreciative of New York City’s recognition as #1 on Resonance’s 2024 America’s Best Cities Ranking—for the ninth year in a row,” says Nancy Mammana, the organization’s CMO and interim CEO. “We believe it’s a testament to our steady tourism recovery and growth. Our destination continues to shine—with only-in-NYC experiences, including Broadway, world-class dining and sporting events, diverse arts and culture offerings, rich history and more across the five boroughs.”\n\n“Last year we saw robust growth in visitor volume, up almost 10% from 2022, generating $74 billion in economic impact. By the end of 2024, we are expecting a 97% recovery of pre-pandemic record visitation levels.”\n\nFirst order of business: getting those not already here to town. The suspension of travel for more than a year expedited the long-planned transformations of New York’s international gateways. LaGuardia Airport, Newark\n\nLiberty International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport all have new terminals, with the new Terminal B at LaGuardia alone boasting 35 gates (to say nothing of the FAO Schwarz on site). After the new Terminal C came online last year, LaGuardia is suddenly getting international kudos like it’s the 1950s. After an $8-billion multiyear reno, they’re well deserved.\n\nNewark Liberty International’s updated Terminal A has opened with 33 new gates and construction has started on a congestion-easing 2.5-mile elevated guideway train system.\n\nUp next is JFK. The airport just unveiled 130,000 square feet of new and renovated space, and it will open a brand-new, $9.5-billion international terminal in 2026, part of a larger $19-billion airport transformation plan. The New Terminal One will become the largest terminal in the airport, featuring 23 gates and more than 300,000 square feet of dining, NYC-inspired retail and lounges. It’s also going to be an ode to the city’s five boroughs with green spaces and city festival activations.\n\nBack in Manhattan, Moynihan Train Hall is a new 17-track expansion of Penn Station that, if you squint, could pass for a Northern European transit hub from the future.\n\nWith so many expected arrivals, NYC is trying to make sure everyone has a place to stay—no easy feat given last year’s introduction of Local Law 18, a government measure to crack down on short-term rentals. It requires landlords to register their short-term rental properties with the city, prohibits the likes of Airbnb from taking payment for unregistered rentals and requires that the permanent resident of a short-term rental is present during a guest’s stay. The number of short-term listings fell by more than 80% between August and October 2023, sending already pricey hotel rates soaring.\n\nWhich explains the continued new openings. While almost 10,000 new or renovated hotel rooms opened in 2022 alone, including the headline-grabbing Aman New York, an “urban sanctuary” on Fifth Avenue, dozens followed in 2023 and 2024. The Ritz-Carlton New York, NoMad—named for its ’hood—features José Andrés’ Nubeluz lounge on the 50th floor and plenty of massive windows from which to watch the street action. Better yet, soak in the 360-degree city panorama on the rooftop patio. The buildout stretches across the city, with a newly opened Thompson in Midtown and new Renaissance Hotels properties in Harlem and Flushing. Moxy Hotels is also opening multiple locations in the Lower East Side and Williamsburg. The just-opened Fifth Avenue Hotel is an ornate, whimsical microcosm of its city’s attention to detail, from silk space dividers to bejeweled bar carts, with the Café Carmellini among the city’s hottest dining spots this summer. Even more boutique is London-based The Twenty Two hotel and private club in Union Square.\n\nAt street level, the city’s firehose turns cultural, with massive museums (ranking #1 in the country) going all-in on expansions and new openings. The Louis Armstrong House Museum in Corona, Queens, is a new cultural center that includes an interactive exhibit, archival collections, a 68-seat jazz club and a store. The Bronx Children’s Museum also reopened last year after moving to a new home in Mill Pond Park. Dia Chelsea is a new contemporary installation space, and the iconic Frick prepares to reopen its museum and library in December after a multiyear reno of its historic home at 1 East 70th Street.\n\nSpeaking of the Met, New York’s 153-year-old cultural institution (housing 1.5 million objects and hosting seven million visitors in a non-pandemic year) announced a $500-million reno of its modern and contemporary wing. Not as storied but equally New York is the new Museum of Broadway, the first permanent museum dedicated to the famed heartland of the stage, which opened in Times Square with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of major theater productions.\n\nIt’s also the 100-year anniversary of the underrated Museum of the City of New York, which celebrates and documents 750,000 objects, including photographs, prints, costumes, paintings and more, to allow NYC-philes to obsess over this place like nowhere else. Well, except maybe the new Perelman Performing Arts Center, one of the last parts of the World Trade Center complex redevelopment. It’s an elegantly simple cube-shaped jewel box being lauded for its groundbreaking theatrical design and elegy to the horror of its location.\n\nFor those who prefer their immersion outdoors, classics like the High Line and Central Park are joined by the city’s newest green space, Little Island—2.4 acres floating on the Hudson near the Meatpacking District on the site of an old pier. Like most things here, you have to see it to believe it.\n\nWhen it’s your turn to return to America’s best city, do yourself a favor and make time to see the phoenix rise from above: there are the classics, like the Empire State Building and the Top of the Rock, but there are also spectacular new perches, like SUMMIT One Vanderbilt and its all-glass exterior elevators, called Ascent. Go up, look down and breathe out. This city is back.\n\nFew American cities fell harder both in visitor numbers and economically since 2020 than Chicago, even after the city deftly rode its gilded pre-pandemic decade. But the hardship of the pandemic, combined with spiking inflation, only meant that the Windy City was spring-loaded for a breakout 2024 powered by a fully operational O’Hare International, ranked #3 in the country as measured by the number of direct destinations served. Meetings and conventions of all sizes are back, pouring into McCormick Place and its stunning Lake Michigan perch, ranked #1 in our Convention Center subcategory.\n\nThe city’s quiet productivity is humming again, too, and is leaner and more efficient than ever, with the second-most Fortune 500 headquarters in the country, behind only New York. It also ranks in the Top 5 in the country in our Prosperity subcategories ranging from Job Postings and Patents to Professional Services.\n\nEven amid the post-pandemic headlines of emptying city cores and urban flight, Chicago was named the top metro area for corporate investment for an astonishing 11th consecutive year by Site Selection magazine, a business publication that tracks real estate and corporate development in cities with more than a million people. The reason?\n\n“The sense of regionalism exemplified by the Greater Chicagoland Economic Partnership will only reinforce the area’s attractiveness to tech, logistics, innovation, and vibrant young talent in an economy as diverse as its population,” noted the outlet.\n\nAccording to World Business Chicago, the city’s economic development arm, a torrent of investment poured into the city over the past year, ranging from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago, a $275-million biomedical research hub in Fulton Market, to a $20-million tech workforce and training center in Grand Crossing. Just outside of the city, S&C Electric’s 275,000-square-foot facility in Palatine will create hundreds of new jobs.\n\n“Access to diverse talent, global connectivity and the city’s strong infrastructure are among the reasons why Chicago has been ranked a top metropolitan area for selection and corporate relocation for 11 years,” noted Mayor Brandon Johnson in a statement.\n\nThe city is also playing as hard as it’s working and its dance card hasn’t been this full in years. Dozens of summer festivals are on offer, ranging from Lollapalooza to the free shows at the Millennium Park Summer Music Series rocking the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, with everything from salsa orchestras to gospel. Speaking of which, Millennium Park turns 20 this summer and is throwing a free birthday bash in late July, featuring headliners like South Side native Common performing alongside the Grant Park Orchestra and Latin music group Fruko y sus Tesos. The festivals are equally boisterous outside of The Loop, from Lincoln Park’s Chicago Tacos & Tequila Festival to North Avenue Beach’s Air & Water Show.\n\nThe local purveyors of the nation’s second-best nightlife (trailing only NYC) are always happy to keep the party going indoors, especially the Diageo Beer Company people, who opened the second worldwide location of the Guinness Open Gate Brewery in the West Loop neighborhood last summer. This is only further proof of the understated beer culture in a town with 160 breweries, the most of any U.S. city (sorry, Seattle).\n\nThe city is also reclaiming its post-pandemic live-music crown with new venues like The Salt Shed, which opened in 2022 in the former Morton Salt factory warehouse, a nearly 100-year-old landmark. The indoors accommodate 3,300, and more than 5,000 can party in the outdoor section to hip-hop and indie rock and pop acts.\n\nAll that revelry means working up an appetite and Chicago’s #3-ranked restaurants deliver again, only partially because of the recent immortalization by FX series The Bear. From Chef José Andrés’ three-year-old Bazaar Meat and Bar Mar inside Bank of America’s new Chicago headquarters to the city’s youngest Michelin-starred chef, Donald Young, debuting Venteux, a French brasserie in the new Pendry Chicago hotel, this town is fed well. And this being Chicago, the home of so many Slavic immigrants over the centuries, it’s fitting that one of the buzziest places in town is Anelya, a new Ukrainian restaurant by James Beard Award-winning Chef Johnny Clark and his wife, Chef Beverly Kim (and named for Clark’s grandmother). Staffed by Ukrainians, many recently arrived fleeing Russia’s brutal invasion, it feels like a Chicago staple in its quality, community and empathy.\n\nSpeaking of community, Chicago is finally tapping into its 77 neighborhoods within city limits, powered by Choose Chicago, the city’s destination marketing organization, spotlighting the bounty with “The 77: A City of Neighborhoods,” a YouTube series that tells the stories of residents and small business owners in five neighborhoods (with plans to spotlight many more). Last year’s $5.5-million American Rescue Plan Act funding grant also allowed the organization to greatly increase efforts to deliver more of the economic benefits of tourism to the vibrant neighborhoods that are off Chicago’s beaten track.\n\nOne neighborhood that won’t need much help attracting visitors starting next year? South Chicago’s Jackson Park and its $500-million Obama Presidential Center. The campus is intended to function as a world-class museum and public gathering space that showcases the South Side to the world, welcoming 700,000 annual visitors and projected to generate a long-term economic impact of more than $3 billion.\n\nAnother South Side project opened this year is phase 1 of an ambitious plan to build a bike trail from Chicago to Michigan. The Marquette Greenway trail starts in the Calumet Park neighborhood and the entire Illinois portion is now completed. The $40-million trail will stretch all the way to New Buffalo, Michigan, by 2027.\n\nFortunately, hotel capacity is increasing with the city’s placemaking, with three new properties opening last year, including the highly anticipated St. Regis Chicago. The 101-story tower, designed by award-winning architect Jeanne Gang, has changed Chicago’s iconic skyline. It is now the third-tallest building in the city, the 10th tallest in the United States and the tallest building in the world designed by a woman. Hot on its gilded heels is Korean luxury property L7 Hotels by Lotte, designed by award-winning firm AvroKO. Located just steps from the Chicago Riverwalk and the Magnificent Mile, the property boasts 191 rooms and a signature ground-floor restaurant, Perilla, a Korean American steakhouse.\n\nAfter celebrating a dizzying number of centennials last year, ranging from the Hollywood Sign (L.A.’s most iconic landmark according to a recent survey) to Warner Bros. Studios and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the city is now focused on the rest of the decade.\n\nWith so much going on, let’s start with the aforementioned Memorial Coliseum, as hallowed American ground as you’ll find and home to both the first Super Bowl in 1967 and multiple Olympic Games. The historic venue (along with the city’s newest venues like SoFi Stadium) will be central to L.A.’s next four years of massive sporting events, starting with the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the NBA All-Star Game in 2026. The Super Bowl follows in 2027, and the Olympic and Paralympic Games arrive in Summer 2028, when the city will become the first place in the U.S. to host the event three times.\n\nAdam Burke, president & CEO of the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board, pointed out another global first when announcing the host venue of the 2027 Super Bowl. “Remarkably, SoFi Stadium will become the first venue in history to host the FIFA World Cup (2026), Super Bowl (2027) and Olympic & Paralympic Games (2028).”\n\nBut the city is far from sated with the global spotlight on its “Decade of Sport,” and L.A. will only build on its Top 3 finish in our overall Lovability index with equally massive investment into its cultural chops.\n\nThe home of America’s most ambitious museums (trailing only NYC in our ranking) is demanding the world come and visit, with vital exhibitions already launched and massive openings and expansions planned in the months ahead. In Westwood, the Hammer Museum at UCLA reopened last year after its two-decade-long\n\nproject transforming the campus, anchored by the new Lynda and Stewart Resnick Cultural Center at the gateway to Westwood Village. The museum today extends across a full city block, increasing gallery space by 60% to display the Hammer’s large collection of nearly 50,000 pieces. The three-year-old Academy Museum of Motion Pictures wowed visitors with its Hollywoodland exhibit last year, tracing the history of filmmaking in Los Angeles. This year, the museum goes deep on zoetropes, from the 19th century to Pixar.\n\nThe next year is equally frenzied for the city’s arts and culture scene. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is scheduled to reopen its east campus in 2024, with 110,000 square feet of gallery space, a new theater, education spaces, three restaurants and multipurpose event spaces, and will span Wilshire Boulevard in order to accommodate 3.5 acres of new park and outdoor space.\n\nThis fall, the Natural History Museum also opens its NHM Commons—a new wing and community hub on the southwest side of the museum campus in Exposition Park. At the Getty this September, the anticipated PST ART: Art & Science Collide will create urgent civic dialogue by exploring past and present connections between art and science in a series of exhibitions ranging from climate change and environmental justice to the future of artificial intelligence and alternative medicine.\n\nNext up is the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, scheduled to open next year, founded by philanthropist and filmmaker George Lucas and his wife Mellody Hobson, co-CEO and president of Ariel Investments. The museum will focus on the universal art of visual storytelling and will feature expansive galleries, state-of-the-art cinematic theaters, dedicated spaces for learning and engagement and a new public green space.\n\nThe city’s long-smoldering arts bounty isn’t just confined to paid access, of course, and there’s no better place for walkable immersion than the recently reopened historic Sixth Street Viaduct, a transformative infrastructure project that replaced the original 1932 bridge and today unites the Boyle Heights community to the east and the Arts District and Downtown to the west. The project has reinvigorated the Arts District and today its galleries, murals and dozens of independent shops and outdoor markets host daily events that draw locals from across the county.\n\nThe Arts District is the perfect place to validate L.A.’s #1 ranking in our Restaurants subcategory. From Michelin-starred places like Frenchmeets-Southeast Asian restaurant Camphor to the Japanese perfection of Hayato and the Taiwanese fare of Kato, few places in America offer the fine dining density found in the city’s hottest ’hood. For more budget-friendly but no less indulgent options, make reservations for the Italian cuisine at Bestia and mind-blowing Middle Eastern food at Bavel. For something more local and casual, don’t miss nearby Yangban and its Korean-SoCal magic, or Ditroit’s street tacos.\n\nThe next emerging neighborhood to watch is the 1.3 miles along Crenshaw Boulevard, just east of LAX. Positioned by organizers as “the spine of Los Angeles’ Black community,” the area is in the midst of transformative infrastructure projects focused on “economic development, job creation and environmental healing,” with a focus on stewarding Black art and culture that, when completed, will be “the place to experience the most dynamic expression of Black American culture in the United States.” Visit it now, then again in a few years to see the dizzying amount of strategic urban planning, commercial and residential development and ambitious architecture, placemaking and more than 100 commissioned works of art in full bloom.\n\nSpeaking of LAX, the city’s gateway to the world is in the midst of a $30-billion capital investment program, now in its final phase. Launched way back in 2009, it has been the largest public works project in the city’s history. The final push will renovate terminals 4 and 5 and open the much anticipated (but delayed) automated people mover (APM) train scheduled to launch next year and finally connect LAX’s rejuvenated terminals and the growing amenities around the airport. But lest you think L.A. is turning its back on the car, LAX will open the planet’s largest car rental facility with capacity for 18,000 vehicles later this year. Good thing the new $1.7-billion Regional Connector Transit Project opened last year. Featuring a 1.9-mile underground light-rail system, you can now take a one-seat ride across Los Angeles County, making travel on the Metro Gold Line to Long Beach and from East Los Angeles to Santa Monica possible without transferring lines. And, more importantly, not sitting in traffic.\n\nL.A. is also the crucial site of what is being called America’s first high-speed, all-electric rail project. Headed by rail construction firm Brightline (of Florida intercity fame), the train is designed to connect Los Angeles and Las Vegas with 218 miles of track (most of it across the Mojave Desert) with an estimated completion date of 2028. The project was facilitated by $3 billion in federal funding supplied by the Biden Administration, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg noting that the project would “remove an estimated 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, bolster tourism and create 35,000 good-paying jobs.”\n\nWith almost two decades’ worth of planning, planting and stewarding, it’s time to optimize the return on all that investment. Appropriately, the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board launched its largest-ever global promotional campaign titled “Now Playing,” with an eight-figure budget."
