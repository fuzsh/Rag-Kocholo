We utilize the recommendations outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n\nThere is no single definitive test of conformance to Level AA of the WCAG. If you find a part of the site that you feel does not conform to Level AA of the WCAG or are having difficulty obtaining the information you need, please contact us using one of these methods so that we may rectify it:\n\n• Contact us by phone at 616-842-6250\n\n• Contact us via email: customerservice@ghblp.org\n\nGrand Haven Board of Light & Power will make best efforts to ensure that new and updated web content produced by our organization meets Level AA Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as published by the Web Accessibility Initiative and suggested by the United State Department of Justice within a reasonable timeframe. We commit to conduct website accessibility testing on a regular basis, as well as provide mandatory training for affected staff members.\n\nContent provided for our site by third-party developers is not the responsibility of Grand Haven Board of Light & Power, and therefore we do not claim full site-wide conformance, notably where it concerns crucial third-party plug-ins and widgets. Our conformance claim only extends to pages within the www.ghblp.org domain. User-generated content is also excluded. Grand Haven Board of Light & Power understands W3C's position that there is as of yet no tool that can perform a completely automatic assessment on the checkpoints in the guidelines, and fully automatic testing may remain difficult or impossible.\n\nThe Grand Haven Board of Light & Power’s website accessibility policy will be reviewed annually by our Administrative Services Department."
