        "text": "DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — You could stand on the street and hear the teenager’s squeaking sneakers as she sped up and stopped on Court No. 4 .\n\nCoco Gauff was back from Wimbledon and preparing for the United States Open, another high-wattage stop for the tennis virtuoso.\n\nBut unlike many of the players who have turned to South Florida’s training grounds to master slices and serves, she was practicing in the city where she was born 15 years ago. Her swift rise to international sensation was shaped in a tennis town — a public court complex with an 8,200-seat stadium sprawls behind City Hall — where her family has influenced the community for generations.\n\nGauff’s relatives have been civil rights stalwarts and stellar athletes, Little League organizers and ministers in this city of about 69,000 people. Now the spotlight extends far beyond Delray Beach, falling onto a 15-year-old girl who gained enough new fans that many simply call her “Coco.” They don’t need her surname — or her given name of Cori — to buzz about a star on the rise.\n\n“Everything transpired so quickly with her,” said Deirdra Thomas, who has worked at Pompey Park, a longtime practice spot, since before Gauff was born. “Once she was rolling, that was it. We used to tease her parents: ‘Y’all save us tickets for Wimbledon. I want to go to the French Open, so y’all save me a seat in the box.’”"
