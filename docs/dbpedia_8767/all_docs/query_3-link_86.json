        "text": "Last weekend, rising CT-based jam outfit Eggy opened for Twiddle along with Aqueous at College Street Music Hall in New Haven. While Twiddle was the evening’s main event, the crowd came out early for Eggy, who delivered a high-energy set of originals for their hometown fans. During the set, guitarist Jake Brownstein spoke about making their debut at New Haven’s premier concert venue, explaining, “we’re from New Haven, so when this venue opened up a year ago, we couldn’t have ever imagined playing here.”\n\nAs keyboardist Dani Battat expressed following the performance, “Playing College Street Music Hall was an opportunity for us to reflect on the past four years of hard work and learning to be a band. We are incredibly grateful for everyone’s support that has helped bring us to this stage in our careers and we view this show as a glimpse into the future.”\n\nYou can watch the full set below:\n\nSetlist: In It For The Ride > All Wheels Turnin’, Onitsuka Tiger > In It For The Ride (Reprise)"
