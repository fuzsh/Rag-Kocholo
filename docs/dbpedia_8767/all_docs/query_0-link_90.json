        "text": "In the little town of Whitman, just south of Boston, there’s a parking lot between a Wendy’s and a Walgreens with a curious sign.\n\nIt’s a large white wooden board that features a Colonial bellman and the number “1709.” From a distance, it doesn’t look like much.\n\nBut if you take the time to read the plaque underneath, you’ll find that this landmark is the birthplace of one of America’s most famous foods.\n\nThis is where the first chocolate chip cookies were made.\n\nTo be more specific, the monument marks the original location of the Toll House Restaurant. It was there, in the 1930s, that Ruth Graves Wakefield first whipped together what would be known as “Toll House” cookies.\n\nBut this spot was home to more than just cookie innovation. Over the past couple of centuries, it’s been a private residence, a regular stop for the Kennedy family, a nightclub, a “firefighter’s nightmare,” an empty lot that “looks like hell,” and a “haven for wandering hippies.”\n\nBut at no point was it actually a functioning toll house.\n\nRight now, it’s an unassuming parking lot. Here’s how it got to this point:\n\nThe Toll House Restaurant, Part 1 (1930-1968)\n\nIn 1930, Ruth and Kenneth Wakefield purchased an old Cape Cod-style cottage for $6,500. The property, built in 1817, was a private residence until just a few years before the Wakefields took over.\n\nEven as the country dove into the Great Depression, the Wakefields sought to open a restaurant “that served food wholesome meals served in a congenial atmosphere.”\n\nThe original restaurant had seven tables, one waitress and one chef. Within three years, the Toll House had expanded to 64 tables and claimed to serve up to 2,000 guests per day.\n\nThe Toll House was a booming success, with much of the credit going to the restaurant’s impeccable service and Ruth Wakefield’s famous desserts.\n\nThe Toll House drew rave reviews for its Boston cream pie and pecan rolls. But most of all, Wakefield remains best known for her innovative spin on a butterscotch nut cookie that was served as a free add-on to ice cream.\n\nYou might know it better as the chocolate chip cookie.\n\nA favorite of the state’s storied Kennedy family\n\nAs the Toll House grew in fame, so did its list of customers.\n\nAmong those who dined there were boxing legend Rocky Marciano, food expert Duncan Hines, Boston Mayor James Michael Curley and then-U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy, who went on to be president. One of the Toll House’s future owners claimed that Kennedy ate at the restaurant once a week during his time in the Senate.\n\nAccording to Carolyn Wyman, author of “The Great American Chocolate Chip Cookie Book‚” the future president’s father, Joseph Kennedy Sr., “stopped there twice a week” for years to indulge in desserts.\n\nSo why does the sign say 1709?\n\nWhen the Wakefields purchased the property, the year “1709″ was written on the chimney in large letters. It then became common belief that the building traced back to that date.\n\nThat belief lasted until the 1970s when local historian Martha Campbell published a series of columns and letters debunking myths of the Toll House.\n\nCampbell wrote that Wakefield took the 1709 date and ran with it, knowing the value of a “good story.”\n\n“There wasn’t anything at this corner in 1709. There wasn’t even a corner,” she wrote.\n\nIn 1995, the Whitman Historical Commission published a history of the Toll House, confirming that the original building dates back to 1817.\n\nHowever, the “1709″ date still appears in many places, including the plaque at the current Toll House monument.\n\nThe Toll House falls to shambles\n\nThe Toll House remained an institution in Whitman until the Wakefields retired from the business in 1968 and sold the property to the Noel family.\n\nThe new owners tried to turn the restaurant into a nightclub, called Noel’s. The venture was a disaster. By 1970, Noel’s had closed and the owners walked away, leaving the historic building in a state of neglect.\n\nAccording to the South Shore News, damage to the interior included “gaping plaster holes” and “94 broken windows.”\n\nThe publication even wrote that the old Toll House “became a haven for wandering hippies.”\n\nThe Toll House Restaurant, Part 2 (1973-1984)\n\nIn 1972, Frank and Carolyn Sacconne, a husband-and-wife team, purchased the derelict property. Their goal was to restore the Toll House to its former glory.\n\nAfter months of renovations, the Saccone family opened the doors to a restored Toll House Restaurant in 1973.\n\nBy 1981, the new owners decided to take advantage of the restaurant’s role in cookie history by selling “Toll House cookies” to stores.\n\nThis caught the eye of Nestle, who sued the Saccone’s over the “Toll House” trademark. In 1983, a federal judge ruled that the “Toll House cookie” had become part of common language — similar to thermos and aspirin — and was no longer subject to trademark.\n\nThe Toll House goes up in flames.\n\nIn the closing minutes of New Year’s Eve 1983, the entire history of the Toll House went up in flames.\n\nAt about 11:30 p.m., just after the kitchen had closed, a grease fire broke out. An automatic fire extinguisher was triggered. But by then, the fire had already worked its way through the ducts and into the attic.\n\n“It was a firefighter’s nightmare,” a fire chief told the Brockton Enterprise at the time. “There were no fire stops in the partitions and false ceilings were everywhere.”\n\nFire departments from Whitman and four surrounding towns responded to the blaze. No injuries were reported. But by the time the fire was brought under control, the Toll House had been lost.\n\nOne more attempt at a comeback.\n\nTwo years after the fire, the Saccone family sold the ruined Toll House property to Callahan Construction, a general contracting firm based in Randolph at the time.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, Callahan marketed the land to potential restaurateurs to revive the Toll House. But after six years of trying, the company turned to bids for fast-food restaurants and condos.\n\n“Nobody wanted to fill this thing with a Toll House Restaurant more than we did,” Steve Callahan told the Boston Globe at the time.\n\nLosing the Toll House for good\n\nWhat was once the rear parcel of the Toll House property was turned into condominiums, dubbed the Toll House Village.\n\nIn 1993, the southern end of the property was sold to make way for a Wendy’s. It marked the end of an era in Whitman. But by this point, the Toll House property had turned into an eyesore.\n\n“I have mixed feelings about losing the Toll House. But it’s better to have something than nothing at all,” Dick Cole, chairman of the Whitman Board of Selectmen, said to the Boston Globe at the time.\n\n“I mean, right now, the site looks like hell,” he added.\n\nAs a condition for building the restaurant, Wendy’s agreed with the town of Whitman to display clippings and photos of the old Toll House. As of 2024, the Wendy’s no longer displays anything related to the Toll House.\n\nThe push to create a monument - led by future gubernatorial candidate.\n\nGeoff Diehl is a former Massachusetts state representative and gubernatorial candidate who now serves on the Republican State Committee.\n\nYears ago, he was a Whitman resident who worked for Poiyant Signs in New Bedford. He remembers being frustrated whenever he drove past the site. He worked for a sign company, but could never find an opportunity to do anything about the Toll House sign.\n\nAt least until 2006, when Walgreens approached the town of Whitman about building a pharmacy on the north side of the original Toll House property.\n\nTown officials were on board. But there were some conditions. Walgreens would be responsible for maintaining the landmark and sign.\n\nDiehl seized the opportunity and approached his company and, later, the Whitman Historic Commission, with a plan to restore the sign. Not long after, Nestle sweetened the deal by offering $25,000 in funding for the project.\n\nThe sign had taken a beating over the years. Some of the lettering had fallen off and the bell ringers were rotting.\n\nPoiyant Signs was responsible for restoring the bulk of the sign, including the numbers. But those hand-card wooden bell ringers? They had to be sent to a specialist — Hassan Wood Carving & Sign in Cohasset for months of repairs.\n\nDiehl said the goal of the restoration project was to retain as much of the sign as possible. The design is 100% the same as it was in 1984, but is made up of “about 50% of the original material,” he said.\n\nFor his part in the restoration project, Diehl received an award from the town of Whitman — and was approached about joining a town committee. That led to a seat on the Whitman Finance Committee and eventually, his entry into politics.\n\n“I guess you could say that Toll House sign ended up pointing me in the direction of Beacon Hill,” Diehl said.\n\nBy 2007, the sign had been fully restored and installed along with a monument telling the history of the Toll House restaurant.\n\nWalgreens said in a statement that it is the “sole owner of the parcel lot” where the landmark resides. The company remains responsible for its upkeep. In 2021, the sign underwent another restoration. Lighting was also added to the to better display the monument."
