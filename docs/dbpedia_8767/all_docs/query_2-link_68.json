        "text": "1. What is a certified copy of a certificate?\n\n2. What is an uncertified copy of a certificate?\n\nAn uncertified copy of a certificate issued by North Carolina Vital Records will be on plain (white) paper and will be clearly stamped \"Uncertified\". It will not have a raised Vital Records seal.\n\nUncertified copies are for informational purposes only and are not accepted for legal purposes. They are available to anyone who requests them unless legal restrictions apply. You must be able to provide us with all of the information requested on the application and pay the appropriate search fees.\n\n3. Is my certificate or certificate order status publicly available on your website?\n\nNo, vital records are not free public records. See the Order a Certificate page to place a new order for a regular certificate that does not require changes or amendments. See the Change a Record page to amend or correct a certificate.\n\nOrder status can be obtained using the status inquiry form.\n\n4. I'm a resident of a foreign country that requires an apostille. How do I obtain an apostille?\n\n5. What is the cost to order a certificate?\n\n6. What is the official site to order a birth certificate?\n\n7. What forms of ID may I use to obtain a certificate?\n\nDue to identity theft and other fraudulent use of vital records, ID of the person requesting a certificate is REQUIRED. Requests that do not include ID will be returned. You MUST include a legible photocopy of one of the photo IDs listed below with your request:\n\nCurrent state-issued driverâs license (address must match requestorâs address on application)\n\nCurrent state-issued non-driver photo ID card (address must match requestorâs address on application)\n\nCurrent Passport or Visa (must include photo)\n\nCurrent U.S. military ID\n\nCurrent Department of Corrections photo ID card dated within the last year\n\nCurrent state or U.S. government agency photo ID card (for persons requesting certificates as part of that agencyâs business)\n\nCurrent student ID card with copy of transcript\n\nIf you do not have one of the IDs listed above, you must provide legible photocopies of TWO of the following (must be two DIFFERENT forms of ID):\n\nTemporary driverâs license\n\nCurrent utility bill with current address\n\nCar registration or title with current address\n\nBank statement with current address\n\nPay stub with current address\n\nIncome tax return/W-2 form showing current address\n\nLetter from government agency dated within the last six months and showing current address\n\nState-issued concealed weapon permit showing current address\n\nIf you are unable to meet our ID requirements, a family member or other person who is entitled to obtain the certificate, and who can meet the ID requirements, may request it. A list of persons entitled to obtain certificates is located here under \"What is a certified copy of a certificate?\"\n\n8. How long will it take to receive my certificate order?\n\n9. How do I check the status of my certificate order?\n\nOrder request volume is high. We suggest you view the estimated NC Vital Records processing and shipping dates, which vary by service and order type. Note: The processing dates page does not apply to amendments, which can take longer than regular certificate requests because of additional research and process often involved.\n\nIf your order is outside the estimated processing and shipping window and you need to check order status, there is a status inquiry form for existing certificate orders.\n\n10. Why has my payment been processed but itâs been weeks or months and I havenât received my certificate order?\n\nOur intake and ordering process goes through multiple steps. There is a $24 search (and one copy) fee that is nonrefundable, even if a record is not found, so we must process payments before completing the order. Due to order volume and system migrations from paper to electronic, there will usually be a time gap between your payment being processed and orders being completed and delivered to you, especially if there are issues to be researched and addressed with orders (e.g., amendments to certificates). If a record is not found during the search, then we will be in touch. Payments above the $24 search fee can be refunded when a record is not found and an order is cancelled. See our current processing times for different certificate and order types.\n\n11. Can I order certificates by email?\n\nSorry, we are not able to accept requests by email.\n\n12. What should I do if my child or I was born in North Carolina but there is not a birth certificate on file?\n\nSee Delayed Birth Certificates.\n\n13. How do I get a birth certificate if I was not born in North Carolina?\n\n14. How do I get a copy of a birth certificate after adoption?\n\nSee the adoptions page for process and form(s). Certified copies of anÂ adopted person'sÂ birth certificate are available only to the adoptee, the adoptive parents, the adoptee's children, and the adoptee's spouse, brothers, and sisters (proof of relationship may be required). The terms parent, brother and sister mean the adoptive parent, brother, or sister.\n\n15. How do I get a copy of an original birth certificate before adoption?\n\nOriginalÂ birth certificates of adoptees showing the adoptee's original name and the birth mother's name are in legally sealed files and are available only by court order. Contact the Clerk of Court that handles adoptions in the county that processed the adoption to find out what they require to have the record unsealed.\n\n16. Where else in North Carolina can I get copies of vital records?\n\n17. What if the record I seek is older than those held by Vital Records?\n\nSee Finding Older Records.\n\n18. How do I correct or change a certificate? Who can I contact about making a change to the record?\n\n19. How do I know if the health department received my payment for an amendment?\n\nAmendments are not done at the health department, they are done at the county Register of Deeds office. You will need to call the county Register of Deeds to see if they received your payment.\n\n20. How do I get a Social Security number for my new baby?\n\nIf you requested a Social Security Number for your baby during completion of the birth certificate at the hospital, N.C. Vital Records will register the birth certificate and will send the necessary information to the Social Security Administration.\n\nIf you did not request a number at the hospital, or if you have any questions, you will need to contact your local Social Security Office.\n\n21. If I want to get married in North Carolina, do I come to your office?\n\nNo. You should contact a Register of Deeds office. They can issue the marriage license to you and explain the requirements for getting married in North Carolina. Once you've been married, you will be able to obtain copies of your marriage certificate from that Register of Deeds office or from N.C. Vital Records."
