        "text": "IT'S taken 211 years, but Connecticut has finally produced a president of the United States.\n\nTrue, George W. Bush pulled up stakes and moved to Texas at an early age -- the age of 2 to be precise -- but his birth in New Haven on July 6, 1946, makes him a Connecticut native and the only one ever elected president. Good luck getting him to acknowledge that.\n\nMr. Bush was born in Connecticut just as his father, who had delayed college to serve as a World War II Navy pilot, had completed his sophomore year at Yale. George W. was born to Barbara and George Bush in what was then Grace-New Haven Community Hospital and is now Yale-New Haven Hospital. The new baby's first home, according to Herbert Parmet, his father's biographer, was 37 Hillhouse Avenue, a one-family house that had been converted into apartments for veterans and their families.\n\n''Not to make too much of the postwar housing shortage,'' the elder Bush has written, ''but there were a dozen other veterans' families sharing the house with us -- each with one child, except for Bill and Sally Reeder, who had twins. That made 40 in all.''\n\nBut the neighborhood was good. Charles Seymour, the president of Yale, lived next door at 43 Hillhouse Avenue, which is still home to Yale presidents. The Bush homestead still stands and is presently occupied by the Yale Economics Department.\n\nChristopher Collier, the state historian, said one reason Connecticut failed to produce a president in more than 200 years has been its small population and its few electoral votes, which now stand at eight and will be down to seven for the next presidential election in 2004. (Of course, Calvin Coolidge, a native of Vermont, with just three electoral votes, won the presidency in 1924.)\n\nBill Curry, a Democrat who was a former state comptroller and ran for governor of Connecticut in 1994, said the explanation had more to do with the state's traditional sensibilities.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
