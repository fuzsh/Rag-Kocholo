The most important thing to know is that this one-of-a-kind event is your chance to immerse yourself in the latest state education policy trends and networking opportunities with state policymakers, experts and practitioners from all across the country.\n\nJoin us at the J.W. Marriott in Washington, D.C. July 10-12 to work on building thriving education systems across the country.\n\nWe have an exciting agenda planned for you this year. Be sure to register by May 31 to secure your spot at the hotel.\n\nOur Plenary Lineup\n\nOn our mainstage, we’ll start the National Forum with a dynamic presentation on increasing access to quality music education. Throughout the event, our mainstage will also feature conversations with 2023 Teacher of the Year Rebecka Peterson, remarks from ECS Chair, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly as well as a panel of experts discussing the impact of generative AI on education and the future of higher education!\n\nIn addition to these noteworthy speakers, you won’t want to miss the announcement of our three award recipients.\n\nOur Concurrent Sessions\n\nOutside of the plenary sessions, we’ll host 24 concurrent sessions on the full education policy spectrum — from early care and education, K-12, postsecondary and the workforce — throughout the three-day event. For the first time, we’re excited to have 16 guest sessions selected from our request for proposal process! These sessions will cover topics like:\n\nLiteracy and the science of reading.\n\nChronic absenteeism.\n\nTeachers and school staff recruitment and retention.\n\nPostsecondary and K-12 funding.\n\nAnd many more!\n\nThese sessions are just a part of what makes National Forum a worthwhile experience. When you’re not in one of our plenary or concurrent sessions, you’ll be able to connect with attendees from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. You’ll also get to engage with our Partners during State Spotlights and Roundtables to learn about innovative approaches to education issues from organizations and leaders in the field. This is one of the few opportunities to connect with so many experts and education leaders in one place, so we encourage you to seize this special opportunity!\n\nNo matter your role in education policy or areas of interest, this year’s National Forum in our nation’s capital is the place to be this summer! Join your peers for these three can’t-miss days of unique speakers, workshops and invaluable networking opportunities."
