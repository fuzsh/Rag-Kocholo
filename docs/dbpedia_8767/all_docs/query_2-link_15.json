        "text": "When you hear some of the comments Americans make about geography or about other countries do you ever wonder how many of them have ever traveled?\n\nResearch of 2,000 Americans across the country (a good statistical sample) in a new study conducted by market researchers OnePoll, and commissioned by travel luggage provider Victorinox, explored the nation’s travel experiences and the things that seem to stop people from exploring more.\n\nThe results are pretty amazing, and perhaps explain the gaps of knowledge many Americans seem to have of the world:\n\n-- Eleven percent of survey respondents have never traveled outside of the state where they were born.\n\n-- Over half of those surveyed (54 percent) say they’ve visited 10 states or fewer.\n\n-- As many as 13 percent say they have never flown in an airplane.\n\n-- Forty percent of those questioned said they’ve never left the country.\n\n-- Over half of respondents have never owned a passport. (For years U.S. citizens did not need one to travel to Mexico, Canada and on many cruises, which may clarify the previous stat.)\n\nBut this lack of travel is not always because people don't want to. Most of those surveyed expressed a desire to travel, with 85 percent saying they like to experience new things, and nearly 60 percent saying they have a list of places in mind they’d like to see.\n\nIn fact, survey results showed 76 percent of the respondents wanted to travel more than they do currently. The reasons they gave for why they don't are what you would expect: mainly due to a lack of finances or just feeling unprepared and ill-equipped to venture forth into unknown territory.\n\nMore specifically, 63 percent of Americans who have never left the country said an international trip would be out of their price range.\n\nAnd work situations and priorities are involved as well: Twenty-five percent said they just can’t find the time to travel, but three-fourths of respondents said they would definitely like to travel more than they do.\n\nThe survey went on to ask about people’s luggage, with 60 percent saying that size and functionality were the most important qualities. And here's a reality check: As many as 32 percent of those studied in the poll said they either don’t own or can’t actually remember ever buying any travel luggage. Thirty percent of those polled haven’t bought new luggage in six or more years, with only 10 percent knowing where their current luggage came from.\n\nAnd 13 percent of those polled don’t own luggage of any kind."
