LOCK HAVEN, PA – Crowds will descend on Triangle Park this Saturday morning for the latest installment of the Hometown Hero Celebration and official banner unveiling.

On a call with Downtown Lock Haven, Inc. Manager Kira Rosamilia this morning, she was able to provide the following updates to the ceremony beginning at 10 AM.

“We have had some minor changes to the schedule of events for speakers who are not able to attend tomorrow morning, including State Senator Cris Dush and County Commissioner Miles Kessinger,” Kira said. “Also, seating provided at Triangle Park will be limited, so please bring your own chairs if you do not wish to stand for the ceremony.”

The Hometown Heroes Celebration, now nearly a decade-and-a-half long, has unveiled thousands of banners since its 2007 inception.

This year’s banners are lining the streets of Bellefonte Avenue from slightly before Spring Street to Triangle Park, East Main Street, East Water Street, a select few on Grove Street between Church and Main Streets, and lining the Lock Haven Levee Trail.

The schedule for this year’s ceremony is as follows:
