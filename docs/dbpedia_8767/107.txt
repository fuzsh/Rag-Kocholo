They will also have a mobile paper shredding company for securely shredding all your important papers and documents at no charge. The idea is to serve the community by giving citizens from the area a chance to conveniently and safely drop these recyclables, and to provide information about services to the public as well.

Neighborhood residents, students and all New Haveners can bring their unwanted or broken electronic devices (t.v.'s, monitors, computers, phones, printers, wires, etc.), mattresses and box springs, and textiles (clothing, shoes, linens, handbags, belts and accessories) for recycling.
