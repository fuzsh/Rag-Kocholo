        "text": "The book presents a comprehensive overview of the vast production of monuments in socialist Yugoslavia (1945–91) dedicated to the antifascist People's Liberation Struggle in the Second World War and the socialist revolution. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, these monuments have been subject to various fates, from neglect and physical destruction to global fame generated by the high-modernist visual appeal of a number of them. But the full scope, wide-ranging diversity, and complex context of Yugoslav monument making, including its various contradictions, have remained largely unexplored. The book offers a thorough and interdisciplinary exploration of this phenomenon and a rich visual material to examine its key characteristics and specificities: What memorial practices and commemorative traditions preceded the development of monument-making in socialism? Who commissioned these monuments and how did Yugoslav cultural and memory politics influence their production? Who were their authors and what defined their formal and typological features? How was Yugoslav monument production related to comparative efforts abroad? What commemorative practices developed around monuments? How is this legacy evaluated and received today, both in the post-Yugoslav successor states and internationally?\n\n\"Architectural heritage of Yugoslav-socialist character: ideology, memory and identity\" studies the ability of architecture to represent political and cultural endeavors and developments in the period from 1945 until 1990 in territories which formed the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. The thesis is divided into two parts: the first part analyzes how architecture, as a discourse per se and an ideological apparatus, was used for representation of Yugoslav socialist identity. The second part studies how the deconstruction of given identity, and its consequent dismissal in the process of re-construction of national identities has influenced the level of preservation of heritage of representative character found in territories which previously formed the SFRY. The hypothesis upon which the research is built, stating that the architectural significance of heritage of representative nature built in the socialist period and found in Yugoslav successor countries is dependent on (the assessment of) its cultural, social and historical character, has emerged from the perception of the second part of the problem. However, the larger part of the thesis is devoted to the study of how circumstances in SFRY influenced the character of following three categories of buildings and spaces: I) Governmental buildings and buildings of the League of Communist of Yugoslavia II) Institutions of educational-ideological character and memorial centers III) Memorials and memorial sites. With an objective to analyze how political and social occurrences in the SFRY in the period 1945-1990 influenced the processes of construction of above-listed representative buildings and spaces, the study approaches several important moments in development of architectural discourse in socialist Yugoslavia, such as: the appearance of modernist architecture in the Interwar period; the discussion on the socialist realist style; the influence of the political conflict between Tito and Stalin on architectural developments; architectural developments during the \"Informbiro Period\"; initiation of grandiose projects of representative character in the period 1956-1965; an impulse in erection of buildings and spaces of educational-ideological and cultural-memorial character in between 1966 and 1974; the appearance of the postmodernism; and finally the course of architectural developments after Josip Broz Tito's death in 1981 till the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1990. The second part of the thesis researches how and why architectural works of representative character built in between 1945 and 1990 are neglected in the present. The objective of a critical and hermeneutical study is to perceive how the process of re-construction of national, cultural identities in the states reconstructed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia has influenced on the negative perception of the given architecture. The architectural works presented in the first chapter now are perceived as architectural heritage and analyzed as a cultural legacy of the uncomfortable nature. The discomfort towards the heritage built in the socialist period is approached through the study of the process of (re)interpretation of cultural memory. The analysis is conducted with the objective to perceive how the transformation in \"collective frameworks of memory\" has influenced \"collective memory\" of those societies and consequently the condition of architectural heritage of representative character found in the given territories. The research comes to an end with an insight into the level of preservation and state of condition of the representative heritage of Yugoslav-socialist character and concludes with recommendations for the improvement of protection mechanisms and suggestions on the modalities for its architectural and cultural revitalization.\n\nIn the beginning, we shall examine the indicated transformations in the landscape of monuments in the Croatian context using Žižić’s fĳilm Damnatio Memoriae (2001). After analyzing the destruction of monuments in the post-Yugoslavian con- text, we juxtapose it with the Yugoslav socialist state art and the post- revolutionary politics of aesthetics. In the second part we will reflect on the reconciliation discourse in Slovenia, which reveals typical revisionist aesthetization and memorialization strategies. The new politics of memory will be interpreted as indispensable for the nation-building processes in the post-Yugoslav context. We shall try to answer the following question: What is the difference between the Yugoslav politics of memory on the Peoples’ Liberation Struggle (1941–1945) and the post-Yugoslav politics of memory? The concluding part exposes a discussion on the Partisan movement, which embarks on a critique of the national reconciliation ideology and renders an alternative interpretation of the war period that in some respect runs counter to the dominant nationalist readings of this period.\n\nThe artistic monuments inspired by the motives of the People's Liberation Struggle and Revolution of Yugoslavia are stratified phenomena constructed through a multitude of meanings. They are an indispensable part of important movements of architectural thought: the Yugoslavian avant-garde and the synthesis of all arts as its distinctive operational mode; the process of how the modern non-figurative means became an official language to Yugoslavian socialist ideology as opposed to the soc-realist figuration of the Eastern Bloc; the popularization of the Yugoslavian heritage taking place in the last decade as a unique enclave of the world scene of modern architecture, etc. This paper aims to argument their conception and meaning as a complex synthesis of art, architecture, technology and nature, and at the same time to open a potential health paradigm positioning them in the context of open-air culture, new ritual practices of social memory and new museum-destination types of contemporary art forms. In terms of methodology, this study puts together architectural scholars who actively work on the problem of the synthesis of the arts, offers a detailed review of existing scientific knowledge on artistic monuments in order to provide a new conceptual frame, an instructive yet speculative material that can alter the perception away from the old ideological stand into a new and healthy synthesized experience. Apart from the theorization of this synthesis paradigm as a way of bringing back to life the artistic monuments inspired by the motives of the People's Liberation Struggle and Revolution of Yugoslavia, this paper provides criteria for this new conceptual frame and showcases them upon selected case study. The authors have contributed equally to this work. The complexity of the title \"Artistic Monuments Inspired by the Motives of the People's Liberation Struggle and Revolution of Yugoslavia\" is taken from the then prevailing Yugoslavian nomenclature of monuments.\n\nArchitecture represents one of the possible ways of how territory can be marked, but it is also a permanent trace of the process of its development. As a built form it is a sign in the ground, while as an idea it represents a trace of various approaches to its development within a theoretical field. This paper examines the significance and meaning of a single architectural gesture within the context of an architectural narrative of the city territory by starting from the structural approach to observation of the territory (Gregotti) and the method of post-structuralist analysis. This study links and analyses: 1) the importance of the architectural gesture in the process of defining and developing the territory of the city, through 2) changing position from the phenomenological (formal, formative) to topographic discourse of observing architecture, which examines 3) the potential of the interpretative narrative both of the architecture and the territory. Memorial park Jajinci was selected as a case study whose primary purpose is to relate messages about the significance and meaning of the place where it is located. The aim of this kind of analysis of the interpretive potential of this example is to show the importance of the elements of the territory as a witness of the processes of development based on spatial narratives 'written down' in the city territory."
