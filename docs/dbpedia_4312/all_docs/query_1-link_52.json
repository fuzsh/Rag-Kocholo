        "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive and neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by memory impairment that results problems in day-today life and in accomplishing usual tasks, causes inconvenience in understanding visual images and spatial relationships. Familial AD is correlated with the mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes (PSEN1 and PSEN2) and Aβ metabolism, whereas APOEε4 moderates amyloid-related memory decline in preclinical AD. On the contrary, sporadic AD is found to exist with complex interaction of both genetic and environmental risk factors. Genome-wide association studies and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have brought out more than 20 loci correlated with AD risk. Genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) have identified polymorphisms in or near several genes that are correlated with AD risk, including ABCA7, CLU, CR1, CD33, CD2AP, EPHA1, BIN1, PICALM and MS4A. Among most of them, central role of ApoE, CLU and ABCA7 in cholesterol metabolism imposes this pathway in AD pathogenesis. CR1, CD33, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1 and TREM2 are associated with neuroinflammation and dysregulation of the immune response. Genes associated with endocytosis and synaptic function are recognized in several GWAS of LOAD risk, including BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1.\n\nSporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an emerging chronic illness characterized by a progressive pleiotropic pathophysiological mode of actions triggered during the senescence process and affecting the elderly worldwide. The complex molecular mechanisms of AD not only are supported by cholinergic, beta-amyloid, and tau theories but also have a genetic basis that accounts for the difference in symptomatology processes activation among human population which will evolve into divergent neuropathological features underlying cognitive and behaviour alterations. Distinct immune system tolerance could also influence divergent responses among AD patients treated by immunotherapy. The complexity in nature increases when taken together the genetic/immune tolerance with the patient's brain reserve and with neuropathological evolution from early till advance AD clinical stages. The most promising diagnostic strategies in today's world would consist in performing high diagnostic accuracy of combined modality imaging technologies using beta-amyloid 42 peptide-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positron emission tomography (PET), Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, total and phosphorylated tau-CSF, and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging hippocampus biomarkers for criteria evaluation and validation. Early diagnosis is the challenge task that needs to look first at plausible mechanisms of actions behind therapies, and combining them would allow for the development of efficient AD treatment in a near future.\n\nAlzheimer's disease susceptibility genes, APP and gamma-secretase, are involved in the herpes simplex life cycle, and that of other suspect pathogens (C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, C. neoformans, B. burgdorferri, P. gingivalis) or immune defence. Such pathogens promote beta-amyloid deposition and tau phosphorylation and may thus be causative agents, whose effects are conditioned by genes. The antimicrobial effects of beta-amyloid, the localisation of APP/gamma-secretase in immunocompetent dendritic cells, and gamma secretase cleavage of numerous pathogen receptors suggest that this network is concerned with pathogen disposal, effects which may be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the elderly. These autoantibodies, as well as those to nerve growth factor and tau, also observed in Alzheimer's disease, may well be antibodies to pathogens, due to homology between human autoantigens and pathogen proteins. NGF or tau antibodies promote beta-amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, or cholinergic neuronal loss, and, with other autoantibodies, such as anti-ATPase, are potential agents of destruction, whose formation is dictated by sequence homology between pathogen and human proteins, and thus by pathogen strain and human genes. Pathogen elimination in the ageing population and removal of culpable autoantibodies might reduce the incidence and offer hope for a cure in this affliction.\n\nInherited variants in multiple different genes are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). In many of these genes, the inherited variants alter some aspect of the production or clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Thus missense, splice site or duplication mutants in the presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) genes, which alter the levels or shift the balance of Aβ produced, are associated with rare, highly penetrant autosomal dominant forms of Familial Alzheimer&#39;s Disease (FAD). Similarly, the more prevalent late-onset forms of AD are associated with both coding and non-coding variants in genes such as SORL1, PICALM and ABCA7 that affect the production and clearance of Aβ. This review summarises some of the recent molecular and structural work on the role of these genes and the proteins coded by them in the biology of Aβ. We also briefly outline how the emerging knowledge about the pathways involved i...\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly and represents an important and increasing clinical challenge in terms of diagnosis and treatment. This review highlights the role of genetics in understanding the pieces of the complex AD puzzle and summarizes the genes known to be involved in Alzheimer's disease. The amount of risk of Alzheimer's disease that is attributable to genetics is estimated to be |70%. Mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are responsible for early-onset autosomal dominant AD. Although mutations in these genes account for |1% of AD cases, their identification has been crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms of AD. For the more common complex late-onset AD, the 3-4 allele of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been recognized as a major genetic risk factor. More recently, several potential disease risk genes have been identified with the use of advanced genomic methods like genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In the end, the knowledge of the pathophys-iological mechanisms leading to AD will enable the development of more accurate diagnostic tests and new disease-treating strategies. Ó 2012 IMSS.
