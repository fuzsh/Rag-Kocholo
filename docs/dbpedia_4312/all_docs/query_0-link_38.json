Additionally, if needed to remove residue remaining after the product is dried, dissolution in acid followed by cation exchange, then anion exchange, is performed.\n\nSEPARATING HAFNIUM FROM ZIRCONIUM\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLister, B.A.J.; Duncan, J.F.; Hutcheon, J.M.\n\n1956-08-21\n\nSubstantially complete separation of zirconium from hafnium may be obtained by elution of ion exchange material, on which compounds of the elements are adsorbed, with an approximately normal solution of sulfuric acid. Preferably the acid concentration is between 0.8 N amd 1.2 N, amd should not exceed 1.5 N;. Increasing the concentration of sulfate ion in the eluting solution by addition of a soluble sulfate, such as sodium sulfate, has been found to be advantageous. The preferred ion exchange materials are sulfonated polystyrene resins such as Dowex 50,'' and are preferably arranged in a column through which the solutions are passed.\n\nAblation Resistant Zirconium and Hafnium Ceramics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBull, Jeffrey (Inventor); White, Michael J. (Inventor); Kaufman, Larry (Inventor)\n\n1998-01-01\n\nHigh temperature ablation resistant ceramic composites have been made. These ceramics are composites of zirconium diboride and zirconium carbide with silicon carbide, hafnium diboride and hafnium carbide with silicon carbide and ceramic composites which contain mixed diborides and/or carbides of zirconium and hafnium. along with silicon carbide.\n\nHafnium isotope stratigraphy of ferromanganese crusts\n\nPubMed\n\nLee; Halliday; Hein; Burton; Christensen; Gunther\n\n1999-08-13\n\nA Cenozoic record of hafnium isotopic compositions of central Pacific deep water has been obtained from two ferromanganese crusts. The crusts are separated by more than 3000 kilometers but display similar secular variations. Significant fluctuations in hafnium isotopic composition occurred in the Eocene and Oligocene, possibly related to direct advection from the Indian and Atlantic oceans. Hafnium isotopic compositions have remained approximately uniform for the past 20 million years, probably reflecting increased isolation of the central Pacific. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in (87)Sr/(86)Sr in seawater through the Cenozoic apparently had no effect on central Pacific deep-water hafnium.\n\nSEPARATION OF HAFNIUM FROM ZIRCONIUM\n\nDOEpatents\n\nOverholser, L.B.; Barton, C.J. Sr.; Ramsey, J.W.\n\n1960-05-31\n\nThe separation of hafnium impurities from zirconium can be accomplished by means of organic solvent extraction. The hafnium-containing zirconium feed material is dissolved in an aqueous chloride solution and the resulting solution is contacted with an organic hexone phase, with at least one of the phases containing thiocyanate. The hafnium is extracted into the organic phase while zirconium remains in the aqueous phase. Further recovery of zirconium is effected by stripping the onganic phase with a hydrochloric acid solution and commingling the resulting strip solution with the aqueous feed solution. Hexone is recovered and recycled by means of scrubbing the onganic phase with a sulfuric acid solution to remove the hafnium, and thiocyanate is recovered and recycled by means of neutralizing the effluent streams to obtain ammonium thiocyanate.\n\nZirconium and hafnium\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nJones, James V.; Piatak, Nadine M.; Bedinger, George M.; Schulz, Klaus J.; DeYoung,, John H.; Seal, Robert R.; Bradley, Dwight C.\n\n2017-12-19\n\nZirconium and hafnium are corrosion-resistant metals that are widely used in the chemical and nuclear industries. Most zirconium is consumed in the form of the main ore mineral zircon (ZrSiO4, or as zirconium oxide or other zirconium chemicals. Zirconium and hafnium are both refractory lithophile elements that have nearly identical charge, ionic radii, and ionic potentials. As a result, their geochemical behavior is generally similar. Both elements are classified as incompatible because they have physical and crystallochemical properties that exclude them from the crystal lattices of most rock-forming minerals. Zircon and another, less common, ore mineral, baddeleyite (ZrO2), form primarily as accessory minerals in igneous rocks. The presence and abundance of these ore minerals in igneous rocks are largely controlled by the element concentrations in the magma source and by the processes of melt generation and evolution. The worldâs largest primary deposits of zirconium and hafnium are associated with alkaline igneous rocks, and, in one locality on the Kola Peninsula of Murmanskaya Oblast, Russia, baddeleyite is recovered as a byproduct of apatite and magnetite mining. Otherwise, there are few primary igneous deposits of zirconium- and hafnium-bearing minerals with economic value at present. The main ore deposits worldwide are heavy-mineral sands produced by the weathering and erosion of preexisting rocks and the concentration of zircon and other economically important heavy minerals, such as ilmenite and rutile (for titanium), chromite (for chromium), and monazite (for rare-earth elements) in sedimentary systems, particularly in coastal environments. In coastal deposits, heavy-mineral enrichment occurs where sediment is repeatedly reworked by wind, waves, currents, and tidal processes. The resulting heavy-mineral-sand deposits, called placers or paleoplacers, preferentially form at relatively low latitudes on passive continental margins and supply 100 percent of\n\nHafnium Oxide Film Etching Using Hydrogen Chloride Gas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHabuka, Hitoshi; Yamaji, Masahiko; Kobori, Yoshitsugu; Horii, Sadayoshi; Kunii, Yasuo\n\n2009-12-01\n\nHydrogen chloride gas removes the hafnium oxide film formed by atomic layer deposition at the etch rate of about 1 nm/min. A 100 nm-thick hafnium oxide film was perfectly etched off at 1173 K for 60 min by 100% hydrogen chloride gas at 100 sccm. A weight decrease in the hafnium oxide film was observed at temperatures higher than ca. 600 K, which corresponds to the sublimation point of hafnium tetrachloride. The etching by-product is considered to be hafnium tetrachloride. The etching technique developed in this study is expected to be applicable to various processes, such as the cleaning of a hafnium oxide film deposition reactor.\n\nSEPARATING HAFNIUM FROM ZIRCONIUM\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLister, B.A.J.; Duncan, J.F.\n\n1956-08-21\n\nA dilute aqueous solution of zirconyl chloride which is 1N to 2N in HCl is passed through a column of a cation exchange resin in acid form thereby absorbing both zirconium and associated hafnium impurity in the mesin. The cation exchange material with the absorbate is then eluted with aqueous sulfuric acid of a O.8N to 1.2N strength. The first portion of the eluate contains the zirconium substantially free of hafnium.\n\nEffect of cathode cooling efficiency and oxygen plasma gas pressure on the hafnium cathode wall temperature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAshtekar, Koustubh; Diehl, Gregory; Hamer, John\n\n2012-10-01\n\nThe hafnium cathode is widely used in DC plasma arc cutting (PAC) under an oxygen gas environment to cut iron and iron alloys. The hafnium erosion is always a concern which is controlled by the surface temperature. In this study, the effect of cathode cooling efficiency and oxygen gas pressure on the hafnium surface temperature are quantified. The two layer cathode sheath model is applied on the refractive hafnium surface while oxygen species (O2, O, O+, O++, e-) are considered within the thermal dis-equilibrium regime. The system of non-linear equations comprising of current density balance, heat flux balance at both the cathode surface and the sheath-ionization layer is coupled with the plasma gas composition solver. Using cooling heat flux, gas pressure and current density as inputs; the cathode wall temperature, electron temperature, and sheath voltage drop are calculated. Additionally, contribution of emitted electron current (Je) and ions current (Ji) to the total current flux are estimated. Higher gas pressure usually reduces Ji and increases Je that reduces the surface temperature by thermionic cooling.\n\nEvidence for oxygen vacancies movement during wake-up in ferroelectric hafnium oxide\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStarschich, S.; BÃ¶ttger, U.; Menzel, S.\n\nThe wake-up effect which is observed in ferroelectric hafnium oxide is investigated in yttrium doped hafnium oxide prepared by chemical solution deposition. It can be shown that not the amount of cycles but the duration of the applied electrical field is essential for the wake-up. Temperature dependent wake-up cycling in a range of â160âÂ°C to 100âÂ°C reveals a strong temperature activation of the wake-up, which can be attributed to ion rearrangement during cycling. By using asymmetrical electrodes, resistive valence change mechanism switching can be observed coincident with ferroelectric switching. From the given results, it can be concluded that redistribution ofmoreÂ Â» oxygen vacancies is the origin of the wake-up effect.Â«Â less\n\nFormulation and method for preparing gels comprising hydrous hafnium oxide\n\nDOEpatents\n\nCollins, Jack L; Hunt, Rodney D; Montgomery, Frederick C\n\n2013-08-06\n\nFormulations useful for preparing hydrous hafnium oxide gels contain a metal salt including hafnium, an acid, an organic base, and a complexing agent. Methods for preparing gels containing hydrous hafnium oxide include heating a formulation to a temperature sufficient to induce gel formation, where the formulation contains a metal salt including hafnium, an acid, an organic base, and a complexing agent.\n\nSilver-hafnium braze alloy\n\nDOEpatents\n\nStephens, Jr., John J.; Hosking, F. Michael; Yost, Frederick G.\n\n2003-12-16\n\nA binary allow braze composition has been prepared and used in a bonded article of ceramic-ceramic and ceramic-metal materials. The braze composition comprises greater than approximately 95 wt % silver, greater than approximately 2 wt % hafnium and less than approximately 4.1 wt % hafnium, and less than approximately 0.2 wt % trace elements. The binary braze alloy is used to join a ceramic material to another ceramic material or a ceramic material, such as alumina, quartz, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, and mullite, to a metal material, such as iron-based metals, cobalt-based metals, nickel-based metals, molybdenum-based metals, tungsten-based metals, niobium-based metals, and tantalum-based metals. A hermetic bonded article is obtained with a strength greater than 10,000 psi.\n\nHafnium-Based Contrast Agents for X-ray Computed Tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerger, Markus; Bauser, Marcus; Frenzel, Thomas; Hilger, Christoph Stephan; Jost, Gregor; Lauria, Silvia; Morgenstern, Bernd; Neis, Christian; Pietsch, Hubertus; SÃ¼lzle, Detlev; Hegetschweiler, Kaspar\n\n2017-05-15\n\nHeavy-metal-based contrast agents (CAs) offer enhanced X-ray absorption for X-ray computed tomography (CT) compared to the currently used iodinated CAs. We report the discovery of new lanthanide and hafnium azainositol complexes and their optimization with respect to high water solubility and stability. Our efforts culminated in the synthesis of BAY-576, an uncharged hafnium complex with 3:2 stoichiometry and broken complex symmetry. The superior properties of this asymmetrically substituted hafnium CA were demonstrated by a CT angiography study in rabbits that revealed excellent signal contrast enhancement.\n\n40 CFR 471.90 - Applicability; description of the zirconium-hafnium forming subcategory.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... zirconium-hafnium forming subcategory. 471.90 Section 471.90 Protection of Environment ENVIRONMENTAL...

The deposition of stable high-Îº dielectrics [1] such as hafnium silicate and hafnium silicon oxynitride in direct contact with SiGe would simultaneously improve the capacitance of the gate stack and lower the leakage current for high performance SiGe devices. However, the oxidation of the Si_xGe_1-x substrate either during dielectric deposition or post-deposition processing would degrade device performance due to the thermodynamic instability of germanium oxide [2,3]. Results from XPS, HR-TEM, and C-V, and I-V analyses after various annealing treatments will be presented for hafnium silicate and hafnium silicon oxynitride films deposited on strained Si_xGe_1-x(100), and correlated with dielectric-Si_xGe_1-x(100) interface stability. Implications to the introduction of these oxides as viable gate dielectric candidates for SiGe-based CMOS technology will be discussed.

A.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nA simple analytical procedure is described for accurately and precisely determining the zirconium or hafnium content of molybdenum-base alloys. The procedure is based on the reaction of the reagent Arsenazo III with zirconium or hafnium in strong hydrochloric acid solution. The colored complexes of zirconium or hafnium are formed in the presence of molybdenum. Titanium or rhenium in the alloy have no adverse effect on the zirconium or hafnium complex at the following levels in the selected aliquot: Mo, 10 mg; Re, 10 mg; Ti, 1 mg. The spectrophotometric measurement of the zirconium or hafnium complex is accomplished without prior separation with a relative standard deviation of 1.3 to 2.7 percent.\n\nHafnium(IV) chloride complexes with chelating Î²-ketiminate ligands: Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and volatility study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatil, Siddappa A.; Medina, Phillip A.; Antic, Aleks; Ziller, Joseph W.; Vohs, Jason K.; Fahlman, Bradley D.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe synthesis and characterization of four new Î²-ketiminate hafnium(IV) chloride complexes dichloro-bis[4-(phenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4a), dichloro-bis[4-(4-methylphenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4b), dichloro-bis[4-(4-methoxyphenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4c), and dichloro-bis[4-(4-chlorophenylamido)pent-3-en-2-one]-hafnium (4d) are reported. All the complexes (4a-d) were characterized by spectroscopic methods (1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR), and elemental analysis while the compound 4c was further examined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing that the complex is monomer with the hafnium center in octahedral coordination environment and oxygens of the chelating N-O ligands are trans to each other and the chloride ligands are in a cis arrangement. Volatile trends are established for four new Î²-ketiminate hafnium(IV) chloride complexes (4a-d). Sublimation enthalpies (ÎHsub) were calculated from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data, which show that, the dependence of ÎHsub on the molecular weight (4a-c) and inductive effects from chlorine (4d).\n\nHafnium transistor process design for neural interfacing.\n\nPubMed\n\nParent, David W; Basham, Eric J\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA design methodology is presented that uses 1-D process simulations of Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) structures to design the threshold voltage of hafnium oxide based transistors used for neural recording. The methodology is comprised of 1-D analytical equations for threshold voltage specification, and doping profiles, and 1-D MIS Technical Computer Aided Design (TCAD) to design a process to implement a specific threshold voltage, which minimized simulation time. The process was then verified with a 2-D process/electrical TCAD simulation. Hafnium oxide films (HfO) were grown and characterized for dielectric constant and fixed oxide charge for various annealing temperatures, two important design variables in threshold voltage design.\n\nThermochemistry of amorphous and crystalline zirconium and hafnium silicates.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUshakov, S.; Brown, C. E.; Navrotsky, Alexandra; Boatner, L. A.; Demkov, A. A.; Wang, C.; Nguyen, B.-Y.\n\n2003-03-01\n\nCalorimetric investigation of amorphous and crystalline zirconium and hafnium silicates was performed as part of a research program on thermochemistry of alternative gate dielectrics. Amorphous hafnium and zirconium silicates with varying SiO2 content were synthesized by a sol-gel process. Crystalline zirconium and hafnium silicates (zircon and hafnon) were synthesized by solid state reaction at 1450 Â°C from amorphous gels and grown as single crystals from flux. High temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry in lead borate (2PbO.B2O3) solvent at 800 oC was used to measure drop solution enthalpies for amorphous and crystalline zirconium and hafnium silicates and corresponding oxides. Applying appropriate thermochemical cycles, formation enthalpy of crystalline ZrSiO4 (zircon) from binary oxides (baddeleite and quartz) at 298 K was calculated as -23 +/-2 kJ/mol and enthalpy difference between amorphous and crystalline zirconium silicate (vitrification enthalpy) was found to be 61 +/-3 kJ/mol. Crystallization onset temperatures of amorphous zirconium and hafnium silicates, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), increased with silica content. The resulting crystalline phases, as characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), were tetragonal HfO2 and ZrO2. Critical crystallite size for tetragonal to monoclinic transformation of HfO2 in the gel was estimated as 6 +/-2 nm from XRD data Crystallization enthalpies per mole of hafnia and zirconia in gels decrease slightly together with crystallite size with increasing silica content, for example from -22 to -15 +/-1 kJ per mol of HfO2 crystallized at 740 and 1006 Â°C from silicates with 10 and 70 mol Applications of thermal analyses and solution calorimetry techniques together with first-principles density functional calculations to estimate interface and surface energies are discussed.\n\nSimultaneous determination of tantalum and hafnium in silicates by neutron activation analysis\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGreenland, L.P.\n\n1968-01-01\n\nA neutron activation procedure suitable for the routine determination of tantalum and hafnium in silicates is described. The irradiated sample is fused with sodium peroxide and leached, and the insoluble hydroxides are dissolved in dilute hydrofluoric acid-hydrochloric acid. After LaF3 and AgCl scavenges, tantalum and hafnium are separated by anion exchange. Tantalum is obtained radiochemically pure; 233Pa and 95Zr contaminants in the hafnium fraction are resolved by ??-ray spectrometry. The chemical yield of the procedure is detemined after counting by re-irradiation. Values for the 8 U.S. Geological Survey standard rocks are reported. ?? 1968.\n\nThe Hot-Pressing of Hafnium Carbide (Melting Point, 7030 F)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSanders, William A.; Grisaffe, Salvatore J.\n\n1960-01-01\n\nAn investigation was undertaken to determine the effects of the hot-pressing variables (temperature, pressure, and time) on the density and grain size of hafnium carbide disks. The purpose was to provide information necessary for the production of high-density test shapes for the determination of physical and mechanical properties. Hot-pressing of -325 mesh hafnium carbide powder was accomplished with a hydraulic press and an inductively heated graphite die assembly. The ranges investigated for each variable were as follows: temperature, 3500 to 4870 F; pressure, 1000 to 6030 pounds per square inch; and time, 5 to 60 minutes. Hafnium carbide bodies of approximately 98 percent theoretical density can be produced under the following minimal conditions: 4230 F, 3500 pounds per square inch, and 15 minutes. Further increases in temperature and time resulted only in greater grain size.\n\nZirconium and hafnium in the southeastern Atlantic States\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMertie, J.B.\n\n1958-01-01\n\nThe principal source of zirconium and hafnium is zircon, though a minor source is baddeleyite, mined only in Brazil. Zircon is an accessory mineral in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, but rarely occurs in hardrock in minable quantities. The principal sources of zircon are therefore alluvial deposits, which are mined in many countries of five continents. The principal commercial deposits in the United States are in Florida, though others exist elsewhere in the southeastern Coastal Plain. The evidence indicates that conditions for the accumulation of workable deposits of heavy minerals were more favorable during the interglacial stages of the Pleistocene epoch than during Recent time. Therefore detrital ores of large volume and high tenor are more likely to be found in the terrace deposits than along the present beaches. Other concentrations of heavy minerals, however, are possible at favored sites close to the Fall Line where the Tuscaloosa formation rests upon the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont province. A score of heavy and semiheavy minerals occur in the detrital deposits of Florida, but the principal salable minerals are ilmenite, leucoxene, rutile, and zircon, though monazite and staurolite are saved at some mining plants. Commercial deposits of heavy minerals are generally required to have a tenor of 4 percent, though ores with a lower tenor can be mined at a profit if the content of monazite is notably high. The percentages of zircon in the concentrates ranges from 10 to 16 percent, and in eastern Florida from 13 to 15 percent. Thus the tenor in zircon of the ore-bearing sands ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 percent. The content of hafnium in zircon is immaterial for many uses, but for some purposes very high or very low tenors in hafnium are required. Alluvial zircon cannot be separated into such varieties, which, if needed, must be obtained from sources in bedrock. It thus becomes necessary to determine the Hf : Zr ratios in zircon from many kinds of\n\nWork functions of hafnium nitride thin films as emitter material for field emitter arrays\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGotoh, Yasuhito, E-mail: gotoh.yasuhito.5w@kyoto-u.ac.jp; Fujiwara, Sho; Tsuji, Hiroshi\n\nThe work functions of hafnium nitride thin films prepared by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering were investigated in vacuum, before and after surface cleaning processes, with a view of improving the properties of as-fabricated field emitter arrays comprising hafnium nitride emitters. The measurement of the work function was first performed for the as-deposited films and then for films subjected to surface cleaning process, either thermal treatment or ion bombardment. Thermal treatment at a maximum temperature of 300âÂ°C reduced the work function by 0.7âeV. Once the film was heated, the work function maintained the reduced value, even after cooling to room temperature. AmoreÂ Â» little change in the work function was observed for the second and third thermal treatments. The ion bombardment was conducted by exposing the sample to a thin plasma for different sample bias conditions and processing times. When the sample was biased at â10âV, the work function decreased by 0.6âeV. The work function reduction became saturated in the early stage of the ion bombardment. When the sample was biased at â50âV, the work function exhibited different behaviors, that is, first it decreased rapidly and then increased in response to the increase in processing time. The lowest attainable work function was found to be 4.00âeV. It should be noted that none of the work function values reported in this paper were obtained using surfaces that were demonstrated to be free from oxygen contamination. The present results suggest that the currentâvoltage characteristics of a field emitter array can be improved by a factor of 25â50 by the examined postprocesses.Â«Â less\n\nSeparation of Zirconium and Hafnium: A Review\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, L.; Xiao, Y.; van Sandwijk, A.; Xu, Q.; Yang, Y.\n\nZirconium is an ideal material for nuclear reactors due to its low absorption cross-section for thermal neutrons, whereas the typically contained hafnium with strong neutron-absorption is very harmful for zirconium. This paper provides an overview of the processes for separating hafnium from zirconium. The separation processes are roughly classified into hydro- and pyrometallurgical routes. The current dominant zirconium production route involves pyrometallurgical ore cracking, multi-step hydrometallurgical liquid-liquid extraction for hafnium removal and the reduction of zirconium tetrachloride to the pure metal by the Kroll process. The lengthy hydrometallurgical Zr-Hf separation operations leads to high production cost, intensive labour and heavy environmental burden. Using a compact pyrometallurgical separation method can simplify the whole production flowsheet with a higher process efficiency. The known separation methods are discussed based on the following reaction features: redox characteristics, volatility, electrochemical properties and molten salt extraction. The commercially operating extractive distillation process is a significant advance in Zr-Hf separation technology but it suffers from high process maintenance cost. The recently developed new process based on molten salt-metal equilibrium for Zr-Hf separation shows a great potential for industrial application, which is compact for nuclear grade zirconium production starting from crude ore. In the present paper, the available separation technologies are compared. The advantages and disadvantages as well as future directions of research and development for nuclear grade zirconium production are discussed.\n\nHigh P-T phase transitions and P-V-T equation of state of hafnium\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHrubiak, Rostislav; Drozd, Vadym; Karbasi, Ali\n\n2016-07-29\n\nWe measured the volume of hafnium at several pressures up to 67 GPa and at temperatures between 300 to 780 K using a resistively heated diamond anvil cell with synchrotron x-ray diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source. The measured data allows us to determine the P-V-T equation of state of hafnium. The previously described [Xia et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, 6736-6738 (1990)] phase transition from hcp ({alpha}) to simple hexagonal ({omega}) phase at 38 GPa at room temperature was not observed even up to 51 GPa. The {omega} phase was only observed at elevated temperatures. Our measurements have alsomoreÂ Â» improved the experimental constraint on the high P-T phase boundary between the {omega} phase and high pressure bcc ({beta}) phase of hafnium. Isothermal room temperature bulk modulus and its pressure derivative for the {alpha}-phase of hafnium were measured to be B{sub 0} = 112.9{+-}0.5 GPa and B{sub 0}'=3.29{+-}0.05, respectively. P-V-T data for the {alpha}-phase of hafnium was used to obtain a fit to a thermodynamic P-V-T equation of state based on model by Brosh et al.

The DC gain of a common source amplifier is correlated to the structural properties of a Field Effect Transistor (FET) and a Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) capacitor. This approach allows a transistor designer to use a design flow that starts with simple and intuitive 1-D equations for gain that can be verified in 1-D MIS capacitor TCAD simulations, before final TCAD process verification of transistor properties. The DC gain of a common source amplifier is optimized by using fast 1-D simulations and using slower, complex 2-D simulations only for verification. The 1-D equations are used to show that the increased dielectric constant of hafnium oxide allows a higher DC gain for a given oxide thickness. An additional benefit is that the MIS capacitor can be employed to test additional performance parameters important to an open gate transistor such as dielectric stability and ionic penetration.\n\nEtude de la nitruration carbothermique du dioxyde de hafnium par diffraction X Ã haute tempÃ©rature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPialoux, A.\n\n1993-03-01\n\nThe carbothermal reduction of hafnium dioxide under atmospheric level nitrogen pressure has been investigated using a graphite resistance high temperature X-ray diffractometer up to around 2300 K. A carbon transfer reaction through the gaseous phase (N 2, CO/CO 2) is shown to precede, then to compete the direct reduction of the hafnium oxide by the graphite in pure nitrogen. A complex mechanism has been found that accounts for the formation of hafnium dioxynitride and possibly of three other hafnium oxynitrides, then of hafnium mononitride and hafnium monocarbonitride, along two different steps between 1613 and 1923 K. An evaluation has been made concerning the composition of these Î³ 1- HfO 2-xN x/2â¡ x/2 (CaF 2-type structure), Î³ 2- Hf 7O 11N 2, Î³ 3- Hf 7O 8N 4 (rhombohedral), Î³ 4- Hf 2ON 2 (Mn 2O 3-type structure), HfN and HfN 1-zC z (NaCl-type structure) phases, considering the variations of their lattice parameters and the available data in the literature, especially on the isomorphous compounds of zirconium. It must be emphasized the new Î³ 1- HfO 2-xN x/2 phase, the dilatation of which is linear ( overlineÎ± = 12Ã10 -6K -1), shows a constant composition from 2158 down to 1473 K (x â 0,2). But under 1473 K, inevitably, the hafnium dioxynitride disappears, and poorly crystallized monoclinic Î±HfO 2 and rhombohedral Î³ 2- Hf 7O 11N 2 are formed.\n\nRF sputtered silicon and hafnium nitrides as applied to 440C steel\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGrill, A.; Aron, P. R.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nSilicon nitride and hafnium nitride coatings were deposited on oxidized and unoxidized 440C stainless steel substrates. Sputtering was done in mixtures of argon and nitrogen gases from pressed powder silicon nitride and from hafnium metal targets. The coatings and the interface between the coating and substrate were investigated by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and Auger electron spectroscopy. Oxide was found at all interfaces with an interface width of at least 600 A for the oxidized substrates and at least 300 A for the unoxidized substrates. Scratch test results demonstrate that the adhesion of hafnium nitride to both oxidized and unoxidized 440C is superior to that of silicon nitride. Oxidized 440C is found to have increased adhesion, to both nitrides, over that of unoxidized 440C. Coatings of both nitrides deposited at 8 mtorr were found to have increased adhesion to both oxidized and unoxidized 440C over those deposited at 20 mtorr.\n\nTensile and stress-rupture behavior of hafnium carbide dispersed molybdenum and tungsten base alloy wires\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nYun, Hee Mann; Titran, Robert H.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe tensile strain rate sensitivity and the stress-rupture strength of Mo-base and W-base alloy wires, 380 microns in diameter, were determined over the temperature range from 1200 K to 1600 K. Three molybdenum alloy wires; Mo + 1.1w/o hafnium carbide (MoHfC), Mo + 25w/o W + 1.1w/o hafnium carbide (MoHfC+25W) and Mo + 45w/o W + 1.1w/o hafnium carbide (MoHfC+45W), and a W + 0.4w/o hafnium carbide (WHfC) tungsten alloy wire were evaluated. The tensile strength of all wires studied was found to have a positive strain rate sensitivity. The strain rate dependency increased with increasing temperature and is associated with grain broadening of the initial fibrous structures. The hafnium carbide dispersed W-base and Mo-base alloys have superior tensile and stress-rupture properties than those without HfC. On a density compensated basis the MoHfC wires exhibit superior tensile and stress-rupture strengths to the WHfC wires up to approximately 1400 K. Addition of tungsten in the Mo-alloy wires was found to increase the long-term stress rupture strength at temperatures above 1400 K. Theoretical calculations indicate that the strength and ductility advantage of the HfC dispersed alloy wires is due to the resistance to recrystallization imparted by the dispersoid.\n\nMineral resource of the month: zirconium and hafnium\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nGambogi, Joseph\n\n2007-01-01\n\nZirconium and hafnium are corrosion-resistant metals that are grouped in the same family as titanium on the periodic table.

HfO{sub 2} is currently being studied as a possible replacement for Silicon Oxide (SiO{sub 2}) as a gate dielectric in electronics transistors. XPS spectra were collected on a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe using a monochromatic Al K{sub a} X-ray (1486.7 eV) excitation source. The sample was analyzed under the following conditions: as received, after UV irradiation for five minutes, and after sputter cleaning with 2moreÂ Â» kV Ar{sup +} ions for 180 seconds. Survey scans showed carbon, oxygen, and hafnium as the major species in the film, while the only minor species of argon and carbide was detected after sputtering. Adventitious carbon initially composed approximately 18.6 AT% of the surface, but after UV cleaning it was reduced to 2.4 AT%. This demonstrated that that the majority of carbon was due to adventitious carbon. However, after 2 kV Ar{sup +} sputtering there was still only trace amounts of carbon at {approx}1 AT%, Some of this trace carbon is now in the form of a carbide due to the interaction with Ar{sup +} used for sputter cleaning. Furthermore, the stoiciometric ratio of oxygen and hafnium is consistent with a high quality HfO{sub 2} film.Â«Â less\n\nLow-voltage bendable pentacene thin-film transistor with stainless steel substrate and polystyrene-coated hafnium silicate dielectric.\n\nPubMed\n\nYun, Dong-Jin; Lee, Seunghyup; Yong, Kijung; Rhee, Shi-Woo\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe hafnium silicate and aluminum oxide high-k dielectrics were deposited on stainless steel substrate using atomic layer deposition process and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and polystyrene (PS) were treated improve crystallinity of pentacene grown on them. Besides, the effects of the pentacene deposition condition on the morphologies, crystallinities and electrical properties of pentacene were characterized. Therefore, the surface treatment condition on dielectric and pentacene deposition conditions were optimized. The pentacene grown on polystyrene coated high-k dielectric at low deposition rate and temperature (0.2-0.3 Ã /s and R.T.) showed the largest grain size (0.8-1.0 Î¼m) and highest crystallinity among pentacenes deposited various deposition conditions, and the pentacene TFT with polystyrene coated high-k dielectric showed excellent device-performance. To decrease threshold voltage of pentacene TFT, the polystyrene-thickness on high-k dielectric was controlled using different concentration of polystyrene solution. As the polystyrene-thickness on hafnium silicate decreases, the dielectric constant of polystyrene/hafnium silicate increases, while the crystallinity of pentacene grown on polystyrene/hafnium silicate did not change. Using low-thickness polystyrene coated hafnium silicate dielectric, the high-performance and low voltage operating (<5 V) pentacene thin film transistor (Î¼: ~2 cm(2)/(V s), on/off ratio, >1 Ã 10(4)) and complementary inverter (DC gains, ~20) could be fabricated.\n\nAtomic layer deposition and characterization of hafnium oxide grown on silicon from tetrakis(diethylamino)hafnium and water vapor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeshpande, Anand; Inman, Ronald; Jursich, Gregory; Takoudis, Christos\n\n2004-09-01\n\nIn this work thin films of hafnium oxide are deposited on Si(100) substrates by means of atomic layer deposition (ALD) using tetrakis(diethylamino)hafnium and water vapor at substrate temperatures of 250-350ÂºC. Our system capabilities include fast transient delivery of reactive fluids, real-time vapor phase detection (in situ tunable diode laser hygrometer), precursor thermochemical capabilities, and ppt level elemental analysis by inductive coupling plasma mass spectrometry. The composition, purity, and other properties of the films and resulting interfaces are determined using x-ray and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies, Z-contrast imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope with AË scale resolution, and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The observed ALD rate is ~1.4 AË per cycle. The nonuniformity across the film is less than 4%. Negligible carbon contamination is found in the resulting stoichiometric films under all conditions studied. The pulse sequence was optimized to prevent disastrous particulate problems while still minimizing purge times. The film deposition is investigated as a function of substrate temperature and reagent pulsing characteristics. A mild inverse temperature dependence of the ALD rate is observed. The initial stage of the HfO2 growth is investigated in detail.\n\nReview of anhydrous zirconium-hafnium separation techniques. Information circular/1984\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSkaggs, R.L.; Rogers, D.T.; Hunter, D.B.\n\n1983-12-01\n\nSixteen nonaqueous techniques conceived to replace the current aqueous scheme for separating hafnium and zirconium tetrachlorides were reviewed and evaluated by the Bureau of Mines. The methods are divided into two classes: separation by fractional volatilization of the tetrachlorides, which takes advantage of the higher volatility of hafnium tetrachloride; and separation by chemical techniques, based on differences in chemical behavior of the two tetrachlorides. The criteria used to evaluate separation methods were temperature, pressure, separation factor per equilibrium stage, complexity, compatibility with existing technology, and potential for continuous operation. Three processes were selected as being most promising: (1) high-pressure distillation,moreÂ Â» (2) extractive distillation from a molten salt, and (3) preferential reduction of gaseous ZrCl4. Any of the proposed nonaqueous Hf-Zr separation schemes must be supplemented with additional purification to remove trace impurities.Â«Â less\n\nDevelopment and characterization of ultrathin hafnium titanates as high permittivity gate insulators\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Min\n\nHigh permittivity or high-kappa materials are being developed for use as gate insulators for future ultrascaled metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). Hafnium containing compounds are the leading candidates. Due to its moderate permittivity, however, it is difficult to achieve HfO2 gate structures with an EOT well below 1.0 nm. One approach to increase HfO2 permittivity is combining it with a very high-kappa material, such as TiO2. In this thesis, we systematically studied the electrical and physical characteristics of high-kappa hafnium titanates films as gate insulators. A series of HfxTi1-xO2 films with well-controlled composition were deposited using an MOCVD system. The physical properties of the films were analyzed using a variety of characterization techniques. X-ray micro diffraction indicates that the Ti-rich thin film is more immune to crystallization. TEM analysis showed that the thick stoichiometric HfTiO 4 film has an orthorhombic structure and large anisotropic grains. The C-V curves from the devices with the hafnium titanates films displayed relatively low hysteresis. In a certain composition range, the interfacial layer (IL) EOT and permittivity of HfxTi1-x O2 increases linearly with increasing Ti. The charge is negative for HfxTi1-xO2/IL and positive for Si/IL interface, and the magnitude increases as Hf increases. For ultra-thin films (less than 2 nm EOT), the leakage current increases with increasing HE Moreover, the Hf-rich sample has weaker temperature dependence of the current. In the MOSFET devices with the hafnium titanates films, normal transistor characteristics were observed, also electron mobility degradation. Next, we investigated the effects that different pre-deposition surface treatments, including HF dipping, NH3 surface nitridation, and HfO2 deposition, have on the electrical properties of hafnium titanates. Surface nitridation shows stronger effect than the thin HfO2 layer. The nitrided samples displayed a\n\nEffect of hafnium doping on density of states in dual-target magnetron co-sputtering HfZnSnO thin film transistors\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHuang, Chuan-Xin; Li, Jun, E-mail: SHUniverjunli@163.com; Fu, Yi-Zhou\n\n2015-11-23\n\nThis study investigates the effect of hafnium doping on the density of states (DOSs) in HfZnSnO thin film transistors fabricated by dual-target magnetron co-sputtering system. The DOSs is extracted by temperature-dependent field-effect measurements, and they decrease from 1.1âÃâ10{sup 17} to 4.6âÃâ10{sup 16â}eV/cm{sup 3} with increasing the hafnium concentrations. The behavior of DOSs for the increasing hafnium concentration HfZnSnO thin film transistors can be confirmed by both the reduction of ÎV{sub T} under bias stress and the trapping charges calculated by capacitance voltage measurements. It suggests that the reduction in DOSs due to the hafnium doping is closely related with themoreÂ Â» bias stability and thermal stability.Â«Â less\n\nHafnium germanosilicate thin films for gate and capacitor dielectric applications: thermal stability studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAddepalli, Swarna; Sivasubramani, Prasanna; El-Bouanani, Mohamed; Kim, Moon; Gnade, Bruce; Wallace, Robert\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe use of SiO_2-GeO2 mixtures in gate and capacitor dielectric applications is hampered by the inherent thermodynamic instability of germanium oxide. Studies to date have confirmed that germanium oxide is readily converted to elemental germanium [1,2]. In sharp contrast, germanium oxide is known to form stable compounds with transition metal oxides such as hafnium oxide (hafnium germanate, HfGeO_4) [3]. Thus, the incorporation of hafnium in SiO_2-GeO2 may be expected to enhance the thermal stability of germanium oxide via Hf-O-Ge bond formation. In addition, the introduction of a transition metal would simultaneously enhance the capacitance of the dielectric thereby permitting a thicker dielectric which reduces leakage current [4]. In this study, the thermal stability of PVD-grown hafnium germanosilicate (HfGeSiO) films was investigated. XPS, HR-TEM, C-V and I-V results of films after deposition and subsequent annealing treatments will be presented. The results indicate that the presence or formation of elemental germanium drastically affects the stability of the HfGeSiO films.

R.\n\nThe Cu/Hf interface has been characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thin films (thicknesses ranging from 100 nm to 150 nm) of hafnium were deposited on a silicon substrate. About 80 nm of copper was then deposited on such samples. The e-beam method was used for the deposition. The samples were annealed for 30 min at temperatures of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500Â°C. The inter-diffusion of copper and hafnium was investigated by sequential sputter depth profiling and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The interdiffusion in each case was analyzed by the Matano-Boltzmann's procedure using the Fick's second law. The interdiffusion coefficients and the width of the interface as determined from the data have been correlated with the annealing temperature.

The detectors were calibrated to the fission rate of U-235 using calibrated fission chambers; the calibration factors were tested in two reactors in steady state and found to be consistent. Calibration of the detectors in transient reactor conditions was done by using uranium wires that were analyzed by radiochemistry techniques to determine total fissions during the transient. This was correlated to the time-integrated current of the detectors during the transient. A temperature correction factor was derived to account for self-shielding effects in the hafnium and gadolinium detectors. The dynamic response of the detectors under transient conditions was studied, and found to be excellent.\n\n\"Decarbonization\" of an imino N-heterocyclic carbene via triple benzyl migration from hafnium\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nAn imino N-heterocyclic carbene underwent three sequential benzyl migrations upon reaction with tetrabenzylhafnium, resulting in complete removal of the carbene carbon from the ligand.

In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, 2D ferroelectric memories with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the channel material and aluminum doped HfO2 as the ferroelectric gate dielectric. A 16 nm thick layer of HfO2, doped with 5.26% aluminum, was deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), then subjected to rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 1000 Â°C, and the polarization-voltage characteristics of the resulting metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitors were measured, showing a remnant polarization of 0.6 Î¼C/cm2. Ferroelectric memories with embedded ferroelectric hafnium oxide stacks and monolayer MoS2 were fabricated. The transfer characteristics after program and erase pulses revealed a clear ferroelectric memory window. In addition, endurance (up to 10,000 cycles) of the devices were tested and effects associated with ferroelectric materials, such as the wake-up effect and polarization fatigue, were observed. This research can potentially lead to advances of 2D materials in low-power logic and memory applications.\n\nHafnium-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with ionizing radiation for lung cancer treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Min-Hua; Hanagata, Nobutaka; Ikoma, Toshiyuki; Huang, Jian-Yuan; Li, Keng-Yuan; Lin, Chun-Pin; Lin, Feng-Huei\n\n2016-06-01\n\nRecently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the new clinical options by generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. However, the optical approach of PDT is limited by tissue penetration depth of visible light. In this study, we propose that a ROS-enhanced nanoparticle, hafnium-doped hydroxyapatite (Hf:HAp), which is a material to yield large quantities of ROS inside the cells when the nanoparticles are bombarded with high penetrating power of ionizing radiation. Hf:HAp nanoparticles are generated by wet chemical precipitation with total doping concentration of 15mol% Hf(4+) relative to Ca(2+) in HAp host material. The results show that the HAp particles could be successfully doped with Hf ions, resulted in the formation of nano-sized rod-like shape and with pH-dependent solubility. The impact of ionizing radiation on Hf:HAp nanoparticles is assessed by using in-vitro and in-vivo model using A549 cell line. The 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) results reveal that after being exposed to gamma rays, Hf:HAp could significantly lead to the formation of ROS in cells. Both cell viability (WST-1) and cytotoxicity (LDH) assay show the consistent results that A549 lung cancer cell lines are damaged with changes in the cells' ROS level. The in-vivo studies further demonstrate that the tumor growth is inhibited owing to the cells apoptosis when Hf:HAp nanoparticles are bombarded with ionizing radiation. This finding offer a new therapeutic method of interacting with ionizing radiation and demonstrate the potential of Hf:HAp nanoparticles in tumor treatment, such as being used in a palliative treatment after lung surgical procedure. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the new clinical options by generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, the approach of PDT is usually limited to the treatment of systemic disease and deeper tumor, due to the limited tissue penetration depth of visible\n\nHafnium nitride buffer layers for growth of GaN on silicon\n\nDOEpatents\n\nArmitage, Robert D.; Weber, Eicke R.\n\n2005-08-16\n\nGallium nitride is grown by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy on (111) and (001) silicon substrates using hafnium nitride buffer layers.

The synthesis was carried out by the precipitation route by using hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl4) as precursor material with potassium hydroxide (KOH) dissolved in Millipore water. In the precipitation technique, the chemical reaction is comparatively simple, low-cost and non-toxic compared to other synthetic methods. The synthesized HfO2 NPs were characterized by using powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Raman analysis, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The monoclinic structure of the HfO2 NPs was resolved utilizing x-ray diffraction (XRD). The optical properties were studied from the UV-Vis absorption spectrum. The optical band gap of the HfO2NPs was observed to be 5.1 eV. The Raman spectrum shows the presence of HfO2 NPs. The HRTEM image showed that the HfO2 NPs were of spherical shape with an average particle size of around 28 nm. The energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum obviously demonstrated the presence of HfO2 NPs. Analysis and studies on the dielectric properties of the HfO2 NPs such as the dielectric constant, the dielectric loss, and alternating current (AC) conductivity were carried out at varying frequencies and temperatures.\n\nHafnium isotope evidence for a transition in the dynamics of continental growth 3.2 Gyr ago.\n\nPubMed\n\nNÃ¦raa, T; ScherstÃ©n, A; Rosing, M T; Kemp, A I S; Hoffmann, J E; Kokfelt, T F; Whitehouse, M J\n\n2012-05-30\n\nEarth's lithosphere probably experienced an evolution towards the modern plate tectonic regime, owing to secular changes in mantle temperature. Radiogenic isotope variations are interpreted as evidence for the declining rates of continental crustal growth over time, with some estimates suggesting that over 70% of the present continental crustal reservoir was extracted by the end of the Archaean eon. Patterns of crustal growth and reworking in rocks younger than three billion years (Gyr) are thought to reflect the assembly and break-up of supercontinents by Wilson cycle processes and mark an important change in lithosphere dynamics. In southern West Greenland numerous studies have, however, argued for subduction settings and crust growth by arc accretion back to 3.8 Gyr ago, suggesting that modern-day tectonic regimes operated during the formation of the earliest crustal rock record. Here we report in situ uranium-lead, hafnium and oxygen isotope data from zircons of basement rocks in southern West Greenland across the critical time period during which modern-like tectonic regimes could have initiated. Our data show pronounced differences in the hafnium isotope-time patterns across this interval, requiring changes in the characteristics of the magmatic protolith. The observations suggest that 3.9-3.5-Gyr-old rocks differentiated from a >3.9-Gyr-old source reservoir with a chondritic to slightly depleted hafnium isotope composition. In contrast, rocks formed after 3.2 Gyr ago register the first additions of juvenile depleted material (that is, new mantle-derived crust) since 3.9 Gyr ago, and are characterized by striking shifts in hafnium isotope ratios similar to those shown by Phanerozoic subduction-related orogens. These data suggest a transitional period 3.5-3.2 Gyr ago from an ancient (3.9-3.5 Gyr old) crustal evolutionary regime unlike that of modern plate tectonics to a geodynamic setting after 3.2 Gyr ago that involved juvenile crust generation by plate\n\nSlow DNA Transport through Nanopores in Hafnium Oxide Membranes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBell, David C.; Cohen-Karni, Tzahi; Rosenstein, Jacob K.; Wanunu, Meni\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe present a study of double- and single-stranded DNA transport through nanopores fabricated in ultrathin (2â7 nm thick) free-standing hafnium oxide (HfO2) membranes.

Mean DNA velocities are slower than velocities through comparable silicon nitride pores, providing evidence that HfO2 nanopores have favorable physicochemical interactions with nucleic acids that can be leveraged to slow down DNA in a nanopore.

This is primarily due to its high dielectric constant, Îº, of 25. Samples of HfO2 were grown by either atomic layer deposition (ALD) or pulsed laser deposition (PLD), with the PLD samples having assorted substrate temperatures during deposition (300 C, 500 C, and 750 C). Cathodoluminescence (CL) was chosen as the technique used for studying these HfO2 samples. The CL system used was capable of beam energies ranging from 1 keV to 20 keV and beam currents ranging from 10 Î¼A to 50 Î¼A. A Monte Carlo calculation using CASINO software was performed in order to determine the beam energy for the desired depth of penetration. Measurements were taken at sample temperatures ranging from 7K (closed cycled cryostat) to 300K (room temperature), as well as at various beam energies and beam currents. Comparison will be made between the PLD and ALD spectra.\n\nSelf-cleaning and surface chemical reactions during hafnium dioxide atomic layer deposition on indium arsenide.\n\nPubMed\n\nTimm, Rainer; Head, Ashley R; Yngman, Sofie; Knutsson, Johan V; Hjort, Martin; McKibbin, Sarah R; Troian, Andrea; Persson, Olof; Urpelainen, Samuli; Knudsen, Jan; Schnadt, Joachim; Mikkelsen, Anders\n\n2018-04-12\n\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) enables the ultrathin high-quality oxide layers that are central to all modern metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits. Crucial to achieving superior device performance are the chemical reactions during the first deposition cycle, which could ultimately result in atomic-scale perfection of the semiconductor-oxide interface. Here, we directly observe the chemical reactions at the surface during the first cycle of hafnium dioxide deposition on indium arsenide under realistic synthesis conditions using photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that the widely used ligand exchange model of the ALD process for the removal of native oxide on the semiconductor and the simultaneous formation of the first hafnium dioxide layer must be significantly revised. Our study provides substantial evidence that the efficiency of the self-cleaning process and the quality of the resulting semiconductor-oxide interface can be controlled by the molecular adsorption process of the ALD precursors, rather than the subsequent oxide formation.\n\nCharacteristics of laser produced plasmas of hafnium and tantalum in the 1-7 nm region\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Bowen; Otsuka, Takamitsu; Sokell, Emma; Dunne, Padraig; O'Sullivan, Gerry; Hara, Hiroyuki; Arai, Goki; Tamura, Toshiki; Ono, Yuichi; Dinh, Thanh-Hung; Higashiguchi, Takeshi\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSoft X-ray (SXR) spectra from hafnium and tantalum laser produced plasmas were recorded in the 1-7 nm region using two Nd:YAG lasers with pulse lengths of 170 ps and 10 ns, respectively, operating at a range of power densities. The maximum focused peak power density was 2. 3 Ã 1014 W cm-2 for 170 ps pulses and 1. 8 Ã 1012 W cm-2 for 10 ns pulses, respectively. Two intense quasicontinuous intensity bands resulting from n = 4 - n = 4 and n = 4 - n = 5 unresolved transition arrays (UTAs) dominate both sets of experimental spectra. Comparison with calculations performed with the Cowan suite of atomic structure codes as well as consideration of previous experimental and theoretical results aided identification of the most prominent features in the spectra. For the 10 ns spectrum, the highest ion stage that could be identified from the n = 4 - n = 5 arrays were lower than silver-like Hf25+ and Ta26+ (which has a 4 d 104 f ground configuration) indicating that the plasma temperature attained was too low to produce ions with an outermost 4 d subshell, while for the 170 ps plasmas the presence of significantly higher stages was deduced and lines due to 4 d-5 p transitions were clearly evident. Furthermore, we show an enhancement of emission from tantalum using dual laser irradiation, and the effect of pre-pulse durations and delay times between two pulses are demonstrated.\n\nAminopyridinate-FI hybrids, their hafnium and titanium complexes, and their application in the living polymerization of 1-hexene.\n\nPubMed\n\nHaas, Isabelle; Dietel, Thomas; Press, Konstantin; Kol, Moshe; Kempe, Rhett\n\n2013-10-11\n\nBased on two well-established ligand systems, the aminopyridinato (Ap) and the phenoxyimine (FI) ligand systems, new Ap-FI hybrid ligands were developed. Four different Ap-FI hybrid ligands were synthesized through a simple condensation reaction and fully characterized. The reaction of hafnium tetrabenzyl with all four Ap-FI hybrid ligands exclusively led to mono(Ap-FI) complexes of the type [(Ap-FI)HfBn2 ]. The ligands acted as tetradentate dianionic chelates. Upon activation with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, the hafnium-dibenzyl complexes led to highly active catalysts for the polymerization of 1-hexene. Ultrahigh molecular weights and extremely narrow polydispersities support the living nature of this polymerization process. A possible deactivation product of the hafnium catalysts was characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis and is discussed. The coordination modes of these new ligands were studied with the help of model titanium complexes. The reaction of titanium(IV) isopropoxide with ligand 1 led to a mono(Ap-FI) complex, which showed the desired fac-mer coordination mode. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide reacted with ligand 4 to give a complex of the type [(ApH-FI)2 Ti(OiPr)2 ], which featured the ligand in its monoanionic form. The two titanium complexes were characterized by X-ray crystal-structure analysis. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Results of photoluminescence (PL) measurements show the existence of two distinct regions: one that is related to the blue emission originating from oxygen vacancy defects in HfO2 and the other one characterized with a series of sharp orange-red emission peaks related to f-f transitions of Eu3+ from excited level 5D0 to lower levels 7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). PL peaks appearing in excitation spectra of obtained coatings are attributed either to charge transfer state of Eu3+ or to direct excitation of the Eu3+ ground state 7F0 into higher levels of the 4f-manifold. PL of formed coatings increases with PEO time due to an increase of oxygen vacancy defects and the content of Eu3+. Acquired experimental data suggest that hypersensitive electrical dipole transition is much more intense than the magnetic dipole transition, indicating that Eu3+ ions occupy a non-inversion symmetry sites.\n\nProcessing and characterization of boron carbide-hafnium diboride ceramics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrown-Shaklee, Harlan James\n\nHafnium diboride based ceramics are promising candidate materials for advanced aerospace and nuclear reactor components. The effectiveness of boron carbide and carbon as HfB2 sintering additives was systematically evaluated. In the first stage of the research, boron carbide and carbon additives were found to improve the densification behavior of milled HfB2 powder in part by removing oxides at the HfB2 surface during processing. Boron carbide additives reduced the hot pressing temperature of HfB2 by 150Â°C compared to carbon, which reduced the hot pressing temperature by Ë50Â°C. Reduction of oxide impurities alone could not explain the difference in sintering enhancement, however, and other mechanisms of enhancement were evaluated. Boron carbides throughout the homogeneity range were characterized to understand other mechanisms of sintering enhancement in HfB2. Heavily faulted carbon rich and boron rich boron carbides were synthesized for addition to HfB2. The greatest enhancement to densification was observed in samples containing boron- and carbon-rich compositions whereas B6.5 C provided the least enhancement to densification. It is proposed that carbon rich and boron rich boron carbides create boron and hafnium point defects in HfB2, respectively, which facilitate densification. Evaluation of the thermal conductivity (kth) between room temperature and 2000Â°C suggested that the stoichiometry of the boron carbide additives did not significantly affect kth of HfB2-BxC composites. The improved sinterability and the high kth (Ë110 W/m-K at 300K and Ë90 W/m-K at 1000Â°C ) of HfB2-BxC ceramics make them excellent candidates for isotopically enriched reactor control materials.\n\nMetalâOrganic Nanosheets Formed via Defect-Mediated Transformation of a Hafnium MetalâOrganic Framework\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe report a hafnium-containing MOF, hcp UiO-67(Hf), which is a ligand-deficient layered analogue of the face-centered cubic fcu UiO-67(Hf). hcp UiO-67 accommodates its lower ligand:metal ratio compared to fcu UiO-67 through a new structural mechanism: the formation of a condensed âdouble clusterâ (Hf12O8(OH)14), analogous to the condensation of coordination polyhedra in oxide frameworks. In oxide frameworks, variable stoichiometry can lead to more complex defect structures, e.g., crystallographic shear planes or modules with differing compositions, which can be the source of further chemical reactivity; likewise, the layered hcp UiO-67 can react further to reversibly form a two-dimensional metalâorganic framework, hxl UiO-67. Both three-dimensional hcp UiO-67 and two-dimensional hxl UiO-67 can be delaminated to form metalâorganic nanosheets. Delamination of hcp UiO-67 occurs through the cleavage of strong hafnium-carboxylate bonds and is effected under mild conditions, suggesting that defect-ordered MOFs could be a productive route to porous two-dimensional materials.

Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen into this pseudo-binary alloy has been shown to improve their thermal stability, electrical properties, and reduce dopant penetration. Because CMOS processing requires high temperature anneals (up to 1050Â°C), it is important to understand the diffusion properties of any metal associated with the gate dielectric in silicon at these temperatures. In addition, dopant penetration from the doped polysilicon gate into the Si channel at these temperatures must also be studied. Impurity outdiffusion (Hf, Zr) from the dielectric, or dopant (B, As, P) penetration through the dielectric into the channel region would likely result in deleterious effects upon the carrier mobility. In this dissertation extensive thermal stability studies of alternate gate dielectric candidates ZrSixOy and HfSixO y are presented. Dopant penetration studies from doped-polysilicon through HfSixOy and HfSixOyNz are also presented. Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS), Heavy Ion RBS (HI-RBS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM), and Time of Flight and Dynamic Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS, D-SIMS) methods were used to characterize these materials. The dopant diffusivity is calculated by modeling of the dopant profiles in the Si substrate. In this disseration is reported that Hf silicate films are more stable than Zr silicate films, from the metal interdiffusion point of view. On the other hand, dopant (B, As, and P) penetration is observed for HfSixO y films. However, the addition of nitrogen to the Hf - Si - O systems improves the dopant penetration properties of the resulting HfSi xOyNz films.\n\nHafnium, Tungsten, and the Differentiation of the Moon and Mars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTaylor, G. J.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nMeasurements of the isotopic composition of tungsten (W) show that lunar samples and Martian meteorites have an excess of W-182. This was produced by the decay of hafnium-182 (Hf-182), an isotope with a half-life of only 9 million years. Because tungsten dissolves enthusiastically in metallic iron and hafnium does not, it is possible to use the abundance of W-182 in rocks formed by melting of the silicate mantle as an indicator of the timing of core formation. However, the concentrations of Hf and W in rocky material can be affected by melting and crystallization, so we also need to know how each element concentrates in common minerals in the mantles of the Moon and Mars. The behavior of Hf has been studied experimentally, but this is not true of W. Kevin Righter (Johnson Space Center) and Charles (Chip) Shearer (University of New Mexico) have filled this knowledge void by determining how W partitions between olivine, high- and low-calcium pyroxene, plagioclase feldspar, and garnet. The new data allowed Righter and Shearer to reexamine available measurements of the isotopic composition of W in lunar samples and Martian meteorites. Their analysis suggests that the lunar magma ocean, a huge magma system that surrounded the Moon when it formed, solidified in less than 30 million years. This is shorter than many theoretical calculations suggest. Pathfinder data and chemical data from Martian meteorites suggest that the core of Mars makes up about 20% of the planet. Core formation and subsequent melting of a region of the mantle containing garnet and high-calcium pyroxene took place less than 20-30 million years after the formation of the first solids in the solar system. This type of research shows the importance of measurements of isotopic compositions of radioactive elements or their decay products and laboratory experiments on the geochemical behavior of those elements.\n\nStudy of bulk Hafnium oxide (HfO2) under compression\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPathak, Santanu; Mandal, Guruprasad; Das, Parnika\n\n2018-04-01\n\nHafnium oxide (HfO2) is a technologically important material. This material has K-value of 25 and band gap 5.8 eV. A k value of 25-30 is preferred for a gate dielectric [1]. As it shows good insulating and capacitive properties, HfO2 is being considered as a replacement to SiO2 in microelectronic devices as gate dielectrics. On the other hand because of toughening mechanism due to phase transformation induced by stress field observed in these oxides, HFO2 has been a material of investigations in various configurations for a very long time. However the controversies about phase transition of HfO2 under pressure still exists. High quality synchrotron radiation has been used to study the structural phase transition of HfO2 under pressure.\n\nMultimode resistive switching in nanoscale hafnium oxide stack as studied by atomic force microscopy\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHou, Y., E-mail: houyi@pku.edu.cn, E-mail: lfliu@pku.edu.cn; IMEC, Kapeldreef 75, B-3001 Heverlee; Department of Physics and Astronomy, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200D, B-3001 Heverlee\n\n2016-07-11\n\nThe nanoscale resistive switching in hafnium oxide stack is investigated by the conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). The initial oxide stack is insulating and electrical stress from the C-AFM tip induces nanometric conductive filaments. Multimode resistive switching can be observed in consecutive operation cycles at one spot. The different modes are interpreted in the framework of a low defect quantum point contact theory. The model implies that the optimization of the conductive filament active region is crucial for the future application of nanoscale resistive switching devices.\n\nComposition effects on mechanical properties of tungsten-rhenium-hafnium-carbon alloys\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWitzke, W. R.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe mechanical properties of rod and sheet fabricated from arc melted W-4Re-Hf-C alloys containing up to about 0.8 mol percent hafnium carbide (HfC) were evaluated in the as-worked condition. The DBTT's of electropolished bend and tensile specimens were independent of HfC content in this range but dependent on excess Hf or C above that required for stoichiometric HfC. Low temperature ductility was a maximum at Hf contents slightly in excess of stoichiometric. Variations in high temperature strength were also dependent on excess Hf and C. Maximum creep strengthening also occurred at Hf contents in excess of stoichiometric. Analysis of extracted second phase particles indicated that creep strength was reduced by increasing WC content in the HfC particles.\n\nPyroelectricity of silicon-doped hafnium oxide thin films\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJachalke, Sven; Schenk, Tony; Park, Min Hyuk; Schroeder, Uwe; Mikolajick, Thomas; StÃ¶cker, Hartmut; Mehner, Erik; Meyer, Dirk C.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFerroelectricity in hafnium oxide thin films is known to be induced by various doping elements and in solid-solution with zirconia. While a wealth of studies is focused on their basic ferroelectric properties and memory applications, thorough studies of the related pyroelectric properties and their application potential are only rarely found. This work investigates the impact of Si doping on the phase composition and ferro- as well as pyroelectric properties of thin film capacitors. Dynamic hysteresis measurements and the field-free Sharp-Garn method were used to correlate the reported orthorhombic phase fractions with the remanent polarization and pyroelectric coefficient. Maximum values of 8.21 ÂµC cm-2 and -46.2 ÂµC K-1 m-2 for remanent polarization and pyroelectric coefficient were found for a Si content of 2.0 at%, respectively. Moreover, temperature-dependent measurements reveal nearly constant values for the pyroelectric coefficient and remanent polarization over the temperature range of 0 Â° C to 170 Â° C , which make the material a promising candidate for IR sensor and energy conversion applications beyond the commonly discussed use in memory applications.\n\nZirconium and hafnium fractionation in differentiation of alkali carbonatite magmatic systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKogarko, L. N.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nZirconium and hafnium are valuable strategic metals which are in high demand in industry. The Zr and Hf contents are elevated in the final products of magmatic differentiation of alkali carbonatite rocks in the Polar Siberia region (Guli Complex) and Ukraine (Chernigov Massif). Early pyroxene fractionation led to an increase in the Zr/Hf ratio in the evolution of the ultramafic-alkali magmatic system due to a higher distribution coefficient of Hf in pyroxene with respect to Zr. The Rayleigh equation was used to calculate a quantitative model of variation in the Zr/Hf ratio in the development of the Guli magmatic system. Alkali carbonatite rocks originated from rare element-rich mantle reservoirs, in particular, the metasomatized mantle. Carbonated mantle xenoliths are characterized by a high Zr/Hf ratio due to clinopyroxene development during metasomatic replacement of orthopyroxene by carbonate fluid melt.\n\nExperimental and first-principles studies on the elastic properties of Î±-hafnium metal under pressure\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nQi, Xintong; Wang, Xuebing; Chen, Ting; ...\n\n2016-03-30\n\nCompressional and shear wave velocities of the Î± phase of hafnium have been measured up to 10.4 GPa at room temperature using ultrasonic interferometry in a multi-anvil apparatus. A finite strain equation of state analysis yielded K s0 = 110.4 (5) GPa, G 0 = 54.7(5) GPa,K s0' = 3.7 and G 0' = 0.6 for the elastic bulk and shear moduli and their pressure derivatives at ambient conditions. Complementary to the experimental data, the single crystal elastic constants, elastic anisotropy and the unit cell axial ratio c/a of Î±-hafnium at high pressures were investigated by Density Functional Theory (DFT)moreÂ Â» based first principles calculations. A c/a value of 1.605 is predicted for Î±-Hf at 40 GPa, which is in excellent agreement with previous experimental results. The low-pressure derivative of the shear modulus observed in our experimental data up to 10 GPa was found to originate from the elastic constant C44 which exhibits negligible pressure dependence within the current experimental pressure range. At higher pressures (>10 GPa), C 44 was predicted to soften and the shear wave velocity Î½ S trended to decrease with pressure, which can be interpreted as a precursor to the Î±-Ï transition similar to that observed in other group IV elements (titanium and zirconium). Here, the acoustic velocities, bulk and shear moduli, and the acoustic Debye temperature (Î¸ D = 240.1 K) determined from the current experiments were all compared well with those predicted by our theoretical DFT calculations.Â«Â less\n\nStress-rupture strength and microstructural stability of tungsten-hafnium-carbon-wire reinforced superalloy composites\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPetrasek, D. W.; Signorelli, R. A.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nTungsten-hafnium-carbon - superalloy composites were found to be potentially useful for turbine blade applications on the basis of stress-rupture strength. The 100- and 1000-hr rupture strengths calculated for 70 vol. % fiber composites based on test data at 1090C (2000F) were 420 and 280 MN/m2 (61,000 and 41,000 psi, respectively). The investigation indicated that, with better quality fibers, composites having 100- and 1000-hr rupture strengths of 570 and 370 MN/m2 (82,000 and 54,000 psi, respectively), may be obtained. Metallographic studies indicated sufficient fiber-matrix compatibility for 1000 hr or more at 1090C (2000F).\n\nSilicon doped hafnium oxide (HSO) and hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) based FeFET: A material relation to device physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, T.; Polakowski, P.; Riedel, S.; BÃ¼ttner, T.; KÃ¤mpfe, T.; Rudolph, M.; PÃ¤tzold, B.; Seidel, K.; LÃ¶hr, D.; Hoffmann, R.; Czernohorsky, M.; KÃ¼hnel, K.; Thrun, X.; Hanisch, N.; Steinke, P.; Calvo, J.; MÃ¼ller, J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe recent discovery of ferroelectricity in thin film HfO2 materials renewed the interest in ferroelectric FET (FeFET) as an emerging nonvolatile memory providing a potential high speed and low power Flash alternative. Here, we report more insight into FeFET performance by integrating two types of ferroelectric (FE) materials and varying their properties. By varying the material type [HfO2 (HSO) versus hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO)], optimum content (Si doping/mixture ratio), and film thickness, a material relation to FeFET device physics is concluded. As for the material type, an improved FeFET performance is observed for HZO integration with memory window (MW) comparable to theoretical values. For different Si contents, the HSO based FeFET exhibited a MW trend with different stabilized phases. Similarly, the HZO FeFET shows MW dependence on the Hf:Zr mixture ratio. A maximized MW is obtained with cycle ratios of 16:1 (HfO2:Si) and 1:1 (Hf:Zr) as measured on HSO and HZO based FeFETs, respectively. The thickness variation shows a trend of increasing MW with the increased FE layer thickness confirming early theoretical predictions. The FeFET material aspects and stack physics are discussed with insight into the interplay factors, while optimum FE material parameters are outlined in relation to performance.\n\nAtomic layer deposition of hafnium oxide: A detailed reaction mechanism from first principles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWidjaja, Yuniarto; Musgrave, Charles B.\n\n2002-08-01\n\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) of hafnium oxide (HfO2) using HfCl4 and H2O as precursors is studied using density functional theory. The mechanism consists of two deposition half-reactions: (1) HfCl4 with Hf-OH sites, and (2) H2O with Hf-Cl sites. Both half-reactions exhibit stable intermediates with energies lower than those of the final products. We show that increasing the temperature reduces the stability of the complex. However, increasing temperature also increases the dissociation free-energy barrier, which in turn results in increased desorption of adsorbed precursors. Both half-reactions are qualitatively similar to the corresponding reactions of ZrO2 ALD using ZrCl4 and H2O.\n\nIntrinsic Defect Ferromagnetism: The case of Hafnium Oxide\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDas Pemmaraju, Chaitanya\n\n2005-03-01\n\nIn view of the recent experimental reports of intrinsic ferromagnetism in Hafnium Oxide (HfO2) thin film systems ootnotetextM. Venkatesan, C. B. Fitzgerald, J. M. D. Coey Nature 430, 630 (2004) Brief Communications, we carried out first principles investigations to look for magnetic structure in HfO2 possibly brought about by the presence of small concentrations of intrinsic point defects. Ab initio electronic structure calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) show that isolated cation vacancy sites in HfO2 lead to the formation of high spin defect states which couple ferromagnetically to each other. Interestingly, these high spin states are observed in the low symmetry monoclinic and tetragonal phases while the highly symmetric cubic flourite phase exhibits a non-magnetic ground state. Detailed studies of the electronic structure of cation vacancies in the three crystalline phases of Hafnia show that symmetry leading to orbitally degenerate defect levels is not a pre-requsite for ferromagnetism and that the interplay between Kinetic, Coulomb and Exchange energy together with favourable coupling to the Crystalline environment can lead to high spin ferromagnetic ground states even in extreme low symmetry systems like monoclinic HfO2. These findings open up a much wider class of systems to the possibility of intrinsic defect ferromagnetism.\n\nThe interfacial orientation relationship of oxide nanoparticles in a hafnium-containing oxide dispersion-strengthened austenitic stainless steel\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMiao, Yinbin, E-mail: miao2@illinois.edu; Mo, Kun; Cui, Bai\n\n2015-03-15\n\nThis work reports comprehensive investigations on the orientation relationship of the oxide nanoparticles in a hafnium-containing austenitic oxide dispersion-strengthened 316 stainless steel.

A derivative of this material has been shown to be an efficient catalyst for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen. This paper has two objectivesâone is to optimize the synthetic routes leading to the preparation of MPO PV (M=zirconium or hafnium) and the second is to characterize MPO PV and the derivatives formed by Pt or Pd incorporation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis (XAFS). Powder XRD data have shown much higher crystallinity in MPO PV samples prepared by hydrothermal methods than those prepared by reflux methods. In the hydrothermal synthesis, the amount of mineralizer (HF) present controlled the crystallite size (as determined from TEM micrographs). The larger the quantity of HF in the bomb, the larger the size of the crystals but the lower the yield of the MPO PV material. Crystal sizes of about 2.5 Î¼m in length and 0.15 Î¼m in diameter have been made with very large quantities of HF as mineralizer (10 times the required stoichiometric amount). Ion exchange of the material by PdCl 42- has resulted in the incorporation of the PdCl 42- ions in place of X - in the material. This has been confirmed by XAFS studies that demonstrate the oxidation state of Pd is 2+ and show four Cl atoms bound to Pd. Upon reduction it has been confirmed (by XAFS) that the palladium exists as metal with oxidation state of zero. Ion exchange by PdCl 42- and PtCl 42- and subsequent reduction of the material suspension by hydrogen result in the formation of separate Pt and Pd colloids in the close vicinity of the crystallites.

The authors analyzed the thin films using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction, thereby demonstrating that the e-beam-evaporation-grown HfO 2 film has a polycrystalline structure and forms an excellent interface with silicon. Accordingly, we fabricated 31-stage CMOS ringmoreÂ Â» oscillator to test the quality of the HfO 2 thin film as the gate oxide, and obtained excellent rail-to-rail oscillation waveforms from it, denoting that the HfO 2 thin film functioned very well as the gate oxide.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of nitrogen on tensile properties and structures of T-111 (tantalum, 8 percent tungsten, 2 percent hafnium) tubing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuzzard, R.

R.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe effect of controlled nitrogen additions was evaluated on the mechanical properties of T-111 (Ta-8W-2Hf) fuel pin cladding material proposed for use in a lithium-cooled nuclear reactor concept. Additions of 80 to 1125 ppm nitrogen resulted in increased strengthening of T-111 tubular section test specimens at temperatures of 25 to 1200 C. Homogeneous distributions of up to 500 ppm nitrogen did not seriously decrease tensile ductility. Both single and two-phase microstructures, with hafnium nitride as the second phase, were evaluated in this study.\n\nPyroelectric response in crystalline hafnium zirconium oxide (Hf 1- x Zr x O 2 ) thin films\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSmith, S. W.; Kitahara, A. R.; Rodriguez, M. A.; ...\n\n2017-02-13\n\nPyroelectric coefficients were measured for 20 nm thick crystalline hafnium zirconium oxide (Hf 1-xZr xO 2) thin films across a composition range of 0 â¤ x â¤ 1. Pyroelectric currents were collected near room temperature under zero applied bias and a sinusoidal oscillating temperature profile to separate the influence of non-pyroelectric currents. The pyroelectric coefficient was observed to correlate with zirconium content, increased orthorhombic/tetragonal phase content, and maximum polarization response. The largest measured absolute value was 48 Î¼Cm -2K -1 for a composition with x = 0.64, while no pyroelectric response was measured for compositions which displayed no remanent polarizationmoreÂ Â» (x = 0, 0.91, 1).Â«Â less\n\nTribo-electrochemical characterization of hafnium multilayer systems deposited on nitride/vanadium nitride AISI 4140 steel\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMora, M.; Vera, E.; Aperador, W.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nIn this work is presented the synergistic behaviour among corrosion/wear (tribocorrosion) of the multilayer coatings hafnium nitride/vanadium nitride [HfN/VN]n. The multilayers were deposited on AISI 4140 steel using the technique of physical vapor deposition PVD magnetron sputtering, the tests were performed using a pin-on-disk tribometer, which has an adapted potentiostat galvanostat with three-electrode electrochemical cell. Tribocorrosive parameters such as: Friction coefficient between the coating and the counter body (100 Cr6 steel ball); Polarization resistance by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique and corrosion rate by polarization curves were determined. It was observed an increase in the polarization resistance, a decrease in the corrosion rate and a low coefficient of friction in comparison with the substrate, due to an increase on the number of bilayers.\n\nSynthesis of High Symmetry Phase of Hafnium Dioxide Thin Films and Nickel Ferrite's Effect on Microstructure in Composite Heterostructure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStraka, Weston J.\n\nHafnium dioxide has attracted a great deal of attention recently due to its potential use in two different electronic applications: CMOS and FeRAM. In CMOS, the usefulness of hafnia comes in due to its high dielectric constant and compatibility with current IC processing parameters. For FeRAM, hafnia's recent discovery to exhibit ferroelectricity in an orthorhombic phase makes this material attractive for replacement of the ferroelectric material in FeRAM. This study shows the feasibility of depositing thin films of hafnium oxide via chemical solution deposition for integration into these devices. The processing parameters necessary to produce this phase show how non-equilibrium processing plays a role in its synthesis. The temperature necessary to achieve the high symmetry phase was at 725 Â°C for 3 minutes on sapphire, silicon, and coated silicon substrates. The thermal conductivity of each was viewed as the property that allowed the hafnia formation. The dielectric constant of the hafnia films were between 30 and 32 with low dissipation factors and up to 47 with a poor dissipation factor all at 1 kHz. The formation of this phase was shown to be thickness independent with the high symmetry phase existing up to 300 nm film thickness. Interfacing the hafnia film with nickel ferrite was also studied to identify the possibility of using this composite for non-destructive reading of FeRAM. The magnetic properties showed an unchanged nickel ferrite film but the interface between the two was poor leading to the conclusion that more work must be done to successfully integrate these two films.\n\nSilicon Nanowires with High-k Hafnium Oxide Dielectrics for Sensitive Detection of Small Nucleic Acid Oligomers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDorvel, Brian R.; Reddy, Bobby; Go, Jonghyun; Guevara, Carlos Duarte; Salm, Eric; Alam, Muhammad Ashraful; Bashir, Rashid\n\n2012-01-01\n\nNanobiosensors based on silicon nanowire field effect transistors offer advantages of low cost, label-free detection, and potential for massive parallelization. As a result, these sensors have often been suggested as an attractive option for applications in Point-of-care (POC) medical diagnostics. Unfortunately, a number of performance issues such as gate leakage and current instability due to fluid contact, have prevented widespread adoption of the technology for routine use. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have the known ability to address these challenges by passivating the exposed surfaces against destabilizing concerns of ion transport. With these fundamental stability issues addressed, a promising target for POC diagnostics and SiNWFETâs has been small oligonucleotides, more specifically microRNA (miRNA). MicroRNAâs are small RNA oligonucleotides which bind to messenger RNAâs, causing translational repression of proteins, gene silencing, and expressions are typically altered in several forms of cancer. In this paper, we describe a process for fabricating stable HfO2 dielectric based silicon nanowires for biosensing applications. Here we demonstrate sensing of single stranded DNA analogues to their microRNA cousins using miR-10b and miR-21 as templates, both known to be upregulated in breast cancer. We characterize the effect of surface functionalization on device performance using the miR-10b DNA analogue as the target sequence and different molecular weight poly-l-lysine as the functionalization lay"
