A.; Ghiorso, A.\n\n1948-01-01\n\nTwo isotopes of the element with atomic number 96 have been produced by the helium-ion bombardment of plutonium. The name curium, symbol Cm, is proposed for element 96. The chemical experiments indicate that the most stable oxidation state of curium is the III state.\n\nThe New Element Berkelium (Atomic Number 97)\n\nDOE R&D Accomplishments Database\n\nSeaborg, G. T.; Thompson, S. G.; Ghiorso, A.\n\n1950-04-26\n\nAn isotope of the element with atomic number 97 has been discovered as a product of the helium-ion bombardment of americium. The name berkelium, symbol Bk, is proposed for element 97. The chemical separation of element 97 from the target material and other reaction products was made by combinations of precipitation and ion exchange adsorption methods making use of its anticipated (III) and (IV) oxidation states and its position as a member of the actinide transition series. The distinctive chemical properties made use of in its separation and the equally distinctive decay properties of the particular isotope constitute the principal evidence for the new element.\n\nHeaviest Nuclei: New Element with Atomic Number 117\n\nScienceCinema\n\nOganessian, Yuri\n\n2018-01-24\n\nOne of the fundamental outcomes of the nuclear shell model is the prediction of the 'stability islands' in the domain of the hypothetical super heavy elements. The talk is devoted to the experimental verification of these predictions - the synthesis and study of both the decay and chemical properties of the super heavy elements. The discovery of a new chemical element with atomic number Z=117 is reported. The isotopes 293117 and 294117 were produced in fusion reactions between 48Ca and 249Bk. Decay chains involving 11 new nuclei were identified by means of the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator. The measured decay properties show a strong rise of stability for heavier isotopes with Z =111, validating the concept of the long sought island of enhanced stability for heaviest nuclei.\n\nAn x ray scatter approach for non-destructive chemical analysis of low atomic numbered elements\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRoss, H. Richard\n\n1993-01-01\n\nA non-destructive x-ray scatter (XRS) approach has been developed, along with a rapid atomic scatter algorithm for the detection and analysis of low atomic-numbered elements in solids, powders, and liquids. The present method of energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) makes the analysis of light elements (i.e., less than sodium; less than 11) extremely difficult. Detection and measurement become progressively worse as atomic numbers become smaller, due to a competing process called 'Auger Emission', which reduces fluorescent intensity, coupled with the high mass absorption coefficients exhibited by low energy x-rays, the detection and determination of low atomic-numbered elements by x-ray spectrometry is limited. However, an indirect approach based on the intensity ratio of Compton and Rayleigh scattered has been used to define light element components in alloys, plastics and other materials. This XRS technique provides qualitative and quantitative information about the overall constituents of a variety of samples.\n\nThe effect of grading the atomic number at resistive guide element interface on magnetic collimation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAlraddadi, R. A. B.; Woolsey, N. C.; Robinson, A. P. L.\n\n2016-07-15\n\nUsing 3 dimensional numerical simulations, this paper shows that grading the atomic number and thus the resistivity at the interface between an embedded high atomic number guide element and a lower atomic number substrate enhances the growth of a resistive magnetic field. This can lead to a large integrated magnetic flux density, which is fundamental to confining higher energy fast electrons. This results in significant improvements in both magnetic collimation and fast-electron-temperature uniformity across the guiding. The graded interface target provides a method for resistive guiding that is tolerant to laser pointing.\n\nSEPARATION OF PLUTONIUM FROM ELEMENTS HAVING AN ATOMIC NUMBER NOT LESS THAN 92\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFitch, F.T.; Russell, D.S.\n\n1958-09-16\n\nother elements having atomic numbers nnt less than 92, It has been proposed in the past to so separate plutonium by solvent extraction iato an organic solvent using triglycoldichlcride as the organic solvent. The improvement lies in the discovery that triglycoldichloride performs far more efflciently as an extractant, wher certain second organie compounds are added to it. Mentioned as satisfactory additive compounds are benzaldehyde, saturated aliphatic aldehydes containtng at least twc carbon atoms, and certain polyhydric phenols.\n\nRADIOACTIVE ELEMENTS IN THE STANDARD ATOMIC WEIGHTS TABLE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHolden, N.E.; Holden, N.; Holden,N.E.\n\n2011-07-27\n\nIn the 1949 Report of the Atomic Weights Commission, a series of new elements were added to the Atomic Weights Table. Since these elements had been produced in the laboratory and were not discovered in nature, the atomic weight value of these artificial products would depend upon the production method. Since atomic weight is a property of an element as it occurs in nature, it would be incorrect to assign an atomic weight value to that element. As a result of that discussion, the Commission decided to provide only the mass number of the most stable (or longest-lived) known isotopemoreÂ Â» as the number to be associated with these entries in the Atomic Weights Table. As a function of time, the mass number associated with various elements has changed as longer-lived isotopes of a particular element has been found in nature, or as improved half-life values of an element's isotopes might cause a shift in the longest-lived isotope from one mass to another. In the 1957 Report of the Atomic Weights Commission, it was decided to discontinue the listing of the mass number in the Atomic Weights Table on the grounds that the kind of information supplied by the mass number is inconsistent with the primary purpose of the Table, i.e., to provide accurate values of 'these constants' for use in various chemical calculations. In addition to the Table of Atomic Weights, the Commission included an auxiliary Table of Radioactive Elements for the first time, where the entry would be the isotope of that element which was the most stable, i.e., the one with the longest known half-life. In their 1973 Report, the Commission noted that the users of the main Table of Atomic Weights were dissatisfied with the omission of values for some elements in that Table and it was decided to reintroduce the mass number for the radioactive elements into the main Table. In their 1983 Report, the Commission decided that radioactive elements were considered to lack a characteristic terrestrial isotopic\n\nAnalytical dependence of effective atomic number on the elemental composition of matter and radiation energy in the range 10-1000 keV\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEritenko, A. N.; Tsvetiansky, A. L.; Polev, A. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn the present paper, a universal analytical dependence of effective atomic number on the composition of matter and radiation energy is proposed. This enables one to consider the case of a strong difference in the elemental composition with respect to their atomic numbers over a wide energy range. The contribution of photoelectric absorption and incoherent and coherent scattering during the interaction between radiation and matter is considered. For energy values over 40 keV, the contribution of coherent scattering does not exceed approximately 10% that can be neglected at a further consideration. The effective atomic numbers calculated on the basis of the proposed relationships are compared to the results of calculations based on other methods considered by different authors on the basis of experimental and tabulated data on mass and atomic attenuation coefficients. The examination is carried out for both single-element (e.g., 6C, 14Si, 28Cu, 56Ba, and 82Pb) and multi-element materials. Calculations are performed for W1-xCux alloys (x = 0.35; x = 0.4), PbO, ther moluminescent dosimetry compounds (56Ba, 48Cd, 41Sr, 20Ca, 12Mg, and 11Na), and SO4 in a wide energy range. A case with radiation energy between the K- and L1-absorption edges is considered for 82Pb, 74W, 56Ba, 48Cd, and 38Sr. This enables to substantially simplify the calculation of the atomic number and will be useful in technical and scientific fields related to the interaction between X-ray/gamma radiation and matter.\n\nOn the way to unveiling the atomic structure of superheavy elements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaatiaoui, Mustapha\n\n2016-12-01\n\nOptical spectroscopy of the transfermium elements (atomic number Z > 100) is nowadays one of the most fascinating and simultaneously challenging tasks in atomic physics. On the one hand, key atomic and even nuclear ground-state properties may be obtained by studying the spectral lines of these heaviest elements. On the other hand, these elements have to be produced \"online\" by heavy-ion induced fusion-evaporation reactions yielding rates on the order of a few atoms per second at most, which renders their optical spectroscopy extremely difficult. Only recently, a first foray of laser spectroscopy into this heaviest element region was reported. Several atomic transitions in the element nobelium (Z = 102) were observed and characterized, using an ultra-sensitive and highly efficient resonance ionization technique. The findings confirm the predictions and additionally provide a benchmark for theoretical modelling. The work represents an important stepping stone towards experimental studies of the atomic structure of superheavy elements.\n\nOn the atomic-number similarity of the binding energies of electrons in filled shells of elements of the periodic table\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKarpov, V. Ya.; Shpatakovskaya, G. V., E-mail: shpagalya@yandex.ru\n\nAn expression for the binding energies of electrons in the ground state of an atom is derived on the basis of the BohrâSommerfeld quantization rule within the ThomasâFermi model. The validity of this relation for all elements from neon to uranium is tested within a more perfect quantum-mechanical model with and without the inclusion of relativistic effects, as well as with experimental binding energies. As a result, the ordering of electronic levels in filled atomic shells is established, manifested in an approximate atomic-number similarity. It is proposed to use this scaling property to analytically estimate the binding energies of electronsmoreÂ Â» in an arbitrary atom.Â«Â less\n\nAtomic weights of the elements--Review 2000 (IUPAC Technical Report)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nde Laeter, John R.; BÃ¶hlke, John Karl; De BiÃ¨vre, P.; Hidaka, H.; Peiser, H.S.; Rosman, K.J.R.; Taylor, P.D.P.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA consistent set of internationally accepted atomic weights has long been an essential aim of the scientific community because of the relevance of these values to science and technology, as well as to trade and commerce subject to ethical, legal, and international standards. The standard atomic weights of the elements are regularly evaluated, recommended, and published in updated tables by the Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances (CAWIA) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). These values are invariably associated with carefully evaluated uncertainties. Atomic weights were originally determined by mass ratio measurements coupled with an understanding of chemical stoichiometry, but are now based almost exclusively on knowledge of the isotopic composition (derived from isotope-abundance ratio measurements) and the atomic masses of the isotopes of the elements. Atomic weights and atomic masses are now scaled to a numerical value of exactly 12 for the mass of the carbon isotope of mass number 12. Technological advances in mass spectrometry and nuclear-reaction energies have enabled atomic masses to be determined with a relative uncertainty of better than 1 Ã10â7 . Isotope abundances for an increasing number of elements can be measured to better than 1 Ã10â3 . The excellent precision of such measurements led to the discovery that many elements, in different specimens, display significant variations in their isotope-abundance ratios, caused by a variety of natural and industrial physicochemical processes. While such variations increasingly place a constraint on the uncertainties with which some standard atomic weights can be stated, they provide numerous opportunities for investigating a range of important phenomena in physical, chemical, cosmological, biological, and industrial processes. This review reflects the current and increasing interest of science in the measured differences between source-specific and even sample\n\nAn atomic finite element model for biodegradable polymers. Part 1. Formulation of the finite elements.\n\nPubMed\n\nGleadall, Andrew; Pan, Jingzhe; Ding, Lifeng; Kruft, Marc-Anton; CurcÃ³, David\n\n2015-11-01\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to analyse materials at the atomic scale. However, MD has high computational demands, which may inhibit its use for simulations of structures involving large numbers of atoms such as amorphous polymer structures. An atomic-scale finite element method (AFEM) is presented in this study with significantly lower computational demands than MD. Due to the reduced computational demands, AFEM is suitable for the analysis of Young's modulus of amorphous polymer structures. This is of particular interest when studying the degradation of bioresorbable polymers, which is the topic of an accompanying paper. AFEM is derived from the inter-atomic potential energy functions of an MD force field. The nonlinear MD functions were adapted to enable static linear analysis. Finite element formulations were derived to represent interatomic potential energy functions between two, three and four atoms. Validation of the AFEM was conducted through its application to atomic structures for crystalline and amorphous poly(lactide). Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A new method for categorizing hydrocarbons based on their atomic number density and elemental composition was developed and applied to the diamond-like hydrocarbon films. It was shown that the diamond-like hydrocarbon films are an entirely new class of hydrocarbons with atomic number densities lying between those of single crystal diamond and adamantanes. In addition, a major review article on these new materials was completed in cooperation with NASA Lewis Research Center personnel.\n\nThe New Element Americium (Atomic Number 95)\n\nDOE R&D Accomplishments Database\n\nSeaborg, G.T.; James, R.A.; Morgan, L.O.\n\n1948-01-01\n\nSeveral isotopes of the new element 95 have been produced and their radiations characterized. The chemical properties of this tripositive element are similar to those of the typical tripositive lanthanide rare-earth elements. Element 95 is different from the latter in the degree and rate of formation of certain compounds of the complex ion type, which makes possible the separation of element 95 from the lanthanide rare-earths. The name americium (after the Americas) and the symbol Am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare-earth series, analogous to europium, Eu, of the lanthanide series.\n\nEffective atomic numbers and electron densities of bioactive glasses for photon interaction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShantappa, Anil; Hanagodimath, S.

We have also computed the single valued effective atomic number by using XMuDat program. It is observed that variation in effective atomic number (ZPI, eff) depends also upon the weight fractions of selected bioactive glasses and range of atomic numbers of the elements.

A rigid geometry arrangement and gating of the spectrometer at FWHM position and selection of absorber foils are all done following detailed investigation, to minimize the effect of small angle scattering and multiple scattering on the mass attenuation coefficient, Î¼/Ï, value. Firstly, for standardization purposes the mass attenuation coefficients of elemental foils such as Aluminum, Copper, Molybdenum, Tantalum and Lead are measured and then, this method is utilized for dosimetric interested material (sulfates). The experimental mass attenuation coefficient values are compared with the theoretical values to find good agreement between the theory and experiment within one to two per cent. The effective atomic numbers of the biological substitute material are calculated by sum rule and from the graph. The electron density of dosimetric material is calculated using the effective atomic number. The study has discussed in detail the attenuation coefficient, effective atomic number and electron density of dosimetric material/biological substitutes.

It must provide high degree of atomization for the group of analytes, invariant respective to the vaporization kinetics and heating ramp residence time of atoms in the absorption volume and absence of memory effects from major sample components. For the low resolution spectrometer with a continuum radiation source the reduced compared to traditional ETAAS (Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectrometry) sensitivity should be, at least partially, compensated by creating high density of atomic vapor in the absorption pulse. The sought-for characteristics were obtained for the 18 mm in length and 2.5 mm in internal diameter longitudinally heated graphite tube atomizer furnished with 2-4.5 mg of ring shaped carbon fiber yarn collector. The collector located next to the sampling port provides large substrate area that helps to keep the sample and its residue in the central part of the tube after drying. The collector also provides a \"platform\" effect that delays the vaporization and stipulates vapor release into absorption volume having already stabilized gas temperature. Due to the shape of external surface of the tube, presence of collector and rapid (about 10 Â°C/ms) heating, an inverse temperature distribution along the tube is attained at the beginnings of the atomization and cleaning steps. The effect is employed for cleaning of the atomizer using the set of short maximum power heating pulses. Preparation, optimal maintenance of the atomizer and its compliance to the multi-element determination requirements are evaluated and discussed. The experimental setup provides direct simultaneous determination of large group of element within 3-4 order concentration range. Limits of detection are close to those for sequential single element determination in\n\nKinetic-energy matrix elements for atomic Hylleraas-CI wave functions.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarris, Frank E\n\n2016-05-28\n\nHylleraas-CI is a superposition-of-configurations method in which each configuration is constructed from a Slater-type orbital (STO) product to which is appended (linearly) at most one interelectron distance rij. Computations of the kinetic energy for atoms by this method have been difficult due to the lack of formulas expressing these matrix elements for general angular momentum in terms of overlap and potential-energy integrals. It is shown here that a strategic application of angular-momentum theory, including the use of vector spherical harmonics, enables the reduction of all atomic kinetic-energy integrals to overlap and potential-energy matrix elements.

The relativistic counterparts of these equations can also be computed exactly but these expressions have been described in only a few places in the literature. In part, this is because the relativistic equations lack the elegant simplicity of the nonrelativistic equations. In this poster I will describe how variational Monte Carlo methods can be used to calculate the energy and properties of relativistic hydrogen atoms and how the wavefunctions for these systems can be used to calculate transition matrix elements.\n\nKinetic-energy matrix elements for atomic Hylleraas-CI wave functions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHarris, Frank E., E-mail: harris@qtp.ufl.edu\n\nHylleraas-CI is a superposition-of-configurations method in which each configuration is constructed from a Slater-type orbital (STO) product to which is appended (linearly) at most one interelectron distance r{sub ij}.

ATOMIC is a multi-purpose code that can generate LTE or non-LTE quantities of interest at various levels of approximation. Our calculations, which include fine-structure detail, represent a systematic improvement over previous Los Alamos opacity calculations using the LEDCOP legacy code. The ATOMIC code uses ab-initio atomic structure data computed from the CATS code, which is based on Cowan's atomic structure codes, and photoionization cross section data computed from the Los Alamos ionization code GIPPER. ATOMIC also incorporates a newmoreÂ Â» equation-of-state (EOS) model based on the chemical picture.

In addition, this report again contains an updated table of relative atomic mass values and half-lives of selected radioisotopes. Changes in the evaluated isotopic abundance values from those published in 1997 are so minor that an updated list will not be published for the year 1999. Many elements have a different isotopic composition in some nonterrestrial materials. Some recent data on parent nuclides that might affect isotopic abundances or atomic-weight values are included in this report for the information of the interested scientific community.\n\nAtomic weights of the elements 2009 (IUPAC technical report)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nWieser, M.E.; Coplen, T.B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe biennial review of atomic-weight determinations and other cognate data has resulted in changes for the standard atomic weights of 11 elements. Many atomic weights are not constants of nature, but depend upon the physical, chemical, and nuclear history of the material. The standard atomic weights of 10 elements having two or more stable isotopes have been changed to reflect this variability of atomic-weight values in natural terrestrial materials. To emphasize the fact that these standard atomic weights are not constants of nature, each atomic-weight value is expressed as an interval. The interval is used together with the symbol [a; b] to denote the set of atomic-weight values, Ar(E), of element E in normal materials for which a â¤ Ar(E) â¤ b. The symbols a and b denote the bounds of the interval [a; b]. The revised atomic weight of hydrogen, Ar(H), is [1.007 84; 1.008 11] from 1.007 94(7); lithium, Ar(Li), is [6.938; 6.997] from 6.941(2); boron, Ar(B), is [10.806; 10.821] from 10.811(7); carbon, Ar(C), is [12.0096; 12.0116] from 12.0107(8); nitrogen, Ar(N), is [14.006 43; 14.007 28] from 14.0067(2); oxygen, Ar(O), is [15.999 03; 15.999 77] from 15.9994(3); silicon, Ar(Si), is [28.084; 28.086] from 28.0855(3); sulfur, Ar(S), is [32.059; 32.076] from 32.065(2); chlorine, Ar(Cl), is [35.446; 35.457] from 35.453(2); and thallium, Ar(Tl), is [204.382; 204.385] from 204.3833(2). This fundamental change in the presentation of the atomic weights represents an important advance in our knowledge of the natural world and underscores the significance and contributions of chemistry to the well-being of humankind in the International Year of Chemistry 2011. The standard atomic weight of germanium, Ar(Ge), was also changed to 72.63(1) from 72.64(1).\n\nX-ray STM: Nanoscale elemental analysis & Observation of atomic track.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaito, Akira; Furudate, Y; Kusui, Y; Saito, T; Akai-Kasaya, M; Tanaka, Y; Tamasaku, K; Kohmura, Y; Ishikawa, T; Kuwahara, Y; Aono, M\n\n2014-11-01\n\nScanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with brilliant X-rays from synchrotron radiation (SR) can provide various possibilities of original and important applications, such as the elemental analysis on solid surfaces at an atomic scale. The principle of the elemental analysis is based on the inner-shell excitation of an element-specific energy level \"under STM observation\". A key to obtain an atomic locality is to extract the element-specific modulation of the local tunneling current (not emission that can damage the spatial resolution), which is derived from the inner-shell excitation [1]. On this purpose, we developed a special SR-STM system and smart tip. To surmount a tiny core-excitation efficiency by hard X-rays, we focused two-dimensionally an incident beam having the highest photon density at the SPring-8.After successes in the elemental analyses by SR-STM [1,2] on a semiconductor hetero-interface (Ge on Si) and metal-semiconductor interface (Cu on Ge), we succeeded in obtaining the elemental contrast between Co nano-islands and Au substrate. The results on the metallic substrate suggest the generality of the method and give some important implications on the principle of contrast. For all cases of three samples, the spatial resolution of the analysis was estimated to be â¼1 nm or less, and it is worth noting that the measured surface domains had a deposition thickness of less than one atomic layer (Fig. 1, left and center).jmicro;63/suppl_1/i14-a/DFU045F1F1DFU045F1Fig. 1.(left) Topographic image and (center) beam-induced tip current image of Ge(111)-Cu (-2V, 0.2 nA).

The atomic number density of the alkali vapor and the pressure of the buffer gasare among the most important parameters of the cell andrequire accurate measurement. A method has been proposed and developedto measure the atomic number density and the pressure based on absorption spectroscopy, by sweeping the absorption line and fittingthe experiment data with a Lorentzian profile to obtainboth parameters. Due to Doppler broadening and pressure broadening, which is mainly dominated by the temperature of the cell and the pressure of buffer gas respectively, this work demonstrates a simulation of the errorbetween the peaks of the Lorentzian profile and the Voigt profile caused by bothfactors. The results indicates that the Doppler broadening contribution is insignificant with an error less than 0.015% at 313-513 K for a 4He density of 2 amg, and an error of 0.1% in the presence of 0.6-5 amg at 393 K. We conclude that the Doppler broadening could be ignored under above conditions, and that the Lorentzianprofile is suitably applied to fit the absorption spectrumobtainingboth parameters simultaneously. In addition we discuss the resolution and the instability due to thelight source, wavelength and the temperature of the cell. We find that the cell temperature, whose uncertainty is two orders of magnitude larger than the instability of the light source and the wavelength, is one of the main factors which contributes to the error.\n\nMatrix-Assisted Plasma Atomization Emission Spectrometry for Surface Sampling Elemental Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYuan, Xin; Zhan, Xuefang; Li, Xuemei; Zhao, Zhongjun; Duan, Yixiang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAn innovative technology has been developed involving a simple and sensitive optical spectrometric method termed matrix-assisted plasma atomization emission spectrometry (MAPAES) for surface sampling elemental analysis using a piece of filter paper (FP) for sample introduction. MAPAES was carried out by direct interaction of the plasma tail plume with the matrix surface. The FP absorbs energy from the plasma source and releases combustion heating to the analytes originally present on its surface, thus to promote the atomization and excitation process. The matrix-assisted plasma atomization excitation phenomenon was observed for multiple elements. The FP matrix served as the partial energy producer and also the sample substrate to adsorb sample solution. Qualitative and quantitative determinations of metal ions were achieved by atomic emission measurements for elements Ba, Cu, Eu, In, Mn, Ni, Rh and Y. The detection limits were down to pg level with linear correlation coefficients better than 0.99. The proposed MAPAES provides a new way for atomic spectrometry which offers advantages of fast analysis speed, little sample consumption, less sample pretreatment, small size, and cost-effective.

These 'superheavy' elements (also called transactinides with atomic number > or = 104 (Rf)) have been artificially synthesized in fusion reactions at accelerators in minute quantities of a few single atoms. In addition, all isotopes of the transactinide elements are radioactive and decay with rather short half-lives. Nevertheless, it has been possible in some cases to investigate experimentally chemical properties of transactinide elements and even synthesize simple compounds. The experimental investigation of superheavy elements is especially intriguing, since theoretical calculations predict significant deviations from periodic trends due to the influence of strong relativistic effects. In this contribution first experiments with hassium (Hs, atomic number 108), copernicium (Cn, atomic number 112) and element 114 (eka-Pb) are reviewed.\n\nAtomic hydrogen in. gamma. -irradiated hydroxides of alkaline-earth elements\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSpitsyn, V.I.; Yurik, T.K.; Barsova, L.I.\n\n1982-04-01\n\nAtomic hydrogen is an important intermediate product formed in the radiolysis of compounds containing X-H bonds. H atoms have been detected in irradiated matrices of H/sub 2/ and inert gases at 4/sup 0/K, in irradiated ice and frozen solutions of acids in irradiated salts and in other systems. Here results are presented from a study of the ESR spectra of H atoms generated in polycrystalline hydroxides of alkaline-earth elements that have been ..gamma..-irradiated at 77/sup 0/K, after preliminary treatment at various temperatures. For the first time stabilization of atomic hydrogen in ..gamma..-irradiated polycrystalline alkaline-earth element hydroxides has been detected. DependingmoreÂ Â» on the degree of dehydroxylation, several types of hydrogen atoms may be stabilized in the hydroxides, these hydrogen atoms having different radiospectroscopic parameters. In the magnesium-calcium-strontium-barium hydroxide series, a regular decrease has been found in the hfi constants for H atoms with the cations in the immediate surroundings. A direct proportionality has been found between the parameters ..delta..A/A/sub 0/ and the polarizability of the cation.Â«Â less\n\nTrapped atom number in millimeter-scale magneto-optical traps\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoth, Gregory W.; Donley, Elizabeth A.; Kitching, John\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFor compact cold-atom instruments, it is desirable to trap a large number of atoms in a small volume to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. In MOTs with beam diameters of a centimeter or larger, the slowing force is roughly constant versus velocity and the trapped atom number scales as d^4. For millimeter-scale MOTs formed from pyramidal reflectors, a d^6 dependence has been observed [Pollack et al., Opt. Express 17, 14109 (2009)]. A d^6 scaling is expected for small MOTs, where the slowing force is proportional to the atom velocity. For a 1 mm diameter MOT, a d^6 scaling results in 10 atoms, and the difference between a d^4 and a d^6 dependence corresponds to a factor of 1000 in atom number and a factor of 30 in the signal-to-noise ratio. We have observed >10^4 atoms in 1 mm diameter MOTs, consistent with a d^4 dependence. We are currently performing measurements for sub-mm MOTs to determine where the d^4 to d^6 crossover occurs in our system. We are also exploring MOTs based on linear polarization, which can potentially produce stronger slowing forces due to stimulated emission [Emile et al., Europhys. Lett. 20, 687 (1992)]. It may be possible to trap more atoms in small volumes with this method, since high intensities can be easily achieved.\n\nIsotope-abundance variations and atomic weights of selected elements: 2016 (IUPAC Technical Report)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCoplen, Tyler B.; Shrestha, Yesha\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThere are 63 chemical elements that have two or more isotopes that are used to determine their standard atomic weights. The isotopic abundances and atomic weights of these elements can vary in normal materials due to physical and chemical fractionation processes (not due to radioactive decay). These variations are well known for 12 elements (hydrogen, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, chlorine, bromine, and thallium), and the standard atomic weight of each of these elements is given by IUPAC as an interval with lower and upper bounds. Graphical plots of selected materials and compounds of each of these elements have been published previously. Herein and at the URL http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7GF0RN2, we provide isotopic abundances, isotope-delta values, and atomic weights for each of the upper and lower bounds of these materials and compounds.\n\nAtomic weights of the elements 2013 (IUPAC Technical Report)\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMeija, Juris; Coplen, Tyler B.; Berglund, Michael; Brand, Willi A.; De BiÃ¨vre, Paul; GrÃ¶ning, Manfred; Holden, Norman E.; Irrgeher, Johanna; Loss, Robert D.; Walczyk, Thomas; Prohaska, Thomas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe biennial review of atomic-weight determinations and other cognate data has resulted in changes for the standard atomic weights of 19 elements.

The advent of using molecular-modified tips in noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) has made it possible to image (planar) molecules with atomic resolution. However, the mechanisms responsible for elemental contrast with passivated tips are not fully understood. Here, we investigate elemental contrast by carrying out both nc-AFM and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) experiments on epitaxial monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) on Ir(111). The hBN overlayer is inert, and the in-plane bonds connecting nearest-neighbor boron and nitrogen atoms possess strong covalent character and a bond length of only â¼1.45 Ã . Nevertheless, constant-height maps of both the frequency shift Î f and the local contact potential difference exhibit striking sublattice asymmetry. We match the different atomic sites with the observed contrast by comparison with nc-AFM image simulations based on the density functional theory optimized hBN/Ir(111) geometry, which yields detailed information on the origin of the atomic-scale contrast.\n\nOn-site monitoring of atomic density number for an all-optical atomic magnetometer based on atomic spin exchange relaxation.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Hong; Zou, Sheng; Chen, Xiyuan; Ding, Ming; Shan, Guangcun; Hu, Zhaohui; Quan, Wei\n\n2016-07-25\n\nWe present a method for monitoring the atomic density number on site based on atomic spin exchange relaxation.

These deviations were mainly induced by the radiative heat transfer efficiency, which inevitably leaded to a lower temperature in cell than the setting temperature.\n\nElement Abundances in the Galactic Cosmic Rays with Atomic Number (Z) in the Interval 30 is less than or equal to Z is less than or equal to 40\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarbier, Louis; Binns, W.

At the time of submission of this abstract, January 8, 2004, TIGER was again in the air over Antarctica having completed 22 days of an expected 30day flight at a mean atmospheric depth of about 4 nb, Data from the first flight demonstrated excellent resolution of individual elements, and we expect similar resolution from the second flight.\n\nPhoton mass attenuation coefficients, effective atomic numbers and electron densities of some thermoluminescent dosimetric compounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGowda, Shivalinge; Krishnaveni, S.; Yashoda, T.; Umesh, T.

The attenuation coefficient data were then used to compute the effective atomic number and the electron density of TLD compounds. The interpolation of total attenuation cross-sections of photons of energy E in elements of atomic number Z was performed using the logarithmic regression analysis of the data measured by the authors and reported earlier. The best-fit coefficients so obtained in the photon energy range of 279.2 to 320.07 keV, 514.0 to 661.6 keV and 1115.5 to 1332.5 keV by a piece-wise interpolation method were then used to find the effective atomic number and electron density of the compounds.

The metric adopted is the average distance from the nucleus where the electron density falls to 0.001â electrons per bohr(3) , following earlier work by Boyd. Our radii are derived using relativistic all-electron density functional theory calculations, close to the basis set limit. They offer a systematic quantitative measure of the sizes of non-interacting atoms, commonly invoked in the rationalization of chemical bonding, structure, and different properties. Remarkably, the atomic radii as defined in this way correlate well with van der Waals radii derived from crystal structures. A rationalization for trends and exceptions in those correlations is provided. Â© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The technique is able to accurately measure both the real part of the index of refraction Î´ (directly related to electron density) and the attenuation coefficient Î¼ of an object placed in the x-ray beam. Since the atomic number Z (or Zeff for a composite sample) is proportional to these quantities, an elemental map of the effective atomic number can be obtained with the ratio of the phase and the absorption image. The determination of Zeff from refraction and attenuation measurements with MoirÃ© deflectometry could be of high interest in various fields of HED research such as shocked materials and ICF experiments as Zeff is linked, by definition, to the x-ray absorption properties of a specific material.

While certain ions such as potassium and calcium are closely monitored, little is known about the handling of trace elements in pediatric dialysis. RRT may lead to accumulation of toxic trace elements, either due to insufficient elimination or due to contamination, or to excessive removal of essential trace elements. However, trace elements are not routinely monitored in dialysis patients and no mechanism for these deficits or toxicities has been established. This review summarizes the handling of trace elements, with particular attention to pediatric data. The best data describe lead and indicate that there is a higher prevalence of elevated lead (Pb, atomic number 82) levels in children on RRT when compared to adults. Lead is particularly toxic in neurodevelopment and lead levels should therefore be monitored. Monitoring of zinc (Zn, atomic number 30) and selenium (Se, atomic number 34) may be indicated in the monitoring of all pediatric dialysis patients to reduce morbidity from deficiency. Prospective studies evaluating the impact of abnormal trace elements and the possible therapeutic value of intervention are required.\n\nImproved atom number with a dual color magnetoâoptical trap\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCao, Qiang; Luo, Xin-Yu; Gao, Kui-Yi; Wang, Xiao-Rui; Chen, Dong-Min; Wang, Ru-Quan\n\n2012-04-01\n\nWe demonstrate a novel dual color magnetoâoptical trap (MOT), which uses two sets of overlapping laser beams to cool and trap 87Rb atoms. The volume of cold cloud in the dual color MOT is strongly dependent on the frequency difference of the laser beams and can be significantly larger than that in the normal MOT with single frequency MOT beams. Our experiment shows that the dual color MOT has the same loading rate as the normal MOT, but much longer loading time, leading to threefold increase in the number of trapped atoms. This indicates that the larger number is caused by reduced light induced loss. The dual color MOT is very useful in experiments where both high vacuum level and large atom number are required, such as single chamber quantum memory and BoseâEinstein condensation (BEC) experiments. Compared to the popular dark spontaneous-force optical trap (dark SPOT) technique, our approach is technically simpler and more suitable to low power laser systems.\n\nMethod for quantitative determination and separation of trace amounts of chemical elements in the presence of large quantities of other elements having the same atomic mass\n\nDOEpatents\n\nMiller, C.M.; Nogar, N.S.\n\n1982-09-02\n\nPhotoionization via autoionizing atomic levels combined with conventional mass spectroscopy provides a technique for quantitative analysis of trace quantities of chemical elements in the presence of much larger amounts of other elements with substantially the same atomic mass. Ytterbium samples smaller than 10 ng have been detected using an ArF* excimer laser which provides the atomic ions for a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Elemental selectivity of greater than 5:1 with respect to lutetium impurity has been obtained. Autoionization via a single photon process permits greater photon utilization efficiency because of its greater absorption cross section than bound-free transitions, while maintaining sufficient spectroscopic structure to allow significant photoionization selectivity between different atomic species. Separation of atomic species from others of substantially the same atomic mass is also described.\n\nBack-extraction of trace elements from organometallic-halide extracts for determination by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nClark, J.R.; Viets, J.G.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe Methyl isobutyl ketone-Amine synerGistic Iodkte Complex (MAGIC) extraction system offers the advantage that a large number of trace elements can be rapidly determined with a single sample preparation procedure. However, many of the elements extracted by the MAGIC system form volatile organometallic halide salts when the organic extract is heated in the graphite furnace. High concentrations of some elements such as Cu and Zn extracted by the system from anomalous geological samples produce serious interferences when certain other elements are determined by flameless atomic absorption. Stripping systems have been developed using solutions of HNO3, H2SO4, and CH3COOH individually or combined with H2O2 in order to circumvent these problems. With these systems most of the elements in the organic extract can be sequentially stripped into an aqueous phase. Organometallic volatilization and the most serious interelement interferences, therefore, can be eliminated by stripping with various combinations of reagents in a series of steps.\n\nHigh Atom Number in Microsized Atom Traps\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-12-14\n\nforces on the order of (hbar)(k) (Omega), where Omega is the laser Rabi frequency.

S.; Sabharwal, Arvind D.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nA method has been presented for calculation of effective atomic number (Zeff) of composite materials, by using back-scattering of 662â keV gamma photons obtained from a 137Cs mono-energetic radioactive source. The present technique is a non-destructive approach, and is employed to evaluate Zeff of different composite materials, by interacting gamma photons with semi-infinite material in a back-scattering geometry, using a 3â³ Ã 3â³ NaI(Tl) scintillation detector. The present work is undertaken to study the effect of target thickness on intensity distribution of gamma photons which are multiply back-scattered from targets (pure elements) and composites (mixtures of different elements). The intensity of multiply back-scattered events increases with increasing target thickness and finally saturates. The saturation thickness for multiply back-scattered events is used to assign a number (Zeff) for multi-element materials. Response function of the 3â³ Ã 3â³ NaI(Tl) scintillation detector is applied on observed pulse-height distribution to include the contribution of partially absorbed photons. The reduced value of signal-to-noise ratio interprets the increase in multiply back-scattered data of a response corrected spectrum. Data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and literature also support the present experimental results.\n\nCombustor exhaust-emissions and blowout-limits with diesel number 2 and jet A fuels utilizing air-atomizing and pressure atomizing nozzles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIngebo, R. D.; Norgren, C. T.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nExperimental tests with diesel number 2 and Jet A fuels were conducted in a combustor segment to obtain comparative data on exhaust emissions and blowout limits. An air-atomizing nozzle was used to inject the fuels. Tests were also made with diesel number 2 fuel using a pressure-atomizing nozzle to determine the effectiveness of the air-atomizing nozzle in reducing exhaust emissions. Test conditions included fuel-air ratios of 0.008 to 0.018, inlet-air total pressures and temperatures of 41 to 203 newtons per square centimeter and 477 to 811 K, respectively, and a reference velocity of 21.3 meters per second. Smoke number and unburned hydrocarbons were twice as high with diesel number 2 as with Jet A fuel. This was attributed to diesel number 2 having a higher concentration of aromatics and lower volatility than Jet A fuel. Oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and blowout limits were approximately the same for the two fuels. The air-atomizing nozzle, as compared with the pressure-atomizing nozzle, reduced oxides-of-nitrogen by 20 percent, smoke number by 30 percent, carbon monoxide by 70 percent, and unburned hydrocarbons by 50 percent when used with diesel number 2 fuel.\n\nCombustor exhaust-emissions and blowout-limits with diesel number 2 and Jet A fuels utilizing air-atomizing and pressure-atomizing nozzles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIngebo, R. D.; Norgren, C. T.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe effect of fuel properties on exhaust emissions and blowout limits of a high-pressure combustor segment is evaluated using a splash-groove air-atomizing fuel injector and a pressure-atomizing simplex fuel nozzle to burn both diesel number 2 and Jet A fuels. Exhaust emissions and blowout data are obtained and compared on the basis of the aromatic content and volatility of the two fuels. Exhaust smoke number and emission indices for oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons are determined for comparison. As compared to the pressure-atomizing nozzle, the air-atomizing nozzle is found to reduce nitrogen oxides by 20%, smoke number by 30%, carbon monoxide by 70%, and unburned hydrocarbons by 50% when used with diesel number 2 fuel. The higher concentration of aromatics and lower volatility of diesel number 2 fuel as compared to Jet A fuel appears to have the most detrimental effect on exhaust emissions. Smoke number and unburned hydrocarbons are twice as high with diesel number 2 as with Jet A fuel.\n\nDiagrammatic technique for calculating matrix elements of collective operators in superradiance. [eigenstates for N two-level atom systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, C. T.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nAdopting the so-called genealogical construction, one can express the eigenstates of collective operators corresponding to a specified mode for an N-atom system in terms of those for an (N-1) atom system. Using these Dicke states as bases and using the Wigner-Eckart theorem, a matrix element of a collective operator of an arbitrary mode can be written as the product of an m-dependent factor and an m-independent reduced matrix element (RME). A set of recursion formulas for the RME is obtained. A graphical representation of the RME on the branching diagram for binary irreducible representations of permutation groups is then introduced. This gives a simple and systematic way of calculating the RME. This method is especially useful when the cooperation number r is close to N/2, where almost exact asymptotic expressions can be obtained easily. The result shows explicity the geometry dependence of superradiance and the relative importance of r-conserving and r-nonconserving processes.\n\nInvestigation of an alternating current plasma as an element selective atomic emission detector for high-resolution capillary gas chromatography and as a source for atomic absorption and atomic emission spectrometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOmbaba, Jackson M.\n\nThis thesis deals with the construction and evaluation of an alternating current plasma (ACP) as an element-selective detector for high resolution capillary gas chromatography (GC) and as an excitation source for atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and atomic emission spectrometry (AES). The plasma, constrained in a quartz discharge tube at atmospheric pressure, is generated between two copper electrodes and utilizes helium as the plasma supporting gas. The alternating current plasma power source consists of a step-up transformer with a secondary output voltage of 14,000 V at a current of 23 mA. The device exhibits a stable signal because the plasma is self-seeding and reignites itself every half cycle. A tesla coil is not required to commence generation of the plasma if the ac voltage applied is greater than the breakdown voltage of the plasma-supporting gas. The chromatographic applications studied included the following: (1) the separation and selective detection of the organotin species, tributyltin chloride (TBT) and tetrabutyltin (TEBT), in environmental matrices including mussels (Mvutilus edullus) and sediment from Boston Harbor, industrial waste water and industrial sludge, and (2) the detection of methylcyclopentadienyl manganesetricarbonyl (MMT) and similar compounds used as gasoline additives. An ultrasonic nebulizer (common room humidifier) was utilized as a sample introduction device for aqueous solutions when the ACP was employed as an atomization source for atomic absorption spectrometry and as an excitation source for atomic emission spectrometry. Plasma diagnostic parameters studied include spatial electron number density across the discharge tube, electronic, excitation and ionization temperatures. Interference studies both in absorption and emission modes were also considered. Figures of merits of selected elements both in absorption and emission modes are reported.

Using first-principles calculations, we propose a series of new elemental bilayers with group-V elements (Bi, Sb, As). Our study reveals the dynamical stability of four-, six-, and eight-atom ring structures, demonstrating their possible coexistence in such bilayer systems. The proposed structures for Sb and As are large-gap semiconductors that are potentially interesting for applications in future nanodevices. The Bi structures have nontrivial topological properties with a direct nontrivial band gap. The nontrivial gap is shown to arise from a band inversion at the Brillouin zone center due to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in Bi atoms. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the properties of these materials by enhancing the ratio of six-atom rings to four- and eight-atom rings, which results in wider nontrivial band gaps and lower formation energies.\n\nHigh Fidelity Simulation of Atomization in Diesel Engine Sprays\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-09-01\n\nARL-RP-0555 â SEP 2015 US Army Research Laboratory High Fidelity Simulation of Atomization in Diesel Engine Sprays by L Bravo...ARL-RP-0555 â SEP 2015 US Army Research Laboratory High Fidelity Simulation of Atomization in Diesel Engine Sprays by L...Simulation of Atomization in Diesel Engine Sprays 5a.

Thermal conditions were experimentally defined for the investigated elements. The elements were analyzed without addition of chemical modifiers, using organometallic standards for the calibration. Forty-microliter samples were injected into the THFA. Gasoline samples were analyzed directly, while diesel fuel samples were diluted 1:4 with n-heptane. The following characteristic masses were obtained: 0.8 pg Cd, 6.4 pg Cr, 12 pg Cu, 17 pg Pb and 27 pg Ni. The limits of determination for gasoline samples were 0.13 Î¼g/kg Cd, 0.4 Î¼g/kg Cr, 0.9 Î¼g/kg Cu, 1.5 Î¼g/kg Pb and 2.5 Î¼g/kg Ni. The corresponding limit of determination for diesel fuel samples was approximately four times higher for all elements. The element recovery was performed using the addition of organometallic compounds to gasoline and diesel fuel samples and was between 85 and 105% for all elements investigated.\n\nEvaluation of atomic constants for optical radiation, volume 2\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKylstra, C.

The data given for each element start with the element name, its atomic number, its ionic state, and the designation and series limit for each parent configuration. This is followed by information on the energy level, parent configuration, and designation for each term available to the program. The matrix elements subtables are ordered by the sequence numbers, which represent the initial and final levels of the transitions. Each subtable gives the following: configuration of the core or parent, designation and energy level for the reference state, effective principal quantum number, energy of the series limit, value of the matrix element for the reference state interacting with itself, and sum of all of the dipole matrix elements listed in the subtable. Dipole and quadrupole interaction data are also given.\n\nNanoarchitectonics for Controlling the Number of Dopant Atoms in Solid Electrolyte Nanodots.\n\nPubMed\n\nNayak, Alpana; Unayama, Satomi; Tai, Seishiro; Tsuruoka, Tohru; Waser, Rainer; Aono, Masakazu; Valov, Ilia; Hasegawa, Tsuyoshi\n\n2018-02-01\n\nControlling movements of electrons and holes is the key task in developing today's highly sophisticated information society. As transistors reach their physical limits, the semiconductor industry is seeking the next alternative to sustain its economy and to unfold a new era of human civilization. In this context, a completely new information token, i.e., ions instead of electrons, is promising. The current trend in solid-state nanoionics for applications in energy storage, sensing, and brain-type information processing, requires the ability to control the properties of matter at the ultimate atomic scale. Here, a conceptually novel nanoarchitectonic strategy is proposed for controlling the number of dopant atoms in a solid electrolyte to obtain discrete electrical properties. Using Î±-Ag 2+ Î´ S nanodots with a finite number of nonstoichiometry excess dopants as a model system, a theory matched with experiments is presented that reveals the role of physical parameters, namely, the separation between electrochemical energy levels and the cohesive energy, underlying atomic-scale manipulation of dopants in nanodots. This strategy can be applied to different nanoscale materials as their properties strongly depend on the number of doping atoms/ions, and has the potential to create a new paradigm based on controlled single atom/ion transfer.

The furnace is capable of operation at temperatures up to 2400 degrees , and has been used to obtain calibration graphs for the determination of ppm quantities of bismuth in lead-base alloys, cast irons and stainless steels, and for the determination of cadmium at the ppm level in zinc-base alloys. Milligram samples of the alloys were atomized directly. Calibration graphs for the determination of the elements in solutions were obtained for comparison. The accuracy and precision of the determination are presented and discussed.\n\nA Method to Estimate the Atomic Number and Mass Thickness of Intervening Materials in Uranium and Plutonium Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy Measurements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStreicher, Michael; Brown, Steven; Zhu, Yuefeng; Goodman, David; He, Zhong\n\n2016-10-01\n\nTo accurately characterize shielded special nuclear materials (SNM) using passive gamma-ray spectroscopy measurement techniques, the effective atomic number and the thickness of shielding materials must be measured. Intervening materials between the source and detector may affect the estimated source isotopics (uranium enrichment and plutonium grade) for techniques which rely on raw count rates or photopeak ratios of gamma-ray lines separated in energy. Furthermore, knowledge of the surrounding materials can provide insight regarding the configuration of a device containing SNM. The described method was developed using spectra recorded using high energy resolution CdZnTe detectors, but can be expanded to any gamma-ray spectrometers with energy resolution of better than 1% FWHM at 662 keV. The effective atomic number, Z, and mass thickness of the intervening shielding material are identified by comparing the relative attenuation of different gamma-ray lines and estimating the proportion of Compton scattering interactions to photoelectric absorptions within the shield. While characteristic KÎ± x-rays can be used to identify shielding materials made of high Z elements, this method can be applied to all shielding materials. This algorithm has adequately estimated the effective atomic number for shields made of iron, aluminum, and polyethylene surrounding uranium samples using experimental data. The mass thicknesses of shielding materials have been estimated with a standard error of less than 1.3 g/cm2 for iron shields up to 2.5 cm thick. The effective atomic number was accurately estimated to 26 Â± 5 for all iron thicknesses.\n\nElectronic structure of atoms: atomic spectroscopy information system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKazakov, V.

Original means of visualization of scientific data in the form of spectrograms and Grotrian diagrams have been proposed. Presentation of spectral data in the form of interactive color charts facilitates understanding and analysis of properties of atomic systems. The use of the spectral data of the IS ESA together with its functionality is effective for solving various scientific problems and training of specialists.\n\nQuantification of differences in the effective atomic numbers of healthy and cancerous tissues: A discussion in the context of diagnostics and dosimetry\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTaylor, M. L.; Physical Sciences, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne 3001\n\nPurpose: There are a range of genetic and nongenetic factors influencing the elemental composition of different human tissues. The elemental composition of cancerous tissues frequently differs from healthy tissue of the same organ, particularly in high-Z trace element concentrations. For this reason, one could suggest that this may be exploited in diagnostics and perhaps even influence dosimetry. Methods: In this work, for the first time, effective atomic numbers are computed for common cancerous and healthy tissues using a robust, energy-dependent approach between 10 keV and 100 MeV. These are then quantitatively compared within the context of diagnostics and dosimetry. Results:moreÂ Â» Differences between effective atomic numbers of healthy and diseased tissues are found to be typically less than 10%. Fibrotic tissues and calcifications of the breast exhibit substantial (tens to hundreds of percent) differences to healthy tissue. Expectedly, differences are most pronounced in the photoelectric regime and consequently most relevant for kV imaging/therapy and radionuclides with prominent low-energy peaks. Cancerous tissue of the testes and stomach have lower effective atomic numbers than corresponding healthy tissues, while diseased tissues of the other organ sites typically have higher values. Conclusions: As dose calculation approaches improve in accuracy, there may be an argument for the explicit inclusion of pathologies. This is more the case for breast, penile, prostate, nasopharyngeal, and stomach cancer, less so for testicular and kidney cancer. The calculated data suggest dual-energy computed tomography could potentially improve lesion identification in the aforementioned organs (with the exception of testicular cancer), with most import in breast imaging. Ultimately, however, the differences are very small. It is likely that the assumption of a generic 'tissue ramp' in planning will be sufficient for the foreseeable future, and that the Z differences do\n\nOptimisation of flame parameters for simultaneous multi-element atomic absorption spectrometric determination of trace elements in rocks\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nKane, J.S.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA study is described that identifies the optimum operating conditions for the accurate determination of Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Ag, Bi and Cd using simultaneous multi-element atomic absorption spectrometry. Accuracy was measured in terms of the percentage recoveries of the analytes based on certified values in nine standard reference materials. In addition to identifying optimum operating conditions for accurate analysis, conditions resulting in serious matrix interferences and the magnitude of the interferences were determined. The listed elements can be measured with acceptable accuracy in a lean to stoicheiometric flame at measurement heights ???5-10 mm above the burner.\n\nPlatinum clusters with precise numbers of atoms for preparative-scale catalysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nImaoka, Takane; Akanuma, Yuki; Haruta, Naoki; Tsuchiya, Shogo; Ishihara, Kentaro; Okayasu, Takeshi; Chun, Wang-Jae; Takahashi, Masaki; Yamamoto, Kimihisa\n\n2017-09-25\n\nSubnanometer noble metal clusters have enormous potential, mainly for catalytic applications. Because a difference of only one atom may cause significant changes in their reactivity, a preparation method with atomic-level precision is essential. Although such a precision with enough scalability has been achieved by gas-phase synthesis, large-scale preparation is still at the frontier, hampering practical applications. We now show the atom-precise and fully scalable synthesis of platinum clusters on a milligram scale from tiara-like platinum complexes with various ring numbers (nâ=â5-13). Low-temperature calcination of the complexes on a carbon support under hydrogen stream affords monodispersed platinum clusters, whose atomicity is equivalent to that of the precursor complex. One of the clusters (Pt 10 ) exhibits high catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of styrene compared to that of the other clusters. This method opens an avenue for the application of these clusters to preparative-scale catalysis.The catalytic activity of a noble metal nanocluster is tied to its atomicity. Here, the authors report an atom-precise, fully scalable synthesis of platinum clusters from molecular ring precursors, and show that a variation of only one atom can dramatically change a cluster's reactivity.\n\nSurface faceting and elemental diffusion behaviour at atomic scale for alloy nanoparticles during in situ annealing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChi, Miaofang; Wang, Chao; Lei, Yinkai; Wang, Guofeng; Li, Dongguo; More, Karren L.; Lupini, Andrew; Allard, Lawrence F.; Markovic, Nenad M.; Stamenkovic, Vojislav R.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe catalytic performance of nanoparticles is primarily determined by the precise nature of the surface and near-surface atomic configurations, which can be tailored by post-synthesis annealing effectively and straightforwardly.

M.; Yan, Y. H.; Chen, S. S.; Lu, D. P.; Liu, K. M.; Zou, J. Z.; Zeng, X. R.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nChemical and topological parameters have been widely used for predicting the phase selection in high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Nevertheless, previous studies could be faulted due to the small number of available data points, the negligence of kinetic effects, and the insensitivity to small compositional changes. Here in this work, 92 TiZrHfM, TiZrHfMM, TiZrHfMMM (Mâ=âFe, Cr, V, Nb, Al, Ag, Cu, Ni) HEAs were prepared by melt spinning, to build a reliable and sufficiently large material database to inspect the robustness of previously established parameters. Modification of atomic radii by considering the change of local electronic environment in alloys, was critically found out to be superior in distinguishing the formation of amorphous and crystalline alloys, when compared to using atomic radii of pure elements in topological parameters. Moreover, crystal structures of alloying element were found to play an important role in the amorphous phase formation, which was then attributed to how alloying hexagonal-close-packed elements and face-centered-cubic or body-centered-cubic elements can affect the mixing enthalpy. Findings from this work not only provide parametric studies for HEAs with new and important perspectives, but also reveal possibly a hidden connection among some important concepts in various fields.\n\nNew laboratory atomic data for neutral, singly and doubly ionised iron group elements for astrophysics applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPickering, Juliet C.; Nave, Gillian; Liggins, Florence; Clear, Christian; Ruffoni, Matthew; Sansonetti, Craig\n\n2015-08-01\n\nWe present new laboratory spectroscopic measurements to produce atomic data for astrophysically important species: neutral, singly and doubly ionised iron group elements.We use high resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometry (FTS) (resolving power up to 2x106 at 200nm) to measure atomic spectra, giving accurate line wavelengths (to a few parts in 108), atomic energy levels, hyperfine structure splitting and log gfs (accurate to a few %) (Ruffoni et al this meeting). These data are vital for astrophysical spectral analyses for: line identification, spectrum synthesis, elemental abundance determinations [eg 1], and disentangling of blends etc. It is not possible to theoretically calculate these atomic data to the accuracy needed for modern astrophysics applications.At Imperial College we have a unique visible-VUV FT spectrometer with short wavelength cut-off of 135nm. We supplement FTS data at shorter wavelengths with spectra recorded on the NIST 10.7m grating spectrograph (with phosphor image or photographic plates) and at longer wavelengths in the IR we use the NIST IR FT spectrometer.An elemental spectrum may contain thousands of spectral lines from the IR to VUV. We use these wavelengths to correct known atomic energy levels, and search for new atomic levels. The result is a classified linelist and accurate atomic energy levels.We present progress on iron group element atomic energy levels and wavelengths for V I and V II [2,3], Co III [4], Cr I, Mn I and Mn II, and Ni II.This work is supported by STFC(UK), The Leverhulme Trust, The Royal Society and NASA.References[1] Bergemann M, Pickering JC & Gehren T,âNLTE analysis of Co I/Co II lines in spectra of cool stars with new laboratory hyperfine splitting constants\",MNRAS 401(2) 1334 (2010)[2] Thorne AP, Pickering JC & Semeniuk J,âThe spectrum and term analysis of V IIâ, ApJS 207,13 (2013)[3] Thorne AP, Pickering JC & Semeniuk J,âThe spectrum and term analysis of V I\",ApJS 192,11 (2011)[4] Smillie DG\n\nAspherical-atom modeling of coordination compounds by single-crystal X-ray diffraction allows the correct metal atom to be identified.\n\nPubMed\n\nDittrich, Birger; Wandtke, Claudia M; Meents, Alke; PrÃ¶pper, Kevin; Mondal, Kartik Chandra; Samuel, Prinson P; Amin Sk, Nurul; Singh, Amit Pratap; Roesky, Herbert W; Sidhu, Navdeep\n\n2015-02-02\n\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) is often considered the gold standard in analytical chemistry, as it allows element identification as well as determination of atom connectivity and the solid-state structure of completely unknown samples. Element assignment is based on the number of electrons of an atom, so that a distinction of neighboring heavier elements in the periodic table by XRD is often difficult. A computationally efficient procedure for aspherical-atom least-squares refinement of conventional diffraction data of organometallic compounds is proposed. The iterative procedure is conceptually similar to Hirshfeld-atom refinement (Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A- 2008, 64, 383-393; IUCrJ. 2014, 1,61-79), but it relies on tabulated invariom scattering factors (Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B- 2013, 69, 91-104) and the Hansen/Coppens multipole model; disordered structures can be handled as well. Five linear-coordinate 3d metal complexes, for which the wrong element is found if standard independent-atom model scattering factors are relied upon, are studied, and it is shown that only aspherical-atom scattering factors allow a reliable assignment. The influence of anomalous dispersion in identifying the correct element is investigated and discussed. Â© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Vedat\n\n2017-10-01\n\nRemarkable high-temperature mechanical properties of nickel-based superalloys are correlated with the arrangement of ternary alloying elements in L12-type-ordered Î³â§-Ni3Al intermetallics. In the current study, therefore, high-temperature site occupancy preference and energetic-structural characteristics of atomic short-range ordering (SRO) of ternary alloying X elements (X = Mo, W, Ta, Hf, Re, Ru, Pt or Co) in Ni75Al21.875X3.125 alloy systems have been studied by combining the statistico-thermodynamical theory of ordering and electronic theory of alloys in the pseudopotential approximation. Temperature dependence of site occupancy tendencies of alloying X element atoms has been predicted by calculating partial ordering energies and SRO parameters of Ni-Al, Ni-X and Al-X atomic pairs. It is shown that, all ternary alloying element atoms (except Pt) tend to occupy Al, whereas Pt atoms prefer to substitute for Ni sub-lattice sites of Ni3Al intermetallics. However, in contrast to other X elements, sub-lattice site occupancy characteristics of Re atoms appear to be both temperature- and composition-dependent. Theoretical calculations reveal that site occupancy preference of Re atoms switches from Al to both Ni and Al sites at critical temperatures, Tc, for Re > 2.35 at%. Distribution of Re atoms at both Ni and Al sub-lattice sites above Tc may lead to localised supersaturation of the parent Ni3Al phase and makes possible the formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases. The results of the current theoretical and simulation study are consistent with other theoretical and experimental investigations published in the literature.\n\nElectronic Transmutation (ET): Chemically Turning One Element into Another.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Xinxing; Lundell, Katie A; Olson, Jared K; Bowen, Kit H; Boldyrev, Alexander I\n\n2018-03-08\n\nThe concept of electronic transmutation (ET) depicts the processes that by acquiring an extra electron, an element with the atomic number Z begins to have properties that were known to only belong to its neighboring element with the atomic number Z+1. Based on ET, signature compounds and chemical bonds that are composed of certain elements can now be designed and formed by other electronically transmutated elements. This Minireview summarizes the recent developments and applications of ET on both the theoretical and experimental fronts. Examples on the ET of Groupâ 13 elements into Groupâ 14 elements, Groupâ 14 elements into Groupâ 15 elements, and Groupâ 15 elements into Groupâ 16 elements are discussed. Compounds and chemical bonding composed of carbon, silicon, germanium, phosphorous, oxygen and sulfur now have analogues using transmutated boron, aluminum, gallium, silicon, nitrogen, and phosphorous.

A multiple exponential equation was derived to express the relationship. Various properties were examined, and correlated with the various parameters. Some of the properties considered were: (1) heat of atomization, (2) boiling point, (3) melting point, (4) shear elastic modulus of cubic crystals, (5) thermal conductivity, and (6) refractive index for transparent substances.
