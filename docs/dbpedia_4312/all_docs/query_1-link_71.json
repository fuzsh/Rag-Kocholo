        "text": "Bogdan Bogdanovic could become Serbia’s top scorer at the Olympic Games, as he only need 56 more points to overtake Milos Teodosic.\n\nThe Eagles captain could become his country’s all-time top-scorer if everything goes according to plan. Right now he is in France, where Serbia will play against Les Bleus tonight from 21:00.\n\nSo, he needs 56 points to overtake Milos Teodosic. The number to chase is 1056, while the Atlanta Hawks player is at 1002 points. He would need to average 18 points per game to break the record in the group phase where Serbia will face the USA, South Sudan and Puerto Rico.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Bogdan Bogdanovic is currently seventh in the number of games played. At the Olympics, he could surpass Dejan Tomasevic, who has 71 games, while Nenad Krstic is ahead of him in fifth place with 77 games.\n\nSerbia’s All-time top-scorers list and how many official games they played:\n\n1. Milos Teodosic 1.057 (94)\n\n2. Dejan Bodiroga 1.023 (85)\n\n3. Bogdan Bogdanovic 1.002 (68)\n\n4. Nenad Krstic 933 (77)\n\n5. Nemanja Bjelica 692 (84)\n\n6. Predrag Danilovic 640 (43)\n\n7. Miroslav Raduljica 627 (58)\n\n8. Dejan Tomasevic 502 (71)\n\n9. Predrag Stojakovic 474 (29)"
