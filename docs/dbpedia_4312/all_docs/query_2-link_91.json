        "text": "Page 11295\n\n1 Friday, 9 March 2007\n\n2 [Open session]\n\n3 [The accused entered court]\n\n4 [The accused Milutinovic not present]\n\n5 --- Upon commencing at 9.01 a.m.\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: I have two matters to deal with before we proceed\n\n7 at all with the evidence today. The first is a question I want to direct\n\n8 to Mr. Hannis. The Chamber is faced with an application for certification\n\n9 of a decision made about the evidence of General Clark, and it's an\n\n10 anxious and difficult decision for us to reach, particularly bearing in\n\n11 mind the need to satisfy the second leg of the test. So I don't hide from\n\n12 you the fact that it's not easy for us to decide it.\n\n13 Coincidentally, however, we've received a further submission in\n\n14 relation to the evidence of the witnesses -- the other two American\n\n15 witnesses who are not yet resolved. And in one of the footnotes to that\n\n16 submission it is said: \"The Trial Chamber made clear in its second\n\n17 decision on the Prosecution motion for leave to amend its 65 ter list to\n\n18 add Wesley Clark that the Defence must be able to cross-examine on matters\n\n19 related to credibility of a witness. The United States Government now\n\n20 expressly narrows its requested protective measures for all USG Rule 70\n\n21 witnesses to allow the Defence to question on these matters.\"\n\n22 Now, that on the face of it indicates that it's acceptable in\n\n23 relation to all these witnesses. And what we would like is clarification\n\n24 of that.\n\n25 MR. HANNIS: Your Honour, I will try and obtain that clarification\n\nPage 11296\n\n1 for you. My last communication with the US indicated that was their\n\n2 position with regard to Burns and Philips however it appears it may still\n\n3 be a lingering issue regarding General Clark.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: And I -- you can understand that being at the stage\n\n5 we're at that the -- any significant change in circumstances may be a\n\n6 matter far better dealt with by the Trial Chamber than at a later stage in\n\n7 the proceedings, and that's why it would be helpful to have this\n\n8 clarified.\n\n9 MR. HANNIS: I understand, Your Honour. I've conveyed that and\n\n10 the US is aware of our timetable as well with end of evidence\n\n11 for -- projected for the 23rd of March.\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: Now, I wonder if that's possible to do that today,\n\n13 Mr. Hannis.\n\n14 MR. HANNIS: Because of the time difference we aren't able to hear\n\n15 from Washington until late in the day. I will do what I can, Your Honour,\n\n16 because it is a matter that has been the subject of ongoing discussions.\n\n17 I think when I raised it last, no action was being taken because of our\n\n18 pending request for certification, and it seemed to be that they were\n\n19 waiting the outcome of that to make what I guess is a tougher decision for\n\n20 them.\n\n21 JUDGE BONOMY: But it is a -- one has to, I think, immediately\n\n22 comment that it's a difficult distinction to understand, so that's why --\n\n23 we read it the way it was meant to be but then thought perhaps it should\n\n24 be clarified, because it was a submission in relation to a different\n\n25 matter. So we shall leave that matter in your hands and hope that you can\n\nPage 11297\n\n1 relay an answer to us.\n\n2 MR. HANNIS: I'll do so at the earliest possible moment, Your\n\n3 Honour.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: I now turn to deal with the various objections that\n\n5 were taken to the edited report of Philip Coo which was intimated to the\n\n6 parties and tendered to the Court as his proposed Rule 92 ter statement.\n\n7 I first of all want to make it clear that the Trial Chamber\n\n8 rejects the Defence submission that the proximity of the witness to the\n\n9 Prosecution team is a bar to him giving evidence of fact. There's nothing\n\n10 wrong, in the opinion of the Trial Chamber, with an investigator giving\n\n11 evidence of fact. It is also our view that the fact that he was present\n\n12 at interviews of accused and witnesses does not bar him from giving\n\n13 evidence, either. Indeed, he might even be the vehicle through which\n\n14 evidence is tendered to the Court of what was said by an accused person in\n\n15 an interview and indeed by a witness where there's an issue over the\n\n16 credibility of the witness.\n\n17 We also reject the notion that no part of this report could ever\n\n18 be presented to the Court as his statement; however, in its present form\n\n19 it is entirely unacceptable. So in other words, we do reject it in its\n\n20 present form as an unsuitable way of presenting his evidence. It is\n\n21 essentially the same report as was originally prepared by him as an expert\n\n22 witness, and even in this redacted form it is riddled with expressions of\n\n23 opinion that would be appropriate for only an expert to express.\n\n24 It is also riddled with expressions of conclusions that are for\n\n25 the Court and not for a witness of fact to draw. He interprets material\n\nPage 11298\n\n1 where it's for the Court to interpret it, he speculates in some instances\n\n2 that events in one year must have been such and such because of the\n\n3 circumstances of another year, he reaches conclusions based on limited\n\n4 identified source material, he provides analysis in certain\n\n5 circumstances. And broadly speaking, the Trial Chamber has accepted the\n\n6 criticisms -- the detailed criticisms of the content of this report that\n\n7 were advanced by the Defence.\n\n8 That having been said, if Mr. Coo, as investigator, has obtained\n\n9 information, particularly in the form of documents, and he is on the face\n\n10 of it the appropriate vehicle through which to introduce factual\n\n11 information, including documentary material, then there is no objection to\n\n12 that being done. However, we do note that the documents that are referred\n\n13 to in the report fall into a number of categories which on the face of it\n\n14 don't appear to be matters he ought to be dealing with at all. For\n\n15 example, there are 140 documents that are laws, decrees, rules, orders,\n\n16 decisions, or plans that should be capable of presentation to the Court in\n\n17 a written submission. And hopefully, many of them are the subject of\n\n18 agreement, if not already admitted.\n\n19 There are 31 Serbian print media reports, and these are matters in\n\n20 general which the Chamber has said it will exclude unless satisfied,\n\n21 particularly satisfied, about the authenticity of what is said in a press\n\n22 report. And we gave examples before of reporting particularly by press --\n\n23 by radio and television, but also by print media of the precise terms of\n\n24 an interview. They also include, I think, 17 television or radio\n\n25 programmes and references to 12 web sites. Some of these web site\n\nPage 11299\n\n1 references are obviously relevant and admissible, but in relation to\n\n2 others, there must be some doubt and therefore, again, it may be that the\n\n3 best way of dealing with this is through a written filing.\n\n4 Where we see the limit of Mr. Coo as a vehicle for presentation of\n\n5 material is that he can tell us what was recovered, he can tell us how on\n\n6 the face of material documents recovered they might relate to each other,\n\n7 he might even tell us how documents could possibly have a bearing on\n\n8 events; but for him to tell us that they do or that they appear to him to\n\n9 have some bearing on the events that supports or corroborates other\n\n10 evidence is quite wrong, in view of the earlier decision we took.\n\n11 What we would encourage you to do is -- as a Prosecution team is\n\n12 to follow earlier guidance we've given about written submissions covering\n\n13 authenticity, reliability, relevance, and probative value. Orders and\n\n14 decisions were made in relation to earlier applications to admit documents\n\n15 as free-standing documents, and these orders and decisions contain\n\n16 guidance on how to satisfy the Trial Chamber about the admissibility of\n\n17 these. We also at that stage invited you to specify how the documents\n\n18 tendered fitted into the case, and again you've clearly tried to do it\n\n19 through Mr. Coo going too far, as it were, but it can be done either by\n\n20 him or by you in a written filing within acceptable limits. I can't\n\n21 tell -- we can't tell whether Mr. Coo remains an essential witness in the\n\n22 light of this, but we do not mean for one moment to suggest he's not a\n\n23 person who should give evidence here. It's a question of tailoring what's\n\n24 presented to satisfy, first of all, the original decision made; secondly,\n\n25 the various orders about presentation of evidence that have been made; and\n\nPage 11300\n\n1 lastly, the restrictions that apply to a witness of fact.\n\n2 Now, we understood that parties were anxious for an early\n\n3 determination of this. Obviously, it was a major exercise for the Trial\n\n4 Chamber, and this is as quickly as it could be done. That's why this\n\n5 decision has been given orally rather than in writing, because preparing\n\n6 carefully crafted written decision does take a lot of time. I hope that's\n\n7 comprehensive enough, but we are prepared to offer further guidance should\n\n8 parties seek it in relation to particular elements of what has been\n\n9 decided. We hope to be helpful and not to impede the introduction of any\n\n10 evidence that is going to assist us to arrive at a just conclusion.\n\n11 MR. HANNIS: I thank you for that guidance, Your Honour. We will\n\n12 take note of your remarks this morning and work on how we proceed with\n\n13 Mr. Coo. I would inform the Court that we had anticipated filing today a\n\n14 written submission concerning a number of exhibits along the previous\n\n15 guidance you have given us and as we are done for some witnesses like\n\n16 General Vasiljevic and General DZ.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes. Sorry, there was one other thing I meant to\n\n18 say to you, that I think it is in relation to Vasiljevic that -- yeah.\n\n19 [Trial Chamber and legal officer confer]\n\n20 JUDGE BONOMY: I'm just checking which witness this order relates\n\n21 to, but you may find, if you refer yourself to your own -- to the decision\n\n22 of the 15th of February on the admission of exhibits, and it is in the\n\n23 case of - and it is in relation to Vasiljevic - a good example of you\n\n24 achieving the standards we had set and that you might find following that\n\n25 is the way to proceed.\n\nPage 11301\n\n1 If, Mr. Hannis, you already have in mind a filing, I think it\n\n2 would be unwise to hold it back to add to it. It would be helpful if\n\n3 you've got something ready to tender it as early as possible.\n\n4 MR. HANNIS: No. We do intend to file that today, Your Honour,\n\n5 and then I anticipate we perhaps will be doing another one related to\n\n6 documents regarding Mr. Coo that we don't have on this current list.\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you very much.\n\n8 MR. HANNIS: Thank you. If there's nothing further, Your Honour,\n\n9 may I be excused?\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes.\n\n11 MR. HANNIS: Thank you.\n\n12 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: That exhausts the matters that I wish to deal with,\n\n14 but I was told that Mr. Lukic might have procedural issues, also -- or\n\n15 Mr. Ivetic.\n\n16 MR. IVETIC: We do, Your Honour. I believe Mr. Fila has the first\n\n17 word on this, though.\n\n18 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Fila.\n\n19 MR. FILA: [Interpretation] Your Honours, before we bring in the\n\n20 next witness, I wish to raise an issue as follows: Yesterday at 2115,\n\n21 less than 12 hours before the start of the session, I received additional\n\n22 information about Witness Protic from Mr. Stamp, if I'm correct, and at\n\n23 around 11.00 I received this in the Serbian language. Probably the\n\n24 Prosecutor thinks I ought to sit by my screen all night so that I can\n\n25 receive information whenever it suits them. On page 3 of this\n\nPage 11302\n\n1 information - because you know there are manners and politeness to be\n\n2 observed - there are additional comments and suddenly a sentence turned up\n\n3 that the witness was aware that Nikola Sainovic was responsible from\n\n4 Kosovo from 1989, I wish to stress this, for some 20 years.\n\n5 Yesterday I heard from Witness Crosland that he was collecting\n\n6 electricity bills on Kosovo and now we will hear -- excuse me -- yesterday\n\n7 we heard from Witness Kickert that Sainovic collected electricity bills\n\n8 from OIDP down there and now I hear from another witness that he did this\n\n9 for 20 years. I think that according to Rule 65 ter, there's no mention\n\n10 of Sainovic in the documents. I read all the witness statements, including\n\n11 this Protic, but Rule 65 ter on the 10th of May, 2006, has no mention of\n\n12 Sainovic. According to --\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: Let me interrupt just briefly.\n\n14 Mr. Stamp, is 1989 correct?\n\n15 MR. STAMP: That is what the witness said --\n\n16 JUDGE BONOMY: That's --\n\n17 MR. STAMP: This is supplementary information --\n\n18 JUDGE BONOMY: Secondly, are you leading evidence about this?\n\n19 MR. STAMP: No, Your Honour.\n\n20 JUDGE BONOMY: That answers the question. If it's information\n\n21 given to you about what the witness can say, but the Prosecution do not\n\n22 intend to lead that evidence; therefore, there's no need for them to amend\n\n23 the 65 ter summary.\n\n24 MR. FILA: [Interpretation] Your Honour, if the witness is not to\n\n25 be examined on Sainovic, then I don't need to say this. But if he is\n\nPage 11303\n\n1 examined about Sainovic, I have to object --\n\n2 JUDGE BONOMY: He's not going to be, you've been told, Mr. Fila.\n\n3 MR. FILA: [Interpretation] I am then very happy that last night at\n\n4 9.00 p.m. I received unnecessary information which made me nervous all\n\n5 night. Thank you. Pay them back.\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Ivetic.\n\n7 MR. IVETIC: Thank you, Your Honour. Our concerns also relate to\n\n8 this material that was received last night and to material that was\n\n9 received I believe March the 6th was the original disclosure of a\n\n10 transcript, a fairly lengthy transcript, from some proceedings in Belgrade\n\n11 relating to this witness. The main problem that we have is that we have\n\n12 been quite anxious for this witness for quite some time to get information\n\n13 from the Office of the Prosecutor since the information disclosed for him\n\n14 was rather scant [Realtime transcript read in error \"constant\"]. Toward\n\n15 that end, earlier this week I had sent some e-mail inquiries to the Office\n\n16 of the Prosecutor regarding any statements they have of the witness --\n\n17 relating to whether they have any additional witnesses for the witness and\n\n18 in particular an OTP statement for the witness and whether he has been\n\n19 questioned, et cetera, so we can get information and details. The\n\n20 response at that time was no we have nothing. Line 18 of the transcript\n\n21 of this page says \"rather constant.\" I said \"rather scant,\" so that should\n\n22 be corrected.\n\n23 But in any event, we now -- first of all, the testimony that was\n\n24 tendered to us two days ago for the first time gives details that would\n\n25 appear to contradict items that had been disclosed for him previously, but\n\nPage 11304\n\n1 we were not in a position, obviously, to go out into the field and verify\n\n2 some of these matters. In particular he mentions the names of several\n\n3 other individuals, including a General Obrad Stevanovic, who seemed to all\n\n4 of a sudden fit the description of individuals who have previously been\n\n5 identified as Sreten Lukic in the prior statements of the witness. And\n\n6 now where the 65 ter summary for this witness was very, very general and\n\n7 stated that -- left one with the impression that he did not know specific\n\n8 dates for anything.\n\n9 Now all of a sudden in the three pages of supplemental information\n\n10 sheet that we received last night, it's replete with quite specific\n\n11 details that had we had earlier we could have undertaken some efforts to\n\n12 seek out documentation or verification or contradiction for which we could\n\n13 try to confront the witness. The most glaring example I can give you is\n\n14 that in the previous discussions that the -- the previous statements and\n\n15 interviews that were given to us, Mr. Protic claimed that his\n\n16 communications were via mobile phone and did not make any reference to\n\n17 anything else. Now in the supplemental information sheet he gives very\n\n18 specific fixed locations, official phones that he used that, if we had had\n\n19 this knowledge prior to last night, we would have at least tried to have\n\n20 obtained documentation to verify whether, in fact, the phone calls were\n\n21 made from such official land-lines, as he now claims.\n\n22 I really don't know how to -- I don't know what to ask for for\n\n23 relief, Your Honour, so I'm just trying to --\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: I think we may have reached a witness then where it\n\n25 may be necessary for you at a later stage to invite the Court to re-call\n\nPage 11305\n\n1 him, or it may be that you take advantage of your inability in one sense\n\n2 to confront him and invite us to treat his evidence less -- as less\n\n3 reliable -- or less weighty, I suppose, in light of later evidence you\n\n4 submit in the Defence case, because obviously you still have loads of time\n\n5 to carry out your inquiries and present other material.\n\n6 MR. IVETIC: I agree, Your Honour, I agree. I am just very\n\n7 frustrated at this stage that --\n\n8 JUDGE BONOMY: I think it also has to be said that there has been\n\n9 great difficulty in securing the attendance of this witness, and therefore\n\n10 it's understandable that there may be matters coming to light now. We've\n\n11 been very critical of the Prosecution in general for not interviewing\n\n12 witnesses at an earlier stage, but there's a limit to how easy it might be\n\n13 to do that, and this is one where they plainly have had difficulty.\n\n14 MR. IVETIC: They -- it's my understanding he gave public\n\n15 testimony in Belgrade a month ago and that the OTP did have a\n\n16 representative at those proceedings.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes, but it's public, Mr. Ivetic.\n\n18 MR. IVETIC: I know.\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: And therefore, that applies to both. I assume that\n\n20 you're taking cognizance of these developments, too.\n\n21 MR. IVETIC: I'm trying to as much as we can. So I just want to\n\n22 bring that to Your Honours' attention.\n\n23 JUDGE BONOMY: I think that's a very fair way to present this, but\n\n24 we will briefly discuss it and decide whether we think there's anything\n\n25 else that ought be done at this stage.\n\nPage 11306\n\n1 Before doing that, I will hear if Mr. Stamp wants to say anything.\n\n2 MR. STAMP: Just two matters. We disclosed everything we have had\n\n3 from this witness at the earliest available opportunity, firstly; and\n\n4 without sort of doing an inventory of every factual submission by my\n\n5 learned friend just now, which I would not agree with as being entirely\n\n6 correct, I just say that if there are these contradictions, as he has\n\n7 suggested, then there are -- there would be, if they existed, pretty\n\n8 obvious on the face of the documents that he has been given and matters\n\n9 worthy of cross-examination if that is the situation.\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you, Mr. Stamp.\n\n11 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: We note the observations that have been made. We\n\n13 will proceed to hear the evidence of this witness. If a remedy is\n\n14 required, we shall deal with that at the stage when the matter is\n\n15 presented to us.\n\n16 MR. STAMP: That witness, Your Honours, is Bozidar Protic.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n18 [Trial Chamber and legal officer confer]\n\n19 [The witness entered court]\n\n20 JUDGE BONOMY: Good morning, Mr. Protic.\n\n21 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Good morning.\n\n22 JUDGE BONOMY: Would you please make the solemn declaration to\n\n23 speak the truth by reading aloud the document which will now be placed\n\n24 before you.\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak\n\nPage 11307\n\n1 the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n2 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you. Please be seated.\n\n3 Please make yourself comfortable, Mr. Protic. And I can't see\n\n4 what you've taken from your bag at the moment, but if it is documents\n\n5 please don't refer to them at this stage. Any documents -- oh, it's just\n\n6 simply your glasses. Okay. Thank you.\n\n7 Our system here, which may be different from any other system\n\n8 you've experience of, involves immediate questioning by counsel rather\n\n9 than the Judges. And we start with the Prosecutor, who will ask you\n\n10 questions, and then you will be cross-examined by those counsel for the\n\n11 accused who wish to do so. It may be that there is only one of the\n\n12 Defence counsel who wishes to do so; it's not clear at the moment and it\n\n13 will depend on your evidence. We'll start straight away with the\n\n14 Prosecutor, and that is Mr. Stamp.\n\n15 Mr. Stamp.\n\n16 MR. STAMP: Thank you very much, Your Honour.\n\n17 WITNESS: BOZIDAR PROTIC\n\n18 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n19 Examination by Mr. Stamp:\n\n20 Q. Good morning, Mr. Protic. Could we start by you stating your full\n\n21 name.\n\n22 A. Very well. Bozidar Protic.\n\n23 Q. Are you still employed or are you retired?\n\n24 A. Retired.\n\n25 Q. Prior to retirement, what was your job?\n\nPage 11308\n\n1 A. I worked for the Ministry of the Interior as a driver.\n\n2 Q. Were you a member of the police force of the -- the police force\n\n3 of the Ministry of the Interior?\n\n4 A. Yes, I was.\n\n5 Q. For how long?\n\n6 A. From 1975 until the date of my retirement.\n\n7 Q. About when did you retire?\n\n8 A. In 2001.\n\n9 Q. Now, I understand that in respect to certain events that occurred\n\n10 during your employment as a driver with the Ministry of the Interior in\n\n11 1999, you were interviewed by an investigative judge, one Mr. Dilparic,\n\n12 Milan Dilparic on the 5th of December, 2003. Do you recall that?\n\n13 A. I do.\n\n14 Q. And that interview was recorded on tape and the tape was played\n\n15 over to you and you affirmed that it was correct. Do you recall that as\n\n16 well?\n\n17 A. I remember.\n\n18 Q. A couple years later on the 29th of June, 2006, do you recall\n\n19 giving a sworn statement to the prosecutor Stankovic?\n\n20 A. I do.\n\n21 Q. And that --\n\n22 MR. LUKIC: Excuse me, Your Honour. Objection. I don't remember\n\n23 that there is a sworn statement in front of the Prosecutor.\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Stamp.\n\n25 MR. STAMP: Very well. My friend is probably correct, depending\n\nPage 11309\n\n1 on how you use the word.\n\n2 Q. When you gave the statement to Mr. Stankovic, you were cautioned\n\n3 about your obligation to speak the truth under Serbian law and the law in\n\n4 respect to perjury if you did not speak the truth. Is that correct?\n\n5 A. Correct. Judge Dilparic warned me that before the Court I should\n\n6 tell the truth and nothing but the truth, and I did that.\n\n7 Q. Okay. But let's move now to the 29th of June, 2006. You said\n\n8 that that date you gave a statement to the Deputy War Crimes Prime\n\n9 Minister [sic] Dragoljub Stankovic. Do you recall that he cautioned you\n\n10 of your obligation to tell the truth on that occasion and not to withhold\n\n11 information and that false testimony constituted a criminal offence. Do\n\n12 you recall that?\n\n13 MR. LUKIC: Again, mistake, I guess.\n\n14 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes, Mr. Lukic.\n\n15 MR. LUKIC: It says here Prime Minister Dragoljub Stankovic. It\n\n16 was the Prosecutor.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Yeah, well, yes, I note that, and no doubt, it will\n\n18 be corrected. It doesn't alter the question.\n\n19 MR. STAMP:\n\n20 Q. Do you recall that, Mr. Protic?\n\n21 A. I do, yes.\n\n22 MR. LUKIC: If my learned friend could point out in the statement\n\n23 given by -- to the Prosecutor where this witness was cautioned.\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, the one I have, Mr. Lukic, at the bottom of\n\n25 the first page in the English: \"Having been advised pursuant to Article\n\nPage 11310\n\n1 102, paragraph 2 of the ZKP to tell the truth and not withhold\n\n2 information. He was then warned that giving false testimony constitutes a\n\n3 criminal offence.\"\n\n4 MR. LUKIC: I apologise.\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n6 Mr. Stamp.\n\n7 MR. STAMP:\n\n8 Q. And on the 8th of February this year, that's last month, did you\n\n9 testify in respect to the same matters in a trial in Belgrade before the\n\n10 Belgrade District Court?\n\n11 A. Yes, I testified there.\n\n12 Q. And have you had an opportunity to review the record of these\n\n13 three different occasions when you spoke about these events in 1999?\n\n14 A. Yes. After each of my testimonies, I was given records of my\n\n15 testimony.\n\n16 Q. And was what you said in -- on each of those three occasions true,\n\n17 to the best of your knowledge and belief?\n\n18 A. Yes, of course.\n\n19 Q. You did, however, indicate that there were a couple matters you\n\n20 wanted to correct, and I'd like to just take you through them briefly. In\n\n21 this statement you gave to Mr. Stankovic at pages 3 to 4 of the English\n\n22 version, and it's 2 to 3 of the B/C/S version, we see at the top of the\n\n23 English version here it is written: \"I made three trips to the 13th May\n\n24 (redacted)\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 11311\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 (redacted)\n\n6 (redacted)\n\n7 (redacted)\n\n8 (redacted)\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted)\n\n16 (redacted)\n\n17 (redacted)\n\n18 (redacted)\n\n19 (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted)\n\n21 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you, Mr. Stamp.\n\n22 MR. STAMP:\n\n23 Q. It is stated in the record by Prosecutor Stankovic that when you\n\n24 spoke to Mr. Sreten Lukic, he addressed you by your first name. Is that\n\n25 correct? How did he address you?\n\nPage 11312\n\n1 A. By my family name, Protic.\n\n2 MR. LUKIC: Can we refrain from the leading questions from now on,\n\n3 please.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Stamp.\n\n5 MR. STAMP: Very well, Your Honour.\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: It's possibly fortunate that the answer was not\n\n7 contained in the question on this particular occasion.\n\n8 MR. STAMP: Your Honour, I do believe I lead in respect to what is\n\n9 already said in the statements.\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: I understand that, but this is a good example of\n\n11 where I think it's not a good idea.\n\n12 MR. STAMP: Very well.\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: It undoubtedly will devalue the evidence in this\n\n14 sort of situation. If you feel the need to ask questions orally of a\n\n15 witness who has already answered many questions in writing, I think they\n\n16 still need to be open questions; otherwise, their value will be lost. And\n\n17 I think the objection is well-founded in relation to this particular\n\n18 question.\n\n19 MR. STAMP: Very well, Your Honour.\n\n20 There might be an issue with respect to security of a witness, and\n\n21 I'm wondering if perhaps we could go into private session briefly for me\n\n22 to raise it.\n\n23 JUDGE BONOMY: Private session, please.\n\n24 [Private session]\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 11313\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 (redacted)\n\n6 [Open session]\n\n7 THE REGISTRAR: We are in open session, Your Honours.\n\n8 MR. STAMP:\n\n9 Q. You are telling us how Mr. Lukic addressed you. What did he call\n\n10 you?\n\n11 A. Normally, the senior -- the superiors or supervisors would address\n\n12 their subordinates by their first name unless they were officially\n\n13 informing them of something.\n\n14 Q. What name did Mr. Lukic use to refer to you? What did he call you\n\n15 when he spoke with you?\n\n16 A. Normally he would address me by my last name.\n\n17 Q. And at other times what would he call you?\n\n18 A. He always addressed me by my last name, if I remember correctly.\n\n19 Q. Did he have a particular way of addressing you when he addressed\n\n20 you by your last name? What word did he use, if you can recall, to speak\n\n21 to you?\n\n22 A. Protic.\n\n23 Q. Very well. If we could move to --\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: Is there a passage we should be looking at in this\n\n25 connection, Mr. Stamp?\n\nPage 11314\n\n1 MR. STAMP: This is in the English transcript. This is the\n\n2 third-to-last paragraph and it is in the last three lines. He just --\n\n3 JUDGE BONOMY: On what page, sorry?\n\n4 MR. STAMP: Page 2.\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: Of -- page 2.\n\n6 MR. STAMP: The record of Mr. Stankovic reads: \"I suppose that he\n\n7 recognised my voice, as he addressed me by my first name,\" and the witness\n\n8 says he addressed him as Protic.\n\n9 JUDGE BONOMY: I'm sorry. I don't seem to have that. This is\n\n10 page 2 of --\n\n11 MR. STAMP: Page 2 of --\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: You said it was the last three lines of a page.\n\n13 MR. STAMP: The last three lines of the third-to-last paragraph of\n\n14 page 2.\n\n15 JUDGE BONOMY: Oh, I see. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Thank you.\n\n16 MR. STAMP: Your Honour -- Your Honours.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Stamp.\n\n18 MR. STAMP: Because of the circumstances in which we managed to\n\n19 get this testimony or this witness here, we have sent the material as\n\n20 quickly as it was available. We sent originally the draft transcript to\n\n21 the CLSS to prepare official, final transcript as early as possible, and\n\n22 when we got that we sent them. I think that Your Honours should have the\n\n23 last final translations from CLSS. So if it is not you do have --\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: No. I've found it now. I just was looking in the\n\n25 wrong place. Sorry. Thank you.\n\nPage 11315\n\n1 MR. STAMP: Very well. Thank you.\n\n2 Q. The last correction we could make, Mr. Protic, if we then move on.\n\n3 It is recorded at page 7 of the English version of the transcript of your\n\n4 testimony in February that you stopped by at the station in -- the police\n\n5 station in Kladovo and spoke to chief Sperlic. Is that name correct,\n\n6 Sperlic?\n\n7 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n8 Q. Can you remember the name of the chief of police in Kladovo at the\n\n9 time?\n\n10 A. Yes. His last name is Sperlic.\n\n11 MR. STAMP: Your Honours, the statement or the transcript of the\n\n12 interview by the investigating judge dated the 5th of December, 2003, is\n\n13 marked P2816. The statement the witness made to the Prosecutor Stankovic\n\n14 of the 29th of June, 2006, is marked P2817. And his testimony before the\n\n15 district court in Belgrade is marked 2824, that testimony dated the 8th of\n\n16 February, 2007. I tender the three documents, subject to the correction\n\n17 that he has just made, and ask that they be received in evidence under\n\n18 Rule 89(F) in lieu of oral testimony he could give in this court.\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic.\n\n20 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour, I think that we have already\n\n21 announced that we are going to object the admission of the testimony from\n\n22 this year that has been disclosed to us late, and we also think that,\n\n23 actually, none of these statements could be admitted under 92 ter rule. I\n\n24 would leave it to Your Honours to decide on that. Definitely we would\n\n25 object the last one.\n\nPage 11316\n\n1 JUDGE BONOMY: The motion is to admit them under 89(F).\n\n2 [Defence counsel confer]\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: Because in the 65 ter statement of this witness it's\n\n4 under 92 ter, so it's -- created the confusion. But anyways we would\n\n5 object if it's proposed to be admitted under 89(F).\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n7 MR. LUKIC: Thank you.\n\n8 [Trial Chamber confers]\n\n9 JUDGE BONOMY: The only suggested basis for opposing this is the\n\n10 late notification. That's an issue we've really dealt with already in the\n\n11 earlier decision made in relation to Mr. Ivetic's objection and therefore\n\n12 we will admit these three documents.\n\n13 I would just like to try to clarify one thing, and that is the\n\n14 reference on page 2 of the English. But what I would like on the screen\n\n15 is the third-last paragraph in English on page 2 in the B/C/S, and that's\n\n16 of P2816. Now, that's not the document I have got as 2816. Is the 5th\n\n17 of -- sorry. No. It is my mistake. Sorry. It's 2817.\n\n18 Mr. Protic, you'll see on the screen part of your statement which\n\n19 you gave to the Prosecutor Stankovic, and if you look at the large\n\n20 paragraph filling the middle of the page, the centre of the page mainly,\n\n21 and go to the end of that paragraph, could you read to me the last two\n\n22 sentences. The part where it says: \"I suppose that he recognised my\n\n23 voice ...\" Could you read that and the rest to the end of the paragraph,\n\n24 that's two sentences at the end. Read it aloud, please.\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I'm not sure what it is that I'm\n\nPage 11317\n\n1 supposed to read.\n\n2 JUDGE BONOMY: You see the -- on your screen at the moment, the\n\n3 top paragraph that you can see on the screen, go to the end of that\n\n4 paragraph and read to me the last two sentences.\n\n5 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"On the first occasion he ordered me\n\n6 to go to Janjevo and to report,\" is that the part.\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: No. It's the part immediately before that, the end\n\n8 of the paragraph above that, the very end of it, the last two sentences.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You mean the part where it says: \"I\n\n10 presume\" --\n\n11 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes.\n\n12 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"I presume that he recognised my\n\n13 voice, too, because he addressed me by name. And on that occasion\n\n14 JUDGE BONOMY: That's fine. Stop there. Read it again, the same\n\n15 sentence, read it again, please.\n\n16 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] \"I presume that he recognised my\n\n17 voice, too, because he addressed me by name.\" It should in fact say \"by\n\n18 my last name.\"\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: But I wanted to check the accuracy of our English\n\n20 translation, and it would appear that we have an inaccurate English\n\n21 translation which is not a matter for you, but that's why we were trying\n\n22 to clarify it.\n\n23 MR. LUKIC: No, Your Honour, you have exact translation. He made\n\n24 mistake. He said differently today.\n\n25 JUDGE BONOMY: That, Mr. Lukic, is a matter for cross-examination.\n\nPage 11318\n\n1 MR. LUKIC: But the translation was not wrong and is not wrong.\n\n2 JUDGE BONOMY: Well --\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: The translation is correct.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: No. The witness has read the words in B/C/S --\n\n5 MR. LUKIC: Yes.\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: -- and the interpreter has interpreted them. Are\n\n7 you challenging that interpretation?\n\n8 MR. LUKIC: No, but we have different in the statement and in the\n\n9 testimony today; that's what I'm telling you.\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: All I'm clarifying is what the witness said in his\n\n11 statement, and it's inaccurately translated in English as I understand it\n\n12 now.\n\n13 MR. IVETIC: Your Honour, in B/C/S \"ime\" is first name,\n\n14 \"prezime\" is last name, so it is not incorrectly translated --\n\n15 JUDGE BONOMY: You --\n\n16 MR. IVETIC: -- correct the translation.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Hold on. What you're doing is challenging the\n\n18 translation, as I understand it. You're challenging what the interpreter\n\n19 has just told us the witness said. And if that's the case, I will have it\n\n20 reported upon by CLSS, as we have done in the past. But let's be clear\n\n21 what it is we are challenging. Now, you're challenging the way in which\n\n22 the interpreter today has translated the words of Mr. Protic. Is that\n\n23 correct?\n\n24 MR. LUKIC: In line -- Your Honour, in line 23, page 23, line 18,\n\n25 it's correctly translated. \"I presume\" -- it just escaped. \"I presumed\n\nPage 11319\n\n1 that he recognised my voice, too, because he addressed me by name\" --\n\n2 JUDGE BONOMY: That's the -- that's fine, and that's what I\n\n3 understood the interpreter to say. But that's not what the English says.\n\n4 The English translation says: \"By my first name,\" and that's the bit I\n\n5 was clarifying.\n\n6 MR. LUKIC: Name, first name is the same meaning in B/C/S.\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: Well --\n\n8 MR. LUKIC: That can be checked.\n\n9 JUDGE BONOMY: Is the interpreter able to give any guidance on\n\n10 this?\n\n11 THE INTERPRETER: Your Honour, the B/C/S term \"ime\" can indeed be\n\n12 interpreted both as first name and as name. The interpreter strived to\n\n13 take the neutral form.\n\n14 THE INTERPRETER: Note of the French booth: In the Serbian\n\n15 version it is the word \"first name\" which is used and not just \"name\" or\n\n16 \"surname.\" It is first name.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, Mr. Stamp, it's back to you now.\n\n18 MR. STAMP:\n\n19 Q. Well, whatever the translation is here, Mr. Protic, you recall\n\n20 what he would call you. What would he call you on formal occasions when\n\n21 you were among other police personnel?\n\n22 A. In the presence of others, by my last name officially as Protic.\n\n23 When we were on our own sometimes he would call me Protic and sometimes\n\n24 Proto.\n\n25 Q. Mr. Protic, it is perhaps unclear from the three statements\n\nPage 11320\n\n1 exactly where you went to and where you delivered bodies to on the four\n\n2 trips that you spoke of. So I'm just going to ask you quickly to take us\n\n3 through them one by one.\n\n4 On the first trip, where did you collect bodies from and where did\n\n5 you deliver them to?\n\n6 A. On the first occasion I received orders from my immediate superior\n\n7 Dragic Nenadic, who told me that he had spoken to General Zekovic, and he\n\n8 told me that through my friends I should find a truck for me to carry out\n\n9 a task which was very important and which was in the interest of the\n\n10 state. I did that. I had a friend, Tode Kurbalija, a refugee from\n\n11 Croatia, who had a Mercedes truck with a temporary licence plate, 18BG and\n\n12 the year.\n\n13 Q. Thank you. Excuse me, Mr. Protic. What you just told us is in\n\n14 two of the statements we have before us. I just simply want to clarify:\n\n15 From where did you pick up bodies on your first trip and where did you\n\n16 deliver them to?\n\n17 A. A place called Tekija, not far from Kladovo, from a refrigerator\n\n18 truck which had appeared from the Danube. And the bodies were put from\n\n19 there onto the truck and I drove them to Batajnica. And that was the\n\n20 first trip I made of that nature.\n\n21 Q. How many bodies were there? Just a number. Give me a figure.\n\n22 How many bodies were there?\n\n23 A. Fifty-four.\n\n24 Q. Thank you.\n\n25 MR. STAMP: Could we pull up P600.\n\nPage 11321\n\n1 This is an item which is already in evidence, Your Honours. I do\n\n2 apologise. It is not indicated on the notification, but it should not\n\n3 present much of a problem, I don't think. It is a photograph.\n\n4 Could you just blow it up a little bit.\n\n5 Q. Do you recognise this vehicle, Mr. Protic?\n\n6 A. Yes, it is a Mercedes truck. It's got a -- it's green and it has\n\n7 a white container on top and it said \"Mesna Industrija,\" meat industry\n\n8 \"Djakovica.\"\n\n9 Q. Well, have you seen this truck before, the one depicted in this\n\n10 picture; and where, if you have?\n\n11 A. Yes, I saw it in the place called Tekija after it was dragged out\n\n12 of the Danube, and later on in pieces near Petrovo Selo where it was\n\n13 destroyed with explosives.\n\n14 Q. Did this truck contain -- when you saw it in Tekija first, did it\n\n15 contain anything? What were the contents of the truck when you saw it in\n\n16 Tekija first?\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: I think you have the answer to that at line 15, on\n\n18 page 26, as complete an answer, I think, as you could expect.\n\n19 MR. STAMP: Very well. I was hoping that he would refer to the\n\n20 particular truck and --\n\n21 Q. When you saw it destroyed -- or could I ask you to explain what\n\n22 you mean when you say that you saw it later in pieces near Petrovo Selo\n\n23 where it was destroyed in pieces. When was it that you saw it in pieces?\n\n24 A. I saw it in pieces when I brought the next load of bodies from the\n\n25 place called Janjevo. I passed by the truck, very close by it, before\n\nPage 11322\n\n1 entering the centre. It was on a clearing on the right-hand side.\n\n2 Q. How did you come to know that it was destroyed by explosives?\n\n3 A. I heard from the people who were working there, and also I\n\n4 recognised the truck because I was familiar with parts of it. I could\n\n5 recognise them.\n\n6 Q. You said your second trip, just now, was from Janjevo to Petrovo\n\n7 Selo; that's correct?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. How many bodies did you transport on that occasion?\n\n10 A. Seventeen or 19. I think it's more likely to be 17.\n\n11 Q. And the third trip was -- where did you collect the bodies and\n\n12 where did you deliver them to?\n\n13 A. The southern part of Kosovska Mitrovica, near the freight railway\n\n14 station, in a wood industry shed where there were channels for fixing\n\n15 machinery and vehicles.\n\n16 Q. And where did you deliver them to?\n\n17 A. To Petrovo Selo.\n\n18 Q. Was this a different area in Petrovo Selo as the previous trip or\n\n19 was it the same place?\n\n20 A. The same place near the centre, but not the same pit. It was\n\n21 another pit very close to the first one; less than 50 or 60 metres apart,\n\n22 they were.\n\n23 Q. About how many bodies did you transport on that trip?\n\n24 A. Fifty-five or 56. Over 50.\n\n25 Q. The fourth and final trip that you made, where did you collect the\n\nPage 11323\n\n1 bodies and where did you deliver them to?\n\n2 A. More or less in the centre of Pristina, near the publishing house\n\n3 or the newspaper house. It was called Rilindija. There was a\n\n4 refrigerator truck on the parking lot. It was the largest size that such\n\n5 trucks come in.\n\n6 Q. And where did you take these bodies to?\n\n7 A. To Batajnica, to the centre for special units.\n\n8 Q. Now, about how many bodies did you take on that fourth trip?\n\n9 A. The refrigerator truck was closed. (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted). I didn't see\n\n13 them myself.\n\n14 Q. Now, in your statement you told us that General Zekovic gave you\n\n15 the phone number --\n\n16 MR. LUKIC: I'm sorry, which statement?\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic.\n\n18 MR. LUKIC: I just need to know which statement because we have\n\n19 several.\n\n20 MR. STAMP:\n\n21 Q. In the statement that you gave to Mr. Stankovic and in -- in both\n\n22 the statements that you gave to Mr. Stankovic and the interview with\n\n23 Mr. Dilparic you said that you got the orders to go and collect the bodies\n\n24 from General Zekovic, and in both of those statements you also said that\n\n25 you were given a contact phone number to call when you were in Kosovo, on\n\nPage 11324\n\n1 the three occasions that you went to Kosovo.\n\n2 On the first occasion you went to Kosovo, where did you call from?\n\n3 A. The first time that I went to Kosovo, it was during the bombing.\n\n4 The police headquarters did not have a constant location but moved around,\n\n5 depending on the situation, for security reasons.\n\n6 The first time I went to Pristina, the headquarters was across the\n\n7 road from the Bozur Hotel in the very centre of Pristina. It was on the\n\n8 fourth floor. I went up there. I dialled the number mentioned here.\n\n9 That's a Belgrade number without an extension before it for Belgrade or\n\n10 for Pristina. I contacted a person who told me how I should act; that I\n\n11 should go in the direction of Skopje. There would be a Golf car driving\n\n12 in front of me, it would be a dark red colour, metallic, that I should\n\n13 follow that car and that everything would proceed as agreed, everything\n\n14 would be all right.\n\n15 Q. Why did you call from the police headquarters?\n\n16 A. I got that number when I set out from Belgrade. That was my\n\n17 connection so that I wouldn't waste time because the matter was urgent.\n\n18 Q. Now, you called from the police headquarters. Why did you call\n\n19 from that place?\n\n20 A. From Pristina. Well, that was the safest place. I thought it was\n\n21 my service, my people. Why would someone else have to listen to this\n\n22 conversation? And I was told I could use the telephone in the\n\n23 headquarters.\n\n24 Q. Who told you that?\n\n25 A. General Zekovic, when I set out from Belgrade. And every time I\n\nPage 11325\n\n1 set out from Belgrade I received all my instructions from General Zekovic.\n\n2 Q. Now, during that time, could you normally call a Belgrade number\n\n3 from Kosovo without using the area code?\n\n4 A. Only from the headquarters. From elsewhere in the town you would\n\n5 have to dial the area code, but in the Pristina headquarters there was\n\n6 always a direct line, as if you were calling to Belgrade from Belgrade.\n\n7 That was the case in Bujanovac. And it was a special line, a special\n\n8 connection, between the headquarters and the MUP, and I thought it was\n\n9 normal for that to be so.\n\n10 Q. Well, we have your statements to Mr. Stankovic and Mr. Dilparic in\n\n11 which you said that you spoke to Mr. Lukic, and you told us in the\n\n12 statement that you gave to Mr. Stankovic what he said to you on the first\n\n13 occasion, that is, when you took the bodies from Janjevo to Petrovo Selo.\n\n14 When I say \"first occasion,\" I mean the first occasion you went to Kosovo\n\n15 which would be the second trip you made. Can you --\n\n16 MR. LUKIC: If it can be -- if it just can be pointed out where in\n\n17 the Dilparic statement we can find this.\n\n18 MR. STAMP: I'm sorry, it's not in Mr. Dilparic's statement.\n\n19 MR. LUKIC: Then rephrase the question, please.\n\n20 MR. STAMP:\n\n21 Q. On the second occasion when you went to Kosovo, did you call the\n\n22 number you were given?\n\n23 A. Always the same number.\n\n24 Q. And did you call it? Did you dial it on the second occasion?\n\n25 A. Oh, yes, yes. Yes.\n\nPage 11326\n\n1 Q. Now, you said you spoke to Mr. Lukic. Can you tell us what he\n\n2 said to you on the second occasion that you went to Kosovo.\n\n3 A. When I dialled the number, I was almost sure it was Lukic's\n\n4 voice. Whether it would be --\n\n5 Q. Well, we are going to get to that. The question is: What did he\n\n6 say to you when you dialled the number on the second occasion that you\n\n7 went to Kosovo to collect bodies?\n\n8 A. That voice, let's say, told me that I should go in the direction\n\n9 of Skopje, that I would have a Golf car driving in front of me, dark red\n\n10 metallic in colour, and that I should follow it, which is what I did of\n\n11 course. In the direction of Skopje at the crossroads for Lipljani and\n\n12 Janjevo, I turned left towards Janjevo. The Golf stayed there and I drove\n\n13 on for another kilometre or a kilometre and a half and arrived in the\n\n14 centre of Janjevo where I was met by the local policemen. There was a\n\n15 Niva-make car in which they set out in front of me toward the hills. I\n\n16 drove the truck as far as I could, and when I could go no further, I\n\n17 stopped.\n\n18 On that occasion there was a small loader, a tractor with a scoop\n\n19 in front and one in back. One was wider and one was smaller, a bucket.\n\n20 It went to the nearby woods. I could hear the sound of the machine\n\n21 working. I waited about half an hour. A tractor full of soil turned up.\n\n22 They tipped up the trailer and this one loaded the bodies onto my truck.\n\n23 That was that second trip.\n\n24 Q. Okay. Very well. Now, as I said, this is in your statement\n\n25 already and we have time limitations, so, Mr. Protic, I'm going to ask you\n\nPage 11327\n\n1 to please just answer the questions directly.\n\n2 You said that that was your second trip just now. Can you recall\n\n3 whether or not --\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. -- on the occasion that you went to Janjevo, whether it was the\n\n6 first trip or the second trip? I ask you because in the statement that\n\n7 you gave to Mr. Stankovic, at page 2 in the English version, you say: \"On\n\n8 the first occasion he ordered me to go to Janjevo and report to the local\n\n9 police.\" Was that the second or the first trip to Kosovo?\n\n10 A. In connection with the bodies or in general?\n\n11 Q. In connection with the bodies you are speaking of.\n\n12 A. The first trip.\n\n13 Q. Thank you. What I'm asking you now is when you called the number\n\n14 on the second trip that you made to Kosovo in connection with collecting\n\n15 bodies, what did he say to you on that occasion?\n\n16 A. The voice on the phone told me on the second occasion that I\n\n17 should go to Kosovska Mitrovica, to the southern part, near the cargo\n\n18 railway station, and there I would be met by the people I should contact.\n\n19 Q. You told us earlier that you carried those bodies that you\n\n20 collected there to Petrovo Selo. Who told you to take those bodies to\n\n21 Petrovo Selo? Or why did you take them to Petrovo Selo?\n\n22 A. The voice -- well, I followed orders, of course. The voice on the\n\n23 other end of the telephone line told me that I should go to Petrovo Selo,\n\n24 that I should drive there.\n\n25 Q. And on the third occasion, when you said you drove --\n\nPage 11328\n\n1 A. On the third occasion, it was the same telephone, the same\n\n2 voice --\n\n3 Q. What did that voice --\n\n4 A. -- to Batajnica.\n\n5 Q. Well, could you just tell us what the person told you.\n\n6 A. That person told me to go to the parking lot behind the Rilindija\n\n7 building, and there were trucks there. I would be met there by some men\n\n8 who would tell me which truck to take. There were four or five other\n\n9 trucks on the parking lot and that truck, the one I was told to take.\n\n10 Q. Who met you there?\n\n11 A. Policemen, local policemen or perhaps reserve police officers. I\n\n12 don't know because I hadn't seen them before that.\n\n13 Q. Can you say what rank they were, generally speaking?\n\n14 A. Those were police officers' insignia.\n\n15 Q. Do you recall the ranks of these persons, the highest rank of\n\n16 anybody you saw there?\n\n17 A. When? On which occasion?\n\n18 Q. The third occasion you went to Kosovo in connection with the\n\n19 bodies.\n\n20 A. No, no. I didn't see any senior ranks, any high ranks.\n\n21 Q. Okay. On that occasion you took the bodies to the 13th May police\n\n22 centre in Batajnica. Why did you take the bodies there?\n\n23 A. That was what I was told.\n\n24 Q. By who?\n\n25 A. The voice I had the telephone contact with.\n\nPage 11329\n\n1 Q. Okay. Now, on the second occasion you went to Kosovo and you went\n\n2 to the southern part of Kosovska Mitrovica and collected bodies, you were\n\n3 met at the place the bodies were by whom, by members of what organisation?\n\n4 A. There were several people there. In my estimate, around 15 of\n\n5 them. They were all in civilian clothes.\n\n6 Q. Did they belong to any organisation?\n\n7 A. Yes, those were chiefs of secretariats sent to Kosovo from Serbian\n\n8 municipal secretariats.\n\n9 Q. That is chiefs of secretariats of the MUP?\n\n10 A. Yes, yes. And heads of crime services of their respective\n\n11 centres.\n\n12 Q. I'd like to direct you to a couple areas of the statements that\n\n13 you gave, the statement you gave on the occasion to Prosecutor Stankovic\n\n14 and your sworn evidence to the Belgrade court last month. I'm going to\n\n15 ask you a question. You said in the statement to Mr. Stankovic:\n\n16 \"I was supposed to call a land-line\" -- and that's page 2, the\n\n17 middle paragraph.\n\n18 \"I was supposed to call a land-line telephone number 011-281-9074\n\n19 but without dialing the area code number. In all three instances when I\n\n20 dialled this number, the telephone was answered by General Sreten Lukic,\n\n21 who was one of the assistant ministers and a commander of all police\n\n22 forces in Kosovo-Metohija. I knew General Sreten Lukic personally and I\n\n23 could recognise his voice because I was his driver for six months. I\n\n24 often drove him to Kosovo-Metohija and spoke with him on the phone;\n\n25 therefore, I can state without doubt that I could recognise his voice,\n\nPage 11330\n\n1 which made it unnecessary for him to introduce himself because I knew who\n\n2 I was speaking to.\"\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: We have to object to this kind of leading questions to\n\n4 the witness, Your Honour.\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: We haven't reached the question yet, Mr. Lukic.\n\n6 MR. LUKIC: Exactly. This is the speech.\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes, but it's not immediately obvious that it can\n\n8 be objected to because all that's being referred to is evidence already\n\n9 given by the witness. So we repel that objection.\n\n10 Please continue, Mr. Stamp.\n\n11 MR. STAMP:\n\n12 Q. And when you gave testimony to the court in Belgrade, at page 19\n\n13 of the English transcript you said:\n\n14 \"Knowing that I was at the staff and he was Chief of Staff and I\n\n15 drove Obrad while in the staff, we often talked on the telephone. The\n\n16 Belgrade number I called, I am 99 per cent and even 100 per cent sure that\n\n17 I contacted Lukic.\"\n\n18 And at page 27 you said to the Belgrade court again: \"It is my\n\n19 deep conviction that says I was 99.9 per cent sure that it was the voice\n\n20 of General Lukic.\"\n\n21 But the first question is something about before but on this\n\n22 specific issue: Is the evidence you gave under oath to the Belgrade court\n\n23 and the statement you gave to Mr. Stankovic true or not true?\n\n24 A. True.\n\n25 Q. You said you were the driver of Mr. Lukic. When were you his\n\nPage 11331\n\n1 driver? What period?\n\n2 A. In 1990, or rather, from 1990, or rather, in the 1990s on and off\n\n3 because I would work for him and then have a bit of time off.\n\n4 Q. When, if you can remember, was the last period in the 1990s that\n\n5 you were his driver?\n\n6 A. I can't pin-point the exact date.\n\n7 Q. Apart from driving for him, did you have any other opportunity\n\n8 prior to -- to the circumstances when you made these three calls from\n\n9 Kosovo that we just spoke of to hear him speak?\n\n10 A. At the time, I was able to recognise all the voices I would hear\n\n11 over the telephone without the persons introducing themselves. Even now\n\n12 of course, I could do that.\n\n13 Q. Very well --\n\n14 A. Can do that.\n\n15 THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter's correction.\n\n16 MR. STAMP:\n\n17 Q. How long have you known Mr. Lukic?\n\n18 A. I have been or I had been working in the service since 1975, and\n\n19 then with the start of the 1980s as the unrest in Kosovo escalated and\n\n20 onwards.\n\n21 Q. So would you say that you -- well, let me just ask the question.\n\n22 Approximately how long - I know you can't be exact - have you known\n\n23 General Lukic?\n\n24 A. For some ten years.\n\n25 Q. Well, we are in 2007 now. Ten years would take us back to\n\nPage 11332\n\n1 1999 [sic] --\n\n2 A. But you have to count in the five years I have been retired. I\n\n3 was talking about the period up to the date of retirement. It was ten\n\n4 years up to that point.\n\n5 Q. Very well.\n\n6 Before I move on from that, you say that -- or do you know how\n\n7 many trucks with bodies were taken to Batajnica? You have told us that\n\n8 you took two loads. Do you know how many loads in all were taken there\n\n9 from Kosovo?\n\n10 A. According to the stories of how many bodies were uncovered,\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 Q. Sorry.\n\n15 MR. STAMP: Your Honour, that answer that --\n\n16 JUDGE BONOMY: It will be attended to, Mr. Stamp.\n\n17 MR. STAMP:\n\n18 Q. Just answer this question without calling any names. How many\n\n19 trucks do you know -- or how many truck-loads do you know of bodies were\n\n20 taken to Batajnica, apart from the two you took there?\n\n21 A. The truck from Zajecar which transported some 20 bodies but then\n\n22 broke down. Do you want to count that one in? And then there was the\n\n23 refrigerator truck, or are you referring to something extra?\n\n24 Q. Just how many trucks, apart from your two trips, how many\n\n25 deliveries of bodies do you know of to Batajnica?\n\nPage 11333\n\n1 A. I can tell you the persons who did the trips, but how many trips\n\n2 they did, I don't know. I can tell you who drove the trucks in addition\n\n3 to me, and then you should ask them about the number of trips made.\n\n4 Q. Very well. Who drove the trucks --\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: Let's go into private session for that, please.\n\n6 MR. STAMP: Yes, please.\n\n7 [Private session]\n\n8 (redacted)\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 (redacted)\n\n15 (redacted)\n\n16 (redacted)\n\n17 (redacted)\n\n18 (redacted)\n\n19 (redacted)\n\n20 (redacted)\n\n21 (redacted)\n\n22 (redacted)\n\n23 (redacted)\n\n24 (redacted)\n\n25 (redacted)\n\nPage 11334\n\n1 (redacted)\n\n2 (redacted)\n\n3 (redacted)\n\n4 (redacted)\n\n5 (redacted)\n\n6 (redacted)\n\n7 (redacted)\n\n8 (redacted)\n\n9 (redacted)\n\n10 (redacted)\n\n11 (redacted)\n\n12 (redacted)\n\n13 (redacted)\n\n14 --- Recess taken at 10.47 a.m.\n\n15 --- On resuming at 11.18 a.m.\n\n16 [The witness takes the stand]\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Stamp.\n\n18 MR. STAMP: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n19 Q. Mr. Protic, I'd like to turn to the circumstances in which you\n\n20 retired from the police force. After --\n\n21 JUDGE BONOMY: I think that would mean we can go back into public\n\n22 session?\n\n23 MR. STAMP: Yes, yes, I'm so sorry. We should be in public\n\n24 session.\n\n25 [Open session]\n\nPage 11335\n\n1 THE REGISTRAR: We are in open session, Your Honours.\n\n2 MR. STAMP:\n\n3 Q. You said you were in Bujanovac and a doctor from the MUP came\n\n4 there and spoke to you. Firstly, what were you doing in Bujanovac, were\n\n5 you working there or not?\n\n6 A. After my return from Kosovo, I was sent to Bujanovac, also to the\n\n7 staff in the so-called land zone.\n\n8 Q. Just where is Bujanovac?\n\n9 A. In the south of Serbia, near to Vranje near to the Macedonian\n\n10 border --\n\n11 THE INTERPRETER: Could the witness please repeat the last part of\n\n12 his answer.\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Protic, could you give that answer again. You\n\n14 said in the south of Serbia. Could you continue from there because the\n\n15 interpreter did not catch what you said.\n\n16 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] In the south of Serbia near to the\n\n17 Macedonian border and the Kosovo border; the closest town in Kosovo is\n\n18 Gnjilane.\n\n19 MR. STAMP:\n\n20 Q. You said a doctor spoke to you.\n\n21 MR. STAMP: I am referring to matters that are on page 9 of this\n\n22 interview with Mr. Dilparic.\n\n23 Q. You said a doctor spoke to you. Who is this doctor, can you\n\n24 recall his name?\n\n25 A. Can I give you his last name?\n\nPage 11336\n\n1 Q. Yes.\n\n2 A. Dr. Batnozic.\n\n3 Q. What was his position then when he spoke to you?\n\n4 A. He holds the rank of colonel and is the chief of medical corps of\n\n5 the MUP of Serbia.\n\n6 Q. Now, do you remember when he spoke to you about retirement?\n\n7 A. At the time, a multi-ethnic police force was supposed to be set up\n\n8 down there at Bujanovac composed of Albanians and Serbs. They were\n\n9 supposed to work as a unified force, and it was supposed to be\n\n10 operational. And he was down there at Bujanovac with a medical team to\n\n11 carry out regular medical check-ups in order to select the possible\n\n12 candidates for the police force. His -- he was stationed at the Bujanovac\n\n13 spa.\n\n14 Q. Yes. When, when did he speak to you about retirement?\n\n15 A. In 2001.\n\n16 Q. Well, do you remember the month in 2001 that you retired?\n\n17 A. Yes, yes, I do. I have a decision with me to that effect. I can\n\n18 show it to you and it bears the date of my retirement.\n\n19 Q. Do you remember the month that you retired?\n\n20 A. At the end of 2001.\n\n21 Q. Well, which month? Very well.\n\n22 MR. STAMP: Could the witness be allowed to look at his document?\n\n23 Q. What document do you have there that you want to look at?\n\n24 A. The decision on my retirement.\n\n25 JUDGE BONOMY: Would you give the document to the usher, please;\n\nPage 11337\n\n1 he'll show it to me.\n\n2 MR. STAMP: A copy of this document was disclosed to the Defence,\n\n3 and there's a translation here in English. The Prosecution are not really\n\n4 intending to use this document, but if he cannot remember the --\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: It seems reasonable.\n\n6 Mr. Lukic, have you any objection to this?\n\n7 MR. LUKIC: No, Your Honour, we don't.\n\n8 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n9 Can you just confirm the date of your retirement from that\n\n10 document, please. Tell us -- tell us the date.\n\n11 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] 28th of December, 2001.\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n13 Mr. Stamp.\n\n14 MR. STAMP: Thank you.\n\n15 Q. About how long before that were you -- were you approached by this\n\n16 doctor, the colonel, in Bujanovac?\n\n17 A. Since I spent the total of six months at Bujanovac when the\n\n18 refrigerator truck case started, that's to say the transportation of dead\n\n19 bodies, I followed the press and I cut out all the articles related to\n\n20 this issue. I would have the clips taken out and I set them aside.\n\n21 Q. Just give me a time-period, a time-period, about how long before\n\n22 your retirement officially did the doctor speak to you about retirement?\n\n23 A. One month, approximately one month.\n\n24 Q. And you say -- well, who approached who? Did you approach him or\n\n25 did he approach you?\n\nPage 11338\n\n1 A. He approached me, and he advised me that since I had spent a great\n\n2 deal of time in the -- working in the field that I should get retired and\n\n3 that the circumstances were propitious for that at that moment. Later on\n\n4 I realised that conditions for retirement at the time were, in fact, not\n\n5 favourable.\n\n6 Q. Very well. Now, this you say was at about the time when the issue\n\n7 of the refrigerator truck being found was in the press? Don't nod. Is\n\n8 that correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, yes.\n\n10 Q. Now, did that colonel, doctor, tell you to go anywhere or do\n\n11 anything?\n\n12 A. I don't understand the question.\n\n13 Q. What did you do next, if anything, in respect to your retirement\n\n14 after he spoke with you?\n\n15 A. He told me, when you come down for a weekend, that I should get in\n\n16 touch with him, that he had the people who do -- take care of the matter\n\n17 and that it would only take a couple of days.\n\n18 Q. And go down to where? Where was he referring to?\n\n19 A. That I should get in touch with him whenever I come to Belgrade\n\n20 for a weekend, that he would see to the matter, that they would expedite\n\n21 the procedure, and that it would all be over in a matter of days.\n\n22 Q. Well, did you do anything having -- him having told you that?\n\n23 A. Since I had spent a lot of time out afield and that I had worked a\n\n24 great deal more than any of my other colleagues in the service, I\n\n25 contemplated the idea.\n\nPage 11339\n\n1 Q. And did you act upon it?\n\n2 A. Of course I did, yes, yes.\n\n3 Q. What --\n\n4 A. I came to him.\n\n5 Q. Where?\n\n6 A. His office in the building where his headquarters was.\n\n7 Q. In which city?\n\n8 A. In Belgrade.\n\n9 Q. Now, did he direct you to do anything from there?\n\n10 A. No, he only said I should contact him and that he would do\n\n11 everything, and he did.\n\n12 Q. And what did he do?\n\n13 A. He sent me to the health centre of the MUP in Durmitorska Street\n\n14 where the headquarters are -- is, and there I addressed the doctor from\n\n15 the commission who took me to two or three offices, and it was all over in\n\n16 a day.\n\n17 Q. Were you examined medically?\n\n18 A. Well, if you think that a conversation amounts to a medical\n\n19 examination, then yes. There were no blood tests, no heart echoes or\n\n20 things like that.\n\n21 Q. Do you know on what grounds you retired?\n\n22 A. I was immediately told what my diagnosis was, yes, I can tell you\n\n23 if you're interested.\n\n24 Q. Please, go on.\n\n25 A. Allegedly I had high blood sugar, 20 units. I had arrhythmic\n\nPage 11340\n\n1 beating of the heart, and a neuropsychiatrist said that I had night sweats\n\n2 and nightmares of being persecuted in closed spaces. None of this is\n\n3 true. Then the commission was scheduled, and I was there with the workers\n\n4 from Zajecar, not the workers from Belgrade. I was among the first to be\n\n5 called. When I entered before the commission, they immediately\n\n6 congratulated me and they said, You're a pensioner as from now. And that\n\n7 was the end of it. I wasn't with the commission from Belgrade because my\n\n8 colleagues from Belgrade knew me and they would have been surprised, how\n\n9 come I was being pensioned off when I had never even been on sick leave.\n\n10 Q. Thanks. Now, can we move on quickly, Mr. Protic. Do you recall\n\n11 that you were interviewed on many occasions by a team in respect to the\n\n12 truck with bodies that was found in the Danube in respect that\n\n13 investigation in the year 2001 and that team was led by Mr. Karleusa and\n\n14 Mr. Furdulovic do you recall that? Please speak your answer.\n\n15 Do you remember that you were interviewed by Mr. Karleusa and\n\n16 Mr. Furdulovic in 2001 in respect to the matters you have testified about?\n\n17 A. Yes, I remember that, and the same Karleusa and Furdulovic later\n\n18 took me to Petrovo Selo to show them the spot where I had unloaded the\n\n19 bodies, and I did that, of course.\n\n20 Q. Were you present when that area in Petrovo Selo was exhumed, was\n\n21 dug up?\n\n22 A. I pointed to the spot where I had unloaded that, and I was present\n\n23 until they found the first body. When they assured themselves that this\n\n24 was correct, then I was free to go and I was not present any longer.\n\n25 Q. After the statement or the interviews conducted by Mr. Karleusa's\n\nPage 11341\n\n1 team, you and -- that is Exhibit P586 I think the report is there.\n\n2 MR. STAMP: We will not call it up, Your Honours. I just do that\n\n3 for the purpose of cross-reference.\n\n4 Q. You spoke with -- in the interview we spoke of earlier with Judge\n\n5 Dilparic. Now, in neither of those interviews is it recorded that you\n\n6 said that you called and spoke with Sreten Lukic when you went to Kosovo\n\n7 to collect bodies. I'd like you to tell the Court why is it on both of\n\n8 these occasions when you had the opportunity to do so, you did not mention\n\n9 that it was Sreten Lukic that you called when you went to Kosovo to\n\n10 collect the bodies.\n\n11 MR. LUKIC: Excuse me, Your Honour. I have to object to the form\n\n12 of the question because my learned friend is judging now in advance that\n\n13 this was Sreten Lukic, and we will show you that it wasn't. So rephrase\n\n14 the question and -- he should rephrase the question and put it in the\n\n15 manner the witness answered, and maybe to ask him whether it's true or not\n\n16 or -- and why it's not true.\n\n17 MR. STAMP: That type of objection is --\n\n18 JUDGE BONOMY: I -- we repel that objection, Mr. Stamp, and we'll\n\n19 allow you to ask the question. The objection is unfounded.\n\n20 MR. STAMP: One also has to, if I may say so, Your Honour, be\n\n21 sensitive to the circumstances of some witnesses and ought to be careful\n\n22 in the way objections are expressed, in that -- when I say one ought to be\n\n23 careful in the way objections are expressed --\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: I can see nothing wrong with the way in which that\n\n25 objection was expressed except that it was without any foundation.\n\nPage 11342\n\n1 MR. STAMP: Very well. I'll move on.\n\n2 Q. Why on those previous occasions when you had the opportunity to do\n\n3 so did you not mention that -- the contact, that you called with Sreten\n\n4 Lukic?\n\n5 A. First of all, if I was pensioned off in two days' time and I would\n\n6 have had to work for another five years in normal circumstances and my\n\n7 wife was employed in the ministry, as were my son and daughter, I was\n\n8 afraid that they would be dealt with in the same way I had. That's all I\n\n9 can say.\n\n10 Q. At the time when you gave those two statements I just referred to,\n\n11 what was the official position of Sreten Lukic, do you know?\n\n12 A. He was the chief of the sector and he was the assistant minister\n\n13 of public security.\n\n14 Q. You said --\n\n15 JUDGE BONOMY: Are you saying that your wife and your son and\n\n16 daughter were employed by the ministry?\n\n17 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] They still are.\n\n18 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n19 MR. STAMP:\n\n20 Q. In your interview with Judge Dilparic -- and I refer to the\n\n21 bottom -- the last few lines of page 13 in English -- maybe I should just\n\n22 correct something before I proceed with the question.\n\n23 It is written here in English: \"When I got the summons to come to\n\n24 the office of The Hague Tribunal in Jevrema Grujica Street I called the\n\n25 Chef de Cabinet Sreten Lukic as I had done when I got the summons and I\n\nPage 11343\n\n1 informed the MUP that I had received the summons and what to do. They\n\n2 took my telephone number and said they would get back to me. They never\n\n3 called me, and on every previous occasion before I received the summons,\n\n4 they would ring me and send a car for me to take me to the interview and I\n\n5 would get instructions what I was to say and how.\"\n\n6 Firstly it says here: \"I called the chef de cabinet Sreten\n\n7 Lukic ...\" Did you actually call Sreten Lukic or did you call the chef de\n\n8 cabinet of Sreten Lukic?\n\n9 A. All the conversations with Sreten Lukic are done through the chef\n\n10 de cabinet. His name was Zoran Alimpic and it was him I called on that\n\n11 occasion and I told him that I had received the summons for 1330 in the\n\n12 Palace of Justice in the war crimes --\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: You've answered the question.\n\n14 Please, Mr. Stamp.\n\n15 MR. STAMP: Thank you.\n\n16 Q. You said on previous occasions they would ring you, send a car for\n\n17 you to take you to the interview, and you'd get instructions or you'd get\n\n18 instructions what you were to say and how. And you were asked who would\n\n19 call you, and you said Karleusa. What I'd like to ask you is this: What\n\n20 do you mean when you said that you would get instructions what you were to\n\n21 say and how? Can you just explain that.\n\n22 A. The chief of Karleusa always sent a driver to pick me up and take\n\n23 me to the centre at Makis to come and give a statement or what I knew\n\n24 about the events at the time. Mr. Karleusa never told me what to say. He\n\n25 always told me that I should only tell the truth because I had no reasons\n\nPage 11344\n\n1 to conceal or withhold anything. So I said everything, both to Judge\n\n2 Dilparic and to the special court. I wasn't trying to incriminate anyone,\n\n3 I wasn't trying to invent charges against someone because I had a grudge\n\n4 or anything like that. I was simply and purely telling the truth.\n\n5 JUDGE BONOMY: Now, Mr. Stamp, we've I think reached the point\n\n6 where you've had as much time as you can have today.\n\n7 MR. STAMP: And, Your Honours, as a matter of fact, when the\n\n8 witness said: \"I was simply and purely telling the truth,\" I was just\n\n9 about to say that I had nothing further for the witness.\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\n11 Mr. Lukic, are you the only counsel with cross-examination?\n\n12 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour, I suppose so.\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: Please continue then.\n\n14 MR. LUKIC: Thank you.\n\n15 Cross-examination by Mr. Lukic:\n\n16 Q. [Interpretation] Good morning, Mr. Protic. My name is Branko\n\n17 Lukic, and I appear for General Sreten Lukic. I will have quite a few\n\n18 questions for you, and I ask you to concentrate and to give answers that\n\n19 are as precise as possible. You were asked before the court in Belgrade,\n\n20 as there seems to be a misunderstanding about your address in the\n\n21 Obalski Radnika Street?\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 Q. How did you come by that flat or apartment?\n\n24 A. I heard that the MUP had 16 vacant flats in that location intended\n\n25 for the Milicionar sports club and I moved in in order to get away from\n\nPage 11345\n\n1 Batajnica, because Batajnica holds very bad memories for me. I wanted --\n\n2 or rather, I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in Batajnica or even\n\n3 to pass through it.\n\n4 Q. But you entered that flat illegally. Is that correct?\n\n5 A. Yes, it is correct.\n\n6 Q. You asked Sreten Lukic to give you a flat when he was head of\n\n7 public security and he refused. Is that correct?\n\n8 A. Mr. Lukic offered me a vacant flat which had in it a policeman who\n\n9 was an invalid. He had been injured in Kosovo and he had three children.\n\n10 He sent me to see that flat and evict that man and move in. I would never\n\n11 have done that even if I had had to live in a tent.\n\n12 Q. But your son lives in the flat you left?\n\n13 A. Yes. That's my flat, my wife and I got 50/50 each of that flat,\n\n14 and my son remained in that flat with his wife and two children.\n\n15 Q. Today you're saying what you're saying for the very reason -- and\n\n16 you're incriminating Sreten Lukic for the very reason that he did not give\n\n17 you unlawfully a second flat; he refused to break the law. You already\n\n18 had received a flat and you asked him to do that while he was holding the\n\n19 post of chief of the public security sector. Is that correct?\n\n20 A. That's not correct. Are you reading my mind?\n\n21 Q. Well, we'll come back to that. How did it come about that you\n\n22 made a statement to the Administration for Organised Crime on the 29th of\n\n23 June, 2006?\n\n24 A. I don't understand your question. Could you repeat it.\n\n25 Q. Prosecutor Stankovic, how come you made that statement? Were you\n\nPage 11346\n\n1 summoned?\n\n2 A. Yes, I was summoned.\n\n3 Q. And?\n\n4 A. I responded to the summons.\n\n5 Q. Where did you go?\n\n6 A. To Makisa to the war crimes department where the Kostic Aleksandar\n\n7 was the chief.\n\n8 Q. You went to the MUP, not to the Prosecutor's office?\n\n9 A. Yes, yes, I was in the Prosecutor's office before that when I was\n\n10 telling the chef de cabinet Zoran Alimpic that he should tell Mr. Lukic\n\n11 that I was going there, that it had to do with the refrigerator truck case\n\n12 and that it might be a good idea for us to discuss this.\n\n13 Q. All right. Yes. I'm waiting for the interpretation to end. You\n\n14 have already told us this and you have also already told us that no one\n\n15 from Mr. Lukic's office wanted to give you any instructions as to how you\n\n16 should testify. Is that correct?\n\n17 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n18 Q. Thank you. When you were questioned in 2006 in the Prosecutor\n\n19 Stankovic's office, was Bozo Predalic there, your counsel?\n\n20 A. He's not my counsel and he was not there.\n\n21 Q. In the statement signed by Prosecutor Stankovic, it\n\n22 says: \"Republic of Serbia, Ministry of the Interior, police directorate,\n\n23 criminal investigation police administration.\" On the same document there\n\n24 are some initials DJ/AK. I would like to know who was acting in this case\n\n25 where you made the statement. Was it the police, because that's what the\n\nPage 11347\n\n1 heading would indicate, or was it the prosecutor who signed the document?\n\n2 A. I was summoned to Makisa to the criminal police administration\n\n3 where Kostic Aleksandar was the chief. He was there. There was also the\n\n4 judge you mentioned, Jankovic or Jankusic and also present was an\n\n5 operative who took notes on a computer. He took down what we were saying.\n\n6 Q. At the end of the document we see that DJ in fact refers to Dragan\n\n7 Jenic, who was the recording clerk?\n\n8 A. Yes, his nickname was Junice.\n\n9 Q. Well, then his name is in the wrong place. He should have been\n\n10 second, but according to the way these initials are ordered, it appears\n\n11 that he was supposed to lead the questioning?\n\n12 A. I have no idea about that.\n\n13 Q. So DJ and AK, Dragan Jenic and Aleksandar Kostic are employees of\n\n14 the Ministry of the Interior?\n\n15 A. That's correct.\n\n16 Q. Were questions put to you by the prosecutor or by the inspector?\n\n17 A. I was cross-examined.\n\n18 Q. So both put questions to you?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. I would now like to dwell a little on the next two paragraphs of\n\n21 your statement made to Prosecutor Stankovic of the 29th of June, 2006.\n\n22 I'm interested in the following. On the third page in English, the last\n\n23 paragraph, and the next one; and B/C/S version, second page, third and\n\n24 fourth paragraphs, you say: \"On the 5th of December, 2003, I made a\n\n25 statement to investigating Judge Dilparic where I explained my\n\nPage 11348\n\n1 participation in the transport of mortal remains from Tekija and Kosovo\n\n2 and Metohija, and now I can say that I made four trips in total and in all\n\n3 four trips, on all four occasions I drove dead bodies in a truck. I made\n\n4 the first trip during the bombing. I think it was in late April or early\n\n5 May 1999. The other trips were three to five days apart. I received\n\n6 orders for each trip from Petar Zekovic, who was at the time the head of\n\n7 the administration for joint affairs and assistant minister of the\n\n8 interior. There were always verbal orders containing instructions as to\n\n9 how and where I should pick up the truck, which truck it would be, and\n\n10 where I should go to collect the bodies.\"\n\n11 You testified about the same event in Belgrade before the judge of\n\n12 the district court and the investigating judge in Belgrade, Milan\n\n13 Dilparic, told you it was your duty to tell the truth. Is that correct?\n\n14 A. Yes, it is.\n\n15 Q. And you were also told not to withhold anything. Is that correct?\n\n16 A. Yes.\n\n17 Q. The same judge told you that it was a crime to give false\n\n18 evidence?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. You were told by the court in Belgrade that you are not duty-bound\n\n21 to answer questions if your answer would have exposed either you or your\n\n22 close relatives to severe disgrace, substantial material damage, or\n\n23 criminal prosecution. Is this correct?\n\n24 A. Yes.\n\n25 Q. The judge then asked you whether you had understood these\n\nPage 11349\n\n1 warnings. Is that correct?\n\n2 A. Yes.\n\n3 Q. And you said that you had. Is that correct?\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. Were you telling the truth?\n\n6 A. Yes, I was.\n\n7 Q. But in 2003 you were telling the truth to Judge Dilparic?\n\n8 A. Yes, I was.\n\n9 Q. That you didn't know who you spoke to in Pristina; is that\n\n10 correct?\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. All right.\n\n13 JUDGE BONOMY: Where is that reference, Mr. Lukic?\n\n14 MR. LUKIC: It's English version of the statement from 2003,\n\n15 English page 2, paragraph 3. And the paragraphs are from -- the first\n\n16 paragraphs were read from the 2006 statement. It's page 3, last\n\n17 paragraph. But the warnings given by the judge in 2003 are on page 2,\n\n18 paragraph 3.\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: I'm now lost.\n\n20 MR. LUKIC: Everybody's lost.\n\n21 JUDGE BONOMY: I didn't think you'd read anything from 2006.\n\n22 MR. LUKIC: From 2006 I read the warnings given by the judge --\n\n23 actually, I didn't read them; I go through it through questions. But you\n\n24 can find all the warnings on page 3, paragraph 3 -- page 2, paragraph 3,\n\n25 sorry.\n\nPage 11350\n\n1 JUDGE BONOMY: I thought these -- these warnings don't come from\n\n2 2003.\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: They do.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, why are we talking about 2006? That's --\n\n5 MR. LUKIC: I'm questioning him now on two paragraphs from his\n\n6 statement in 2006, paragraphs from page 3, last paragraph, and the next\n\n7 paragraph on the next page. And I will go through every sentence of these\n\n8 paragraphs, so --\n\n9 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic, if you go to line 53 -- sorry, page 53,\n\n10 line 19.\n\n11 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour.\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: \"I would now like to dwell a little on the next two\n\n13 paragraphs of your statement made to Prosecutor Stankovic of the 29th of\n\n14 June\" --\n\n15 MR. LUKIC: \"2006.\"\n\n16 JUDGE BONOMY: -- \"2006.\"\n\n17 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour.\n\n18 JUDGE BONOMY: All right. I now have that clear. What I'm not\n\n19 clear about is -- just carry on. I'll catch up eventually.\n\n20 MR. LUKIC: I hope so, Your Honour, that I will be able to show\n\n21 you what I want. But from line 10 we are on the next statement. When I\n\n22 said: \"You testified about the same event in Belgrade before the judge,\"\n\n23 it's a reference -- it's a reference to the statement from 2003.\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: Yeah.\n\n25 MR. LUKIC: In the --\n\nPage 11351\n\n1 JUDGE BONOMY: So the reference to not knowing who he was speaking\n\n2 to in Pristina is where?\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: It's in 2003, the statement to the Judge Dilparic.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: And the page?\n\n5 MR. LUKIC: Give me one second, please.\n\n6 Yes, Your Honour, it's page 13, first line. \"The contact, I did\n\n7 not know who was on the other side of the phone ...\"\n\n8 JUDGE BONOMY: Page 13 --\n\n9 MR. LUKIC: Page 13, line 1 --\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: In English?\n\n11 MR. LUKIC: In English.\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: Mine is: \"Did they wear caps ...\"\n\n13 MR. LUKIC: I was just informed that there are two translations,\n\n14 so ...\n\n15 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, can you help me with where this is --\n\n16 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour, give me --\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: -- in my copy?\n\n18 MR. LUKIC: Okay. Now it's page 8, middle of the page. Your\n\n19 Honour, it's on the page we quoted. If you can --\n\n20 JUDGE BONOMY: These are the same -- these are the same\n\n21 conversations as the witness now says were with Mr. Lukic. Is that right?\n\n22 MR. LUKIC: Correct, Your Honour.\n\n23 JUDGE BONOMY: All right. Well, why are we not getting straight\n\n24 to the point?\n\n25 MR. LUKIC: I did.\n\nPage 11352\n\n1 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, Mr. Protic, you were asked some questions\n\n2 just now about whether you told the truth at the interview -- sorry --\n\n3 MR. LUKIC: It's page 8, Your Honour.\n\n4 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes, I have it now.\n\n5 You were asked whether you gave the truth to Milan Dilparic in\n\n6 December 2003, and once you told him that you got a Belgrade number in\n\n7 Pristina, you then told him you didn't know who was at the end of the\n\n8 line, and you then said: \"I never saw these people. I didn't have any\n\n9 direct contact with them, face-to-face as they say.\" Now, you've told us\n\n10 today the person you were speaking to was Mr. Lukic. So which is the\n\n11 truthful version?\n\n12 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I told you at the outset what the\n\n13 circumstances surrounding my retirement were and that the rest of my\n\n14 family were employees of the MUP. I withheld that fact for the sake of my\n\n15 family. I did not want to expose them to possible risks or repercussions\n\n16 and so on.\n\n17 JUDGE BONOMY: That's not the answer you gave Mr. Lukic when he\n\n18 asked you. You told him that the evidence you gave to Dilparic was all\n\n19 true, and that includes the bit that says: \"I didn't know who I was\n\n20 speaking to,\" or dealing with.\n\n21 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Mr. Lukic asked me whether I had\n\n22 answered the questions the judge put to me and I said yes, I did.\n\n23 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes, but did you tell the whole truth, which you\n\n24 were obliged to tell him?\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I was afraid. I didn't tell the\n\nPage 11353\n\n1 whole truth because I was afraid for my family and I was sent to\n\n2 retirement in a summary procedure precisely for that fact.\n\n3 JUDGE BONOMY: And what was the part you did not tell him?\n\n4 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] This precise part; namely, that I\n\n5 spoke to General Lukic, who was chief of sector at the time.\n\n6 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic.\n\n7 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation]\n\n8 Q. At the time you were answering the judge's questions, did you know\n\n9 that an indictment was issued against Sreten Lukic before this Tribunal?\n\n10 A. Yes.\n\n11 Q. Were you afraid of him?\n\n12 A. First of all, the indictment wasn't issued --\n\n13 Q. You gave your statement to Dilparic in 2003, in the month of\n\n14 December. It was actually on the 5th of December, 2003. This is the very\n\n15 statement we were referring to right now.\n\n16 A. Very well.\n\n17 Q. And Sreten Lukic was indicted by the Tribunal two or three months\n\n18 before your testimony.\n\n19 A. He was still in Belgrade, and in my view his position was still\n\n20 quite powerful.\n\n21 Q. You also said that you made such statements because you were\n\n22 afraid of the possible repercussions for your family, as you had been\n\n23 retired. The statement you gave to Karleusa was in the month of June of\n\n24 2001. At the time, you did not know that you were going to be retired at\n\n25 all.\n\nPage 11354\n\n1 A. I was already retired at the time.\n\n2 Q. In the month of June of 2001?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. You told us just now that you were retired on the 28th of\n\n5 December, 2001, and you showed us the decision and you read the date out\n\n6 to us from that decision.\n\n7 A. You're right. I was still working.\n\n8 Q. You were not fearful of anything at all in June 2001?\n\n9 A. Well, I might have been. The job I was doing wasn't simple and --\n\n10 Q. Very well. We'll move on.\n\n11 You're dealing with the 2006 statement given to Stankovic. You\n\n12 said that for each of the trips you were issued an order from the\n\n13 Assistant Minister Zekovic. Is that right?\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. And you say Petar Zekovic was the chief of your administration.\n\n16 A. For joint affairs.\n\n17 Q. What was Gojko Todorovic at the time?\n\n18 A. Chief of administration.\n\n19 Q. Wait a minute. Was it Zekovic who was chief of administration or\n\n20 was it Todorovic?\n\n21 A. Zekovic was chief of administration for joint affairs.\n\n22 Q. And Gojko Todorovic?\n\n23 A. Gojko Todorovic was chief of department.\n\n24 Q. And not of the administration?\n\n25 A. No.\n\nPage 11355\n\n1 Q. Very well. Every order you received from Petar Zekovic was,\n\n2 according to your words, verbal. Is that right?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. Was someone else present at the time Zekovic was issuing you with\n\n5 orders?\n\n6 A. The first time it was Nenadic Dragic who told me what I was\n\n7 supposed to do. He told me to report to General Zekovic. On that\n\n8 occasion General Zekovic and I were alone and he told me what to do;\n\n9 however, it was Nenadic Dragic who told me to report to him, my chief of\n\n10 transport.\n\n11 Q. Page 3, last paragraph of that same statement, you say there\n\n12 that: \"Every time the order contained instructions as to how and where to\n\n13 take a truck, which truck I should take, and where I should head to\n\n14 collect the bodies.\"\n\n15 A. Correct.\n\n16 Q. Am I right, therefore, that already in Belgrade you were aware of\n\n17 the location you were to go to and what you were supposed to transport?\n\n18 A. No, because during the bombing, the staff, or rather, the head\n\n19 office of the police, would frequently change their HQ. If I -- and it\n\n20 may have happened that even if I had it --\n\n21 THE INTERPRETER: Could the witness please repeat the last part of\n\n22 his answer; it was incomprehensible.\n\n23 MR. LUKIC: Sorry, Your Honour.\n\n24 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Protic, could you give the -- give us again the\n\n25 last part of that last answer. You told us that the police would\n\nPage 11356\n\n1 frequently change their headquarters, and could you tell us the rest of\n\n2 the answer again because the interpreters did not pick it up.\n\n3 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] They would change the location of\n\n4 the headquarters due to bombing. The NATO forces were bombing Pristina.\n\n5 If they were at one location on a day, they might change that location\n\n6 twice or even thrice in a day.\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic.\n\n8 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation]\n\n9 Q. Mr. Protic, my question to you was not where the HQ was located;\n\n10 rather, you stated that every time the order contained instructions, and,\n\n11 among other things, you say that it contained instructions as to \"where I\n\n12 was to go to collect the bodies.\" This is what you told Stankovic in\n\n13 2006.\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. Every time when you spoke to Zekovic, at that time you already\n\n16 knew where you were supposed to go.\n\n17 A. No. Zekovic would tell me to go to Pristina to report to a\n\n18 certain location, but then in the meantime the location would change and I\n\n19 would have to get in touch with the HQ from where they would tell me where\n\n20 to go next.\n\n21 Q. You would report to the HQ. Would you go there physically?\n\n22 A. Yes, I'd go there physically and I would there use, or rather,\n\n23 dial the telephone number that was mentioned here. I would dial the\n\n24 number and then I would receive my instructions as to where I was supposed\n\n25 to go.\n\nPage 11357\n\n1 Q. We'll come to that telephone line later. Rather, tell us what\n\n2 that telephone number was.\n\n3 A. Can I consult my notes?\n\n4 Q. You can't. Do you know the number?\n\n5 A. Of course I don't. Why should I remember it? I have it in my\n\n6 notes and I had it on me at the time.\n\n7 Q. Did you orally testify before Judge Dilparic?\n\n8 Before our court it is not allowed for witnesses to use any\n\n9 documentation whilst testifying.\n\n10 Did you give the telephone number to Judge Dilparic and Prosecutor\n\n11 Stankovic?\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: Where does that rule come from?\n\n13 MR. LUKIC: In Serbia --\n\n14 JUDGE BONOMY: Ah --\n\n15 MR. LUKIC: -- if you testify orally, you cannot use your --\n\n16 JUDGE BONOMY: I thought you were tell him not to use his notes\n\n17 here --\n\n18 MR. LUKIC: I'm also telling him not to use his notes here right\n\n19 now -- for now.\n\n20 JUDGE BONOMY: Yes. Well, carry on for the moment.\n\n21 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation]\n\n22 Q. If you didn't know the number from memory before Judge Dilparic\n\n23 and Prosecutor Stankovic, in what way were you able to give them the\n\n24 number? Was it that Stankovic suggested to you what the number was? How\n\n25 were you able to give that telephone number in your evidence, then, if you\n\nPage 11358\n\n1 don't remember it now?\n\n2 A. I had that telephone number down on a piece of paper and I kept it\n\n3 for a long time together with my driver's licence and my documents in my\n\n4 pocket, and when Mr. Dilparic asked me that question I took that piece of\n\n5 paper out and I gave it to him. I didn't know it by heart. I don't have\n\n6 the habit of memorising such things.\n\n7 Q. Let's move on. What about Stankovic?\n\n8 A. Same there.\n\n9 Q. Further on in the statement, in the English version it's page 4,\n\n10 paragraph 1, and that's the same statement given to Stankovic, you\n\n11 state: \"When I got to Kosovo and Metohija and when I was in Pristina or\n\n12 in Kosovska Mitrovica, I would report on a fixed number.\" Is that right?\n\n13 A. Yes.\n\n14 Q. Please give me answers that are as precise as possible. When you\n\n15 arrived in Kosovo and Metohija for the first time, you called from the MUP\n\n16 HQ.\n\n17 A. Yes.\n\n18 Q. The second time you also phoned from the MUP HQ.\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. And the third time, again you called from the MUP HQ.\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. You tell us today that Zekovic told you - and this is page 30,\n\n23 line 20 - to call from the MUP HQ the telephone number he gave you. Is\n\n24 that right?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 11359\n\n1 Q. Did Zekovic know that Sreten Lukic was the head of the MUP HQ?\n\n2 A. I don't know that. They are generals. I'm just a common private,\n\n3 as it were.\n\n4 Q. Did you tell Petar Zekovic upon your return where it was that you\n\n5 called the number he gave you from? And I'm referring to the first time\n\n6 you came back from the trip. Did you tell him, I called such and such a\n\n7 number?\n\n8 A. I told him that the mission was accomplished and that was it. I\n\n9 didn't go into who I got in touch with, so on and so forth. My task was\n\n10 completed and I -- and that was the end of the story.\n\n11 Q. Let's go back to the first time you came to the MUP HQ.\n\n12 A. Do you mean going to Kosovo or the refrigerator truck to Tekija?\n\n13 Q. No, I'm interested in Janjevo. That was the first time; right?\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. You went to the HQ.\n\n16 A. Yes.\n\n17 Q. Which was the telephone that you used?\n\n18 A. The HQ was across from the street of Bozur, on the third floor.\n\n19 It was the premises of a company of sorts. I went upstairs and there were\n\n20 a couple of police officers there. It seems to me that I met a Senijevic\n\n21 and Mijatovic. As I was entering the building, I went upstairs. I\n\n22 conducted that conversation, and from there I went on further to complete\n\n23 the task.\n\n24 Q. We received supplemental information from the Prosecutor, on the\n\n25 last page of which it is stated: \"The first time he called from the\n\nPage 11360\n\n1 furniture company Novi Dom.\"\n\n2 A. Novi Dom.\n\n3 Q. \"The second time from a company in the centre of Pristina across\n\n4 from Hotel Bozur.\"\n\n5 A. Yes.\n\n6 Q. Was it Hotel Bozur the place where you called on the first or the\n\n7 second occasion?\n\n8 A. It wasn't a hotel, it was a company.\n\n9 Q. When did you call? On which occasion was that?\n\n10 A. I called from both places.\n\n11 Q. When you went to Janjevo, what was the location where you phoned\n\n12 from?\n\n13 A. I know there was a staff here and there. Where it was exactly at\n\n14 that point in time, I don't know. But I used those two locations to make\n\n15 phone calls from.\n\n16 Q. Very well. You don't know from what place --\n\n17 THE INTERPRETER: There is overlapping between question and\n\n18 answer.\n\n19 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] The third time I went to the parking\n\n20 lot and there were policemen there and vehicles and trucks and all sorts\n\n21 of things, and everything was ready to move.\n\n22 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation]\n\n23 Q. So on the third occasion you didn't call from the headquarters,\n\n24 you went there directly.\n\n25 A. Yes. It's right there. You could see a whole lot of vehicles and\n\nPage 11361\n\n1 policemen from the road.\n\n2 Q. But when I put the question to you, you said that on all three\n\n3 occasions you went to the headquarters and called from the headquarters,\n\n4 so this part of your statement is not correct.\n\n5 A. Well, no, that last bit, no. But I always reported to someone.\n\n6 On that third occasion I saw the vehicles and I saw a whole -- a crowd of\n\n7 policemen. I guess that was the location.\n\n8 Q. So on the first occasion, who permitted you to call? Who allowed\n\n9 you to use the phone?\n\n10 A. Well, I went to the first office as I entered, and nobody stopped\n\n11 me or told me not to use the phone. There was chaos there.\n\n12 Q. And you dialled from that phone without using the area code?\n\n13 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n14 Q. So was that a Belgrade number?\n\n15 A. Well, I wasn't using the area code, so probably it was a Belgrade\n\n16 number.\n\n17 Q. How many Belgrade numbers were there in the staff which moved on a\n\n18 daily basis?\n\n19 A. Well, how would I know? You have to ask the communications people\n\n20 about that, the ones who maintained communications equipment.\n\n21 Q. You don't know, in fact --\n\n22 JUDGE BONOMY: Mr. Lukic, we're going too quickly between question\n\n23 and answer at the moment.\n\n24 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour.\n\n25 JUDGE BONOMY: Thank you.\n\nPage 11362\n\n1 MR. LUKIC: [Interpretation]\n\n2 Q. Dialing, as you say, on the second phone of the Belgrade line in\n\n3 the headquarters, and the headquarters changed locations several times a\n\n4 day due to the bombing, so you dialled a number without using the area\n\n5 code for Belgrade or you could have got a number in Belgrade. Is that\n\n6 correct?\n\n7 A. It's possible. I don't know anything about telecommunications.\n\n8 Q. But you could have got any SUP in Kosovo which also had a Belgrade\n\n9 line?\n\n10 A. Well, that's possible also.\n\n11 Q. All right. Thank you. You don't recall the name of the man whose\n\n12 office you entered to use the telephone number you had noted down?\n\n13 A. There were no name tags on those offices. At that time it didn't\n\n14 matter who had what rank and who was sitting where or doing what, at least\n\n15 in my opinion.\n\n16 Q. All right. Thank you. I was clumsy in putting my question. Do\n\n17 you remember the name of your colleague, the policeman whose office you\n\n18 entered and whose telephone you used?\n\n19 A. Well, in the corridor I asked someone for a telephone and he\n\n20 said, \"You can go in there.\" I don't know who the person was.\n\n21 Q. So you did not ask specifically for a Belgrade line?\n\n22 A. No. I just said, \"I need a telephone to dial a number.\"\n\n23 Q. So if it was a Pristina line, you could have called without using\n\n24 the area code and got a Pristina number?\n\n25 A. Well, I was told it was a Belgrade line. Zekovic told me when I\n\nPage 11363\n\n1 was setting out that they had a Belgrade line. Whether it was a Pristina\n\n2 line or a line of any other town in Kosovo, I don't know.\n\n3 Q. Well, assuming that they let you use a telephone which had the\n\n4 Pristina line and not the Belgrade line, when you dialled the number you\n\n5 would have got a number in Pristina because you didn't use an area code?\n\n6 A. Well, yes. I asked for a telephone to dial a number, a Pristina\n\n7 number. I dialled that number and I got what I was looking for.\n\n8 Q. Thank you. Did the same thing happen on the second occasion?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\n10 Q. Well, the third time, you didn't call?\n\n11 A. Yes, because I could already see what was happening.\n\n12 Q. Thank you. Yesterday we received additional information,\n\n13 supplemental information, from the Prosecutor and it's also contained in\n\n14 your statement, the one of 2006 before Dragoljub Stankovic. The\n\n15 Prosecutor refers to page 4 and you say: \"General Lukic gave instructions\n\n16 to the witness to go to the parking lot of Rilindija.\" And in the case of\n\n17 the Stankovic statement -- well, we established that it's not correct that\n\n18 at the Rilindija parking lot it was General Lukic who directed you there\n\n19 and that this part of your statement, wherever it is that you mention it,\n\n20 is not correct. Is that so?\n\n21 A. Well, 12 years have elapsed. There are things I remember, things\n\n22 I don't remember, things I remember vaguely or that come back to me. So\n\n23 both possibilities are there.\n\n24 Q. Well, the problem is that you recalled it for the first time last\n\n25 year about Lukic, but let's move on.\n\nPage 11364\n\n1 You say that the first -- on the first occasion you were told only\n\n2 to report to a certain place, a certain location, and that somebody else\n\n3 would give you further instructions. That was a brief conversation. Is\n\n4 that correct on the first occasion?\n\n5 A. Not instructions. They said, \"Drive in the direction of Skopje\n\n6 and there will be a vehicle driving in front of you.\"\n\n7 Q. So that's brief. Okay. On the second occasion when you went\n\n8 towards Mitrovica you say, \"Report to Mitrovica to the railway station.\"\n\n9 Is that more or less what you were told?\n\n10 A. Yes, the cargo or freight railway station.\n\n11 Q. So again it was a brief conversation and there's no third\n\n12 conversation. You did not introduce yourself to Sreten Lukic. Is that\n\n13 right?\n\n14 A. No, I didn't.\n\n15 Q. And he did not introduce himself to you?\n\n16 A. No, he didn't.\n\n17 Q. All right. The fixed number that you say you called on two\n\n18 occasions, did you ever dial it from Kosovska Mitrovica?\n\n19 A. No. After loading, there was no need to call again because I knew\n\n20 where to go.\n\n21 Q. Well, with reference to the two paragraphs we are talking about\n\n22 you said that you received orders from Petar Zekovic to go to Kosovo and\n\n23 Metohija, and when you got there in Pristina or in Kosovska Mitrovica, you\n\n24 reported to a fixed telephone number. So what you said before Stankovic\n\n25 in 2006 is not correct. You did not call from Kosovska Mitrovica?\n\nPage 11365\n\n1 A. It's correct, I didn't. May I go on? I didn't because I had\n\n2 already received instructions in Pristina. Had there been any doubts on\n\n3 my part, had there been any changes, then I would have called from\n\n4 Mitrovica.\n\n5 Q. I'm only asking you where -- whether this part where you say that\n\n6 you called that telephone number from Mitrovica is correct or not?\n\n7 A. No, not from Pristina -- no, no, it was from Pristina --\n\n8 THE INTERPRETER: Interpreter's correction.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] -- so there was no further need for\n\n10 me to call from Mitrovica. Had I had any doubts, I would have called from\n\n11 Mitrovica.\n\n12 JUDGE BONOMY: Just again help me, Mr. Lukic.\n\n13 MR. LUKIC: Yes.\n\n14 JUDGE BONOMY: Where is that reference in the statement?\n\n15 MR. LUKIC: It's English version, page 4, paragraph 1.\n\n16 JUDGE BONOMY: Not my paragraph. This -- we're now on the\n\n17 Stankovic statement. Is that right?\n\n18 MR. LUKIC: Yes, Your Honour.\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: Not on my paragraph 1 on page 4.\n\n20 MR. LUKIC: Obviously there is a different set-up of pages, so\n\n21 give us one second.\n\n22 MR. STAMP: No, no, I didn't want to object, but I think just for\n\n23 the references, counsel should use the e-court page numbers. He's using\n\n24 the unrevised translation, I believe. The final CLSS translation, as\n\n25 indicated, was delivered to the Defence and is in e-court.\n\nPage 11366\n\n1 JUDGE BONOMY: That is the one that you should use, Mr. Lukic.\n\n2 MR. LUKIC: That's right, Your Honour, but we didn't have time.\n\n3 MR. IVETIC: We just got those.\n\n4 MR. LUKIC: We just got them. As you know, I'm really trying to\n\n5 be as precise as possible and to guide Your Honours and my learned friends\n\n6 to specific paragraphs but --\n\n7 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, I would like to see this reference.\n\n8 MR. LUKIC: Okay. Give us half a minute, please.\n\n9 [Defence counsel confer]\n\n10 JUDGE BONOMY: Well, I think I have it if it's the reference\n\n11 to: \"The next time, he told me to go to the southern part of Kosovska\n\n12 Mitrovica and gave me the name of a contact person.\"\n\n13 MR. STAMP: Not exactly.\n\n14 JUDGE BONOMY: No.\n\n15 MR. STAMP: Okay. Because I think what counsel is saying is that\n\n16 the witness said in the statement that he called from Kosovska Mitrovica.\n\n17 There are just two references to Kosovska Mitrovica in the statement, in\n\n18 this statement. That is the one just quoted by Your Honour.\n\n19 JUDGE BONOMY: And the second one is where?\n\n20 MR. STAMP: And the second one is in the middle of the same page\n\n21 where he said: \"It was Petar Zekovic who gave me orders to go to Ko"
