Knowledge is lacking regarding the use of ionizing radiation from sources other than cardiac catheterization in this cohort. Objective: This study aims to assess imaging frequency and radiation dose (excluding cardiac catheterization) to patients from a single center participating in the Norwegian HARMONIC project. Materials and methods: Between 2000 and 2020, we recruited 3,609 patients treated for congenital heart disease (age < 18 years), with 33,768 examinations categorized by modality and body region. Data were retrieved from the radiology information system. Effective doses were estimated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 conversion factors, and the analysis was stratified into six age categories: newborn; 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and late adolescence. Results: The examination distribution was as follows: 91.0% conventional radiography, 4.0% computed tomography (CT), 3.6% diagnostic fluoroscopy, 1.2% nuclear medicine, and 0.3% noncardiac intervention. In the newborn to 15 years age cat- egories, 4–12% had ≥ ten conventional radiography studies, 1–8% underwent CT, and 0.3–2.5% received nuclear medicine examinations. The median effective dose ranged from 0.008–0.02 mSv and from 0.76–3.47 mSv for thoracic conventional radiography and thoracic CT, respectively. The total effective dose burden from thoracic conventional radiography ranged between 28–65% of the dose burden from thoracic CT in various age categories (40% for all ages combined). The median effective dose for nuclear medicine lung perfusion was 0.6–0.86 mSv and for gastrointestinal fluoroscopy 0.17–0.27 mSv. Because of their low frequency, these procedures contributed less to the total effective dose than thoracic radiography. Conclusion This study shows that CT made the largest contribution to the radiation dose from imaging (excluding cardiac intervention). However, although the dose per conventional radiograph was low, the large number of examinations resulted in a substantial total effective dose. Therefore, it is important to consider the frequency of conventional radiography while calculating cumulative dose for individuals. The findings of this study will help the HARMONIC project to improve risk assessment by minimizing the uncertainty associated with cumulative dose calculations\n\nShow summary\n\nSystemic radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is arguably the most effective and least toxic anticancer treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In treatment-naïve patients with indolent NHL, the efficacy of a single injection of RIT compares with that of multiple cycles of combination chemotherapy. However, 20 years following the approval of the first CD20-targeting radioimmunoconjugates 90Y-Ibritumomab-tiuxetan (Zevalin) and 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar), the number of patients referred for RIT in western countries has dramatically decreased. Notwithstanding this, the development of RIT has continued. Therapeutic targets other than CD20 have been identified, new vector molecules have been produced allowing for faster delivery of RIT to the target, and innovative radionuclides with favorable physical characteristics such as alpha emitters have been more widely available. In this article, we reviewed the current status of RIT in NHL, with particular focus on recent clinical and preclinical developments.\n\nShow summary\n\nBackground Lead-212 (212Pb) is a promising radionuclide for targeted therapy, as it decays to α-particle emitter bismuth-212 (212Bi) via β-particle emission. This extends the problematic short half-life of 212Bi. In preparation for upcoming clinical trials with 212Pb, the feasibility of quantitative single photon-emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of 212Pb was studied, with the purpose to explore the possibility of individualised patient dosimetric estimation. Results Both acquisition parameters (combining two different energy windows and two different collimators) and iterative reconstruction parameters (varying the iterations x subsets between 10 × 1, 15 × 1, 30 × 1, 30 × 2, 30 × 3, 30 × 4, and 30 × 30) were investigated to evaluate visual quality and quantitative uncertainties based on phantom images. Calibration factors were determined using a homogeneous phantom and were stable when the total activity imaged exceeded 1 MBq for all the imaging protocols studied, but they increased sharply as the activity decayed below 1 MBq. Both a 20% window centred on 239 keV and a 40% window on 79 keV, with dual scatter windows of 5% and 20%, respectively, could be used. Visual quality at the lowest activity concentrations was improved with the High Energy collimator and the 79 keV energy window. Fractional uncertainty in the activity quantitation, including uncertainties from calibration factors and small volume effects, in spheres of 2.6 ml in the NEMA phantom was 16–21% for all protocols with the 30 × 4 filtered reconstruction except the High Energy collimator with the 239 keV energy window. Quantitative analysis was possible both with and without filters, but the visual quality of the images improved with a filter. Conclusions Only minor differences were observed between the imaging protocols which were all determined suitable for quantitative imaging of 212Pb. As uncertainties generally decreased with increasing iterative updates in the reconstruction and recovery curves did not converge with few iterations, a high number of reconstruction updates are recommended for quantitative imaging.\n\nShow summary\n\nFor patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma who fail initial anti-CD20-based immunochemotherapy or develop relapsed or refractory disease, there remains a significant unmet clinical need for new therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes and quality of life. 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan is a next-generation single-dose CD37-directed radioimmunotherapy (RIT) which was investigated in a phase 1/2a study in 74 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, including 57 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). To improve targeting of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan to tumor tissue and decrease hematologic toxicity, its administration was preceded by the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and the \"cold\" anti-CD37 antibody lilotomab. The most common adverse events (AEs) were reversible grade 3/4 neutropenia (31.6%) and thrombocytopenia (26.3%) with neutrophil and platelet count nadirs 5 to 7 weeks after RIT. The most frequent nonhematologic AE was grade 1/2 nausea (15.8%). With a single administration, the overall response rate was 61% (65% in patients with FL), including 30% complete responses. For FL with ≥2 prior therapies (n = 37), the overall response rate was 70%, including 32% complete responses. For patients with rituximab-refractory FL ≥2 prior therapies (n = 21), the overall response rate was 67%, and the complete response rate was 24%. The overall median duration of response was 13.6 months (32.0 months for patients with a complete response). 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan may provide a valuable alternative treatment approach in relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in patients with comorbidities unsuitable for more intensive approaches. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01796171."
