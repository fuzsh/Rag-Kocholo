        "text": "Sensitivity analysis\n\nThere are difficulties to separate project-driven costs and effects, as well as to predict what the results had been in “real world” in the different runs. Thus, the results of the cost-consequence analysis are presented in two ways: the within project costs and consequences (base case), and in a set of sensitivity analyses to try to adjust inputs to better reflect “real world”.\n\nFor the sensitivity analysis of Runs 2–4, the following four approaches were used:\n\nS1. The unit costs for salaries varied substantially in the different countries in Runs 2–4. In some countries, staff were paid extra to do the work as the work was done outside regular working time, while in other countries, additional staff was used, etc. Therefore, in this approach, a uniform source for staff salaries (http://www.salaryexplorer.com, see Supplementary Table 4) was used to get country-specific costs for similar staff-types. Furthermore, the registered time for the staff type “other staff” varied between countries. Therefore, in S1, this staff-type was excluded (but included in S3). In the base case, the costs for the use of licensed scales varied due to local agreements in some countries. Therefore, in S1, the costs for the scales are harmonized.\n\nS2. Similar as S1. However, since the use of staff-types varied (e.g., nurses versus physicians), in S2, it was assumed that the hourly rates for staff was the average from the health sector in each country (same source as above in S1).\n\nS3. In some countries, very detailed information was given for rent of facilities, travel costs, administrative time, “other staff” (see above), etc. In S3, it is assumed that all countries in Runs 2–4 include these detailed costs (added after GDP/capita adjustment) when data is missing from a country. Salaries are harmonized as in S1 (which may lower salary costs as compared to the base case).\n\nS4. The management of uncertainty in Run 1 is somewhat different from Runs 2–4 since it is a web application. The challenge is to put a price for the use of the application. In MOPEAD, there was a special discount for the project. We have now included two other prices for the use of the application: the first is zero (0), the second is the price without the discount.\n\nRun 1 also differs from Runs 2–4 since no face-to-face meeting takes place. Thus, the study population in Run 1 is difficult to characterize, but the number of TPs will probably be lower than in Runs 2–4. Therefore, we also test a scenario with a hypothetical change in the cut off that might double the proportion of TPs, also resulting in a halved number needed to screen.\n\nS5. In some countries and runs, there were no TPs at the full diagnostic at memory clinics (WP3): Germany in Run 1 and Sweden and the Netherlands in Run 4. These countries are “high-cost countries” as compared to Slovenia and Spain, which might impact the results and a situation with no TPs hardly represents “real world”. Thus, in S5 we tested two imputation approaches of TPs for countries reporting zero TPs: mean TPs from the other countries in Runs 1 and 4 respectively and a TP of 1 instead of zero.\n\nScreening rates\n\nRuns 1–2 exceeded the screening goal while Runs 3–4 did not reach the goal (Table 1). The proportion of positive screens varied between 35–58%. Run 1 screened the greatest number of people but had also the lowest attendance rate to the full diagnostic at memory clinics (WP3), and the lowest proportion of TPs. The NNS (number-needed-to-screen) to identify a TP varied between 6 (Run 4) to 30 (Run 1). Although the positive screen proportion in Run 1 was similar to that in Run 2, the number of attendees at WP3 was low (6% of screened), as well as the ending number of TPs in relation to the screened population (3%).\n\nTable 1\n\nALL countriesRUN 1RUN 2RUN 3RUN 4AllThe webOpen HousePrimary careDiabetes specialistNumbersCompleted screenings1,4876614352642,847Positive screen5472301911531,121Invited to WP3 (specialist)4772181881501,033Contacted for referral to WP3174214179143710Evaluated at WP3911619456402TP at WP349825847236Proportions (%)Positive screens of screened37%35%44%58%39%Invited of screened positive87%95%98%98%92%Contacted of screened positive32%93%94%93%63%WP3 of screened6%24%22%21%14%WP3 of positive screens17%70%49%37%36%TP of contacted28%38%32%33%33%TP of positive screens9%36%30%31%21%TP of evaluated54%51%62%84%59%TP of screened3%12%13%18%8%NNS/TP3088612\n\nThe country-specific results for the different runs are seen in Supplementary Tables 5–15.\n\nIn Run 1 (Supplementary Table 5), Slovenia and Spain screened the most persons. The proportion of TP of those screened varied between countries (0–30%). In Slovenia there was a gap between those who screened positive and those who were contacted. Because of expected capacity problems, there was a decision that resulted in a referral to general practitioners for further diagnostics instead of referral to the full diagnostic at memory clinics (WP3) for 70 persons who screened positive. Also, in Run 2 (Supplementary Table 6), there was great variability in the TPs of screened. The very high NNS/TP in the Netherlands depends on the fact that only 1 TP was identified. The highest attendance rate to WP3 of those who screened positive was in Run 2 (70%). In Run 3 (Supplementary Table 7), 50% of those that screened positive visited WP3, with similar figures for the different countries, except Germany. In Sweden, Slovenia, and Spain, the TP proportions were similar. The high NNS/TP in Germany is because only one TP was identified. In Run 4 (Supplementary Table 8), Slovenia and Spain had a high recruitment rate, while it was much lower in Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands. In Sweden and Germany, no TPs were identified, while the TP proportions were high in Slovenia and Spain.\n\nMethodological considerations\n\nIs early diagnosis of AD possible?\n\nOur paper implicitly assumes that it is possible to set an early AD diagnosis, which reflects a common view in AD research [16, 17]. However, concerns and doubts whether this is possible have been raised [18–20]. It is important to bear in mind this discussion about diagnostic uncertainty, particularly if early AD diagnostics expand to a great scale. Issues such as predictive values, risk for false-positive and false-negative cases must be considered [12]. New blood-based biomarkers are useful tools [17], but it is important to know that such methods only can indicate a risk of AD, and that a suspected AD diagnosis must be confirmed or rejected with more comprehensive testing (for example at the memory clinics similar to WP3).\n\nDue to logistical problems and because of various delays until ethical approval in some countries, the period for campaigning and recruitment varied between the countries. There were large differences between the countries in terms of recruitment success, attendance, pre-screening outcomes, and the numbers of identified AD persons, and thus the cost effectiveness of the different runs. If a large number of persons are screened but few persons are diagnosed with AD, the cost per identified case will be very high. Consequently, the cost effectiveness in terms of the cost per identified case with AD will be low in comparisons with a situation where the number of identified cases is high (given the assumption that the screening costs are rather similar). Due to the design of MOPEAD, it was presumed that approximately 100 persons were needed to be screened in order to reach the 33 positive cases that were planned per run and site to be evaluated at the memory clinics (WP3). However, even if more than 33 screened positive, these persons beyond these 33 could not be referred to WP3 because of the design and budget limitations of MOPEAD.\n\nThere were also variabilities in the types of staff and the time use between the runs and countries. This might reflect the different ways we work in different parts of Europe, but it might also reflect differences in the implementation of the runs in different countries, such as the use of neuropsychologists. For example, in Germany and the Netherlands, neuropsychologists or nurses were present at the doctors’ offices in Runs 3 and 4 to carry out the pre-screening procedures. Thus, the sensitivity analysis used different approaches to adjust for these probable project-driven implementation differences.\n\nSpecific Run comments\n\nIn Run 1 (the web-approach), the ability to identify TP of AD dementia or MCI due to AD of such applications is also crucial, and further studies on the cognitive tests in such applications, cut-offs, etc., are needed. Run 1 had the lowest proportion of TPs, which was expected when a general population of elderly with an interest in knowing their cognitive status is offered cognitive testing. However, the detection rate needs to be improved. The pricing per user is yet unclear. Run 1 (similar to Run 2) also needed some campaigning activities (with accompanying costs) for the recruitment. There are already several similar applications available on “the web market” and more will probably enter. Although very hypothetical and simplified, if the NNS/TP in Run 1 could be halved, the cost per TP and screened would be on the same magnitude as in Runs 3 and 4, indicating the potential of Run 1.\n\nThe cost per identified case in Run 1 was high, mainly because of the low detection rate. On the other hand, the lowest cost per screened case was in Run 1. One specific problem in Run 1 was the low attendance rate of those that screened positive (21% as compared to 37–74% in the other Runs). Run 1 has no face-to-face strategy. The main reasons for low attendance are due to the logistical problems in contacting those who screened positive in Run 1 (due to lack of contact information in line with data protection regulations) and encouraging them to enter a memory clinic. The proportion of these persons who screened positive and were lost to follow-up that would end up as TPs is of course unknown. It is also unknown how people who screened positive but were lost to follow-up experienced this situation. There are also people that did not complete Run 1 for many reasons. This was a phenomenon that occurred in all countries. Drop out reasons for Run 1 are seen in Supplementary Table 16.\n\nRun 2 (Open-House) was rather efficient in terms of memory clinic attendance (WP3) and TP identification, but also rather expensive. The high costs were driven by involvement of many staff-types (physicians, nurses, neuropsychologists) in the pre-screening stage. If primarily specially trained nurses were deployed, the costs could be lowered.\n\nSince Run 2 events predominantly took place at specialist clinics, it should be feasible to integrate the work. A direct link between the Open House and the specialist clinic would lower the costs.\n\nRun 3 (primary care) had similar levels of TP as Runs 2 and 4 and rather low costs per TP (a bit higher than Run 4). Run 3 is today the most common entrance to the diagnostic work up when someone (patients, family) has raised the question about dementia. If disease modifying treatments (DMT) enter the market, the number of patients that would seek primary care for a suspected AD-dementia or MCI due to AD would probably increase. Key issues are the working conditions and reimbursement systems in primary care [21], which vary across Europe. A system where pay-per-visit dominates, disincentives work with people with a suspected AD. Thus, it is an important policy-making issue to change the reimbursement system in primary care to make work with AD (and other time-demanding long-term chronic conditions) properly valued. Another important issue is to improve competence (diagnosis, management) in cognitive disorders in primary care.\n\nRun 4 (diabetes specialists) had the greatest proportion of cases with AD (18%), which supports the notion that Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, and it also indicates that clinics with Type 2 diabetes (endocrinology, internal medicine, primary care, etc.) might be an important source for the early detection of AD. However, although Run 4 offers an interesting way to identify people with cognitive disorders, its capacity to play an important role in terms of volumes of patients is probably limited. Run 4 experienced the greatest problems in recruiting patients to MOPEAD, particularly in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Germany. In two countries, Sweden and the Netherlands, no persons with AD were identified at memory clinics (WP3) from this run. This was due to a different population in the diabetes clinic, with the regular diabetes patients being managed by the general practitioner and primarily younger complex patients visiting the specialist hospitals. The large country differences in Run 4 also reflect the heterogeneity in how Type 2 diabetes is managed in the five countries.\n\nCut-offs\n\nBesides the logistical challenges, the most effective cut-off for screened positive needs to be determined. There was a gradient in the proportion of positive screens with the algorithm, 35–58%, with the lowest in Run 2 and the highest in Run 4. This is as expected because of the profile of those who participated in the different runs. However, the proportion of TPs of those screened was low, average 8%, and 21% of positive screens, indicating that the cut-offs in the algorithm did not work optimally. However, this experience also illustrates the explorative nature of MOPEAD in identifying early cases of AD. The risk of being an early unidentified case of early AD is probably higher in the MOPEAD Runs than in a general population, but the way to identify these persons was one of the challenges in MOPEAD. For example, if a person experienced a subjective memory problem, was worried about this and had a high Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia risk score [9, 22], but scored 30 on the cognitive screening test MMSE, this resulted in a positive screen. The Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia risk score [9, 22] indicates a risk for future dementia, but not necessarily for the current moment. Therefore, while the cut-offs for this pre-screening strategy might be useful to identify at-risk subjects, the probability to detect a TP in the diagnostic evaluation is presumably decreased. In any screening program, there are trade-offs in the setting of cut-offs for a positive screen. Too “generous” to avoid false negatives will put a burden for follow-ups, too “restrictive” will result in more false negative (missed TPs) cases. In MOPEAD, the screening cut-offs may have been set too low, resulting in a high proportion of false positive cases. There is no easy solution in this area. MOPEAD is a pioneering explorative project in that sense and has provided data to inform these discussions.\n\nAttitudes\n\nAnother observation is that the proportion of those who screened positive and attended WP3 was rather low, 36% on average. There is support in publications that people wish to know whether they have dementia or not [23, 24]. Our data do not entirely support this view (even after taken the logistic problems into consideration). There may be many reasons for that. In Runs 3 and 4, consecutive patients were offered participation in MOPEAD. The visit for most of these patients was not because of memory problems or fear for AD/dementia, and these persons were thus probably less interested in further diagnostic work ups. Consecutive patients who visited the clinics in Runs 3 and 4 and potentially were eligible had more comorbidities and they were also more often less healthy than those in Runs 1 and 2. Their interest was more focused on the reason why they visited the clinic rather than early AD diagnostics. In Run 1 (with the lowest participation at WP3, 21%), it is hard to know why people participated or not. Given that it was easy to take an online cognitive test, it is possible that many participated out of curiosity with less commitment to the underlying project. In addition, trust in online applications might be lower, especially in older people. In Run 2, however, the attendance at WP3 was rather high, 70%, probably because of the direct link between the Open-House initiative and WP3 for further diagnostics. Another reason for the high attendance rate from Run 2 is probably that those who visited the Open House had concerns about their memory. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that if a person gets a confirmed diagnosis of AD/dementia, it may have negative consequences in terms of insurance, driving, weapon and profession licenses, stigmatization, etc. This may also influence the willingness to undergo a further diagnostic work up at WP3.\n\nAnother reason for the rather low attendance at WP3 might be the fact that we so far have no DMT for AD on the market. If that would be the case, with hope for efficient treatment, the attendance rate at WP might be higher.\n\nResources\n\nAnother critical issue is the capacity of specialist clinics. Although the focus in MOPEAD is on the runs, it is obvious that there will be an increase in the need of specialist diagnostic work ups if a DMT enters the market. Even today, with the traditional way of referrals (as from Runs 3 and 4) there are waiting lists and the capacity in imaging and CSF analyses is limited. It must be discussed how to handle people that screen positive particularly in Run 1, but also Run 2. The numbers of people with a suspected AD that might come from pathways like Run 1 and 2 are unknown, so the discussions about cut-offs and logistics is not just a technical discussion.\n\n“Real world”\n\nBased on the explorative approach in MOPEAD and the results of the cost-consequence analysis, combined with the methodological and logistic issues, it is not easy to state which run would fit best in the “real world”, particularly in a situation where a DMT would be present [12].\n\nDue to the design of MOPEAD, it was somewhat difficult to differ between resource use and costs that would reflect a “real world” application of the Runs and project-driven results. In the sensitivity analyses we tried to better reflect the “real world”. We regard Sensitivity 3 as “the best guess” and the option that best reflects a “real world” situation, since here more side costs and overhead costs for Runs 2–4 are included. Even with this option, the results are similar to the base case. However, more implementation studies are needed to make the process of early detection more effective."
