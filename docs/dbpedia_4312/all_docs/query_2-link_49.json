        "text": "You and us - we make dreams come true at festival grounds all over Europe. This is only possible in a world that gives us the freedom we need. A world in which you can love who you love and be who you are. Keeping this world is worth everything it takes. We, the festivals in Europe, try our best to keep up with you, and provide spaces where everybody can be free and enjoy each other as well as music, theatre, dance, and arts in all their variety. We embrace your diversity, push for equality and live cultural exchange. Time and again, you show us that it is possible to peacefully create greatness and make a difference together. Thank you for your commitment and for celebrating your freedom and values at our festivals. Thank you for joining in the fight for a better world and standing up for what you believe in. We want to encourage everyone to VOTE in the European Elections. We would not have freedom of speech, human rights, a free press, the Paris agreement and so many other achievements if it wasn’t for VOTING. YOUR VOTE counts just as much in the election as your voice does in a festival crowd singing your favourite song. Just use it and you will make a difference. You have the power to shape the future you want. A future in which we continue to celebrate at festivals, support each other when necessary and stand together in solidarity. You have the right to VOTE. Please use it. We do, too. THANK YOU! https://lnkd.in/eRzs5C5N This #WeVoteForEurope campaign is an initiative of YOUROPE (the European Festival Association) for the European Parliament Elections (6-9 June 2024) in cooperation with EFA–European Festivals Association"
