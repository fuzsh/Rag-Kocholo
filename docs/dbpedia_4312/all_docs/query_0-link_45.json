        "text": "The demolition of mass housing estates in Western countries initiated several questions regarding the heritage of Modern architecture, and how a global phenomenon failed in some countries. Regardless of their architectural values or even the fact that they are protected as cultural monuments, housing settlements in Great Britain, France etc. are under constant threat of being demolished, and a great many of them meet their fate as stigmatized places of poverty and crime. At the same time, similar architectural and urban achievements of the 1960s and 1970s in other countries have been recognized for their value and are treated as historic sites. New Belgrade was chosen as a case study for this article as an example of a more successfully realized concept. In this article we will try to determine whether New Belgrade was truly a successful concept, and if so, which factors influenced its positive development.\n\n\"Winner of the Croatian Architects' Association's 2012 Neven Šegvić Award in the category of architectural publication, criticism, and theory. Unfinished Modernisations is a collaborative, long-term research platform on architecture and urban planning. It brought together partners from both institutional and non-institutional sectors from South-Eastern Europe: Museum of Architecture and Design, Ljubljana (Slovenia), Maribor Art Gallery (Slovenia), the Croatian Architects’ Association (project coordinator) and Oris House of Architecture, Zagreb (Croatia), the Belgrade Architects Society, Belgrade (Serbia) and the Coalition for Sustainable Development, Skopje (Macedonia). The project was aimed at fostering interdisciplinary research on the production of built environment in its social, political and cultural contexts. It encompassed the countries that succeeded former Yugoslavia, spanning the period from the inception of the socialist state until today. The topic of the researches was the way in which divergent concepts of modernization conditioned architecture, territorial transformations, and urban phenomena in socialist Yugoslavia and its successor states. Special attention is paid to critical re-reading of modernization processes and contextualization of local architectural and urban planning concepts within the framework of international evolution of architectural discourse. Unfinished Modernisations were carried out through a variety of activities: researches, 5 conferences (Zagreb, Skopje, Beograd, Split, Ljubljana), exhibitions, publications, and web-site/blog www.unfinishedmodernisations.net. The keynote speakers at the conferences included David Harvey, Vedran Mimica, Hilde Heynen, Ljiljana Blagojević, Tom Avermaete, Dietmar Steiner, Hans Ibelings, and many others. All these efforts culminated in the final exhibition in Maribor (Slovenia), the 2012 Cultural Capital of Europe. The exhibition was also shown in Belgrade (Serbia), Zadar (Croatia), and Ljubljana (Slovenia), and will travel to various international destinations.\"\n\nIn the final decade of Yugoslavia, characterized by social change, economic and political crisis, new spaces of art helped shape the art discourse of the period. Due to the economic situation and social changes, artists sought alternative ways of working under new conditions and making contact with their audience as well as with potential buyers. They gathered around various spaces that became catalysts of new artistic and social phenomena and nodes of cultural and political activities. Artists and curators collaborated on the local, republican level as well as on the federal level. International connections intensified and study trips abroad became more frequent. At the same time, relations between the center and the periphery grew looser. In addition to established institutions, new art spaces and institutions influenced the art discourse. New themes and approaches in artistic production, previously considered marginal, took center stage. The article \"New Spaces, New Images. The Eighties through the Prism of Events, Exhibitions and Discourses\" gives an insight into the vivacious 1980s art scene in Slovenia, through the crosssection of the major exhibitions, events, and art spaces of the time.\n\n\"Architectural heritage of Yugoslav-socialist character: ideology, memory and identity\" studies the ability of architecture to represent political and cultural endeavors and developments in the period from 1945 until 1990 in territories which formed the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. The thesis is divided into two parts: the first part analyzes how architecture, as a discourse per se and an ideological apparatus, was used for representation of Yugoslav socialist identity. The second part studies how the deconstruction of given identity, and its consequent dismissal in the process of re-construction of national identities has influenced the level of preservation of heritage of representative character found in territories which previously formed the SFRY. The hypothesis upon which the research is built, stating that the architectural significance of heritage of representative nature built in the socialist period and found in Yugoslav successor countries is dependent on (the assessment of) its cultural, social and historical character, has emerged from the perception of the second part of the problem. However, the larger part of the thesis is devoted to the study of how circumstances in SFRY influenced the character of following three categories of buildings and spaces: I) Governmental buildings and buildings of the League of Communist of Yugoslavia II) Institutions of educational-ideological character and memorial centers III) Memorials and memorial sites. With an objective to analyze how political and social occurrences in the SFRY in the period 1945-1990 influenced the processes of construction of above-listed representative buildings and spaces, the study approaches several important moments in development of architectural discourse in socialist Yugoslavia, such as: the appearance of modernist architecture in the Interwar period; the discussion on the socialist realist style; the influence of the political conflict between Tito and Stalin on architectural developments; architectural developments during the \"Informbiro Period\"; initiation of grandiose projects of representative character in the period 1956-1965; an impulse in erection of buildings and spaces of educational-ideological and cultural-memorial character in between 1966 and 1974; the appearance of the postmodernism; and finally the course of architectural developments after Josip Broz Tito's death in 1981 till the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1990. The second part of the thesis researches how and why architectural works of representative character built in between 1945 and 1990 are neglected in the present. The objective of a critical and hermeneutical study is to perceive how the process of re-construction of national, cultural identities in the states reconstructed after the dissolution of Yugoslavia has influenced on the negative perception of the given architecture. The architectural works presented in the first chapter now are perceived as architectural heritage and analyzed as a cultural legacy of the uncomfortable nature. The discomfort towards the heritage built in the socialist period is approached through the study of the process of (re)interpretation of cultural memory. The analysis is conducted with the objective to perceive how the transformation in \"collective frameworks of memory\" has influenced \"collective memory\" of those societies and consequently the condition of architectural heritage of representative character found in the given territories. The research comes to an end with an insight into the level of preservation and state of condition of the representative heritage of Yugoslav-socialist character and concludes with recommendations for the improvement of protection mechanisms and suggestions on the modalities for its architectural and cultural revitalization."
