Yugoslavia defended always the principles on which reposes the Organisation of the United Nations.

A case which otherwise would not be worth mentioning, had not some reactionary elements used his funeral as a platform for fanning chauvinism and inciting against the people's aut.?=ity and the newYugoslavia. In order to make this clearer to us we mustbe acquainted with the truth about Milan Mirkovic, Before the war he was well known.nrhis misbehaviour as a son of a rich man, and during the Ustashi government, while thousands of innocent men were beheaded, he came to Belgrade without any troubles, whore he received from Lbs hands of Nedic's supporters and the Germans the drugstore of the family Trojkovic, which was killed by the Germans in a ruthless manner. In this way he earned during the war as much as before, After the liberation he continued with speculations and hostile work contacting with one of the moot cunning Chetnik organisers Branko Lazio, who then - in 1946 - was hiding in the woods. Mirkovic aided him and sent him various messages and information. That is why he was brought' before the court and sentenced to ten years of innriso=ent. Later on he was set free and got a situation as a druggist at Sanski Mosto To such a man with an obscure past the Banja Luka priests have organised a funeral, and 6.?very unusual one ' witheoverall aid and participation of the remnants of the Great Serbian circles. TweiVe priests headed by the Bishop Vasilj Kostic took part in the funeral, They abused the custom that speakers are listened to at funerals and over the grave of this traitor propagated against socialist Yugoslavia, -Bishop. Vaailj Kostic,-well known from previous times asa chauvinist and reactionary, made use of this o'Tortunity to show his devotion to that to which he was most devoted in the course of the ?last war, -organtsng Jhetnik bands and blessing them for all crimes which they have committed. Priest Djordje Vranjesevic and attorney Ljubo Popovic held \"funeral orations\" ? in which in -a skilful manner. and Th a priest's manner extolled to the skies this Chetnik, fanning ?chauvinism and slyly blaspheming the victims and shed blood of the people in the fight against the occupier and his servants. The teacher Milenko Koprivnica, collaborator of Draza Mihajlovic, immediately after the priest's speech said:. \"This is the best priest that we have both as a Serbian and as a great Orthodox\". Priest Vranjesevic spoke as to incite chauvinists to pour still more poison of chauvinism and to encourage them in this,. Addressing the audience attorney Ljubo Popovic also spoke about Mirkovic only in superlative stressing that this is an irremediable loss for all of them. And who are \"they\"? Whom'. did he think of? This also is absolutely clear, He thinks about the remnants of the Great Serbian bonrgeoisie which is deprived of power and about this' handful of miserable city politicians who make use of every suitable moment for creating confusion and trickeries and for spreading false information and hostile slogans.

Both questions are mainly of technical character. However the greatest attention is attracted by the third item: the Yugoslav proposal on revision of the rule of procedure of the Danube Commission and the statute on organising the secretariat' and bodies of the Commission. It is expected that the discussion on this question will begin en Friday or Saturday. At the first meeting of the Commission on Monday, the majority without any discussion adopted to consider the Yugoslav proposal. For the time being, the discussion could be condcted only about the Yugoslav draft rule of procedure of the Danul.e Commission because it not yet be seen that some other draft exists Never- theless, the possibility is not excluded that the majority will submit its draft rule of procedure. The session of the Commission unfolds very slowly, especially since the question of co-ordination of hydro-meteorological services on the Danube is being 'considered. After the report of the secretariat.about this question at yesterday's meeting of the Commission, a special working group has been convened, whose two pevious sessions were characterized by detailed reports of experts of the majority.. Last night's meeting of the working group lasted throe hours, and today it lasted the whole morning. Another meeting has been convened for the afternoon. .A lively contact between the delegation of the Soviet majority, whose chiefs are often together has been noticed at this session. In case that the Soviet majority in the Danube Commission does not appear with its draft rule of procedure, it is expected that some other way will be chosen for the fight against the Yugoslav demand. The Soviet majority may outvote that this question should be adjourned for the next session or, probably for some extraordinary session.

Dr. Bebler complied with this request and ex7.1ained at the beginning the most important successes obatined so far by the United Nations and concerning the future oft-this organisation in the struggle for peace. - The greatest present success of the United Mations. - Dr. 3ab1er Said - is no doubt the stopping of aggression in Korea, Dr. Beb1r. reminded in a few sentences how the League of Nations acted on similar occasions - during the Japanese Eo7gression in Chine, the German.italian intervention in Spain; Italian aggression in Ethiopia and in Albania and explained 1.whe.- tnueoetoleuen'es of such a weak policy by the League?of Nat ons were, Only whe1 ! one has this in mind2one1oir4e of what importance was the United Nations, decisive attitude in regard to aggression in Korea, -- It is also of great importance - continued Dr. Bebler - that the United Nations took-up such a. positive attitude in regard to Yu- goslavia. In 1948/49 we found ourselves in the same position as Czechoslovakia. in 1938 or at least in a similar .position. While the then major protagonists of the League of Nations lent a hand to aggressive Germany and executed the ?division of Czechoslovakia, the United latiots , on the other hand, gave, us moral support and oven elected Yugoslavia to the Security Council;- -And in this case. also, the United Nations acted rightly and helped to save j1-1J?inp.y- dependence of a country over whom a great power is exerting pressure. - In one word - Dr, Bebler underlined -. the most important successes of the 'United Nation's are-ttieja-successes.in offering resistance to aggressive tendencies of individual states, In this way, the United Nations have no doubt contributed to the safeguard of Peace. As the United Nations have chosen their road and have remained consistent in the respect of the principles that violence cannot be employed in relations between states, then they can have a great future as an organiser of good neighbourly- relations between all nations. - The interview with Dr. BebIer coincided with ? the second anniver- sary of the breaking out of the Korean conflict. Taking advantage of this pircuzaatance Politika's correspondent requested Dr. Bebler .to say something concerning the situation in Korea, - Prospects for a early conclusion of an armistice- seem to me extremely remote - Dr, k3ebler replied.- but a new breaking out of hostilities on land, seem - at least to me as improbable. In other words, the blind alley in negotiations can go on for quite a while, and yet one day a way out will have to be found. As I have said already once, I? think that an agreement concerning the main conflicting question could be discovered, ifas a basis were taken two generally recognised _principles of International Law; the principlee of returning war -prisoners, namely the duty of the conflicting parties to repatriate prisoners after the conclusion of peace, and the principletht every ?man, bpth civilian and military, has the right to demand asylum, as well as the right of every state to accept such a request (not duty but thohbight). Dr.Bebler referred for a while to two years ago and recalled that in autumnof 1950, at the session of the General Assembly, the Yugo- slav Rinister of .Foreign ? Affairs, Edvard Kardelj, proposed in the name of Yugoslavia a cease fire on the 38th-parollel, which was also proposed previously by the Security Council, and that the Soviet Union only a year later agreed td_tit.;_b7.1t. only in principle..

As it is known, the Hungarian Charge d'Affaires refused the day before yesterday to pay a call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although he had previously accepted the invitation. In the same way, he ordered officials of the Hungarian Legation to refuse to receive the Yugoslav Note which was on 25th June sent three times during the afternoon by e courier to the Hungarian Legation, It was pointed out to the Hungarian Charge d'Affaires that such imper- missible acts in diplomatic practice can have only unfavourable consequences and that the Ministry expects that the Hungarian Charge d'Affaires will undertake all measures in order to prevent in future such behaviour of officials of the Hungarian Legation towards the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (Tanjug) (POLITIKA - 27th June, 1952).

On this occasion the allocation of the seccn art of the loan which the International Bank will give to Yugoslavia will be dis- cussed. The first part of the loan was aoproved at the beginning of October 1951 when 28 million dollars were allocated to Yugoslavia. In the past 8 months our country has concluded an agreement with different countries out of which Yugoslavia will buy equipment for key objectives on the basis of this loan. Our country will buy in the USA installations to the value of 4,814.4,000 dollars, from Western Germany for 5,316,000.dollars, from France for more than 104509W00-dbilars. Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark and Holland come after the above-mentioned countries in regard to value of goods to be bought from the first pert of the loan. The amount of the second part of the loan which we will get from the International Bank for balancing our payments balance is not yet known. In order to obtain its balance by 1955, it is desirable - that the International Bank should allocate in good time asogreatoas loan as possible because our country in the whole programme of the construction of key objectives still needs equipment for about 80 million dollars. Therefore from the volume of financing the building of this remaining part depends also the balance of our balance payments and in this way the further Pronomic strengthening of Yugoslavia.

Judging by every- thing, this rearming is the last thing Moscow wished to achieve when it prepared the invasion of South Korea. But this is not also the last situation which Soviet diplomacy has wrongly appraised. Although far the last few months Moscow has been endeavouring to focus international pelitical-activity on the questions of Europe, in the first place on the question of Germany, it has not been relaxing in any way its underground game in Asia, particularly in the Far East, The efforts made by the USSR to draw China into a- war of exhaustion with the West are very striking. Finally, the new and increasing role of Japan. as well as Peking's Asiatic policy under present conditions are confronting Moscow with a series of problems By trying to maintain- and expand its influence and authority, Moscow is inevitably coming into conflict with those political currents in. Asia which seok independence and full equality in the settling of their own and.general questions. Two years ago Moscow showed in Koren that it is ignoring the demands and rights of Asia. The ruthlessness of Moscow is too great that Asia can forget it--the peoples of Asia have less end less confidence in the policy of Moscow. The UN, which is fighting in Korea, was given a rare chance two years ago to win--both as protector of the independence and freedom of nations and as defender against?aggression-wboth the general sympathies and confidence in Korea. and in many other parts of Asia. During the past year, at :the time of the famous Korean talks, a golden opportunity to achieve this was missed,. The Korean crisis has now entered upon a . phase in which no-one is gaining anything. The task of the UN, which two years ago was to stop aggression and throw back the enemy, has now become much more complicated because it demands that mutual distrust be removed and friendship re-established. /s/ B.

They all aereed that clergymen who were compromised should leave zone A before annexation, while as to the others, they should stay and assist the emigratien in their struggle against the FPRY by sending reports and, undersining the people's authority.

Detailed reports on all their activity can be found in our previous published articles on the same subject. On the basis of all this one can realize what the moral aspect of these people is like. The life and activity of seme of the defendants ever since 1949 until their arrest only represented a series of crimes committed against their own people, their freedom and ind.cpendence One o? the most flagrant types of criminals was that of Ivan Tilao. He knew perfectly well how to adjust himself to any kina of authority. At the time when the Germans, or the Italians or the Americans were there ha succeeded in fitting -!tde behaviour to their wiehes, but failed to adjust himself to the peoples allthority. A while befo:se the amaexation being aware of his guilt,. he intended to escape abroad bt.t later on decided that he could also hide at Log near Mangart and thus cot/i.e with his activity. According to confessions made by other afendants, he was the main speaker at those meetings of deacons he was also the ocI;tal when after the ar,tenda was exhausted they begin to L9,13 joes. \"Te then ridiculed his female parishioners who came to him to confess making dirty jokes at their expense.. In the coarse of his inter:oogation, Kobal made several quite interest-, ing confessions: \"When Mocnik was expelled lho arpointment of ails .her Apostolic Administrate had to be made. We ell agieed on th,--A that no other choice can be made except to appoint ET, oy..os in his place knowing that he had some definite links with the ae.thority. Their object was to Intimidate the clergymen who e ,;(1Thority0 Yoal himself confessed this on two occasions and later on twice denied everything,, Finally he was compelled to admit the facts by the forcc. of arguments and evidence. He also confessed the following: \"If I-:!,,et that my confessionswelld not to be made public but retained in the archive only, then I could confess everything\". \"Otherwie, 1 would be very much compromised\". He further added: 401 am concerned with the reputation of the church, as well as with messages from gentle,rien on the other side of the border\". Ljubo Marc made similar statemouts FqTow I am going to be exposed as a hypocritDand a person without match character, because in my sermons I had always deliberately concealed my lea actiy against the authority% But when it was necessary they all failed to take ].r.to consideration the reputation of the church Or their own. Thus another group of traitors and spies has received a rust punishment for its activity charged with crimin.sa aotivity Vrected against the interests of tae people,and deep moral eontamtnation and hypocrisy 0 All those who are more concerned with airectivesand the interests of the reactionary clergy inspired by the policy of the Vatican than with those of their own people, will suffer the same fate. In addition to this, as soon as the activity of the clergy from Tolmin was exposed, it could_ not be helped to examine it apart from the behaviour of the Dean Vodopivec from Tolmtn0 Evidence collected at this trial is sufficient as a justification of the pronouncement of death sentence on this flagrant criminal and traitor, But we urdcmrtand ara approve the attitude assumed by the people's authority considering that this 80 year old, man morally corrupt, aWeot:gh being a crivinal and traitor, should not be brought up for trial. As to the leaders of the Catholic Church, they should have the least sense of tact andnot leave VothTivec in the same place where he had committea all those crimes, In this way they offend the feelings of members of families of those who loot their lives because of him, (SLOYE7SKI POROCEVAB7,0, June 25) 1952) Correction: In the paper \"Slovenski Porocevalec\" of June 26, 19525 the follow- ing correction was madet instead of expressing approval of the appointment of Dr. Tores, the text translated on this page, lines 27-3(6 Wnould read as follows - \"We all agreed that Dr. Toros could not be appointed\", Approved For Release 2002/08/15: CIA-RDP83-00415R012300110009-3 - iniiiii11111111111111111111.101MINIIM pi!!

Our public is acquainted with the basic principles of this law and its importance to aocialist democracy c However, although this law contains a set of principles and presents, as comrade Kardelj says, a sort of a ? charter on selggovernment of the people in local units, in essence it is only a law, It is not a program or manifesto, although its principles bear the character of a program on organization and developmant of the people's selfg,overnment in municipality, city and district. As any other law, tne Law on People's Committees has been passed in order to be rut into effect, Basically, the true value of a law depends to which extent it can be realized In practice. This does not mean that the law covers all possible solu- tions, nor does it mean that no now problems win arise in practice, or that all its items are perfect. It is sure that the value of this law will depend on the congruebee of the basic principles of organi- zation and wcrk provido6. for by this law with the organization and functioning of the people's committee in practice, Congruence of legal norms with reality is not only a criterion with respect to realization of the law but also in regard to actual effect of the law in the matter of material and cultural development of ova- municipalities, cities and districts as well as strengthening of institutions of the people's selfgovernment within same. The problem of putting this law into effect is more complicated than the problem of realizing basic federal laws. While the realiza- tion of these laws, as a rule, is reduced to application of the law or to taking of organizational, personal, material, legal measures and procedures for the purpose of putting into effect legal norms, the new law pertaining to people's committees, along with ito appli- cation, includes also problems of further legal realization of its principles. I shall dwell on both problems in this article. I must stress, however, that the application of the new law pertaining to people's committees differs somewhat from the application of state laws or federal laws not falling under the category of general laws. Problems to be treated and particularly solutions to be given in connection therewith are necessarily of a limited and conditional character. This is due to the fact that state laws pertaining to people's committees, as well as other laws, will fully relleal all problems with respect to application, because they will extend the system of legal norms. Considering the fact, however, that the basic principles of the federal law must be realized by state laws, this pointing to problems of applying the federal law pertaining to people's committees is not merely of a geberal character. Finally, another mention has to be made. Until state laws per- taining to people's committees are passed, the T)rinciples of the new federal law will not all be realized. They will be realized only when the new people's committees are elected on the basis of new state laws. This, however, should not prevent Us from considering all the more important problems with respect to application of the federal law. The more so, the elections for the new people's committees will most probably be held in the course of this year. Besides; a series of basic principles of the federal law on people's committees are already being applied on the basis of state laws pertaining to orga- nization of people's committees issued in April 1952.

Approved For Release 2002/08/15 : CIA-RDP83-00415R012300110009-3 - 27 - THE MARKET AND TRADE Retail trade in the period January-May of this year amounted to 121,044 million dinars, which represents about 40% of the provided for 'annualretail trade. From this amount about 25% consists of trade in foodstuffs, and 75% of industrial goods. According to months the retail trade in this 2eriod was as follows: in January 20,115 million dinars (index 100), in February 22,540 million dinars (index 112), in March 25,414 million dinars (index 126), in April 28,000 million dinars (index 139) and in May 24,125 million dinars (index 124). The prominently weaker treacle in January and February and the increase in trade in the other three months (particularly March and April) is explained by the fact that the consumers spent at the end of last year to a great extent their hu :.:in means, on account of which they somewhat restrained themselves in January and February from buying - while the increase of trade in the remaining 3 months represents the stabilisation of the situation in te consumers' demand and is partly also the result of the spring season. Such an achievement in trade for the past period (40% of the annual planned trade) points out to P somewhat changed situation in regard to last year, when for the same )eriod of time a much smaller portion of the total annual trade was achieved - and this means that in this year one should not expect that the trade in the lest ounrter of the year will be -reater to that extent from the trade of the orevious quarters as WPS the cPsc last year. The reason for the uniformity of trade according to quotas in this year lies in the fact that in the forthcoming quarter there will be most probably no stagnation in trade - which is otherwise normal for this period of the year - because the sale of goods byway of cansumer credits and credits for the purchase of fuel, as well PS the decrease of prices of industrial goods which are not in demand, for welch the state has allocated subsidies to the trade network (a total of about 5 billion dinars) and the abolition of purchase coupons - will influence to a great extent the revival of trade in the next few months, rovetheilt of Stocks The stock of goods in the retail network has increased during the first quarter of the year (for April and May we have not full data) by about 60% in regard to the stocks at the beginning of the year, This represents about by 13% greeter stocks of goods from those who have been provided for by the credit balance as standard ones, Although there is no data concerning stocks for April and May one should not expect their further increase in these months, because the trado in these months was much greater, The increase in stocks, in spite of the increased trade in tne past 3 months,is due to several reasons. The forming of a larger number of new enterprises which had to supplement the asaortment of their stocks, the buying of new quality goods from this year's production and the stoppage in the sale of goods, both in previous periods, the increased delivery by the industry in March and April because of the stoppage at the beginning of the yePr,when many problems have not as yet been cleared.up in connection with the formation of prices in industry, the hope of the consumers to purchase the more expensive articles by moans of credit and on account of that the stoppage in the sale of such articles, which, however, the network had ?to buy in good time in order to secure the quantity which it needs for sale on credit and similar - led up to the transitory increase Of stocks in retail trade. The present stocks in the trade' network in retail trade are greater therefore than those which as necessary have been provided for for a normal flow of trade in this year. The forming of such stocks resulted also from the low rata ,Ortinterest, which the enterprises paid for borrowed credits and because of that they did not take sufficient care concerning stocks.

It can be expected that an increase in the rate of interest, namely restriction of financial possibilities, will lead up to a further decrease of stocks in wholesale trade and that in this way the whOlesale trade will come down to the level which is economically justified and necessary under these new con- ditions. Movement of prices In the period January-May of this year the level of prices and their variation are shown by the following indices: I II iiiIV V Total Index (1938:100) 1098 1112- 1125. 1127. 1130- 11-- 100 101,3 102A 102,6 103,0 Industrial articles 1718 1750- 1771. 1788. 1787.

Circulation of moneyand coupons The circulation of ready cash has increased since the beginning of the year until 31st May by 1,096 million dinars, which does.not represent some disturbance of the goods - monetary balance, because at the end of last year by the sale of goods at lower prices the withdrawal of large sums of ready cash took lace and the present increased circulation means only stabilisation of the situation in this regard, the more so because the soeed of circulation of ready cash hts increased to a great extent. Towerds the end of May 39,675 million dinars were in circulation. The circulation of industrial couoons on May 31st is expressed 'by the index 117 (1. I. xi 10n), and the purchase coupons with the new index 46 - which on one side is the consequence of saving coupons by town consumers for buying more expensive products, and on the other side - with purchase coupons the end of the compulsory purchase in this year had as a consequence a decrease in circula- tion. The total circulation of money and coupons (31st May index in relation to 1st January amounted to 100,5) in' relation to the situation at the beginning of the year shows a normalised situation and stability, which acted positively on the uniformity of prices of goods and services. The purchase funds of the population, as well as the goods funds from local production and 'imports, whieh have been realised 'in the first five months of this year, correspond :with the dynamics estab- lished in the goods-monetary balance for this year.

(TRG0?,1NSKI ;Wm.-SD - 19th June, 1952). THE USE OF SUBSIDIES FOR THe; WeERING OF PRICES OF GOODS WHICH ARE The problem of sale of goods which are not in demand boils down in fact to the question of a right use of turnover means and on the question of the level of ex,penses in trade, in regard to the new rate of interest. Goods which remain in stock for a long time in enterprises binds a portion of turnover means and makes them unemployable for normal circulation. The rates of interest on such means, which are now much greeter than formerly, become month in month out an expenditure which seriously increases expenses of trade. Particularly so under conditions of the new weges system, which is based on differences in erice, material and other expenses of the enterprise influence the level of the wages fund of the emoloyees. Therefore, the stocks of goods which ere not in demand decrease directly the wages fund of the employees in trade. Therefore each enterprise and its complete workers' collective is interested in liberating itself from stocks which are not in demand. pans obtained need not be used immediatelz Trade enterprises hatureceived in the past few days subsidies from the State for the decrease of prices of goods which are not in demand This measure should eliminate ultimately the conse- quences of the former distributive system in trade and to make possible for the enterprises normal trading in the future. The use of thus obtained subsidies which suits best the interests; ;epresentsta problem, which must occupy the attention of workers' collectives and executive organs of all trecle enterprises. Practice has shown in the last few days already certain defficiences in regard to the employ of obtained subsidies - which are contrary to the correctly conceived interestzof the enterprise. In the first place, subsidies,when the enterprise has already obtained them, lose the character of outside means and become a component part of the turn over means of the enterprise on which the State has no pretentions to get them back, And this means that the obtained means need not be necessarily used at any price immediately to the full extent.If the momentary situation of the enterprise does not require to engage fully the means et) disposal in this period, the enterprise should not lower prices to such an extent, which get the character of spoiling prices in order to achieve a. transitory and shortlived increase of trade. Another occurrence of Wrongly conceived proper interests which has been remarked is that some entorpries use in a linear manner means for lowering the price of a berg? number of articles 1 so te t that with really unsalable goods the lowering of prices is not sufficient to revive the sale of these articles, while with articles which are in demand the lowering of price y not at all necessary. Eati_gome enternthss_ed The most serious irregularity while lowering prices was made by those enterprises, which have carried out this decrease in prise of normal saleable goods, wHle the prices of goods which are not in demand and who are in stock for a long time because of high prices and poor quality,were not at all decreased . Their calcu- lation was d simple and cy.

On the other hand they did not take the trouble to liberate themselves from goods which are not in demand, thinking that the nate will have to in- tervene againpor that the lowering prices of these goods cannot give results - because they think that these goods cannot be sold anyhowi?. even at lower prices and that it is more profitable tO use these means for more luctlative objects. Such a calculation is obviously- short- sighted and directly detrimental to the enterprise itself. Competition with such means to gain customers will give no results, because the enterprise will have to return to normal prices after spending the moans at its disposal. Increase of prices will produce lack of confidence of consumers which will be hard to eliminate afterwards. Such goods will remain in stock. Interest will reduce the wages fund of the employees and the mans will be insufficient to %cop permanently,? the necessary assortment. New subsidies shcbald tot be on nor should they be expected, because such a.measure is incompatible with the present economic system., This means that the enterprises will not be able to operate successfully and to make secur.0 for -employees a corresponding wage, particularily when the rnnning costs have to be covered soon '.l from realised differences in prices. Besides this, enterprises should boar in mind that trade takes into consideration a certain risk and that ,they will come into tie situation to sell some product in the future below the purchasing price. For such cases one should secure means by leading a correct policy in fixing prices, and particularily by taking into account new supplies of goods in needed quantities, corresponding assort- ment and prices, their timely arrival and olher.abnditionS7-WIliOn are imPortant for normalttrading. The'price policy in enterprises is one nf the most important_ and responsible activities where all the members of the wof':.ker8'v. collective should participate compulsively.
