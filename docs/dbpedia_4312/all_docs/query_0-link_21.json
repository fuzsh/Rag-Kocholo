        "text": "LOCAL PRESS\n\nVucic: I did not speak with Pristina, they do not want to talk anyway (Tanjug/Politika/RTS/RTV)\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in Granada on Thursday he had not spoken with Pristina's representatives during the European Political Community summit and added that they did not want to talk anyway. \"Was there any progress? I did not speak with Pristina at all and they do not want to talk anyway, so I do not know what kind of progress you are talking about,\" Vucic said in response to a question from a reporter. He said he had tried to explain Serbia's position to European officials, and noted that he would continue to do that. \"It is not always easy or pleasant... But what can I do? You must fight for your country with all your strength and I hope we will succeed, but I am not promising anything,\" Vucic said.\n\nVucic met with Macron: \"At the end of a long day-an open and meaningful conversation\" (B92)\n\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic met with President of the Republic of France Emmanuel Macron. \"At the end of a long day, an open and meaningful conversation with President Emmanuel Macron on all important issues. I thanked President Macron for his willingness to listen to Belgrade's views, as well as for his personal involvement in the Western Balkans region,\" Vucic announced.\n\nBrnabic: I think Vucic has averted danger of sanctions (TV Pink)\n\nSerbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said on Friday President Aleksandar Vucic had succeeded in averting the danger of sanctions against Serbia, debated in the international community in the wake of the 24 September incident in Banjska, a village in the north of Kosovo and Metohija. Brnabic said this after Vucic attended a European Political Community summit in Granada on Thursday. \"The president had a large number of meetings there with many officials... I think he succeeded in averting the immediate danger of sanctions being imposed, but I cannot speak about details,\" Brnabic told TV Pink. She said Pristina had launched a barrage of disinformation following the Banjska incident and that Vucic had managed to stop it and \"stabilise the situation\". Pristina is not interested in peace, stability or de-escalation, but only in Belgrade being punished, Brnabic said. Commenting on the EU accession process, she said she did not believe there would be any EU enlargement by 2030. \"I am not overly optimistic, but that does not mean we need to give up on the European path,\" Brnabic said.\n\nCommunity of Serb Municipalities should be formed as soon as possible (Tanjug/RTS/RTV/Politika/Novosti)\n\nThe Head of the Office for Kosovo and Metohija Petar Petkovic discussed yesterday with Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and UNMIK Head Caroline Ziadeh the political and security situation in the province in the light of the recent tragic events in the village of Banjska, in the Zvecan municipality. Petkovic recalled that Belgrade has been warning the international community countless times for more than a year that the daily violence and terror of Albin Kurti against the Serb population in the north of Kosovo and Metohija could lead to tragedy and immeasurable consequences, which unfortunately did happen on the night between 23 and 24 September. He underlined that Pristina is persistently trying to blame Belgrade for the recent events in Banjska with fake data and a campaign of lies. He pointed out that Belgrade has always consistently advocated peace and stability in the province and that the Serb side did not need incidents, but that the entire responsibility for the latest developments lies with Pristina. He stated that greater presence of members of KFOR and EULEX should be ensured in the north of Kosovo and Metohija, which would lead to a greater security of the Serb people. In addition, Petkovic underlined that it is necessary to withdraw the “Kosovo police” from the north of Kosovo and Metohija because, as he said, under the Brussels agreement, they have no business to be in this territory and the citizens see them exclusively as an occupying force, which they actually prove that it is the case every day with the violence and terror they exert. According to him, the latest events have unambiguously shown that the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija need an urgent formation of the Community of Serb Municipalities, which would ensure the implementation of their collective and individual rights, as envisaged by the Brussels agreement, and which the Pristina authorities have been refusing to carry out for more than ten years. Petkovic told Ziadeh Belgrade expected UNMIK to take a balanced and objective approach in its assessment of the recent tragic events and their presentation in her next report on the mission’s work.\n\nUS, EU Ambassadors tour military units along Kosovo border (Beta/N1)\n\nThe US and EU Ambassadors toured southern Serbia with Defense Minister Milos Vucevic to see the situation on the ground, Beta said on Thursday quoting the US Embassy in Belgrade. “Ambassadors Hill and Giaufret met in southern Serbia with Defense Minister Milos Vucevic and Chief of Staff General Milan Mojsilovic at their invitation to inform themselves in detail about the situation along the Serbia-Kosovo border,” the Embassy said. The visit comes after Washington called Belgrade to reduce its troop numbers along the border with Kosovo following the armed incident at the Banjska monastery. A Defense Ministry press release said that the ambassadors visited some military units in the Novi Pazar area as guests of the minister and general and “had an opportunity to see that those units were engaged only on regular tasks”. It added that the Serbian military did not fly any foreign nationals in its helicopters, denying claims that Hill flew to Novi Pazar with Vucevic.\n\nBorrell: Situation in Kosovo worse than in June (N1)\n\nThe EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell told reporters in Granada that the situation in Kosovo is much worse than it was in June. Speaking before the European Political Community summit in Spain, he said that meetings are being held to ease the tensions in Kosovo. “President Osmani will be here and President Vucic also. In Chisinau (at the previous European Political Community summit in June), we sat together, we discussed about it, and today we will do the same thing. But the situation is much worse today than at the Chisinau time,” Borrell said.\n\nOrlic: Earliest date for elections 17 December (RTS)\n\nThe speaker of the Serbian parliament Vladimir Orlic said yesterday that elections at the level of the republic, the province of Vojvodina, and some local elections would be held before the end of the year. In an appearance on RTS, he stressed that Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic had clearly stated that elections would be held no sooner than on 17 December. \"This is in accordance with what the opposition has asked for, although it is hard to keep up with this\" since they have been changing their minds and the procedure itself is not quite clear to them, Orlic said. He stressed that it was more than evident that the opposition did not want elections and only wanted power because they were aware that their chances in elections were slim.\n\nJeremic advocates simultaneous holding of elections and referendum on dismissing Franco-German proposal (RTS)\n\nThe President of the People’s Party Vuk Jeremic said yesterday that a referendum on dismissing the “Franco-German” proposal on Kosovo should be held simultaneously with the early parliamentary elections. Jeremic said that “there is no better time” for dismissing the plan that, in his words, brought nothing good, either to the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija or to Serbia. “The dismissal of the ‘Franco-German’ proposal in a referendum that would be held together with the elections, would give the election victors double the legitimacy in the stance toward the international community, primarily toward the key countries of the West that do not favor Serbia, to protect the territorial integrity of the state as the Constitution prescribes,” Jeremic said in an interview with RTS. He stated that the People’s Party advocated the joint running in the elections of all parties that were in favor of dismissing the “Franco-German” agreement and wanted to protect the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija – “the most jeopardized people in Europe west of the Ukrainian front”.\n\nJovanovic says draft media laws foundations for free journalism (FoNet)\n\nSerbian Information and Telecommunications Minister Mihailo Jovanovic said on Thursday that the draft media laws being presented by the government are the foundations for free and responsible journalism. Speaking at the 4th and final round table of the public debate on the draft laws on public information and the media and on electronic media, the minister said that the laws will protect civil rights and maintain democratic values. It’s important to have media laws capable of answering all the challenges we face. According to Jovanovic, the media scene can’t improve without strong and just media laws. The Information and Telecommunications Ministry called the public, NGOs and individuals to take part in the public debate which ends on 6 October.\n\nREGIONAL PRESS\n\nSummit of European Political Community held in Granada; Leaders discuss Ukraine, migration, EU enlargement and relations between Belgrade and Pristina; B&H Presidency Chair Komsic also participates in Summit (FTV)\n\nThe summit of representatives of the European Political Community was held in Granada, Spain, on Thursday. Leaders of 47 countries discussed Ukraine, migration, EU enlargement, but also relations between Belgrade and Pristina. Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani called on Spain, one of the five EU countries that did not recognize Kosovo, to join other countries that support measures to punish Serbia for, as she said, the aggression against Kosovo. “We will seek the support of European leaders to secure the border between Kosovo and Serbia because this is essential for preserving peace and stability in the entire Western Balkans region,” Osmani underlined. When asked if there could be a meeting between her and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic in Granada, Osmani replied that there is no reason to meet before sanctions against Serbia are adopted. Vucic, on the other hand, called Pristina's moves hypocritical. Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob offered a solution for the situation, stressing that new elections in the municipalities in the north of Kosovo are necessary and after that it is necessary to find a solution for autonomy. Golob said that he believes that sanctions would not necessarily lead to a long-term solution, but Slovenia will join in if the EU has a united position. Participants of the European Political Community summit also discussed the issue of energy. President of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen pointed out that the establishment of a common platform for the procurement of gas is a great success. “We have worked hard to ensure our energy security and to make energy affordable for our European households. Today, our storages are filled. We got rid of the dependency of Russian fossil fuels and thanks to this, we have turned Putin's energy blackmail into an empty threat,” von der Leyen said. Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic attended the third European Political Community summit in Granada on behalf of B&H. Komsic held a number of bilateral meetings and attended a panel discussion on security and geostrategic issues held as part of the summit. Komsic joined the condemnations of the war in Ukraine. “Our vote against the Russian aggression against Ukraine is a clear sign that the European Political Community opposes violent border changes and aggression. This is based on our shared system of values and determination to persevere in the fight for those values,” Komsic was quoted as saying.\n\nDodik: RS still committed to B&H’s full membership in EU, but not in radical way (RTRS)\n\nRepublika Srpska (RS) President and SNSD leader Milorad Dodik has said that the RS is committed to B&H’s full membership in the EU, as proven by support of the RS representatives in B&H Parliament when it comes to the adoption of laws from 14 priorities set out in the EC’s Opinion on B&H. He assessed that opening of the EU accession negotiations is an important step towards this goal, but that he believes – unlike many in the Federation of B&H (FB&H) – that this step should be made once there is readiness in B&H and the readiness of partners in the EU. Dodik stated that this story should not be started in a radical way or non-creditably as advocated by FB&H politicians. According to Dodik, negotiations with the EU will come once everyone in B&H accepts two things and one of them is the decision-making without foreigners. “If the EU membership is really important, for the sake of us in B&H and the EU, the opening of negotiations should be left for the period after the EU adopts some strategic decisions in December on what does it want from itself and what does it offers through the enlargement, as well as also for the period after the elections for the European Parliament and the Commission next summer. When it comes to the EU readiness, unlike B&H Foreign Minister Elmedin Konakovic who shown a letter of support for opening of the EU accession talks with B&H signed by seven EU Foreign Ministers, in which there is a vision of a malign Russian influence due to which the talks will be opened, I have no intention to deceive the public in B&H or in the EU. Konakovic’s letter lacks 20 signatures of other EU member states, which means that currently the EU has no agreement on B&H or on Ukraine and Moldova according to his information”, Dodik stated.\n\nCovic: Legitimate representation must be implemented, B&H is a European country and will eventually join NATO alliance (BHT1)\n\nHDZ B&H President Dragan Covic gave an interview for BHT1 during which he was asked, among other issues, to assess the current political situation in (B&H). Covic replied by saying the situation is overcomplex and can be connected to many challenges the country is facing. According to Covic, part of it is connected to the Dayton agreement, arguing that many imperfections and open issued have not been resolved 28 years later. He further stated that ‘a part of us’ still conducts the ‘alibi policy’ that somebody from the international community will do something for us. In this context, Covic said the key word is ‘courage’, that local leaders assume responsibility and reach agreement. He went on to say that if we assume responsibility, one should not be worried for B&H and that “we should strongly adopt decisions at all levels in line with the Constitution”. When it comes to foreigners (foreign judges) in the Constitutional Court (CC) of B&H, Covic reminded of his earlier view that no international representative has a place in institutions of BiH, no matter if it is the CC or any other institution. However, Covic stressed that in this environment it is evident that these people (foreign judges) act because, as he said, “we do not have the courage to adopt decisions by ourselves”. Covic also confirmed there is an obligation to finish the legislation about the B&H CC during October, in other words to complete the discussion in the BiH Council of Ministers (CoM). The HDZ B&H leader also called on everyone in the authority to adopt important European laws. When it comes to the Election Law of B&H, Covic said it must be in the parliament (of B&H) or at least in the B&H CoM by end of October. In the context of solutions that must be adopted, Covic cited the legitimate representation of peoples, stressing that it must be implemented in institutions that decide on collective rights, namely in the Houses of Peoples and the B&H Presidency. “Who will the people elect, it is down to the people. Croat people must elect the Croat member of the Presidency. How? There are several models”, said Covic. He stressed that B&H is a European country and will eventually join NATO alliance. “It is indivisible, and how we will organize ourselves, it is down to us”, added Covic.\n\nArnautovic sends letter to OHR, EUD, OSCE and Quint embassies about political attacks on CEC (FTV)\n\nPresident of the B&H Central Election Commission (CEC) Suad Arnautovic sent a letter to the OHR, the EU Delegation (EUD) to B&H, the OSCE Mission to B&H and the Embassies of Quint countries, pointing to continuous attacks of political parties on the B&H CEC. Arnautovic said that in recent years, severe pressures, intimidation, attacks and threats of the ruling structures to remove and place the B&H CEC under political control have begun. Arnautovic emphasized that the ruling coalition at the B&H level plans to submit amendments to the B&H Election Law to the procedure, which would include the B&H House of Peoples (HoP) in the process of appointing the B&H CEC members, and members appointed by the President of the CEC and members of the Commission appointed by the President of the B&H High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) are excluded from the Selection and Appointments Commission, which proposes members of the B&H CEC.\n\nStevandic: Becirovic and Komsic act in unconstitutional manner; Property is not under their competence (RTRS)\n\nAddressing the press conference, RS parliament speaker Nenad Stevandic stated that Bosniak and Croat members of B&H Presidency, Denis Becirovic and Zeljko Komsic are acting in unconstitutional manner, and they cannot deal with the issue of property, because this is not their competence. “There is no single provision in B&H Constitution which refers to property,” said Stevandic. He stressed that neither OHR, nor embassies or the B&H Presidency can deal with this issue. “For instance, Presidency can create budget, but not the laws. We will prove this in the Assembly. Becirovic and Komsic reached for the issues, which are not under their competence,” said Stevandic. He underscored that as far as RS is concerned, the issue of property is closed: “And the one who opens this issue is acting unconstitutionally and undermines Constitution. Becirovic and Komsic use wartime rhetoric. We will not give the RS and we will defend it.” He stressed that issue of foreign judges in B&H CC and issue of OHR have to be solved. Stevandic stressed that RSNA is ready to confirm all rights of Serbs in B&H, including the right to self-determination, adding that RS parliament will continue to work in line with international conventions and will not allow any oppression of RS and Serbs. He further noted that RS education will remain under its competence, despite the recent decision of Constitutional Court of B&H which annuls and disputes numerous provisions of Law on Assurance of Quality in High Education of the RS.\n\nOffice of Attorney General of RS demasks B&H Presidency members Komsic and Becirovic who sent forged proposal of law on state property in parliamentary procedure (RTRS)\n\nRS Attorney General Milimir Govedarica told RTRS on Thursday that the Office of the Attorney General of the RS has “demasked” B&H Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic and B&H Presidency member Denis Becirovic who planted “a forgery in their proposal of the law on the so-called state property” they have recently sent in the parliamentary procedure. He said that the Office of the Attorney General of the RS noticed that Komsic and Becirovic refer to the verdict of the Court of B&H in the proposal text, although the Court of B&H has never actually passed such a verdict. Govedarica stated that in attempt to usurp the RS’ property, Komsic and Becirovic have prejudged the Court of B&H’s decision upon the lawsuit of the Office of the Attorney General of B&H from 2021, although there was no preliminary hearing. He explained that it is clear from the explanation of the law proposal that it is about forgery, adding that in attempt to prove that the property is under the competence of the state of B&H, Komsic and Becirovic cited the alleged verdict of the Court of B&H that disputes the RS’ competence on forests managed by the ‘Birac’ Vlasenica forest economy. Govedarica noted that the disputable law text reads that the verdict is in favor of B&H and that the lawsuit filed by the Office of the Attorney General of B&H in this case is unconstitutional and unlawful.\n\nRS President thanks Medvedev for his congratulations on Dodik’s re-election as SNSD leader (RTRS)\n\nRS President Milorad Dodik thanked on Thursday United Russia leader Dmitry Medvedev for his congratulations on the occasion of Dodik’s re-election as the SNSD leader. Medvedev stressed that Dodik’s re-election is a clear sign of support of SNSD members for a course that Dodik implements. “You are one of rare leaders in modern Europe who promote balanced and wise policy, who is guided primarily by orientation of the RS citizens. We welcome and share a principled stance to affirm military neutrality of B&H, to strengthen the country’s sovereignty and to set it free from foreign mentorship”, Medvedev said in a greeting card.\n\nGoganovic: RS supports extension of EUFOR mission and appointment of Major General Sticz (Srna)\n\nDeputy B&H Defense Minister Aleksandar Goganovic told Srna that RS institutions support extension of EUFOR Mission and appointing of Hungarian Major General Laszlo Sticz as EUFOR Commander. “We categorically reject allegations of certain politicians from the FB&H that with taking over of EUFOR Command, Hungary will take a side in B&H. We consider such statements highly unfair toward the entire EU which supported Major General Sticz taking over command over EUFOR,” said Goganovic. He said that Major General Sticz is a professional soldier with significant experience and not a politician, and he served in missions in the Western Balkans and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). “On the Other side, Hungary is a serious state, which is EU member since 2004 and of NATO since 1999 and will not allow itself to leave the framework of its competencies,” said Goganovic. He noted that Althea Operation aims to secure implementation of Dayton Peace Agreement and contribute to safe environment in B&H. “RS’ stance is respecting of Dayton Peace Agreement and maintaining of security in B&H and the region, because only in this way, we can move toward EU,” said Goganovic. The daily reminded that Sticz is expected to take over the command of the ‘Althea’ mission in B&H in January next year.\n\nEU leaders meet in Spain to discuss continued EU enlargement (HRT)\n\nSome fifty European leaders have gathered in Granada Spain, for a meeting of the European Political Community, an inter-governmental forum for political and strategic discussions about the future of Europe. The group was established in 2022 after the Russian incursion into Ukraine. This is its third meeting, which this time also gathered the leaders of twenty countries outside of the community, in a bid to solve pan-European and separate, regional issues. The focus of discussion at the meeting is on the war in Ukraine, but also the need for unity within Europe and the continued enlargement of the EU. This has caused a rift among EU member states, as there are those who have warned of the considerable costs that enlargement would burden EU citizens with, noting that enlarging the bloc to include Ukraine and another eight new member states would cost existing member states more than two hundred and fifty-six billion Euros, which is a major concern for member states who are currently the beneficiaries of EU funding. Representing Croatia at the meeting is Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who said that three issued must be taken into account when discussing EU enlargement: “One is the true readiness and passing through the demanding process of negotiations. The second is aspect is budgetary repercussions, while the third is the institutional functioning of the EU.” Meanwhile a conference titled: \"EU Enlargement - Can B&H be a new success story\" was held in Zagreb today. Organized by the office of Croatian Member of European Parliament, Tomislav Sokol of the HDZ, it was also attended by the High Representative for B&H Christian Schmidt, Croatian Foreign and European Affairs Minister Gordan Grlic Radman, and former Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister Mate Granic. In his address, Minister Grlic Radman said that B&H should start negotiations with the EU by the end of the year, as this would help prevent the quote \"malignant influences of third countries,\" and pointed out that Croatia has played a massive role in helping B&H on its path towards EU membership: “The credit for B&H achieving candidate status belongs exclusively to the Croatian Government, and the countries that we approached and which supported us in this. And if you've been following recently, we have also undertaken additional steps, in which we have included another six countries that share our views, and we have jointly signed a letter that we sent to three different addresses, with a request that they take under consideration the opening of accession talks with B&H by the end of this year at the latest.” For his part High Representative Schmidt said that \"there is a political necessity\" for the integration of B&H into the EU: “First I see, indeed a political necessity to bring the integration of B&H ahead into the EU. Second, there are the fourteen priorities. Some of them have improved in development, but not everything is done. We should talk about which opportunity one has in the moment now. Not losing the momentum for B&H to come closer to European integration, with a lot of structural issues and keeping the Dayton structure very strong. So, I refer to the Constitutional Court and my position, we will contribute in the toolbox to this.” Schmidt added however, that the fourteen priorities are no longer the pressing issue, adding that the issues that do require urgent discussion are the rule of law in B&H and some segments of the acquis communautaire, adding that he believes that this is manageable. He went on to say however, that another concern is how the war in Ukraine and that recent clash between Serbian insurgents and Kosovo police in northern Kosovo will affect the region: “We have seen Kosovo, and this should make us very aware that we have to be resilient. And this includes starting negotiations, in whichever way it is defined, in this year with B&H.”\n\nMilatovic presents Platform for Montenegro in the EU to Macron (CdM)\n\nPresident of Montenegro Jakov Milatovic met on the sidelines of the European Political Community Summit in Granada with the President of France Emmanuel Macron, to whom he presented the Platform for Montenegro in the EU, Milatovic’s Cabinet has announced.\n\n“In addition to the positive reactions to the Platform itself, Milatovic received the support of Macron for his commitment to accelerating the EU path of Montenegro, and in the wider context of the Western Balkans region”, the announcement states. Macron invited Milatovic to the Paris Peace Forum and to meet again soon in Paris.\n\nBecic doesn’t accept Zenka (CdM)\n\nThe decisive vote for the election of the new government cannot come from the list led by the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) and its leader, regardless of the technical decisions of who will be in which club of MPs, says the leader of the Democrats Aleksa Becic. This means that it is not acceptable to Becic that the parliament speaker and the government be elected with the vote of the leader of the Democratic Union of Albanians Mehmed Zenka, who decided not to be in the parliamentary caucus of DPS, on whose electoral list it was, but to form a new one with the Albanian Forum. First, the priority for Democratic Montenegro, says Becic, is the successful formation of the new 44th government and the constitution of the parliament of Montenegro. “Second, the true integrity of institutions can only be shaped by those who worked tirelessly to strengthen them, who have a clean past, who do not turn their backs on principles and do not tolerate corruption within their ranks”, says Becic. Third, he rejects with indignation any baseless claims presented in the media under the influence of extreme political factions of both political sides. “Our consistency and loyalty to democratic principles is unchanged. Fake news, spins, illicit influences must become the past of Montenegro”, says Becic. Fourth, he emphasizes, the key value of any government is the character and consistency of the people who shape it. “The government that would be formed by the members of our party will be based on the principles that have guided us since the founding of the Democrats. Our vision is a European-oriented Government that stands firmly with all its allies, strengthens the Euro-Atlantic partnership and consistently fulfils all international obligations”, says Becic.\n\nZenka explains why he supports Milojko Spajic (CdM)\n\nDUA leader Mehmed Zenka has said that he supports the government formed by the Europe Now Movement (PES) leader Milojko Spajic because of the principles and agreement with the PM-designate and constituents regarding those principles. As he says, since the name of DUA, and especially his name, has been mentioned in the public for days in the context of support for the formation of the 44th government, he is obliged to repeat to the citizens and the public that at the consultations with the President of the State, he gave his support for Spajic to be the PM-designate for the composition 44th government. Zenka has underlined that he gives his support with the aim of economic and democratic development and progress of our common state of Montenegro as the next member of the EU.\n\nCamaj: Zenka leaving DPS caucus and Bogdanovic’s statement guarantee that Spajic has 41 MPs’ support (CdM)\n\nThe exit of DUA leader Mehmed Zenka from the parliamentary caucus of the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), and thus from the political course of that structure, as well as the statement of the general secretary of the Democrats and MP Boris Bogdanovic, that everyone who renounces that policy is welcome, is a guarantee that the leader of the Europe Now Movement and PM-designate Milojko Spajic already have the support of 41 MPs, says the deputy leader of the Albanian Forum and the honorary president of the Democratic Alliance of Albanians (DSA) Nikola Camaj. Yesterday, Bogdanovic told Dan that anyone who renounces DPS and their criminal centers of power, who condemns their wrongdoings, and whose hands remain clean of their wrongdoings, is welcome for cooperation. According to Camaj, Bogdanovic’s statement is a good reaction to the ball that was in the Democrat’s court. However, he says that the Euro-Atlantic course is not guaranteed even by 49 MPs if among them there are those who have reservations about Montenegro’s pro-Western course.\n\nKovachevski: Serbia and Kosovo to make right steps for region's stability (MIA)\n\nWe are here to create not destroy. Serbia and Kosovo should work towards peace and make the right steps to ensure a safe future of their citizens but also the stability of the entire region, said Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski on Thursday. Kovachevski told a press conference within the European Political Community summit that conflicts are resolved in accordance with already signed agreements, MIA reports from Granada. \"I talked to the Presidents of Serbia and Kosovo, the Albanian PM and most of the leaders present here. Peace and stability lie in the core of every regional initiative that focuses on economic prosperity but also overcoming challenges among countries,\" said Kovachevski. According to him, North Macedonia is a clear example of resolving issues at home and with neighbors through active and open dialogue. \"I truly believe this region can do much better. We are prepared to offer our experience and support, in order to ensure peace and stability in the region that must join the EU sooner rather than later,\" said Kovachevski. On the statement of Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani that North Macedonia should reconsider its participation in the Open Balkan initiative if it is proven that Serbia was in any way involved in the recent attack in northern Kosovo, the PM said the government's position is unchanged. \"Earlier today, FM Osmani clarified that the statement was given in the capacity of vice-president of a political party. The government's position remains unchanged - we have a constructive role in all regional initiatives, including Open Balkans, as long as those initiatives bring specific benefits for the citizens, the economies and the businesses in the countries involved. We are also active participants in the Berlin Process. Nevertheless, a prerequisite for successful regional initiatives is peace and stability, as well as respect among all neighboring countries taking part in those initiatives,\" said Kovachevski. He added that Tirana will soon host a Berlin Process meeting, putting countries that do not have elementary bilateral communication on the same table. \"That is why I say yes to integration and cooperation, and no to conflicts. As a neighboring country, North Macedonia wants to see conflicts solved in accordance with signed agreements, through good will, for the sake of a better future of people living in all regional states,\" underlined Kovachevski.\n\nPositive signals over EU accession of Western Balkans, says PM (MIA)\n\nNorth Macedonia is a country-leader in the Western Balkans regarding the EU accession process. We already have over 45-percent alignment of our legislation with the EU law, most of our institutions have already harmonized their operations with the EU counterparts, and North Macedonia will surely be part of the EU enlargement, Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski told a press conference within the European Political Community (EPC) summit, MIA reports from Granada. \"The country is finishing the bilateral screening and the report on the first cluster 'Fundamentals' is complete. We are already working on the roadmap as basis for the accession process and the opening of chapters. What remains is for us to fulfil our task undertaken in the Negotiating Framework that has been approved by all 27 EU member-states, by adopting the constitutional amendments, immediately followed by the opening of the first cluster,\" said Kovachevski. According to him, it is important that the EPC summit is taking place a day ahead of the informal European Council meeting focused on the Union's priorities in coming years. \"Following today's discussions, they will tackle enlargement as EU's strategic commitment, but also internal reforms related to the enlargement, thus ensuring the Union's functioning with the new states that are set to join by 2030. Therefore, EPC is an extremely important platform for North Macedonia and the Western Balkans as a whole,\" said Kovachevski. According to him, Europe has managed to show that the only way to peace, stability, unity and prosperity on the continent is through joint efforts by all countries, be it EU members, candidates or aspirants. \"We are geographically and historically part of this continent, sharing common values. A joint security architecture is needed so that Europe lives in peace, freedom and prosperity. Europe has always been the centre of innovation and new processes, which can lead to development of businesses and better standard of life. Tomorrow's informal meeting of the European Council will also show that enlargement remains high on EU's agenda,\" noted Kovachevski.\n\nKovachevski: Elections to be held in regular slot (MIA)\n\nPrime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski said Thursday there is a possibility for a meeting with leaders of all political parties, considering that decisions related to elections are consensual, and noted that the polls would be held in the regular slot. However, he added there is a much more important process than elections - taking decisions that ensure the country's continued Euro-integration path, MIA reports from Granada. \"We can schedule a parliament session next Monday, adopt the constitutional amendments and schedule early elections on the same day. There is another proposal on the table - to start the process of constitutional changes, VMRO-DPMNE to join the government as they requested, finish the screening, open the chapters within the first cluster, close one or two chapters and then hold the presidential and parliamentary elections,\" Kovachevski told reporters regarding the demand of VMRO-DPMNE leader Hristijan Mickoski for a leaders' meeting that would produce a date for snap elections. Kovachevski said the parliamentary and the presidential elections are defined by law, everything else \"is only talk by some who want to grab power without a political programme\". On the Electoral Code amendments, the PM said a working group chaired by a former State Election Commission president has been drafting the changes. \"This working group includes representatives of all political parties, except VMRO-DPMNE. They were invited to take part and even offered to chair the group, but they refused,\" said Kovachevski.\n\nAttack in Banjska/Rama: the EU should react strongly, measures should be taken before it's too late (Radio Tirana)\n\nPrime Minister Edi Rama commented from Spain, just before the start of the European Political Community summit, the situation in the north of Kosovo, and the armed attack on the Police in Banjska on 24 September. In a statement to the media, Rama expressed his concern over this situation and the potential danger that, as he said, is increasing from year to year. The head of the Albanian government said that for the first time in the last 10 years, Albania is not aligned with a EU statement, while adding that Belgrade's national mourning to honor the criminals who shot at the Kosovo Police would be enough for the EU to react strongly and say that this is punishable. Also, he emphasized that measures should be taken before it is too late. \"We have all along been in line with the EU and the US in relation to the need for the Kosovar authorities to move forward and be proactive and constructive in the dialogue and from our point of view take maximum advantage of the Franco-German plan which is absolutely a step quite important ahead and a very good agreement for Kosovo and for the region, but at the same time the fact that the Republic of Serbia declared a day of national mourning for the members of that paramilitary criminal group that killed the policeman was enough for the EU to step up and say this is not European. This is not acceptable. This is not justice, and it is punishable,\" said Rama. Prime Minister Rama also spoke about the integration of Albania in the EU as he pointed out that Europe has many problems to have a compact decision-making and \"to have a strategic thinking and planning, it is able to expand with 33, or 35 or 37 soon\". \"New alternatives must be found to be considered and of course this internal division must become more interactive. For example, the spirit of the European political community should and can be transposed within the perimeter of the EU without necessarily granting full membership, because this will not happen,\" Rama was quoted as saying.\n\nMinisterial/ The Foreign Ministers of the EU and the Western Balkans arrive in Tirana today (Radio Tirana)\n\nToday, Tirana is hosting the Foreign Ministers of the EU and the Western Balkans for a Ministerial meeting held in conjunction with the Berlin Summit. 24 delegations from the member countries of the Berlin Process will gather today in Tirana at the meeting of Foreign Ministers, which precedes the summit of the Berlin Process that will be held in Tirana on October 16.
