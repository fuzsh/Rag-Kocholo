        "meta_description": "It’s a refreshing time for Bogdan Bogdanovic. For the first time since Phoenix drafted in June, first-time observers are noticing his game more than his name.

His averages of 11.4 points per game on 49.2 percent shooting have hoops mind wondering whether his future might be closer to the present than originally predicted. One of Bogdanovic’s teammates seems especially certain of his upcoming success.",
