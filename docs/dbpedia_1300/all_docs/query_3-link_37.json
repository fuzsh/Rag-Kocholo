        "text": "EVANS, Ga. - Mary Arcelia Neal, age 97, of Evans, Ga. and formally of Gray, Ga., died on Sunday, August 17, 2008 at Brandon Wilde, her home since 1996. Miss Neal was born in Ashland, Ga. (Franklin County) on August 24, 1910. She was the daughter and oldest child of the late William Perryman Neal and Ella Brock Neal. She is preceded in death by her sister, Francine Chism and brothers, Woodrow Neal, Paul Neal, Frank Neal, and Russ Neal. She is survived by her brother, Hoyt Neal; sisters-in-laws, Ida Neal, Lavina Neal, Ruth Neal, and Anne Neal; and many nieces and nephews. She graduated from Reinhardt College in Waleska, Ga. in 1943. In 1950, she and all of her other siblings were featured in an Atlanta Constitution article when they were all attending the University of Georgia at the same time, most as graduate students. All seven children worked their way through college. Mary's degree was in Home Economics and she was a home demonstration agent in Elbert, Richmond, and Jones counties through the Cooperative Extension Services and as a 4-H leader. She also taught school 6 years and upon retirement worked as a catering assistant in Gray, Ga. Miss Neal was also an active member of the Pilot Club International and was very active in her local church. In 1973, she was honored by the Gray Methodist Church for her church leadership by receiving the Quiet Disciple Award. She will be remembered for her hospitality, her love of quotes and jokes, as the matriarch of the Neal family, and for her lifetime of care giving in small and large ways to various family members. The family thanks Nancy White for her many years of faithful care giving to Miss Neal. Graveside service will be 3 p.m. Tuesday at the Ebenezer Cemetery in the Ashland community of Franklin County. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the Augusta Alzheimer's Chapter, 1899 Central Ave., Augusta, Ga. 30904 or to the Gray United Methodist Church, Gray, Ga.
