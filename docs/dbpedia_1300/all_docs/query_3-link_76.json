Joining Sophia‚Äôs as a BMM student two years ago opened up doors to a new life altogether. College life in the first year felt academically different. Soon, it evolved into more than just academics. It became about the city, the people, college fests and events, internships, and more. It‚Äôs a unique experience for each of us, making choices between academic learning and fieldwork for future experience. I‚Äôve always prioritized practical work. It might not have been the right choice, but it helped me grow and understand the media world‚Äôs intricacies. This work taught me so much beyond the field itself, making concepts like teamwork, expression, and standing up for oneself very real. The final year of college evokes mixed emotions‚Äîregret for not fully living the college life, not studying enough, not spending enough time with college mates, but also a sense of contentment from applying what I learned in real-world scenarios. I‚Äôm clearing my headspace for the next two semesters to turn all my 'what ifs' into 'so what‚Äô. #heartfelt #college #sophia #internships #academics #experiences\n\nüíº Employers play a crucial role in the IAESTE programme by offering internships to international students.

Many of us dream of flying high and making our mark early, and I‚Äôm excited to share that my dream is now a reality‚ÄîI‚Äôm starting my first International internship! Securing this opportunity while still in my undergraduate studies is something I can‚Äôt fully describe in words. In today‚Äôs competitive world, it feels incredibly lucky to have this opportunity. I always knew stepping out of my comfort zone wouldn‚Äôt be easy, but this is what I‚Äôve always wanted. The past few days have been filled with ups and downs. There were moments of doubt, and not everyone around me was confident I could pull it off. But deep inside, I knew I had to trust myself and push forward. One of the most thrilling parts of this journey was taking my first-ever international flight. The feeling of crossing borders, both literally and metaphorically, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never forget. The feeling of doing something on your own and making it happen despite the challenges is truly unbelievable. My advice? Trust yourself, no matter what. Life isn‚Äôt easy, and the best things don‚Äôt come without effort. But if you believe in yourself and keep pushing, you can achieve your dreams. Wishing everyone the best in your own journeys! #dreambig #internships #keeppushing #newbeginnings #trustyourself #linkedindaily #linkedin #learning #international #grateful #networking #concordiauniversity #IIT #IITGN #IITB #engineering"
