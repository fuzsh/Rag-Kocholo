        "text": "elevated dw5eI July 29, 1960 – October 26, 2023\n\nelevated dw5eI It is with great sadness to announce that after a brief illness Mary Anne Neal (Wilflin) passed away on October 26, 2023 at 63 years old. Mary Anne will be welcomed in Heaven by her mother, Joan Wilflin (Crane), and her father Joseph Wilflin.\n\nMary Anne was born and raised in Etobicoke and moved to Brampton when starting a family. She will be terribly missed by her husband of 38 years, Arthur, her daughter Jennifer, her son Christopher (Jeanette), her two grandchildren Julie and Charlotte, her sister Bernadette (David) Pratt, and her brother Michael Wilflin.\n\nMary Anne lived a wonderful life and brought joy and kindness to everyone she knew. Mary Anne’s love of books led her to a long career at the Brampton Public Library, from which she retired in 2021. She had many decades-long, close friendships and she will be missed by many and their families. Arthur and Mary Anne loved to travel and were open to learning about the world and all it had to offer. Most of all Mary Anne loved her family and made them a priority at every turn. Her children and grandchildren brought her great pride and she was sure to show you a picture and share a story with every visit.\n\nMary Anne will be forever in our hearts.\n\nIf you are considering making a donation in her memory, one her favorite charities was the Diabetes Hope Foundation. They help provide education and resources to youth with diabetes.\n\nelevated dw5eI Visitation\n\nWednesday November 1st, 2023 from 9:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m.\n\nCatholic Cremation Services\n\n6933 Tomken Road, Mississauga, ON L5T 1N4\n\nelevated dw5eI Funeral Service\n\nWednesday November 1st, 2023 at 11:00 a.m.\n\nCatholic Cremation Services\n\n6933 Tomken Road, Mississauga, ON L5T 1N4"
