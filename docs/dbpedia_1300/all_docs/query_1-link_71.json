        "text": "This song tells of John McCann’s love for Mary Neal (O’Neill, Neil in some cases), his trial for attempting to elope, her evidence that leads to his acquittal, their second, successful elopement and their boarding a ship for Canada only to be wrecked almost in sight of land. John heroically saves Mary, they land and her father, relenting sends money to help them.\n\nMy first encounter with Mary was in the pages of Colm O Lochlainn Irish Street Ballads and, a bit later, in the 1888 publication of Henry Halliday Sparling’s Irish Minstrelsy which reproduced a text from an Athlone printed ballad sheet of 1840. The song was fascinating – it underlined the social conditions of nineteenth-century Ireland where marriage was mostly not seen as romantic but as a commercial transaction; a poor man had little chance and servants simply did not marry the daughters of their employers, or even aspire to. The song was wishful thinking, an imaginative reversal of the norm. However, during my stint at the Ulster American Folk Park (see Songs in Education and Songs on a Subject – Emigration) I began to find evidence that suggested that the song held elements of truth.\n\nI presented that evidence to a session of the Ulster American Heritage Symposium held at The Museum of Frontier Culture in Staunton, Virginia, USA in 1994. The paper was called Two Ulster-American True Romances and it also told the story of Anne Jane Thornton, the female sailor. I’ve separated the two because I now know much more about Anne Jane and she gets her own pages. Here is what I said about Mary Neal on that occasion, with a few slight adjustments.\n\nMary Neal – Staunton, VA, 1994 – audio visual presentation\n\nI regard myself, in the first place as a singer; my subject is songs and that they are worth singing. I am fascinated by the interplay of singer and song; of voice and meaning; of audience and performer; of the past being given a present context through the performance of an old story in a modern setting, coupled with the expectation that the modern audience will take the story absolutely seriously.\n\nBoth my stories have an Ulster setting and a north American one; each occurs in three forms: as printed ballad sheets (in different versions and from different sides of the Atlantic), as traditional songs (also in different versions and from the old and new worlds) and partially or completely in English and Irish newspapers (also in different versions). The disentanglement of all these sources, the different attitudes they represent and their relationship to the truth, will occupy me for some of the time but mostly I want you to enjoy the stories.\n\nCharming Mary Neal (Text from Sparling: Athlone 1840; air Joyce Old Irish Folk Music and Songs 1909) I am a bold undaunted youth, my name is John MacCann. I'm a native of sweet Donegal, convenient to Strabane; For the stealing of an heiress I lie in Lifford jail And her father says he'll hang me for his daughter Mary Neal Whilst I lay in cold irons, my love she came to me: \"Don't fear my father's anger, for I will set you free.\" Her father gave consent to let me out on bail, And I was to stand for trial for his daughter Mary Neal. Her father kept her close confined, for fear I should her see, And on my trial day, was my prosecutor to be; But like a loyal lover, to appear she did not fail, She freed me from all dangers; she's my charming Mary Neal. With wrath and indignation, her father loud did call, And when my trial was over, I approached the garden wall, My well-known voice soon reached her ears, which echoed hill and dale Saying, \"You're welcome here, my Johnny dear,\" says charming Mary Neal We both sat on a sunny bank, and there we talked awhile. He says, \"My dear, if you will comply, I'll free you from exile. The 'Shamrock' is ready from Derry to set sail; So come with me, off to Quebec, my charming Mary Neal.\" She gave consent, and back she went, and stole the best of clothes And to no one in the house her secret she made known; Five hundred pounds of ready gold from her father she did steal, And that was twice I did elope with charming Mary Neal. Our coach it was got ready to Derry for to go, And there we bribed the coachman for to let no one know; He said he would keep secret, and never would reveal. So off to Derry there I went with charming Mary Neal. It was to Captain Nelson our passage money paid, And in the town of Derry it was under cover laid. We joined our hands in wedlock bands before we did set sail. And her father's wrath I value not - I love my Mary Neal. It was over the proud and swelling seas our ship did gently glide, And on our passage to Quebec, six weeks a matchless tide; Until we came to Whitehead Beach we had no cause to wail, On Crossford Bay I thought that day I lost my Mary Neal. On the ninth of June, in the afternoon, a heavy fog came on; The captain cries, \"Look out, my boys! I fear we are all gone.\" Our vessel on a sandy bank was driven by a gale, And forty more washed overboard, along with Mary Neal. With the help of boats and the ship's crew, five hundred they were saved, And forty more of them also have met a watery grave. I soon spied her yellow locks come floating down the waves: I jumped into the boiling deep, and saved my Mary Neal. Her father wrote a letter as you may understand, That if I would go back again he would give me all his land. I wrote him back an answer, and that without fail, \"That I'm the heir of your whole estate, by your daughter Mary Neal.\"\n\nA nice romantic extravagance: a noble heroine and an equally courageous hero in turn saving each other from a life threatening peril; a malicious and then whining father, told eventually, if politely, to stay lost.\n\nTotal fabrication one would assume; made in a general pattern to counter, in imagination, the actualities, in nineteenth century Ireland of class division, of arranged marriages and their very close association with property and the control of females, first by their father and then by a husband. There’s a common American song which begins: “O hard is my fortune and hard is my fate, Controlled by my parents both early and late, And when I get married to end all the strife, Controlled by my husband for the rest of my life.” (Jean Ritchie: ‘Bachelor’s Hall’ or with differences in ‘Waggoner’s Lad’) And so it was in Ireland; many songs tell stories of misalliance – of family opposition to lovers and of elopement, sometimes, as in Mary Neal, involving emigration (Robert Wright’s Irish Emigrant Ballads and Songs, which is a compendium drawn from the available sources, contains more songs linking emigration with love, than any other category save only songs of farewell.) : a few examples of songs of elopement would be: Sweet Dunloy, My father’s servant boy, The County Tyrone.\n\nSongs of the People #577 Sweet Dunloy On the twelfth day of November last, I hope you'll bear in mind, My love and I, we did agree to leave our friends behind. We bid farewell to Galdanagh, likewise to sweet Dunloy, We were bound for bonny Scotland, our fortune for to try. To Londonderry we set out without the least delay, A vessel bound for Glasgow town, she at the harbour lay, Our passage paid, we stepped on board to leave the Irish soil, The moon shone bright, she gave us light as we sailed down Lough Foyle. The captain on the deck did stand, the ocean for to view, The passengers were blythe and gay, we had a jolly crew, Our gallant ship did quickly sail across the rolling tide, We longed to see fair Scotland's shores, likewise the banks of Clyde. At break of day next morning the Clyde came in our view, Where stately ships at anchor lay in numbers not a few; Dumbarton rock we soon beheld and likewise Greenock town, And if anyone they followed us, we prayed they would go down. The Broomielaw we soon did reach when we thought all trouble o'er, And vowed we'd join in wedlock's bands when on the Scottish shore, But her father followed after us, it grieves me here to tell, And he swore an oath that got us both placed in a prison cell. Then back again he did us bring, as you shall quickly hear, And vowed I would transported be for enloping with his dear; Two bailsmen then I had to find, the sum being forty pounds, To stand the next assizes to be held in Omagh town. July the sixth the law came on; young Lizzie proved my friend, She says, 'I did enlope with him, on this you may depend, I left my home and country and with him I did go, And forever I'll prove constant to my own young darling Joe.' Her father from the witness box at me he cast a frown, He says, 'The young man's guilty, his name is Joseph Brown.' When the jury heard the evidence, it did not favour me, For the judge says, 'Brown, you're guilty, and imprisoned you must be.' It's when I heard my sentence, it grieved my heart full sore, Twelve months to lie in Belfast jail my fate for to deplore, Still thinking of my own true love, young Lizzie is her name, But when I get my liberty I will enlope again. Now to conclude and finish, I mean to drop my pen, These lines to all young lovers I'm determined for to send: I am at the law's defiance, but once I do get free, We'll sail to Philadelphy, the land of liberty. S of P #198 My Father's Servant Boy [Laws M11] Ye lovers all, both great and small, attend unto my theme: There is none on earth can pity me but those that feels my pain; I live between Dungannon and the town of Aughnacloy, But now I'm in America with my father's servant boy. Where is the man who will or can a farmer's son despise? His bread to win he does begin before the sun does rise, My love and I are Adam's seed, I never will deny, There is none on earth I love as well as my father's servant boy. My parents wished to have me wed unto a gentleman, And in the church we were to meet and join in wedlock's bands. The night before I strolled from them unto a village nigh, Where there I met my own true love, my father's servant boy. I took my love along with me, I could do nothing more, I bid adieu to all my friends and to the shamrock shore. To Belfast town we both went down where the Ackythere did lie And in that ship I sailed away with my father's servant boy. When we reached the other side, our money was all gone. Some time we were supported by a friendly Irishman, Till gentlemen from Ireland did give us both employ: Two pounds a week I do receive with my father's servant boy. I left my parents lonesome, in sorrow they did weep, Day and night condoling without a wink of sleep Until I sent a letter to the town of Aughnacloy Saying, 'I am in America with my father's servant boy.' They sent an answer straight to me in Philadelphia town, Saying if I would come home again I would get five hundred pound, But I was joined in wedlock, which crowned my life with joy, And until I die I'll ne'er deceive my father's servant boy. This was the news that I did send from Philadelphia town, That where they were worth a shilling, I was worth a pound, With pleasure and contentment I never will deny, I am living in America with my father's servant boy.\n\nSimilarly, there are in the records of the Assize Courts (the half yearly courts held in each county which dealt with serious matters) numbers of trials for abduction (Galway Spring 1835) ; how many of them hiding elopements, difficult to tell, for many girls must have been intimidated into abandoning their erstwhile lover to whatever fate the law determined.\n\nThe version of Mary Neal given above is from a ballad sheet, printed with eight or sixteen others one-sidedly on a sheet by a printer in Athlone, though most were printed in Dublin or Cork. It is to be expected that some details will be general, like the name of the ship “Shamrock”; there may have been one registered, or unregistered in every port. However, there is a tendency, when songs which have been learned have been in oral currency for a while for them to acquire local detail. For example, a song printed as early as 1825 as ‘Mary of Limerick town’ appears some ten years later as ‘Mary of Belfast’ and in the 1930s as Sweet Eliza the Pride of Portrush.\n\nSweet Eliza the Pride of Portrush The First Monday in August as early I strayed, On the road to Portrush I spied a fair maid, Her cheeks blushed like roses, her hair was dark brown She was beautiful Eliza of Portrush Town. I stepped up to her and this I did say, Are you fairest Flora, or goddess. of May, There's no beauty breathing in fame or renown, Can equal young Eliza from Portrush Town. I said my sweet fair maid to pity incline My heart you have wounded sweet female divine I freely would resign an Imperial Crown To enjoy you lovely 'Liza of Portrush Town If you will consent love my sweet bride to be, With jewels and diamonds I will adorn thee With choicest wine love all sorrows we drown At my habitation in sweet Portrush town. Then she sighed and said, young man, take pity on me For the young man I loved, has crossed the deep sea, I hear he has married some girl of renown So here I live single in Portrush Town. Since he proved inconstant single I'll remain No man breathing my favours shall gain, May fortune with success my dear will I crown Tho he left me mourning in sweet, Portrush Town Finding this fair maid so loyal and true I said sweetheart Eliza I am returned to you Tho' seven long years I have roved up and down My heart remained with you love in Portrush town. She flew in my arms with joy and surprise, While gazing on me with two sparkling eyes, On a bunch of primroses we did sit down, On the soft mossy banks near Portrush Town. So early, next morning, this couple they went To the church and got married, with parents' consent, With a great store of riches, his darling did crown, So now they live happy in Portrush Town.\n\nHence it was only with passing interest that I noted that the version of Mary Neal published in 1925 by the Coleraine collector, Sam Henry, (he called it Charming Mary O Neill) had the name of the ship as the Charlotte Douglas\n\n55 Charming Mary O'Neill [Laws M17] I am a bold undaunted youth, my name is John McCann, I'm a native of sweet Donegal, convenient to Strabane; For the stealing of an heiress I lie in Lifford gaol, And her father swore he would hang me for his daughter, Mary O'Neill. Then full of wrath and anger her father then did bawl, When my trial it was over, I crossed the garden wall, For like a loyal lover, to appear she did not fail, And she freed me from all danger, my charming Mary O'Neill. Her coach it was got ready to Derry for to go, And soon she bribed the coachman for to let no one know, He said he would keep the secret and never would reveal, So off to Derry then we went with charming Mary O'Neill. It was to Captain Wilson our passage we did pay And in the town of Derry we under cover lay, 'The Charlotte Douglas ready lies from Derry to set sail, So off to Quebec, come along,' cries charming Mary O'Neill. It was over the proud swelling waves our ship did gently glide While on our passage to Quebec, six months on a matchless tide, Until we came to Whitehead Reef we had no cause to wail; On Goffard Bay I thought that day I would lose my Mary O'Neill. On the ninth of June in the afternoon a heavy fog came on. Our captain cries, 'Look out, my boys, I fear we are all gone!' Our vessel on a sandbank was drifted by a gale, And forty were washed overboard along with Mary O'Neill. With the small boats and help of the crew, five hundred lives were saved, And forty of them now, alas, have met a watery grave. Her yellow locks I then espied come floating with the gale, I jumped into the raging deep and saved my Mary O'Neill. Her father wrote a letter, as you may understand, He said that if we would come back, he would give me half his land; I wrote him back an answer and told him without fail; Five pounds a week I now receive with charming Mary O'Neill.\n\nso, it was only out of curiosity that I looked up the name in Sholto Cooke’s book about Londonderry shipping in the nineteenth century: The Maiden City and the Western Ocean and was intrigued to learn that a ship of the name Charlotte Douglas had been wrecked on 9th June 1836 on Whalehead reef in Gaspé‚ Bay at the mouth of the St Lawrence. It appeared possible that the details of this event had been added to an existing song in order to lend it local and topical currency. However, as I examined the details of as many of the available song versions as possible a different conclusion was forced.\n\nSholto Cooke, and the Londonderry Journal gave the details above with the name of the Captain, McNeilage and that most of those on board had been saved; three lives were lost. Of fifteen song texts, from ballad sheets and oral sources, all except three, one published in Athlone, and two collected in Canada, named the ship as Charlotte Douglas and one of the exceptions called it Charlie Stewart. All had the ship leaving Derry and gave the destination as Quebec while most named the Captain, Nelson or Wilson, McNeale was given once; close enough to the unfamiliar McNeilage. The date of the wreck was with two exceptions, 9th June (otherwise, after six weeks or on 4th June) and took place on Whitehead Beach or Reef, with an occasional diversion to Woodland Reef or Wheaton’s Head which was located in Gosford Bay (8) Gosport Bay (1) Crossford Bay (2), Gaffard Bay (1), Guysboro’ Bay (1) Gaspé Bay (in one orally collected version from Newfoundland). Though the newspaper makes it clear that only three were lost, the songs all say that 40 (or so) people were washed overboard, “along with Mary Neal” and that, apparently, only she was saved.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the song texts preserve all, or something close to, the elements of the ship’s voyage and wrecking, including the name of the Captain; with the exception of the loss of life – a tabloid exaggeration, perhaps.\n\nSo, the shipping and wreck elements of Mary Neal derive from a true incident, even though the fate of the passengers and John McCann’s rescue of Mary Neal are wildly exaggerated; AND why, I thought, should the elopement and trial not also be factually based? The likelihood was that the two elements were almost contemporaneous and that the trial had been a celebrated one for otherwise, the song-maker would hardly have thought of associating them. Another factor in my conclusion that the events were near in time was the possibility of commercial advantage if the people who constituted the song-maker’s market would remember the true incidents and buy the ballad as a record of the sensational event.\n\nIt is true that the Assizes for the County of Donegal were held at Lifford (Map of 1777 showing Omagh, Strabane and Lifford).\n\nIt is also true that the natural port of departure for emigrants who lived in north-west Ulster was Derry. However no John McCann had been tried, convicted or anything else at the Assizes in Derry, Carrickfergus, Omagh, or Enniskillen for the several years prior to 1836. I began to believe in fiction again; until an item in the reports of the County Armagh Lent Assizes of 1835 caught my eye:\n\nA LOVE AFFAIR – THE KING AT THE PROSECUTION OF CHAS O’NEILL AGAINST CHARLES GAVIN. (Belfast Newsletter March 24th 1835)\n\nThis case had excited a great deal of interest, three true bills having been found by the Grand Jury – 1st for abduction; 2nd for larceny; 3rd for receiving goods knowing them to be stolen. – The first indictment had been sent up from the Crown Solicitor’s office, but it being ascertained, the circumstances were not such as would make out a case of felonious abduction, the counsel for the crown abandoned the prosecution. Mr O’Neill having been robbed of property to a considerable amount, the prisoner aiding and abetting in carrying the parcels off which were found in his possession in Armagh, to which he was traced from the County of Antrim, he was indicted for larceny. On this he was put to trial on Monday, but was acquitted.\n\nOn Tuesday the prisoner was arraigned on the third indictment, as the receiver of goods, knowing them to have been stolen.\n\nCharles O’Neill, a highly respectable gentleman farmer, being sworn, said that he resides at Aldergrove, in the parish of Killead, county of Antrim. On the morning of the 8th Sept. last he found that during the night his house had been robbed, and property to a considerable amount taken away, consisting of wearing apparel belonging to his daughters, Lucinda and Mary, and their mother – two webs of bleached linen and a writing desk, containing a gold watch, chain and seals which had cost him 36 guineas – œ3 in notes and silver – a collection of ancient coins, a gold brooch and some trinkets – besides valuable securities and family documents. He found his daughter Mary, under sixteen years of age, was missing – and on further inquiry, the prisoner, who had been employed by him as a servant and labourer about three weeks before, had also gone off. He sent parties in pursuit of the fugitives – pursued them himself Belfast and thence to Armagh where, on Tuesday the 9th Sep. he found his daughter and the prisoner in the house of Bernard Hagan, a publican. The luggage which they had brought with them was pointed out to him by Hagan, and he recognised his writing desk, which had been broken open, and the watch, money and trinkets taken out – all the rest of the stolen property he recovered, and the watch he subsequently got from his daughter, but the money and the brooch he has not been able to get back. He has lost also, the sum of œ14, which his daughter borrowed, in his name from Mr Black, one of his neighbours, the night before her elopement, and which he has subsequently repaid. The prisoner was arrested, and he (Mr O’N) returned home with his daughter being bound to prosecute at these Assizes.\n\nMary O’Neill, a very pretty interesting girl, was next sworn. – She is the second daughter of the last witness; remembers the night of the 7th Sept. last; eloped with Charles Gavin; took away with her wearing apparel belonging to her sister and mother; her own clothes; two webs of linen and a writing desk belonging to her father; the desk contained a gold watch, œ3 in money, a gold brooch, some trinkets &c.; a servant-maid, who is now a prisoner in Carrickfergus Jail, helped her to take away the parcels and her trunk; she gave them to Gavin who had a car waiting for her at a short distance from the house, and he placed her and the goods on the car, and she went with him to Belfast; he there forced open the writing desk, took out the gold watch, and the brooch and the money; he kept the brooch and the money; she had told him they belonged to her father; she saw the brooch with him in Armagh; she gave him the money she got from Mr Black; he laid out money on their expenses in Armagh; he induced her to leave her father’s; the prisoner did not know she had brought away her father’s goods with her; she told him in Belfast; it was the servant girl advised her to take things with her and helped her. The poor girl gave her testimony with visible reluctance, and appeared agitated a good deal on turning round to identify the prisoner who appeared to be a very hardened culprit, and often attempted to communicate with her, by looks and smiles, during the trial. – In her cross-examination she admitted it was a love affair; she desired Gavin to open the writing desk; upon her expressing a wish to have it opened, he said he would do so if she pleased; he gave her back the watch; does not know what he did with the money and the brooch; he never told her to take anything belonging to her father.\n\nBaron Penefather charged the Jury. He said as to the prisoner’s moral guilt, there could be no doubt; but the question for them was whether the prisoner had received any goods, the property of Charles O’Neill, in this county, knowing them to be stolen. There could be no doubt of his having received them in the county Antrim; for he must have known, and he had been told it, that the property belonged to the father of the girl he had taken away. The brooch had been seen with him in Armagh, and the Jury might presume he had received it there and, if so, the prisoner was guilty, whether the girl gave it to him or not, for he knew it was her father’s\n\nThe Jury found the prisoner guilty; and his Lordship passed sentence upon him of fourteen years transportation, observing that it was necessary for the ends of justice to visit the offence with the highest punishment that the law authorised, for, in fact, he had not only aided and assisted in stealing the prosecutor’s goods, but in robbing him of his daughter.\n\nThis trial created much excitement, every person being anxious to get a sight of the handsome fair one. She had to be escorted from the Court-house to her lodgings by the police. Her “dear Charley” (as she called Gavin the prisoner) was anything but prepossessing in his appearance. The judge, we are informed, commuted his sentence, next morning to seven years transportation. A petition was afterwards got up in his behalf by some of the inhabitants of the city, which was readily signed by Miss O’Neill. Report says she will be heiress to a large fortune.\n\n[NOTE: The Belfast Newsletter report of the sentences at these Assizes retains the fourteen years transportation in Gavin’s case.]\n\nOn the same page, under reports of the Antrim Assizes (held in Carrickfergus)\n\nElizabeth Wilson, for stealing on 7th September last, two webs of linen, a variety of wearing apparel, a writing desk containing a gold watch, trinkets, money in notes and silver and securities. the property of Charles O’Neill of Ballymacilhoyle, near Killead, a respectable and extensive farmer. The prisoner in the case was one of the actors in the felonious love affair, the particulars of which, in a trial at Armagh Assizes, are given in another column. It appeared that she had resided with Mr O’Neill as servant, for a period of twelve months, and that his daughter had, partly by the advice of the prisoner, eloped with Charles Gavin; and that she had at the instance of the prisoner (Telling her she might as well possess herself of as much as she could, as prosecutor would never give her any more) take the articles mentioned in the indictment, which were handed out of prosecutor’s window by his daughter, at midnight, to prisoner, who afterwards carried them to where Gavin was standing, and afterwards assisted him in putting them on the car that conveyed Gavin and prosecutor’s daughter to Belfast. Prisoner, for her services, was to have been employed as servant in the house to be taken by Gavin, in case of an ultimate marriage with prosecutor’s daughter. – Counsel for the prosecution cited an authority, where encouragers were held guilty of a larceny as much as the principals, and even where not benefitted by the transaction. The identity points having been fully proved, the Jury found the prisoner guilty accompanied with a recommendation in mitigation of punishment. – Sentence deferred.\n\n[I can find no record of the sentence in this case.]\n\nI’ve now inspected several years of Assizes reports and can find nothing more likely; or better. The whole complex of accounts; the song, the wreck and the felonious elopement is worthy of greater analysis than I can give it at the moment. The most striking differences are in the contrasts: between the emigrant’s fear of shipwreck and the actual frequency of such events (of 9 600 known sailings between 1847 and 1853 there were 59 losses; this is obviously not complete since it omits sailings from the smaller ports); and between the song’s gleeful representation of the elopement, and the attitude of the father, the court and the newspaper. I think it unlikely that Charles Gavin was such a villain as he is represented; he obviously attracted the sympathy of the ordinary people of Armagh. I hope to develop the theme further particularly since the story of another song, Erin’s Lovely Home, has such close similarity to the account given in the report of Gavin’s trial, that I wonder whether it owes anything to this event. [END]\n\nPOSTSCRIPT (December 2020)\n\nMy fifteen song versions (out of many more) all use the name Mary Neal, Neil, Nail, with the exception of Sam Henry who has O’Neill, and all say she was an heiress. All name John McCann and all but three say that he was a native of Donegal convenient to Strabane. The others (from Canada) give Denagogue, Scotland, Donegal, Strawval and Millertown, Strablane. All save one Canadian one, which says Wexford, have him imprisoned at Lifford. Two other Canadian versions don’t mention a place of incarceration at all. It’s still unproven but absence of evidence is inconclusive and I will continue to believe that the song is about Mary O’Neill from Killead and that the song maker (and his public) preferred a fictional hero from Donegal, and an air of nobility about him, over the snivelling, sneaking Charlie Gavin.\n\nHere also are abstracts from the Londonderry Journal as they refer to the last voyage of the Charlotte Douglas.\n\nAnd the details of her wrecking."
