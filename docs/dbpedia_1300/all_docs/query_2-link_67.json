        "text": "Join us for an Encore performance of the Dr. Mary Neal Episode on Saturday, July 15, 2023 at 1pm EST!\n\nJoin Dr. Jan Holden and Todd Hewey for an ENCORE webinar\n\nAbout Episode 1 - Dr. Mary Neal\n\nDr. Mary Neal was an Orthopedic Spinal Surgeon and an experienced whitewater kayaker when she drowned in 1999 on the Fuy River in Chile. She spent the next 30 minutes underwater. When her dead body was recovered, she incredibly regained consciousness, telling an amazing story of what she experienced on the other side of life.\n\nJoin the upcoming IANDS 2023 Annual Conference!\n\nFor more information and to register for the upcoming IANDS 2023 Annual Conference in Washington, DC, August 30th to September 3rd, CLICK HERE.\n\nReviews of Episode 1 - Dr. Mary Neal\n\nThat is outstanding! I have seen many NDE shows, and you have one of the best I have ever seen. Beginning is very strong and gripping. It would create a sense of relevance for the viewer and keep them watching. Mary Neal is outstanding, articulate, and completely credible (as is Eben). The graphic depiction of Mary’s NDE is outstanding! Congratulations!Dr. Jeffrey Long - Oncologist and Director of NDERF\n\nI just saw Episode 1. Masterful! Mary's experience is so well-presented. Using artistic rendering for aspects that could not be recreated on film was an inspiration -- and so engaging! I'm amazed at how you focused on the most important points -- her religious upbringing, her pre-NDE non-spiritual stance, how that stance was transformed by her NDE.... I can't wait to see the remaining episodes and for your production to gain widespread access.Dr. Janice Miner Holden - Professor Emerita of Counseling, University of North Texas. President, International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS). Editor, Journal of Near-Death Studies\n\nI am speechless. Powerful. I was moved to tears by the beauty represented. Awesome… Overall, really well done. I think using artistic renditions was an inspired and effective way to communicate the essence of something that cannot be communicated with words.Dr. Mary Neal - Orthopedic Surgeon\n\nYour creative, almost dreamy recreation illustrations in this animation style was perfect and entertaining. Those heavenly scenes are so captivating and well executed. It’s a fascinating and appropriate storytelling support method. Great idea used in good taste. Just falls in line with a dream sequence which felt natural. I was able to visualize the drama of her underwater experience and her time in the heavens with ease and wonder. A totally dreamy and convincing touch. Millions should see and experience this. Good stuff. I just could not look away.Doug Butts - EVP Programming, INSP\n\nMary Neal's NDE is the best one that I know of, and Inspiration Ministries had done an exceptional job of accurately documenting her testimony. Mary is very pleased with the production and she has been featured many times in all media. If you are going to see the best, than this is the one you must watch.Howard Storm - Pastor/Professor\n\nSee what everyone is saying about the Life Beyond Death Series!\n\nAbout the NDE Files\n\nSurvey Professionals around the world say the top five most trusted professions in the world are Doctors, Nurses, Scientists, Teachers and First Responders. Join us as we examine how these trusted individuals dealt with the single most traumatic event that changed their lives forever…their own deaths. This is their story of Life Beyond Death from the NDE Files.\n\nThis new series about Near Death Experiences uses artist renditions and animations to dramatically demonstrate each NDE in ways never seen before in a television program.\n\nEpisodes\n\nEpisode 1 - Dr. Mary Neal\n\nDr. Mary Neal was an Orthopedic Spinal Surgeon and an experienced whitewater kayaker when she drowned in 1999 on the Fuy River in Chile.\n\nEpisode 2 - Dr. Rajiv Parti\n\nDr. Rajiv Parti died while undergoing surgery, was cautioned by his father at the edge of Hell and met with two Archangels and the Angel of Light.\n\nCurrently Seeking Funding\n\nEpisode 3 - Eben Alexander III, MD\n\nEben Alexander III, MD served as an Academic Neurosurgeon for over 25 years, including 15 years at Boston Brigham and...\n\nEpisode 4 - Professor/Pastor Howard Storm\n\nProfessor Howard Storm was an Atheist, Artist, Professor and Chairman of the Art Department for Northern Kentucky University, when in 1985 he died at a hospital in Paris France.\n\nHi Folks!\n\nMy name is Todd Hewey. I’m the Creator and Producer of the television series Life Beyond Death from the NDE Files. Thank you for showing interest in this dynamic, emotionally charged, animated anthology about highly educated and scientifically minded individuals who have had extraordinary Near Death Experiences that dramatically changed their lives forever.\n\nI also hope that you can help us directly, by donating what you can to complete the last episode for this ongoing anthology of life-changing Near Death Experience stories.\n\nEnjoy the teaser trailers for Epsiode-1, Epsiode-3 and Episode-4. You can also watch the more-detailed 16-minute “Torch” video that comprises sections from all three completed episodes.\n\nWe need to raise $135,000 to finish Episode-2. Then we can license the series to networks interested in this subject, which will open even more opportunities to fund additional Near Death Experience stories.\n\nIf any of you have interest in exploring “for-profit funding options” to help us complete this series, please contact me, Todd Hewey, at info@lifebeyonddeath.tv. You can also reach me through the Inspiration Switchboard 803-578-1000.\n\nThank you for your interest and financial support for this important life-changing project."
