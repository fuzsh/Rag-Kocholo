        "text": "Moore & Associates can help Maryneal Texas workers against illegal employment practices.\n\nThe Maryneal Texas employment lawyers at Moore & Associates have been assisting clients for almost twenty years, with violations of labor law, employer discrimination actions and unfair compensation. State labor laws must either comply with federal, or national labor laws, or exceed them in order to be legal.\n\nLabor law violations in Maryneal Texas.\n\nIt is prudent to hire experienced employment attorneys in Maryneal Texas when questionable employment activities arise so they can build a solid case around the facts laid out to them. Common and costly labor law mistakes include violations of:\n\nMinimum wage and overtime requirements per established employment law,\n\nSafe working environment for employees,\n\nWorkers’ compensation for on the job injuries,\n\nEmployee misclassification,\n\nDiscrimination, or harassment of employees.\n\nMaryneal Texas Minimum wage and overtime lawyers.\n\nA Maryneal TX unpaid overtime attorney can make sure employers are adhering to the Federal Labor Standards Act that requires overtime pay of at least one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per workweek. Texas law addresses the federal guidelines on minimum hourly wage, meaning nearly all employees must be paid $7.25 an hour for their labor and Maryneal Texas unpaid overtime lawyers can address deviations from these required practices.\n\nSafe working environment.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) was created to ensure workplace safety for employees. If an employer does not take the appropriate measures to make the workplace safe, they can face OSHA sanctions and fines, along with formal complaints and lawsuits from employees. Employers are responsible for educating employees about all relevant potential hazards on the job and must provide appropriate OSHA training.\n\nMaryneal Texas Workers’ compensation.\n\nTexas requires employers to carry some sort of workers’ compensation insurance to pay for work-related injuries. In almost all cases, if a worker sustains an injury while working for a specific employer, that employer must cover the costs related to that injury. These costs include medical fees, rehabilitation fees, and the wages not being earned due to disability. The complaint process may be expedited when an Maryneal Texas experienced labor law attorney is acting on behalf of an injured employee.\n\nMaryneal TX Discrimination, harassment of employees.\n\nFederal anti-discrimination laws support many lawsuits brought against employers for age, disability status, gender pay gap, sex, race, religion, national origin, and pregnancy, to name a few and include:\n\nTitle I of Americans With Disabilities Act\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act\n\nPregnancy Discrimination Act\n\nEqual Pay Act\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act\n\nWorkplace discrimination/harassment in Maryneal TX.\n\nA sexual harassment lawyer in Maryneal Texas can initiate legal action against workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. There are state and federal laws to protect employees against the harms of those negative interactions, and an experienced Maryneal TX employment lawyer can be very helpful in explaining avenues of resolve to clients.\n\nWorkplace discrimination occurs when an individual is adversely discriminated against, due to a multitude of factors defined by law.\n\nWorkplace harassment is a form of discrimination that includes unwelcome behaviors by managers, clients, and co-workers, or other workplace associates.\n\nEmployer retaliation includes acts to punish an employee. If an individual is fired because they speak out about harassment and discrimination, they should immediately consult with a Maryneal TX workplace harassment lawyer to remedy the complaint.\n\nRecognizing retaliation.\n\nRetaliation may come in a series of random acts that detract from an employee’s ability to advance in their job, including bad performance reviews, job description changes, micromanagement, exclusions from active projects, or requests to work less hours, resulting in pay cuts and cases of unjust termination.\n\nEmployees can make informal complaints to their employer, file a formal complaint, file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and/or State Commission on Human Rights Division, or hire a Maryneal Texas wrongful termination attorney to file a lawsuit when attempts to complain about negative workplace behavior results in retaliatory acts, including job loss.\n\nFair compensation.\n\nThe Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division and sets standards for minimum wages, overtime pay, time keeping records, and child labor. If an employer is not paying the minimum wage and overtime wages in accordance with Federal laws, it may be illegal, depending on an individual’s work status, and the type of business where they are employed. An experienced unpaid wage attorney in Maryneal Texas can help with the recovery of earnings for Texas employees.\n\nMisclassification.\n\nAn employer may attempt to by-pass federal overtime law by telling an employee that they are working in a “salaried” position. They will then attempt to pay workers a lump sum total of 40 hours’ worth of minimum wage, and claim that they are not required to pay overtime compensation, which is in clear violation of overtime laws. If an individual feels they have a strong case against an employer, they should contact a Maryneal Texas unpaid wage lawyer.\n\nOvertime exemption.\n\nNot all employers are required by law to pay overtime wages, although exceptions are rare. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires companies with over $500,000 in annual sales and those that participate in interstate commerce, or business between states, to pay their workers an overtime wage. Employers in Maryneal Texas are required to follow the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act that governs minimum hourly wages, overtime wages, duration of pay periods, appropriate payroll deductions, required pay statement information, payment of final wages, and much more.\n\nDamages.\n\nDamages are awarded to remedy intangible injuries, such as emotional anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, pain and suffering, injury to professional community standing, injury to reputation, injury to credit and loss of health. Economic damages are easier to quantify and include potential moving expenses, job search expenses, medical expenses, behavioral health expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses directly related to the negative employer practices.\n\nSeek legal counsel.\n\nIf an individual believes they are the victim of any labor law violations, they should immediately contact Moore & Associates to discuss options against unfair employment practices. Maryneal Texas discrimination lawyers will review the case and devise a strategy to recover damages.\n\nMoore & Associates\n\nHouston Employment Law Attorney\n\nPhone: (713) 222-6775\n\n440 Louisiana Street, Suite 675\n\nHouston, TX 77002\n\nor\n\n427 W Twohig Avenue\n\nSan Angelo, Texas 76903\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.twc.texas.gov/jobseekers/texas-minimum-wage-law#:~:text=The%20Texas%20Minimum%20Wage%20Act%3A%20Establishes%20a%20minimum,statement%20containing%20certain%20information%20about%20the%20employee%27s%20pay.\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/\n\nhttps://www.osha.gov/workers/file_complaint.html\n\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/whdfs21.pdf\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/minimumwage\n\nhttps://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/2019-regular-rate\n\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/retaliation"
