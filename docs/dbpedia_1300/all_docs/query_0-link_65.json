        "meta_description": "Mary Emma Neal     September 17, 1925~August 12, 2018  Mary Emma Neal, 92, was granted her angel wings on August 12, 2018, surrounded by her loving family. She was born on September 17, 1925 in Sunflower, Mississippi to Shelly and Irma Neal. She was preceded in death by both parents; three brothers, Fillmore, Leroy and James; and sister, Katherine Neal Singleton.  Mary Emma accepted Christ into her life at an early age, while living in Mississippi. After moving to Toledo she joined Calvary Missionary Baptist Church where she remained until her death.   Mary Emma was employed by Mercy Hospital as a housekeeper for over 20 years. She retired more than 30 years ago. Patients and co-workers often commented on how they appreciated her words of encouragement.   Mary Emma will always be remembered for living her life her way, even at 92 she would be the first to tell you 'I AM DOING JUST FINE, MY HIP HURTS A LITTLE, BUT I CAN STILL COOK FOR MYSELF, TAKE CARE OF ALL MY PERSONAL NEEDS AND I STILL WALK-UP TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS SEVERAL TIMES A DAY'.  On Sundays she did all of these things for herself, came down stairs, sat in her favorite chair and closed her eyes and slept away. 'SHE DID IT HER WAY.'  She leaves to cherish her memory, two sons, Terry (Doris) Neal and Michael Neal; 15 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren, and a host of loving and dear nieces, nephews, cousins, and three dear friends, Mrs. Douglas, Mrs. White and Miss Ella.",
