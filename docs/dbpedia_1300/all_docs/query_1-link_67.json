        "text": "John A. Biagi, a beloved father, grandfather, brother, and friend, passed away on July 29, 2024, at 10:26 p.m. at his home in Prescott, WA, surrounded by his family. John lived each day as the \"best day of his life,\" embracing every moment with zest. He was a devoted Catholic, a loving father, doting grandfather, and a generous friend known for his storytelling and adventurous spirit.\n\nBorn on June 11, 1952, in Walla Walla, WA, John was welcomed into the world with his twin sister Judy. His parents, John R. and Geneva, who were renowned for their sweet onions, expanded the family with siblings Bob, Debbie, Karen, Terri, Angela, and Donny. John excelled as a Little League catcher and carried his love for baseball into supporting his sons in their baseball careers.\n\nIn his early 20s, John pursued rodeo as a bull rider while studying at Walla Walla Community College. Despite numerous injuries, he earned his PRCA card and competed professionally from the Houston Astrodome to the Calgary Stampede. He cherished the lifelong friendships he formed and was a valued volunteer at the Pendleton Roundup.\n\nJohn's late 20s and 30s were marked by family growth and a passion for bass fishing. He married Carolyn (Nelson) Biagi in 1979, and they welcomed daughter Katy, son J.C., and later, Brian. John worked his way to become one of the top professional fishermen in the northwest. He made multiple state teams, won the B.A.S.S. Western Regional tournament, earned two trips to the B.A.S.S. National Championships, and was a half-pound away from qualifying for the Bassmaster Classic. As his children grew, he shifted from fishing to hunting, spending quality time with his family.\n\nJohn's career as a farrier was a labor of love, allowing him to work closely with horses and build lasting relationships with clients. After being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2017, John transitioned to golf, working at Wine Valley Golf Course and making new friends. Moving to Prescott to be with J.C., Katie, and their children, John took great joy in being a devoted grandpa, known affectionately as \"Dapa.\"\n\nJohn is survived by his children Katy Scheck (Matt), J.C. Biagi (Katie), and Brian Biagi; seven grandchildren: Morgan, Ariana, Francesca, Giovanni, Geneva, Gabriella, and Alexandra; and seven siblings: Judy Reid (Larry), Bob Biagi (Debbie), Debbie Daniel (Howard), Karen Blasdel (Dan), Terri Neal (Mike), Angela Anderson, and Donny Biagi, as well as 34 nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, John and Geneva Biagi and his niece Stacey Reid. John will be remembered for his unwavering faith, love of life, and his ability to bring joy to those around him.\n\nVisitation and viewing will be held on Friday, August 9, 2024, from 3:00 p.m. until after the Rosary. The Rosary will be recited at 6:00 p.m., Friday, August 9, 2024, at the Chapel of the Herring Funeral Home, with Father Andrew O'Leary officiating. The Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday, August 10, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., at St. Patrick Catholic Church, with Father Kevin Oiland celebrating. Burial will follow in the East Garden of Mountain View Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to Providence St. Mary Regional Cancer Center or Birthright through the Herring Groseclose Funeral Home, 315 W Alder St, Walla Walla WA 99362. In addition, friends and family are invited to sign the online guestbook at ."
