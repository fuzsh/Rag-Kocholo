Besides that, she was just very pleasant, very courteous, and she also let me know that the neurologist in New Jersey, not that she said it, were kind of worthless because they really didn't know what they were talking about. Anyway, I was very, very happy with her, and I'm delighted, and if I ever have some issues in the future that I need a real truthful answer to, I will come back. Okay, goodbye."
