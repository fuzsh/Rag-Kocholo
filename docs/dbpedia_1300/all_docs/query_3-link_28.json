        "text": "Husband, this will be hard to hear,\n\nbut you’re dead, and I hate your ghost.\n\nYou died in such small increments that I think\n\nyou may have missed your own last breath, but even so,\n\nit was no less the shock to me. Fetal with grief,\n\nI felt such eiderdown relief that anything of you remained\n\nthat I encouraged him to hang around, a charm against\n\nthe solitude that seemed to seep in under every door.\n\nI thought it might be a bit like having a cat. But\n\nit’s nothing like having a cat.\n\nThe blow was realising that he’s really nothing like you,\n\ndarling, he’s cold, and when he slides between the sheets\n\nat night, I inch away. OK, I more than inch:\n\nI now sleep in a different room, with lights on, and\n\nhe sleeps in what was formerly our bed.\n\nI’ve steadily yielded whole rooms to him, but still,\n\nsomehow, he’s always in my way.\n\nI tried with him, truly I did –\n\nI crept from my sleepless room\n\nto ice myself beside him two or three times, but\n\nhe was never hungry, like you.\n\nEventually, I remembered that, of course,\n\nghosts never are.\n\nWorse still, he does some things that frankly creep me out –\n\nthe crawling, the shapeshifting.\n\nAnd this will be the hardest thing of all for you to hear:\n\nyour dog detests him too. I’m sorry,\n\nsweetheart, but you always had two rules:\n\nWe must be honest with each other.\n\nAnd,\n\nWe don’t involve the dog in our delusions. It has its own life.\n\nThe first of these applies, I think, and so,\n\nalthough this must be very hard to hear,\n\nI knew you’d want to know.\n\n…\n\nMary Ford Neal is a writer and academic based near Glasgow. Her debut collection Dawning (Indigo Dreams) will be published in August 2021. She is assistant editor of 192 Magazine and Nine Pens Press, and was Pushcart nominated in 2021."
