Mary Sargeant Neal was born 10 August 1810 in Goffstown NH, the second daughter and third child of William A. & Rebecca R. Neal/Neil.

Reportedly she was a descendant of Scottish and Welsh immigrants.

Mary was a social reformer (especially of marriage), author, vegetarian, campaigner for women’s rights, and proponent of the “Water-Cure” (hydropathy). Hydropathy was a practice that used water as a healing substance. The water could be taken internally or externally, and it could be recommended hot or cold.

She was involved in the many reform movements of the 1840’s to 1850’s concerning diet, dress, health, woman’s rights, and relationships between men and women. She is sometimes called “The first female advocate of free love in the United States.” Beginning about 1837 she presented a series of health lectures on human anatomy and physiology, to large classes of ladies and women’s social clubs in New England. In 1844 she began writing for the “Democratic Review,” and contributed articles to the “American Review,” “Harpers,” and “Godey’s Lady’s Book.”

Her book, Mary Lyndon, was an autobiographical novel speaking out against many social institutions in the United States. The New York Times review said: “If we did not believe it to be a book of very bad tendencies, we should not pay it the compliment of giving it this prominent and unusual notice.”—New York Daily Times, August 17, 1855.

Using the nom de plume, Mary Orne, she also wrote “Uncle John, or it is too much trouble,” “Agnes Norris, or the heroine of Domestic Life,” and “The Two Loves, or Eros and Anteros.” She was a friend of Edgar Allen Poe, and provided a description of his cottage (in Fordham NY) in an article she wrote titled: “Reminiscences of Edgar Allan Poe,” and published in the Six Penny Magazine in February 1863.

In 1857 they converted to the Catholic faith. They emigrated to England in protest of the American Civil War.

Thursday, April 23, 1857, St. Alban’s Messenger (St. Albans, Vermont) Page 2. –Dr. T.L. Nichols and Mary Gove Nichols, of “free love” notoriety, were baptised on last Sunday afternoon, in St. Xavier church, Sycamore street, Cincinnati, by Rev. Father Oakley, Record of the College, having been duly converted to the Catholic faith. With them were also baptised a daughter of Mrs. Nichols by a former husband, and a Miss Hopkins, of the free love Yellow Springs institution.

She married twice, first to Hiram Gove, and second to Dr. Thomas Low Nichols. She died 30 May 1884 in London, England. See her partial family tree below.
