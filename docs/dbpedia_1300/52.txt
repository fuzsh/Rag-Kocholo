At the University of Mary, Neal Kalberer’s name is nearly synonymous with Marauder Athletics and his distinctive voice is one you’ll never forget. Kalberer made his first appearance at Mary College in 1972, serving as assistant basketball coach to the Marauders first coach, Fritz Fell, and then to Al Bortke from 1973-76. During that time he also served as the intramural director and worked in student development. In 1976, Kalberer accepted the head boys’ basketball coaching position at St. Mary’s High School in New England, ND, where he also served as athletic director, assistant principal, and assistant superintendent. In 1982, Kalberer returned to Mary College as the director of Talent Search. By 1985, he was the director of admissions and served that role until 1990, when he was named the vice president of public affairs.

Throughout his various positions at the University of Mary, Kalberer has actively supported Marauder athletics. From announcing at football games and women’s basketball games, to flipping burgers at Marauder athletic events, Kalberer has supported the “blue and orange” through victory and defeat. He is also known for his infamous Sportsfest costumes. Sportsfest, a costume party extravaganza, is an annual event at the University supporting Marauder athletics.
