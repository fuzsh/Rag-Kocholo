Kinetic Pty Ltd and Tenneco Automotive have developed a passive suspension system hereafter referred to as a Kinetic2 system. The motivation for the design of the system is discussed, and the function of the system is briefly explained. In a previous paper, the system has been shown to improve the stability and rollover resistance of a small SUV. In this study vehicle response characteristics are found by simulating a typical sinusoidal sweep maneuver. Improved handling is evaluated by simulating NHTSAâ€™s yaw acceleration feedback fishhook test. Lastly ride is studied by simulating the vehicle driving over a characteristic stretch of California Freeway #5. All of the simulations were performed on a small SUV in standard form and equipped with the Kinetic system. Results of the ADAMS simulation are presented, and benefits are discussed.
