LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS, October 14, 2003 - Tenneco Automotive (NYSE: TEN) announced that its patented Kinetic® suspension technology will be featured on the 2004 Lexus GX 470 sport utility vehicle. Lexus - the luxury division of Toyota - is launching its Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, a version of the Kinetic® Reversible Function Stabilizer (RFS) technology, as an option on the luxury SUV through a licensing agreement with Tenneco Automotive.

"We are very excited to introduce our break-through Kinetic® suspension performance technology to the marketplace on the 2004 Lexus GX 470," said Mark Frissora, chairman and CEO of Tenneco Automotive. "We are proud that Toyota has recognized the special capabilities of Kinetic® that provide drivers with enhanced comfort and stability."

In a recent Lexus news release regarding the 2004 GX 470, the company described the Kinetic® suspension system as adding "another layer to the GX 470's impressive on-road ride and handling prowess and off-highway capability."

"The GX 470 offers the ultimate in luxurious adventures," said Lexus Group Vice President and General Manager Denny Clements in a recent news announcement. "Enhancements for 2004 emphasize our commitment to offering the most luxurious and most capable SUVs in the market."

Kinetic® RFS technology performance has been tested under rigorous conditions through Citroen's use of the technology in recent World Rally Championship events where RFS action gave Citroen's entries more even wheel loading, consistent handling and improved traction. The Citroen team made a historic first, second and third-place victory sweep at Monte Carlo in its first full event of the season with the RFS system and they currently lead the manufacturer's championship.

Tenneco Automotive continues to create and develop breakthrough suspension solutions for all segments of the automotive market. The company is currently pursuing several development opportunities with OE customers involving its Kinetic® technology.

About Kinetic® Technology Kinetic® RFS is a distinctive variation of the basic proprietary Kinetic® suspension concepts that provide reduced articulation stiffness, increased roll stiffness and decoupled roll and bounce damping in a passive system without use of motors, pumps, sensors or computers. The RFS interconnects the front and rear stabilizers of the vehicle in order to optimize suspension performance in both on and off road environments.

On road, the system provides greater sway stiffness when required for crisp handling response, while at the same time providing improved comfort over bumpy surfaces. Off road, RFS enhances wheel travel and articulation freedom, allowing the vehicle to traverse obstacles with greater ease and comfort, all without requiring power or sensors for operation - a suspension approach and functionality entirely unique in the automotive market.

Tenneco Automotive is a $3.5 billion manufacturing company with headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and approximately 19,600 employees worldwide. Tenneco Automotive is one of the world's largest producers and marketers of ride control and exhaust systems and products, which are sold under the Monroe® and Walker® global brand names. Among its products are Sensa-Trac® and Monroe Reflex® shocks and struts, Rancho® shock absorbers, Walker® Quiet-Flow® mufflers and DynoMax® performance exhaust products, and Monroe® Clevite® vibration control components.

This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the company's anticipated introduction of a ride control product and technology for a customer. Words such as "will," "plans," "become" and similar expressions identify these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of the company (including its subsidiaries). Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the company's plans and actual results could differ materially. For example, realization of future sales from awarded business is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties regarding, among other things, new technologies that reduce the demand for certain of our products or otherwise render them obsolete. In addition, the company's customers generally have the right to replace the company (or its subsidiaries) with another supplier at any time for a variety of reasons and have increasingly demanded price decreases over the life of awarded business. Consumer and customer acceptance of new products and technologies also present risks and uncertainties. Other factors that could cause the company's plans and results to differ materially from current expectations are described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, to which you are referred for additional information. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release."
