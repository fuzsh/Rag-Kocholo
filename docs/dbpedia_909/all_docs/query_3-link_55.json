        "text": "KINETICS® SHSpring Vibration Isolation Hanger\n\nKinetics SH hangers are used to isolate suspended sources of both noise and vibration. Typical uses include suspending mechanical equipment such as in-line fans, cabinet fans, and piping and ductwork in close proximity to mechanical equipment\n\nKinetics SH vibration isolation hangers are available preloaded, designated as Kinetics SPH.\n\nFeatures\n\nPolyester Powder Coated Bracket and Spring Coil\n\nSelf-Centering Cap; Patent No. 5,653,426\n\nRequest A Quote\n\nKinetics SH Vibration Isolation Hangers are designed to reduce the transmission of vibration and noise produced by suspended equipment and piping. SH Hangers incorporate a high deflection color-coded spring element, a No-Short spring cap, and noise isolation pad, assembled into a stamped or welded hanger bracket. To assure stability, the spring element has a minimum lateral spring stiffness of 1.0 times the rated vertical stiffness. SH Hangers will allow a support rod misalignment through a 30° arc without short-circuiting. Isolation brackets will carry a 500% overload without failure. Hangers are available in deflections from 1\" to 4\" (25 to 102 mm) and in capacities from 35 to 3850 lbs. (16 to 1746 kg). SH Hangers are effective in isolating vibration produced by low rpm equipment. Kinetics SH Hangers are recommended for the isolation of vibration produced by suspended mechanical equipment, in-line and exhaust fans, ductwork, piping, etc.\n\nKinetics SH hangers are used to isolate suspended sources of both noise and vibration. Typical uses include suspending mechanical equipment such as in-line fans, cabinet fans, and piping and ductwork in close proximity to mechanical equipment\n\nStandard SH hangers are shipped fully assembled and ready for installation in threaded metal rod suspension systems.\n\nKinetics SH hangers are available in a wide range of load and static deflection selections and can be provided with labor-saving accessories for adaption to wire or strap suspension systems, and spring may be preloaded for ease in erecting piping at a fixed elevation.\n\nVibration isolators for suspended equipment, with minimum static deflection requirement exceeding 0.4\" (10 mm), shall be hangers consisting of a free-standing, laterally stabile steel spring and elastomeric washer in series, assembled in a stamped or welded steel bracket.\n\nThe bracket shall be finished with a polyester powder coating. The manufacturer shall provide independent laboratory testing showing that the bracket with this finish has endured a minimum of 1,000 hours of exposure to salt spray fog testing per ASTM B117 without signs of corrosion.\n\nThe hanger bracket shall be designed to carry a 500% overload without failure and to allow a support rod misalignment through a 30° arc without metal-tometal contact or other short circuit.\n\nThe 1\" and 2\" hanger brackets shall incorporate spring caps with indexed steps which correspond to the washer diameter of appropriately sized hanger rod to keep the rod centered in the spring cap and reduce rod misalignment. The spring caps are protected under U.S. patent number 5,653,426.\n\nSprings shall have a minimum lateral stiffness of 1.0 times the rated vertical stiffness.\n\nSprings shall be selected to provide operating static deflections shown on the Vibration Isolation Schedule or as indicated on the project documents. Springs shall be color coded or otherwise identified to indicate load capacity.\n\nVibration isolation hangers shall be Model SH, as manufactured by Kinetics Noise Control, Inc."
