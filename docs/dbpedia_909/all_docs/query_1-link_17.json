        "text": "WABCO is a leading global supplier of braking control systems, technologies and services that improve safety, efficiency and connectivity of commercial vehicles including trucks, buses and trailers. Its diverse products and services include integrated braking systems and stability control, air suspension systems, transmission automation controls, as well as aerodynamics, telematics, and fleet management solutions. WABCO, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), generated â¬3.3 billion in revenues in 2018 and has some 16,000 employees in 40 countries.\n\nWolf-Henning Scheider, CEO of ZF, said: âWe believe that, together with WABCO, ZF can form the worldâs leading integrated systems provider for commercial vehicle technology, creating long-term value and security for its customers, employees and owners. For ZF the acquisition of a specialist and leader for commercial vehicle braking systems means adding a stable and growing business segment and enables our existing commercial vehicle division to expand its expertise in vehicle dynamics control. This will create the foundation for ZF to offer comprehensive systems for safe and automated mobility solutions for passengers and goods to our customers. This is also in the best interest of our owners, the Zeppelin Foundation and the Dr. JÃ¼rgen and Irmgard Ulderup Foundation, as the transaction will result in a sustainable strengthening of ZF.â\n\nJacques Esculier, Chairman and CEO of WABCO, said: âJoining forces with highly respected ZF will create a leading global technology company well positioned to capitalise on future demand for autonomous, efficient and connected commercial vehicles. We have a long history of successful collaboration to develop innovative technologies with ZF with both companies sharing an uncompromising drive for excellence, passion for innovation, and exceptional customer focus.â\n\nCombination of successful and complementary business lines\n\nThe planned acquisition is part of ZFâs Next Generation Mobility strategy and will expand the companyâs expertise to include commercial vehicle braking solutions for the first time. This plays a central role for the control of automated driving functions â including emergency braking manoeuvres of trucks and trailers. Following the acquisition, customers of both companies will have a partner in ZF who can offer them a fully integrated system approach, new drive systems for E-Mobility and autonomous driving functions. ZF expects that automated driving functions will primarily be implemented for commercial vehicles and in areas with low complexity and traffic (e.g. factory sites, airports, agriculture). The combination of both businesses is expected to further accelerate the development of new technologies to enable autonomous commercial vehicle functions, making ZF less dependent on the economic cycle of the passenger car industry.\n\nThe planned strategic acquisition of WABCO is consistent with ZFâs goal to develop and deliver technology solutions that make cars and commercial vehicles see, think and act in order to reduce emissions and increase road safety. While ZF already has sensor systems and computing technology for its âseeâ and âthinkâ competence, together with WABCO ZF will in future be completing the portfolio for commercial vehicle technologies to offer solutions to allow vehicles to âactâ. ZF is already a leading supplier in the area of steering and driveline technology.\n\nDr. Konstantin Sauer, CFO of ZF, said: âThe intended strategic acquisition of WABCO comes at a good time for ZF. Following the successful integration of TRW, ZF has significantly reduced its debt levels. In fact, we overachieved in delivering our debt reduction targets. WABCO is a healthy and growing company with a strong cash flow profile that makes it a seamless fit with ZF and supports the implementation of our strategy.â\n\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, other customary closing conditions and shareholder approval with more than 50 percent of WABCOâs outstanding shares. ZF expects to close the transaction in the beginning of 2020.\n\nDue to the cash flow profile of both parties, ZF expects to reduce financial leverage significantly again following the completion of the transaction.\n\nAbout ZF Friedrichshafen AG\n\nZF is a global leader in driveline and chassis technology as well as active and passive safety technology. The company has a global workforce of 146,000 with approximately 230 locations in some 40 countries. In 2017, ZF achieved sales of â¬36.4 billion and as such, is one of the largest automotive suppliers worldwide.\n\nZF enables vehicles to see, think and act. The company invests more than six percent of its sales in research and development annually â in particular for the development of efficient and electric drivelines and also in striving for a world without accidents. With its broad portfolio, ZF is advancing mobility and services for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and industrial technology applications."
