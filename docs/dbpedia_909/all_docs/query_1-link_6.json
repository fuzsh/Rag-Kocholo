        "text": "The Electrified Powertrain Technology division bundles the competencies for the increasing electrification of the powertrain in the passenger car driveline sector. As a technology leader, ZF will further expand its leading position and offer all desired powertrain solutions with a comprehensive portfolio for every manufacturer. The key to success here is a range of products from components to systems completely from a single source: flexible and scalable, cross-manufacturer and cross-platform.\n\nZFâs Commercial Vehicle Solutions (CVS) division is helping shape the future of commercial transportation ecosystems. Our mission is to be the preferred global technology partner to the commercial vehicle industry. Powerfully combining ZFâs commercial vehicle systems expertise, extensive technology portfolio and global operations, the division serves the full commercial vehicle industry value chain.Â As the automotive industry progresses towards an increasingly autonomous, connected, and electrified (ACE) future, ZFâs CVS division innovates, integrates and supplies components and advanced control systems that help make commercial vehicles and fleets operate more safely and sustainably. CVS unites ZFâs former Commercial Vehicle Technology and Commercial Vehicle Control Systems divisions, the latter being formed following ZFâs acquisition of WABCO in Spring 2020.Â\n\nIndustrial Technology is the division where ZF bundles its activities for âOff-Roadâ applications. In addition to the development and production of conventional axles and driveline systems for a wide range of applications, the focus is on electrified or hybrid solutions as well as digital products and services that help make off-road mobility more sustainable, safer, smarter, and more reliable in the future.\n\nThe division's diverse product portfolio includes solutions for agricultural and construction machinery as well as for forklifts, special vehicles and rail. The Industrial Technology division is also responsible for the global business in marine propulsion technology, as well as industrial gearboxes and micro mobility solutions. Test systems for all kinds of applications in driveline and chassis technology are also included in the portfolio. And the division is in charge of ZF's activities in wind power technology.\n\nThe Aftermarket division is both an architect and pacesetter for the Next Generation Aftermarket and the preferred partner for fleet and aftermarket customers worldwide. ZF Friedrichshafen AG's leading aftermarket and fleet solutions portfolio is built on its strong brands; LemfÃ¶rder, SACHS, TRW and WABCO. A broad product and service offering, advanced connectivity solutions for digital mobility management and a global service network, support and enhance the performance and efficiency of all vehicle types throughout their life cycle."
