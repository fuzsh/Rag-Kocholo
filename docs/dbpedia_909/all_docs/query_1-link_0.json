        "text": "The global automotive suspension system market size was valued at USD 45.45 billion in 2023. The market is projected to grow from USD 47.25 billion in 2024 to USD 107.12 billion by 2035, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period.\n\nAn automotive suspension system comprises a mechanical system of springs or shock absorbers connecting the wheels and axles to the chassis of a wheeled vehicle. This system further allows the relative motion between the wheels and axles, thus absorbing the impact from varying road surfaces.\n\nThe surging demand for enhanced comfort and safer ride quality in vehicles is fueling the global market. Additionally, technological advancements in suspension systems concerning future mobility, electrification, and autonomous driving technology are expected to drive market growth. However, the high capital investment and suspension component costs and shortage of raw materials hamper market growth.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected the market, causing disruption in supply chains and leading to shortages of raw materials and components. Manufacturers witnessed increased production costs, due to increased cost of materials and operating while following the safety protocols issued for the prevention of outbreak of coronavirus. Major players shifted to growing e-commerce platform to generate sales and focused on developing suspension systems for electric & hybrid vehicles.\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Market Trends\n\nUse of Advanced Lightweight Material to Further Support the Adoption and Trend of Electrification of Vehicles\n\nOne of the market trends in automotive suspension system is the increased use of advanced materials, such as carbon fiber and aluminum, to reduce the weight of the suspension and increase its efficiency. For instance, in February 2023, Elka Suspension tested a composite spring prototype for off-road vehicles at King of the Hammers 2023, which is an off-road racing event held in Johnson Valley, California, February 5-11, 2023. This technology was tested on Can-Am Maverick X3. Composite springs are up to 30% lighter than metal springs. For UTV, the composite springs could reduce the weight of the vehicle by 14 pounds. The composite ability to store energy per unit mass is also higher than steel.\n\nThe increasing adoption of air and active suspension systems has aided market growth during the forecast period. Dynamic suspension systems play a vital role in an electric vehicle, providing comfort and safety to the driver. Advanced sensors and control systems are used to improve systemâ€™s performance. Thus, the development of new suspension systems that are more energy-efficient, intelligent, and lightweight drives the market during the forecast period. For instance, an Electronically Controlled Active Suspension System (ECASS) has fewer moving parts and operates without fluid in the dampers. The system also generates power using linear electric motors and dampers, which benefits electric vehicles.\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Market Growth Factors\n\nSurge in Demand for Electric & Autonomous Vehicles to Propel Market Growth\n\nElectric vehicles typically have a lower center of gravity than vehicles with internal combustion engines.
