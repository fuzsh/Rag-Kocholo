        "text": "We are thrilled to showcase our excellent skills in the latest Euro NCAP - For Safer Cars, Vans & Trucks release, testing a best-seller SUV. As an accredited Euro NCAP laboratory, TASS International demonstrated its ability to test against the latest Euro NCAP test protocols for Occupant and VRU Protection alongside the Safety Assist systems, assessing: ‚úñ Collision avoidance performance in intersection scenarios üö® Information and warning functionalities in blind spot and exiting scenarios üö∏ Emergency braking performance in reversing scenarios üèç Lane keeping capabilities in overtaking motorcycle scenarios ‚§¥ Emergency steering support in collision avoidance scenarios\n\nthe new fully electric ID7 tourer from Volkswagen \"Funktion in Bestform\" The package of the ID models ID3 and ID7 is still very much based on the Golf and Passat models. Nevertheless, they have different names and different design languages. Is this differentiation still necessary and profitable for VW? Maybe you can somehow tell from the ID models that VW is refusing to give them the knighthood with the classic successful names... What do you think? #mobility #IndustrialDesign #ProductDesign #VW #id7 #passat https://lnkd.in/ebHDHmBe\n\nLeads TXT 3865076300 1979 Honda CB750K 10th Anniversary Limited Edition at No Reserve: This 1979 Honda CB750K is a 10th Anniversary Limited Edition example that spent time with a single owner in California before its 2022 acquisition by the seller, reportedly following over two decades in storage. Subsequent recommissioning work is said to have included overhauling the four Keihin carburetors, flushing the brake fluid, and changing the battery. Powered by a 749cc DOHC inline-four paired with a five-speed transmission, the motorcycle is finished in two-tone maroon and red with gold pinstriping, chrome fenders, and 10th Anniversary badges. It also features a stepped two-up seat, an electric starter, a chrome four-into-four exhaust system, a front disc brake, ComStar cast alloy wheels, and both center and side stands. This CB750K is offered at no reserve with a tool kit and a clean California title in the seller's name. http://dlvr.it/TB8Kbd Bringatrailer.com #carsofinstagram #carporn #classiccar"
