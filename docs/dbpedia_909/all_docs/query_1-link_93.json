        "text": "On May 3, 2017, auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive Plc had announced tax-free spin-off of its Powertrain Systems segment, which included its engine management systems and aftermarket operations, into a new, independent publicly traded company to be named as Delphi Technologies Plc. On December 5, 2017, Delphi Automotive Plc, renamed as Aptiv Plc (NYSE:APTV, $88.77, Market Capitalization $23.6 billion) completed the tax-free spin-off of Delphi Technologies Plc (NYSE:DLPH, $56.50, Market Capitalization $5 billion). Post separation, both companies began trading ‘Regular-Way’ on 12/5. On the first day of ‘regular-way’ trading, shares of APTV opened at $88.89 and closed at $88.77 after trading between $86.16 and $89.66. Shares of Delphi Technologies Plc opened at $51.54 and closed at $56.50 after trading between $50.01 and $57.25.\n\nDelphi Automotive (now renamed as Aptiv) shareholders received one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies Plc for every three ordinary shares of Delphi Automotive held as of the record date of 11/22. Post spin-off, Aptiv Plc will focus on segments - Electrical/Electronic Architecture (E/EA) and Electronics and Safety (E&S) while Delphi Technologies will consist of Powertrain segment, which will focus on optimizing vehicle propulsion systems by enhancing environmental effi ciency and vehicle performance.\n\nValuation and Recommendation\n\nWe value Aptiv (APTV) using 2018e SOTP EV/EBITDA methodology. Our fair value estimate of $88.00 per share (Previously: $96.00 per share) is derived by applying 11.0x 2018e EV/EBITDA multiple to Electrical/Electronic Architecture segment and 9x multiple to Electronics and Safety segment. We initiate coverage on APTV with a ‘Hold’ rating and an implied downside of 0.9% from the current market price of $88.77 as on 12/5. We arrive at valuation for Delphi Technologies Plc at $65.00 per share (Previously:$63.00) by assigning 2018e implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.2x. We initiate coverage on DLPH with a ‘Buy’ rating and an implied upside of 15% from the current market price of $56.5 as on 12/5.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nIncreasingly Complex Vehicle Architecture Bodes Well for the Company Currently, there are three (safe, green, and connected) mega-trends at play in the automotive industry which serve as the basis for the next wave of market-driven automotive technology advancement. Safe represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring; Green is about technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles; while Connected represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate the highly complex electronic world in which automotive consumers live into the cars they drive. These mega trends continue to create growth opportunities and Delphi is well positioned to provide solutions and products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles.\n\nIn the transformation to new mobility, the convergence and interdependency of the technologies provide Delphi a unique and powerful position. In addition, electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle, will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity, resulting in easier assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance. Built on the automotive megatrends, Delphi is leading the industry with first-to-market technologies and has identified a core portfolio of products that draw on its technical strengths and align with these mega-trends.\n\nThe company continues to invest in the automated driving space, and has continued to develop market-leading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software, key active safety sensing technologies and Multi-Domain Controller, which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions. Delphi is well aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space. For example, in 2016, it entered into a collaborative arrangement with Mobileye N.V. to jointly develop the Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning system, a complete turn-key fully autonomous driving platform for the OEM customers, with the goal of being production ready for 2019. As global vehicle architecture is positioned for significant change, E/EA (global leader with 25% market share, CAGR of ~6.9% vs. 3.9% for the industry) and E&S (third largest contributor to a vehicle’s curb weight) segments are benefiting from lucrative opportunities due to increase in vehicle content, software and electrification that leads to necessity of complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate.\n\nFurthermore, many OEMs are selecting suppliers who have global production, strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities. Delphi operates in 46 countries with 126 manufacturing facilities and 15 major technical centers, helping it to utilize regional services and resources effectively in turn to reduce cost per unit and increase profitability. The company has established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables it to efficiently and effectively serve global customers from low cost countries. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China. The company’s global scale and regional service model enables it to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs, which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis. The company’s footprint also enables it to adapt to the regional design variations the global OEMs require and serve the emerging market OEMs.\n\nDelphi Technologies Offers a Robust Product Portfolio Along with Strong Key Growth Market Presence\n\nThe spin-co’s product offerings satisfy the OEMs’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations related to fuel efficiency and emissions control on a global basis, and to provide additional power to support consumer-driven demand for more in-vehicle electronics. Leveraging the breadth and depth of its engineering capabilities, the company has a strong position in fuel injection systems (FIS) technologies. Its injector portfolio maximizes engine uptime and reliability which is especially important for large, long-life commercial vehicle applications. Additionally, we expect continued growth in key technologies such as Gasoline Direct Injection (GDi), variable valve timing, variable valve actuation and power electronics to meet increasing consumer demand for greater performance and power needs.\n\nLooking at the key growth markets, there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Despite these recent moderations in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other emerging markets have resulted and are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. Aided by the Company’s strong global presence, and presence in these emerging markets, DPS is positioned to experience above-market growth rates over the long-term. Furthermore, the increasing regulation in these markets (especially China) related to emissions control and fuel efficiency should enable the company to experience above market growth.\n\nPowertrain Business to Benefit from Rising Electrification in Automobiles\n\nDPS has an established product portfolio that includes powertrain technologies for gas and diesel engines, as well as hybrid and electric vehicles, which the company sells to diverse OEM and aftermarket customer base. Due to strict emission standards, automotive industry is going through a drastic transformation to use electrical energy as power source in place of fuel without affecting efficiency, performance. The number of vehicles utilizing electrification to meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards is expected to grow to approximately 25% of global vehicle production by 2025 as compared to just 4% currently.\n\nPowertrain invented new hybrid vehicle solution by using 48V electric energy to upgrade engine performance with more than 10% reduction in CO2 emission. In addition, cost of batteries is declining day by day bringing trend towards Electronic Vehicles (EV). DPS has a team of approximately 5,000 scientists, engineers and technicians across 12 major technical centers globally. With approximately 2,400 active patents and patent applications, it has a strong track record of developing technologies focused on addressing consumer demands and industry trends, including GDi, powertrain domain controllers, two-step variable valve actuation, engine control algorithms, electronics and software. The company expects the Powertrain business to grow by about 6% CAGR versus the industry, which is forecast by IHS to grow more like 2%.\n\nValuation\n\nA] Aptiv Plc\n\nWe value Delphi Automotive (Stub) using 2018e EV/EBITDA based SOTP framework to arrive at an intrinsic value of $88.00 per share. (Previously:$96 per share). Our enterprise value estimate for Electrical/Electronic Architecture (E/EA) stands at $21.1 billion based on 11.0x 2018e EV/EBITDA multiple. We believe, E/EA segment should trade to its closest peer – TE Connectivity (11.6x), given the fact that E/EA segment is market leader in Electric architecture with 25% market share and has an improving margin profile. The E/EA segment has a normalized adj. EBITDA margin of ~18%-19% as compared to its peers - TE Connectivity (~22%), Lear (11%), and Adient (~10%). We value Electronics and Safety (E&S) segment at an enterprise value of $4.9 billion by applying 9.0x 2018e EV/EBITDA multiple. There is no perfect comparable company for E&S segment. However, there are parts of companies which compete with E&S’ various sub-segments viz. Autolive (ALV), Visteon (VC) and Harman (HAR, acquired by Samsung in Nov 2016). We believe, E&S segment should trade in line with its peers (ALV: 8.4x 18e EBITDA and VC: 9.4x). We expect Net/Debt to EBITDA for Aptiv to come down to 0.8x in 2018e on account of cash contribution from Delphi Technologies Plc.\n\nB] Delphi Technologies Plc. (Spin-Off)\n\nWe value Delphi Technologies at $65.00 per share (Previously:$63 per share) based on 2018e EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.2x.
