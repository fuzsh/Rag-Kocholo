        "text": "I’d say so. I’m not sure what your intended use of the TRD OR is but I’m not afraid to take it and hit the trails. West coast has its cornucopia of options from rock crawling to high speed runs through the desert.\n\nI had it on my 2005, never had a problem when I traded it in with 210,000 miles. Don’t have it in my 2019 and I’m glad because IF it gets damaged you will probably have to replace the entire system. In the case of a car accident it may total a perfectly good truck, later down the road.\n\nYou got a special 2005 4R with KDSS?\n\nI think you had XREAS. KDSS wasn’t an option on 4R’s until 2010.\n\nJust read through these forums options are limited to how you can level or lift. If that's wrong I only know what I read, mostly on that crowded forum.\n\nAs far as feel, with test driving and now 400 miles with mine, on road crappy Chicago roads are just fine without kdss. Maybe my old arse just couldn't tell the difference..chit breaks the older one gets\n\nMy “off-roading”, if you can even call it that, is camping, driving on the beach, launching a boat, etc. I don’t plan to lift 3”+ or rock crawl. I test drive both and noticed a difference driven back to back, but probably wouldn’t have if I drove them a week apart. In the end I opted for the KDSS as I thought it made more sense for me as 90%+ of my driving will be on road.\n\nDo what I did when I test drove one with and without.\n\nFind a empty parking lot do 40 mph and go from side to side and some 20/30 mph circles you will be convinced to get one with it!\n\nI've read a lot. I also have a TRD OR w/KDSS lifted. I don't think its that limited there is a shit tons manufacturers. Now if you are talking LT and crossmember thata a different story but that also doesn't apply to the majority.\n\nKDSS would not help with potholes. On road it reduces body lean by using thicker sway bars.\n\nTo the OP- as mentioned, test drive vehicles with and without if you can. Also think about what you intend to do with the truck down the road.\n\nIf you plan on doing massive lift, and hardcore off-roading, you might not want it. If you plan on mild lift, or no lift, you might like it.\n\nEnjoy whichever you decide to buy!\n\nIt’s a little bit more than just the sway bars. The front and rear hydraulic cylinders, accumulators do the work and the thinker stabilizer bars support the addictions force applied to them. On road the hydraulic action works against itself and reduces the ability of the cylinders to compress and cause body roll. Off road, the hydraulics isn’t working against itself and allows for more wheel articulation and stability in the vehicle.\n\nI know all of that. I was just saying that the biggest difference for on-road driving is the reduced lean due to the larger sway bars. And that it wouldn't affect the handling over potholes. At least not at high speed.\n\nBut, your post explains it a lot better. And I also would not have bought one without it.\n\nMaybe I should have got it, that's daily driving on Chicago highways"
