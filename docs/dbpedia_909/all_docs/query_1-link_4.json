        "text": "8.3K\n\nAs cars evolve into rolling computers, innovations like suspensions that can independently adapt to road conditions and motors with unmatched precision are enabling new capabilities.\n\nMOZA, a developer of gimbals and sim racing equipment, is helping drive this evolution forward. Leveraging knowledge of precision haptic feedback, MOZA has ventured into technologies at the heart of modern direct drive and automobiles.\n\nSince 2018, the company has invested in the development of an active suspension system that uses independent actuators to enhance ride quality and stability, which is now being applied to emerging fields like autonomous driving. Additionally, MOZA has pioneered advanced direct drive motors, rotors, and force feedback software for the simulation market.\n\nThrough advances in material science as well as hardware and software engineering, MOZA is positioning itself at the intersection of sustainable mobility and an immersive metaverse.\n\nThe Benefits of Direct Drive Technology\n\nDirect drive systems offer significant advantages over legacy belt and gear transmissions. By directly coupling the motor to the output shaft, there is no mechanical distortion or power dispersion. This enables unparalleled torque precision and response times measured in microseconds rather than milliseconds.\n\nSpecifically, let’s look at the MOZA Direct Drive Base:\n\nLeveraging an array of proprietary innovations from advanced materials to software, MOZA direct drive bases are unlocking the full potential of this technology.\n\nTheir flagship R21, R16, and R12 servo motors generate industry-leading and sustained torque outputs of 21Nm, 16Nm, and 12Nm, respectively. Raw performance is then refined through advances in rotor design and control algorithms.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the MOZA direct drive bases:\n\nPrecision High-Torque Motive Systems\n\nMOZA’s direct-drive servo motors achieve remarkably high torque outputs through the optimization of electromagnetic and mechanical subsystems. The 12-36 pole slanted interior neodymium permanent magnet rotors feature skewed segmentation patented to minimize cogging and smooth torque delivery.\n\nPaired with aerospace-grade sensor modules and profiled copper concentrate windings, torque delivery across the entire zero to 350 RPM operating range. The unified electro-mechanical approach enables responsive precision unmatched by other equivalents.\n\nIt’s this technology that can be found in the Tesla Model S, helping the vehicle reach 60 miles an hour in under two seconds with over 1000 horsepower.\n\nCarbon Fiber Rotor Shielding\n\nTo prevent gradual performance degradation from rotor overheating, MOZA employs a carbon fiber sleeve in its high-precision direct drive simulation motors. With a tensile modulus over 70 times stronger than basic non-woven fabrics, this aerospace material maintains structural integrity across millions of high-velocity revolutions enabling sustained output required for immersive virtual racing.\n\nThe unidirectional carbon fiber laminate also exhibits low electrical conductivity, sustaining optimally uniform magnetic field geometry without distorting flux density or inducing power-sapping eddy currents like traditional metallic casings which corrupt performance. This enables dynamic precision and sustained output for immersive virtual racing experiences.\n\nThe custom carbon fiber prepreg material exhibits exceptional strength-to-weight ratios 5x stronger than steel while minimizing interference with enclosed electromagnetic components.\n\nSlanted Pole Technology\n\nIn 2021, the sim racing world saw an innovative leap with the first implementation of cutting-edge Slanted Pole Technology in motors. The patented MOZA R21 slanted pole motor technology pioneered enhanced precision direct drive capabilities, setting a new standard subsequently matched by the MOZA R16 and R12.\n\nSlanted Pole Technology, or skewed pole design, marks a deviation from the traditional uniformity prevalent in motor rotor designs. Specifically, the rotor of the MOZA R21 motor features an innovative design, segmented into irregular portions, each skewed at a precise angle. This distinctive approach to rotor structuring profoundly reduces motor cogging torque, torque ripple, electromagnetic vibration, and general noise levels.\n\nProprietary NexGen Force Feedback Firmware\n\nThe MOZA R21, R16, and R12 are notable for their robust direct drive and comprehensive software support. Simulating true-to-life road feel requires advanced real-time software control, to get there, MOZA’s NexGen Force 2.0 firmware makes use of a 280MHz processor capable of delivering more than 10,000 torque delivery parameters each second, ensures that force feedback communication is established almost simultaneously resulting in virtually zero dynamic response delay.\n\nA deterministic real-time kernel enables precise scheduling of sensor acquisition, signal processing, physics modeling, and haptic output packets within microseconds. This extreme optimization produces organic force feedback indistinguishable from a real vehicle. Accessible across all MOZA bases through convenient firmware updates, this innovation eliminates the need for hardware replacement.\n\nMulti-Stage Signal Reconciliation\n\nMapping simulated physics into haptic sensations demands extracting signals from noise. The NexGen firmware applies multi-rate digital signal processing to decode road texture and traction loss events from the vibration spectrum.\n\nMulti-stage digital signal processing isolates electrical and mechanical distortions before an adaptive filter reconciles the input data with software vehicle physics for realistic synchronized force feedback. It’s this multi-stage approach that preserves high-frequency details like lateral shifts — while still smoothing output for playability.\n\nModel Predictive Control Algorithms\n\nConverting a reconciled vibration signal into realistic haptic feedback requires physics simulation and optimization. The NexGen firmware creates a virtual vehicle model that predicts real-world behavior using sensor telemetry.\n\nA model predictive controller then calculates optimal torque signals to match the expected response, manipulating vectors in real-time like speed-variable damping and latency-free inertia effects. Players can fully customize settings ranging from basic force feedback size, damping, friction, and natural inertia to MOZA’s unique force feedback curve, road feel equalizer, speed-dependent damping, and hands-off protection.\n\nMOZA Ventures into Intelligent Driving with Active Suspension Technology Systems\n\nBuilding upon its expertise in precision electromechanical systems and immersive kinetics, MOZA recently unveiled an active suspension technology prototype for the automotive industry. This innovative system features separate electronically controlled hydraulic actuators for each wheel to enable real-time tuning of ride quality.\n\nIntegrated acceleration/position sensors paired with predictive algorithms manipulate the actuators to maximize comfort and stability. With capabilities like body roll reduction and motion sickness prevention, this dynamic chassis control platform aims to enhance safety and customize the driving experience.\n\nVehicle Suspension Systems\n\nAs vehicles evolve to actively adapt to roads rather than passively react, suspension technologies are becoming increasingly advanced. Rather than using simple springs and dampers, new systems can independently control the absorption and stiffness levels of each wheel in real-time — enabling breakthroughs in ride quality, handling, and passenger comfort.\n\nBasic suspension systems have seen relatively incremental innovation, gradually moving from fixed damping rates to manually adjustable shocks. But with the emergence of advanced materials and by-wire controls, more disruptive changes are now possible.\n\nHere are some of the types:\n\nPassive Suspensions\n\nThe most basic suspension systems use fixed-rate coil springs and passive dampers to absorb impacts. Tuned for a compromise between ride softness and handling, passive systems cannot adapt to changing road conditions or driving scenarios.\n\nSemi-Active Suspensions\n\nMore advanced semi-active suspensions employ adjustable shock absorbers capable of variably damping wheel motion. By modulating dissipation levels, they provide some real-time adaptation. However, without the ability to control stiffness independently, performance gains are limited.\n\nFully Active Suspensions\n\nThe most capable active suspension systems replace passive springs with electronic actuators that can both damp and energize wheel movement as needed. This enables completely independent fine-tuning of ride quality factors like roll, pitch, squat, and dive.\n\nAudi & Mercedes\n\nAudi’s Fully Active Electromechanical Suspension\n\nThe Audi A8 48V system, known as the fully active electromechanical suspension system, individually drives all four wheels, employing a dedicated motor for each wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz’s 48V E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL\n\nThe new Mercedes-Benz GLE introduced the 48V E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL active suspension system, offering precise control of each wheel’s damping to counteract vibrations, bounce, and compression during vehicle movement.\n\nActive suspension systems actively adapt in real-time by independently controlling each wheel’s compression and damping levels using electronic actuators. Key benefits include:\n\nRide smoothness: Ensures comfortable travel over uneven terrain through precise valve tuning.\n\nEnhanced stability: Reduces body roll, squat, dive by counteracting forces acting on chassis.\n\nMotion comfort: Alleviates motion sickness through frequency filtering and subtle adjustments.\n\nEntertainment integration: While driving, safely experience any 4D dynamic movies giving you the ultimate entertainment experience.\n\nLeveraging expertise in precision electro-mechanical systems, MOZA has developed an advanced active suspension prototype demonstrating new possibilities for digital chassis control.\n\nReal-time Actuation Subsystem\n\nAt the core of the system, separate electronically controlled hydraulic actuators for compression and damping allow totally independent control of each wheel. Paired with an array of acceleration, suspension travel, and inertial sensors, vehicle movement can be tuned in milliseconds. Currently, this innovative technology is implemented in a range of popular vehicle models weighing between 1.2 and 3.5 tons.\n\nModel Predictive Control Algorithms\n\nAdvanced physics simulations and deep reinforcement learning algorithms manipulate the wheel actuators to optimize ride feel in real-time. Whether adapting damping for off-road terrain or counteracting body roll in sharp corners, MOZA’s active architecture maximizes performance, comfort, and safety.\n\nBeyond simracing, MOZA’s digital chassis technology extends to areas such as autonomous driving, teleoperated driving, and intelligent driver training. The remote driving platform developed in collaboration with a well-known automaker was officially showcased at the 2023 Shanghai Expo.\n\nAnchoring an Era of Breakthroughs\n\nFor over a decade, MOZA has established itself as a solution provider of camera gimbals and sim racing ecosystems by pursuing engineering excellence and user-centric design. This founding DNA based on delivering ultimate realism and control carries through even as the company expands into complementary technologies.\n\nRecent R&D investments demonstrate MOZA’s commitment to continuous improvement by translating emerging mobility advances into upgraded simulation experiences.\n\nRather than diluting focus, MOZA’s parallel advancement across simulated and real-world mobility complements its mission of delivering unprecedented immersion. As transportation evolves, so too will the experiences customers demand. With the electric vehicle market expected to reach one trillion dollars, there’s only room to go up.\n\nBy cementing expertise at this intersection, MOZA ensures its continued reputation as the elite choice for both professional racers chasing that last millisecond of performance, and commuters seeking to relax as their car eases through traffic.\n\nFrom esports to self-driving cars, humans increasingly expect technology to expand possibilities. As an established pioneer, MOZA aims to anchor these new eras by contributing foundational building blocks powering revolutionary capabilities in mobility and metaverse immersion. Just as each small refinement compounds overtime in racing, so too will sustained innovation position MOZA favorably as these transformations accelerate."
