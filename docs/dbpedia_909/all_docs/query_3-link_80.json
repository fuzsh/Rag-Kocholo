It makes transportation easy. Although there have been many inventions and ongoing researches on increasing engine efficiency, there exist other opportunities to increase the comprehensive performance of vehicles. In application, various losses occur in different sections of the vehicle. They can be identified as frictional losses, losses due to air drag, losses due to vibrations, thermal losses, etc. One of the losses is the dissipation of energy by the shock absorber or suspension of a vehicle. Moving vehicles can expend a significant amount of energy in undesirable vertical motions that are induced by road bumps and much of that is dissipated in conventional shock absorbers as they dampen the vertical motions. This paper relates to an energy recovery model, more particularly, to an apparatus that uses the kinetic energy of automobile suspension and stores it in the form of electrical energy. The proposed study uses a rack and pinion mechanism to utilize the linear motion of a telescopic suspension. The arrangement works such that the linear movement of the suspension is converted to rotatory motion. The rotational mechanical energy generated by the mechanism is used to produce electrical energy by a dynamometer and is stored using a power bank. The study validates the practicality of the system and prove it to be an effective clean energy generation mechanism for future automobiles.\n\nAutomobiles have shock absorbers to damp out the vibrations and shocks generated due to roughness of the roads. However, in conventional shock absorbers energy gets dissipated through dampers in form of heat and this energy is not used or regenerated in any way. Regenerative Suspension System provides a means for recovering or regenerating the energy dissipated in conventional shock absorbers. A device which can recover this kinetic energy that relates to the vertical motion of an automobile suspension which is relative to the frame of the vehicle when it is traveling on a roadway, the device comprises of: energy conversion or regenerative means for converting the energy relating to the vertical motion of the vehicle frame relative to the vehicle suspension to a form of energy which can be stored for a later use in powering vehicle systems. Road vehicles can waste a significant amount of generated energy in undesirable vertical motions or shocks that are induced by road bumps and much of that is dissipated in conventional shock absorbers as they dampen the vertical motions. This project aims to determine the effectiveness of efficiently transforming this energy into electrical power by using an optimally designed regenerative electro-mechanical system. In advantage, the electrical power can be used to recharge batteries or other energy storage devices rather than be dissipated.\n\nModern technology has paved the way for engineers to innovate new products and services which increase the quality of life for the global population. One such problem that the global community faces today is the threat of climate change and pollution which has led to many engineers, scientists and social researchers alike working on finding solutions to vast arrays of problems in relation to global warming. The automobile and transport industry accounts for over 20% of emissions in the United States alone and as such, many emerging methods of reducing the CO2 output from vehicles are being considered. An exciting prospect is the idea of potentially harnessing energy that is usually lost through the oscillations experienced by the suspension unit that is located within all of these vehicles. This paper focuses on the feasibility of regenerative suspension systems via modelling the vibration dynamics using computer software and conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine the commercial viability of integrating such systems onto newer production vehicles. The findings of this project were largely based on the limitations of the computer code generated and its limitations have been discussed extensively. The significant conclusions of this report include the difficulty in justifying the implementation of a regenerative system on small, light vehicles due to minimal power generation, however, it did find that for larger, heavier vehicles that such a system can provide an alternative and more sustainable means of power generation. The project concludes by outlining a scope for future work regarding the efficiency of power conversion and transfer which are vital in defining the real-world functionality of such systems.\n\nThe paper presents the numerical optimization model of the energy recovery system from a suspension of a racing vehicle. The system is based on the recovery of energy lost in the classical solutions in the viscous damper. The suspension system should provide adequate comfort to a driver, while allowing recovery of the maximum amount of energy. The goal of the research is to draw general conclusions about the optimal parameters for similar systems. The parameters selection for the energy recovery system is a difficult task. For this reason, it has been decided to build a simulation model that allows the selection of the optimal parameters of the system. The fitness function of the model is the amount of energy recovered from the system. The amount of recovered energy should be as high as possible, while ensuring a good comfort for a driver, which is necessary, to recognize the result as valid. During the optimization each set of parameters has been simulated for different road profil...\n\nThe paper describes the problem of using the vehicle’s suspension as a source of an alternative energy. One of the best ways to improve the vehicle efficiency and its smooth ride is to make some rational changes in the vehicle design, one of which is to convert the mechanical energy accumulated in the vehicle’s suspension into electricity. The shock absorber in the suspension has been replaced with two different-type new recuperative devices, which replace the shock absorber and convert into electricity the loads coming from the road irregularities to pavement.\n\nThe concept of a shock absorber able to recuperate from energy chassis vibrations has been presented in the article. Energy released from such vibrations has thus far simply dissipated. The shock absorber is composed of the cylinder, the turbine and the generator. Its dimensions are close to those of hydraulic shock absorber, so the new shock absorber can be used in a typical automobile. The changes for values of dynamic parameters during operation of the new shock absorber components have been estimated using published data. The analysis of dynamics for the shock absorber operating in road conditions has been based on this data. Such analysis has allowed checking the operation correctness of the new design from both the shock absorber and the electric generator point of view. The amount potential of electric power available for recovery in the shock absorber has been estimated for typical road conditions. Such electric power can be used as a comparative parameter in the cost-effect...\n\nThe automotive industry faces huge challenge in environmental protection by reducing fossil fuels and energy consumption by developing various practical solutions in energy harvesting. The current analysis is related to the diesel engine power supply system in a passenger off-road vehicle for application of the piezoelectric energy harvesting system. Experimental tests were carried out for the three constant rotational speed values - 800, 1000 and 1500 rpm. The results pertained to operational and simulation tests of available power supply options from the engine suspension system in the vehicle, e.g. to power sensors supervising the engine’s operation or other small electrical devices in the vehicle. The simulations of output voltage were conducted by means of a nonlinear model with a resonator coupled to a piezoelectric elastic beam deformed in the magnetic field to improve the band of frequency transducing kinetic mechanic energy into electric energy."
