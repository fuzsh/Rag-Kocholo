        "text": "Hi Naeem\n\n...none of these are my projects. I'm just enjoying seeing folks experimenting with the concept! In the video imbedded in the first post the bike guys comment later in their video that they did try initially with magnet and coil, but they don't say why they abandoned this approach? Interesting then that the backpack folks also went with the dynamo spun by linkage... I actually like the magnet plus coil approach too. For your example I would swap things around and bounce the magnet in the coil so the coil wires/electrical path wouldn't need any sort of sliding etc connection, but your thought for leverage is a good one I'm sure! Maybe mount the generator at the tail end of a rear fender with some give/bounce designed into the fender... But at this point I'm not sure it would be energy \"harvesting\" replacing the energy lost in suspension or actually causing suspension to work harder... somehow requiring more energy from the batteries. I'll guess a rim or hub generator has far greater output, but at a direct cost of energy from the batteries or the riders food energy when you can't take advantage of regen or downhill gravity.\n\nCheers\n\nLock\n\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/0964-1726/19/4/045003/\n\nDesign and characterization of an electromagnetic energy harvester for vehicle suspensions\n\nLei Zuo , Brian Scully , Jurgen Shestani and Yu Zhou\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA\n\nAbstract During the everyday usage of an automobile, only 10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16% of the fuel energy is used to drive the carÃ¢â‚¬â€to overcome the resistance from road friction and air drag. One important loss is the dissipation of vibration energy by shock absorbers in the vehicle suspension under the excitation of road irregularity and vehicle acceleration or deceleration. In this paper we design, characterize and test a retrofit regenerative shock absorber which can efficiently recover the vibration energy in a compact space. Rare-earth permanent magnets and high permeable magnetic loops are used to configure a four-phase linear generator with increased efficiency and reduced weight. The finite element method is used to analyze the magnetic field and guide the design optimization. A theoretical model is created to analytically characterize the waveforms and regenerated power of the harvester at various vibration amplitudes, frequencies, equilibrium positions and design parameters. It was found that the waveform and RMS voltage of the individual coils will depend on the equilibrium position but the total energy will not. Experimental studies of a 1:2 scale prototype are conducted and the results agree very well with the theoretical predictions. Such a regenerative shock absorber will be able to harvest 16Ã¢â‚¬â€œ64 W power at 0.25Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.5 m s Ã¢Ë†â€™ 1 RMS suspension velocity.\n\nseen here:\n\nhttp://www.physorg.com/news188035494.html\n\nIn a recent study, Professor Lei Zuo, Brian Scully, Jurgen Shestani, and Yu Zhou, all mechanical engineers from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, have designed and tested a retrofit regenerative shock absorber that recovers a vehicle's vibrational energy. The researchers built a 1:2 scale prototype of the regenerative shock absorber, and demonstrated its ability to harvest 2-8 watts of power during typical driving conditions at a speed of about 45 mph. They predict that a full-scale system on a four-wheel car should be able to recover up to 256 watts under these driving conditions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“For typical driving conditions, we are predicting the ability to harvest approximately 64 watts per wheel, for a total of approximately 256 watts,Ã¢â‚¬Â Zuo told PhysOrg.com. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This value increases considerably when the system is used on irregular roads.Ã¢â‚¬Â\n\nThe purpose of the shock absorber in a vehicle's suspension system is to reduce the vehicleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vibration by dissipating the vibrational energy. About 10 years ago, researchers began looking into recovering the vibrational energy using various magnetic devices. In general, these systems work by first absorbing the kinetic energy of suspension vibration between the wheel and a sprung mass, and then converting that energy into useful electric power.\n\nZuo and his teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shock absorber consists of two tube-like components: a smaller magnetic tube slides inside a larger, hollow coil tube. The coil component is made of copper coils wound around a plastic delrin tube, while the magnetic component is made of ring-shaped magnets separated by ring-shaped magnetically permeable spacers. The magnets are aligned with like-poles facing each other to produce a radially emitted magnetic flux. The magnetic tube is also surrounded by a high magnetically permeable material in order to further Ã¢â‚¬Å“pullÃ¢â‚¬Â the magnetic flux outward. As Zuo explained, having a high magnetic flux is key to the design.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The power we regenerate is proportional to the square of the magnetic flux across the coils,Ã¢â‚¬Â he said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Therefore, if we increase the flux by two times, the peak power output will increase by four times.Ã¢â‚¬Â\n\nI suggest review of Piezoelectricity\n\nWhen you speak into a phone you are using Piezoelectricity to transfer mechanical-acoustical energy into low-current voltage that is transferred from Point-A to -B. Vehicle dampening could follow a similar sort of function instead of converting the mechanical energy into into waste-heat during the compression of the medium albeit air or hydraulic fluid. The challenge is to size a piezo-device or devices to respond within the desired frequency range.\n\nA second method is to employ a small air-turbine wherein the shock-absorbing piston pumps air into a small register that feeds a small turbine-generator.\n\nA third method could be a rack and pinion setup wherein the rack provides the mechanical pump action to a forward-clutched momentum wheel that in turn drives a generator.\n\nIn all piezo-devices have the least moving parts.\n\nWhat is fascinating is the scale upon which these principles can be applied. Imagine the power that can be harvested from a skyscraper swaying in the wind through motion-dampening!\n\nKingfish said:\n\nI suggest review of Piezoelectricity\n\nWhen you speak into a phone you are using Piezoelectricity to transfer mechanical-acoustical energy into low-current voltage that is transferred from Point-A to -B.
