My buddy came to me this week and asked if I would help him find a GX470. He loved the LX470 I drove and wanted something just like it but a little smaller. The GX seemed like the perfect answer. He wanted 4WD and a V8 with under 150k and a clean title on the GX. There is about a 1/2 dozen in my area that meet his requirements and we will check them out this week. First off, I need to know what the KDSS is? I see that everywhere on here but didn't find a description of it. I also have a few more questions. Is the v8 the same 4.7 that came in the 4th gen 4Runners? Do these all come with the AHC system like the LX470? Timing belt every 90K? Head Gasket issues? Any other areas of concern I should be looking for when I go to look at one? I know the obvious stuff like oil leaks, exhaust leaks, rust, damage, hard shifting, engine knock, etc. etc. I just want to know if there are common issues specific to the GX470 that I wouldn't think to look for.\n\nLast edited: Aug 22, 2017\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 2, 2015\n\nThreads\n\n19\n\nMessages\n\n578\n\nLocation\n\nNortheast Florida\n\nAug 22, 2017\n\n#2\n\nKDSS is a hydraulically controlled anti-roll bar \"performance enhancer\"...adds complexity, but increases flex.\n\nSame 4.7 in the 4Runner, yes.

Was awesome when it worked but horrible when it failed. Good to know it's just air bags and easy to yank and swap out with springs. So the front suspension on all GX's has no adjustability?\n\nLast edited: Aug 22, 2017\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 2, 2015\n\nThreads\n\n19\n\nMessages\n\n578\n\nLocation\n\nNortheast Florida\n\nAug 22, 2017\n\n#7\n\nNo front height control/adjustment...\n\nThere is a \"sport\" mode for the shocks (electronically controlled)...but that system will be rendered useless with any aftermarket shock (no real loss there).\n\n- Brian\n\nbhicks\n\nJoined\n\nMay 1, 2012\n\nThreads\n\n173\n\nMessages\n\n4,123\n\nLocation\n\nKentucky\n\nAug 22, 2017\n\nThread starter\n\n#8\n\nNo front height control/adjustment...\n\nThere is a \"sport\" mode for the shocks (electronically controlled)...but that system will be rendered useless with any aftermarket shock (no real loss there).\n\n- Brian\n\nSo there is no weight on the front shocks? The AHC carries a large amount of weight of the vehicle in the shocks. If you simply replace the shocks you also have to replace the TBars from a non AHC 100 that has the much beefier bars that hold 100% of the weight. The AHC bars hold maybe 2/3rds of the weight while the AHC holds the rest. Same logic applies to the rear coils springs. They are pathetic and totally useless when the AHC fails.\n\nLast edited: Aug 22, 2017\n\nbhicks\n\nJoined\n\nMay 1, 2012\n\nThreads\n\n173\n\nMessages\n\n4,123\n\nLocation\n\nKentucky\n\nAug 22, 2017\n\nThread starter\n\n#9\n\nGoing back to the KDSS topic; how would I know if the system is not functional?

I'm assuming it's the same reason why we avoid the Nav in the 100 series world which is no option for aftermarket stereo with Nav?

If you are planning on removing sway bar(s) during your modification process (e.g. going long travel), skip the KDSS option. If you are planning to retain your sway bars, having KDSS provides you the best of both worlds with superior performance both on and off road as opposed to traditional sway bars.\n\nbhicks\n\nJoined\n\nMay 1, 2012\n\nThreads\n\n173\n\nMessages\n\n4,123\n\nLocation\n\nKentucky\n\nAug 23, 2017\n\nThread starter\n\n#17\n\nYou can lift a KDSS truck too.\n\nKDSS provides superior articulation off road (RTI score goes from 428 to 519) and superior handling on road (more info).\n\nThere was a time where getting sliders and skids for KDSS trucks was difficult or impossible, but there are bolt-on options available now.

His plan for the GX is to be a daily driver for his wife and kids. He currently has a 2002 3rd Gen 4Runner that is his personal daily driver and weekend mild wheeler. I think it has a 2\"-3\" lift and 32's. He seems fully content with that set up.\n\nJoined\n\nMay 11, 2016\n\nThreads\n\n49\n\nMessages\n\n495\n\nLocation\n\nAustin, TX\n\nAug 23, 2017\n\n#18\n\nKDSS basically is a large sway bar underneath the car that stays tight during hard corning on pavement to minimize bodyroll. On off road, it can detach to allow greater wheel articulation. Youtube has great videos on the topic. I have a gx470 without it and depending on what you do for lift wise you will be limited with it on because the bars will make it hard to fit larger tires in the front.\n\nMy gx470 i have 285/70/17 with no KDSS and 2 inch lift. My 200 series has kdss and it's challenging to find the right build with it due to tire limitations....\n\nalia176\n\nJoined\n\nAug 21, 2003\n\nThreads\n\n800\n\nMessages\n\n15,644\n\nLocation\n\nTijeras, NM\n\nAug 24, 2017\n\n#19\n\nSo, the KDSS is an \"active\" system since there are fault codes associated with it? For some reason, I thought it was a passive system."
