        "text": "About Us\n\nToday’s EVs with conventional motors and conventional suspension are too heavy relative to the payload they carry, they require larger and heavier batteries that cost more and take longer to charge. Shifting the transmission into the wheels like Hyundai’s Uni-Wheel, or moving the motor into the wheel like conventional hub motors, adds un-sprung mass that require adding 10X more sprung mass to maintain proper stability and comfort, making the EV even heavier and more expensive. That’s why light EVs have meant sacrificing space, stability, and comfort due to the physics of passive suspension systems.\n\nThe world’s first and only road sensing SmartWheels™\n\nIndigo has invented the world’s first and only road sensing SmartWheels™ that makes light efficient EVs feel incredibly smooth and stable, yet more roomy and affordable, by changing the vehicle architecture. Indigo’s SmartWheels™ motors fit into each wheel to free up more cabin space, while providing two degrees of freedom controlled by sophisticated software, for an amazingly smooth and agile ride experience, with unmatched rider ergonomics and unit economics. Indigo’s light commercial EVs will help fleets and drivers lower their total-cost-of-ownership while meeting their sustainable goals.\n\nIndigo is the only EV Tech OEM making road sensing SmartWheels™ EVs with roomier, smoother and safer rides for people and fleets, at a price they can afford. We are building a whole new class of ultra-efficient EVs designed from the wheels up for rideshare & delivery to start, then for consumer and autonomous. Indigo EVs have the largest interior space, smoothest and best ride quality, and lowest cost-per-mile of any vehicle in its class enabled by its patented breakthrough SmartWheels™. Indigo is working with fleets, TNCs, and Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS) companies, to proliferate sustainable, desirable and affordable transportation for all.\n\nMeet Our Management Team\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nChief Commercial Officer\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\nVP of Product Management\n\nVP of Software\n\nSVP Vehicle Engineering and Purchasing\n\nBoard of Directors and Advisors\n\nWill Graylin – Chairman\n\nCEO of OV Loop & Indigo\n\nFormer Global Co-GM at Samsung Pay\n\nBoard of Directors at Synchrony Financial\n\nJim Phillips – Vice Chairman\n\nFormer Chairman/Executive Director – FedEx Institute of Technology\n\nFormer Executive of iPIX Corp., Telular, Motorola, Skytel, Nortel\n\nMember of the American Council on Competitiveness\n\nMark Norman – Board of Directors\n\nManaging Partner – First Move Capital\n\nFormer CEO – Chrysler Canada\n\nFormer President – ZipCar\n\nDr. Horst Glaser – Board of Advisors\n\nFormer CTO – Audi\n\nIan Hunter – Board of Directors\n\nChief Inventor at Indigo\n\nProfessor of Mechanical Engineering and Thermodynamics at MIT\n\nGeneral Motors R&D Academic Research Fellow\n\nGeorge Wallner – Board of Advisors\n\nCTO of OV Loop\n\nFormer CTO of LoopPay and Samsung Pay\n\nFounder and CEO of Hypercom\n\nPhil Van Wormer – Board of Advisors\n\nCo-Founder & CCO of Avadain, Inc.\n\nFormer Indigo CCO\n\nExecutive roles at DuPont, GE Capital TIP, APL Logistics, TotalTrax, and ev Transportation Services\n\nPeter Hazlehurst – Board of Advisors\n\nCEO and Advisor to multiple FinTech, mobile payment and marketplace companies\n\nFormer General Manager of Uber Money\n\nHarry Campbell – Board of Advisors\n\nOwner and blogger of The Rideshare Guy\n\nFollowed by hundreds of thousands of monthly viewers and gig drivers\n\nBran Ferren – Board of Advisors\n\nChief Creative Officer of Applied Minds\n\nFormer President of R&D for The Walt Disney Company\n\nLeadership Interviews\n\nPlay Video\n\nCareers\n\nAt Indigo, we think big, and we work hard in nontraditional ways to make the impossible possible.
