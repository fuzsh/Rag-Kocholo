By utilizing synthetically the Lagrange theory and Newton-Euler equation, the forward and inverse dynamics model was modeled in the Cartesian coordinate system. Finally by using the Matlab software, the differential equation of manipulator's inverse dynamic model which was rewritten in the form of state space was solved.",
