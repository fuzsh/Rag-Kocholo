        "text": "The three main objectives that a suspension system of an automobile must satisfy are ride comfort, vehicle handling and suspension working space. Ride comfort is directly related to the vehicle acceleration experienced by the driver and the passengers. Lesser vertical acceleration, higher is the level of comfort. The aim of the Project was to design and analyze the semi active suspension system models using skyhook, ground hook and hybrid control for quarter car. The project work includes modeling of semi-active suspension system in MATLAB simulink, using 2 degree of freedom quarter car model. The skyhook on-off, ground hook and hybrid control strategies were designed using control laws stated in literatures. Simulated results have been compared with passive system for time response analysis of body vertical displacement and vertical displacement of quarter car. Simulation was carried out for various road conditions such as random road excitation, road bump excitation, step input etc. The simulated results for quarter car model are shows similar trends and within range when compared with reference research paper.\n\nWith the increasing demand of the drive safety and ride comfort of vehicles, various new technologies are being applied in vehicle suspension system. In this case, the magneto-rheological damper can adjust the damping dynamically, and fuzzy logic controller development to track the desired damping force is possible. The combination of two will effectively improve the suspension performance. Thereafter, a model built in Simulink is composed by road model, quarter vehicle model, Magneto Rheological damper model based on Bouc Wen model, damper coil current controller model and Fuzzy logical controller to track the desired damping force. The results obtained from road models have been used in combined simulation model. Finally, the comparative simulation experiments of passive suspension and semi-active suspension with magneto rheological damper was performed. The results show that, the ride comfort of quarter car model has been improved 10% compared to passive suspension; and vehicle stability 30% respectively.\n\nVehicle suspension design many time's leads in a compromise between the flagging de- mands of riding comfort and road holding. To overcome this challenge new technologies and smart materials need to be installed in vehicle dynamic systems to improve the suspen- sion performance. This paper describes firstly the smart material (magneto rheological fluid) which can change the viscosity due to the magnetic field applied on it, this fluid is suitable for making shock absorbers which can react on different vibrations in few time less than ten milliseconds. To control the damping force of MR damper, two controllers have been designed and built in Simulink: a fuzzy logic controller and damper controller to track the desired damping force. To perform the simulation a 7 degree of freedom for vehicle dynamic model and road model was designed in CarSim software; a co-simulation model of vehicle and controller was constructed in Simulink. Finally, the comparative simulation experiments of passive suspension and semi-active suspension with magneto rheological damper was performed. The results demonstrate that, the ride comfort has been improved more than 35 % compared to passive suspension and the road handling evaluation indica- tors were improved 22 %. In summary, magneto rheological damper can effectively im- prove vehicle ride comfort and road handle\n\nIn this paper, the performance of automotive ride comfort using Bouc-Wen type magneto-rheological (MR) fluid damper is studied using a two degree of freedom quarter car model. The sliding mode control is used to force the MR damper to follow the dynamics of ideal sky-hock model. The model is tested on two excitations, the first is a road hump with severe peak amplitude and the second is a statistical random road. The results are generated and presented in time and frequency domains using Matlab/Simulink software. Comparison with the fully active, ideal semi-active and conventional passive suspension systems are given as a root mean square values. Simulation results, for the designed controller , show that with the controllable MR damper has a significant improvement for the vehicle road holding then its lateral stability as well as road damage in comparison with passive, fully active and ideal semi-active suspension systems .\n\nIn this paper, the development of a novel semiactive suspension control of quarter car model using fuzzy logic based controller has been done. The proposed quarter car model can be described as a nonlinear two degrees of freedom system, which is subject to system disturbances from different road profiles. In order to implement the suspension system experimentally, the magneto rheological (MR) fluid has been used as adjustable damper. The MR damper is a control device that consists of a hydraulic cylinder filled with magnetically polarizable particles suspended in a liquid. The MR dampers rapidly dissipate vibration by absorbing energy. In this work, a proportional integral derivative, a fuzzy logic and hybrid controllers are used to control the semi-active car suspension system. Results show that both fuzzy logic and hybrid controllers are quite suitable to eliminate road disturbances to the suspension system considerably as compared to the conventional PID controller.\n\nThe conventional contact type brake system which uses a hydraulic system has many problems such as time delay response due to pressure build-up, brake pad wear due to contact movement, bulky size, and low braking performance in a high speed region. As vehicle speed increases, a more powerful brake system is required to ensure vehicle safely and its reliability. In this work, a contact less brake system using a magnetorheological is proposed to overcome the problems. A magnetic fluid changes its properties (viscosity) under the influence of an external magnetic field. This effect is the result of changes in the fluid structure: the ferromagnetic particles of the fluid, being single domains, when subjected to an external magnetic field, become orientated and concentrated along the lines of forces of the magnetic Field. The design of the electromechanical converters mentioned above permits the space between the casing and the moving component of the converter to be filled with the magnetorheological fluid. A coil supplied with power is placed on the moving component of the converter or inside the casing, depending magnetorheological fluid enable to change the parameters of a mechanic system (rigidity, braking force) as a result of electric voltage and current control.\n\nAbstract: Vibration is the mechanical oscillations of an object about an equilibrium point. Vibration occurs in most machines, structures and dynamic systems leading to many undesirable consequences. Vibration damping system of an automobile not only supports the vehicle body, engine and passengers but also absorbs shocks arising from irregularities of the road. In this paper, the mathematical model for the passive and active damping systems for quarter car model was obtained. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) Control technique was implemented to the active damping system for a quarter car model. Computer simulation using MATLAB/Simulinks software was performed to verify the efficiency of the active damping with the application of the LQR controller. Comparison between passive and active damping system was performed by using two types of road profiles. Profile 1 is assumed to have 3 bumbs and profile 2 is assumed to have a bumb and a hole. The study gave a control scheme for force control in an active vehicle suspension design using LQR Controller with a quarter car model for random input. The steady state of suspension travel, wheel deflection, body displacement, and the car body acceleration was fast. Other controllers can also be used with the same or different parameters.\n\nThe suspension system reduces the effect of vibration caused by the road and driving conditions. Leading automotive companies have started to use intelligent suspensions in their high-end automobiles'. But much m When travelling, vehicles experience dynamic excitations of varying magnitudes. Such excitations could lead to induced vibration or noise, which affect the vehicles' integrity and occupants. A prominent method of vibration isolation in vehicular system is the suspension system. The main objective of a car suspension system is to improve the ride comfort without compromising the ride handling characteristic. Over recent years, the massive developments in actuators, sensors and microelectronics technology have made the intelligent suspension systems more feasible to implement in automobile industry. These systems are designed and fabricated in such a way that they are able to reduce the drivers' and passengers' exposure to harmful vertical acceleration. The quarter-car suspension model is the best benchmark to study and analyze the dynamic behavior of vehicle vertical isolation properties. This paper presents background information and a description of the quarter-car suspension model which can be used to evaluate the performance of intelligent suspension system.\n\nThe objective of this paper is to focus on the studies in field of automobile suspension system control strategies and the methods that were used to evaluate the optimal values for the suspension system parameters such as spring stiffness, damper damping coefficient, tire stiffness, tire damping coefficient. There are many types of controllers to improve the vibration control of automobile suspension system when undergoes to external excitation from road profile, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), linear quadratic regulation (LQR), H infinity , robust control and Fuzzy controller. And there are three methods of suspension system strategies; passive system, active system and semi-active system. The semi active control included; magneto rheological damper and electro rheological damper, in this case; the effective area in which the oil damping flowing through was varied according to road disturbance. This study concluded that using PID, LQR, H infinity and Fuzzy controller which had been improved the performance of suspension system strongly, especially, the improvement in the time of steady state response whereas by using of PID and Fuzzy controllers led to decrease the time of steady state response and reduced the maximum overshoot. It can be concluded that using Simulink program to solve the equation of motion of quarter automobile suspension system is very important due to complexity of solving by traditional methods which used to solve these cases."
