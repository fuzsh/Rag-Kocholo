        "text": "Damper Basics - The function of a shock absorber\n\nA shock absorbers job is to subside vibrations caused by the wheels, axles, and body. So the technically correct name for it would be a vibration damper. When driving over irregularities, the created shock or vibrations are absorbed by the suspension.\n\nThe spring wants to absorb and release stored energy. In a short sequence of these repetitive processes, a vibration arises. These movements are transmitted via the piston rod to the shock absorber. Here the kinetic energy is converted to heat by hydraulic resistance in the shock absorber valve and reduces the vibrations to an inaudible minimum.\n\nThe shock absorbers used in vehicles are usually twin-tube dampers or mono-tube dampers. A piston moves in an oil-filled cylinder in both damper types. The piston forces the oil through the valves, which creates resistance to the oil flow with the help of various holes and orifices.\n\nWhen a car deflects while driving, the oil which is slightly under pressure, will be displaced by the immersion of the piston rod. It flows into the outer tube through the bottom valve (compression valve) which controls the flow speed. During rebound, the oil flows from the outer tube back into the inner tube. In addition to the channels in the bottom valve, the oil also has to flow through the rebound valve located at the piston rod, to get into the piston housing.\n\nOur KW twin-tube dampers, which we manufacture directly in Germany, are gas-hydraulic or low-gas pressure vibration dampers. During production, we put the damper fluid or damper oil under pressure with up to five bar nitrogen. For this reason, one speaks of a low gas pressure vibration damper. This damper technology, which has also been tried and tested by KW in the aftermarket, is used as original equipment in over 90% of modern vehicles.\n\nThe suspension damper converts the kinetic energy of the suspension spring into thermal energy and radiates it to the environment. If a curve is driven, the KW coilover kit works in the inside of the curve of the vehicle in the rebound stage and the KW damper on the outside of the curve in the compression stage.\n\nHow does the pressure level affect?\n\nWith various KW coilovers (V3, V4, CS, ...) it is also possible to individually adjust the basic setup of the bottom valve via the pressure level click setting. The pressure level regulates the speed of the piston rod when it is immersed. It has a direct effect on the body roll movements and the steering behavior.\n\nIf the pressure stage valves are opened, the pressure stage is reduced and the vehicle plunges faster when the steering wheel is turned. If the pressure level is increased, the piston rod plunges more slowly and the more stable the vehicle is when it comes to steering movements. The steering behavior becomes more precise, the more the pressure level is adjusted. With some KW coilovers (V4, CS 3-way, ...) the pressure level can also be set separately in the low and high speed range.\n\nOur modular sealing system exceeds OEM standards. It can be opened easily and allows customized adjustments of the valve technology or rod / piston stroke by an aluminium nut\n\nHigh tensile aluminum nut\n\nSelf-lubricated special NBR sealing\n\nClamping sleeve\n\nO-ring made of temperature-resistant viton\n\nGuide bushing with bleed hole\n\nSpecial coated DU plain bearing\n\nSmall increment rebound spacers"
