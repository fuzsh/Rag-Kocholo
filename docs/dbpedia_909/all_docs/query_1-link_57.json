        "text": "Initiatives\n\nPrimary Safety\n\nSUBARU’s predecessor was an aircraft manufacturer. With aircraft, it is necessary to pursue “accident-free vehicle” design, as even a slight error in operation or judgment can cause a severe accident. Inheriting the philosophy of safety, SUBARU focuses on the primary design such as surface and operation, thereby we pursue clear, useful, and comfortable space where the driver can concentrate on driving easily.\n\nVisibility Optimized for Every Condition\n\nEarly detection of danger can help avoid accidents. SUBARU has concentrated efforts on minimizing blind spots and improving visibility even under difficult conditions such as driving in rain or at night.\n\nOptimal Driving Position\n\nOptimal driving position allows drivers to move naturally, reducing fatigue and helping to improve safety and comfort while driving. It also helps the driver to steer the car precisely for taking evasive action when the risk of an accident occurs. SUBARU’s cockpit is designed to be adjusted so that every driver can find their optimal driving position.\n\nIntuitive Interface\n\nDrivers can sometimes have a lapse in concentration when checking the navigation screen or adjusting the air conditioning. To prevent this from happening, SUBARU has designed an interface layout that is easy to use. For example, the navigation screen is placed so that the driver does not need to shift their line of vision too far, while the air-conditioning system and audio controls use switches that allow for intuitive operation so that drivers do not have to take their eyes off the road.\n\nTechnology: Primary Safety (Japanese version only)\n\nActive Safety\n\nFor SUBARU, “driving” means more than simply delivering enjoyment. It is an important factor in increasing safety.\n\nTo make it possible to avoid the situation safely if an accident occurs. To be able to drive safely in various weather conditions and road surfaces, the same way as during normal conditions. SUBARU has fine-tuned all the basic functions of a vehicle—driving, turning, and stopping—to develop vehicles that offer exceptional stability and predictable control in the most challenging conditions, which makes cars safer and more trustworthy.\n\nDriving Stability\n\nOn the foundation of outstanding core performance, SUBARU tempers the body and suspension of its vehicles along with employing vehicle control devices that increase drivability, creating stable driving that provides peace of mind to drivers and passengers.\n\nLine Traceability\n\nImagine being able to drive into a slippery corner on a snowy or rainy day without unpredictable car movement, turn exactly as intended through the corner, and head out of the corner smoothly. SUBARU includes a number of functions that make smooth cornering a reality.\n\nBraking Performance\n\nBraking performance is directly related to a car’s safety, particularly its hazard avoidance capabilities. SUBARU goes beyond polishing such performance, also placing great focus on peace of mind. Brakes that provide peace of mind work as predicted every time. SUBARU repeatedly tests in all environments and on all road surfaces in our quest to deliver brakes that are easy to operate regardless of weather and that react quickly at the critical moment.\n\nTechnology: Active Safety (Japanese version only)\n\nPreventive Safety\n\nOur ultimate goal is to eliminate traffic accidents. To achieve this goal, SUBARU has spent more than 20 years developing driver assistance systems. The inexpensive and highly practical EyeSight has become widespread in markets around the world, pioneering advanced safety technology. In 2020, EyeSight was reborn to help aid our goal of zero fatal traffic accidents in 2030.\n\nEyeSight Core Technology\n\nWe have revamped our stereo cameras at the core of EyeSight’s driver assistance. In this upgraded system, viewing angles are wider and image recognition is improved, giving it better-than-ever capabilities to distinguish cars, pedestrians, road lines, and other elements while driving. Thanks to improved control performance, driving SUBARU cars is now smoother and safer than ever before. Furthermore, with these new stereo cameras as a core driver and combined with four radar sensors on the front and rear of the vehicle, plus rear sonar, our system can monitor the car’s entire surroundings. This offers support to drivers in a greater variety of situations and a higher level of safety. Beginning with the Levorg in FYE March 2021, we have expanded the lineup of vehicles equipped with this technology, including the WRX, Outback, and Forester in FYE March 2022, and the Crosstrek and new Impreza in FYE March 2023.\n\nCollision Avoidance Support\n\nOur new stereo cameras greatly expand the usable scope of pre-crash braking. It protects drivers and passengers in tense situations on the road, like oncoming vehicles, crossing pedestrians, or crossing bicycles during a turn, or vehicles approaching from the front. Approximately 40% of vehicle-to-vehicle accidents occur in situations like these. We believe our system significantly mitigates these traffic accidents.\n\nTo further improve our collision avoidance performance, we have newly adopted a wide-angle single-lens camera in the Outback, Ascent, Crosstrek, and new Impreza. Utilizing an even broader field of view than the new stereo camera, the wide-angle single-lens camera enables collision avoidance and reduces the potential for harm in scenarios involving head-on encounters with cyclists and incidents involving pedestrians. The system will be incorporated in the Levorg, WRX, and Levorg Layback in FYE March 2024.\n\nThe EyeSight system will also be equipped in the BRZ manual transmission model in FYE March 2024. By offering high-performance collision avoidance assistance to a broader range of customers, we have taken a significant step toward achieving zero fatal traffic accidents in 2030.\n\nReducing Operating Burden\n\nSUBARU believes that reducing operating burden leads to greater safety.\n\nIn 2020, EyeSight X was born, an evolutionary advance from our EyeSight system. This new system combines high-precision 3D maps and satellite positional data to recognize road conditions well ahead of the vehicle, beyond the detection range of stereo cameras and radar. These high-precision 3D maps constitute an important element technology at the heart of next-generation driver assistance. SUBARU was one of the first among automotive companies to apply this technology and bring it to market. It helps reduce driver burden especially on long hauls, offering a luxurious touring experience. It does this through a variety of features, including speed control at optimal levels just before curves and toll booths, active lane change assistance, and assistance during traffic congestion, including hands-off and start-and-stop support. Our ongoing efforts to expand the integration of the EyeSight X system include its implementation across all grades of the Outback for the Japanese market in FYE March 2022 and for all grades of the Levorg, WRX, and Levorg Layback, also for Japan, in FYE March 2024. We are committed to offering comfortable transportation to a wider range of customers.\n\nSupport for Safe Driving\n\nWe are also expanding the implementation of the Driver Emergency Support System to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. If the driver’s hands come off the steering wheel for a long time while Active Lane Keep is engaged, or when the system detects a distracted or drowsy driver while hands-off congestion driving assistance is active, it will warn the user. If the driver does not move the steering wheel even after the warning, the system determines that an emergency situation is underway, activating hazard lights and the car horn to inform nearby vehicles of the situation and gradually slowing the vehicle to a stop. Introduced for the first time in the Levorg released for the Japanese market in FYE March 2021, this system was also incorporated into the WRX and Outback for Japan in FYE March 2022.\n\nThe Crosstrek and new Impreza for the Japanese market are equipped with features that are integrated with SUBARU STARLINK. When the Driver Emergency Support System is activated, it automatically connects to a call center, allowing for quicker response in an emergency.\n\nImproving Visibility\n\nWe have enhanced our Multi-View Monitor reducing the size of blind spots around the vehicle. Synthesizing digital camera footage from front, rear, left, and right perspectives allows for a comprehensive view of the vehicle’s surroundings on a single screen. The perspective can also be changed to a top-down view and a 3D view that allows the driver to check the surroundings when entering and exiting the vehicle, effectively minimizing the driver’s blind spots to nearly zero. The Crosstrek and the new Impreza come equipped with this technology, and starting from FYE March 2024, the Levorg, WRX, and Levorg Layback for the Japanese market will also feature it.\n\nTechnology: Preventive Safety (Japanese version only)\n\nPassive Safety\n\nSince the time of “SUBARU 360,” when we started mass production, SUBARU has positioned safety as one basic function that cars should have. Also, we have been performing our own original damage mitigation tests that include protecting pedestrians since the 1960s—a time before thinking regarding damage mitigation had yet to be fully instilled. SUBARU’s damage mitigation functions take into consideration not only the driver and passengers, but also pedestrians as well as the possibility of harm to the occupants of other vehicles. They have received high evaluations both in Japan and around the world.\n\nNew Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frame\n\nSUBARU has a uniquely safe body design. In the cabin, the pillar and frame combine to form a “cage.” The purpose of this is to protect from deformation regardless of the angle from which the vehicle is struck. A relatively crushable zone is provided to disperse and absorb the shock of a powerful impact. This gives SUBARU vehicles high collision absorption performance against impacts from any direction.\n\nFront-end/Rear-end Collisions\n\nEven small components can become as deadly as weapons when receiving the powerful force of a collision. Based on that fact, SUBARU equips its vehicles with a horizontally-opposed engine, which has the advantage of being able to effectively absorb the energy from a collision. During a front-end collision, not only can it easily slip under the floor, but the frame that absorbs the shock can extend symmetrically as well as straight. Each component of the cabin is made of shock-absorbing materials in order to protect lives.\n\nSide Collisions/Rollovers\n\nTo protect the driver and passengers during a side collision, an extremely rigid side door beam is installed in the door. In addition to that, the new high-rigidity Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frame protects the cabin space during a collision or rollover. Furthermore, several kinds of airbags and energy-absorbing materials line the entire car, protecting every person inside the cabin.\n\nProtecting Pedestrians\n\nSUBARU strives to protect not only our drivers and passengers but also pedestrians.\n\nFor example, our horizontally-opposed engines have a wide energy absorption space between the front hood and engine unit. This reduces damage from being struck by the top of the hood, which is a highly probable head injury for pedestrians. Furthermore, our cars are designed to absorb the shock from components such as the hinge and hood stay. SUBARU’s four safety areas, which take into consideration all forms of safety, can be found in all of our designs and initiatives, and have been carried over to our BEV. As an example, we were the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to install pedestrian protection airbags, which have now been equipped in six models.\n\nTechnology: Passive Safety (Japanese version only)\n\nConnected Safety\n\nWe use connection technology and data based on SUBARU’s four safety areas of Primary Safety, Active Safety, Preventive Safety, and Passive Safety, and develop new technologies and services to further pursue safety. Our vehicles feature the Advanced Automatic Collision Notification (AACN) system. In the event of a collision that triggers the airbags, it automatically connects to a call center and coordinates with the police, emergency services, and medical institutions, aiding in more speedy rescue activities. In addition, SUBARU’s mass market car models are equipped with the Driver Monitoring System, which attentively watches over the state of the driver. It detects when the driver looks away or shows signs of sleepiness, and sends an alert. Going forward, we will couple it with various controls.\n\nCar Assessments\n\nSUBARU undergoes safety performance testing and assessment of public organizations in and out of Japan including JNCAP in Japan, IIHS*1 in the U.S., and Euro NCAP*2 in Europe, and has gained the highest rank of assessment in most of them.\n\nIn FYE March 2023, the Solterra won the JNCAP Five Star Vehicle Safety Performance 2022 Award, the highest rating in the JNCAP. At the IIHS, as of May 2023, three of SUBARU’s 2023MY (model year) vehicles had won the organization’s 2023 TOP SAFETY PICK+ (TSP+) Award, and two vehicles had won its 2023 TSP Award. In addition, the Legacy, Outback, Ascent, Forester, WRX, BRZ, and Solterra received the highest rating of “Good” in the IIHS Seat Belt Reminder evaluation test, a program launched in March 2022. Euro NCAP gave the Solterra a five-star rating in its 2022 assessment.\n\n*1\n\nIIHS: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\n\n*2\n\nEuro NCAP: European New Car Assessment Programme, a safety information disclosure program for automobiles in Europe.\n\nFYE March 2023 Commendations\n\nAssessed Automobiles Assessment Organization Assessment Solterra\n\nJNCAP, Japan Vehicle Safety Performance\n\nJNCAP Five Star Award 2022 2023 models of the Outback, Ascent, Solterra (built after October 2022)\n\n(U.S.-specification models only)\n\nIIHS, U.S. 2023 TSP+ Award* 2023 models of the Legacy and Forester\n\n(U.S.-specification models only)\n\nIIHS, U.S. 2023 TSP Award* Solterra\n\nEuro NCAP, Europe 2022 Five-star rating\n\n*\n\nIn the IIHS’ s publication of vehicle safety information, the TOP SAFETY PICK (TSP) Award is given to vehicles that earned the rating of “Good” in the original moderate front overlap test and small overlap tests (driver- and passenger-side), and the rating of “Acceptable” or higher in the updated side crash test and headlight evaluation (standard equipment), as well as the rating of “Advanced” or higher in the daytime vehicle-to-pedestrian crash prevention test. In addition to these ratings, vehicles that earned the rating of “Good” in the updated side crash test and “Advanced” or higher in the nighttime vehicle-to-pedestrian crash prevention test are awarded the TOP SAFETY PICK+ (TSP+) Award.\n\nSafety Is Our DNA\n\nSince its founding, the core of the SUBARU Group, an organization with roots in the aircraft industry, has been to put people first and to engage in people-oriented manufacturing. We believe that safety is the most critical basic function for cars. Since the launch of SUBARU 360 more than half a century ago, we have passed this belief on as an element of our company DNA, making relentless efforts in every era to perfect the most essential functions of a car—driving, turning, and stopping—reflected in our unique engineering know-how, including all-around safety performance. Looking to the future, SUBARU will continue to engage in automotive manufacturing with a philosophy of “All-Around Safety” and maximum emphasis on safety performance.\n\nThe technology that makes SUBARU different: enjoyment and peace of mind: enjoyment and peace of mind\n\nSINCE 1917\n\nEnsuring Safety for Pilots\n\nOur DNA of Safety is Inherited from Aircraft Development\n\nAt the core of SUBARU’s safety development expertise lie traits acquired from developing aircrafts. With aircraft, the implementation of ideas and countermeasures within the vehicle’s basic structure prevents the onset of danger. One indispensable safety feature of aircrafts is the ability for the pilot to be able to secure an all-around unobstructed line of sight. This approach to safety has not diminished even after SUBARU moved into automobile manufacturing.\n\nSINCE 1960\n\nEnsuring Safety for Drivers\n\nGoing ahead of the Times: Developing a Vehicle Body for Collision Safety Based on All-Around Safety\n\nSUBARU 360 had played an important role in expanding the popularization of automobiles during the period of high economic development. SUBARU has dedicated itself to developing vehicle bodies for collision safety following the principle of All-Around Safety–effectively absorbing shock from collisions in all directions and protecting the driver and passengers with a cabin structure of robust strength–since that period. SUBARU pushed forward independent research on car body structure and how it affects human body, and pursued superior collision safety technologies ahead of the times.\n\nSINCE 1970\n\nEnsuring Safe Driving, Turning, and Braking\n\nDeveloping Proprietary Technologies for Enhanced Driving Safety\n\nFundamental automobile performance in terms of driving, turning, and braking differs significantly depending on the location of the center of gravity and the type of drive train. A low center of gravity and a drive train that delivers power to all of the wheels give constant stability when driving.\n\nIn 1966, we launched the SUBARU 1000—a FWD vehicle with a horizontally-opposed engine—and, in 1972, the 4WD SUBARU Leone. Since that time, SUBARU has continued to pursue safe and stable driving performance with our proprietary technologies.\n\nIN THE 1980s & 1990s\n\nEnsuring Safety for Drivers and Passengers\n\nLegacy Launched. Development of Driving Assistance Systems\n\nOur flagship Legacy model set a world speed record in January 1989 for 100,000 km of continuous driving, demonstrating both reliable driving performance and mechanical endurance. Furthermore, SUBARU commercialized Active Driving Assist (ADA), a driving assistance system using stereo cameras which was the predecessor of our current EyeSight technology.\n\nIN THE 2000s & 2010s\n\nEnsuring Safety for Everyone\n\nCommercialized EyeSight\n\nMaking the Latest Advanced Safety Features Standard Equipment on All Vehicles\n\nSUBARU commercialized our EyeSight technology, featuring stereo cameras constantly surveying the area forward of the vehicle and warnings and pre-crash braking functions for mitigating damage from accidents. In 2017, we began fitting vehicles with the new Touring Assist function, extending the minimum speed at which Lane Keep Assist can operate from 60 km/h to 0 km/h.\n\nMoving forward, SUBARU is engaging in development for even more leading-edge technologies.\n\nThe SUBARU Global Platform\n\nAchieving new levels of both comfort and maneuverability\n\nThe SUBARU Global Platform has brought about driving dynamics lending enjoyment to operating its vehicles. This has been achieved by top-class passive safety performance recognized by global safety assessments, as well as driving quality achieving new levels of comfort and maneuverability and top-class vibration reduction thanks to stability, as well as low noise.\n\nFROM THE 2020s\n\nNext-Generation EyeSight, EyeSight X\n\nEvolutionary innovation in EyeSight\n\nThe next-generation EyeSight system enables 360-degree sensor capabilities from the wide-angle stereo camera and four radar units located at the front and rear of the vehicle. This contributes to safe driving in an even wider range of situations, like encounters with vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles at intersections with poor visibility and when turning left or right. Stereo cameras, which can measure distance in the same way as the human eye, can distinguish between vehicles, pedestrians, and road lines. The system boasts high recognition performance with its wide viewing angle and viewing distance. The software, which functions as the “brain” of the system, takes this information and the state of the vehicle’s operation to determine the necessary controls, executing these in a manner that fits the situation, supporting safe driving with peace of mind and comfort. Furthermore, EyeSight X achieves a new dimension of advanced safety technology with its newly developed system utilizing the QZSS “Michibiki” satellite system, GPS, and high-precision map data. Starting with the 2022 release of the Crosstrek, the addition of an ultra-wide-angle single-lens camera significantly reduces blind spots while driving. With EyeSight functioning as a third eye, this development takes another step toward a future of zero fatal traffic accidents.\n\nFurthermore, in 2020 we established the AI development hub, SUBARU Lab, in Shibuya, Tokyo, where we are actively engaged in research and development to enhance safety by integrating the judgment capability of AI into stereo camera technology.\n\nEyeSight Performance\n\nCumulative global sales of vehicles equipped with EyeSight reached five million units*1 in June 2022.\n\nWith the superior recognition capabilities of its stereo camera technology, EyeSight has consistently been awarded top safety ratings by independent agencies from Japan, the U.S., Europe and other places and has contributed to strengthening SUBARU’s preventive safety performance over the years. A study by SUBARU based on data from Japan’s Institute for Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis (ITARDA) has revealed the accident rate of EyeSight-equipped vehicles is as low as 0.06% in Japan*2 while a study conducted by Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has found the system reduces rear-end crashes with injuries by up to 85% in the U.S.*3\n\n*1\n\nBased on 2021 global sales. Excludes OEM vehicles from other companies.\n\n*2\n\nCalculated by SUBARU based on the number of SUBARU vehicles equipped with EyeSight (ver.3) sold from 2014 through 2018 (456,944 units) and ITARDA data (259 rear-end crashes).\n\n*3\n\nBased on IIHS reporting data as of January 2017 from MY2013-2015 SUBARU models equipped with EyeSight through 2014 in the United States.\n\nFROM THE 2020s\n\nEvolution of the SUBARU Global Platform\n\nEvolving ourselves to the next stage, in pursuit of our ideals\n\nIn order to bring the performance of the SUBARU Global Platform to an even higher level, we have adopted new full inner frame construction technology to enhance rigidity across the entire body. This has dramatically improved body rigidity.\n\nFollowing the philosophy of the SUBARU Global Platform, we have adopted the newly designed the EV-dedicated platform, e-SUBARU Global Platform, starting from the 2022 release of the Solterra. Based on a chassis with a symmetrical layout, we have integrated SUBARU's expertise into components such as suspension and electric power steering. This approach ensures that from the moment it sets into motion, everyone can experience SUBARU's unique agile and comfortable driving feel, providing \"Enjoyment and Peace of Mind\" in our BEV.\n\nGoing forward, we are also working to evolve the very basis of our vehicles, that being the platform that leads to all kinds of performance improvements, such as driving performance, comfort, and passive safety."
