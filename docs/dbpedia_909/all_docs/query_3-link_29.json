        "text": "The Nauti-Craft technology is a hydraulic suspension system for multihulled vessels, designed by Nauti-Craft Dunsborough, in Western Australia.\n\nOur team drew inspiration from the suspension systems of cars and off-road vehicles.\n\nThe marine suspension system separates the boat’s hulls from the superstructure.\n\nThis allows the hulls to react rapidly to wave inputs and conform to the ocean surface without transmitting high forces and accelerations of the hulls to the deck and superstructure.\n\nWhy Suspension Boats?\n\nIt’s all about safety, economics and the environment. Even mildly rough conditions can cause injuries, fatigue and sickness, and more fuel is consumed due to increased resistance caused by the waves.\n\nNauti-Crafts Marine suspension enables a vessel to maintain higher speed while reducing impacts by up to 80%.\n\nIn a commercial application, a Nauti-Craft enabled vessel is able to drive down capex and the overall environmental footprint because in some applications, a Nauti-Craft enabled vessel can be significantly smaller than a standard vessel but can carry out an equivalent service."
