        "text": "New Terra Exterior Color for TRD Pro\n\n2024 4Runner Available in 2WD or 4WD, with Seating for up to Seven\n\nAll 2024 4Runner Feature Standard Blind Spot Monitor + Rear Cross Traffic Alert\n\nToyota Safety Sense (TSS-P) Standard on All Grades\n\nPLANO, Texas (Oct. 3, 2023) – With over 40 years of sales under its belt, the Toyota 4Runner has carved out a special place in the SUV segment. 4Runner is at home whether on pavement or the trail. For 2024, the 4Runner TRD Pro receives an all-new exclusive color, Terra. This new earth tone paint will help you feel at home on any adventure. Another color, Underground makes its 4Runner debut for 2024 as well.\n\nWith room for up to seven, the fifth-generation 4Runner remains the most capable of its proud family tree, and it is also the most accommodating and most comfortable.\n\n4Runner grades for 2024 include the SR5, SR5 Premium, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium, Limited and TRD Pro.\n\nThe burly 4Runner TRD Pro offers standard Multi-Terrain Monitor. Using strategically placed cameras, the system lets the driver check surroundings on the trail, with the ability to spot potential obstacles not easily seen from the cabin. The Limited grade has a standard Panoramic View Monitor, which provides a similar function for checking surroundings when maneuvering the vehicle in tight spaces.\n\nRoad-Hugging TRD Sport\n\nThe 4Runner TRD Sport grade joins 4Runner TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro models in the line. Where the latter two add trail-ready equipment and features designed for tackling tough terrain, the TRD Sport sharpens its road-focused manners with sophisticated chassis technology while adding style and flair. The result is an exceptional combination of style and performance in a full-capability SUV. With an emphasis on everyday comfort and road dynamics, the 2024 4Runner TRD Sport adds the Cross-Linked Relative Absorber System (X-REAS) suspension to enhance on-road handling.\n\nToyota Safety Sense P Standard for All\n\nAll 2024 4Runner models come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), a suite of driver-assist technologies that includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.\n\nThe Ready-for-Adventure SUV\n\n4Runner’s inherent strength starts with its tough-as-nails, body-on-frame construction featuring a solid rear axle with four-link coil rear suspension with lateral rod and stabilizer bar, with the Limited grade and new TRD Sport also adding X-REAS to their suspension features. The robust chassis is also the foundation of 4Runner’s comfortable ride quality.\n\nA 270-horsepower DOHC 4.0-liter V6 engine with 278 lb.-ft. of peak torque gives 4Runner plenty of get-up-and-go. The engine’s Dual Independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps optimize torque across the engine’s operating range responsiveness in a variety of driving conditions. All models can tow a maximum of 5,000 pounds, with a maximum 500-pound tongue weight.\n\nExclusive to the 4Runner Limited, a full-time 4WD system uses a Torsen center differential with locking feature and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The system employs a 40:60 torque split in most driving situations and alters that in response to slippage. In addition, if the front wheels are slipping while the vehicle is turning, the Torsen® differential changes the split to 30:70. If the rear wheels slip while the vehicle is turning, the split changes to 53:47.\n\nMaximum Capability\n\nThe 4Runner TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro models are equipped with an electronic-locking rear differential and Toyota’s Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature. The latter helps maintain a constant speed in low-speed, off-road situations, enhancing vehicle control when driving up, over or down obstacles. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and braking force to slowly move the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable, low-speed settings. This function allows the driver to focus on steering without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal in challenging terrain.\n\nAs trail conditions change, the driver can adapt to the amount of traction using the standard Multi-Terrain Select system using a dial to choose a mode that matches prevailing surface conditions. The system will then adjust wheel slip control accordingly.\n\nTRD Pro Earns Its Name\n\nThe TRD Pro badge on any Toyota truck or SUV signifies the most off-road-capable vehicle in its respective line. For 2024, it will be offered in the unique color of Terra. Black TRD alloy flow-form wheels are equipped with Nitto Terra Grappler tires, and specially tuned Fox internal bypass shocks and TRD-tuned coil springs yield an inch of front lift for improved trail-tackling capability.\n\nThe rear Fox shocks feature piggyback-style remote reservoirs to maintain damping performance over demanding off-road terrain. Delivering the best of both worlds, the shock tuning improves trail driving isolation and high-speed performance without compromising on-road comfort and steering response. Like other Toyota TRD Pro vehicles, the 4Runner TRD Pro features a 1/4-inch-thick aluminum front skid plate with red TRD lettering. The TRD roof rack is exclusive to 4Runner.\n\nInside, the TRD Pro features HVAC controls like the one found in the Limited grade, plus a standard moonroof and Premium Audio with JBL speakers featuring Clari-Fi™ technology.\n\nOn and Off-Road Suspension\n\nFor even greater off-road prowess, the TRD Off-Road grade can be equipped with Toyota’s optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which allows extended wheel travel at slow speeds for greater off-road capability and control. The KDSS system hydraulically adjusts the lean resistance provided by the stabilizer bars. Sway resistance is reduced for off-road driving to help minimize any tendency for wheel lift. On pavement, KDSS enables the bars to work conventionally, reducing body lean to enhance agility and control."
