        "text": "TRANSFORMATION\n\nFROM TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURER TO\n\nMODERN EV COMPANY\n\nA heritage which started in the professional taxi trade has seen us build vehicles with an unrivalled blend of performance, functionality and craftsmanship.\n\nOur name has changed over time, but the core principles at the heart of our vehicles remain unchanged: purpose-built to withstand the demands of the job, focused on reliability and the best occupant experience.\n\nBacked by the renowned Geely Group and enriched with the knowledge from our past, we continue to innovate with purposeful engineering at the heart of all our vehicles.\n\n2020\n\nNEW DECADE, NEW SECTOR\n\nLEVC launches the first in a line of new commercial electric vehicles.\n\nVN5 stands ready to revolutionise the medium-sized van sector. Powered by eCity technology, it is the perfect solution in green logistics, featuring astonishing durability, great carrying capacity, a total electrically-driven range of more than 300 miles – made possible by the range-extender.\n\nA RECORD-BREAKING YEAR\n\nLEVC celebrated a record sales year, thanks to month-on-month growth in 2019, delivering an impressive 2,507 sales of its electric TX model and more than doubling the volume of the previous year.\n\nThe TX has not only proved successful in London but across the UK and overseas too, with growing demand from taxi operators and ride-sharing shuttle services in Germany, France, Switzerland, Denmark, Middle East and Japan.\n\nNEW MARKETS\n\nBased on the electric taxi and featuring the same eCity technology, TX Shuttle was launched. It offers mobility and shuttle services the opportunity to specify the vehicle to their own unique needs, building features as required for their business use. This makes TX Shuttle ideal for on-demand public transport and taxi services across Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nA ROYAL VISIT\n\nLEVC proudly hosted HRH The Prince of Wales, who learned about our new company and vision, before embarking upon a tour of the factory.\n\nPrince Charles took his time meeting apprentices and senior operatives, who explained the precise engineering and controls which occur throughout our entire production process. HRH was pleased to see young people being encouraged to pursue manufacturing as a career option through our apprenticeship schemes.\n\nIn the main reception, staff gathered to watch as HRH unveiled a unique plaque commemorating the Royal visit.\n\nA TRANSFORMATIONAL YEAR\n\nLEVC’s new global headquarters opened in Ansty, Coventry in 2017. Standing alone as the UK’s only dedicated electric vehicle manufacturing plant, it represents an investment of more than £500m.\n\nHousing a research and development centre, as well as manufacturing, quality and testing facilities, it also stands as a centre of competence for lightweight aluminium production, and EV technology, within the Geely Commercial Vehicles Group.\n\n2017\n\nNEW NAME & LOGO SIGNAL GLOBAL AMBITIONS\n\nEvolution becomes revolution. LEVC – the London EV Company is born; a name which respects our heritage and dedicates our future to new energy vehicles.\n\nLEVC embark upon a journey to design, develop and produce the next generation of green commercial vehicles, starting with an all-new taxi; followed by an ambitious commercial vehicle strategy, which seeks to create a seamless portfolio of electric vehicles for markets across the world.\n\nGEELY CHAIRMAN MEETS BRITISH PRIME MINISTER\n\nThen Prime Minister David Cameron met with Chairman Li in Shanghai during a state visit to China.\n\nMr Cameron and Chairman Li’s discussion focused on the company’s production, global sales and future development plans.\n\n2013\n\nA COMMITMENT TO THE UK\n\n2013 saw the company change ownership. Geely – which already owned 20% of the black cab maker – acquired the business and the principal assets from MBH.\n\nThe year saw further investment, with significant improvements to the manufacturing facilities in Coventry and the creation of approximately 66 new jobs. Geely Group Chairman Li Shufu and Business Secretary Vince Cable were present to officially start of production, commencing the build of new TX4 models.\n\n2007\n\nTHE NEW-GEN\n\nIntroduced in 2007, the TX4 featured a more efficient engine, updated design and new suspension. It was Euro 4 compliant and evolved to become Euro 5 and 6 compliant as these regulation were introduced.\n\nIn November 2010 the name Mann & Overton was removed and the company name is changed to the London Taxi Company (LTC).\n\n2002\n\nTHE UPDATE\n\nTXII was Euro 2 compliant and incorporated a Ford engine in order to meet the emissions standards of the time.\n\nImprovements included a passive anti-theft system, fully integrated into the engine management system, and full width glass in the rear doors, which had restricted opening to reduce the possibility of passengers who wanted to avoid paying their fare by escaping through the window.\n\n1997\n\nTHE NEW KID\n\nThe first new generation taxi in almost 40 years is introduced, TX1.\n\nThe TXI name was intended as a play on the word taxi, while the ‘1’ denoted compliance with the Euro 1 emissions standard.\n\nThe vehicle took just 28 months to design and put into production, bringing saloon car standards of comfort, safety and refinement to the driver’s working environment.\n\n1989\n\nTHE CLASSIC\n\nManganese Bronze Holdings (MBH) acquires Carbodies in 1972, then acquires Mann & Overton and forms London Taxis International (LTI) in 1985.\n\nWhen production of the Austin diesel engine ceased, Carbodies introduced a new Nissan diesel engine and released the Fairway in 1989.\n\nThe Fairway was the best-selling version of the FX4, and was the first vehicle produced by LTI to feature built-in wheelchair accessibility – in the form of a fully retractable wheelchair ramp.\n\nTo this day it is the vehicle which many still think of as ‘The’ London taxi.\n\n1948\n\nTHE ORIGINAL\n\nMann & Overton commission Austin Motor Company to design and build a new taxi chassis, the FX.\n\nAustin arrange with coach building company Carbodies to build the cab with an all-steel body.\n\nMann & Overton, Austin and Carbodies sign a deal to make the taxi at Carbodies’ factory in Coventry, with cabs sold around the country.\n\nAffordable, durable and reliable, it was an immediate success. The origin of the expression ‘black cab’ began with the introduction of the third iteration of the FX, the FX3 taxi cab, which launched in 1948.\n\n1908\n\nTHE BEGINNING\n\nTaxicab dealers JJ Mann and Tom Overton import vehicles to Britain for sale into the London cab trade. In 1908 the two commissioned a special model cab which was specially designed to meet the new London regulations, the Conditions of Fitness. It is to this model that LEVC can trace its roots. By 1914 it was the most common taxi on London’s streets."
