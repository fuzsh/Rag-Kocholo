        "text": "Automotive Suspension System Market Overview\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Market Size was valued at USD 58.13 billion in 2023. The Automotive Suspension System market is projected to grow USD 89.21 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.80% during the forecast period (2024 - 2032). Increased safety regulations,introduction of innovative suspension systems, and rising demand for commercial and passenger vehiclesare the key market drivers enhancing the market growth.\n\nSource: Secondary Research, Primary Research, MRFR Database, and Analyst Review\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Market Trends\n\nIncreased safety regulations are driving the market growth\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we live and travel in cities, as well as in society as a whole. It is believed that a new way of life would arise. Governments worldwide have required that public transit and ride-sharing firms limit the number of passengers per car, citing social separation as the strongest defense against COVID-19. People appear hesitant to use public transportation as their reliance on personal mobility continues to rise as nations 'unlock,' and businesses reopen in various countries. The necessity for personal mobility is anticipated to rise as customers seek to ensure their own safety. Although other external causes drove this increase in the past, as the demand for social separation and preventative measures grows, these numbers will continue to rise. This factor drives the market CAGR.\n\nAdditionally, the automotive suspension system market mainly relies on manufacturing and selling automobiles. As a result, fluctuations in automotive demand have an impact on the market. The market for automotive suspension systems is fueled by rising demand for sedans, SUVs, and off-road vehicles. To reduce the high cost of production of these systems, the Chinese and Indian governments are investing in the aftermarket through direct engagement with tier 1 suppliers. The presence of automotive suspension manufacturers in the aftermarket, such as ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Dorman Products, is projected to boost demand for advanced suspension systems.\n\nFurthermore, the automotive suspension system market is expected to be driven by the European Union's reviving automotive industry. Sales were held back by limited inventory and fewer incentives during the pandemic, but the relaxation in the lockdown is expected to boost the automotive market growth. Thus, the rising demand for commercial and passenger vehicles is expected to drive the Automotive Suspension System Market revenuegrowth during the forecast period.\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Market Segment Insights\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Insights\n\nThe Automotive Suspension System Market segmentation, based on suspension systems, includes active suspension systems, semi-active suspension systems, and passive suspension systems. The passive suspension system segment is expected to have the highest CAGR and dominate the market share during the forecast period. A passive suspension system is machine-driven and relies on dampers and coil springs to work. This suspension system is comparable to the semi-active one, but the damping coefficient and constant spring values differ. The properties of the components (springs and dampers) are fixed in a passive suspension system.\n\nAutomotive Suspension System damping type Insights\n\nBased on damping type, the Automotive Suspension System Market segmentation includes hydraulic, electromagnetic. The hydraulic segment is expected to have the highest CAGR and dominate the market share during the forecast period. In the global automotive industry, hydraulic damper suspension systems are widely employed. This device not only provides self-leveling and height adjustment capabilities but also aids in increasing a vehicle's aerodynamic performance when traveling at high speeds.\n\nFigure1: Global Automotive Suspension System Market, by Damping Type, 2022&2032(USD billion)\n\nSource: Secondary Research, Primary Research, MRFR Database, and Analyst Review\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Vehicle Type Insights\n\nThe Automotive Suspension System Market segmentation, based on vehicle type, includes passenger, commercial, electric, and Two-wheelers. The passenger cars segment is expected to have the highest CAGR and dominate the market share during the forecast period. A passenger automobile is a road vehicle designed to transport passengers and has a maximum seating capacity of nine people. If the total number of seats is less than ten, microcars, taxis, and other hired passenger cars are included in the term passenger car.\n\nDecember 2020 loan launched two new faucet and soap dispenser pairings that are part of its Clark and Rush Street Collections. Its new pairings of sensor-operated faucets and soap dispensers provide hygienic, touch-free solutions.\n\nMay 2020 REE Automotive (REE) and KYB Corporation (KYB) announced a strategic partnership to develop suspension capabilities for future electric vehicle (EV) platforms. As an automotive Tier 1 supplier, KYB Corporation's unparalleled semi-active and active suspension systems will boost REE's next-generation EV platform, which delivers complete design freedom and cost-effective, scalable solutions in e-mobility.\n\nAutomotive Suspension System Sales Channel Insights\n\nBased on sales channels, the Automotive Suspension System Market segmentation includes OEM and Aftermarket. The OEM segment is expected to have the highest CAGR and dominate the market share during the forecast period. This is due to the increasing demand for advanced suspension systems in commercial vehicles and passenger cars.\n\nOctober 2022: GMC is set to provide customers with good news, waiting for a more affordable, smaller electric truck from the brand, and it comes in the form of the all-new 2024 GMC Sierra EV.

Indeed, there is still a high level of demand for the Panamera with a combustion engine. Although Porsche refers to this as a new vehicle, the third generation is not entirely new. Nevertheless, notable modifications have been implemented to the chassis, including the introduction of a completely redesigned suspension system. Additionally, the vehicle now features powerful hybrid engines, and both the inside and exterior have undergone comprehensive updates. According to Porsche experts, the significant advancement of this new model lies in its ability to simultaneously provide improved levels of dynamic performance and enhanced levels of dynamic comfort. Furthermore, it is abundantly filled with cutting-edge technology, designed to cater to the needs of luxury car consumers, and possesses the necessary capabilities to provide an exceptional driving experience. Although the car's low-slung silhouette remains identical to the previous model, the most noticeable feature are the headlights, which resemble the eyes of a frog. This wide intake is positioned both above and below the bumper line, contributing to the Panamera's distinctive new appearance. Equally intriguing are the vertical blades positioned behind the headlights, which effectively manipulate the airflow.\n\nIn March 2024, Li Auto revealed that the 2024 versions of the L7 and L8 will incorporate continuous damping control (CDC) sports suspension systems, following the naming convention of the Air models. The L7 would be priced at RMB 301,800 (USD 42,000) and the L8 at RMB 321,800 (USD 44,760). Both new models are slated to be released in May of this year and will commence delivery. Concurrently, modifications will be implemented to the 2024 L7 and L8 model series, changing their designations from Air, Pro, and Max to Pro, Max, and Ultra, correspondingly. The designation of the 2024 L9 Max will be changed to L9 Ultra to reflect the adjustment. According to insiders at Li Auto, during the preparation for the upgraded models last year, the CDC suspension configuration was already adjusted to achieve a greater price reduction without causing a major decrease in the brand's value. Despite Li Auto's updated setups and major improvements, their prices are not competitive in the current market when automotive manufacturers are generally adding features and cutting prices for new cars.\n\nFebruary 2021 Magneti Marelli SpA expanded its suspension products range with the addition of air suspension.
