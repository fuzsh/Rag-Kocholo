        "text": "[348 Pages Report] The global automotive suspension market size was valued at USD 45.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach USD 51.6 billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 2.6% during the forecast period 2022-2027.The demand for automotive suspension is driven by the increase in demand for vehicle comfort and safety and the increasing adoption of air suspension systems in HCVs.\n\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, Request for Free Sample Report\n\nThe most likely scenario taken into consideration is the gradual resumption of production volumes around the globe, wherein global vehicle sales are recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. As the lockdowns are lifted, challenges related to the supply chain, availability of labor, and preventive guidelines from the governments will be reduced. In this scenario, the automotive suspension market is to have a moderate impact and will witness steady growth.\n\nMarket Dynamics\n\nDriver: Growing sales of SUVs and luxury vehicles to drive demand for advanced suspension systems\n\nThe adoption of independent suspensions has increased over the years owing to various advantages offered by them. The growth can be attributed to independent suspensions offering more stability to vehicles. The weight of an independent suspension type is less, which makes it a preferred choice for heavy vehicles. Passenger cars generally employ an independent suspension at the front and a dependent suspension at the rear wheel. Hence, both independent and dependent suspensions are required. MacPherson strut is one of the most preferred front independent suspensions in compact passenger cars. Low manufacturing costs and better stability are attributed to the growth of the MacPherson suspension system. A double wishbone is another type of independent suspension, which provides superior comfort, dynamics, and road holding. However, as the production cost of the double wishbone is higher, it is generally used in premium models, such as Alfa Romeo, Toyota Tundra, MG Rover TF, Honda Accord, and Aston Martin DB7. The double wishbone suspension is also employed in high-performance racing cars owing to its design complexity and increased number of parts, such as joints and bearings. However, with technological advancements, mid-high segment vehicles such as Toyota Camry, Fortuner, and Honda Accord have opted for the double wishbone.\n\nRestraint: Lack of standardization of independent suspension systems\n\nThe standardization of suspension systems with respect to vehicle type, is expected to reduce the overall manufacturing cost which will help Tier 1 and component manufacturers produce suspension systems in large volumes as there would be specific suspension types for each model. OEMs and suspension suppliers during the supply contract negotiations can establish standardization for independent suspension with respect to significant parameters which could offer a win-win situation to both of the parties. Manufacturers have to keep track of the preferences in different countries due to a lack of standardization in order to remain competitive in the market. Change in preference or implementation of new regulation, causes manufacturers to change their investment strategy, which makes the market volatile for them. This also immediately affect component suppliers as they are reliant on demand from tier 1 suppliers. Hence, the lack of standardization has caused manufacturers to face challenges in catering to diverse architecture demands of different vehicle types and restrain the automotive suspension market.\n\nOpportunities: Growth in ATV sales due to increased off-road recreational activities globally to drive ATV suspension market\n\nAll-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are four or more than four-wheeled motorized vehicles that are primarily used for off-road activities but can also be used for on-road activities. Almost all ATVs employ a suspension system as it is one of the very crucial functional components of the vehicles, which encounter all sorts of rugged and difficult terrains. Rising GDP and growing disposable incomes globally have led to increased spending on leisure activities. The overall increase in the tourism industry revenue was owed to the fact that there was a 4% increase in tourist arrivals across the world in tourist locations in 2019. This created a lot of demand for these ATVs pre-pandemic and, as tourism resumes post-pandemic, the demand is expected to continue. Recreational activities offered by tourist spots globally have increased alongside off-road competitions involving ATVs. ATV championships, like the World Off-Road Championship Series (WORCS) held in the US, with off-terrain vehicles in challenging conditions are organized by sports authorities at national levels. These factors have resulted in high demand for ATVs and driven the sales figures. Some of the major ATV players and their top-selling models are Polaris (RZR, Ranger, Sportsman), Textron (Alterra TRV, Wildcat, Prowler), Yamaha (Grizzly, Kodiak, YXZ, Wolverine, Viking), Honda (Fourtrax, Talon, Pioneer), and Kawasaki (Brute Force, KFX, Mule, Teryx).\n\nChallenges: Lack of alternative materials poses challenge for overall suspension weight reduction\n\nIt is predicted that future transportation will be dominated by autonomous, connected, electric, and shared (ACES) vehicles, altering the way consumers interact with vehicles. A lightweight vehicle is seen by automakers as a core aspect of sustainable mobility, improving both fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Electrification of automotive vehicles poses additional challenges since the batteries or added electrical components make them heavier than the conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Since EVs are typically 125% heavier than ICE equivalents, due to the accommodation of heavy battery packs, there is an increasing emphasis to reduce overall vehicle weight to increase the driving range from a single complete battery charge. For electric vehicles, a reducing weight by 10% generally amounts to a 13.7% increase in driving range. While the lighweighting objective, in both ICEs and EVs, is somewhat similar, the architecture differences affect the approach as well as the scope for lightweight in EVs. The requirement to accomodate a large, heavy battery pack at the bottom of the vehicle and the want to use one platform for multiple vehicles will force the automotive industry back the the design table for the frame arrangement for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). This has called for a need for alternative materials to replace existing heavy material components in suspension modules.\n\nSome of the advances have been seen in the use of composites to replace parts and components traditionally manufactured from steel. Carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and Glass-fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) have great potential to reduce the weight of light-duty vehicles. Back in 2014, Audi introduced GFRP suspension springs in an effort to reduce weight. The lightweight springs, constructed from a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer composite enabled a weight saving of 2.5 kilograms per spring, and a 40 percent reduction compared with steel springs. An technological advance was made in 2015 by Volvo by the introduction of new leaf springs for their XC90 model. These springs were replacing the traditional steel springs used and were manufactured from a glass-fiber reinforced composite material. This led to a reduction of weight by 4.5 kilos. Safety is paramount in vehicles and any changes made in designs must be resilient to adhere to current and future crash safety regulations. Cost of production is also an important factor, and while processes are continuously improving,, the challenge remains in terms of cost-effective mass production. These examples do provide a glimpse of potential future advancements in material technology. But limited options for suspension components’ material selection, the high cost of such materials (such as carbon fiber), and production processes still pose a huge challenge for suspension manufacturers when it comes to reducing the overall module weight.\n\nActive suspension - the fastest growing suspension system type\n\nThe growing demand to improve ride quality and occupant comfort is a significant factor driving the market for active suspension systems. The high-end luxury & sports cars and some medium-range cars with few commercial vehicles mainly use active suspension systems. The active system incurs a high cost but is the most advanced and comfortable suspension system. The active systems are available under various brand names, such as Magic Body Control by Mercedes-Benz, MagneRide by Delphi, and PASM Porsche Active Suspension Management by Porsche. The SUV demand is estimated to increase year on year by 3.3 % from 2020 to 2022. The Asia-Pacific market has shown a larger growth in SUVs, where the region has 58.5% of SUVs in 2021. Considering the increase in demand for SUVs, the demand for active suspension is expected to grow globally, and Asia would be the leading market.\n\nMacPherson strut holds the largest market share for front wheel suspension\n\nMacPherson strut eliminates the need for a separate upper control arm, which reduces the cost of components and the weight of the architecture. This advantage offered by the architecture has made the adoption of this architecture widely accepted by OEMs globally. In terms of value, Asia Pacific will be the largest and fastest-growing market for MacPherson strut over the forecast period. The market growth in this region is attributed to the high penetration of the MacPherson strut in the front suspension, which is ~70-75%. The low cost and limited space required for the installation of this architecture make it a preferred choice for compact passenger cars, which have a high demand in the Asia Pacific. Models such as Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, BMW X5, and Subaru XV, among others, are equipped with front axle Macpherson strut.\n\nAsia Pacific region to dominate the global automotive suspension market\n\nThe Asia Pacific has emerged as a hub for automotive production in recent years, owing to changing consumer preferences, increasing per capita income of the middle-class population, and cost advantages for OEMs. The Asia Pacific is estimated to account for the largest share of the automotive suspension market, by value, in 2022, due to the presence of automotive OEMs with large vehicle production capacity, higher vehicle sales, and a large customer base. Increasing demand for better comfort in passenger cars has led to the adoption of multilink and air suspension systems in western countries. However, due to their high cost, these systems are still in their introductory phase in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nChina is estimated to remain the largest market within the region, owing to its large population and increased demand for passenger vehicles post-pandemic. The country has resumed production close to pre-pandemic levels. By value, India is expected to be the fasted-growing market due to the increased demand for passenger vehicles as the country’s economy recovers from the effects of the pandemic.\n\nAsia pacific: automotive suspension market\n\nTo know about the assumptions considered for the study, download the pdf brochure\n\nKey Market Players\n\nThe automotive suspension market is dominated by global players and comprises several regional players as well.

This means that workshops can now use new parts that are installed as standard when repairing such systems.\n\nIn March 2021, ThyssenKrupp planned to expand its presence in China. The new damper production line in China is being built at an existing ThyssenKrupp automotive site in Changzhou. The plant will produce electronically adjustable damping systems. These semi-active dampers use sensors to measure vibrations throughout the journey and recognize the driving situation and condition of the vehicle\n\nIn August 2020, ZF Commercial Vehicle Control Systems division in India designed air suspension with Electronically Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) technology to address issues including higher fuel consumption, decreased rider comfort, passenger safety, and vehicular instability.\n\nIn September 2020, Continental AG developed sensors for vehicles with air suspension, which uses ultrasound to measure the height and pressure of air springs in order to determine the axle’s load condition. A height sensor also has been developed for shock absorbers for vehicles without air suspension. The suspension travel of the shock absorber provides information on the load condition of the respective axle.\n\nIn January 2019, Tenneco Inc. completed its acquisition of Öhlins Racing A.B, a Swedish technology company that develops premium suspension systems and components for the automotive and motorsport industries.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ):\n\nWhat is the market size of the automotive suspension?\n\nThe global automotive suspension market is expected to grow from USD 45.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 51.6 billion in 2027, at a CAGR of 2.6% during the forecast period.\n\nWho are the top key players in the automotive suspension market?\n\nThe automotive suspension market is dominated by global players and comprises several regional players as well.
