        "text": "I’m sure it’s been asked multiple times but I’m not seeing a response for all my questions\n\nlooking to upgrade to a 2023 4Runner ORP and trying to decide if I should go with KDSS or not. I know that it supposedly makes handling and articulation better but also makes for a slightly rougher ride? My other question is it harder/more expensive to lift? And when does the infamous “KDSS lean” come into play?\n\nCan you make a NON-KDSS 4 runner handle the same, as a KDSS 4R, on and off road with an aftermarket suspension?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks in advance.\n\nThat was my dilemma before I purchased my 4R and I agree with your opinion. It all depends what you want to do with your vehicle. Daily driver and some off-road - KDSS. Pleasure only, slight offroading only type of vehicle but very often - no KDSS. I mean, many 4R owners will have various opinions or some owners of other vehicles like Lexus of FJ will be able to tell you more from their experience. Go online and do research based on scientific data, like this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ueshf401B0k. Some guys REALLY DO KNOW what they are talking about.\n\nAnd me? Honestly I purchased whatever there was available. You cant be too picky these days. I did not want to have a safe in my under armrest but I had to accept that. I didnt want the SR5 premium, not enough for me. TRD OFF road premium good choice and I was thinking about it but I knew I would not get any other suspension that what is on trd pro as do not intend to do rock crawling and stuff. And I did not want to wait next 5 weeks for it. Boy, this stuff is endless....... Good Luck\n\nFortunately for me there’s still a steady flow of them in my area with 5 TRD ORP with KDSS headed our way in various colors over the next month or so. So availability is ok. And I’d rather hold out to get what I want.\n\nAs for use and intentions, it will primarily be a DD for my wife as I use it for “fun weekend trips” and eventual overlanding once it’s paid off and she gets the mom cruiser she actually wants\n\nI only plan to lift it 2.5-3” but do the lifts for KDSS cost more/have issues/etc.?\n\nAgain, thanks for your help guys. I really appreciate it.\n\nThis is my preferred way. Non KDSS with suspension mod. For me personally non KDSS has more benefit. But KDSS has more front flex and less body roll. Every one has different taste. Nothing is better if you have a friend with 4runner with KDSS and without to see which one you like. You might like KDSS more.\n\nI would only get KDSS if you want to modify lightly and do mild to moderate off-roading. It's a great setup for a weekend warrior.\n\nIf serious off-roading is a priority, I'd get the standard sway bar setup, and remove the front sway bar if I needed extra articulation.\n\nYou can't really duplicate what KDSS does with aftermarket suspension. But, a good set of coilovers and shocks will definitely improve the handling.\n\nAnother thing I've found that doesn't come up often is that the front sway bar sits pretty low, and the skid has to sit even lower in front to accommodate the movement of the sway bar. I bash my front skid on rocks pretty regularly. If you're going to stick to lighter trails, this might not be an issue. But, it's worth noting.\n\nIf that is your case then get the TRD ORP with KDSS and get it lifted. There are so many off roaders here that you will have no problem with getting useful advice and someone already mentioned to get the KDSS brackets."
