        "text": "Suspension therapy is a relatively new physical therapy treatment, especially in the United States. Redcord’s suspension therapy system was introduced in the 1980s in Norway and has slowly made its way to the United States. At the time of this writing, Manhattan Physical Therapy and Pain Center is the only physical therapy practice in New York City to offer it. We’ve compiled everything you need to know about suspension therapy based on the questions and comments we’ve received from clients.\n\nIt’s More Challenging Than It Looks (But Can Be Customized)\n\nJust looking at the Redcard suspension therapy system can cause two reactions from clients. Either clients think that it is extremely simple and easy or that it is challenging and overwhelming. Suspension therapy is challenging, as it causes your body to work on instability, vibration, coordination, and balance. Fortunately, the challenge level can be customized to meet your specific fitness level and needs.\n\nCan Be Used to Improve Form in Athletes\n\nSuspension therapy can be used to improve form, work through injuries, and isolate movements in athletes. In swimmers and runners, athletes can work with a physical therapist on their form in a way that they couldn’t in a traditional physical therapy gym. This might include learning a new way to perform a swimming stroke or a turn your arm to reduce strain.\n\nWorks Stabilizer Muscles\n\nSuspension therapy can help to strengthen stabilizer muscles which can reduce back pain and improve core muscles. This can help with a variety of ailments, including chronic pain. The instability of suspension therapy can also strengthen these muscles.\n\nHelps Neuromuscular Control\n\nSuspension therapy specifically works to Improve your neuromuscular system and its control. This is under the NEURAC method of treatment, which is a reference for Neuromuscular Activation, which happens when your nerves and muscles work together. Some physical therapy exercises help to accomplish this better than others. Suspension therapy is an excellent way to do this.\n\nRestores Range of Motion\n\nRedcord is an anti-gravity suspension system that restores joint motion and tissue stretching to improve your range of motion. It is a pain-free way for your physical therapist to see the entire range of motion for you to complete a specific movement. This can help to reveal weaknesses in the kinetic chain that can be addressed through physical therapy.\n\nRedcord suspension therapy can be used to treat a very wide range of conditions, from helping elite athletes improve their form to providing relief through muscle retraining for Parkinson’s patients. It is an important tool that can be used alone or in combination with other physical therapy treatments. If you have tried other forms of physical therapy, it is worth exploring suspension therapy and how it can provide more concentrated treatment for affected areas.\n\nReady to Get Started?\n\nIf you are ready for the latest physical therapy treatments for your pain or injury, contact Manhattan Physical Therapy and Pain Center today at (212) 213-3480 to learn how we can help."
