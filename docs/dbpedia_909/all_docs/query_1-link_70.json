        "text": "Advanced Automotive Suspensions Industry Overview\n\nThe global advanced automotive suspensions market size was USD 46.10 Billion in 2022 and is expected to register a rapid revenue CAGR of 3.4% during the forecast period. Increasing attention on vehicle safety and rising sales of luxury vehicles are key factors driving market revenue growth. Active suspension system controls the vertical movement of wheels relative to the vehicle body, which uses actuators that lower or raise the chassis according to the road condition.\n\nAny vehicle's suspension system is responsible for providing a secure and pleasant ride while upholding manageable handling and braking. Sports vehicles need to turn at a fast speed, whereas luxury automobiles are designed for a comfortable ride. On the other hand, trucks must transport large loads and occasionally deviate from paved surfaces.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Market Drivers\n\ntechnological advancements related to vehicular components is another key factor driving revenue growth of the market. Independent suspension is significantly more common in recent times. While more complicated than rigid axles, independent suspension provides a significantly better ride. MacPherson struts and double-wishbone suspension are the two forms of independent suspension that are most often used. The Ford Fusion, Lexus LS, and Subaru Impreza WRX are just a few examples of modern sedans and sports vehicles that include independent suspension.\n\nA decade ago, the design language to permit greater cargo capacity, cross-over architecture, and more variety in the ride and handling of vehicle, influenced manufacturing guidelines for commercial vehicles. Main needs of fuel efficiency, improved maneuverability, and load-carrying capacity have not been compromised in the present trends, which have shifted more toward safety, comfort, and ease of mobility. New suspension systems have evolved as an essential element to meet the demands of modern mobility for higher performance levels and improved comfort.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Market Demand\n\nThe rising use of regenerative braking in new cars as an energy-saving strategy is also rising demand for advanced automotive suspensions and driving market revenue growth. Regenerative suspension systems have attracted a lot of interest from businesses and researchers during the past ten years owing to potential advantages they may offer, making them an important subject for study and development.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Market Restraints\n\nThe high cost of modern suspension systems is a key factor, which could restrain market revenue growth. When compared to conventional suspension systems, these sophisticated suspension technologies frequently demand intricate designs, precise engineering, and the integration of cutting-edge materials.\n\nThese are less affordable for consumers on a tight budget, which restricts their use in popular automobiles. In addition, automakers could be hesitant to add these pricey suspension systems to their vehicles due to worries about profitability and pricing competition. As a result, high price discourages widespread market entry and limits the advanced automotive suspensions industry's potential for total revenue development.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Market Segment Insights\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Type Insights:\n\nOn the basis of suspension type, the advanced automotive suspensions market has been segmented into active suspension, semi-active suspension, and passive suspension.\n\nDominance of Active Suspension Segment:\n\nThe active suspension segment is expected to account for largest market share in the global advanced automotive suspensions market during the forecast period. This is because these technologies allow automakers to achieve higher levels of ride quality and car handling by maintaining the tires’ perpendicular alignment to the road during turns. High-end luxury automobiles are equipped with active suspension systems.\n\nThese technologies enable automakers to achieve higher levels of ride quality and car handling, by maintaining the tires’ perpendicular alignment to the road during turns, preventing unintended contact between vehicle frame and ground (especially when driving over a depression), and enabling more effective traction and steering control. Active suspension is additionally employed on buses and other commercial vehicles to temporarily lower the floor, making it simpler for individuals to board and depart the vehicle.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Sales Channel Insights:\n\nOn the basis of sales channel, the advanced automotive suspensions market has been segmented into Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and aftermarket.\n\nDominance of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) Segment:\n\nThe Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) segment is expected to register moderately fast market growth rate in the global advanced automotive suspensions market during the forecast period. This is due to rising demand for OEMs to create, produce, and market automobiles, as these are the major consumers of sophisticated automobile suspensions.\n\nCompared to conventional suspensions, these suspensions provide various benefits, including enhanced ride comfort, handling, and safety. In addition, rising popularity of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) and trucks, which often have larger and more sophisticated suspension systems is another key factor driving revenue growth of this segment. As more emphasis is placed on electrifying cars, new prospects for improved automobile suspensions are opening up, since these vehicles have different suspension needs than conventional gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Component Insights:\n\nOn the basis of suspension components, the advanced automotive suspensions market has been segmented into shock absorbers, springs, control arms, stabilizer bars, and others.\n\nDominance of Shock Absorbers Segment:\n\nThe shock absorbers segment is expected to account for significantly large market share in the global advanced automotive suspensions market during the forecast period. This is due to rapid advancements in automobiles and rising demand for bespoke vehicle shock absorbers.\n\nAs a result, modern automotive shock absorber concepts and designs have become more advanced. Considering the market has become so dynamic, various criteria for shock absorbers apply to different car models, which demonstrates rising demand for products of bespoke vehicle shock absorbers. The twin-tube and mono-tube shocks are essentially two separate designs from the adjustable and non-adjustable shocks.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Regional Insights:\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Asia Pacific market\n\nAsia Pacific is expected to account for largest market share in the global advanced automotive suspensions market during the forecast period. This is due to increasing use of New Electric Vehicles (NEVs), as well as rising comfort and safety standards, For instance, on 17 November 2022, Tenneco's Performance Solutions division's Advanced Suspension Technologies (AST) segment celebrated another noteworthy milestone in its electronic suspension line and expressed its aspirations to become a leading technological collaborator for Chinese automakers.\n\nFurthermore, Indian suspension systems are highly helpful in all passenger cars and a range of vehicle structures and application bases employ different suspension systems, which is expected to drive market revenue growth in this region during the forecast period.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions North America Market\n\nNorth America is expected to register fastest market growth rate in the global advanced automotive suspensions market over the forecast period. This is due to rising adoption of sophisticated suspension systems and need for features that increase driving comfort and safety. In addition, rising demand for luxury automobiles and high-performance cars, which frequently have cutting-edge suspension technology is another factor driving market revenue growth. Furthermore, automakers are being pressured to include modern suspension systems by strict government rules and safety requirements pertaining to the handling and stability of vehicles.\n\nAdvanced Automotive Suspensions Europe Market\n\nEurope is expected to account for considerably large market share in the global advanced automotive suspensions market over the forecast period.
