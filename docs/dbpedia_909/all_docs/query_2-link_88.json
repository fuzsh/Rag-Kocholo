        "text": "PLANO, Texas (September 1, 2021) – A Toyota lineup mainstay for nearly 40 years, the Toyota 4Runner has carved out its place as the ready-for-anything SUV that’s at home whether on pavement or the trail. For 2022, the 4Runner lineup expands with the addition of the TRD Sport, a road-tuned model that joins the trail-oriented TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro models. The 2022 4Runner line augments its safety tech roster with new standard features, as well.\n\nWith room for up to seven, the fifth-generation 4Runner remains the most capable of its proud family tree, and it is also the most accommodating and most comfortable. Other changes for 2022 make a great SUV even better across all grades. All models now have standard LED high beams, in addition to the LED low beams and fog lights that were already standard on most grades. Blind Spot Monitor + Rear Cross Traffic Alert is now standard on SR5 Premium, TRD Off-Road Premium, TRD Pro and Limited (and part of an available package on TRD Sport).\n\nWith the addition of the TRD Sport, the 4Runner line for 2022 includes the SR5, SR5 Premium, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, TRD Off-Road Premium, Limited and TRD Pro.\n\nThe burly 4Runner TRD Pro adds standard Multi-Terrain Monitor to its roster of off-road tech. Using strategically placed cameras, the system lets the driver check surroundings on the trail, with the ability to spot potential obstacles not easily seen from the cabin. The Limited grade adds a standard Panoramic View Monitor, which provides a similar function for checking surroundings when maneuvering the vehicle in tight spaces. The Limited grade and TRD models also add a premium Multi-Information Display.\n\nAll 4Runner models add Rear Occupancy Alert. When operational parameters are met, the system does what its name suggests, reminding a driver to check the rear seat for a child or pet before exiting the vehicle.\n\nRoad-Hugging TRD Sport\n\nSimilar to Toyota’s mid-size Tacoma truck sibling, the new 4Runner TRD Sport grade joins 4Runner TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro models in the line. Where the latter two add trail-ready equipment and features designed for tackling tough terrain, the TRD Sport sharpens its road-focused manners with sophisticated chassis technology while adding style and flair. The result is an exceptional combination of style and performance in a full-capability SUV.\n\nWith an emphasis on everyday comfort and road dynamics, the 2022 4Runner TRD Sport adds the Cross-Linked Relative Absorber System (X-REAS) suspension to enhance on-road handling. The X-REAS system, also found on the 4Runner Limited grade, automatically adjusts the damping force of shock absorbers when driving over bumpy surfaces or when cornering. A center control absorber cross-links the shock absorbers on opposite corners of the vehicle, like an “X,” to help reduce pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs.\n\nThe 4Runner TRD Sport is available with either 2WD or part-time 4WD with a 2-speed transfer case. The 2WD 4Runners provide an ample 9.0 inches of ground clearance, while 4WD models offer an even more generous 9.6 inches. Based on the SR5 grade, the 2022 4Runner TRD Sport swaps the SR5’s 17-inch wheels for machine-faced 20-inch wheels with Dark Gray accents. All 4Runners come equipped with a full-sized spare tire, regardless of their wheel size.\n\nTRD Sport Style and Tech\n\nThe TRD Sport gets its own look with color-keyed accents on the grille, rocker panels and body molding, plus the signature TRD-style hood scoop and a front spoiler and black roof rails. Inside, the 4Runner TRD Sport replaces the SR5 grade’s cloth seat surfaces with power-adjustable black SofTex-trimmed seats. The seats feature unique gray contrast stitching, and the front headrests have gray TRD stitched logos. TRD Sport floor mats are included, and a standard TRD shift knob completes the cabin makeover.\n\nStandard features carried over to the new TRD Sport include an 8-way power driver’s seat, leather-trimmed tilt/telescopic steering wheel, air conditioning with rear seat vents and pollen filter and power-sliding liftgate window. A 4.2-inch multi-information display provides the driver with readouts for outside temperature, odometer, trip meters, fuel economy estimate averages and TSS-P features, including Lane Departure Alert and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.\n\nThe 4Runner TRD Sport features a standard 8-inch multimedia touchscreen display. In addition to Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and Amazon Alexa compatibility, the system includes a USB media port, hands-free phone capability, advanced voice recognition and music streaming via Bluetooth® wireless technology and a SiriusXM® 3-month All Access trial. Connected Services include Safety Connect® with 1-year trial and Wi-Fi Connect with up to 3 GB or 1-month trial, whichever comes first.\n\nToyota Safety Sense P Standard for All\n\nAll 2022 4Runner models come standard with Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P), an advanced suite of driver-assist technologies that includes Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Departure Alert with Sway Warning System, Automatic High Beams and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.\n\nAlong with TSS-P, 4Runner models also come equipped with Toyota’s Star Safety System that includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC, or A-TRAC with 4WD) and Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA) and the Smart Stop Technology (SST) brake-override system.\n\nEight standard airbags include driver and front passenger Advanced Airbag System; front seat-mounted side airbags; driver and front passenger knee airbags; and all-row, roll-sensing side curtain airbags.\n\nThe Ready-for-Adventure SUV\n\n4Runner’s inherent strength starts with its tough-as-nails, body-on-frame construction featuring a four-link rear axle and coil-spring suspension, with the Limited grade and new TRD Sport also adding X-REAS to their suspension features. The robust chassis is also the foundation of 4Runner’s comfortable ride quality.\n\nA 270-horsepower DOHC 4.0-liter V6 engine with 278 lb.-ft. of peak torque gives 4Runner plenty of get-up-and-go. The engine’s Dual Independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps optimize torque across the engine’s operating range responsiveness in a variety of driving conditions.\n\nMated to the V6 is a five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission that includes a sequential shift mode for manually shifting when more control is desired. Like all 4Runner grades, the TRD Sport is equipped with a standard integrated tow-hitch receiver and wiring harness. All models can tow a maximum of 5,000 pounds, with a maximum 500-pound tongue weight.\n\nAll 4Runner 2WD models feature standard Automatic Limited Slip Differential (Auto LSD), a function of the traction control (TRAC) that allows some wheel slippage to help the vehicle dig out from sand or snow, for example. The available part-time 4WD system uses Active Traction Control (A-TRAC) and bolsters off-road capability with a 2-speed transfer case with selectable low-range. By distributing drive force to any one wheel in contact with the ground, A-TRAC can help maintain traction when it senses wheel slippage occurring on terrain irregularities and slippery patches.\n\nExclusive to the 4Runner Limited, a full-time 4WD system uses a Torsen center differential with locking feature and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The system employs a 40:60 torque split in most driving situations and alters that in response to slippage. In addition, if the front wheels are slipping while the vehicle is turning, the Torsen® differential changes the split to 30:70. If the rear wheels slip while the vehicle is turning, the split changes to 53:47.\n\nMaximum Traction Tech\n\nThe Toyota 4Runner offers the right tool for the off-road mission, because some people go farther off the beaten path than others. An array of technologies enhance the capability provided by the 4Runner’s high-strength chassis and available 4WD. Standard Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC) provides additional control when accelerating from a stop on a steep incline. The system helps to briefly hold the vehicle stationary while the driver transitions from the brake pedal to the accelerator.\n\nLimited and SR5 models equipped with 4WD also feature standard Downhill Assist Control (DAC). This feature augments low-speed descending controllability by helping to maintain a constant slow speed and preventing wheel lockup, therefore allowing the driver to concentrate primarily on steering.\n\nThe 4Runner TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro models add the capability of an electronic-locking rear differential and Toyota’s Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature. The latter helps maintain a constant speed in low-speed, off-road situations, enhancing vehicle control when driving up, over or down obstacles. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and braking force to slowly move the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable, low-speed settings. This function allows the driver to focus on steering without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal in challenging terrain. TRD Pro models come equipped with Multi Terrain Monitor (MTM), which allows the driver to check the immediate surroundings for potential obstacles by simply pressing a button to display front-, rear- and side-camera views on the 8-inch multimedia screen. MTM is available on TRD Off-Road Premium.\n\nAs trail conditions change, the driver can adapt the vehicle using the standard Multi-Terrain Select system using a dial to choose a mode that matches prevailing surface conditions. The system will then adjust wheel slip control accordingly.\n\nFor example, on loose terrain such as mud and sand, above-normal wheel slip is permitted, allowing wheel-spin to work in the vehicle’s favor. The Mogul setting is suitable for extremely uneven terrain, such as V-ditches, slopes and ridges – uphill or down. In this mode, wheel slip is minimized and the system acts more like a limited slip differential. An overhead console groups the off-road control switches in one location.\n\nTRD Pro Earns Its Name\n\nThe TRD Pro badge on any Toyota truck or SUV signifies the most off-road-capable vehicle in its respective line. For 2022, it will be offered in the unique color of Lime Rush, which will be added to exterior color options Super White, Magnetic Gray Metallic and Midnight Black Metallic. Black TRD alloy flow-form wheels are equipped with Nitto Terra Grappler tires, and specially tuned Fox internal bypass shocks and TRD-tuned coil springs yield an inch of front lift for improved trail-tackling capability.\n\nThe rear Fox shocks feature piggyback-style remote reservoirs to maintain damping performance over demanding off-road terrain. Delivering the best of both worlds, the shock tuning improves trail driving isolation and high-speed performance without compromising on-road comfort and steering response. Like other Toyota TRD Pro vehicles, the 4Runner TRD Pro features a 1/4-inch-thick aluminum front skid plate with red TRD lettering. The TRD roof rack is exclusive to 4Runner.\n\nInside, the TRD Pro features HVAC controls like the one found in the Limited grade, plus a standard moonroof and Premium Audio with JBL speakers featuring Clari-Fi™ technology. The 4Runner TRD Pro features a standard TRD-branded cat-back exhaust, which adds a powerful-sounding growl for the V6 engine.\n\nOn and Off-Road Suspension\n\nFor even greater off-road prowess, the TRD Off-Road grade can be equipped with Toyota’s optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which allows extended wheel travel at slow speeds for greater off-road capability and control. The KDSS system hydraulically adjusts the lean resistance provided by the stabilizer bars. Sway resistance is reduced for off-road driving to help minimize any tendency for wheel lift. On pavement, KDSS enables the bars to work conventionally, reducing body lean to enhance agility and control.\n\nThe 4Runner Limited, while certainly off-road capable, emphasizes everyday comfort and pavement handling with the X-REAS suspension system now also shared with the 2022 TRD Sport.\n\n4Runner Style\n\nThe 4Runner exudes a rugged look in all grades yet maintains a timeless SUV style all its own. The SR5 and TRD models ride on 17-inch alloy wheels that are available in three designs: 6-spoke for SR5 models, 7-spoke for TRD Off-Road models and flow-form matte black alloy wheels for TRD Pro.\n\nThe TRD Off-Road and TRD Off-Road Premium grades are distinguished by color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, hood scoop and silver painted front and rear bumper accents. “TRD Off-Road” badges adorn the C-pillars. The Limited is the only 4Runner with a chrome-plated grille insert and chrome exterior trim. All 4Runner models have LED fog lights as standard equipment, with the TRD Pro featuring Rigid Industries LED fog lights.\n\nSpace to Roam\n\nFor carrying gear, 4Runner offers multiple options. With the second-row seats in use, the cargo area offers up to 47.2 cu. ft. of carrying space. If it’s just two people hitting the road or trail, folding the second row opens a cavernous 89.7 cu.-ft. cargo area. The second-row seats fold flat without having to remove the headrests.\n\nThe 4Runner SR5 and Limited grades offer available third-row seating, with a split 50:50 seat that folds flat. When so equipped, the 40:20:40 second-row seat has a one-touch walk-in function to provide easy access to the third row. The seats can be folded from the side or at the rear, using separate one-touch levers. The second-row seats, which include a center armrest, individually recline up to 16 degrees in four steps.\n\nFor power on the go, the 4Runner has a standard 120V outlet and two 12V outlets. The available pull-out cargo deck can support up to 440 pounds to make loading and unloading heavy items easier. It also provides seating for tailgating and campsite relaxation.\n\nToyota Value from Bumper to Bumper\n\nAll 4Runner grades are equipped with Smart Key with Push Button Start. The SR5 Premium and TRD Off-Road Premium add a significant comfort upgrade with SofTex®-trimmed seats, heated front seats and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.\n\nThe 4Runner Limited delivers a luxury experience with leather-trimmed, heated and ventilated 8-way power adjustable driver’s seat (with memory) and 4-way power adjustable front passenger seat, along with dual-zone automatic climate control. Limited grade’s standard front and rear clearance sonar system helps make parking maneuvers easier and safer.
