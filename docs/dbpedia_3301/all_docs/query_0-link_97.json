He had been serving as interim chief of staff since July.\n\nThe long-time Allard staffer has also worked for former Sen. Bill Armstrong (R-Colo.).\n\nDick Wadhams, a seasoned political strategist, who served as Allard’s campaign manager in 2002, will assume the mantle of press secretary, a post he first held briefly in 1997.\n\nOver the course of his career, the 47-year-old Wadhams has managed the campaigns of a variety of Centennial State politicians, including Gov. Bill Owens (R) and former Sen. Hank Brown (R).\n\nHe also served a stint as press secretary for Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.).\n\nThe Littleton, Colo., native holds a 1982 bachelor’s in political science from the University of Southern Colorado.\n\nBack at the Grand Canyon Corral. Rep. John Boozman (R-Ark.) has recently promoted six of his trusty staffers.\n\nFormer legislative director Matt Sagely becomes deputy chief of staff and will head up Boozman’s Washington office since Chief of Staff Steve Gray is based in the Congressman’s 3rd district. He replaces Donna Hutchinson who has returned to Arkansas.\n\nThe one-time aide to now-Sen.

Asa Hutchinson’s (R-Ark.) office, while still a government and politics student at the University of Maryland in College Park.\n\nBy the time Hutchinson resigned to head the Drug Enforcement Agency, she had risen to the position of legislative assistant.\n\nThe 25-year-old Curry is a native of Annapolis, Md.\n\nScheduler Elizabeth Yeager, also 25, adds office manager to her current title. Before joining Boozman, she spent two years working as a legislative correspondent and staff assistant for then-Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.).\n\nA member of Spring Arbor University’s class of 1999, Yeager holds a bachelor’s in social science. She is from Beaverton, Mich.\n\nAfter spending a year as legislative correspondent, Cline McKnight gets the nod to take over as legislative assistant responsible for taxes, banking, financial services, energy, and the education and water resources subcommittee.\n\nMcKnight, who previously worked at Merrill Lynch International Bank in London, is originally from Rogers, Ark.\n\nThe 24-year-old received a bachelor’s in economics from Wheaton College in 2000.\n\nNew Director of Constituent Correspondence John Mark Huckabee of Little Rock, Ark., will manage the Congressman’s mail system, as well as deal with housing, welfare, science and religious issues. Huckabee formerly was legislative correspondent.\n\nThe Ouachita Baptist University grad, 26, holds a bachelor’s in political science.\n\nLast but not least, staff assistant Charlotte Shasteen becomes legislative correspondent.\n\nHer previous Congressional experience includes a stint as district staff assistant for Hutchinson.\n\nThe 24-year-old Shasteen earned a bachelor’s in political science, with a minor in history, from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Ark.
