        "text": "Library of Congress Table\n\nThe Library will feature a table in the SkyBridge Lobby of the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle. (The Library will not exhibit its full Pavilion in Seattle). Table hours are:\n\nFriday, January 25: 1:30 pm-5:00 pm\n\nSaturday-Sunday, January 26-27: 10:00 am-4:00 pm\n\nMonday, January 28: 10:00 am-2:00 pm\n\nMichelle Spezzacatena and Kahin Mohammad will be at the table to hand out promotional items and documents and to respond to questions from ALA attendees. They will also be collecting recommendations from attendees regarding the Library’s programming at the 2019 ALA Annual Conference. A survey to compile further information is available at URL < www.surveymonkey.com/r/LOCat2019ALA > through February 10, 2019. The Library looks forward to hearing recommendations from ALA members!\n\nUser-Centered Organizational Realignment/New Strategic Plan\n\nIn late September, Librarian of Congress Carla D. Hayden issued a new five-year strategic plan for the Library of Congress, Enriching the Library Experience. The new plan puts forth our commitment to making our unique collections, expertise, and services available when, where, and how people use them. The plan is the culmination of an extensive envisioning and planning initiative that explored how best to fulfill our mission to engage, inspire, and inform Congress and the American people. It presents the Library’s roadmap to expanding our reach and deepening our impact so that users who find information and inspiration from this remarkable institution get the most out of their experiences.\n\nAs the Library embarks on an exciting journey to put users first, we have refined our mission statement and agreed upon a bold aspirational vision – that All Americans are connected to the Library of Congress .\n\nWe have identified four strategic goals for the coming years, all of which build upon unifying themes and are relevant to every service unit, office, and staff member, allowing us to work together to realize our strategy in a more powerful way:\n\nExpand Access: Increase Discoverability and Availability – Use Connectors to Extend Reach – Expand Physical Presence.\n\nEnhance Services: Elevate Digital Experiences – Transform In-Person Experiences – Develop User-Centered Content.\n\nOptimize Resources: Align Core Library Activities – Modernize Operations – Invest in Talent for the Future – Diversify and Expand Funding.\n\nMeasure Impact: Understand Our Users – Communicate Impact – Promote a Culture of Continuous Improvement.\n\nThe better to accomplish these goals, the Librarian also announced a user-centered realignment of the Library’s organizational structure. The realignment established the Center for Exhibits and Interpretation and the Center for Learning, Literacy and Engagement within the Office of the Librarian; brought Library Services, the Law Library of Congress, and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped into a single Library Collections and Services Group that also includes the Internship and Fellowship Programs and the John W. Kluge Center; established the Digital Innovation Lab; and established the Library Enterprises Directorate. The latter was established in May 2019. The remainder of the user-centered realignment was concluded by October 1, 2018.\n\nCOPYRIGHT OFFICE\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe U.S. Copyright Office appointed Gustave Schlesier deputy director of the Copyright Modernization Office and Sylvester Simpkins head of the Records Research and Certification Section. The Office of the General Counsel appointed Jordana Rubel and Steve Ruwe assistant general counsels. The Registration Program added 25 new examiners in September.\n\nModernization\n\nThe Copyright Office continued its modernization efforts, working with Deloitte Digital to build an Enterprise Copyright System (ECS). Office and Deloitte staff incorporated information gathered on their listening tours in Nashville and Los Angeles and through remitter and Office staff surveys into wireframes for the new registration and recordation sections of the ECS. User testing has begun.\n\nThe Copyright Modernization Office hosted a two-day Industry Day event, welcoming venders who responded to the Request for Information (RFI) that was sent in early May. The event gave vendors a chance for hands-on guidance across the Office. After the event, the Office received thirteen proposals from vendors offering a solution for the government at no, or exceptionally low, cost. The vendor wants to do this, for their part, because it allows them a large, highly visible platform upon which to build a cutting-edge, fully functioning, high-profile, symbiotic solution.\n\nIn October, the Copyright Office published a notice of inquiry requesting written comments on how to improve the regulations and practices related to the registration of copyright claims in the digital age. Specifically, the Office sought input on three areas of reform: (1) the administration and substance of the application for registration, (2) the utility of the public record, and (3) the deposit requirements for registration.\n\nLegislation\n\nOn October 10, 2018, the President signed the Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act into law. On June 27, 2013, the international copyright community adopted the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled, and the treaty entered into force on September 30, 2016. The United States signed the Marrakesh Treaty as a contracting party on October 2, 2013, but needed to take additional steps to amend its national legislation before becoming a treaty member. Congress needed time to consult with various stakeholders, including those representing the blind communities, the publishing sector, and the library communities, among others, on the proposed legislative language.\n\nOn October 11, 2018, the President signed The Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act into law. This bipartisan and unanimously-enacted legislation represents the realization of years of effort by a wide array of policymakers and stakeholders, and the U.S. Copyright Office itself, to update music licensing to better facilitate legal licensing of music by digital services. The legislation addresses Congress’s determination that copyright law had not kept pace with changing consumer preferences and technological developments in music. The law has three key components, Title I—Music Licensing Modernization; Title II—Classics Protection and Access; and Title III—Allocation for Music Producers. The law is effective as of October 11, 2018, but some aspects become applicable later. The Copyright Office and stakeholders must undertake several implementation steps during this process.\n\nRulemakings and Regulations\n\nOn May 24, the Office issued a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on a new fee schedule, with proposed changes to fees for services in the following areas: registration, recordation, record retrieval, search, and certification, the Licensing Division, and other ancillary services. The proposed fee schedule aims to improve the rate of cost-recovery for the Office’s fee-based services.\n\nOn October 15, the Office adopted a final rule to streamline the administration of digital audio recording technology royalty accounts and electronic royalty payment processes. First, the final rule codifies a procedure for closing out DART royalty payments accounts under section 1005 of the Copyright Act, which gives the Register discretion to close out royalty payments accounts for a calendar year four years after the close of that year. In addition, the final rule updates the Office’s regulations governing online payment procedures for cable, satellite, and DART statements of account to no longer require single lump sum payments when multiple statements are submitted. These modifications are intended to improve the efficiency of the Copyright Office’s Licensing Division operations and simplify royalty payment procedures for filers.\n\nOn October 16, pursuant to the Classics Protection and Access Act, title II of the Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA), the Copyright Office issued an interim rule and notice of inquiry regarding sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972. As required by the MMA, the interim rule that establishes a mechanism for rights owners to file schedules listing their pre-1972 sound recordings with the Office, for individuals to request timely notification of when such filings are indexed into the Office’s public records, and for the submission of contact information by entities publicly performing pre-1972 sound recordings by means of digital audio transmission as of October 11, 2018. In the notice of inquiry, the Office sought public comment regarding the MMA’s noncommercial use exception. The Office solicited comments regarding the specific steps that a user should take to demonstrate she has made a good faith, reasonable search to determine if a pre-1972 sound recording is being commercially exploited. The Office also solicited comments regarding the filing requirements for the user to submit a notice of noncommercial use, and for a rights owner to submit a notice objecting to such use.\n\nOn October 25, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Acting Register of Copyrights, published a final rule adopting exemptions to the statutory prohibition on circumvention of technological measures that control access to copyrighted works. Publication of the final rule marks the completion of the seventh triennial rulemaking proceeding under 17 USC § 1201. As in prior section 1201 proceedings, the Copyright Office administered the rulemaking through an extensive public process. For this seventh triennial proceeding, the Office implemented a new streamlined process enabling members of the public to seek renewal of existing exemptions to which there was no meaningful opposition. The Acting Register ultimately recommended readoption of all exemptions granted in the 2015 rulemaking. The Office then invited public input on proposed new or expanded exemptions through three rounds of written comments and seven days of public hearings in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. As required by statute, the Office also consulted with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the Department of Commerce. Based on this record, the Acting Register recommended the granting of several additional exemptions, as discussed in her formal recommendation to the Librarian. The Librarian adopted the Acting Register’s recommendation in full.\n\nOn November 20, the Office adopted a final rule (PDF, 233 KB), effective December 30, 2018, to update its regulations governing group registration options for newsletters and serials. The final rule requires applicants to file online rather than use a paper application and upload a complete digital copy of each issue through the electronic registration system instead of submitting them in physical form. To satisfy the mandatory deposit requirement, if the newsletter or serial is published in the United States in a physical format, two complimentary subscriptions must be provided directly to the Library of Congress (unless the Library notifies the publisher otherwise). In addition, for group newsletters, the rule eliminates requirements that each issue be a work made for hire and be registered within three months of publication. For group serials, the rule clarifies registration requirements, including that serials must generally be published at intervals of at least a week and that the publication dates need not match the dates on the issues themselves.\n\nOn December 7, pursuant to the Musical Works Modernization Act, title I of the Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act, the Copyright Office issued an interim rule to amend the Office’s existing regulations pertaining to the compulsory “mechanical” license for making and distributing phonorecords of nondramatic musical works available under 17 USC § 115 so as to conform the existing regulations to the new law, including with respect to the operation of notices of intention and statements of account, and to make other minor technical updates. This interim rule is generally directed at the present transition period before a blanket license is offered by a mechanical licensing collective and does not include regulatory updates that may be required in connection with the future offering of that blanket license; such updates will be the subject of future rulemakings.\n\nOn December 21, pursuant to the Musical Works Modernization Act, title I of the Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (MMA), the U.S. Copyright Office issued a notice of inquiry seeking public comment regarding the designation of a mechanical licensing collective and a digital licensee coordinator to carry out key functions under the updated section 115 “mechanical” license for the reproduction and distribution of musical works; specifically, the creation and administration of a new blanket licensing system governing licensed uses by digital music providers. As required by the MMA, the Copyright Office solicits information to assist in the Register designating an entity as the mechanical licensing collective (MLC) to administer the newly created blanket license, build and maintain a comprehensive database of musical works and sound recordings, and distribute collected royalties to songwriters and music publishers. The Office also solicits information to assist the Register in designating an entity as the digital licensee coordinator (DLC), which will represent digital music services in the administration of the license and in the determination of the administrative assessment fee paid by digital music providers for the reasonable costs of establishing and operating the new MLC.\n\nOn December 21, the Office published a notice of proposed rulemaking to create a group registration option for short online literary works. To qualify for this option, each work must contain at least 100 but no more than 17,500 words. The works must be created by the same individual, and that individual must be named as the copyright claimant for each work. The works must all be published online within a three-calendar-month period. If these requirements have been met, the applicant may submit up to 50 works with one application and one filing fee. The applicant must complete the online application designated for a “literary work” and upload a digital copy of each work.\n\nOn December 26, the U.S. Copyright Office proposed to update its regulations governing the procedures for registering architectural works. Applicants will be required to submit their claims using the online Standard Application and will be encouraged to upload digital copies of their works through the electronic registration system rather than submitting physical copies. The proposed regulation also clarifies under what circumstances applicants must provide a date of construction for a building as well as the meaning of the phrases “overall form of the building” and “interior arrangements of spaces and/or design elements,” which are the aspects of the architectural work that must be perceptible in a deposit copy submitted by an applicant.\n\nTo reflect technical upgrades to its current electronic registration system, on December 27, the Copyright Office adopted a final rule [PDF, 222 KB], effective January 28, 2019, updating its regulations regarding the eligibility requirements for the Single Application. Among other things, the rule confirms that the Single Application may be used to register one work that is created and solely owned by one author and is not a work made for hire. It also confirms that the Single Application may be used to register one sound recording and one musical work, literary work, or dramatic work—notwithstanding the fact that a sound recording and the work embodied in that recording are separate works. In addition, as explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the rule eliminates the “short form” version of the Office’s paper applications. The rule will also allow for paper applications to be certified with an electronic signature by removing the requirement that certification includes a “handwritten” signature of the certifying party.\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Office advised the U.S. Dept. of Justice in filing an amicus brief in two patent cases before the Supreme Court, WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp. and Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene’s Energy Group, LLC. In both cases, the Supreme Court opinions largely cohered with the government’s positions. The Office has also advised regarding a pending petition in Iancu v. Brunetti, concerning whether the Lanham Act’s prohibition on the federal registration of “immoral” or “scandalous” marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIn Syngenta Crop Protection LLC v. Willowood, LLC currently pending before the Federal Circuit, the Office advised the DOJ on whether “me-too” labels on generic-brand pesticides approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) pesticides infringe the copyright of the pesticide manufacturer that created the pioneer pesticide and label and obtained original approval for it under FIFRA.\n\nOutreach\n\nThe Copyright Office participated in the Library of Congress’ Open House in the Main Reading Room of the Jefferson Building over Memorial Day Weekend. The Office displayed copyright deposits featuring vintage children’s toys from Sesame Street, The Muppets, and more.\n\nThe Copyright Office and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) cohosted the 2018 International Copyright Institute in Washington, DC, June 4–8. Officials from seventeen countries heard from a cross section of experts from government, private industry, and civil society, and they participated in panel discussions focused on international copyright harmonization and emerging challenges posed by new technologies. Participating officials came from Angola, Bahamas, Barbados, Bhutan, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Jordan, Kiribati, Lebanon, Micronesia, Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname. On June 18–21, Office staff members attended the American Association of Independent Musicians (A2IM) Indie Week in New York City. They spoke to musicians, producers, record label owners, and other representatives of the independent music industry about registration, copyright law, and the Music Modernization Act.\n\nOn July 20, the Acting Register and staff welcomed Senator Orrin G. Hatch to the Copyright Office. Senator Hatch spent many years leading the Senate Judiciary Committee and has sponsored and supported many pieces of legislation amending the Copyright Act. The Acting Register displayed items connected to important copyright cases, such as the lamp from Mazer v. Stein, as well as special materials reflecting elements from Hatch’s home state of Utah, such as the first registration by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the original copyright registration of the Book of Mormon.\n\nOn August 11, the Office of Public Information and Education represented the Office at Otakon, an annual convention celebrating Asian pop culture (anime, manga, music, movies, and video games) and its fandom. Staff members spoke in a panel discussion about the importance of copyright registration and staffed a table where convention goers learned about Library of Congress services.\n\nOn August 17, staff members of the Public Information Office exhibited at the U.S. Patent and Trade Office’s Annual Independent Inventors Conference.\n\nOn September 1, the Copyright Office participated in the Library of Congress exhibit at the National Book Festival. Copyright Office staff members handed out information about the Copyright Office and described what the Office does and the benefits of registering a work for copyright protection and hosted Copyright Office trivia.\n\nOn September 24–30, the Acting Register of Copyrights participated at WIPO Assemblies of Member States 58th Series of Meetings in Geneva, Switzerland, and was moderator of the panel “Empowering Women in the Creative Industries.”\n\nThe Copyright Office held its new course, “Copyright Academy: Introduction to the 1976 Act,” October 2–December 13. This survey-level course offered a basic introduction to fundamental concepts and principles of United States copyright law for those without any prior structured classes on copyright law.\n\nOn October 15, the Copyright Office hosted the Copyright Matters event, “Extra! Extra! The Scoop on Copyright & the News,” on October 15 in the Coolidge Auditorium. This discussion on the unique relation between journalism and the free press and copyright included a panel comprising Jonathan Band, technology law and policy advocate; Michael Carroll, American University professor of law and director of the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property and a co-founder of Creative Commons; Tom Curley, associate general counsel at Gannett Co., Inc.; Sharon Farmer, former director of the White House Photography Office; and Robert Levine, Billboard reporter and author of Free Ride. Each panelist opened with an overview of his or her work. Panelists discussed how copyright has affected their work, both what they’re able to write and what others can take from their writing and photography.\n\nOn October 22–23, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the Copyright Office co-organized the Experts’ Meeting on Copyright Registration and Infrastructure in the Digital Age. The two-day meeting was held in Washington, DC. This event brought together senior officials from ten national copyright offices and one regional organization. Participants discussed a variety of topics, including: the registration examination process and user experiences, the role of public and private registries, the use of standards and identifiers in registration systems, the interaction between legal and registration deposits, and the relevance of a voluntary registration system. Officials from the following offices attended: Argentina, Bermuda, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Nigeria, Peru, Republic of Korea, Spain, Uruguay, and the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO).\n\nThroughout the year, Office staff members attended the STOPFakes Roadshows throughout the United States. They presented Copyright & Your Business’s Creative Works: How Copyright Impacts You, and they answered questions from small business owners and assisting them with copyright registrations.\n\nWebsite\n\nOn July 18, the Copyright Office upgraded searching and results tracking in the proof of concept of the Virtual Card Catalog (VCC). In this upgraded version, users now can perform simple and advanced queries based on the raw datasets captured from the images; may narrow the number of results from browsing (in addition to browsing drawers); have more images from which to search (for a more complete search)—this new release contains approximately 99.6 percent of the images from the two indexes; can select multiple drawers from multiple indexes to browse and can click on a card to enlarge an image along with the set of images for easy scrolling; and may also select specific drawers for additional queries, in addition to saving up to twenty-five cards to a folder during a browsing session.\n\nCopyright Lore Online\n\nThe Office published its archive of “Copyright Lore” articles online. These articles capture one small piece of copyright history and cover a wide variety of topics—law and policy, the Copyright Office through time, treasures found in the Office, and many different copyrighted works. Every Copyright Lore since 2002 is now onlinein the History and Education section of copyright.gov, and new entries are added each month. Lores are searchable by title or by keywords in the descriptions.\n\nOFFICE OF THE LIBRARIAN\n\nSee also User-Centered Organization Realignment/New Strategic Plan\n\nPersonnel\n\nRyan Ramsey was appointed Chief of Staff to the Librarian of Congress, effective June 26.\n\nThe Librarian of Congress selected David S. Mandel as director of the Center for Exhibits and Interpretation, effective Aug. 5, 2018. The Librarian selected Shari Rosenstein Werb as the director of the Center for Learning, Literacy and Engagement, effective Aug. 19, 2018. These key posts are at the helms of newly established offices that are central to executing the Library’s strategy of informing, inspiring and engaging the public.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS OFFICE (CRO)\n\nThe New 116th Congress\n\nThe 116th Congress convened on Thursday, January 3, 2019, welcoming 98 new Members of Congress (nine Senators and 89 House of Representatives Members) in the incoming freshman class. Republicans retained control of the U.S. Senate after the November 2018 elections, gaining two seats in the chamber, while Democrats won 40 seats to become the controlling party of the U.S. House:\n\nSenate House 115th Congress R: 51\n\nD: 49 (including two Independents) D: 193\n\nR: 235\n\nVacant: 7 116th Congress R: 53\n\nD: 47 (including two Independents) D: 235\n\nR: 199\n\nVacant: 1 (disputed race, NC-9th district)\n\nKey Leadership and Committee Changes\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) continue to lead their parties in the Senate. Generally, Republican and Democratic leadership in the Senate remains largely unchanged, with the exception of two positions. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) succeeds John Cornyn (R-TX) as majority whip, and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) assumes the position of Senate President pro tempore, succeeding retired Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT).\n\nIn the House, there are limited changes to party leadership other than the Democrats gaining the Speakership under Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Occupants of the top Democratic leadership positions move up a notch in their leadership ranks. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) leads the Republican conference as the new minority leader.\n\nSome committee assignments are officially adopted via resolution at the beginning of each Congress, while others can take several weeks to be assigned. At this time, the top positions for the Library’s key oversight committees have been announced. They are:\n\nSenate Rules and Administration Committee\n\nChair: Roy Blunt, Missouri\n\nRanking: Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee (full committee)\n\nChair: Richard Shelby, Alabama\n\nRanking: Patrick Leahy, Vermont\n\nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch\n\nChair: Cindy Hyde-Smith, Mississippi\n\nRanking: To be determined\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee\n\nNEW Chairman: Lindsey Graham, South Carolina\n\n(Replacing Chuck Grassley, Iowa, who is new chair of the Finance Committee)\n\nRanking: Diane Feinstein, California\n\nIn the House, all committees will have new Democratic chairpersons, most of whom have served for many years as ranking members. Roughly half the Republican ranking members will be new. (Members who have not previously held the top committee position for their party are labeled as NEW, as they are new to that committee’s leadership.)\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee (full committee)\n\nChair: Nita Lowey, New York\n\nNEW Ranking: Kay Granger, Texas\n\nReplacing Rodney Frelinghuysen (retired)\n\nHouse Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch\n\nChair: Tim Ryan, Ohio\n\nRanking: Jaime Herrera Beutler, Washington\n\nCommittee on House Administration\n\nNEW Chair: Zoe Lofgren, California Replacing Bob Brady, Pennsylvania (retired)\n\nNEW Ranking: Rodney Davis, Illinois\n\nReplacing Gregg Harper, Mississippi (retired)\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee\n\nChair: Jerry Nadler, New York\n\nNEW Ranking: Doug Collins, Georgia\n\nReplacing Bob Goodlatte, Virginia (retired)\n\nHouse Rules Committee\n\nChair: Jim McGovern, Massachusetts\n\nNEW Ranking: Tom Cole, Oklahoma\n\nReplacing Pete Sessions, Texas (defeated in general election)\n\nFor more information on how the 2018 election and congressional retirements impacted congressional leadership and the Library’s oversight committees, see the lists in Congressional Leadership & Library Oversight Committees in this document. Appropriations\n\nFiscal 2019 Appropriations\n\nThe Library’s fiscal 2019 budget requested $761.93 million in total budget authority for the agency, including $706.11 million in annual appropriations and $55.82 million in authority to spend offsetting receipts and prior year unobligated balances.\n\nJust before the end of fiscal 2017, Congress passed an appropriations ‘minibus’ on September 13, 2018 that provides final funding for the Legislative Branch and two other parts of the federal government. H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019 (Public Law 115-244) provides $696.11 million in appropriations for the Library, an increase of $26.22 million above the fiscal 2018 enacted level. The Act also authorizes the Library to use $55.82 million in offsetting receipts and prior year unobligated balances for a total budget authority of $751.93 million in fiscal 2019. The minibus was signed into law on September 21. (H.R. 5895 did not include Visitor Experience funding in fiscal 2019, effectively removing $10 million in no-year authority from the requested base of $761.93 million.)\n\nCongress continued to invest in the Library’s information technology, providing over $12 million for IT enterprise modernization within the Copyright Office, $5 million to complete the development of the Copyright Office searchable historic records database, and $823,000 to digitize critical parts of the Law Library’s collections. Other programmatic Increases include:\n\nLibrary Services Special Collection Arrearage Reduction (40 FTE) – $4.02 million\n\nCRS Strengthening Capacity (20 FTE) – $2.74 million\n\nCopyright Office Registration Staffing (15 FTE) – $2.06 million\n\nCopyright Office Warehouse Move Preparation – $1.33 million\n\nOCFO System Improvements and Standardization of Legislative Branch Financial Management System – $1.13 million\n\nCopyright Office Public Records and Recordation – $1.1 million\n\nLaw Library Strengthening Capacity - Staff Expertise & Foreign Specialists (7 FTE) - $933,000\n\nOCIO Workstation Centralization Support - $250,000\n\nWhile the fiscal 2019 funding bill did not allocate additional funding to the Thomas Jefferson Building Visitors Experience project, it made substantial investments totaling more than $40 million in building repairs and improvements that had been re-requested for several years.\n\nDuring the fiscal 2019 budget cycle, appropriators expressed interest in several areas of the agency’s budget including progress in modernizing enterprise IT systems; Copyright Office IT modernization; completing the CRS (Congressional Research Service) public reports website as mandated in the previous year’s funding bill; relocating the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped closer to Capitol Hill; and learning more about the Thomas Jefferson Building Visitor Experience project.\n\nBills Recently Acted Upon\n\nS.2559 - Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act\n\nDate Introduced: 3/15/2018\n\nIntroduced by: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA)\n\nLatest Action: On 10/09/2018, became Public Law No. 115-261.\n\nThis legislation amends federal copyright law to implement the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled (Marrakesh Treaty). Specifically, it modifies the limitations and exceptions to federal copyright infringement that allow published works to be reproduced and distributed in accessible formats for individuals with print disabilities. The bill:\n\nmakes such limitations and exceptions applicable only to activities in the United States,\n\nbroadens the scope of published works that may be reproduced and distributed in accessible formats, and\n\nmodifies certain terms and definitions to conform with the Marrakesh Treaty.\n\nAdditionally, the bill adds a new section to allow published works in accessible formats to be exported and imported for individuals with print disabilities.\n\nS.3530 - Museum and Library Services Act of 2018\n\nDate Introduced: 9/28/2018\n\nIntroduced by: Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI)\n\nLatest Action: On 12/31/2018, signed by the President.\n\nS.3530 reauthorizes the originating statute for the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Museum and Library Services Act. Specific to the Library, the bill expands interagency collaboration with IMLS to include working with the Library of Congress, along with several other executive and legislative branch agencies, under 20 U.S.C. 9103(g). Areas of interagency collaboration are specified as:\n\n“initiatives, materials, or technology to support workforce development activities undertaken by libraries; ” “resource and policy approaches to eliminate barriers to fully leveraging the role of libraries and museums in supporting the early learning, literacy, lifelong learning, digital literacy, workforce development, and education needs of the people of the United States”; and “initiatives, materials, or technology to support educational, cultural, historical, scientific, environmental, and other activities undertaken by museums.”\n\nH.R. 1551, the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act\n\nDate Introduced: 9/18/2018, as amended in the Senate.\n\nIntroduced by: Tom Rice (R-SC) (unrelated underlying bill, H.R. 1551); Sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) in the Senate and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) (H.R. 5447)\n\nLatest Action: 10/11/2018, became Public Law No. 115-264.\n\nCLASSICS Act. Beginning on the date of enactment, the Act extends federal copyright protection to pre-1972 sound recordings and preempts state copyright law regarding digital audio transmission, mechanical and distribution rights for those works. It also extends the fair use exception for libraries, educators and archives to pre-1972 works.\n\nIn addition to creating a new performance right for pre-1972 works, the Act establishes a term of copyright protection for these works of at least 95 years, and moves these works into the public domain on a gradual basis through several transition periods. The last transition period covering recordings published between Jan. 1, 1957, and Feb. 15, 1972, keeps those works under federal protection until Feb. 15, 2067, at which point they will enter the public domain.\n\nThe legislation includes language to ensure that libraries and archives are able to immediately use pre-1972 sound recordings under certain conditions in 17 USC 108(h). During the last 20 years of any term of copyright of a published work, a library or archives may reproduce, distribute, display, or perform a work for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research if the institution has first determined that the work is not subject to normal commercial exploitation, cannot be obtained at a reasonable price, and that the copyright owner has not provided notice to the contrary.\n\nMusic Modernization Act. The legislation creates a blanket license for digital music providers to make permanent downloads, limited downloads, and interactive streams of sound recordings.\n\nThe Act also creates a new Music Licensing Collective to administer licenses and distribute royalties for digital music services/providers, among other responsibilities. The collective shall be a non-profit entity created by copyright owners. The Register of Copyrights shall have the authority to designate the body, with the approval of the Librarian of Congress pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 702. The Register shall make the initial designation within 270 days (approximately nine months) of enactment, and periodically review the designation every five years.\n\nAMP Act. The Allocation for Music Producers (AMP) Act allows copyright owners to distribute a portion of their statutory royalties to a producer, mixer, or sound engineer involved in the creation of the work.\n\nH.R.1695 - Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017\n\nS.1010 - Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017 Date Introduced:\n\n3/23/2017 in the House (Introduced by: Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA))\n\n5/02/2017 in the Senate (Introduced by: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA))\n\nLatest Action: On 4/26/2017, passed the House by a 378–48 vote ( Roll no. 227).\n\nOn 5/2/2017, referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\nThe Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017 would make the Register of Copyrights a presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed office. Consistent with other presidentially appointed officers, the President would have the power to remove the Register. The bill would institute a term of office for the Register of ten years. Near the end of the second session of the 115th Congress in September 2018, the Senate Rules Committee held a hearing on S. 1010 at which outside witnesses were invited to testify. The Committee scheduled markup of the bill in December that was later postponed. The bill received no further congressional action before the conclusion of the 115th Congress.\n\nCongressional Leadership: Results of 116th Congress Leadership Elections\n\nHouse Democratic Leadership Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Calif.

She also continues as Law Librarian of Congress. Within the Library Collections and Services Group, Colleen Shogan is Assistant Deputy Librarian, focusing on the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped and Internship and Fellowship Programs. Joseph Cappello is Director for Operations.\n\nINTERNSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS (IFP)\n\nOne Portal, Many Opportunities\n\nInternship and Fellowship Programs (IFP) supports the placement of new talent throughout all of the Library of Congress. In fiscal 2018, the Library hosted more than 300 interns across the agency, which would have been impossible without IFP’s coordination and management efforts. IFP supports Library staff and interns, and provides a one-stop shop for opportunity seekers through the Internships and Fellowships Portal, a publicly accessible website designed to promote opportunities and recruit candidates for the Library's many fellowship, internship, residency and volunteer opportunities. The Portal is available at URL: < www.loc.gov/ifp>\n\nArchives, History, and Heritage Advanced Internship Pilot Project\n\nThis spring the Library will pilot a new internship, in collaboration with Howard University, providing qualified master and doctoral students the opportunity to augment their academic studies through experiential learning, professional development, and mentoring while helping to organize and catalog many items in the Library’s collections. The interns will side-by-side with Library staff to learn the standards and techniques to properly arrange and provide online descriptions for three significant collections related to African-American history and culture--Rosa Parks Papers, Bruce Jackson Collection, and Alvin Ailey Dance Collection.\n\nHispanic Association of Colleges and Universities National Internship Program\n\nThe Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities National Internship Program (HNIP) has bolstered the Library’s commitment to diversity since 1999, and provided on-the-job training for more than 280 students. In spring 2019, the Library will host 17 interns across several service units, where they will work on valuable projects including those focused on communications, information management, outreach, and program management. IFP offers educational enrichment sessions that enhance each intern’s experience beyond on-the-job training and provide opportunities to explore a wide range of professional development activities and mentorships with former HNIP interns who went on to careers in federal service. Interested undergraduate and graduate students may apply from URL < www.hacu.net/hacu/HNIP.asp >\n\nJunior Fellows Summer Internship Program\n\nIn 2018, the Library hosted 40 participants in the Junior Fellows Summer Intern Program for a ten-week internship to explore the Library’s collections and tackle a range of 21st-century information management challenges. The Junior Fellows were assigned to 33 projects across the agency. The Junior Fellows’ efforts broadened access to and awareness of the Library’s unique collection, while simultaneously extending their own educational portfolios. The Library celebrated their work at the annual Display Day in late July, which showcased their projects. For more information, please visit URL < www.loc.gov/item/internships/juniorfellows>.\n\nLibrarians-in-Residence at the Library of Congress Program\n\nThe Library of Congress is pleased to continue an exciting new program into its second year: Librarians-in-Residence at the Library of Congress. The program gives early-career librarians the opportunity to gain meaningful work experience in the following areas of specialization: Acquisitions and Collection Development, Cataloging and Metadata, Collection Preservation, Reference and Instruction, and Systems and Standards. The program is open to emerging professionals who have earned, or will complete, their master’s degree within an ALA-accredited program after December 2017 and by June 2019. Applicants and other interested parties can read details of the application process on the program website, available at URL < www.loc.gov/librarians/librarians-in-residence>.\n\nUpward Bound Program\n\nSince 2000, the Library of Congress has hosted interns participating in the Harvey Mudd College Upward Bound Program-Georgetown Internship to provide mentoring that helps students understand and appreciate the opportunities available to them by earning a bachelor’s degree. In 2019, the Library will continue supporting this important learning experience where students are inspired to develop and hone their academic and professional skills. The Internship is the zenith for program participants from Harvey Mudd College, which culminates in the intensive, five-week summer session. While in D.C., students engage in a number of activities in addition to their internship, including coursework in U.S. history and literature, supervised study halls, seminars, and field trips to national monuments, historic landmarks, and colleges and universities. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nLAW LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n\nIn fiscal 2018:\n\n1,426 digitized NTSB Opinions and Orders were published on the law.gov website.\n\nDigitized volumes 43-64 (1923-1950) of the Statutes at Large were published on the law.gov website.\n\nThe digitized U.S. Reports for 1754-2004 were published on the law.gov and loc.gov “Digital Collections” websites.\n\nThe Law Library completed five two-minute videos concerning items of historical interest selected from the Law Library’s Rare Book Vault. The videos are now available on the Library’s YouTube channel. The videos discuss: George Washington's copy of the Acts of the First Session of the First Congress under the Federal Constitution of 1789; the trial of Richard Lawrence for his assassination attempt on President Andrew Jackson; the trial of Captain William Kidd for murder and piracy; the trial of Rep. Daniel Sickles for shooting Philip Barton Key; and a writ of process drafted by Abraham Lincoln during his career as an attorney.\n\nThe Law Library recently announced an update to the Library’s U.S. Congressional Web Archive, URL < blogs.loc.gov/law/2018/12/the-united-states-congressional-web-archive-now-includes-content-for-the-113th-and-114th-congresses/>\n\nThe release updated the collection to include the 113th and 114th Congresses, and also some earlier content that was acquired in a purchase of “backfile” older captures from the Internet Archive which has helped fill in some gaps in our “.gov” collections. Therefore there are also now facets for 105th and 106th archive content. Prior to this release, we had records going back to the 107th archive.\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES\n\nJoe Puccio continues as acting Associate Librarian of Congress for Library Services while a nationwide search is underway to fill the position permanently.\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES / Acquisitions and Bibliographic Access Directorate (ABA)\n\nRandall Barry, chief of the Asian and Middle Eastern Division, ABA, retired on June 29, 2018. Paul Min Soo Hahn is serving as acting chief. The vacancy for a permanent chief was posted on USAJOBS; the application period closed on Jan. 17, 2019.\n\nZbigniew Kantorosinski, chief of the Germanic and Slavic Division, retired on Dec. 31, 2018. Lucy Barron is serving as acting division chief.\n\nLinda Geisler, chief of the US/Anglo Division, retired on Jan. 3, 2019. Diana Snigurowicz is serving as acting division chief.\n\nCooperative cataloging program specialist Hien Nguyen left the Cooperative and Instructional Programs Division in March 2018 to become head of the Bibliographic Control Section, National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped. Dave Reser, after almost 20 years as a cataloging policy specialist, accepted a new position in the ILS Program Office in July 2018. In November 2018, Veronica Ranieri joined the Cooperative and Instructional Programs Division as a cooperative cataloging program specialist after working as an assistant editor in the Data Integrity Section of the Policy and Standards Division.\n\nIvey Glendon joined the Policy and Standards Division as a senior library automation specialist on January 7, 2019. She replaces Bruce Johnson, who retired in December 2017, as the Cataloger’s Desktop product manager.\n\nBIBFRAME (Bibliographic Framework Initiative)\n\nThe Network Development and MARC Standards Office (NDMSO) and the Cooperative and Instructional Programs Division (COIN) continue to work together on BIBFRAME development and testing. Approximately 60 Library of Congress catalogers are currently participating in BIBFRAME Pilot Phase Two. During fiscal 2019, the number of participants will be expanded to 100.\n\nPilot participants have been creating bibliographic descriptions in both BIBFRAME and MARC 21 for each resource they catalog. Testing includes input of bibliographic data using BIBFRAME 2.0 vocabulary, input of non-Latin scripts, and the ability to incorporate authority data. Development of a policy decision on inputting non-Latin script with limited romanization is a goal for the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nWork has also focused on providing a fuller level of interaction with a live BIBFRAME 2.0 database consisting of the complete BIBFRAME conversion of the Library of Congress bibliographic file. Features of the database include user search capability and use of linked data queries to highlight relationships between resources. Merging and matching BIBFRAME 2.0 work descriptions in the database is underway and will continue to be refined throughout 2019.\n\nWith feedback from COIN, NDMSO has developed, refined, and tested code for a number of improvements to the tools that are used in the BIBFRAME Pilot. This work included improved validation and posting of new descriptions to the BIBFRAME database from the BIBFRAME Editor, retrieving and editing previously posted descriptions (primarily brief descriptions called Initial Bibliographic Control data, or IBC), and posting the updated descriptions back to the database from the Editor. NDMSO has also worked on developing a “cloning” function for existing descriptions, to streamline the batch creation process, and has made constant improvements to the profiles for various formats of materials within the BIBFRAME Editor. Plans for the rest of 2019 include continuing to improve user interaction with these BIBFRAME Editor profiles and continuing to improve access to name/subject authority data. The bibliographic data in the BIBFRAME 2.0 database is used in combination with authority data from the LC Linked Data Service: < id.loc.gov>.\n\nCOIN and NDMSO staff members continued to exchange ideas about BIBFRAME with partners in the LD4P (Linked Data for Production) project, funded by the Mellon Foundation, and are preparing initial BIBFRAME training for the 17 Program for Cooperative Cataloging member institutions that were recently announced as members of the LD4P Cohort for the second phase of that project.\n\nCataloging in Publication (CIP) and Dewey Programs\n\nIn fiscal 2018, Library of Congress staff cataloged 45,733 CIP titles. Libraries and other members of the CIP Partnership Program contributed an additional 7,324 CIP records in fiscal 2018. The total of all CIP records cataloged in fiscal 2018 was 57,573. In October and November 2018 (fiscal 2019), an additional 7,478 CIP records were completed by Library of Congress staff and CIP Cataloging Partners contributed 1,136, for a total of 10,112 new CIP records in the first two months of fiscal 2019.\n\nCIP E-Book Program\n\nThe fiscal 2018 annual performance target for the CIP E-books Program was to ingest 5,000 new CIP e-books, but the CIP Program received 20,275 e-books. In fiscal 2019 through December 31, 2018), the CIP Program has received 5,023 e-books. The number of participating e-book publishers increased in fiscal 2018 by 75, for a total of 920 publishers. An additional 13 new publishers have been added to the CIP E-Book Program as of December 31, 2018.\n\nCIP Partnership Program\n\nDouglas County Libraries (DCL) in Colorado resigned from the CIP Partnership Program in June 2018, upon the retirement of DCL senior cataloger Nancy Kall. During its years of membership (2015-2018), DCL cataloged 139 CIP titles from selected publishers and assigned Dewey numbers as part of the cataloging. The CIP and Dewey Program heartily thanks Nancy Kall and DCL for this service to the nation’s libraries.\n\nPrePub Book Link\n\nPrePub Book Link is the name of the cloud-based system that will replace the aging ECIP Traffic Manager. The implementation date has been postponed to spring 2019. PrePub Book Link will run on a Unicode-compliant ServiceNow platform and will include enhanced functionality, such as the use of MS Word and PDF file formats for galley attachments and a MARC editor tool to convert application data to a MARC record and import into the LC Integrated Library System or OCLC. Collaborations with Bowker/ProQuest, the Book Industry Standard Group (BISG), and the ONIX Best Practices Group produced a mapping from the ONIX schema to the CIP application; this will enable a publisher to search an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) and have the ONIX metadata prepopulate much of the CIP application. Publishers participating in the Harvard Online Author Questionnaire (OAQ) will be able to include the unique URL to the OAQ entry for that author, providing richer background information about the author. Publishers can also include ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier) and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers for authors.\n\nDewey production\n\nIn fiscal 2018, the Library of Congress Dewey Program assigned Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) to 47,059 bibliographic records; an additional 16,977 CIP e-book records also were assigned Dewey numbers. Northwestern University, Douglas County Libraries, Queens Library, and the U.S. Government Publishing Office, all members of the CIP Cataloging Partnership Program, assigned DDC to 1,780 CIP records. A total of 4,637 DDC numbers were semi-automatically assigned by the AutoDewey software program, and 4,651 were added to ISSN records. In addition, 43,990 records processed via the copy cataloging workstream included DDC, identified in the MARC 082 field with a second indicator 4. The fiscal 2018 total for all DDC assigned in LC records was 119,094. As of December 31, 2018, DDC had been assigned to 19,610 LC records in fiscal 2019.\n\nIn addition to DDC assignment, Dewey classifiers added Library of Congress Classification to 1,442 ECIPs cataloged by the National Library of Medicine. Dewey classifiers also completed the subject cataloging (assignment of LCSH, LC Classification, and shelflisting) for 598 ECIPs.\n\nDDC Editorial Pilot Project\n\nThe OCLC Dewey editors are starting a pilot to provide community members with an opportunity to assist in the editorial process; as members of this community, LC’s Dewey classifiers are taking a more active role in editorial work. Dewey editors perform most of their editorial projects in the Editorial Support System (ESS). Dewey editors have provided LC classifiers with read-only access to ESS and a training session on its use. The editors continue to send the agenda and related documents for the weekly editorial meeting to keep Dewey classifiers informed of projects, and classifiers have an open invitation to attend these meetings and provide comments on documents. Classifiers and editors continue to meet as a group at monthly meetings.\n\nProfessional activities\n\nCaroline Saccucci, CIP/Dewey Program Manager, serves on the IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) Standing Committee on Subject Analysis and Access (IFLA SC SAA), is on the planning committee for the open session to be held at the IFLA World Library and Information Congress 2019 in Athens, Greece; this will be a joint open session with the IFLA Art Libraries Section.\n\nCaroline Saccucci attended the Dewey Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee (EPC) meeting 141 at OCLC Headquarters, Dublin, Ohio , October 15-16, 2018, as the Library of Congress representative to the EPC. She gave the reports for the Library of Congress and the LC Dewey Program. She also submitted an article for the December 2018 [PDF] issue of the IFLA Metadata Newsletter about the activities and decisions at EPC-141; her co-author was Elise Conradi, National Library of Norway, European Dewey User Group (EDUG) representative to EPC, and secretary of the IFLA SC SAA.\n\nHispanic Colleges and Universities National Intern Program (HACU/NIP) intern Amanda Martinez served her internship in the LC Dewey Program, August 27-December 7, 2018. She was fully trained to assign Dewey classification for works selected for the Handbook of Latin American Studies. During her internship, she classified 1,084 books, primarily in Spanish, with some in English. She also took advantage of shadowing opportunities with Library staff who perform selection for the Handbook as well as the editorial staff of the Handbook.\n\nCataloging Policy and Standards\n\n“Multiple” Subdivisions\n\nThe better to support linked-data initiatives, the Policy and Standards Division has begun a project to cancel “multiple” subdivisions from Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). “Multiple” subdivisions are a special type of subdivision that automatically gives free-floating status to analogous subdivisions used under the same heading.\n\nStaff in PSD will cancel the multiple subdivisions from LCSH and create individual authority records for each valid, complete heading string that was created based on a multiple subdivision. PSD wishes to be as comprehensive as possible when making authority records based on heading strings used in bibliographic records; OCLC Research is assisting in this effort by providing lists of the headings used in bibliographic records in OCLC.\n\nThe authority records generated by this project are being added to LCSH in batches beginning in the first quarter of 2019, and the records will be distributed through the MARC Distribution Service’s Subject‐Authorities product. Subject‐Authorities subscribers should expect that some weekly distributions may total more than 1,000 records. More information, including interim instructions for catalogers using these subdivisions, is available at URL < www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/multiplescancellationproject.html>.\n\nStatistics in Summaries of Decisions\n\nSummaries of decisions explain why individual proposals for classification numbers, subject headings, genre/form terms, etc., that appeared on LCSH Tentative Lists were not accepted, and they occasionally also contain announcements related to subject cataloging and classification. Beginning with the Summary for October 2018, summaries of decisions now include statistics on the approximate number of proposals that were approved on the list, as well as the number that were not approved, not necessary, or marked resubmit.\n\nQualifiers in Subject Headings for Individual Kurd, Arab, and Berber Groups\n\nIn LCSH, the general policy is to qualify headings for individual ethnic groups by the adjective for the continent, region, or country of the group, followed by the word “people”, e.g., Aro (African people; Chrau (Vietnamese people). Practice for Kurds, Arabs, and Berbers has been mixed, however, with some being qualified by ([Arab, Berber, Kurdish] tribe) and others by ([Arab, Berber, Kurdish] people). Going forward, all new headings of this type will be qualified according to the latter formulation.\n\nCatalogers making proposals to edit existing headings for another reason (e.g., to add another UF reference) should also propose that the heading be revised if necessary to follow the new guidance. LC will undertake a project to systematically revise existing headings whose qualifiers include the word “tribe.” PSD therefore requests that catalogers not submit proposals merelyfor this purpose, and that they not purposely seek out headings to which other revisions can be proposed, solely to justify changing the heading.\n\nGenre/Form Terms for Filmed and Televised Works\n\nGenre/form terms in the form Filmed […] and Televised […], along with some others that were constructed in a similar style (e.g., Filmed plays; Televised operas; Radio debates), were approved during the early stages of the development of Library of Congress Genre-Form Terms (LCGFT) because the base term (e.g., Drama; Operas; Debates) did not yet exist, and the terms were needed to catalog audio-visual materials. With the completion of the literature, music, and general LCGFT projects, many of the terms are no longer necessary and were cancelled on Tentative List 12 (2018). Each of the 37 cancelled terms has been retained as a “former heading” UF (reference) to its replacement term(s). For example, Filmed interviews has been cancelled and is now a former heading UF to Interviews and Nonfiction films, which should be assigned instead.\n\nTerms of this type that represent high-level collocation points (e.g., Filmed performances) remain valid for use, as do terms for which it is not possible to make a base term. As an example of the latter, Filmed baseball games is still valid because a baseball game is not a genre or a form.\n\nScope Notes for the “Broadest Terms” in LCGFT\n\nEleven “broadest terms” in LCGFT–the terms that represent the top level of a discipline, such as Radio programs and Law materials–were given scope notes indicating that they could be used only for collections “that are composed of multiple genres and/or forms to which more specific headings” cannot be applied. The scope notes essentially restated the principle of specificity, which is explained in instruction sheet J 110 of the draft manual for LCGFT. The notes were unnecessary and were removed on Tentative List 12 (2018).\n\nMoratorium on LCDGT Proposals\n\nLibrary of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT) is intended to describe the creators of, and contributors to, resources, and also the intended audience of resources. Terms may be assigned in bibliographic records and in authority records for works and expressions.\n\nThe moratorium on proposals for new and revised terms that was enacted in February 2018 is still in place while PSD thoroughly evaluates LCDGT’s structure and principles.\n\nLibrary of Congress-Program for Cooperative Cataloging Policy Statements\n\nSince the text of the RDA Toolkit is currently “frozen” while the preparations for the 3R (RDA Toolkit Restructure and Redesign) Project continue (see URL < www.rdatoolkit.org/3Rproject >), the LC-PCC Policy Statements are frozen as well. Should it become necessary to issue new or revised policy statements prior to the release of the 3R Project, they will be posted at URL < www.loc.gov/aba/rda/lcps_access.html>.\n\nLC Guidelines Supplement to the MARC 21 Format for Authority Data\n\nIn October 2018, an appendix was added, describing the process by which changes to the MARC 21 Format for Authority Data are implemented in the LC/NACO name authority file (LC/NAF) as well as the authority files for LCSH, LCGFT, Library of Congress Medium of Performance Thesaurus (LCMPT), and LCDGT.\n\nDescriptive Cataloging Manual\n\nZ12, Special Projects for Name Authority Records and Bibliographic Records was added to the Descriptive Cataloging Manual in October 2018. DCM Z12 provides background information and instructions about special projects for authority records in the LC/NAF such as the Dance Heritage Coalition Access Project and the Pinyin Conversion Project. Z12 also contains information about LC bibliographic records changed during these projects. Z12 should be used in conjunction with Z1 and other appropriate cataloging documents for authority work.\n\nCataloger’s Desktop\n\nWork is currently underway to incorporate the updated RDA: Resource Description & Access into Cataloger’s Desktop. As many are aware, the organization of and access to RDA are being significantly revised on the RDA Toolkit site. This has significant implications for Cataloger’s Desktop subscribers who subscribe to both services. The Cataloger’s Desktop team is working with ALA to account for these changes so that seamless access is provided and full Cataloger’s Desktop functionality is provided to RDA. Once the new RDA is ready for use within RDA Toolkit, it will be provided to Desktop subscribers who are also Toolkit subscribers. Both the legacy RDA file, as well as the new version, will be available during the transition period. More information will be provided as ALA publicizes its plans for rolling out the new RDA file.\n\nThe new Cataloger’s Desktop product manager, Ivey Glendon, would be happy to hear from subscribers to know how we can improve Cataloger’s Desktop. Suggestions for new content or improved features should be emailed to: ivgl@loc.gov. Subscribe to the free Cataloger’s Desktop discussion list at URL < www.loc.gov/cds/desktop/ugroup.html>.\n\nChildren’s and Young Adults Cataloging (CYAC)\n\nSummer Teachers’ Institute\n\nFor the first time, librarians from the U.S. Programs, Law, and Literature Division Children’s and Young Adults’ Cataloging (CYAC) Program had a table at the Summer Teachers’ Institute Open House. The Summer Teachers’ Institute provided an opportunity for the CYAC team to promote and discuss their work with teachers and junior fellows. It was an opportunity for them to learn about what the CYAC Program has to offer teachers, particularly those from elementary, middle, and secondary schools. The CYAC librarians connected teachers and junior fellows to program resources available on the CYAC website, URL < www.loc.gov/aba/cyac>, and provided a contact for future questions.\n\nOpen Access At-Risk Children’s Literature eBook Pilot\n\nThe USPRLL Literature Section collaborated with the Library’s Digital Content Management Section to catalog 25 at-risk open access children’s literature eBooks. The results of this pilot will be used to assess whether additional at-risk eBooks can be cataloged in production mode.\n\nCooperative Cataloging\n\nNational Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections (NUCMC)\n\nThe Cooperative and Instructional Programs Division (COIN) continues to oversee the NUCMC program, through which catalogers at the Library of Congress create bibliographic records in OCLC WorldCat, and associated authority records, for the archival collections of repositories that meet the program’s eligibility requirements. A NUCMC cataloger and a COIN staff member have been trained to contribute data to the Social Network in Authority Context (SNAC) project, hosted by the National Archives and Records Administration and the University of Virginia, and during this pilot phase will be evaluating the SNAC interface for its potential usefulness for describing NUCMC collections.\n\nProgram for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC)\n\nThe Cooperative Programs Section in COIN continues to serve as the secretariat for the Program for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), an international consortium of approximately 700 libraries and other institutions that sets cataloging standards, delivers training, and supports innovations in cataloging and bibliographic formats. The PCC has four component programs: NACO, the Name Authority Cooperative; SACO, the Subject Authority Cooperative (including cooperative contributions to LCSH and Library of Congress Classification); BIBCO, the monographic Bibliographic Cooperative; and CONSER, the Serial bibliographic record component. A list of the 71 institutions and funnels that joined these programs during Library of Congress fiscal year 2018, including 12 from outside the United States, is available on the PCC website, URL < www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/stats/NewMembersByProgram.pdf> (PDF, 53 KB).\n\nThe PCC Policy Committee met November 1-2, 2018, at the Library of Congress. Highlights of the meeting included updates on the PCC ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier) Pilot Project, BIBFRAME development, changes to RDA: Resource Description & Access as a result of LRM (Library Reference Model, a recent standard from the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) and the 3R Project (RDA Toolkit Restructureand Redesign Project), plans for moving forward with the optional omission of ISBD punctuation in new PCC bibliographic records, and reports on the work of standing committees and task groups on such topics as linked data, identity management, and engaging and broadening the PCC community. A summary of the outcomes of the meeting has been posted: URL < www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/PoCo-2018/PoCo-2018-Outcomes.pdf> (PDF, 133 KB).\n\nSeventeen PCC institutions have been selected to participate in the second phase of LD4P (Linked Data for Production), a project based at Stanford University and funded by the Mellon Foundation to foster adoption and implementation of linked data. Representatives of these “LD4P Cohort” institutions met with the LD4P project partners (Cornell, Harvard, and Stanford) on Oct. 15-16, 2018, at the Library of Congress. A cloud-based sandbox environment, called Sinopia, is being developed for use in the creation of linked data by LD4P participants, and it will eventually be open to all PCC members for experimentation. Training is also being developed.\n\nA new PCC Communication Board has been appointed, for a one-year pilot project. The Board is producing a quarterly bulletin called the “PCC Comm Channel” to keep the PCC membership informed of program developments. The first two issues have been posted: URL < www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/communication>.\n\nImplementation of a new PCC Directory system was completed in fall 2018. All PCC member institutions and funnel coordinators are now using their Directory profiles to maintain contact information, record PCC statistics, and participate in PCC elections.\n\nDewey Program\n\nSee under Cataloging in Publication and Dewey Programs\n\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number)\n\n43rd Meeting of Directors of ISSN Centres\n\nThe U.S. ISSN Center [sic], part of the USPRLL Division in ABA, hosted the 43rd Meeting of Directors of ISSN Centres [sic] at the Library of Congress during the week of September 17, 2018. Dr. Carla Hayden, Librarian of Congress, and Principal Deputy Librarian, Mark Sweeney, opened the meeting and greeted the 30 participants who represented 23 ISSN centers worldwide. Participants came from as far away as Nepal, Japan, Indonesia, and China. Among the ISSN centers participating remotely were Vietnam and Iran.\n\nThe working meeting included technical discussions on enlarging the scope of publications eligible for ISSN, the current revision of the ISO ISSN standard, and how to deal with multinational and predatory publishers in a global environment and country-based ISSN Network. The week also included presentations about BIBFRAME and the Library’s digital strategy, tours of the Library’s Thomas Jefferson Building and the preservation labs, and a display of serial treasures from the Library’s Serial and Government Publications Division.\n\nSocial events included a walking tour of the national mall, an afternoon reception for participants and LC staff in the Whittall Pavilion, and an evening “Wild West Barbeque” in the Jefferson Building that was sponsored in part by donations from the American Psychological Association, Annual Reviews, Bloomberg Law, EBSCO, Elsevier, the H.W. Wilson Foundation, JSTOR, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., Springer Nature, and Wiley.\n\nThe Library of Congress is one of the earliest members of the ISSN Network and hosted the first directors meeting in 1974. The Library also hosted meetings in 1983 and 2000. As Mark Sweeney noted in his remarks, hosting this meeting was an example of LC’s strategic theme of connecting. The meeting enhanced the Library’s international outreach, demonstrated support for its commitment to international standards, and helped to publicize its digital strategy and BIBFRAME projects.\n\nISO Ballot on ISO/FDIS8, Presentation and identification of periodicals\n\nThis ballot to approve a final draft of ISO 8 closes on February 14, 2019. The ballot states: “This document establishes the minimum characteristics required for the presentation and identification of periodicals including not only the obvious traditional elements that print periodicals typically display (e.g. title, ISSN, publisher, date), but also the “footprints” of periodicals published on digital dynamic media that enable them to be traced along the path of their history, such as changes of URL and publisher or content provider. Furthermore, this document provides information about persistent identifiers, using ISSN, and citation of periodicals (especially when published online or digitized and when titles have changed). It also makes specific recommendations for presentation and identification aspects of retrospective digitization of periodicals.” Regina Reynolds, director of the U.S. ISSN Center at the Library of Congress, is a member of the ISO working group.\n\nThis document defines and promotes the use of a standard code (ISSN) for the unique identification of serials and other continuing resources.\n\nISO Ballot “Approval of ISO/DIS 3297 for Publication” This first ballot on the draft of the revised version of the ISSN Standard closes March 14, 2019. ISO/DIS 3297, Information and documentation - International standard serial number (ISSN) “defines and promotes the use of a standard code (ISSN) for the unique identification of serials and other continuing resources.” Regina Reynolds is a member of the ISO working group.\n\nISSN and Copyright for U.S. Newspapers The U.S. ISSN Center is working with the U.S. Copyright Office by assigning ISSN to U.S. newspapers that deposit “e-prints” as part of new group registration requirements. A workflow is also being determined for assigning ISSN to newspaper e-prints under special relief agreements.\n\nSee also Copyright Office /Rulemakings and Regulations\n\nSee also “Changes in Copyright Deposit Requirements for Print Newspapers” under Serial and Government Publications Division\n\nLaw Cataloging\n\nLegal Cataloging Forum\n\nClara Liao, head of the USPRLL Law Section, hosted the 3rd Legal Cataloging Forum. Ms. Liao presented information on BIBFRAME vs. MARC in the legal cataloging environment. Jesse Lambertson, Georgetown Law Library and Robert Bratton, George Washington Law Library, presented on “How do we get there from here” about library ILS system migration process and issues. More than 40 law institutions now participate in the forums either onsite or via WebEx.\n\n2019 AALL Preparations\n\nThe USPRLL Law Section is actively engaged in preparations for the 2019 AALL (American Association of Law Libraries) conference which will be held in Washington, D.C. Clara Liao’s program proposal “Things You Need to Know Before Moving to a New ILS” has been accepted as a deep dive program for the conference.\n\nOverseas Operations\n\nMuthoni wa (Alice) Gichuru, a Kenyan author who writes books for children and young adults, was declared the winner of the CODE Burt Prize for African Young Adult Literature Kenya 2018 on Sept. 28, 2018, for her story “The Carving.” The prestigious literary prize focuses on acknowledging creative writing in the overlooked genre of young adult fiction. Muthoni wa Gichuru is an administrative assistant in the Library’s Nairobi Office. The ABA Directorate manages the six overseas offices in Cairo, Egypt; Islamabad, Pakistan; Jakarta, Indonesia; Nairobi, Kenya; New Delhi, India; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The offices provide acquisitions, cataloging, and selected preservation services in countries where the book trade is not well developed and in languages for which the Library does not have expertise on its Washington, D.C., campus.\n\nFehl Cannon was appointed field director of the Library’s office in Islamabad, Pakistan, effective July 22. He had served as acting field for the previous year.\n\nThe Library plans to merge the Washington-based staff of the Overseas Operations Division with the Acquisitions Fiscal and Support Office in 2019. Both these small ABA units handle fiscal and statistical activities, making it logical and efficient to merge them.\n\nLibrary of Congress Acquisitions and Cataloging Production\n\nAcquisitions Work FY2018 FY2017 Items purchased for LC collections 559,467 647,999 Items acquired for LC by non-purchase 1,470,000 1,472,501 Expenditures for collections purchases $22,700,000 $23,900,000\n\nBibliographic Records Completed FY2018 FY2017 Original 189,255 209,213 Collection-level cataloging 1,060 1,395 Copy cataloging 77,598 85,623 Minimal level cataloging 25,222 75,976 Total records completed 293,135 372,207 Total volumes cataloged 305,955 389,040\n\nAuthority Work FY2018 FY2017 New name authority records 88,411 72,991 New LC Subject Headings 2,221 2,664 New LC Classification Numbers 2,100 2,306 Total authority records created 92,732 76,927\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES / Collection Development Office\n\nThe mission of the Collection Development Office (CDO) is to support the Library’s strategic goal to acquire and maintain a universal collection of knowledge and the record of America’s creativity to meet the needs of Congress, researchers and the American public. It also ensures that the Library's analog and digital collections reflect the breadth and depth of knowledge published in all media, languages, and regions of the world.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, CDO continued its program to review and update on a cyclical basis all of the Library’s Collections Policy Statements and associated Supplementary Guidelines. Ten documents were updated and reposted. Two new documents were developed, approved and posted: Classics and the Ancient, Medieval, and Byzantine Worlds; and Independently Published & Self-Published Textual Materials (Supplementary Guidelines).\n\nCDO facilitated the customization of fourteen different foreign acquisitions approval plans, including those for China, Germany, Japan (Humanities and Social Sciences), Japan (Sciences) and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs part of its focus on foreign newspapers, CDO issued a report, “LC’s Foreign Newspapers Holdings: Discovery Challenges and Recommended Actions.” Targeted actions were recommended to address specific issues, including the fact that many existing foreign newspaper microfilm holdings do not appear in the Library’s catalog.\n\nProgress continued in implementing the Library’s Digital Collecting Plan:\n\nCopyright group registration of newspaper e-prints was established\n\nA group was formed to develop and pilot workflows for the routine acquisition of digital content via purchase and gift. The group has submitted its report with recommendations.\n\nThe Openly Available, Endangered Content Working Group was formed to examine issues regarding the Library’s acquisition of such materials. The group has submitted its report with recommendations.\n\nThe Data Sets Working Group was established to address related targets in the Digital Collecting Plan.\n\nThe records for all electronic resources represented in the Electronic Resources Online Catalog were updated by CDO to show their acquisition source – purchased ownership, subscription, etc.\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES / Collections and Services Directorate\n\nSee also General and International Collections Directorate (Library Services)\n\nSee also Special Formats Collections Directorate (Library Services)\n\nThe Collections and Services Directorate was reorganized, effective October 1, 2018. Its fourteen divisions remain intact but are now organized within two new directorates, with one division realigned to the office of the Associate Librarian for Library Services.\n\nThe new General and International Collections directorate is led by Eugene Flanagan, formerly Director of National Programs in NIO. The new Special Collections directorate is led by Helena Zinkham, formerly director of Collections and Services. The Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, including the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, is now part of the office of the Associate Librarian for Library Services, with specific focus on the acquisition, cataloging and preservation of our audio-visual formats.\n\nThe re-organization is intended to provide Library Services and its staff with more manageable supervisory, operational, and administrative responsibilities as they continue to build, steward, and share the collections with researchers and the general public.\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES / General and International Collections Directorate\n\nDonna Brearcliffe was appointed special assistant to the director for General and International Collections, effective October 29, 2018.\n\nAsian Division\n\nThe division is overseeing the cataloging and digitization of the Yong Le Encyclopedia collection of 41 volumes, setting the stage to make the collection available on the Library’s website. By late 2019 the Asian Division will increase access to Chinese Rare Books Collection by launching the online presentation of 500 of 1,039 titles of our eHan-scanned Chinese rare books. The division intends to introduce the ACS (Automated Call Slip) system to allow users to request Asian Division materials directly through the LC catalog.\n\nAfrican and Middle East Division\n\nThe Omar Ibn Said Collection is a 2017 acquisition of the African Section of the African and Middle Eastern Division of the Library of Congress. It contains 42 items. In the center of this collection is the manuscript autobiography of Omar Ibn Said (ca. 1770-1863), a Muslim scholar who was captured in West Africa and brought to Charleston, South Carolina, as a slave in 1807 at the age of 37. Accompanying his autobiography are 41 items, most of which were originally assembled by Theodore Dwight, an abolitionist and a founding member of the American Ethnological Society. The items have been undergone major conservation, and have been digitized and made available online. The official launch is January 14, 2019, at URL < www.loc.gov/collections/omar-ibn-said-collection/about-this-collection/list-of-items-in-the-collection>.\n\nThe Sultan Abdul Hamid II Collection is an 1884 gift to the Library of Congress from the Ottoman Sultan in Istanbul. It consists of Ottoman Turkish, Persian and Arabic works of native authorship and also includes translations from European languages of works on medicine, history, law, mathematics, arts, drama, and fiction, etc. In 2018, a total of 309 books and serials were digitized and the official launch of the website makes these rare items available to the world at URL < www.loc.gov/collections/abdul-hamid-ii-books/about-this-collection>.\n\nEuropean Division\n\nThe European Division digitized 75 Ukrainian telephone directories and several Croatian directories and made them available online, after clearing digital rights. They will soon be listed on the webpage European Address/Telephone Directories at the Library of Congress: Indexes and Digitized Versions, URL < https://guides.loc.gov/european> but at present can be viewed at URL < www.loc.gov/search/?q=group%3Ageneral-collections-scan-on-demand-new&fa=subject%3Atelephone+directories&sb=title_s>. These directories are of great interest to Americans tracing their family history, as well as to historians, biographers, and genealogists.\n\nThe European Division is developing, through web archiving, the East European Government Ministries Web Archive, which seeks to capture federal-level government sites for Eastern European countries. For Russia, the project goes further, reaching into administrative districts, including coverage of the annexed “Republic of Crimea” and the republics in the Caucasus; more than 1,500 Russian government websites have been crawled so far. For future researchers, the project provides detailed information produced by the governments of Russia and Eastern Europe, as well as also snapshots of the complicated structures of these governments.\n\nHispanic Division\n\nGeorgette Dorn retired as chief of the division in September 2018. Suzanne Schadl is the new chief of the Hispanic Division. The division will be more involved with REFORMA and is in the process of requesting an event for ALA 2019 Annual Conference.\n\nResearcher and Reference Services Division (RRS)\n\nMichelle McSween Sellars was appointed head of the History & Genealogy Section, Researcher and Reference Services Division, effective July 22, 2018. She was formerly a supervisor in the Washington, D.C., Public Library system.\n\nMarissa Ball was appointed head of the Humanities & Social Services Section, Researcher and Reference Services Division, effective August 18, 2018. She formerly was head of reference and information services at Florida International University.\n\nThe division has reorganized to align services more effectively with demand, and has integrated 27 librarians into new teams; reassigned subject specialties; hired new staff members; aligned reader registration and congressional and interlibrary loans; implemented electronic scheduling software; and established a Saturday duty officer role and rotation for the Library’s general reading rooms.\n\nThe division is working to improve reader registration as an integral first step of the research process for on-site researchers in the Library by providing registration in two buildings, hiring additional staff, and conducting a survey, that yielded 3,124 responses, to better understand users and create an enhanced users experience. Additionally, RRS created new informational tools including two videos to inform researchers about library resources available to them with a Reader Registration Card.\n\nThe division shared the national collection with an increasing number of users by: loaning/circulating 254,060 items to Congress, congressional staff, special groups, national and international libraries, and onsite researchers; interacting with 506,502 Library users across formats, locations, and mediums; hosting 9,268 people during two holiday open houses; and issuing more than 70,000 new reader registration cards in fiscal 2018.\n\nSerial and Government Publications Division (SER)\n\nSER continued the Library’s participation in the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) and selected 94 percent of physical items offered to depository libraries.\n\nIn late May 2018 the Library announced that collector and entrepreneur Stephen A. Geppi had donated to LC more than 3,000 items from his vast personal collection of comic books and popular art. In August 2018, the division received 930 items, comprised of newspapers, magazines, and comic books.\n\nThrough a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Small Press Expo (SPX), the Division continued to acquire by donation items--including award-winning websites--from creators participating in the 2018 SPX annual expo.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, the new division blog, Headlines and Heroes, went live, with 26 weekly updates in total for the remainder of fiscal 2018.\n\nThe National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) currently has 46 states and territories contributing, with LC, more than 14.5 million pages published between 1789 and 1963 to the collection, including ethnic news press from across the country in 18 languages. In 2018, the NEH announced the addition of the University of Alabama to the program as well as supplemental funding for 17 existing participants. Interested members of the library community and the public may subscribe at URL < www.loc.gov/subscribe/#newspapers >. Twitter users can follow @librarycongress, using #ChronAm to discover highlights of the collection.\n\nThe division continued its series of research pages called Topics in Chronicling America, commonly referred to as Topics Pages, designed to aid users of the NDNP’s Chronicling America. Topics Pages (URL < /research-centers/newspaper-and-current-periodical/about-this-research-center/ >) focus on newsworthy historic events reported in the American press and searchable in Chronicling America.\n\nChanges in Copyright Deposit Requirements for Print Newspapers In March 2018, the U.S. Copyright Office began requiring deposit of digital facsimiles in place of microfilm for print newspapers registering for copyright protection using the Group Registration of Newspapers option (i.e., a registration process where newspaper publishers are able to register copyright for 1 month of newspaper issues at one time under a single registration and at reduced per issue cost). See final Notice of Rulemaking in US Federal Register, URL < www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-01-30/pdf/2018-01838.pdf > [PDF]. These digital deposits, referred to as e-prints, must be submitted in issue-level PDF format and include searchable text, among other technical requirements as described in the rule. Publishers may continue to deposit microfilm, in addition to the required e-prints, until December 2019. In addition, in the near future, the Library will accept similar newspaper e-prints in fulfillment of mandatory deposit obligations (under special relief agreement) for publishers who no longer produce microfilm.\n\nLIBRARY SERVICES / Office of the Chief Operating Officer\n\nStephen Short was appointed Supervisory Business Analyst, Office of the Chief Operating Officer, Library Services, effective Aug. 18, 2018.\n\nIntegrated Library System Program Office (ILSPO)\n\nLC Integrated Library System\n\nThe Library is currently running the LC Integrated Library System (ILS) on Voyager 8.2.0 and is planning to upgrade to Voyager 10.1 in 2019.\n\nPlanning for the Future\n\nThe Library is conducting market research for a next generation library services platform with vendors to learn about technology trends and developments for library collection management products. Staff throughout the Library have identified high-level business needs with the goal of issuing a Request For Information (RFI) in 2019.\n\nMetadata Management\n\nIn the interim while conducting market research, the ILS Program Office has stepped up its efforts to migrate legacy descriptive metadata into the ILS from silos. In fiscal 2018 the ILS Program Office completed the migration of 168,000 bibliographic records from stand-alone databases to the LC ILS.\n\nThe ILS Program Office has pioneered the use within the Library of technology tools to edit and enhance datasets. The ILS Program Office is working with colleagues in the Digital Collections Management and Services Division (DCMS) and the Office of the Chief Information Officer to plan for the ingest, management and description of e-newspapers and e-books via Copyright e-deposit.\n\nLCCN Permalink\n\nLCCN Permalink (URL < lccn.loc.gov>),a web service that allows users to create permanent URL links to bibliographic and authority records in the Library of Congress Online Catalog (URL < catalog.loc.gov>) and the Library’s Handbook of Latin American Studies Catalog (hlasopac.loc.gov), enables researchers to reference materials from the Library's collections in blogs, reference guides, web pages, emails, bibliographies, and more. In 2018, the LCCN Permalink web service supported more than 264 million requests for bibliographic and authority metadata found in the LC Online Catalog, the LC Authorities Service, and the Handbook of Latin American Studies.\n\nLC EAD (Encoded Archival Description) Archival Finding Aids\n\nIn 2018, custodial divisions created 60 new EAD archival finding aids, bringing the total number of LC EAD finding aids to 2,493. Included among the new finding aids is the Henriette D. Avram MARC development collection, 1964-1989, the first finding aid of the LC Archives collections. Users can access 69.1 million archival items in LC's collections through these documents at URL: findingaids.loc.gov. More than 70 finding aids are also integrated with the Library’s digital collection presentations. In June 2018, the Library made available EAD3 transformations of all its EAD2002 finding aids at the findingaids.loc.gov site.\n\nLC Persistent Identifiers\n\nThe Library uses handle server technology to assign persistent identifiers and manage LC’s born-digital content. LC staff registered 50,042 handles since January 1, 2018. As of January 2019, the Library’s handle server contained 4,043,972 handles. Over the past year, LC staff assigned handles to: born digital resources stored in the Library’s digital repository and materials digitized by the Library and its partners; U.S. legislation searchable in congress.gov; and digital books created by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.\n\nIn April 2018, the Library upgraded its handle server platform, enabling support for multiple IP-based resolution of LC handles. In 2018 more than 9.6 million requests were processed by LC’s handle server.\n\nElectronic Resource Management System (ERMS)\n\nThe Library’s Electronic Resource Management System provides access to electronic journals, e-books and databases from 1,818 resource collections, totaling over a million titles.
