        "text": "Let the grandstanding begin. We mentioned a while back that the navigators and guides that will be hired in Arkansas as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would likely be a political lightning rod for Republicans.\n\nWho’s ready to debate the “private option” all over again? Attorney General Dustin McDaniel today approved the popular name and ballot title for a proposed referendum on the healthcare legislation passed by a super-majority in the House and Senate and signed into law by Gov. Mike Beebe last April.\n\nWasn’t intending to have an all-Huckabee day, but the hits just keep on coming. Quoth the Huck:\n\nThis is why the legalization of same-sex marriage is going to be a much bigger issue than just saying we let people love whoever they want to love.\n\nIt’s time for churches to reject tax exempt status completely; freedom is more important than government financial favors.— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 11, 2013\n\nThought this was worth a separate post: former Gov. Mike Huckabee recently tweeted a message more blunt than his comments at the speech last night.\n\nAbout an hour after news broke that Highway Commissioner John Burkhalter is running for lieutenant governor, the Democratic field has now doubled: Little Rock School Board member Dianne Curry will join the race.\n\nESPN’s Brett McMurphy reports that Little Rock is on the shortlist of cities being considered to begin hosting bowl games for the smaller college football conferences in 2014."
