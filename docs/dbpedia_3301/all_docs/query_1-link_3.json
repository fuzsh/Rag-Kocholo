        "text": "All Southern Baptist members of Congress participating in the Nov. 8 election successfully defended their seats.\n\nThree senators and 26 representatives – all members of Southern Baptist churches – won re-election. With three other senators who were not up for re-election, Southern Baptists will count at least 32 of their own in the Senate and House of Representatives when the next Congress convenes in January. Some Southern Baptists whom Baptist Press (BP) is unaware of may have been elected for the first time.\n\nFive Southern Baptist members of the House either retired, lost in a primary or fell short in races for other offices.\n\nReps. Randy Neugebauer of Texas and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia retired. Seven-term Rep. Randy Forbes of Virginia failed to regain his seat when he fell short in the Republican primary. Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana failed to qualify Nov. 8 for the run-off for a Senate seat. Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana lost in the GOP primary for the Senate.\n\nThe three Southern Baptist senators who gained re-election are Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas, Roy Blunt of Missouri and James Lankford of Oklahoma.\n\nSouthern Baptists held 40 seats in Congress after the 2012 election, reaching what appears to have been the largest Southern Baptist contingent ever on Capitol Hill.\n\nFollowing is a list, as compiled by BP, of the ballot results for members of Southern Baptist churches who sought re-election to Congress. (The vote totals are from Politico’s website, with the Associated Press as the source. Some races had more than two candidates on the ballot, but only the top two finishers are included in these results.)\n\nSenate\n\nArkansas: Sen.
