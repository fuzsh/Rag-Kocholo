        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC – Senator James Lankford (R-OK), chair of the Senate Values Action Team, shared numerous statements of support for the Conscience Protection Act following his request for unanimous consent that was blocked by Democrats. Lankford led his colleagues in a floor event to ask for unanimous consent to pass commonsense bills that protect women’s health and affirm life. This floor event comes ahead of the two-year anniversary of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. He sounded the alarm on the Biden Administration’s refusal to enforce conscience protections and stressed the importance of the Conscience Protection Act to protect health care providers and insurance plans from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions.\n\nLankford is joined on the Conscience Protection Act by Senators Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Hoeven, (R-ND), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Jim Risch (R-ID), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Rounds, (R-SD), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Thune (R-SD), Pete Ricketts (R-NE), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Joni Ernst, (R-IA), Ted Budd (R-NC), Mike Lee (R-UT), John Boozman (R-AR), and Markwayne Mullin (R-OK).\n\nHere’s What They Are Saying…\n\nConcerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee\n\n“The freedom to act according to your conscience, to your sincerely held beliefs, is a fundamental American freedom. No provider should be forced to perform a procedure that violates those beliefs, especially a procedure that permanently alters or ends life. Yet in our current political culture, those who don’t agree with the Administration’s radical policies on abortion are unlawfully discriminated against. Thank you to Senator Lankford and his colleagues for standing for the religious rights of all Americans,” said Penny Nance, President and CEO of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee.\n\nEthics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention\n\n“Southern Baptists believe that ‘God alone is Lord of the conscience.’ Because of that reality, it is essential that healthcare professionals have strengthened conscience protections as they seek to provide care for others in a way that is consistent with their deepest convictions. We are thankful for Senator Lankford’s continued leadership in championing the Conscience Protection Act, which would provide critical assistance in curbing conscience abuses across the country,” said Brent Leatherwood, President, Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nAmerican Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists Action\n\n“AAPLOG Action wholeheartedly endorses the Conscience Protection Act, which would ensure that no medical professional or medical facility will be forced to participate in induced abortions or other procedures that violate their conscience. Not only does Senator Lankford’s legislation ensure we can continue to provide excellent care to all our patients, it also gives medical professionals an avenue to advocate for ourselves if we are forced to violate our conscience, instead of having to rely on federal agencies that are often corrupted by politics. This is essential, especially as the Biden Administration works to strip away much-needed conscience protections,” said Dr. Christina Francis, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG)\n\nSusan B. Anthony Pro-Life America\n\n“We are proud to stand with Senator Lankford—a firm defender of unborn life and pro-life Americans—as he reintroduces the Conscience Protection Act. We’re thankful for the bill’s comprehensive definition of ‘health care providers.’ This is a necessary response to the Biden Administration’s far reaching abortion agenda and reckless decision to turn every post office and pharmacy into an abortion center by forcing dangerous abortion drugs on innocent women. Women need help and care—not a prescription for high-risk drugs to take alone without medical guidance. This bill rightfully empowers medical professionals to protect life, not destroy it,”said The Honorable Marilyn Musgrave, Vice President of Government Affairs, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom\n\n“Now and always, Americans should be free to live and work consistent with their conscience without fear of unjust punishment from the government. We commend Senator James Lankford for his commitment to protecting the conscience rights of America’s health care professionals. The very culture of medicine and the quality of health care available to our families is at risk when we force doctors and other health care professionals to perform procedures and dispense drugs that violate their consciences. Freedom of conscience is for everyone, including doctors and nurses, and at a time when America is facing a shortage of qualified health care workers, our laws should welcome those who seek to practice medicine in an ethical, conscientious manner. In light of this rising issue, the proposed legislation will enable more doctors and nurses to enter—and stay—in health care, leading to more options and choices when patients are looking for a doctor who shares their values. Senator Lankford’s bill is a win for everyone—no matter their political beliefs. No citizen, and certainly not our health care professionals, should be left defenseless when their government attempts to infringe upon their ability to act according to their conscience,” said Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) Senior Counsel Matt Sharp, Director of the ADF Center for Public Policy.\n\nHeritage Action\n\n“Physicians take an oath to, first and foremost, ‘do no harm’ to their patients. For millions of health care providers in our country, performing abortions violates that essential oath and undermines their personal commitment to preserving human life. The Biden Administration is once again abusing executive authority to force pro-Life doctors to carry out the Left’s abortion agenda—directly attacking the rights and conscious protections of providers who adhere to their oath. Heritage Action applauds Sen. Lankford for introducing the Conscience Protection Act and encourages all conservative members to support this legislation,” Janae Stracke, Vice President of Outreach and Advocacy, Heritage Action.\n\n###"
