        "text": "University of Arkansas, state university system of Arkansas, U.S., with campuses in Fayetteville (main), Little Rock, Pine Bluff, and Monticello. A fifth campus, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, is also located in Little Rock. All campuses are coeducational and offer graduate programs. The Fayetteville and Little Rock campuses offer doctoral programs, and both include schools of law. The Medical Sciences campus consists of the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Health Related Professions, which offer graduate degrees in these areas; there is also a graduate program in public health. Total enrollment in the system exceeds 30,000.\n\nThe main campus at Fayetteville, a land-grant institution, was established in 1871. Instruction began the following year. It is the largest university in the state, with an enrollment of about 14,500. The University of Arkansas at Little Rock was founded in 1927 as a junior college; it became a four-year university in 1957 and merged with the University of Arkansas system in 1969. The campus at Pine Bluff was founded in 1873 as Branch Normal College and opened two years later; it operated as a junior college between 1894 and 1929, joining the university system in 1972. The Monticello campus was created in 1909 as an agricultural school, with instruction beginning the next year. It became a four-year college and, in 1971, merged with the university system. Monticello operates the stateâ€™s only school of forestry."
