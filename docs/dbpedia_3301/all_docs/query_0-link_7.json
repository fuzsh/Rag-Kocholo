Data were compiled by CQ Roll Call and the Pew Research Center’s Religion & Public Life Project. For analysis of the findings, see the full report.\n\nClick on the label at the top of each column to sort that column alphabetically. Within each designation, members of Congress will be listed alphabetically by last name. For example, clicking on “state” will display members of Congress by their home state, and clicking on “religion” will sort by religious group or denomination.\n\nSix nonvoting delegates who represent U.S. territories and the District of Columbia are not counted in this analysis, but they are included in this sortable table. Their names are marked with asterisks.\n\nRep. Michael G. Grimm, R-N.Y., has announced his intention to resign, effective Jan. 5. His name is marked with a ^."
