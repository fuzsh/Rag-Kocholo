        "text": "August 23, 2024\n\nMaking Food Safety and Animal Health a National Priority\n\nPoultry is the largest agricultural industry in Arkansas, representing almost 40 percent of production and accounting for one in four agriculture jobs in the state.\n\nOver half of the nearly 38,000 farms in Arkansas raise cattle.\n\nArkansas hog producers raise more than 1.8 million pigs annually.\n\nWhether its broilers, turkeys, cattle, dairy, or hogs, Arkansas producers have long prioritized animal health and have a strong track record of preventing and responding to emerging animal disease threats, such as avian influenza.\n\nAs the head Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am committed to ensuring America continues to lead the way in responding to current and future animal diseases.\n\nIt is critical that we in Congress put the right tools in place to bolster animal health programs. We have a golden opportunity to do that with the next farm bill.\n\nWe must meet this moment and modernize the risk management tools our farmers and ranchers rely upon and key programs that support producers facing weather and animal disease challenges.\n\nFor livestock producers, animal disease outbreaks are among the biggest risks they face.\n\nThat is why robust investments in animal health programs are included in the farm bill framework my Senate Republican colleagues and I have put forward.\n\nOur framework doubles funding for the “three-legged stool” programs the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers to combat animal disease outbreaks. We will help ensure USDA’s disease response can be successful by supporting our animal health labs, establishing cooperative agreements with states and other partners and investing in our vaccine bank.\n\nWe also aim to improve assistance for poultry growers impacted by avian influenza and ensure producers’ ability to export their products when there is not an animal health concern.\n\nI remain confident that both the House and Senate can come together to pass a strong farm bill that prioritizes these investments in animal health programs.\n\nWhile we work toward accomplishing that goal, we cannot ignore the ongoing avian influenza outbreak we are seeing in both dairy cattle and poultry.\n\nWhile I am encouraged by the careful response, we need to ensure the administration continues to rely on the animal health expertise of USDA to lead the efforts and that the agency leans heavily on our state agriculture commissioners and veterinarians, who have boots-on-the-ground experience working with producers.\n\nIt is of upmost importance that we do not penalize producers who are dealing with an outbreak on their operation. Rather, we must seek to incentivize them to implement strong biosecurity measures on the front end and, when impacted, work with experts and veterinarians to address the outbreak.\n\nFinally, we must ensure the administration proactively engages with our trading partners to minimize the impact on exports. Too often our trading partners use animal diseases as a scapegoat for blocking U.S. goods at their shores. We must ensure unfair trade barriers are not put in place against American meat, poultry and dairy products and hold our trading partners accountable for science-based trade policies.\n\nMy colleagues and I agree that a long-term plan for responding to avian influenza in both poultry and dairy cattle must be established and communicated by the administration.\n\nCongress stands ready to help support that effort and continue to ensure our nation leads the way in animal health innovation, surveillance and response, and science-based policy to deal with emerging animal disease threats.\n\nAugust 16, 2024\n\nCelebrating Two Years of the PACT Act\n\nOur nation made a promise to the men and women who served in uniform that we would take care of them. This month marks the two-year anniversary of a major step forward in that mission with the signing of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, landmark legislation that delivers all toxic-exposed veterans their earned Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits.\n\nExpanding eligibility for veterans living with toxic exposure illnesses due to their military service was long overdue. As a member of the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees, I’ve heard a lot about the health challenges these veterans face. The VA has a responsibility to ensure veterans have access to its resources. Fortunately, we are seeing evidence that the PACT Act is making a difference.\n\nNationwide, more than one million PACT Act-related claims have been approved. In Arkansas, more than 13,000 veterans are receiving service-connected benefits as a result of the law.\n\nMarine Corps veteran Bill Rhodes of Mena is one of them.\n\nRhodes served in Thailand during the Vietnam War. After developing illnesses linked to herbicide exposure, the former U.S. Marine turned to the VA for medical help. His claim was initially denied because the department’s policy at the time limited benefits for toxic-exposed Vietnam War-era Thailand veterans. After researching the issue, he understood a legislative fix was needed, and I was proud to help.\n\nWe crafted a provision to eliminate the unreasonable burden placed on veterans like Mr. Rhodes to prove toxic exposure. The measure was ultimately included in the PACT Act, expanding benefits to Vietnam War-era veterans exposed to Agent Orange during their service in Thailand.\n\nArkansans can be proud of Rhodes’ leadership to find a solution that improves the wellbeing of his fellow veterans and represents an important contribution to an already sweeping reform. Thanks to his commitment, those he served with in Thailand can receive the benefits they rightfully earned.\n\nI was pleased to champion passage of the PACT Act on behalf of toxic-exposed veterans and supporters to secure their access to VA healthcare and benefits. This was a bipartisan success story and it’s given hope to veterans and their families who have been struggling with their health care. In addition to expanding benefits eligibility, the law has helped spur more than 5,000 Natural State veterans to sign up for VA health care since its enactment.\n\nWhen we wrote the legislation, Congress anticipated an increase in the workload at the VA so we also included measures to bolster VA’s workforce, especially in rural areas.\n\nI am continuing to work with my colleagues on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee to ensure the VA is implementing the law, as intended, with the requisite resources. Enhancing the recruitment and retention of key VA personnel to ensure we can attract the best professionals to care for veterans will also continue to be a priority of mine and my colleagues.\n\nAs a result of the PACT Act, the VA is serving more veterans than ever before and continues to provide more care and benefits to veterans exposed to toxins during their military service. Now we must ensure it is equipped to support these increased claims and carry out its mission. I’m proud to work in a bipartisan manner to make certain veterans and their families are provided the care and benefits our country owes them.\n\nAugust 15, 2024\n\nBoozman Shares Memories of Rogers Veteran\n\nClick here to watch excerpts of Chris Traxson’s interview\n\nWASHINGTON– U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) recognized the service and sacrifice of Chris Traxson in ‘Salute to Veterans,’ a series highlighting the military service of Arkansans.\n\nTraxson was born in Rogers and graduated from Rogers High School in 1999. He attended Northwest Arkansas Community College before enrolling at the University of Arkansas where he earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.\n\nHe served as a police officer for his hometown and, after a year in that role, enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve.\n\nTraxson is from a family with a history of military service, including his dad who was drafted during the Vietnam War, and was inspired to help in the War on Terror.\n\n“It was a time when I felt like I wanted to do more. There was a lot going on in the Middle East,” he said. “I just felt like I was in a place in my life from the physical fitness standpoint and maturity level where I thought I could go in and help with the effort.”\n\nTraxson was encouraged to join the Marines by some of his law enforcement colleagues who were veterans of the branch. He wanted to serve on the frontlines and was convinced the Marine infantry division was the quickest path to combat. He also appreciated its proud tradition.\n\nHe was 24 years old when he attended bootcamp, “I was definitely the old man, they kinda came to me for that fatherly guidance even though I wasn’t a father. And it was the same in infantry school as well.”\n\nIn 2006 he learned his unit was attaching to another from Detroit as part of a large battalion build up that would eventually be deployed to Fallujah, Iraq.\n\nTraxson arrived in Fallujah two years after the battles of 2004 and said the locals were just beginning to return to the city. However, there was severe property damage and a lot of hostility.\n\n“In the first two weeks we were there it was extremely quiet and then after that two-week period things started popping off. We were getting enemy contact almost every day. And I had to ask, ‘Why was it so quiet those first two weeks?’ and they informed me that they were watching us,” Traxson recalled. “They knew we were a new unit.”\n\nTraxson said he had to be ready to go at a moment’s notice, so after long days out on a mission, the marines had to have their gear and vehicles prepared for the next time they would be called upon. His assignment was to ride in the turret of the Humvee operating the machine gun and watching the roadway for improvised explosive devices (IEDs).\n\nHe’d only been in Iraq four weeks when he was injured by an IED.\n\n“I wasn’t even supposed to go out that day,” he said. He was given the option to sit out for 48 hours because his team had rolled over an explosive device on its last mission. However, he was cleared to participate and decided to join.\n\nHe doesn’t remember a lot about the explosion but recalled the doors of the vehicle blew off. “I had taken off running because I was on fire,” he said.\n\nThe marines in his Humvee were loaded onto a truck and taken to the hospital. Three weeks later he woke up at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.\n\nHe had third-degree burns on 56 percent of his body. In the two years of recovery, he had more than 70 surgeries.\n\nHis mother, a nurse, quit her job in Arkansas to help take care of him and advocate on his behalf while he was in recovery. “She wanted to make sure I had somebody to speak for me,” he said.\n\nDuring his recovery, he received letters from his fellow marines updating him on friends in his unit. “Obviously, [we’d] suffered casualties and they would let me know about who those were,” he said. “Some of them I was close to so it was hard not being able to go to their funerals.”\n\nTraxson received a Purple Heart for his sacrifice. “No one wants to get a Purple Heart, but I’m happy to accept it.”\n\nHe was discharged in 2009 and worked part-time at a local store as he continued his healing while also serving as a security guard at Northwest Arkansas Community College for eight years. He graduated from business school in 2013 and today works at the Benton County Veterans Service Office where he helps veterans in getting the benefits and services they’ve earned. “My experience makes it a lot easier for them to talk to me.”\n\nHe has been honored to talk to students about his journey and encourages them to be optimistic in addition to aspiring to a lifetime of public service whether in the military or other civic engagement.\n\n“Some of the best people I ever met were people in uniform,” he said. “They came from all over the country. They were all different colors, religions and that’s the thing I like about the military is that when you go in there, we all wear the same uniform. We’re not anything else but the uniform we wear. I learned a lot from the people I served with. They made me better.”\n\n“Chris Traxson honorably served his country and has made a great sacrifice. His perseverance and determination are an inspiration to us all. I’m proud to capture and preserve his memories of his service for the benefit of future generations,” Boozman said.\n\nBoozman submitted Traxson’s entire interview to the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.\n\nDo you know a veteran interested in sharing their memories for the ‘Salute to Veterans’ series? Nominate an Arkansas veteran to share their story by calling Boozman’s Fort Smith office at 479-573-0189.\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nProtecting Access to Care for Seniors\n\nLong-term care and senior living in our country are taking on a dramatic shift as more Americans enter advanced age. This will place a larger strain on nursing homes and the existing network that serves this population, which is why it is critical to help rather than hamper the industry’s preparations for this incoming surge.\n\nLike me, most Arkansans know loved ones in their circle of family and friends who have required the extensive care these facilities provide. It is a reality that comes with some anxiety but also hope that happy and fulfilling days can still be possible with access to the right services and support.\n\nIn April, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a final rule that created new, onerous requirements for nurse staffing levels in these care settings. Currently, only six percent of facilities in Arkansas meet these standards and they exceed existing benchmarks in nearly all states.\n\nThis unfunded federal mandate could jeopardize access to quality care and services for many seniors today and into the future. This problem is particularly dangerous for facilities in rural areas across the country, such as in Arkansas, because the increased staffing levels this rule requires will lead to higher costs. This will likely result in many nursing homes further limiting the number of residents served, or possibly closing due to shortages of available labor.\n\nBoth the American Health Care Association and its chapter in Arkansas have voiced concerns with this proposal and warned about the detrimental impact it could have.\n\nMy colleagues and I are committed to pushing back against this misguided regulation and protecting families and caregivers’ ability to find or remain in settings they trust and take comfort in.\n\nI was proud to join a bipartisan group of over two dozen senators challenging the CMS mandate, first in a letter to the agency’s administrator last year and then signing onto a Congressional Review Act measure that would overturn the rule. This legislative vehicle offers an expedited procedure and only requires a majority vote to pass.\n\nNatural State long-term care and senior living facilities are already facing challenges, but still finding ways to overcome them.\n\nFor example, Methodist Village Senior Living in Fort Smith is addressing the nurse staffing shortage in a practical way, with the only Life Plan Community in Arkansas that houses an onsite education center for certified nursing assistants and medication technicians. It has become a successful model of creating an environment that delivers education and training for the next generation of health care professionals. Not only does this help meet the needs of residents, but it also inspires fellow employees to strive toward obtaining more skills and certifications.\n\nWe know the nursing shortage began long before 2020 and was exacerbated by the pandemic, with approximately 100,000 registered nurses (RNs) leaving the profession in a two-year period. Another 610,000 RNs reported an “intent to leave” the workforce by 2027 due to stress, burnout and retirement, according to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.\n\nThis is clearly an urgent problem we need to continue working to address. My colleagues and I share the administration’s goal of ensuring adequate staffing levels to improve the quality of care for seniors. However, a one-size-fits-all approach will do more harm than good, especially in communities that are already underserved.\n\nI will continue working across party lines to address these concerns because our seniors deserve our utmost respect, which starts with valuing and upholding their dignity. We must empower each state to achieve that goal in partnership with caregivers and the families in need of these services.\n\nAugust 8, 2024\n\nWTAS: Support Builds for Boozman-Welch Legislation to Protect Seniors’ Access to Healthcare\n\nWASHINGTON –– U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Peter Welch (D-VT) announced support from national health organizations for the Physician Fee Stabilization Act, legislation that ensures greater flexibility in determining pricing adjustments for medical services without triggering harmful annual payment cuts to Medicare-serving physicians.\n\nThe legislation is also cosponsored by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Angus King (I-ME), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).\n\nWhat They Are Saying\n\n“Physicians cannot continue to be faced with large reductions in Medicare payment at the beginning of each year, threatening our practice operations and access to care for our nation’s seniors. The American College of Physicians supports the Physician Fee Stabilization Act that would help to ensure this doesn’t continue to happen by raising the threshold for the implementation of budget neutral payment cuts,” said Isaac O. Opole, MBChB, PHD, MACP, President, American College of Physicians.\n\n“The Physician Fee Stabilization Act would provide a much-needed increase to the budget neutrality threshold, raising the trigger amount from $20 million, where it has been since 1992, to $53 million. It would then provide for inflationary increases every five years based on the Medicare Economic Index. As proposed, the $33 million increase is proportional to the growth of Part B spending since the implementation of the PFS,” said American College of Surgeons Executive Director and CEO Patricia L. Turner, MD, MBA, FACS. “This would be an important step forward to ensure greater flexibility in determining pricing adjustments for services without triggering re-occurring across-the-board cuts at the end of every year.”\n\n“The Physician Fee Stabilization Act is a vital step toward ensuring stability and fairness in physician payment reform, especially for cardiologists who provide life-saving care. By raising the budget neutrality threshold, this legislation will help prevent annual cuts that threaten patients’ access to cardiovascular care. The American College of Cardiology commends Senators Boozman, Welch, Tillis, King, Marshall and Shaheen for their leadership and commitment to supporting our nation’s cardiologists and their patients,” said American College of Cardiology President Cathleen Biga, MSN, FACC.\n\n“The Physician Fee Stabilization Act marks the Senate’s first legislative solution this year to help ensure fair and consistent Medicare payments for physician services, and Congress should pass this bill to help ensure our nation’s seniors continue to have timely access to the physician of their choice. We applaud the bipartisan group of Senators leading this initiative and look forward to working with policymakers to advance additional long-lasting Medicare policy solutions,” said Russell R. Lonser, MD, FAANS, American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n\n“The American Academy of Dermatology Association sincerely thanks Senators Boozman and Welch for introducing the Physician Fee Stabilization Act, which would update the budget neutrality thresholds in the Medicare physician fee schedule,” said American Academy of Dermatology Association President Seemal R. Desai, MD, FAAD. “This bill is a crucial step in the fight to reform Medicare physician payment as it would revise budget neutrality policies that contribute to eroding reimbursement, which is not only a critical top priority for dermatologists, but for all physicians and most importantly the patients we serve.”\n\n“The AAMC applauds Sens. Boozman and Welch for introducing the Physician Fee Stabilization Act. Physicians employed by teaching health systems and hospitals across the country are dedicated to both providing care to the most complex and vulnerable patients and training the next generation of physicians. These large, multispecialty practices are vital resources to their local communities, providing significant primary care and other critical services, including a large percentage of tertiary, quaternary, and specialty referral care in the community. However, their ability to continue to provide care in their communities is in jeopardy due to the threat of yearly cuts to their patient care payments,” said Danielle Turnipseed, JD, MHSA, MPP, Chief Public Policy Officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. “The Physician Fee Stabilization Act would update the current budget neutrality threshold in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), and continue to update it every five years. While more is needed to ensure the stability and longevity of the PFS, this is a critical step, and we appreciate the bipartisan commitment of Sens. Boozman and Welch to addressing issues with the PFS and look forward to working to get this legislation passed.”\n\n“The American Urological Association (AUA) applauds Senators John Boozman and Peter Welch, along with Senators Thom Tillis, Angus King, Roger Marshall, MD and Jeanne Shaheen, for their leadership in introducing S. 4935, the Physician Fee Stabilization Act,” said AUA Public Policy Council Chair Mark Edney, MD, MBA. “This bipartisan legislation takes the critical step of increasing the budget neutrality threshold from $20 to $53 million with adjustments every five years to keep pace with the MEI. The budget neutrality threshold has not been updated in more than 30 years and physicians are the only Medicare provider without inflationary payment updates. S. 4935 would fix this and bring much-needed stability to physician payment year after year, helping to ease the provision of urological care and countless other services to millions of Americans under Medicare.”\n\n“The American Optometric Association (AOA) applauds Sens. Boozman and Welch, for the visionary direction S. 4935 sets for future growth of health care access,” said Steven Reed, O.D., AOA president. “For so many years, physicians of all types, including doctors of optometry, have long been impacted by stagnant Medicare reimbursement. The costs to deliver care continue to increase especially in regard to staffing and overhead costs, yet Medicare reimbursement has remained and proposed cuts only threaten to hamper physicians’ ability to provide valued care. S. 4935 takes a long-term forward-looking approach to a real solution – not a patch – to address this problem.”\n\nAugust 2, 2024\n\nBoosting Access to Dental Services in Arkansas\n\nOne of the keys to living healthier, longer lives is access to quality care and treatment. Without a strong supply of medical professionals in our communities to provide that help, we will struggle to fully achieve this goal.\n\nWe’re actively working to strengthen the healthcare workforce in Arkansas and retain the professionals trained in our state. In recent years, an expansion of medical training is preparing the next generation of doctors. The latest example will serve to enhance the availability of oral health care as The Natural State’s first school of dental medicine is launched. Last month, we celebrated the groundbreaking for this facility that Lyon College is proudly forging in partnership with other health entities.\n\nA study by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement found access to dentists, particularly in rural areas, is limited. In 2019, 11 counties had a dental provider shortage and two counties had no active dentist.\n\nEstablishing the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine to address this shortfall is a solution our state needs and is embracing with excitement.\n\nThis year Congress passed, and the president signed into law, legislation that funds Arkansas health projects including a critical investment to make this project a reality. I was proud to advocate for federal funds to support dental education in our state because it’s an important component of overall health.\n\nIt’s taken a lot of hard work and dedication to get to this point. From the leadership of Batesville’s Lyon College to the committed professionals in the community and across the state who have supported this initiative, the vision to enhance the resources and services available to Arkansans to promote both health and wellness has been evident and convincing.\n\nI am particularly proud of Lyon College’s enthusiasm and persistence. The impact this decision will have on the future of Arkansas is significant – expanding access to dental care by generating a pipeline of dental professionals who will practice here at home and further enriching the quality of life in communities across all 75 of our counties.\n\nThe broad support for this endeavor demonstrates our collective desire to advance this vital form of healthcare in a truly meaningful way. Ensuring more Arkansans have access to dental services they need will help prevent long-term dental challenges in our communities. This is especially critical for our children, as good oral health practices established early can lead to a lifetime of better health outcomes.\n\nI applaud Lyon College for its unwavering commitment to taking on this mission and moving us one step closer to our goal. The school anticipates admitting its first class of dental graduate students next year at its new Little Rock campus. I’ve been pleased to support this great example of an educational institution leading the way to solve a pressing need in our communities.\n\nThe groundbreaking signals a healthier, brighter future we are building together for Arkansas. I am grateful to all those whose contributions have helped pave the way, as well as the many supporters of this major project and all Arkansans for their shared passion for improving access to oral healthcare.\n\nTogether, we are making history and setting the foundation for a healthier, happier Arkansas. I look forward to following the progress and welcoming future dental professionals to our state to deliver excellent oral and dental care to their families, friends and neighbors.\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nSenators Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Seniors’ Access to Healthcare\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Peter Welch (D-VT) along with Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Angus King (I-ME), Roger Marshall, M.D. (R-KS) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) are leading efforts to protect access to Medicare services by reforming the program’s physician fee schedule with the introduction of the Physician Fee Stabilization Act.\n\nThe legislation would increase the budget neutrality threshold to $53 million with an increase every five years to keep pace with the Medicare Economic Index. This is a critical step forward to ensure greater flexibility in determining pricing adjustments for services without triggering harmful annual payment cuts to Medicare-serving physicians. The budget neutrality threshold was last updated in 1992.\n\n“Medicare patients must have access to quality health services. Ensuring physicians are fairly compensated for their work will help deliver stability to providers so they continue to meet the needs of their communities. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan solution that enhances Medicare’s sustainability,” Boozman said.\n\n“So many Vermonters rely on Medicare for their health care coverage – it’s critical that their health care providers are fairly compensated,” said Welch. “This commonsense, bipartisan bill updates an outdated, decades-old policy that triggers harmful cuts to provider payments. We’re working across the aisle to ensure providers in Vermont, and in rural communities around the country, can keep treating Medicare patients and get reimbursed fairly for the care they provide.”\n\n“The nearly two million Medicare beneficiaries in North Carolina expect timely access to quality care,” said Tillis. “Year after year, we’ve seen consistent Medicare reimbursement cuts to physicians that adversely impact access to care and patient outcomes – and just last month, Medicare proposed yet another three percent cut to physician reimbursement. This bipartisan legislation makes long-overdue changes to outdated policies to ensure physicians are adequately reimbursed, and seniors have uninterrupted access to care.”\n\n“Accessible and reliable healthcare is essential for seniors across Maine, especially for those in our most rural communities,” said King. “The Physician Fee Stabilization Act would ensure that Medicare providers are adequately paid so that they can continue to offer their full range of services to Maine’s Medicare beneficiaries. I want to thank my colleagues for prioritizing the healthcare and well-being of our older Americans.”\n\n“This legislation is a great step forward to provide stability for physicians serving our most vulnerable populations,” Marshall said. “Medicare payment changes have been severely impacting doctors in rural Kansas and nationwide since I was practicing. It’s time to implement meaningful reforms. I am proud to support this bill and look forward to working with Senator Boozman to help physicians everywhere.”\n\n“It’s critical we do all we can to ensure that Granite Staters who rely on Medicare for health insurance have access to the quality, affordable care they need,” said Shaheen. “This bipartisan bill would make sure physicians are fairly compensated and guarantee adequate reimbursement for providers, which would help strengthen Medicare’s dependability for patients now and into the future.”\n\nThe Physician Fee Stabilization Act has support from nationwide health organizations including the American Medical Association (AMA), American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), American Optometric Association (AOA), Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), American College of Surgeons (ACS), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), National Rural Health Association (NRHA), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), American College of Radiology (ACR), American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), Alliance of Specialty Medicine (ASM), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Urological Association (AUA), American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS), American Academy of Ophthalmology (AOA), American Psychiatric Association (APA), American College of Physicians (ACF), American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and American College of Cardiology (ACC).\n\nThe senators are advocates of protecting access to Medicare services. In February, Boozman and Welch led an effort to ensure providers who treat Medicare patients are adequately compensated that resulted in the mitigation of a drastic cut in the reimbursement rate.\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nSenate Committee Approves Boozman Language to Support Volunteer Fire Departments\n\nSenator Advocates Enhanced Engagement with Stakeholders\n\nWatch Boozman’s remarks to the committee\n\nWASHINGTON –– U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) succeeded in pushing for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to further examine potential unintended consequences of its Emergency Response Standard proposal to ensure communities in Arkansas and across the country continue to have access to volunteer firefighter services. The senator’s language was added to the Fiscal Year 2025 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act and encourages OSHA to conduct listening sessions and outreach with stakeholders to fully understand the impact of new requirements on volunteer fire departments.\n\n“We must ensure firefighters have the tools and training to safeguard themselves and the community, which means any adjustments to the standards applied to them must be carefully considered. OSHA’s current one-size-fits-all proposal could jeopardize volunteer fire departments’ ability to continue operating or drastically limit their resources and personnel capacity. I’m hopeful the plan can be revised with feedback from stakeholders,” Boozman said.\n\nArkansas has 1,003 fire departments and 974 are at least partially staffed by volunteers.\n\nIn February, OSHA announced its proposal to modernize safety requirements for emergency responders, but volunteer fire departments in Arkansas and across the country have shared their apprehensions with Congress that parts of the plan could cause unintended consequences and lead to increased costs resulting in potential cuts to services.\n\nBoozman recently responded to the proposed rule and assured Arkansans of his commitment to protect volunteer fire departments from unfunded mandates. In July, members of the Arkansas Congressional Delegation voiced their concerns about the rules to the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nBoozman Helps Preserve Memories of Arkansas Veterans in Library of Congress Collection\n\nSenator’s office surpasses more than 100 interviews submitted\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), a champion of the Library of Congress Veterans History Project (VHP), presented interviews with Arkansans for preservation in the national collection. The new submissions mark more than 100 interviews conducted by Boozman’s office.\n\n“The Veterans History Project is a unique collection of personal reflections that teaches our nation’s history from the perspective of those who have stood in defense of our freedoms. It also represents an opportunity for families to learn more about the selflessness of their loved ones, which is something I personally understand as the son of veteran of WWII who served in the Air Force for 23 years yet didn’t share much about his experiences in the military. This initiative preserves these patriotic Americans’ legacies so they live on for future generations. I’m honored to be part of this rewarding endeavor, ” Boozman said.\n\nThe senator submitted seven interviews conducted by his staff with veterans of the Cold War, Vietnam War, Desert Storm and War on Terror.\n\nIn 2000, Congress established the VHP to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.\n\nBoozman’s staff has conducted dozens of interviews and trained more than 1,200 Arkansans to participate and raise a\n\nJuly 19, 2024\n\nMarking a Milestone in Veterans Benefits\n\nThis year we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, more commonly known as the GI Bill. This landmark legislation created a pathway for returning troops to further their education, buy homes and launch businesses. The innovative policy remains a significant investment in our servicemembers and serves as an important aspect of the effort to honor the commitment we made to the men and women who wear our nation’s uniform.\n\nIt was a groundbreaking idea championed by The American Legion based on feedback from veterans aimed at ensuring those returning from service in WWII had the support they needed as they transitioned back to civilian life by providing funds for college, housing and unemployment insurance. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the measure into law June 22, 1944.\n\nThe law helped usher in prosperity during the post war era. Within the first seven years of implementation, eight million veterans received education benefits, more than doubling the number of college degrees awarded between 1940 to 1950.\n\nThe GI Bill has become fundamental to helping those who have been called to serve this country.\n\nArkansas veterans have shared how valuable their GI Bill benefits were to prepare them for a successful future. In interviews for the Veterans History Project, a collection of oral histories housed in the Library of Congress, WWII veteran Lieutenant Colonel William Ledbetter said he used his benefits for college at the University of Central Arkansas where he earned a degree in social studies and minored in physical education. Edith Mitchell served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps in WWII and, following her military service, earned a master’s degree in voice and public music from Columbia University. Vietnam veteran Master Sergeant Parnell Fisher completed his bachelor’s degree in education from Arkansas Baptist College with his GI bill benefits.\n\nAs a member of Veterans’ Affairs Committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives, I’ve supported legislation to modernize and update the GI Bill in order to better meet the needs of this generation’s former servicemembers.\n\nIn 2008, Congress passed the post-9/11 GI Bill and nine years later followed that up with the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, named after an Army Air Service veteran and former national commander of the American Legion. Known as the Forever GI Bill, it reflects the changing landscape of learning and expands authority for veterans to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs.\n\nThe bill enhanced educational benefits and eliminated the 15-year limitation on post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for eligible veterans and their dependents. It also included a reform I advocated to ensure wounded members of the National Guard and Reserve are eligible for the same GI Bill benefits as active-duty military members.\n\nWe closely followed its implementation and when the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to reimburse veterans for missed or underpaid Forever GI Bill housing benefits, I worked to correct this error.\n\nThese are all earned benefits, not hand-outs. Since they were enacted, they have changed lives and helped incentivize voluntary service in our Armed Forces.\n\nThis milestone is a good time to reflect on the tremendous sacrifice of the brave individuals willing to stand in defense of our country. We are forever grateful to the men and women who wear our nation’s uniform and the GI Bill continues to demonstrate our appreciation for their service.\n\nJuly 16, 2024\n\nBoozman Recognizes Military Service of Late Bella Vista Veteran\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) recognized the service and sacrifice of the late Marvin Trigg in ‘Salute to Veterans,’ a series recognizing the military service of Arkansans.\n\nTrigg grew up on his family’s farm in rural Missouri. He was put to work at an early age milking cows and using a two man crosscut saw to harvest wood.\n\n“I helped my dad because we heated with wood, I many times went out with him,” Trigg recalled. “I’d be on one end and he’d be on the other.”\n\nTrigg said he walked to school until high school when he was bussed to school. He had to make sure he was finished milking the cow before the bus came.\n\nTrigg enlisted in the Army in 1955 when he was 21 years old.\n\n“They sent me to Fort Eustice, Virginia,” Trigg said. “Flew me out there and then decided they didn’t have anything for me so they put me on a pullman car to send me back.”\n\nHis family was supportive of his decision to enlist. “They thought it was a good idea.”\n\nHe was first stationed at Fort Chaffee.\n\nTrigg served as an aircraft maintenance crewman. In addition, he said one of his responsibilities included mowing the grass at Fort Knox.\n\nOnce he finished his military commitment he used his GI Bill benefits to attend aviation school and earned his pilot’s license.\n\nHe worked for a local company in his hometown flying across Missouri transporting canned goods.\n\nTrigg said his favorite part of military service was seeing different parts of the country.\n\n“I am grateful for Marvin Trigg’s dedication and service to our nation. His memories of his military service are an important part of our history, and I am pleased to be able to collect and preserve his stories for future generations,” Boozman said.\n\nSadly, Trigg passed away December 20, 2023, but his interview will be submitted to the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.\n\nDo you know a veteran interested in sharing their memories for the ‘Salute to Veterans’ series?

I spent many summers playing church league baseball and as I got older, I found opportunities to use this time to make a difference in the lives of others by teaching kids to swim. It was a rewarding experience. I’ve met with many young Arkansans who use summer break to explore new interests and gain public service experience to help put them on a path to a meaningful and purpose-driven future.\n\nWe are blessed in Arkansas to have a variety of programs that invest in our youth and help foster a passion for lifelong civic participation. Many of these initiatives also include a trip to our nation’s capital where I’ve been honored to welcome students and share more about my role representing them and their families.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Arkansas’s electric cooperatives have sponsored a trip to Washington to help shape future leaders. This prestigious program brings together some of the best and brightest students with the aim of expanding their understanding of how policies and legislation support the needs of electric cooperative members at the state and federal levels.\n\nI was pleased to visit with these students who were great representatives of our state. They used this opportunity to learn more about the role of members of Congress and how elected officials support Natural State families, communities and businesses.\n\nOne parent commented on social media that the experience would impact her daughter for “the rest of her life.”\n\nIn recent weeks I hosted students from Gosnell High School who traveled to Washington, D.C. to see the landmarks and monuments dedicated to individuals who shaped our country. The high schoolers were enthusiastic about history coming alive as they visited the sites and interacted with the additional context surrounding the figures they have learned about in school.\n\nExposing youth to opportunities that demonstrate the importance of civic engagement is an investment in our future. These programs serve to motivate student leaders and encourage an interest in public service.\n\nA new or deeper passion for public service is something I’m confident Senate interns take away from their experience in my office. We are blessed to have dedicated individuals who use their summer to give back to Arkansans and serve their needs. Students from all across the state get a front row seat to the debates on Capitol Hill and learn how these policies impact the lives of Natural State residents.\n\nMy office also helps young Arkansans explore civics and public policy through the Congressional Youth Cabinet and Senate Page programs that each offer a unique, hands-on experience.\n\nBentonville High School senior and Miss Arkansas’ Teen Peyton Bolling served as a Senate Page on Capitol Hill for a semester last school year. She launched an Instagram show to inform her peers about the importance of giving back to the community. I was honored to be a recent guest on ‘Glimpses in Government’ to talk about civic engagement and finding purpose in helping others.\n\nThis is a lesson my college football coach Frank Broyles instilled in me that I continue to follow as I serve Arkansans. He shared how “there are two types of people in the world, givers and takers – live your life as a giver.” I’m proud to help continue to pass along this message to the next generation of leaders.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Advances Boozman-Led Bill Funding Military Infrastructure and Veterans Care\n\nMeasure Also Provides $128.5 Million for Pilot Training Center at Ebbing Airbase\n\nWASHINGTON – The Senate Appropriations Committee advanced legislation crafted by U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR), ranking member of the Senate Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies (MilCon-VA) Appropriations Subcommittee, that delivers $128.5 million to Arkansas for the future pilot training center at Ebbing Air National Guard Base in addition to making significant investments to improve servicemembers and their families’ quality of life and robustly fund veterans’ health care and benefits.\n\nThe bill now moves to the full Senate for consideration.\n\n“Providing the resources our servicemembers and their families deserve and supporting our veterans by funding the medical treatment and benefits they have earned must always be a top priority for Congress. I’m pleased our bipartisan bill accomplishes both and includes another vital investment to ensure Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Fort Smith, Arkansas stays on track to successfully train allies on the F-35 aircraft. Passage of this measure represents our strong, shared commitment to those defending our nation today and in previous generations,” Boozman said.\n\nFunding Boozman secured for Arkansas includes $128.5 million to support the foreign pilot training mission at Ebbing through construction of an Academic Training Center as well as other projects.\n\nThis legislation also includes key investments in military housing; veteran suicide prevention, telehealth, mental health and homelessness programs; women veterans care as well as innovative medical research.\n\nThe bill additionally allocates full funding for the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, Arlington National Cemetery and the Armed Forces Retirement Home.\n\nJuly 5, 2024\n\nInvesting in our Aviation System\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration screened nearly three million air travelers on Sunday, June 23, breaking the single day record. Seven of the top 10 busiest travel days ever at our nation’s airports have been since late May. The agency predicts it will continue to hit new highs as we’re in the middle of the busy summer travel season.\n\nAs more people fly and air travel continues to grow, there is a need for modernization to boost confidence in the industry and the aviation workforce. In May, Congress passed crucial reforms to accomplish these goals in the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act of 2024 the president signed into law.\n\nThis win for Arkansans and all Americans improves passenger safety, invests in aviation infrastructure and personnel in addition to advancing technology and innovation to get travelers to their destinations safely.\n\nThe FAA invests in facility upgrades and expansion of airports through its Airport Improvement Program (AIP). In our state, 76 airports are eligible for AIP awards and many have received funding to improve safety, rehabilitate runways and widen taxiways through this initiative. The FAA reauthorization increases money available for the program so our airports can continue making upgrades.\n\nThe law also helps surge the hiring of air traffic controllers so we can ensure an ample pipeline of personnel are in place to meet the demands of the industry.\n\nAn expansion of this workforce is critical because last year the Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General found the FAA didn’t have adequate staffing at 77 percent of critical facilities.\n\nI’m pleased the measure included a provision I championed to improve FAA hiring practices so we can ease this shortfall and get more individuals trained and on the job to enhance safety and efficiency.\n\nThis law also promotes the integration of new and emerging technology. Arkansas is already successfully leading in this area, implementing the use of drones to augment human inspectors and spot flaws and structural issues on bridges, railways and other infrastructure projects.\n\nAfter the shutdown of the I-40 bridge over the Mississippi River, ARDOT increased its drone capabilities and now boasts one of the most expansive programs in the country. This newly passed federal policy will allow state and local governments to follow Arkansas’s example.\n\nDrone deployment improves safety and saves taxpayer dollars. That’s why I backed legislation to empower communities to use these tools as well as invest in American-made drones and the next generation workforce in drone aviation.\n\nThis language was included in the FAA reauthorization. It authorizes $200 million in grants for two years to purchase drones and foster development of programs to prepare future employees in the field.\n\nI am hopeful this will benefit communities across the country and spurs further investments in drone capabilities that provide cost-effective solutions to improve our infrastructure.\n\nReauthorization of the FAA is a great example of what we can accomplish when we work together. This was the result of bipartisan input in committee hearings and debates in the Senate and House of Representatives, with ultimate goal of making meaningful updates to strengthen our aviation system and improve air travel. Arkansans and our neighbors throughout the country will reap the benefits of this achievement.\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nSharing Stories of Service\n\nThe service and sacrifice of Arkansans called to wear our nation’s uniform are woven into the fabric of our communities. Long after men and women leave active duty, their commitment to others continues. I’m proud to share the stories of these individuals and their desire to serve for the Library of Congress Veterans History Project (VHP).\n\nIn 1974, Debra Holmes enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve as an air traffic controller during the tumultuous years following the Vietnam War. A decade later, Ken Griffin was training to become a fighter pilot in U.S. Air Force and 30 years after Holmes’ first day, Chris Traxson joined the U.S. Marine Corps to become a heavy weapons specialist and serve in Iraq.\n\nTheir experiences will be soon be part of the VHP, a collection of oral histories of the men and women who served our nation in every branch of the military.\n\nWhile their jobs, locations and personal experiences were completely different, each veteran made many of the same observations and shared similar feelings about their commitment to serving others, their love for our country and the satisfaction of knowing they made a difference.\n\nThey also spoke about the skills they learned through military service that helped shape their lives. These included the value of discipline, the ability to work as a team for a common goal and how to be a leader in whatever role you are given.\n\nAs we approach Independence Day, these stories are on my mind. They speak to the desire to make a difference and the best of the human spirit that citizen-soldiers have demonstrated long before the founding of our country. I am grateful for the service of these Arkansans and the important work of the Library of Congress to preserve their experiences for future generations. The VHP is the largest repository of oral histories by American veterans and, as many Arkansans know from my monthly Salute to Veterans feature, the project is important to me and my staff. In addition to regularly traveling across the state to interview veterans from every branch of the military and every era of service, we’ve trained others to join this initiative.\n\nIn recent months, we have interviewed veterans who served in the Vietnam War-era to the War on Terror. Each one of them told a unique story about where they came from, how they ended up in the military, how they served and what happened next.\n\nThreads of patriotism and sacrifice are united through each of their stories as they described their lives both before and after their military service. In most cases, they took what they learned and found new ways to make a difference in their communities. Whether working in a government agency, as a chaplain or in roles directly helping other veterans, they continue their mission of service.\n\nIf you are a veteran or have a veteran in your life who would like to participate, please reach out to my office. We are happy to provide more information. The Library of Congress has more details about this important national project at www.loc.gov. Learn more about the Arkansans we’ve highlighted in our Salute to Veterans feature on my website to see examples of interviews we’ve been honored to conduct and share.\n\nJune 21, 2024\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nLittle Rock Teen Serves as Senate Page\n\nSenate Page Juliana Davis and Senator John Boozman\n\nWASHINGTON –– Pulaski Academy’s Juliana Davis traded in the scenes of the Little Rock campus for the opportunity to navigate the corridors of the U.S. Capitol as a Senate Page this spring.\n\nDavis served as one of 28 Senate Pages who prepared the U.S. Senate chamber for the day’s business by distributing documents to senators’ desks, assisting in the cloakrooms, supporting chamber staff, and – when Congress was in session – sitting near the dais waiting to help members delivering remarks or casting votes.\n\n“It has been an absolute privilege to serve as a Senate Page. My time in the Senate gave me an experience that has truly grown my knowledge of the U.S. government and Congress especially. I’m honored to have contributed to the workings of our government in its day-to-day operation, and I will always look back fondly on this program and how much it taught me,” Davis said.\n\nThe 17-year-old rising senior from Arkansas’s capital city earned her appointment to the position from U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR).\n\n“I’m proud of the work Juliana did to support the Senate. She had a front-row seat to a unique lesson on American government that I am hopeful will encourage a lifetime of civic engagement. Arkansans can be proud to have been represented by her in this prestigious program,” Boozman said.\n\nDavis is an accomplished student and leader who aspires to study foreign relations or business upon graduating from Pulaski Academy. She is active in several extracurricular activities including the cross country team as well as the Chinese and Spanish clubs. She also served as junior yearbook editor.\n\nJuliana is the daughter of Cory and Dinah Davis.\n\nThe Senate Page program started in 1829 when Senator Daniel Webster appointed the first Senate Page. Today, the program is a unique, highly selective opportunity for high school juniors with a strong academic standing to learn firsthand about the institution often referred to as “the world’s greatest deliberative body.”\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nFarm Bill Framework Delivers for Agriculture Producers\n\nI’ve talked with farmers, ranchers and agriculture industry stakeholders in our state and across the country to gather their input and priorities for the next farm bill. Now we’ve put those ideas on paper and are making progress toward passage of this crucial legislation.\n\nThe House Agriculture Committee approved a bipartisan farm bill last month that meets the needs of farmers, ranchers, foresters, rural communities and consumers across America. Republicans on the Senate Agriculture Committee are building on that momentum with the release of our own farm bill framework in recent days.\n\nOur plan supplies additional resources for the tools farmers rely upon, and are calling for us to invest in, while ensuring we promote new markets and research in addition to protecting nutrition programs and conservation practices.\n\nArkansas farmers have been able to point to their positive trade balance in agriculture as a source of pride for the better part of the last 50 years as they worked to feed, clothe and fuel the world. Unfortunately, this administration’s refusal to engage on the issue has created an agricultural trade imbalance that is projected to reach record heights and is showing no signs of slowing.\n\nWe increase funding for the farm bill’s premiere trade programs to help increase our competitiveness overseas.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas System Vice President for Agriculture Dr. Deacue Fields testified before the committee in 2022 about the importance of agriculture research.\n\nAgricultural research programs spur innovation and productivity allowing farmers to produce more while using less and in an environmentally friendly manner, even as threats from pests, diseases and unpredictable weather become more common.\n\nOur framework represents a strong commitment to supporting that work.\n\nI’ve been blessed to see how Natural State research is shaping the industry. Under the GOP proposal, agricultural research funding would double, which would be welcome news for our land-grant institutions and colleges of agriculture that conduct groundbreaking research. I’m particularly pleased to advocate for continuation of the 1890 National Scholars Program, which would directly impact the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.\n\nWe also make a historic investment in the conservation title while ensuring programs remain locally-led and flexible. Our plan increases funding in the conservation title with a focus on empowering producers to make the best decisions to meet the resource concerns of their operations.\n\nMore than half of Arkansas counties lost population according to the last census. These communities must have the modern infrastructure necessary to attract and retain talent. Our framework offers help to rural areas by making significant investments in small business development, broadband expansion, water and energy infrastructure programs, as well as funds to increase access to rural healthcare, childcare and public safety.\n\nMost importantly, we are putting more farm in the farm bill by guaranteeing a modernized farm safety net so we can deliver access to risk management tools that reflect the nature of the challenges our producers are operating under.\n\nOur farmers, ranchers, foresters, consumers, lenders and other stakeholders helped us fashion a farm bill that meets their varying needs.\n\nThe agriculture committee has demonstrated we can come together to tackle important legislation. I have been proud to partner with Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to shepherd significant reforms into law on priority issues, particularly in the climate and nutrition spaces. There is no reason we can’t harness the same spirit of bipartisanship and advance a bill that supports our farmers and rural communities.\n\nI look forward to taking our two frameworks, forging a bipartisan farm bill and passing it into law.\n\nJune 14, 2024\n\nBoozman Awarded for Hunger Action and Modernizing Summer Meals Programs\n\nWASHINGTON – The Congressional Hunger Center honored U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) for leading passage of legislation to ensure kids have access to healthy, nutritious meals during the summer with the organization’s prestigious Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger Leadership Award.\n\nAs ranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Boozman worked with Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) to modernize U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) summer meal programs and permanently allow states flexibilities to reach more food-insecure children in need in addition to authorizing a national summer electronic benefit (EBT) program to eligible families. The pair’s measure was included in a funding package signed into law in December 2022.\n\n“The struggle many families have putting food on the table continues beyond the school year. Senator Stabenow and I recognized USDA’s summer meal program was in desperate need of modernization and worked together to make meaningful updates so children have more opportunities to access healthy food during the summer,” Boozman said. “I’m pleased to accept this award and am committed to ensuring that our nutrition programs remain strong and accessible to Americans in their time of need.”\n\nAs a member of the Senate Hunger Caucus, Boozman is working to combat the global food security crisis. The senator is championing bipartisan legislation that creates an innovative approach to tackle the growing international challenge by leveraging private sector dollars to improve food systems.\n\nThe Congressional Hunger Center is a bipartisan, nonprofit organization that works to make domestic and international hunger issues a priority to government officials and educates future leaders on ways to fight against hunger.\n\nThe Bill Emerson and Mickey Leland Hunger Leadership Award is named after Congressional leaders who spent their careers fighting hunger and poverty. Honorees are chosen for their significant contributions to combating hunger in the United States and overseas. They exemplify the determination necessary to make hunger and poverty a focal point in the United States and within Congress.\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nBoozman Shares Memories of River Valley Army Veteran\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) recognized the service of Keith Greene in ‘Salute to Veterans,’ a series highlighting the military service of Arkansans.\n\nKeith Greene was born in Jackson County, Missouri where he and his siblings grew up working in their dad’s grocery business. He remembered working hard from an early age with the rest of his family.\n\nGreene enrolled in junior college after graduating high school in 1960, but quickly realized he didn’t enjoy the class schedule or continuing to work for his dad.\n\n“I thought, you know, it’s time to make a change,” he recalled before enlisting in the Army in September 1961.\n\nHe was sent to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for basic training. Although it was in the same state, Greene remembered it being very different from his life at home.\n\n“It was an adventure because you never knew what the next day was going to bring,” he said. “It really opened my eyes.”\n\nHe learned a lot from the experienced soldiers around him who served in WWII and the Korean War and was reminded in simple ways of what they had endured. One day he noticed the holes in the used field training jacket he had been given and asked if it was eaten by a moth. He learned they were bullet holes. “That stuck with me,” he said.\n\nGreene also found that the skills he learned in his family’s business could help him in the Army, especially his ability to drive a truck. He had a chauffeur’s license and was frequently assigned to haul people all over the base. He remembered being thankful the job allowed him to get out of kitchen patrol duty.\n\nAfter basic training, he remained at Fort Leonard Wood for wheeled vehicle mechanic school.\n\n“That’s the Army’s thinking, you know, they’re going to let you fix something,” he said.\n\nHis first assignment after school was with the First Aviation Company at Fort Benning, Georgia, today known as Fort Moore.\n\nThe base became a hub for planning America’s response to the Cuban Missile Crisis and he put his truck driving skills to use again while stationed there. “We were just constantly picking up people coming in from all over the country. High-ranking brass and everybody that was involved with planning this invasion,” he said.\n\nDuring his time in Georgia he struck up a friendship with a commander who flew a helicopter and encouraged him to apply for flight school. Greene was accepted, but wasn’t successful in becoming an Army aviator. “I got over that,” he said given the high number of casualties of helicopter pilots in Vietnam.\n\nGreene’s next duty station was Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. “That was a neat place,” he recollected.\n\nOnce on base, his driving skills were noted when a commander looked at his records and Greene was assigned to serve as his driver.\n\nIn Hawaii he found himself closer to the war and able to follow news about what was happening in Vietnam. “We all kind of stayed in tune to things, the day room had TVs, we saw the news all the time.” It was also where he learned of the death of President Kennedy.\n\nIn February of 1964 Greene said an alert came down to board up everything and he was airlifted to Okinawa, Japan. He then unloaded ships of refurbished equipment and drove up into the mountains where he stayed for several weeks.\n\nHe said the trip was dangerous despite the reporting he read in an issue of Army Times that detailed the successful mission.\n\n“I mean we had all kinds of troubles with this stuff from the way they stored it on the ships,” Green also recalled tanks and trucks sliding off the road because they went through a snowstorm in the mountains.\n\nAfter completing his military service, Greene started a career in poultry distribution. He used the skills he learned from his dad to excel as a poultry salesman and eventually became a successful business owner.\n\nAlthough he did not fly for the Army, his earlier interest in aviation led him to pursue a private pilot’s license, which he used throughout his career. He owned many airplanes over the years and turned his passion into community service by introducing young people to aviation at the local Boys and Girls Club.\n\nGreene’s lifelong commitment to service included serving as the Mayor of Alma, Arkansas for several years and working with many veteran-related organizations. He continues to engage his fellow veterans as an active member of the American Legion, Military Officers Association of America and through his involvement in the Arkansas Military Veterans’ Hall of Fame.\n\nOne of his top priorities has been to recognize the service of his fellow veterans.\n\n“That has really been something that I have found really interesting and looking at their individual stories of what they did. People don’t realize what they’ve experienced, what they’ve done. It’s got ahold of me. I was glad I got on there and I’m still on,” Greene said about his work on the hall of fame.\n\nToday he is continuing his efforts in support of veterans by helping create a statewide Arkansas Veterans Coalition to be a voice in the Arkansas Legislature for men and women called to military service.\n\n“I enjoyed the Army, I really did and I think part of it was the fact that I was able to move around quite a bit during the time I was in,” he said about his service.\n\n“I’m grateful for Keith Greene’s service to our country in uniform and his continued commitment to public service and recognizing the unique experiences of veterans. I’m pleased to preserve his memories of a lifetime devoted to helping others,” Boozman said.\n\nBoozman will submit Greene’s entire interview to the Veterans History Project, an initiative of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center to collect and retain the oral histories of our nation’s veterans.\n\nDo you know a veteran interested in sharing their memories for the Salute to Veterans series? Nominate an Arkansas veteran to share their story by calling Boozman’s Fort Smith office at 479-573-0189.\n\nJune 7, 2024\n\nCommemorating D-Day 80 Years Later\n\nWorld War II was a generation-defining event. Perhaps no aspect was more significant than the invasion of Normandy, also known as D-Day, on June 6, 1944.\n\nEighty years since the massive undertaking codenamed Operation Overlord – which saw five naval assault divisions descend on the beaches of France including 7,000 ships and landing craft manned by over 195,000 naval personnel to transport 133,000 Allied troops – we still marvel at the scope and scale of this surprise attack that marked a turning point for the war’s European theater.\n\nAs time marches forward and more of the heroes who served in this assault pass on, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to hear firsthand what it was like to be part of such a tragic yet triumphant and strategically key moment. That’s why I firmly believe in highlighting this occasion and helping teach new generations of Americans about the sacrifices it required.\n\nI was proud to author and lead passage of a resolution commemorating the historic operation and expressing the Senate’s gratitude and appreciation to the members of the U.S. Armed Forces and Allied troops responsible for carrying out this unprecedented maneuver that proved decisive in securing victory against Nazi Germany.\n\nEvery year brings an opportunity to reflect on and honor this hallowed anniversary, recommit to educate our children and grandchildren about its importance and acknowledge the individuals who played their part in the epic battle for the future of freedom.\n\nAs Arkansans, we can be incredibly proud of the connections our state has to the courage and heroism that characterized so many stories from that day. Private First Class Harold Eugene Sellers of Jonesboro, a star athlete who passed up a football scholarship to the University of Arkansas to serve in the 101st Army Airborne, is one such example.\n\nHe was among the first casualties on D-Day when, while serving as a pathfinder marking the drop zone for his fellow paratroopers, he landed in a tree and was targeted by German machine guns. Sellers was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.\n\nWilliam Toombs of North Little Rock was a flight engineer and gunner aboard a B-24 aircraft who also took part in the operation. In fact, it was his first mission, and he still remembers the sight of the massive invading force below on the sea and alongside him in the skies.\n\nThey and thousands of other American and Allied soldiers played a significant role in liberating France and the wider European continent, which these citizens and their descendants still acknowledge today. I have been fortunate to witness the eternal gratitude on display for our World War II veterans when they return to the shores and villages they reclaimed from German occupation. Those special and moving scenes will never fade.\n\nIt has been a true privilege to participate in ceremonies at Normandy for the 75th and 80th anniversaries of D-Day, meeting these members of the Greatest Generation who defended freedom and changed the course of history, with many then returning home to lead normal, quiet lives and rebuild our own country.\n\nThis group of ordinary people who did extraordinary things must never be forgotten. Who they were, what they did and the sacrifices they made are all worth our deepest reverence. It is our duty to remember and honor their legacies, but also to live and serve in a manner worthy of their example.\n\nOn behalf of all Arkansans, I will always be proud to help carry on their memories and share their stories.\n\nJune 5, 2024\n\nSenate Approves Boozman-Coons Resolution Commemorating 80th Anniversary of D-Day\n\nWASHINGTON – In advance of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution introduced by U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Chris Coons (D-DE), co-chairs of the Senate French Caucus, commemorating this historic operation and expressing gratitude and appreciation to the members of the U.S. Armed Forces and Allied troops responsible for carrying out this unprecedented maneuver that proved decisive in securing victory in Europe.\n\n“It is our duty to recognize the service and sacrifice of the Allied forces members who helped turn the tide of World War II and free Western Europe from Nazi occupation. We will never forget the courage and heroism of those who took part in D-Day, including the thousands of individuals who gave their lives in support of this mission,” Boozman said. “I’m grateful the Senate approved the resolution commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion so we can pay tribute to the brave members of the Greatest Generation who changed the course of history.”\n\n“The Normandy landings were more than a battle in World War II–they were a turning point in history when thousands of Allied soldiers gave their lives to help freedom and democracy triumph over fascism and darkness. 80 years later, the Senate is proud to remember and honor the heroism and incredible bravery of those men who stormed the beaches of Normandy and began the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi oppression,” Coons said.\n\nIn the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, 31,000 members of the United States Armed Forces, and 153,000 of their counterparts in the Allied Expeditionary Force, launched Operation Overlord by storming ashore five landing areas on the beaches of Normandy, France. The first day of the operation, which became known as D-Day, saw approximately 10,000 Allied soldiers wounded or killed, including 6,000 Americans. Operation Overlord led to Allied liberation of Western Europe from the control of Nazi Germany and an end to World War II.\n\nClick here to read the resolution.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\nRecovering and Rebuilding\n\nThe sound of chainsaws has temporarily replaced the roar of traffic and other noises of daily life in locations across northern Arkansas. Communities are working to clear debris, recover and rebuild after severe storms and tornadoes recently tore through the state.\n\nSeeing the tragic results of Mother Nature’s power never gets easier. Unfortunately, Arkansans have experienced the daunting challenge of recovery in the aftermath of natural disasters. Natural State residents are known to have an unbreakable spirit. As in the past, they are standing together in the face of this hardship to build back stronger.\n\nIn the last several days I’ve witnessed families, neighbors and business owners come together to move downed trees, provide meals and find ways to help comfort friends and strangers in need.\n\nThe heart of our state is its people. There is nothing more Arkansas than dropping everything to support those facing a tragedy. The acts of kindness are abundant.\n\nWe are blessed to have local restaurants, entrepreneurs and businesses giving back. A downtown Rogers restauranteur whose home and businesses were mostly undamaged gave out hot dogs, burgers, drinks and snacks. More than 400 meals were handed out at the Benton County district court building and additional downtown shops are sharing what they can with volunteers and families without power or who’ve lost their homes.\n\nThat spirit can be found in other areas of the state. In Baxter County, after distributing food and water in the community, members of the Salesville Volunteer Fire Department were treated to local Mexican food from a small business owner. The Food Bank of North Central Arkansas packed boxes of food to distribute to families impacted by the storms.\n\nI am grateful for first responders for their quick action to save lives and rescue folks trapped in their homes and administer first aid. I appreciate the leadership of local and state emergency management officials who helped mobilize immediate response efforts as they continue to manage the recovery process and delivery of assistance.\n\nThe coordination and collaboration with all levels of government is crucial at a time like this. As we work closely on various aspects of the response, I appreciated the opportunity to join Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Congressman Steve Womack and emergency management officials including Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell to assess damage. Having an open line of communication as issues arise is important to the long-term success of these efforts.\n\nWe’re using every resource in our toolbox to support the immediate needs of our state. That includes the governor authorizing the Arkansas National Guard to help with recovery efforts in Benton County and distribute potable water, as well as urging the president’s approval for the governor’s request for a federal disaster declaration to deliver critical relief.\n\nAs crews clean up from this disaster, we can be proud of the willingness of Natural State residents to lend a helping hand to our neighbors and communities facing a long road to recovery. Arkansans have been in this position before and it’s demonstrated who we are as compassionate, caring folks eager to serve one another. More than anything else, that is what will carry us to a successful recovery and rebuilding of homes, businesses and lives. Please continue to keep all those impacted in your prayers.\n\nMay 29 2024\n\nArkansas Delegation Supports Governor’s Request for Major Disaster Declaration\n\nWASHINGTON— U.S. Senators John Boozman and Tom Cotton—along with Congressmen Steve Womack, Rick Crawford, French Hill and Bruce Westerman—wrote to President Joe Biden urging him to support Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request for a major disaster declaration as a result of severe storms in Benton, Boone and Marion Counties on May 26.\n\n“We encourage the president to quickly approve federal aid to help speed up recovery efforts in Arkansas,” members said.\n\nThe letter can be found here and below:\n\nDear Mr. President:\n\nOn behalf of the State of Arkansas, we are writing to support Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to declare a major disaster, pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, as a result of severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that began on May 24, 2024, and are continuing.\n\nAs Governor Sanders noted in her request, the severity of this event created disastrous amounts of debris, severe infrastructure damage, and resulted in the deaths of at least nine citizens and injured countless others. Arkansans will continue to feel the destructive impact of this storm as we work to rebuild.\n\nPreliminary damage estimates conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency show major impacts to local jurisdictions in Benton, Boone, and Marion Counties exceeding an estimated $6.4 million in damages. At least 217 homes were destroyed with an additional 94 sustaining major damage. In total, over 478 homes were affected by the storms, leaving a large number of Arkansans displaced and many counties left without power for days.\n\nDespite facing significant hardships from the severe storm, Arkansans have demonstrated remarkable resourcefulness and resilience. Communities from across the state have come together to support one another during this challenging time. But as it stands, we believe the magnitude of this weather event warrants supplemental federal assistance. The above-mentioned counties have seen homes, businesses, and important infrastructure severely damaged, and federal government resources will be critical in restoration efforts.\n\nThe entire Arkansas delegation is eager to assist in any way possible to ensure expedited evaluation of this request. Please do not hesitate to contact our offices with any questions. We thank you for your support, and respectfully ask for your attention and assistance in providing the resources necessary to ensure the safety and full recovery of Arkansans.\n\nMay 24, 2024\n\nFulfilling a Basic Duty to Arkansans\n\nI am honored to serve Arkansas in the United States Senate. A critical part of that responsibility is casting votes on the Senate floor, but another key component that often falls below the radar is helping bridge gaps between Natural State residents and the federal government. Interacting with federal officials can be overwhelming and time consuming, but my staff and I are here to help make that process easier for constituents in need of answers regarding critical benefits and services.\n\nFrom the IRS to Social Security, Medicare, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), international adoption, visas and many other issues, our office has successfully helped navigate the roadblocks with government agencies and we continue working on behalf of Arkansans all across our state with our time and resources.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we received more than 700 requests for assistance with federal matters. Annually, the top issues Arkansans seek our support on are veteran-related, with frequent inquiries about Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability, benefits claims and health care.\n\nOne veteran’s spouse reached out when her husband needed urgent medical care. My staff alerted the proper Little Rock VA officials about this emergency and medical center employees worked with the family to deliver the care and treatment he needed.\n\nAlready, 342 requests have been made this year for help with military records and service medals.\n\nThe daughter of a Korean War veteran ran into dead ends trying to get her father’s military records and learn if he was eligible for the Purple Heart. My office was honored to help obtain his records and get the Purple Heart verified in time to honor his service and sacrifice as part of his 95th birthday celebration.\n\nI’m pleased we were able to cut through that red tape for this Arkansan and thousands of others who have served in our nation’s uniform, and I look forward to helping many more.\n\nBut our assistance extends beyond the VA. We recently aided a constituent experiencing a social security problem when, even after filing the correct paperwork, the result was an unreasonably long processing time. My team contacted the agency and asked employees to look into the delay, which generated quick action to resolve the problem. This is hardly an isolated incident, as this year we’ve received 90 requests for assistance with Social Security issues.\n\nThese and numerous other examples of constituent service don’t make headlines, but they do make a real difference in the lives of individual Arkansans. In the coming days I’ll be sharing on social media testimonials of how our outreach has helped facilitate, expedite or correct veteran’s benefits, emergency passports, Social Security Disability Insurance, military service medals and many others.\n\nMy highest priority is making sure the federal government is working for Arkansans. That means providing the best possible constituent service and helping get answers for Natural State residents. I’m proud of the work of my staff as they use their years of experience in these matters to advocate for the people of our state. Can we help you? Consider reaching out to us if there is a matter you’re trying to resolve involving the federal government.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nExploring National Parks this Summer\n\nSummer is quickly approaching and Arkansans are looking for places to explore away from home. Our national parks have always been popular destinations and some folks are crowdsourcing for ideas about locations to visit and things to do at these outdoor gems.\n\nAmerica’s National Parks continue to see a record number of visitors. The National Park Service (NPS) reported a four percent increase last year with more than 325 million visits. Arkansans planning a summer road trip to any of our national treasures are encouraged to plan ahead to make sure they have the opportunity to see everything on their wish list.\n\nAs a result of the increasing demand, more locations require reservations for timed entry. At some parks, this is only for the most popular sites and peak times. However, many of our busiest parks require reservations for all park-goers as officials try to better manage resources and make sure visitors get to experience the full beauty and history of these important places.\n\nBe sure to check out the reservation system used by many of our parks, campgrounds and historic sites across the country at www.recreation.gov. This site handles everything from a day pass at Rocky Mountain National Park to tour reservations at Blanchard Springs Caverns in Arkansas. Available dates are rolled out at different times, so check back frequently. In addition, some parks and campgrounds still handle their own booking, so be sure to check this website and the specific webpage for the destination.\n\nFor outdoor enthusiasts planning to spend a lot of time in the national parks, it’s worth considering getting an annual or lifetime pass to sites managed by NPS. These range in price, but are less expensive for individuals 62 and older. Congress also recently passed a law making them free for veterans, Gold Star Families, active-duty military and their dependents, Americans with permanent disabilities and fourth graders nationwide.\n\nAdditionally, NPS offers several free entrance days during the year for all national park visitors. The remaining days in 2024 are June 19, August 4, September 28 and November 11.\n\nArkansans opting for a staycation or a long weekend close to home are blessed with easy access to beautiful state and federal parks, forests and historic sites – many of which are free to visit. The National Historic Site in Fort Smith recently announced it is now fee-free so families can enjoy the museum and walk around the grounds on the banks of the Arkansas River at no cost.\n\nI have been proud to help deliver significant investments for the upkeep of public lands alongside most of my colleagues as we approved initiatives such as the bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA). The measure became law in 2020 and is now supporting the repair backlog in our national parks and public lands infrastructure nationwide including locations in Arkansas.\n\nHot Springs National Park received GAOA funds to make two more historic bathhouse buildings more accessible, safe and energy efficient, which will allow the park to lease the buildings to private business.\n\nIn Fort Smith, funding from GAOA was used for preservation and restoration on the historic Commissary Building at the National Historic Site.\n\nDocumentarian Ken Burns calls the national parks “America’s best idea.” These jewels of our country’s landscape are settings perfect for exploring and learning. We’re working to protect and enhance them so Arkansans can plan to visit these popular destinations on summer vacations and experience the unique offerings they hold for years to come.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nBoozman Honored by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America\n\nWASHINGTON – Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) honored U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) with its 2024 Leadership in Government Award in recognition of his advocacy for policies to improve the services and benefits veterans and their families have earned.\n\n“I’m proud to work with IAVA to ensure we fulfill the promises made to the men and women who served in uniform. We’ve been able to accomplish landmark improvements for women veterans and toxic-exposed veterans thanks to the dedicated support of IAVA members. I appreciate this honor and look forward to continuing our collaboration to make meaningful improvements in the lives of these unsung heroes,” Boozman said.\n\n“Senator John Boozman has been a leader on behalf of the post-9/11 generation of veterans as he has answered our calls for action over and over again,” said IAVA CEO Allison Jaslow. “When IAVA put rocket fuel into the conversation about the need to address issues facing women veterans when we launched our She Who Borne the Battle campaign in 2017, Senator Boozman stepped up. He helped deliver a big win for women veterans after working hand in hand with us to craft the Deborah Sampson Act, which is now law, and a huge win for all veterans who’ve experienced toxic exposure thanks to his leadership that contributed to passage of the PACT Act. It’s an honor to recognize Senator Boozman’s efforts on behalf of my generation of veterans, and IAVA’s more than 425,000 members, with our 2024 Leadership in Government award.”\n\nAs a senior member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funding, Boozman has been a leader in delivering additional resources to support the needs of veterans and their families.\n\nThe senator has championed a number of significant improvements that were signed into law in recent years to enhance or expand veterans benefits including transformational legislation expanding VA health care to toxic-exposed veterans of all eras and strengthening VA care and services for women veterans.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nInvestments in Arkansas Treatment Courts Save Lives\n\nArkansans advocating for issues important to them regularly come to Washington to participate in Hill Day, a time to meet with their senators and representatives and encourage them to support their policy goals. The message I share with the groups meeting with Members of Congress is to personalize their visits with stories about how rules and regulations impact their operations and customers as well as how what they do enhances the community and improves their state. It’s especially moving to hear from individuals who share their personal experiences to demonstrate the need for action and why their proposed solutions are warranted.\n\nArkansas Circuit Court Judge Thomas Smith administers the Benton County treatment courts, an initiative that offers drug-addicted, non-violent offenders an alternative to jail while rehabilitating them through a strenuous treatment program. The judge recently introduced me to Kyra, a graduate of the drug court.\n\nKyra said she tested the program, and when she saw the drug court staff believed in her, it gave her the confidence to believe in herself. This changed her outlook and ultimately helped her overcome her struggles with addiction and turn her life around. Now she’s inspiring others in Benton County on their own path to recovery. We can be proud of Kyra’s accomplishment and her continued leadership in the fight against drug addiction.\n\nJudge Smith and Kyra’s stories highlighted the success of Benton County treatment courts and provided justification for enhanced investment. Arkansas is fortunate to be experiencing the benefits of this program. In Benton County the treatment courts have an 85 percent graduation rate. One graduate called it a “blessing” that can change your life.\n\nFor more than two decades, drug courts have proven effective in helping break the cycle of addiction. Nationwide, more than 4,000 treatment courts help 150,000 individuals annually. This approach has become a critical tool for the judicial system that is cost-effective and cuts crime, with data showing treatment courts have reduced crime by 58 percent.\n\nI’ve had the opportunity to attend a drug court graduation. The optimism and pride on display from graduates and families is inspiring. It represents a turning point in a long journey, where the search for a solution once seemed hopeless – but treatment courts deliver a path for a brighter future. They help keep families together and break the generational cycle of addiction.\n\nThroughout Arkansas more than 100 specialty court programs target drug and substance abuse for people of all ages and populations. This idea has expanded to veterans and mental health. Last year, the Arkansas Legislature approved allowing judges to establish family treatment. These courts provide treatment and accountability to parents with substance use disorders while prioritizing the well-being of their children.\n\nMay is recognized as National Treatment Court Month. This is a time to highlight the positive impact this alternative approach to drug and substance abuse has on our communities by leading people out of the justice system and into long-term recovery.\n\nChanging the habits of Arkansans and guiding people like Kyra to a second chance at life through this commonsense method are great outcomes. Treatment court graduates are living proof there is still hope for those struggling to overcome addiction. I’m proud to advocate for resources that sustain and expand this critical program as it improves public safety, helps conserve taxpayer dollars and, most importantly, saves lives.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nVIDEO: Boozman, Cotton Pay Tribute to Former Senator David Pryor\n\nClick here to watch the Senate tribute to David Pryor\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) spoke on the Senate floor honoring the life of former Arkansas Governor and U.S. Senator David Pryor.\n\n“Every interaction with David Pryor conveyed that he cared and that he wanted to help. That posture certainly worked to his advantage over decades in public life,” Boozman said. “Senator Pryor leaves behind a legacy of public service rich with accomplishments that made a difference in the lives of Arkansans and people all across our country. He modeled statesmanship and stewardship so incredibly well, and we celebrate everything he represented.”\n\n“David Pryor led Arkansas through recession and recovery and left an enduring legacy on state government. He fought for what he believed would make Arkansas better. I join with Senator Boozman in honoring former-Senator Pryor—a great Arkansan, statesman and dedicated public servant,” said Cotton.\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate passed a resolution honoring the life and legacy of the late senator.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nBoozman, Cotton Applaud Senate Confirmation of Gary Grimes to Serve as U.S. Marshal\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Tom Cotton (R-AR) applauded Senate confirmation of Gary Grimes to serve as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Arkansas.\n\n“Gary Grimes has dedicated his career to public safety. I am confident he will continue to serve Arkansas with the same honor and distinction he has demonstrated as a law enforcement officer. I congratulate Gary on his new role as U.S. Marshal,” Boozman said.\n\n“As U.S. Marshal, Gary Grimes will continue to diligently serve the state of Arkansas, just as he has done for decades. I congratulate him on his confirmation and wish him the best in his new role,” Cotton said.\n\nSince 2011, Grimes has served as the principal owner of Grimes & Associates, LLC, a law enforcement, security and government affairs consultancy. Grimes has a worked in a number of law enforcement capacities including as Liaison to Law Enforcement and Emergency Management for Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe from 2007 to 2011. Prior to that role Grimes served as a law enforcement officer in Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas including as the Sheriff of Sebastian County from 1989 to 1999.\n\nApril 26, 2024\n\nCelebrating Arkansas Small Businesses\n\nSmall businesses play an integral role in the growth and development of our communities. They are the backbone of our economy and represent core values that are at the heart of America – hard work, risk-taking and success. Each year we recognize their important contributions to our state and nation during National Small Business Week.\n\nSmall businesses saturate our communities, but launching, operating and growing them is no small feat. The lifeblood is capital, but it also takes mentorship, expertise and a lot of thankless work.\n\nAs part of events commemorating National Small Business Week from April 28-May 4, the U.S. Small Business Administration highlights entrepreneurs from across the country for their determination and contributions to our economy in an awards ceremony in the nation’s capital.\n\nArkansas entrepreneur Lynette West is our state’s Small Business Person of the Year for 2024. The Jonesboro business owner operates HealthWear Corporation, a boutique business that offers medical uniforms and accessories.\n\nHer hands-on approach has helped create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere in the store, attracting a loyal customer base. As a result of her leadership, HealthWear has received recognition not only for its stellar reputation among clientele, but also for the quality of its products, including an award for best uniform from Premiere Magazine in northeast Arkansas. These accolades and West’s pursuit of support and mentorship have helped her guide the business through challenges and opportunities alike.\n\nIt’s important for West and other entrepreneurs to have access to capital so they can invest in their operations and workforce. We must advance policies that encourage borrowers and lenders, not make it harder to access the resources necessary to sustain or expand a venture.\n\nIn our economic system we know there are risks, and some protection from them is necessary, but the Biden administration is proposing and implementing regulations that are actually hurting small businesses and the banks and credit unions that support them.\n\nAt a time when capital has quickly become more expensive, regulators are adding to the problem and discouraging banks from lending. This ultimately deters investment and growth in our small businesses.\n\nI’m proud to lead legislation to turn back overreach and preserve access to capital. The Small Lender Act addresses concerns about a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule which would require lenders to solicit social factors from small business borrowers and divulge it to federal bureaucrats in Washington. While discrimination of any form is wrong, this rule would prioritize social factors over creditworthiness in small business lending, place additional red tape on lenders and making it harder for businesses to obtain critical financing.\n\nThe Small Lender Act would remove this red tape for certain lenders and small business borrowers, making it easier for capital to get to the enterprises that depend on it the most.\n\nCompanion legislation is sponsored by Arkansas Congressman French Hill. Natural State small businesses owners, and our family, friends and neighbors who establish or are employed by them, can be proud knowing we are working to improve policies to support their success.\n\nOur state is home to more than 258,000 small businesses that employ more than 500,000 people. By supporting Arkansas and American small businesses, we can help revitalize our economy and strengthen the operations that underpin it. I’m proud to advance and promote pro-growth and pro-job policies that create an environment of certainty for job creators to plan for the future and enhance their operations.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nBoozman Votes to Approve National Security Assistance Package\n\nLegislation Supports U.S. Allies, Invests in Arkansas’s Defense Industry\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) released the following statement after voting to approve legislation that supports America’s allies, serves our national security interests and bolsters the domestic defense industrial base:\n\n“American leadership is the most effective tool to deter conflict and promote the values that advance global stability and prosperity, particularly when the world is more dangerous now than in decades. We cannot ignore or minimize rising threats and must support our allies directly confronting them – as this national security package does. By countering Russian, Chinese and Iranian aggression, we are emboldening the allies of freedom and making strategic investments in our own defense capabilities, including through vital arms manufacturing operations in Camden, Arkansas.”\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nMore Farm in the Farm Bill\n\nI’ve been on the road visiting with farmers, ranchers, foresters, rural community leaders and nutrition specialists since we began undertaking the daunting task of writing a new farm bill.\n\nAt the invitation of my colleagues, I’ve traveled across the country to hear directly from stakeholders as to what we need to include in this contract between Congress and our nation’s agriculture community. In fact, I just joined Senator John Thune in his home state of South Dakota for my 19th farm bill listening session this month.\n\nWhile we’ve received plenty of valuable input at every stop, there has been a reoccurring theme from the outset when I joined Senator John Hoeven in North Dakota for my very first listening session.\n\nThe takeaway from that event has been echoed across the countryside and in meetings throughout Washington – “we need more farm in the farm bill.”\n\nAs the Republican leader of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am committed to making that happen. This next farm bill must update the risk management tools farmers and ranch"
