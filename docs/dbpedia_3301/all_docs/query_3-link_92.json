        "text": "WASHINGTON—Dr. Robert Lewis, the former directional leader of Fellowship Bible Church of Little Rock, delivered the opening prayer in the U.S. Senate as the guest chaplain at the recommendation of U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR).\n\nBoozman played football with Dr. Lewis at the University of Arkansas and recalled those days while thanking him for delivering the prayer.\n\n“Robert and I had the opportunity to play football at the University of Arkansas together. He was a very good football player and he had the gift of ‘smack.’ He would hit you. He had a tremendous work ethic and tremendous character. We all knew he would do well in whatever he decided to do. Today, Robert is a renowned pastor, best-selling author, passionate speaker and Christian visionary,” Boozman said.\n\nDuring his remarks, Boozman highlighted Dr. Lewis’ accomplishments and contributions to the faith community in Arkansas and beyond.\n\n“For twenty-one years, Robert served as directional leader of Fellowship Bible Church of Little Rock. During that time the church grew from several hundred members to over five thousand and was widely recognized as being one of the most innovative and influential churches in America. He developed a curriculum that has reached over one million men worldwide in churches, colleges campuses, corporate boardrooms and correctional facilities,” Boozman said.\n\nThe Senate Chaplain invites two ordained clergy members, each month, to pray in the Senate as guest chaplains. Guest chaplains have represented all the world's major religious faiths.\n\nVideo of Dr. Lewis’ prayer on the Senate floor and Boozman’s remarks following the invocation can be found below."
