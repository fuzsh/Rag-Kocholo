        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the David Kusnet interview as a part of the Clinton Presidential History Project. We’re very appreciative of your coming to Charlottesville to do this. We’ve just had a conversation before the recording about the fundamental ground rules to understand the confidentiality of the proceedings. The other housekeeping thing we always do is to start out with a voice identification. So I’ll ask everybody to identify himself and say a few words just so the transcriber will know who we are.\n\nI’m Russell Riley. I head the Clinton project in the oral history program here. I have been at the Miller Center for ten years now.\n\nNelson\n\nI’m Mike Nelson and I’m here in town from Memphis, Tennessee, to do this interview.\n\nKusnet\n\nI’m David Kusnet. Thank you for having me out here.\n\nRiley\n\nDelighted to have you here. We had an email exchange beforehand where you said that you had some things that you’d like to start with. I wonder if you want to do that, or would you prefer for us to bore in with questions first?\n\nKusnet\n\nI’m thinking of this not as an introductory statement, but sort of as a menu of things that I’m prepared to talk about.\n\nRiley\n\nExcellent.\n\nKusnet\n\nI have one disclaimer. One rule of speechmaking and speechwriting, which I’m probably going to break, is you should never talk for more minutes than there are people in the room. I am most certainly going to break that rule. I’ll try to address the questions you had at the end of the briefing book to see if there is some unifying framework for them.\n\nI worked in the Clinton campaign in 1992 and the first two years in the White House, which in a sense flowed from the campaign. Nineteen ninety-two was a very unusual year politically. The first President [George H.W.] Bush started out that election cycle prohibitively ahead of any possible opponent, and as a result a lot of the punditry in the early drafts of history says that none of the first-tier Democrats ran for President that year because they didn’t think they could win.\n\nMaybe I’m a partisan, but I would argue that one first-tier Democrat did run and won, and his name was Bill Clinton. Of all the Democrats at that time who were seen as credible Presidents—Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Al Gore, Mario Cuomo, Lloyd Bentsen, and others—the only one who did run was Bill Clinton. He was someone who had been preparing to run for President and to be President almost all of his life. He was someone who had given a great deal of thought, not just to what it took to be elected President, but to what he would do after becoming President.\n\nHe came into the campaign and into the Presidency with a distinct political philosophy, a distinct strategy, a distinct policy outlook. He came in with his own way of talking and speaking, which flowed from his experience in politics in Arkansas, where I believe he ran for office somewhere between five and seven times and lost only two elections, one for Congress the first time—the first election he ever ran in—and one for reelection as Governor, and won every other election that he was in.\n\nThere was a way of talking that flowed from a whole bunch of things, including a lot about him that is fairly well known. I guess one thing that is well known, but people maybe haven’t thought of the consequences of it—Arkansas is a small state. It doesn’t have the kind of dense array of institutions that you have in a place like New York or Pennsylvania or Michigan, so he was mostly used to talking to small audiences. You don’t have much of a labor movement in Arkansas, so he’s not used to, as someone coming up not only in New York and Pennsylvania but a state like Minnesota would be used to, talking to a large union audience. He never had that experience.\n\nIt’s a Democratic state, but it doesn’t have the huge, well-organized Democratic Party that you have, say, in Chicago. So he’s not used to addressing a big torchlight parade the night before an election as Democrats used to do in Chicago. Before he ran for President, he was used to addressing small audiences. Probably the largest audiences that he was used to addressing were in churches. That’s the major social institution in Arkansas that brings a large number of people together to hear speakers. So he’s a man of parts as a speaker. He can be a teacher and he can be a preacher. He can be a policy wonk. But he was most of all used to speaking to small audiences and to trying to relate to people as individuals, even if they were individuals that happened to be gathered together to hear him talk.\n\nAs one of his biographers, David Maraniss, said, he was first in his class. He was part of a cohort of Democratic Party office holders, political operatives, policy experts, sort of the early edge of the baby-boom generation. He came with a cohort including, I think, mostly baby boomers, some like me, younger baby boomers than he was, some people younger than that. This was a Democratic Party cohort that roughly spanned the period from the end of the [Jimmy] Carter administration to the Clinton administration. Both parties have cohorts. I think the Democratic Party, until recently at least, hasn’t been as good as the Republican Party at developing and nurturing a cohort of people.\n\nIf you go back to 1991, 1992, there really wasn’t any successful model for a Democratic Presidency until you went back maybe to President [John F.] Kennedy. President Carter—a very good man, but he was not a successful President.\n\nLyndon Johnson had an enormous positive impact on American life, but his Presidency did not end happily either. John Kennedy’s Presidency of course did not end happily, but that was not through circumstances under his control, and as there should be, there is the aura of success and greatness about him. You’ve got to go back that far. Theodore Sorensen would be advising us from the sidelines, but he’s not about to move out to Little Rock and work in a Democratic Presidential campaign. So what you had was a cohort of people who may have been successful or unsuccessful in other things in life, but they had not known victory in national politics. I wrote campaign literature for the public employee union, AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] for Senator Kennedy in the 1980 primaries, but my real beginning in Presidential politics was as a speechwriter for Walter Mondale in 1984 and then for Michael Dukakis in 1988. So I had been on a losing team twice.\n\nComing into the Clinton campaign, I noticed a lot of people whom I had known from the Mondale and especially Dukakis campaigns. So this was a cadre of people who probably had a relatively high opinion of themselves and even of each other, but had not yet played on a winning team in national politics. I think it is kind of a metaphor for the whole cohort of Democratic Party consultants, policy experts.\n\nNelson\n\nThey knew how to get a nomination but not win a general.\n\nKusnet\n\nRight, in ’91 and ’92. There was something that the journalist and later Clinton staffer, Sidney Blumenthal, called the conversation. There was quite a discussion during that period, especially—I guess the period from 1988 through 1992—of what it would take to elect a Democratic President and what a Democratic President should do after being elected. There was an enormous amount of articles, talks, discussions back and forth about what kind of strategy could elect a President and then make a President worth electing.\n\nI think more than any Democrat who ran in ’92 and probably more than any Democrat who didn’t run, Bill Clinton was part of that conversation. As a successful Governor of a conservative state, as a leader in the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate Democrats, as a leader in the National Governors Association, a leader in the Democratic Governors Association. He had offered all kinds of strategic advice, all kinds of policy solutions, and then as now he is very much a networker. He was in touch with a lot of the people in that cohort who were thinking about political strategy and policy ideas.\n\nThen he puts these into practice, and lo and behold he gets nominated, which did not look that likely when he started out. People thought Mario Cuomo would be nominated if he ran, and if Cuomo didn’t run coming off of the Gulf War, Bob Kerrey, as a war hero, could best challenge President Bush.\n\nBill Clinton gets nominated, he gets elected, and he becomes President. He gets reelected, survives an impeachment, and appears in the year 2001, when he leaves office, to have been successful in policy. The country is prosperous and at peace. A lot of the social divisions have either been healed or projected onto him so that he is enormously controversial, but I think Americans are more at ease with each other in the year 2000 than they were in the year 1991. I think there was a little less racial and social and class antagonism in the country than there had been before Clinton came in.\n\nIt looked at that time that he had come up with a successful formula, not only for moderate progressive politics in this country, but for moderate progressive politics internationally. There was something called the Third Way, which was a new way for progressives around the world to present themselves and govern. Most famously, Tony Blair in Britain got elected and reelected when there had not been a Labour Party Prime Minister in Britain since before Margaret Thatcher.\n\nHe and President Clinton are close with each other. Some other leaders around the world—[Lionel] Jospin in France, Alan Garcia in Peru, Ehud Barak in Israel, were also seen as following this strategy. Fast-forward eight years and a lot of it seems washed away. The country is not at peace; the country is not prosperous. Looking back from the vantage point of eight years afterward it looks like the ’90s were a time in between serious things happening in the country and in the world and there is a tendency to minimize Clinton, to see him as someone of great talent who didn’t achieve what he could have achieved, and Clintonism was more a matter of strategy and tactics than of philosophy and accomplishment.\n\nBoth George W. Bush, and in the Democratic primaries in 2008 Barack Obama, talked about the Clinton years in similar ways: as a time of not taking on serious issues, just looking for political advantage. I would mostly disagree with that. But that’s certainly something for us to talk about. I think I’m 50 percent a Clinton Democrat and 50 percent a Democrat who was working for Bill Clinton.\n\nPrior to working for Clinton I had worked for Mondale and Dukakis. I worked for the Public Employee Union, AFSCME for about ten years, for the civil liberties group People for the American Way for several years, and suburban newspapers in New York and Connecticut before that. I was part of the conversation before ’92. I wrote a book called Speaking American that was one of these prescriptive books for the Democratic Party that focused on rhetoric as a way of talking about other things as well.\n\nThe one thing that united the conversation was a sense that whatever we had done in 1984 and in 1988 clearly had not been working, and we had to do something different if we intended to win. As Bill Clinton used to say, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and thinking if you keep on doing it you’re going to get a different result. There was, I think, a consensus in the Democratic Party between ’88 and ’92 that whatever we did, if we wanted to get a different result from ’84 and ’88, it had to be different from what we did in ’84 and ’88.\n\nSpeaking American argued for being more populist in economics than Dukakis had been. It argued for making a more explicit effort to be mainstream on social issues than Mondale and Dukakis, even though they were both very responsible, middle-class Americans. As members of what was called the silent generation, they both didn’t think they had to belabor their sharing the values of most Americans. It ventured into some speculation about how Democrats could change Americans’ minds, not only about the Democratic Party and its leaders but also about America itself. How there would be ways of getting what was then at least demographically a non-Hispanic, white, middle-class majority in the country to look differently at those who were different from them or appeared to be different from them. How unions could reintroduce themselves to people, how the idea of public service in government could be reintroduced to people. So there was a lot about what later came to be called reframing.\n\nAbout how you could stand for many of the same things but present it differently. That led to the title, Speaking American, which had a double meaning. First it was just how you can talk plainspoken American English, but secondly how you could speak to American values and American experiences better than we had done in ’84 and ’88.\n\nThe book reintroduced me to people I already knew as someone who had also been doing some rethinking and was part of the conversation. Bill Clinton read the book. That gave me a vantage point in the campaign and in the first two years in the administration of being seen as somebody who wasn’t just a practitioner, but also had a point of view. Anyhow, that’s a lengthy menu of some things we might talk about.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s a fabulous arc, and there’s an awful lot in there that we want to bore into. Let me begin by asking, if you wouldn’t mind—you said that you felt like you were 50 percent a Clinton Democrat and 50 percent a Democrat working for Clinton. We’re always interested in finding out a bit more about how you came by your own Democratic principles and sensibilities, your own biography as you’re working up to the point that you get involved in Presidential politics. Could you take a couple of minutes and tell us about your personal background and how your partisanship gets shaped?\n\nKusnet\n\nI grew up mostly in Brooklyn, New York. You really didn’t know too many Republicans there.\n\nRiley\n\nWell, I grew up in Alabama and I didn’t know too many Republicans either.\n\nKusnet\n\nTo talk about Clinton, one of his many talents was he was able to drop cultural signifiers with people. They would get very different groups of people to think, This guy gets it. Introducing himself to Democrats from outside of Arkansas in ’91 and the ’92 primaries, he had some challenges. First, people mistakenly thought he was from a privileged background when he wasn’t, because he had been out of Georgetown and Yale and Oxford and was so well spoken and young looking.\n\nThey also thought, since he was from the DLC [Democratic Leadership Council] and from Arkansas that he might be a conservative. In order to get Democratic audiences to identify with him, he would say—I’m not southern so I can’t say it the way he did—My grand pappy, my granddad thought that when he died and he went to see Jesus he’d meet [Franklin D.] Roosevelt. That would send the cultural signifier he was a real Democrat.\n\nAs a baby boomer, when I was growing up the older people were the depression generation. They had been Roosevelt Democrats, and they probably never thought of voting for any Republican other than maybe Jacob Javits. So that’s the world that I grew up in. My parents were the first in their families to go to college and have white-collar jobs. I grew up in one of these co-op housing developments in New York City, a smaller version of Co-op City, much smaller. But I think it was ultimately sponsored and funded by unions. My parents had been union members earlier in their lives, and a lot of the people in the housing development were union members or retired union members.\n\nI grew up in the traditions of the Democratic Party. I think part of what the ’80s meant for me and probably for a lot of people in that cohort was seeing that what we had thought was a majority in looking at this country wasn’t anymore. Someone like Mondale could run around America saying things you believed in and almost took for granted and only get 41 percent of the vote. And Clinton dropped enough cultural signifiers with people like me to suggest that he really deep inside shared our way of looking at the world but knew that it wasn’t the way that most people looked at the world any longer.\n\nNelson\n\nHow’d you get interested in politics and active in politics at first?\n\nKusnet\n\nI grew up, not around people who were running for office or working for people who were running for office, but people who talked about politics. I remember, it must have been 1956, wanting to watch some kid show on TV and my father wanting to watch Adlai Stevenson make a speech. It would be nice to tell a story that I listened and was inspired, but I probably just left the room.\n\nI don’t think there were too many [Richard] Nixon bumper stickers in Brooklyn in 1960, but I remember tearing down one of them. So it was just sort of assumed that that was something you were. You might be critical of the Democrats when they were in office or if they were losing a campaign, but you certainly wouldn’t be a Republican.\n\nI was in high school in New York City in ’68. That generational cohort—sometimes they call it in this country the ’68-ers, people for whom 1968 was the introductory or the formative experience in politics—had been influential ever since. I remember in ’68 having been, in succession, for Eugene McCarthy, then Robert Kennedy, then very reluctantly for Hubert Humphrey, and getting into all kinds of arguments. Doing canvassing in different places for them, and also for Paul O’Dwyer who ran for Senator as a peace Democrat and got clobbered.\n\nA funny story is that I met Dick Morris at that time. He was something very different from what he became. At that time he was a student at Columbia and he was, I think, organizing for a new generation of reform Democrats on the west side of Manhattan who were challenging the old generation. The old generation was pretty honorable people and I’m not sure the new generation turned out any better than the old generation did. But I remember at that time some friends of mine had some lists—this is long before the Internet or any modern communication technology. At that time in New York City, politics was largely a matter of figuring out a way to get into an apartment building and then going door-to-door and canvassing it.\n\nWe had a bunch of index cards of high school kids who were willing to do campaign work, and that was a very valuable commodity then. I remember Dick Morris really trying to cajole different ones of us to give him this list of young people who would be willing to be foot soldiers in primaries in New York City. So that got me into it. I think at that time I wanted to be a writer. It never entered my head that I’d run for office myself. I don’t think I had any fantasies about working in the White House or working on campaigns.\n\nThere was much less of a mystique then about speechwriting and about campaign operatives than there is now. There was as much or more of a mystique about writers than there is now.\n\nNelson\n\nWriting in journalism?\n\nKusnet\n\nYes, journalism. I don’t think I ever thought I had it in me to write fiction, but maybe to write works of nonfiction—write The Other America 30 years later, some kind of social criticism.\n\nAfter college I worked at newspapers. Then I had a friend who was heading up the AFSCME organizing campaign in Illinois and she wanted me to work for her. I got interviewed by AFSCME. At that time it was a very dynamic but also a fluid organization. I ended up getting a job in their headquarters in Washington, D.C. Then just through shaking up staff, they needed someone to write speeches for the national president, and they gave me a chance.\n\nAbout a year and a half later they remembered I wanted to go to Illinois and they sent me to Illinois where AFSCME was concluding the campaign to organize more than 40,000 state employees and negotiate their first union contracts. When I came back from Illinois, I became a traveling PR trouble-shooter and then the national coordinator for what they called the field PR staff.\n\nBut, once a speechwriter, always a speechwriter. There is a Eugene McCarthy line that to be a football coach you have to be smart enough to know how to do it and dumb enough to think it’s important. There would always be jobs for football coaches because they all knew each other and took care of each other.\n\nBack in the late 1970s and early 80s before databases, but with Rolodexes, having been the speechwriter for the President of AFSCME, I was in the roster of Democratic speechwriters. In 1979, Vice President Mondale’s chief speechwriter, Marty Kaplan, was looking for another speechwriter and called me up.\n\nI turned it down. I thought correctly that Carter and Mondale were not going to get reelected and I’d be out of work in about a year, as exciting as it would be to work for them. I thought Teddy Kennedy might run and I thought I might be for him. I said no, but I said no with my best effort at civility and friendliness and gratitude. So I kept up—at least I didn’t antagonize him.\n\nOne rule is, be nice to people when they’re down. I was working in an AFSCME organizing campaign in Connecticut the day after Election Day 1980 when Carter and Mondale lost, but I made a point to call Marty Kaplan up that day and thank him for having offered me the job, and while he didn’t need my help, offering to help him. So that maintained the relationship. Then when I had just left AFSCME in the summer of ’84 he called me up again and asked me if I wanted to work as a speechwriter for Mondale on the campaign. I said yes, and that got me into Presidential politics.\n\nI imagine that, of the people you talk to, my background might be a little bit unusual because I never worked full time in a campaign for any office except President of the United States. Before working in the White House I had never worked in the government. That may have some bearing on how I related to things afterward, because essentially I had been an oppositionist. I had not been someone on the inside, I’d been someone on the outside saying that the people on the inside were doing things wrong.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you write for one Presidential candidate, when you write for Mondale, does that make it easier or harder to write for Dukakis four years later? Does that make it easier or harder after Clinton, in the sense of adapting to their style, the way they like to do things, and so on? In other words, you wrote for Mondale, the first candidate you’d ever written for.\n\nKusnet\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\nDid you form the impression of, Okay, this is what a speechwriter for a Presidential candidate does, and then when you wrote for Dukakis and so on you had to make some adjustments on the fly that maybe you didn’t anticipate having to make?\n\nKusnet\n\nThat’s a very good question. What you have to do as a speechwriter is reach a point where you can hear the voice of the person you’re writing for, and where that becomes a natural way of writing words to be spoken. The first person I wrote speeches for was someone who had a voice that was very familiar to me, the president of AFSCME until 1981, Jerry Wurf, who was from Brooklyn, a political radical, so it was like the voices I had heard growing up. That was not a difficult voice for me to get.\n\nOther voices I had to make a conscious effort to get. Mondale was a soft-spoken Midwesterner in person. In public, his voice was a soft-spoken person trying to be a loud-spoken person. To go with that small state/large state dichotomy we were talking about before, he had grown up in a relatively small state but a state that was dense with institutions. They had a union movement, they had a very well organized Democratic farmer labor party; the agricultural co-ops. So he was used to talking to large crowds of people who wanted to cheer.\n\nTo quote Eugene McCarthy again, he said that in Minnesota it gets so cold people have to clap just to keep warm. So Humphrey was a master at giving rousing speeches at rallies, and Mondale and McCarthy and others learned how to do it. Speaking to rallies was part of the Democratic Party culture in Minnesota.\n\nSo in a sense there were two Mondale voices. One was the rally speaker who just used the basic repertoire of rally speaking techniques, but it’s something I really learned as much working with him as before that. You use litany to say the same thing over and over again so people get in their rhythm and know when to clap. You end with almost any positive, upbeat statement that is more than likely to get applause than the cleverest negative line. I learned basic techniques of how you get people applauding. That was his voice for a rally.\n\nHis voice for a policy speech was more like what he really was, someone who was low- key, thoughtful, had a dry sense of humor, so it was a very different voice. Pretty much he had two voices. Dukakis had really only one voice. He would always speak in threes. Almost every sentence had three clauses of roughly equal length—America is running in place, losing ground, falling behind our rivals. It was like a metronome. After the campaign was over, I found that I was writing for everyone like they were Dukakis—a one, two, three metronome was so much in my head that I had to really make a conscious effort to get it out of my head.\n\nClinton was different. Not just because he was southern. During the 1980s, when I wrote for the chairman of the People for the American Way, John Buchanan, a former Congressman and Southern Baptist minister from Birmingham, Alabama, I got the rhythms of someone who spoke Southern and had been trained as a preacher.\n\nBut Clinton just had such a variety of rhythms, there’s no one rhythm to how he speaks. He will sound more southern with a southern audience than with a northern audience. He is a man of so many parts that he is very difficult to write for. There is not one voice that you can get in your head in the way that with many other public figures there’s one voice you can get in your head.\n\nOne thing I made a point of doing when I was in Little Rock, was to get the transcripts of anything he had said as Governor of Arkansas. I called up all kinds of people we never met in the campaign—his press secretary in the state government, his personal secretary in the state, the Governor’s mansion, the state house, just to get a folder of anything he had ever said or done that was on paper. There wasn’t a lot of it and they were very apologetic about giving me any of it because they didn’t think it was that good. One thing that I got was a transcript of I think literally hundreds of pages of interviews he had done with Bill Moyers for some purpose, I forget. Sometime between ’90 and when the campaign began.\n\nHere you have two people who came from the South. Moyers who—it’s not well known, but he’s an ordained minister. Clinton knows his Bible. So they’re speaking to each other as liberal southerners. I really got a sense of Clinton’s natural voice as much from reading those transcripts as from anything else.\n\nI pulled out a lot of ways he turns a phrase that he hadn’t used in public before, and started putting them in speech drafts. It gave me one aspect of his natural way of talking and thinking about things.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did you train yourself to hear Mondale’s voice and Dukakis’s?\n\nKusnet\n\nFor Mondale I traveled with him for almost three months before the election, so I heard everything he said.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you were asked to write for him off the bat.\n\nKusnet\n\nI’m enough of a political junkie that I would have followed someone who was Vice President, and I had seen him on TV. So I had some sense. I didn’t have a chance to bone up on him the way I did with Clinton. He was well known. Dukakis was less well known, but the same. Dukakis had a very easy voice to get. Maybe easier if you’re from the Northeast. It was easy to write in ways that he would recognize as his own.\n\nNelson\n\nWere you part of the Mondale campaign for the nomination?\n\nKusnet\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nOnly with the general.\n\nKusnet\n\nOnly the general.\n\nNelson\n\nHow did you connect with the Dukakis campaign?\n\nKusnet\n\nThrough the cohort who worked in Democratic Presidential campaigns at that time.\n\nRiley\n\nNo, no, we’re interested in both.\n\nKusnet\n\nThe fact is that a lot of the same people were involved in the Mondale campaign, which was one of the least successful campaigns in modern history; the Dukakis campaign, which was one of the worst run campaigns in modern history; and the Clinton campaign in ’92, which was one of the best run campaigns in American history. I think maybe there is a lesson there, not just for politics but for organizational management. It wasn’t the caliber of the people; the caliber of the people was no different in ’92 from ’88 or ’84. It was pretty much the same people; but the times were different, the candidate was different, and the ways of running the campaign were different.\n\nI had met both people who, at different times, managed Dukakis’ Presidential campaign during 1984. John Sasso ran Geraldine Ferraro’s Vice Presidential campaign, and Susan Estrich was an issues expert on the Mondale plane.\n\nI don’t know if you remember Rosie Ruiz?\n\nRiley\n\nSure, the marathoner.\n\nKusnet\n\nJust as she ran the beginning and the end of the New York marathon but didn’t run the middle of the race, I helped to write Dukakis’s announcement speech and worked on the last ten weeks of the campaign.\n\nNelson\n\nHow come?\n\nKusnet\n\nI guess I did not want to work that long in a campaign and I had no problem with Dukakis, but I wasn’t for him for the nomination. I knew Estrich and Sasso and Jack Corrigan and other people who were all for Dukakis and working for him. I thought Dukakis was perfectly okay. I wasn’t against him. But I liked a lot of what [Richard] Gephardt said—the economic populism. I didn’t do anything on behalf of him at that time. But I sort of found myself rooting for him. I didn’t want to work against someone who was saying what I believed in in favor of someone who wasn’t really saying what I believed in.\n\nNelson\n\nSo you’re at People for the American Way. I guess you take a leave of absence to work for the Dukakis campaign and then come back?\n\nKusnet\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nI think many people’s impression of People for the American Way was that its agenda was mostly about civil liberties. In other words, not the kind of thing that you thought in your book ought to be at the heart of a Democratic campaign. Did you see People for the American Way, for example, as exactly the kind of organization that Democratic candidates shouldn’t pay too much attention to if they were going to win elections even while you were working there?\n\nKusnet\n\nIt’s interesting that you see it that way. I think that’s how most people who were aware of it probably saw it, since it was an organization that had been founded by Norman Lear, the TV producer who was so oriented to communications. I was communications director. A large part of what we were about was yes, trying to advocate for Constitutional liberties and trying to oppose the religious right. But we also wanted to speak American. To do our advocacy work in a way that would make the positions that we had more mainstream than they had been.\n\nThe best-known civil liberties organization then and now is the American Civil Liberties Union, which—in part because its role is to represent unpopular issues and unpopular people in court—takes an absolutist position. I think the original purpose of People for the American Way, which was never stated because it could be misinterpreted if you ever stated it directly, was to advocate for some of the same general positions—civil liberties, Constitutional liberties, separation of church and state—but to do it in a way that could gain majority support and could change ideas about such things.\n\nThe people who played leading roles in it in the period I worked for it were not liberal absolutists. Tony Podesta was president of it at that time. He had been a prosecutor in the District of Columbia. He describes himself as being in some ways a product of Chicago machine politics. He had a 65th birthday party recently and people were looking for Google news, for Google photographs online, and we found a photograph of him when he must have been a teenager or something posing with the first Mayor [Richard M.] Daley. He was from the 39th ward in Chicago. He is a liberal—he was then—a liberal political activist, but he was not an absolutist.\n\nThe legislative director was Melanne Verveer, who later became chief of staff for Hillary Clinton. She had worked in the U.S. Catholic Conference. She is very religious herself. She wanted to find some ways to get religious people involved in defending and defining separation of church and state but not the separation of religion and society. Then, there was someone who died before his time. He was quite an influence on me and actually got me to write Speaking American, a man named Jim Castelli who had been in Catholic journalism. He worked for National Catholic Reporter, Our Sunday Visitor. He did a column on religious issues, among other things. He did a lot of writing about how you can mix religion and politics without destroying the wall between church and state.\n\nSo we tried to define a position that was civil libertarian but not absolutist and wouldn’t have to be unpopular. Just in preparing for this oral exam I reread parts of Clinton’s biography, My Life. I was reminded of something that I had known and then completely forgotten, which was after he lost the Governorship of Arkansas in the 1980s he was offered a few jobs, and one of them was being president of People for the American Way. Norman Lear had offered it to him. The idea was that they didn’t want to get some civil liberties lawyer from New York. They wanted to get somebody who came from a part of the country where religion was very salient. Even though he had lost in ’80, he was someone who could win an election in a state that had voted for George Wallace in 1968, a state where William Fulbright had been defeated.\n\nHe says of all the jobs that he was offered that he didn’t take, that was the one that he gave the most serious consideration to. So from the first the idea was that you could find some ways to speak American about civil liberties issues; it wasn’t to be absolutist.\n\nRiley\n\nMike, you have any more questions before we get to up to ’92?\n\nNelson\n\nWell, when you think of Dukakis and you think of Clinton, you think of Clinton’s nominating speech at the convention. What did you make of that at the time, and was that in your mind when you were originally thinking of working for Clinton?\n\nKusnet\n\nYes, that was before I worked for Dukakis. At least the political community knew that Clinton was a much greater talent than that speech revealed. It was sort of like saying Sandy Koufax in his first season in the major leagues was terrible. He had great power, but he couldn’t get the ball in the strike zone. People knew that Koufax was a great talent and he needed some seasoning. To carry that metaphor a little further, maybe to mangle it, it wasn’t that Clinton had no control. Maybe he was used to playing in a different ballpark or something.\n\nThat goes with the large audience/small audience theory. Clinton was someone who had been around politics since he was a teenager, a high school kid. He had run for office at that point I don’t know, five, six, seven times, won five out of seven, whatever, clearly a great talent. But he had managed to go that far without ever speaking to the national television audience in prime time.\n\nI don’t think he had ever been on national television before in prime time. I think he had spoken at the 1980 convention, but in the daytime and before C-SPAN [cable-satellite public affairs network]. So he had never spoken to a national television audience. He had probably never spoken to that many people. I guess the other dimension is time. He had rarely spoken in a situation where you can talk for only ten minutes, whatever amount of time a nominator is supposed to have at a Presidential convention.\n\nThe other thing with him, of course, is that it was a speech that was written for him, it was not a speech that he had written. He not only had never in his life before May of 1992 had someone who worked for him in government or in a campaign full-time who had the title and responsibility of being a speechwriter, he had probably never gotten up and read words to a crowd of people that someone else had written. He had only rarely gotten up in front of a crowd to read words that he had written. His natural manner of speaking is extemporizing.\n\nHe would speak at the Democratic Leadership Council. He would just write one page of notes for himself, maybe six talking points, get up, maybe not even look at it when he’s up at the podium, and give these elegantly crafted speeches. You would be sure there was a text, sentences that parse, paragraphs with a topic sentence and so on, paragraphs that flow from each other, and it was all in his head, it was not on paper. That’s his natural way of speaking.\n\nRunning for President of the United States and then being President of the United States, at some point you have to make the transition from functioning like that to dealing with text, because even if he doesn’t need a text to make a good speech, a President needs to have a text vetted. You need to make sure there’s nothing in the text that will cause a stock market crash or a war. You have to have people prepared to defend what you’re saying immediately after you’ve said it. So you need texts to be a President. But that was not his usual, his preferred, his natural way of speaking.\n\nNelson\n\nAll these thoughts you just shared with us were those thoughts you had even at the time you were watching that speech and even at the time you were thinking of writing for Clinton?\n\nKusnet\n\nI don’t think I watched Clinton’s nominating speech, but I did read about it the next day. I knew then that he was a great talent who had had a bad night.\n\nNelson\n\nOne more question about previous campaigns, and that is, were you involved in debate prep at all for Mondale or Dukakis?\n\nKusnet\n\nI was not with Mondale during the debate prep. The campaign had the speechwriters write responses to likely questions for drafts for the summations at the end of the debates, and I submitted them, but I was not physically in the room. I was with Dukakis during several of the debate prep sessions. I think the idea was a good idea, just to get me acquainted with him. I was there in the room and actually got something of a sense of what he was like beyond what I had read about him and beyond what he would say in speeches.\n\nSo some of the sense I got of him was so different from how he presented himself in public speeches that it was really of no value. If I had been working for him a year before—it would have been helpful to write his announcement speech. Two months away from Election Day there’s nothing really that you can do with what I think I learned about him.\n\nWhat I think I learned about him was that he had actually much more of the ethnic feeling as an outsider in America than he let on. The conventional wisdom about him was that he was a thoroughly assimilated American meritocrat who ran as an ethnic Greek because it gave him some identity. What I think I learned from hearing him talk to people and speak extemporaneously and then say, Oh, my God, I can’t say that, was that he really did feel something of an outsider in this country, beyond the world he knew in Massachusetts.\n\nThe other thing that I think I learned is that a formative experience for him had been being an American exchange student in Peru as a college kid. He had stayed with a family that was part of the social democratic party in Peru (the Apristas), which was being persecuted by the military government in Peru, which was being supported by the United States. He really identified not with the Sandinistas, but with the Latin Americans opposing North American meddling. He wasn’t about to pretend to be more hawkish about Nicaragua and El Salvador than his record showed. If anything he was even more dovish about those places than his record showed. So I think I learned those two things about him, and there’s nothing you can do with those two things in an election.\n\nRiley\n\nBut there was a sense with Dukakis that in the final stages of the campaign—the conventional wisdom—and maybe I’m wrong because I haven’t reflected on this for a while— was that he ran from the liberal label for very long and then towards the end of the campaign sort of embraced it and tried to put his own gloss on what it meant to be a liberal in American politics. Am I mistaken in recalling that?\n\nKusnet\n\nThere’s a story there, I’m actually part of it, and some of it is in public records.\n\nRiley\n\nTell us more.\n\nKusnet\n\nThe Boston Herald, around Labor Day of ’88, the Boston Globe two weeks before the election, and Sidney Blumenthal’s book about the 1988 campaign, Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War, all tell the story of my role in helping Dukakis find a more populist voice in his speeches. I had no prior relationship with Dukakis at all. I had some with Estrich and Sasso. Shortly after I joined the campaign, they had me write Labor Day week’s speeches for him. I included some economic populism—tougher than he had done before. Dukakis did not like it. I think actually it would have been the debate prep, but there was some setting where I met him for the first time with a bunch of staff around, sometime in September. I was introduced to him—in campaigns and in the White House you put your name or your initials on the speech draft so people know who wrote something.\n\nI think he was kind of tired and in a bad mood. He’s shorter than I am and he just started sticking his finger in my face and saying, Don’t write that kind of crap about country clubs or whatnot. It’s not me. I wasn’t mentioned by name, but the fact that Dukakis had lost his temper at some staffer who had written populist stuff got in the Boston Herald, which did not like Dukakis at all. Then you have that disastrous second debate, which is remembered for him giving a factual rather than an emotional answer to Bernie Shaw—he called him Bernard—asking him what he would do if his wife was raped and murdered. Anyone who knows Michael Dukakis knows he loves his wife and would strangle with his bare hands anyone who laid a finger on her, but he was acting like a President, not like a husband and human being, and said that.\n\nAfter that debate he’s 17 points behind. He gave this kind of speech that Democrats at that time would often give, when it’s two weeks out but no one knows who they are or what they stand for, so they’re going to reintroduce myself. He gave a speech at Faneuil Hall in Boston where he was going to redefine themselves. He gave it on a Sunday, and they had me write it in one day, on a Saturday, in the campaign headquarters.\n\nThis story shows that having a defined point of view—in my case, economic populism—can be an advantage for a campaign staffer. Here I had been yelled at by the Presidential nominee for having a defined point of view. Several weeks later, when the nominee is 17 points behind and needs to define himself, the people running the campaign remember that my defined point of view might not have been such a bad idea. They had me write this speech for Dukakis, the point of which was not to define him as a liberal but to define him as a populist. That’s the Faneuil Hall speech that the Globe wrote about and credited me with writing the speech.\n\nThe Faneuil Hall speech evolved into Dukakis’ stump speech for the last two weeks of the campaign, where the big point was, I’m on your side. The stump speech presented a series of conflicts between Dukakis and Bush, along the lines of, Bush wants to do this for rich people, I want to do that for regular people. I’m on your side. That became his stump speech for the last two weeks of the campaign. That was a kind of self-definition he had resisted very much back at the beginning of September. That was to define him as a populist and as a Democrat in some line that went back to [Harry] Truman and Roosevelt.\n\nAt some point, and this was not the doing of the staff, he sort of said, The hell with it, I’m going to define myself as a liberal too, which was not what the staff wanted him to do. I guess, come to think of it, it was the real self that I had heard at the debate prep, the guy who went to Peru, saw what it was like to live under a military dictatorship, saw that the United States is basically decent but isn’t always right, and that probably was a defining experience of his life. At some point I think the real Michael Dukakis who was a liberal Democrat came out. While the staff didn’t want it, he finished out the three days as much as a liberal as a populist. I don’t know if it made any difference. That’s what they call stepping on the message. But that’s who he was. He got to finish up, in some ways, the defining experience of his public life in terms that he would be proud of.\n\nRiley\n\nIn looking back, as part of the conversation between ’88 and ’92, was it your perception that the party’s problem was more a function of the messengers in ’84 and ’88, or was it the basic message itself that was flawed and had to be revisited for the Democrats to succeed?\n\nKusnet\n\nI think the latter. I mean just about everything. Nobody, including Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, would have said in 1990 that what we need to do is rerun the 1984 campaign or the 1988 campaign. The consensus of the conversation was that we had to say and do something different. In some ways the debates then foreshadow the debates now. In some ways they’re different. There was still a Soviet Union then, though it was on its last legs. No one knew what a blogger was going to be back then. You had different points of view. You had the Jesse Jackson point of view; it’s well known. I don’t have to repeat what it is. You had the just flat-out conservative Democrat point of view, maybe for shorthand Lloyd Bentsen, Sam Nunn. You had the DLC point of view. You had the economic populists. You had all kinds of people out there saying one thing or another. You had Paul Tsongas being a fiscal conservative and a social liberal.\n\nThe genius of Clinton was that he was able to encompass a whole bunch of those points of view. There were some things he clearly wasn’t. He wasn’t Jesse Jackson. He was southern but he was not an old-line southern conservative like Bentsen or Nunn. He wasn’t someone who would lead with social liberalism like Dukakis had. But he encompassed a whole bunch of viewpoints—he headed the DLC, but at least to someone like me he seemed to be more than the DLC. He could drop cultural signifiers that he was really an economic populist. He could drop cultural signifiers that he was, if not a fiscal conservative, someone who understood the needs of corporate America and would not be hostile to them. He could drop all kinds of signifiers to all kinds of audiences that he really was one of them, without offending other elements of the Democratic coalition.\n\nHis campaign was sort of—I wouldn’t say unwieldy, because it worked very well, but rather wieldy if there is such a word—a wieldy coalition of the DLC and the economic populists. If you’d asked us in 1990 and 1991 what we were, James Carville, Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, Frank Greer, David Wilhelm, and I would have said that we were economic populists. With economic populists at that time, whatever your views on social issues would be—and I think all the people I mentioned were social liberals—you couldn’t really say that you were an absolutist social liberal because that would overshadow the economic populism.\n\nSo even though there were tensions, there was some commonality between the economic populists and the DLC people then. With sides, there were elements of a communitarian philosophy. If you’re an economic populist, it is more than just bashing irresponsible people in positions of power and privilege. It was more than just wanting a whole bunch of economic benefits for people who needed some help. You have to have some idea of some common communities and common society that is going to hold people on top to some standard of responsibility and is going to offer some kind of help for people in need. Because otherwise how can you do it? How can you ask some big company to be responsible to the community if there is no idea of community? If there’s no community, how can you say that we owe it to people to help them?\n\nThe economic populists may not have been systematic social thinkers, but we had some idea that you had to have some kind of American community or else you can’t do the other things we wanted to do. That’s a big part of what the DLC was about or united itself around.\n\nRiley\n\nThat was going to be my next question.\n\nKusnet\n\nYou could get someone like me or Carville, Begala, Greenberg in a room with somebody from the DLC like Al From or Will Marshall or Bill Galston and we wouldn’t agree on economic issues, but we’d have some common instructs on other issues.\n\nRiley\n\nSure, but your union background was not something that was very typical of the people who were hardcore DLCers. I guess one of the questions that I had coming into our session was how do you get from the background that you had into a network of people, many of whom seem to be setting themselves up in opposition to the kind of Democratic Party, labor-based background that you had experienced? Was it just the fact that you had lost two national elections?\n\nKusnet\n\nThat was part of it. In 1972, we learned that, if the Democratic coalition was divided, with labor and the liberals at each other’s throats, we would get clobbered.\n\nWhat the Mondale campaign showed was that if all those groups in the Democratic coalition, including labor, liberals, minorities and women’s rights advocates, were in the same tent, we could still get clobbered. Most of the organizational divisions in the Democratic Party had been healed by ’84. Mondale was the master at assembling a Democratic coalition of all the groups, but you could still get us all under the same banner and we’d do about one or two points better than [George] McGovern had done with all of us being fragmented.\n\nRiley\n\nThe base isn’t big enough.\n\nKusnet\n\nExactly. So almost anybody who wanted to win reached two conclusions: First, we had to all pull together, but that wasn’t enough. So, second, we had to reach out beyond our base and do things differently from in the past. You could have all kinds of arguments about what would be enough, but the basic premise was that we’d get clobbered if we were at odds with each other, but we could all be in harness together and if no one else was with us, we’d still get beat. So in ’84 or ’88 or ’68 or ’72, the forerunners to the people who were mentors or forerunners to the people who were working together in ’92 probably would not have gotten along at all. In ’92 we didn’t agree with each other on everything, but we realized both that we had to get along and that we had to do some things differently from in the past.\n\nRiley\n\nGot you.\n\nKusnet\n\nClinton was more than an economic populist. But he was also more than just a DLCer. He was a student of history from a working-class background. He had some understanding of unions. This was something we knew at AFSCME many years before Clinton ran for President. We must have had a thousand members or fewer in Arkansas.\n\nAs Attorney General of the state of Arkansas, Clinton made a point of joining AFSCME because he was a state employee. If there had really been collective bargaining he couldn’t have because he would have been a manager, but there wasn’t. Anyone could join. So he joined. He always understood that was part of the Democratic Party. He dropped all kinds of cultural signifiers to union people to suggest that he was one of them. He understood that. I had left AFSCME by then, but AFSCME endorsed him early on for the nomination against people like [Thomas] Harkin and others who maybe had a better record. My wife worked for the American Federation of Teachers for many years, and she remembered that Bill and Hillary Clinton worked with the AFT’s national president, Albert Shanker, to develop an education reform plan in Arkansas that was not punitive towards the teachers. Clinton through education reform became very close with Albert Shanker. That union also endorsed him very early. His support for trade was a barrier with the industrial unions, but he had some support among other unions from the start.\n\nNelson\n\nSounds like your background and the union presence in Arkansas that he related to were public employee unions rather than industrial or trade unions.\n\nKusnet\n\nThat’s right.\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s the rising sector in the union movement.\n\nKusnet\n\nThis is a rather arcane point, but when I worked for Clinton I remember having people in the unions being critical of him and I was trying to explain him. I remember when I worked for AFSCME there was an older generation of public officials who understood private sector unions but not public sector unions. Clinton was the mirror image: He understood public sector unions better than private sector unions.\n\nNelson\n\nI think we’re ready to move to ’92.\n\nRiley\n\nI think so. I think we’ll go on about another five minutes and then take a break. Go ahead, Mike.\n\nNelson\n\nFirst of all, you leave People for the American Way in 1990, is that right?\n\nKusnet\n\nI think so.\n\nNelson\n\nAnd then what do you—?\n\nKusnet\n\nIt was sort of a loose place. You could come and go. You could leave to work on a campaign and you could come back or you could become a consultant. You could do work for them and get paid for it under different terms.\n\nNelson\n\nOne thing I’m not clear on is where were you living all this time?\n\nKusnet\n\nIn D.C.\n\nNelson\n\nThen what are you doing between, say, 1990 and when you are approached about the Clinton campaign?\n\nKusnet\n\nI wrote the book Speaking American. I did consulting work for People for the American Way, some for AFSCME. I wrote Jerry McEntee’s [AFSCME President] convention speech in 1990 at the convention. Some for the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, some for American Association of University Women, and various other clients.\n\nNelson\n\nYou’re one of the rare freelance writers then who were able to make a living.\n\nKusnet\n\nI did it by ghostwriting. I got more money for writing all kinds of things that I have completely forgotten than I got for writing Speaking American.\n\nNelson\n\nAs the ’92 nomination campaign approached, were you looking actively to get involved in a campaign?\n\nKusnet\n\nNo. I think in addition to just trying to make a living and pay the bills and gratify whatever ambitions I had to see my name in print and so on, I think I was probably more positioning myself to be a commentator on the ’92 election. I figured if you had worked for—two strikes and you’re out. I didn’t think Speaking American would be a job application.\n\nNelson\n\nIt wasn’t a job application.\n\nKusnet\n\nIt wasn’t a job application. It turned out to be one, but it wasn’t intended to be one. It was more like a job application to go on CNN and comment on things or something.\n\nNelson\n\nSo how does it happen? How do you end up with the Clinton campaign?\n\nKusnet\n\nI think you have to go back to that idea of the cohort of people who worked not only in the Mondale and Dukakis campaigns, but also for organizations like AFSCME and People for the American Way.\n\nIn May of ’92 Melanne Verveer, who I think was still at People for the American Way then, asked me if I would write a speech for Hillary Clinton, who was giving two commencement speeches that year. One was at Wellesley, where she was a graduate. The other one was at Hendrix College, a Methodist women’s college in Arkansas. She’s a serious Methodist.\n\nMelanne told me that the speech for Hendrix College would be a first draft for her Wellesley speech, as it was, and it would also be a document that would then inform the Clinton campaign’s approach to religion and politics. I went to work on the Methodist women’s speech and learned that Methodism had begun as a movement of working-class social reform in Britain in the 1700s founded by John Wesley and espousing an earlier version of communitarianism.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned religion a couple of times. Your own religious background?\n\nKusnet\n\nI’m Jewish, a secular Jewish liberal. But partly through an interest in such things, and partly because I had worked at AFSCME and for civil rights organizations, I had written a lot of speeches for African-American churches—they were always supporters of AFSCME, especially in the historic Memphis strike—so I know more than you might expect about Baptist rhetoric. Working in the labor movement I became familiar with Catholic social teaching.\n\nA labor lawyer in Chicago, Tom Geoghegan, has the great line that every segment of American life has some representation in the labor movement, but there are disproportionate numbers of Irish Catholics, like Geoghegan, and of Jews because those two groups have the most highly developed guilt complexes and they are therefore drawn into it. Anyhow, I immersed myself for about a week in Methodism. Then, before I had turned in the speech, I get a call from George Stephanopoulos. That was before email. As a freelance writer I had an answering machine. I get a message from George Stephanopoulos, who I knew was working for Clinton but I had not been in touch with him. I knew him from the Dukakis campaign.\n\nPutting two and two together and getting five, assuming a greater degree of coordination in the Clinton operation than existed then or ever, I assumed that since he was working full-time for Clinton, and Melanne was just a friend of Hillary’s, that he was calling to dun me about the Hillary speech. I hadn’t done it yet and he was calling to dun me about it. I’m feeling awkward and guilty that I haven’t turned in my speech yet, and he doesn’t know what the hell I’m talking about.\n\nIt developed that he wasn’t calling about the Hillary speech. Instead, he asked me if I wanted to be chief speechwriter in the Clinton campaign. I had not known this, but Speaking American had made its way around the campaign and Clinton had read it, and they saw me as something more than someone who had worked the two losing campaigns. Even though it sounded like I’d been offered the job, I was going to go through a tryout. I don’t think, at least at that moment, anyone else was going through the same tryout.\n\nEarly in June, 1992, the campaign had me travel with him for a week when, among other events, he clinched the nomination by winning the California primary and spoke at the AARP [American Association of Retired Persons] at San Antonio. I wrote both speeches. I worked with Clinton on the speech he gave in Los Angeles after winning the primary and the nomination—in effect, that was my job interview with Clinton himself—and I was interviewed by the campaign consultants, James Carville, Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg and Mandy Grunwald.\n\nNelson\n\nThese interviews—what did they want to find out about you?\n\nRiley\n\nMike, can I interject—\n\nNelson\n\nDo you want to take a break right now?\n\nKusnet\n\nIf you want to keep going, I can keep going.\n\nRiley\n\nIf you’re fine, go ahead.\n\nKusnet\n\nCarville and Begala interviewed me in Los Angeles on primary day. I think the closest to a formal interview was with Grunwald in Washington. Stan Greenberg also interviewed me in Washington.\n\nNelson\n\nBut you knew him.\n\nKusnet\n\nI knew him [Greenberg].\n\nClinton was different from the other Presidential nominees I had worked for. I had met Mondale and Dukakis and they were both somewhat forbidding figures. The first time I met them, they were wearing suits. Of course, they were much older than me. Clinton, the first time I met him I think he was wearing blue jeans, a tee shirt, running shoes, and very informal in manner. He would spend the most attention on whoever was new. He just had a very good way with people, can treat you like his best friend in the world when he’s first met you. Everything about him, the body language. He just beckons. Everything about him is just to draw you in.\n\nThere is a funny, an arcane reference, but I remember reading something that Norman Mailer wrote about when he met President [John F.] Kennedy. Kennedy told Mailer that he had read Barbary Shore and his other books. Barbary Shore was a novel that Mailer wrote that he was very proud of but never got anywhere. It was not well reviewed, didn’t sell any copies. Everyone knew Mailer from The Naked and the Dead. Mailer wrote that he had assumed that because The Naked and the Dead was what everyone associated him with—it was about the war in the Pacific and Kennedy had served in the war in the Pacific—he was certain that Kennedy would pretend to have read and loved The Naked and the Dead. Instead Kennedy engages him in a conversation about Barbary Shore.\n\nMailer writes that he just fell in love with Kennedy then, because here Kennedy liked his favorite book and Kennedy clearly had actually read something that he wrote. But Mailer has enough self-knowledge to write that politicians should understand that if they ever meet an author, compliment them on something obscure, because that’s what will really flatter them.\n\nI’d only written one book at that time, so Clinton couldn’t comment on another book, but he engaged me in some obscure part of Speaking American. It wasn’t the main point, but it was about unions. So he understood that that mattered to me and also that that would prove to me that he had really read it, he hadn’t just read the first few pages—he started discussing with me something in the middle of the book. So that won me over. I could tell he had really read my book.\n\nThe other thing I learned about how he treated people then—what I ended up writing for him for the California primary wasn’t right. It was more like an I won the Democratic nomination speech rather than an I’m running for President speech. It was written more for Democrats with whom he had already prevailed than for the general public with whom he had not yet prevailed. But for all the talk about him having a temper, which he has, or being difficult, which he can be, his natural way of dealing with speechwriters is to ask you to join with him in critiquing your own work. As a speechwriter, it is very common that if someone is making major changes in what you’re doing, will blame you—as they have every right to do—for what you’ve done. That makes you defensive, and so on.\n\nUnless he’s in an unusually bad mood, Clinton will ask you to be co-editor with him of your own work and it becomes detached from you. That’s a very good way to deal with speechwriters, because there’s no defensiveness. Then you can just join him in revising what you’ve written. You’re not bleeding with every word because you’re the surgeon, you’re not the patient. He did that with me that evening. So my initial judgment, which isn’t all that different from my judgment now, is a very favorable one.\n\nEveryone already knew he had an enormous grasp of policy. Everyone already knew he was a very skillful politician, but also not just that he had people skills, but that at some level he cared about people and knew how to bring out the best in people.\n\nRiley\n\nAll right. Let’s break here because we have only a little over an hour before we’re going to break for lunch. We’ll take a five-minute break.\n\nRiley\n\nHe’s taking pictures for internal purposes, if you don’t mind. Mike, you want to continue with that?\n\nNelson\n\nHad Clinton ever had a speechwriter?\n\nKusnet\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nSo he’d gotten through May of ’92, essentially winning the nomination without a speechwriter.\n\nKusnet\n\nThat’s right.\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s extraordinary.\n\nKusnet\n\nI tried to find out, but really couldn’t find out, what his practice had been as Governor of Arkansas. Clearly there were prepared texts. Not so many speeches, but the State of the State speeches.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nKusnet\n\nNo one ever came forward, not just to me but in anything I’ve ever read about Clinton, and said they had been a speechwriter for him or even had dabbled in writing speeches when he was Governor. In the campaign I was the first person he ever hired, in any of the public offices that he held, with the title of speechwriter. That was at the end of May of ’92.\n\nIn the campaign there were people who worked with him on speeches—Bruce Reed, Paul Begala, probably others, but those two in particular. Reed was the policy advisor; Begala with Carville was the political strategist. So that [speechwriting] wasn’t their primary role. Someone from the Dukakis campaign had written the nominating speech that Clinton got up and read. That was the first and probably the last time he had gotten up and read words that someone else wrote for him. It wasn’t his style even to write words for himself on paper. He’d just write notes for himself. In terms of my relationship with him, which on a personal level was always a good one, the fact that I got started when things were proceeding at breakneck speed rather than at some leisurely moment at the beginning of the campaign meant that he never really figured out what to do with the job title of speechwriter.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have specific requirements or questions as you went into this? Or you just thought, This guy is going to be the nominee, I’ve got to do it.\n\nKusnet\n\nI hadn’t done anything for the campaign other than the college commencement speech for Hillary Clinton, but I was rooting for him to get nominated. Except for Clinton, none of the top-tier Democrats ran. Clinton, when he announced, was not perceived as a top-tier Democrat. He was perceived as one more of a field of second-ranked people who were running.\n\nRiley\n\nNot that it mattered, because nobody was going to beat George Bush anyway.\n\nKusnet\n\nRight. And none of the people who were seen by the media as real heavyweights—Cuomo, Bradley, Gephardt, Gore, Bentsen, Nunn—decided to run that year. In addition to Clinton, the candidates who the media took at all seriously were Bob Kerrey, Tom Harkin, and Doug Wilder. Wilder withdrew before the primaries began, and Harkin and Kerrey lost the early primaries and withdrew. That left Clinton against two candidates who were seen as has-beens, and eccentric, marginal figures—Paul Tsongas and Jerry Brown.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nKusnet\n\nThen at the time that I joined the campaign, Bush was still running first and Ross Perot was running ahead of Clinton. My exposure to the campaign before joining the Clinton campaign had been sort of vicarious. With Speaking American I did sort of the poor man’s book tour, which was I went on any radio show that would have me on. Very few of the talk show hosts gave any indication that they had read a word of the book. Here’s some guy who admits he worked for Mondale and Dukakis who wrote a book and we’ve got to have someone on the show so here he is. So I was sort of like a generic Democrat being yelled at by angry people. I just got exposed to all the anger that was out there.\n\nFortunately this was from the safety of my home, these people weren’t in the same room with me and they couldn’t see me and I couldn’t see them, but I got exposed to all of these angry voices at the other end of the phone line from about February through May of 1992. Most of them were right-wingers who weren’t crazy about Bush but hated Clinton even more, or hated Democrats even more. Some of them were Perot people, some of them Democrats who didn’t like Clinton. I don’t think I ever got a single caller who thought Clinton was great. As a Democrat, I found myself defending and even representing Clinton, who I had never met and had no relationship with. It was very tough.\n\nTwo voices stick in my mind. The first was a very conservative, very erudite talk-show host in Baltimore who told me he had read Speaking American—this was not on the air, I think it was at like some pre-interview, and he said, I know what it really is. I said, Tell me what it really is. He said, It’s really a blueprint for how you can present socialism to the American people without revealing what you are all about. The interview wasn’t that terribly different from that. He was a very erudite guy.\n\nNelson\n\nAlan somebody?\n\nKusnet\n\nDon’t know. The other voice that sticks in my mind, on some show there was a Democrat who was very angry. I remember, Clinton—and I’m not proud of him for this—went back to Arkansas to execute a man who was mentally disabled.\n\nNelson\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\n[Ricky Ray] Rector.\n\nKusnet\n\nShe asked me, something like, I’m a Democrat. I know that Clinton is going to get nominated. I want to be for him. Give me some reason why I should be for him. I tried to give some reasons and wasn’t terribly convincing. She said, I’m sorry, but the only things I know about him are he dodged the draft, he slept with some cocktail waitress, and he electrocuted somebody. I’m not saying these people were a focus group. Clinton was winning a lot of primaries, but he wasn’t held in terribly high esteem.\n\nWhen I joined the Clinton campaign, I learned they had been trying to give the voters a better idea of who Clinton was. I remember Mandy Grunwald told me about when she interviewed me that they were conducting something she called the Manhattan Project. They asked focus groups about what they thought Clinton was. For all his skill at cultural signifiers, people who didn’t know that much about him assumed he was a rich kid whose family were big shots in Arkansas and who had bought his way into the Governorship or inherited it or something. They put together Yale, Georgetown, Oxford—\n\nNelson\n\nHillary.\n\nKusnet\n\n—not serving in the draft, wife with a different name, and his seeming ease in public settings to think that he was something very different from what he really was. People assumed he had grown up in very different circumstances from how he had actually grown up—the son of a single mother who worked as a nurse anesthetist.\n\nNelson\n\nDo you have a sense of why in May of ’92 they need a speechwriter?\n\nKusnet\n\nI think that Clinton could have gone through most of the campaign without a speechwriter, just as he had done before with Bruce Reed feeding him policy, Paul Begala feeding him good lines. They could have had one or two more hangers-on giving him lines or something. But, once a candidate has won a Presidential nomination, you need written texts. For one thing you get into situations like the convention speech where how long you speak matters. It’s okay to speak for 45 minutes; but if you speak for an hour and a half, especially with his previous experience at the Democratic convention in 1988, you become a laughing stock. You also need to have a prepared text because you need to have something to vet with people. You need to have something fact-checked and policy-checked by the campaign’s policy experts. You need to have something to show interest groups and interested groups beforehand so that they’ll be onboard or at least not be blindsided. You need to have something to give reporters before they cover you. So you need texts.\n\nWith Clinton, you’re not a speechwriter as much as you’re a text writer. You do the document that gets him thinking and that can be vetted inside and outside the campaign and so on. So you needed someone to write a prepared text. I’m not sure they saw it explicitly that way. When they hired me they didn’t tell me that’s what we need you for, but I think they understood it intuitively and they were right. You need someone like that.\n\nRiley\n\nThere was no screw-up or gaff at any point leading up to this where they felt like, Oh, we’ve stumbled.\n\nKusnet\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd in the course of your discussions, was the acceptance address explicitly mentioned? Or was it still uncertain enough about the nomination that they didn’t want to—\n\nKusnet\n\nThey were staffing up. They knew he was going to be nominated. That was clear, he was going to be nominated.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that explicitly talked about?\n\nKusnet\n\nNo, but it was understood that that would be the first major thing.\n\nRiley\n\nDid they want you to go to Arkansas?\n\nKusnet\n\nYes, you had to move to Arkansas. I was on the plane some of the time, not most of the time. They did not—this is more for campaign history than for Presidential history.\n\nRiley\n\nBut that’s a part of what we’re doing.\n\nKusnet\n\nMaybe because he had been Vice President and was familiar with Air Force Two [the Vice President’s plane], the Mondale plane was actually much more highly staffed than Dukakis or Clinton. Mondale pretty much had recreated Air Force Two. The senior staff and even people like me who weren’t but had some function to play were on the plane. It was a big plane, physically a big plane, and within the limits of the technology that existed in 1984 it was very high-tech. Gary Hart may have had the image of being high-tech, but the Mondale campaign was very high-tech. You had then what were advanced computers for the speechwriters. You had an early primitive form of email, which was not widely used then. There was a capacity when the plane landed to send documents electronically to and from headquarters and to and from some other places. The equipment was high-quality. It did not break down.\n\nWith Dukakis the plane became a joke; it was called Sky Pig. It was not large. It was, I think, not just relative to its times, but in absolute terms, less technically advanced than the Mondale plane. I’m not sure they had the capacity to send documents electronically from one place to another. I think we had faxes and all kinds of real primitive stuff. The laptops were horrendously bad. I remember being in a car or a van and having to write something and the sunlight on the screen made it impossible to read what was on the screen of the laptop. Then you couldn’t plug it into anything, and the battery died. The equipment was just horrendously bad.\n\nThe Clinton plane—certainly before he got nominated, then you get all the federal money, but even afterwards—was better than the Dukakis plane, but it wasn’t unusually well- staffed, well-stocked, or whatever. Clinton had a circle of advisors who were on the plane with him, but the headquarters was well staffed. This is sort of a metaphor for the cohort. The same day that I started full-time in Little Rock, Gene Sperling started and Nancy Soderberg, foreign policy advisor, started. People like that were in the headquarters, not for the most part on the plane. I went on the plane on some trips, but most of the time I was in the headquarters.\n\nThey did have email. They didn’t call it email, but you could send files electronically from the headquarters to the plane. The plane, if I remember right, was Clinton and very senior generalists, Carville or Begala. People would sort of filter the documents through them, but it wasn’t the people who produced the stuff.\n\nRiley\n\nThat was not a problem for you to move to Little Rock?\n\nKusnet\n\nSort of. I had just gotten married. I had just written a book. This is a monstrous way to start a marriage. First you write a book, then you go on a campaign. My wife’s pretty close to 100 percent Clinton supporter, then and now. She really urged me to do it. I think she understood that that was like—certainly if we won it would be a defining experience of a lifetime.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nNelson\n\nDid Clinton have any trouble adjusting to having a speechwriter?\n\nKusnet\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nCould you talk about that?\n\nKusnet\n\nTwo points come to mind: First, he is such a gifted speaker and such a gifted composer of speeches, not so much on paper but in his own mind, that he must have wondered, with good reason, why he needed a speechwriter. Second, his ways of talking, his background, and his frame of references are so wide-ranging, that no one could capture all his voices. He is just such an eclectic personality. He is a Southern Baptist, who grew up, first in a small town (Hope, Arkansas) and then in a free-wheeling city (Hot Springs, Arkansas). He went to a leading Catholic University (Georgetown University); he studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar; and he went to Yale Law School. He worked on campaigns in Arkansas, in Connecticut, and in Texas, and then he went home to run for office in Arkansas. He supported the civil rights movement, was active in the antiwar movement, and then became a leader of centrist Democrats, while retaining his links to the liberal community. It is hard for a speechwriter to capture one of his voices and almost impossible to capture all of his voices.\n\nHe is a man of parts, and he has always been drawn to outsiders. You meet Bill Clinton’s friends from when he’s growing up, you meet a Greek-American, you meet a Jew. He goes to Yale Law School and he sits at the table with the African-Americans.\n\nHe goes on the boat to Britain to become a Rhodes Scholar, he brings Bob Reich chicken soup in Reich’s cabin—just such a tendency on Clinton’s part to reach out to the outsider. Someone from his background wouldn’t have his life experience either. As is true with President Obama, God only made one Bill Clinton, he only made one Barack Obama.\n\nSo there’s really no one individual who could be an alter ego for him. It’s interesting to the extent that post-Presidentially he picks someone to be his amanuensis, his Sorensen. It’s Taylor Branch, another liberal white southerner of literary bent and historic knowledge and religious interests. It’s not someone who ever worked for him in a campaign (well, yes, Branch did work with Clinton in the McGovern campaign in Texas in 1972) or in the White House.\n\nNelson\n\nI guess my question was more about just the nuts and bolts. You’re used to writing for Presidential candidates; he’s a Presidential candidate but he’s not used to working with a speechwriter.\n\nKusnet\n\nBut I knew it would be different. I knew it would be different and difficult. I didn’t know the details of how it would be different and difficult. I knew it would be different.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you recount some of the details? We’ll want to get to the acceptance address as the big thing that is on the horizon, but are there some memorable speeches that you did between the California address and the acceptance speech that helped—\n\nKusnet\n\nThe three major campaign speeches that I worked on were the acceptance speech at the convention, the speech at the Detroit Economic Club (August 21, 1992), which set forth his economic policy, and the speech at Notre Dame University (September 11, 1992), which addressed religious and social issues. I was the writer on that. That was meant to be an outreach to the Catholic community and a general statement on religious and social issues. We were talking about President Kennedy during the break—speaking at Notre Dame had a special appeal to President Clinton because it was a kind of historic mirror image of when President Kennedy spoke to the Baptist ministers in Texas about church-state issues. That was a major hurdle for John Kennedy in the 1960 campaign.\n\nBill Clinton was a Southern Baptist speaking to a leading Catholic university in ’92, and that was a hurdle for him. Also, and this is unusual for a Southern Baptist from Arkansas, he was a graduate of another great Catholic university—Georgetown. It was a major speech in his mind, in the campaign’s mind, and through circumstances it became a major speech in the campaign.\n\nAbout that same time in August of ’92 he gave a speech at the Detroit Economic Club that was a major statement on economic issues, and then—it’s in your briefing book—he had a NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) speech; since I was opposed to NAFTA, it turned out just as well for me personally that I had not a major role in it. But those were all speeches with texts where he got up and read something resembling the texts that had been prepared for him. Other than foreign policy speeches, I don’t think there were any other speeches in that period where he actually read the words that were on paper.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me come back to the preliminary period, since there aren’t any memorable speeches, and just ask you one question, and then we can probably move on to the acceptance address where there must have been some preparation. Can you paint us a picture of what you find when you get to Little Rock? I mean there’s such an allure that circulates around the war room there. You’ve had significant experiences in two previous Presidential campaigns. Does this look like an odd duck to you? Is it a well-oiled machine? What’s the picture of the campaign organization?\n\nKusnet\n\nAgain, hindsight is always 20/20. You have to filter out how it looks to me now and how it looked to me then. As a freelancer, I had written several articles about labor-management cooperation. While I hadn’t visited the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee. I had done a lot of research about it and visited and written articles about auto plants and steel mills in Ohio, with similar experiments in labor-management cooperation. I think the Clinton campaign headquarters in Little Rock—and especially the war room—was the Saturn Project of political campaigns. The notion with Saturn was General Motors wasn’t doing that well, so we’ll set up this plant in Tennessee and we’ll do things differently, more egalitarian, but also in a more results-oriented way than General Motors had done it before.\n\nWhat’s sort of forgotten about Saturn is that Saturn moved to Springhill, Tennessee, but most of the workers at Springhill, Tennessee, were the workers from somewhere else. There were so many unemployed people you could get UAW members from Michigan and Ohio and Indiana to move to Tennessee and work for Saturn. This was sort of the Saturn project of political campaigns. You had veteran Democrats, people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, but people who had been in campaigns before. We moved to Little Rock and we worked together in a more collaborative fashion than we had done in previous efforts.\n\nAt that time Saturn was arranging all kinds of tours for all kinds of people from outside the auto industry to come and see how Saturn ran. It was a big thing in the education world that teachers and principals and union leaders and education policy thinkers would make the pilgrimage to Springhill, Tennessee, and see how the Saturn plant ran. I know Albert Shanker went there quite a few times. I don’t know if Bill Clinton had ever been on a pilgrimage to Saturn, but you had this building, one of the two newspapers in Little Rock. Only one survived. The one that didn’t survive left its building behind and we were in that building. So if you worked there, things that were still there looked familiar to me from a newspaper building. You had the newsroom; you had the pressroom. You had the place for the phone solicitors where the solicitors received classified ads. It was identifiable to me as an old- fashioned newspaper building.\n\nIt was staffed up. It was just filled to the brim with people. Some of them were this Democratic Party cohort that I knew. Others were people from Arkansas. Others were people who were new, and this was their first campaign. I guess my frame of reference was the Mondale campaign and the Dukakis campaign. Mondale’s headquarters probably in hindsight should have been in Minnesota, but it was in Washington, D.C. Dukakis’s headquarters was in Boston. The Mondale campaign, there was a sort of a method in its madness. The real campaign was on the plane and the Washington headquarters was for everybody who wanted to say they had a piece of the action but they weren’t going to get listened to.\n\nDukakis was more like Clinton. He had a narrow group of people who traveled with him regularly on the plane, but all kinds of people who had a role in the campaign were in the building in Boston. The Clinton campaign resembled the Dukakis campaign in that most of the senior people were actually in the headquarters. The difference was that the Dukakis campaign was very hierarchical. Estrich and Sasso and the senior people were on the ninth floor. The speechwriters were literally in the basement. We had the Xerox machines and the people selling trinkets. You had one floor for everything. You had senior staff meetings; it was very hierarchical.\n\nThe Clinton campaign was consciously not hierarchical. What is remembered about the war room is the war metaphor and the quick response. But the other thing about it was that it was, I think, intended to be egalitarian and information sharing. That was the original point of it, that you would have one person from every function there. It was like Michael Bloomberg’s bullpen in City Hall in New York City. There were no walls. You could hear what everyone was saying and doing. It was the high-status place to be. That’s where Carville was, that’s where Stephanopoulos was.\n\nYou would have a meeting there every morning, I forget when, but relatively early in the morning, and then every evening. Everyone and anyone could go to the meeting and was encouraged to do so. I don’t think there were any offices with doors, never a closed-door meeting at the headquarters, although there were private meetings at the Governor’s mansion and other places away from the headquarters. Everything was about equally ramshackle and it was just sort of the premise that you’re being trusted with stuff. Of course, the really important stuff you weren’t trusted with. But still, there was much more sharing of information than there was in the Mondale and Dukakis campaigns. And, because we were in the South in the summer, no one wore a tie. Carville wore blue jeans and tee shirts and whatnot. You see the movie of the war room, no one is wearing a tie. There’s nothing corporate about the place.\n\nSo it was a friendly, happy place, which I would not have said of the Dukakis or Mondale headquarters. It wasn’t in Washington. Unlike Boston, it wasn’t just one plane ride from Washington. So you really could not get big shots from outside the campaign coming in and telling you you were a jerk or something. To get out there, you had to make a major effort. At that time at least you had to take a connecting flight. If you were going to go out there you had to say, I’m going to spend two days going to Little Rock to talk to people.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about the acceptance address? How early do you start working on it, and is this a corporate effort? Are you given marching orders from Clinton or from somebody else about how to go about doing this?\n\nKusnet\n\nI remember reading about Michael Gerson getting a month from George Bush to write the acceptance speech. I don’t think Clinton took a month to write his 900-page memoir. Clinton’s way, at least at that time, of putting someone out to pasture was to give them something to do in the long term.\n\nI think something like two or three weeks at most before the convention we had a meeting in the Governor’s mansion in Little Rock, my recollection is a lot of Clinton meetings were sort of a floating thing. People came in, people came out. He dressed informally. Half of it is just banter. But obviously Bill Clinton is there, Hillary Clinton is there part of the time, Paul Begala, me, Carville may be drifting in and out. I think that might have been it, but for all I know I may be leaving out someone who played a major role and made a major contribution or something.\n\nHe [Clinton] starts talking about the acceptance speech. A lot of it is sort of banter about we have to have some joke about his nominating speech of Dukakis. We went through all kinds of jokes. It wasn’t my finest hour; it wasn’t even my finest hour and a half. The real reason I ran was so I could get to finish that speech I was giving four years ago. Just all kinds. I would do anything to audition for the Johnny Carson show. It was every possible joke you could tell about his nominating speech.\n\nThen he went through what he liked about his stump speech, what he had to do differently, but it was structured—he didn’t say, I want to lead with this. I think there is always this element of productive disorganization. I think it was sort of understood that he would be thinking about it on his own. Hillary would probably be thinking about it on her own and with him. Begala if he had the time might draft something and I would draft something, but the fate of the campaign did not depend on every word in our early drafts. I remember taking a flight home and writing a first draft for the speech in longhand on a legal pad. I write at a keyboard, not longhand, but I didn’t have a laptop, so I had to write in longhand.\n\nIn the briefing book, rereading the speech—and the same thing happened with the inaugural—there was one thing from my absolute first draft that made it in. With the inaugural it was the most quoted line [the most quoted line in the inaugural address was in my first draft], with this it wasn’t, but I think it had something to do with the organizing principle of the speech. Part of the strategic doctrine of the Clinton campaign at that time was that he was saying things that people agreed with, but the people didn’t trust him both because of the character issues that had been raised against him and the widespread but inaccurate view that he came from a privileged background and hadn’t been tested by tough times. There were some basic doubts about him as a person that he had to overcome. It wasn’t so much the personal life at that time, but this misconception of him, that he was young, callow, untested and overprivileged and that the perceived slickness followed from that and that you had to do something to get people to see him differently so that they would listen to him.\n\nA lot of what was done then, The Man from Hope video at the convention, the biographical stuff, was to overcome that. I was thinking on the plane, and then put it in longhand, how we could do that in the acceptance speech. I’ve always had the idea that a speech like that has to have an emotional rhythm to it. The structure is similar to a lot of sermons, where you start out on something of a high note, then you bring people down, and then you bring them up to a higher level than they started out on. There is something emotionally and perhaps spiritually cleansing and uplifting about the process of bringing people down from a kind of false happiness to understand the grim realities, to bring them up to a higher level.\n\nI was thinking, How could Clinton do that? What I thought of as the structure of the speech would be built on an anecdote I read of something that actually did happen to him on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. If there’s any one group of people who would do this to him, it would be New Yorkers. But what I would do would be begin with just the basic case for a change, which was not a difficult one to make: unemployment, the economic crisis, the sense of drift after the victory in the Gulf War, the sense that if President Bush had a job to do he had already done it. Just make the easy case for him. Then people would naturally think he’s going to keep going at the same emotional pitch—that would get a convention audience rocking and rolling. But instead, he would bring them down.\n\nWhat I did was just have him repeat something that actually happened to him in the New York primary. He would say, I told this to an audience in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The audience for the convention speech would expect Clinton to say, And they said, ‘Yes, we’ve got to change.’ But in fact what really happened was a man got up and said, ‘Well, you’re just a politician. Why should I believe a word you’re saying?’ So all of a sudden he would get the audience for the convention speech to wake up and listen carefully. This section of the convention speech would not be what the audience, in the convention hall and, more importantly, the national television audience, would expect a supposedly slick politician like Bill Clinton to be saying. Then, after telling the story of the voter who asked why he should believe a word he’s saying, Clinton would tell his personal story, which was very different from the privileged upbringing that many voters thought he had. Clinton introduced this section with these words—which also made it from the first draft on my legal pad on the plane to the spoken version—something like, Let me tell you as clearly as I can who I am, what I believe, and what I want to do as President.\n\nThen you get a whole bunch of stuff that isn’t applause lines. At the end it comes back to being something emotional. But it goes through an emotional low point, a section of the speech that is both somewhat personal, philosophical, and has no applause lines. Then it gets back up again. Now, in general, with the major speeches with Clinton both as candidate and as President, at least the time I was there, you’d almost have two patterns for the preparation of the speech. Either the speech would go through one draft or it would go through about 50 drafts, there was almost no middle ground.\n\nWhen there was only one draft for a speech, it was usually not one of the most important speeches. We would give him a draft and then he’d say whatever he wanted to say. With a major speech, we’d go through 50 drafts, because then he realized that the text he went up there with would have to bear a very strong resemblance to the words he would speak. He takes the words very seriously. He would belabor every word. The convention speech was like that, the inaugural was like that, the joint session speeches would be like that. Some foreign policy speeches would be like that.\n\nThe convention speech was my first experience with the 50-draft Clinton speech, but the basic structure was not that different from my first draft on the plane. First, it began with the basic case against Bush. Then, it brought the audience down, addressing their doubts about Bill Clinton and the political system in general. And, then, the emotional tone of the speech went back up—more upbeat, more inspirational—so he would conclude on a higher note than he began. The details of the speech went through me and Begala at a keyboard off and on very intensively, and during meetings with Clinton. His way of editing a speech then and throughout my work with him was not to edit it, but to rehearse it, editing while rehearsing.\n\nHe would get up at an improvised podium in the room where he was rehearsing/editing the speech and either read from the latest draft or extemporize. We’d have tape recorders and note pads. He would edit while speaking. His schedule would describe our meetings with the ambiguous title of speech preparation. But the man didn’t need to rehearse, it was editing by speaking. There was a lot of that. There was also just sending it around to all kinds of people inside and outside the campaign. So Bruce Reed and the DLC contingent had some input into it and a lot went in about the New Covenant, which was the formulation that Clinton had developed early in the campaign for linking opportunity and responsibility—a big part of the DLC approach. [Samuel] Sandy Berger and the foreign policy people had some input and we had a bit about foreign policy. Rodney Slater and other longtime friends from Arkansas would have an input into it.\n\nThere was Roy Spence, a media consultant from Texas who I don’t think ever actually produced paid TV spots for the campaign but who may have been involved in producing The Man from Hope video. He is a football fan. He had the crew working on the speech—Begala, me, him and others—put our hands together like we were a team going back on the field after halftime. The great thing he contributed was that we had to incorporate The Man from Hope into the speech. I still believe in a place called Hope is probably the most quoted line from his acceptance speech. The line was especially effective because Clinton delivered his convention speech right after The Man from Hope film was shown. Together, the film and the speech showed and told the American people who Bill Clinton really is—someone who has overcome adversity in his own life and who understands hardworking Americans.\n\nIf a speech is written by committee, it usually isn’t that good. But I think this speech benefited by having so many people have input into it. It’s not an elegant speech, but I think it served the purpose perfectly of telling Clinton’s story, presenting his point of view, and making the critique of Bush. And the proof of its effectiveness is that it helped to take him from running third behind Bush and Perot before the convention to running first from after the convention through Election Day.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have the benefit of feedback from the Manhattan project when you were engaged in the process of drafting the speech? I can’t recall whether the project was principally polling or—\n\nKusnet\n\nThis has all been written at great length in all the history of the campaign. When you say the consultants, you mean James Carville, Paul Begala, Stan Greenberg, and Mandy Grunwald. Frank Greer at the beginning, but for whatever reason, he played less of a visible personal role as the campaign went on. As I understood it, the Manhattan Project was the consultants, perhaps Greer and Greenberg more than Carville and Begala, because they were less physically present. There was polling and focus grouping. I think The Man from Hope was a response to it. That involved Roy Spence, the person I described from Texas, as well as others.\n\nIt just became so much a part of the culture of the campaign that I would hear things and just assume they were from the Manhattan Project. If it had ever at all been on paper it would have been leaked and it would have humiliated us. I think that’s probably the reason why they called it the Manhattan project; that was big, important, game changing in secret. I don’t think there was ever a document that from start to finish was the Manhattan project, because it would have been leaked and would have hurt us.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have the text of The Man from Hope video available to you as you were writing the speech?\n\nKusnet\n\nI know I watched it at some point before the convention. I watched some version of it. I think there, too, they probably didn’t want it on paper too much. The campaign was about information sharing, it wasn’t about paper sharing. You would not have wanted the video in circulation before the convention. But I had an idea about the video that would be shown before Clinton’s convention speech, that it was about his upbringing and about literally and figuratively bringing him down to earth.\n\nThe political class always knew who he was—someone from a troubled background who had risen through education and hard work. But the American people’s first exposure to him was [Gennifer] Flowers and the draft. Many people’s first idea about him probably was he was this guy you wouldn’t want your teenage daughter around by herself. Then many people got the idea that he’s really some overeducated, untested person. We had to bring him back down to earth again.\n\nRiley\n\nDid Clinton like the speech? Did you get the sense that he felt that it was—\n\nKusnet\n\nI think it was an up. I think he liked the experience of producing and giving the speech and certainly liked the idea that the day after he was first in the polls, while a week before he had been third. I don’t think he would have said it was a great spee"
