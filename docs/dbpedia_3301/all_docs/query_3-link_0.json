        "text": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) was honored today by the legislative affiliate of the Family Research Council (FRC) for his unwavering support of faith, family and freedom.\n\n“The Family Research Council fights for traditional values every day. Fighting for pro-family and pro-life legislation is important to my work representing Arkansas. I am honored to receive this award and stand with this group in support of values important to Arkansans,” Boozman said.\n\n“We can be encouraged by elected officials who are willing to be criticized by some in the media and the intolerant voices of secularism as they stand for family values. Congress as a whole is often criticized, and rightfully so, but there are individual Senators, like Senator Boozman, who deserve praise for their unwavering commitment to stand for life, family, marriage, and religious liberty,” Tony Perkins, Family Research Council President, said."
