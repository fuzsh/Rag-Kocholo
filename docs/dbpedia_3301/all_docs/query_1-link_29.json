Lord, as these gifted men and women serve the people of the United States, may they know you have them here by divine appointment, giving to them the influence, strength, and recognition they receive. As they make decisions that influence the entire world, I pray that you will fill them with supernatural insight, compassionate sensitivity, convictional kindness, and abounding wisdom. The needs are many and the tasks are overwhelming. They need you and each other in order to provide hope for the American people and the entire world. Use them today to change the world for your glory and for your name I pray, amen.\"\n\nKIDS' STATE DINNER\n\nA 10-year-old Arkansan will eat lunch at the White House with first lady Michelle Obama on July 18 after winning a healthy lunch recipe competition.\n\nHart Irby won the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge by creating Arkansas Meets Asia Catfish Sliders.\n\nWinners from all U.S. states, three territories, and the District of Columbia will attend a Kids' State Dinner at the White House hosted by Obama.\n\nSome of the winning recipes will be served, according to a news release.\n\nJOB CHANGES\n\nMichael Teague is now state director for the office of U.S. Sen.
