        "text": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) earned the True Blue Award, a distinction from the Family Research Council Action honoring his leadership in defense of faith, family and freedom.\n\nThe True Blue Award recognizes Boozman’s unwavering commitment to pro-life, pro-family, and pro-freedom legislation including protecting religious freedom, restricting Planned Parenthood from participating in the Paycheck Protection Program and opposing the confirmation of Xavier Becerra as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“I’m proud to advocate for conservative values and be a voice defending the right to life, family and religious liberty,” Boozman said. “It is an honor to receive the True Blue Award and I will always stand with the countless Arkansans and other Americans working to protect these principles.”\n\n“We honor the champions who have consistently stood up for life, family and religious liberty. As a result of their unrelenting efforts, many bad pieces of legislation failed, and many of the most egregious elements of the Biden administration’s radical Left agenda have been held in check,” FRC Action President Tony Perkins said. \"Arkansans should be encouraged to know that they have a champion like Sen. Boozman in Congress who, despite relentless attacks from the Left and the media, is standing strong for faith, family, and freedom.\"\n\nBoozman received the award based on his perfect 100 percent rating for his votes in the second session of the 116thCongress and the first session of the 117th Congress."
