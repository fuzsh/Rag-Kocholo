        "text": "Dr. Robert Lewis, former directional leader for Little Rock's Fellowship Bible Church, gave the opening prayer at the U.S. Senate in Washington on Thursday.\n\nLewis was the guest chaplain at the recommendation of U.S. Senator John Boozman, R-Rogers, according to a news release. The two played football together at the University of Arkansas, and in his remarks after the prayer, Boozman spoke of Lewis then and now.\n\n\"He was a very good football player and he had the gift of 'smack' -- he would hit you,\" Boozman said. \"He had a tremendous work ethic and tremendous character, and we all knew he would do well in whatever he decided to do.\"\n\nLewis is also the founder of Men's Fraternity, a ministry and faith-based curriculum devoted to helping men find \"authentic manhood\" through their relationship with and as followers of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Senate chaplain invites two ordained clergy members to pray as guest chaplains each month, the release stated, and guests have represented all the world's major religions.\n\nReligion on 10/19/2019"
