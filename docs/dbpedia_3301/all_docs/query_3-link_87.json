        "text": "Amid all the political and election-related developments that take center stage, it can be easy to sideline the regular business of governing. I’m grateful for my team at Bread for the World, our coalition partners, anti-hunger advocates across the nation, and elected leaders who have been tirelessly advocating for the Child Tax Credit for years. This is one way - and a significant way at that - we can make progress in ending child hunger in the United States: The Senate is expected to vote THIS Thursday on tax legislation that includes the expanded Child Tax Credit. The House passed it in January with a bipartisan majority – now it’s the Senate’s turn to act. The Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024 combines tax cuts for America’s corporations with a tax cut for America’s kids. It’s not a perfect bill. But if we can do one, we must certainly do the other. The Child Tax Credit expansion prioritizes children whose families currently receive only a partial child tax credit or no credit at all because their incomes are too low. 16 million children will benefit. The Child Tax Credit offers clear and unmistakable ROI. When it was expanded in 2021, America cut child poverty by almost half and cut hunger by a quarter for families with children. Childhood poverty doubled when it and other pandemic relief programs came to an end. There are 16,000,000 reasons this bill should pass. 16 million children. Join me in asking our Senators to prioritize childhood hunger and poverty by supporting the Child Tax Credit improvements that are part of the bipartisan, bicameral Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024. Here's a simple way you can contact Congress: https://lnkd.in/gGhcbcTt\n\nWe are all deeply shaken. May we be in prayer for former President Donald Trump and his recovery. Pray for his family. Additionally, pray for rally attendees that may have been killed or injured. Regardless of one's political affiliation or lack thereof, there is no room for political violence in our democracy and we must reject and condemn all forms. We are living in one of the most polarized times in our nation. In the coming days, weeks, and months ahead…we can either escalate or struggle to embody a better way. We must choose the latter. May we recommit ourselves to defending and strengthening our democracy. May we be in prayer for America. May we be in prayer for our world - and so many that are ensnared in conflict and violence. Lord, in your mercy…\n\nI'm grateful for these remarks from Administrator Samantha Power specifically for the Bread for the World community. She highlights the critical impact of our work during the worst global food security crisis in at least a generation. And of course, thanks to so many who tirelessly work together as a coalition. \"I feel very privileged to speak with you...Your advocacy comes at a very important time: a global food security crisis exacerbated by the climate crisis, historic levels of conflict, and the lingering effects of Covid-19 has put 164 million people at risk of severe or crisis levels of acute food insecurity. That's a 92% increase from before the global pandemic. For more than 40 years, Bread for the World has relentlessly advocated to feed people in need. Your work is saving countless lives. I will offer just one recent example: Last fall, when the United States Congress began negotiations on a National Security Supplemental that would give us the resources to meet this skyrocketing need. Bread for the World jumped into action. You engaged your membership of over 300,000 individuals, churches, congregations, parishes, and partners to advocate, give, and to pray. Through months of uncertainty you maintained an unrelenting voice as you asked just one thing: That we help feed the people who need it most. And you not only mobilized your supporters you coordinated with more than 75 NGOs to support this vital supplemental. Your efforts which were a key factor in mobilizing broad bipartisan support for the supplemental will help us continue to support these needs in places around the world: Sending food aid to places like Gaza, Sudan and Haiti where conflict has driven millions of people to severe hunger, southern Africa where El Nino in contributing to severe droughts and farmers are working to feed more people in a tougher climate and of course Ukraine where we are supporting Ukrainian farmers... The success of the supplemental - getting it through is just one example of the important work that Bread for the World does every single day. Living your faith and mobilizing people to take action on behalf of the world's most vulnerable. Thank you for your work.\"\n\nIt was an honor and a pleasure to hear from Dina Esposito, Assistant to the Administrator for USAID’s Bureau for Resilience, Environment, and Food Security and Feed the Future Deputy Coordinator for Development at Bread for the World ’s Advocacy Summit this week. She named the series of unprecedented shocks – the pandemic; ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, and additional hunger hotpots; droughts in the Horn of Africa and other regions – that have reversed many of the gains made against hunger over the last decade. More people are not only hungry, but acutely hungry. Yet progress is being made to help people respond to these crises. She thanked Bread for the World for our advocacy in support of the emergency supplemental that Congress passed a couple of months ago, which included $9.15 billion in desperately needed humanitarian assistance. She thanked Bread for the World for our advocacy to strengthen our U.S. food assistance programs through the Farm Bill. Ms. Esposito stressed the importance of maintaining and expanding flexibilities in Food for Peace that allow partners to make the most efficient decisions so that our food assistance dollars stretch further. She also talked about the power of Feed the Future, the U.S. government’s global hunger initiative that Bread has supported since its beginning, to build resilience to shocks. If we can help countries and communities better anticipate shocks that drive hunger and help them grow more food and sustain their livelihoods no matter what comes, then we can greatly reduce the need for humanitarian assistance in the future. I am, and Bread for the World is, grateful for Dina Esposito’s remarks. Support from the Administration, along with bipartisan Congressional support, is necessary to continue holding firm against further increases in hunger – and to putting hunger on the decline once again. Congress has an opportunity to put us back on track with the upcoming #FarmBill. I thank Agriculture Committee leaders in both houses and parties for taking steps to move the Farm Bill forward. Now, I urge bipartisan hunger leaders in Congress to step up and negotiate with each other to find some common ground on Food for Peace and SNAP that both parties can support. Going another year without updates to the Farm Bill helps no one. Taking action now will make a difference.\n\nI was thrilled to join Fred Oladeinde and others at the 9th Annual AGOA Civil Society Organization (CSO) Network Spring Conference on Capitol Hill last week to talk about the African Growth and Opportunity Act. AGOA is the most important legislation that defines trade relationships between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa. Bread was an early supporter of AGOA, advocating for it since 1998, because it makes sense that U.S. trade policies and agreements contribute to efforts to reduce hunger and poverty. AGOA offers African businesses the opportunity to expand and generate more income for their families and communities. Inclusive economic growth, particularly in the agriculture sector, is key to lasting solutions to hunger and malnutrition – and it’s essential to realizing Bread’s value of human flourishing. Bread for the World is pleased that Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and James Risch (R-ID) introduced the AGOA Renewal and Improvement Act of 2024 a few weeks ago, and we hope – and will advocate – that the next reauthorization of AGOA happen as soon as possible.\n\nLast week I had the opportunity to attend The World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings in Washington, DC for the first time. And it was an honor and privilege to participate in meetings with Executive Directors, convenings of CSOs, and an interview with Axel von Trotsenburg, Senior Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships. This is such a critical time for global and regional action to address poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. The need is tremendous. And none of us, no one country, can do it alone – it’s only by working together that we will be able to achieve our goals. IDA is, to me, a great example of that. In a time when global hunger needs along with other development challenges are rising, countries and communities simply need more funding than any one donor, like the U.S. government, can provide. The amount of financing that IDA can provide is a lifeline to many countries when they need that financial support to provide for their people. That said, we also call on the US to demonstrate leadership by making a significant and robust replenishment pledge. And it’s a long-term investment that pays off. Nineteen countries – including Korea, where I was born – graduated from being a recipient of IDA decades ago, to now being a donor to IDA. Bread for the World echoes World Bank President Ajay Banga’s call for IDA21 to be the biggest replenishment in its history. And we encourage a new lens of food and nutrition security in this replenishment. We have an opportunity to help ensure countries have access to the necessary resources to address the mounting risks of overlapping nutrition, food security, and health crises, and we should take it.

This week, Bread for the World and several partners are asking Congress to respond to the food insecurity crisis with another “C” – COURAGE. It’s going to take a lot of courage to pass a strong Farm Bill at this point in this Congress. Contention is high coming out of a long appropriations process. Elections are coming up. There are lots of reasons to put working together on the Farm Bill on the back burner. But there are also significant reasons to get it done now. Millions of reasons, actually. And there are many members of Congress who are eager to make it happen, and ready to reach across the aisle and find bipartisan solutions. Having met with Senate Agriculture leaders Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow and Ranking Member John Boozman, and House Agriculture leaders Chairman GT Thompson and Ranking Member David Scott - I’m optimistic, hopeful, and prayerful that we may yet be able to find the courage, and the solutions, we need. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to stand alongside partners and people with lived experience of the issues we're advocating for from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Alliance to End Hunger, Fair Food Network, Zero Food Waste Coalition, and Farm Journal Foundation and more, to brief congressional staffers about the Farm Bill and urge them to pass updated legislation this year.\n\nJoin me as I continue to pray for the release of hostages, for a lasting ceasefire, and for peace to reign in the region. But as we pray, I want to urge you to also take a moment to reach out to your representative, urging them to support a supplemental humanitarian aid package that stands as a beacon of hope for so many. Your advocacy can drive a profound change and bring relief to those who continue to suffer. As is the case in Gaza, conflict is a leading driver of hunger. In fact, 8 out of 10 of the world’s worst hunger crises are caused by conflict. And it is innocent people, particularly children, who suffer the most. Of the approximately 1.7 million people who have been internally displaced in Gaza, half are children. While a diplomatically settled peace is the most obvious and lasting solution, a robust humanitarian response from the U.S., other nations, and partner international aid organizations can help address some of the suffering caused by these conflicts. Our moral compass compels us to act — Jesus compels us to act and to extend our hands in compassion to those who are hungry. Inaction is simply not an option for us. Let us proceed with purpose, always bearing in mind the imperative: “Whenever you did one of these things to someone overlooked or ignored, that was me — you did it to me.” Jesus is hungry in Gaza. Will we feed him? Read my full article. - https://lnkd.in/g-W9kRr4\n\nCongress is considering an expansion of the Child Tax Credit. This isn’t quite a legislative miracle – but it’s certainly unexpected good news. And, say it with me: We need good news! The changes to the CTC in this bipartisan, bicameral legislation would allow more lower income children and families will be able to receive the full credit, prioritizing children whose families currently receive only a partial credit or no credit at all because their incomes are too low. Approximately 16 million children will benefit from the expansion. 16,000,000 children. The Child Tax Credit reduces poverty like nothing we’ve seen. And since this measure is largely revenue-neutral, it has a chance to pass despite the deep divisions on Congress over spending levels. Bread for the World is urging Congree to vote YES on the expanded Child Tax Credit. In addition to increasing the Child Tax Credit, the \"Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024\" would restore the full value of declining business tax deductions for investments in research and development and plant and equipment. The measure also includes tax breaks for affordable housing and people hit by disasters, including wildfires and a train derailment in Ohio last year.
