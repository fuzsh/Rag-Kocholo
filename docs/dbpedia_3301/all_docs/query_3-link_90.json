        "text": "U.S. Sen. John Boozman (R-AR), the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, was instrumental in releasing a Senate Republican-drafted framework for inclusion in a more farmer-focused farm bill.\n\n“From the onset of this process, we have sought to draft a farm bill that reflects the needs of stakeholders,” he said. “The world has changed dramatically since the 2018 bill became law, and the unprecedented challenges and economic uncertainty that farmers face now are only projected to get worse in the coming years.”\n\nFollowing on the House Committee on Agriculture’s bipartisan passage of a 2024 farm bill plan, Boozman said his committee has provided a framework that exhibits a shared common ground with Democrat counterparts on several key priorities and offers a path forward in the places where they differ.\n\nThe U.S. House is a Republican-led chamber while the U.S. Senate, including the ag committee, is Democratic led, with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) as its chairperson.\n\n“Dairy farmers and their cooperatives commend Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member John Boozman for issuing a strong farm bill framework that marks another important step toward enacting a bipartisan farm bill into law this year,” said Gregg Doud, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation. “Boozman’s framework includes numerous dairy priorities, such as reauthorizing and updating the vital Dairy Margin Coverage safety net and advancing NMPF-led bipartisan bills to spur approval of innovative feed ingredients, protect the use of common food names, and boost consumption of nutritious milk among our nation’s youth.”\n\nThe National Association of Wheat Growers President Keeff Felty said, “This is a step in the right direction and will hopefully lead to Senate action soon.”\n\nPriorities from that group include:\n\nProtecting crop insurance that serves as the cornerstone of the farm safety net.\n\nWorking to strengthen and enhance Title I and crop insurance to protect farmers better.\n\nSupporting financial and technical assistance through voluntary conservation cost-share programs for producers in all climates and wheat-producing regions.\n\nEncouraging additional investment in agricultural trade promotions and US commodities as part of the Farm Bill’s trade title.\n\nSupporting wheat research programs authorized under the Farm Bill and robust funding as part of the annual appropriations process.\n\n“I have been proud to partner with Chairwoman Stabenow on priority issues and shepherd significant reforms into law, particularly the accomplishments focused on climate and nutrition,” Boozman said. “These accomplishments would not have been possible without a commitment to working together as good faith partners. Senate Republicans have every intention of continuing farm bill negotiations in the same manner and remain committed to advancing a bipartisan farm bill that meets the needs of farmers, ranchers, foresters, rural communities and consumers nationwide.”"
