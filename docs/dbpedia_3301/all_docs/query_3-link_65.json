        "text": "VICKSBURG, Miss.-- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Vicksburg District recognized 150 years of service to the nation with a formal celebration at district headquarters last Wednesday.\n\nDistinguished guests included Sam Andrews on behalf of Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, Mississippi Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, State Sen. Kevin Ford, JoAnne Clark on behalf of Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, Chase Emerson on behalf of Sen. John Boozman, Colby White on behalf of Sen. Tom Cotton, Hannah Livingston on behalf of Sen. John Kennedy, Stephanie Booker on behalf of Congressman Bennie Thompson, Brady Stewart on behalf of Congressman Michael Guest, Ramona Martin on behalf of Congresswoman Julia Letlow, Mayor George Flaggs, Jr., and Gene Higginbotham.\n\nThe event included a signed proclamation by Gov. Tate Reeves and remarks from Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who thanked the district’s past and present employees for their service. Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs, Jr. also noted the district’s contributions to the region, particularly during floods in recent years.\n\nUSACE Vicksburg District Commander Col. Christopher Klein presented Gene Higginbotham, a longtime public servant for various U.S. Representatives, with the Commander’s Award for Public Service Medal for his outstanding contributions.\n\nCarl Young, Jr., a winchman on the district’s Mat Sinking Unit (MSU), opened the program with the invocation, and the Vicksburg High School Madrigal Choir sang an acapella rendition of the National Anthem.\n\nThe district was founded Aug. 18, 1873, when Capt. William Henry Harrison Benyaurd opened a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Monroe, Louisiana. The first permanent Vicksburg office was established in 1884. Following the Great Flood of 1927 and subsequent Flood Control Act of 1928, the district created a comprehensive flood control program centered around the Mississippi River. The effort’s lasting effects include four Mississippi lakes and three Arkansas lakes created as flood control reservoirs, as well as numerous miles of Mississippi River mainline levees and other flood control structures. The Vicksburg District’s projects and personnel continue to serve the region, the nation, and the world.\n\nFor more information, contact the Public Affairs Office at 601-631-5000.\n\nThe USACE Vicksburg District is engineering solutions to the nation’s toughest challenges. The Vicksburg District encompasses a 68,000-square-mile area across portions of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, that holds nine major river basins and incorporates approximately 460 miles of mainline Mississippi River levees. The Vicksburg District is engaged in hundreds of projects and employs approximately 1,100 personnel."
