Programs in the DOT support road, transit, rail, pipeline, and aviation infrastructure development, safety oversight, and enforcement; the operation of the Nation's interstate highway system, air traffic control system, and passenger rail network; maritime readiness for the surge and sustainment of the U.S. military; and port infrastructure development. Resources for HUD support economic development, affordable housing production, and housing assistance for those most in need, including the elderly, disabled, and people experiencing homelessness. The bill also provides funding for the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and the Government National Mortgage Association [Ginnie Mae] to continue their traditional roles of providing access to affordable homeownership in the United States. The bill, as reported, provides the proper balance of funding for transportation, housing, and community development programs and activities. It is consistent with the subcommittee's allocation for fiscal year 2024. All accounts in the bill have been closely examined to ensure that a sufficient level of funding is provided to carry out the programs and activities of the DOT, HUD, and related agencies. Details on each of the accounts and the Committee's justifications for the funding levels are included in this report. PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY During fiscal year 2024, for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended, with respect to appropriations contained in the accompanying bill, the terms ``program, project, and activity'' [PPA] shall mean any item for which a dollar amount is contained in appropriations acts (including joint resolutions providing continuing appropriations), accompanying reports or explanatory statements of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, or accompanying conference reports and joint explanatory statements of the committee of conference. This definition shall apply to all programs for which new budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well as to discretionary grants and discretionary grant allocations made through either bill or report language. REPROGRAMMING GUIDELINES The Committee includes provisions in section 405 establishing the authority by which funding available to the agencies funded by this act or division J of Public Law 117-58 may be reprogrammed for other purposes. These provisions specifically require the advanced approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations of any proposal to reprogram funds that: --creates a new program; --eliminates a PPA; --increases funds or personnel for any PPA for which funds have been denied or restricted by the Congress; --proposes to redirect funds that were directed in such reports or explanatory statements for a specific activity to a different purpose; --augments an existing PPA in excess of $5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less; --reduces an existing PPA by $5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less; or --creates, reorganizes, or restructures offices different from the congressional budget justifications or the report accompanying this act, whichever is more detailed. This direction applies to both the bill and accompanying reports or explanatory statements. The Committee retains the requirement that each agency submit an operating plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than 60 days after enactment of this act to establish the baseline for application of reprogramming and transfer authorities provided in this act. Specifically, each agency should provide a table for each appropriation with columns displaying the prior year enacted level; budget request; adjustments made by Congress; adjustments for rescissions, if appropriate; and the fiscal year enacted level. The table shall delineate the appropriation and prior year enacted level both by object class and by PPA, as detailed in this act, accompanying reports, and explanatory statements of the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations, or in the budget appendix for the respective appropriations, whichever is more detailed, and shall apply to all items for which a dollar amount is specified and to all programs for which new budget (obligational) authority is provided, as well as to discretionary grants and discretionary grant allocations. The report must also identify items of special congressional interest. The Committee expects the agencies and bureaus to submit reprogramming requests in a timely manner and to provide a thorough explanation of the proposed reallocations, including a detailed justification of increases and reductions and the specific impact the proposed changes will have on the budget request for the following fiscal year. Except in emergency situations, reprogramming requests should be submitted no later than June 30. The Committee expects each agency to manage its programs and activities within the amounts appropriated by Congress. The Committee reminds agencies that reprogramming requests should be submitted only in the case of an unforeseeable emergency or a situation that could not have been anticipated when formulating the budget request for the current fiscal year. Further, the Committee notes that when a Department or agency submits a reprogramming or transfer request to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and does not receive identical responses from the House and Senate, it is the responsibility of the Department to reconcile the House and Senate differences before proceeding, and if reconciliation is not possible, to consider the request to reprogram funds not approved. The Committee would also like to clarify that these sections apply to the working capital funds [WCF] for DOT and HUD, and that no funds may be obligated from such funds to augment programs, projects or activities for which appropriations have been specifically rejected by the Congress, or to increase funds or personnel for any PPA above the amounts appropriated by this act. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS Budget justifications are the primary tool used by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations to evaluate the resource requirements and fiscal needs of agencies. The Committee is aware that the format and presentation of budget materials is largely left to the agency within presentation objectives set forth by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. The Committee expects all of the budget justifications to provide the data needed to make appropriate and meaningful funding decisions. This should include the customary level of detailed data and explanatory statements to support the appropriations requests at the level of detail contained in any funding table. Among other items, agencies shall provide a detailed discussion of proposed new initiatives, proposed changes in the agency's financial plan from prior year enactment, and detailed data on all programs and comprehensive information on any office or agency restructurings. At a minimum, each agency must also provide adequate justification for funding and staffing changes for each individual office and materials that compare programs, projects, and activities that are proposed for fiscal year 2025 to the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. The Committee is aware that the analytical materials required for review by the Committee are unique to each agency in this act. Therefore, the Committee expects that each agency will coordinate with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in advance on its planned presentation for its budget justification materials in support of the fiscal year 2025 budget request. The Committee also reminds all agencies funded in this act to provide accurate organizational charts in the budget justifications. The Committee considers any changes to the organization charts to be a reprogramming requiring approval of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations under section 405 of this act. With the significant, historical investments of the IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] in addition to annual appropriations funding, the Committee requires a clear and accurate presentation of annual available and requested budgetary resources for each fiscal year in the congressional budget justifications that accompany the President's budget request. Each agency funded under this act shall present all available budgetary resources from contract authority, mandatory budget authority, advanced appropriations, and discretionary budget authority in its congressional justification. Each agency shall also delineate the funding for salaries and expenses [S&E] and number of full-time equivalent [FTE] and full-time positions [FTP] separate and distinct from the programmatic funding, including in the detailed tables in the congressional budget justification. This shall include all S&E funding and FTE/FTP provided by administrative takedowns from any and all budgetary resources. Advance appropriations from division J of the IIJA includes takedowns for administrative expenses, and amounts that are made available for programmatic activities should not be used to exceed the administrative limitation specified in division J of the IIJA. FTEs funded by division J are expected to be managed as a separate and distinct resource and shall not be included or represented as an adjustment to base in the annual discretionary budget request for S&E. TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENT The Committee remains interested in increasing transparency and accountability of Federal grant spending. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education are directed by the Stevens Amendment, section 505 of title V, division H of Public Law 115-141, to require grantees to include the total cost of the project, the percentage of Federal funds in the project or program, and identify all of the sources of funding for the total project or program in all public documents announcing the grant award. The Committee directs agencies to collect data on what information Federal grant recipients currently include in the public documents announcing the grant award to determine whether recipients of funding in this act could comply with the Stevens Amendment without unreasonable burden. The Committee expresses appreciation for the Department that has submitted the report and again reminds the remaining Department to provide the report required in fiscal year 2020 on the feasibility of complying with the Stevens Amendment. AUDIT STANDARDS The Committee is concerned about Federal agencies executing contracts with certain independent financial auditing and audit remediation firms that have been penalized for poor auditing practices. The Committee believes that all firms contracting with departments and agencies funded in this act, particularly for financial auditing and accounting services, should have qualified professionals and ethics, and integrity controls in place to ensure they are in compliance with Federal accounting and procurement standards. For all contract actions (including awards, renewals, and amendments), departments and agencies provided funding in this act shall require any accounting firm providing financial auditing or audit remediation services to provide a statement setting forth the details of any disciplinary proceedings occurring within 1 year of the projected performance period related to noncompliance with rules or laws applying to audit services. FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH The Committee urges DOT and HUD to affirmatively determine and make available on a publicly accessible website a justification that federally funded research grants or agreements promote the progress of science in the United States or will advance a national security or economic interest. HUMAN TRAFFICKING The Committee directs the Department of Transportation to encourage relevant stakeholders, including airports, transit hubs, and recipients of financial assistance from the Department, to implement comprehensive policies to combat human trafficking and support survivors based on guidance and recommendations from the DOT Advisory Committee on Human Trafficking. AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM ALIGNMENT Affordable housing development projects often require multiple sources of Federal funding in order to maintain affordable rents, but conflicting or duplicative requirements can add administrative burden, transaction costs, and development time to the project. For example, a single property financed by multiple Federal programs may require two, three, or more separate inspections in a single year, wasting taxpayer dollars and grantee's time that could be better spent on assisting more families. During an April 2023 hearing on the fiscal year 2024 President's budget request, the Secretary of HUD acknowledged the need to standardize program requirements as much as possible and committed to reducing duplicative inspections and addressing the thicket of statutory, regulatory, and procedural barriers that cause conflict and duplication. The Committee directs HUD to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of enactment of this act on priority administrative actions to harmonize requirements and reduce duplicative efforts across Federal rental assistance programs, key milestones for agency action in fiscal year 2024, and how the Department intends to staff the effort to ensure sustained progress. The Committee also supports this alignment work by directing interagency coordination across HUD, the Department of the Treasury, and the United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] to reduce duplicative inspections, directing HUD to provide clarifying guidance and technical guidance to HOME investment partnerships program [HOME] grantees on alternative processes to reduce duplicative inspections, urging HUD to prioritize critical staff positions to support program alignment, and urging HUD to issue the proposed rules to streamline and modernize the HOME and community development block grant [CDBG] programs. TITLE I DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of the Secretary Section 3 of the Department of Transportation Act of October 15, 1966 (Public Law 89-670), provides for the establishment of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation [OST]. OST is comprised of the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary immediate and support offices; the Office of the General Counsel; the Office of the Under Secretary of Transportation for Policy, including the offices of the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, and the Assistant Secretary for Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy; five Assistant Secretarial offices for Budget and Programs, Governmental Affairs, Research and Technology, and Administration; and the Offices of Public Affairs and Public Engagement, the Executive Secretariat, Intelligence, Security and Emergency Response, the Chief Information Officer, and Tribal Government Affairs. OST also includes the Department's Office of Civil Rights and the Department's working capital fund. SALARIES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $171,014,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 220,406,000 Committee recommendation................................ 191,295,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This appropriation finances the costs of policy development and central supervisory and coordinating functions necessary for the overall planning and direction of the Department. It covers the immediate secretarial offices as well as those of the assistant secretaries and the general counsel. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends a total of $191,295,000 for the salaries and expenses of OST, including $70,000 for reception and representation expenses. The recommendation is $29,111,000 less than the budget request and $20,281,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The accompanying bill authorizes the Secretary to transfer up to seven percent of the funds from any office within the Office of the Secretary to another. The Committee recommendation also continues language that permits up to $2,500,000 of fees to be credited to the Office of the Secretary for salaries and expenses. The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation in comparison to the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and the budget request: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal year-- ------------------------------------ Committee 2023 enacted 2024 estimate recommendation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Office of the Secretary................................... 3,569,000 ................ 3,770,000 Office of the Deputy Secretary............................ 1,277,000 ................ 1,370,000 Office of the General Counsel............................. 28,089,000 ................ 32,272,000 Office of the Under Secretary for Policy.................. 17,469,000 ................ 20,064,000 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs. 21,026,000 ................ 22,724,000 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Government Affairs.. 3,968,000 ................ 7,138,000 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration...... 41,399,000 ................ 43,284,000 Office of Public Affairs and Public Engagement............ 5,727,000 ................ 6,244,000 Office of the Executive Secretariat....................... 2,312,000 ................ 2,515,000 Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response.. 15,533,000 ................ 16,506,000 Office of the Chief Information Officer................... 29,195,000 ................ 33,879,000 Office of Tribal Government Affairs....................... 1,450,000 ................ 1,529,000 ----------------------------------------------------- Total............................................... 171,014,000 220,406,000 191,295,000 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Secretary of Transportation provides leadership and has the primary responsibility to provide overall planning, direction, and control of the Department. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $3,770,000 for fiscal year 2024 for the Immediate Office of the Secretary. The recommendation is $201,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The Committee directs the Department to abide by both the will and intent of Congress in all funding and policy decisions, and to consult with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to issuing all notices of funding opportunities [NOFOs]. Buy America.--The Committee is encouraged by the recent OMB guidance on Buy America as it relates to Federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure. This guidance is consistent with Executive Order 14005 ``Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers.'' To support a competitive domestic marketplace, the Committee recognizes the need for infrastructure to be built by American companies, using American products where possible to maximize the safety, security, and economic impact of Federal investments in the United States. IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Deputy Secretary has the primary responsibility of assisting the Secretary in the overall planning and direction of the Department. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $1,370,000 for the Immediate Office of the Deputy Secretary, which is $93,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of the General Counsel provides legal services to the Office of the Secretary, including the conduct of aviation regulatory proceedings and aviation consumer activities, and coordinates and reviews the legal work in the chief counsels' offices of the operating administrations. The General Counsel is the chief legal officer of the Department and the final authority on all legal questions. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $32,272,000 for expenses of the Office of the General Counsel for fiscal year 2024. The recommended funding level is $4,183,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The Committee recommendation supports adjustments to base and additional contract support as requested. OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR POLICY PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Under Secretary for Policy is the chief policy officer of the Department and is responsible for the analysis, development, and review of policies and plans for domestic and international transportation matters. The office administers the economic regulatory functions regarding the airline industry and is responsible for international aviation programs, the essential air service program, airline fitness licensing, acquisitions, international route awards, computerized reservation systems, and special investigations, such as those involving airline delays. Within this office, the IIJA also created an Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy [MFIP] to oversee certain multimodal freight grant programs, carry out the National multimodal freight policy, and facilitate the movement of freight across and within different modes of transportation. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $20,064,000 for the Office of the Under Secretary for Policy, of which $2,000,000 is for the Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy. The recommended funding level is $2,595,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The Committee recommendation supports adjustments to base and the Department's strategic plan activities as requested. Office of Multimodal Freight Infrastructure and Policy.-- The Committee is concerned that the Department has not provided an update on the status of the creation of the office as statutorily required under 49 U.S.C. 118(i). The Committee directs the Department to expeditiously provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and the relevant authorizing committees with the report required. Further, the Department is required to notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to the execution of the authorities under 49 U.S.C. 118(g)(2)-(3). Department Policies.--The Department's current statement of international air transportation policy was last updated in 1995 and is now over 28 years old. The Committee directs the Department to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of this policy document. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything Safety Technology.--The use of cellular vehicle-to-everything [C-V2X] technology has the potential to contribute to a variety of ongoing transportation solutions, including facilitating emergency services and improving traffic flow, among others. As such, the Committee expects the Department to encourage the use of C-V2X as a technology-based safety solution by non-Federal projects sponsors. The Department should do so through program guidance, NOFOs for discretionary grant programs, and national roadway safety strategy implementation, where permissible and feasible. The Department should also explore, where appropriate, opportunities to facilitate and accelerate voluntary widespread deployment of transportation efficiency solutions, which include C-V2X, including by conducting research and deployment of emerging technologies and innovative concepts that may foster more rapid public adoption. Veteran Recruitment.--The men and women of our nation's military gain significant skills and experience that are readily transferable to second careers in transportation once these individuals separate from military service. Truck drivers, air traffic controllers, aviation maintenance technicians, and others in the military receive specialized training to safely perform their missions in the military. As the DOT seeks to attract veterans into Federal civil service, the Committee encourages the Secretary to collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including military and industry representatives, to evaluate military training and hands-on experience. This collaboration should identify areas where agency training requirements can be streamlined, while maintaining safety and quality standards, to facilitate the efficient integration of veterans into DOT career positions. Interagency Review.--The Committee directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide comments on the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed rule (87 FR 46921) being considered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including a discussion on the potential impacts that navigation restrictions could have on maritime traffic as well as downstream impacts to other modes of transportation associated with offloading cargo at ports receiving vessel traffic affected by these proposals and the feasibility of using vessel monitoring technology to continuously monitor and report vessel speed. OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR BUDGET AND PROGRAMS PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs serves as the Chief Financial Officer for the Department and provides leadership on all financial management matters. The primary responsibilities of this office include ensuring the development and justification of the Department's annual budget submissions for consideration by the OMB and the Congress. The Office is also responsible for the proper execution and accountability of these resources. In addition, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer for the Office of the Secretary is located within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $22,724,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget and Programs. The recommended level is $1,698,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level for adjustments to base. OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs advises the Secretary on all congressional and intergovernmental activities and on all departmental legislative initiatives and other relationships with Members of Congress. The Assistant Secretary promotes effective communication with other Federal agencies and regional Department officials, and with State and local governments and national organizations for development of departmental programs and ensures that consumer preferences, awareness, and needs are brought into the decision-making process. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends a total of $7,138,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs. The recommended level is $3,170,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level to accommodate adjustments to base and modernization of the grants notification system [GNS] as requested. OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Assistant Secretary for Administration is responsible for establishing policies and procedures; setting guidelines; working with the operating administrations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Department in human resource management, security and administrative management; real and personal property management; and acquisition and grants management. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $43,284,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration. The recommended funding level is $1,885,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level in order to accommodate adjustments to base. OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Director of Public Affairs is the principal advisor to the Secretary and other senior departmental officials on public affairs questions. The Office is responsible for managing the Secretary's presence in the media, writing speeches and press releases, and preparing the Secretary for public appearances. The Office arranges media events and news conferences, and responds to media inquiries on the Department's programs and other transportation-related issues. It also provides information to the Secretary on the opinions and reactions of the public and news media on these programs and issues. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $6,244,000 for the Office of Public Affairs, which is $517,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level in order to accommodate adjustments to base. EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Executive Secretariat assists the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary in carrying out their management functions and responsibilities by controlling and coordinating internal and external written materials. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $2,515,000 for the Executive Secretariat. The recommendation is $203,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response ensures the development, coordination, and execution of plans and procedures for the Department to balance transportation security requirements with the safety, mobility, and economic needs of the Nation. The Office keeps the Secretary and senior leadership apprised of current developments and long-range trends in international issues, including terrorism, aviation, trade, transportation markets, and trade agreements. The Office also advises the Department's leaders on policy issues related to intelligence, threat information sharing, national security strategies, and national preparedness and response planning. To ensure the Department is able to respond to disasters, the Office prepares for and coordinates the Department's participation in national and regional exercises and training for emergency personnel; administers the Department's continuity of government and continuity of operations programs and initiatives; provides direct emergency response and recovery support through the National response framework; and operates the Department's crisis management center that monitors the Nation's transportation system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is the Department's focal point during emergencies. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $16,506,000 for the Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response. The recommendation is $973,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of the Chief Information Officer serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary on matters involving information technology [IT], cybersecurity, privacy, and records management. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $33,879,000 for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, which is $4,684,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level to accommodate adjustments to base and IT modernization and shared services agreements as requested. The Committee notes that $6,500,000 was provided in fiscal year 2023 for electronic records modernization. This activity does not have a recurring acquisition cost in fiscal year 2024, but was assumed as an activity within the base request. For future budget requests, the Office should only include the sustainment of such systems. OFFICE OF TRIBAL AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Tribal and Governmental Affairs was authorized in the IIJA to advise the Secretary and senior leadership in the Department on all Tribal matters. The Office works to fulfill the Secretary's legislative priorities that will strengthen Tribal economies, improve infrastructure, and serve as the liaison between the Department and Tribal government in support of Tribal self-governance activities. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $1,529,000 for the Office of Tribal and Governmental Affairs. The recommendation is $79,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level to accommodate adjustment to base and no additional positions. RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY Appropriations, 2023.................................... $48,996,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 66,500,000 Committee recommendation................................ 51,358,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology has taken over the responsibilities previously held by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration. The responsibilities include coordinating, facilitating, and reviewing the Department's research and development programs and activities; and overseeing and providing direction to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office, the university transportation centers program, the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, and the Transportation Safety Institute. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends an appropriation of $51,358,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology. This amount is $2,362,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and $15,142,000 less than the budget request. The Committee is concerned that the representation of administrative costs provided to the Committee in the congressional justification is not fully inclusive of all FTP costs for the office. Thereby, the annual adjustments to base to accommodate the preservation of approved staffing levels in accordance with executive branch cost of living adjustments and other costs are not fully captured. The funding level provided, with available carryover balances, will support the staffing levels on board as of July 10, 2023, and the adjustments to base to preserve these positions for fiscal year 2024 as the office adjusts the 26 FTP funded in programmatic activities to an administrative budget line item as directed in the front matter of this report. This funding level assumes sufficient carryover funding to sustain the programmatic activities of the highly automated systems safety [HASS] center of excellence [COE] at $4,600,000 and the climate initiative at $2,100,000 in fiscal year 2024. Positioning Navigation and Timing [PNT] Technologies and Global Positioning System [GPS] Backup.--The Committee reiterates its support of the findings in the Department's January, 2023 report entitled, ``Complementary PNT and GPS Backup Technologies Demonstration Report (DOT-VNTSC-20-07)'', which found that ``the best strategy for achieving resilient PNT service is to pursue multiple technologies to promote diversity in the PNT functions that support transportation and other critical infrastructure sectors.'' The report found that based on the demonstration, the technologies that show strong performance, operational diversity, operational readiness, and cost effectiveness are the low-frequency and ultra-high frequency terrestrial and L-band satellite broadcasts for PNT functions with supporting fiber optic time services to transmitters/control segments. The Committee recommendation sustains the fiscal year 2023 investment of $15,000,000 in fiscal year 2024 to enable the Secretary to maintain the complementary PNT and backup GPS technologies program, which will allow for the wide adoption of multiple technologies that provide the necessary GPS backup and complementary PNT as identified by the Department's report. This amount is in addition to the anticipated carryover of $14,900,000 from prior year funds. Funding will enable, among other things, the development of safety-critical PNT requirements and standards, vulnerability and performance testing, certification protocols for safety-critical functions, the procurement of services as deemed appropriate by the Department, and user adoption models in order to facilitate the responsible use of resilient PNT services to meet Federal requirements for widespread adoption. The Committee expects the Department to report its findings and recommendations enabling GPS backup to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 1 year of enactment of this act. The Committee commends the Department for its action to ensure cybersecurity and all-hazards resilience, including PNT, are part of the standard NOFO language in the Department's discretionary programs. As such, the Committee believes it is equally important to ensure eligible recipients are informed of the eligible activities and therefore expects the Department to provide adequate notice to its recipients. The Committee remains concerned about the disruptions caused by interferences resulting from jamming and spoofing at and around our nation's air traffic system, as well as the threats to other critical infrastructure. A recent GAO Report [GAO-23-105335] entitled ``GPS Disruptions'' noted the vulnerabilities to unintentional and intentional interference from a variety of sources. The Committee is alarmed at the potential of such interference to effect transportation safety and directs the Department to continue working toward the deployment of backup technologies that will prevent interference and provide a resilient backup GPS capability for critical infrastructure. Advanced Research Projects Advancement for Infrastructure [ARPA-I].--The recommendation includes $14,750,000 to support ARPA-I as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 119 and the open research initiative as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 5506. The funding will advance and deploy technology products that have the potential to transform transportation systems and the way they are used with an emphasis on technology transfer and commercialization. NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $800,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 1,220,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 800,000,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This program provides grants and credit assistance to State and local governments, transit agencies, or a collaboration of such entities for capital investments in surface transportation infrastructure that will have a significant impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, or a region. Eligible projects include highways and bridges, public transportation, freight and passenger rail, and port infrastructure. The Department awards grants on a competitive basis; however, the Department must ensure an equitable geographic distribution of funds and an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural communities and within the timeframes outlined in the bill. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommendation includes $800,000,000 for grants and credit assistance for investment in significant transportation projects, which is equal to the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and $420,000,000 less than the budget request. The national infrastructure investments program, now known as the rebuilding american infrastructure with sustainability and equity [RAISE] program, has become integral to improving safety and mobility in communities throughout the country for more than a decade. The outcome-oriented selection criteria that includes state of good repair, economic competitiveness, quality of life, environmental sustainability, safety, innovation, and partnership nurtures stronger applications and results in successful multimodal projects. Given the importance of infrastructure reuse projects for transportation, economic development, emissions reduction, and recreation, the Committee encourages the Department to consider supporting infrastructure reuse projects. Geographic Distribution.--The Committee continues to believe that our Federal infrastructure programs must benefit communities across the country. The Committee continues to require the Secretary to award grants and credit assistance in a manner that ensures an equitable geographic distribution of funds and an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural communities. Improving Construction Project Delivery.--The Committee believes that completing transportation infrastructure projects punctually and responsibly is a key step toward improving our nation's infrastructure system to better facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. The Committee is aware that integrated project delivery [IPD] is a construction delivery method that integrates project teams, including agencies, engineers, builders, and owners, which can lead to significant project delivery efficiencies. The Committee encourages the Secretary to incorporate IPD options in implementing and administering funding made available by the IIJA. When considering RAISE applications, the Committee encourages the Secretary, to the extent appropriate, to consider awarding at least one grant which proposes employing the IPD method. Mega Project Eligibility.--The Committee directs the Secretary of Transportation to interpret eligibility for public transportation projects under 49 U.S.C. 6701(d)(1)(E) to include new multi-modal projects where the addition of public transportation project components provide a significant improvement to the mobility benefits for users of highways or intercity passenger rail. Mega Grants.--The Committee recognizes that inland ports are an important element in the international supply chain, increasing intermodal capacity and efficiencies in the movement of global commerce from ships to major transportation networks for distribution. Benefits include reduced congestion at marine terminals and on the Nation's highways, lower costs of moving cargo, environmental and safety benefits, economic development in underserved or rural areas, as well as consolidation of import/export centers. Within the advance appropriations for this program, the Committee encourages the Secretary to consider mega grant applications that include the development of coastal and inland ports that provide supply chain improvements and reduce supply chain disruption. NATIONAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AND INNOVATIVE FINANCE BUREAU Appropriations, 2023.................................... $8,850,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 10,550,000 Committee Recommendation................................ 9,558,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau [Bureau] administers the Department's surface transportation innovative finance programs as authorized by 49 U.S.C. 116 and technical as authorized by section 21205 of Public Law 117-58. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $9,558,000 for the Bureau, which is $992,000 less than the budget request and $708,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level to accommodate adjustments to base. Selection Process for Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highway Projects Program [INFRA] Grants.--The Committee is aware of the GAO report entitled ``Discretionary Transportation Grants: DOT Should Take Actions to Improve the Selection of Freight and Highway Projects'' [GAO-18-38] specifically related to the documentation of INFRA grant decisions, as well as the most recent report entitled ``Discretionary Transportation Grants: DOT Should Clarify Application Requirements and Oversight Activities'' [GAO-22- 104532]. The Committee appreciates the Department's efforts to notify unsuccessful applicants within 60 days of announcing awards and to provide more feedback to such applicants. Moving forward, the Committee directs the Department to fully implement the recommendation included in the most recent GAO report. Coordination with Joint Office of Energy and Transportation.--The Committee directs the Bureau to coordinate with the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation to leverage private sector engineering, operational, and financial support for commercial depot deployment of low- or no-emission port drayage and long-haul trucks along commercial and trade corridors. Transit-Oriented Development.--The GAO has recommended that the Bureau should better document its rationale for financing decisions in order to evaluate the pilot program allowing for transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act [TIFIA] and railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing [RRIF] loans to be used for transit-oriented development. The Committee directs the agency to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the status of the implementation of these recommendations which will be valuable in providing certainty to project development and determining how additional improvements can be made to facilitate affordable housing development along transit corridors. RURAL AND TRIBAL INFRASTRUCTURE ADVANCEMENT Appropriations, 2023.................................................... Budget estimate, 2024\\*\\................................................ Committee recommendation\\*\\............................. $25,000,000 \\*\\The IIJA provides $2,000,000 in contract authority for this program for fiscal year 2024. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The rural and Tribal infrastructure advancement program authorized by section 21205 of Public Law 117-58 allows the Build America Bureau to provide financial, technical, and legal assistance to evaluate and support potential transportation projects reasonably expected to be eligible for Federal funding or financing. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommendation includes $25,000,000 for the rural and Tribal infrastructure advancement program. The recommended funding level is $25,000,000 more than the budget request and $25,000,000 more than the level provided in fiscal year 2023. This program funds activities that are similar to those funded in the fiscal year 2023 enacted bill under the thriving communities initiative heading, which provides funding for technical assistance throughout the full project lifecycle to areas of persistent poverty and disadvantaged communities, the majority of which are located in rural areas. Section 21205 of the Public Law 117-58 separately authorized a rural and Tribal assistance infrastructure advancement pilot program to provide financial, technical, and legal assistance to rural communities, federally recognized Indian Tribes, and the Department of Hawaiian Homelands. Both programs encourage the development and dissemination of best practices, research, modeling and cost-benefit analysis to aid in the development of applications for Federal funding and financial assistance. Given that the thriving communities program has received $50,000,000 over the past two fiscal year and has $28,000,000 in carryover balances, the Committee is directing resources for the authorized IIJA activities that have a targeted focus on the needs of Native Americans, Native Hawaiians, Native Alaskans, and rural communities. Tribes, specifically, are twice as likely to live in poverty compared to the rest of the Nation and face the most significant capacity constraints to access Federal assistance for which there is overwhelming need. RAILROAD REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT FINANCING PROGRAM PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing [RRIF] program was established by Public Law 105-178 to provide direct loans and loan guarantees to State and local governments, Government-sponsored entities, and railroads. Credit assistance under the program may be used for rehabilitating or developing rail equipment and facilities. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The bill authorizes the Secretary to issue direct loans and loan guarantees pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 224. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT CAPITAL Appropriations, 2023.................................... $5,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 5,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 5,000,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The financial management capital program is a multi-year business transformation initiative to streamline and standardize the financial systems and business processes across the Department. The initiative includes upgrading and enhancing the commercial software used for DOT's financial systems, improving the cost and performance data provided to managers, and instituting new accounting standards and mandates. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee is recommending $5,000,000 for the Secretary's financial management capital initiative, which is equal to the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and equal to the budget request, in order to increase data quality, ensure compliance with financial standards and reporting, continue DATA Act compliance, and provide oversight of DOT's risk and controls. CYBER SECURITY INITIATIVES Appropriations, 2023.................................... $48,100,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 49,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 49,000,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The cyber security initiative is an effort to close performance gaps in the Department's cyber security. The initiative includes support for essential program enhancements, infrastructure improvements, and contractual resources to enhance the security of the Department's computer network and reduce the risk of security breaches. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommendation includes $49,000,000 to support the Secretary's cyber security initiative, which is $900,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and equal to the budget request. OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriations, 2023.................................... $14,800,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 28,595,000 Committee recommendation................................ 18,228,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of Civil Rights is responsible for advising the Secretary on civil rights and equal employment opportunity matters, formulating civil rights policies and procedures for the operating administrations, investigating claims that small businesses were denied certification or improperly certified as disadvantaged business enterprises, overseeing the Department's conduct of its civil rights responsibilities, and making final determinations on civil rights complaints. In addition, the office is responsible for enforcing laws and regulations which prohibit discrimination in federally operated and federally assisted transportation programs. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends a funding level of $18,228,000 for the Office of Civil Rights. The recommendation is $3,428,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level and $10,367,000 less than the budget request. The increase in resources will be used to accommodate adjustments to base. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $36,543,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 25,017,000 Committee recommendation................................ 24,069,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Office of the Secretary performs those research activities and studies which can more effectively or appropriately be conducted at the departmental level. This research effort supports the planning, research, and development activities needed to assist the Secretary in the formulation of national transportation policies. The program is carried out primarily through contracts with other Federal agencies, educational institutions, nonprofit research organizations, and private firms. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $24,069,000 for transportation planning, research, and development, which is $948,000 less than the budget request and $12,474,000 less than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. Within this funding level, the Committee recommendation also includes $3,443,000 to accommodate congressionally directed spending [CDS] for eligible projects. The Committee directs the OST to provide funding for those projects listed in the table at the end of this report in the corresponding amounts. The Committee further directs that the specific funding allocated for CDS shall not diminish or prejudice any application or geographic region to receive other discretionary grants or loans. Autonomous Vehicle Research in Rural Communities.--The Committee continues to believe that autonomous vehicles have the potential to enhance roadway safety and increase mobility options for all Americans, but have additional challenges to overcome in order to bring these benefits to rural Americans. Therefore, the Committee is concerned by the Department's delays in awarding the $10,000,000 appropriated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117-103) and the additional $15,000,000 directed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328). Should the previously appropriated funds not be awarded to the higher education consortia as intended by Congress within 90 days of enactment of this act, the Department is directed to brief the Committee on its plan to adhere to prior congressional intent for these funds. WORKING CAPITAL FUND (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Limitation, 2023........................................ $505,285,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................................... Committee recommendation................................ 522,165,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The working capital fund [WCF] provides technical and administrative services to the Department's operating administrations and other Federal entities. The services are centrally performed in the interest of economy and efficiency, are funded through negotiated agreements with the Department's operating administrations and other Federal customers, and are billed on a fee-for-service basis to the maximum extent possible. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends a limitation of $522,165,000 on activities financed through the WCF. The recommended limit is $16,880,000 more than the limit enacted for fiscal year 2023. As in past years, the bill specifies that the limitation on the WCF shall apply only to the Department and not to services provided for other entities. The Committee directs services to be provided on a competitive basis to the maximum extent possible. The Committee reminds the Department that in fiscal year 2023 the Committee only approved the migration of commodity IT to the WCF and permission to expand activities to human capital and IT activities was not approved. The Committee again directs the Department to only sustain the migration of commodity IT to the WCF and permission to expand activities for human capital and IT activities are denied. SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS UTILIZATION AND OUTREACH Appropriations, 2023.................................... $5,132,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 7,314,000 Committee recommendation................................ 5,330,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This appropriation provides contractual support to assist small, women-owned, Native American, and other disadvantaged business firms in securing contracts and subcontracts for transportation-related projects that involve Federal spending. Separate funding is provided for these activities since this program provides grants and contract assistance that serve Department-wide goals and not just OST purposes. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends $5,330,000, which is $198,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level, and $1,984,000 less than the budget request. PAYMENTS TO AIR CARRIERS (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $354,827,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 348,554,000 Committee recommendation................................ 348,554,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This appropriation provides funding for the essential air service [EAS] program, which was created to continue air service to communities that had received federally mandated air service prior to deregulation of commercial aviation in 1978. The program currently provides subsidies to air carriers serving small communities that meet certain criteria. The Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] collects user fees that cover the air traffic control services the agency provides to aircraft that neither take off from, nor land in, the United States. These fees are commonly referred to as ``overflight fees'' and the receipts from the fees are used to help finance the EAS program. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appropriations Mandatory Total ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appropriations, 2023...................................... $354,827,000 $134,132,000 $488,959,000 Budget estimate, 2024..................................... 348,554,000 154,410,530 502,964,530 Committee recommendation.................................. 348,554,000 154,410,530 502,964,530 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Committee recommends an appropriation of $348,554,000 for the EAS program. This appropriation would be in addition to an estimated $154,410,530 from overflight fees collected by the FAA, allowing the Department to support a total program level for EAS of $502,964,530. The Committee's recommendation for the appropriation is equal to the budget request and $6,273,000 less than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. Status of Funds.--The Department is directed to provide the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations quarterly updates on overflight fee collections and program costs to ensure the continued success of the EAS program. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING RESCISSIONS) (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Section 101 prohibits funds available to the Department of Transportation from being obligated for the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to approve assessments or reimbursable agreements pertaining to funds appropriated to the operating administrations, except for activities underway on the date of enactment of this act, unless such assessments have completed the normal reprogramming process for congressional notification. Section 102 requires the Secretary of Transportation to post on the Internet a schedule of all council on credit and finance meetings, agendas, and meeting minutes. Section 103 allows the Department of Transportation working capital fund to provide payments in advance to vendors for the Federal transit pass fringe benefit program, and to provide full or partial payments to, and to accept reimbursements from, Federal agencies for transit benefit distribution services. Section 104 allows the Department of Transportation's working capital fund to use certain recoveries from the transit benefit program to improve the administration of that program. Section 105 requires the approval from the Assistant Secretary for Administration for retention or senior executive bonuses for all employees. Section 106 requires the Department of Transportation's working capital fund to use certain transfer equipment into the working capital fund and collect replacement reserve for the equipment equal to the useful life and estimated replacement cost of the equipment. Section 107 requires congressional notification before the Department provides credit assistance under the TIFIA program. Section 108 allows the Secretary to transfer and consolidate administrative resources for certain programs. Section 109 allows funding provided for national infrastructure investments to be used to address cost increases for certain projects. Section 109A rescinds previous appropriations. Section 109B modifies the amount of funding reserved for planning grants under the safe streets and roads for all program. Federal Aviation Administration PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for the safe movement of civil aviation and the evolution of a national system of airports. The Federal Government's regulatory role in civil aviation began with the creation of an Aeronautics Branch within the Department of Commerce pursuant to the Air Commerce Act of 1926 (Public Law 69-254). This act instructed the agency to foster air commerce; designate and establish airways; establish, operate, and maintain aids to navigation; arrange for research and development to improve such aids; issue airworthiness certificates for aircraft and major aircraft components; and investigate civil aviation accidents. In the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 (Public Law 75-706), these activities were transferred to a new, independent agency named the Civil Aeronautics Authority. Congress streamlined regulatory oversight in 1957 with the creation of two separate agencies, the Federal Aviation Agency and the Civil Aeronautics Board. When DOT began its operations in 1967, the Federal Aviation Agency was renamed the FAA and became one of several modal administrations within DOT. The Civil Aeronautics Board was later phased out with enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-504), and ceased to exist in 1984. Responsibility for the investigation of civil aviation accidents was given to the National Transportation Safety Board in 1967. FAA's mission expanded in 1995 with the transfer of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation from the Office of the Secretary, and decreased in December 2001 with the transfer of civil aviation security activities to the Transportation Security Administration. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The total recommended funding level for the FAA for fiscal year 2024 amounts to $20,278,761,000, including new budget authority and a limitation on the obligation of contract authority. The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendations and advance appropriations provided by the IIJA for fiscal year 2024: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- General Fund Advance Committee Appropriations recommendation Total in IIJA ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operations................................................ ................ $12,740,627,000 $12,740,627,000 Facilities and equipment.................................. $1,000,000,000 3,429,000,000 4,429,000,000 Research, engineering, and development.................... ................ 260,000,000 260,000,000 Grants-in-aid to airports (obligation limitation)......... ................ 3,350,000,000 3,350,000,000 Grants-in-aid to airports (general fund).................. ................ 500,728,000 500,728,000 Airport infrastructure grants............................. 3,000,000,000 ................ 3,000,000,000 Airport terminal grants................................... 1,000,000,000 ................ 1,000,000,000 Sec. 119F Rescission of funds............................. ................ -1,594,000 -1,594,000 ----------------------------------------------------- Total............................................... 5,000,000,000 20,278,761,000 25,278,761,000 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OPERATIONS (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $11,915,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 12,740,627,000 Committee recommendation................................ 12,740,627,000 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION This appropriation provides funds for the operation, maintenance, communications, and logistical support of the air traffic control and air navigation systems. It also covers administrative and managerial costs for the FAA's regulatory, international, commercial space, medical, research, engineering, and development programs, as well as policy oversight and agency management functions. The Operations appropriation includes the following major activities: --the Air Traffic Organization, which operates, on a 24-hour daily basis, the national air traffic system, including the establishment and maintenance of a national system of aids to navigation, the development and distribution of aeronautical charts and the administration of acquisition, and research and development programs; --the regulation and certification activities, including establishment and surveillance of civil air regulations to ensure safety and development of standards, rules and regulations governing the physical fitness of airmen, as well as the administration of an aviation medical research program; --the Office of Commercial Space Transportation; and --headquarters and support offices. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends a total of $12,740,627,000 for FAA Operations. This funding level is equal to the budget request, and $825,627,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. As in past years, the FAA is directed to report immediately to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations in the event resources are insufficient to operate a safe and effective air traffic control system. The following table summarizes the Committee's recommendation in comparison to the budget estimate and the fiscal year 2023 enacted level: FAA OPERATIONS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal year-- ------------------------------------ Committee 2023 enacted 2024 estimate recommendation ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Air traffic organization.................................. $8,812,537,000 ................ $9,444,828,000 Aviation safety........................................... 1,630,794,000 ................ 1,745,532,000 Commercial space transportation........................... 37,854,000 ................ 42,018,000 Finance and management.................................... 918,049,000 ................ 949,376,000 NextGen operations and planning........................... 65,581,000 ................ 70,097,000 Security and hazardous materials safety................... 152,509,000 ................ 163,951,000 Staff offices............................................. 297,676,000 ................ 324,825,000 ----------------------------------------------------- Total............................................... 11,915,000,000 12,740,627,000 12,740,627,000 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Funding Level.--The increase of $825,627,000 will allow the FAA to address ongoing challenges with air traffic controller staffing, aircraft certification improvements, new entrants in the national airspace system [NAS], and improving the efficiency and responsiveness of the agency, and consist of the following: --$617,348,000 for adjustments to base; --$93,646,000 for the air traffic controller hiring surge in fiscal year 2024, which will allow the FAA to bring in 1,800 new air traffic controllers and increase/expedite the training capacity at the air traffic control training academy; --$50,000,000 for telecommunications infrastructure sustainment to update outdated legacy communications equipment that is no longer supported by telecommunications carriers; --$25,000,000 for NAS maintenance and sustainment, which will help improve the reliability and stability of critical systems needed for air traffic management, such as the notice to air missions [NOTAM] system; --$16,210,000 and 53 FTP to address aircraft certification reform legislation requirements, such as the safety hotline and whistleblower complaints and a safety culture assessment; --$7,918,000 and 72 FTP to strengthen aviation safety oversight, including efforts to help reduce the backlog of operator certifications and increased requirement associated with accident investigations; --$2,125,000 and 20 FTP to improve hazardous materials transportation safety oversight; --$3,444,000 and 2 FTP to enhance sustainability at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center [MMAC] and the Tech Center; --$4,050,000 and 30 FTP to for the technical operations division of the air traffic organization [ATO]; and --$1,710,000 and 12 FTP for flight standards services of the office of aviation safety [AVS]. Staffing Levels.--The Committee directs the FAA to provide quarterly staffing updates, including hiring and separations, by program office for all positions funded by this act. Controller Hiring Surge.--The Committee applauds the FAA's ongoing controller hiring surge in order to meet the shortfall in air traffic controller staffing due to restrictions to travel and training during COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions at the air traffic controller training academy and air traffic control [ATC] facilities for 2 years severely limited the number of new controllers and training for new or transferred controllers, and required existing controllers to undergo refresher training on a more frequent basis. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on a quarterly basis on: (1) the status of hiring new controllers; (2) actual staffing levels, including hiring and separation levels, at all ATC facilities; and (3) flight delays at each ATC facility by category. The Committee appreciates the FAA's efforts to incorporate both the current staffing standard and the collaborative resource workgroup [CRWG] targets in the most recent controller workforce plan [CWP]. While there are significant differences in the assumptions behind the two methodologies, the Committee notes that the hiring targets over the next 5 years are the same. In that time, the FAA should continue its work to resolve the differences in methodologies, accounting for all relevant factors and taking into consideration the input from all relevant offices within the FAA including the ATO and the Office of Finance and Management. The CWP should continue to be submitted solely by the Administrator of the FAA. The Committee notes that in response to Office of Inspector General [OIG] recommendation in Report AV2023035 related to implementing a new labor distribution system, the FAA has already begun implementing the air traffic operations management systems [ATOMS] that will track controller timekeeping and various work assignments. The Committee directs the FAA to provide quarterly updates to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its progress in implementing ATOMS and make the Committees aware of any challenges that may impede the deployment of this system throughout the NAS by the end of calendar year 2024. Runway Incursions.--The Committee is concerned with the increased number of runway incursion incidents occurring throughout the Nation. While the Committee applauds the FAA's efforts to mitigate these incidents through educational outreach, training, marking, lighting, and new technology, the Committee believes that more can be done to increase safety and reduce runway incursion incidents. Therefore, the Committee directs the Chief Operating Officer of the FAA to provide monthly briefings to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on: (1) the status and progress of the runway incursion mitigation program; (2) the number of runway incursion incident totals, including the severity of the incursions; and (3) the process the FAA is using to address each runway incursion. Air Traffic Control Privatization.--The United States has the largest, safest, most efficient, and most complex air traffic control system in the world, and the FAA should remain a global leader with a singular and unified mission of safety. To that end, the Committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA's air traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corporation. The Committee is aware that if the nation's air traffic control system had been privatized during the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to other air navigation service providers in Canada and the European Union, the United States would have faced severe funding shortfalls. These shortfalls would have likely led to controller layoffs and greater risks to flight safety, and a slower recovery after the end of the pandemic, thus leading to more flight delays and price increases for consumers. Contract Towers.--The Committee recommendation provides not less than $194,000,000 for the contract tower program, including the cost-share contract towers. The Committee directs the FAA to continue to operate all contract towers currently in the program, including the contract tower cost-share program, as well as to expeditiously add qualified eligible airports. The Committee directs the FAA to expedite the applications for cost-benefit ratio studies upon receipt of all applications to the contract tower program, including from Pinal Airpark, and to take into account all relevant operations activities, including military and commercial operations, as permissible under current law. The Committee also directs the FAA to provide flexibility to contract towers at small-hub airports with unique terrain and winter weather challenges so they include a minimum of two controllers during all regularly scheduled commercial flights, where permissible under current law. The Committee is aware of concerns about the FAA's efforts to realign and expand the number of FAA contract tower service areas. The Committee expects the FAA to respond to inquiries from Congress about the rationale for this proposal, its impact on controllers, and the impact on the risk to the NAS as a result of this change. Further, the Committee also expects the FAA to respond to all Congressional inquiries about this matter within 30 days of enactment of this act. The Committee directs the FAA to provide a briefing to the House and Senate Appropriations Committee on the FAA's plans regarding the realignment within 45 days of enactment of this act. FAA Technical Operations Workforce.--The Committee reiterates its support for the FAA to develop a workforce plan for the technical operations service unit, as required by House Report 117-402. Mitigating Radar Gaps for High-Traffic Airports.--The Committee is aware of concerns with the level of air traffic services in certain mountain west airports where fire management-related air traffic contributes to airspace congestion. The FAA shall identify airports where inadequate radar coverage is limiting airport capacity for commercial, military, and fire management-related air traffic, and increase staffing and/or provide terminal radar approach control facility [TRACON] services at such airports to better meet broad community needs, if justified. FAA Public Hearing.--The Committee notes that the proposal to modify the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military operating areas has been withdrawn. However, the Committee remains concerned with any potential proposals to modify these military operating areas and encourages the FAA to work with its partner agencies by holding a public hearing with representatives from the relevant Federal agencies in western Maine if any such proposal is issued. The Committee recognizes that the Air National Guard, as the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (Public Law 91-190) process, has previously sought to meet the minimum legal requirements for public participation and comment in past proposals. Should any similar proposal be issued, the Committee directs the FAA to report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to the issuance of a record of decision regarding any modification of the Condor 1 and Condor 2 military operations areas that includes a summary of any public meeting and hearing and a list of the comments, questions, and responses presented at these meetings and hearings. Special Use Airspace.--The Committee directs the FAA to continue its efforts to improve airspace sharing with the Department of Defense [DoD] for special use. Aeronautical Mobile Communications Services [AMCS].--The AMCS program provides the FAA voice communications over oceanic airspace. The program primarily uses high frequency radio channels, but the FAA should evaluate whether satellite voice communications would be a cost-effective way to minimize operational gaps when high frequency service is unavailable. Human Intervention Motivation Study [HIMS] and Flight Attendant Drug and Alcohol Program [FADAP].--The Committee recognizes the effectiveness of HIMS and FADAP in mitigating drug and alcohol abuse through a peer identification and intervention program and expects the FAA to continue to prioritize these programs. Air Tour Operators in Hawaii.--The Committee appreciates the FAA's work to establish air tour operator management plans for national parks in Hawaii, but remains concerned with excessive noise in areas outside of national parks. The FAA should work with the State of Hawaii and all relevant stakeholders to address noise concerns related to air tour operators, and to work with the authorizing committees to develop legislation to address these concerns. Air Tour and Sport Parachuting Safety.--The Committee directs the FAA to convene an aviation rulemaking committee [ARC] to review and develop findings and recommendations relating to improving the operations of air tour operators. The Committee also directs the FAA to convene an ARC to review and develop findings and recommendations to improve sport parachute operations. The FAA shall submit a report based on the findings of the ARCs to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations not later than 20 months after the date of enactment of this act. Radio Altimeters and 5G.--The Committee directs the FAA to continue altimeter research and support voluntary forums with industry partners in order to establish new performance standards that consider the future of 5G, 6G, 7G, and beyond. The FAA should brief the House and Senate Committees on any research and development activities that the FAA can conduct and/or sponsor to prepare for 6G, 7G, and beyond. Alaska Safety Initiative.--The Committee is aware of concerns with the lack of progress with the FAA Alaska safety initiative [FAASI]. Not less than 90 days after enactment of this act, the FAA shall brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on the agency's accomplishments in support of the FAASI initiative as outlined in the FAASI roadmap. Safety.--Funding made available in this act to study commercial operations should prioritize the safety effects relative to two-person flights, except those related to unmanned aerial vehicles. Advanced Air Mobility [AAM].--The Committee supports the FAA's updated blueprint for airspace and procedure changes to accommodate future air taxis and other AAM operations. The FAA has committed to completing the proposed special Federal aviation requirement which will enable commercial operations and pilot licensing by December 31, 2024. Unmanned Aircraft Systems [UAS] Test Sites.--The Committee recommendation includes $6,000,000 for providing matching funds to commercial entities that contract with an FAA-designated UAS test site to demonstrate or validate technologies that the FAA considers essential to the safe integration of UAS into the NAS. The Committee encourages the FAA to use up to $3,000,000 for virtual testing at the test sites. UAS Airworthiness Approvals.--The Committee directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on its progress toward processing airworthiness approvals of low- risk small UAS through declarative certification. Small UAS Procurement.--For any acquisition of small UAS using funds provided by the FAA, including those to Federal grant recipients, the FAA should require certification of review of the Department of Homeland Security industry alert, and any subsequent and relevant UAS guidance, and completion of a risk assessment that considers the proposed use of the foreign-made UAS. The Committee also directs the FAA to regularly brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, on an as-needed basis, on any security risks or challenges identified by either agency from any small UAS or UAS components. Know Before You Fly.--The Committee supports FAA's ``Know Before You Fly'' public-private partnership to improve the safety of UAS operations. Aircraft Certification.--The Committee recommendation includes not less than $351,373,000 for aircraft certification service. The Committee expects the FAA to continue its efforts on training safety oversight personnel involved in the certification process through opportunities for knowledge- sharing, including demonstration projects, between the FAA and industry, and access to the FAA training for the FAA employees and other individuals performing oversight work on behalf of the agency. Flight Standards Certification Services Oversight Process.--The Committee is aware of concerns with delays in the processing of applications and the resulting backlog contained in the flight standards certification services oversight process [CSOP] list, including applications for part 135, AAM, and other new entrants. The Committee recommendation includes $1,710,000 to increase staffing up to 12 FTP above the request for the general aviation safety assurance and air carrier safety assurance offices to help reduce the certification service oversight process backlog. The FAA should consider using its existing authority for temporary and term appointment positions to recruit experienced engineers, for a limited time duration if necessary, in order to expand the FAA's technical expertise. These individuals should have a specialized background in a line or field that is concerned with the safety certification of aircraft and other airborne objects and systems, including: aerospace engineering, aerospace physiology, aeronautical engineering, airworthiness engineering, electrical engineering, human factors engineering, software engineering, or systems engineering. The FAA should also continue to address initial certifications, work with industry to improve initial screening and the standardization of applications, and streamline the exemptions process to reduce the number of aviation safety inspectors necessary for UAS work. The Committee directs the FAA to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of this act on: (1) the staffing allocated to part 135 and other CSOP listed applications; (2) the total backlog of applications; (3) the time it takes to process applications; and (4) steps the FAA will take to provide a more timely process. Independent Study on a Future State on Type Certification Processes.--The Committee directs the FAA to enter into an agreement with an appropriate Federally-funded research and development center, or other independent nonprofit organizations with aviation policy expertise, to conduct a review and study to foster continuous safety improvements in the certification system by identifying the digital and modeling requirements, and the necessary policy, procedures, and vision, to improve the safety of aircraft certification activities in the future. Safety Management System [SMS].--The Committee applauds the FAA for issuing a proposed rulemaking expanding the use of SMS for aircraft manufacturers and charter, commuter, and air tour operators. The Committee directs the FAA to ensure all necessary plans, procedures, and staffing resources necessary to oversee SMS for these new entities are in place prior to implementation. The Committee also directs the FAA to issue a rulemaking requiring each person holding a certificate under 14 CFR 119, and authorized to conduct operations in accordance with provisions of 14 CFR 135, to implement an SMS, as appropriate for their operations. Regulatory Process Improvements.--The Committee is aware of concerns about delays in the FAA's regulatory process for issues such as cybersecurity, pilot training standards, and transport airplane propulsion safety certification. The FAA should conduct a comprehensive review of its regulatory processes to improve the timeliness, transparency, and performance accountability in the promulgation of rules, regulatory policies, and guidance to the extent that such improvements would not reduce or deter safety. The FAA shall report its findings to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 120 days of the enactment of this act. Commercial Space Operations.--The Committee has provided substantial staffing increases over the last few years and expects the FAA to prioritize these resources for its human spaceflight activities, to the extent permissible under current law, in order to be ready for the end of the ``learning period'' under 51 U.S.C. 50905. The FAA should also continue integration of commercial space operations in the NAS and reduce the resulting delays to aircraft, including by working with commercial space operators to provide data to the space data integrator. The Committee is also aware of concerns with the FAA's approval of SpaceX's starship/super heavy launch from the Boca Chica spaceport on April 20, 2023. The Committee directs the FAA to provide a briefing on the mishap report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations prior to any future starship/super heavy launches. Notifications.--The Committee is disappointed with the FAA's lack of notifications to the Committee regarding significant disruptions in the FAA's ATC operations that have led to flight delays and cancellations. While the Committee understands the FAA's need to fully assess the issues at hand prior to notifying the Committee, far too often, the Committee receives notifications from second or third-hand sources instead of directly from the FAA. The Committee directs the FAA to provide prompt notifications to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations when significant disruptions occur in the NAS within one day of such an occurrence and to respond to congressional inquiries as quickly as possible. Human Resources.--The Committee supports the FAA's efforts to leverage commercially available technology to improve its human resources service delivery platform. Minority Serving Institutions [MSI] Intern Program.--The Committee continues to support the MSI intern program, and provides not less than $5,000,000 to continue this initiative. The FAA should prioritize interns from MSIs located in geographically isolated communities. In its ongoing efforts to increase the diversity of FAA staff, the FAA should strive to increase the number of interns hired in a full-time capacity after graduation and to work with MSI interns to identify barriers and challenges for individuals from underrepresented and underserved communities to working at the FAA. NAS Resource Needs.--The rapid expansion of new entrants into the NAS has implications for all other users of the NAS, as well as the FAA's ability to manage resources necessary to maintain the safest most efficient aerospace system in the world. Within 90 days of enactment of this act, the FAA is directed to initiate a study that compares its total current resources and the current resources dedicated to new entrants to the range of resources required to meet the needs of both existing users and new entrants for each fiscal year through fiscal year 2033. The study should also assess the extent to which existing and new users contribute appropriately and fairly to the resources needed to manage their use of the national airspace through 2033. In carrying out this study, the FAA shall consult with aerospace industry stakeholders, including representatives from air carriers, general aviation, commercial UAS interests, recreational drone system interests, commercial space industry, and any other representatives the FAA deems necessary. The FAA shall submit the results of the study to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 18 months after the initiation of this study. Women in Aviation Advisory Board.--In March 2022, the Women in Aviation Advisory Board [WIAAB], as authorized under section 612 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, issued recommendations and strategies to address the significant underrepresentation of women in aviation. The WIAAB identified several challenges that are specific to the commercial airline industry, given the physical constraints and scheduling needs related to working in a commercial aircraft. The Committee therefore directs the GAO to undertake a more detailed analysis of such barriers that are specific to the commercial airline industry and examine the extent to which such barriers could be addressed by the commercial airline industry and FAA without further regulations. Veterans' Pilot Training Program.--The Committee remains supportive of the veterans pilot training program, under which flight training schools received funding through cooperative agreements with the FAA to provide training and education to veterans to become commercial airline pilots. The Committee acknowledges the program's importance as a tool in helping to address the Nation's current commercial pilot shortage, and directs that any remaining funds previously appropriated for the program remain available for use in fiscal year 2024. The Committee further directs the FAA to provide the assessment required in the fiscal year 2022 joint explanatory statement, including recommendations on how to provide effective pilot training to veterans, within 120 days of enactment of this act. FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND) (INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS) Appropriations, 2023.................................... $2,945,000,000 Budget estimate, 2024................................... 3,462,000,000 Committee recommendation................................ 3,429,000,000 Note: The Committee recommendation includes $469,000,000 in emergency- designated funding. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The facilities and equipment appropriation provides funding for modernizing and improving air traffic control and airway facilities, equipment, and systems. The appropriation also finances major capital investments required by other agency programs, experimental research and development facilities, and other improvements to enhance the safety and capacity of the NAS. The program aims to keep pace with the increasing demands of aeronautical activity and remain in accordance with the FAA comprehensive 5-year capital investment plan. COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,429,000,000 for the facilities and equipment account of the FAA, of which $469,000,000 is designated as emergency spending. The recommended level is $33,000,000 less than the budget request and $484,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 enacted level. The Committee expects the FAA to make sound investment decisions and report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on any major cost overruns or delays. The Committee recommendation includes $15,000,000 for CDS. The Committee directs the FAA to provide funding for the projects listed in the table at the end of this report in the corresponding amounts. The Committee further directs that the specific funding allocated in the table below shall not diminish or prejudice the application of a specific airport or geographic region to receive discretionary grants or multi-year letters of intent. Major Capital Programs.--FAA major capital programs, including NextGen, continue to improve the safety, security, and reliability of FAA's critical air traffic control systems, as well as improving airline operations and reducing passenger delays by improving aircraft separation, improving flight planning, and optimizing re-routing of flights in real time. These programs incurred over $270,000,000 in cost escalations as a result of necessary restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the FAA has successfully completed many projects over the last year, it has also had to reduce the scope of several projects, which could reduce the long-term benefits of NextGen investments. To keep the Committee apprised of such changes, the FAA is directed to notify the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 3 business days of the joint resources council making any final investment decisions, establishing a baseline for previously approved projects, or making acquisition program baseline changes that alter program performance, cost or schedule baseline.
