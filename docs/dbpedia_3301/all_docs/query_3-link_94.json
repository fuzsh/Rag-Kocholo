        "text": "As Arkansas’ most active senator in stock trading, we started to wonder about John Boozman’s net worth. Therefore, in the following piece, we’ll go through his assets and investments, as well as all other relevant financial information.\n\nWho is John Boozman?\n\nJohn Boozman is a Republican senator representing Arkansas. He assumed office in January 2011, succeeding Senator Blanche Lincoln. Before his tenure in the Senate, Boozman served in the US House of Representatives from 2001 to 2011. He is known for his advocacy for veterans, agriculture, and healthcare reform.\n\nJohn Boozman’s net worth\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, Senator John Boozman had an estimated net worth of $2,361,025 in 2017. However, based on his 2023 financial disclosure report, he’s actually worth anywhere between $717,102 and $4,633,997.\n\nDisclaimer: Estimating a lawmaker’s net worth is challenging because disclosure forms do not mandate exact values. Instead, lawmakers report the value of their assets and liabilities within specified ranges. While we strive to accurately estimate net worth from filings, disclosure rules have shortcomings. Personal residences, certain personal property, and federal retirement accounts are often not reported. Large assets can be listed in broad categories like “Over $1 million” or “Over $50 million,” potentially worth much more. Additionally, most Members of Congress earn $174,000 annually, but this isn’t required to be disclosed.\n\nHow did John Boozman make his money?\n\nHere’s a brief overview of John Boozman’s sources of income:\n\nOptometry practice: Boozman co-founded a successful optometry clinic with his brother in Rogers, Arkansas, which served as a primary income source before his political career;\n\nPolitical salary: As a member of Congress, Boozman earns a $174,000 annual salary;\n\nInvestments: Boozman has invested in various stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, generating additional income through dividends and capital gains.\n\nJohn Boozman’s assets\n\nAccording to his 2023 financial disclosure report, John Boozman’s assets total between $1.717,102 to $5,084,000, with liabilities ranging from $450,003 and $1 million. Out of all of his assets, the following stick out as most valuable:\n\nRental property and undeveloped land in Rogers, Arkansas, valued between $250,001 and $500,000;\n\nInvesco Short Term Treasury ETF, valued between $100,001 and $250,000;\n\niShares MSCI EAFE ETF mutual fund, valued between $100,001 and $250,000;\n\nGoldman Sachs Access Investment Grade Corporate Bo corporate stock, valued between $100,001 and $250,000;\n\nCMBS Ishares ETF mutual fund, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.\n\nWas John Boozman ever involved in insider trading?\n\nDespite being known as Arkansas’ most active senator in stock trading, no official documents or news reports indicate that John Boozman has engaged in insider trading. He seems to uphold the ethical standards required of his position as a US Senator.\n\nHow much is John Boozman worth?\n\nDespite his prominence in stock trading, Senator John Boozman is a long way from the wealthiest American politicians. His net worth is somewhere between $717,102 and $4,633,997, which puts him in the mid-tier group of senators based on their wealth. Either way, his public image is pretty clean, with no insider trading allegations to his name.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice. Investing is speculative. When investing, your capital is at risk.\n\nFAQs about John Boozman’s net worth\n\nHow much is John Boozman's net worth?\n\nAccording to his latest financial disclosure report, John Boozman’s net worth ranges from $717,102 to $4,633,997.\n\nWhat are the primary sources of John Boozman's wealth?\n\nBoozman’s wealth primarily comes from his optometry practice, political salary, and investments.\n\nIs John Boozman involved in insider trading?\n\nWhile Boozman’s active stock trading has raised eyebrows, there is no definitive proof of insider trading.
