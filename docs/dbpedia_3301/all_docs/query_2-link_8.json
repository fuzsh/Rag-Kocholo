        "text": "As the 2024 election year begins, an already divided Congress may well be struggling to reach consensus on crucial legislation while the Biden administration rushes to issue new federal regulations.\n\nThat’s the climate that NRECA’s Government Relations team likely faces as it advocates on behalf of electric cooperatives on Capitol Hill, at the White House and with federal agencies.\n\nIn a recent Q&A session, Louis Finkel, NRECA’s senior vice president of Government Relations, talked about how the association will work aggressively to ensure that new bills and regulations help not-for-profit co-ops continue to provide reliable, affordable electricity to their consumer-members.\n\nElectric co-ops have begun winning awards for millions of dollars from the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, thanks to provisions that NRECA helped secure in those bills. Do you expect the flow of funding to co-ops to continue in a big way this year?\n\nFinkel: First, the biggest issue before Congress this year is going to be funding the government, as it was last year. There is an ongoing tension between the Biden administration, Senate Democrats and House Republicans, with House Republicans wanting to cut funding in the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nAs we sit here in January, Congress is still working on funding the government for the current fiscal year and then will have to quickly turn to funding for the next fiscal year.\n\nIn that context, we continue to educate members of Congress about the value of new incentive programs designed to harden the grid and create greater resiliency in the face of a changing energy environment while looking for opportunities to solidify the reliable, affordable power that electric co-ops offer.\n\nGetting provisions that benefit co-ops into law was really important, but shaping the programs and the guidance that comes out of the federal agencies that implement them has been just as important.\n\nWe have been engaged with the agencies to make sure that misguided agency interpretation does not undermine these programs and that they are implemented in the way that Congress intended them to be.\n\nCongress is continuing to try to craft a new five-year Farm Bill that could include crucial funding for co-op infrastructure projects, rural economic development and broadband. What are the prospects for its passage this year? And what is NRECA doing to help shape Farm Bill programs that benefit co-ops and their members?\n\nFinkel: Congress extended the current Farm Bill through the end of the year, which bought them some breathing room. There are some broad differences of opinion between the two parties on a range of programs—most of which don’t directly impact our co-ops.\n\nOur intent is to work with members on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers to reinforce the important role that the Rural Utilities Service programs play as a crucial resource for infrastructure and system improvements and routine maintenance—all with a focus of keeping the lights on. Healthy, strong RUS programs are an important resource for co-op communities throughout the country.\n\nWhat are some of NRECA’s other legislative priorities for 2024?\n\nFinkel: Though we always have policy matters that we raise, oftentimes our message is driven by the congressional agenda, which could be really narrow this year.\n\nWe will look for ways to continue to address supply chain difficulties to ensure co-ops can get transformers in a reasonable time frame, and we’ll push Congress to use some government resources to further alleviate supply chain woes.\n\nCongress is set to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act, and in light of the recent developments in the Pacific Northwest and the administration’s backroom deal to undermine dams on the lower Snake River, we’ll be aggressively engaged to make sure there are no provisions in the bill to breach those dams.\n\nWe’ll continue to push for legislation to expedite permitting and alleviate the endless litigation that stifles the construction of infrastructure as well as advocate for transmission policies that allocate costs to those that benefit the most.\n\nAnd related to broadband, there continues to be noise about changing the nature of the pole attachment exemptions for electric cooperatives, mostly by other participants in the broadband industry. We continue to educate members of Congress about the importance of the Federal Communications Commission exemptions for our members and how our members and our service territories are different.\n\nWith the recently installed Democratic majority at the FCC, we’ve seen a lot of proposals come forward, most notably one on net neutrality. NRECA is asking the FCC for targeted compliance exemptions for electric co-ops in any new net neutrality rules. Co-ops support net neutrality and treat all their broadband consumers equally, but excessive, onerous regulation could divert crucial investment away from the communities they serve.\n\nNRECA has strongly opposed the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed power plant rule as a threat to co-ops’ ability to provide reliable, affordable power. What can we expect to see on this front in 2024?\n\nFinkel: We expect to see a final rule in the spring, and we’ll continue to oppose the rule, which may very well result in litigation. We’ll continue to push back on the EPA’s overreach, which oversteps its statutory authority and hampers co-ops’ ability to provide reliable, affordable power.\n\nWe’ll oppose this kind of overreach by any federal agency, whether it’s the EPA or any other agency. We’ll continue to aggressively raise concerns where necessary and embrace proposals where they make sense.\n\nThis is obviously a huge election year with both the presidential and congressional elections. Do the elections complicate NRECA’s efforts to achieve its legislative and regulatory priorities?\n\nFinkel: I don’t think it complicates our ability to achieve anything, but it complicates our ability to advance an agenda. With a divided Congress, it is already really hard to legislate, and even more so in an election year.\n\nOn the regulatory side, new proposals are unlikely to get finalized within a year. So, most new regulations that get put forward now are just markers for the president to tell voters what is important to his administration.\n\nIn that context, we will continue to oppose shortsighted policies and continue to support policies, both in Congress and in regulatory proposals, that serve the interests of our members and their consumer-members.\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer for NRECA.\n\nElectric cooperatives will soon have access to $9.7 billion in grants and loans to buy or build new clean energy systems, Rural Utilities Service Administrator Andy Berke told co-op leaders Monday at NRECA’s Legislative Conference.\n\nBerke said the U.S. Department of Agriculture is poised to roll out the program in the coming days. It was approved last August when Congress passed the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“This is huge,” Berke told 2,000-plus conference attendees. “We have to make sure that you can make the energy transition that is coming without breaking the bank.”\n\nThe voluntary program will provide funding for a wide range of projects, including renewable energy, carbon capture, battery energy storage systems, nuclear power and improvements to generation and transmission efficiency. Interested co-ops will be eligible to receive an award for up to 25% of their project costs, with a maximum of $970 million going to any one co-op.\n\n“This is an enormous opportunity,” he said. “We don’t know when it is going to happen again. Please take this opportunity. It’s available because of your advocacy.”\n\nBerke drew applause when he announced that RUS, beginning this week, is shrinking the size of environmental review paperwork that co-ops have to fill out when they apply for loans from a minimum of 70 pages down to just four pages.\n\nHe said he listened to concerns about the process from co-op leaders at NRECA’s PowerXchange in Nashville, Tennessee, in March and made the change based on their feedback. He said he hopes it will expedite co-op construction projects.\n\n“We know that a project today is better—and more importantly cheaper—than a project tomorrow,” Berke said.\n\nSen. Boozman Honored With Distinguished Service Award\n\nAlso on Monday, Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., received NRECA’s Distinguished Service Award, which honors members of Congress who make essential contributions to electric co-ops and the communities they serve.\n\n“Sen. John Boozman, an electric cooperative member, has been a friend to the Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas throughout his years in public service,” said Buddy Hasten, president and CEO of the Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas. “Sen. Boozman’s dedication as an advocate for Arkansans clearly aligns with the mission of our state’s electric cooperatives.”\n\nBoozman, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, said he is hopeful that Congress will be able to pass one of NRECA’s top legislative priorities this year: a new five-year Farm Bill that includes full funding for rural economic development and broadband programs. The current Farm Bill expires Oct. 1.\n\n“Farm Bills aren’t about Democrats or Republicans,” he said. “They’re bipartisan. I think we’ve got a great chance of getting it done.”\n\nDOE Official: ‘Reliability Is the Foundation’\n\nGene Rodrigues, assistant secretary of energy for electricity, said he shares NRECA’s goal of ensuring that the electric grid “remains reliable, resilient and affordable for all Americans.” The importance of grid reliability is the main message that co-op leaders are taking to Capitol Hill and federal agencies this week.\n\n“We are all in agreement with every single one of you in this room that reliability is the foundation of everything we want to do,” he said.\n\nUnfortunately, the American people and many of their elected officials “take it for granted” that the lights will always come on when they flip the switch, Rodrigues said.\n\n“That’s a problem,” he said, urging co-op leaders to “advocate, educate and collaborate” to sound the alarm about the potential risks to reliability.\n\n“If it’s taken for granted, then we won’t have the champions we need to keep electricity reliable and affordable over time. … Make sure they understand the absolute necessity of investing in a 21st century power grid for the American people.”\n\nSpanberger Lauds Co-op Role in Closing Digital Divide\n\n“Rural communities feed and fuel the rest of Virginia and our nation,” Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., told conference participants. “Unfortunately, at times it seems like rural America can get left out of the conversations on infrastructure and economic development.”\n\nShe said that electric co-ops serve 40% of her constituents and are helping to bring essential broadband service to rural communities that for-profit internet providers ignore.\n\n“I’m so grateful to your [NRECA] members for working to bring broadband,” Spanberger said.\n\nThe bipartisan infrastructure law’s $65 billion in broadband funding will help close the digital divide and “strengthen our rural economy for the next generation of Americans,” she said.\n\nFreshman House Members Push for Bipartisan Solutions\n\nFreshman Reps. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., and Don Davis, D-N.C., were both elected in 2022 and represent electric cooperative members in rural communities. They told co-op leaders that they are frustrated by the fierce partisan divide in Congress and hope to work together as members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.\n\n“There’s too much extremism, and it comes from both sides—let’s be honest about it,” Davis said.\n\nCiscomani, who described his district’s voters as one-third Republican, one-third Democratic and one-third independent, said he has set up an advisory committee back home made up of local leaders with diverse political ideologies.\n\n“There is an appetite in our country for people to work together to find solutions,” he said.\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer for NRECA.\n\nMore Coverage From Legislative Conference:\n\nWhat Electric Co-ops Need From Policymakers to Close the Digital Divide\n\nNRECA CEO: Reliable Electricity Is Main Focus of Legislative Conference\n\nRep. Bob Latta: Rural Connectivity ‘Is Everybody’s Issue’\n\nNRECA is diving into 2023 with a long list of policy goals that range from shaping a new five-year Farm Bill to helping electric cooperatives prepare for catastrophic wildfires.\n\n“All of our priorities are aimed at helping our members maintain reliable and affordable power and giving them tools to help meet the challenges of the future,” said Hill Thomas, NRECA’s vice president of legislative affairs.\n\nThomas and Ashley Slater, NRECA’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said their teams will work closely together to help pass legislation that benefits co-ops and then ensure that those new laws are implemented as intended.\n\nCo-ops saw major policy wins in 2021 and 2022 with passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law and key co-op provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, and NRECA will continue its efforts this year to ensure that members benefit fully from the programs created by those laws.\n\nIn a recent Q&A session, Thomas and Slater outlined what’s ahead for co-op policy goals.\n\nWhat are NRECA’s top regulatory priorities for 2023?\n\nSlater: I have a long list!\n\n• Implementing NRECA’s two priority provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act: direct-pay energy tax credits and the $9.7 billion U.S. Department of Agriculture program to assist co-ops with the energy transition.\n\n• Shaping agency funding opportunity announcements for co-op programs included in the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law. Those programs include rural broadband, electric vehicle programs to build a network of chargers, grid resiliency and modernization, physical security and cybersecurity, and clean energy programs.\n\n• Protecting co-op access to an affordable, reliable power supply as the Environmental Protection Agency looks to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants.\n\n• Ensuring sound transmission policy as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission contemplates first-in-a-decade transmission reform.\n\n• Ensuring that the Department of Energy uses its presidentially directed Defense Production Act authority appropriately to ease supply chain shortages.\n\n• Ensuring that any new cybersecurity or physical security reporting requirements by the Department of Homeland Security are optimized for co-ops to enhance their security posture and improve their ability to protect against, detect and respond to—or recover from—threats to the electric system.\n\n• Modernizing environmental permitting. The existing processes take too long, are too expensive and are an impediment to co-ops’ ability to meet future energy needs. They need to be modernized to give more certainty in the energy transition.\n\n• Working with co-ops to prepare for and respond to catastrophic wildfires. Co-ops that want to do vegetation management are running into inconsistent guidance from the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. We need to work with the agencies to streamline the process.\n\n• Working with co-ops to ensure that the broadband maps produced by the Federal Communications Commission are done correctly to provide the best picture of where broadband is and isn’t available across the country. The FCC has released a pre-production draft of its latest broadband maps.\n\nWhat are NRECA’s top legislative priorities for 2023?\n\nThomas: For the first couple of months, our top priority will be holding Co-op 101 sessions to meet the 81 new members of Congress and educate them about electric cooperatives. Beyond that, we want to make sure Congress is engaged when they need to be to ensure the legislation that has already passed is implemented the right way to benefit co-ops and their members.\n\nA new five-year Farm Bill is being written by Congress that will affect electric co-ops and all of rural America, so that will be a priority. And we support a bipartisan permitting modernization conversation. Also, we’re going to continue to face supply chain problems, and we’re going to continue to work to solve that.\n\nWe’ve already had co-op leaders come and testify to Congress about the upcoming Farm Bill. How will it affect electric co-ops specifically?\n\nThomas: The Farm Bill is the only piece of legislation that Congress does that is uniquely and specifically aimed at rural America. It is designed to support rural America and we share that goal. It’s important for us to talk about our priorities, including many of the USDA programs that we use such as rural development financing, the home energy efficiency program and clean energy deployment financing. These programs can be reauthorized in the new Farm Bill, and we want to make sure they’re operating as effectively as possible and are good to go for the next five years.\n\nThe other big conversation will be about broadband. There’s an opportunity to rewrite and improve the USDA ReConnect broadband program, which has provided opportunities to many of our members but could also operate more efficiently. It’s a fairly new program that has received lots of money, but some of our members haven’t been able to get access to it because it’s just too bureaucratic. We need to streamline the program so we can serve the communities that need it most.\n\nIs the environment in the Biden administration and in Congress, with divided government, conducive to accomplishing NRECA’s goals?\n\nThomas: On the congressional side, with the House majority and the president being from different parties, it is going to be a tough environment for big, game-changing legislation. But we have a good reputation for being able to bridge gaps and find partnerships and bipartisanship. I think there will be lots of opportunities for us to engage in these important conversations.\n\nSlater: We recognize that resource planning decisions are unique to the needs of the specific co-op and the communities they serve. The administration understands that if they want their policies to have a real impact, they have to reach rural America. And they can’t get there without electric co-ops.\n\nThat presents a real opportunity for our members who want to participate. In order to push an energy transition across the country, if you want to get there, you have to go through electric co-ops. If there’s no uptake, you’re not going to be successful in getting these dollars utilized…To the extent that we can be a conduit, that’s our edge.\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer for NRECA.\n\nElectric cooperatives throughout the nation are poised to reap the benefits in 2022 of legislation passed by Congress last year that includes co-op priorities pushed by NRECA and its members.\n\nThe biggest success was passage of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act, which will give a major boost to co-ops by providing billions for broadband deployment, electric vehicle charging networks, electric transmission, energy storage, carbon capture and other clean energy technologies.\n\nIn 2022, NRECA will continue to advocate for direct federal incentives for co-ops to develop new energy resources and technologies, including renewable energy, battery storage projects, nuclear energy facilities and carbon capture, said Hill Thomas, vice president of legislative affairs.\n\nNRECA will also push for passage of the Flexible Financing for Rural America Act. The bill could save co-ops more than $10 billion in interest payments by allowing them to reprice loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service at lower interest rates.\n\nHere is Thomas’s perspective on this year’s legislative session:\n\nWhat do you consider NRECA’s major legislative successes for 2021?\n\nThomas: We did a good job in a Congress that was stalled by COVID-19 in a world where most offices are still virtual and lawmakers are still singularly focused on just one or two items. I think we adapted well to that environment. Looking back, our biggest successes would be carving out what could be once-in-a-generation opportunities for co-ops in the infrastructure bill and, even though it’s not done, positioning ourselves well to defend against bad outcomes in the budget reconciliation bill while creating some new opportunities for financing for clean energy technologies.\n\nWhat impact will the American Rescue Plan Act, which Congress passed last March to provide COVID-19 relief, have this year on co-ops?\n\nThomas: One of the most important policy lessons learned during the pandemic was the lack of broadband access in rural America. The American Rescue Plan sent a lot of money to states that can be used for broadband deployment in rural areas. One of the lasting policy opportunities to come from that bill is that many co-ops will be able to use the money to bring broadband to rural communities.\n\nThere seems to be enormous interest among co-ops in applying for funds created by the infrastructure bill for broadband deployment, electric vehicle infrastructure, clean energy technologies and more. What are you hearing from co-ops about their intentions, and how is NRECA helping them apply for this money?\n\nThomas: There’s a lot of interest in the opportunities created by the infrastructure bill, whether that’s broadband, grid resiliency, cybersecurity, electric vehicles or clean energy. In a lot of ways, the process that created these programs is just the beginning. There will be regulatory processes of various lengths that will provide details about what applications for those funds might look like.\n\nOur goal is to provide as much information to our members as possible so they can make good decisions about what opportunities match up with their strategic priorities. NRECA has developed an infrastructure hub on cooperative.com that provides detailed information to our members as these programs and funding opportunities emerge. And we will continue to partner with our members to make sure they get as much value out of these opportunities as possible.\n\nLast year, the House passed a sweeping budget reconciliation bill that included direct-pay incentives for co-ops to develop clean energy technologies and a $10 billion voluntary program for co-ops interested in transitioning away from fossil fuels. What do you see happening with those two legislative priorities this year?\n\nThomas: I’d start by saying that our efforts on the budget reconciliation bill were both offensive and defensive, including playing defense against potentially overly aggressive and burdensome clean energy targets. We think we did a good job in defending against those unreasonable mandates. At the same time, there are several good opportunities for co-ops included in the House-passed bill and in ongoing Senate negotiations, including direct-pay incentives for energy technology and the $10 billion in clean energy transition funds.\n\nAs we begin 2022, we are in much the same place, with uncertainty remaining about the size and the shape of a bill that can pass the Senate. The Senate has committed to try to continue to find compromise on a bill that can pass. We continue to be well-positioned to defend against any bad policy mandates while protecting meaningful opportunities for co-ops.\n\nIf the Senate can’t reach a compromise, do you see other legislative vehicles for passing these co-op priorities?\n\nThomas: If the budget reconciliation process fades, we will look for other opportunities to push these priorities. These are the types of tools that meet co-ops where they are and give them voluntary incentives to implement their unique strategic plans. So, we’ll be looking for ways to advocate for these legislative priorities individually if the broader package fails.\n\nThere probably will be fewer opportunities for legislative work to get done as the election approaches, but we think these are strong priorities and we’re going to keep looking for other vehicles.\n\nThe Flexible Financing for Rural America Act was reintroduced last year and has attracted a great many co-sponsors in Congress. Do you see a path forward for this RUS repricing bill to pass this year?\n\nThomas: RUS repricing remains a top priority for us. It enjoys strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, so we think there’s still an opportunity to move it this year. It continues to remain an important opportunity for our members.\n\nWhat are NRECA’s other legislative priorities for 2022?\n\nThomas: Broadband continues to be an important and ongoing issue among our members and an urgent need across rural America. It’s one of the few bipartisan issues in Congress, and it’s an issue that we will continue to focus on. Even though it doesn’t expire until 2023, the Farm Bill reauthorization process will start in earnest this year, and we will be doing the prework to make sure that the bill is as supportive of electric co-ops as it can be.\n\nAnother issue that we continue to watch closely is supply chain problems, so the advocacy team will continue to work with Congress and the administration to develop solutions to speed the availability of equipment for our members.\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer for NRECA.\n\nAs a new school year gets under way amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, electric cooperatives across the country are implementing broadband internet solutions to keep students connected to virtual classrooms even in the most remote and impoverished communities.\n\nOrcas Power & Light Cooperative serves about 12,000 members spread across dozens of small villages that dot 20 islands in Washington state’s San Juan County. Only four of those islands have public ferry access. When the coronavirus forced school closures last spring, OPALCO and its internet subsidiary, Rock Island Communications, learned from the superintendent that what students needed most was fast, reliable internet at home.\n\nRock Island staff managed to quickly deploy fixed wireless or hotspot solutions to deliver internet access specifically to students’ school-provided learning devices. Now, every schoolkid in OPALCO’s service territory, no matter their location or family income, can learn in a virtual classroom.\n\n“Access Education was realized, designed and executed to 114 homes in just a little more than two weeks,” said Suzanne Olson, the co-op’s public relations administrator.\n\nRock Island provided free connections for “a seamless solution for kids and the schools” and plans to continue the Access Education program through the 2020-21 school year, she said.\n\nSchool officials hailed the co-op internet provider as “an invaluable educational partner.”\n\n“Now all district students and staff are connected in virtual classrooms with online resources to continue their teaching and learning,” San Juan School District Superintendent Kari McVeigh wrote to Rock Island.\n\nKit Carson Electric Cooperative shares a similar goal of connecting every student in its high-poverty service areas to broadband internet. Since the start of the pandemic, the Taos, New Mexico-based co-op has provided free broadband connections to more than 250 students in low-income households and offered them discounted monthly rates.\n\nConnecting the remaining 1,300 students who lack broadband internet will cost about $2.6 million, said CEO Luis Reyes.\n\nThe co-op set up 23 permanent public hotspots for free Wi-Fi across the rural communities and tribal lands it serves. But Reyes said distance learning for many students in the five school districts and two universities the co-op serves will require more.\n\n“Rural students without a broadband connection will not have the same opportunities or benefits as broadband-connected students,” he said.\n\nReyes recently testified on this issue before the New Mexico legislature, citing National Center for Education Statistics numbers that show “the digital divide disproportionately impacts students of color, those who are economically disadvantaged, and students in more rural and/or remote areas.”\n\n“The nationwide disruption of K-12 and higher education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing school building closures has led to a deepening of the digital divide,” Reyes told state lawmakers.\n\nHamilton, Alabama-based Tombigbee EC’s freedomFIBER is installing broadband for up to 2,000 low-income member households that received vouchers from the Alabama Broadband Connectivity for Students program. Republican Gov. Kay Ivey marked $100 million in federal CARES Act funds for the public-private partnership to provide internet access for qualifying K-12 students this fall. The vouchers will cover broadband internet access costs through the end of December.\n\n“We started our broadband project in 2017 to help our community, but we had to move fast to respond to new state and federal funding opportunities,” said Brenda Overton, CFO at the 9,000-member co-op. “We got all our bases covered. But this is what we live for—it is the cooperative spirit in action, because broadband has become an even more profound issue in the last six months with the pandemic.”\n\nLike Kit Carson, many co-ops across the country installed free Wi-Fi hotspots in convenient locations for students and parents at the pandemic’s start and continue to run them as the new school year gets under way.\n\nTipmont REMC, headquartered in Linden, Indiana, has built a dozen hotspots across its service territory through its broadband subsidiary, Wintek. Burgaw, North Carolina-based Four County EMC set up access points at nine locations, including six schools. Young Harris, Georgia-based Blue Ridge Mountain EMC also offers connectivity in nine parking lots at churches, schools, a recreation center and store across its rugged territory.\n\nBarry Electric Cooperative’s free Wi-Fi at three high school parking lots comes with parental control software “to restrict the use of the hotspot to keep kids safe,” said Laura Holycross, member services coordinator for the Cassville, Missouri-based co-op.\n\nThe co-op’s broadband subsidiary, goBEC Fiber Network, is also working with low-income referrals from a local community agency that received CARES Act funds for broadband. Holycross said the co-op will then provide internet service at a discounted rate to help make the funds go further.\n\nSome co-ops are helping turn school buses idled by the pandemic into smart buses with mobile Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nSouthern Rivers Energy, based in Barnesville, Georgia, awarded four school systems $15,690 in Operation Round Up grants to equip up to 16 buses with Wi-Fi. Multiple internet providers can use the equipment to provide hotspots.\n\n“As a parent working from home and home-schooling two children with poor internet service, I felt like this could be a huge benefit for our communities,” said Erin Cook, SRE’s director of marketing and member services.\n\nSome co-ops have found other ways to fill their communities’ education needs amid the ongoing pandemic.\n\nFlint Energies is bridging the digital divide by donating 200 Chromebooks, worth $90,000, to six rural school districts in its 17-county territory in Georgia. The Reynolds-based co-op and its charitable foundation held an emergency meeting in August and agreed this donation would be a quick, effective way to help rural families.\n\n“We saw our rural students’ great need for technology and did what we could in short order to improve their access to online learning,” said Marian McLemore, vice president of cooperative communications. “Our Chromebook donation would not be possible without those Flint members who participate in our Operation Round Up® program. The small change they donate each month made this gift and so much more possible.”\n\nIn the western mountains of Virginia, BARC Electric Cooperative gave $6,000 to each of the three public school systems it serves. The Millboro-based co-op applied matching funds from CoBank’s Sharing Success program to make the $18,000 donation possible.\n\n“We are fortunate to have access to the CoBank program and even more fortunate to be in a financial position during this pandemic to be able to make these donations,” said Mike Keyser, CEO of BARC, whose broadband subsidiary BARC Connects also serves the schools.\n\n“As a cooperative that both serves the community and is composed of people raised in the community, there is no more valuable investment this organization can make than in supporting our schools.”\n\nConsolidated Cooperative, based in Mount Gilead, Ohio, was installing free Wi-Fi hotspots in the parking lots of the 10 school districts it serves with broadband internet when it got a different request: Could the co-op livestream a drive-up high school graduation?\n\nThe May ceremony for Centerburg High School’s class of 2020 would take place in its parking lot. Upholding state policy to control the spread of COVID-19, the graduates got out of their cars as their names were called and walked across a temporary stage to receive their diplomas before returning to their vehicles. Attendance was limited to one vehicle per graduate.\n\nPomp and circumstance were nowhere on Consolidated’s radar. Still, the co-op’s fiber installation crew flew into action when they got the call and ran temporary fiber out to the parking area, allowing friends and relatives to witness the ceremony safely from a distance.\n\n“This event deeply touched all of us at Consolidated,” said Jarred Davis, network supervisor. “The ability to bring at least a little normalcy to our community meant so much to our team.”\n\nHe said the pandemic has shown how co-ops can serve their communities in many ways, while also underscoring the need for broadband access throughout rural America.\n\nAlthough Consolidated’s fiber team is ready to assist with future livestream graduations, Davis said he hopes things are different by the end of this school year. “We’re optimistic that the Class of 2021 will have a more traditional experience, but if that’s not possible, you can bet Consolidated will be running fiber through the parking lot again if our community needs us.”\n\nCathy Cash is a staff writer at NRECA.\n\nAfter years of dealing with roller-coaster diesel prices, Inside Passage Electric Cooperative in southeast Alaska is investing in hydropower to lower rates for its 1,300 members and bring cleaner energy to the rural communities it serves.\n\nThe co-op’s latest project will turn an unused dam on the remote island village of Kake into a source of power for about 600 people, many of them Alaska Natives. It’s the second hydropower project undertaken by IPEC, which plans another two as it moves toward 70% renewable energy.\n\nBut the nearly $7 million in state and federal grants that are helping the Juneau-based co-op reach its goals could also strip the not-for-profit business of its tax-exempt status and thwart its effort to reduce rates.\n\nThat’s because a 2017 tax bill passed by Congress redefined government grants to co-ops as non-member income, making it difficult for co-ops to avoid going over the 15% limit on outside revenue to keep their tax-exempt status. If they must start paying taxes, many co-ops will be forced to raise electric rates—often in high-poverty communities that can least afford higher energy costs.\n\n“We’re trying to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce rates to our members,” said IPEC CEO Jodi Mitchell. “Now this tax issue is going to undo all the good we’ve tried to do. It’s very unfair that we’re being punished for trying to do the right thing. Congress has just got to fix it.”\n\nMitchell and leaders at the nation’s electric co-ops are urging lawmakers to vote before year’s end to pass the RURAL Act, a bipartisan bill that would allow co-ops to accept grants without risking their tax-exempt status. The legislation had 280 House co-sponsors and 45 in the Senate as of Nov. 12.\n\nCo-op leaders hope that IPEC’s situation, and the stories that follow, will shed light on the harmful impact of the tax law on rural residents:\n\nHurricane Recovery in Texas\n\nWhen Hurricane Harvey slammed into Texas with 130 mph winds and more than 20 inches of rainfall, it knocked out power to all 22,467 meters served by Victoria Electric Cooperative. With help from 300 employees of neighboring co-ops and contractors, the co-op restored electricity to 95% of its service area within 10 days. More than 630 poles and nearly 260 transformers had to be replaced.\n\nThe co-op’s recovery efforts after the 2017 storm were aided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provided more than $8 million in disaster relief this year. To qualify for those funds, the co-op had to spend about $890,000 of its own money and take out loans for about $420,000 more, costing members a total of about $1.3 million.\n\nBy accepting the FEMA grants to restore its system, Victoria EC is facing the loss of its tax-exempt status and a tax liability that could be as much as $850,000.\n\nAt its recent annual meeting, about 150 co-op members signed up to support the RURAL Act, said CEO Blaine Warzecha. But so far, Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz have not signed on as co-sponsors of the bill.\n\n“Without the FEMA grants, we’d still have had to repair the system,” Warzecha said. “We would already have had to have a rate increase, no doubt about it … Now we may have to have one anyway to pay for our taxes. Our members are going to end up footing the bill unless we get help from Congress.”\n\nBroadband Service in Tennessee\n\nForked Deer Electric Cooperative in Halls, Tennessee, was thrilled to learn in October that it was the first recipient in the nation of a rural broadband grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s new ReConnect program.\n\nBut the co-op’s joy faded when leaders realized that the $2.8 million grant might cost them their tax-exempt status.\n\n“We’re all excited, and then a week later I get a call from one of my colleagues asking me what we’re going to do about the tax issue,” said CEO Jeff Newman. “I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ When he told me, it was a real punch in the gut.”\n\nNewman said the co-op wants to use the federal grant to bring high-speed internet service to the part of its service area that is the most sparsely populated and the least connected. Now he is trying to figure out a way to draw down the grant money more slowly, so that it won’t push the co-op over the 15% limit for non-member revenue in any one year.\n\n“All of our members have these high hopes for broadband, and we don’t want to let them down,” he said. “A middle-aged woman came into our office the other day and cried because she can now do online schooling and change her lot in life. We’re realizing broadband has life-changing impacts for our members … We don’t need obstacles from the federal government.”\n\nBuilding a Stronger System in Oklahoma\n\nAfter a brutal ice storm in 2017, it took 30 days for Northwestern Electric Cooperative in Woodward, Oklahoma, to restore power, with 400 lineworkers from throughout the region working around the clock. More than 6,000 poles and 100 miles of wire had gone down in the storm.\n\nThe FEMA aid that the co-op received to help restore power came before the tax law change, so it didn’t affect the co-op’s tax-exempt status. But the co-op is now at risk because this year it began receiving nearly $54 million in FEMA grants for a $72 million, three-year project to strengthen its system so that it will be better able to withstand future storms. CEO Tyson Littau said the grants will put the co-op over the 15% non-member limit.\n\n“Do we rebuild and try to strengthen our distribution system and pay the taxes, or do we delay the mitigation project that would improve 1,200 miles of line throughout our territory?” he said. “I think we have a responsibility to the membership to improve the system for the future.”\n\nSnowstorm Recovery in Oregon\n\nWhen a record-breaking snowstorm hit Oregon in late February, Lane Electric Cooperative in Eugene sustained $5.6 million in damage to a system that serves 10,000 members.\n\nWith the help of FEMA grants, the co-op will rebuild its system and make it more resilient against future threats, said CEO Debi Wilson. But the co-op could also lose its tax-exempt status in the process, she said. Lane is currently working with tax advisers to see what tax liability it might face and whether a rate hike will be needed, Wilson said.\n\n“We need things to go back to the way they were before the 2017 tax law,” she said. “Right now, FEMA funds aren’t functioning the way they were intended. They are supposed to take the burden off of our members, not add to their burden.”\n\nRead more coverage of the RURAL Act:\n\nCo-op Voices, Part 1: How Losing Tax-Exempt Status Would Hurt Rural Residents\n\nRURAL Act: Why Popular, Bipartisan Legislation Can Face Hurdles in Congress\n\nQ&A: Senate’s Lead RURAL Act Sponsors Discuss Their Strategy for Passage\n\nAs Majority of House Signs On to RURAL Act, Lead Sponsors Press for Vote\n\nQ&A: RURAL Act’s Lead House Sponsors Say Co-op Voices Are Key to Bill’s Success\n\nCo-op CEO to Congress: Help Expand Rural Broadband by Passing RURAL Act\n\nNRECA CEO Jim Matheson: ‘If We All Stand Up,’ Co-ops Can Save Tax-Exempt Status\n\nCo-op Advocacy Needed to Move Vital Tax Fix in Congress\n\nBipartisan Bill Would Protect Co-ops From Losing Tax-Exempt Status\n\nListen to a recent podcast on the RURAL Act:\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer at NRECA.\n\nMore than a third of senators have now signed on to support the RURAL Act, a bipartisan bill by Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Tina Smith, D-Minn., to protect electric cooperatives’ tax-exempt status.\n\nAs of Monday, 38 senators were co-sponsoring the bill, which would allow not-for-profit co-ops to accept government grants for disaster relief, broadband service and other priorities without losing their tax-exempt status.\n\nIn the House, 269 members have signed on to the bill, led by Reps. Terri Sewell, D-Ala., and Adrian Smith, R-Neb.\n\nThe RURAL Act would fix a problem created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which began counting grants as non-member income for co-ops. Under federal law, co-ops must receive at least 85% of their income from consumer-members to remain tax-exempt. Before the law took effect in 2018, grants were considered capital and did not affect co-ops’ tax status.\n\nUnless Congress passes the RURAL Act, co-ops may be forced to pay the new tax by raising rates for their consumer-members, many of whom live in high-poverty areas.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last week that the bill would cost the U.S. Treasury $3.4 million a year in lost taxes for 10 years—a tiny amount for a federal budget that is nearly $5 trillion.\n\nPortman and Smith talked about their strategy for passing the bill and explained why it’s important to rural Americans.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges/obstacles to getting the bill passed in the Senate this year?\n\nPortman: To be honest, the biggest challenge we face is whether the Senate will be able to work with the House to pass any significant tax legislation this year. This is especially true for any legislation building upon the monumental tax reform of 2017. While the RURAL Act actually goes beyond their pre-tax reform treatment by simplifying the treatment of governmental grants and assistance received by co-ops, this bipartisan legislation is still getting caught up in the partisan politics of tax reform. Ultimately, I am optimistic that the strong bipartisan nature of this legislation will help clear the path through the partisan discussions around tax policy in Congress today.\n\nSmith: Passing legislation in today’s polarized political climate is never easy. There are several bills to correct problems with the 2017 Republican tax bill that have been caught up in negotiations over other tax measures. However, I’m hopeful that we can now make meaningful progress toward an agreement that addresses the problems with the 2017 tax bill and some of the corrections and other middle-class tax relief provisions that should have been included in that bill.\n\nThe House now has more than a majority of its members signed on as co-sponsors of the bill. If the House can pass the RURAL Act with a strong bipartisan majority, would that help you convince a majority of senators to take up and pass the bill?\n\nPortman: We also have significant support in the Senate…more than a third of the Senate. But yes, a strong bipartisan majority, and hopefully an even stronger bipartisan vote in the House, would provide a clear signal to my colleagues that the RURAL Act is a common-sense fix to the tax code.\n\nSmith: We have a strong bipartisan coalition in the Senate and with stakeholders across the nation. We’re pushing to get this across the finish line as soon as we can, but to do so, senators will need to continue to hear from their constituents about this bill.\n\nWhat do you see as the best strategy to pass it?\n\nPortman: As much as I think that the widespread bipartisan support in both the House and Senate make a strong argument for passing the RURAL Act on a standalone basis, Congress very rarely passes standalone tax bills. It’s most likely that this bill becomes part of a broader tax package that rides along with a must-pass piece of legislation, hopefully in the coming months.\n\nSmith: I believe that the most important thing to getting this bill passed is to make sure that senators and members of Congress hear from their constituents about why this issue is so important. When you make your voices heard, you have an incredible ability to effect the kinds of changes you seek.\n\nWhat do you think are the most effective arguments you have when you’re asking other senators to co-sponsor the bill or when you’re asking leadership to bring it to the floor?\n\nPortman: There are few issues that unite my colleagues more than expanding access to rural broadband. No matter what part of the country you’re from, there’s a good chance that parts of your state wouldn’t have access to high-speed, reliable internet without the services provided by tax-exempt rural co-ops. Any legislation that ensures co-ops will continue expanding these broadband services should be an easy bill for my Senate colleagues to support.\n\nSmith: Most of my colleagues I speak with understand just how vital rural electric cooperatives are to rural communities…For many decades, this tax-exempt business model has ensured that hundreds of Minnesota rural communities—and thousands across the country—have affordable, reliable power and the significant economic benefits that come with it. It wasn’t the intent of the 2017 tax law change to jeopardize rural electric cooperatives’ tax-exempt status.\n\nHow will your rural constituents be hurt if their co-ops lose their tax-exempt status?\n\nPortman: The Ohio electric co-ops provide electricity and broadband services to more than 380,000 of my constituents, covering 77 of Ohio’s 88 counties and some of the most rural areas of the state. If just one of these co-ops were to lose their tax-exempt status, the Ohioans they serve would almost immediately feel the squeeze as the co-op would be forced to raise their rates in order to afford the new tax payments. For a lot of families and individuals in the rural areas of my state, even a small increase in the cost of necessities such as electricity and broadband could make a world of difference in their financial security. We can’t let that happen, which is why Congress should pass the RURAL Act as soon as possible.\n\nSmith: Many cooperatives in Minnesota and across the country are in danger of being forced to choose between keeping their tax exemptions and accepting an important grant to clean up a disaster or to expand broadband services. The resulting costs to cooperatives could force up electricity rates for customers and make cooperatives think twice about accepting grants that could help their communities.\n\nHow can co-op leaders and members in your state and throughout the nation best help you pass the legislation?\n\nPortman: As far as Ohio goes, I’m very pleased with the grassroots effort by the Ohio co-ops to encourage the delegation to support the bill. Last I checked, there’s only one more House member out of 16 that hasn’t co-sponsored, and I’m hopeful [Sen. Sherrod] Brown will support the bill as well. Even outside of Ohio, I have to say I’m very impressed by the grassroots effort across the board…\n\nBut you shouldn’t take that as a sign to let up, either. Whether it’s in Ohio or any other state, it is crucial that everyone continue to reach out to their representative or senator to talk about the importance of the bill and the potential consequences of a co-op losing its tax-exempt status. With your help, I’m confident that we can continue growing support for the bill and have a chance at passing it this year.\n\nSmith: You should make your voices heard by your representatives in Washington. Senators and members of Congress care deeply about what’s important to their constituents, and I’m hopeful that you will be able to play a key role in getting them to accept a tax package that addresses this problem and the other key tax priorities that Congress needs to address. As we come to the end of the tax year, I plan to make it clear to my colleagues that we can’t continue to allow our tax laws to hinder our nation’s electric cooperatives from doing the important work of powering our rural communities and supporting jobs and economic development. I’ll be pressing [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell to reach a fair agreement that allows this bill and other important tax priorities to be addressed.\n\nRead more coverage of the RURAL Act:\n\nRURAL Act: Why Popular, Bipartisan Legislation Can Face Hurdles in Congress\n\nAs Majority of House Signs On to RURAL Act, Lead Sponsors Press for Vote\n\nCo-op Voices, Part 1: How Losing Tax-Exempt Status Would Hurt Rural Residents\n\nCo-op Voices, Part 2: CEOs Discuss Impacts of Tax Law Glitch for Members\n\nQ&A: RURAL Act’s Lead House Sponsors Say Co-op Voices Are Key to Bill’s Success\n\nCo-op CEO to Congress: Help Expand Rural Broadband by Passing RURAL Act\n\nNRECA CEO Jim Matheson: ‘If We All Stand Up,’ Co-ops Can Save Tax-Exempt Status\n\nCo-op Advocacy Needed to Move Vital Tax Fix in Congress\n\nBipartisan Bill Would Protect Co-ops From Losing Tax-Exempt Status\n\nListen to a recent podcast on the RURAL Act:\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer at NRECA.\n\nWhen Congress returns next month from its August recess, there are only about 40 legislative days left this year in the House and about 50 in the Senate. That leaves a small window of opportunity for progress on the most pressing issues for electric cooperatives.\n\nJohn Cassady, NRECA’s vice president of legislative affairs, gives an update on how co-op priorities have fared so far in 2019 and what’s next. The greatest urgency in this session of Congress is to try to push through two key bills: the SECURE Act, which would save co-ops more than $30 million a year in pension insurance premiums paid to the federal government, and the RURAL Act, which would protect co-ops from losing their tax-exempt status if they accept government funds, such as disaster relief or rural broadband grants.\n\nWhat would you say is the most important progress that NRECA lobbyists have made so far in this session of Congress?\n\n“We’ve made progress on key priorities, including progress on our top two legislative initiatives. The first is ensuring that the Senate follows the work of the House and finishes the job on the SECURE Act, which contains the language that provides relief from the high premiums the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. is charging our co-op pension plan. Our premium relief is tied up in a broader retirement package that has been approved by the House on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote.\n\n“Currently, the larger package is being held up by a few senators, not based on anything related to the substance of the issue that we care about. Nevertheless, it’s slowed the momentum from quick Senate action. Now, there is going to be a process on the Senate floor for the SECURE Act to move forward, and the hope is that the process will eventually lead to the Senate passing the bill and then getting it to the president’s desk this fall.\n\n“There are a lot of trapdoors throughout the process, and that’s why these things never come easy … but this issue has been a long time coming.”\n\nWhat about the other top legislative priority, the RURAL Act?\n\n“On the issue of the RURAL Act, we’ve made a great deal of progress but are not quite as far along as the SECURE Act. This time last year, we were still doing a lot of the behind-the-scenes work on this issue: explaining to key members of Congress and their staff the impact of the issue, why it needed to be addressed, and lining up champions for our legislation. A lot of the blocking and tackling work had to be done.\n\n“Fast forward to now, where we sit favorably if you look at the fact that the RURAL Act now boasts over 90 bipartisan co-sponsors in the House and 18 bipartisan co-sponsors in the Senate. There’s a high degree of awareness of the issue, and there’s a recognition that our challenge was an unintended consequence of the 2017 tax law. There’s an appetite to get it done.\n\n“But we also face some obstacles. There are still some negative optics among some on the Hill who associate anything tax-related with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was handled in a very partisan manner that created a lot of bad partisan feelings. There are still some rough edges out there on Capitol Hill when tax policy is brought up. The challenge we have had, and what we’ve tried to maneuver around, is to avoid having the perception on the Hill that our issue is a purely partisan priority. We want to create a bipartisan recognition that our issue needs to be addressed on behalf of co-ops throughout the country and the rural communities they serve.”\n\nCo-ops are worried about losing their tax-exempt status if they take federal, state or local broadband grants or disaster relief grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Is this one of the issues you hear most about from co-ops?\n\n“Yes, we’re hearing concerns in certain sections of the co-op world. I know Florida co-ops are very engaged from a FEMA standpoint, as an example. Many co-ops are leading with the concern that if their co-ops are hit with a major storm and there’s a presidential disaster declaration and FEMA grants are dispersed, that having those resources that help us restore power would then negatively impact our tax-exempt status and generate a tax liability for our member co-ops. That is an issue that helps put a point on our advocacy.\n\n“The other issue is that some co-ops are working to help bridge the digital divide and leaning on grant dollars to put forward the initial capital investment. For example, there are a number of co-ops in Indiana looking to take advantage of the broadband grant program that the state has instituted. In doing so, they could potentially upset their tax-exempt status, which really runs counter to the goal of bringing broadband to rural areas. It’s a perverse outcome of public policy that our members would be in this position. They’re just trying to do the right thing, to bring solutions to their communities for broadband, and this unintended consequence has real impact on their ability to do so.”\n\nDo you think there will be a big infrastructure bill in this Congress that could include more broadband funds and grid modernization?\n\n“If you were to go through the halls of Congress, every member would say ‘infrastructure is a great idea. Democrats and Republicans should come together on infrastructure.’ But if you don’t have the right environment, it makes it challenging. There’s a high degree of tension between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration … and it doesn’t show any signs of letting up. So that doesn’t create a conducive atmosphere for bipartisan cooperation.\n\n“If I had to handicap the likelihood of a broad infrastructure package making its way through Congress, I would say it’s a low-probability proposition at this point.”\n\nHave you played more offense or more defense on co-op issues so far with this Congress?\n\n“We’re playing offense on the SECURE Act and the RURAL ACT. We played defense on a number of issues as well. A good example is the administration’s budget proposal to, once again, propose that the transmission assets of the Power Marketing Administrations be privatized. We had to play defense there and engage with policymakers on the Hill to ensure that that idea didn’t gain any footing.”\n\nErin Kelly is a staff writer at NRECA.\n\nLamar Paris is no stranger to winter’s treachery on the roads that wind through the mountains of North Georgia.\n\nHe’s been elected sole commissioner of Union County for the past 18 years, and among his unofficial duties have been frequent hazardous drives up nearby Blood Mountain to report, via his Facebook page, on road conditions through the highly traveled Neels Gap.\n\n“This is our main transportation artery out of Union County for 80% of all critical medical needs,” said Paris. “Anytime there was a bad snow or ice storm, I’d physically drive up the mountain to check the road conditions. I’ve done it for several years, often in the middle of the night. It’s dangerous for me [but] I felt it was something I always needed to do. I couldn’t ask anybody else to do it, so I’d do it myself.”\n\nNow, thanks to broadband internet access installed by Blue Ridge Mountain EMC and the time-saving work of an intrepid drone, the need for Paris’s pre-dawn ascents has disappeared.\n\n“It’s almost like a dream for me,” he said.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation installed a weather station with cameras on the mountaintop with internet connection through a distant cell tower. But when winter storms blew in—the most critical time to obtain weather data—the signal would frequently drop.\n\n“It was a nice amount of equipment, but we didn’t have a way to access it on a regular basis,” said Paris. “That’s why I went to see Jeremy Nelms.”\n\nNelms is the CEO of Blue Ridge Mountain EMC, which has offered fiber-to-the-home broadband to its members for more than 10 years. After hearing Paris’s weather-station concerns, Nelms offered to help connect the system to the co-op’s fiber network.\n\n“This link is necessary so the local government has connectivity to a weather station and cameras atop the mountain,” said Nelms. “Understanding winter weather conditions is critically important, because this passage is a main thoroughfare for citizens of Union County and its surrounding counties who travel south to get to work and to health care facilities in the Gainesville and north Atlanta areas.\n\n“The benefits of the project will show themselves during the first good snow, when people know they can or cannot go over that mountain. It could save lives.”\n\nThe co-op in late 2018 planned to extend 7,000 feet of fiber cable up the mountain. But the path to the top included a deep gorge and 100-foot-tall pine trees.\n\nKeeping the project on track and getting it finished before winter required an unconventional solution: drones.\n\n“Drone technology is starting to become a game-changer in the utility industry,” Nelms said. “From supporting line construction efforts to system inspection and storm restoration assistance, drones are just another arrow in the quiver of the utility worker of the future.”\n\nThe co-op based in Young Harris, Georgia, partnered with Southern Company Services to fly a drone from ridge top to ridge top carrying a pull line that would later be attached to fiber cable. Co-op crews climbed steep embankments to follow the drone, which used a mechanical release to drop the pull line and sometimes even flew low enough for the crew to grab it.\n\n“Without the drone, we would have been looking at weeks and not hours to complete this effort,” Nelms said.\n\nBRMEMC crew uses a drone to help install 7,000 feet of broadband fiber up to Blood Mountain along the Appalachian Trail. The broadband connection will enable a weather station to provide real-time information on conditions of a busy mountain pass.\n\nImproving Public Safety\n\nThe co-op connected the weather station on Dec. 13, 2018, after getting a permit from the Georgia DOT and approval from the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWith fiber service to the weather station, data and pictures will soon be able to be livestreamed during extreme weather conditions. Eventually, the goal is for any would-be mountain driver with an internet connection to be able to access the information as well.\n\nIt could even help some of the 2,000 hikers that transit the area every year. The weather station is adjacent to the popular Walasi-Yi Interpretive Center, the only man-made structure that the 2,175-mile Appalachian Trail passes through.\n\n“This fiber line will be incredible for the safety of this area,” said Paris. “Sometimes hikers don’t realize how tough it can be, or they can get caught in a snowstorm.”\n\nA reliable connection will be invaluable for mountain rescues, when timely communication by voice or data is critical, Paris added.\n\n“Having this quality signal will help emergency personnel get data to doctors before they even leave the scene.”\n\n‘A Historical Project’\n\nBlue Ridge Mountain EMC first offered internet access in its remote mountain territory way back in 2002. It began its fiber rollout in 2006.\n\n“Members were asking for it,” said Daniel Frizzell, the co-op’s director of engineering. “In our area, there is no opportunity for rail or air or interstate—it doesn’t exist up here. We had to find a way to jump-start growth, meet the [broadband] demands for education, medical and industry.”\n\nNow the co-op has 1,100 miles of fiber across its system bringing broadband to more than 7,800 members in the counties of Fannin, Union and Towns in Georgia and Cherokee and Clay in North Carolina.\n\n“When you are in a rural area like we are here, it is of critical importance to minimize any barrier to companies being successful,” said Erik Brinke, the co-op’s director of administrative service and external relations. “It makes a difference if we are able to mitigate one biggie—internet connectivity.”\n\nFor Paris, the co-op’s commitment means he can rest a little easier knowing his constituents have timely information about icy mountain road conditions.\n\n“I can’t tell you how much we appreciate the EMC taking interest in the project,” he said. “It is not mundane. It’s a historical project for this area.”\n\nA drone delivers pull line up the north Georgia Mountains and over a deep gorge to allow BRMEMC to build a broadband connection to a weather station on an Appalachian Trail peak.\n\nCathy Cash is a staff writer at NRECA.\n\nCurtis Wynn is President and CEO of Roanoke Electric Cooperative. His testimony was given before the House Committee on Agriculture on July 19, 2017.\n\nThank you, Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson, for inviting me to testify today. My name is Curtis Wynn. I am the President and CEO of Roanoke Electric Cooperative headquartered in Aulander, North Carolina. I am also Vice President of the Board of Directors for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Roanoke is a member-owned, not-for-profit, electric distribution cooperative serving around 14,000 residential, agricultural, commercial and industrial customers in northeastern North Carolina. Our system consists of over 2000 miles of line (about 7 members per mile) in 7 counties.\n\nWe serve some of the poorest, most rural parts of our state. But despite those challenges, we are doing some truly innovative work to improve the quality of life for our members. While our first priority is to deliver clean, safe, reliable, affordable electricity to our members, we have a calling to be more than just a poles, wires and electrons company. Our broader purpose is to provide the services and support that empower our communities to thrive. Rural electric cooperatives are much more than just electric utilities – we are the engines that drive economic opportunity across the heartland and to rural areas everywhere. I am proud of the role we play in these communities.\n\nMore than ever, whether you live in a rural area or in a city, we are all connected in this country. Rural areas, in particular, still grow most of the food, generate much of the power, and manufacture many of the goods that this country consumes. When rural areas suffer, the country as a whole suffers. That’s why the state of rural infrastructure should be of interest to all Members of Congress, no matter what type of district you represent.\n\nAmong our biggest challenges going forward are adapting to changes in consumer demand, accommodating an evolving generation mix, and protecting against cyber threats. I’m going to talk today about some investments that my co-op is making to modernize and meet those needs. I am aware that resources will be limited in the upcoming farm bill, but I believe a separate infrastructure package gives us a great opportunity to make further investments in these types of projects to ensure the success and stability of rural America in the 21st Century.\n\nRural Utilities Service (RUS)\n\nIn the early 1900’s, as urban areas began to electrify, rural areas lagged behind. Eventually, farmers and ranchers in remote areas took the initiative to form electric cooperatives and did it themselves. In the past 80 years, a lot has changed, but the same fundamental challenges still exist – how to affordably connect those few customers in low-density, high-cost rural areas. What was then called the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) is now the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and it is as relevant today as it was back then. REA and RUS loans have helped build, expand, and improve the infrastructure across rural America necessary to provide power, deliver clean water, and deploy advanced telecommunications technologies to rural areas.\n\nToday, RUS loans help electric co-ops reduce costs and improve reliability for our members by financing basic maintenance like replacing poles and wires. But it also helps us fund projects to make our systems more modern, efficient, and secure.\n\nRUS depends on a yearly appropriation from the Agriculture Appropriations bill. We have historically enjoyed strong support for robust RUS funding in large part because we’re such a good investment for the federal government. The President’s Budget request for 2018 estimates that the federal government could earn up to $300 million in net revenue from RUS loans. We ask that you help us maintain that support.\n\nWe also ask that you support policies that allow us to use RUS loans to address a broad set of co-op needs – whether for advanced utility communications, renewable generation, baseload generation, or for making environmental upgrades to existing generation. Just as the times have changed and the needs of rural America have changed, so too has the RUS loan program. We have appreciated working with the Committee over the years to help make the program more streamlined and efficient, and we look forward to exploring new ways to continue to improve the program. Modernizing the RUS loan program is good for both electric cooperative borrowers and taxpayers. The RUS annually reviews and approves billions of dollars of loans, and finding ways to more efficiently process those loans reduces burdens on taxpayers while meeting borrowers’ needs more efficiently as well. Another important financing option available to electric cooperatives is loans from cooperative banks. Co-op banks add healthy competition and a diversity of sources of capital to the marketplace. We encourage you to continue that policy.\n\nRobust Communications Infrastructure\n\nIn the 21st Century, robust communications infrastructure is just as important to our business operations as traditional generation, transmission and distribution assets. This high-speed communications capability makes our system more efficient, it makes our grid more secure, and it has the capability to make our consumers more comfortable and productive.\n\nRoanoke Electric Cooperative is currently undertaking a $4 million project to lay a fiber communications “backbone” in our service territory. Our main motivation for bringing this broadband technology to the area is to take care of our internal, operational needs. As a result, this project will reduce outage frequency as well as response time to outages while better equipping Roanoke to help member-owners manage energy and reduce system losses. We want to ensure that all of our substations can communicate with one another in order that we can better predict and manage outages, protect our substations and metering equipment from vandalism and theft, and communicate with each individual member-owner about their usage.\n\nOnce this foundation is in place, there are a lot of things we can do with it. One option we are currently studying is whether we can leverage this fiber backbone and partner to provide broadband internet to our consumers’ homes. In a world of video streaming, telecommuting, video conferencing, online education, and telemedicine, connectivity is not a luxury. It’s a necessity. A connected home is also a more efficient, comfortable taking advantage of “smart” technologies like thermostats and hot water heaters which assist the cooperative in managing peak load and save money for our members.\n\nUnfortunately, many homeowners and businesses in our region do not have access to reliable internet service. The absence of high-speed internet denies our member-owners and others in the region access to all the amenities that most urban areas enjoy. It also discourages businesses from investing in our communities which results in missed job opportunities.\n\nMany comparisons are drawn between the lack of access to robust broadband service today and the need for electrification in rural areas 80 years ago – with the urban areas of the country well-served, and rural areas being left behind. We believe that many different types of solutions will be needed to help rural Americans keep pace with their urban counterparts. As Congress contemplates telecommunication and infrastructure policies, we believe that all potential providers including electric cooperatives should have access to a diverse set of tools to help bridge the digital divide.\n\nInnovation and Energy Efficiency\n\nUpgrade to Save\n\nFor years, electric co-ops across the country have provided information and advice to consumers to help them use electricity more efficiently and cost-effectively. As I mentioned before, because we don’t have a profit motive, we have a unique opportunity to help our consumers use less energy and save money.\n\nAt Roanoke, we have a program called Upgrade to $ave where we work with our member-owners to make investments in energy efficiency in their homes that allow them to save money on their bills without making any upfront payments or incurring new debt obligation. In return, participating member-owners share the energy savings with the cooperative at a level that assures immediate financial savings for our participants and full cost recovery for our cooperative. In addition to improved comfort and saving money for our members, the program promotes local jobs by using local businesses and contractors to do these building retrofits.\n\nWe can do all this because we received a $6M loan from the Rural Utilities Service through the new Energy Efficiency & Conservation Loan Program (EECLP). In the first eighteen months of the program, local contractors completed upgrades to over 200 homes with average estimated energy savings above 20%. Most of the projects involved air sealing, duct sealing, insulation, efficient lighting, and installation of high efficiency HVAC equipment such as heat pumps.\n\nIn addition to generating energy savings, participants in Upgrade to $ave also generate spillover benefits such as reducing demand during periods of extreme weather. As a result, our cooperative benefits from lower wholesale costs for both peak demand and energy. We use some of the surplus benefits that accrue to all member-owners to pay for the cost of administering the program, which is an option open to all member-owners.\n\nCommunity Solar\n\nWe’re also proud to be partnering with several of our neighbor co-ops to install a 360 panel community solar project in our service territory. Our project was created in the same spirit that drove the creation of Roanoke Electric Cooperative. More than 75 years ago, electricity was out of reach for residents in our community. A group of people joined together to create our electric cooperative and power our lives. Today, solar energy is out of reach for a lot of people. Among other barriers, it can be expensive to set up and maintain. So we answered our members’ call to do something about it.\n\nToday, our members have the opportunity to purchase the energy output of these panels, investing in clean renewable energy and lowering their monthly electric bills. We think community solar has a lot of advantages for our members. For example, it can be a cost-effective alternative to installing new panels on your own home, and it provides options for renters who don’t own their own property. Our site is well suited for a solar installation, so you can be sure you’re getting the most out of the sun’s potential. And we take care of the maintenance.\n\nToday the North Carolina Electric Cooperatives and its consumer members support more than 2MW of community solar at 11 electric cooperatives throughout the state. To help make these projects more affordable, we have received four Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants from USDA. The total cost of all these projects was approximately $5.1 million and the REAP grants offset approximately 20% of the cost, around $1 million.\n\nMicrogrids\n\nA microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and resources connected to the main electric system, which can connect and disconnect from the grid. North Carolina’s electric cooperatives have the state’s first grid-interconnected microgrid on Ocracoke Island and another microgrid in development, the Butler Farms Microgrid. We partnered with several organizations, EPRI, Telsa, and Ecobee to implement the microgrid.\n\nThe Ocracoke Island microgrid located off the outer banks is an exercise in community resilience, protecting the island that is often in the path of offshore storms, and can be used for demand response, energy arbitrage, and ancillary services in the PJM power market. The resources in the microgrid include a 3 MW diesel generator, a TESLA 500 kW / 1 MWh battery, 15 kW of solar, and 300 internet-connected consumer devices (thermostats and water heaters). These resources also can reduce reliance on the main power grid during times of high demand when the island reaches its peak population in the summer. It also serves as an opportunity to test the integration of this technology as the state’s electric cooperatives look to use the concept elsewhere.\n\nThe Butler Farms microgrid is an opportunity to integrate swine-waste bio-fuel generation and solar existing on the farm to support the local community. With the addition of a Samsung 250 kW / 750 kWh battery and distribution controls, the generator can continue to produce energy, even if the main grid has been disconnected. Additionally, another first for the state, up to 100 homes in the area can be supported during times of localized outages through these distribution controls. This utility-facing consumer microgrid will also be used for demand response to save consumers money when electricity is most expensive.\n\nThe North Carolina Electric Cooperatives are working together on these innovative research projects in order to learn how these technologies can be integrated into our distribution systems, while continuing to provide affordable, reliable energy to our members. These demonstration projects with successful outcomes can later be integrated into the grid through multiple applications modernizing the electric system.\n\nRural Economic Development Loans and Grants (REDL&G)\n\nNo matter how successful you are at delivering electricity, if you don’t have an economy that supports good jobs, rural America will languish. Under the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant (REDLG) program, USDA provides zero-interest loans to utilities (including electric co-ops), which, in turn, pass the funds through to local businesses and other groups that create jobs in rural areas. This positive cycle of business development can strengthen both the co-op and the local community by helping stabilize populations and the co-op’s customer base. Since REDLG is funded in part by the interest and fees paid by co-op borrowers, it’s a good deal for the federal government as well.\n\nNorth Carolina has utilized REDLG loans and grants better than any other state in the country. Since 2012, North Carolina electric cooperatives have used REDLG programs to partner with 99 projects for a total investment of nearly half a billion dollars which have created over 2600 jobs. REDLG funding has been used for weatherization, school construction, libraries, public safety, medical facilities and equipment, industrial buildings and equipment, and infrastructure.\n\nFor example, Energy United provided a $2 million loan to Davie County and $1 million loan to the town of Mocksville which was used to provide infrastructure to support the recruitment of Gildan manufacturing. Gildan ultimately invested $116 million in their new facilities at the site and created 292 jobs.\n\nAnother example of how the REDLG program has benefited rural communities is the $950,000 loan made by Lumbee River EMC to the Puppy Creek Fire Department. The fire department is located in a rural area of Hoke County which has grown recently due to its location near military bases. Because the fire department didn’t have the ability to reach the upper floors of some of the newer, taller buildings, insurance rates were going up for everyone in the neighborhood. We were able to facilitate the purchase of a new ladder truck that could better service the community, bringing down insurance premiums for the entire community.\n\nRegulatory Reform\n\nLastly, we believe electric cooperatives should have broad latitude to take necessary actions they need to take to meet their consumer demands. The cooperative model of local, democratic control makes us good stewards of our communities. The federal government should have a reasonable regulatory philosophy that recognizes that relationship.\n\nWe support reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to promote the development of rural infrastructure. In addition, streamlining federal government management practices on federal lands will make it easier for electric co-ops to maintain safety and reliability by performing needed vegetation management to prevent threats to power lines and respond to emergencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are a healthy nation because we have vibrant, bustling urban cities AND because we have verdant, productive rural areas. Unfortunately, whether it’s infrastructure or jobs or access to health care, it seems that too often rural America gets the short end of the stick. You have an opportunity to address some of those disparities.\n\nElectric cooperatives enjoy a productive partnership with the federal government and with the communities we serve to promote the health of rural America. We look forward to continuing to work with you toward that important goal. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify here today. I’m happy to answer any of your questions.\n\nBrandon McBride has been administrator of the Rural Utilities Service since 2015. McBride was a senior professional staffer in Congress on rural issues before President Obama appointed him to head RUS. In this Q&A, he answers questions about the role that RUS and rural electric cooperatives can play in meeting the needs of rural America.\n\nQ. What is the biggest challenge you have faced since becoming administrator of RUS?\n\nA. One of the biggest challenges is to keep reminding the public, policy makers and even rural electric cooperatives what a big job they have and how hard it is to serve rural, remote and sparsely populated areas. The success of our program and its partnership with rural electric cooperatives has made too easy to underestimate both the difficulty and importance of providing affordable power to the 80 percent of America’s geography that is rural.\n\nQ. What do you see as the major recent accomplishments of RUS in connection with electric co-ops?\n\nA. I am very proud that RUS continues to be a reliable, affordable and flexible source of capital for rural electric infrastructure investment. We succeeded in implementing the new Rural Energy Savings Plan, which will make $52 million in zero-interest loans available to energy providers to help rural families and small businesses reduce energy use. This new program, called RESP, is already oversubscribed. RESP builds on our work to increase funding for energy efficiency under the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Loan Program.\n\nI am also very pleased that Rural Development published an environmental regulation which considered and carefully balanced the comments of hundreds of Americans concerned with both a cleaner, greener future and affordable power for rural America. The reviews have been good and I believe we got the balance right, thanks to input from NRECA, rural electric cooperatives and commenters on all sides of this issue. Publishing a final rule in this area removed uncertainty and opens the door to investments for the future.\n\nIt’s also very exciting to see the rural electric cooperative movement continue to grow and provide 21st century leadership for affordable power. For example, I am pleased that RUS helped electric distribution cooperatives serving southern Minnesota acquire a portion of an investor-owned utility’s territory and assets which will improve service, efficiency and reliability for customers and improve the economics of the service territory. The July 2015 acquisition was a win/win for everyone.\n\nQ. What do you say to critics who argue RUS has accomplished its mission of electrifying rural America and is no longer needed?\n\nA. Distance and density remain the largest barriers to modern utility service for rural Americans. Affordable power, as well as affordable telecommunications, water and sewer services are all critical to the rural quality of life and rural economic development. As long as rural communities need to improve and upgrade electric systems, gain access to affordable, robust broadband service, and invest in clean, safe water, RUS programs will continue to be relevant.\n\nNetworks need continuous care, modernization and maintenance to survive and thrive. We are also seeing dramatic technology, market and regulatory changes affect the entire electric market. RUS financing is critical for rural utilities to manage their costs in a changing environment. In capital intensive industries, like electric service, low cost capital translates into lower power rates for residential and business consumers.\n\nAs long as the cooperative business model continues to succeed at providing affordable, reliable electric power to rural communities, RUS and its sister Rural Development programs can help with funding for a variety of community facilities, housing and business needs.\n\nQ. What are the strengths of RUS as a financing source versus private lenders and how do you ensure co-ops have flexibility to meet their local needs?\n\nA. One of the greatest strengths of the RUS program is that it facilitates the participation of private lenders. I believe that the rural electric system is well served by a diversified portfolio of borrowing. The power of the RUS/REA system is that it is based on years of practical utilities experience and builds borrower equity and creditworthiness as borrowers finance and build their electric systems. As the electric industry evolves with new technologies and renewable energy, investment will be critical not just for rural economies, but nationwide. There is an advantage in portfolio diversity, with a mix of private funds and RUS’ extremely low interest rates.\n\nWorking with borrowers, co-lenders and applicants, RUS is dedicated to finding financing solutions for rural electric cooperatives which meet the modern needs of rural America.\n\nQ. Co-ops and RUS have key partnerships on programs like REDLG and the Rural Energy Savings program. Where do you see these programs going?\n\nA. Across America, rural electric cooperatives are leading rural economic development; improving the quality of life and investing in the future. The REDLG program, where co-ops borrow funds to relend for rural economic development, and the Rural Energy Savings Program and the Energy Efficiency Conservation Loan Program where co-ops borrow funds for energy efficiency, help rural electric co-ops meet the needs of their communities. For example, Quinter, Kansas with a population of 1,000, was able to build a new fire station to better meet the needs of the 400-square mile service area, with funding from a REDLG loan from Midwest Energy.\n\nThese programs can help rural electric cooperatives better meet the needs of their customers and their communities. Whether a co-op wants to help customers reduce power use and costs, or improve access to health care by funding a medical clinic, REDLG and RESP offer solutions that can improve the quality of life in rural communities. These are just two examples of our partnership that works in so many ways to make rural America the great place that it is.\n\nQ. How can RUS and co-ops work together to expand access to high-speed Internet in unserved rural areas?\n\nBrandon McBride speaks about broadband service at a session in South Carolina. (Photo By: USDA Rural Development)\n\nA. Today, 40 percent of those who live and work in rural areas lack the same access to affordable high-speed internet service common in non-rural areas. The Obama Administration is very much focused on ways to improve access to broadband service.\n\nRUS and the Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications Information Administration are leaders in the Broadband Opportunity Council’s effort to expand broadband access. We clearly need more partnerships in rural areas to leverage all available resources to support broadband deployment. Rural electric cooperatives are in a unique position to help achieve that goal. With changes in the electric utility industry and in rural America, broadband is a critical element in the ability of rural electric cooperatives to respond to new customer needs. And RUS, with experience in both electric and telecommunications systems, is ready to assist them by offering low cost financing to deploy infrastructure for high-speed internet access, including smart grid technologies, through our telecommunications, broadband and electric programs.\n\nI also want to recognize Jo Ann Emerson for bringing her passion for rural broadband to NRECA. That is a lasting legacy. As a result of her work, rural electric and telecomm providers have launched a productive dialogue on ways to connect rural America to the world of high speed internet access. This is critical to rural America’s efforts to reach its full potential."
