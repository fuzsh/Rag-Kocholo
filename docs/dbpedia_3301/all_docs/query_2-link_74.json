        "text": "UP WITH CHRIS HAYES\n\nAugust 26, 2012\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.\n\nTHIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nGuests: Corey Robin, Sophia Nelson, Avik Roy, Michael Bell, Wendell Cox, Bob Buckhorn\n\nCHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: Good morning from New York, I`m Chris Hayes.\n\nPresident Obama paid tribute to Neil Armstrong last night in a\n\nstatement that reads, quote, \"Neil`s spirit of discovery lives on in all\n\nthe men and women who have devoted their lives to exploring the unknown.\n\nThat legacy will endure, sparked by a man who taught us the enormous power\n\nof one small step.\"\n\nArmstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, died yesterday at 82\n\nyears old.\n\nThe first night of the Republican National Convention, which was set\n\nto begin tomorrow, has been canceled because of Tropical Storm Isaac. The\n\nofficial nomination of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is now\n\nslated for Tuesday.\n\nWe`ll be talking about Romney and his party`s platform in just a\n\nmoment, but with Florida now in a state of emergency, we want to get the\n\nlatest from NBC meteorologist Bill Karins on Tropical Storm Isaac.\n\nWell, good morning, Chris, to you. Isaac is now just south of Miami,\n\nFlorida, heading for Key West during the day today. Overnight it hasn`t\n\nsignificantly strengthened, and that is good, but it still has plenty of\n\ntime to do that over the warm waters of the Gulf before it heads to\n\nnorthern portions of the central Gulf states.\n\nHere`s a look at it on radar this morning. You can see all the\n\nspiraling bands. That black line on the bottom of your screen is the\n\ncenter of the storm. Pretty much due south of Miami, we`re not really\n\ngoing to see a high-impact event today from Ft. Lauderdale to Miami to\n\nNaples to Key West.\n\nThis is a strong tropical storm going through but for this region of\n\nthe country, a lot of squally weather. I really don`t expect too many\n\npower outages throughout this region.\n\nNow as far as the storm itself, 65-mile-per-hour winds, about 200\n\nmiles now away from Key West. And where is the storm heading? It does\n\nappear it is going to be likely this tropical storm force wind field you\n\nsee in orange will be heading through South Florida and then off the Gulf\n\nCoast, possibly clipping areas like Tampa.\n\nSo as far as the forecast path of the storm goes, here it is. We\n\nexpect Monday to intensify well off the coast of Florida heading up there\n\ntowards the northern Gulf. As far as the impacts go, obviously the north\n\ncentral Gulf and the New Orleans area is probably the most significant\n\nimpacts, Chris.\n\nTampa will see some gusty winds, but they`re not going to get the\n\nbrunt of the storm; it looks to be far enough off shore. They should have\n\nvery minimal impacts there. But, of course, they already canceled the\n\nevents for Monday and hopefully by Tuesday night they can get everything\n\nback on schedule. Back to you.\n\nHAYES: NBC meteorologist Bill Karins.\n\nJoining me now we have Avik Roy, health care policy adviser to Mitt\n\nRomney; Joan Walsh, author of \"What`s the Matter with White People: Why We\n\nLong for a Golden Age That Never Was,\" editor at large for salon.com. I`m\n\ntwo chapters into it and it`s fantastic. I recommend you check it out.\n\nElise Jordan, contributor to thedailybeast.com and former speech\n\nwriter to secretary of state Condoleezza Richard; and Sophia Nelson author\n\nof \"Black Women Redefined: Dispelling Myths and Discovering Fulfillment in\n\nthe Age of Michelle Obama,\" former Republican counsel for the House\n\nGovernment Operations Committee, now a columnist for our sister website,\n\nthegrio.com. Great to have you here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great to be here.\n\nHAYES: The 2012 Republican National Convention begins Tuesday in\n\nTampa, Florida, with the party gathering to vote on the GOP platform, a\n\nstatement of the positions and values of the modern Republican Party.\n\nFor the past week, the platform committee has been hashing out a draft\n\nof the document, versions of which have been obtained by NBC News and\n\n\"Politico,\" giving concrete documentation of the party`s extreme disconnect\n\nfrom the politics of the general population.\n\nThe abortion plank makes absolutely no mention of an exception for\n\nrape, incest or even to save the life of the mother, reaffirming party\n\nsupport for the position of Missouri Congressman Todd Akin, who now trails\n\nSenator Claire McCaskill in the Missouri Senate race by nine points a week\n\nafter his now infamous comments, according to a new \"St. Louis Post-\n\nDispatch\" news bore (ph) poll released yesterday.\n\nInstead, the platform calls for a human life amendment granting 14th\n\nAmendment rights to fetuses. Drafts also call for a constitutional\n\namendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman, a denial of\n\nfederal funds to universities that provide in-state tuition to undocumented\n\nimmigrants, which could block states like Texas with DREAM Act laws from\n\nfederal education money.\n\nAnd in a true nod to the shunned Ron Paul faction of the party,\n\n\"Financial Times\" reports the platform calls for a commission to study a\n\nreturn to the gold standard. As elements of the platform started to leak\n\nout, a chorus of Republicans rushed to distance themselves and Mitt Romney\n\nfrom it.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), N.J.: I don`t have to worry about doing this\n\nspeech. You think I`m going there and starting to worry about the\n\nplatform, forget about it.\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS, CHAIRMAN, RNC: This is the platform of the Republican\n\nParty. It`s not the platform of Mitt Romney.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Republicans would like you to believe their party platform is\n\nunimportant. They would like you to ignore and focus on Mitt Romney. But\n\nas the Republican Party becomes an increasingly parliamentary and\n\nideologically maximist organization, this election is as much about the\n\nnature of the Republican Party as it is about its candidate.\n\nSo today, I want to ask, what is the Republican Party? Who controls\n\nit and what answers does this document provide to those questions?\n\nAvik, I`ll start with you. There`s a few theories about who`s driving\n\nthe train in the moderate Republican Party. So, the theory that you hear\n\noften on our network -- and the one that I think I`m partial to, but I\n\nthink is plausibly rebuttable -- is that the hard right is driving the\n\ntrain of the moderate Republican Party.\n\nAnd if you look at the votes, you look at what the agenda of say the\n\nHouse Republican Caucus has been, it has been to pursue the objectives of\n\nsocial conservatives, particularly there have been a lot of stuff about\n\nabortion and contraception.\n\nAnd generally has had an ideological flavor that is to the right of\n\nwhere the center of America is and certainly to the right -- rightist part\n\nof the Republican coalition.\n\nThere`s an argument that actually, when you look at the last two\n\nnominees -- John McCain and Mitt Romney -- this the sort of other side of\n\nit -- I`ll just argue both sides and then I`ll let you talk -- is that --\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHAYES: -- that if you look at the nominees, John McCain and Mitt\n\nRomney, that the right wing base of the party didn`t get its wish with\n\neither John McCain and Mitt Romney, hence heir apparent, hence Paul Ryan.\n\nAnd I`m curious to get your feedback to the Reince Priebus quote,\n\n\"This is not Mitt Romney`s platform. This is the Republican Party.\"\n\nAVIK ROY, SR. FELLOW, THE MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: I`d say a couple\n\nthings. Excuse me. In the -- in both parties the activists are always\n\ngoing to be driving the agenda and the platforms are going to be the ones\n\nwho are pushing the candidates, particularly in the primaries, to adhere to\n\ncertain principles.\n\nI think what`s interesting is how the Republican Party`s activist base\n\nhas evolved. So in the 1990s three was more of this social conservatism\n\nemphasis.\n\nToday it`s much more about constitutionalism; it`s much more about\n\neconomics; it`s much more about the budget deficit. It`s much more about\n\nthe debt. That`s very much the driver of the Republican Party today in a\n\nway that wasn`t true 15, 20 years ago.\n\nHAYES: I`m glad you raised that, because people say that and I don`t\n\nbuy it. I mean, this is the story we were told about the Tea Party, was\n\nthat, oh, gone are the days of evangelicals on the cover of \"Time\"\n\nmagazine, George W. Bush, gay marriage issues.\n\nDo you guys feel that that is the case, that they have made this turn\n\naway from social issues towards fiscal (inaudible) -- ?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJOAN WALSH, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST, \"SALON\" EDITOR AT LARGE: No, I\n\nmean, the House Republicans come in and one of the first things they try to\n\ndo is defund Planned Parenthood. What does that have to do with the\n\nConstitution?\n\nI mean, the thing about Todd Akin is the tragedy for Todd Akin is that\n\nthis party has given lip service -- this platform has been this bad on\n\nabortion since 1992.\n\nVery few people realize this because the party has had the strategy of\n\nkind of winking and nodding at their base and then putting forward a more\n\nmoderate public face around this and only talking about we won`t allow\n\nabortion even in cases of rape and incest, \"in quiet room,\" as Mitt Romney\n\nmight say.\n\nAnd Todd Akin has brought that hypocrisy right out in front, so that\n\nyou see this man who is not backing down and now Mike Huckabee is going to\n\nholy war on his behalf because they`re tired of having the platform look\n\nthis way but the candidates say, oh, it`s not our platform. This is Mitt\n\nRomney`s party. They`re not getting away with it any more.\n\nSOPHIA NELSON, COLUMNIST FOR THEGRIO.COM, FORMER GOP HOUSE COMMITTEE\n\nCOUNSEL: Yes, here`s someone who troubles me as someone that was a\n\nRepublican for a lot of years. I grew up in a Republican Party when Jack\n\nKemp was there, when Christine Todd Whitman was the first Republican I\n\nworked for right out of law school in New Jersey.\n\nKemp certainly was definitely a conservative but fiscally he was\n\ndefinitely a conservative socially, but that isn`t what he argued about.\n\nHe was passionate about the cities in this country, kind of like Mitt\n\nRomney`s dad, a little bit in an interesting sense.\n\nBut the Republican Party has definitely drifted in a direction I don`t\n\nunderstand, because if you think about it, I consider myself more of a\n\nlibertarian, OK. And so for me, I want small government. So I don`t get\n\nwhy you`re telling women, can they have abortions or not, or some of these\n\nsocial issues they really don`t fit with a true Republican Party, what that\n\nmeans.\n\nHAYES: Well, they do fit with a true Republican Party because the --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNELSON: No, no, no, but if you believe in small government, Chris,\n\nyou don`t believe that government should be telling people what to do. Am\n\nI right? Or did I get --\n\nELISE JORDAN, JOURNALIST, FORMER DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: No, I absolutely agree. And I think that you\n\nlook at -- you know, would George H.W. Bush be able to be a contender\n\ntoday? I don`t think so.\n\nAnd I think that`s a real tragedy. I personally love George H.W.\n\nBush. I like Bob Dole. Bob Dole is saying recently that we`re going too\n\nfar right.\n\nAnd I think it is really an off-putting trend to Millennials, who they\n\nmight be attracted to the Republican platform in terms of fiscal\n\nconservatism. But when it comes to social issues, they`re like, no, get\n\nout of the bedroom, we like gay people.\n\nROY: Yes. So, I`ll take the other side of that. So I actually think\n\nthat the evolution has been much more towards economics and we see this\n\nnaturally with the Millennials. So one thing that has been interesting\n\nabout the last 20 years is it used to be that the center of the GOP was\n\nTexas. And I`ve spent some time in Texas. I lived there. I love Texas.\n\nBut right now what we see is what is the political center of gravity\n\nof Republicanism? It`s Wisconsin, it`s Michigan, right, that upper Midwest\n\nis naturally, historically what the home of Republicanism has been for\n\n100, 150 years.\n\nAnd that`s -- I think that`s what we`ll see as the Millennials\n\ncontinue to get older, as the social issues, the consensus on social issues\n\nchanges. I`m not sure it will change on abortion, actually; 50 percent of\n\nAmericans are pro-life now. That`s the highest number that the Gallup poll\n\nhas ever recorded.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Depending on how you ask the question.\n\nHAYES: They define themselves pro-life, but if you ask should\n\nabortion be illegal in all circumstances, which is the official position of\n\nthe Republican Party in the platform, that is a small minoritarian (ph)\n\nposition. Just as a matter of public --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- platform position is on the other --\n\nHAYES: Right. Yes.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s right, so --\n\nJORDAN: It`s a mistake and it`s a total distraction from what should\n\nbe the real issue in this election -- the economy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don`t think it -- from the election.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, it absolutely --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJORDAN: I`ve heard it has. You have Akin out there, saying -- you\n\nknow, talking about legitimate rape and refusing to stand down, like it`s\n\nabsolutely horrible and, I mean, Republicans were rightfully outraged.\n\nNELSON: (Inaudible) someone who is pro-life, I consider myself pro-\n\nlife but I don`t have a problem with other people making a different choice\n\nthan I do. And I think abortion should be legal in this country and safe\n\nin this country.\n\nHAYES: OK, but then you`re exactly why the polling on this is a total\n\nmess. You`re telling me right here, I`m pro-life and believe in legalized\n\nabortion, then yes, OK. Fine. Gallup says that 50 percent of people are\n\npro-life.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Exactly.\n\nWALSH: But people do. I mean, most people do make very personal\n\nreckonings with this.\n\nHAYES: Wait, can I -- I just want to -- I want to stay on this, who\n\nhas the power thing, right? Because obviously, there`s these different\n\nstrains in the Republican Party, OK?\n\nThere`s -- and the classic kind of three-legged stool or national\n\nsecurity conservatives, right, then that was dread of this anti-communist,\n\nthe sort of Cold Warrior tradition. They`re economic conservatives, sound\n\nmoney and fiscal prudence, although that is not really been record of the\n\nparty, but smaller government, let`s say.\n\nAnd then there`s social conservatism, right. And one of the things\n\nthat happened was I think social conservatism was quite dominant during the\n\nGeorge W. Bush years.\n\nThere was so much -- remember how much -- there was so much coverage\n\nof the evangelical base and George W. Bush was the first born-again\n\npresident. And then the Tea Party was all about the sort of economic turn.\n\nBut whatever the emphasis was, the fact remains, it`s still the same folks.\n\nI mean, it`s still the same people in the coalition.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROY: There isn`t a philosophical inconsistency, right? So when you\n\nhave something like the HHS contraception mandate, the small government\n\npeople say why should the government be telling us what insurance policies\n\nmust cover?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.\n\nROY: The social conservatives get upset because they`re like why\n\nshould -- why should Catholics have to?\n\nHAYES: And that`s why --\n\nROY: (Inaudible) their faith.\n\nHAYES: I think that`s why Republicans saw that as such a huge\n\npolitical opportunity, not necessarily because of the political gains to be\n\nwon among independents, although it was part of it, it`s a delightfully\n\nunifying issue for different parts of the coalition. It`s a part of the\n\nVenn diagram.\n\nNELSON: Chris, I think what becomes critical is look at the 2010\n\nmidterms. To me, if the 2010 -- if the same electorate that comes out in\n\nthe 2010 midterms comes out for the GOP and the African-American vote is\n\nsuppressed -- and I`m not talking about from a voter`s standpoint; we can\n\ndeal with that issue later. But I`m talking about from the standpoint of\n\nAfrican-Americans not being --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mobilization --\n\nNELSON: -- excited about President Obama this time, right, I think\n\nthat it will be an interesting dynamic because I think then Mitt Romney has\n\na shot at winning this White House, a real shot. And so I think that\n\nreally becomes what issues drive this. Is it social or is it economic Tea\n\nParty issues?\n\nHAYES: But there`s also a case to be made, and I want to -- this is\n\nwhat I want to address, is that when you talk about the balance -- there`s\n\na case to be made, social conservatives will make this case. Absolutely.\n\n\"American Conservative\" once ran a cover story on this and in the reporting\n\nI`ve done with social conservatives, where they say, yes, we`re the ones\n\nthat get screwed.\n\nBut they give us a lot of lip service. This is sort of in some ways\n\nthe Tom Frank vote to outlaw abortion get energy deregulation, this famous\n\nriff that he has in the beginning of \"What is the Matter with Kansas,\" that\n\nactually -- the people calling the shots are the Mitt Romney-Sheldon\n\nAdelson wing of the party.\n\nI want to bring that up with Michael Steele. I also want to talk to\n\nMichael Steele about Charlie Crist endorsing the president today, right\n\nafter we take this break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: I want to bring in MSNBC political analyst Michael Steele,\n\nformer head of the Republican National Commission, joining us from Tampa\n\nthis morning.\n\nAll right, Michael, first up --\n\nMICHAEL STEELE, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Hey.\n\nHAYES: Hey. Let me -- you are getting some flack for the Tampa --\n\nfor the convention being -- no, let me say it -- for the convention being\n\nin Tampa during hurricane season.\n\nBut I want to say this, it is a stroke of genius to put the convention\n\nin a hurricane-prone area and then put all the speakers you might want to\n\ncancel on the first night so that you have an out. I think we`re going to\n\nstart seeing this be the norm for all political conventions.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michael did that.\n\nHAYES: I just want to commend you on this brilliant Machiavellian\n\nmove.\n\nSTEELE: Thank you. I`m just, look, I`m just a brother trying to help\n\nfolks out, that`s all.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHAYES: Trying to -- you`re trying to help out Mitt Romney so Mike\n\nHuckabee -- oops, too bad, Mike Huckabee, my bad. Are we going to see Mike\n\nHuckabee, what`s the deal?\n\nSTEELE: Oh, you probably will. They`ll readjust this. You know,\n\nlook, I get blamed for everything, apparently, these days because they\n\ndon`t want, you know, it`s just -- it`s I`m convenient. I`m the -- I guess\n\nI`m the convenient truth for them or whatever.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, this is going to be a great convention.\n\nFolks act like we haven`t done this before. In 2008, we were in Minnesota\n\nand we canceled because of (inaudible). The reality of it is, we set this\n\nin motion two years ago, like we could forecast the weather, et cetera.\n\nBut we have -- they have plans. I don`t know what plans this\n\nparticular RNC had, but I know what we had planned for putting on this\n\nconvention. So the reality of it is it will go forth, everyone will have a\n\ngreat time, you`ll be a little wet, but no worse off.\n\nHAYES: If we don`t get our act together in carbon, all political\n\nconventions in 2050 will be in Alaska. It will the only (inaudible) place\n\nto have summer conventions. And I`m not joking.\n\nAll right, in news in the morning, Michael --\n\nSTEELE: I`ve got my carbon suit, I`m ready.\n\nHAYES: Former Republican governor of Florida Charlie Crist endorses\n\nPresident Obama in the \"Tampa Bay Times\" today. Let me just read you a\n\nlittle bit of this. I want to get your reaction.\n\n\"As Republicans gathered in Tampa to nominate Mitt Romney, Americans\n\ncan expect to hear tales of how President Obama has failed to work with\n\ntheir party or turn the economy around. But an element of their party has\n\npitched so far to the extreme right on issues important to women,\n\nimmigrants, seniors and students, they have proven incapable of governing\n\nfor the people.\n\n\"President Obama has a strong record of doing what is best for America\n\nin Florida, and he built it by spending more time worrying about what his\n\ndecisions would mean for the people than for his political fortunes.\n\nThat`s what makes him the right leader for our times, and that`s why I`m\n\nproud to stand with him today.\"\n\nThis is a case that has been made by a variety of people. Olympia\n\nSnowe has made this case. Jim Jeffords back a while ago has made this\n\ncase. A variety of folks have made the case that the Republican Party has\n\nlurched to the right. I think it`s grounded in some pretty good empirical\n\ndata political scientists have produced, D.W. nominate score.\n\nWhat is your reaction to Charlie Crist`s endorsement this morning?\n\nSTEELE: I don`t have any, honestly. I mean, that`s Charlie Crist`s\n\ndecision. He has always shown himself to be a somewhat independent person\n\nwhen it comes to the people of Florida, in particular, and his view on\n\npolitics.\n\nSo, you know, look, this is the beauty of the American political\n\nsystem. You can have someone do that cross-party thing and it`s not a\n\nproblem.\n\nI`ve always been amused that Republicans, you know, love it when\n\nDemocrats come out and endorse, you know, our candidates, like Joe\n\nLieberman did, as you recall. But then we get all, you know, put off when\n\na Republican sees some virtue or value in a Democrat candidate. And so,\n\nthose individual choices and, you know, God bless them.\n\nLook, the focus for Mitt Romney is not whether or not Crist has\n\nendorsed him. The focus for Mitt Romney this week is to make sure America\n\ngets to know him and understand his vision for this country. He has got to\n\nstart speaking specifics.\n\nHAYES: He has been running for five years. Why do (inaudible)?\n\nSTEELE: I`m -- look, I get that, I get that. But you know, you know,\n\nand I understand where you`re going with that. And I agree he has been\n\ndoing this for a long time.\n\nHAYES: It`s not like he`s a new face on the national political scene.\n\nSTEELE: That`s true. That`s true. But you know, that`s the nature\n\nof politics is, you know, there are those moments where you have to\n\nreintroduce yourself, where you do have to come back and let people know\n\nthe other side, the rest of the story. This is what the convention opens\n\nup for him, that opportunity to do that.\n\nHAYES: I think we spend too much -- generally I think we spend too\n\nmuch time on the candidates as individuals and less on the political\n\ncoalition and constituencies that they will have to deal with once they`re\n\nin office. That`s part of the theme of today. The platform is a document.\n\nIt`s not going to be waved by a magic wand into law.\n\nBut it is -- he is going to helm up. He is going to be at the head.\n\nHe`s at the tip of the spear of a certain political coalition (inaudible)\n\nin life, right, a set of interests, a set of constituencies, a demographic\n\nbase, a regional base. Those people all have desires that are bigger than\n\nwhat Mitt Romney is like when he wrestles with his boys when he gets home.\n\nSophia?\n\nNELSON: Mike, it`s Sophia, how are you?\n\nSTEELE: Hey, how are you?\n\nNELSON: Good.\n\nListen, I had a question for you. You know, I think that this past\n\nweek was really bad for Mitt Romney and the GOP obviously with Akin and his\n\ncomments. What is your sense of how they are going to try to shift this\n\nback to economic issues, versus the conversation we have been having about\n\nissues of female reproductive rights in this country?\n\nHAYES: And also how the female reproductive system works.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNELSON: Oh, my God. And you know, I live in Virginia, which is a\n\nbattleground state and the ads have already started. I mean, we have seen\n\nmore ads about choice than I have seen in years and in political campaigns.\n\nSo I want your thoughts on how Romney shifts this thing back to what he\n\nwants to talk about, which is economics.\n\nSTEELE: Well, that is exactly the point I was making earlier with\n\nChris, is that`s what this week is about, is to start to frame that\n\nargument, to come out and talk about his economic plan to reorient the\n\nconversation around the economy and jobs, et cetera.\n\nThe problem is that there is a lot of thickets in the way before you\n\nget to that clearing and you just touched on a few of them. Of course, you\n\nknow, folks now -- you`re focusing on the tropical storm and all of that.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, you, at some point, are going to have to\n\nnarrow this conversation to clearly define where you are.\n\nYou cannot, on the one hand, say -- because I know a lot of folks in\n\nthe base. You know, I`m from the base, I know the base, they don`t want to\n\nhear their nominee as they produce this platform and go, oh, that`s not my\n\nplatform or the party chairman say, well, that`s not his platform. That\n\ndoesn`t mean anything to him.\n\nThat`s not what that -- they don`t want to hear that. All that does\n\nis stirs up more passions.\n\nROY: We have this conversation every four years.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEELE: (Inaudible) something else.\n\nROY: We have this conversation every four years about every platform.\n\nPeople, it`s a sport. Every time there`s a platform, people say, oh, well,\n\nthere`s this in the platform that is different from what the candidate\n\nthinks, different from what maybe the consensus in the country is. We\n\nalways talk about it and then we forget about it, because at the end of the\n\nday, it is about the candidates.\n\nHAYES: Draw that out, though. You forget about it, why? Because --\n\nso you`re basically saying the entire thing is a purely cynical exercise to\n\nwrite things in paper --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: -- as a sop to placate people?\n\nROY: No, I think it is a statement of what activists in the party,\n\nthe consensus among activists in the party believe should be the core of\n\nactivists, conservative activists or conservative liberals. But that is\n\ndifferent from what a conservative who`s appealing to the center of the\n\ncountry is going to try to do.\n\nHAYES: The question is do those activists, should Mitt Romney be\n\npresident, how much purchase do they have in that White House? I mean,\n\nthat`s the open question, right?\n\nROY: Very little. Very little. I think they have more --\n\nHAYES: Do you hear that, Republican activists?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very little.\n\nHAYES: You have very little purchase on a Mitt Romney presidency.\n\nI`m not sure if I believe that. I just want to get your thoughts --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible) -- OK.\n\nHAYES: We have to take a quick break.\n\nHang with us, Michael.\n\nSTEELE: I am.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nFORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY, R-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I believe\n\nabortion should be safe and legal.\n\nI not only talk about being pro-life, I have a record of being pro-\n\nlife.\n\nI believe basically what I read. The world is getting warmer. And,\n\nnumber two, I believe that humans contribute to that. And so I think it`s\n\nimportant for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants, of greenhouse gases\n\nthat may well be significant contributors to the climate change.\n\nMy view is that we don`t know what`s causing climate change on this\n\nplanet.\n\nWe do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won`t\n\nchip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our\n\nsafety.\n\nI support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and\n\nfundamental rights of every American.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: That`s a little montage of Mitt Romney`s journey of self-\n\ndiscovery over the past 10 years.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Getting to know himself.\n\nHAYES: My favorite one, actually, is the climate one, because it`s\n\nonly nine months that separate those two statements.\n\nWe`re talking about the base of the Republican Party and basically who\n\ncontrols it and these sort of alternating theories. I think, I think --\n\nand I think there`s a lot of evidence of this, the party has moved to the\n\nright and the party has moved to the right in ways that there is -- you\n\nknow, there`s ways you can track the score of House votes.\n\nAlso if you look at exit polling -- I was poring through exit polling\n\nlast night, the past few elections and you know, ideological self-\n\nidentification of Americans, liberal, moderate and conservative, in the\n\nlast few elections, Republicans have won conservatives by huge margins --\n\n80-20, 85-15 -- and they`ve lost liberals by generally huge margins.\n\nBut they`ve also lost moderates, self-described moderates by\n\nsignificant proportions. And that wasn`t the case 15, 20 years ago.\n\nSo there has been a real shift in that. There`s more self-identified\n\nconservatives than there are self-identified liberals in the country, which\n\nis why they can still win elections while losing -- while losing moderates.\n\nBut you just said something interesting before we went to break, which\n\nis, basically, it`s going to -- the base is not going to be controlling\n\nthings in a Mitt Romney --\n\nROY: The base influences things for sure. So, they influence the\n\nterms of the debate. They influence the primaries. They influence who\n\ngets elected to Congress. They influence who staffs an administration but\n\nit`s also true that there is a need to win elections. There`s a need to\n\nboth move the debate in your direction but also appeal to people in the\n\ncenter. And that`s the tension.\n\nSo, as activists, your job is to move the debate in your direction.\n\nSo pro-life activists try to move the country in a pro-life direction. Gay\n\nmarriage activists try to move the country in a pro-gay marriage direction.\n\nThat`s what activists do. And the political, the candidates reflect how\n\nthat debate changes over time.\n\nJORDAN: Well, I think what is most noteworthy about this convention\n\nis who the keynote speaker is, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. And\n\nhe is definitely a moderate Republican, but one who overwhelmingly enjoys\n\nacross the board Republican support.\n\nHAYES: Yes. Let me just define the terms moderate. I don`t think\n\nhe`s moderate, in terms of the actions. He is not as socially conservative\n\nas other members, but, you know, there`s an ideological spectrum on the\n\neconomic issues as well. I don`t consider --\n\nJORDAN: Well, yes, but he`s a --\n\nHAYES: -- him a moderate.\n\nJORDAN: He is a social, he`s -- sorry, I`m getting all tangled up.\n\nHe`s fiscally conservative.\n\nHAYES: Well --\n\nWALSH: He occasionally says tolerant things about Muslims. And in\n\nthe party --\n\nHAYES: To his great credit.\n\nWALSH: To his great credit. And you know, we`ve got some sharia law\n\nlanguage in the Republican Party platform.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJORDAN: He is a very honest politician. I think that Americans are\n\nreally responding to that across the board and I think it`s what\n\nRepublicans need more of. They need to be more honest.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJORDAN: He`s a regular guy.\n\nHAYES: Michael, Elise is calling for more honesty, but wasn`t Todd\n\nAkin being honest?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHAYES: I`m serious. I`m not even making a joke.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He said he misspoke.\n\nSTEELE: Yes, one man`s honesty is another man`s gaffe. I mean,\n\nthat`s how it works.\n\nBut, yes, I mean, I think there`s a lot of truth to the idea of being\n\nhonest. I mean, in terms of addressing and dealing with these issues --\n\nand, certainly, on the social side of the spectrum, you were speaking\n\nearlier -- and I think absolutely, I think Joan made this point and she was\n\nabsolutely right.\n\nA lot of social conservatives feel, when they go back, looking back\n\neven to the 1980s in the Reagan era, that they had a one-sided bargain.\n\nAnd the idea was to come in and to, you know, vote for us, support us and\n\nwe`ll take care of your agenda and your issues.\n\nAnd for 30-plus years on the -- particular on the pro-life side, they\n\nhave not seen that movement towards solving their issue. This Roe versus\n\nWade, et cetera. So you see now that activism taking place more at the\n\ngrassroots as opposed to --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: -- and they`ve had a lot more success. But, also, we should\n\njust draw a distinction between what is happening on the court and what`s\n\nhappening legislatively. There has been a tremendous amount of victories\n\nfor pro-life folks in the Hyde amendment, obviously first in the late-term\n\nabortion ban that was passed and signed.\n\nSandra Day O`Connor was the -- wrote it, quote, \"the wrong way\" for\n\npro-life conservatives, as did Anthony Kennedy, both Republican nominees,\n\non the issue of Roe v. Wade and later reexamining Casey, but that doesn`t\n\nmean that there haven`t been legislative victories on that.\n\nI want to turn to this economic question. So let`s put aside for a\n\nsecond social conservatism and the (inaudible).\n\nMy big theory that I have been on my hobby horse on all -- the entire\n\ncampaign is that there`s this totally false notion that the Republican\n\nParty stands for fiscal conservativism and that this is going to be --\n\nyou`re going to get when you elect Republicans, you will get smaller\n\ndeficits and smaller government.\n\nBut there is zero -- literally zero empirical basis for that that we\n\nactually just ran the experiment in which we had the Republican Party\n\ncontrol all the -- both the elected and executive branches of government\n\nas a percentage of GDP grew, the deficit grew massively.\n\nNow we`re all told that everybody has had their road to Damascus\n\nmoment, that they have -- they have -- they are walking away from this\n\nterrible years of George W. Bush, a name that you will never hear invoked.\n\nYou probably won`t hear once in Tampa, amazingly.\n\nAnd I just don`t buy it. I don`t buy it. What we`re going to get,\n\nhuge increases in defense spending and we are already seeing them fight on\n\nthe sequester. It`s in the platform. In fact, the draft platform of the\n\nGOP is my favorite line in the whole draft platform. It attacks the\n\npresident`s national security strategy document as being, quote, \"budget\n\nconstraint.\"\n\nThe adjective it used to insult it is budget constraint. All right?\n\nSo we will not see smaller government by the Republican administration and\n\nwe will not see smaller deficits. I want to hear you guys respond to that\n\nafter we take a break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: We`re talking about the -- what is the existential core of the\n\nmodern Republican Party, I think it`s fair to say.\n\nAnd we`ve talked a little bit about this tension between social\n\nconservatives and fiscal conservatives and sort of -- and then people, the\n\nSheldon Adelsons of the world who have issues very much focused, in his\n\ncase, on Israel and economic issues and the base that has different -- you\n\nknow, abortion and social issues.\n\nBut even turning our attention to fiscal conservatism, quote/unquote,\n\nI just don`t buy it. I just don`t buy that the Republican Party is going\n\nto shrink government.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, right.\n\nHAYES: I think it will change who the government benefits and I think\n\nit will run massive deficits. And I -- because there is no evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n\nWALSH: The Ryan budget runs deficits to, what, 2040.\n\nHAYES: Yes, right.\n\nWALSH: The Ryan budget doesn`t even cut the deficit. If you want to\n\ngive massive tax breaks to the richest people, you`re still going to have a\n\ndeficit. Even the level of spending that he is slashing, which is\n\nsignificant and horrible, doesn`t get you down. There`s not -- there\n\naren`t enough of those programs for poor people that they want to slash to\n\nreally make a dent in the deficit.\n\nAnd I think Dick Cheney, you know, ultimately told the truth. Dick\n\nCheney said Reagan showed us deficits don`t matter. Now, he should have\n\nadded a parenthetical -- except when Democrats are in charge, because then\n\nwe say they matter.\n\nBut if we have a Romney administration, the deficit will become -- we\n\ncan`t care about the deficit. We have got to defend the country. We`ve\n\ngot to give these tax breaks. It will just be completely (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNELSON: Here`s the great question, though, I think of this debate and\n\nI hope this is what we actually talk about. The reality is Social Security\n\nand Medicare are programs that we have to reform or they`re in trouble.\n\nSocial Security, Medicare, I don`t believe, will be there for Gen Xers\n\nand Millennials on the track we`re going. I mean, and we`re going to\n\neither have some honestly about this or we`re not.\n\nNow, if I`m the Republicans, I`m saying, look, under George W. Bush --\n\nand you`re absolutely right. He increased deficits. He increased\n\nspending. There`s no doubt about it.\n\nBut he would argue that he had two wars that we were in and that`s --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: (Inaudible) didn`t show up at his door and --\n\nNELSON: -- making a point that they would say that`s why the defense\n\nspending was up exponentially, right. So my point is, in this election --\n\nand I would love to know what everyone thinks about this -- there really is\n\na question on the table, who is America going to be, because, let`s face\n\nit, other countries are growing at a rate of 10-15 percent (inaudible)\n\nwe`re growing at 1 percent.\n\nOur jobs have been shipped away. We don`t have the jobs that we used\n\nto have here. These are things -- I don`t hear anybody talking about --\n\nand this is where the real Americans live and went on, I think they`re both\n\ntrying to talk about it, but I don`t think anybody really has a plan with\n\nhow you brings jobs back for the people --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNELSON: -- shrink deficits.\n\nHAYES: I`m glad you brought up social insurance, which other people\n\ncall entitlements. Social Security is fine, more or less. You can tweak\n\nwithin the margins. Medicare is a genuine problem, actuarily, mostly\n\nbecause of the rise of health care costs and we -- and you were here when\n\nPaul Ryan --\n\nROY: We were here two weeks ago and everyone was saying, oh, this is\n\ngoing to be so great that Paul Ryan is on the ticket. We`re going to be\n\nable to jump on that and show that Republicans are extreme in what is\n\nhappening in the last two weeks. That`s not how it`s played out.\n\nHAYES: Well, what happened in the last two weeks is that -- what\n\nhappened in the last two weeks is that Paul Ryan has gone out and told\n\neveryone, no, no, no, they`re the ones cutting Medicare, we`re the\n\ndefenders of Medicare. That`s what he`s done.\n\nROY: And long-term reforms that will make the program.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: Yes, yes, that`s in the fine text. But the thing he`s leading\n\nwith -- no, the thing they`re leading with is, don`t worry, seniors of\n\nAmerica, we will not cut the social contract for you. So you -- the point\n\nis that they want to have it both ways and this is actually further\n\nevidence of my thesis that they will not cut government. They will change\n\nwho government benefits.\n\nROY: Democrats have set the terms of that debate, right? Democrats\n\nare the ones saying, Paul Ryan is going to push Granny off a cliff, so\n\nRepublicans have responded with a plan that protects current seniors and\n\nmakes long-term reforms. I`m sure that --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And privatizes the program into vouchers.\n\nROY: No, that`s not exactly true.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, but --\n\nNELSON: Sometimes we have to do something about it, is my point. We\n\ncan`t keep having these discussions that we keep taxing one group of people\n\nand not taxing others and we keep believing we`re going to tax our way out\n\nof this. We`re not going to tax our way out of this economic problem we\n\nhave in this country. It`s just not going to happen.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJORDAN: (Inaudible) needs to have a debate and this is what we`re\n\ndoing, but, also, ask yourself, am I better off than when Obama came into\n\noffice? What has government done for me? Will taxes -- this, you know, I\n\nfeel like his rhetoric, his class warfare rhetoric has been really\n\ndamaging. I don`t think it`s a good thing for America.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: One fat cat comment?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One fat cat --\n\nJORDAN: How about the private jets a couple summers ago, that sent\n\nthe jet industry tanking.\n\nHAYES: It did not send the jet industry tanking.\n\n(Inaudible). Can I just establish a fact that is important for this\n\nwhole debate? Taxes as a percentage of GDP, OK? Taxes as a percentage of\n\nGDP on the federal level are at a 60-year low. The last time they were\n\nthis low was in Eisenhower. Americans have it -- the largest --\n\nROY: Because of the poor economy.\n\nHAYES: Not just because of the poor economy. No, no. No, both, it`s\n\na combination of both. It`s both the fact that we have had a succession.\n\nNELSON: (Inaudible) tax base, Chris. Less people pay taxes, 50\n\npercent of the people in this country almost don`t pay taxes.\n\nHAYES: Of course, they pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes.\n\nROY: Income tax (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: Sure, it`s still taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALSH: Do you know why we have the earned income tax credit? This is\n\nexactly what is wrong with the Republican Party.\n\nThat was a Republican idea. Gerald Ford signed it into law. It was\n\nyour party`s alternative to Friedman (inaudible). Milton Friedman --\n\nROY: It`s (inaudible).\n\nWALSH: -- idea. Jerry Ford -- no, it`s not a good idea. Your party\n\nis now committed to slashing it. You pushed women into the workforce. We\n\nslashed welfare. We said we`re going to have the earned income tax credit.\n\nWe`re going to encourage work.\n\nNELSON: (Inaudible) women into the workforce?\n\nWALSH: That`s what happened.\n\nNELSON: What`s wrong with women in the workforce?\n\nWALSH: It`s terrific. It`s terrific. But we slashed the welfare\n\nrolls. We pushed poor women into the workforce. We raised the earned\n\nincome tax credit.\n\nNELSON: Isn`t it a good thing?\n\nWALSH: I`m saying it`s a -- it`s a good thing that we raised the\n\nearned income tax credit and now your party wants to come and snatch that\n\nback, having -- we snatched the welfare. We`ve snatched the welfare. We\n\nsaid, take these low-wage jobs. We`re going to help you out with the\n\nearned income tax credit. You get it because you`re at a low-wage job,\n\nwhich is what our economy --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALSH: But I -- and I -- I know that you have a good heart, Sophie.\n\nWhen you say that --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible).\n\nWALSH: Right. When you say we only -- half people don`t pay taxes,\n\nthat`s what you`re -- that`s part of what you`re talking about. So I\n\nreally think we need to -- yes, that is your party`s idea. You should\n\nembrace it. You should be proud of it.\n\nHAYES: And the Ryan -- you`re saying the earned income tax credit.\n\nWALSH: Yes.\n\nHAYES: And the Ryan budget also -- I mean, the Ryan budget also is\n\ngoing to cut food stamps. It`s going to reduce Medicaid quite\n\nsignificantly. I mean, all those are going to fall on --\n\nNELSON: Who wants to cut food stamps when one in six people are in\n\npoverty? That`s --\n\nHAYES: The Republicans. The Republican Party does.\n\nAll right. Elise Jordan, former speech writer to Secretary of State\n\nCondoleezza Rice, thank you for coming in this morning. I really\n\nappreciate it. We`re going to bring in Corey Robin, who studies the\n\nconservative movement for a living.\n\nMichael, we -- I didn`t -- I`m sorry. I didn`t go to you on satellite\n\nthis whole time. But I want you to stick around because I want to talk\n\nabout the future of the Republican Party in a nation that`s changing\n\ndemographically, after we take this break.\n\nSTEELE: Sure.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: I want to bring Corey Robin to the table, turning the table,\n\npolitical science professor at the Graduate Center of the City University\n\nof New York, author of a fantastic book \"The Reactionary Mind:\n\nConservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin.\"\n\nCorey, it`s great to have you back here.\n\nCOREY ROBIN, BROOKLYN COLLEGE, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.\n\nHAYES: So I want to -- Michael, here`s what I want to talk about.\n\nThe country is changing demographically, obviously, in its racial\n\ncomposition. I think this is a well-known fact.\n\nThe census projection is the country will be essentially only 50\n\npercent white by mid-century. I want to show a chart of the racial\n\nbreakdown of the delegates of the RNC in 2008. We don`t have this\n\nbreakdown yet for this year, otherwise we would show it. But 93 percent\n\nwhite, 2 percent black, 5 percent Hispanic.\n\nNow this is the institutional nature of the party. That`s not\n\nnecessarily if you look at exit polls the way that things break down. This\n\nis about the institutional nature of the party, although Republicans are\n\npolling at about 0 percent in the presidential election among African-\n\nAmericans and down in the neighborhood of 20 points among Latinos and\n\nHispanics around what McCain was.\n\nWhen you see that chart, is that concern for you?\n\nSTEELE: Oh, my goodness, yes. Absolutely. And the fact of the\n\nmatter is, I mean, I remember the 2008 convention and walking around the\n\nfloor and counting 36 African-Americans present. And so, that is not the\n\nfuture of our party because it`s not been our past. And what annoys the\n\nheck out of me is the fact that we forget our past.\n\nWe have something from which to build and on which to build into the\n\nfuture. And now you cobble together or bring together new coalitions of\n\nHispanics and women and gays and the whole cross-section of people who do,\n\nfor a whole host of reason, identify philosophically with our principles\n\nand ideas that Sophia was talking about, on economics, for example.\n\nThat is an opportunity lost when we get in the muck and mire of one-\n\ndimensional politics. When it is a zero-sum attitude towards communities,\n\nit`s not helpful. As chairman of the party, I tried to break that down.\n\nCreated a Department of Coalitions, funded it to a tune of $1 million\n\na year. We built coalitions around the country with the idea of reaching\n\nout -- and I hate that term, per se, but the idea was to touch people and\n\nbe with them where they are. And we had some success with that.\n\nI think that has not been the course that`s been taken since I left,\n\nbut it needs it be, because otherwise, in five years, folks, we go the way\n\nof the Whigs. We become a party that is an permanent minority --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean --\n\nSTEELE: -- with no coalition to rely on for support, nationally or\n\nlocally. We`ll be dead to the electorate.\n\nWALSH: The shocking thing, you know, Pat -- our old friend Pat\n\nBuchanan has this very, very pessimistic book, \"Suicide of a Superpower,\"\n\nand he says the whole country is going away. And the Republican Party is\n\ndisappearing.\n\nBut he had a playbook for 2012 and maybe 2016, where you just double\n\ndown on that white vote. You try to make the electorate look the way it\n\nlooked in 2010, not in 2008. You get the white seniors, keep the young and\n\nthe minorities away from the ballot box. And this -- look, I`m a Democrat,\n\nso on some level it`s all fine with me. My party is going to do better\n\nbecause of what this party is doing.\n\nBut on the other hand, I think it`s really tragic. And I know coming\n\nof age politically in California in the `80s and `90s, there was a real\n\ndebate about where the growing Latino and Asian population was going to\n\nwind up.\n\nThere were real reason to think that Latinos might be -- might listen\n\nto the Republican family values orientation. Asian Americans, Asian\n\nimmigrants were coming from communist countries and they were very hostile\n\nto government. They were not necessarily won over to the Democrats. They\n\nwere driven away by Republicans.\n\nSo that even this year, you know, that awful Pete Hoekstra ad, \"Debbie\n\nSpend it Now with the woman speaking pidgin in a Chinese accent -- the\n\nracism, the common and casual racism that periodically flares up drives\n\npeople away.\n\nROY: Listen, I mean, one, there`s two -- you know, Michael Steele\n\ntalks about how Republicans need to reach out more, et cetera. And\n\ncertainly it`s true that Republicans should reach out more, but there are\n\ntwo sides to this coin.\n\nDemocrats seize on every little thing and gin up racial retirement by\n\nsaying Republicans are racist. Every Republican is racist, every\n\nRepublican policy is racist, free markets are racist, devolving government\n\n--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: I may have heard that in a campus meeting, that free markets\n\nare racist, but national Democrats saying free markets --\n\nWALSH: It`s coded language.\n\nROY: It`s the downstream logic of saying -- cutting taxes is racist,\n\nhaving more free markets --\n\nSTEELE: Well, can I --\n\nHAYES: Yes, Michael.\n\nSTEELE: Can I just address that? Because that, you know, with all\n\ndue respect -- and I really, this disrupts me when I hear that. I don`t\n\nhave time to worry about what the other guy is saying about me if I`m doing\n\nmy job. If I`m defining the conversation, you can talk all day long about\n\nMarxist and racist and how Republicans hate black people because black\n\npeople will know from me how I feel about them.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEELE: The problem is, they don`t, they don`t know that.\n\nHAYES: I want to backfill the history here -- and, Corey, I want to\n\nget your take. There is an amazing little clip of Kevin Philips,\n\nRepublican strategist for Nixon in `68, articulating this very important\n\nstrategic decision the party made, the southern strategy. I want to take a\n\nlook at that.\n\nAnd, Corey, I want to get your thoughts, right after we take this\n\nbreak.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: (inaudible) -- white voters in the South -- am I on? Good.\n\nOK.\n\nCorey, I want to get your thoughts on this because it fits into the\n\nbroader -- the framework that you talk about, about backlash politics as\n\nbeing the kind of through line of conservatism all the way back to Edmund\n\nBurke.\n\nROBIN: Yes. I mean, with all due respect to Michael Steele, it`s\n\ngoing to be very hard for the Republican Party to reach out to African-\n\nAmericans and other voters because it`s part of its DNA, going back to the\n\n1960s, to reverse attack, stall, whatever verb you want to use, the civil\n\nrights movement. That is how it became a majority party.\n\nA lot of times some people think it was the backlash against Roe v.\n\nWade and all those kinds of things. That`s not true. The whole assault,\n\nfor instance, on the Supreme Court from Richard Nixon, 1968, pre-Roe v.\n\nWade, was all about activist courts supporting busing, supporting African-\n\nAmericans. And it`s, like I say, it`s part of the DNA, it`s part of the\n\ncode of the party.\n\nYou just don`t get rid of that without a fundamental overhaul. And I\n\njust don`t see that happening. And it`s telling that the party has to\n\nrevert back to 1860 and Abraham Lincoln. If you have to reach back a\n\ncentury and a half in order to claim your bona fides on an issue, that`s a\n\nsign of a problem.\n\nHAYES: Can I say this? The GOP to 1860 to 1870 was the best party\n\nAmerica ever had. Just so that`s clear. Literally the best party in the\n\nhistory of the country.\n\nROBIN: So try running on that as a (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: Oh, obviously.\n\nROBIN: (Inaudible) tricky.\n\nNELSON: I would be remiss if I did not say, however, that it was\n\nDemocrats, southern Democrats fled the Democratic Party because of the\n\ncivil rights issue and became people like Trent Lott --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: And became Republicans.\n\nNELSON: And so, the Republican Party, I`m seeing this, it flipped\n\npersonalities because Democrats came over.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nNELSON: So let me just be clear about that.\n\nHAYES: The Southern Democratic Party was a white supremacist party\n\nfor a long time.\n\nNELSON: Thank you. You said that; I didn`t.\n\nHAYES: No, I`m that`s just a historical fact. The Southern\n\nDemocratic Party was a white supremacist party for a very long time. And\n\nwhat`s amazing about our politics -- when I`m reading (inaudible) Eric\n\nPohner`s (ph) book on reconstruction right now.\n\nHere`s the 1860 Republican platform, adopted by the national\n\nconvention in Chicago.\n\nThis last line, \"Parties opposed to any change into our naturalization\n\nlaws, any state legislation which the rights of citizenship hitherto\n\naccorded by immigrants from foreign land shall be abridged or impaired in\n\nfavor of giving a full and efficient prediction to the rights of all\n\nclasses of citizens.\" That`s the Republican Party, 1860. More on the\n\nfuture of the Republican Party when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCHRIS HAYES, HOST: Well, from New York, I`m Chris Hayes.\n\nWith me this morning, I have Avik Roy, a Romney policy adviser; MSNBC\n\npolitical analyst Joan Walsh,` author of \"What`s the Matter of White\n\nPeople?\", out in stores now, \"Why We Long for Golden Age That Never Was\";\n\nCorey Robin, author of \"The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund to\n\nSarah Palin\"; Sophia Nelson, author of \"Black Women Redefined: Dispelling\n\nMyth and Discovering Fulfillment in the Age of Michelle Obama.\" We have\n\nthe one and only Michael Steele via satellite.\n\nWe`re talking about the existential core of the modern GOP,\n\nideologically in terms of what coalition of interest it is, in terms of\n\nwhat its demographic foundation is, and we`re talking about race and the\n\nethnic and racial composition of the party.\n\nAnd the fact that, you know, the defining feature of American\n\npolitics for a long time, obviously, was essentially the legacy of the\n\ncivil war and the parties, the modern two-party system as it was created\n\nwas created when the Republicans displaced the Wigs around the Civil War,\n\non -- you know, the abolitionist, as part of the abolitionist movement and\n\nin the wake of that, two parties, Republicans and Democrats. We had that\n\nmore or less since the civil war with progressive party, Eugene Debs and\n\nthe socialist.\n\nBut those have been the two major parties, and they have essentially\n\nswitched entirely in terms of racial composition and the Democratic Party\n\nwas explicitly a white supremacist party during the period of the 19th\n\ncentury in the wake of Reconstruction. It started to change in many ways.\n\nThe New Deal coalition was a remarkable, dexterous ballet act between\n\ngetting a lot of people into a coalition, some of whom hated each other.\n\nBut beginning in the 1960s, there`s what we call the Southern\n\nstrategy. I just want to cue up. This is Kevin Philips who is one of the\n\nmasterminds of what we call the Southern strategy -- Republican strategist\n\nfor Nixon, 1966, talking to NBC`s \"Huntley-Brinkley Report\" about his\n\nvision for the future of the Republican Party.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKEVIN PHILLIPS, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Everybody knows about the\n\ndivision of the north and the south, school boys learn that Maine and\n\nVermont were Republican and Georgia and Mississippi were Democratic.\n\nTV ANCHOR: Would you describe what you call the Sunbelt?\n\nPHILLIPS: The Sunbelt is a demographic and political phenomenon\n\nwhich has become extremely important since World War II. It`s basically a\n\nfunction of a large migration of the American population and a growth of a\n\ntechnological middle class very mobile culture.\n\nJOHN CHANCELLOR, NBC NEWS: Phillips also cites figures showing that\n\nvoters in the big cities are declining in importance. He doesn`t think the\n\nRepublican future lies in the big decaying cities, but rather in the\n\nsuburbs and the smaller towns.\n\nAs for the black voters, Phillips say they may begin using the\n\nDemocratic Party in his phrase, the way the Irish used it, to pull\n\nthemselves up by their own boot straps. As a Republican, he does not see a\n\nplace for blacks in his party.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There it is.\n\nHAYES: That last sentence is pretty intense.\n\nJoan, you basically had just written a book about this moment in\n\nAmerican politics and what is your understanding of how this transformation\n\nhappened?\n\nJOAN WALSH, SALON.COM: Well, it`s really interesting because the\n\nother part of what Kevin Phillips winds up saying, although he says the\n\ncities don`t matter in that interview --\n\nHAYES: The big decaying cities.\n\nWALSH: But he`s also -- he`s from the Bronx, he`s a Bronx boy. And\n\nso, he really has a lot of insight into what he calls the Lawrence Welk-ish\n\nmasses, which was my family watching Lawrence Welk every Saturday, and\n\nreally understands the Catholic sidewalks of New York were also going to be\n\npart of the Southern strategy.\n\nHe very much had a Northern strategy and he saw that the northern,\n\nwhite Catholic ethnics were really coming to identify the Democrats as the\n\nparty of black people and there were a lot, he and Pat Buchanan convinced\n\nRichard Nixon that there was a lot that they could gain in the North, as\n\nwell as the South.\n\nSo, it`s funny to me. I always thought of it as a Southern strategy,\n\nbut it had a Northern component that was every much as devastating to the\n\nDemocratic Party.\n\nHAYES: A large part of that has to do getting back to the backlash\n\ntheory, right? That the civil struggle moved north.\n\nWALSH: Right.\n\nHAYES: I mean, those two things are not --\n\nWALSH: Absolutely. Dr. King goes to Chicago and says that people in\n\nMississippi ought to go there to learn how to hate. He`s pelted with rocks\n\nand children are out there screaming curses. I mean, so, horrible things\n\nwent on in the north.\n\nBut the other thing that I think, you know, liberals sometimes forget\n\nis that it wasn`t all racism. There was a lot of civil disorder, the crime\n\ndid go up, urban riots scared people. I think it`s important to talk about\n\nthe sort of sense of social unraveling that happened that people like Kevin\n\nPhilips and Pat Buchanan were very smart on blaming on Democrats and that\n\nit wasn`t all racism.\n\nI mean, in my book, I look at the fact that my father stayed the\n\ncourse of civil rights liberalism, but my mom who voted for JFK got a\n\nlittle bit more fond of Richard Nixon as we got towards 1972 because her\n\nbrothers were -- one was a cop, one was a firefighter. They were going\n\ninto that decaying, dirty city that was going up in flames and she was\n\nafraid.\n\nI would never say she was racist. Her big claim to fame -- well,\n\nyou`ll love this, Jackie Robinson was a Republican and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nloved Nixon.\n\nSo, she thought she had permission on civil rights ground to vote for\n\nNixon.\n\nCOREY ROBIN, AUTHOR, \"THE REACTIONARY MIND\": You bring up an\n\ninteresting issue which is the law and order issue which was so central in\n\nalliance with the racial issue in 1968, to the birth -- to the rise of the\n\nRepublican Party. I spent last night reading the parts of the Republican\n\nParty draft platform that are available on the web.\n\nAnd what was most interesting to me in that entire document that I\n\nmanaged to read was the section on law and order was this was the blood and\n\nthe guts of the rise of the modern conservative movement. It really drove\n\nthings. If you read the document today, it could have been written by the\n\nSoros Institute. It is so bland, so bloodless.\n\nHAYES: This is progress, though, isn`t it? You say it sort of --\n\nROBIN: No, but my point being is that it shows you the diminishing\n\npower of those Republican --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALSH: I want to disagree with that, though, because we`ve got Matt\n\nDrudge and we`ve got Rush Limbaugh and we`ve got race war over there.\n\nROBIN: The question is, how far can they take it, though?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALSH: -- the \"Drudge Report\" --\n\nROBIN: The question is they wrote that as a majority party. The\n\nquestion is whether or not it is now become --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nAVIK ROY, ROMNEY ADVISER: Law and order was a legitimate public\n\npolicy problem. There was a lot of crime that disproportionately affects\n\nblack people, right? So, the success we`ve had in the last 20 years of\n\ndealing with the crime problem has helped blacks and minorities more than\n\nanybody. Good thing it helps minorities.\n\nROBIN: I`m not debating whether it`s good or bad, my point is that\n\nthis was such a salient issue and it really --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHAYES: Can I say two things as intervention? Michael, I want to get\n\nyour response to this.\n\nMICHAEL STEELE, FORMER RNC CHAIRMAN: Sure.\n\nHAYES: One, is it mass incarceration is now a legitimate social\n\npolicy issue and disproportionately affects people of color. So, we`re\n\ngoing to talk about legitimate policy issues and Democrats have not been\n\ngreat on mass incarceration.\n\nLet`s be honest. They voted for a lot of bills that have increased\n\nmandatory sentencing, et cetera, et cetera. So, that`s one thing to put\n\nout there.\n\nThe other thing though is I went back and read Barry Goldwater `64\n\naddress -- extremism --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In defense of liberties --\n\nHAYES: --in defense of liberty is no vice. And moderation in\n\ndefense of justice is no virtue. And I read that last night. It`s\n\nfascinating.\n\nThe two issues that are the pillars of it are anti-communism and law\n\nand order, and that is not -- there is no real anti -- let`s look at Barry\n\nGoldwater and I will say this before we throw to Barry Goldwater -- when\n\nyou talk about the fact that law and order is legitimate issue, independent\n\nof its racial subtext. The fact of the matter is, it was both a legitimate\n\nissue and also with a candidate who was opposing the Civil Rights Act.\n\nSo, there was a taint there I think from its beginning. Here`s Barry\n\nGoldwater in `64 with that famous clarion call.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, JULY 16, 1964)\n\nSEN. BARRY GOLDWATER, 1964 REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:\n\nRepublicanism so focused and so dedicated not be made fuzzy and futile by\n\nunthinking and stupid labels. I would remind you that extremism in the\n\ndefense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you, also, that\n\nmoderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\n\n(END VDIEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Michael, what`s your sense of the effect of the kind of, the\n\nSouthern strategy, these 30 years later and how the party pivots away from\n\nthe legacy of that, if that is the idea in terms of producing a more\n\ndiverse party?\n\nSTEELE: Well, I`ll be very clear about it, though. When I became\n\nchairman the day I accepted the vote, I declared very emphatically that the\n\nSouthern strategy was officially dead. That the party would shake that\n\ndust from its heels and move forward in a new direction focused on\n\ndifferent things and new communities of people. And that, I think, has\n\nbeen, should be the broader push here.\n\nJeb Bush, for example, I think in recent weeks and I know he`s on\n\n\"Meet the Press\" today and has said very directly that the future of this\n\nparty is not hunkering down and cowering in a corner, but being bold and\n\naccepting that the old strategies will no longer work for us. Our\n\ndemographics are shifting.\n\nInternally, even within the party, you have people that silent\n\nmajority now has and should come forward and speak to those better angels,\n\nif you will, that look at diversity as something that`s not a vice, but it\n\nis, in fact, a virtue for this party. And I think it`s a very important\n\nstep before us.\n\nTo Corey`s point earlier, I would agree with you that this is a long,\n\nhard road that you cannot undo 40 years of craziness. But, however, you\n\ncan take that baby step. The problem with it right now, it refuses to take\n\nthat baby step. It is comfortable in the zone that it is.\n\nOur responsibility and certainly mine as national chairman at the\n\ntime and it remains as Republican. They are not running me out of this\n\nparty because they don`t like me. Deal with me, baby, because I`m not\n\ngoing anywhere. This is something I freely chose at 17 years old to be a\n\npart of because I believed in those virtues and those values that my ma\n\ntaught me that had no label on them.\n\nI decided to put a philosophical and political label on it and call\n\nit Republican because that`s been our root. So, I think we have an\n\nopportunity here with the Jeb Bushes of the world going forward to really\n\nspeak a new language. We have to get through some storms. We have to take\n\nthose baby steps, but they`re important steps for this party to take, if we\n\nwant to survive what lies ahead.\n\nHAYES: Michael Steele I cannot help but note that your prescription\n\nfor fresh blood is Jeb Bush. I don`t know what that means whether he`s a\n\nRepublican Party -- maybe we can reanimate the corps of Prescott.\n\nSTEELE: Wait a minute. Let me be clear. It`s not -- I mean, I get\n\nwhat you`re trying to say with that. But listen to what the man is saying.\n\nDon`t just be so generic and put a label on them. Listen to what he`s\n\nsaying.\n\nHAYES: I`m being snarky.\n\nSTEELE: I know you are, that`s why I love you.\n\nHAYES: MSNBC political analyst Michael Steele, thanks so much for\n\njoining us, really, really enjoyed it.\n\nSTEELE: All right now.\n\nHAYES: More on backlash politics, you guys want to get in there and\n\nI`m going to hear from you right after we take a break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Sophia Nelson, we had to say good-bye to Michael Steele. He\n\nhad some thoughts about his term in the Republican Party, building a\n\nRepublican Party is robustly multi-racial, multi-ethnic.\n\nSOPHIA NELSON, THEGRIO.COM: Two points I want to make. One, Michael\n\nSteele was that first step. Disclaimer, Michael and I have been friends\n\nfor 20 years. We both grew up in the Republican Party when it was\n\ndifferent, although you would argue not that different.\n\nI would say when George Herbert Walker Bush was president, there was\n\na much different climate around racial politics, et cetera, than there is\n\nnow in the Republican Party.\n\nSo, Michael Steele was undercut and this was my position. He was\n\nvery successful as a chairman. He won the 2010 midterm elections. The\n\nbiggest walloping of the Democrats since the `40s and the guy gets run out\n\non a rail, frankly.\n\nAnd like he said on air, he`s not going anywhere, because there were\n\npeople who didn`t like that he wanted to change things. He was talking\n\nabout coalition building.\n\nWhy is that important? Let`s put this in context. We were talking\n\noff camera about policy, incarceration, other issues of importance in this\n\ncountry. Republicans can`t even engage in this dialogue because they`re\n\nafraid of being called racist.\n\nAnd the reason they`re afraid of being called racist is because they\n\ndon`t have anybody that looks like me in elected positions, in high policy\n\npositions. You can`t trot out Condoleezza Rice, who I love, and others\n\nwhen it is convenient for you at the convention every four years and not\n\nhave them in the party.\n\nWho is advising Mitt Romney that`s in a high-ranking African-\n\nAmerican, I`m talking about sitting down in his kitchen everyday, talking\n\nto him about issues that matter to people of color in this country. You\n\nmust have people that reflect the diversity of this culture and they don`t\n\nhave it.\n\nSo, on incarceration issues, like we talked about, what are they\n\ngoing to say? It is a serious issue. But if I`m Mitt Romney, I`m kind of\n\nafraid to talk about the high number of African-Americans. He goes to the\n\nNAACP, he gets booed. He made some good points, but he has no credibility.\n\nThat`s the problem.\n\nROY: Let`s remember that George Romney, his father, marched in the\n\ncivil rights movement. He was a prominent --\n\nHAYES: Yes.\n\nNELSON: That he did.\n\nROY: I think the Romney family has plenty of street cred in civil\n\nrights.\n\nHAYES: But continue the story, continue the story of George Romney,\n\nthat was essentially the moment in which he broke from the Republican Party\n\nprecisely over that. If I`m not mistaken, he doesn`t attend the `64\n\nconvention --\n\nNELSON: He walks out.\n\nHAYES: Yes, he walks out. He attends and he walks out precisely\n\nover the opposition of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nROY: Didn`t walk out of the Republican Party.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBIN: I want to shift back to what you were talking about before I\n\ncame on, about fiscal matters, because I think there`s a different story\n\nthat needs to be confronted for the Democrats. You talked about how we\n\nswitched from the Democrats to being a white supremacist party to now being\n\nthe party of civil rights.\n\nThere`s been another fundamental switch from the two parties.\n\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the Republicans were the party of\n\nbalance budgets, worries about deficits and the Democrats are the party of\n\ntax and spend and in the `70s, the Republicans conservative activists came\n\nto the realization that pushing on deficits was just not going to do\n\nanything. All they were doing, basically, was being the tax collector of\n\nthe welfare state.\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nROBIN: So they came up with the strategy, starve of the beast.\n\nThere was actually John Kenneth Galbraith who first saw what was up with\n\nthat strategy back in the `60s. And basically the strategy was just cut\n\ntaxes and that will force a cut on spending.\n\nNow, it hasn`t happened with the Republicans. They haven`t been able\n\nto cut spending. What has happened, however, is that the Democrats take on\n\nthe responsibilities for austerity. That`s a problem for the Democrats\n\nbecause they, essentially, it`s before the Republicans were the tax\n\ncollectors for the welfare state and now the Democrats are the --\n\nHAYES: Austerians (ph) --\n\nROBIN: -- austerians for the tax cut state.\n\nThis is what Galbraith called reactionary Keynesianism and the\n\nDemocrats are the caretakers of this and so long as we are stuck in that\n\npattern, the Democrats will never be able to break out of the consensus.\n\nThey will always just be the responsible, you know, big parent.\n\nHAYES: I mean, and when you look at the recent history, right, you\n\nget huge deficits, you got big deficits under the Reagan Bush years,\n\nalthough George H.W. Bush does spell his political demise and signs this\n\nbill because of raising taxes and, obviously, Bill Clinton`s first priority\n\nis to balance the budget.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROBIN: And then when Obama passes health care and all the rest of\n\nit.\n\nHAYES: The first budget doesn`t get any -- basically no Republican\n\nvote.\n\nROBIN: So when Obama comes in and starts pushing for things like\n\nhealth care, you know, the fundamental thing it has to be a balanced budget\n\nthing. I have to look at the CBO scores. That`s a fundamental shift on\n\nthe part of the Democratic Party and it puts a real constraint on the kind\n\nof social policies. It means the Democratic Party is essentially an\n\nEisenhower party and it will never move forward in terms of substantive\n\nagenda, so long as that remains the case.\n\nWALSH: I read about this in the book. I mean, Barack Obama, at the\n\nend of the debt ceiling battle, goes in front of the cameras and\n\nessentially brags that he has reduced, he has reduced spending.\n\nROBIN: But at the modern conservative movement, what they did, the\n\ngenius of them was they realized we are on a losing streak so long as we\n\nare pushing for balanced budget. We have to break out and they did and\n\nthey created a new majority.\n\nThe Democratic Party is going to have to do the same thing.\n\nHAYES: Let me say this, nothing points us home more than the way the\n\naftermath of the sequester is being dealt with. Let`s all remember. Debt\n\nceiling deal, two parties can`t cooperate. They can`t find a way to cut\n\nspending and so they lock themselves into this deal, which is if we can`t\n\ncome up with the supercommittee, then each of us are going to experience\n\ncuts from things that we hold dear, the Democrats and nondefense\n\ndiscretionary funding, things for programs for the poor and things like\n\nthat, and for Republicans it`s defense spending.\n\nNow, the supercommittee didn`t work, we`re now headed towards the\n\nsequester, and what do you see?\n\nOne party is very vocally and in fact, there`s a long section in the\n\ndraft platform getting out of the sequester. Not only getting out of the\n\nsequester cuts and the defense spending, right, this was the deal made to\n\nmake sure that people cut spending to get to a balanced budget.\n\nThey are now trying to extricate themselves from it. It`s in the\n\nplatform. John McCain is going on the Sunday shows talking about it, et\n\ncetera.\n\nAnd the Democrats, there`s total asymmetry. You do not see Democrats\n\nrunning around wanting to extricate themselves from their part of the\n\nsequester, because they have become the party --\n\nROBIN: And it was predictable from the get-go when they signed that\n\ndeal. You could have just seen the writing on the wall and they did it and\n\nnow we`re exactly in that spot. And it`s going to affect the Democrats in\n\nterms of, again, their own substantive agenda.\n\nHAYES: Corey Robin, professor at the City University of New York,\n\nand Sophia Nelson, columnist for TheGrio.com -- it`s a really great\n\nconversation.\n\nNELSON: Thank you.\n\nHAYES: Thank you both for coming.\n\nAll right. Cities as fertile ground for the culture wars, when we\n\nget back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: Here are some fun facts about the city you`ll be hearing for\n\nthe next week as the Republicans hold their convention there.\n\nTampa Bay is second in the nation for pedestrian deaths. \"Forbes\"\n\nranked Tampa Bay`s commuting experience the worst among the nation`s 60th\n\nlargest metro areas. And the city itself is only 4.6 people per acre. And\n\naccording to one magazine, it`s the fourth saddest city in America.\n\nA recent article in Salon.com called Tampa \"America`s hottest mess.\"\n\nYet, Tampa is like much of the country. Sprawled out metropolis, low\n\ndensity, low levels of walkability, heavy reliance on automobile transport.\n\nAnd this kind of landscape is a fitting setting for the RNC because while\n\nTampa itself, like other cities voted Democratic in last election, smaller\n\nsuburban centers that look a lot like Tampa make a up the spatial\n\nfoundation of the Republican Party.\n\nOf all the political divides in the country, there are a few more\n\npotent than the world divide. As one look at the county electoral map from\n\n2008 makes very clear -- a sharp political divide by outer ring suburbs and\n\ncities which vote highly Democratic turn basic issues like sprawl and land\n\nuse into culture war proxies.\n\nOne theme the RNC chose for the convention was we built this in a\n\nstadium built with taxpayer funds. In 2011, Florida`s Republican Governor\n\nRick Scott turned down over $2 billion in federal money for a high-speed\n\nlight rail, making him a hero of the right.\n\nTransportation policy means technocratic but a high speed rail has\n\nbecome a highly polarized issue in the Tea Party era, a symbol of left wing\n\ncollectivism and planning, the imposition of density and urbanism on\n\nfreedom-loving suburbanites. It`s a familiar troupe in right wing media.\n\nHere`s Stanley Kurtz, conservative author, speaking with Lou Dobbs on\n\nFox Business about the nefarious liberal plot called urbanism.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nLOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS: It`s an all-out attack on suburbs.\n\nSTANLEY KURTZ, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR: Lou, I was surprised myself and\n\nI have written about Obama`s pas. But what I discovered is Barack Obama\n\nwants to abolish America`s suburbs. That might sound hard to believe, but\n\nfor nearly two decades, Barack Obama has been a huge supporter of a\n\nmovement whose goal is to have city governments swallow up and control\n\nsuburban governments.\n\nThe idea here is to have cities somehow get a hold of suburban tax\n\nmoney. Ultimately, President Obama wants to redistribute the wealth of the\n\nsuburbs to the cities.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: For the land use and regional planning policy section of the\n\nshow, joining us now -- that`s a way to really tease a TV segment --\n\njoining the show now are: Wendell Cox, a senior fellow at the Hartland\n\nInstitute and the Reason Foundation, former director of public policy for\n\nthe American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, we talked about\n\nthat sometimes in the network, now a public transportation consultant.\n\nAnd Michael Bell, an architect at Visible Weather, and professor at\n\nColumbia University of Housing, rejoining us. He recently had an exhibit\n\nthat we featured here on the program, at MOMA, showcasing his work on\n\ncities, including a plan for a development in Tampa --\n\nMICHAEL BELL, ARCHITECH: Temple Terrace, Florida.\n\nHAYES: Temple Terrace, Florida.\n\nLet`s start at the level of -- the most abstract level before we get\n\nam to land use and regional revenue sharing and things like that. It does\n\nseem to me there is a culture war overlay to the political divide at\n\nsuburbanism and urbanism and at some level it`s a kind of preference thing.\n\nyou know, people of a liberal cohort like have to be able to walk to\n\nplaces, and walkability and you`ve written a lot in defense of suburbs,\n\nabout the reasons that being able to drive and having auto dependent\n\ndevelopment is good.\n\nI want to play this clip of a FOX -- a FOX segment about your\n\nredevelopment.\n\nBELL: I was wondering if I could bring that up, but you have.\n\nHAYES: We have it. So, you did this exhibit. The idea behind it\n\nwas -- it was a kind of commissioning a bunch of architects to think of\n\nredeveloping spaces, particular areas that have been hit by the foreclosure\n\ncrisis, which has created vacancy and opportunities for new use to push in\n\na more urbanist, high density, more walkable direction, and you had one of\n\nthe projects and it`s in Tampa and this is how it was described on FOX --\n\nFOX Business.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS: This exhibit is from the elites,\n\ntelling us how we should live. We should all live in cities and if we\n\ndon`t live in cities, we should turn our suburbs into cities. That`s the\n\nway we should live.\n\nIsn`t that the elites going at us and telling us how we are mere\n\nmortals should live?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHAYES: Why are you telling mere -- what is wrong with you? Why are\n\nyou such an elitist, Michael Bell?\n\nBELL: Yes, that was -- you know, the first thing that was really\n\nbrilliant today in terms of getting at this kind of artificially created\n\nculture war, at some point, I know people weren`t seeing it that way. But\n\nI think in this re-urbanization issue or suburbanization issue, there are\n\nartificial divides that are producing this kind of situation.\n\nLow-income housing has been made like market rate housing. It`s kind\n\nof the same techniques with tax credits, meaning how it`s built. So, in\n\nother words, I think really what`s going on with all of this is that\n\ncities, suburbs, inner ring, all getting built through the same financial\n\nmechanisms and the divide of who is elite and who`s not.\n\nBut to answer you more directly, I think it`s artificial. To answer\n\nit more directly, I think where at the situation where what we have is 50\n\nyears of suburbanization, 50 years of urbanization that is reaching the end\n\nof its rein and everybody knows it and I think, so, whether you`re elite or\n\nwhatever you are, somebody is going to get involved in redesigning.\n\nHAYES: Please respond.\n\nWENDELL COX, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION CONSULTANT: Well, one of the big\n\nproblems with the whole movement at the moment so much focus on the central\n\ncity. And, by the way, I admire an awful lot of the new urbanist designs,\n\nand I spent a good deal of time living in Paris and love it.\n\nBut the fact is that the city of New York starts say about New\n\nBrunswick and it goes to Montauk Point, in terms of the urban area, OK?\n\nAnd it goes from New Haven down to Ocean County.\n\nNow, the point is that the city is much bigger than the attention\n\nthat is being given to it at this point. And we need to understand, this\n\ntalk about Tampa in sprawl -- yes, Tampa is fairly normal. It`s right in\n\nthe middle.\n\nAnd we need to understand this whole idea of sprawl. What is sprawl?\n\nIt is nothing more than the organic, natural expansion of the city in\n\nrelation to population growth so that, very quickly finish, that we have\n\nsprawl everywhere in the world except Singapore and Hong Kong where it is\n\nnot possible because the land is already used.\n\nSo that, for example, 100 percent of the growth in European major\n\nmetropolitan areas over the last 50 years has been in suburbs, not central\n\ncities.\n\nMICHAEL BELL, ARCHITECT: It`s not organic.\n\nCOX: Well, we can argue a about that.\n\nBELL: It`s not organic, subsidized by FHA loans and --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCOX: There`s no FHA --\n\nHAYES: Hold on one second. I wanted you to respond to that. We\n\nalso have the mayor of Tampa, who I would like to bring in, right after we\n\ntake a break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: I want to bring in Tampa`s mayor, Democrat Bob Buckhorn.\n\nMayor Buckhorn, I`d like you to start giving us a little update on\n\nwhere things stand with the city`s preparations for tropical storm Isaac.\n\nMAYOR BOB BUCKHORN, TAMPA, FLORIDA: Well, we`re in full preparation.\n\nWe`re implementing any plans we need to implement. As Floridians, Chris,\n\nwe deal with this all the time. This is nothing new to us. This is a\n\nminor distraction as it relates to the RNC.\n\nBut what we have prepped our citizens to do what they normally do to\n\nget their hurricane checklist out. We have sandbags available, if\n\nnecessary. But we don`t think -- but for some wind tomorrow and some rain,\n\nthere will be no tidal surge of any significance.\n\nThis convention, even though it`s delayed a day, which was the right\n\ndecision, I might add -- will go forward and great event for Tampa and for\n\nthe convention.\n\nHAYES: That`s great to hear. I would like your perspective from the\n\nmayor of the city of Tampa. I know that you had some initiatives that are\n\npushing in a kind of, in the way of a lot of the downtown revitalization\n\nwe`ve seen over the last 10 or 15 years trying to create some life for the\n\ndowntown urban core of the city after work hours, et cetera, some public\n\ninvestment in that respect.\n\nHow would you -- why are you pursuing that envision and how have you\n\nfound the politics of that in Tampa and the county around you,\n\nHillsborough?\n\nBUCKHORN: Well, I think it only makes sense, Chris. I mean, it`s\n\nall about the economics. If my two daughters are going to come home to\n\nTampa, Florida, some day and I am able to compete for the best and\n\nbrightest from all around the country, intellectual capital is mobile.\n\nThey`re going to choose to live wherever they want to live. They`re not\n\ngoing to be tied to a location based on a steel plant or an automobile\n\nplant. That intellectual capital is mobile.\n\nAnd those young people either here in this community or who are\n\nlooking to relocate from somewhere else want a city that`s hip, that`s\n\ncool, that`s diverse, that`s welcoming, where there are opportunities for\n\nthem to do whatever it is that they want to do. If they want to write code\n\nall day and skateboard all night, we ought to have that is flexible for\n\nthem. For me -- go ahead.\n\nHAYES: Go ahead. I didn`t want to cut you off. That`s a perfect\n\nsummary, I mean, that`s a 30-second summary of Richard Florida thesis.\n\nBUCKHORN: It is, Chris, but it`s reality. I see the patterns and I\n\nsee who is moving back into our downtowns and the types of people who are\n\ncoming and I see what they want in terms of retail, in terms of amenities\n\nand in terms of opportunities to exercise.\n\nDowntown is where they want to be. I`m not trying to master plan the\n\nworld. I mean, I`m just a mayor. I don`t care if folks want to move to\n\nthe suburbs or not, I think we need those choices. But I think the\n\neconomic engines, certainly in Florida are always going to be the urban\n\nareas and we need to create an environment that encourages that type of\n\ngrowth.\n\nHAYES: Wendell, please.\n\nCOX: I think we all need to be careful about the creative class\n\nthings and Richard Florida, good researcher, had a lot of respect for him,\n\nbut we`re talking about a very small percentage of the people. Let me\n\nsuggest --\n\nHAYES: Let me just quickly lay out the thesis.\n\nCOX: It`s sort of as the mayor indicated, the hip, cool cities that\n\nwill attract the people and all that. The history of urbanization is the\n\nattraction because of jobs and economic growth.\n\nBELL: Exactly.\n\nCOX: Cities do not grow because of fountains and designs.\n\nAnd let me just very quickly defend Tampa. Tampa, we have been told,\n\nis one of the worst places on earth this morning. The fact is, traffic\n\ncongestion is less than average in Tampa, the journey to work trip is less\n\nthan average in Tampa and, by the way, after adjustment for costs, per\n\ncapita income in Tampa is almost as high as New York.\n\nAnd then finally --\n\nHAYES: You`re saying because the real estate is so much cheaper.\n\nCOX: Because everything is cheaper. But the final point is, in the\n\n2000, 280,000 people who moved to Tampa from other parts of the country,\n\nall things being equal, 1.9 million left in New York City metropolitan area\n\nand 1.4 million left the L.A. area.\n\nHAYES: So, if this kind of landscape that we`re describing and if\n\nTampa itself is so desirable, Mayor, why -- why are you bringing your\n\nsocialist agenda to change it?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUCKHORN: Well, you know, I`ve been accused of plotting this\n\nhurricane because I`m a Democrat and now I`m being accused of a socialist\n\nagenda. I am neither. I wish I had that much power.\n\nBut, Wendell, thank you for that clarification. That interpretation\n\nof this great city was totally off base. It is a wonderful place to live.\n\nI`m not trying to engineer any social trends. I`m just trying to\n\ncreate an environment where those jobs of the future, where we can change\n\nTampa`s economic DNA because Florida has been driven by real estate for\n\nyears.\n\nHAYES: Right.\n\nBUCKHORN: It is not a sustainable economy. We have to transition\n\nfrom that mentality to create those value added jobs that will attract the\n\ncreative class that wants to live in the urban areas.\n\nBut you`re absolutely right. It`s not about fountains, it`s about\n\nopportunities. I`m trying to create an environment where there`s\n\ntechnology jobs will help us pay for those fountains.\n\nHAYES: Let me say this, there`s a sort of a political divide, right.\n\nThere`s a kind of cultural divide in the ways that we think of red and blue\n\nin this country and who lives in dense, walkable San Francisco and who\n\nlives at the farthest reaches of the Atlanta metro area.\n\nBut there`s also this cost issue, and I want to get to that right,\n\nbecause dense, urban walkable areas are more expensive and getting more so.\n\nAnd that`s part of the issue. Are the costs right now of living in a place\n\nlike Tampa and living in a place like New York, the natural cost, are they\n\nconstructed by the social policy we have?\n\nMichael, I want you to address that right after we take this break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)\n\nHAYES: That`s a 1970s promotional video for the city of Tampa and I\n\nwanted to match my tongue in cheek critiques of the city with an equally\n\ntongue and cheek endorsement of it.\n\nBut when we get to this issue of cost, because I think that ends up\n\nbeing kind of the big part of it, right? I know a lot of people who say, I\n\nwant to live in, in say Washington, D.C., in the periphery, inside the\n\nurban core of the city that`s dense and walkable. I want to live in New\n\nYork City and people end up living, primarily school and costs are the two\n\nbig reasons.\n\nAnd my question is, are the costs that we have the right costs? Are\n\nwe getting the prices right? Is it a natural outgrowth of the market in\n\nterms of what`s desirable and what`s not, or is there social policy that`s\n\nmaking those costs what they are, Michael?\n\nBELL: I think it is all of these things. Let me turn this down.\n\nIn the Tampa area, in Temple Terrace, where people spending 50\n\npercent of their gross income on housing and transportation, New York City,\n\nthat`s pretty much the same as well. So, the questions of costs can vary.\n\nOf course, people in New York City probably have a higher income.\n\nBut what I think I was trying to get at earlier was regardless of\n\nTampa versus New York or Boston versus San Francisco, et cetera, Santa\n\nMonica or Glendale, et cetera, all of these things are a prototype and\n\nreality when it became a reality that was highly, highly engineered, not in\n\nsome mischievous or overtly devious way. Of course, some of that is in\n\nthere. But it is a set of financial protocols over the history of building\n\nthis country that had a structure and I think cost, et cetera, is now all\n\nin there.\n\nBut cities like New York, of course, global cities, Los Angeles, they\n\nhave incomes, et cetera, that are somewhat global, somewhat local, and they\n\nhave real estate prices that are global and local, and that`s not\n\nnecessarily true for Tampa. That is going to be a crisis in the future as\n\ncities that are attractive for work on a global level and we see this now -\n\n- I mean, New York is part of a constellation, of course, of global cities\n\nmore than perhaps related to Upstate New York, which we all know.\n\nHAYES: Wendell?\n\nCOX: We need to understand the differences in housing costs in this\n\ncountry are largely related to regulation. OK? We have very strong land\n\nuse regulation in New York City area, the Los Angeles area, the Boston,\n\nWashington area, Portland, and Seattle. Their housing prices have gone up\n\nto two or three times over the last 20 or 30 years relative to incomes.\n\nWhere we do not have the strong, very much favored so-called mart\n\ngrowth regulations in places like Dallas, Indianapolis, et cetera, you have\n\nhousing prices that are at their historical norms which all of these other\n\nplaces were until they got this regulation.\n\nHAYES: But the regulation, I mean, in the case of Washington, D.C.,\n\nfor instance, the limit on building signs, right? That artificially\n\ncreates --\n\nCOX: No, I`m talking metropolitan area and Loudoun County which\n\nwon`t allow building on the fringe. What happens when you draw a line\n\naround the city like it`s happened in London or Portland, you force prices\n\nup and that means less discretionary income for households.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBELL: I kind of want to try to find some kind of detente, because I\n\nfeel like it becomes yes or no to things. What I was trying to get at\n\nearlier at the brief conversation on site was, you know, when the\n\nderivative markets started really exporting money into collateralized debt\n\nobligation, I really think it basically was a broad indicator that the\n\nfinancial people also have no real faith anymore in the vehicle that was\n\nholding the debt, meaning housing.\n\nWALSH: Right.\n\nBELL: So, I think --\n\nHAYES: They were trying to get in and get out.\n\nBELL: They were trying to get in and get out.\n\nHAYES: Tampa Mayor Bob Buckner, I`m going to give you the last word\n\non where you see Tampa 20 years from now?\n\nBUCKNER: Well, I see Tampa as first of all the city that`s going to\n\nlead Florida out of the recession. We`re not competing with Chicago, and\n\nNew York and L.A. We`re competing with other emerging Sunbelt technology-\n\ndriven communities. I think south of Atlanta, Tampa is going to be the\n\neconomic engine that drives the Southeast.\n\nHAYES: I`ll be looking forward to the 2012 version of that video we\n\njust played. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, thanks so much for your time. I\n\nreally appreciate it.\n\nWhat we should know for the news week ahead -- Wendell Cox, thank you\n\nvery much. Michael Bell, great pleasure --\n\nBELL: Thank you.\n\nHAYES: -- when we come back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHAYES: So what should you know for the week coming up? As\n\nRepublicans flock to the Republican National Convention in Florida, you\n\nshould know they decided one of the themes of the event is \"We Built This\".\n\nA phrase meant as a swipe at the statement President Obama about the ways\n\nin which collective action, good governance and functional social contract,\n\nundergirded personal individual business success.\n\nWe should know that the stadium in which they will be hosting their\n\n\"We Built This\" theme at the Tampa Bay Times Forum was built in 1996 with,\n\nyou guessed it, government money. The project costs $130 million, of which\n\n$86 million or 62 percent of the total were government funds.\n\nYou should know that the \"We\" in \"We Built This\" is actually the\n\ntaxpayers of Florida.\n\nMassive public money for profitable sports franchises are a national\n\nscandal not limited to Florida. And you should know that when it comes to\n\nsubsidies and corporate welfare for private business, the party of we built\n\nthis at national, state and local levels all too happy to appropriate\n\ngovernment funds to aid private business.\n\nYou should know that former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, was\n\nscheduled to address the Republican National convention this week, and we\n\ndon`t know whether that`s still the case. Now the convention is delayed\n\nuntil Tuesday.\n\nYou should know that Huckabee is the most high-profile Republicans to\n\nrally behind embattled Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin after Akin`s\n\ncomments women about women being incapable of conceiving if they were\n\nvictims of what he termed \"legitimate rape.\" On Friday, on a conference\n\ncall with Southern Baptist, the anti-abortion Huckabee railed against the\n\nGOP establishment, accusing them of acting like goons.\n\nYou should know Huckabee, who has championed Akin from the beginning\n\nof a Senate run has some skin in the game on this issue. As governor or\n\nArkansas, Huckabee appointed his friend, State Representative Faye Boozman\n\n(ph) to head up the state`s health department despite the fact that Boozman\n\nhas said at a rally a year earlier that pregnancy resulting from rape was\n\nrare, because the victim fear triggered hormonal changes that block\n\nconception.\n\nYou should know Huckabee is now leading social conservatives into an\n\nopen revolt over their handling of the Akin issue. So this week could be\n\ninteresting.\n\nAnd finally, you should know that I`ll be part of the MSNBC`s live\n\ncoverage of the Republican National Convention, Tuesday through Thursday of\n\nthis week, from 7:00 p.m. until midnight. Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews,\n\nLawrence O`Donnell, Al Sharpton, Ed Schultz, and a whole bunch of others\n\nwill be part of coverage as well. So, tune in. There will be a whole lot\n\nto talk about.\n\nWant to find out what my guests think we should know for the week\n\ncoming up? I will begin with you, Mr. Avik Roy.\n\nAVIK ROY, ROMNEY ADVISOR: What you should know is that the\n\nRepublican bench was strong. What you`re going to find out this week at\n\nthe convention is that Governors like Marco -- like Bobby Jindal, like\n\nChris Christie, senators like Marco Rubio, these are the rising stars and\n\nthese are names you`re going to be hearing a lot of like Paul Ryan 2016,\n\n2020, 2024.\n\nSo, this is going to be the first convention where we really get to\n\nsee these people at the height of their political prominence.\n\nHAYES: Marco Rubio, he`s not giving the keynote, but he`s giving the\n\nspeech just before Mitt Romney, I believe, introducing him on Thursday\n\nnight if that doesn`t change.\n\nJoan Walsh?\n\nJOAN WALSH, SALON.COM: Well, you should know that the Republican\n\nParty is about 90 percent white, but our panelists today showed us that\n\nthere may be a different kind of future. We ended the week with Mitt\n\nRomney descending into birtherism as a joke. And it`s going to be\n\ninteresting to see if we hope we will see and Michael Steele tells us we\n\nneed to see is going to be on display. We`ll just have to find out.\n\nHAYES: It will be interesting to see how that works out. We talked\n\na little bit about the birther comment yesterday. What is the reaction to\n\nthat, Avik?\n\nROY: I think it was a joke. I don`t know if I would have made it,\n\nbut I think there is a double standard, where Republicans -- Obama made a\n\nlot of jokes about this too.\n\nHAYES: But I think if Barack Obama got up and -- let`s say this: if\n\nBarack Obama got up and made a joke about magic underwear, he would\n\nabsolutely and rightly pilloried.\n\nROY: I think that`s fair.\n\nHAYES: Wendell Cox?\n\nCOX: Let me take the perspective a little bit longer there is a week\n\nafter next week and we need to recognize over the next couple of decades\n\nthe importance of allowing cities to continue to expand and allow housing\n\nto be built that people want. The basic problem is this. If we continue\n\nto draw lines around cities like in Portland, in London, in Vancouver, and\n\nother places, we`re going to force the price of housing so high, as we have\n\nalready, that future generations won`t have the discretionary incomes they\n\nneed to live better than we are.\n\nAnd when you think about the terrible difficulties we have with\n\nrespect to the budget deficit and with respect to paying public employee\n\npensions, it is going to be tough. And we do not need to be increasing the\n\ncost of anything.\n\nHAYES: Let me say this, though. The experience of the housing\n\nbubble is the opposite. I mean, I did a lot of reporting on this in\n\nChicago, and what was happening in Chicago, was there was no developing\n\nline. There was tremendous amount of sprawl at the exurbs and what was\n\nhappening was simultaneously lots of housing was being built and housing\n\nprices were going up. In fact, the housing was being built precisely\n\nbecause people were making a bet that housing prices would go up. So,\n\nthose two did not actually reinforce each other.\n\nCOX: They actually work very strongly together. The largest housing\n\nprice increase is where the regulation was the worst in coastal California,\n\nin Oregon, Washington, and in Florida which is now, thank God, repealed its\n\nsmart growth law. The suburbs of Chicago have very strong, comprehensive\n\nregional planning. The problem is --\n\nHAYES: Not westbound I-80.\n\nCOX: When you say you can only build here, you force prices up.\n\nHAYES: Michael Bell.\n\nBELL: I think the big issue for me, and I think reading the laws\n\nmore carefully, understanding them, not just listening to the convention.\n\nSo, for example, read the 1998 Quality Work and Housing Responsibility Act,\n\ndownload it and read it rather than listening to the Republican or\n\nDemocratic agenda about housing, the language in there is unbelievably\n\naccessible and incredibly interesting.\n\nHAYES: We`ll put it on the Web site. That`s UP`s homework until\n\nnext week.\n\nI want to thank my guests today, Mitt Romney advisor -- Mitt Romney,\n\nthank you for coming -- advisor Avik Roy. Read the next line in the\n\nteleprompter, Chris, MSNBC political analyst, Joan Walsh, transportation\n\nconsultant Wendell Cox and architect Michael Bell -- thank you all.\n\nAnd thank you for joining us. We`ll be back next weekend, Saturday\n\nand Sunday at 8:00 Eastern Time with our coverage of the Republican\n\nNational Convention and preview of this week`s Democratic National\n\nConvention. Our guests will include columnist and radio host David Sirota,\n\nwho`s got a fantastic article on \"Harper`s\", about one newspaper towns.\n\nComing up next is \"MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY.\" On today`s \"MHP\": How do\n\nyou redefine a man running a president for six years? Plus, Republican\n\nwhile black. May not happen often, but it does happen. That and the\n\nshadow party taking over the campaign message?\n\nThat`s \"MELISSA HARRIS-PERRY\" coming up next.\n\nI`ll see you Tuesday night for NBC`s live convention coverage\n\nstarting at 7:00 Eastern. We`ll be back next week here on UP.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY\n\nBE UPDATED.\n\nEND\n\nCopyright 2012 Roll Call, Inc.
