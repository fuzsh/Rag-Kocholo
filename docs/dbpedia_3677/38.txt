A provocative and often surrealist satire of American society, Brewster McCloud is a surprising variation on the Icarus myth brimming with eccentricity and black humor, told as a coming-of-age story about sexual awakening.

It's the utterly bizarre tale of a lonely boy that dreams of flying and spends every waking moment perfecting his own homemade set of wings, despite the dirty cop, the fascist millionaire and the eccentric, high society old lady that try to stand in his way.

A characteristic example of the artistic risks that Altman used to take every now and then, this film heads a special category of small, independently funded and rather unique labors of love that would regularly make their appearance in the director's filmography alongside his more ambitious, awe-inspiring moments. When they were first released, most of them went by unnoticed, but as time went by they gained a strong cult following. L.K.
