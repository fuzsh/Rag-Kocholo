For July, Production Designer Mike Becroft has chosen a hidden gem from legendary American director Robert Altman’s (NASHVILLE, THE LONG GOODBYE, McCABE & MRS MILLER) early career: BREWSTER McCLOUD!\n\nTickets only $10!\n\nHappy Hour drinks from 7pm.\n\nScreening 8:30pm.\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\nStarring Stacy Keach, Bud Cort, Sally Kellerman, René Auberjonois, Shelley Duvall, Michael Murphy\n\nRated R16\n\n105 minutes | Classic\n\nBrewster McCloud (Bud Cort) lives deep within the cavernous underground of the Houston Astrodome, but his dreams rise much higher. He aims to fly. Not in a plane. But with strapped-on wings he’s designing – encouraged by a mysterious woman (Sally Kellerman) who may be his guardian angel. But BREWSTER McCLOUD, Robert Altman’s wild, anarchic cult fave, isn’t about dreams as much as it is about the highs and lows of humanity. It’s a serial-killer mystery. A frenetic car-chase flick. A crazy circus-finale comedy. Shelley Duvall debuts as the tour guide whose seduction of Brewster may lead to his undoing. Ah, love. The thing that at once shapes and unravels us. The thing that may or may not give us wings"
