        "text": "In a key mid-film moment in John Sayles’ beguiling neo-Western Lone Star, a flashback to the early 1970s begins on an image of a film screen at a drive-in showing Black Mama White Mama, a classic about an interracial pair on the run from the forces of law, categorization, and entrapment. The camera skulks down below to the car-bound audience watching the film, a pair of sheriff boots on the prowl to capture another pair of outlaws: two teenagers, the sheriff’s white son and his Mexican American girlfriend enjoying a night of relative freedom watching a movie. In this case, the authority figure hunting the two teens made his name – became a myth in the border town of Frontera, Texas – precisely by rejecting a horridly racist sheriff himself. He is both a frontiersman boldly resisting authority and a specter of his former enemy and the peculiar version of freedom – the freedom to control others, to resist order while sustaining it – that he once stood for, and that defines so much of American outlaw lore. Lone Star asks us to sit with that, with the paradoxes of power and rebellion, with the ambiguities and contradictions of American outlaw culture, with a past that is a multiplex of sensations and memories shot through with false truths and dim presences. It dwells on a history where identities are forged out of cinema-style myths of Americans escaping their pasts, a cinema of the frontier that looms large in the American imagination, a ghost in the machinery of much American violence.\n\nIn other words, Lone Star is a knot in a tangle in a labyrinth, a film whose irresolvable complexity is not the result of any unexpected occurrences in the narrative (although there are plenty of those) but of the intricacy and empathy of its interpersonal curiosity. Like any truly great film, it is defined by its mettlesome texture, upsetting any conclusions we draw on a scene-to-scene basis. Its moral imagination is its ability to delineate human relations and then unravel those delineations even in the act of drawing lines. The past will weigh heavily on the present throughout Lone Star, which continually moves across decades without even cutting, but the present is also loose to itself, containing many overlapping currents and frayed stories that circle around but also unravel its seemingly central mystery – whether one sheriff did, in fact, kill his authoritarian predecessor to take over the job, and what happened to the body – a mystery that is the film’s pretext but not its reason. This film continually implies that whatever resolution it can offer us to that story does little to resolve the pressing problems facing the town in many other tales only being briefly visited. Lone Star is a work of fascinating, beautiful, continual disappointment.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAfter the modernist assault of Saul Bass’ title credits, which abstract and sever a minimalist outline of a human body like an anatomical puppet or an animator’s specimen, backed by Duke Ellington’s bracing, off-kilter jazz score, Otto Preminger’s Anatomy of a Murder throws us a sly curveball. Preminger drops us into a noirish, endless sequence of shots of a car driving through the middle-of-nowhere, slithering on the path to ill intent, seemingly backing up the credit sequence’s promise of nefarious activity underfoot. Except when the driver gets out, it’s Jimmy Stewart, and he’s just been enjoying a leisurely afternoon fishing. And then when Stewart wanders into his unassuming house, a flick of the light switch suddenly reveals a studious, forbidding wall of mighty legal tomes. We get the sense less that we’ve moved from one world to another than that the mise-en-scène has folded multiple layers of existence into one another, layering a chiaroscuro noir on top of a lazy-day comedy on top of a legal drama. This is a man as inviting, and as pungent, and as confusing as an onion, and this will become a film that is interested in casually, continuously peeling, scraping, away at society’s facades rather than giving the audience the satisfaction of a carefully resolved mystery or rushing toward something as superficial as a “guilty” or “innocent” verdict.\n\nAnatomy of a Murder takes its time here and throughout. It never insists on anything, offering a leisurely, observational sidewind through a densely knotted tangle of a crime the film is more invested in walking around and peering at than really untangling. The closest analogue I can think of is Howard Hawks’ loquacious Rio Bravo from the same year, a film that turned the promise of a strenuous, sinewy siege-Western into a loose, go-nowhere hangout picture. Just as surely as that film was a kind of response to the tight-and-trim High Noon (also great), Anatomy of a Murder feels like the anti-12 Angry Men, staging not a masculine juror’s thrust toward the achievement of legal doubt enshrined as a personal moral victory but a complex, latitudinal portrait of loose community layered with decades of history. Certainly, Anatomy has a much nastier bite than Hawks’ laconic oater, but they share an ethos of investment more in the minuscule gestures that define mutual relation than the brutal efficiency of forward movement. While 12 Angry Men can never quite escape the sense that it is moving us to a position we are already, inevitably, primed to support, Anatomy splays out. All while seemingly wasting time with the minutiae of every detail, it secretly, invisibly stabs so many knives into human morality that we can only walk away with our sense of truth having been quietly, almost invisibly pulled out from under us, our hope for what constitutes proper justice melted into a swampy morass of questions and conundrums.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhatever may or may not be true about the demise of the New Hollywood in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, the story practically writes itself, and it certainly helps spice up the films. Michael Cimino’s oneiric Heaven’s Gate, Francis Ford Coppola’s dementedly luxuriant Apocalypse Now and his heartfelt, slovenly One from the Heart, and, of course Robert Altman’s own Quintet and Popeye all went grossly over-budget and wear their exaggerated passions on their sleeves. But, unlike the others, Popeye was nominally intended as populist entertainment! And it is as thoroughly scatter-brained and bedeviling and dumbfounding as any last one of them, a truly suis generis slice of creative hack-work, as perplexing as the crystal Mrs. Miller looks at, searching for an impossible answer to America’s riddles at the end of Altman’s masterpiece McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Much like Coppola’s One from the Heart, it is fundamentally about Great Depression popular cultural, and like One form the Heart, it is absolutely deranged. As with Coppola’s film, it went colossally over-budget producing a set that it could not possibly justify (and yet does!) that was constructed, in Altman’s case, on location seemingly with the intent of evoking a soundstage. Or to serve as Altman’s backdrop for a production-length coke party. From Shelley Duvall’s note-perfect, almost impossibly serendipitous performance as Olive Oyl, to Robin William’s dangerously committed, deliberately alienating turn as the titular outsider who genuinely seems to occupy a different world from everyone else in the film – and because the film is so thoroughly estranging, therefore the same world – this is an absolutely uncompromising dispatch from another cinematic world. It is so feverishly committed to its own disturbed wavelength that it feels like it could have been directed by John Boorman, although probably without the Sean Connery nut-slings.\n\nStill, it’s an Altman film, through and through. Many of Altman’s films were, in one way or another, a dissection of how America related to its own visual and aural iconography, finding (at times accidental) truth in fiction. Popeye, at the time chastised as Altman selling out to the pop cultural lexicon he so often dissected, explicitly tackles a recycled consumer property by name, and under the belly of the Hollywood studio system. Opening on a shot of the animated Popeye, black-and-white, speaking directly to the camera, informing us that he’s “in the wrong movie,” the film smash-cuts to a stormy seaside town as “A Robert Altman Film” appears overhead, usurping the titular character’s authority with a decidedly different breed of central figure. Popeye initiates itself by dissociating itself from the fiction audiences might expect, already foregrounding disharmony and hinting at the difficulty, even the incomprehensibility and delirious idiocy, of making a live-action adaptation of E.C. Segar’s comic franchise and the Fleischer Studios animated cartoons at the end of the 1970s. The introduction is a direct descendant of Altman’s Brewster McCloud, where the iconographic MGM lion roars with the audio replaced by René Auberjonois’s “I forgot the opening line,” another confrontational fiction-breaking abnormality and a promise on Altman’s behalf that the story we expect has been distorted and defanged.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nRumble Fish is plainly the product of a director who had been bruised and humbled. After producing at least four genuine cinematic classics during the 1970s, the near-death experience of making Apocalypse Now, an exercise in cinematic self-flagellation that wanted nothing less than to both channel and contest the very warp and woof of the world,did nothing to quiet Coppola’s ego, which went on to just barely stabilize the remarkable, unfeasible, impossible flop One from the Heart. Reigned in but not daunted, Coppola looked to the aspirations and dreams of his children to make a pair of S.E. Hinton adaptation The Outsiders, which certainly conjured images of his own youthful days. The evocative but nonetheless straightforward The Outsiders was Coppola on guard, proof that he could – for the moment – play ball. But Rumble Fish, his second Hinton adaptation in the span of a few months, was something else entirely. Forced to domesticate himself, to play house with the corporations, he became a termite, gnawing away at the wood from the inside. Working as a director-for-hire turned into a secret, sideways passion project, a buckling of the man’s Ahab-like desire to conquer the cinematic machine becoming a quieter rebellion, a tacit conspiracy with the machine itself. Rumble Fish reaffirms that art, even swallowed by the very belly of the beast it once tried to destroy, cannot be killed.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe famous opening of Federico Fellini’s 8 ½ visualizes auteurism – the notion that a director is an Olympian artist singularly responsible for their film – as a psychic and cosmic trap, a road to nowhere as everyone around watches you suffocate. They’re immobile, unhelpful figures in a dreamlike haze trapped in the Gorgon’s glare. Of course, as the film finally reminds us, if Medusa is a metaphor for the world’s horrors (as Siegfried Krakauer famously notes in his 1960 text Theory of Film, just a few years before Fellini’s film) and art is Perseus’s shield allowing us to glimpse the horror and move beyond it. But Fellini insists that art itself can also immobilize. In 8 ½, it is the director himself who won’t let the world and its people move. They can’t help him because he isn’t receptive to their energies. That the film itself amounts to both a validation and an excoriation of its own inability to heed those energies is, depending on your view, its central failing or its greatest success. 8 ½ is a masterful work, no doubt, but it’s also a grand-standing testament to artistic mastery as a form of artistic limitation. Personal responses may vary.\n\nThe auteur in question is Guido Anselmi (Marcelo Mastroianni), who we meet in the middle of a bout of director’s block on a film that has already had a rocket-ship of money poured into it, but has no screenplay. Guido is both an aspirational portrait of a director as ringmaster and channeler of the world’s energies and a tacit admission of guilt on Fellini’s part. He remains too caught up in his own ego to, as it were, release, too lost in his thoughts to let the film really feel. It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to make us spend 140 minutes, and to stake your directorial reputation, on an elaborate metaphor for erectile dysfunction.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAt the beginning of Head, Monkees’ drummer Micky Dolenz runs away from a legion of fans and dives off a bridge into a body of water. If this is too-obviously following in the footsteps of its prankish predecessor, A Hard Day’s Night, where the Beatles suffered a similar crowd-sourced fate, it also blows it to smithereens. Rather than canonizing the ‘60s, Head offers a comeuppance, jumps into the deep end of the next decade, dissolving into an aqueous, collective, diffuse space called the early ‘70s.\n\nSoon enough, the band performs the phenomenal, acid-stained rocker “Circle Sky,” a mission statement of the band’s newly serious attitude toward their music that ultimately unweaves itself in the very act of coming into being. If the song promises progress, a band achieving new heights of self-worth and self-ownership, the lyrics offer a vision of eternal return that culminates in fans rushing the stage only for the band to be crumble as mannequins, material constructs of composite parts, all image and no flesh. Rather than personal authenticity, the film explodes into gleeful mediation, a promise that ostensible freedom only masks new modes of control, that genuine originality is only one more mask. Head marked the band announcing their recovery of their own catalogue as an exercise in self-becoming, and in doing so they paradoxically destroy themselves. We’re off to the race in the opening minutes, in other words, but we’re also lost in an abyss. In the band’s go-for-broke stylistic tour-de-force, they go beyond playful monkeying around and instead monkey wrench the nuts and bolts of the machine that made them.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nCharlie Chaplin was one of Hollywood’s earliest and largest stars, a filmmaking polymath who performed, directed, composed, produced, and wrote all of his films, a one-man brand who in Modern Times subjects himself to a possibly fatal question: whether he can escape being branded by the hot iron of capital. A British socialist who grew increasingly frustrated with American capitalism and Hollywood business practices throughout his career, he eventually left Hollywood and returned to his native England. Like many silent filmmakers, many of his earlier films explore questions of new technology and skeptically arouse the possibilities of modernization, thinking-through the relationship between new technological forms – both industrial and cinematic – and asking how one navigates modernity. Of course, many of his anxieties about industrial technology were also motivated by his own issues and frustrations with the rapidly growing Hollywood industry, exposing parallels between industry on-screen and industry in Hollywood that seem more prevalent in Modern Times than in any Chaplin film before or since. This is the film in which the personal will displayed in The Kid – where his Tramp character strategically manipulated capitalist products for new purposes with his mental ingenuity – seems to have been finally overpowered by capitalism’s singular ability to manipulate his body as the ultimate tool to its own ends.\n\nChaplin’s most famous character – the Tramp – was easily identifiable to most Americans, brandishing his top-hat and cane and what would be called the Chaplin mustache. The style of his earlier films tended to emphasize the homeless Tramp as an unmoored figure who had no place in society and had to creatively adapt to survive, refashioning everyday objects from their normal purposes in the swirling, fluctuating world of modern capitalism where, as Karl Marx said, “all that is solid melts into air”. His most famous silent comic rival Buster Keaton tended to fashion his films as linear trajectories, placing his character on train-tracks, moving forward on the way to modernity – locomotives shooting into a technological future – depicting characters who struggled to control these modern-day technologies. Keaton fashioned comic parodies of success narratives in the American tradition, mocking the idea of individuals pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. Chaplin’s Tramp, comparatively, has no bootstraps, and as an iconic vision of working-class resourcefulness, did not traverse space linearly or pull himself up; his comic movement was much more unstable, much more slippery, much more uncertain. He fashions capitalism as something which requires comic creativity to survive. This is why Chaplin’s definitive visual symbol is the circle, his characters frequently forced to run around and around with no end, suggesting that capitalism was not a pathway toward future opportunity but a centrifugal and chaotic uncertainty.

Their second feature Raising Arizona is, on the surface, its diametric opposite, a harried, maniacal fracas of disheveled lunacy and Southwestern loneliness. That latter film has, more or less, paved the way for many of the Coen Brothers’ more famous features, inaugurating their reputation as the pied pipers of modern artful screwball. But Arizona shares two central components with its predecessor despite Blood Simple’s reputation as the wild card in their canon. Tones aside, both films are mordant, fiendishly cunning grasps of dour, melancholic tragedy, both comedies-of-loneliness. And both are acid-washed images of people in need of an escape hatch. The sheer surfeit of mood aside, Blood Simple frequently feels like a premonition of the Coen Brothers’ entire career. Considering Blood Simple reveals the crestfallen image of a destitute US and stunted, criminally miscommunicating people that skulks, almost subterraneanly, within the notionally-chipper heart of many of their later films. Continue reading →\n\nI’ve been away for so long … Here’s a holiday classic to re-inaugurate the site.\n\nFifty two years later, Bill Melendez’s first television special adaptation of Charles Schultz’ Peanuts comic strip remains not only the most unshakably apprehensive, despondent animation in the entire series but the most unmediated, direct transmission from Schultz’ famously depressing comics so palpably informed by middle-age anti-nostalgia. Critics are extremely fond of slippery-slopes about “adult” Christmas cinema. They turn every minute flicker of violence or filigree of naughty language into a claim that their favored Christmas adaptation is the one that truly harbors darker thoughts about the holiday spirit lurking around the corners of its thought. They defend everything form Die Hard to Gremlins to Lethal Weapon – seemingly every circumstantially-Christmas-set film released in the ‘80s – as emblematic of a more perverse Christmas sensibility of merry travesty. This curdled, nasty sentiment that uses Christmas as a victim to beat with its own candy canes has since blossomed further into a typically cringe-inducing glut known as Christmas horror cinema and more overtly bad-tempered lumps of coal like Bad Santa. Continue reading →\n\nY Tu Mama Tambien is inauspicious, but like many great films, it reaches for and touches the world and humanity in everyday actions and seemingly small gestures. Here, for instance, we have teen sexuality, laid out with all its romanticism and reality, filled with the kinds of empty-but-meaningful gestures that define humanity’s desires and their foibles. Director Alfonso Cuaron is a highly personal director, but he’s always most interested in defining his characters in relation to the world they inhabit. His two protagonists here are immature and petty yet deeply human, reflections of a society that won’t admit it has given birth to them and which they, initially, want no part in. He gives us a profoundly human story, built on the eternal humanness of sex as a marker of adulthood and childishness, and given life by Cuaron’s wonderfully and contrapuntally painterly version of sloppy, slovenly reality.
