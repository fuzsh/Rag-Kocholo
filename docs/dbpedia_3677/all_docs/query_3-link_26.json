We got a few retweets, a few kind comments, a few shares on Facebook. But reader Robert Boyd was less than thrilled with our selections.\n\nIn what universe is Robocop 2 (or Reality Bites or Urban Cowboy) a great movie? Have some shame. At least add Brewster McCloud and Paris, Texas to the list.\n\nOne reader, who only signed in as \"Guest,\" was also annoyed that Brewster McCloud had been forgotten.\n\nSeriously? No Brewster McCloud?!?! Also, worth mentioning; My Best Friend is a Vampire.\n\nThe Robert Altman gem was left off the list because I don't know why, but we'll keep it in mind the next time we make a list of Texas movies for sure."
