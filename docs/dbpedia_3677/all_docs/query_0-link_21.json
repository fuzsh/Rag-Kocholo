        "text": "Brewster McCloud (1970) is one of the least well-remembered films by its director Robert Altman, and doesn’t even top most folks’ lists of movies that feature its star Bud Cort (surely they think primarily, perhaps exclusively, of Harold and Maude and M*A*S*H). But (beyond whatever virtues the movie possesses as a work of cinema) Brewster McCloud deserves to be celebrated and cherished for giving the world Shelley Duvall (b. 1949).\n\nDuvall was a local Houston girl who crossed paths with some crew members from Brewster McCloud when it was shooting in the area. They saw what we all see — an ethereal, sweet, innocent-seeming creature with huge, doe-like eyes, a toothy (and frequent) smile, and a lithe, willowy body not out of step with her background as a nutritionist. Altman loved her, gave her a part in the film, and then made her a prominent part of his stock company for the next decade.\n\nAfter McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), Thieves Like Us (1974), Nashville (1975), and Buffalo Bill and the Indians (1976), Altman then elevated Duvall to lead status opposite fellow Texan Sissy Spacek in 3 Women (1977). Duvall’s performance won several awards and made her briefly a marquee name. A small but memorable role in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall (1977) was her first big-screen performance outside the Altman-verse. (Paul Simon, her romantic partner at the time, is in the film as well, surely not a coincidence). She also played the title character in a 1976 PBS adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s Berenice Bobs Her Hair, directed by Joan Micklin Silver.\n\nThen in the period 1980-81 came three films, each of which on its own might have caused a seismic career shift — as it happens, they combined to accomplish same:\n\nFirst, she played Olive Oyl in Altman’s Popeye (1980). Now, as then, it seems like perfect casting. Those long, rope-like arms and legs flailing all over the place, the querulous voice and forever worried nature. To this day, people associate Duvall with that role. The trouble arrives when people look at her and see ONLY Olive Oyl. And trust me: casting directors, producers, and audiences can all be precisely that stupid. In 3 Women she had actually been attractive. (Duvall had the alchemical ability to seem beautiful or homely as the need required). But in terms of attractiveness, Olive Oyl is no Betty Boop. I happened to like the movie a great deal when it came out, and was startled to realize later that it had been a flop, one in a string of several that made Altman a pariah for a while in Hollywood. Things shifted and Popeye wound up being the last Altman movie Duvall would appear in. One wishes the association had lasted just a bit longer because doesn’t she BELONG in Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982)? I mean, come on! It’s practically written for her!\n\nSecondly, and most famously, she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 screen adaptation of Stephen King’s The Shining. Film fans don’t regret her presence in this modern horror classic one iota. Her performance is one of the most memorable things about it; she’s the character we identify with and root for. BUT…it was a traumatic experience for the actress, having to remain in that overwrought, worked-up state, weeping and screaming 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for over a year. Big clumps of her hair fell out. The experience had to have turned her off to the process of film-making in a major way. One could forgive her if she had never set foot in front of a camera again.\n\nBut then (thirdly), she had a small, entertaining part in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981), a wonderfully magical film which gives a palpable reality to characters of legend and lore. It proved a perfect pivot point to this:\n\nImagine the public’s delight when Duvall reinvented herself as an auteur in her own right. While over the next decade she continued to take supporting roles in films by major directors like Tim Burton, Steven Soderbergh, Jane Campion, and Guy Madden, she would EMPLOY others such as Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Medak, Nicholas Meyer, Roger Vadim, and Michael Lindsay-Hogg as executive producer of Shelley Duvall’s Faerie Tale Theatre (1982-87) on Showtime, a series which she also hosted and occasionally narrated and starred on.\n\nThe stars seemed truly aligned for this project. Not only was Duvall’s gentle sensibility perfect for children’s entertainment, but her quirky eccentricity and humor was a lure to more sophisticated audiences. In some ways the show was reminiscent of Shirley Temple’s Storybook, which had run on NBC 1958-61. As an all-star anthology series and an instant classic it also reminds me of such things as The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. And as with Batman, there was a campy dimension that seemed to attract every major talent in Hollywood. Looking down the list of episodes its hard to believe this magical thing actually happened. Herve Villechaize as Rumpelstiltskin! Paul Reubens (PeeWee Herman) as Pinocchio! Carrie Fisher as Thumbelina! Christopher Reeve as Prince Charming (that’s even better casting than Superman)! Harry Dean Stanton as Rip Van Winkle! Jeff Goldblum as the Big Bad Wolf! Eve Arden as Cinderella’s Stepmother! Vincent Prince as the Magic Mirror! Dick Shawn as the Emperor Who Gets New Clothes! Leonard Nimoy as an evil wizard! James Earl Jones as a genie! An all-black Puss in Boots written by Jules Feiffer and starring Ben Vereen, Gregory Hines, George Kirby, and Brock Peters!\n\nTwo other notable writers on the series included Anne Beatts from SNL, and MaryEdith Burell from Fridays. There were lots of folks from those two shows who appeared on Faerie Tale Theatre who were hot at the time, some of whom subsequently fell by the wayside, making the show an interesting period piece from that perspective, as well. From Fridays, there were people like Mark Blankfield and Michael Richards; from SNL, Laraine Newman, Don Novello, Jim Belushi, and Tim Kazurinsky. I know it seems like I’m just making a lot of lists, but honestly I have barely scratched the surface. There is MUCH buried treasure down there.\n\nFor a while Duvall had a bit of a storytelling empire going on. In addition to Faerie Tale Theatre, there were Shelley Duvall’s Tall Tales and Legends (1985-87), Nightmare Classics (1989), Shelley Duvall’s Bedtime Stories (1992-93) and the stand-alone telefilms Popple (1986), Frog (1987), Mother Goose Rock and Rhyme (1990), Mrs. Piggle Wiggle (1994), and several others.\n\nThe 1994 Northridge Earthquake understandably spooked Duvall, and she moved back to Texas at that time, although she continued to take occasional screen roles through 2002. Then, after only 22 years in the business, she retired to private life.\n\nIn 2016 an older, greyer, plumper Duvall re-emerged on Dr. Phil, followed by several news articles that seemed to contribute to a narrative that she was mentally ill, possibly a dementia sufferer. (Note: she was only 67 at the time of the Dr. Phil appearance). Later accounts counteracted that inflammatory story and seemed to indicate that she was just fine. After all, hadn’t her image ALWAYS been one of a woman who was flighty, distracted, spacey? Ever since she was in her 20s? She’s a hippie chick! I mean, come on! She spells “fairy” like a character from The Wicker Man! Cut her some slack! I mean, after all, it’s not like she’s running for President of the United States!\n\nOop.\n\nSee what I did there?\n\nI, uh…I’ll just….\n\n(skulks away)"
