        "text": "(Gray News) - Actress Shelley Duvall, known for her work with director Robert Altman and her role in “The Shining,” has died.\n\nDuvall died at her home in Blanco, Texas, due to complications from diabetes, her longtime partner, Dan Gilroy, confirmed to both Hollywood Reporter and Variety.\n\n“My dear, sweet, wonderful life, partner, and friend left us last night,” Gilroy said in a statement. “Too much suffering lately, now she’s free. Fly away beautiful Shelley.”\n\nShe was 75.\n\nDuvall’s first screen role was in Altman’s 1970 film “Brewster McCloud.” She would continue to work with Altman for several more films including “McCabe & Mrs. Miller,” “Thieves Like Us,” “Nashville,” “Buffalo Bill and the Indians,” and “Popeye.”\n\nDuvall won a Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her role in Altman’s “3 Women.”\n\nOne of her most notable roles is as Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel “The Shining.” Duvall played opposite Jack Nicholson as the wife of his character, Jack Torrance, as the couple endured the winter in the isolated Overlook Hotel with their young son.\n\nJust as notable as her performance was the grueling conditions she underwent during the shooting. Duvall herself reported the shooting pushed her to her limit. In an interview done in 1981 with PEOPLE magazine, Duvall said Kubrick had her “crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end.”\n\nVariety reported some of her scenes required more than 100 takes. The notorious baseball bat scene even landed in the Guinness Book of World Records for most takes of a scene with dialogue.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Duvall produced a series of children’s anthology shows including “Faerie Tale Theatre,” “Tall Tales & Legends,” “Nightmare Classics” and “Bedtime Stories.”\n\nDuvall retired from acting in 2002, returning to her home state of Texas.\n\nFollowing her retirement from acting, Duvall lived a fairly reclusive life. She did make an appearance once in 2016 on “Dr. Phil,” in which she opened up about her struggles with her mental health.\n\nDuvall returned to film recently in the 2023 horror film, “The Forest Hills.”"
