What) Hungry Horse dams the south fork of the Flathead River forming the Hungry Horse reservoir. Its wall is built between a narrow canyon with a height of 171.9 m (564 ft) and was the fifth highest in the world when construction ended on July 18, 1953. The dam's crest is crossed by a 39 foot roadway.

Where) The damsite is in the Flathead National Forest in Flathead County, 15 miles south of the west entrance to Glacier National Park and 20 miles northeast of Kalispell, Montana. 4 miles off highway 2. Turn left On West Side Road (AKA National Forest Development Road 895) just before entering Hungry Horse.

Why) For many years, I had a strong desire to see Hoover Dam in Nevada. I finally got there in 2008 and I thought that would be it. But, after reading the description of Hungry Horse Dam in the CAA guide book, I realized that my desire to experience the majesty of a massive dam had not been quenched.
