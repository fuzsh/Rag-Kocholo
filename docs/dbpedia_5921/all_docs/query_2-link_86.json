        "text": "Its name alone is enough to pique your curiosity.\n\nEvery year, thousands of tourists visit in northwest Montana.\n\nThis year, because of COVID-19, the Visitor Center at the dam is closed.\n\nBut Bureau of Reclamation staff members are still welcoming visitors outside the center.\n\nNBC Montana met guides Tosha Lawrence and M'lissa Morgan on a hot August afternoon.\n\nNot far from Glacier National Park the dam is situated in one of Montana's most beautiful areas.\n\nM'lissa showed us a panoramic view of Hungry Horse Dam from the overlook.\n\nFrom this vantage point it's almost overwhelming.\n\n\"The dam itself is 564-feet tall,\" said M'lissa. \"It is about 21-hundred feet long.\"\n\nBoth M'lissa and Tosha can reel off facts like this, and can provide a detailed history of the dam.\n\n\"We're wearing masks when we're around other people,\" said Tosha, \"trying to social distance, encourage others to do the same, and get the questions they want answered.\"\n\nLooking down on this massive structure can make you dizzy.\n\n\"I get my share of visitors who don't want anything to do with the edge,\" said M'lissa. \"I have others that are quite dare devilesque.\"\n\nAs they peered across the dam from the walkway Adam Priquette and his son Pierce told us about their fascination with dams.\n\nThe father and son are from Manhattan, Montana, and have taken family vacations out-of-state.\n\nBut this year they are staying close to home.\n\n\"The biggest dam we've been on is Hoover Dam,\" said Pierce, \"which last year we went on before COVID.\"\n\n\"This year we've done Fort Peck,\" said Adam. \"We're doing Hungry Horse and we've already seen Yellowtail in eastern Montana. We're on our way to Libby Dam.\n\nTosha said Hungry Horse has three main purposes.\n\n\"Flood control, and with that, some water storage for drought and fire,\" she said. \"Then there's hydro-electric power and there's recreation.\"\n\nThe 34-mile long Hungry Horse Reservoir on the South Fork Flathead River above the dam is a popular recreation site in all seasons.\n\n\"You get a lot to look at,\" said M'lissa, \"a lot to appreciate. You have the natural landscape.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation built the dam in large part to prevent floods that had devastated much of the valley.\n\n\"Cities like Kalispell, Somers and Bigfork,\" said M'lissa, \" were getting inundated by floods fairly regularly and fairly intensely.\"\n\nThe dam creates energy for hydro-electric power administered by the Bonneville Power Administration.\n\n\"That goes all the way to the Pacific Ocean through a series of other dams,\" said M'lissa.\n\nPreparing a path through the Flathead National Forest and rock to make way for the dam was a huge, dangerous job.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1948 workers built an access road and dug a tunnel to divert water.\n\n\"That all had to happen,\" said M'lissa, \"so that they could get this space clear and dry so that they could reinforce the bedrock.\"\n\nConstruction began in 1948.\n\nIt was Post War America.\n\n\"They got people from all over the country,\" said Tosha. \"Most of them were veterans from WWII.\"\n\n\"In 1952 they started generating power,\" she said, \" and they had a dedication ceremony that Truman attended. And he was the one that flipped the switch.\"\n\nThe dam was completed in 1953.\n\nDuring the entire project 23 workers died.\n\nM'lissa said few of them died from actual construction.\n\n\"A lot of them were logging related,\" she said, \"or rock fall deaths. There were a few machinery- related deaths too.\"\n\nTowns grew to accommodate the workers.\n\n\"Martin City and Hungry Horse,\" she said, \" are products of the dam.\"\n\nHere at the dam you may be struck as to just how much was accomplished and how many milestones were achieved.\n\nM'lissa showed us the emergency spillway or \"Glory Hole.\"\n\nAt 500-feet down it's the deepest one in the world.\n\nAt seven stories, said M'lissa,\" the power plant was once \"the tallest building in western Montana.\"\n\nSo what's the story of the name Hungry Horse?\n\nWell, it goes back quite a few years before there was a dam.\n\nIn the winter of 1900 and 1901 two railroad horses, Tex and Jerry, were stranded in the wilderness.\n\n\"They were eventually found,\" said Tosha. \"But they had to be fed before they could be let out of the canyon. So they were called The Mighty Hungry Horses.\"\n\nA fitting name perhaps, for a mighty dam."
