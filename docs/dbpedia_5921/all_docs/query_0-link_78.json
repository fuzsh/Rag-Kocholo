        "text": "Before Your Cell Phone There Were Yellowstone Postcards\n\nPostcards were a way to communicate news of your exciting adventures with family and friends. Yellowstone Park was a favorite travel destination. Prior to the invention of cell phones - before digital communication became the standard - a visitor to Yellowstone Park who wanted to send a souvenir postcard to family and friends would need something to write with, stamps, and access to a United States Postal Service (USPS) mail drop.\n\nConstruction of the Montana State Capitol\n\nLocated in Helena, Montana, the state capitol building was dedicated on July 4, 1902. It underwent a major expansion a decade later, and continues to serve as the home of Montana state government. The story of its construction is full of controversy and rivalry between Montana towns.\n\nCrossing the Missouri on the Fort Peck Reservation\n\nThe Lewis and Clark Bridge located near Wolf Point, MT is one of the largest, if not the largest, structure on the Fort Peck Reservation. Although it is known by all local residents, its history and prehistory is not as widely known. This bridge stands unused as a remnant of both.\n\nEarly Montana Trading Posts, Dry Goods Stores, and Mercantiles\n\nFrom early trading posts to simple dry goods stores, to the large mercantile, stores have evolved to meet the needs of the people of Montana. They began very simply and have evolved as populations grew and supplies became available. Many different groups of people and workers have benefited from trading posts, dry goods stores, and mercantiles.\n\nFloods in Lewistown: A Walking Tour\n\nLewistown was incorporated in 1899. Located at the geographic center of Montana, the area surrounding Lewistown has good grazing land for livestock, and nearby mountains which tempted early ore prospectors. The discovery of gold in the mountains led to a rush of growth, while sheep ranchers swarmed the good grazing land, and soon the railroad ran through the city. But floods have been a problem in Lewistown since the early days of the city. There are waterways winding around, through, and even under the city limits.\n\nFort Missoula Alien Detention Camp During World War II\n\nIn 1941, the facilities at Fort Missoula were turned over for a period of 5 yrs from the Army to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). It was established to hold foreign nationals and resident aliens. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese communities were raided and men were taken into custody to be tried in “Loyalty Hearings.” Fort Missoula Alien Detention Camp held 2200 Italian and Japanese detainees throughout the time it was opened.\n\nHistoric Buildings of Butte: A Walking Tour\n\nVisitors to Butte today are struck by the massive open copper pit dominating the skyline - the Berkeley Pit, one of the nation's largest Superfund sites. But visitors who choose to explore the streets of Butte are rewarded by the sight of many historic buildings, little changed from their original construction a century ago.\n\nHistoric Buildings of Great Falls: A Walking Tour\n\nGreat Falls, one of the largest cities in Montana, was incorporated in 1888 as settlers began to spread out across the vast open spaces of the Montana Territory. The inspiration for the city's name was a series of large waterfalls on the Missouri River, which originates south of the city before winding east and then south to join the Mississippi. Great Falls' position on the Missouri made it a natural hub for shipping commerce, and it was also a railroad hub. Dams on the Missouri provided power, and nearby mining raw materials were smelted in the gigantic \"Big Stack\" smelter which was completed in 1908 and stood as an iconic landmark until 1982.\n\nHistoric Buildings of Kalispell: A Walking Tour\n\nThe city of Kalispell, located in scenic northwest Montana, has its roots in the railroad. The town was founded in 1891 along the route of the Great Northern Railroad, as the railway wound its way to the Pacific Northwest. Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the nearby communities of Ashley and Demersville served as local hubs, but Kalispell and its proximity to the railroad changed everything in the area. The town grew along with the railroad, as did many local industries.\n\nHistoric Buildings of Virginia City: A Walking Tour\n\nThis digital exhibit combines historic photography of Virginia City dating back to the 1860s, with historic architectural surveys performed in 1990 and updated in 2022. In this way, you can see the buildings as they were long ago, read about their history and construction, and take a look at how they appear today.\n\nMissoula and the Railroad: A History in Photos\n\nDid you know…that the Milwaukee and Northern Pacific Train Depots and lines near Missoula were used for such diverse activities as those photographed below? This exhibit contains photos of the railroad in and around Missoula in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nNative American Boarding Schools in Montana\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Native American tribes had been mostly confined to reservations. Their nomadic lifestyle had been curtailed, and they found themselves living a difficult existence. Food was scarce, and poverty was rampant. To further erode the Native lifestyle, the government, in conjunction with religious organizations, developed the concept of Indian boarding schools. The first of these opened in Carlisle, PA in 1879. The concept was the brainchild of Brigadier General Richard Pratt. The essence of the Indian boarding school was cultural assimilation, boiled down in a phrase Pratt coined: \"Kill the Indian, Save the Man.\" To accomplish this, children were taken from their parents and often moved hundreds of miles from their home to live and attend school at a boarding school. Government funding enabled religious schools to function. Every essence of Native culture was stripped from these small children, and they lived difficult lives full of school, prayer, work, punishment, and hunger.\n\nOld Faithful: Now and Then Virtual Tour\n\nYellowstone - the world's first national park - is known to many as the home of Old Faithful. This geyser, which erupts regularly to huge crowds, is now the center of a large hub of buildings, walkways, and parking lots. The buildings themselves are also historic, dating back well over a century. This virtual tour of the Old Faithful area focuses on 3 specific locations: the geyser and surrounding boardwalk, the Old Faithful Inn, and the Old Faithful Lodge.\n\nUniversity of Montana Campus: Now and Then Walking Tour\n\nThe campus of the University of Montana sits in a picturesque spot, surrounded by the town of Missoula, soaring mountains on all sides, and the rushing waters of the Clark Fork River. Construction on the campus began at the tail end of the 19th century. Most of the buildings on campus are much newer, but a few old structures remain. What was once an empty, open field is now a bustling campus, crowded with buildings, cut through by roads, and brimming with trees in every direction."
