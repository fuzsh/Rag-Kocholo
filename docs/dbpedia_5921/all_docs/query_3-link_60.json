        "text": "Overview\n\nHungry Horse, Montana offers you the chance to really experience a wonderful western town in the northwest part of the state. Take a break and try out a huckleberry milkshake, famous in this region.\n\nLocation\n\nHungry Horse is only 9 miles south of the western entrance to Glacier National Park, on US Highway 2, in northwestern Montana.\n\nServices/Amenities\n\nThis small town has a couple of great restaurants where you can stop for a meal. Grab a pizza for lunch or get some real home-cooked food to sustain you for the rest of your journey.\n\nLodging in Hungry Horse is known for its hospitality and affordability. Get a rustic cabin with scenic views, stay at a guest ranch or move into a comfortable hotel or motel. You’ll find a convenient Bed & Breakfast is also a great place to stay.\n\nActivities\n\nHiking\n\nOn the Great Northern hike, you will do an out-and-back 8-mile trek through timber and along goat trails. You’ll need to be well conditioned for this hike. The scenery is spectacular. Find a number of trails within Glacier National Park too, for more adventure. There are even more trails available in the national forests and wilderness areas surrounding Hungry Horse.\n\nWhitewater Rafting\n\nSouth Fork Flathead River offers up some incredible paddling, and there is plenty of Class I river to navigate. Before you tackle the Class III and IV rapids of the Meadow Creek Gorge, however, you must be an expert. Other parts of the Flathead River also offer up Class II, III, and IV rapids for those who want to have an exciting adventure in Montana.\n\nFishing\n\nFishing the Hungry Horse Reservoir will provide you with lots of trout, and best of all, a breathtaking backdrop, with the mountain peaks towering above. From May through the month of November is the best time to catch cutthroat and whitefish.\n\nBoating\n\nOn the Hungry Horse Reservoir, you’ll find 10 boat ramps that give you access to the water, and you can actually boat in to some of the campgrounds surrounding the reservoir. If the water is low, try the Abbot Bay ramp, which is the longest on the east side and can get you into the water. Lost Johnny Point is on the west side and is also a long ramp for low waters.\n\nAttractions\n\nHungry Horse Dam\n\nTour the Hungry Horse Dam to see this – the tenth highest dam in the United States. At the visitor’s center you can also see interactive exhibits and learn about the dam’s construction.\n\nInternational Larix Arboretum\n\nThis arboretum, although small at 1.2 acres, is worth a visit. There are 600 trees of different species. View the European Larch, Japanese Larch and Subalpine Larch trees.\n\nGetting Here"
