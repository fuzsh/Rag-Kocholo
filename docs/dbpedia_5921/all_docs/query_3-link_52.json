        "text": "Hungry Horse Reservoir, or the “Rez”, is a spectacular meandering body of water that seems to go on forever – over fifty miles in fact – before it reaches Spotted Bear on the upper South Fork of the Flathead river. Along the way are truly unique Montana camping and boating experiences that are wild, yet accessible by car and boat. A combination gravel and asphalt road circumvent the Reservoir, so you can make a real adventure of exploring the whole thing.\n\nThe “Rez” is one of the locals’ favorites for swimming, camping, motor boating and water skiing, boat-camping, fishing, SUPing (stand up paddleboard), Huckleberry picking, mushroom hunting, firewood getting and views, views, views! Check with the Flathead National Forest about campground reservations before heading out. Stop in to the Hungry Horse Liquor Store and we’ll stock you up and send you on your way!"
