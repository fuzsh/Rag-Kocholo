        "text": "\"Here come the tourists, with their blank stares, with their fanny packs, they are penny millionaires.\n\nSomething interesting happened here long ago, now where people used to live their lives, the restless come and go.\"\n\n- Greg Brown, \"Boomtown\"\n\nHUNGRY HORSE - Late October, tourists gone, half the stores shut up for the season, barstools half empty.\n\nThe north wind unfurls in the canyon, sweeping down from the big peaks of Glacier. The South Fork of the Flathead, free now of the concrete harness of the looming dam upstream, whispers by on the low end of town. Snow falls across the face of Columbia Mountain.\n\nIrene and Vaughn Shafer settle into the wood-fired warmth of their living room, tucked behind their little highway-side tourist shop, the Hungry Horse Corral.\n\n\"Well, you know, we keep the door open all winter, so if people want to come in they can,\" Vaughn says. \"Make a little money, have a little company. The town needs to have a few open doors.\"\n\nAcross the road, the Rocky Mountain Nature Co. is closed. So is Old Timer's Auction, Dick Taylor's place. Odd and Unusual Gallery, locked up. The Log Cabin Bar is shut down, too, but that's two years now, not just for the season.\n\nBut across the street at the Dam Town Tavern, the last bar left from the town's glory days, the bartender is serving noontime drinks to two-handfuls of regulars. Raymond Toole, he's retired now, long career in the military, is having a few beers.\n\nHe's related to Joseph Kemp Toole, Montana's first governor. That and a dollar will get you another beer.\n\nJust down the bar is Jenner Baden, keeper of the only British accent in town. Jenner's a Maori, a transplant from New Zealand. He may be the only man at the bar with his own Web site - painteroftheglaciers.com. He gained a measure of international renown years ago with paintings of the South Pacific, but he has a \"mystical\" connection to Hungry Horse and Glacier.\n\nHe once told a reporter that home is where you hang your hat. No longer true. Home is here.\n\n\"I came home to die,\" he says, an impish smile on his dark face.\n\n\"Jenner's the best,\" Raymond Toole says into his beer. \"He's the best painter ever.\"\n\nJenner smiles. Can't paint anymore, can't see. Macular degeneration. He sees best from the corners of his clouded eyes.\n\n\"I wish I could see you,\" he says to a visitor. \"I see your smile.\"\n\nThe signs on both ends of town tell the story - \"Friendliest Dam Town in the West.\"\n\nHere is the proof.\n\n\"I'd love to see your paintings,\" the visitor says.\n\n\"Why don't you go on down to the gallery, it's just down past the post office,\" Jenner says. \"Just go on in, the door's open, the light's right inside the door. Just find a print you like and take it. You can leave me a note, tell me which one you got.\"\n\nHe waves his hand, a wizard casting a spell.\n\n\"These are the people of Hungry Horse,\" he says. \"Let me buy you a drink.\"\n\nHungry Horse is the sort of Western town that no longer makes sense. Born in the boom, then essentially abandoned. If it weren't on the highway to Glacier, it might well become a ghost town.\n\nIt's already haunted. By the past, its history as a boomtown. By its present, by the sense that the world is always passing its meager charms by, by a paucity of economic opportunity.\n\nAnd by its future, which seems as limited as the town's slivered footprint in Bad Rock Canyon.\n\n\"It's a good town, but there are a lot of issues to resolve for the town to keep moving ahead,\" says Dee Brown, who represents the state House district that includes the town. \"There is nothing going on up here in the winter, and I mean nothing. It's mostly a summertime economy.\"\n\nHungry Horse is a town born of water, bounded by the Middle and South forks of the Flathead. It's the South Fork, of course, that literally brought the town to life in the mid-1940s.\n\nBefore then, the townsite was little more than a wide place near Jim Hill's Great Northern Railway. Through the early part of the century, a handful of small developments rose up along the railway - Citadel, Belton, Red Eagle, Walton. The railroad eventually changed the names of those places to their modern names - Coram, West Glacier, Nyack, Essex - but they still didn't amount to much.\n\nCharlie Green's history of the canyon notes about 30 families living in the entire Canyon - loosely defined as the 40-mile stretch between Bad Rock Canyon and Essex - around 1920. And that population suffered when the great fire of 1929 swept through the canyon, destroying their homesteads.\n\nBy 1930, however, what was commonly known as the \"tote\" road had been improved enough to become Highway 2, connecting Seattle to St. Paul by way of Glacier Park. When the park's Going-to-the-Sun Road was completed in 1933, the tourist boom, which would pale slightly during World War II, was on.\n\nThe 1930s also heard considerable discussion of a dam in the northern Flathead, and Hungry Horse's genesis came in the backlash to a proposal to increase production on Kerr Dam near Polson. The country was hungry for hydropower, but that proposal would have inundated about 50,000 acres in the valley, according to Kathryn McKay's, \"Looking Back: A Pictorial History of the Flathead Valley, Montana.\"\n\nA number of sites were surveyed, but the canyon of the South Fork was picked, and in 1944 Congress approved the dam.\n\nArlene White grew up in Kalispell - she was a Wagner back then. When the dam talk surfaced, her father, Albert A. Wagner, and another man, Marion Smith, bought the old Whitestone homestead in what is now Hungry Horse. Then they subdivided the land along the Middle Fork, calling the development Wagsmith.\n\nWagner and Smith were part of a small group of speculators in the Hungry Horse/Martin City areas, and by most accounts, the men prospered.\n\nThe scope of the dam project virtually assured that they would. More than 2,500 people worked either on the dam or on the massive logging project to clear the hillsides that would later be swallowed by the reservoir.\n\nIn all, about 90 million board feet of timber were cleared along the 45-mile-long swath of would-be reservoir.\n\nAs people flocked to the area for the work, Martin City and what would be become Hungry Horse roared to life. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built what was known as \"Government Town\" in the flat below the South Fork canyon, but a move was also under way to develop \"Dam Town\" along what is now the main thoroughfare of Hungry Horse.\n\nAccording to the Hungry Horse News, the paper established by Mel Ruder in Columbia Falls, Dam Town had a grocery, barber shops, land office, tavern, cafe and plans called for \"a $40,000 theater, service stations, … drug stores, a dress shop, a freight office and a cafeteria with a 100-foot front.\"\n\nIn the 1940 census, the Hungry Horse had no population. But by 1950, more than 1,300 called the area home.\n\nMartin City, just up the highway, mushroomed to 3,000 people by 1947, with 53 different businesses, including at least 10 bars and a brothel called Mabel's. Although reports vary, the Canyon supported at least 30 bars, and one of the most popular extracurricular activities was trying to run what became known as the \"Trap Line.\"\n\n\"You had to have a drink at every bar to run the Trap Line,\" Jenner Baden says. \"It took a helluva man to run the line.\"\n\nArlene White was working at the Grand Coulee dam in 1949 when she decided to return to Kalispell. She walked into the Job Service office on a Friday afternoon and by Monday was working the steno pool at the new dam.\n\nShe rode to work in an unheated bus from Kalispell, a blanket in her lap. The work was just that: work. But what she saw in the towns surrounding the project was far more compelling.\n\n\"This had been a place that really hadn't existed as far as people were concerned,\" she said. \"Now it was just bustling. Every other building was a bar.\"\n\nWhen the dam was finished in 1952, it was the fourth largest concrete dam in the world. Three million cubic yards of concrete. Five hundred and sixty-four feet high, 2,115 feet at its widest. Big enough for the president himself, Harry Truman, to come out for the opening.\n\nThe reservoir behind is nearly 35 miles long and 3 1/2 miles across at its broadest. In places, the reservoir is 500 feet deep, and it holds more than 3.5 million acre-feet of water. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons of water, enough to cover an acre of land to a depth of one foot.\n\nThe dam's primary purpose, according to facility manager Ralph Carter, was and is flood control. It's not as simple as that, of course, but that is the mandate.\n\nThe dam is, in effect, an evolving mathematical equation, where the variables are weather, downstream water levels, fish, power generation and recreation.\n\n\"Flood control has to take precedence,\" Carter says while showing a visitor around the dam. \"We have agreements about a lot of other issues, but the main thing is flood control.\"\n\nWhile the dam creates a host of interesting issues both down and upstream, most have little effect on the day-to-day life of the town below. Construction of the dam required workers of every sort; now the dam is run by a small number of people - Carter can't say how many because of new security rules imposed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks - with specialized and technical skills. Few live in Hungry Horse.\n\n\"We've cut back (on employment) a lot over the years,\" Carter said. \"Part of that is controlling costs inside the bureau, and some is better technology. It just doesn't take as many people anymore.\"\n\nTrue enough for the dam, and true enough for the town. By the time the census takers came through town again in 1960, the population of Hungry Horse had slid to about 300.\n\nThe boomtown was busted.\n\nKate Foley is the last of the nine children born to Tom and Jay Foley, who moved to the Martin City area in 1946. Tom Foley was a logger and had been since he was a teen-ager on the eastern coast of Canada. Foley was a partner in the FK&L Lumber Co., and he and Jay eventually put together 260 acres of land in an area called Abbott Valley.\n\nThe Foleys lived through both boom and bust, making good money as the reservoir area was logged out, but eventually declaring bankruptcy when the small lumber company could no longer compete with industry giant Plum Creek Timber Co.\n\n\"The thing that probably stands out the most from that time is that the three communities - Martin City, Hungry Horse and Coram - were all their very own little economic entities,\" says Kate Foley, who returned home to help manage the family property in 1997 after 18 years in the Seattle area. \"Each town had a fire department, a school, a grocery store. All those things in each little town. It made them seem like real places. It was all about the dam.\"\n\nBut no more. In the daily life of Hungry Horse, the dam means almost nothing. It matters, of course, to state and federal biologists who study and manage the surrounding fisheries. It matters to regional power managers, who understand the mathematical equation that connects the dam to the rest of the Columbia hydropower system.\n\nIt matters, a little, to the people who use the reservoir for fishing and recreation.\n\nAnd it matters, in some small way, to the folks whose shops line the highway through town.\n\n\"Oh, maybe a few people come through wondering about the dam, so we tell them all about it,\" says Irene Shafer. \"But most people, they don't even know it's up here. They're just going to Glacier Park or Flathead Lake. The dam's just some place off the road to them.\"\n\nIrene and Vaughn Shafer came to town in 1963, and Vaughn worked at the aluminum plant in Columbia Falls. Irene worked for the post office in both Columbia Falls and Hungry Horse, and they lived in what used to be the VFW bar. Vaughn, who laughingly calls himself the unofficial mayor of town, once found a full whisky bottle buried in a flower bed outside the building.\n\nThey later bought a little gift shop, the Hungry Horse Corral, along with the copyright on the carvings of Blake Morris, the former Montana Highway Patrol officer who whittled the town's mascot, the little red Hungry Horse.\n\nToday, you can get your very own hungry horse there, complete with the legend of the real hungry horses, Tex and Jerry, who were lost from a pack string in the South Fork in the fall of 1900. They were found gaunt and emaciated.\n\n\"That must be a hungry horse country up there,\" a local sage noted.\n\nPostcards of the dam, books about the Flathead, molds of the faces of Blackfeet elders and other assorted tourist trinkets line the Corral's walls. Buy something, or just talk to Vaughn and Irene, who bring the ring of truth to the \"Friendliest Dam Town\" sign.\n\n\"Oh, they're never closed, unless they're in bed,\" says their friend, Arlene White.\n\nOr you can walk across the street to the Dam Town Tavern, have a cold beer and listen as the old-timers talk about the Trap Line. You can wonder about a town where so many people are sitting in a bar at noon, drinking away their Social Security checks, but that won't get you anywhere.\n\n\"Well, it's a strange little town where pretty much anything goes,\" says Arlene White. \"We've got our share of poverty, and we're sort of last in line for everything in Flathead County, but it's still the best place for me.\"\n\n\"It'll do for me, too,\" says Vaughn Shafer.\n\n\"I like it, but there are lots of things we could do to make it better,\" says Irene, who's something of an activist. \"There's nothing that's going to come save us, though. We've got to do it ourselves.\"\n\nAnd that is the central truth of Hungry Horse: The dam made the town. It won't save it.\n\nAnd so.\n\nThe children who live in Felony Flats are trudging up the street to Canyon Elementary School in the season's first snow. A handful of folks wander into the Corral and get Vaughn Shafer's lessons on the merits of the Green Bay Packers.\n\nPeople are getting their firewood in. Do some hunting, maybe. They're going to Kalispell and Columbia Falls to work for whatever wage they can get. They're stopping by to pick up the mail, the Social Security check, the military pension, the letter from the kids who moved away.\n\nThey're going up to the Baptist Church, which used to be the Club Rocco when times were good. Or maybe down the street to the Assembly of God.\n\nThe dogs are wandering around outside the Dam Town Tavern.\n\n\"It's like it's always been,\" Jenner Baden says. \"These are the people of Hungry Horse. Dam Town.\"\n\nOn a cold, cloudy evening in late October, a faintly ethereal light glows over the ridges that face the home of Kate Foley and John Helton.\n\n\"It's like looking at city lights, where it never gets quite dark,\" Foley says. \"It took awhile to remember what it was.\"\n\nThe dam glows in the canyon, its lights ablaze, the massive turbines whirring, the river below like roiling green pearls. From the town below, the dam is far away and dark, invisible.\n\nReporter Michael Moore can be reached at 523-5252 or at mmoore@missoulian.com.\n\nYou must be logged in to react.\n\nClick any reaction to login.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
