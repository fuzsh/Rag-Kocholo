        "text": "Overview\n\nNot far from Kalispell, Montana, and close to the western entrance to Glacier National Park, you’ll find the marvelous Hungry Horse Dam and the reservoir formed by its construction. This is the fourth largest and the highest dam (564 feet) in the world.\n\nLocation/Directions\n\nTo get to Hungry Horse Reservoir Montana, simply take US Highway 2 north from Kalispell. It’s about 20 miles. There are a number of forest roads that will be your access points. Forest Road 895 takes you along the reservoir on the west side and takes you over the dam. The contact information is: Flathead National Forest at 406-758-5204.\n\nSeasons\n\nAlthough the Hungry Horse Dam, Montana is open the year round, the fishing season is typically from May through November. The rest of the time, the weather dictates any access.\n\nActivities\n\nFishing\n\nWhen the South Fork of the Flathead River was blocked by the construction of the dam, the fish began to use the Hungry Horse Reservoir as their home to reach maturity. You’ll find rainbow and hybrid cutthroat populations, as well as bull trout, Westslope cutthroat and mountain whitefish. The inlets and bays around the shoreline of Hungry Horse Reservoir offer some great fishing.\n\nFishing seasons: Although open year-round to fishing, the best time for fishing on the Hungry Horse Reservoir is from May through November. If you want to take tours of the dam as well on your trip, you should visit from June to September.\n\nBoating\n\nWith 10 boat ramps along the reservoir, you won’t have trouble with a launch. The longest ramp is on the east side of the reservoir, Abbot Bay. The longest on the east side is Lost Johnny Point.\n\nHiking\n\nBordered by some incredible wilderness areas, such as the Great Bear Wilderness, hiking offers wonderful adventures in the backcountry.\n\nWinter Sports\n\nWhen the snow comes, you’ll find the area around Hungry Horse gives a landscape for endless play. Take time for some great snowmobiling and cross-country skiing on 200 miles of groomed trails.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe Hungry Horse Dam, MT got its name from some sleigh horses that got lost in a severe winter of the early 1900s. They were found after a month, starving and weak, and in need of much care to nurse them back to health. The name Hungry Horse was used for a mountain, lake and creek, as well as the project of building the dam and the dam itself."
