        "text": "Located on the southwest shores of\n\nHungry Horse Reservoir are a couple\n\ncamp spots that are free. We stayed at\n\nForest Creek Campground. You will\n\nsee a sign saying Forest Creek Road.\n\nAbout a hundred yards north is an\n\nunmarked road that leads down to\n\nthe lake and you can camp right on\n\nthe shoreline. It is an official camp\n\nwith a notice of 14 day limit.\n\nThe complete loop around Hungry Horse\n\nReservoir is over 100 miles of mostly dirt\n\nroads. It is hard to find free camps along\n\nthe lake shore.\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nHwy.2 about a mile east of Hungry Horse\n\nSign pointing to Hungry Horse Dam.\n\nForest Creek Road is about 40 miles.\n\nThe road to the camp is about 100 yards\n\nIt is kind of rough and narrow, might walk\n\nthe road first if any doubts.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThere are more good camps with less people\n\nat Coal Creek Bridge. If you take the road up\n\nthe west side of Glacier National Park, Coal\n\nCreek is about half way to Polebridge. There\n\nis a sign as you cross the bridge, but you\n\nwouldn't know there was camping allowed\n\nunless you pull off the road, then you'll see\n\nthe grizzly bear warnings."
