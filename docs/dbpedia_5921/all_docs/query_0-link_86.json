        "text": "While our favorite national park (spoiler alert: it’s Glacier National Park) is open year-round and you are always welcome to visit, we feel like we need to tell you something: there’s so much to see outside of Glacier National Park. To help make the most of your time in and around Kalispell, we’ve rounded up not-to-be-missed Montana views that will make you think you’re in a national park.\n\nFlathead Lake and its islands. The largest natural freshwater lake in the West, there are endless jaw-dropping views of Flathead Lake. You can cruise the lake in its entirety with a loop tour on U.S. Highway 93 (west shore) or Montana Highway 35 (east shore) and take advantage of scenic pullouts along the way or you can get out on the water through a private boat tour, guided kayak tour or with your own watercraft. The lake is home to numerous islands, some of which are public lands (like Wild Horse Island State Park) while others are privately owned.\n\nDistance from Kalispell: 10 minutes (9 miles)\n\nHungry Horse Reservoir. Sitting in a beautiful canyon on the South Fork of the Flathead River near the town of Hungry Horse, Hungry Horse Reservoir is 34 miles long and stretches into the Flathead National Forest. There’s plenty of room to explore, camp, hike, swim, boat and fish. Pro tip: if it’s busy at the start of the reservoir, keep driving on either the west side road or east side road (note: there is a temporary closure on the east side road July 15-August 12, 2024) and you’re sure to quickly be in an area with no one else around. During the summer, the Hungry Horse Dam Visitor Center is open daily from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. and offers guided walking tours. Find details on tours here.\n\nDistance from Kalispell: 20 minutes (20 miles)\n\nThe Summit of Big Mountain. Located on Big Mountain, Whitefish Mountain Resort offers phenomenal 360-degree views of the Flathead Valley and Glacier National Park. On clear days, rumor has it you can see into Canada. The summit is accessible by hiking trails or you can catch a scenic chairlift ride up to the top.\n\nDistance from Kalispell: 30 minutes (22 miles)\n\nJewel Basin. Directly east of Kalispell in the Flathead National Forest is Jewel Basin. This 15,000-acre area is ideal for hiking, camping and fishing, with more than 20 lakes located in the Jewel Basin. There are abundant day hikes in the basin and you’ll be rewarded with views and quiet moments, as no motorized traffic or bikes are allowed. Dogs are allowed on trails in national forests, if they are leashed.\n\nDistance from Kalispell: 45 minutes (27 miles)\n\nHolland Lake and Holland Falls. A scenic dirt road off of Montana Highway 83 will take you to Holland Lake and the Holland Falls National Recreation Trail. Hike the trail to Holland Falls and take in the sweeping views of the lake below, the waterfall and the surrounding mountain peaks that stretch into the Flathead National Forest.\n\nDistance from Kalispell: 1 hour, 15 minutes (75 miles)"
