        "text": "Description\n\nCommercial property for sale on prime highway 2 East frontage in Hungry Horse. Formally used as a restaurant, the current owners have put a lot of love and hard work into this property. However, they are now ready to retire and let someone else pursue their dream. There are so many possibilities with this building. Boasting 3180 square feet with a pristine commercial chef's kitchen this property is move-in ready and waiting for you to bring your vision to life. There are 3 bathrooms including one that is ADA compliant. You could revert part of the building back to a house to live in while you use the remaining part of the building for your business. Road access to the back of the building offers you additional parking and a huge yard. Only 10 miles from the entrance of Glacier National Park and a few minutes from the Hungry Horse Reservoir, this building is in the heart of an outdoor recreational paradise!
