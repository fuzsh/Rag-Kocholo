        "text": "Visit the Hungry Horse Dam and Reservoir just fourteen miles from Glacier National Park and 4 miles from Mountain Meadow RV Park and Cabins. With a height of 564 feet, the Hungry Horse Dam is the largest concrete dam in Montana and the eleventh largest in the United States. The sole purpose of the dam, located on the South Fork of the Flathead River, is to prevent spring flooding and create power. From Highway 2, head southeast down the West Side Road to arrive at the visitor center, dam, and reservoir.\n\nThe visitor center operates from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day, 8 am to 3 pm, and offers free interpretive talks to those who are interested in learning more about the Dam and Reservoir.\n\nThere are many hiking trails around the reservoir, but Lion Lake is a favorite among locals. When driving from Highway 2 towards the Dam, you'll pass by Lion Lake. Park your car at the East of West Entrance, and enjoy the scenic loop trail. Don't forget about bear safety!"
