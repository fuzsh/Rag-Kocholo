        "text": "Come Ride Our Trails!\n\nWe are truly blessed with some incredible terrain and trails here in northwest Montana. The FSA maintains and grooms three trail systems in the Flathead Valley. Over 200 miles of trails are groomed regularly.\n\nNew this year, we have partnered with Trail Treker to provide our maps electronically on your Smartphone. The GPS-enabled map is loaded into the Trail Treker app (one-time $2 purchase) and you will get all three maps free of charge with your paid membership to the FSA. Normally each map is $2, so you are getting a $6 value! By using Trail Treker, you can always see exactly where you are on the map (without cell phone coverage); the entire map is cached on your phone and there is no need for phone or data service while on the trail. You can also record your ride paths, distances, speeds, and points of interest while on the trail. Trail Treker and the electronic maps will be available October 1st.\n\nIf you want to check out the maps now, just download the PDFs below for any of our maps.\n\nREMEMBER! You need a Trail Pass to ride Montana Trails. Every dollar collected for trail passes goes into trail maintenance. Scroll down for more info!\n\nAnd if you are riding up on State Lands (Olney / Fitzsimmons / Upper Whitefish areas), you need to have a valid Montana Conservation Tag (for every person age 12+). Click here to purchase a Conservation Tag. This is only needed if you ride on/thru the State Forest.\n\nCanyon Creek / Desert Mountain\n\nRiding the back of Big Mountain, this trail system has some of the best on and off trail riding available in the area. A spur trail will also take you to the top of Big Mountain where you can have lunch at the Summit House run by Whitefish Resort.\n\n​Desert Mountain is a fun day or half day ride. When clear, you can see all the way to Big Mountain and down to Flathead Lake from the top of the mountain. A second trail loops through wilderness terrain with some spectacular vistas. There are no services/restrooms on this trail.\n\nOther Info and Links\n\nAvalanche Beacon / Transceiver Reviews - Good unbiased information. We recommend that all persons riding our trails wear a beacon--you may not ride off trail, but there are slide areas on/around our trails. Click Here to View Site\n\nTrail Maps- Members, when you join or renew, you get a code to three of our maps in Trail Treker! For more info on Trail Treker, how to get the app, etc., go to our About Page and scroll down to the Trail Treker info section.\n\n​Groomer Tracking - Members, when you join or renew, you will get an email with the link to this year's welcome package (that has the link to the Groomer Tracks). This feature is members only--we feel it's only fair that members who support the club get the latest info. We upgraded to Garmin inReach safety and tracking devices in both groomers in the Whitefish Range. So you with the link you get, you can see both groomers tracking on one map (online). We hope you like this new feature and understand how we're trying to give more benefits to members.'\n\nNote: Groomer Tracking is only available for our club groomers out of Olney and Canyon Creek.\n\n​\n\nCrane/Porcupine Mountain: Porcupine and Crane are now groomed twice monthly as snow conditions permit.\n\nDesert Mountain is now groomed twice monthly as snow conditions permit.\n\nNOTE: Crane/Porcupine and Desert Mtn get groomed once per month via contract groomer as funding/snow permits.\n\nThe Official FSA Facebook Site - Check out the latest musings and happenings on Facebook and be sure to Like our page!!!

Registration is different for Montana residents and nonresidents. ​Montana FWP maintains a complete site with all the rules and regulations (click here).\n\nResidents Registration\n\nMontana residents must register their snowmobiles at the County Treasurer's office in the county where the owner resides. This is a one-time registration and valid until the current owner sells the snowmobile.\n\nResident Trail Pass\n\nResidents must purchase a Resident Trail Pass to legally ride on any of the 4,000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails in Montana. Trail Passes are valid for two seasons and are $20. Trail Passes apply to all “mechanized equipment” including snowmobiles, motorized snow bikes, and fat tire pedal bikes. Anyone using groomed snowmobile trails for recreation is asked to please contribute and purchase the Trail Pass. The revenues go directly to grooming the trails, purchasing groomers, etc.\n\nExceptions\n\na person renting a snowmobile registered pursuant to 61-3-321(11)(c), but the person shall carry proof of rental if operating the snowmobile in a snowmobile area that otherwise requires a trail pass pursuant to subsection (1)\n\na person participating in a sanctioned dog sled race\n\nmotorized equipment exempt from registration in Montana pursuant to 61-3-321(14)\n\nNonresidents\n\nNonresidents must purchase a Nonresident Winter Trail Pass to legally ride on any of the 4,000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails in Montana.

Trail Passes apply to all dog sleds and “mechanized equipment” including snowmobiles, motorized snow bikes, and fat tire pedal bikes.\n\nWhere to Purchase a Permit or Trail PassTrail Passes are available seasonally from October to April.\n\nApply Online - You may purchase your Resident Trail Pass or Nonresident Snowmobile Permit through the Online Licensing System.\n\nVendor List - You can also purchase a Nonresident Temporary Use Permit or a Resident Trail Pass at any of the vendors in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\nNote: A separate company administrates this system for the state and collects a convenience fee. We recommend you simply visit a local vendor and purchase your pass(es) from them."
