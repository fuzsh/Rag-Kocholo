Displays feature the history of Hungry Horse Dam and its importance to the system. Admission to the visitor center is free.\n\nHungry Horse Dam was completed in 1953 across the South Fork of the Flathead River after five years of construction.\n\nAt 564 feet high, Hungry Horse is one of the largest concrete arch dams in the United States and its morning-glory spillway, with water cascading over the rim and dropping 490 feet, is the highest in the world.\n\nThe outdoor guided walking tours will be offered daily at 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and are free of charge. Reservations can only be made for the 9:30 a.m. tour, and all other tours are on a first-come, first-served basis. To join a tour, sign up at the visitor center information desk.
