The dam is located in the Rocky Mountains and is surrounded by numerous mountain peaks. Along the shores of the reservoir, there are multiple opportunities to take in the fresh mountain air and take in the moment.\n\nThe dam is fed from the South Fork Flathead River which also has numerous other offshoots and tributaries to explore. Down in the reservoir, there are numerous trails, camping spots, and scenic hideaways to enjoy. With over 23,800 acres of land to explore there are countless opportunities to spark romance and capture stunning images. I even know some phenomenal hidden away spots where huckleberry grows, which makes for some unique and beautiful photographs.\n\nThings to do at\n\nHungry Horse Dam\n\nThe main hub for the Hungry Horse Dam is at the visitors center. Here, you can learn about the history of the dam, explore exhibits, and take a self-guided or guided tour of the dam. The visitors center is open to guests from 8:30am - 4:00pm from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n\nPast the dam, inside of the Hungry Horse Reservoir, is where the action really happens. Here, visitors can enjoy activities such as camping, fishing, boating, swimming, and scenic overlooks.\n\nHungry Horse Reservoir Camping\n\nInside Hungry Horse Reservoir, camping is one of the more popular ways to turn a day trip into a destination weekend. Throughout the reservoir there are multiple tent and RV campsites to enjoy and take in the beauty surrounding.\n\n1.

This area has ease of access to fishing and swimming spots and each campsite also has a fire pit and picnic table.\n\n2.

To get to the dam, visitors will get off of Highway 2 in Hungry Horse and take Hungry Horse Dam Rd about 4 miles. The visitor center is on the right before crossing the top of the dam.\n\nTo access the reservoir, there are two main roads to utilize depending on which side of the reservoir you wish to explore. Visitors on the east side will turn off Highway 2 onto Old US 2 and take a right onto Central Ave which turns into S Fork Rd also known as East Side Rd. While visitors on the west side will continue over the dam from the visitor center onto West Side S Fork Rd also known as NF-895. The roads together surround the reservoir."
