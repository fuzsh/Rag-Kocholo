        "text": "While it’s always bittersweet to see summer go, the beautiful transformation across Montana always helps ease the blow. From Billings to Bozeman and Butte to the Bitterroot Valley, swaths of color are sweeping the forests. If you’re in the midst of autumn there’s a good chance you’ve already seen some of the beautiful fall foliage in Montana that’s on display each year. I love simple walks near my house to take it all in, but if you’re looking for more of an adventure, make your way to Flathead National Forest and the Hungry Horse Reservoir. It’s beautiful throughout the year, but in the fall it’s a sight to behold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hungry Horse Reservoir can be visited throughout the year — just be sure to check conditions before heading out. You can learn more about the area by visiting the official Forest Service website. You can learn all about the history of the Hungry Horse Dam on the National Park Service website.\n\nAnd, if you’re feeling ambitious after reading about this fall foliage in Montana, you can check out the Hungry Horse Reservoir Trail on AllTrails. Note that the route is 23 miles and is rated as hard, so it’s best to be an experienced hiker before taking this on.\n\nWant more Montana in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around Montana!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
