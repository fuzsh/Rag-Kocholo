        "text": "July 10, an important day back in 1948, is probably long forgotten. It was date for official start of the multipurpose Hungry Horse Dam. Montana Gov. Samuel Ford set off the charge from the vista point at the end of the upper access road overlooking the dam site. Explosion occurred near the river level 500 feet below on the left bank.\n\nWorld's fourth largest dam built of concrete was estimated to carry a cost of about $100 million. It was the largest single postwar Bureau of Reclamation project, and next to Grand Coulee, Hoover and Shasta dams for size.\n\nMaster of ceremonies was Don Treloar and A. F. Winkler of the Flathead Citizens committee, sponsors of the celebration, Clyde H. Spencer, Hungry Horse project engineer, and Gov. Ford gave three minute speeches. Leon Phillips was general program chairman.\n\nMorning parade at Hungry Horse project celebrated the event, with H. J. Kelly, veteran newspaperman, as grand marshal. He was first editor to realize possibilities of Hungry Horse Dam. Bands, drum and bugle corps from Kalispell, Whitefish and Missoula, floats and approximately 100 horseback riders from Columbia Falls, Belton, Whitefish and Kalispell were parade entries.\n\nBuffet luncheon at the VFW Post 5650 Club was sponsored by Columbia Falls Chamber of Commerce. Program continued in the afternoon at Hungry Horse, with invocation by Rev. Russell J. Prentice, Kalispell. Short talks were given by William E. Warne, Assistant Secretary of Interior, Michael W. Straus, commissioner of reclamation, Gov. Ford, Montana Sen. James E. Murray, Montana Rep. Mike Mansfield, Richard J. Gray, head of the AF of L building construction division, and Paul J. Raver, of the Bonneville Power Administration.\n\nOthers introduced were Leslie N. McClellan, chief engineer, Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, and Frank A. Banks, supervising engineer for Grand Coulee Dam construction. Francis C. Guardipee, Blackfeet Indian and longtime Glacier National Park ranger, presented the \"hungriest horse\" to Assistant Secretary Warne.\n\nOther events that memorable day included a historical skit by Kalispell Jaycees, rodeo in Columbia Falls and evening invitational dinner at Lake McDonald Hotel.\n\nGladys Shay is a longtime resident and columnist for the Hungry Horse News."
