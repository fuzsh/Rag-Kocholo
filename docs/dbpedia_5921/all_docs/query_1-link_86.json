Officials are asking the community to prepare for evacuation, including making plans for homes, pets and livestock.\n\nPolice are notifying affected residents by going door to door.\n\nA shelter has been set up in Columbia Falls. People are encouraged to call the Red Cross at 1-800-733-2767 prior to your arrival."
