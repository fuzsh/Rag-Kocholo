        "text": "Description\n\nThe Wagner VII or Hammer-Wagner projection is a modification of the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection. All parallels are convex toward the equator, which gives the projection a unique appearance and relatively low distortion characteristic compared to some equal-area pseudocylindrical projections.\n\nThe projection was introduced by Karl Heinrich (Karlheinz) Wagner in 1941. It is available in ArcGIS Pro 1.2 and later and in ArcGIS Desktop 10.4 and later.\n\nProjection properties\n\nThe subsections below describe the Wagner VII projection properties.\n\nGraticule\n\nWagner VII is a modified azimuthal projection. The meridians, except the central meridian, are curves concave toward the central meridian. The central meridian is a straight line, half the length of the projected equator. All parallels are convex toward the equator. Both parallels and meridians are unequally spaced. The pole lines are curved and also convex toward the equator. They have the same shape as the 65° parallel on the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection in equatorial aspect. The graticule is symmetric across the equator and the central meridian.\n\nDistortion\n\nWagner VII is an equal-area (equivalent) projection. Shapes, directions, angles, and distances are distorted. The distortion is moderate near the center and increases toward the edges. The values are symmetric across the equator and the central meridian."
