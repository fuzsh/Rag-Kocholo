Paris latitude and longitude\n\nWhere is Paris?\n\nParis is located in Northern France, in the region known as Ile de France. The Seine River runs through the center of Paris, further enhancing its beauty and charm.\n\nParis is the capital of France, a country located in Western Europe. The neighboring countries of France are Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain.\n\nWhat is the latitude of Paris?\n\nThe latitude of Paris France is 48.86 degrees North of the equator. This means that Paris lies about halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.\n\nWhat is the longitude of Paris?\n\nThe longitude of Paris France is 2.35 degrees East of the Prime Meridian. This means that it is located eastward from the reference line of 0 degrees longitude, or the Prime Meridian.\n\nWhat parallel is Paris France?\n\nParis France is located in the Northern Hemisphere, so it lies on the 48th parallel north. This means that it is at 48 degrees north of the equator and halfway between the North Pole and Equator.\n\nParis is located around 15km south of the 49th parallel, and its main airport, the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, lies on the 49th parallel.\n\nDoes latitude impact hours of daylight?\n\nYes, latitude does have an impact on hours of daylight. The higher the latitude, the longer the days in summer and the shorter the days in winter.\n\nThis is because as you move away from the equator towards either pole, there are more hours of daylight during the day or night depending on which season it is.\n\nSo, for Paris, which lies on the 48th parallel north and is located in the Northern Hemisphere, the days are longer in summer and shorter in winter. This is good to keep in mind when making your travel plans so you know how much sightseeing you can squeeze into a day!\n\n(The days in Paris are not as long as those in London, since the latitude of London is higher than Paris.)\n\nDoes longitude impact hours of daylight?\n\nNo, longitude does not have an impact on hours of daylight. The duration of daylight at any location depends only on its latitude. Longitude is only used to pinpoint the location – it does not change the amount of daylight hours experienced in any given season.\n\nHow many hours of daylight are there in Paris in the summer?\n\nIn the summer, there are usually around 16 hours of daylight in Paris. This varies slightly from day to day, but overall, you can expect 15-16 hours of daylight during the summer months in Paris.\n\nThe longest day is on the summer solstice, which is usually the 20th or 21st of June.\n\nIn the summer, you’ll have plenty of time to see the top attractions in Paris!\n\nHow many hours of daylight are there in Paris in the winter?\n\nIn the winter, there are usually around 8-9 hours of daylight in Paris. This varies slightly from day to day, but overall, you can expect 8-9 hours of daylight during the winter months.\n\nThe shortest day is on the winter solstice, which is usually on December 21 or 22.\n\nSo, if you’re visiting Paris in the winter, be sure to plan your sightseeing carefully to make the most of those precious daylight hours! (But it does make it easier to see the illuminated monuments and enjoy a Paris by night tour without staying up until midnight!)\n\nDoes latitude affect climate?\n\nYes, latitude does affect climate. As you move away from the equator and closer to the poles, temperatures tend to be cooler in general.\n\nThis is why places located on higher latitudes like Paris tend to experience more temperate climates with four distinct seasons.\n\nPlaces at lower latitudes (closer to the equator), will tend to experience more tropical climates with very little temperature variation. So, latitude definitely plays a role in determining the climate of an area.\n\nDo keep in mind that latitude is not the only factor impacting climate. Climates will also differ due to factors such as elevation or proximity to large bodies of water.\n\nWhat is the climate in Paris?\n\nThe climate in Paris is classified as a temperate oceanic climate.\n\nThe summers are warm and humid, while the winters tend to be rainy with cool temperatures. Spring and autumn are generally mild but can vary greatly in temperature.\n\n“It’s Paris. You don’t come here for the weather.”\n\nAdrian Leeds (This is one of the best Paris quotes — funny but so true!)\n\nWhat is the daily temperature range in Paris?\n\nThe daily temperature range in Paris varies greatly depending on the season.\n\nIn the summer, Paris temperatures typically range from 19-26°C (66-79°F). Sometimes Paris may get a heat wave, so if you’re visiting in the summer, you’ll want to ensure that your hotel has air conditioning (not all Paris hotels do).\n\nTake a midday break in the shade in one of the lovely gardens of Paris, such as the Luxembourg Gardens. And be sure to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated! Take advantage of the fountains and refill with free drinking water in Paris.\n\nIn the winter, Paris temperatures range from 3-12°C (37-54°F) on average. The temperature can also drop down to below 0°C (32°F) in the coldest months of January and February.\n\nIt’s important to plan accordingly and bring appropriate clothing for each season when visiting Paris! Temperatures can vary quite a bit beyond yearly averages, so be prepared with layering options.\n\nOur first trip to France was in the month of September. We expected it to be cooler and didn’t pack any shorts. The weather turned out to be unseasonably warm, and we really wished that we had brought more options! It can be hard to predict what to pack for fall in Europe.\n\nLearn more about Paris temperatures and rainfall by month.\n\nDoes it snow in Paris?\n\nYes, it does snow in Paris. On average, Paris gets around 20-30 days of snow each winter, with December being the month when snowfall is most likely. Snow usually falls in small amounts and melts quickly.\n\nWhat city is on the same latitude as Paris?\n\nSome popular cities in southern Canada are close to the same latitude as Paris.

Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator and ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90°N/S at the poles.\n\nWhat is the equator?\n\nThe equator is an imaginary line that circles the Earth and divides it into two hemispheres: the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. It is located at 0 degrees latitude, halfway between the North Pole and South Pole.\n\nWhat is longitude?\n\nLongitude is also one of two coordinates used to pinpoint a location on the Earth’s surface, along with latitude. It is measured in degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian and ranges from 0° at the Prime Meridian to 180° east/west. The longitude of Paris is 2.35 degrees East, meaning that it lies 2.35° east of the Prime Meridian.\n\nKnowing both latitude and longitude coordinates lets you accurately pinpoint the location of any place on Earth, including Paris!\n\nWhat is the Prime Meridian?\n\nThe Prime Meridian is an imaginary line that runs through Greenwich, England and marks the reference line for longitude. It was created by the British Royal Observatory in 1851.\n\nThe Prime Meridian is located at 0 degrees longitude and divides the Earth into two halves: the Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere. All other locations on Earth have a specific angle of longitude depending on how far east or west they lie from the Prime Meridian.\n\nWhat is the difference between latitude and longitude?\n\nLatitude and longitude are two coordinates used to pinpoint a location on the Earth’s surface. Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator, and ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90°N/S at the poles. Longitude measures how far east or west something is of the Prime Meridian, and ranges from 0° at the Prime Meridian to 180° east/west.\n\nWhat is a parallel?\n\nA parallel is an imaginary line on the Earth’s surface that circles around the globe. It is measured in degrees north or south of the equator and ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90°N/S at the poles. The 48th parallel north, where Paris is located, circles around halfway between the North Pole and Equator.\n\nIs a parallel the same as latitude?\n\nNo, a parallel is not the same as latitude.\n\nA parallel is an imaginary line on the Earth’s surface that circles around the globe, whereas latitude is one of two coordinates of a point on the Earth’s surface together with longitude.\n\nLatitude ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90°N/S at the poles, and longitude ranges from 0° at the Prime Meridian to 180° east/west. Knowing both latitude and longitude coordinates lets you accurately pinpoint the location of any place on Earth, including Paris!\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThere you have it!
