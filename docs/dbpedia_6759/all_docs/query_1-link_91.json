The assumption that the base unit is in degree refers to to the range values specified. If the assumption would be radians then the corresponding values would be given. That mean in 3.3 the default angle unit for long/lat are radians. 25.2.4 Specifying geospatial coordinates Latitude and longitude are given in units of angle base units. The following assumes an angle base unit of degrees. If a UNIT statement for angle base units has been provided, the following values for latitude and/or longitude should be suitable converted to that angle base units. Latitude is in the range −90..+90, and longitude can be in the range −180..+180 or 0..360 (0 deg longitude is the same point in both cases).
