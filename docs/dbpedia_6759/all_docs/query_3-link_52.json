        "text": "Tehran is a city in Iran at latitude 35°43′00.12″ North, longitude 51°24′00.00″ East.\n\nProgress Summary\n\nThe project is still in its early days.\n\nOn 2007-03-04, Farzaneh got a GPS device, a Garmin eTrex Legend (b&w). Later, on 2007-04-01, Roozbeh got another of the same brand and model as a birthday present! We are now doing mapping the proper way. Before that, we had mostly used Landsat imagery and the personal knowledge of our own and of friends. We drew the topology of the area, wrote down the names of streets on paper, and later added it to OSM.\n\nFor the progress status, see the map.\n\nSee also: WikiProject Iran\n\nFirst goals\n\nIn order to be able to divide the city into areas and handle each separately, we have a rough first goal of having all of the expressways in Tehran mapped first, so the city could be divided into areas between the expressways. Other interesting areas to prioritize is the area of Tarh-e Terafik and the area with restrictions for odd- and even-numbered vehicles.\n\nTehran Expressways and Freeways List\n\nAbshenasan\n\nAle Ahmad\n\nAshrafi-e Esfehani\n\nAzadegan\n\nBaba'i\n\nBasij\n\nBe'sat\n\nChamran\n\nHaghani\n\nHakim\n\nHemmat\n\nImam Ali\n\nJenah\n\nKashani\n\nKazemi\n\nKordestan\n\nModarres\n\nNavvab\n\nNiayesh\n\nPersian Gulf\n\nResalat\n\nSa'idi\n\nSadr\n\nSattari\n\nShahide Gomnam\n\nSheykh Fazlollah\n\nTehran-Karaj Freeway\n\nTondguyan\n\nYadegar-e Emam\n\nZeynoddin\n\nTehran 22 District Project\n\nIn this project, active peoples on the \"map of Tehran\", will try to completing one or more of Tehran district.\n\nDistrict 1\n\nSirvan\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 2\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 3\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 4\n\nOsm1980\n\nDistrict 5\n\nMehrad77 Mehrad77 (talk)\n\nDistrict 6\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 7\n\nMehrad77 Mehrad77 (talk)\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 8\n\nOsm1980\n\nDistrict 9\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 10\n\nmadjidf\n\nDistrict 11\n\nShahinnia\n\nDistrict 12\n\nShahinnia\n\nDistrict 13\n\nOsm1980\n\nDistrict 14\n\nShahinnia\n\nDistrict 15\n\nShahinnia\n\nDistrict 16\n\nShahinnia\n\nDistrict 17\n\nabc12\n\nDistrict 18\n\nshahinnia\n\nDistrict 19\n\nshahinnia\n\nDistrict 20\n\nshahinnia\n\nDistrict 21\n\nshahinnia\n\nDistrict 22\n\nMehrad77 Mehrad77 (talk)\n\nshahinnia\n\nUse by Yahoo\n\nAfter the post-election protests in June 2009 protests, Yahoo added OpenStreetMap as base map in the Tehran area for Flickr thus allowing users to geotag their photos.\n\nKeep Right map checking tool\n\nKeep Right is a tool to find problems in the map data.
