Peruvian police razed dozens of illegal gold-mining camps at the edge of an Amazonian nature reserve this week, part of a renewed bid to halt the spread of wildcatting in a remote rainforest region. The stings at the edge of the Tambopata National Reserve were the first in the southeastern region of Madre de Dios since a crackdown let up in December. Production from wildcat miners in the region, who sell their ore up the supply chain, made up about 10 percent of national production before President Ollanta Humala launched the harshest crackdown yet on illegal gold mining last year.

His parents, both in their 70s, could not afford the medical treatments, so they had to lock him up in chains to prevent him from running away, according to Tong's family.
