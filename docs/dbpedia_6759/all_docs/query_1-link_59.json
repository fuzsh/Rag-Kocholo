        "text": "In the Middle Eocene, some 40 million years ago, a tropical climate prevailed in our latitudes: It was warm and humid, as evidenced by fossils from Lake Geiseltal near Halle, for example. It was so warm, in fact, that coral reefs extended far to the northâ€”to about the 45th degree of latitude, roughly the level of present-day southern France. Some of these tropical reef corals are now fossils in Leipzig University's Geological and Paleontological Collection. They come from the Paris Basin, a large marine bay that extended into what is now France.\n\nAmong these fossils, Professor Thomas Brachert and his team found some very special corals: They were not fossilized like many others, but escaped this process. \"This makes them a wonderful environmental archive. A coral skeleton grows every year much like a tree. But what is special about it is that the skeleton is something of an archive of several hundreds to a thousand years of climate history,\" said Professor Thomas Brachert from the Institute of Geophysics and Geology at Leipzig University.\n\nSkeleton reveals small seasonal temperature fluctuations\n\nThe geologist and his team took samples from the coral's calcareous skeleton and analyzed the material using geochemical methods. Based on the chemical properties, the scientists were able to deduce the temperature of the water in which the corals lived. The ratio of oxygen isotopes in the samples showed that the seasonal temperature differences were very small for this latitude. They correspond to about half of the current value of 15 degrees Celsius difference between seasons. \"This means that our study confirms what had been expected but could never be measured so well: the fact that there were very small seasonal differences in the planet's warm periods,\" says Brachert."
