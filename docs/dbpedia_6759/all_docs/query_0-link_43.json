        "meta_description": "Abstract. Mid-level altocumulus clouds (Ac) and high cirrus clouds (Ci) can be considered natural laboratories for studying cloud glaciation in the atmosphere. While their altitude makes them difficult to access with in situ instruments, they can be conveniently observed from the ground with active remote-sensing instruments such as lidar and radar. However, active remote sensing of Ac and Ci at visible wavelengths with lidar requires a clear line of sight between the instrument and the target cloud. It is therefore advisable to carefully assess potential locations for deploying ground-based lidar instruments in field experiments or for long-term observations that are focused on mid- or high-level clouds. Here, observations of clouds with two spaceborne lidars are used to assess where ground-based lidar measurements of mid- and high-level clouds are least affected by the light-attenuating effect of low-level clouds. It is found that cirrus can be best observed in the tropics, the Tibetan Plateau, the western part of North America, the Atacama region, the southern tip of South America, Greenland, Antarctica, and parts of western Europe. For the observation of altocumulus, a ground-based lidar is best placed at Greenland, Antarctica, the western flank of the Andes and Rocky Mountains, the Amazon, central Asia, Siberia, western Australia, or the southern half of Africa.",

        "text": "3.1âCirrus clouds\n\nAn overview of the occurrence of isolated cirrus as identified from 15Â years of CALIPSO lidar measurements is provided in Fig.Â 1. The land regions with the highest occurrence frequency of 0.5 or larger are the Tibetan Plateau, north-eastern Africa (Chad, Egypt, Libya, Sudan), Saharan Africa, California, northern Chile, and eastern Antarctica. Over water, the largest occurrence frequencies are found over the Caribbean, the western Indian Ocean, as well as in two bands north and south of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The distribution in Fig.Â 1a changes considerably if the number of CALIPSO profiles that show isolated cirrus is normalized by the number of cirrus-containing cloudy profiles (Fig.Â 1b) rather than all cloudy CALIPSO profiles (Fig.Â 1a). The absolute number of cirrus-containing CALIPSO profiles in Fig.Â 1c shows that regions with high coverage of isolated cirrus in Fig.Â 1a and b, such as north-eastern Africa and California, actually feature a rather low occurrence rate of cirrus-containing CALIPSO profiles. Combining the information in Fig.Â 1 reveals that the land sites with the best temporal coverage for observing isolated cirrus clouds from the ground have to feature (i)Â a large ratio of cirrus observations in the absence of low- and mid-level clouds with (ii)Â a high occurrence rate of cirrus-containing profiles.\n\nDifferences between day and night are summarized in Fig.Â 2. The differences are likely related to the combined effect of diurnal variability and variations in detection sensitivity. The increased detection sensitivity during the night (related to the absence of background noise from scattered sunlight) generally leads to an increase in the number of cirrus-containing cloudy profiles south of about 55ââN, while the opposite is the case at higher latitudes (not shown). Nevertheless, the general patterns of cirrus occurrence for CALIPSO observations during day and night do not differ from those in Fig.Â 1a.\n\nThe seasonal variation of the occurrence of isolated cirrus clouds is presented in Fig.Â 3. The region with the highest occurrence rate of isolated cirrus clouds is northern Africa during boreal winter. Other regions of pronounced seasonal variation are the western coast of North America, Chile, the southern tip of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian Ocean and the Indian subcontinent, Tibet and western China, the maritime continent, and the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In contrast to these regions, seasonal variations at the poles are the result of the effect of polar night and day. This can also be seen from comparing Figs.Â 1 andÂ 2.\n\n3.2âMid-level clouds\n\nOccurrence rates of transparent mid-level clouds that would be detectable with a ground-based lidar from 15Â years of CALIPSO data are presented in Fig.Â 4. The land regions with the highest fraction of CALIPSO profiles that contain transparent altocumulus clouds without low-level clouds below are the Greenland ice sheet, eastern Antarctica, the western flanks of the Rocky Mountains and Andes, western Australia, southern Africa and the Horn of Africa, large parts of the Middle East, and the area around the Himalayas. FigureÂ 4b and c reveal that cloudy profiles containing transparent altocumulus are dominant over the continents and the equatorial oceans. A similar finding is presented in Bourgeois et al. (2016). In contrast, transparent altocumulus generally occurs less frequently over mid-latitude oceans and the stratocumulus decks to the west of the continents, though aircraft measurements have shown that the occurrence rate of thin mid-level clouds is non-negligible in these regions (Adebiyi et al.,Â 2020).\n\nThe dayânight contrast for altocumulus clouds in Fig.Â 5 is more pronounced than the one for isolated cirrus in Fig.Â 2 with a larger occurrence rate of continental transparent altocumulus clouds without low-level clouds underneath during daytime. This is particularly visible over western North America, southern and eastern Africa, eastern Antarctica, and western Australia. A slight increase in the occurrence rate is found over the equatorial oceans during the night, again likely as a result of increased detection sensitivity in the absence of the solar background. The occurrence frequency is lowest over the regions of dense stratocumulus decks to the west of the continents.\n\nFigureÂ 6 reveals that some regions show a considerable change in the occurrence frequency of transparent altocumulus over the year. This seasonal variation would need to be considered in the choice of location for ground-based lidar observations of mid-level clouds and in the interpretation of the collected data. For instance, ground-based lidar measurements of transparent altocumulus clouds located in northern Africa, the Middle East, or at the western coast of North America are likely to give the best yield in observations during summer, while the occurrence frequency of those clouds is considerably lower during other seasons. In contrast, the opposite is found for eastern Africa. Occurrence frequencies are relatively constant over the southern part of Africa, the Atacama region, Greenland, western Australia, and central Asia.\n\n3.3âDiurnal variability\n\nAn extensive comparison of the findings from observations with the CATS and CALIPSO lidars is provided in the Appendix. Here, the capability of CATS to cover the diurnal variability in cloudiness in the latitude band from 51ââS to 51ââN (Noel et al.,Â 2018) is used to evaluate the representativeness of the CALIPSO lidar observations at 01:30 and 13:30 local time for drawing conclusions regarding the most suitable regions for observing mid-level and high clouds with ground-based lidar instruments. A comparison of the occurrence of high- and mid-level clouds in CALIPSO observations that cover just the CATS time period versus the 15 full years considered in Figs.Â 1â6 reveals no change in the observed patterns (not shown). We hence conclude that the findings of this section can be generalized to CALIPSO observations that do not fall within the time during which CATS has been active.\n\nFigureÂ 7 presents the analysis of CATS observations of isolated ice clouds over its full period of operation from MarchÂ 2015 to OctoberÂ 2017. Though compiled with a coarser resolution, the occurrence-frequency map in Fig.Â 7a can be compared directly to the CALIPSO observations in Fig.Â 1a. Data from both instruments give a very similar global distribution of isolated cirrus clouds with clear maxima of occurrence over northern Africa and the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, it is reasonable to make use of both time series for a more comprehensive analysis of the best locations for observing mid-level and high clouds with ground-based lidar.\n\nThe anomaly in the diurnal variation of the zonal mean occurrence rate of isolated ice clouds over all surfaces in Fig.Â 7b reveals that noontime measurements in the Northern Hemisphere show lower values than the daily average of CATS observations, while the opposite is the case for evening measurements. A much smaller variation from the daily average is found in the first 6 to 9âh of a day. A similar picture is found when looking at zonal mean values for different seasons (not shown). The diurnal variation in zonal bands of 20â is shown in Fig.Â 7d. Over all surfaces, measurements in the tropics from 30ââS to 30ââN show the largest anomaly at noon and in the evening. Smaller variations are found at latitudes larger than 30â. All zonal bands show mean values varying around zero until 06:00 local time. Fig.Â 7c shows that the diurnal variation is intensified when considering only data over land, which are the areas where a ground-based lidar would be placed. In that case, a stronger negative anomaly is found around noon compared to the data over all surfaces in Fig.Â 7b, while a positive anomaly extends from 18:00 to 06:00 local time, though weakening after midnight. This is corroborated by the zonal means over land in Fig.Â 7d, which also reveal the smallest anomaly during the morning hours. From this investigation of diurnal variation and the magnitude of the anomaly during day and night, it can be concluded that CALIPSO nighttime observations at 01:30 local time might be more representative for an objective assessment of the ideal regions for observing mid-level and high clouds with ground-based lidar instruments compared to daytime observations at 13:30 local time.\n\nThe results of an analogous investigation for transparent altocumulus clouds are presented in Fig.Â 8. Again, the distribution of isolated altocumulus clouds from CATS observations resembles that derived from the CALIPSO time series in Fig.Â 4a. However, the smaller volume of the CATS data set in combination with the coarser resolution of the spatial gridding leads to a weaker contrast in altocumulus occurrence in Fig.Â 8a compared to the CALIPSO data in Fig.Â 4a. The anomaly in the diurnal variation of the zonal mean occurrence rate of isolated altocumulus is much weaker than for cirrus for observations over all surfaces as well as land only. In fact, the anomaly is negligible when considering all surfaces (Fig.Â 8b and d). Considering only data over land shows a weak positive anomaly around noon and an even weaker negative anomaly between 18:00 and 06:00 local time (Fig.Â 8c). Hence, CALIPSO observations at 01:30 local time should be representative for the better part of aÂ day.\n\n3.4âPlacing a ground-based lidar for observations of high and mid-level clouds\n\nThe findings of this study are summarized in Fig.Â 9. Additional maps with higher temporal resolution as a reference for short-term instrument deployment are provided in Figs.Â A5âA8. The combination of (i)Â the ratio of CALIPSO profiles containing either cirrus clouds in the absence of opaque low- and mid-level clouds or transparent altocumulus in the absence of low-level clouds versus all cloudy profiles (Figs.Â 1a and 4a) with (ii)Â the normalized number of such CALIPSO profiles per grid box (Figs.Â 1c and 4c) is used to identify those land regions where measurements with a ground-based lidar are most likely to yield the highest possible observation rate for studying mid-level and high clouds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, cirrus clouds are best observed in the tropics with particularly suitable conditions for ground-based lidar measurements at the northern coast of South America, equatorial Africa, the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, and the maritime continent. Cirrus observations with lidar in these regions have been performed, for instance, in Niger (Protat et al.,Â 2010), in southern India (Pandit et al.,Â 2015), at the Maldives (Seifert et al.,Â 2007), and at Nauru (Comstock et al.,Â 2002). Further favourable regions are the Tibetan Plateau (Dai et al.,Â 2019; He et al.,Â 2013) and western China, western North America (Sassen and Campbell,Â 2001; Sassen and Benson,Â 2001), Florida and the Caribbean (Haarig et al.,Â 2016), the Atacama region, the southern tip of South America (Barja Gonzalez et al.,Â 2020), the Amazon rainforest (Gouveia et al.,Â 2017), Antarctica (Alexander and Klekociuk,Â 2021), and Greenland (Lacour et al.,Â 2018), where semi-transparent clouds were found to potentially enhance ice sheet melting (Bennartz et al.,Â 2013; Solomon et al.,Â 2017). Less ideal conditions are met over Europe (Giannakaki et al.,Â 2007; Kienast-SjÃ¶gren et al.,Â 2016) and most of Asia. The worst regions are the Canadian Arctic, the northern parts of Europe and Asia, the Middle East, southern Africa, and most of Australia. Nevertheless, studies have been published based on measurements in those regions as well (e.g. Platt,Â 1973; Protat et al.,Â 2010).\n\nThe preferential regions for observing mid-level clouds with ground-based lidar are shown in Fig.Â 9b. These turn out to be more confined compared to the ones for cirrus in Fig.Â 9a. The regions that stick out are the Greenland Plateau and Antarctica (Del Guasta et al.,Â 1993), where the topography is too high to have low-level clouds as an obstacle for lidar measurements. At low and mid latitudes, advantageous observational conditions prevail on the western flanks of the Rocky (Sassen,Â 2002) and Andes mountain ranges (Kanitz et al.,Â 2011; Jimenez et al.,Â 2020), over the Amazon, in western Australia (Protat et al.,Â 2011), in southern and eastern Africa, in the Gulf region, on the fringe of the Tibetan Plateau, and in central Asia. The regions indicated in Fig.Â 9b mark those for which a ground-based lidar is likely to give the best return rate in terms of observing altocumulus clouds. This is particularly important for short-term deployments such as field experiments which typically extend over a period of a few weeks to months. Alternatively, long-term measurements are the best option for collecting a volume of data that is sufficient to allow for identifying specific case studies as well as for enabling a statistical analysis of the observed altocumulus clouds â even in regions that are not emphasized in Fig.Â 9b, such as central Europe (Ansmann et al.,Â 2005; Seifert et al.,Â 2010; Schmidt et al.,Â 2015).\n\nFiguresÂ A5âA8 provide seasonally and monthly resolved displays of the data in Fig.Â 9. The figures reflect the annual variation of observational conditions for consideration when planning the deployment of lidar instruments for observing mid-level or high clouds during dedicated field experiments or shorter-term measurement campaigns.\n\nFifteen years of measurements from the polar-orbiting CALIPSO lidar have been used in combination with 32Â months of measurements from the CATS lidar aboard the International Space Station between MarchÂ 2015 and OctoberÂ 2017 to investigate the global distribution of cloud scenarios that support observations of mid- and high-level clouds with ground-based lidar instruments. The CALIPSO cloud mask was used to select profiles in which\n\ncirrus clouds are observed in the absence of low-level clouds and opaque altocumulus underneath and\n\ntransparent altocumulus is observed in the absence of low-level clouds underneath\n\nas an analogue for conditions under which a ground-based lidar could be used for unperturbed observations of high- and mid-level clouds, respectively.\n\nThe fixed CALIPSO overpass times at 01:30 and 13:30 local time inhibit an assessment of the diurnal variation in cloudiness. Hence, observations with the CATS lidar have been used to investigate the representativeness of the CALIPSO cloud sampling. While the CATS data set flags water and ice clouds, additional screening is needed to identify cloud types such as altocumulus and cirrus as provided in the CALIPSO data set. Scenarios that are comparable to the ones selected from the CALIPSO observations have been compiled by screening the CATS data set for the occurrence of cloud ice and for the location of cloud base and top heights.\n\nThe analysis of the data sets from the two spaceborne lidars shows a remarkable resemblance in the regional and vertical distribution of isolated cirrus and altocumulus clouds despite the different approaches to extracting the corresponding information from the two data sets. The diurnal variation of cloud occurrence from the CATS data set leads to the conclusion that CALIPSO observations at 01:30 local time are representative for the better part of the day, while the period of the largest anomaly is covered by the overpass at 13:30 local time. Generally, diurnal anomalies in cloud occurrence are (i)Â stronger over land compared to over all surfaces and (ii)Â stronger for isolated cirrus clouds compared to isolated altocumulus clouds. The ratio of occurrence of the two cloud types versus all cloudy profiles per grid box in combination with the absolute number of profiles in a corresponding grid box is used to identify those regions for which a ground-based lidar is likely to encounter the best balance between the occurrence of the desired cloud types and the prevalence of favourable conditions to actually observe these clouds, i.e.Â the absence of strongly light-attenuating clouds below the target cloud.\n\nThis information is particularly vital in planning deployment of lidar instruments in the framework of field experiments or measurement campaigns. Such deployments generally last between a few weeks and several months, and their success relies strongly on finding atmospheric conditions that meet the desired research objectives to allow for addressing related science questions. From the approach used in this study, it is found that the best regions for lidar measurements of cirrus clouds are the tropics, the Tibetan Plateau, the western part of North America, the Atacama region, the southern tip of South America, Greenland, Antarctica, and parts of western Europe. For the observation of altocumulus clouds, a ground-based lidar is best placed on Greenland, Antarctica, the western flank of the Andes and Rockies, the Amazon, central Asia, Siberia, western Australia, or the southern half of Africa. The seasonally and monthly resolved view of advantageous conditions for observing mid-level and high clouds with ground-based lidar reveals a strong annual variation for some of the regions identified above that should be considered in the planning of shorter-term lidar deployments. Finally, it should be emphasized that the regions identified here provide the best gain of a lidar deployment. However, this advantage for short-term deployments can be compensated for by increasing the length of a lidar operating at a certain site, as this increases the likelihood of meeting the desired atmospheric conditions for observing a targeted cloudÂ type.\n\nAdebiyi, A.
