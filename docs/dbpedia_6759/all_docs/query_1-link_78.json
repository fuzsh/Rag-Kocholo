I started looking closer at the conversion from theta and phi to longitude and latitude because I found some sources saying that they don't map onto each other in a one-to-one manner (e.g., this post <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5674149/3d-coordinates-on-a-sphere-to-latitude-and-longitude>, see highest rated answer). After getting some help from a friend in physics I learned that sph_theta = longitude, but that sph_phi = latitude is not correct because phi is measured in relationship to the zenith, while latitude is measured in relation to the equator. Thus, the relationship between phi and latitude is that latitude = 90 - phi. After plotting this, and comparing values from car2ph() conversion taking the x, y, z values (which are also included in EEGLAB) I realized that this 90 - phi adjustment had already been made in EEGLAB. Thus, what is called sph_phi in EEGLAB is actually the latitude. I guess I could have made my life easier by not questioning whether theta and phi are the same as longitude and latitude in the first place. :D One very important thing I also learned, and which caused me a lot of trouble researching this, is that physics and math people use theta and phi in the exact opposite way (see Wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system>). The EEGLAB file follows the physics notation though, where theta denotes the polar angle, while phi means the azimutal angle (at least that's how it should be in principle, with the qualification that EEGLAB's sph_phi is actually the latitude (so 90-phi) as explained above). Please let me know whether I got anything wrong about these relationships in your (or other's) opinion! All the best, and thank you for following up on this, Stefanie On Tue, Jul 5, 2016 at 8:45 AM, Andreas Widmann <widmann at uni-leipzig.de> wrote: > Dear Stefanie, > > to my understanding sph_theta and sph_phi directly reflect longitude and > latitude, respectively.
