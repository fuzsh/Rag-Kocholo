What is latitude and longitude? These are the imaginary lines that go around and from pole to pole on a globe, respectively. If you know latitude and longitude, you can find any place on Earth. In order to do that you will have to know how to read and write coordinates. We will explain how to do this in the text below. We will also show you the principles of converting coordinates and give a step-by-step examples for the Sydney Opera House and the Empire State Building.\n\nWould you like to know how latitude and longitude coordinates are connected to time zones? Check the answer in the lat long to UTM converter!\n\nWhat is latitude and longitude?\n\nWith coordinates, you can locate any place on the Earth to a high degree of accuracy. The geographical coordinate system is based on the spherical coordinate system for an ellipsoid - the shape of the Earth. It originates from the intersection of the Prime Meridian (Greenwich, England) with the Equator. We specify coordinates using latitude and longitude. But what are they exactly?\n\nLatitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the line extending from the center of the Earth to a certain point on its surface. It references the north-south position on the Earth. It's represented by circles of latitude, or parallels - the lines that go around the globe. The central line of latitude is called the Equator. It has a latitude of 0 degrees. The maximum value of latitude is 90 degrees - found at the poles.\n\nLongitude, on the other hand, refers to a east-west position on the Earth. Lines of longitude, or meridians connect the North and the South Pole. They extend to the east and west of the Prime Meridian, reaching up to 180 degrees. All meridians have the same length - 12,429.9 miles (20,003.93 km).\n\nDid you know that you can calculate the shortest possible distance between two points of known geographical coordinates using latitude and longitude? Learn more about it in the latitude longitude distance calculator. Additionally, with the azimuth calculator, you can estimate the direction you need to point your compass to get from one point to the other!\n\nNow that you know what is latitude and longitude, let's see how to write coordinates in GPS, our lat long converter, or any other tool.\n\nHow to write coordinates?\n\nThe first rule of writing coordinates is:\n\nFirst comes the latitude, then the longitude.\n\nSometimes to help distinguish between latitude and longitude, their respective symbols are included: φ (phi) for latitude and λ (lambda) for longitude. To formulate coordinates you can use:\n\nDD (decimal degrees - °)\n\nDMS (degrees - °, minutes - ', seconds - \")\n\nDDM (degrees (°), decimal minutes ('))\n\nTo specify the cardinal direction, you can use letters or positive and negative numbers. For latitude, northern directions may be indicated by the letter N or a positive number, and southern directions can be marked with either the letter S or a negative value. For longitude, you can use the letter E or a positive number for the eastern direction, and the western direction can be indicated by the letter W, or a negative number. Remember - don't mix the forms! If you're using letters, values should always be positive.\n\nExpressing the direction with positive or negative values is common in the DD format of coordinates. It's less popular with DMS or DDM.\n\nFor example, let's see how to write the coordinates for two places: the Empire State Building in New York - a city located west of the Prime Meridian and in the northern hemisphere - and Sydney Opera House - east of the Prime Meridian and in the southern hemisphere.\n\nHere are some acceptable forms of latitude and longitude coordinates:\n\nEmpire State Building:\n\n40.748417, -73.985833 (DD)\n\n40.748417 N, 73.985833 W (DD)\n\n40 44 54.3 φ N, 73 59 9 λ W (DMS)\n\nSydney Opera House:\n\n-33.858611 φ, 151.214167 λ (DD)\n\n33 51.5167 S, 151 12.8500 E (DDM)\n\n33° 51′ 31″ S, 151° 12′ 51″ E (DMS)\n\nPlease note that the °, ', \" symbols aren't mandatory. If you are not using them, the numbers of degrees, minutes, and seconds are separated by spaces instead.\n\nHow to convert latitude and longitude coordinates?\n\nThere are 60 minutes in a degree, and there are 60 seconds in one minute. That means that in one degree, there are 3600 seconds. When you realize that, the DMS to DD formula is obvious:\n\nDecimal degrees = Degrees + Minutes/60 + Seconds/3600\n\nLet's convert the latitude and longitude coordinates of the Empire State Building. The coordinates are 40° 44′ 54.3″ N, 73° 59′ 9″ W. So its latitude in decimal degrees is:\n\nDD = 40 + 44/60 + 54.3/3600 = 40.748417\n\nAnd longitude:\n\nDD = 73 + 59/60 + 9/3600 = 73.985833\n\nCoordinates in the northern hemisphere have positive values. Coordinate west of the Prime Meridian have negative values. So the geographic coordinates of Empire State Building are: 40.748417 -73.985833.\n\nTo convert from degrees with decimal minutes to decimal degrees shortens the formula:\n\nDD = Degrees + Decimal minutes / 60\n\nConverting in the opposite direction is slightly harder. But don't worry. We will explain it step by step below.\n\nHow to convert coordinates in DD to DMS, or DDM?\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat does DDM stand for in coordinates?\n\nDDM stands for degrees (°) decimal minutes (').\n\nHow do you convert latitude and longitude to decimal degrees?\n\nTo convert latitude and longitude to decimal degrees, use this formula:\n\nDecimal degrees = Degrees + Minutes/60 + Seconds/3600\n\nFor example, the White House's coordinates are 38° 53' 52.6452'' N and 77° 2' 11.6160'' W. Therefore, its latitude in decimal degrees equals 38.897957 N, and its longitude equals 77.036560 W.\n\nWhat is an example of a DDM format?\n\nAn example of DDM format is 33° 51.5167' S, 151° 12.8500' E. These are the coordinates of the Sydney Opera House.\n\nHow do I find DDM coordinates?\n\nTo find degrees and decimal minutes (DDM) coordinates from decimal degrees (DD):\n\nTake the integer — these are the degrees.\n\nMultiply the decimal part by 60 — these are the decimal minutes.\n\nFor example, the White House's latitude in DD format is 38.897957 N. To convert it to DDM:\n\nThe integer in 38.897957 is 38.\n\nThe decimal part 0.897957 multiplied by 60 equals 53.87742.\n\nTherefore, the latitude in DDM format is 38° 53.87742' N."
