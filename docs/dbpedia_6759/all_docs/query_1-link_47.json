        "text": "The aprs.fi API (Application Programming Interface) allows application developers to query the aprs.fi database from their own web applications. To use the API you need to sign up for an user account on aprs.fi - your API key can be found in the account settings (Moje konto).\n\nTerms:\n\nYou are required to credit aprs.fi as the source of the data, and to provide a link back to aprs.fi. Links with text color equal to the background color do not count.\n\nThe API may only be used by applications which are free to use and available to the general public. If you wish to use the API for a paid-for application, please contact me and give a suggestion on a revenue sharing model.\n\nIt's OK to have advertisements on your site (like aprs.fi does) to cover the costs of hosting, hardware, etc.\n\nIf your application requires registration, it must be free and automated.\n\nIf you are going to distribute your application to others, please have each user apply for their own API key. Requests are rate limited per user account / API key, and having everyone use the same key will hit the limits faster. If your application requires using a constant API key (for example, the application is targeted to the masses and is distributed in binary form, and must be easy to install), please get in touch with me and describe your requirements, so that the rate limits can be tuned for the application.\n\nIf you're going to distribute your application, please get in touch, in any case. It's nice to hear how the API is used, and I'm happy to give feedback and advice on how to best use it. My email address can be found in the blogger profile, or you can send a mail on the discussion group.\n\nYour application must identify it's unique name, version, and a link to it's home page in the HTTP User-Agent header of the request. For example, here's what one application sends:\n\nUser-Agent: findlinks/1.1.6-beta1 (+http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/findlinks/)\n\nThe application may only request data when it is actively needed by the end-user. Do not preload, pre-cache, or collect data using the API for archival purposes. Most private web sites only get a request once per few hours, so they should not update their data automatically every minute on the background, as it will only increase the load unnecessarily.\n\nThe previous clause does not prohibit caching. Caching is good. When an user requests data from your service, fetch it from aprs.fi, and cache it for some time so that you can reuse it in case some other user needs the same data.\n\nThe service may or may not be available at any time. The availability is generally very good, but as always, there are no guarantees. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.\n\nThe API may be shut down at any time without notice, or your account may be cancelled with or without reason. I'll try to warn you on the blog and discussion group if that should happen.\n\nPlease behave nicely - if this service is abused, it might just go away. Thank you!\n\nHave fun!\n\nThe API is supposed to be used for developing applications which add value to the data collected by aprs.fi. It may not be used to simply copy all of the data to another site providing exactly the same features as aprs.fi. If you wish to set up a clone site, please collect your data directly from the APRS-IS - it's easy to parse using Ham::APRS::FAP.\n\nThe API limits the rate of requests to a sensible level, which can be adjusted if needed. The limits are designed to protect aprs.fi from too heavy load, and to protect the database contents from harvesting. If your application hits the limits and you'd like to have a larger quota, please get in touch and describe your application's needs in detail.\n\nMost requests should normally be served within tens of milliseconds, since they do not usually require any disk access. In any case, you should write your application so that it will time out requests in a few seconds. If multiple requests fail in a row, your application should assume that the service is not available and slow down the rate of attempts using an exponential backoff algorithm.\n\nThe API returns data in either JSON or XML format, JSON being the default and recommended format since it has much smaller overhead when compared to XML. XML responses can be easily twice as large as the equivalent JSON responses. See json.org for parsing instructions. If you're programming in PHP, json_decode is your friend.\n\nThis document lists all the API calls available. If a function is not listed here, it is not there; unfortunately there are not hidden gems to be found.\n\nBasic location query using JSON:\n\nBasic location query using XML:\n\nQuerying multiple targets using a single request:\n\nQuerying weather data:\n\nQuerying text messages:\n\nError reporting:"
