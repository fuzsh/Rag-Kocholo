Longitude is the angular distance of a place east or west of the meridian at Greenwich, England, or west of the standard meridian of a celestial object. Latitude is the angular distance of a place north or south of the earth's equator. The degree of the angle is between -90° and 90°. longitude and latitude coordinates are usually expressed in degrees and minutes.\n\nEvery location consists of a latitude and longitude which is like an unique address for each point. By giving the latitude and longitude, we can track down exactly where someone is located.\n\nGPS and navigation tools are developed to help drivers navigate every state and city.
