Section 25.2.4 could be read that way as it does point out that the angle unit is a choice. The problem with using angle standard units is that authors would want to use radians for orientations and rotations but at the same time degrees for latitude/longitude. In my experience radians is very rarely used as a unit for geodetic coordinates. The only example example I can think of is in equations. Some options: 1) no changes to the spec., modify examples 2) prescribe degrees as unit for geodetic coordinates in section 25.2.4 3) add a standard unit for angular distance in Table 4.2 ( http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/concepts.html#t-Standardunits) with a default of degrees and refer to that in 25.2.4 My preference would be option 2), followed by 3). Therefore I propose that in section 25.2.4, second paragraph: \" Latitude and longitude are given in units of angle base units. The following assumes an angle base unit of degrees. If a UNIT statement for angle base units has been provided, the following values for latitude and/or longitude should be suitable converted to that angle base units.\" shall be replaced by: \" Latitude and longitude are given in units of degrees.\" for simplicity.
