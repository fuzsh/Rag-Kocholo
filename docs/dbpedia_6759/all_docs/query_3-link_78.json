        "text": "The thread 'distance between lon and lat', at the end of last year, was\n\ninteresting. Those with an interest in the subject might want to look at\n\nthe Haversine Formula on the page linked below. I can't remember if this\n\nwas mentioned in the thread or not, the thread is so long it'll take ages\n\nto check, and my useless newsgroup software won't let me search!\n\nHaversine Formula:\n\nhttp://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/gis-faq-5.1.html\n\nMy question is slightly different. The mean radius of the Earth is approx.\n\n6,372 km, but what formula is used to calculate the radius of the Earth\n\nfor any given latitude?\n\nI wish my trig was up to working this out but I'm just a humble computer\n\nscientist with no degree in math.\n\nThank you all for any help in this.\n\n\n\nThanks, but I think I explained my question badly; I'll re-phrase it.\n\nFor any specific latitude, what is the formula for calculating the radius\n\nof the Earth at that latitude.\n\nSo if I wish to calculate the radius of the Earth at the latitude of\n\nN56:29:35 (56.492956), what formula can I use?\n\nThanks.\n\nIn article <47a24d4b$0$2112$edfa...@dtext02.news.tele.dk>,\n\n\"Uffe Kousgaard\" <o...@no.no> wrote:\n\n\n\nActually, your approach calculates the radius of a circle of latitude.\n\nThe radius of curvature of the Earth is a bit more complicated.\n\nThis issue is discussed in rather excruciating detail in the FAQ 5.1\n\narticle I mentioned in my previous post. (Look for the section labeled\n\n5.1a which is just short of half way through the article.) For\n\nconvenience, and because that post could easily get separated from this\n\none, here it is again:\n\nhttp://www.usenet-replayer.com/faq/comp.infosystems.gis.html\n\n- Bob\n\nUffe,\n\neventhough your question might look clear, it is in fact very vague. If\n\nyou are a seaman, you are looking for a seaman answer.\n\nIf your are a geodesist, you are looking for a geodesist answer.\n\nIf you are a mathematician, you are looking for a mathematical answer.\n\nHere is a possible answer\n\nThe geoid:\n\nThe hypothetical surface of the Earth that coincides everywhere with\n\nmean sea level and is perpendicular, at every point, to the direction of\n\ngravity. The geoid is used as a reference surface for astronomical\n\nmeasurements and for the accurate measurement of elevations on the\n\nEarth's surface.\n\nFrom that point of view, there is no formula to calculate the radius of\n\nEarth, just readings from surveys.\n\nThe reference ellipsoid:\n\nIn geodesy, a reference ellipsoid is a mathematically-defined surface\n\nthat approximates the geoid, the truer figure of the Earth, or other\n\nplanetary body. Because of their relative simplicity, reference\n\nellipsoids are used as a preferred surface on which geodetic network\n\ncomputations are performed and point coordinates such as latitude,\n\nlongitude, and elevation are defined.\n\nIf you take WGS84 as a reference ellipsoid, the Earth is flattened by\n\n1/298.257\n\nThen you can calculate the radius for each latitude.\n\nSeamen use the great circle for long planning routes. They assume,\n\nwithout large errors, that the Earth is spherical.\n\nAs you see, a question can rise many more questions\n\nJacquelin Hardy\n\na seaman that likes maths.\n\nUffe Kousgaard a écrit :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I think Uffe knows the answers!\n\nJacquelin is quite correct. I haven't bothered getting involved in\n\nthis discussion because as Jacquelin says, the answer is \"it depends\n\non your application\". The original poster was being confused by\n\nattempting to compute distances in a projected coordinate system,\n\nwhich is a necessarily inaccurate way of carrying out the measurement\n\n(I know, it IS accurate if you are doing distance from the pole of\n\nprojection of an equidistant projection, but typically that isn't the\n\ncase, and wasn't the case for the OP). In fact I suspect that the\n\nsimple cosine rule formula was quite accurate enough for his or her\n\nneeds; the difference between spherical geometry, ellipsoidal geometry\n\nand surveyed distance on a geoid is only likely to bother a surveyor\n\nlooking for closure in a survey. Over long distances, the difference\n\nis less than a kilometre - and that's for distances between Antarctica\n\nand Europe.\n\nA practical solution: if you want a good geodetic distance calcluator,\n\nthen use geod which is bundled with proj. That is a) robust b) written\n\nby an expert in the field of geodesy (Gerry Evenden), c) accurate and\n\nd) free! As far as I'm concerned, this is the gold standard for great\n\ncircle calculations on the ellipsoid; it avoids all the\n\ncomputationally nasty things that can happen if you roll your own! And\n\nas Jacquelin has pointed out, you can't compute distance on the geoid\n\nanalytically - but I think the difference would be less than a\n\nmillimetre! It is worth noting that the maximum vertical distance\n\nbetween sphere and ellipsoid is about 11km. The maximum vertical\n\ndistance between ellipsoid and geoid is +85 metres to -106 metres);\n\nthe ellipsoid is a fantastically accurate depiction of the shape of\n\nthe Earth.\n\nPaul"
