        "text": "Blindenbuch by Olaf Wegewitz (born October 2, 1949), a German artist who investigates the relationship between human culture and nature. Artist book for the blind. One of 45 copies, published in 1988 in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), a state that existed from 1949 to 1990 - the period when the eastern portion of Germany was part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Housed within original paper box with handwritten title, date and inscription. Ceramic covers, painted black and with incisions by Olaf Wegewitz and Frieder Heinze. Front board attached by sewing. Spine and back board covered in linen. Quarto with sewn binding. Collation: 4° : [1] leaf, [6] leaves of braille, with [9] leaves of plates (first leaf blank). Plates printed with embossed, colorless images. Contributors: Ralf Klement, Frieder Heinze, Fotis Zaprasis and Günther Huniat. Wegewitz completed an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanic in 1966. He practiced the profession until 1971. Then he worked as a “paperwall” - a gluer, in Leipzig until 1975. He taught himself the ideas of the Bauhaus. In 1974/75, he studied with Hans Schulze at the Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig and then worked as a freelance graphic artist and painter, beginning in 1975. In 1984, Wegewitz was one of the initiators of the First Leipzig Autumn Salon, a semi-legal exhibition in the Messehaus, which was organized secretly and intended as a protest against official art exhibitions and failed reforms in the East German art system. The organizers were responding, in part, to the censorship of their prior works in previous, sanctioned GDR exhibitions. This private exhibition lasted from November 15, 1984 to December 7, 1984 and attracted many visitors. Cultural functionaries did not ban the exhibition, but only because they feared protests if the exhibition had been forced to close. From 1980 onwards, Wegewitz worked with painter Frieder Heinze. Wegewitz continued to explore the human perception of nature, including the topics of fruit growing and beekeeping. In addition, Wegewitz has crossed Germany on foot twice in recent years, along the 11th degree of longitude between Fehmarn and the Zugspitze in 2009 and along the 51st degree of latitude between Geilenkirchen and Görlitz in 2012. Both walks resulted in artistic works. In 1999, Wegewitz was awarded the Art Prize of the State of Saxony-Anhalt, and in 2021 he was awarded the Antiquaria Prize for his book art work."
