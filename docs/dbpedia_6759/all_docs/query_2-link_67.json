In most cases, the elevations were determined from surveys and from 1:24,000- and 1:25,000-scale, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps. In Alaska, information was taken from 1:63,360-scale, 15-minute topographic quadrangle maps. In a few cases, data were obtained from older, 1:62,500-scale, 15-minute maps; these maps have been replaced with larger scale 7.5-minute coverage.\n\nFurther information about U.S. Geological Survey products can be obtained from: U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Science Information Center, 507 National Center, Reston, VA 20192 or phone 1-888-ASK-USGS, E-mail: ask@usgs.gov, TTY: 703-648-4119.\n\n||

there may be as many geographic centers of a State or county as there are definitions of the term.\n\nThe geographic center of an area may be defined as the center of gravity of the surface, or that point on which the surface of an area would balance if it were a plane of uniform thickness.\n\nCurvature of the Earth, large bodies of water, irregular surfaces, and other factors affect the determination of center of gravity.\n\nIn determining the centers of the States, islands adjacent to their coastlines and large bodies of water were excluded.\n\nThe geographic centers and positions listed below should be considered as approximations.\n\nState County Locality Alabama Chilton 12 miles southwest of Clanton Alaska 63Â°50' N., 152Â°00' W., 60 miles northwest of Mount McKinley Arizona

However, a monument was erected in Lebanon, Kansas, by a group of citizens who hired engineers to determine the position of the \"geographic center\" of the United States.\n\nSometimes confused with geographic center of the United States is the triangulation station \"Meades Ranch,\" located at latitude 39Â°13'26.686\" North and longitude 98Â°32'30.506\" West, about 12 miles north of Lucas, Kansas. This was the primary reference point for the North American Datum of 1927, the standard on which all the latitude and longitude lines for North America were based. This datum is being replaced by the North American Datum of 1983, which is not hinged to a single point of reference.\n\n|| Top || Table of Contents||\n\nDistances From Extreme Points to Geographic Centers\n\nExtreme Point Coordinates Direction from\n\ngeographic centers 50 States*\n\nStatute Miles 49 States**\n\nStatute Miles 48 States***\n\nStatute Miles Latitude\n\n(N) Longitude\n\n(W.)
