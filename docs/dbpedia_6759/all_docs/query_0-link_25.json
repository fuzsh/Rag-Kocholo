        "text": "Arctic Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and Surface Processes, And Feedback Mechanisms\n\nFunding: German Research Council\n\nProject period: 01.01.2016 – 31.12.2027\n\nPlanet earth has warmed on average by 0.87 K over the past 150 years. In the Arctic, the warming is much larger, which became most prominent over the last decades. Currently, the Arctic warming exceeds the increase of near-surface air temperature in the mid-latitudes by about 2 K. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as Arctic amplification.\n\nRead more\n\nThe causes and consequences of exceptionally strong stratospheric polar vortices and the associated ozone holes: from seasonal to seasonal to long-term effects (ENRICH)\n\nFunding: German Research Council\n\nProject period: 01.05.2023 – 30.04.2026\n\nTeam: Anish Kumar, Dr. Khalil Karami\n\nWhile the ozone hole develops over the Antarctic every year during austral spring, the conditions that are required for such substantial ozone depletion are not normally found in the Arctic during boreal spring (WMO [World Meteorological Organization], Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, 2018). However, there are a few notable exceptions to this paradigm. For example, Manney et al. (2011) and Sinnhuber et al. (2011) reported that the Arctic ozone concentrations were at the brink of an ozone hole during winter 2010/2011 which was mainly due to the stable and cold Arctic polar vortex during that season.\n\nObjectives\n\nOur research aims to investigate the causes and consequences of exceptionally cold and stable Arctic polar vortices and their associated ozone holes during winter/spring 2011 and 2020. The project will use the ICON (ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic model) atmospheric model inconjunction with the ART module (Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases, Rieger et al. 2015) with different simulation setups (time-slice experiments, interactive and non-interactive stratospheric chemistry, with and without ozone-depleting substances (ODSs)). In addition, extensive use of complementary data is planned: CMIP6 model simulations, reanalysis data (ERA5 and MERRA) and GPS radio occultation observations (COSMIC, COSMIC-2a and CHAMP). The GPS observations will be used to estimate the amplitude of the gravity wave in the stratosphere prior\n\nand during winter/spring 2011 and 2020. In addition, the ICON-ART results and reanalysis data are separated into the balanced (Rossby) and and inertio-gravity (IG) circulations across many scales using the MODES software (Žagar et al, 2015). We hypothesize that either the anomalous injection of the upward propagating waves (both resolved Rossby waves and unresolved gravity waves) or the anomalous geometry of the polar vortex led to such anomalous ozone hole conditions during winter/spring 2011 and 2020. Additionally, we hypothesize that using interactive chemistry is essential to capture the full spectrum of the stratospheric variability, which is critical to capturing the downward influence of the stratospheric polar vortex on the troposphere.\n\nThe objectives of the project can be summarized in the following research questions (RQ 1-4):\n\n(1) To what extend has climate change contributed to the formation of exceptionally strong polar vortices and associated ozone holes in winter/spring 2011 and 2020?. What is the fate of such extreme events under climate change?\n\n(2) What would have happened to ENRICH-like events under future climate projections, in the coming decades, if the negotiation and ratification of the Montreal Protocol had not been implemented (World Avoided scenario)?\n\n(3) What are the relative contributions of dynamical (balanced (Rossby) mode versus inertiagravity mode) forcing versus chemical/thermodynamic changes in the formation of the extreme polar vortices in present and future climate?\n\n(4) What are the consequences of such extreme stratospheric situations (strong polar vortex and low/depleted ozone in the NH) for tropospheric weather?\n\nDelayed response of the ionosphere to solar EUV II variability (DRIVAR II)\n\nFunding: German Reseach Foundation\n\nPeriod: 01.05.2022 – 31.04.2025\n\nTeam: Dr. Rajesh Ishwardas Vaishnav, Prof. Dr. Christoph Jacobi\n\nCooperation partner: German Aresospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Communications and Navigation\n\nThe ionospheric plasma reacts on solar EUV and UV variations in the course of the solar rotation with a time delay of 1-2 days. This delay is assumed to be owing to transport processes from the lower ionosphere to the F region, but only limited modeling has been performed so far to prove this hypothesis.\n\nWithin DRIVAR, the processes responsible for the ionospheric delay will be investigated through comprehensive data analyses and modeling. Different kinds of solar proxies as well as spectral EUV and UV fluxes from satellite observations will be used and analyzed together with ionospheric parameters from GPS radio occultations and ionosondes, and, providing both global and high-resolution coverage, GPS total electron content maps. In particular, the ionospheric delay will be analyzed at different time scales (short-term, solar rotation, seasonal time scale), and the regional dependence of the delay will be analyzed.\n\nLocal gravity wave forcing on the middle atmosphere: formation, effects, and long-term trends\n\nFunding: German Research Foundation (DFG)\n\nProject period: 01.05.2021 – 31.10.2024\n\nTeam: Dr. Khalil Karami, Prof. Dr. Christoph Jacobi\n\nCooperation partners: Department of Atmospheric Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic (DAP).\n\nThe MATELO-FILE project focuses on the detection, analysis, and modelling of stratospheric gravity wave (GW) hotspotsand their effect on the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. To this end, we willidentify GWhotspotson the basis of observations,reanalysis dataand model output by analysing different GW parameters, and also background conditions. From these analyseswe will deduce possible GW sources as well as meteorological conditionsthatfavour the generation of GWhotspots. Based on these results fromthe datasets partly covering several decades, we will also investigate the temporal development of these GW hotspots to investigatein how far the GW hotspot activity has changed during the last decades. To analysethe interactionprocessesof these GW hotspots with the circulation of the middle atmosphere (the wave forcing itself as well as a compensation mechanism), experiments with the UA-ICON global circulation model and a further mechanistic circulation modelwill be performed. This will enable us toinvestigate (i) howthe GW hotspots and their effects are reproduced in climate models, (ii) their influence on circulation changes in a changing climate, and (iii) how they react on a changing climate.\n\nMeteor Radar Winds and Wind Observation over Collm\n\nCooperation partner: Institute of Amtospheric Physics, Kühlungsborn\n\nThe mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) is one of the scientifically most challenging regions of the atmosphere. The MLT is the region where wave-wave and wave-mean flow interaction processes lead to a mean circulation regime that is extremely far from radiative equilibrium. Although radar measurements of MLT winds are possible since more than half a century, our current knowledge on MLT dynamics is still far from complete, mostly due to incomplete coverage of the global wind field by ground-based remote sensing system.\n\nAs a contribution to our knowledge of MLT dynamics a SKiYMET meteor radar is operated at Collm Observatory (51.3°N, 13°E) continuously since August 2004. The measurements deliver hourly wind information in the height range 80-100 km and daily mean temperatures near the mesopause. Together with the earlier LF wind measurements peformed at Collm 1959 - 2008 a unique MLT circulation parameter dataset is available.\n\nData of the SKiyMet meteor radar\n\nRecently, the MMARIA (Multi-static, Multifrequency Agile Radar for Investigations of the Atmosphere) concept of a multi-static VHF meteor radar network to derive horizontally resolved wind fields in the mesosphere–lower thermosphere was introduced, using two transmitters located at Juliusruh and Collm, and several receiving links (Stober et al., 2018). This allows to retrieve horizontally resolves winds over Eastern Germany.\n\nSelected publications:\n\nJacobi, Ch., C. Geißler, F. Lilienthal, and A.

They are generally formed at altitudes between 90 km and 120 km, which is equivalent to the upper MLT and the lower ionospheric E region. According to wind shear theory the forming process of Es is an interaction between the Earth's magnetic field, the ion concentration as well as the vertical wind shear.\n\nAt Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam, Es occurrence rates are derived from GPS radio occultations. These data are used mainly to analyse the influence of neutral dynamics on Es.\n\nPublications within the project:\n\nJacobi, Ch., and C.

These meteorological influences are mainly due to atmospheric waves propagating from the lower atmosphere to the thermosphere. Transferring energy and momentum, they modify thermospheric and ionospheric parameters. Atmospheric waves not only reflect dynamical features of the lower/middle atmosphere, but also exhibit long-term trends. Consequently, not only the widely known greenhouse gas cooling contributes to thermospheric long-term changes, but atmospheric wave trends also, and a comprehensive description of upper atmosphere trends will have to include this wave variability and trends.\n\nTo quantify the effect of lower and middle atmosphere wave coupling on upper atmosphere dynamics, VACILT aims at observing, modeling, and rigorously quantifying interannual and long-term changes of lower and middle atmosphere waves and their effects in the upper atmosphere. To this end, long-term (> 30 years) radar observations will be analyzed with respect to waves and mean circulation trends. These analyses will be compared with results of a long-term, lower atmosphere driven simulation of the GAIA Earth System Model, which in turn will be supported by the analysis of thermospheric observations.\n\nFrom the GAIA analyses, the lower atmosphere forcing on the thermosphere due to waves will be quantified. The variability of this forcing will be determined and interpreted in the context of lower atmosphere variability. To substantiate the results, sensitivity experiments with a mechanistic model will be performed.\n\nMain goals of VACILT are\n\na quantitative description of interannual and long-term variability and trends in the middle atmosphere and thermosphere by analyzing the mean circulation and wave parameters from Earth System Model, supported by ground-based and satellite observations\n\nquantitative estimates of the degree of wave coupling effects in the upper atmosphere\n\na comprehensive analysis of the role of middle-upper atmosphere wave coupling in forcing upper atmosphere long-term trends and variations, in relation to other drivers like greenhouse gas cooling.\n\nPublikationen zum Thema VACILT:\n\nPublications related to VACILT:\n\nLilienthal, F., N.

The influence of these differences on the representativeness of single sites for describing zonal means of winds and wave parameters will be quantified. This will allow us to quantitatively estimate the uncertainty of mean climatology, long-term trends, and measures of interannual variability observed at single sites. The contribution of non-zonal structures to mean circulation and its variability will be determined. Hemispheric analyses of lower and middle atmosphere waves and circulation parameters will be used to analyze the role of these in establishing longitudinal differences. This will then resolve the question whether there is a significant difference between the mid-latitude MLT wind regimes in Western and Eastern Europe, and which are the underlying processes leading to these differences.\n\nThe NOSTHEM project will make use of the two very similar VHF meteor radar observations at similar latitude, but with a 36° difference in longitude in order to specify quantitatively the influence of non-zonal structures on mean circulation, waves and tides. In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of non-zonal structures in the MLT dynamics, the concurrent observations of winds and temperatures using VHF radars at Collm and Kazan will be completed by numerical modeling using a circulation model of the middle atmosphere, satellite observations, and reanalyses.\n\nMain goals of NOSTHEM are (1) a quantitative description of similarities and differences of MLT circulation parameters at two longitudes, (2) an extrapolation of this analysis to the full hemispheric view based on satellite observations and modeling, and (3) a quantitative estimation of the role of waves in the specific characteristic of circulation parameters at single sites. As a final goal, we shall explain longitudinal differences through their underlying processes, and also provide guidelines for the interpretation of both mean climatology and trend analyses made at single sites in terms of their representativeness for hemispheric dynamics.\n\nPublications related to the project:\n\nMerzlyakov, E., T.

This delay is assumed to be owing to transport processes from the lower ionosphere to the F region, but only limited modeling has been performed so far to prove this hypothesis.\n\nWithin DRIVAR, the processes responsible for the ionospheric delay will be investigated through comprehensive data analyses and modeling. Different kinds of solar proxies as well as spectral EUV and UV fluxes from satellite observations will be used and analyzed together with ionospheric parameters from GPS radio occultations and ionosondes, and, providing both global and high-resolution coverage, GPS total electron content maps. In particular, the ionospheric delay will be analyzed at different time scales (short-term, solar rotation, seasonal time scale), and the regional dependence of the delay will be analyzed.\n\nThe DRIVAR results will provide more insight into ionospheric processes in general, and will be most valuable for ionospheric applications in forecasting ionospheric weather, e.g. for the use in GNSS error analyses and predictions.\n\nDue to the complex character of numerous interacting processes in the thermosphere and ionosphere numerical modeling is required to physically understand the basic processes contributing to the delay. We shall use the Coupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics (CTIPe) model to simulate the delay and, through sensitivity experiments, investigate and analyze in detail the processes that lead to the observed delay.\n\nPublications related to the project:\n\nSchmölter, E., J.

Pišoft)\n\nThe project involves a study of the middle atmosphere effects of localized internal gravity wave (IGW) forcing. Characteristics of the higher IGW activity regions, their spatial and temporal variability and links to other climate factors will be studied using GPS radio occultations. We will implement algorithms for full 3D diagnostics of the wave forcing and Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC). The diagnostics will be applied along with numerical simulations of a mechanistic circulation model and reanalysis data in order to specify the BDC longitudinal variability and the role of the localized IGW forcing. In the next step, we will study the generation and propagation directions of planetary waves forced by the localized IGW forcing. Implications for the polar regions (circulation perturbations, winter preconditioning, sudden stratospheric warming characteristics), equatorial stratosphere (tropopause folds links, influence on the exchange with the troposphere) and mesosphere will be studied using the numerical simulations. The results will be evaluated in the context of the global middle atmospheric mean circulation and its variability.\n\nPublications related to the project:\n\nSamtleben, N., A. Kuchar, P. Šácha, P.

Merzlyakov)\n\nHelmholtz Centre Potsdam - GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences (Dr. C. Arras)\n\nThe dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) is strongly determined by solar tides and their variability. One of the tidal components is the quarterdiurnal tide (QTD), which has occasionally been reported in ionospheric sporadic E parameters and radar and few satellite observations. While the diurnal, semidiurnal, and also terdiurnal tidal components have been analyzed more frequently, the QDT hast attained much less attention, mainly owing to its smaller amplitudes, which makes observations more difficult.\n\nTo fill this gap, within QuarTA the QDT and its forcing mechanisms are analyzed in detail. The characteristics of the tide in MLT dynamics is analyzed using meteor radar winds, in particular making use of the long-term data set at Collm, Germany, in combination with other Northern Hemisphere radar observations. The global structure of the QDT is analyzed in sporadic E occurrence rates obtained from GPS radio occultations complemented by ionosonde observations. These observations are interpreted by wind shear observed by radar and obtained from numerical modelling.\n\nTo get insight into the forcing mechanisms of the QDT, we use a mechanistic circulation model of the middle atmosphere, which includes nonlinear interaction processes as well as radiative forcing. In sensitivity experiments, the different forcing mechanisms are turned off both separately and in combination.\n\nWithin QuarTA, from combining local and global observations with numerical modelling, we therefore expect to get more insight into the global structure of the QDT as well as into its forcing processes, which have not yet been analyzed in sufficient detail.\n\nPublications related to the project:\n\nGeißler, C., Ch.

Phys., 69, 2238–2248.\n\nEmpirical and semiempirical models of middle atmosphere wind and wind variability\n\nPeriod: 2004 – 2006\n\nPartnership\n\nWe are 4 partners from 3 European countries, all of us regularly involved in mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) dynamics science, and carrying out MLT and measurements:\n\nInstitute for Meteorology, University of Leipzig, Germany\n\nInstitute for Experimental Meteorology, Russia\n\nRadiophysics Department, Kazan State University, Russia\n\nHovemere Ltd., UK\n\nSummary\n\nThe research programme contains the construction of global, monthly tables of wind and its variability in the atmosphere up to 100 km. This task is based on already existing models of winds and tides in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere, uses global analyses from Met Office reanalyses, and combines these analyses using a circulation model to include the mesosphere that is not well covered with measurements.\n\nIn summary, the project research programme consisted of the following tasks:\n\nUpdate of the mesosphere/lower thermosphere empirical mean wind model\n\nConstruction of a stratospheric mean wind model\n\nIncluding stationary planetary waves in models\n\nCalculating the degree of variability of winds\n\nConstruction of a semiempirical model of the entire middle atmosphere, through assimilation of the zonal mean winds into a circulation model\n\nValidation or the results using ground-based and space-based measurements\n\nThe project combined the efforts of 2 INTAS and 2 NIS partners, each having long experience in establishing empirical climatologies of the middle atmosphere, ground-based and space-based measurements and numerical modelling. The length of the project was 30 months. During this time interval an important step towards new and updated reference models were performed.\n\nContact:\n\nData sheets:\n\nSolar EUV measurements and ionospheric response\n\nThe project bases on a cooperation between\n\nUniversität Leipzig, Institut of Meteorology,\n\nDLR-Institute of Communications and Navigation, Neustrelitz,\n\nFraunhofer-Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques (IPM), Freiburg.\n\nThe SolACES project is led by IPM.\n\nThe SolACES spectrometers continuously monitors the EUV/UV radiation of the sun in the wavelength range between 17 and 220 nm onboard the ISS (DLR, 2006). SolACES is part of the SOLAR space science instrument package. The instruments are directed towards the sun.\n\nThe primary scientific goal of SolACES is to observe the spectral irradiance of the sun and its variation with time. The spectral resolution of these measurements will vary between 0.5 and 2 nm depending on wavelength. A novel feature of SolACES is its capability to auto-calibrate the instrument during the mission. EUV fluxes are anticipated to be measured with an absolute radiometric accuracy of better than 10%.\n\nA main goal of the project is to experimentally describe the response of the ionospheric electron density on mid-term solar flux changes. This requires the following analyses:\n\nInvestigation of the solar irradiance and its variability in the EUV range based upon SolACES EUV measurements\n\nInvestigation of the reaction of the neutral upper atmosphere composition, temperature and dynamics on variations in EUV flux using numerical models of the mesosphere/thermosphere\n\nStatistical study of the ionospheric response on EUV variations and EUV bursts using TEC data derived by ground and space based GPS measurements\n\nModelling the time delay between EUV variations and the ionospheric response as indicated qualitatively by TEC time series\n\nAs a result, a comprehensive and detailed picture of the ionospheric response to EUV variations will be given. Co-products are a data base of EUV variations, EUV/TEC correlations, and numerical model results of the undisturbed and disturbed thermosphere/ionosphere system for the duration of the SolACES measurement campaign.\n\nPublications with scientific quality assurance\n\nSchmidtke, G., S.V.
