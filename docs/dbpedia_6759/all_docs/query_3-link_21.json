        "text": "Home page.\n\nLatitude and Longitude\n\nHow do I find my lat and long ?\n\nWhat is my latitude longitude ?\n\nNavigation links, to my satellite dish pointing angle calculator\n\nexplanation of latitude and longitude\n\nDiscussion forum for latitude longitude finder page\n\nLarger satellite photo image viewer for finding your home as seen from space\n\nThis page costs me money to provide and therefore has a limited daily usage. Prior to its daily reset at 8am GMT the mapping may run out of its daily usage allowance and stop working. Sorry.\n\nThis page is under progressive development and I would appreciate your feedback and comments. I made an update which incorporated about 195 marker dots on the map to show the latitude longitude coordinates of large cities around the world. This is to help you find your lat-long more easily. For some visitors using IE this caused some 200 lines to appear in my log file each time some one accessed the page. I have now solved this \"feature of IE\" making the browser download the tiny square icon once only and then reuse it locally as needed for showing all the cities on the map.\n\nI have also upgraded to Version V2 and have reduced the number of markers for countries where there are now more detailed maps for France, Espana, Portugal, Deutchland, Nederland, Danmark, Belgie Belgique, Italie, Greece, Hungary, Switzerland, Austria, Sverige, Norge, Suomi Finland, Polska, Serbia Montenegro and Brazil. Only the USA, UK, Japan and Hong Kong previously had detailed maps. The number of markers is still rather large however and slows down the initial loading. In the case of Firefox you may get a time out \"Warning-Unresponsive Script\" message. Don't worry it is still working OK, just click continue. This problem should disappear in the future when more map data is added and the lat/long icons for the cities are no longer needed. Another minor matter is the clickable city/town markers themselves. In version V1, the markers were clickable. In V2 the marker is in fact a single pixel with a large clickable square shadow. The top left corner of the square shadow is not clickable - I have not resolved this.\n\nOn 6th June 2006, I added optional satellite dish pointing angles - azimuth, elevation and feed rotation polarisation angles. These are based on the latitude and longitude of your site location and the orbit position longitude of the geostationary satellite selected which is above the equator. Not all the bugs may be out of this yet. If you see problems please tell me. You need your latitude longitude location to about 0.1 degree accuracy for the satellite azimuth and elevation angle calculator. Accuracy is particularly important if you are near the equator and almost under the satellite. The polarization angle appears rotate rapidly as you move from one location to another in the sub-satellite area.\n\nThe Google satellite map database already includes some more detailed GPS type mapping information such as town, road and street maps for the US, UK, Ireland and Japan. In these cases you can use the detailed road and street maps to home in on your latitude and longitude. Here is a page if you want to see the satellite view of the ground at a latitude and longitude that you already know.\n\nIf the page is not working, hopefully I will have fixed it in a minute or so. Every time I upload a new version I check it works OK or go back to the previous version. This happens several times a day. If you have a GPS receiver I would be quite interested to know how close your GPS indicated location is to that shown here. Many GPS receivers may be set to give UK OSGB grid output format. Or, go here: to find the OSGB map reference for a particular place on the ground; this works only for places in and around the UK.\n\nRead visitor reviews of this page. You are welcome to please write your own review and send it to me at eric@satsig.net Your digital camera photo images also welcome.\n\nPage created 25th November 2005, amended 6th June 06 with added dish pointing angles. 18th May 06, with revised center.x converted to center.lng(), 28th April incorporating Google Maps API Version 2 Javascript upgrade and 2 May 2006 with a modification to cause the marker dot to be centered on the satellite map for both IE and Firefox. This dot should start off at twenty degrees latitude (north of the equator) and zero longitude i.e. to south of Greenwich and thus on the Greenwich meridian and follow the mouse clicks to mark the point that corresponds to the displayed values of latitude and longitude. Amended 14th Aug 2007 to add geocoding and allow you to input your town or city name. October 2007: Deleted some cities in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Burma Myanmar as they are now in the main database. Feedback please to me, Eric Johnston eric@satsig.net Thanks...\n\nIn Jan 2007 I removed city / town markers for Cairo, Egypt, Accra, Ghana Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Monrovia, Liberia and Lagos, Nigeria as these towns have now been added to the map database together with many more towns and roads in these countries. Each one I remove should slightly speed up the initial loading. As of 15th June 2007, the number of lat/long marker icons on the map has dropped to 97, following the deletion of cities and towns in Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Romania.\n\n7 Feb 2008: Several icons for towns in Mexico, Panama, Guatemala and Colombia removed (e.g. Medellin, Bogata and Cali).\n\n10 Apr 2008: Two towns added in Nepal: Pokhara and Bhanjyang\n\n24 April 2008 Default location for geocoder set to Gold Bar Road and marker added for Gold Bar Mill, Eureka, Nevada\n\n7 May 2008: Geocoder starting location is now Bassein, near Yangon in Burma, Myanmar, where there has been recent flooding due to a cyclone.\n\n5 June 2008: Significant html code changes to transition to HTML 4.01 Transitional and the validate the code.\n\n24 Nov 2008: Sensor parameter set to false as this web page is not associated with a GPS sensor device.\n\n5 Feb 2010: Added the feature to switch on or off the blue azimuth dish pointing direction line. This is of value when used with an enlarged scale as you can see how the dish might be oriented relative to the walls of your house or relative to nearby buildings.\n\n9 Aug 2010: Added optional extra decimal places for the lat long coordinates display.\n\n25 January 2011: The Google Maps API javascript software which makes this page work has been upgraded to V3. The last of my manually included city/town markers have been removed. Domodedovo airport, Moscow set at the default geolocation default.\n\n12 Sept 2012: Orbit position (31 west) added for Hylas 2 satellite. Azimuth direction line default set to ON.\n\n10 Dec 2012: A Google maps API key has been added so that the number of impressions of this page may be counted, to verify comply with the daily limit of 25000 free hits.\n\nClick here if you want latitude - longitude finder for dish pointing in Iraq Lebanon dish pointing and lat-long finder map\n\n6 May 2014: Prevented the display of longitudes in excess of 180 deg.\n\n15 April 2016: Link to the explanation of GMT changed to a good educational text on Wikipedia.\n\n27 March 2018: Earth's magnetic field model updated. True bearings and magnetic compass declination included in output.\n\nIn June 2018 Google started charging me for the use of maps as shown on this page. Even with their free quota I am exceeding it and have had bills of several hundred $ per month, which is too much.\n\nTo try and reduce demand, this page now has usage quotas: Users per 100 seconds. Requests per user per 100 seconds and total Requests per day.\n\n7 Dec 2018: I have removed a Geocoding function (where you type in the name of a wanted place) which worked till 4th Dec 2018. I have removed since it was costing me as much as the map requests and it was a luxury for you.\n\n18 Feb 2019: This page costs me money to provide and therefore has a limited daily quota usage. When it is using Google maps API the quota is reset at 8am GMT. In the hours prior to this the daily usage allowance may be exceeded and the map will then stop working. I am working to get an alternative using Mapbox.\n\n4 March 2020: I have updated the list of satellites in geostationary orbit as of 12 Feb 2024."
