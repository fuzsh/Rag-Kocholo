Relatively high in the north, the days are long in summer and short in winter.\n\nWith almost 17 hours, the longest days are in June. The sunset is then only at 21:33, whereby it can be, depending upon weather conditions, still somewhat bright for another hour. The longest dark nights are in winter (it is the other way around in the southern hemisphere). In December, the night in Berlin lasts almost 17 hours and the days start about 4 hours later.\n\nDuring these days, the sun in Berlin rises at 5:48. The sunset on the other hand is currently late at 20:33 in the evening.\n\nBack to overview: Germany"
