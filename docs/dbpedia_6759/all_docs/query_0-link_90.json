        "text": "Welcome to my new series of blogs – Irish Whiskey Around The World.\n\nIt will be celebrating the diversity & reach of Irish Whiskey marketed outside of the Island of Ireland.\n\nMore specifically it will focus on Irish Whiskey Brands commissioned by companies in those countries that are generally not available in Ireland itself.\n\nI’m starting with Latitude 53 Irish Whiskey from Nordic Spirits.\n\nDescribed as an unpretentious blended Irish Whiskey I’d have to travel to Norway, Sweden, Finland or Denmark to get my hands on one of these bottles.\n\nI do love the simplicity of presentation & factual name that lends a degree of pride of place to the product.\n\nIt’s not stated which distillery – or distilleries – the whiskey is sourced from. It could be stretched to 55 North for Bushmills or 51 North if West Cork Distillers did the honours- but that’s splitting hairs. Ireland is usually accepted as 53 N.\n\nThis is a standard ex-bourbon cask matured malt & grain blended Irish Whiskey that I’d be very happy to pick up if I ever manage to get back to Gothenburg.\n\nSkäl – as they say in Sweden.\n\nNordic Spirits webpage here.\n\nAll images courtesy Nordic Spirits"
