        "text": "Coordinates\n\nGPS coordinates are formed by two components that are a latitude , giving the north-south position, and a longitude, giving the east-west position.\n\nUse this map to convert any address in its GPS coordinates. You can also find the location of any GPS coordinates, and geocode its address if available.\n\nVisit the where am I page to get all the details of your current location coordinates.\n\nLatitude definition\n\nThe latitude of a point is the measurement of the angle formed by the equatorial plane with the line connecting this point to the center of the Earth.\n\nBy construction, it is comprised between -90 ° and 90 °. Negative values ​​are for the southern hemisphere locations, and latitude is worth 0 ° at the equator.\n\nLongitude definition\n\nThe principle is the same for the longitude, with the difference that there is no natural reference like the equator for the latitude. Longitude reference has been arbitrarily set at the Greenwich Meridian (it passes through the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Greenwich in the suburbs of London), and the longitude of a point is the measurement of the angle formed by the half plane formed by the axis of the earth and passes through the Greenwich meridian and the half-plane formed by the axis of the earth and passing through the point.\n\nA third component\n\nCareful readers would have alreay noticed that a third element is required to locate a point, its altitude. In the most typical use cases, GPS coordinates are needed for locations on the surface of the Earth, making this third parameter less important. However, it is as necessary as the latitude and longitude to define a complete and accurate GPS location.\n\nWhat3words\n\nWhat3words divided the world into 57 trillion squares, each measuring 3m by 3m (10ft by 10ft) and each having a unique, randomly assigned three-word address. Our coordinates converter helps you convert coordinates to w3w but also what3words to coordinates.\n\nMultiple geodetic systems for geographical coordinates\n\nAs we saw, the above definitions take into account several parameters that must be fixed or identified for future reference:\n\n- the equator plane and the model choser for the shape of the earth,\n\n- a set of reference points,\n\n- the position of the center of the Earth,\n\n- the earth axis,\n\n- the reference meridian.\n\nThese five criteria are the basis of the different geodetic systems used through history.\n\nCurrently, the most commonly used geodetic system is WGS 84 (used notably for GPS coordinates).\n\nGPS coordinates measurement units\n\nThe two main units of measurement are the decimal and sexagesimal coordinates.\n\nDecimal coordinates\n\nThe latitude and longitude are a decimal number, with the following characteristics:\n\n- latitude between 0° and 90°: Northern hemisphere,\n\n- latitude between 0° and -90°: Southern hemisphere,\n\n- longitude between 0° and 180°: East of the Greenwich meridian,\n\n- longitude between 0° and -180°: West of the Greenwich meridian,\n\nSexagesimal coordinates\n\nThe sexagesimal coordinates have three components: degrees, minutes and seconds. Each of these components is usually an integer, but the seconds can be a decimal number in case of need of a greater precision.\n\nOne angle degree includes 60 angle minutes and one angule minute consists of 60 angle seconds of arc.\n\nUnlike decimal coordinates the sexagesimal coordinates can not be negative. In their case, the letter W or E is added to the longitude to specify the position east-west from the Greenwich meridian, and the letter N or S to the latitude to designate the hemisphere (North or South).\n\nCorrelation table\n\nDecimal coordinates Sexagesimal coordinates Latitude Longitude Latitude Longitude 0° to 90° 0° to 180° N E 0° to 90° 0° to -180° N W 0° to -90° 0° to 180° S E 0° to -90° 0° to -180° S W\n\nLatitude and longitude finder"
