Cult horror sensation Litan, hooligan horror Kill the Referee and Hitchcockian mystery Agent Trouble are presented from new 4K restorations on Blu-ray for the first time outside of France.\n\nLitan (1982):\n\nA classic cult Euro-horror and a Kafkaesque fever dream of surrealist imagery, arrestingly shot by Edmond Richard (The Trial, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie).\n\nKill the Referee (1984):\n\nAn unrelenting one-night narrative recalling After Hours and Green Room, Kill the Referee mixes black humour with horror as its escalating sense of dread builds toward a shattering climax.\n\nAgent Trouble (1987):\n\nA conspiracy thriller reminiscent of Hitchcock, Jean-Pierre Mockyâ€™s wonderfully eccentric mystery has a light comic touch that carefully balances its grotesque flourishes."
