Long-awaited returns of truly singular artists- some after a decade (Glazer), some after 30 years (Erice)- were another rare pattern in a year characterized by constant flux, particularly the WGA/SAG strikes and the insistency with which circumstances technological and political demanded responses from an industry that frankly refused to respond effectively to either.\n\nAs such, the confluence of auteurist patterns and the industry’s attempts to reorganise itself around streaming (as opposed to theatrical distribution, which has thus far proven itself to be the arbiter of far greater cultural longevity than Netflix and its counterparts) have resulted in Late Style becoming almost irrevocably interlinked with VOD and streaming, with Hit Man (Richard Linklater, 2023), for instance, being picked up by Netflix before talks around a theatrical release even began. One of the more egregious instances of that pattern, of course, manifested in the form of William Friedkin’s final film, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (William Friedkin, 2023), being unceremoniously dumped onto Showtime on the same day that David Gordon Green’s legacy sequel to The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973) released in theatres.\n\nThe one notable exception to that pattern, of course, is Michael Mann’s often beguiling, funereal late-period opus Ferrari (Michael Mann, 2023) – by far the film released this year that I have the most admiration for, and one that has prompted a reflection upon how inextricable the filmmaker’s work has been to my own cinephilia. Thus far, Mann’s career has been defined by the irreconcilability of dueling identities, ideologies and modes of being- a dialectical cinema that furthers its thesis not through facile, dialogic intellectualization but through a poetics of movement whose syntax is that of sensorial immersion, like the heft of a revolver or the relentless thrust of a go-fast boat. In the culmination of a project nearly 30 years in the making, that irreconcilability is one between metaphysics and the physics of the automobile, which are constantly engaged in a battle for supremacy. Two objects cannot exist at the same point in space at the same moment in time.\n\nSimon Killen\n\nManaging Director, Hi Gloss Entertainment\n\nThe lack of consensus in the ‘great films of 2023’ lists is a very good sign, at least from a creative perspective, if not for the business. From a cinema industry perspective, phenomena like ‘Barbenheimer’ prove how critical tentpole cinema events can be for the cinema business, which in turn is crucial for keeping the industry alive. But there is no shortage of inspiring content.\n\nI saw so many good films this year, so I have created two lists! Apologies if this cricket reference does not quite work for you. If only every year could be this good. Asterisked titles will be released locally in 2024; and two of the titles – released through my company Hi Gloss Entertainment – are marked with ‘+’.\n\nMy all-rounder of the year award goes to: Scrapper (Molly Manning Walker, 2023) and How to Have Sex (Molly Manning Walker, 2023).\n\nThe most happiness experienced in a cinema this year: A draw between Robot Dreams (Pablo Berger, 2023) at Cannes with tears of joy streaming from my eyes, and back home at a Glenroy Hall watching Il Mafiosi (Mafioso, Alberto Lattuada, 1962) with an audience comprised almost totally of Italians hooting and hollering.

Kramer\n\nContributor to Senses of Cinema, Salon, Cineaste, and other publications. Co-editor of two volumes of Directory of World Cinema: Argentina.\n\nThe most memorable films I saw in 2023 soothed, provoked, and/or disturbed me. Each of these features made me feel something. That is why they—plus an honorable mention—are my top five films for 2023.\n\n1. Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus (Neo Sora, 2023)\n\nThis melancholic concert film, shot in black and white, features the last recorded performance by the late composer/musician. It is an elegy full of poignant, haunting, solo piano compositions. Sakamoto plays with such feeling, and the camera moves in on him or frames his hands as they produce notes on the keyboard in ways that are moving. Even when Sakamoto’s face is shown, he exhibits such concentration, such intensity, that one feels his music as deeply as he does. Watching Sakamoto bow his head, as if he is listening closely to every note, is beautiful. He raises his hands as silence lingers as if he is conducting himself. He is often seen in silhouette, reflected on the glossy piano, or seen as a shadow on the floor. Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus ends with the title track being performed without its composer at the keyboard. It magnifies the heartbreaking loss of this magnificent artist.\n\n2. El Conde (Pablo Larraín, 2023)\n\nPablo Larraín’s allegory was both hilarious and horrifying. Filmed in luminous black-and-white, this gorgeous and gory political satire reimagined Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) as a 250-year-old vampire (An apt metaphor). Narrated by Margaret Thatcher (Stella Gonet), this film is as bonkers as it is brilliant. Larraín and his co writer Guillermo Calderón stun viewers with graphic violence (Pinochet drinks smoothies made from human hearts) and magical realist touches – such as a nun named Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger) – soaring in ecstasy. Other comic scenes include when the accountant Carmencita is asked to investigate the family and interviews Pinochet’s five children about their own corruption; as well as Pinochet faking his own death and tapping on the lid of his coffin when he is ready to escape. El Conde is a serious indictment of Pinochet’s fascism, and why it gets under one’s skin.\n\n3. Les Indociles (Jean-Marc Barr and Pascal Arnold, 2023) Sleek, seductive, and subversive, Jean-Marc Barr and Pascal Arnold’s intimate film is set during the early months of the pandemic and invites viewers to hang out in a boutique hotel. Described as “a place of privilege where you can forget everything,” the hotel is operating illegally as a brothel. Viewers observe scenes of the staff, the sex workers, and their clients interacting. The episodes unfold casually, as if viewers are eavesdropping on the nearly twenty characters as they form connections—sometimes temporarily—or break apart. There are only a few discrete episodes of sex, but the characters are more emotionally naked, revealing themselves sometimes in a single line of dialogue. An example of this is when an essential worker named Clara (Lizzie Brocheré) declares, “I feel like we are losing our humanity.” Likewise, a scene of Felix (Pierre Perrier) the hotel manager, having a cry in the supply closet is emotional. What is unspoken is often as important as what is said as discussions about the power dynamics of race, class, and the #MeToo movement Illustrate.\n\n4. À plein temps (Full Time, Eric Gravel, 2021)\n\nThis gripping thriller, by writer/director Eric Gravel, has Julie (Laure Calamy), a single mother striving for a better life—but can’t seem to get a break. Calamy’s superb performance makes viewers root for her as she despairs; her every emotion is palpable. Full Time is, at times, manipulative, but that is forgivable, and part of what makes this roller-coaster of emotion so gratifying.\n\n5. Un silence (A Silence, Joachim Lafosse, 2023)\n\nDirected by Joachim Lafosse, A Silence is a highly provocative film about the sins of the father. It is best not to reveal the family secrets—e.g., the silence of the title—at the heart of this very intelligent and sensitively made film, but the acting, by Daniel Auteuil as the father, and Emmanuelle Devos, as his wife, is excellent. Their performances capture the weight of guilt, shame, and repression with haunting expressions and coiled body-language. Lafosse tackles a difficult, uncomfortable subject and family trauma in a quietly powerful film.\n\nHonorable Mention: L’Été dernier (Last Summer, Catherine Breillat, 2023)\n\nCatherine Breillat’s first film in a decade is a terrific remake of the 2019 Danish film Queen of Hearts. Last Summer is a knotty drama all about trust and power, who has it, and how they give or withhold it. As lies snowball and characters might self-destruct, Drucker’s stunning performance is gripping and Breillat never flinches in telling her story.\n\nJan Křipač\n\nEditor in Chief, Film A Doba Magazine, Czech Republic.\n\nBên trong vo kén vàng (Inside the Yellow Cocoon, Pham Thien An, 2023)\n\nKuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nLos delincuentes (The Delinquents, Rodrigo Moreno, 2023)\n\nmul-an-e-seo (In Water, Hong Sang-soo, 2023)\n\nHere (Bas Devos, 2023)\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Laura Citarella, 2022)\n\nAnatomie d’une chute (Anatomy of a Fall, Justine Triet, 2023)\n\nLe mur des morts (The Wall of the Dead, Eugène Green, 2022)\n\nNic víc (Nothing More, Vít Pancíř, 2022)\n\nKuru Otlar Üstüne (About Dry Grasses, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, 2023)\n\nJay Kuehner\n\nFreelance film critic (Cinema Scope, MUBI, Film Comment) and independent curator (On Site, Veracity, Rayos) based in the Pacific Northwest U.S.\n\nDe Humani Corporis Fabrica (Véréna Paravel, Lucien Castaing-Taylor, 2022)\n\nYouth (Spring) (Wang Bing, 2023)\n\nRetratos Fantasmas (Pictures of Ghosts, Kleber Mendonça Filho, 2023)\n\nMambar Pierrette (Rosine Mbakam, 2023)\n\nNotre Corps (Our Body, Claire Simon, 2023)\n\nThe Human Surge 3 (Eduardo Williams, 2023)\n\nAllensworth (James Benning, 2023)\n\nLa Chimera (Alice Rohrwacher, 2023)\n\nEureka (Lisandro Alonso, 2023)\n\nKuolleet lehdet (Fallen Leaves, Aki Kaurismäki, 2023)\n\nA Common Sequence (Mary Helena Clark, Mike Gibisser, 2023)\n\nTótem (Lila Avilés, 2023)\n\nNu aștepta prea mult de la sfârșitul lumii (Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World, Radu Jude, 2023)\n\nLos delincuentes (The Delinquents, Rodrigo Moreno, 2023)\n\nAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt (Raven Jackson, 2023)\n\nHere (Bas Devos, 2023)\n\nIn Water (Mul-an-e-seo, Hong Sangsoo, 2023)\n\nTrenque Lauquen (Laura Citarella, 2023)\n\nAntier Noche (Nights Gone By, Alberto Martin Menach, 2023)\n\nMay December (Todd Haynes, 2023)\n\nShowing Up (Kelly Reichardt, 2023)\n\nZinzindurrunkarratz (Oskar Alegria, 2023)\n\nAku wa Sonzai Shinai (Evil Does Not Exist, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, Japan, 2023)\n\nRoter Himmel (Afire, Christian Petzold, 2023)\n\nNuit obscure – Au revoir ici, n’importe où (Obscure Night: Goodbye Here, Anywhere, Sylvain George, 2023)\n\nSamsara (Lois Patiño, 2023)\n\nIf You Don’t Watch the Way You Move (Kevin Jerome Everson, 2023)\n\nMark Lager\n\nFilm Writer (Cineaste, Senses of Cinema, Rue Morgue, Film International, CineAction, Cinema Retro)\n\nFestival Lumière in Lyon, France (October 2023) awarded Wim Wenders and shared both a retrospective of his films as well as a master class with Wenders. The director discussed his film Paris, Texas (winner of the Palme d’Or and in my top 10 in the Sight & Sound greatest films of all time poll!). Actress Irène Jacob (president of the Institut Lumière) presented Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, among other highlighted selections. What I consider the greatest American western (alongside Peter Fonda’s The Hired Hand) was also shown at the festival, Robert Altman’s McCabe & Mrs. Miller, featuring the songs of Leonard Cohen. What distinguishes Festival Lumière from other film festivals and makes it so unique is that it is not a competitive festival and is not focused on glamor and glitz. Younger and older cinephiles casually shared spaces with acclaimed actors and directors, it was one audience with a love for cinema history.\n\nFavorite Film of 2023: The Holdovers (Alexander Payne, 2023)\n\nBoth heartfelt and hilarious, The Holdovers is, by far, the best film of Alexander Payne’s career. Paul Giamatti gives his greatest performance as a misanthropic teacher alone at a boarding school with Dominic Sessa as a struggling student and Da’Vine Joy Randolph as a bereaved cook and mother mourning the death of her son in the Vietnam War. Set during December 17, 1970 to New Year’s 1971, with particularly poignant turning points on Christmas and December 27.\n\nEugenia Lai\n\nCinephile.

Currently writing a PhD in Hispanic American Culture at the University of Connecticut.\n\nThe cinematic landscape of 2023 has been graced with a remarkable range of narratives, stylistic ventures, and directorial visions. The films are arranged hierarchically.\n\n1-Anatomie d’une chute (Anatomy of the Fall, Justine Triet, 2023)\n\nTriet critically explores the fractures of contemporary being, delivering a film that is both introspective and revealing. In her dissection of a marriage, the filmmaker shatters the divide between reality and plausibility, delving into a downfall that is simultaneously literal and allegorical.\n\n2-Roter Himmel (Afire, Christian Petzold, 2023)\n\nPetzold delivers yet another captivating narrative, melding particular attention to detail with emotional depth that captures the complexity of human experience. The meticulous portrayal of the characters—their fears, desires, and inner turmoil—is intricately woven into the settings: the forest, the beach, the summer home. Amidst it all stands the fire, an all-consuming force.\n\n3-Poor Things (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2023)\n\nLanthimos continues to challenge narrative conventions, delivering a film that blends dark humor with sharp social critique, all wrapped in his signature cinematic style. In this distinctive adaptation of Frankenstein, the filmmaker weaves a coming-of-age narrative that reaches its zenith on a journey of growth far from home, all the while painting a rich tableau of female subjectivity through a Foucauldian lens.\n\n3-Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023)\n\nMaster filmmaker Scorsese immerses us in a dark chapter of American history, showcasing his skill in telling powerful stories that are both intimate and grand. In this iteration, the director reimagines the Western—a genre quintessentially tied to American nationalism—to critically reexamine the romanticized narratives of white settlers’ expansion and the exploitation of indigenous lands.\n\n5-Passages (Ira Sachs, 2023)\n\nPassages intricately explores the labyrinth of human desire and the complexities of romantic entanglements. At its heart is the story of a filmmaker whose passionate liaison with a schoolteacher catalyzes the dissolution of his marriage with other men. The film charts a course through an emotional battleground, laden with turmoil and doubt, a testament to the director’s signature approach to capturing the nuances of emotional realism.\n\n6-May December (Todd Haynes, 2023)\n\nKnown for his emotional delicacy and depth, Haynes brings us a story that challenges our perceptions of love, age, and memory. May December not only reconstructs a factual narrative but also disassembles it by employing a mirror—or perhaps more aptly, a mirage. Symbolically, cinema itself serves as this reflective medium, yet within the narrative, the mirroring is more tangibly portrayed through the transformative art of performance.\n\n7-Suzume (Makoto Shinkai, 2022)\n\nShinkai deviates from the romantic and sometimes clichéd tone of films like Your Name to explore a more complex plot that weaves together humans, animals, supernatural beings, and even a ‘chair.’ In doing so, he engages with a Japanese narrative tradition where historical reexamination intertwines with critical discussions on environmental issues, all narrated through the enduring and ever-effective structure of the “hero’s journey.”\n\n8-Showing Up (Kelly Reichardt, 2023)\n\nReichardt continues to shine with her distinctive style, offering a piece that is as much a meticulous character study as it is a contemplation of artistic life. However, here the director avoids those clichés that define an artist, such as eccentricity, madness, or misunderstanding. The lack of personality in the protagonist is precisely what gives Reichardt’s film its distinction.\n\n9-Asteroid City (Wes Anderson, 2023)\n\nAnderson once again invites us into his unique world, filled with symmetry and color, with a film that is both a visual adventure and a witty fable. Asteroid City is arguably the most ambitious, abstract, and mannered of Anderson’s filmography. While these characteristics are strengths, they also become a straitjacket that confines the film within an overpowering authorship.\n\n10-Los delincuentes (The Delinquents, Rodrigo Moreno, 2023)\n\nThe young Argentinian filmmaker offers an unflinching look at life on the fringes of society, forging a piece of cinema that is as provocative as it is emotionally resonant. The film cleverly subverts the viewer’s expectations, dismantling the generic conventions it initially establishes. A robbery, a self-incrimination, a conviction, and an unwitting accomplice serve as the backdrop for a scathing critique of contemporary capitalism.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n–Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan, 2023)\n\n–Barbie (Greta Gerwig, 2023)\n\n–Rotter in the Sun (Sebastián Silva, 2023)\n\n–Llamadas desde Moscú (Calls from Moscow, Luis Alejandro Yero, 2023)\n\n–Master Gardener (Paul Schrader, 2022)\n\n–Tótem (Totem, Lila Avilés, 2023)\n\nMarc Lauria\n\nCinephile.

This unique ode to art is a forgotten masterpiece of Finnish cinema and it was recommended to me by the great programmer/critic Boris Nelepo who also organized an important (first-ever complete) Lehmuskallio & Lapsui retrospective at Doclisboa.\n\nA special shoutout to an essential streaming service Dafilms.com which introduced me to great, obscure documentary cinema throughout the year – three films on this list I saw there: 80cm 5t about sculptor Karl Prentl as part of Michael Pilz retrospective, From Unfinished Tales of Jerusalem, a mysterious Lithuanian short film trapped between times, and The Specialist, overwhelming portrait of banality of evil, comprised of the footage from the Adolf Eichmann trial in Jerusalem.\n\nTara Lomax\n\nDiscipline Lead of Screen Studies, Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS)\n\nThis contribution continues my World Poll theme, whereby I survey the year’s franchise installments to review how the mode of production develops over time (for better or worse). Overall, 2023 wasn’t a strong year for Hollywood franchising: after some years of faltering under the weight of industrial shifts, global crises and general creative misdirection, this year has highlighted a need to course correct if the mode is to maintain strength and hold its audience.\n\nBelow is an alphabetical list of noteworthy franchise installments released in 2023.\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig, 2023)\n\nOne half of the ‘Barbenhiemer’ cultural phenomenon – together with Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan, 2023) – the blockbuster success of Barbie seemed to signal to some critics an audience appetite for less franchise tent poles and more ‘standalone’ blockbusters. This is a strange message since the ‘Barbie’ has existed for over six decades. Barbie is the first live-action feature film installment in this long-running franchise and its success reflects a demand for self-deprecating IP that is prepared to satirize its own moral contradictions.\n\n‘DC Extended Universe’ (DCEU): Shazam! Fury of the Gods (David F. Sandberg, 2023); The Flash (Andy Muschietti, 2023); Blue Beetle (Angel Manuel Solo, 2023); Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (James Wan, 2023)\n\nThis is the year that four ineffectual ‘DCEU’ installments were released after the announcement that the franchise would be rebooted under the new leadership and creative direction of James Gunn and Peter Safran. The ‘DCEU’ installments released this year reflect the ‘mess’ typical of this franchise, but now without any intrigue of where it might all be heading. Before release, Gunn suggested these films were to set up his new vision; since they all flopped, it is simply goodbye and RIP (Rest in IP) to the ‘DCEU’.\n\nFast X (Louis Leterrier, 2023)\n\nDon’t be deceived by the ‘X’ in the title because this is actually the eleventh feature installment in the ‘Fast & the Furious’ franchise – and ‘part one,’ no less! Increasingly getting sillier (although there is no space travel in this one), this franchise might be losing touch with why this franchise has engaged an audience for so long. As part one of two, it ends abruptly; some might say that franchising lacks conclusions, but that’s simply untrue. However, if you brand an installment as part one then you don’t need to bother writing an ending – just pay Gal Gadot to smile.\n\nThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (Francis Lawrence, 2023)\n\nThis is a prequel set over six decades before The Hunger Games (Gary Ross, 2012) and focuses on Coriolanus Snow, before he becomes an antagonist. While this is intended to reveal something deep and complex about Snow, its most notable contribution is what it reveals about the nature and development of the Hunger Games as an event. The biggest shortfall of this installment was its running time and narrative structure.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (James Mangold, 2023)\n\nThis is the fifth installment in the ‘Indiana Jones’ franchise and it was great to see this in a full State Theatre at the closing night of the Sydney Film Festival. Its thematic focus on time, history and legacy was fitting for an installment centered on an aging Indy (and Harrison Ford) and, despite a great opening sequence with a convincingly de-aged Ford, this addition to the ‘Indiana Jones’ franchise felt a bit out of time. This is overall a fine addition to this franchise but unfortunately not worth its production budget.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (Chad Stahelski, 2023)\n\nThis installment continues to exemplify the art of fight choreography but after almost three hours my appreciation for this ballet-like fighting style wears thin – there are only so many times Keanu Reeves can gracefully fall down the Sacré-Cœur stairs before a full cinema audience vocally grumbles in frustration. So far this is the weakest installment in this franchise in terms of world-building and story, despite being critically well-received.\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (Peyton Reed, 2023); Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (James Gunn, 2023); The Marvels (Nia DaCosta, 2023)\n\nThis was the year the ‘MCU’ fell from the heavens. What was the exemplar of the franchise mode, I have long sung the praises of the ‘MCU’s’ complex storytelling and production model that has been misunderstood by cinephiles and screen critics. However, its increasing obsession with illogical multiversal world-building and a disconnection from its source material and audience has had an impact on the quality of its output.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (Christopher McQuarrie, 2023)\n\nThe seventh installment in the ‘Tom Cruise’ franchise (i.e., ‘Mission: Impossible’), this tries to give the impression of a storyworld bigger than what has been seen before, with an antagonist that that has history with Tom – sorry, Ethan; instead, it just leaves you thinking you’ve missed something. The focus on AI might be a metaphor that reflects Cruise’s anxieties that streaming will ruin cinema, and while this is another ‘part one’ this year it at least provides a conclusion to its thematic premise.\n\nScream VI (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, 2023)\n\nThe sixth film installment in the ‘Scream’ franchise opens with the fatal slashing of an Australian-sounding film studies academic who specializes in the horror genre – this was the first time I considered myself to be in a high-risk profession.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, 2023)\n\nThe long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), this installment continues the impressive and diverse art style of its animation and does multiversal storytelling slightly better than the ‘MCU’. However, this misdirected ‘part one’ chooses the wrong narrative beat to ‘end’: just because the storyworld extends beyond the scope of one installment doesn’t preclude the need for a conclusion.\n\nOther noteworthy franchise releases this year:\n\nCreed III (Michael B. Jordan, 2023)Saw X (Kevin Greutert, 2023)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears, 2023)\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (Steven Caple Jr., 2023)\n\nAndrew Lynch\n\nAndrew Lynch is a lecturer of Cinema and Screen Studies at Swinburne University of Technology, Australia.\n\nTop 5 films released in Australia in 2023\n\n1. Talk to Me (Danny Phillipou, Michael Phillipou, 2022)\n\nThe most vibrant, slick, lean and nasty, horror movie in years! YouTubers-turned directors Danny and Michael Phillipou (aka RackaRacka) bring their love of wild stunts and a distinctly youthful and Aussie energy to the possession genre. Their film has heart and depth but never forgets to feel dangerous, something few horror movies truly manage.\n\n2. Barbie (Greta Gerwig, 2023)\n\nMore than enough has already been said about Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie’s incredible and near-impossible filmic achievement: combining Mattel’s branding and cynical commercialism with indie-film messiness and personality into a culture- conquering hit that made people want to see it multiple times at theatres!\n\n3. Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese, 2023)\n\nThe old guy’s still got it! I really didn’t feel the over-3-hour runtime of Scorsese’s adaptation of David Grann’s non-fiction account of the Osage Murders and the formation of the FBI. The film keeps focus on Deniro and DiCaprio and sometimes relegates absolute star Lily Gladstone to the story’s margins, but this is still a worthy addition to Scorsese’s powerful series of films that interrogate American history and mythology.\n\n4. Biosphere (Mel Eslyn, 2022)\n\nMumblecore icon and indie-film impresario Mark Duplass is paired with acting powerhouse Sterling K Brown, as the last two men alive on earth, in a genuinely weird, surprising sci-fi interrogation of the buddy comedy. This goofily sincere film has a lot on its mind…if not a lot of satisfying answers, but is definitely worth a watch, just avoid spoilers."
