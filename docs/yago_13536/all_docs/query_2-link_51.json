        "text": "“The Ferret,” renegade indie helmer Jean-Pierre Mocky’s 43rd film in as many years, puts its distinguished cast through their rough-hewn paces with devil-may-care, endearingly clunky elan. Absolutely perfunctory production gives vet thesps — particularly Michel Serrault — the leeway to carry on like economy-sized hams. Result is a film that may not break B.O. records, but which is somehow reassuring as proof that — at least in France — a guy with a movie camera and a script can still round up his pals and make a slyly anarchic picture that seeks to entertain.\n\nThis jaunty tale of a sheleppy-looking but enterprising locksmith who admires gangster films and will do anything to get his hands on the sexy broads, flashy cars and the easy cash he thinks fearless hit men command, plays against expectations while embracing the trappings of the outlaw code.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe Ferret (Jacques Villeret, the dorky accountant in “The Dinner Game”), a low-income family man, has killed four small-time crooks at close range, escaping through manhole covers, sewers and Metro tunnels whose occasional locks he picks with ease. He works for lowlife racketeer Don Enzio (a flamboyant Serrault in spats and a red fez), and hopes his lethal services will impress crime kingpin Don Salvadore (Michael Lonsdale), leading to babes and bucks. Alas, the former doesn’t actually know the latter.\n\nPolice inspector Bart (Robin Renucci) and luscious morgue physician Dr. Karadin (Patricia Barzyk) form a carnal bond as they track the sneaky title killer.\n\nBouncy score from vet Vladimir Cosma ups the incongruity and the class of a bargain basement comic thriller without a pretentious frame in sight. You’ve got to admire a film in which an imposing drug dealer is felled by a shot aimed from the cold cuts inside a giant sandwich — which the killer eats with pragmatic gusto after the hit."
