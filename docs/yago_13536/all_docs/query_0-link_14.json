        "text": "The French actor and director Jean-Pierre Mocky (Jean-Paul Mokiejewski), who made more than sixty films in his career, died this Thursday at the age of 86, his family announced to the French media.\n\nMocky, born in Nice, in the south of France, in a family of Jewish origin, began in dramatic art after having studied Law and one of his most emblematic films is “À mort l'arbitre” (“A for the referee », 1984), with Michel Serrault as the protagonist.\n\nDuring World War II, his father moved his birth date forward to 1929 so he could take a boat to Algeria alone to escape the Nazis.\n\nHe debuted as an actor in 1942 and worked as a regular performer until 2017, also appearing in front of the camera in some of his own films.\n\nHis first feature film as a director, \"Les dragueurs\", starred Jacques Charrier and Charles Aznavour and was released in 1959.\n\n\"Un drôle de paroissien\" (1963) and \"Le miraculé\" (\"The Miracle\", 1987) earned him nominations at the Berlin Film Festival, and \"Litan\" (1982) won the award for best screenplay in 1982 at that of Sitges (Spain).\n\nMocky, a regular on television sets, where he was a guest as a commentator, bought his own movie theater in Paris in 1994 to show his own films, Le Brady, which he sold in 2011, and throughout his career he also made projects for television.
