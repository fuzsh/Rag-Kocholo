Jean Yonnel as D'Artagnan in Vingt ans après (Henri Diamant-Berger 1922). \n\t\n\t<b>Jean Yonnel</b> (1891-1968) was a French stage and screen actor of Rumanian origin.\n\t \n\tJean Yonnel (Estève Schachmann) was a French actor born 21 July 1891 in Bucarest. He was one of the last tragedy players of the grand tradition of the actors from the turn-of-the-century (he acted with Mounet-Sully and Sarah Bernhardt). After his stage debuts at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, the Gymnase and the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt - where he created La Gloire by Maurice Rostand - he was engaged at the   Comédie-Française in 1926, where he was sociétaire for over 25 years, from 1 January 1929 to 31 December 1955. For years he played the tragic and romantic jeune premier and was the favourite performer of Henry de Montherlant who created him the part of king Ferrante in La Reine morte,  a part he played 330 times. Some of the classic roles in the repertory of the Comédie he also played  dozens of times, such as Oreste in Racine’s Andromache, Mithridate in Racine’s Mithridate, Don Saluste de Bazan in Ruy Blas by Victor Hugo, and in particular Don Diego in El Cid (212 times between 1949 and 1963). After being nominated teacher at the Conservatoire national supérieur d'art dramatique, he taught the classic tradition there from from 1947 to 1962. According to Noëlle Guibert and Jacqueline Razgonnikoff in the Dictionnaire des comédiens français, he was « a demanding, rigorous and terribly honest actor» (Comédie-Française, no 129-130, May-June 1984). \n\t\n\tBetween 1913 and 1966 Jean Yonnel also acted in French cinema. Probably his first part was in Henri Fescourt’s Gaumont production Le crime enseveli (1913), where had the lead. In 1915 he acted in Abel Gance’s Film d’Art production Strass et compagnie, with Harry Baur en Emile Keppens. In 1917 Yonnel had again a lead in Les lois du monde by Fanny Liona, an again in La flamme cachée (1918), co-directed by Roger Lion and Musidora. Yonnel became well-known as film actor in 1922, when playing D’Artagnan in Vingt ans après by Henri Diamant-Berger, the sword and dagger sequel in 10 episodes to Diamant-Berger’s Les trois mousquetaires (1921) and based on Alexandre Dumas’ homonymous novel on the romances of D’Artagnan, the fourth musketeer. While most actors of the cast from Les trois mousquetaires were kept in the sequel –Henri Rollan as Athos, Charles Martinelli as Porthos and Pierre de Guingand as Aramis, Armand Bernard as their aid Planchet - Yonnel substituted the original D’Artagnan, played by Aimé Simon-Girard.  Despite the large budget, the fine sets by Mallet-Stevens and costumes by Paul Poiret, the film didn’t mean an intense career in silent cinema for Yonnel. His only  silent film afterwards was a major part in Robert Saidreau’s Alphonse Daudet adaptation Jack (1925), in which young Jean Forest played the title role.\n\t\n\tYonnel instead was much more active in French sound cinema with 9 films in the 1930s. He acted opposite Pola Negri in the period piece Fanatisme (Tony Lekain, Gaston Ravel  1934), opposite Marcelle Chantal in the abortion melodrama Amok (Fyodor Otsep 1934, based on Sefan Zweig’s story Letter from an unknown woman), opposite Pierre Fresnay and Elisa Landi in Königsmark (Maurice Tourneur 1935). He had the lead in the colonial drama L’appel du silence (Léon Poirier 1936), co-starring Pierre de Guingand and Suzanne Bianchetti, as well in Les nuits blanches de Saint-Petersbourg Jean Dréville 1938), with Gaby Morlay starring, and in Les 3 tambours (Maurice de Canonge 1939), co-starring Jacques Brécourt. During the war Yonnel did not act in film, but in the immediate years after he played in several films until the mid-1950s, though always in minor parts, as in the Franco-German co-production Marianne  de ma jeunesse (Julien Duvivier 1955), shot in Bavaria and starring Marianne Hold. One of his last roles Yonnel played was as the father of Bourvil in Un drôle de paroissien (Jean-Pierre Mocky 1963). Jean Yonnel died at age 77 in Paris on 17 August 1968.\n\t\n\tSources: IMDB, French Wikipedia.",
