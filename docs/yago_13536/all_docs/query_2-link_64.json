He received his first real on-screen opportunity only with the coming of the French New Wave, when he began playing defiant and discontented young men who instinctively rebelled against their environment and society's status quo. Such was his role in Chabrol's A double tour (in which he substituted for an ailing Jean-Claude Brialy), but this film did not receive a great deal of attention. However, it was his role in Godard's A bout de souffle, made in the same year—1959, a watershed for the French New Wave—which won him unexpected success from the public and the critics and made him famous all over the world. The hero of the film, Michel Poiccard, is a car thief, living from hand to mouth, who finally becomes a murderer and pays with his life for his recklessness and irresponsibility. The success of A bout de souffle even resulted in a wave of \"Belmondism\" in the hipper circles of Paris, manifesting itself in a particular style of behavior, clothing, and expression.\n\nPreviously, Godard had directed Belmondo in an interesting short-length study, Charlotte et son Jules, and they worked together again in Une Femme est une femme and, more importantly, Pierrot le fou. To express his anarchistic conception of modern life, Godard, rejecting everything conventional and static, had found in Belmondo the ideal screen hero. In several other films, the actor replayed this type of rough, isolated (and ultimately ill-fated) character. He had similarly motivated roles in Becker's Un Nommé La Rocca, while in Verneuil's Un Singe en hiver, where Belmondo partnered with Jean Gabin, the dramatic situations were alternated with comic elements. He gathered further experience in Italy where he made films under the direction of Lattuada (Lettere di una novizia), de Sica (La ciociara), and Bolognini (La viaccia). Almost as consequential to his work with Godard were the films he made with Jean-Pierre Melville, including Léon Morin, prêtre, Le Doulos, and L'Aîné des Ferchaux.\n\nBut thereafter, Belmondo began breaking off his connection to the authors of the New Wave. After the Louis Malle black comedy Le Voleur, and especially after the ambitious but unsuccessful attempt by Alain Resnais to revive in film the character of a famous speculator and crook from the 1930s—Stavisky—Belmondo began appearing almost exclusively in commercially oriented features. His films offered few artistic demands, but nevertheless were widely popular and filled the cinemas. Among these early commercial pictures were de Broca's L'Homme de Rio and Les Tribulations d'un chinois en Chine, films in which Belmondo proved not only his dramatic talent but also his physical dexterity. He followed up these successful works with roles as a dauntless secret agent in Le Magnifique and a brilliant crook in L'Incorrigible, also directed by de Broca.\n\nBelmondo appeared in a series of eight films made with Verneuil, most of which were written with him in mind. The director's ambition was, above all, to entertain audiences, offering up a combination of spectacle and charismatic star performances. A typical Verneuil-Belmondo feature is the adventure story of truck drivers in the Sahara, Cent mille dollars au soleil, in which he plays the role of Rocco, a criminal who attempts to double-cross his colleagues. This picture won the Cannes Prize of Golden Ticket ex aequo, awarded for the first time by the Union of the French Cinema Owners. The film Weekend à Zuydcoote followed, adapted from the novel of Robert Merle, in which the tragic events near Dunkirk from the beginning of World War II are mirrored via the fate of several French soldiers. Belmondo played one of them, a fighter who is at once easygoing and resolute. He co-starred with Omar Sharif in the next film by Verneuil, Le Casse, as a member of a gang of jewel thieves. As a commissar-in-chief of the Paris police in Peur sur la ville, he again had the opportunity to give an athletic and acrobatic performance. Another noteworthy Belmondo-Verneuil collaboration is Les Morfalous, an adventure story of death and greed during the war in Tunisia.\n\nBelmondo has also worked with other directors in recent years. In Lautner's Flic ou voyou, he appeared in the role of a nonconformist policeman who sets out to rid Nice of gangsterism and corruption. In this case, however, the dialogue and humor were more prominent than the action. He played a charming, aging adventurer in subsequent films by Lautner, Le Guignolo and Le Professionnel, and another police commissar in Deray's Le Marginal. After decades of appearing in such genre fare, Belmondo had his most challenging, highest-profile role since the 1960s in Lelouch's Les Misérables, a provocative drama inspired by the Victor Hugo classic. He played Henri Fortin, an uneducated ex-pugilist who befriends an intellectual Jewish family escaping the Nazis during World War II. Through them, he learns the story of Jean Valjean, with the film eventually becoming a meditation on the essence of Hugo's story. One only can ponder the course of Belmondo's career had he, earlier on, chosen to accept roles in films as ambitious as Les Misérables.\n\n—Karel Tabery, updated by Rob Edelman"
