        "meta_description": "Cinema's engagement with 1968 was perhaps most in evidence in the auteur sector of the French industry, although of the established stars of the Nouvelle Vague and its satellites only Godard really registered a change in his trajectory. Jean-Pierre Mocky's anarchic political thriller, Solo represents an extended day-dream regarding May 1968, and as the title suggests it is a distinctly uncollective daydream. Despite his claims, Mocky's image of May is in many ways a caricature. In Cocktail Molotov the events of May are little more than a backdrop for the escapades of the young protagonists, whose conquest of independence and maturity is explicitly divorced from their influence, since they are continually in another place. Romain Goupil set out to make a film-biography both of the May events and of the lyc√©en leader Michel Recanati, a personal friend.",
