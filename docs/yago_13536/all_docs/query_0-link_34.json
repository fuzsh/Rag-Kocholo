        "text": "The Lachaunay family, high-born aristocrats, have fallen on hard times and must resort to stripping off the doors and panelling of their Paris appartment to use as firewood. They are also threatened with eviction, but never waver from their conviction that they were born not to work. One of them, the ultra-religious Georges resorts to stealing money from offertory boxes. This is a wonderfully provocative and anti-clerical comedy, served by a subtle and humourous performance by Bourvil.\n\nCredits: Producers, Henri Diamant-Berger, Jerome Goulven ; director, Jean-Pierre Mocky ; writer, Alain Moury, Michel Servin ; photography, Leonce-Henri Burel ; music, Joseph Kosma ; art direction, Pierre Thyberhein.\n\nCast: Bourvil, Jean Poiret, Francis Blanche, Jean Yonnel, Jean Tissier, Solange Certain, Denise Peronne, Veronique Nordey, Jean Galland, Bernard Lavallette.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
