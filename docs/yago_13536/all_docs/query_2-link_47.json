        "text": "The imposing filmography of Jean-Luc Godard is dotted with many remarkable anomalies and one-offs, including television commercials and music videos. “The Rise and Fall of a Small Film Company,” a shot-on-video picture made in 1986 and having its official New York premiere in a new restoration, is one of the most diverting and substantial of these.\n\nCommissioned by, yes, a small film company to produce an installment of a French TV channel’s series of crime novel adaptations, Mr. Godard instead created something almost wholly other. This one was to be based on “The Soft Centre,” a book by James Hadley Chase (who wrote the lurid and scandalous “No Orchids for Miss Blandish” in 1939, as well as “Eva,” which was made into a notable film by Joseph Losey in 1962). Drawing on his own frustrations in a new era of film production, Mr. Godard concocted a narrative that, like his movies “Contempt” (1963) and “Passion” (1982), chronicles a film that doesn’t get made.\n\nJean-Pierre Léaud plays Gaspard Bazin, a frenetic, declaiming figure driven to distraction by, well, it’s hard to say what — although the implication is strong that he’s been broken by filmmaking itself. Mr. Léaud’s performance here is a marvel, both manic and meticulously controlled.\n\nMaking a film of “The Soft Centre,” he uses the small offices of his producer, Jean Almereyda (Jean-Pierre Mocky, an actor and director who was a contemporary of Mr. Godard’s), to conduct elaborately ritualized auditions, creating assembly lines of emoting. He approaches women in bistros and requests that they come to his place for private auditions and that they bring their bathing suits. When they tell him that sounds shady, he responds, “That’s not our style.” (Sure enough, when they do show up, Bazin is sufficiently scattered and passive that you think maybe he wasn’t lying.) He does take a genuine interest in working with Almereyda’s wife, Eurydice (Marie Valera). Almereyda is too caught up in financing concerns to take much notice."
