        "text": "Film celebrities, a culture minister and fans have paid homage to Jean-Pierre Mocky, a fiercely independent filmmaker who directed some of France’s most famed actors over a six-decade career.\n\nActor Gerard Depardieu encouraged fans to come and join Monday’s funeral ceremony at the Saint-Sulpice Church in Paris, although he did not go himself.\n\nMocky’s stars also included Catherine Deneuve, Charles Aznavour, Jeanne Moreau and others.\n\nBorn Jean-Paul Adam Mokiejewski, Mocky died last week after a career that included directing more than 60 films from 1954 to 2017 and acting in others.\n\nHis age was disputed.\n\nHe was associated with France’s New Wave cinema and he made a mark with his provocative style, though his movies did not achieve great commercial success.\n\nThey included 1963 comedy Un Drole De Paroissien (Heaven Sent) and 1983 drama A Mort L’Arbitre! (Kill The Referee!)"
