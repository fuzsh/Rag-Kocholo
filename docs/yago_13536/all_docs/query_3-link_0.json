Albany, NY: SUNY P, 1994.\n\nReview: D. B. Wilmeth in Choice 32 (1995), 798: \"This scholarly, comparative study of the close connections between politics, culture, art, and philosophy in 17th century Europe chooses as its focus productions of baroque spectacle performances (plays and operas) as presented at absolutist courts in Rome, Madrid, Paris, Versailles, and Vienna between 1631 and 1668. A.'s major contribution,\" in the reviewer's opinion, \"is her analyses of these spectacles as not mere frivolous entertainment . . . but as serious court activities with far ranging political and social consequence. After offering a theoretical base for her arguments that illustrates the intertwined nature of 'work' and 'play' in baroque feasts and festive performances, the author provides specific instances . . . . Copiously documented and effectively presented, the text nevertheless suffers,\" according to W., \"from the lack of appropriate illustration . . . .\"\n\nALLMANN, JOACHIM.

Trossbach in HZ 257 (1993), 191–192: This study of the forest in the early modern period is important to 17thc. French scholars because of its focus on the Palatinate.\n\nALPERS, SVETLANA. The Making of Rubens. New Haven: Yale UP, 1995.\n\nReview: A. Golahny in Choice 32 (1995), 1717–18: \"With dynamic prose and brilliant vision, A. argues . . . that the \"Kermis\" (Louvre) manifests R.'s concern for Flanders and sympathy for the peasants; that R.'s style seems feminine in opposition to the masculine style of Poussin (as but one example); and that Silenus embodies R.'s creativity.\" G. asserts that \"A.'s enthusiasm carries the reader through some wonderfully intricate and fascinating issues of the reception of R.'s art and personality . . . . The passages on the stylistic polarities of R./Poussin in later centuries . . . are refreshing if not novel,\" says G.\n\nANDERSON, MICHAEL. \"The Law of Writ and the Liberty.\" ThR 20 (1995), 189–99.\n\nIncludes references to commedia dell'arte and Hôtel de Bourgogne.\n\nANNAERT, PHILIPPE.

Préface deM. André Miquel. Genève: Droz, 1988.\n\nReview: K. Malettke in HZ 256 (1993), 405–407: Successful presentation of rich material gleaned from archives as well as published works. 17 th c. specialists will appreciate the careful examination of that period beginning with the provocative question \"si la Libraire du Roy est encore sa propriété personelle ou si elle est devenue une institution.\" Properly underscores Colbert's role in making the B.N. \" l'une des plus belles réunions de manuscrits, de livres, d'estampes et de médailles parmi les cours souveraines, la plus riche en qualité sinon en quantité.\"\n\nBARTRA, ROGER. Wild Men in the Looking Glass: The Mythic Origins of European Otherness. Trans.Carl T. Berrisford. Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1994.\n\nReview: R. B. Barnes in Choice 32 (1995), 1648: \"A broad synthetic essay based largely on secondary sources, this book explores the roots and development of the 'myth of the wild man' in Western culture. B. . . . argues that the idea of men who were not fully human was crucial to emerging Western notions of identity, and was a powerful element in European culture well before the age of conquest and colonization.\" \"The myth of 'otherness,' [B.] suggests, remains very near the heart of modern Western 'rational' self-understanding as a source of both horror and fascination.\" The reviewer describes this book as \"a dizzying tour, often suggestive and stimulating, but frustrating in its superficiality. The work is marred,\" contends R. B. B., \" by too much literary pseudosubtlety and an uneven translation.\"\n\nBATSCHMANN, OSKAR. Poussin, dialectiques de la peinture. Paris: Flammarion, 1994.\n\nReview: John E. Jackson in QL (16–31 mai 1995), 16–17: Reviewed with two other books. \"Au côté synthétique du catalogue de [Jacques] Thuillier s'oppose l'approche analytique d'O. B.,\" whose book \"met désormais à la portée du lecteur français l'un des regards les plus précis et les plus vifs portés sur le peintre. Qu'il s'agisse de l'opposition de l'ombre et de la couleur, de celle de la présence et de l'absence ou encore de la destruction et du salut, B. excelle á reconnaître dans la peinture de P. une tension créatrice qui . . . se voit enrichie ici par la mise au jour de tout un savoir historique, théorique et philosophique dont l'auteur montre admirablement comment il a collaboré à la composition et à l'autocompréhension de cette peinture.\"\n\nBAUSINGER, HERMANN, KLAUS BEYRER and GOTTFRIED KORFF, eds.

Paris : Flammarion, 1994.\n\nReview: Alain Duhamel in Le Point (3 décembre 1994), 65: \"Une biographie solide et passionnée,\" says D., who describes this work as \"un bon livre, une vraie biographie, à la fois gaie et perspicace, à l'image même de son modèle. Le style a de l'alacrité, du naturel. La documentation est irréprochable avec, travers classique d'universitaire, abus de citations . . . .\"\n\nBAZZOLI, M. Il piccolo stato nell'Età moderna. Studi su un concetto della politica internazionale tra XVIe e XVIIIe secolo. Milan: Edizioni Universitarie Jaca, 1990.\n\nReview: M. Galand in RBPH 72 (1994), 989–90: L'auteur \"propose une réflexion théorique aux résonances bien actuelles sur la notion de \"petit Etat durant l'époque moderne.\" L'ouvrage contient des articles récents de B. sur ce thème.\n\nBEAUSSANT, PHILIPPE. Lully ou le musicien du soleil. Paris: Gallimard, 1992.\n\nReview: Buford Norman in FR 67 (1993), 376–77: Well-written with a brilliant picutre of the reign to L.'s death in 1689. Special musical expertise not needed. Wealth of information and insights. Combination of author's literary and musical knowledge, as well as that of the ballet de cour, help to picture Molière's collaboration with L. in new light (e.g. George Dandin, Les Amants magnifigues). Reviewer corrects B.'s presentation on Quinault.\n\nBEAUTHIER, REGINE. La Répression de l'adultère en France du XVIeau XVIIIe siècle. De quelques lectures de l'histoire. Bruxelles: E.Story-Scientia, 1990.\n\nReview: X. Rousseaux in RBPH 72 (1994), 1020–22: \"A partir de la définition de l'adultère chez les auteurs, R.

Dictionnaire de la musique en France aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles. Paris: Fayard, 1992.\n\nReview: M. Vialet in PFSCL 22 (1995), 628–631: 2,500 entries representing \"un excellent guide du monde de la musique aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles à Paris.\" Reviewer finds the work stronger for the 17th than for the 18th century.

A Royal Passion: Louis XIV as Patron of Architecture. New York: Cambridge UP, 1994.\n\nReview: G. F. Hisel in Choice 32 (1995), 1286: \"B.'s book is representative of his excellent phenomenological approach to Louis XIV as seen in [two books published earlier] . . . . Lavishly illustrated, the book leans heavily on words from the time period to show the attainment of an international importance in French art and architecture equal to Italian work. Colbert reminds a young Louis that 'in lieu of dazzling actions in war, nothing indicates better the greatness and spirit of princes than buildings . . . .'\"\n\nBERGIN, JOSEPH. The Rise of Richelieu. New Haven/London: Yale UP, 1991.\n\nReview: K. Malettke in HZ 256 (1993), 187–189: Reviewer predicts that this newest work of well known Richelieu scholar will become the standard work on R. Quoting from B., he agrees that it is methodologically \"contextual and historical rather than simply biographical.\" Book begins with portrait of R.'s father who \"gradually introduced the . . . family to the higher level of court politics and finance.\" Following chapters treat R.'s childhood and youth, political concepts and ministry. B. correctly appreciates R.'s mastery of the arts of political survival and concludes that \"the R. who returned to ministerial office in 1624 was neither a saviour-figure and statesman who was the exception to every rule, nor a genius who could blithely defy the ordinary laws of political gravity.\"\n\nBLACK, JEREMY. A Military Revolution? Military Change and European Society 1550–1800. Basingstoke/London: Macmillan, 1991.\n\nReview: H. Duchhardt in HZ 256 (1993), 773: Unquestionably an important corrective for European perspectives of the military, society and political institutions.\n\nBLACK, JEREMY. European Warfare, 1660–1815. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1994.\n\nReview: J. R. Breihan in Choice 32 (1995), 988: \"B. . . . here rejoins the long debate over the dates and causes of the European 'military revolution.'\" In an earlier study, published in 1991, B. \"argued . . . that early modern historians writing on this subject had largely ignored the significance of military changes that occurred about 1660. Now he fleshes out this thesis with details about the military innovations of the ancien régime, particularly in the French army, the British navy and the Russian army. B. opposes 'technological determinism,' stressing throughout social and political forces that drove the development of new weapons rather than the other way around.\" According to the reviewer, \"B.'s revisionist arguments are . . stimulating,\" informed by \"a huge range of evidence,\" and B.'s footnotes are described as \"a rich mine of sources.\"\n\nBONNEFOY, YVES. Rome 1630: L'Horizon du premier baroque, suivi de Un des siècles du culte des images. Paris: Flammarion, 1994.\n\nReview: John E. Jackson in QL (16–31 mai 1995), 16–17: Reviewed with two other books. Reedition of book published in 1970 \"avec une illustration plus riche et augmenté d'un important essai intitulé 'Un des siècles du culte des images.'\" Reference to \"Nicolas Poussin, auquel sont consacrées de nombreuses pages de l'étude de B.\" \"La particularité de la critique artistique de B. . . . est de savoir conjoindre, en une gerbe unique, des éléments qui ne se marient d'habitude que de la façon la plus rare.\" J. discusses these features.\n\nBONNEY, RICHARD. The Limits of Absolutism. Aldershot: Variorum, 1995.\n\nReprint.\n\nBRAUDEL, FERNAND. Frankreich. 1: Raum und Geschichte. 2: Die Menschen und die Dinge. 3: Die Dinge und die Menschen. Stuttgart: Klett Cotta, 1989–1990.\n\nReview: P. Fuchs in HZ 258 (1994), 716–21: German translation of B.'s Identité de la France. Vol. 1 comprehensively focuses on France's diversity, treating subjects from family life to government, agriculture, railroads and education. Vol. 2 focuses on chronological demography, vol. 3 examines economy. Impressive reliance on primary sources and archives. Overall, the German version though readable does not meet the standard of excellence of the French one.\n\nBREMMER, JAN, and HERMAN ROODENBURG, eds. A Cultural History of Gesture. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1992.\n\nReview: Ann Daly in TDR 39.1 (1995), 156–58: This book \"defines 'gesture' very broadly, as 'any kind of bodily movement or posture (including facial expression) which transmits a message to the observer' . . . . No distinction is drawn between posture, gesture, etiquette, and paralinguistics, so the book addresses an unrestricted range of everyday movement practices . . . . Written by scholars across the disciplines of folklore, anthropology, history, and philology, the ten papers aim to excavate the cultural meanings of human movement in a variety of times and places, from ancient Greece to present-day Andalusia . . . .\" \". . . [T]he volume's significance for performance studies scholars,\" according to D., \"lies in its articulation and demonstration of the moving body as a cultural and historical text.\"\n\nReview: P.M. Simonds in RenQ 46 (1993), 852–853: Reviewer points out that this \"fascinating\" collections of essays is primarily concerned with masculine bodies but expects that it will stimulate further research in related areas, perhaps including female bodies. Sources for the essay include: literature, art, as well as manuals of rhetoric and conduct.\n\nBRENNAN, KATHERINE STERN. \"The Story of a Statue: The Politics of Reportage in the Periodical Press of 1685.\" CdDS 5:2 (Fall 1991) 195–209.\n\nB's article examines the development of the presse pérodique during the seventeenth century, by tracing \"the reportage of a single event in three different publications. \"The event, the erection in Caen of a statue of Louis XIV in 1685, was reported in 1) the Gazette 2) the Mercure Galant and 3) the Nouvelles de la République des lettres. B. argues that the first journal, \"simply reported the festivities and placed them in the context of more important news from the provinces.\" However, the Mercure Galant, a literary journal catering to the established classes, reprinted a panegyric of the King that \"demonstrated unequivocally to its readers the publication's sanction of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\" By contrast, the editor of the Nouvelles de la République gave a different interpretation. The editor, Pierre Bayle, a Protestant exile in Holland, at first presented a relatively neutral description of the dedication. Later, however, in an anonymous book, Bayle decried the statue as a form of political idolatry.\n\nBREWARD, CHRISTOPHER. The Culture of Fashion: A New History of Fashionable Dress. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1995.\n\nReview: B. B. Chico in Choice 33 (1995), 521: \"Influenced by recent sociological studies of popular culture, B. demonstrates how interpretations of fashion can be extremely complex when based on considerations of class, gender, age, sexuality, and location. . . . Disdaining generalizations, he calls for a careful empirical use of art history and literary and social data. This chronological narrative overview from the Middle Ages to the 1990s shows how dressing the body reflects the evolution of European culture. It is a study of individualism and democratization as expressed sartorially.\" \"Although most sources are British,\" notes the reviewer, \"scholars beyond Britain can benefit from this thought provoking study that illustrates new and potentially rich research directions.\"\n\nBROOKS, WILLIAM. Le Théâtre et l'opéra vus par les gazetiers Robinet et Laurent (1670–1678). PFSCL/Biblio 17, 78 (1993).\n\nReview: Bénédicte Louvat in RHL 95:1 (Janiver-février 1995), 92: L. claims that in this work, \"l'auteur a voulu poursuivre le travail de rédition des lettres en vers touchant les spectacles dramatiques et lyriques que Loret, puis Robinet et Laurent ont écrites de 1650 à 1678. The reviewer points out that while \"l'entreprise reste pourtant inachevée,\" since many of Robinet's letters cannot be located, the \"unfinished\" nature of the collection \"ne nuit pas...à la qualité et à l'intérêt de l'édition.\"\n\nBROWN, JONATHAN. Kings and Connoisseurs: Collecting Art in Seventeenth-Century Europe. Princeton: PUP., 1995.\n\nBROWNSTEIN, RACHEL M. Tragic Muse: Rachel of the Comédie Française. New York: Knopf, 1993.\n\nReview: Lesley Ferris in TJ 46 (1994), 432–34: Reviewed with two other books. B.'s study \"explores the inherent contradictions in the attitudes towards actresses in the nineteenth century while simultaneously questioning the very idea of biography itself.\" According to F., this book \"performs a tour de force post mortem on the convoluted meta narratives of performance.\" \"B.'s examination of . . . paradoxes [that the reviewer has discussed] provide the reader with a wealth of illuminating connections about the iconic nature of 'woman,' the ambivalent position of the actress, and the complicating issues of race and class.\"\n\nBUCI-GLUCKSMAN, CHRISTINE. Baroque Reason: The Aesthetics of Modernity. Trans.Patrick Camiller. New York: Sage, 1994.\n\n1st published in France in 1994.\n\nBUCK, AUGUST, ed. Der Europa Gedanke. Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1992.\n\nReview: W. Loth in HZ 258 (1994), 423: Proceedings of a German Italian historical conference focusing on the concept of \"Europa.\" 17th c. scholars will appreciate contributions on Sully, Richelieu and manners under the French 17th and 18th c. monarchies.\n\nBULST, NEITHARD and JEAN-PHILIPPE GENET, eds. La Ville, la bourgeoisie et la genèse de l'Etat moderne (XIIe–XVIIIe siècles). Paris: CNRS, 1988.\n\nReview: K. Gerteis in HZ 256 (1993), 134–135: The acts of a 1985 colloque held at Bielefeld receive here mixed review, in part because of the widely disparate nature of subjects treated. Divided into three sections: \"pouvoirs,\" \"économie et finances,\" and \"culture et religion,\" volume includes, in part two, a study of trade jurisdiction in 16th, 17th and 18th c. France.\n\nBUNNEY, RICHARD. The European Dynastic State, 1494–1660. New York: Oxford UP, 1991.\n\nReview: W. T. MacCaffrey in RenQ 47 (1994), 154–155: \"Authoritative guide for scholars in a wide variety of fields,\" this is the first of four volumes on the history of Modern Europe. Chapters treat: religious/ political history, the major continental societies, outsiders of Europe (Baltic/Slavic/Ottoman), population and social structure, economy and cultural history. B. convincingly justifies focus on theme of dynasty.\n\nBURNS, J.H., ed. with MARK GOLDIE. The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450–1700. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1991.\n\nReview: P. Zagorin in RenQ 46 (1993), 395–398: Topically and thematically structured within a chronological framework, this valuable reference work is warmly recommended for its \" exceptional usefulness as a competent survey of a host of political ideas and thinkers of the early modern era.\" Organized in five sections: \"Renaissance and Counter Renaissance,\" \"Religion, Civil Government and the Debate on Constitutions,\" \"Absolutism and Revolution in the Seventeenth Century,\" \"The End of Aristotelianism,\" and \"Natural Law and Utility,\" the volume has bibliographies for each section, with original and secondary sources. Methodology is generally that of the history of ideas.\n\nCAHIERS V.L. SAULNIER 10. Musique et Humanisme à la Renaissance. Paris: Presses de l'Ecole Normale Supérieure, 1993.\n\nReview: F.-R. Hausmann in ZRP 110 (1994), 685–86: Reviewer is considerably disappointed by this volume which lacks cohesiveness and, in his opinion, deals with remote subdisciplines. Nevertheless, essays on music and science in 17th c. France and on music as a literary theme in the baroque period will be of interest to dix-septiémistes.\n\nCANOVA-GREEN, MARIE-CLAUDE. La Politique spectacle au grand siecle: les rapports franco anglais. PFSCL/Biblio 17, 76 (1993).\n\nReview: Bénédicte Louvat in RHL 95:1 (Janvier-févier 1995), 92: L. describes this work as \"une étude comparée du ballet de cour français et son cousin le masque anglais, envisagés sous l'angle de leurs rapports avec la politique et la diplomatie.\" According to L., the author views the ballet as an allegory of the power and relationship between the two countries. In general, the reviewer welcomes the book, praising the author's comparative approach, as well as her emphasis on close reading. L. finds the author's dual perspective to be \"à la croisée de l'histoire, de l'esthétique et de la sociologie.\"\n\nReview: Charles Mazouer in IL 46:4 (sept-oct. 1994), 46–47: C.-G. examines French ballet and English \"masque\" as \"instruments de la politique et de la diplomatie [où] tous les développements saisissent la réalité évolutive des relations franco-anglaises.\" M.'s review is favorable, as he praises C.-G. for combining social, political and esthetic perspectives \"sous l'angle original des divertissements de cour.\" Of special note are the bibliography, an index of illustrations and an \"excellent tableau chronologique comparé\" of courtly entertainment in France and England.\n\nReview: H. Phillips in MLR 90 (1995), 439: Author aims \"to relate both forms of spectacle to the political and diplomatic relations between England and France, to analyse exchanges in terms of models and artists, and to describe the evolving image of England and France during the seventeenth century.\"\n\nSee French 17 (1994, 93).\n\nCANOVA-GREEN, MARIE-CLAUDE. \"History and Myth at the Court of the Bourbon Kings (1610–1643).\" SCFS 17 (1995), 53–67.\n\nFocus on several telling examples of the creation of \"myth-history\" in the royal ballets of the 1620s, then the 1660s, as royal propaganda. The course of historiography in the later century \"was to prove impervious to the workings of mythhistory.\" Illustrated. Nothing new here; but the presentation is pointed and well developed.\n\nCARRE, MARIE-ROSE. Le Bourgeois parisien de 1640 peint par lui-même. Paris; Nizet, 1994. Preface byRobert Aulotte.\n\nUses the conferences of Renaudot (1633–43) and achieves a \"peinture sous le regard clairvoyant et compréhensif de Marie-Rose Carré, du Bourgeois parisien des bousculantes annees 1640: en train de se décourvrir, de se connaître et de se faire connaître dans la révélatrice pratique des conférences.\" (Aulotte)\n\nCASTAGNO, PAUL C. The Early Commedia dell'arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context. New York: P. Lang, 1994.\n\nReview: P. Koch in Choice 32 (1995), 1740: The author \"believes this art form was, at least in its beginnings, a product of mannerism. Proof of this involves the author in a wide-ranging exploration of the post-Renaissance movement and requires extensive forays into the history, music and, above all, the fine arts of the period (roughly 1575–1625) in Italy and the rest of Europe.\" K. identifies numerous \"tangible shortcomings\" of the book. \"On a purely mechanical level, the index is incomplete, titles mentioned in the notes do not always recur in the bibliography, and the frequency of typos is inordinately high, especially in the spellings of French and Italian quotations. Although . . . [C.'s] command of these two languages is generally sound,\" says K., \"some of his mistranslations are astonishing enough to cast doubt on the overall reliability of the arguments. And the abundance of vexing neologisms does nothing to strengthen the reader's conviction.\"\n\nCESSAC, CATHERINE. Marc Antoine Charpentier. Trans.E. Thomas Glasow. Ed. Reinhard G. Pauly. New York: Amadeus, 1995.\n\nReview: K. Thomerson in Choice 33 (1995), 474: \"C.'s music was neglected for nearly two centuries after his death in 1704. A few of his pieces are heard today, but more than 500 works exist in diverse sacred and secular forms, the majority in autograph manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. . . . C. first produced this comprehensive volume in French (1988), and this English translation is excellent,\" says T. The author \"describes the clash of French and Italian musical styles in late 17th century France, the monopoly of Lully, Lully and Charpentier's work with Molière and the Comédie Française, court life under Louis XIV, musical patronage of the Duchesse de Guise and the Jesuits, and specific works. The author also provides a chronological table, a catalog of works, and two appendixes of texts. Highly recommended for all academic collections.\"\n\nCHALIAND, GERARD, ed. The Art of War in World History: From Antiquity to the Nuclear Age. Berkeley: U of California P, 1994.\n\nReview: Jeremy Black in JES 98 (1995), 199–200: \"This is essentially an anthology of strategy.\" \"The distinctive features of C.'s selection,\" according to B., \"are global range, a major role for what Lucien Poirier in his foreword terms irregulars, and a focus on the struggle between sedentary areas and nomad invasions.\" B. describes the book as \"a 'Eurasian' volume with all too little attention devoted to the Pacific world. . . . As far as Europe is concerned, there is too little on northern and eastern and too much on western Europe,\" in the reviewer's opinion. \"Logistics receives insufficient attention,\" says B., who adds, however, that \". . . this is an interesting collection, a better anthology than any other of its type . . . .\"\n\nCHARNLEY, JOY. \"Morocco/France: A Non-Meeting of Minds.\" SCFS 17 (1995), 125–33.\n\nAnalysis of the tragicomic delegation of Saint-Olon, Louis XIV's emissary, to Mouley-Ismael (1693), and his narrative, which is \"extremely critical and unwilling to recognize any good in the Moroccans.\"\n\nCHARTIER, ROGER, ed. The Culture of Print. Trans.Lydia Cochrane. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1989.\n\nReview: P.S. Graham in RenQ 46 (1993), 562–565: Although quibbling about details (a slight mistitle, less than idiomatic English translation, problems with certain of the essays), G. does find that the book \"contains useful studies to support his [Chartier's] effective syntheses elsewhere.\" Range of study includes manuscripts, methodology is that of specific case study.

For the bourgeois-turned-noble, a coat-of-arms sporting an animal signalled a certain subversiveness with respect to the noblesse de sang, whose use of animal figures was less frequent, and whose blasons depicted more traditional images such as those of the warrior and the hunter. According to D., this reconfigured symbolism on the part of the new nobility amounted to a kind of semiological destabilization. D. points to the subtlety of these new signs, which, despite their pretention to the aristocratic echelons of society, discreetly preserved some of their bearer's common origins through word-play. He suggests that the quiet preservation of non-noble origins in some blasons was done with \"la bénédiction de l'autorité royale,\" as a \"strategic\" and \"tacit\" acknowledgement of the new power of the bourgeoisie.\n\nDUCHHARDT, HEINZ, RICHARD A.

Rosemary Morris (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1994). \"Seeing the Enlightenment as part of a well policed absolutist system and not plotting to overthrow it, G. nevertheless shows in the social intercourse between nobility and bourgeoisie and the love of reasoned discussion a move away from hierarchical society based on corporate privilege. After presenting different types of sociability as well as the semantic development of certain key words, G. follows the rise of other models for civility to rival that of the court, from the salon of Mlle de Scudéry to Suard's defence of the Scottish Enlightenment with its flattering picture of French sociability as the culmination of humanity's progress away from barbarity.\" \"Providing valuable insights into life under the Old Regime, both books also suggest modern parallels.\"\n\nReview: V. G. Wexler in Choice 32 (1995), 1360: The reviewer describes this work as \"a sophisticated and original interpretation of how the idea of sociability evolved in French culture from the reign of Louis XIV to the French Revolution. Aristocratic values, the repressive lifestyle at Versailles, and to a greater extent, the centralized administrative bureaucracy, dominated notions of sociability in the 17th century. The 18th century Enlightenment provided a moderate alternative to court culture by creating a new language of sociability, which gave citizens the tools, such as civilized discourse as well as the notion of politeness, to form a society that might function without the absolutist model on the one hand, and strict democracy on the other . . . .

G. argues that through the marriage metaphor and the \"loi salique,\" Louis XIV managed to \"féminis[er] les sujets,\" through oppression while demanding absolute loyalty. Furthermore, Louis succeeded in breaking the bond created by his \"corps mystique\" as Sovereign by indulging the fancies of his \"corps naturel.\" G. contends that in the absence of a Parliament on the English model to safeguard against the excesses of an absolute ruler, the French monarchy destroys itself in part because of the contradictions in a metaphor which requires fidelity from one body, but allows indiscretion from another.\n\nHATTENHAUER, HANS. Europäische Rechtsgeschichte. Heidelberg: Müller, 1992.\n\nReview: H. Coing in HZ 258 (1994), 728–29: Overwhelmingly enthusiastic review for what C. calls \"the first European history of law.\" H. contrasts the archaic laws of the Celts, Teutons and Slavs with scientific, rational laws as he considers intellectual culture and the political situation. A unique and excellent book, it is as authoritative as it is vast (825 pages). Chap.

This relationship moved toward a \"stabilization of desire\" in response to the Wars of Religion. \"Stabilization\" came about in the building of the state and the cult of personality surrounding Louis XIV. H. praises the articles in question, claiming that their emphasis on class, partisan expression, and the interpretation of historical events demonstrates the new forms \"political desire\" adopted as society sought to heal itself. Later, however, H. notes that the artifice inherent in the \"focus of all public loyalties and private individuals\" in one figure led to the collapse of such a system and encouraged the \"desire\" for iconoclasm.\n\nHILGAR, MARIE FRANCE. \"Mehemet Riza Beg, ambassadeur persan à la cour du roi soleil,\" in Actes de Lexington.

Claiming that the prosecution of witches reached its height between 1560 and 1630, H. discusses both legal and religious definitions of witchcraft, such as those found in Le Marteau des sorcières (1582–87). H. views the harassement of those denounced as symptomatic of a general prejudice against women, particularly of the peasant class. Persecution occured on both a judicial and physical level, as impeached witches not only endured torture and execution, but were often denied representation and appeal. H. sees provincial magistrates as the main perpetrators of this abuse, with the situation improved only by the increased power of the Parisian Parlement, (c.1620–1640) and Louis XIV's edict of July 1682.\n\nHOLT, MACK P. ed.

It is also an exemplary work of cultural studies,\" in R.'s opinion. This volume, which \"establish[es] itself as a standard reference on the topic . . . ,\" includes material on France during the time of the Fronde. One essay is \". . . Joan DeJean's compelling and significant discussion of the putative origin of pornography, L'Ecole des filles, in which she explains why . . . this . . . text came to be consecrated by literary historians as the origin of a genre. In so doing, she also comments in a more general way on literary history's inescapable insistence on the construction of origins.\" This book \"maps the route of modern pornography from its birth in Renaissance Italy to its ultimate reconfiguration as a genre unto itself. That pornography was, for the first three hundred years of its existence in the modern period, indistinguishable as a separate genre is the fundamental thesis of this collection . . . . The essays show us how and why this was the case, and H.'s conclusion demonstrates how and why it was changed. This charting of the evolution of a discursive genre, when effected with as much erudition, critical sophistication, interdisciplinary range, and good writing as one finds here, is a rare achievement. [This volume] will not only become a requisite reference; it is sure,\" according to R., \"to change the way scholars talk about representations of sexuality in early modern Europe.\"\n\nINGRAO, CHARLES W.

Trans.Jeremy Whiteley andEmma Hughes. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1991.\n\nReview: G. McClure in RenQ 46 (1993), 409–412: Literary works whose setting is the table or the feast as well as didactic works on correct dining and conversation are the sources of this \"creative and intriguing study . . . [which] explores this theme [the banquet], charting the nexus between eating and literature in Renaissance culture.\" Although the reviewer quibbles with the book's organization and lack of chronological structure, he appreciates J.'s corrective to contemporary criticism's overemphasis of the autonomy of texts. J. contends that \"the symposiac setting encouraged sixteenth-century writers to unite oral, popular culture to high literary culture.\"\n\nJENKINS, RON. Subversive Laughter: The Liberating Power of Comedy. New York: Free Press, 1994.\n\nReview: M. Yacowar in Choice 32 (1995), 1127–28: \"Unlike most comedy theoreticians, J. . . . is an academic/clown, as distinct from . . . an academic clown. His thesis is that comedy draws its global society of oppressed aliens into a community. Comedy empowers the disadvantaged and helps the helpless survive. J. proves his thesis,\" according to Y., \"with first hand descriptive and analytic accounts of some fascinating and offbeat kinds of comedy.\" \"J. has been a clown and has performed in many of the alien comic forms he describes here. This firsthand experience, coupled with his analytic sensitivity, makes this a unique addition to comic theory.\"\n\nJONES, ARCHER. The Art of War in the Western World.

The Cambridge Illustrated History of France. New York: Cambridge UP, 1994.\n\nReview: F. Burkhard in Choice 32 (1995), 991: \"Lavishly illustrated, . . . this volume is an important work of synthesis as well as a handsome introduction to France and the French for the general reader.

Poverty and Deviance in Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge UP, 1994.\n\nReview: D. C. Baxter in Choice 32 (1995), 1188–89: \"Cambridge's new series of undergraduate textbooks ('New Approaches to European History') seeks to provide 'concise but authoritative surveys' of major themes. This addition . . . ably succeeds,\" according to B., \"in synthesizing current research in French, English, and German. J. . . . presents a topical treatment of the subject: images of the poor, causes of poverty, living conditions, relations of the poor to the community, public order, development of institutional relief, as well as the 'culture of poverty.' In the process, he informs readers of important recent work such as that which stresses the commonality of Protestant and Catholic experience rather than exaggerating the impact of the Reformation.\" B. finds that this \"admirable scholarly synthesis . . . is less successful as a text for American students.\" In B.'s opinion, the study \"is marred by a flat style that affects readability.\"\n\nKAHN, VICTORIA. Machiavellian Rhetoric: From the Counter Reformation to Milton. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1994.\n\nReview: C. Fantazzi in Choice 32 (1995), 773: This volume concerns \"how M. was read in the Renaissance, how he offered Renaissance writers a rhetoric for thinking about politics.\" K. finds that \"recent interpretations of M. have created an artificial bifurcation between his political thought and rhetorical practice. In proof of her thesis she provides a rhetorical analysis first of works of M. and then of representative readers of him on the continent and in England up to the time of Milton.\" F. observes that \". . . the thesis does not seem to be as new as it is made out to be, and the style can be rather tortuous,\" in the reviewer's opinion. \"The author displays a thorough familiarity with relevant work on the subject,\" states F., \"but unfortunately does not provide a bibliography.\"\n\nKARPIK, LUCIEN.

Three major divisons treat: the concept of health as God given, health conditions and the role of the doctor.\n\nLAGARDE, FRANÇOIS. \"L'allégorie des corps de pierre: la Grande Commande de 1674,\" in Actes du premier colloque conjointement organisé par la North American Society for Seventeenth Century French Literature et le Centre International de Rencontres sur le XVIIe siècle.

L'académisme capte la beauté physique idéale à l'avantage des seuls grands.

Wallace in Choice 32 (1995), 1361: Although this work \"reflects profound erudition,\" in the reviewer's opinion it \"is written in a frustratingly elliptical style. The author assumes readers possess a knowledge of French history and historiography. He supports his arguments with obscure allusions, statistical fragments, or anachronistic historical comparisons,\" according to W. The author \"defines classic monarchy as the entire ancien régime from its demographic make up to factional cliques, and all are fused into an unchanging ahistorical structure. Royal reigns receive neither systematic nor chronological discussion. The work is inaccessible to students,\" declares W., who adds that \"scholars will also be disappointed, for the essay never analyzes the rich scholarship on which it rests.\"\n\nLE ROY LADURIE, EMMANUEL.

Voilà trois bourgeois de Bâle, Thomas le père, premier à s'arracher au statut paysan, puis deux de ses fils déjà nés en bourgeoisie, Félix et Thomas II. L'âge venu, ils ont raconté leur itinéraire et leur quête. Projet déjà classique en leur temps, mais rajeuni chez eux par un élan vital, une curiosité formidables.\" The author of this study, described by N. as \"grand amateur de ces témoignages 'à cru,' aux sources même de l'Histoire,\" was attracted by the experience of these three members of the P. family, \"[t]rois voyageurs qui ont vécu, senti, pensé aux dimensions de l'Europe et qui ont su le dire avec ingénuité . . . .\"\n\nLESTRINGANT, FRANK. Le Cannibale: Grandeur et décadence. Paris: Perrin, 1994.\n\nReview: Denise-Marie Lécuyer in RSH 235 (1994), 151–53: \"L'auteur, à partir du corpus déjà par lui étudié des textes de la Découverte et récits de voyages du seizième siècle, dépasse l'impression donnée par les images sanglantes et les évocations horribles des corps dépecés. Il utilise pour cela deux armes: l'analyse savante et l'humour noir.\" \"Le propos de son travail,\" according to the reviewer, \"n'est pas le cannibalisme en lui-même, mais son interprétation forgée par l'imaginaire européen tout au long de la période qui s'étend des Découvertes au XIXe siècle.\" The 13 chapters of this book \"proposent un examen diachronique des différentes lectures du cannibalisme, des différentes utilisations de ce phénomène dans l'art européen.\" \"Il ne s'agit pas . . . de l'analyse ethnographique du phénomène, mais de son invention et de sa transmission par les Européens.\"\n\nLETTS, JANET T. \"Responsive Readers of the Mercure Galant 1680–1710.\" CdDS 5:2 (Fall 1991) 211–228.\n\nL. gives a demographic breakdown of the Mercure Galant's readership primarily by examining those groups who answered the journal's énigmes. Providing statistical data on the riddle-solvers for the period in question, L. describes the Mercure's public in terms of gender, city, social class and profession. She notes that a large percentage of the respondants were women, since the journal's editors, Donneau de Visé and Thomas Corneille, recognized that \"Women had been at the center of galant literary activity since early in the century.\" L. concludes by studying the \"types of identifications\" the riddle-solvers used to designate themselves. Three types were used most frequently: sociable, familial and amourous. After cataloguing and describing these identifications, L. surmises that the Mercure's readership was \"increasingly feminine, Parisian and socially transitional.\"\n\nLEUPIN, ALEXANDRE, ed. Lacan and the Human Sciences. Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1991.\n\nReview: G.L. Ulmer in ECr 33 (1993), 103–104: Reviewer does not indicate 17th c. ramifications of this collection of essays, but judging from his high opinion of the volume and the fruitful Lacanian programs of research of a number of 17th c. scholars, the book will undoubtedly be of considerable interest. U. also points to its possible use as a textbook for courses which deal with the impact of French theory on the humanities and social sciences. Literature scholars will not be disappointed in the examination of \"the special place of 'letters' in Lacanian psychoanalysis.\" Contributors are judged among \"the most original thinkers in the academy today.\"\n\nLEWITA, BEATRIX. French Bourgeois Culture. Trans.J. A. Underwood. Cambridge: Cambridge UP/Maison des Sciences de l'Homme, 1994.\n\nReview: B. Kilborne in Choice 32 (1995), 1506: \"In this well-illustrated study, L. has attempted to define the French bourgeoisie, their standards, and their values. In so doing she relies on the methodologies developed in France in the disciplines of social history and sociology. She makes use of personal diaries, concise interviews, statistics, and linguistic materials—the full panoply of source materials, enriched by well-chosen photographs. L.'s attempts at definition are sophisticated and instructive, although her quarry constantly eludes her.\" \"In conclusion L. notes that the values of the bourgeoisie are profoundly influenced by Catholic notions of family and social responsibility, and as such, directly linked to Port Royal and centuries of French history.\"\n\nLIVET, GEORGES.

Louis XIV and the French Monarchy. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 1994.\n\nReview: F. K. Metzger in Choice 32 (1995), 1190: This \"'political biography' . . . purports to show through a close examination of French foreign and religious policy how Louis XIV's political ideas did in fact change during the 72 years of his long reign. The first three chapters are a lucid and helpful overview of the French monarchy in general, the government of France, and the European state 'system' in the 17th century. Though there is nothing new here,\" according to M., \"the clarity of these chapters is outstanding. The rest of this study covers in some detail the complexities of French policies and the royal role in their development. . . . There is little here—purposely—on Louis XIV the man, or on social, intellectual, or economic developments during the period. For those interested in a fuller account of the entire reign,\" says M., \"John B. Wolf's Louis XIV (1968) remains the standard English language study of the king and his reign.\"\n\nMAJOR, J. RUSSELL. From Renaissance Monarchy to Absolute Monarchy: French Kings, Nobles & Estates. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1994.\n\nReview: Anon. in VQR 71 (1995), 82: \"Crowning 45 years of research, M.'s encyclopedic overview of the evolution of the French state argues that the 'absolute monarchy' was not produced by an alliance of the crown and towns against a rebellious landed aristocracy. Rather, the kings, starting with Henry IV, bound the aristocracy ever closer to the throne by ensuring their benefits from the royal bureaucracy, while royal ministers from Sully to Colbert toiled assiduously to increase the authority of royal officials at the expense of sovereign courts, provincial estates, and municipal councils. This densely packed and closely argued work will prove to be a valuable research and reference tool to teachers and scholars interested in the rise of the modern state.\"\n\nMAHON, DENIS. \"The Written Sources for Poussin's Landscapes, with Special Reference to his Two Landscapes with Diogenes.\" Burlington Magazine 137 (1995), 176–182.\n\nAnswers affirmatively the question whether \"Poussin's range in 1648–49 could have been so wide as to permit the production of a couple of major pictorial achievements simultaneously with many others which cohere and differ radically from them in artistic style.\"\n\nMALKIN, IRAD, éd.

T. overturns the conventional treatment of the rise of nation-state power and Cartesian and Newtonian rationalism in the seventeenth century.\" \"Descartes and his modernist descendants rigorously separated the mental from the material, discarded rhetoric for axioms and logic, and ruled out the possibility of contextual knowledge.\" \"When theatre history emerged as an academic discipline in German universities in the late nineteenth century, the mind/material dualism of Descartes . . . helped to define the parameters of the new scholarship. The protocols of the new discipline directed theatre historians to look primarily at what was believed to be the material side of the theatrical past—theatrical ruins, costume sketches, descriptions of movement on stage—in an effort to reconstruct the material realities of historical productions. Theatre historians left the so-called mental activities of the theatrical past to philologists. This division of labour was partly based on the Cartesian assumption that processes involving matter, as distinct from the activities of the human mind, were predictable effects of determinate causes, and hence could have a history which might be discovered and written down.\" In M.'s view, although \"[m]ost of us have long since abandoned this narrow understanding of theatre history, . . . the after-effects of its Cartesian-based positivism linger on.\"\n\nMEMOIRES DE LA SOCIETE POUR L'HISTOIRE DU DROIT ET DES INSTITUTIONS DES ANCIENS PAYS BOURGUIGNONS, COMTOIS ET ROMANDS. 47e fascicule (1990).

Baxter in Choice 32 (1995), 1649: \"There is much to praise in this work . . . ,\" according to B. The author \"presents a fresh evaluation of a well-worked field, family history. Based largely on extensive examination of secondary sources, [O.] argues against a complacent acceptance of historical demography and prescriptive literature in understanding the family.\" \"Her focus is the interaction of family members themselves, the 'lived family,' rather than the institutional framework. She explores personal relationships in the complex households of the early modern period . . . . Recommended for all interested in family history.\"\n\nOLMI, GIUSEPPE. L'inventario del monda: Catalogazione della natura e luoghi del sapere nella prima età moderna. Bologna: Il Mulino, 1992.\n\nReview: Jay Tribby in Isis 85 (1994), 795–96: Collects 6 essays (1977–92): two essays are important reexaminations of new techniques of illustration, engraving, and pringing; another pair traces changes in collecting practices, from the 16th to the 17th centuries and their relation to the new availability of ancient natural history texts; one other explores interest in objects from the Americas; the last, Cesi's Accademia dei Lincei. \"Much of the best recent scholarship of the collection, illustration, and display of natural objects in early modern Italy owes a debt to one or more of these essays.\"\n\nOLSON, RICHARD. The Emergence of the Social Sicences, 1642–1792. New York: Twayne/Macmillan, 1993.\n\nReview: Jorge Canizares in Isis 85 (1994), 518–19: \"A superbly crafted historical synthesis\" with a very useful bibliographical essay. Taxonomy, \"an important contribution within itself\": psychology, sociology, political economy, and cameralism. Distinguishes two generations in the early histories principally on the criterion of knowledge claims in scientific theory (certainty or not) and also of the heuristic role of hypothesis and anology.\n\nOSIANDER, ANDREAS. The States System of Europe, 1640–1990: Peacemaking and the Conditions of International Stability. New York: Oxford UP, 1994.\n\nReview: S. Bailey in Choice 32 (1995), 1191: \"If the great attraction of therealist school of international relations is its apparent universality it argues that immutable principles govern the use of power its great failing is that it is not historical. This is the major thesis of O. . . .in his superb study of peacemaking at Westphalia, Utrecht, Vienna, and Versailles. In each instance what mattered most was not what the international order was . . . but what statesmen thought it should be. In 1648, in 1713, and in 1815 they came to agreement, and their agreement meant stability for Europe. . . . All this ended at Versailles, where there was no consensus and where a defeated power was treated as an international outcast. The statesmen of 1919 made the mistake their predecessors had avoided, and with baleful results.\"\n\nPELZER, ERICH. Der elsässische Adel im Spätfeudalismus.

Fuchs in HZ 258 (1994), 498–99: Reviewer finds significant omissions in this broader treatment stemming from a 1985 Frieburg dissertation.

Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1994.\n\nReview: Anon. in VQR 71 (1995), 68: This volume is described as a \"fascinating, abundantly illustrated book, which professes to be about 'the French origins of modern cooking' but is about much, much more. We learn about ancient Roman cooking, Arabic confections, and Renaissance delights of the table, . . .\" among other topics. \"Eventually,\" says the reviewer, \"we learn about the great 'French synthesis,' the 'French style,' which emerges in the 17th century [sic].

M. notes other areas which could have been examined more systematically such as modification of the coast and shifting of rivers but has words of praise for the detailed general index.\n\nPOHL, HANS, ed.

Three sections imply three mediums through which the cultural field was historically structured: a genre of classificatory books, which includes use of Claire Farago's essay on Renaissance perspective; by prominent individuals, with a paper on arguments in Galileo's Dialogue by Nicolas Jardine, and on Gassendi; the impact of institutions.\n\nPRICE, J. L. Holland and the Dutch Republic in the Seventeenth Century: The Politics of Particularism. New York: Oxford UP, 1994.\n\nReview: J. J. Butt in Choice 32 (1995), 992–93: This book is described as \"a superb political analysis of one region in early modern Europe.\" According to B., \"[t]his detailed study, well grounded in the literature, is a model revision, examining the practice rather than merely the theory of the interactions of politics, religion, and economics in Holland; it should be used,\" in B.'s opinion, \"to compare the Dutch Republic with England and France in the 17th century. The sections on religion are especially good,\" states B., who considers the study to be \"an exemplar of scholarly originality.\"\n\nPRICE, ROGER. A Concise History of France.

The Great Powers and Global Struggle, 1490–1990. Lexington: UP of Kentucky, 1995.\n\nReview: C. A. Hody in Choice 33 (1995), 213: \"In the tradition of long cycle theory, R. and T. examine the dynamics of the rise and fall of great powers. Specifically, they focus on the pattern of conflict between declining global leaders in the international system and ascending regional leaders. According to the authors, this pattern of conflict has triggered a sequence of global or transitional wars over the past 500 years, the outcomes of which have greatly shaped the modern world.\" The authors' \"analysis is unique among long cycle theorists because of their concentration on the role of rising regional leaders . . . .\"\n\nRAYMOND, JEAN-FRANCOIS de, ed. Christine, Reine de Suède, Apologies. Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1994.\n\nReview: Alain Génetiot in RHL 95:2 (Mars-avril 1995), 313: G. remarks that this is the first French edition of Christine's three works 1) La Vie de la Reine Christine faite par elle-même 2) L'Ouvrage du loisir and 3) Les Sentiments. In general, the work deals with C.'s \"conscience religieuse\" which prompted her to abdicate and subsequently dedicate herself to the Counter-Reformation. G. summarizes his comments by noting that \"ces trois ouvrages manifestent à la fois l'essence royale de la reine, son éthique héroique...et l'histoire de son âme dans sa vocation spirituelle.\"\n\nReview: J.

Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1993.\n\nReview: Marc Escola in RHL 94:6 (novembre-décembre 1994), 1072–1073: In the main, the work studies the influence (albeit posthumus) Descartes may have had on Christine's abdication and her disavowal of Lutheranism. However, after a description of the Queen's schooling, de Raymond discusses the \"intrigue (au sens aristotélicien) de la correspondance philosophique prolongée en un vrai dialogue intellectuel\" between the two parties. This dialogue prompted,\"de façon décisive... l'élaboration du Traité des passions.\" While the Queen may have influenced Descartes, the book asks whether \"la relation de la Reine et du philosophe s'arrête-t-elle avec la disparition du philosophe?\" The reviewer gives no direct answer, but implies that D.'s intellectual and theological sway with Christine was considerable. In a final remark. E. observes that de Raymond's text is worth reading simply for the correspondance of Descartes, Chanut and Christine.\n\nReview: J. Lafond in PFSCL 22 (1995), 292–295: The relationship between the queen and the philosopher \"consiste en un échange beaucoup plus étendu que l'Histoire ne l'a retenu.\" Reviewer finds that all is well in this study except for the conclusion that the relationshop between the queen and the philosopher had transformed their beings.\n\nROCHE, DANIEL.
