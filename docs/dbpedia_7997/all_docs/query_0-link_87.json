        "text": "“It’s a mixed bag.”\n\nThat’s how Assemblyman Curt Hagman, San Bernardino Mayor Pat Morris and other area leaders described the legacy of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who will leave office on Monday.\n\nSchwarzenegger, who took the Governor’s Office in a 2003 recall election and was elected to a full term in 2006, came in as a charismatic outsider who wanted to “blow up the boxes” and reshape state government.\n\nHe leaves with a 32 percent approval rating and a list of accomplishments that, local leaders say, could have been longer had he done more to convince voters and lawmakers of his vision.\n\n“I worked very hard to get him elected,” said Hagman, R-Chino Hills. “I was really optimistic that as an outsider he would make the drastic changes California needed to do.”\n\nBut seven years later, Hagman and others said they are left wanting much more, especially in light of the state’s ongoing financial problems.\n\nSchwarzenegger railed against obscure state boards and commissions, but they remain largely intact.\n\nHe continued the political legacy of rewarding termed-out lawmakers by naming them to six-figure jobs on those boards.\n\nHe promised to get state government to tighten its belt but used borrowing and accounting gimmicks to close budget deficits.\n\n“I was disappointed – I think a lot of us in California were,” said Assemblyman Paul Cook, R-Yucaipa. “I think we were disappointed because he had enough charisma to make things happen. I expected more.”\n\nSchwarzenegger’s biggest political defeat came in 2005, when voters rejected a slate of Schwarzenegger-backed ballot measures that dealt with budget reform, redistricting, union dues and teacher tenure.\n\nThose measures failed in part, said Assemblywoman Wilmer Amina Carter, D-Rialto, because Schwarzenegger failed to sell them to the public – something he should have been good at.\n\n“I don’t think he articulated to the public how they were going to make a difference,” she said. “He presented it as against groups instead of as for people. … Instead of telling how it would benefit us, we saw it as a battle between two different groups.”\n\nAnother part of Schwarzenegger’s failings, said state Sen. Gloria Negrete McLeod, D-Montclair, was that he never forged a meaningful relationship with the state Legislature.\n\n“He came in thinking, `I’m going to go in there and tell everybody how to do stuff,’ but he forget that the governor is not the key,” Negrete McLeod said. “He had to work with the Legislature.”\n\nAnd some lawmakers say he rarely did that.\n\n“It almost got to the point that we couldn’t talk to his office,” Cook said. “It was a very isolated executive branch that was very cliquish.”\n\nDespite all that, Schwarzenegger does have some accomplishments to his name.\n\nState Sen. Bob Huff, R-Walnut, credited Schwarzenegger with helping to achieve some political reforms, including an independent commission that will redraw boundaries for political districts, and a “top-two” primary system in which the two candidates with the most votes in a primary will face off in the general election – regardless of their political affiliation.\n\n“All in all, I think he did a better job than most people think he did,” Huff said.\n\nPerhaps the most notable legislation signed by Schwarzenegger is Assembly Bill 32, a law aimed at capping the level of greenhouse gas pollution in the state.\n\nIt’s a polarizing law – one that put Schwarzenegger, at least for a time, in the good graces of Democrats and environmental groups and forever marked him as a “Republican in Name Only” among conservatives.\n\n“The one area where he did deliver, an area that he stayed committed to, was sustainability and the environment,” said San Bernardino’s Morris. “He believed we should be the vanguard state in sustainability and he helped bring through legislation that made that a reality.”\n\nMorris said he is proud of Schwarzenegger’s stance on A.B. 32 and other environmental issues because it pitted the governor, a Republican, against his own party.\n\n“That put him opposite a lot of conservative members of his lawmaking party,” Morris said. “He would not give way on that. And I’m proud of him for standing his ground.”\n\nAssemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Claremont, one of San Bernardino County’s two newest lawmakers, said he will remember Schwarzenegger most for A.B. 32.\n\n“Getting the budget under control would have been a great legacy,” Donnelly said. “Instead, his legacy will be A.B. 32. It’s a job killer.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nSchwarzenegger timeline\n\nKey moments in the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger:\n\nAugust 2003: Schwarzenegger announces on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno” that he will run for governor.\n\nOctober 2003: Gray Davis is recalled as governor.

We come in with an idea in mind of how we would like to change the system, but then we run into the system.” – Assemblywoman Wilmer Amina Carter, D-Rialto.\n\n“He’d be the first one to admit he didn’t get as far on these issues as he’d like to, but at least the issues are out there now and people are talking about them.” – Assemblyman Curt Hagman, R-Chino Hills.\n\n“He kept saying, `I’m not a politician.’ Buddy, once you’re elected, you’re a politician.” – State Sen. Gloria Negrete McLeod, D-Montclair.\n\n“I think in four years, he came to our (Assembly Republican) caucus meeting once. The big joke is everybody had to wear name tags … because he didn’t know our names.” – Assemblyman Paul Cook, R-Yucaipa.\n\n“All in all, I think he did a better job than most people think he did,” – State Sen. Bob Huff, R-Walnut.\n\n“As soon as he met some opposition, he just kind of gave up. I think that’s the danger for anyone running on a reform platform. It’s seductive – you want to be liked, you want to be part of the system.” – Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, R-Claremont.\n\n“He stripped our redevelopment – $13 million from San Bernardino. That’s a terrible rip-off of local resources.” – San Bernardino Mayor Pat Morris."
