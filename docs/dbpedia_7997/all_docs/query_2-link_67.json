        "text": "Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was in a joking mood, so he waved around a 2-foot-long knife just days before signing a budget that slashed programs for poor children, the sick and the disabled.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he were being insensitive, Schwarzenegger said he didn’t want to be seen as “El Stiffo,” suggesting that California’s past governors were less colorful than he is.\n\nBoy, were they.\n\nRemember the dour George Deukmejian, the monotoned Pete Wilson and the aptly named Gray Davis? Los Stiffos governed California for two decades before Schwarzenegger terminated Davis’ political career in the 2003 recall election.\n\nWhich raises a serious question: When voters elect a successor to the outsized Schwarzenegger next year, will they mark their ballots for a charismatic figure such as Gavin Newsom or fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, or for one of the accomplished but relatively bland Silicon Valley-ites vying for the GOP nomination: Tom Campbell, Steve Poizner or Meg Whitman?\n\nTo introduce some fun into the equation, the Mercury News asked five political analysts — academics who live and breathe California politics — to rate past governors, runners-up and the current crop of candidates on their charisma, effectiveness and leadership skills. The aim was to see how much of an advantage charisma is when it comes to winning elections and governing well.\n\nIn retrospect, how do Deukmejian, Wilson and Davis stack up against two charismatic figures — Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown — who reigned for 16 years before the run of, well, dull governors? And what’s a voter to make of the current field, which includes a big-city mayor with a movie-star pompadour (Newsom), a visionary guy who dated Linda Ronstadt in his previous stint as governor (Brown) and the subdued GOP troika?\n\nPolitical ‘gift’?\n\nOne thing that’s clear is that neither charisma nor the lack thereof guarantees success in office. Davis, for instance, was viewed as a quietly competent expert on state government when he was elected in a landslide in 1998. But he ended up being so feckless that voters made him the first California governor ever to be recalled. His replacement was a global icon renowned for his business savvy, but Schwarzenegger hasn’t been able to translate that personal magnetism into effective policy.\n\nOur panel’s verdict: Charisma — which comes from the ancient Greek word for “gift” — usually gives politicians an edge, but it’s hardly the deciding factor in who wins or what happens afterward.\n\nOf the seven California governors who held office in the last half century, Reagan was rated the highest on the charisma scale, earning a score of 9.4 out of 10. Deukmejian received the lowest score: 3.0.\n\n“If negative numbers were available, I would use them: George Deukmejian was a pretty good governor, but the least charismatic human being I’ve ever met — and I know accountants,” one of the judges wrote about Deukmejian on his scoring sheet. (To ensure candidness, the judges were told that individual scores would not be published.)\n\nThe other charisma ratings in descending order: Schwarzenegger (8.6), Jerry Brown (7.6), Pat Brown (6.2), Wilson (4.8) and Davis (3.6).\n\nBut it’s clear charisma doesn’t mean shoo-in. Yes, Pat Brown beat Richard Nixon (5.2) in 1962; Reagan beat Brown in 1966 and “Big Daddy” Jesse Unruh (6.6) in 1970. Schwarzenegger ousted Davis in the 2003 election and whomped Phil Angelides (3.2) in 2006; and Jerry Brown beat Evelle Younger (3.3) in 1974 and Houston Flournoy (4.0) in 1978.\n\nBut in three general elections for governor in the last 27 years, the charisma underdog won: Deukmejian over Tom Bradley (6.0) in 1982 and 1986; Wilson over Dianne Feinstein (5.4) in 1990, then over Kathleen Brown (6.8) in 1994; and Davis over Dan Lungren (5.0) in 1998.\n\nNo link to success\n\n“There’s almost no correlation between charisma and electoral success,” said one Mercury News judge, Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. “I think the lesson to be learned here is that a candidate who doesn’t have great levels of charisma shouldn’t be discouraged.”\n\nAnother judge, John Pitney, a government and politics professor at Claremont McKenna College, said: “Competence trumps charisma, all other things being equal.”\n\nThat should give assurance to state Insurance Commissioner Poizner, who received a charisma score of 2.6 — even lower than Deukmejian’s.\n\nHis fellow Republicans didn’t do much better: The wonky Campbell, a former Silicon Valley congressman, had a charisma rating of 3.6, former eBay CEO Whitman a 3.8.\n\nThe charisma scores of two major Democratic hopefuls were significantly higher. Jerry Brown, who still hasn’t made his candidacy official, landed on top with a 6.8 (almost a point lower than the rating he got as governor), and Newsom was rated only slightly lower with a 6.6.\n\nBut another judge, Larry Gerston, a San Jose State University political science professor, warns that the ratings shouldn’t in any way make Democrats believe they have the election in the bag.\n\n“Charisma can mean a lot of things. It can mean someone is really exciting, but charisma can also be wild and unpredictable,” he said.\n\nAs Pitney put it, alluding to a 2007 sex scandal: “Newsom is exciting, but it’s not all positive excitement. Cheating with your best friend’s wife is interesting, but not positive.”\n\nThe analysts were also asked to rate governors on their effectiveness and willingness to do and say politically unpopular things — a measurement of leadership.\n\nAgain, there seemed to be little correlation between charisma and effectiveness or leadership skills. Reagan’s scores, for example, were consistently high. He’s viewed as not only charismatic, but also effective (8.0) and a leader (7.0). But Deukmejian’s ratings were much higher for effectiveness (5.6) and leadership (6.2) than they were for charisma. Similarly, the charismatically challenged Wilson got a 7.6 for effectiveness and an 8.2 for leadership.\n\nThe current gubernatorial candidate whose scores come closest to Wilson’s is Campbell, who blew away the competition for effectiveness and leadership.\n\nIn interviews, the five judges said Republicans Reagan, Deukmejian and Wilson all “got things done” by being pragmatic as opposed to ideological. Sometimes, they made moves they knew would anger the GOP base — such as raising taxes or banning assault weapons.\n\nOne reason, said panelist Terry Christensen, also a political-science professor at San Jose State, is that Deukmejian, Reagan and Wilson “all had Republican legislators they could actually lead.”\n\nBut over the years, Democratic legislators have become more liberal as Republican lawmakers have become more conservative, making it hard for a moderate like Schwarzenegger to govern. His leadership rating (5.8) was fairly high, but his effectiveness rating (4.6) was pretty low.\n\nIn random interviews, voters who aren’t pundits were split on the importance of having a charismatic governor.\n\n‘Tired of showmanship’\n\n“I know that Schwarzenegger was a celebrity and all that stuff — and that people liked it,” said Ernest C. Catura, 55, a Kaiser Permanente optician who lives in San Jose. “But when it comes to governing, he doesn’t know what he’s doing. I’m tired of showmanship. I just want someone who can get things done.”\n\nStill, other voters said they might have been suspicious of Schwarzenegger because of his fame, but that he has proved to be more than a showman.\n\n“I don’t like his movies and I think he’s a terrible actor, but as a governor he’s done OK, and he’s surprised me with his smarts,” said Alan Brigham, 77, a Sunnyvale businessman. “If we get another Schwarzenegger, I’d be happy.”\n\nWhen times are good, the Mercury News judges say, voters are often willing to settle for boring competence — which might explain the long reign of dull governors through the mostly prosperous 1980s and ’90s. “If people are looking for change, then the charisma factor (think Obama and Schwarzenegger) is going to be important,” Gerston said. “But if they’re looking for stability, charisma can get in the way. Sometimes the voters just want a caretaker.”\n\nWhen times are bad, voters are more likely to turn to someone who can “suck all the air out of a room,” said the fifth judge, Barbara O’Connor, director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at California State University-Sacramento.\n\nBut, she warns, there may be a comedown for voters who let their emotions sweep them off their feet.\n\nThink love and marriage.\n\n“You may marry the charismatic person,” O’Connor said, “but then divorce them when you find out that charisma is all they’ve got.”\n\nContact Ken McLaughlin at 408-920-5552."
