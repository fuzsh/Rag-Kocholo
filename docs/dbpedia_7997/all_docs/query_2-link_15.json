        "text": "SACRAMENTO  Jerry Brown began his return engagement as governor of California on Monday, using his inaugural address to call for an end to partisan battling that he said was paralyzing the state and to promise, in what is presumably the last chapter of his public life, to lead California out of one of the toughest budget crises of its history.\n\n“Choices have to be made, and difficult decisions taken,” Mr. Brown declared to an audience that included two former governors and hundreds of state legislators. “At this stage of my life, I have not come here to embrace delay and denial.”\n\nAt times jocular, at times earnest, Mr. Brown noted  indeed celebrated  his longevity in California politics, a depth of experience that in no small part accounted for his victory in November as voters in so much of the rest of the country were turning to outsiders. At 72, Mr. Brown is returning for a third term as governor, a position also held by his father, offering a West Coast echo of what took place in Albany on Sunday with the swearing-in of Andrew M. Cuomo as governor of New York.\n\n“For me, this day is also special because I get to follow in my father’s footsteps once again, and, 36 years after my first inauguration as governor, even follow in my own,” Mr. Brown said.\n\nIn contrast to his first inaugural speech  where he called for a 7 percent cut in the size of his office staff  Mr. Brown did not offer many specifics for how he intended to deal with a state budget shortfall that is now projected at $28.5 billion over 18 months. But he has made clear that his solution, in a budget due Jan. 10, will call for deep cuts in state spending, and his aides have said it is also likely to include a request that voters extend tax surcharges scheduled to expire this year.\n\nMore than that, Mr. Brown  who has had a history of being something of a political iconoclast and who has always been drawn to populist themes and language  offered a clear rebuke to political leaders from both parties who have been enmeshed in what have, at times, seemed interminable and irresolvable political battles. This year, the Legislature adopted a budget 100 days late, setting a record.\n\n“In the face of huge budget deficits year after year and the worst credit rating among the 50 states, our two political parties can’t come close to agreeing on the right path forward,” the new governor said, as the lawmakers in his audience sat in still silence. “They remain in their respective comfort zones, rehearsing and rehashing old political positions.”\n\n“Perhaps this is why the public holds the state government in low esteem,”‘ he said, adding, “Without the trust of the people, politics degenerates into mere spectacle and democracy declines, leaving demagoguery and cynicism to fill the void.”\n\nMr. Brown looks far different than he did 36 years ago  what hair he has left has turned gray, as his audience was reminded with a slide show that included pictures from his first round as governor  and he is moving at a slightly slower pace.\n\nAnd many of the people who were here for his first inaugural are gone, including his father, Edmund G. Brown Sr., who died in 1996. The crowd on Monday included two other former governors  Gray Davis, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, to whom Mr. Brown paid a particularly warm tribute. (Mr. Schwarzenegger declined to endorse the Republican nominee for governor, Meg Whitman, in what was widely seen here as a tacit endorsement of Mr. Brown.)\n\nBut there were some striking similarities between Mr. Brown’s two inaugurations. Then, as now, California was coming out of a tough recession. One of the main themes of Mr. Brown’s first speech was how to deal with joblessness. The unemployment rate in January 1975 was 9.4 percent; it is now 12.4 percent.\n\nIn 1975, he was succeeding a Republican governor who was a former actor  Ronald Reagan; this time, it was Mr. Schwarzenegger, also a former actor. He also presented himself at that time as fiscally conservative and prepared to make cuts in state spending, as he did to a certain extent on Monday.\n\nThat said, Mr. Brown spoke for 16 minutes Monday  far longer than the seven minutes at his first inaugural. And as grave as things might seem fiscally, he appeared in good humor. At the swearing-in, when the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, Tani Cantil-Sakauye, asked him to attest that he was taking the position without mental reservation, Mr. Brown paused and the audience laughed.\n\n“Really, no mental reservation,” he said.\n\nMr. Brown has kept a decidedly low profile since his election, making only two significant public appearances and only two appointments. He is now moving into a period where he is to begin spelling out some of those painful choices he has talked about.\n\nOn this day, at least, Mr. Brown seemed intent on not making any enemies, promising to impose tough cuts without detailing exactly what may lay ahead, well aware that cuts in programs, or proposed tax increases, would threaten to squander whatever support he enjoys now.\n\nFor example, for all the talk of budget tightening, he said the state needed to do something to take care of public schools that have been battered by years of cuts, a deep concern of Californians.\n\n“Our budget problem is dire, but after years of cutbacks, I am determined to enhance our public schools so our citizens of the future have the skills, the zest and the character to keep California up among the best,” he said.\n\nHe made only elliptical reference to what could be one of his big challenges, should he choose to engage: pushing unions to agree to reductions in pensions and other benefits.\n\n“We will also have to look at our system of pensions and how to ensure that they are transparent and actuarially sound and fair  fair to the workers and fair to the taxpayers,” he said."
