        "text": "SAN DIEGO — As former Gov. Jerry Brown eyes another bid for California’s top job, his political opponents want voters to see him as the lava lamp candidate in the age of Twitter.\n\nBut polls in innovative and forward-thinking California show the 71-year old state attorney general leading the field of contenders vying to succeed Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger next year. So painting Brown as a 1970s-era throwback is a theme uniting Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nSteve Poizner, a Silicon Valley multimillionaire running for the GOP nomination, recently released a tongue-in-cheek statement congratulating Brown on the 40th anniversary of his first election to public office.\n\nIn April 1969, Poizner noted, “Nixon was the newly inaugurated President, John Lennon and Yoko Ono were going strong, people were still using carbon paper, an Apple was something you ate and the Apollo mission had not yet landed on the moon.”\n\nGarry South, a strategist for one of Brown’s Democratic rivals, 41-year old San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, observed Brown’s birthday last week with a message on his Facebook page: “Imagine being born when FDR was president!”\n\nSuch talk has left Brown slightly bemused.\n\n“Listening to them, you’d think ignorance is a virtue,” Brown said. “I’m the guy with new ideas and innovations. The last time there was real creativity in state government was when I was governor.”\n\nBrown hasn’t formally declared his candidacy but isn’t shy about his intentions. He’s raised about $5 million for his Democratic primary battle, where he likely will face Newsom, Lt. Gov. John Garamendi, and perhaps Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has not ruled out a run.\n\nIn an interview, Brown, son of Pat Brown, another two-term former California governor, said his interest in recapturing the governorship is far from a “back to the future” vanity quest.\n\nJust 36 when he was first elected in 1974, Brown’s initial incarnation as governor seemed the quintessence of California cool.\n\nDuring two terms in office, Brown championed environmental protection, the development of high speed rail and was nicknamed “Governor Moonbeam” by Chicago columnist Mike Royko for proposing California deploy a communications satellite into space. Royko retracted the nickname years later.\n\nA former Jesuit seminarian, Brown famously romanced singer Linda Ronstadt, studied Buddhism in Japan and ministered to the ill with Mother Teresa in India. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, 1980 and 1992.\n\n“California has been lurching from one governor to the next, and the crises seem to deepen rather than resolve,” Brown said. “The state’s most successful governors have been innovators, not ideologues or people just pigeonholed into one partisan box.”\n\nViewed as a visionary by his admirers and eccentric by skeptics, Brown won’t be easily cast as yesterday’s news, analysts said.\n\n“He was so young, so well-known, and so much in the public eye when he first became governor, Jerry Brown doesn’t seem at all as if he is a member of John McCain’s generation,” said Ethan Rarick, author of “California Rising,” a biography of Pat Brown. “Since then, Jerry’s reinvented himself so many times that in many ways, he still seems cutting edge.”\n\nBrown served two years as chairman of the California Democratic Party and hosted a radio talk show in the mid-1990s before becoming mayor of Oakland, a gritty city across the bay from San Francisco that has struggled with drugs and crime. Elected in 1998, he partnered with business interests to redevelop downtown Oakland and claimed a drop in the city’s crime rate, which helped fuel his successful run for attorney general in 2006.\n\nMany Republicans scoff at Brown’s crime-fighting credentials, saying he has used the attorney general’s office primarily to position himself to run for governor again.\n\n“Jerry Brown loves the limelight, he loves running for office. His priorities seem bent on making him popular with Democrat primary voters but not being effective when actually doing the job,” state Republican Vice Chairman Tom Del Becarro said.\n\nBrown has embraced technology, recently posting his mother’s favorite banana cake recipe to his Facebook page. His longtime strategist is Joe Trippi, who helped propel Howard Dean’s insurgent 2004 presidential campaign through robust Internet fundraising.\n\nBrown is quick to reject comparisons to Hillary Clinton, whose presidential bid foundered last year after rival Barack Obama framed her candidacy as a relic of the past. “Newsom is trying to make everyone think I’m Hillary, and he’s Obama, but those analogies just don’t work,” Brown said of his Democratic rival.\n\nWith the GOP field shaping up as a big money showdown between Poizner and another multimillionaire, former eBay executive Meg Whitman, Brown said only a battle-scarred Democrat “well-known to voters” will be able to withstand Republican attacks.\n\nFor his part, Poizner said he expects to do battle with Brown in the 2010 general election.\n\n“California is going to be looking forward to the future, looking for a leader who can bring California completely into the 21st century,” he said. “I was trying to draw contrasts between the two of us and get voters thinking early.”"
