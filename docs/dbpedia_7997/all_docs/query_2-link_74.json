        "meta_description": "Critics have condemned California’s legislature as seriously dysfunctional and have blamed direct democracy, especially the initiative. This paper examines the use of direct democracy in California since 1978, focusing on the use of direct democracy by political conservatives to limit revenue and otherwise restrict state government, and on the use of the initiative by other interest groups to protect state-funded programs. These actions have constrained the ability of the legislature to govern and have shifted power from elected legislators to organized interest groups and the governor.",

        "text": "1Over the past several decades, critics from across the political spectrum have condemned California’s legislature as seriously dysfunctional – unable to pass budgets on time and unable to resolve chronic and increasing deficits. The culprit, according to one argument, is direct democracy – the initiative, referendum, and recall, especially the initiative. This essay examines that argument by looking at the use of these political procedures since the 1970s and the ways that direct democratic procedures have contributed to legislative dysfunction, then evaluates the likelihood that recent changes in election procedures (approved through direct democracy) will resolve the dysfunction, and concludes with proposals to restore the ability of the legislature to legislate.\n\n“Government by Initiative” and Legislative Gridlock\n\n4Figure 1 summarizes California’s experience with statewide initiatives and referenda. Between 1912 and 1939, there was considerable interest in using these tools, leading to 134 initiatives or referenda, averaging nearly five per year. Then the numbers dropped, reaching a low point in the 1960s, with only nine statewide propositions.\n\nDirect Democracy and Partisan Mobilization\n\n17Wilson hoped to run for president in 1996. To do that, he had to win reelection by a large margin in 1994. That meant mobilizing the Republican political base. Wilson focused his reelection campaign on illegal immigration, which he claimed was endangering the state due of the cost of educating and providing social services to illegal immigrants.\n\n19Prop 187 illustrates how initiatives can be used, in conjunction with an electoral campaign by a candidate, to mobilize particular groups of voters. In 1994, Wilson used Prop 187 to mobilize California voters who were anxious about the increasing presence of immigrants, especially Spanish-speaking immigrants. The success of Prop 187 in getting votes from African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos also exemplifies a “wedge issue.” Wilson used Prop 187 to drive a wedge into the Democrats’ voter base, with the intent of splitting off some Democratic voters. In the short-run, he secured reelection even though federal courts quickly invalidated most of the proposition. In the long run, Wilson’s strategy backfired, as it led many Latino immigrants to become voters – and to vote for the Democrats, who had opposed Prop 187.\n\nThe Recall as Partisan Weapon\n\nGoverning by Initiative: The Governorships of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown\n\nUsing Direct Democracy to Change the Political Ground Rules\n\n33The 2012 elections involve major changes in the political ground rules, changes claimed by their advocates as ways to challenge the intense partisanship that has long characterized the legislature. Redistricting in 1981, 1991, and 2001 created districts that nearly all had a reliable majority for one party, so the real election was typically the primary. One consequence seems to have been that legislators from both parties became more partisan, because candidates needed to appeal only to their party’s base and not to moderates or independents. (This is not unique to California. Similar redistricting takes place in most states. Across the country, the past few decades have seen a growth in hyperpartisanship, and frequently a reduction in civility. Non-competitive districts have been only one contributing factor to this development.)\n\n39Taken together, these two new election laws represent interesting experiments in reducing intense legislative partisanship. Only the outcome of the 2012 elections and the behavior of state legislators in the 2013 legislative session and after will indicate if the experiment proves successful. However, the basic assumption behind both changes is that legislative dysfunction results primarily from hyperpartisanship, and neither change addresses the many constraints on the legislature created by direct democracy. The legislature will still be tightly constrained by the various initiatives that mandate expenditures, restrict taxation, or otherwise remove policy decisions from the legislative arena.\n\nWhat’s To Be Done?\n\n40While these election procedures may produce a more moderate legislature, they seem unlikely by themselves to alter the dispiriting chronicle of legislative dysfunction just presented. Is it possible to restore the legislature’s ability to legislate without doing away with direct democracy? Here are my suggestions, some of which appear in direct democracy procedures in other states or in various proposals that have appeared in California in recent years:\n\n41- Increase the number of signatures required for a recall to that of most other states with recall procedures;\n\n- Require that any initiative mandating spending must include a new tax to fund the spending and that any initiative restricting state revenues must specify the programs to be reduced or eliminated because of the restriction of revenues;\n\n- Permit the legislature to amend initiatives after a year or two, subject to the referendum;\n\n- Require that any proposition mandating an extraordinary majority for governmental action must be passed by the same majority;\n\n- Repeal the two-thirds majority requirement for increasing taxes;\n\n- Limit campaign contributions to registered voters in California;\n\n- Return to party primaries;\n\n- Eliminate term limits.\n\n42These changes would at least begin to restore the legislature’s ability to legislate. And, if voters could reasonably expect parties to deliver on their campaign promises and would not re-elect those who fail to do so, these changes might promote more responsible parties."
