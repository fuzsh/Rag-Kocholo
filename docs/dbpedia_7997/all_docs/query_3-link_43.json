        "text": "Full Name: Edmund Gerald Brown\n\nProfession: Governor of California\n\nBiography: Jerry Brown served as the 34th and 39th Governor of California, making him the longest-serving governor in the history of the state. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown's political career spans several decades and is marked by a mix of progressive and pragmatic policies.\n\nBefore his gubernatorial terms, Brown held various political positions. He was California's Secretary of State from 1971 to 1975 and was elected Governor of California for the first time in 1975, serving until 1983. During this period, Brown gained a reputation for his alternative, sometimes unconventional, political views, which earned him the nickname \"Governor Moonbeam.\"\n\nBrown ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States three times, in 1976, 1980, and 1992, but was unsuccessful. His bids were characterized by his vocal advocacy for political reform, environmental issues, and opposition to the status quo.\n\nAfter his first two terms as governor, Brown continued his political career in various roles. He traveled and worked abroad in Mother Teresa's hospice in Calcutta, India, and studied Zen Buddhism in Japan.\n\nIn 1989, he became chairman of the California Democratic Party, and in 1998, he was elected mayor of Oakland, California, serving for two terms until 2007. During his time as mayor, Brown focused on urban development, education reform, and crime reduction. In 2007, Brown was elected California's Attorney General, focusing on issues related to climate change, the environment, and combating human trafficking.\n\nIn 2010, Brown was elected Governor of California again, taking over from Arnold Schwarzenegger, serving from 2011 to 2019. This term was marked by efforts to address California's financial crisis, climate change, and criminal justice reform. He helped to turn around California's budget deficit, implementing tax increases and budget cuts.\n\nBrown left the gubernatorial office in 2019, succeeded by Gavin Newsom.\n\nBorn: April 7, 1938\n\nBirthplace: San Francisco, California, USA\n\nAge: 86 years old"
