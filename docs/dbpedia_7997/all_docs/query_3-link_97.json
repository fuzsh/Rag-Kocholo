        "text": "BARRING some divine intervention, it appears as though Jerry Brown will be returning to Sacramento as attorney general, which raises\n\nthis question: Is the town big enough for Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger?\n\nUntil Schwarzenegger came along, Brown had been the most colorfully unpredictable and glamorous governor in memory — a young man who dated singer Linda Ronstadt, ran for something every two years, was the cover boy for national magazines, slept on a mattress in a Spartan apartment and was fond of uttering quotable, if often inscrutable, one-liners.\n\nDullness permeated the Capitol for 20 years after Brown left the governorship in 1983 — especially after the building’s only remaining character, Willie Brown, departed in 1995 to become mayor of San Francisco. Regardless of what one thinks of George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson and Gray Davis as governors, no one would accuse any of the post-Brown executives of being colorful or, most of the time, even quotable.\n\nBrown’s post-gubernatorial life was characteristically erratic. He ran for president periodically, spent some time in India with Mother Teresa, served as state Democratic Party chairman for a bit, did a stint as a radio talk show host and, for the past eight years, occupied the mayor’s office in Oakland, the city in which he settled after living in Los Angeles and San Francisco. And he’ll be returning to Sacramento, the scene of — depending on one’s view of his previous tenure — his greatest triumphs or his greatest crimes against good governance.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century after Brown’s departure, both he and Sacramento have changed. He’s no longer the boy wonder politician of the 1970s who was hailed in national publications as the Next Big Thing, but 68 years old and looking every bit of it. He’s married now and, he says without apologizing for past actions, wiser, having gone from the governorship and pronouncements about saving the whales to the mayoralty of a very troubled city.\n\nSacramento, meanwhile, is not only a much-larger city, or at least a much-larger urban area, but is no longer the government-dominated city it was when Brown’s father was governor in the 1950s and 1960s and still was when Brown was first elected in 1974.\n\nThe Capitol has changed too, and not just because it now has a terrorist-deterring fence and metal detectors. Term limits and gerrymandered districts have lowered the Legislature’s stature, but the Legislature also has a lot more female and nonwhite legislators, some of whom were not even born when Brown won his first statewide office as secretary of state in 1970. To them, Brown may be just an aging politician, no longer hip, no longer on the cutting edge, no longer glamorous.\n\nThat’s not to say that Brown is washed up. And with Schwarzenegger virtually certain to win re-election this year — by reinventing himself, much as Brown did in 1978, becoming a “born-again tax cutter” after opposing Proposition 13’s tax revolt — the former governor could almost naturally become the opposition’s rallying figure, if he’s willing to play that role.\n\nOf course, Brown could throttle his instincts and adopt a more passive public image, concentrating on the job of attorney general and continuing what has been a cordial, mutually beneficial relationship with Schwarzenegger. It would, however, be disappointing were Brown to end his political career on a whimper, rather than with a bang.\n\nDan Walters is a columnist for The Sacramento Bee."
