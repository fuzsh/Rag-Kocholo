        "text": "After watching Arnold Schwarzenegger being interviewed over the weekend on the “Tom\n\nSullivan Show,” I’ve given up the long-held delusion that Arnold would ride the\n\nwhite horse to the White House. He could well do that, even in President\n\nObama’s administration. But he will bring to that now only a charismatic\n\nnovelty. And the White House already has one: President Obama.\n\nAs Arnold ends his term in November, a strange symmetry is occurring in California.\n\nWhen he first ran for governor, Arnold even got support from the most deeply\n\nconservative of the religious right in the heartland because he was a Hollywood\n\nhottie and suggested Ronald Reagan, the California governor who was also a\n\nHollywood star. Reagan was followed by Jerry Brown as governor. What is odd\n\nthis time around is that Arnold could well be followed by the same Jerry Brown,\n\nwho is running again.\n\nArnold is a great pitchman and poster boy for California, but is not now and\n\nnever was Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s California, like John Wayne’s, was more Texas\n\nthan California as we know California to be today. That is, Reagan’s was the\n\nsagebrush “Hey, Cisco”-“Hey, Pancho” ’50s TV California that spread west and\n\nnorth from the Hollywood desert before Janis Joplin, before the Summer of Love,\n\nbefore the vast and worldwide cultural awakening in the mid-’60s to which even\n\nWoodstock was a lawyer’s impoverished imitation.\n\nReagan was governor of California during this awakening, from 1967 to 1975. He\n\nwas the traditionalist’s hedge against it. He soon brought the hedge to\n\nWashington, D.C. But in that time California as we know it today was born,\n\npossibly at the Fillmore with the crying, howling heart and animal chords of “four\n\ngentlemen and one great, great broad,” as Janis and her band was introduced to\n\nthe big world in the summer of 1967.\n\nThis was the California that Reagan rose in opposition to, but this is a door\n\nthat would not be closed. It is the California that Jerry Brown inherited when\n\nhe went to the California governorship in 1975. This was always Jerry Brown’s\n\nCalifornia, and it is today.\n\nJanis’s cry from the heart was a birth pain, but it is a birth that has not\n\ncompletely gone full term. It is a strange fate indeed that Brown follows\n\nArnold — Arnold, the Reagan knockoff — as he followed Reagan himself.\n\nCalifornia may be down now, but it is not out. Possibly it is about to finally\n\nbe born.\n\nIn the masterful “Mad Men,” set in 1963, California is described as “new and\n\nshining” while New York is a “city in decline.” Those who worked on Madison\n\nAvenue, as I did decades ago, know how the story ends: The talent moves to\n\nCalifornia. This is the new America in the center of the new world rising\n\nbetween East and West, superseding the old paradigm of North vs. South (and\n\nTexas). It is revealed in living arrangements. A former soap opera actress (Jon\n\nHamm’s landlady) has a house in L.A. but keeps an apartment in New York. While\n\ncelebrity President Bill Clinton owns a house in Westchester County in New York,\n\nbut keeps an apartment in LA.\n\nOne is light, one is shadow, but the light has shifted: California is now in\n\nthe light while New York, like Clinton, falls to rust and shadow. America’s\n\nedge today facing the world rising is California and it is not Schwarzenegger’s\n\nCalifornia or Reagan’s California, but Jerry Brown’s."
