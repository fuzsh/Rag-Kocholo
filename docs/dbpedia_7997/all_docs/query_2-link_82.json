        "text": "Speaker 1 (00:00):\n\nGovernor Schwarzenegger, welcome back to Meet the Press.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (00:03):\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:04):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (00:28):\n\nSpeaker 1 (02:57):\n\nAnd why was it important to you to write this book now?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (03:03):\n\nSpeaker 1 (04:34):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (04:57):\n\nSpeaker 1 (07:00):\n\nAnd you realized your speech was an asset. Exactly what you’re saying, that you could achieve that speaking what other people would perceive to be a machine.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (07:08):\n\nSpeaker 1 (08:14):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (08:37):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (09:00):\n\n… and do all of that stuff. I said, “As long as I’m above the grass, I want to fight. I want to be hungry, I want to struggle, I want to be useful.” And to me now, this is very important to combine all of my careers together into one and to make this a better world. If it’s motivating people to become more successful, if it is fighting for clean environment, to reduce fossil fuels, the use of fossil fuels, and to reduce pollution, which kills 7 million people, if it is to create a better healthcare, afterschool programs, better education for the kids. All those kind of issues are very important to me, and I just want to improve the world, make it a better place.\n\nSpeaker 1 (09:43):\n\nWell, let’s talk about the state of our world right now. We all witnessed the horrific events that unfolded in Israel. What many people are calling Israel’s 9/11. What was your reaction to seeing the attacks in Israel, Governor.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (09:58):\n\nSpeaker 1 (11:27):\n\nAs a former governor, how would you assess the response by US leadership and Israeli leadership?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (11:38):\n\nThe response, I think everyone is working very hard to figure out how to solve this problem, and how to even find the bodies. I mean, they’re still counting the bodies, they’re still finding… At this music festival, they have almost 300 people that died right there. So I think that response was good. I think it was great that the president has responded and let Israel know that we are 100% behind them. And I feel that it’s very important for us to be supportive of Israel and do everything that we can to defend and help them, to defend them and all of that stuff. But as I said, it is very important also at the same time that we not always go from one conflict to the next, but we start thinking about how does the other side feel and why is this continuing to go on like tha.t and can we solve that, for future generations?\n\nSpeaker 1 (12:39):\n\nAnd of course, this is all happening as the US Congress is in a state of paralysis after kicking out their own speaker of the house. So they couldn’t respond to this crisis if they were asked to do so. And obviously divisions in this country are deeper than we have seen in quite some time. What do you think the state of our democracy is?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (13:03):\n\nSpeaker 1 (14:30):\n\nBecause of the divisions in this country right now, what’s the root of the vulnerability?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (14:35):\n\nSpeaker 1 (15:57):\n\nYou don’t know who that leader is? You don’t see that leader right now?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (15:58):\n\nI couldn’t tell because the Democrats are screaming that it has to be Biden and the Republicans are screaming, has to be Trump and all that stuff. Okay, let that kind of thing play out again, so we know once in all who the people really choose. That’s perfectly fine with me. But we got to think beyond that, because we need a new generation of leaders that are willing to spend as much energy as possible or as much energy as it takes to bring both of the parties together. Because we as a nation are Democrats and Republicans and Independents, and when they all pray together and work together, that’s what our ultimate strengths comes from. It’s like a football team that only accepts Democrats or Republicans. You couldn’t win like that. Football team has players that doesn’t matter what party they belong to. They work together and they play together and then they try to win.\n\nSpeaker 1 (17:02):\n\nYou write about the importance of working across your aisle, the aisle in your book and you write, quote, “I had to put Democrats resistance to my ideas to the side. My job was to find a way to work with Democrats to pass legislation that helped the citizens of California. That meant compromise.” Governor, why do you think compromise has become a dirty word?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (17:26):\n\nBecause I think there’s no one there that can lead and to make people understand that. I tell you an example, when I go to Washington and lobby for afterschool program money, because every administration always wants to take the money out of the budget, which is normal. So I go there to lobby. How do I lobby? I find six senators from the Democrats, six from the Republicans, asking if we can come together and talk about this\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (18:00):\n\nSpeaker 1 (19:13):\n\nOne of the extraordinary things that we are seeing, though, right now, it’s not just about this lack of bipartisanship, it’s about Republicans, at least in the House of Representatives, not being able to work together, this divide within the Republican Party. How concerned are you and do you think that Republicans should put their ideology aside and, as you say, work together?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (19:36):\n\nSpeaker 1 (20:56):\n\nBecause of these divisions that you talk about in both parties, do you feel an increased pressure to speak out right now, to lend your voice to the conversation? You have obviously chosen specific moments in the wake of January 6th, for example, to speak out. Do you feel that pressure to speak out right now?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (21:15):\n\nSpeaker 1 (22:47):\n\nAnd I read that you hadn’t heard much from the White House. Has that changed?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (22:50):\n\nNo, I haven’t heard much from either side, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not talking, maybe, or they’re moving forward. I don’t know, but I just always let them know, if they need any help, I’ve been there for seven years and I’ve created the most strict environmental laws in the country that have become a model for the rest of the world. We can do it nationwide and it’s easy to do. It’s not a big ask to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1 (23:19):\n\nGiven what you’re saying, do you worry about Republican calls to continue with the idea of drill, baby, drill? We’re hearing that from some of the candidates.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (23:28):\n\nWell, they can drill. You have to drill. You can face reality, drilling is not a negative because I have one choice, and that is … Two choices, actually. If one to drill here or the other one is to go and buy the oil from Saudi Arabia, or from Mexico, from Venezuela, or somewhere else. So at one point or the other, you have to recognize this is the oil that we need because we don’t have yet the alternative, the electric cars, the hydrogen-fueled cars, and all those things. So we have to drill somewhere, I’d rather drill in America than to drill in Venezuela, or in Mexico, or in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSpeaker 1 (24:06):\n\nI want to get your take on the race for the White House, if I can. You’ve been very critical of former President Trump. Is there any candidate in that field who you feel like could bring the type of leadership that’s needed right now?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (24:18):\n\nWell, I don’t think we give these people enough chance because it’s all Trump, Trump, Trump, Biden, Biden, Biden. So these are the things that the press talks about.\n\nSpeaker 1 (24:29):\n\nWho do you think stands out?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (24:30):\n\nWell, I think that Joe Manchin is one of them that I think stands out because he’s a center guy. He comes from an [inaudible 00:24:38] state, but he’s a Democrat. So he knows the challenges and all that, but he’s one of the guys that I think is really a great force, but there’s many others. We just have to give, in general, without endorsing anybody, I think we have to give people a chance to emerge. The political system is set up in such a way right now that Trump is taking the air out of everything and Biden is doing it on the other side. And so it comes down to both of them running, really, for president.\n\nSpeaker 1 (25:14):\n\nYou have said you would run for president if you could. Do you think you would be a better president than any of the candidates running right now?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (25:24):\n\nI think that I have the ability of bringing people together, I have the ability of talking about issues without villainizing the other side, because there’s people that think differently than I do, but they’re not evil. They’re not terrible people. They’re good people that mean well. So therefore, I would say we have to be able to bring people together and let everyone know they are very important to be part of the team for us to be successful.\n\nSpeaker 1 (25:52):\n\nDoes it frustrate you that you can’t run for the nation’s highest office?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (25:56):\n\nNo, because I tell you, I have accomplished everything that I did because of America. So why would I be frustrated and angry about something, the one thing that I can’t do? There’s only one thing that I can’t do in America, which is run for president. Why would I be upset about that? Yeah, I would love to run for president. I would love to have the opportunity to do that and to show America that we can come together and do the kind of things that Ronald Reagan did, but that’s not the case. The case is, the reality is that I can be there to be helpful, to help other people. That is, to me, the most important thing. Like I said in the book, and my book is called Be Useful, I want to be useful to bring Democrats and Republicans together and solve the problems together.\n\nSpeaker 1 (26:47):\n\nI have seen you say that you have no plans to run for the late Senator Feinstein’s Senate seat. Have you ruled it out completely?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (26:54):\n\nNo, no, no. How can I rule it out? I didn’t even think about it. It’s like it’s not there. Look,\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (27:00):\n\nLook, I’m busy now with show business, and so running for any office is not even in the game.\n\nSpeaker 1 (27:08):\n\nPolitics are not in your future at all?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (27:10):\n\nI don’t see it at all because I can see the impact that I have and the way I can talk freely today about politics and about issues without having to worry about, oh, what does my party think when I say that and what does so-and-so say and what do my constituents say? I don’t have to worry about anything. I can say anything that I want, and everything that I say comes from my heart and comes from my concern for America.\n\nSpeaker 1 (27:38):\n\nI have read that you have said that Governor Gavin Newsom, you think it’s obvious that at some point he will likely run for president. Do you think he would be a strong president at some point in the future?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (27:51):\n\nI have no idea. I couldn’t tell you that.\n\nSpeaker 1 (27:54):\n\nBased on his record as Governor of California, based on what you’ve seen?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (27:58):\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that previous governors should never talk about the current governor. You don’t do that, because yes, there is Gray Davis and there’s Jerry Brown and there’s me and there’s Pete Wilson and all discussed that is still alive. We don’t want to go and chime in and attack. If it is Willie Brown, not Willie Brown, but the Jerry Brown, or if it is Newsom, we don’t want to chime in and just say, well, we don’t agree with what he’s doing here. Of course, we would never agree on everything. Doesn’t exist. But the bottom line is, I want him to go and to be successful in California because then California is successful. I want him to be successful if he does anything at a nationwide level. I’m perfectly fine with it. As a matter of fact, I’m fine with it no matter what the party is, because to me what is important is that America is successful, that we are going in the right direction. That’s the most important thing.\n\nSpeaker 1 (29:02):\n\nDo you still feel at home in the Republican party?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (29:04):\n\nAbsolutely. When I go up to Capitol Hill and I meet with my Republican colleagues, I have a great time meeting with them and talking about the environment and talking about the important issues and all that stuff. I don’t look at them as crazies like some people do. There’s some people that are extreme, but there’s no reason to villainize anybody.\n\nSpeaker 1 (29:24):\n\nWhat do you say to them about funding for Ukraine? Is that something you are stressing to them to continue?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (29:28):\n\nI have not talked to them about that.\n\nSpeaker 1 (29:30):\n\nWhat would your message be to them?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (29:32):\n\nSpeaker 1 (31:03):\n\nI just finally want to ask you about your legacy. You were obviously born in Austria in 1947. You have talked about how your father was affiliated with the Nazi party. You did speak out after January sixth. You compared that insurrection to Kristallnacht, The Night of Broken Glass, when Nazis burned synagogues and obviously Jewish businesses and homes. When you think about the future of this country, given your history, what are your biggest concerns?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (31:34):\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:07):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:11):\n\nIt’s up to the people. They can decide that. Because body builders, we’ll say one thing and actors will say something else and people in politics will say something else. I leave this up to the people. My thing is just I want to give back and make this a better country and a better place.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:27):\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:29):\n\nNo, thank you. You did a great job with the interview.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:31):\n\nThank you very much.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:32):\n\n[inaudible 00:33:33].\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:32):\n\nI appreciate you’re sitting for so many questions.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:34):\n\nI feel like I’m sitting here with Tim Russert. It’s unbelievable. What is going on here?\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:38):\n\nThank you.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:39):\n\nOh man, he would be proud of you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:40):\n\nThat’s the nicest thing you could have said to me. Thank you.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:42):\n\nTim Russert will be proud of you.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:43):\n\nThank you, Governor. Thank you.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:43):\n\nI can tell you right now.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:43):\n\nThank you. That means so much to me.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:43):\n\nNo, it’s true.\n\nSpeaker 1 (33:43):\n\nYou have no idea. Thank you.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger (33:45):\n\nYeah, he was a good friend of mine.\n\nSpeaker 2 (33:51):\n\nThanks for watching.
