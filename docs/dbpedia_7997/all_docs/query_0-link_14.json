        "text": "LONG BEACH, Calif.  With less than a week until Election Day, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has become a chunk of kryptonite that the candidates to succeed him lob at each other. But even as the candidates, Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown, scrambled to distance themselves from the governor, they shared a stage with him on Tuesday for the first time this election cycle.\n\nThe event was a panel discussion, titled “Who We Are, Where Are We Going” and moderated by Matt Lauer of NBC’s “Today” show, that was the centerpiece of an annual women’s conference organized by Maria Shriver, Mr. Schwarzenegger’s wife.\n\nThe governor entered to a swell of music after a short video that extolled his time in office. Ms. Whitman  who, like Mr. Schwarzenegger, is a Republican  and Mr. Brown, the Democratic nominee, followed. After perfunctory handshakes, they flanked Mr. Schwarzenegger around a small table.\n\nMr. Schwarzenegger has not endorsed either candidate, but his image has loomed large in recent days. The Brown campaign introduced an advertisement featuring sound bites from Mr. Schwarzenegger spliced with clips of Ms. Whitman making nearly identical remarks. In response, Ms. Whitman said Mr. Brown’s tax strategies and environmental ideas augured more of what the Schwarzenegger administration had been dishing up.\n\nThe conference program also included speeches by Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, as well as talks about “work-life balance” and weight loss.\n\nWhen Mr. Lauer pressed the candidates to “pull all negative ads and replace them with positive ads” in the remaining days of the race, Mr. Schwarzenegger sat back as Mr. Brown pledged to comply and Ms. Whitman smiled at the cheering audience.\n\n“I will say,” Ms. Whitman said after a pause, “the things I have been called in this campaign, it’s not fair to the voters of California.”\n\nMr. Lauer asked for a handshake, a verbal pledge, any clear agreement to his challenge before time ran out on the panel. Mr. Schwarzenegger leaned forward and assumed the role of referee. “Maybe it’s hard to come to an agreement now, in front of an audience,” he said. “I can already see the political spin masters in the back saying, ‘Why did you do that?’ ”\n\nThe three then stood for a photograph, posing with hands stiffly at their sides for several seconds, to a soundtrack of frantic drumming. Mr. Schwarzenegger reached up and gripped Mr. Brown’s and Ms. Whitman’s shoulders, pulling their heads close to his big grin."
