        "text": "Our new California-China Climate Institute report analyzes policies and technologies China should adopt to mitigate agricultural methane mitigation. This report utilizes an integrated analytical framework to (1) understand the factors that are driving methane emissions, (2) reflect regional agricultural contexts and the need for localized policy approaches, and (3) recognize the steps needed to establish a robust MRV system.\n\nDespite strained national relations, US and Chinese cities are forging strong partnerships in the fight against climate change, highlighting inspiring instances of joint work at the subnational level.\n\nTARIFFS DECIDED: The EU has announced additional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles (EVs) manufactured in China, with “individual duties” on BYD, Geely and SAIC of 17.4%, 20% and 38.1%, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe maintenance of open and candid communication between China and the US is “more crucial than ever” and Hong Kong can play a key role in boosting the cooperation efforts of the superpowers’ bay areas, the city’s finance chief has said.\n\nOrganized by the Guangdong Government, the Government of the State of California, Chinese People's for Friendship with Foreign Countries and California China Climate Institute, the first US-China Bay to Bay Dialogue was held in Berkeley, California on May 29 (local time).\n\nThe California-China Climate Institute is hosting a two-day high-level event in Berkeley, California to promote climate action. It's bringing together mayors and other local officials from various parts of China and the United States.\n\nEvent is follow up to Sunnylands talks last November when the world’s two highest carbon emitters agreed to revive a bilateral working group on climate change\n\nNewsom’s trip last year to China bore some fruit today when a group of Chinese officials joined U.S. state and federal leaders to talk climate change at a “U.S.-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action” in Berkeley.\n\nClimate leaders from the United States and China got together on Wednesday in Berkeley, the U.S. state of California, to discuss climate action and progress at the sub-national level.\n\nOfficials from the United States and China gathered on Wednesday in Berkeley, California, putting aside national tensions to focus on a shared challenge: climate change.\n\nThe California-China Climate Institute is hosting a two-day high-level event in Berkeley, California to promote climate action. It’s bringing together mayors and other local officials from various parts of China and the United States.\n\nTop national, state, provincial, and city leaders from across the U.S. and China convened today at the U.S.-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action, where the State of California, China’s National Development and Reform Commission, the California-China Climate Institute, and others announced a series of new actions to advance subnational climate cooperation and progress from the world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nThe White House’s global climate adviser will aim to be tough on Beijing without pushing it too far away.\n\nOn May 8-9, the United States hosted in Washington, D.C., a meeting of the U.S.-China Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which is co-led by Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy John Podesta and PRC Special Envoy for Climate Change Liu Zhenmin and includes relevant officials from the two countries.\n\nThe following press release was published earlier this month by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) and California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). This trip was organized by the California-China Climate Institute, which serves as the secretariat for several California-China climate agreements, and comes on the heels of Governor Gavin Newsom's trip to China, which the Institute also helped plan and support."
