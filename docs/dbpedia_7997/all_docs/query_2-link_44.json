        "text": "May 23, 2024: Scholarship Luncheon with Larry Lee\n\nThe Sacramento Press Club is expanding its annual college scholarship program once again this year! Thanks to your generous support, we are excited to hand out 11 scholarships totaling $59,000 — more than we ever have before — to local students who represent the best of the future of journalism.\n\nPlease join us to celebrate these talented scholarship recipients. The reception will feature a keynote address from Larry Lee, president and publisher of the Observer Media Group, about how local and ethnic media outlets are evolving to ensure independent local journalism continues to thrive. Lee is one of this year’s named scholarship honorees.\n\nApril 24, 2024: What is the Future of Prop 47?\n\nIn 2014, California voters approved Proposition 47, recategorizing some drug and property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. Supporters said it was a necessary correction to a history of overly harsh criminal justice policy in the state. But in the decade since, critics have blamed the law for a rise in shoplifting, among other problems. Now voters may weigh in again in November on a new initiative to roll back elements of Prop 47.\n\nJoin the Sacramento Press Club for a discussion about the impact of Prop 47 on crime in California, whether the law needs to be fixed and how it should be changed. KQED’s Marisa Lagos will moderate a panel featuring:\n\nSacramento County District Attorney Thien Ho\n\nTinisch Hollins, executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice\n\nMagnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice and senior fellow at Public Policy Institute of California\n\nCalifornia Retailers Association President Rachel Michelin\n\nApril 11, 2024: Journalism Awards Dinner\n\nJoin us for our 4th Annual Journalism Awards, where we will announce the winners of our contest honoring the best California politics and policy journalism of 2023. Tickets include a plated dinner and a seat for the awards ceremony, featuring a keynote address from Shane Goldmacher of The New York Times.\n\nJanuary 23, 2024: George Skelton\n\nHe’s covered California politics for six decades, including nine different governorships and a presidency. His “Capitol Journal” column has been a staple of Sacramento since 1993. And, of course, he is one of the longest-running and most generous supporters of the Sacramento Press Club.\n\nSo in conjunction with the 50th anniversary this month of his joining the Los Angeles Times, we are pleased to present a commemorative conversation with George Skelton looking back on his fascinating career. Laurel Rosenhall, the Times’ Sacramento bureau chief, will interview George about his most unforgettable moments (including the time he survived a helicopter crash and received a pin from then-Gov. Pat Brown), his observations on California’s political evolution and his advice for younger journalists.\n\nNovember 17, 2023: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger: The 20th Anniversary Interview\n\nTwo decades ago, California experienced a political earthquake when voters recalled a sitting governor for the first time. The man who emerged from the sprawling field of candidates to replace him was an outsider to Sacramento — a movie star and a Republican who promised to shake up the liberal state Capitol. What followed were seven dramatic years, filled with historic new climate policy and bitter clashes with Democrats over the budget.\n\nNow, on the 20th anniversary of his inauguration, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sits down with the Sacramento Press Club to reflect on his tenure. In a conversation with Carla Marinucci, who covered his governorship for the San Francisco Chronicle, Schwarzenegger will reflect on the wild recall election that brought him to power, his successes and challenges, and his political legacy, including his continuing advocacy against gerrymandering.\n\nAugust 28, 2023: Reining in California’s Rising Health Care Costs\n\nHealth care spending in California is up 30% from 2015. Californians with job-based coverage face higher out-of-pocket costs than ever, with more than half of workers now paying a deductible of $1,000 or more, compared to 6% in 2006.\n\nLast summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to create the Office of Health Care Affordability to combat these rising health care costs. While a handful of other states have similar commissions, California’s has the most regulatory authority. The office will be responsible for analyzing major transactions involving health care entities and enforcing spending targets intended to guarantee affordability. But the effort has not been without controversy.\n\nThe Sacramento Press Club is pleased to bring together a panel of health care industry leaders to assess the progress of the office over the past year. Angela Hart of Kaiser Health News and CalMatters health policy reporter Kristen Hwang will lead a discussion with Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the California Department of Health Care Access and Information; Health Access executive director Anthony Wright; Blue Shield of California President and CEO Paul Markovich; and Elizabeth Mitchell, president and CEO of the Purchaser Business Group on Health.\n\nJuly 12, 2023: A Conversation With New Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas\n\nAfter a protracted battle, two dramatic votes and a lengthy transition, Robert Rivas takes over as the 71st Assemly Speaker next month.\n\nJoin the Sacramento Press Club for a conversation with Rivas about his leadership plans and his priorities for a new era in the California Legislature. Laurel Rosenhall of the Los Angeles Times and Mathew Miranda of The Sacramento Bee will moderate.\n\nRivas, a Democrat from the Central Coast, was raised by his mother and grandparents in Paicines, an hour south of San Jose, and as a child watched his grandfather fight with Cesar Chavez for farmworker rights. He was first elected to the Assembly in 2018 and to this day lives in San Benito County with his wife and daughter.\n\nMay 17, 2023: Scholarship Luncheon\n\nThe Sacramento Press Club expanded its annual college scholarship program this year. We are excited to hand out 11 scholarships totaling $57,000 — more than we ever have before — to local students who represent the best of the future of journalism.\n\nThe reception will also feature a conversation with several local journalists who have won the Pulitzer Prize, the industry’s top award. Hear from The Sacramento Bee cartoonist Jack Ohman, investigative reporter Marjie Lundstrom and former editorial writer Tom Philp about the creative process, the best stories they’ve ever covered and what young journalists should know to succeed.\n\nJoin us on Wednesday, March 29, 2023 at The Mix for our 3rd Annual Journalism Awards Reception. During the reception, we will announce the winners of our contest, honoring the best California politics and policy journalism of 2022. Tickets include two drinks and heavy hors d ‘Oeuvres.\n\nMarch 29, 2023: Sacramento Press Club Journalism Awards\n\nJoin us at The Mix for our 3rd annual journalism awards reception. During the reception, we will announce the winners of our contest, honoring the best California politics and policy journalism of 2022.\n\nPlease join us for a Sacramento Press Club exclusive: an interview with Dan Morain, president of the press club, about his new book, “Kamala’s Way: An American Life,” the first biography of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Morain will be interviewed by Stuart Leavenworth, the California enterprise editor for the Los Angeles Times and former editorial board editor of the Sacramento Bee.\n\nDan Morain has been there from the start of Harris’ career, having first written about her in 1994. In “Kamala’s Way,” he tracks the events that shaped her from early days in Oakland and Berkeley. He also gets the back story about her climb from a deputy district attorney in Alameda County to San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and U.S. senator, as well as the behind-the-scenes campaign she waged to become the first Black, South Asian and female vice president in our nation’s history. He covers the key relationships in her rise to power, such as those with former California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and President Barack Obama.\n\nIn the interview, Morain will also talk about what might surprise readers about Harris, how he thinks her experience in California will impact how she works with President-elect Biden and what he thinks is the common misperception that the public has about her.\n\nNovember 18, 2020: How to Give a Media Interview In the Digital Age\n\nWhen a journalist calls in this fast-moving era of digital communications, it’s more important than ever to respond quickly and effectively to ensure your message is heard. But how to take advantage of the opportunity while also minimizing the risks?\n\nEmmy Award-winning broadcast journalist Kevin Riggs will lead a workshop with former KCRA reporter Pamela Wu on Wednesday, Nov. 18, at noon on our Facebook page. A co-author of the newly published book, “The Insider’s Guide to Media Training: 99 tips to Survive your Interview in the Digital Age,” Riggs will equip you with the knowledge to handle interview requests with confidence and the understanding of what works and what doesn’t. The two will discuss how to:\n\nAnticipate and answer difficult questions\n\nNavigate potential pitfall\n\nUnderstand how reporters think\n\nFind the right voice in crisis situations\n\nCreate compelling quotes and soundbites\n\nKevin Riggs is an Emmy Award-winning journalist with more than three decades of broadcast experience in California. He spent 17 years as an anchor and political reporter for KCRA in Sacramento, where he covered the state Capitol and national political stories, including several national political conventions and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor. He still serves as political analyst for KCRA and is a senior executive with Sacramento-based Randle Communications, where he works with a wide range of business and political clients.\n\nNovember 6, 2020: Making Sense of the 2020 Election Results\n\nCalifornia will still be counting votes three days after election day, but a picture of the results will undoubtedly have begun taken shape. So join the Sacramento Press Club for a conversation with state’s top pollsters, pundits and data crunchers. We’ll analyze the results of we have, who voted and why this COVID election was like no other.\n\nTop political reporters will moderate, including Adam Nagourney, a Los Angeles-based correspondent of The New York Times, Libby Denkman, senior politics reporter for KPCC, and Elex Michaelson, anchor for Fox 11 Los Angeles and host of the statewide political show “The Issue Is.”\n\nPanelists include:\n\nDavid Binder, founder of DB Research and a former pollster for Barack Obama\n\nShakari Byerly, partner and principal researcher with Evitarus\n\nAdissu Demisse, founding principal of 50+1 Strategies who managed Cory Booker’s presidential campaign\n\nPaul Mitchell, election data geek and vice president of Political Data, Inc.\n\nSteve Schmidt, Republican strategist and former adviser to Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nOctober 15, 2020: Proposition 24 Debate\n\nCalifornia voters nearly weighed in on their digital privacy rights two years ago, but proponents pulled the measure from the ballot when the Legislature passed the first major statewide protections in the country. That law, which extended new rights to consumers to control how their personal information online is used and sold, took effect earlier this year.\n\nThe issue is back at the ballot box this November, however. With privacy advocates and business groups waging battle at the Capitol over whether to undo parts of the new law, San Francisco developer Alistair Mactaggar is leading another effort to put those rights into the state constitution where legislators can’t change them — an initiative that critics argue is fundamentally flawed.\n\nPlease join the Sacramento Press Club for a debate over Proposition 24, moderates by the San Francisco Chronicle’s Dustin Gardiner, Politico’s Katy Murphy and the Salinas Californian’s Angelica Cabral. The event, which will be streamed live on the Press Club’s Facebook page, will feature:\n\nJamie Court, president and chairman of the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog, supports Prop 24. Court is a veteran of more than a dozen California ballot initiative campaigns, including 1988’s Proposition 103, which has saved consumers more than $150 billion on their auto insurance over the last three decades, according to a recent report. Court also takes on insurers, banks, technology companies and the oil industry in the Legislature. He is the author of three books, most recently 2010’s “The Progressive’s Guide to Raising Hell .”\n\nJacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, opposes Prop 24. Snow previously served in the San Francisco office of the Federal Trade Commission, where he brought actions against companies for false advertising cases and worked on antitrust cases to preserve competition between California health care providers. As an intellectual property litigator at Orrick, Herrington, & Sutcliffe, Snow was a member of the trial team that won a jury verdict invalidating a series of online-backup patents asserted by a non-practicing entity, Oasis Research. The case was featured on an episode of “This American Life.”\n\nOctober 14, 2020: CNN’s Clarissa Ward\n\nPlease join Clarissa Ward, CNN’s Chief International Correspondent, in conversation about her new book: “On All Fronts: The Education of a Journalist,” an unforgettable story of one extraordinary journalist — and of a changing world.\n\nWard is the recipient of multiple Peabody and Murrow awards, and is a world-renowned conflict reporter. In this strange age of crisis where there is no clear front line, she has moved from one hot zone to the next.\n\nWard will be in conversation with Markos Kounalakis, Ph.D., a visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a former foreign correspondent for NBC and Newsweek, whose foreign affairs columns appear weekly in the McClatchy chain of 30 newspapers from Sacramento to Miami.\n\nOctober 8, 2020: Proposition 16 Debate\n\nCalifornia voters will decide this November whether to reinstate affirmative action in public university admissions, government hiring and contracting. The state previously banned the practice in 1996 when voters passed Proposition 209.\n\nTo help you understand the initiative better, the Sacramento Press Club will host a debate on Proposition 16 moderated by\n\nSpeaking for the initiative are:Eva Paterson, a civil rights advocate and attorney with over 45 years of experience fighting for equality, including as a leading spokesperson against Prop 209. She is president and co-founder of Equal Justice Society.\n\nVincent Pan, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a community-based civil rights organization that works for equality for women, minorities and other disadvantaged groups within the Chinese community. The organization also advocates for immigrant rights, language diversity and racial justice.\n\nSpeaking against the initiative are:\n\nGail Heriot, co-chair of the No on Proposition 16 campaign. She is a professor of law at University of California at San Diego. Heriot was a key co-chair for the Proposition 209 campaign and authored the official argument against Prop 16.\n\nRichard Sander, an economist and distinguished professor of law at UCLA. He has published extensively on the operation and effects of university racial preferences, and on the dynamics of, and possible solutions for, the problem of housing segregation.\n\nOctober 5, 2020: Proposition 15 Debate\n\nCalifornia voters this year are being asked to decide whether to raise property taxes on big businesses. The contentious Proposition 15 would amend the state constitution so that commercial properties are taxed on their market value once every three years.\n\nSuch a change would boost local funding for schools and local government. But critics say now is the wrong time for the biggest tax increase in California history, a move that would drive up rents and the cost of living.\n\nPlease join the Sacramento Press Club for a debate between proponents and opponents of Proposition 15, streaming at 5 p.m. on Oct. 5 at Press Club’s Facebook page. Laura Mahoney of Bloomberg and Doug Sovern of San Francisco’s KCBS will moderate the event.\n\nSpeaking for the initiative are:\n\nDavid Goldberg, vice president of the California Teachers Association, who has spent most of his 20-years as an educator as an elementary bilingual teacher in Los Angeles.

In addition to the outcome of key House races in California and across the country, DiCamillo and Baldassare will break down California voters’ choices on the slate of hot-button ballot initiatives, from a repeal of the 2017 gas tax increase to rent control, daylight savings time and space for farm animals.
