        "text": "SACRAMENTO - It was a matter of life and death in 2015 when California Gov. Jerry Brown pondered an assisted suicide bill granting terminally ill people the right to choose when they die.\n\nAfter much speculation, Brown signed the measure, a victory for \"death with dignity\" advocates and a blow to the Catholic Church, which vigorously opposed it.\n\nBrown, who once considered becoming a priest, added to his signature a five-paragraph statement outlining how he made his decision: He sought contradicting perspectives from the church, families of the terminally ill, his friends and doctors. And he pondered his own existence.\n\nMORE: Colusa County makes way for Jerry Brown, the governor they 'never voted for'\n\n\"I do not know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain. I am certain, however, that it would be a comfort to be able to consider the options afforded by this bill,\" Brown wrote. \"And I wouldn't deny that right to others.\"\n\nBrown, who leaves office Jan. 7, has signed thousands of bills, but this one stands out to Dana Williamson, Brown's cabinet secretary at the time.\n\n\"His ability to articulate his deliberations and why he landed the way he did — to me that's quintessential Jerry Brown,\" she said.\n\nBrown has honed that decision-making style over five decades in public life, including a record 16 years as California's governor, first from 1975 to 1983 and again since 2011.\n\nHe used the spotlight that comes with governing the nation's largest state to mount three unsuccessful bids for president and urge swifter action on climate change — something he'll continue when he leaves office — and he's credited with pulling California out of a financial sinkhole that had observers deeming the state ungovernable when he returned to Sacramento in 2011.\n\nThe son of Gov. Pat Brown, Jerry Brown became governor at 36 and built a reputation as an idealist who eschewed traditional trappings of wealth and power. During his first term, he earned the condescending nickname \"Gov. Moonbeam\" after proposing a state communications satellite.\n\nNow 80, he's still an idealist but one who during the last eight years championed fiscal moderation, a position that sometimes put him at odds with fellow Democrats who wanted more social program spending. Yet Brown's popularity surged as he took the state from a deep budget deficit when he entered office to a surplus and $14.5 billion socked away in a rainy day fund.\n\nHe never gave up on the satellite idea. Last fall, at the end of a global conference on climate change that he organized, he announced California would launch its \"own damn satellite\" to track pollutants.\n\nMORE: Brown says Democrats are likely to spend too much\n\n\"Jerry is an original and always has been,\" said his sister Kathleen Brown, the former state treasurer who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994.\n\nJerry Brown was 20 when his father was elected to the first of two terms in 1958. Politics wasn't his plan — he chose to attend a Jesuit seminary. There he learned the Latin motto: \"Age quod agis,\" or \"Do what you are doing.\" He chafes when asked to reflect on his accomplishments or legacy.\n\n\"Taking pride is not something that I have been trained to pursue,\" Brown said recently at a Sacramento Press Club appearance.\n\nBut the priesthood ultimately wasn't for Brown; he instead got a law degree at Yale and a job at a Los Angeles firm before embarking on his political career by winning a spot on a community college district board of trustees.\n\nBrown leaves the governorship with an unmatchable history in California politics. He was elected secretary of state in 1971 on a platform of transparency and reform, and then governor in 1974. Two years later, Brown was running for president. He lost, but his star continued to rise, powered in part by his relationship with popular singer Linda Ronstadt. The two appeared on the cover of Newsweek magazine under the headline \"The Pop Politics of Jerry Brown.\"\n\nMORE: Things to know about California's new traffic laws\n\nBrown again ran unsuccessfully for president in 1980, with a slogan that reflected the same sensitivities he has today: \"Protect the Earth, serve the people, explore the universe.\"\n\nAfter losing a bid for the U.S. Senate in 1982, he traveled abroad, re-entering politics as California Democratic Party chairman and, in 1992, seeking the presidency for a third time and losing to Bill Clinton. He returned to elected office six years later as Oakland mayor then became state attorney general. In 2011, he won the governorship, and his political comeback was complete.\n\nHe prefers the second two terms to the first.\n\n\"I was more experienced, the people who work with me were more skilled, I had a wonderful wife who was my partner and companion in all this,\" he told The Associated Press in a recent interview. Brown's wife, Anne Gust Brown, is a former Gap executive who friends and advisers say helps Brown execute his ambitious ideas.\n\nThe second time around, Brown more easily persuaded the Legislature and voters to make politically painful decisions such as cutting services or raising taxes on themselves. Lawmakers often overrode his vetoes in the 1970s, but they did not do it once in the last eight years. Unlike his early terms, Brown didn't have his sights set on the presidency.\n\n\"Jerry Brown One was quirky and an interesting governor. Jerry Brown Two is not quirky. Jerry Brown Two is deliberative, and he likes to have it his way,\" said Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen, who served in the Legislature from 1978 to 1987 and returned in 2008.\n\nMORE: Governor reduces murder sentence for another Ventura County homicide\n\nIn the 1970s, Brown brought younger, more diverse voices into state government. He appointed his campaign manager, Tom Quinn, to head the state Air Resources Board and quickly advanced policies to curb air pollution. Quinn cracked down sharply on the auto industry for violating California's vehicle emissions standards, still the nation's strictest and now a target of the Trump administration.\n\nHe won passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the first in the nation to give farmworkers collective bargaining rights. It was hailed as a victory, but its long-term effectiveness remains disputed.\n\nBrown also fell victim to his presidential ambitions, giving lawmakers and voters the impression he was focused elsewhere. In 1978, a property tax revolt led to the passage of a ballot measure that radically changed California's financial picture.\n\nAlthough Brown opposed it, his embrace of the measure once it passed earned him the endorsement of tax crusader Howard Jarvis and reinforced that Brown's idealism was wrapped in political pragmatism.\n\nWhen Brown returned to Sacramento, he turned California's $27 billion deficit into a surplus for his successor; twice successfully pushed tax increases at the ballot box; aggressively advanced California's climate change fighting measures; and reversed course on tough-on-crime measures he adopted in the 1970s. He also championed two major and expensive infrastructure projects — a high-speed train between Los Angeles and San Francisco and giant twin tunnels to reroute the state's water supply — that are mired in lawsuits and may never be completed.\n\nAnd while he's made significant strides on climate change by extending a cap-and-trade program for emissions and expanding access to electric cars, critics fault him for failing to stop new oil drilling.\n\n\"There's a slightly tragic quality to the fact that he couldn't in the end bring himself to change his outlook, because the thing that's marked his career for decades is being able to change his outlook and be kind of ahead of the curve,\" said Bill McKibben, an environmentalist who wrote \"The End of Nature,\" a call to arms against global warming.\n\nCriticism, bad press, political fights — Brown said he will miss it all when he leaves the governor's office and retires to a ranch he built on family land in rural Colusa County.\n\n\"I can't think of a day I haven't enjoyed since I've been governor,\" he said. \"I can't think of one day.\"\n\n50 years in public life: A look at Jerry Brown's career\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown leaves office Jan. 7 after a political career that spanned nearly 50 years. Here's a look at key moments in the life of the state's longest-serving governor :\n\n1938: Edmund Gerald Brown Jr., known as Jerry, is born in San Francisco to Bernice Brown and Edmund Gerald Brown Sr., known as Pat Brown.\n\n1955: Jerry Brown graduates from St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco.\n\n1956: Jerry Brown enrolls at the Jesuit seminary Sacred Heart Novitiate in Los Gatos and plans to become a Catholic priest.\n\n1959: Pat Brown, a Democrat, is elected governor of California.\n\n1960-61: Jerry Brown, instead of becoming a priest, attends the University of California-Berkeley and graduates with a degree in Classics.\n\n1964: Jerry Brown graduates from Yale Law School and goes on to work at a Los Angeles law firm.\n\n1966: Pat Brown loses his run for a third term as governor to Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\n1969: Jerry Brown wins his first political race, becoming a trustee for the Los Angeles Community College District.\n\n1970: Jerry Brown is elected secretary of state on a transparency platform and helped create California's campaign ethics watchdog through a 1974 ballot measure.\n\n1974: Jerry Brown, a Democrat, wins the governorship against Republican Houston Flournoy, the state treasurer, after Reagan decided not to seek a third term. At 36, Brown is California's youngest governor in more than a century.\n\n1976: Jerry Brown announces run for president but loses the Democratic nomination to Jimmy Carter.\n\n1978: Jerry Brown is elected to a second term as California governor; voters pass Proposition 13, a ballot measure that radically reshapes California's tax system.\n\n1980: Jerry Brown again runs for president, but his challenge to Carter is disrupted by Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.\n\n1982: Jerry Brown runs for U.S. Senate but loses to Republican Pete Wilson, the San Diego mayor who later becomes governor.\n\n1983: Jerry Brown's second term as governor ends.\n\n1983-1988: Jerry Brown is out of public office, traveling to Japan to study Zen Buddhism and India to work with Mother Teresa.\n\n1988-1991: Jerry Brown serves as chairman of the California Democratic Party.\n\n1992: Jerry Brown runs for president a third time, losing the Democratic nomination to Bill Clinton in a bitter campaign.\n\n1995: Jerry Brown begins dating Anne Gust, a Gap executive.\n\n1998: Brown is elected mayor of Oakland.\n\n2005: Jerry Brown and Anne Gust are married in a ceremony officiated by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\n2006: Brown is elected attorney general of California, a job his father held before becoming governor.\n\n2010: Brown is re-elected as California governor, defeating Republican Meg Whitman to win a third term. He surpasses Earl Warren's record as the longest-serving California governor.\n\n2014: Brown wins a fourth term as California governor.\n\nJan. 7, 2019: Jerry Brown, 80, will leave office as California's longest-serving and oldest governor.\n\nA look at Jerry Brown's legacy\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown leaves office Jan. 7 after a record four terms as the state's chief executive. After serving from 1975 to 1983, he was re-elected by voters in 2010.\n\nHere's a look at his record:\n\nBUDGET\n\nBrown began his second stint as governor with a $27 billion deficit — an enormous hole in the state's finances that he and lawmakers filled with service cuts, fee increases and temporary income and sales tax increases.\n\nPublic universities lost more than $1 billion, state parks closed and further cuts were made to education, in-home supportive services, welfare and health care for the poor.\n\nBrown persuaded voters in 2012 to increase taxes on the wealthy. The cuts and new taxes, combined with a rebounding economy, helped turn around the state's finances.\n\nBrown created then filled the \"rainy day\" fund, leaving $14.5 billion to help in another recession that he warns is coming. On top of that, the Legislative Analyst's Office predicts a roughly $15 billion surplus heading into the next budget.\n\nBrown's fiscal restraint won him praise from legislative Republicans and occasionally irked fellow Democrats who wanted to invest more in education and programs for the poor.\n\nWATER\n\nAfter leading California through one of its worst droughts, Brown this year signed a law requiring local governments to adopt year-round water conservation standards that critics deem government overreach.\n\nHe championed a 2014 ballot measure authorizing billions for water storage and other projects, and signed groundwater management laws.\n\nBut his ambitious plan to spend $17 billion on two giant tunnels to modernize how California transports water from the north to south won't be completed before Brown leaves office, or possibly ever. It would be an extension of the State Water Project that his father, former Gov. Pat Brown, began during the 1950s and 60s.\n\nEnvironmentalists and Northern California farmers generally oppose it, while water districts in the south are supportive. The state recently withdrew a permit application that was likely to be blocked by a little-known state agency, and Newsom wants to see a scaled-back version of the project.\n\nBrown says it's a necessary update to the state's water distribution and downplays concerns the south would take too much water.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nAt Brown's urging, the Legislature in 2017 passed a fuel tax increase to raise $50 billion over 10 years for road and bridge repairs. Brown successfully beat back a repeal effort on the November 2018 ballot.\n\nBrown has also championed the plan to build a high-speed train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, even as costs balloon. Approved by voters in 2008, the project has nearly doubled in cost and won't be completed until at least 2033, a significant delay from early estimates. Repeated audits have faulted the project's management.\n\nBrown remains steadfast in his defense of the project, saying it will bring California into the modern age of transportation.\n\nHe disputed the state auditor's findings during a recent interview with The Associated Press. His successor, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, wants to scale back the project.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nBrown emerged as a global force in the fight against climate change during his second two terms.\n\nHe championed an extension to California's cap-and-trade program that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was first passed under former Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Amid tense negotiations, Brown's team made a deal that won support from both environment- and business-friendly lawmakers.\n\nBrown also accelerated California's clean energy goals and signed a law setting a target of generating 100 percent of California's electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045.\n\nThe transportation sector remains California's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and Brown pledged to put millions of electric vehicles on the roads.\n\nHe also created a global partnership of states and cities pledging to limit carbon emissions. As President Donald Trump pulled the United States away from international deals, Brown traveled to China and Russia and worked with the United Nations on climate goals.\n\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\nCalifornia dramatically revamped its criminal justice system under Brown's second stint in office, partly due to a federally mandated reduction in its prison population.\n\nDuring Brown's first two terms, he pushed strict sentencing laws that he later said he regretted.\n\nThe second time around, Brown campaigned for a 2016 ballot measure that allows offenders to seek earlier parole hearings and reduces some criminal penalties. Voters also eased sentences for certain crimes including drug use and petty theft, although Brown didn't campaign for that measure.\n\nHe also issued more commutations and pardons than any governor since at least the 1940s."
