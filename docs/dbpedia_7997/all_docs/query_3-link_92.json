        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The State of California has had some pretty famous governors over the years – Ronald Reagan from 1967-1975, Arnold Schwarzenegger from 2003-2011, even Earl Warren from 1943-1953, before he became Chief Justice of the United States. But none of them equaled the tour in office of Jerry Brown.\n\nBrown served a record four terms as governor of California, separated by almost three decades: first from 1975-1983 and then from 2011-2019. He left office the second time around with an approval rating of 51 percent, more than twice as high as Gov. Schwarzenegger towards the end of “the governator’s” final term.\n\nThe former governor, now 84, is the subject of the new documentary Jerry Brown: The Disrupter, which makes its world premiere Thursday night at the San Francisco International Film Festival’s Doc Stories showcase. The documentary directed by award-winning filmmaker Marina Zenovich (Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind) heads from Doc Stories to DOC NYC, for in-person screenings November 13 and 14. We have your first look at the film in the exclusive clip above.\n\n“Jerry Brown is a man ahead of his time,” notes a description of the film. “A natural disrupter, Jerry kickstarted the national debate about climate change and spiraling inequality back in the 1970s… For over five decades Brown has proven his willingness to sacrifice everything – even getting elected – for the causes to which he’s devoted. In this candid and emotionally compelling portrait, Brown opens up about his remarkable fifty-year political career, his singular private life and the lessons learned from a life in the public eye.”\n\nThe documentary includes present-day interviews with Brown, his predecessor Gov. Schwarzenegger, former Gov. Gray Davis, former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, former Treasurer Kathleen Brown (Jerry Brown’s sister), and actor and writer Peter Coyote, former Brown staffers, journalists and others.\n\n“It’s unusual to have a chance to be in this office and then 28 years come back and do essentially the same function, but in a very different context,” Brown comments in the exclusive clip. “The problem when I came back was much clearer, much more focused.”\n\nZenovich has known Brown for decades. The director’s father, the late California Courts of Appeal Justice George Zenovich, served in the California Senate from 1971-1979, overlapping for part of that time with Brown’s first stint as governor. Before the senate, the elder Zenovich served in the California State Assembly. In an interview with the San Francisco Standard, the filmmaker said her longstanding relationship with Brown allowed her to access “a more playful side” to the former governor. “It’s a funnier side. It’s a more truthful side.”\n\nIn a director’s statement, Zenovich noted, “I’ve always wanted to make a film about Jerry Brown. I know him both as a political figure and as a layered, complex human. I want people to hear Jerry’s hard-won truths about politics and public life – and about where he thinks America is heading.”\n\nBrown was never known as the most patient person when it came to interacting with the media. The Standard cites a couple of examples in the film where the ex-guv swatted away questions from Zenovich. But, then again, the filmmaker is used to dealing with flinty characters – she asked tough questions of disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong for her 2020 ESPN documentary Lance.\n\nCuriously, a certain brusqueness was part of Brown’s appeal.\n\n“I think one of the things that made him so effective in his second tour as governor,” observes one expert in the film, “was that he remained what he’d always been – the un-politician’s politician. And that persona was A, authentic to him and B, had come to seem like something very precious in American life and people reacted very well to that.”\n\nBrown was an atypical Democrat – liberal on social policies but fiscally stingy. As CNBC noted in a 2018 report shortly before Brown left office, “…[H]e will also be remembered for bringing the state back from the brink of financial disaster. California had the lowest rated credit among the 50 states starting in early 2009 and it continued into 2010… To restore the state’s fiscal footing, Brown made cuts to programs and services. He slashed his own office staff by 25 percent, and pushed for voters to approve a mix of sales and state income tax extensions.”\n\nJerry Brown: The Disrupter is produced by Zenovich, Laura Michalchyshyn and P.G. Morgan. The documentary is an acquisition title.\n\nWatch the exclusive clip above."
