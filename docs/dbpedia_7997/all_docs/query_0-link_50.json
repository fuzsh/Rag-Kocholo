        "text": "Former Governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown honored for solar leadership during celebration at Buchanan High School in Clovis\n\nFRESNO, Calif. — Former Governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown and other local elected officials joined local high school students, business leaders and workers, renewable energy advocates, and community leaders to celebrate achieving one million solar roofs across California.\n\nIn 2006, then-Governor Schwarzenegger signed the Million Solar Roofs Initiative into law, which set a goal of building one million solar energy systems on homes, schools, farms, and businesses throughout the state. In 2019, the idea that once made international headlines for its “wow factor” is now a reality.\n\n“California is leading the way to a clean energy future,” said Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. “13 years ago, we set a huge goal: to build a million solar roofs in our state by 2019. Republicans and Democrats came together behind a policy that would be successful years after we all left office—it wouldn’t be ready for our re-election campaigns—because we understood that big, worthwhile goals were more important than politics. Today, we celebrate the vision and the hardworking Californians that made a million solar roofs a reality.\"\n\nAs they celebrated the one million solar roofs milestone, solar advocates kept their focus on the future with a call for one million solar-charged batteries by 2025. With today’s batteries, homeowners and businesses can store solar energy for use after sundown or during a blackout. This smooths out prices, takes pressure off the electric grid, and gives consumers a degree of independence previously unheard of.\n\n“Governor Schwarzenegger had real vision when he set this audacious goal back in 2006 and it took real determination to achieve it,” said Governor Brown. “This is a major milestone, but don’t get too comfortable, we have a long way to go to decarbonize. Let’s get to work.”\n\nThe benefits of the Million Solar Roofs Initiative exceeded expectations. The initiative’s goal was to build 3 gigawatts (GW) of rooftop solar throughout the state. The program met its goal in 2015, ahead of schedule, and the market has continued to grow. Today, California consumers have installed nearly 9 gigawatts of local solar energy, three-fold the original goal, thanks to the successful transformation brought about by the Million Solar Roofs Initiative launched in 2006 with Senate Bill 1, authored by former state senator Kevin Murray (D-Culver City).\n\n“This shows policy makers and the public that with regard to climate change we can swing for the fences with a big idea and get the desired results,” said former Senator Kevin Murray, author of SB 1.\n\nThose 9 gigawatts of solar energy—the size equivalent of six large natural gas power plants—generate more than 13 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity each year avoiding 22 million tons of CO2, 16,000 tons of smog-forming pollutants, over 350 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and bypassing expensive and aging utility infrastructure.\n\n“Solar energy is one of the most impactful and tangible ways to solve climate change at scale and at speed,” said Dan Jacobson state director of Environment California. “As we strive to meet the state’s 100% clean energy goals, we need solar energy and energy storage technologies on every available rooftop and in every available garage. We are off to the races with today’s celebration of building a million solar roofs but there’s no time to lose.”\n\nThe Million Solar Roofs Initiative was also the catalyst for significant job growth in an industry that supports hundreds of local small businesses and over 77,000 jobs—more people than employed in the state’s five largest utilities combined. Jobs are found in every region of the state from Kern County to Crescent City.\n\n“I am a Kern County local boy where growing up there were two job opportunities: farming and oil drilling,” said Troy Carroll, former oil industry worker now operations manager at CED Greentech, a solar equipment distribution company in Bakersfield. “A few years ago, facing the ups and downs of the oil business, I was looking for a more steady and promising job to support my four kids and keep me close to home. I found that job in solar. This is the future.”\n\nCalifornia’s sunny Central Valley is playing an outsized role in the state’s solar success story. Cities like Fresno, Bakersfield, Clovis, Visalia, Madera, Hanford, Tulare, Merced, and Porterville rank in the top tenth-percentile of California cities by the number of solar roofs—all of them outperforming their per-capita population rankings. Clovis, for example, is the state’s 60th most populous city but holds the 6th highest number of solar roofs at 10,259—more than San Francisco, Oakland, and Long Beach.\n\n“We did it! We built a million solar homes, farms, and schools,“ said Bernadette Del Chiaro, Executive Director of the California Solar and Storage Association. “Not long ago, solar energy had a reputation of being only for backwoods hippies and Malibu millionaires, but thanks to the vision of our leaders, the ingenuity of our business community, and a million forward-thinking consumers, we’ve transformed solar into a mainstream energy resource where everyone from low-income renters in San Diego to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley are making it an everyday household appliance.”\n\nDuring the celebration, local high school students, solar workers, and environmental activists presented Governor Schwarzenegger with an award for his role as a champion for solar energy and climate activism. Governor Jerry Brown and Senator Kevin Murray were also presented with awards for their key roles in reaching this goal. Buchanan High School utilizes solar and storage for its operations and its Clean Energy Academy is educating the next generation of solar installers and designers.\n\n“We are excited to help celebrate a solar milestone in California by hosting the Million Solar Roofs event at Buchanan High School, one of our 42 locations in Clovis Unified benefiting from solar energy,” said Eimear O’Farrell, Ed.D., Superintendent of Clovis Unified School District. “Solar power is allowing our district to save millions in energy costs that can now be directly devoted to educating our students.”\n\nDIVERSE GROUP SOLAR SUPPORTERS REACT:\n\n“I went solar to help lower my monthly utility costs. I see it as an investment for the future and an investment for my family. We as Californians should do our part in helping reduce our carbon footprint. The state government should help promote and enable our communities to transition to going solar. Global warming is a fact and every person in this great state can help promote and reduce the dependency on public utilities. Going solar is logical and it doesn't pollute, it uses the sun to help produce and harness free energy. Being a Veteran I feel that by going solar I'm still helping to protect the world that we share and live in.”\n\nRamos Torres, rooftop solar user in Madera Ranchos\n\n“There’s no question that California is leading the solar revolution. Today, over a million solar rooftop systems are powering our families, businesses, schools, farms and fire stations with sunshine. As we look ahead to the next million solar roofs, California must do more to ensure rooftop solar is accessible to everyone, by designing specific policies and incentive programs to ensure our disadvantaged and low-income communities realize the full health, economic and resilience benefits of solar energy.”\n\nSusannah Churchill, California Director at Vote Solar\n\n“In just over a decade, over a million Calfornians have harnessed the sun's energy to slash their energy bills and increase their personal freedom. Solar is unstoppable. The only question is this: are our current political leaders just as willing to stand up to the utility monopoly and enable millions more people to power their homes and workplaces with the sun?”\n\nDave Rosenfeld of Solar Rights Alliance, a statewide association of solar users\n\n“TerraVerde applauds the Clovis Unified School District Board and Administration for having the foresight and courage to be a solar leader in the Central Valley and K-12 schools across the State.”\n\nRick Brown, Ph.D., Board Chair of TerraVerde, a consulting firm that works with schools and other government entities on how to invest in clean local energy like solar and energy storage\n\n“As a CSU Fresno alum, a native Angeleno, a former middle school teacher and legislator, I know firsthand about the severe health impacts of air pollution, extreme heat events and climate change. It is the time to join together to dramatically increase our investment and commitment to clean, renewable energy.\"\n\nFormer Senator Fran Pavley, author of California’s Global Warming\n\n“Millions of Californians are driving our transition to clean energy every day. Let’s help improve our century-old energy system by putting individuals and communities at the center of the solution with local, resilient energy choices like home solar and batteries.”\n\nLynn Jurich, CEO at SunRun, the nation’s leading residential solar, storage and energy services company\n\n“This great state has reason to celebrate today reaching 1 million solar rooftops, half the amount installed nationwide. As a leading choice among customers, SunPower is proud to enable the rapid growth of smart, renewable energy solutions and we look forward to meeting or beating the new goal of 1 million solar-charged batteries by 2025.”\n\nTom Werner, SunPower CEO and chairman of the board\n\n“Bold action and vision led to 1 million solar rooftops in California and continued leadership at the state level will help Californians achieve its resilience goals. This framework helped to build a local solar market that now supports more than 75,000 solar workers and $63 billion in private investment. In addition to advocacy on broad California solar policies, SEIA will continue to push for policies that make these types of milestones possible, including an extension to the 30% solar Investment Tax Credit and an end to the harmful solar tariffs.”"
