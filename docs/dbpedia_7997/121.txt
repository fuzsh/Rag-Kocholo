ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER HAS been succeeded as governor of California by veteran Democrat Jerry Brown.

Brown, who was California’s governor before – almost 30 years ago – has vowed to introduce a “tough budget” in an attempt to tackle the state’s budget crisis.

Reuters reports that, in keeping with his message of austerity, Brown served hot dogs at his inaugural lunch.

Brown served as governor for two terms, from 1975 to 1983. He has called for greater spending cuts for California, which has the largest population and worst credit rating in the US. After taking the oath of office, he said: “At this stage in my life, I have not come here to embrace delay and denial.”

The new governor has also pledged to make environmental issues a priority, and aims to bring 20,000 megawatts of energy from renewable sources online by 2020.

Brown said the year ahead would “demand courage and sacrifice” if California was to overcome its fiscal problems, the BBC reports.
