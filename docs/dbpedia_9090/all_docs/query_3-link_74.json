        "text": "These are second proofs, with minor differences to the published version. This essay, delivered as a preliminary paper in Helsinki, was completed while three articles, organized in a specific series on the topic of ethnicity in the Neo-Assyrian empire through the lens of the nisbe, were in course of publication: Fales 2013, Fales 2015, and Fales 2017. It may thus be read as explicitly presenting a bird’s-eye view of the results given in much greater detail therein, although it also offers a number of new additions in the footnotes and the bibliography.\n\nThis article is identical in content to the one published in 2018, The Composition and structure of the Neo-Assyrian Empire: Ethnicity, Language and Identities, in R. Rollinger (Ed.), Conceptualizing Past, Present and Future, Münster 2018, 443-494 (see below here in academia.edu). It was republished \"as is\" in SAAS 29 with no formal intimation, request to, or permission by the author --who is perplexed by this circumstance.\n\nThis is the second of three planned articles on ethnicity in the Assyrian empire, with ethnicity involving the identification of group identities and/or differentiations on the basis of mutual contact, as observed from the protagonists' viewpoint or from that of the surrounding social order, along the Barthian model. On a documentary basis, the Assyrian empire lends itself in a unique manner as observation point for the study of the mechanisms of ethnicity in the ancient Near Eastern context. The article focuses, like the others, on the study of “ethnic-group terms” as identifiers of ethnicity within the Neo-Assyrian period, and specifically on those terms to which the \"gentilic\" suffix (nisbe) was applied. The particular theme chosen for this article regards the ethnic-group term \"Assyrian\" (Aššurāyu and other designations) as utilized in both official (royal) inscriptions and \"everyday\" (or state archival) documents from the Neo-Assyrian empire.\n\nThis is the second of three planned articles on ethnicity in the Assyrian empire, with ethnicity involving the identification of group identities and/or differentiations on the basis of mutual contact, as observed from the protagonists&#39; viewpoint or from that of the surrounding social order, along the Barthian model.

It refers to them as Suryān, which is the Arabic adaptation of the Syriac Suryāyē that has been in use since pre-Islamic times. The chapter contends that the Suryān have been through several phases of identity shift since they abandoned paganism and adopted Christianity during the first and second centuries. The Suryān who converted to Islam eventually identified with the his-tory and culture of the Arabian Peninsula. Their heroes became the Arab figures who transmitted the Islamic scriptures in the formative period of Islam, and the Arab commanders who conquered their lands. However, those who resisted pressure to convert to Islam and survived the subsequent waves of mass murders and the 1915 genocide retained more of their indigenous culture, especially through their liturgical Syriac language and various versions of their Aramaic vernacular. Before the First World War, the majority of those Christians inhabited villages, towns and cities in Mesopotamia, where they lived in self-contained religious communities that were known in the West by their sectarian identities, such as Nestorians, Jacobites and Chaldeans. The paper argues that those sects formed separate resource-sharing groups which in turn generated different identities. In an era of nationalism, their different identities translated into different imagined nations."
