        "text": "After centuries of political turmoil in Babylonia, the Assyrians seized control of the weakened territory in the first centuries of the first millennium BC. However, resistance remained, especially in the south, where Chaldean tribes were in power. It is from there that a strong new dynasty arose, which put an end to Babylonia’s inferior position and made it into the biggest player in the ancient Near East.\n\nThe Neo-Babylonian empire (626-539 BC)\n\nThe biggest part of Nabopolassar‘s reign (626-605 BC, Babylonian name Nabu-apla-usur) was devoted to the establishment of an independent Babylonian state. The first thing to do was to repulse the Assyrian dominance and mark the border between both countries. In doing so, Nabopolassar reversed the power relations between Babylonia and Assyria: now the Assyrians had to fear Babylonian power. Still, they did not cease to fight back, forcing Nabopolassar to enter into an alliance with the Medes and to take down the Assyrian strongholds one by one, until the empire was finally crushed in 609 with the fall of Harran. By the end of Nabopolassar’s reign, the only opponent that was left in the near east, was Egypt, which had come to the aid of the Assyrians – but too late. The Babylonian king sent his son and heir to meet the Egyptian army at Karkemish (605), where the Babylonian army won convincingly, resulting in the deportation of large groups of Egyptians to the Babylonian heartland. When Nabopolassar died of old age, this same son took over the throne and made Babylon the capital of a world empire.\n\nNebuchadnezzar II (605-562, Babylonian name Nabu-kudurru-usur) sought to affirm control in what used to be the Neo-Assyrian territory (with the exception of Anatolia). Especially the regions to the west (the Levant) were heavily exploited by levying tribute and no traces are left of what could be called an integration policy: no Babylonian building activities can be found in the archaeological record outside the Babylonian heartland, and only very few ‘foreigners’ are attested at the Babylonian court. This attitude resulted in rebellions in the annexed regions, certainly in the south of the Levant, where Egyptian influence was high. Thus, the Babylonians were forced to campaign against the revolting cities; most famous is the case of Jerusalem, which rebelled twice under Nebuchadnezzar’s rule: once in 597 BC, when part of the population was deported, and once in 587, when the temple was destroyed. In Babylonian Chronicles, which make short notes on important historical events, we can read:\n\n“In the seventh year [598/597], the 9th month of Kislîmu, the king of Akkad mustered his troops, marched to the Hatti-land, and besieged the city of Judah and on the second day of the 12th month of Addaru he seized the city and captured the king. He appointed there a king of his own choice, received its heavy tribute and sent to Babylon.” (Jerusalem Chronicle, ABC 5)\n\nBecause of this policy of exploitation, huge amounts of richess entered the country. Silver started to loose its value, as we can see in the records of prices, in which inflation is visible. That trend remained for approximately a century. Another result of the influx of wealth, was that the king undertook huge building programs. The Babylon as we know it today, its layout and architecture, stems mainly from this period. Two palaces were built, one inside the city walls neighbouring the temple precinct, another just outside the city walls, which were also fortified. A new processional way to Esagila, the main temple, was constructed, including the magnificent Ishtar gate. In fact, the king portrayed himself as ‘the one who cares for the temple Esagila’ (zanin Esagil), not only by maintaining and erecting temples, but also by participating in the cult, in particular the New Year’s Festival.\n\nNebuchadnezzar’s reign would prove to be the apogee of the Neo-Babylonian empire. In the six years after his death, four kings occupied the throne, the first one of which was Amel-Marduk (562-560 BC), who was killed in a court intrigue. He was succeeded by Neriglissar (560-556 BC, Babylonian name Nergal-shar-usur), the husband of Nebuchadnezzar’s daughter, who was already of old age when he ascended the throne, since he is known as a general in the capture of Jerusalem. Before he died of old age, he conquered part of Cilicia in the west. His son Labashi-Marduk reigned for only two months (april-may 556 BC) before he was killed. Very little is known about this time as it seems that some form of damnatio memoriae took place after his death.\n\nThe last king of the Neo-Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (556-539 BC), who has been described as a genius and a fool. Even though it is generally assumed that he came to power by means of a coup, he stated in his own royal inscriptions that he had no interest in ruling since he was so old. His reign is mainly known from later sources, which show a strong negative bias towards Nabonidus and favour the Persian conquerer Cyrus. Of the seventeen years that he was in charge of the empire, he spent ten years outside of Babylonia: from 552 to 543 he resided in the Arabian oasis of Tema, but it is not entirely clear why. Based on biblical traditions, it has been suggested that he was sick or crazy and could thus not rule; others say that it was for socio-political reasons: Arabia was the only part of the Near East that had not yet been under Mesopotamian control and with the growing importance of caravan trade it was a valuable addition to the empire. The explanation given by Nabonidus himself was that the people of Babylon were sinning, because they were worshipping the wrong god; even though it is contested, Nabonidus seems to have promoted the worship of the moongod Sin, instead of supporting the god of Babylon (and thus the national head of the pantheon) Marduk. Still, this could have been part of the later tradition that put Nabonidus in a bad light.\n\nThe Persian conquest (539-484 BC)\n\nWhile Nabonidus resided in Tema, his son Belshazzar (Babylonian name Bel-shar-usur) acted as regent in Babylon. However, when the Persian threat became too substantial, Nabonidus returned to Babylonia. Nonetheless, the Babylonian monarch stood powerless vis-à-vis the Persian power. The later Persian propaganda claimed that the inhabitants of Babylon opened the gates and welcomed Cyrus (II the Great, 539-530 BC) with open arms. More probable is that the Persians were victorious in one or multiple battles and that the opposition from Babylon was not strong enough to resist. Still, the takeover seems to have gone smoothly, since most officials stayed in office after the Persian conquest.\n\nBabylonia was added to the Persian empire as the province ‘Babylon and across the river’ (pahat Babili u ebir nari); at its head ruled a governor, who at this time was called Gubaru. The king seems to have been rarely present in Babylonia. As part of the empire, the region had to provide to the court. This means that a new stream of trade and workforces flowed from Babylon(ia) to Persia. For this endeavour, new canals were dug or elaborated along both rivers and towards the east. Through Babylonia ran a communication network connecting the eastern to the western parts of the empire.\n\nAlready under Cambyses (II, 529-522 BC) , it is visible that all this took its toll on Babylonian society. It is therefore not surprising that when his brother Bardiya (called Smerdis in Greek sources, 521 BC) made a coup, he obtained the favour of the population by lowering taxes. It is not entirely clear from our -very biased- sources, but there is question of a certain Gaumata, an impersonator who would have killed Bardiya and taken his place, or would have profited from Cambyses’ absence when he was conquering Egypt to pretend to be Bardiya who had already been killed by his brother. This episode of Persian history is very difficult to reconstruct. However it may have been, what is clear is that this pretender to the throne was murdered by Darius I (521-486 BC).\n\nAn important source for the reconstruction of the reign of Darius I is his rock inscription in Behistun. It recounts how under his rule two revolts took place in Babylonia, twice by men who claimed to be descendants of Nabonidus The first one was a Babylonian named Nidinti-Bel, but who called himself Nebuchadnezzar (III), and he was impaled. The second was of Aramean descent but also used the name Nebuchadnezzar (IV) to account for his taking power; he too was killed. It is clear from the contents of the inscription, but merely from its existence (and the circulation of copies) as well, that Darius tried to take firmer control over Babylonia. Involvement in the traditional temple institutions (big economic factors on the Babylonian market) was strengthened, and taxes were raised to an even higher level, resulting in the rise of prices too. A corpus of letters from temple employees to a colleague present at the Persian court shows how they begged him to negotiate for less (fiscal) pressure:\n\n“Look, who is the governor’s messenger? Why haven’t I received a letter from you since you left? Have you simply not posted one? Everyone is prepared to compensate you for your loss. The official in charge of the cash box has withheld the prebendary income of every single man (here), only yours he did not withhold.” (Jursa 2013)\n\nObviously, tensions could not keep rising and soon the situation would turn to the worse for the Babylonians…\n\nThe Long Sixth Century\n\n“This period is characterised by a distinct coherence of the available sources and by an unchanging social and economic framework.” (Jursa 2010)\n\nWe use the term ‘Long Sixth Century’ to refer to the period from 626 to 484 BC, because, even though Babylonia changed from the heart of an empire to a province ruled by foreigners, continuity can be observed in many levels of society as expressed in our sources. There is abundant source material for this period: more than 16000 texts have been published and many more remain unpublished. Two large institutional archives come from the temple Ebabbar in Sippar and the Eanna in Uruk, but additional private archives provide ample material as well. Royal administration is practically lacking, since only a very small corpus of cuneiform texts was found in the excavations of the South Palace at Babylon. It has been suggested that there was a switch to Aramaic which was recorded on perishable materials such as leather, parchment or papyrus. In addition to textual sources, the archaeological evidence is of great help as well and a considerable amount of studies concerning agriculture and other topics has been carried out.\n\nIn the following, I will give you a very concise overview of the socio-economic context in which the historical events described above were set. Important to note is the fact that Assyriologists differentiate between institutional and private players in the Babylonian economy. We consider the temple and the palace to be institutional. General trends of the Babylonian society and economy in the Long Sixth Century are: urbanisation, growing monetisation and labour specialisation.\n\nThe Babylonian temple was first and foremost the place where a god resided with his family and court. In that sense, it functioned in the same way a palace would function: everything was done to maintain the god as well as possible. They – or rather, the statue representing them – had to be fed, clothed and decorated, and the building had to be perfect. A huge mechanism was at work to make that happen: the temple owned fields, a small part of which was cultivated by its own personnel (but expensive!); however, most land was given to tenants, who cultivated it and had to pay rent (Pacht). Often the crop was estimated before the harvest and a date of delivery set, so that cheating was quite impossible. Typical crops were barley and date-palms, which grow well in the salty soil of (southern) Babylonia and underneath which vegetables and onions could be grown (the so-called dual-crop system). Aside from agriculture, there was livestock farming: especially sheep were kept, both for the meat and the wool. Fish was provided by fishers who worked on the sea or with fishing ponds. Some things, e.g. olive oil, were imported from far-away regions (where land could also be owned).\n\nWhen the goods arrived in the temple, the largest part was redistributed to people who would process them. Think of weavers, bakers, butchers, jewellers, carpenters etc. Some products were sold for silver, with which salaries could be paid. Then, finally, the efforts could be brought before the god in the form of offerings. However, not all the personnel could deliver their finished product to the god just like that. There was a specific class of people, who are called “temple enterers” (erib-biti), that was allowed to enter certain parts of the temple. Only very few people were authorised to enter in the presence of the cult-statue. The criteria for being part of this group included physical purity (no imperfections, shaven, deprivation of certain foodstuffs), descent and profession. When the offerings were made (four meals on a normal day), the gods ‘consumed’ them, after which the tables were cleared and the goods distributed to the prebendaries. Prebendaries were people responsible for part of the performance of the daily cult, such as priests, administrators, craftsmen and providers (baker, butcher etc.). A prebend functioned as a movable property and could be inherited, rented, or sold.\n\nAll of these workings were meticulously kept in the administration, resulting in the fact that we are left today with a huge body of information. However, not only the temples have produced large bodies of texts: many sources stem from private archives. In contrast to what is a long-standing belief in our field, the temples were not the sole or main players of the Babylonian economy: entrepreneurs were at the heart of it. A good example is the Egibi-family, the members of which sold, bought and exchanged houses, fields and slaves; were involved in banking activities as creditors and financors of international trade; and founded companies.\n\nFor Babylonia, the Long Sixth Century was a period of economic growth, resulting in increasing prosperity and welfare, both for large-scale institutions and private businesses. However, towards the end of this period, fiscal pressure rose and royal involvement in the temples grew larger, leading to what is known amongst Assyriologists as ‘The End of Archives’.\n\nFurther reading"
