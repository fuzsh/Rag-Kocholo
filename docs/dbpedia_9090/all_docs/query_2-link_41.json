        "text": "Carrhae (Akkadian Harran, Biblical Haran, mod. Harran, SE Turkey), a city of north Mesopotamia about 40 km. (25 mi.) south-west of Edessa, an ancient cult centre of the moon-god Sin. The temple of Sin is first mentioned in a tablet from Mari of about . It was an important provincial capital, trading-city and fortress in the Assyrian empire (the last Assyrian king resided there, (?) bce). The Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus ( ) rebuilt the temple of Sin. A Macedonian military colony under Seleucid rule, it preserved its name in the Hellenized form ‘Carrhae’ (see colonization, hellenistic). It became part of an independent kingdom Osroëne ( ), often under Parthian suzerainty. The Roman general M. Licinius Crassus (1) was defeated by the Parthians near Carrhae in . Carrhae was included in the territory annexed as a result of the eastern wars of M. Aurelius’ co-emperor L. Verus and his subordinate general Avidius Cassius ( ) and issued coins as a Roman city until the reign of Gordian III. Septimus Severus gave it colonial status ( ) (see colonization, roman) and additional titles attest further honours from Caracalla, who was visiting the temple of Sin in when he was assassinated. It was a fortress city, changing hands more than once during the centuries of frontier warfare between Rome and Byzantium and Sassanid Persia. Julianus Apostata sacrificed to Sin in . At the time of its final capture by the Arabs in the city was inhabited jointly by Christians and pagan Sabians.\n\nThe town walls survive, with principal gateways; but most visible remains, except a Christian basilica, are Islamic."
