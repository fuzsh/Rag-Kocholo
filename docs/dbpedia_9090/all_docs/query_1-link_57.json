        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe paper discusses the evidence for the harbors, trading posts, and/or administrative centers called kāru in Neo-Assyrian documentary sources, especially those constructed on the frontiers of the Assyrian empire during the ninth to seventh centuries BC.\n\nNew Assyrian cities on the frontiers were often given names that stress the glory and strength of Assyrian kings and gods. Kār-X, i.e., “Quay of X” (X = a royal/divine name), is one of the main types. Names of this sort, given to cities of administrative significance, were probably chosen to show that the Assyrians were ready to enhance the local economy.\n\nAn exhaustive examination of the evidence relating to cities named Kār-X and those called kāru or bīt-kāri on the western frontiers illustrates the advance of Assyrian colonization and trade control, which eventually spread over the entire region of the eastern Mediterranean. The Assyrian kārus on the frontiers served to secure local trading activities according to agreements between the Assyrian king and local rulers and traders, while representing first and foremost the interest o f the former party.\n\nThe official in charge of the kāru(s), the rab-kāri, appears to have worked as a royal deputy, directly responsible for the revenue of the royal house from two main sources: (1) taxes imposed on merchandise and merchants passing through the trade center(s) under his control, and (2) tribute exacted from countries of vassal status. He thus played a significant role in Assyrian exploitation of economic resources from areas beyond the jurisdiction of the Assyrian provincial government."
