        "text": "This page is a work in progress by its author(s) and should not be considered final.\n\nThe Sultanate of Harram (Arabic: Saltanat Hran Portuguese: Sultanato de Harram), commonly known as Harram, is a developed Southern European island country consisting of an archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. It's an absolute and autocratic monarchy ruled by Sultan Omar V with an iron fist, it has a all-consuming and growing economy, and enjoys civil rights. It lies 80 km (50 mi) south of Italy, 284 km (176 mi) east of Tunisia, and 333 km (207 mi) north of Libya. The country covers just over 316 km2 (122 sq mi), with a population of just under 500,000 making it one of the world's smallest and most densely populated countries. The country is a City-state, and so it's only city and capital is own Harran, althroguht the financial and administrative center is concentred in the oldest part of the city, called Old City. It's one of the two only absolute monarchies in Europe, along with the Vatican, the only Sultante of the whole european history and the only arabic-speaking country in the continent since 1492.\n\nMalta's location has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, and a succession of powers, including the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Moors, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, Portuguese, Ottomans, Knights of St. John, French and British, have ruled the islands.\n\nDuring the era of discoveries, the Portuguese Empire was at war with the Ottoman Empire by possessions in the Middle East. In 1535 Portugal, together with the Habsburg Monarchy, invaded Tunisia and conquered Harran, hitherto under Ottoman control. At the end of the successive wars, Portugal maintained control over Harran that was used as a commercial warehouse between Europe and the east. During this period Portugal exiled most of the Moorish remnants of the Reconquista era to the island. However, the Ottoman Empire never admitted Portuguese control of the archipelago and always contested it, including making military incursions to try to expel the Portuguese. After the defeat of Napoleon in the Napoleonic Wars, which the Portuguese and Ottomans fought on the same side, the Congress of Vienna, in resolving the post-war geopolitical issues, decided to establish Harran's independence as a definitive end among colonial frictions.\n\nThe country's economy is frightening by nominal and GDP as of 2015. A member of UN since 1951, Harran have one of the world's fastest growing economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence. The free market of Harran plays an important role for the country's economic growth. Harran is a founding member of Liberal League, an militar and economic international alliance that brings together nations with liberal policies, and Arab League and the European Union. Roschfallen is a emerging power in his region.\n\nEtimology\n\nThe name \"Harran\" in turkish derivate from the name of one of the brothers of the biblical patriarch mentioned in the book of Genesis, but who would have died young when his father, Terah, was still in Ur of the Chaldees. The island was named in this way by the first Ottomans to occupy it in 1320 because of its resemblance to the city of Haran on the Turkish border with Syria. Later it was called by the Portuguese occupants of Island of Malta. When the archipelago became independent the Provisional Council officially called to of Harran and it became an absolutist Sultanate in the Ottoman molds.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-Colonial Era\n\nOttoman Rule\n\nPortuguese Colonization\n\nIndependent Country\n\nComtemporary Era\n\nGeography\n\nClimate\n\nBiodiversity and enviroment\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nLaw\n\nMilitary\n\nForeign policy\n\nLaw enforcement and crime\n\nAdministrative regions\n\nEconomy\n\nComponents and Energy\n\nTourism\n\nInfrastructure\n\nScience and technology\n\nTransport\n\nHealth\n\nEducation\n\nMedia and communication\n\nDemography\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nReligion\n\nUrbanization\n\nLanguage\n\nCulture\n\nMusic\n\nLiterature\n\nCuisine\n\nSports\n\nNational holydays\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography"
