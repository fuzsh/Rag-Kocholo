        "text": "Harran, ancient city of strategic importance, now a village, in southeastern Turkey. It lies along the Balīkh River, 24 miles (38 km) southeast of Urfa.\n\nThe town was located on the road that ran from Nineveh to Carchemish and was regarded as of considerable importance by the Assyrian kings. Its chief cult in Assyrian times was that of the moon god. It is frequently mentioned in the Bible; Abraham’s family settled there when they left Ur of the Chaldeans (Genesis 11:31–32)."
