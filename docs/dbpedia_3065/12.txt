The Great Gildersleeve

Volume 20

For many listeners, The Great Gildersleeve was a weekly show they would not miss, almost feeling as if the characters were family. They tuned in as Leroy and Marjorie grew up, even getting to be a part of Marjorie and Bronco’s marriage and the birth of their children. Gildy experienced the hilarious and even heartbreaking struggle of life and love. This sort of storytelling gave listeners a connection to The Great Gildersleeve that is still present and effective today.

The Great Gildersleeve took advantage of a device usually reserved for soap operas or movie matinees - serial storylines. Beginning with the Widow Ransom’s pursuit of Gildy, having stories spread over several episodes became somewhat a standard for the show. These events that took up several episodes often revolved around Gildy’s love life and the chaos that ensued, but other things were used as well, such as Gildy running for Mayor and getting fired from his job. In 1948, a baby was left in Gildy’s car, leading to one of the most popular serials within the show.

The Great Gildersleeve also took chances with its format and cast in ways other shows would not. Actress and singer Lillie Randolph played Birdie Lee Coggins, the maid in charge of the Gildersleeve household. While she was written to fit a stereotype early on, writers John Whedon and Sam Moore added dimensions to Birdie that Randolph took to immediately. Birdie proved to be spirited as the show progressed, able to stand toe to toe with Gildersleeve and usually prove smarter than him. She was not afraid to share her thoughts, but always did so in a respectful manner. This made the character appealing to all listeners and crossed racial boundaries others could not.
