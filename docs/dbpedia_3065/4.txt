The radio and film character of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve immortalized Harold Peary, whose voice is distinct in entertainment history, an unusual talent, a vocal-genius and facially, unparalleled with his often petulant and mischievous expressions, adding to him a sincere and gracious smile. Others (Willard Waterman, who replaced Harold in the Gildersleeve radio program resulting from a poor decision by Peary) on radio and television have tried to imitate that guttural to mid-pitched laugh, but those near-do-wells pale in comparison. There are two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame commemorating the work of Harold Peary, for his part in the fields of radio and television.

For this writer, it is not TV or radio but it is the movies of Harold Peary that draw my attention. I cannot pass up any opportunity to see Peary ply the personality of that sweet (way deep down in his soul) avuncular icon, that bilious barker, the bellicose braggart, that bastion of frustration, the gelatinous girthed gadfly, that is the great Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve. I must confess (albeit with much guilt and with some trepidation of written reprisals) that he (Gildersleeve) stands alone as my personal favorite of all comedic characters.

Practically Peary:

Harold (Harrold Pereira de Faria, Harold Perry Faria) Peary was born on July 25, 1908 in San Leandro, California to Jose (Joseph) P. Faria and Maude Focha. Joe Faria was born in Portugal and his wife Maude was born in California to immigrants from Portugal. Joe and Maude had their last name legally changed to Perry; Harold would attend Fremont High School in Oakland,[1] in which city he made quite the name for himself. When Harold Perry received notice that he was heir to an estate in Portugal, with the provision that he change his name back to his ancestral surname of Pereira de Faria, he promptly did. After the settlement of the inheritance he made the non-legal switch to Peary, which he took from North Pole explorer, Admiral Robert Peary.[2] Peary, Harold’s chosen professional name became legal in 1958 when he changed it from Harold Perry Faria. Peary’s predilection for a hobby? Collecting police crime scene photos;[3] a dark pastime for a light and jovial performer.

Peary was a life-long Republican and active in Hollywood in that regard and was a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee. Others that joined Peary in that group were Robert Montgomery, Walt Disney, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Joel McCrea, Randolph Scott, Dick Powell, Robert Taylor, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Pickford, Harriett and Ozzie Nelson, Jeanette MacDonald, Edward Arnold, Walter Pidgeon, William Bendix, Adolphe Menjou, Ginger Rogers and directors Sam Wood and Leo McCarey.[4] Harold Peary not only appeared in two short films, The Shining Future and Road to Victory (one for Canada and the other for the U.S., the U. S. short-subject edited from the Canadian version) that were produced to help the WWII effort but performed on stage for the same cause.[5]

Professionally Peary:

1924 saw the rise of the boy baritone Harold Peary and he was heard on KLX, broadcasting from Oakland, California. His two selections for the program were “When Song is Sweet,” and “Sunrise and You.[6] Peary attended the Fulton Dramatic Stock School of Oakland, under the teaching of actor and Professor Norman Field, who had been a regular at the Fulton Playhouse in Oakland. Peary appeared in “The Charm School” in a supporting role at the Fulton in April of 1925.[7]

In 1926 Peary was available for hire, not only on stage or radio but at any kind of event; he sang at the Oakland Advertising Club gathering which welcomed members of the Los Angeles Advertising Club, and the newest member to Oakland, Ms. Mary Ennis who worked with the Schlesinger store locally.[8] Further, in the late summer of the same year Peary appeared with the “Dalton Brothers,” Kelly, Jack and Pete, helping the vaudevillian trio in musical comedies and specializing in old-time ballads and favorite songs.[9] According to his words, Peary was going to work on The King of Kings, with Cecil B. De Mille in 1926;[10] can he be spotted? Probably not since he was reported to have tried his luck in Los Angeles and was back on vacation in Oakland, within a month of his proclamation of having a part in King of Kings.[11] There was one other report that is of interest regarding Peary doing silent films at the Fox, Christie and Chaplin studios;[12] unfortunately, there are no further references or supporting evidence to this period.

Harold Peary joined the Burke-Maxwell Players at the Casino Theater in 1927, as a character actor; the Casino was located at Foothill Boulevard and Thirty-Fifth Avenue in Oakland.[13] Peary sang again on Oakland radio KZM (call letters changed from KLX) in early January of 1929. Beginning in the spring of 1929 Peary landed a recurring gig on the NBC (San Francisco studio) radio program “Cotton Blossom Minstrels.”[14] Mr. Peary became a continuing performer with NBC radio on different programs often in “negro characterizations.” Indeed, Peary at that point was considered a “black-face” comedian.[15]

Harold J. Peary was living in San Francisco and beginning in 1930 was heard as a regular on Spotlight Review on NBC; often appearing with Captain (Bill) Royle, the duo performing “black face” vocals.[16] Many biographies, list the Peary “laugh” as originating in the late 1930s but actually, Harold Peary was already recognized for that “dirty laugh” in 1931, while working for NBC on the aforesaid program.[17] Much of 1930, 1931 and 1932 Peary spent either in his recurring role on Spotlight Review, or as was the case as often as not, in a variety-show skit heard just one time. Wheatenaville came a calling, another NBC program, with Peary performing several parts on the show; the serial premiered in the last week of September, 1932.[18]

Peary’s talent was varied and in one production, Flying Time, he portrayed Major Fellows, Tony the Wop and Diego Ramierez.”[19] Although, playing three parts was nothing compared to when he portrayed eight characters in one 15-minute broadcast; this on the Tom Mix serial[20] As is now seen (then heard) Peary often played minority parts “Black, Italian, Chinese and Hispanic,” earning the title of dialect-specialist from the press.[21] Prior to his part of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve on the Fibber and Molly McGee show, Peary played the “Chinese Boy” on their program.[22] Of course, being able to speak Spanish and Portuguese fluently helped immensely in the Hispanic roles that came his way, he was one of the most sought after character actors in radio.[23]

In the late 1930s Harold Peary was heard not only in Fibber and Molly McGee but also on, Waterloo Junction, Public Hero No. One, Tom Mix-Ralston Straight Shooters[24] (starring Jack Holden) and It Can Be Done.[25] Peary’s star continued to rise in radio; when he accepted his own program based on Gildersleeve, he gave up five shows that he had been voicing in, including Fibber McGee and Molly, which quintet of regular appearances actually paid more than his starring role of Gildersleeve (available on MP3 DVD).[26] His outrageous popularity on radio would morph into a film career with enormous success as the Great Gildersleeve in eleven different films. In the mid 1950s Peary gained a couple of turns in dramas, albeit small parts; appearing as Leo in, Port of Hell, 1954 and in Wetbacks, 1956 as Juan Ortega.

The rest of Peary’s career was filled with TV appearances on a multiplicity of shows, including his final years doing voice work for television animation characters; the voice of Big Ben, in Rudolph’s Shiny New Year, 1976, and Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July, 1979. Peary also provided the voice of Fenwick Fuddy on Yogi’s Space Race and Budford and the Galloping Ghost, 1978 and 1979 respectively. There were other series for Peary that got him at least a season of work. The CBS program, Willy, the June Havoc comedy which aired in 1954-1955; Harold appeared as Perry Bannister. Another successful show for Peary was Blondie, on NBC, the Arthur Lake, Pamela Britton comedy based on the comic-strip and movies, which also starred Lake. Peary played the part of Herb Woodley for Blondie for this 1957 television production.

Personally Peary:

Harold Peary married dancer Eleanor Virginia (Betty) Jourdaine on May 14, 1929. In the 1940’s Peary and his wife Virginia took care of his nephew and niece;[27] life imitating art, for that is exactly what “Uncle Mort,” better known as Throckmorton Gildersleeve, did. Harold and Betty’s marriage lasted nearly seventeen years to date when their separation was announced in February of 1946.[28] Divorce proceedings were reported in late April, with a property settlement reached[29] and the divorce would have been final within a few weeks (Jourdaine was temporarily residing in Nevada) except Peary announced his engagement to Gloria Holliday, who was a member of his radio program. Betty Jourdaine packed up and went back home to Hollywood and filed the action there in the middle of May, on the grounds of mental cruelty.[30] This divorce would take more than a year from its inception (including the one-year interlocutory period) and would cause much confusion for everyone involved; the divorce was finalized on June 20, 1947.[31]

His second wife was Gloria Holliday (sixteen years younger), a singer and actress, appearing as Bessie on The Great Gildersleeve. The Holliday family formerly lived in the Big Sky State and Gloria was born in Billings; the Holliday’s moving to California in 1932.[32] Harold and Gloria were wed unofficially in a ceremony on July 8, 1946, in Tijuana, Mexico; they’re nuptials were in secret, and not legal. The Peary’s celebrated the birth of their son Harold Jose Faria (in 1958, when their son was twelve he changed his name to, Page Peary) who was born on March 9, 1947, prematurely.[33] The couple then followed up with the official shindig to tie the knot on June 24, 1947 just four days after the dissolution of his marriage to Betty Jourdaine. Holliday and Peary divorced without acrimony in the spring of 1956.

Mr. Peary’s third wife, whom he wed on Valentine’s Day, 1964, was electronic engineer Callie J. Lawson. Ms. Lawson was a resident of Manhattan Beach in California; he as well at the time. Peary was thirteen years Ms. Lawson’s senior;[34] the couple remained married until Callie’s death in 1977. Peary died at the Torrance Memorial Hospital on March 30, 1985, and then his ashes were received by the sea; he was survived by his son Page.[35]

The five film Great Gildersleeve Movie Collection (including Seven Days’ Leave) is available on DVD from the Warner Archive.

At the Tone it Will Be Johnny O’Clock:

Johnny O’Clock is a story that at the beginning has only two characters who have any integrity or could be considered to be on the side of good. These two are both women, sisters in fact, Nancy Hobson, the older sister of the first murder victim of the story, Harriet Hobson; Nancy was played by Evelyn Keyes and Nina Foch appeared as Harriet. This is not to say that by the time the clock strikes twelve that the Hobson siblings are the only people of veracity left standing (or lying in Harriet’s case); it is a plot were any evidence in others of integrity is in question and the virtue is sorely needed in aid by the Hobson girls.

As with any Noir drama, there is much darkness both in the story-line and in the photography; plaudits to each member of the crew is warranted and gladly given. The members of O’Clock’s world are either misshapen, misbehavin’, misconstrued or are being mistreated. Everyone has an angle, each, with the exception of the aforesaid, Hobson sisters, have a loaded agenda, with heights above as their goal. The hero of Johnny O’Clock, a casino operator (a man of many names), has finally come to the point where his time is running out in his present circumstance; he (unlike the audience), just doesn’t yet know it. These various situations like a confluence of streams drive him to a point of desperation.

Lust, love and self-preservation, play a large part in the actions of Johnny O’Clock, who appears to be the typical anti-hero. Yet it is the same strengths that drove O’Clock to serve in WWII, which serve the greater good of Nancy Hobson, and the memory of her younger sister, Harriet Hobson (aptly played by Nina Foch). Harriet is at first thought to have committed suicide but eventually it is discovered that she was murdered; Harriet Hobson was a hatcheck girl (watched over by O’Clock, yet she is one of those classified as mistreated, this at the hands of a Police officer) at the casino in which O’Clock is partners with Guido (pronounced Gedo) Marchettis, portrayed by Thomas Gomez. Ellen Drew imitates the part of Nelle Marchettis, who is ever pursuing, O’Clock, and is openly flirtatious with Johnny, even with hubby Guido present. Inspector Koch (cigar chomping Lee J. Cobb), is tough, rough, by no means a dirty cop, but by no stretch of the imagination, a completely clean and honest police inspector. The final member of those characters central to the story of O’Clock, is Officer Chuck Blayden, boyfriend, intimidator and oft times abuser of Harriet Hobson; Blayden is the epitome of the dirty-cop, out for money and any power he garner.

As Time Goes By With Johnny O’Clock:

Johnny O’Clock follows the Film Noir formula close to the cuff until the end where it diverges into the unexpected territory of the patented Hollywood happy-ending. As Dick Powell and Lee J. Cobb exit the secret room where the final words of the script are played-out, the scene is reminiscent of Casablanca, where Humphry Bogart and Claude Rains began their “beautiful-friendship,” on the tarmac of the airport. The viewer of O’Clock can easily see the restrained respect each of these men have for one another, albeit, a begrudging admiration. These comparisons between Johnny O’Clock and Casablanca may seem forced but the similarities I draw attention to, are mostly directed toward the internal makeup of each of these men. While Rick Blaine and Johnny O’Clock share many of the same weaknesses, they also have common points of valor and honor. Captain Louis Renault and Inspector Koch are both men of opportunity, each Officer with nagging frailties and an obsession of self-importance. Rick and Johnny each run a casino, crossing the lines of criminality often, and each keeps the police close to his vest, or in his pocket, placating them with money, and feeding their egos with beautiful women. Both characters are also noble, which becomes detectible under pressure; this nobility is particularly visible when the needs of an “innocent” demand attention.

Much of the goings-on in Casablanca, happens also in, O’Clock, those peripheral characters that weave in and out of the plot-line at the casino; the leading ladies, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) in, Casablanca, and Nancy Hobson of, Johnny O’Clock, are each women who fall for a harsh man, who yearn and need “someone to watch over” them. Nancy and Ilsa want to do the right thing, but they are not sure how to go about it; the difference between the endings of Casablanca and Johnny O’Clock, is Ilsa flies off leaving Rick behind, while Nancy stays by her man. I do not intend to purport that Johnny O’Clock is a mirror image of Casablanca, nor do I proffer that O’Clock has the same movie-making qualities as Casablanca. My assertion is that the two films offer similar views of awkward friendships developed through adverse circumstances, love that flourishes inopportunely, with an assortment of backstabbing, betrayals and mayhem in general being the substance of their worlds.

The Hours of Johnny O’Clock:

First came the story, and then the production company came on-board; J. E. M. Productions, determined on the property of, Johnny O’Clock, written in 1945, by Milton Holmes. Holmes who brought to the table, O’Clock, was a follow-up to Mr. Lucky (the 1943 starrer for Cary Grant), also penned by Holmes, and Holmes was the third initial in J. E. M.; the other two initials of the production company were, Los Angeles attorney Jerry Geisler and Edward Nealis.[1] For Geisler and Nealis (who provided the financing for, O’Clock) this would be their only involvement in producing a picture, while Holmes would be involved in the production end three more times. Holmes was offered $20,000 for his screenplay from one of the major studios, but turned down the offering, deciding for 20% of the picture’s profits.[2]

Dick Powell signed to play the lead in, Johnny O’Clock, in May of 1946 at the salary of $150,000; and Evelyn Keyes was set as the love interest for, O’Clock in June of ’46.[3] First Choice for the role of, Nancy Hobson, the dame to Powell’s casino operator, O’Clock, was June Allyson, wife of Powell.[4] Allyson was under contract to MGM and they did not see fit to loan her out for the movie.

Evidently, Holmes’ screenplay version of his own story was not the “Deuce coupe” it was supposed to be and director Robert Rossen, who was to be at the helm was also set to write the picture; Rossen was already tapping away at the typewriter keys, adapting the original story by Holmes in April and May of ‘46.[5] Filming was scheduled to begin for, Johnny O’Clock, on July 1, 1946, but the production started one week late on Monday, July 8; principal filming was complete by late September of ’46.[6]

As the previews were being held in the middle of December of ‘46, the adulations began to pour in, this was especially true for Lee J. Cobb and his performance as Inspector Koch.[7] Some reviews were negative, mentioning slow pacing, and a lack of plot, and when criticism was positive, reviews were nearly off the chart in their account of what many now consider O’Clock to be, a Film Noir classic.

While the premiere date is correct, most of the country did not see, O’Clock, until February and later. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was one of the first cities to have a run of, Johnny O’Clock, which started on Wednesday, January 29, 1947.[8] The Advertising campaign in Harrisburg began early, was seen often and used large display ads. Milt Young[9] part of the Columbia Pictures publicity-department made a stop in Harrisburg on January 14, 1947, to promote, O’Clock, the city being one of the select few that hosted the movie prior to the film’s general release.[10]

The Minutes of Johnny O’Clock:

The mother-of-pearl, differing colored poker chips seen in the casino scenes in, Johnny O’Clock, were on loan from producer Edward J. Nealis, who said the set of 1,447 chips, had a face value of $663,945.00; each chip’s value being hand-carved.[11]

In the latter part of July, 1946, Evelyn Keyes eloped with writer director John Huston and were married in Las Vegas; the couple made a quick retreat (three hours) to the Columbia studios for Keyes to continue her shooting schedule. Keyes did not at first meet John, instead on a plane ride, she became acquainted with his father, Walter Huston; elder Huston nary changed the subject from his son for the entirety of the trip with the actress. Evelyn said, she practically fell in love with John Huston before she met him.[12]

One would think that with Dick Powell on set, that no one else would have the impudence to sing but one day of location filming was lost due to some ribbitting warbling, provided by some native bullfrogs. The gathering of amphibians made such a racket for the crew of film-makers, that soon the Lithobates catesbeianus found their way to a new venue, appearing with the film company’s caterer as froglegs.[13]

Real life G. I. Joe, Ira Grosel, who made an appearance in the, Thrill of a Romance, in 1945, was tagged for a small role for Johnny O’Clock. Of Course, Ira Grosel is not a well-remembered name in Hollywood lore, but his chosen silver-screen pseudonym is, that of: Jeff Chandler.[14]

May 12, 1947 saw the, Lux Radio Theater, present, Johnny O’Clock, with Dick Powell, Lee J. Cobb and Evelyn Keyes reprising their film roles, on the live broadcast.[15] As with most of the Lux productions, the acting is top-notch, populated by fine supporting voice talent, and the sound-effects are on target, adding depth and wonderful atmosphere to the show. Of course, the film’s script is truncated for radio, from 96 minutes down to 43; most of the editing was accomplished by utilizing numerous fade-outs throughout the program. This was common for radio adaptations of movies, since most of these radio presentations were confined to an hour or less, but the heart of O’Clock still remains for those who are willing to take their entertainment aurally.

For the discriminating woman the, Johnny o’Clock Beret was available at finer department stores, manufactured in eight colors, with price tag of $1.95.[16] As we see today much of the marketing for films relates to t-shirts and collectables of all kinds, we often forget that this is not a new phenomenon, it is just that most of the items available during the Golden Age of Hollywood were clothing, perfumes and jewelry. Articles offered that were related to film franchises of that era were directed toward adults, and most of that merchandise and its related advertising focused on women.

Johnny O’Clock did well at the box-office, pleasing patrons and should provide an hour-and-a-half of good entertainment for you and yours; O’Clock can be viewed online at archive.org for the fee of, well, it’s on the house, complimentary, if you will. Or, O’Clock can be had as part of a Film Noir compendium from TCM. The selling point for the TCM version is that the film has been restored and remastered. If looking for a stand-alone Johnny O’Clock DVD, you will have to be satisfied with a copy (most likely the same quality as seen on archive.org) from either Jubilee or DVDs Entertainment; I give no advice except, buyer beware, for I have no personal experience with these last two DVD outlets.

Peary’s talent was varied and in one production, Flying Time, he portrayed Major Fellows, Tony the Wop and Diego Ramierez.”[19] Although, playing three parts was nothing compared to when he portrayed eight characters in one 15-minute broadcast; this on the Tom Mix serial[20] As is now seen (then heard) Peary often played minority parts “Black, Italian, Chinese and Hispanic,” earning the title of dialect-specialist from the press.[21] Prior to his part of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve on the Fibber and Molly McGee show, Peary played the “Chinese Boy” on their program.[22] Of course, being able to speak Spanish and Portuguese fluently helped immensely in the Hispanic roles that came his way, he was one of the most sought after character actors in radio.[23]

In the late 1930s Harold Peary was heard not only in Fibber and Molly McGee but also on, Waterloo Junction, Public Hero No. One, Tom Mix-Ralston Straight Shooters[24] (starring Jack Holden) and It Can Be Done.[25] Peary’s star continued to rise in radio; when he accepted his own program based on Gildersleeve, he gave up five shows that he had been voicing in, including Fibber McGee and Molly, which quintet of regular appearances actually paid more than his starring role of Gildersleeve (available on MP3 DVD).[26] His outrageous popularity on radio would morph into a film career with enormous success as the Great Gildersleeve in eleven different films. In the mid 1950s Peary gained a couple of turns in dramas, albeit small parts; appearing as Leo in, Port of Hell, 1954 and in Wetbacks, 1956 as Juan Ortega.

The rest of Peary’s career was filled with TV appearances on a multiplicity of shows, including his final years doing voice work for television animation characters; the voice of Big Ben, in Rudolph’s Shiny New Year, 1976, and Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July, 1979. Peary also provided the voice of Fenwick Fuddy on Yogi’s Space Race and Budford and the Galloping Ghost, 1978 and 1979 respectively. There were other series for Peary that got him at least a season of work. The CBS program, Willy, the June Havoc comedy which aired in 1954-1955; Harold appeared as Perry Bannister. Another successful show for Peary was Blondie, on NBC, the Arthur Lake, Pamela Britton comedy based on the comic-strip and movies, which also starred Lake. Peary played the part of Herb Woodley for Blondie for this 1957 television production.

Personally Peary:

Harold Peary married dancer Eleanor Virginia (Betty) Jourdaine on May 14, 1929. In the 1940’s Peary and his wife Virginia took care of his nephew and niece;[27] life imitating art, for that is exactly what “Uncle Mort,” better known as Throckmorton Gildersleeve, did. Harold and Betty’s marriage lasted nearly seventeen years to date when their separation was announced in February of 1946.[28] Divorce proceedings were reported in late April, with a property settlement reached[29] and the divorce would have been final within a few weeks (Jourdaine was temporarily residing in Nevada) except Peary announced his engagement to Gloria Holliday, who was a member of his radio program. Betty Jourdaine packed up and went back home to Hollywood and filed the action there in the middle of May, on the grounds of mental cruelty.[30] This divorce would take more than a year from its inception (including the one-year interlocutory period) and would cause much confusion for everyone involved; the divorce was finalized on June 20, 1947.[31]

His second wife was Gloria Holliday (sixteen years younger), a singer and actress, appearing as Bessie on The Great Gildersleeve. The Holliday family formerly lived in the Big Sky State and Gloria was born in Billings; the Holliday’s moving to California in 1932.[32] Harold and Gloria were wed unofficially in a ceremony on July 8, 1946, in Tijuana, Mexico; they’re nuptials were in secret, and not legal. The Peary’s celebrated the birth of their son Harold Jose Faria (in 1958, when their son was twelve he changed his name to, Page Peary) who was born on March 9, 1947, prematurely.[33] The couple then followed up with the official shindig to tie the knot on June 24, 1947 just four days after the dissolution of his marriage to Betty Jourdaine. Holliday and Peary divorced without acrimony in the spring of 1956.

Mr. Peary’s third wife, whom he wed on Valentine’s Day, 1964, was electronic engineer Callie J. Lawson. Ms. Lawson was a resident of Manhattan Beach in California; he as well at the time. Peary was thirteen years Ms. Lawson’s senior;[34] the couple remained married until Callie’s death in 1977. Peary died at the Torrance Memorial Hospital on March 30, 1985, and then his ashes were received by the sea; he was survived by his son Page.[35]

Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve immortalized Peary, a voice distinct in entertainment history an unusual talent. Others (Willard Waterman, who replaced Harold in the Gildersleeve radio program resulting from a poor decision by Peary) on radio and television have tried to imitate that guttural to mid-pitched laugh, but those near-do-wells pale in comparison. There are two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame commemorating the work of Harold Peary, for his part in the fields of radio and television.

But, for this reporter, it is not TV or radio but it is the movies of Harold Peary that draw my attention. I cannot pass up any opportunity to see Peary ply the personality of that sweet (way deep down in his soul) avuncular icon, that bilious barker, the bellicose braggart, that bastion of frustration, the gelatinous girthed gadfly, that is the great Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve. I must confess (albeit with much guilt and with some trepidation of written reprisals) that he stands alone as my personal favorite of all comedic characters.

The five film Great Gildersleeve Movie Collection (including Seven Days’ Leave) is available on DVD from the Warner Archive.
