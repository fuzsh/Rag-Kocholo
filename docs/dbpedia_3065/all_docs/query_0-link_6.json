        "text": "AFM analysis: Time-course study of glycoSAM surfaces\n\nMaintaining stable and uniform SAMs is critical, particularly for studies involving long-term storage. However, it is well established that thiol-based SAM surfaces are susceptible to both elemental35 and morphological changes over time.36 We stored our samples under an inert argon environment to limit oxidation and contamination by adventitious hydrocarbon; additionally, samples were kept in the dark to prevent degradation due to UV exposure. As previously described, our XPS results establish the high quality and stability of both our pure and mixed SAMs ( and ). AFM tapping mode imaging provided a means of examining the morphological quality and stability of our surfaces at discrete time points over a prolonged storage period.\n\nThe clusters observed on the aged mixed glycoSAM surfaces on polycrystalline Au substrates led us to examine the nature of the hypothesized phase separation and its time-dependency. First, we sought to confirm the morphological stability and uniformity of bare gold and pure SAMs. Using AFM, we compared the morphology of bare ultraflat gold, pure OEG, and pure sugar (3) samples before and after a 28-day storage period ( ). The overall morphology of the pure samples showed minimal change over four weeks, such as a roughening of the pure OEG samples and the formation of depressions in the pure sugar samples, consistent with aging due to slight oxidation during handling.35d\n\nWe proceeded to examine a mixed glycoSAM surface. Ultraflat gold was incubated in two mixed thiol solutions to form glycoSAMs: ‘low’ sugar (2:3 molar ratio of sugar:OEG) and ‘high’ sugar (4:1 molar ratio of sugar:OEG). Samples imaged by AFM immediately after self-assembly were relatively homogenous, with faint nodules visible in the ‘low’ sugar samples ( , Day 0). When the samples were imaged 24 hours later (Day 1), two distinct patterns emerged: a clustered island-like pattern (‘low’ sugar glycoSAM) and an interconnected continuous pattern (‘high’ sugar glycoSAM). Over time, these features coalesced to reveal two easily distinguishable domains: a “short” domain (i.e., dark areas in the AFM images) and a “tall” domain (i.e., bright areas in the AFM images). In both ‘low’ and ‘high’ sugar glycoSAMs, the tall domain features grew larger in cross-sectional diameter and remained discrete over the 28-day study period. We observed the time-dependent clustering phenomenon repeatedly across many sets of glycoSAM samples of various molar ratios of sugar to OEG (see Figure S4). Images of samples stored for greater than five months were qualitatively similar to those taken of Day 28 samples.\n\nWe assessed the domain areal percent coverage by thresholding and binarizing AFM images. Despite the domain coarsening over the study period, the domain coverage remained stable for both the ‘low’ sugar and ‘high’ sugar mixed glycoSAM surfaces ( ). The tall domain coverage was around 25 to 30 percent for the ‘low’ sugar glycoSAMs and 55 to 60 percent for the ‘high’ sugar glycoSAMs.\n\nOur XPS analysis determined that 1:2 and 2:1 sugar:OEG (33% and 66% sugar) SAMs were qualitatively similar, with stable oxygen, carbon, and sulfur signals over the entire study period. Although the molar ratio of the ‘low’ and ‘high’ sugar samples presented in and (40% and 80% sugar) differ slightly from those used in the XPS analysis, it is reasonable to believe that their elemental composition is also stable. Conversely, the 1:2 sugar:OEG XPS data is directly comparable to the 1:2 sugar:OEG AFM data presented in Figure S4, showing that glycoclusters form without any change in surface elemental composition. The stable areal coverage of the domains and stable elemental composition of the surfaces as measured by XPS indicate that changes in overall surface composition do not explain the observed clustering phenomenon.\n\nLine profiles of AFM images of phase separated samples provide an intuitive perspective into the height of the tall domain features relative to the surrounding short domain ( ). The cross section of a ‘high’ sugar glycoSAM on Day 28 illustrates that the short domain to tall domain height difference (inter-domain height differential,) is about 1.0 to 1.4 nm. This height difference roughly equates to the theoretical height difference between sugar (3) and OEG (2). Factors like tip convolution and variable surface softness in response to tapping make it difficult to measure confidently the “true” height of the tall features relative to the short features. Nevertheless, this evidence – in combination with the proportionality between the molar ratio of sugar during incubation and tall domain coverage – leads us to believe that the clustered tall domain features are primarily sugar thiol and the short domain features are primarily OEG thiol.\n\nAssuming that the tall and short domains correspond to pure sugar and pure OEG, respectively, the domain coverage represents the apparent ratio of immobilized sugar to OEG. Under this assumption, one might expect 40% sugar (2:3 sugar to OEG) and 80% sugar (4:1 sugar to OEG) incubation solutions to result in 40% and 80% tall domain coverage, respectively. However, it is well established that the surface composition of mixed SAMs may differ significantly from the incubation solution composition depending on assembly kinetics.37 The coverage relationship was indeed below identity in our system, with OEG thiol appearing to adsorb somewhat preferentially. Nevertheless, the proportionality between sugar molar ratio during incubation and tall domain percent coverage was replicated in 33% and 75% sugar incubation solutions (data not shown). This supports our belief that the tall domains are primarily sugar thiol and the short domains are primarily OEG thiol.\n\nThe slightly preferential adsorption of OEG thiol is expected based on the principles of collision frequency and steric hindrance. During incubation, the frequency of thiol collision with the gold surface dictates the rate of adsorption, and is inversely related to the mass of the adsorbate.38 Thus, OEG thiols will contact the surface more frequently than the larger sugar thiols, leading to higher-than-expected OEG coverage. Additionally, competitive adsorption favors less sterically hindered molecules,39 further favouring adsorption of OEG thiol over the much bulkier tetrasaccharide-bearing sugar thiol.\n\nWe sought to characterize more rigorously the inter-domain height differential over time. The depth values in flat, 300 nm×300 nm areas (512×512 depth values, each representing many tapping event) on mixed glycoSAMs were plotted as histograms and analyzed. In a perfect binary system, the histogram would be bimodal with little spread about the modes; in reality, tip convolution, surface defects, and mixing at the interface of domains results in a bimodal distribution with overlapping regions.40 Closer examination shows that our system is best described empirically as having three distinct domains: a short domain, a tall domain, and an inter-domain region at the transition between the short and tall domains (Figure S2). Each of these regions produce their own Gaussian-type distribution of tapping event heights, which can be fit globally to estimate the mode of each domain, as has been done by others.41 The fitting procedure allowed us to extract, reproducibly, estimates for the “true” inter-domain height differential (, ). shows that increases over the course of study until reaching a plateau. Interestingly, the ‘high’ sugar glycoSAM stabilizes quickly (~Day 3) while the ‘low’ sugar glycoSAM stabilizes more slowly (~Day 7 to 13). This indicates that clustering kinetics are related to the mole fraction of immobilized sugar, and suggests that the sugar moieties are driving the phenomenon. This is consistent with the coarsening seen in the AFM images in in which the ‘high’ sugar glycoSAM seemed to reach a stable morphology around Day 3, while the ‘low’ sugar glycoSAM reached a stable morphology around Day 13. At Day 28, is not statistically different for the ‘low’ and ‘high’ sugar glycoSAMs (p = 0.22, two-sample t-test; Δ ≈ 1.0 to 1.2 nm). Again, this is consistent with AFM imaging data showing that samples stored for greater than five months (Figure S4) are not noticeably different from Day 28 samples, suggesting that both ‘high’ and ‘low’ sugar glycoSAMs reach an equilibrium state by Day 28."
