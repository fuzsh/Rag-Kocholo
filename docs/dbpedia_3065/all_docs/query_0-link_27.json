ATLANTA. GEORGIA 30334\n\n( 404) 656-3500\n\nSeptember 23, 1976\n\nDear Researcher:\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith a unique reference work entitled Resource Index. This very useful book is a guide to books and articles pertaining to Georgia's natural resources.\n\nI believe it will save thousands of hours of research time and eliminate much duplication of research effort. It should encourage comprehensive approaches to natural resource problems by identifying factors that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nIt is one of the most helpful and valuable of this Department's publications.\n\nSincerely,\n\n~~ --~~Is2 slonere~\n\nJDT:sss\n\nEnclosure\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis book is designed to assist researchers of three types: (1) those who know virtually nothing about Georgia's natural resources; (2) those who know a great deal about one or two resource areas; and (3) those who know a little about all or most resource areas. It is anticipated that those who know a great deal about everything can fend for themselves.\n\nThe scope is therefore wide. Included are not only geology, wildlife, forestry, and other basic resource areas\n\nbut also energy, land use, population growth, and other subjects closely related to natural resources. Every subject\n\nthat could reasonably be included was included. This broadening of coverage, however, brought a proportional\n\ndecrease in potential depth, or detail, within the individual categories since time and manpower were fixed. In\n\nthe trade-off between scope and depth, scope \"won\", but an effort was made to have both.\n\nSome general rules relative to scope and detail were formulated:\n\n1.\n\nWorks pertaining exclusively or chiefly to other states were not included.\n\n2.\n\nWorks of national or international scope not having specific information on Georgia were not\n\nincluded.\n\n3.\n\nGeneral works such as textbooks were not included.\n\n4.\n\nWorks of probable interest only to specialists were not included.\n\n5.\n\nLegal works, editorials, and newspaper stories were not included.\n\n6.\n\nAbstracts were not included.\n\n7.\n\nUnpublished works were not included.\n\n8.\n\nBiographies and autobiographies were not included in the History section.\n\nMost of these rules were violated once or twice. Rule 7 was more frequently overlooked because in several areas unpublished materials provided the only information available.\n\nFollowing are suggestions to the researcher for the most efficient use of this book:\n\nScan the Table of Contents to familiarize yourself with the classification system. Notice that several categories are very closely related to others and some could be merged or otherwise rearranged. For example, GAME AND FISH could be a subsection of either ANIMALS or RECREATION.-\n\nCheck all categories that are closely related to the one in which you are interested. Cross-references have been avoided because the high degree of interrelatedness among the categories would require an excessively complicated cross-reference system.\n\nNotice that two of the first-level categories are geographical in nature (i.e., COAST and HIGHLANDS) and that geographical classifications are used extensively in the lower-level categories.\n\nUse the author index to check for additional sources in a given subject area. Often two similar works by one author may be placed in different categories because of a difference in emphasis.\n\nIn a work of this scope errors of omission are to be expected. All notifications of errors and suggestions for improvement will be appreciated.\n\nv\n\n------\n\nSUBDIVISIONS OF GEORGIA\n\nUsED IN THIS BooK\n\nWILCOX\n\n_;---,-\n\n~- r'>--~~ I TURN<R\n\nO<N HOLL\n\n'--t___r---,l\n\nOE.JeATuR\n\n1 WORTH OOuGHEtTY --{\n\nIr TOrT\n\n~ i_r( \\ ----~(- ir-------,__r-~ COLQUITT\n\n'\n\n)c.oo\"\"\\(\".!\n\n-\n\n-IJ\n\nf\n\n'I\n\n\\\n\n. _j ___)__~,...... . ----rj'--~- 'r\\-\n\n\\ .I L_\n\nCLONCH\n\nI I I ~\"'-----. ! \\\n\nGRAOT 1 .\n\ni WAS THO\n\nl\n\ns\n\n.I BFtOOrt.S , . ) LOWNOE (\n\n,\n\n{\n\n\\ ECHOLS\n\n______ \\\n\n'\n\n' I\n\n.
