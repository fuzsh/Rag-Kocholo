        "text": "Australasian Cinema > films >\n\nRobbery under Arms\n\nRobbery under Arms (Charles MacMahon, 1907) MacMahon's Exquisite Pictures, screenplay, scenario, script Charles MacMahon, from the novel by Rolf Boldrewood, dp Byers Coates, William Duff; Jim Gerald (Warrigal), George Merriman, Lance Vane, William Duff, Arthur Guest, Rhoda Dendron; 5000 ft.\n\nThe story of the young Marston brothers, who are led into a bushranging life by the notorious Captain Starlight, had been popular as a novel and a stage play for many years, and it became a favourite of Australian film producers. It inspired Spencer's Captain Starlight, or Gentleman of the Road (1911), and was re-filmed in 1920 by Kenneth Brampton and in 1957 by the Rank Organisation. It was also frequently proposed as a feature by Raymond Longford and Ken G Hall, but they were hampered by the New South Wales ban on bushranging films after 1912.\n\nA relatively lavish production, Robbery Under Arms ran for over an hour and cost Â£1000. The action was staged by Charles MacMahon in bush locations near Sydney and further afield.
