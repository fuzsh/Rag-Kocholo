        "text": "Directed by Kenneth Brampton (d. 1942)\n\nPremier: Strand and Lyric Theatres, Sydney, 7 November 1920\n\nRobbery Under Arms is a 1920 Australian film directed by Kenneth Brampton and financed by mining magnate Pearson Tewksbury.\n\nKenneth Brampton made it a point to present the story of Captain Starlight in the most realistic surroundings. One scene was filmed at the spot where Clark, a notorious bushranger, held up the Araluen mail, and many other localities once frequented by bushrangers and lawless characters were included.\n\nAppearing in “Robbery Under Arms” are Tien Mogue, Kenneth Brampton, Roy Redgrave, Hilda Dorrington, Ronald Conway and S. A. Fitzgerald\n\nA “copy comprising about three-quarters of the film” was found and combined with already known footage to produce a near-complete version. A five-minute sequence is still missing. This version comes from a videotape released by the New South Wales Department of Education, Sydney in 1984 and was dedicated to the public domain with the provision that is “free to copy. But must not be broadcast on television.”\n\nThis is a silent film, there is no sound in the movie. An audio file containing traditional piano-roll music, similar to what would have been played in theatres during this era, is made available for your use while watching the movie."
