        "text": "Up to this point in film history everything was around 8 minutes long or shorter. The first “feature length“ film was “The Story of the Kelly Gang “ from 1906 followed by this film in 1907. They are both westerns with good hearted outlaws and amazingly, Australian. Neither one is very good but both are important first steps. This one suffers from having equal amounts of film and inter-titles. Everything had to be explained instead of telling the story visually. But hey. Baby steps people. We’re moving closer and closer to Hollywood and movie stars and “film”."
