        "text": "Set in Australia of a 100 years earlier, Robbery under Arms is a well-made straightforward drama. The story, based on a Victorian novel [by Rolf Boldrewood] has Peter Finch as Captain Starlight, a virile, likeable rogue who runs a gang of bushrangers. In search of adventure, Ronald Lewis and David McCallum join the gang which includes their father. When the two attempt to break away and lead honest lives they find that they’ve lost their chance.\n\nJack Lee’s direction splendidly captures the Australian atmosphere. He indulges in no frills. Lee is admirably supported by lenser Harry Waxman who fills the screen with sweeping camerawork, suggesting the vastness of the Australian canvas.\n\nIn the star role, Finch has a comparatively small role but he plays it with a swagger which is highly effective. Good opportunities are given to the brothers, Lewis and McCallum. The distaff side plays second fiddle to the men in this action meller, but Maureen Swanson, in an undeveloped role as a fiery, possessive young woman who sets her amorous sights on Lewis, has a real opportunity."
