        "meta_description": "Background: Milk is considered as one of the most complete foods, consumption of raw milk contained with aflatoxin M1 and antibiotics has raised consumer concerns. The aim of this study was to determine the level of aflatoxin and antibiotic residues in raw milk in Bojnurd, Khorasan province, Iran.   Methods: In this study, 40 samples of raw milk from their distribution centers in the city of Bojnourd, were taken randomly in summer and fall of 2016. Samples were evaluated for aflatoxin and antibiotic residues by ELISA method and Coupons kit respectively. Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations were used to summarize the data. Data was analyzed with SPSS 19.   Results: According to the results, no residues of antibiotics were found in raw milk and the aflatoxin concentrations were between 5.1 and 65 ng per ml and the levels were lower than the Iran standards in all samples.   Conclusion: According to the results, antibiotics residues and aflatoxin M1 levels in raw milk of Bojnoord city are within the acceptable level. However, it is recommended to evaluate these parameters in all seasons.",
