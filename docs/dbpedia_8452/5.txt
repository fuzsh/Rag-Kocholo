Zarangush Valley in Ilam Province is considered as one of the least-known tourist attractions of the region.

The 2-kilometer valley hosts a river within, which is full of water during rain seasons.

Being over 500 meters high, the valley has 12 historical and natural sites, which make the valley a significant national treasure.

A few years ago, following a heavy flood in the valley, pottery vessels from Islamic Golden Age were discovered.
