Skog was a rock band from Bergen, Norway, which formed in the early 1990s and split up at the end of the same decade. The group consisted of Anders Waage Nilsen, Øystein Gjærder Bruvik, Eirik Glambek Bøe and Erlend Øye. The latter two later found success as the duo Kings of Convenience. The band released the EP Tom Tids Tale in 1996, which consisted of four songs, plus a cover song of Joy Division's The Eternal on a compilation. In 2006, Anders Waage Nilsen, Øystein Gjærder Bruvik and Eirik Glambek Bøe got back together to form the band Kommode.
