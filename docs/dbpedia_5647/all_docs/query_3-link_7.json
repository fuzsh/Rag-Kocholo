        "text": "You know that high pitch your voice reaches in the moments before you start to officially panic? Justin Pierre’s vocals thrive in those moments, they live there. Rather than the seconds-long squeal that accompanies the descent into panic mode for the rest of us, he seems to sustain it - preserving that anxiety for whole songs.\n\nThis is what I mean when I say Motion City Soundtrack sounds nervous.\n\nOf course I mean the lyrics - I usually tend to focus solely on the lyrics when I talk about music, prioritizing them over the music itself. But I can’t do that with Motion City. It’s the whole package, a complete sonic and lyrical representation of anxiety. Justin Pierre’s tension-filled yet paradoxically jovial vocals shape the lyrics he wrote (“are you feeling fine? / yes I feel just fine!”) and layer themselves accordingly on top of fast pop-punk rhythms and a moog synthesizer.\n\n“Everything is Alright” is perhaps the song that rocketed Motion City to success, achieving moderately respectable radio play in 2005. The reasons as to why this particular Motion City song caught attention are clear: foot-tapping melodies over head-banging power chords all accompany self-aware lyrics that will make you grit your teeth.\n\n“I don’t think the [phrase] ”tongue-in-cheek“ is correct, but it’s something where the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it’s sort of like giving yourself a pep talk. That’s how I’ve always thought about it. Just the fact that nothing is all right. [Laughs.] You kind of have to look at yourself in the mirror and repeat the words to yourself until one day, eventually, you’re okay.” (x)\n\nIn this same interview, Alt Press refers to “Everything is Alright” as a “gloriously neurotic, yet completely life-affirming pop song” and they could not be more right. When pop punk as a classification for any sort of homogenous genre fails us (and it often does), “gloriously neurotic yet life-affirming” works just as well.\n\nLet’s talk about the video, because we can’t not talk about the video. Pop-punk videos around 2005 started to get more and more oddly conceptual; i’m thinking here of ”Sugar We’re Going Down”, “I Miss You”, “I Write Sins Not Tragedies”. But unlike Fall Out Boy’s odd choice of a deer-human hybrid adaptation of Romeo and Juliet that still makes us scratch our heads wondering what the hell it had to do with that song - Motion City Soundtrack set “Everything Is Alright” within a setting and storyline in complete harmony with the song itself (and I would be remiss to not point out the clear homage to Green Day’s Basket Case, the song that gave birth to pop punk as a mainstream genre).\n\nThe lyrics to “Everything is Alright” are magnificent, if only in their simplicity. Between “’Cause I hate the ocean, theme parks, and airplanes, talking with strangers, waiting in line” and “I’m sick of the things I do when I’m nervous like cleaning the oven or checking my tires / or counting the number of tiles in the ceiling” you witness the minutiae of what it’s like to live nervously.\n\nMore importantly, this song navigates the peaks and valleys of survival and recovery and the mere act of existing inside of your own body when it feels like a neurotic open wound. The irony of screeching “yes I feel just fine!” just before you “head for the hills, the kitchen’s on fire!”\n\nIt’s a conversation with your friends who desperately want to understand but don’t know how to fix you, it’s sitting across from your constructively critical yet understanding therapist at this week’s appointment, it’s the rambling talk you give yourself out loud when you’re alone on your bedroom floor rocking back and forth. It’s the mental game of ping-pong we play with ourselves in a stark white room where the ball hitting one wall sounds like OH TELL ME THAT YOU’RE ALRIGHT and then ricochets off the opposite wall with YEAH, EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT while you’re in the middle, not listening to either one because you’re sitting cross-legged on the floor and you’re tapping your hands on your knees, and you’re smiling and it’s alright, you feel just fine.\n\nMotion City Soundtrack is a pop punk band from Minneapolis comprised of founding members Justin Pierre (lead vocals, guitar, lyrics) and Joshua Cain (lead guitar, backing vocals) as well as Jesse Johnson (keyboards, synth), Matthew Taylor (bass), and Claudio Rivera (percussion). Between the years of 1997 and 2003 they released two EPs leading up to their first self-released full length album I Am the Movie (also in 2003). Their first real mainstream success was found in the release of 2005′s Commit This To Memory; in total, their discography consists of five studio albums, seven EPs, and ten singles. Their most recent album, Panic Stations, was released this month.\n\nSo that’s the necessary history of the band information. I’m not going to go into much more here, as anyone can read wikipedia.\n\nI am, however, going to focus on Justin Pierre for a minute for reasons that, if you have ever had a single conversation with me or read my blog, are going to become very clear.\n\nJustin Courtney Pierre was born and raised in Mahtomedi, Minnesota. He was a skater kid growing up on Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys before turning to indie rock bands like The Weakerthans and the Pixies. Pierre sang and played with the band Slide Coaster in the mid-90s before jumping ship to join Joshua Cain in what would become Motion City Soundtrack. In between this, he made short films.\n\nHe has struggled with alcohol and substance abuse and suffers from severe asthma to the point that he keeps his inhaler on him and uses it on stage during shows. He has thick porkchop sideburns, wild hair that seems to grow straight up and out from his head, and thick black-framed glasses. He hasn’t changed this look since 1997. He is, honestly, one of the most intriguing individuals I have ever come across.\n\nWhen the mosh pit got out of hand at the show I went to in 2008, guys in the pit were pushing and pulling and trampling over girls and Justin Pierre stopped dead in the middle of “Attractive Today” to say “hey, hey okay everyone stop. everyone stop and take a breath and calm the fuck down. If someone is on the ground help them up, don’t be an asshole. Take care of each other.” and then started the song over. I feel more affection for him than I have ever felt for someone who is essentially a total stranger.\n\nThis week I’m going to remind you why you love Motion City Soundtrack. If you missed the boat on them back in the pop punk hey-day, I am going to convince you to start loving them now. Those are my ambitions.\n\nMy plan is not to necessarily go through their discography chronologically but rather to explore and group songs together thematically, cataloged more or less by my own experience of them.\n\nLove this band with me.\n\n(note: this video is not from the concert I am describing in this post, but rather a recent show. I had a recording of this song from my show back in 2008, but lost it in a recent hard drive disaster. However, this particular video is infinitely more important because of the anecdote at the beginning)\n\nI went to my first real concert when I was seventeen. In 2008, the Honda Civic Tour was a traveling emo pop-punk circus comprised of Panic! at the Disco, The Hush Sound, Phantom Planet, and Motion City Soundtrack. In the venn diagram of this line-up, the two circles could be labeled “People who know Pete Wentz” and “Music Belonging to an Inexplicable Genre That We’ve Tentatively Referred to as Pop-Punk”.\n\nMy mother, a baby-boomer whose cd collection included The Beatles’ complete discography and Frank Sinatra’s Greatest Hits and absolutely nothing else, was very long-suffering but ultimately a good sport about driving two teenage girls four hours to Atlanta for a pop punk show. She stayed in the hotel, we stood in line at the doors of the venue for 5 hours. I saw Ryan Ross in a Subway. It was a magical time.\n\nI went to my first real concert when I was seventeen, although my actual first concert experience happened when I was sixteen, when an EF4 tornado ransacked my high school while I was inside it, destroying a century-old building and killing 9 of my classmates. My first actual concert was a benefit concert for my high school, headlined by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. (They were terrible, I didn’t stay.)\n\nI’m disclosing this horrible event because it is trauma. My trauma. And it is directly and viscerally connected to my first real concert when I was seventeen. I realize this is an introduction to me rather than an introduction to the band, but I’ve always preferred to get to music through the people who love it.\n\nTeenagers turn to music in search of understanding. Angry teenagers turn to punk music because it screams just like they do. Fucked up, angry, sad, traumatized nervous teenagers like yours truly turned to pop punk because it’s utterly disconnected from the clash of its own nature - the melting pot of two seemingly incongruous genres.\n\nWhenever I’m trying to convince someone to listen to Motion City Soundtrack, I struggle to explain why they should. Motion City is not my favorite band; they weren’t even the band I went to see at that concert - I was there for Panic. I knew maybe two or three of their songs before they started their performance. I don’t listen to them every day, or even every month. Ultimately, I always come back around to the same thing:\n\nMotion City Soundtrack sounds nervous.\n\nSonically, lyrically, vocally - Motion City reeks of anxiety and nerves. Songs to listen to while your hands shake.\n\nI was seventeen at my first concert and the year before I had come closer to the feeling of impending unavoidable death than any child should. I was seventeen and weighed down by PTSD and anxiety and my hands shook almost every day until I graduated (they still shake). The thing about trauma of the near-death-experience variety that no one really talks about is you live so much of the rest of your life in those moments you thought with 100% certainty you were going to die. Your heart rate never really comes down, you never stop grasping for cover. You think it’s going to be okay and that you’ve survived, but you’re never really sure.\n\nI was seventeen and Justin Pierre walked out on stage with his shock therapy hair and his early-2000s emo black frame glasses and the keyboards started up and he sang\n\nI believe that I can, overcome this and beat everything in the end -\n\nBut I choose to abuse for the time being,\n\nmaybe I’ll win, but for now I’ve decided to die\n\nand kids were screaming and jumping and pushing and yelling FOR NOW I’VE DECIDED TO DIE and we laughed and it started raining.\n\nA huge thanks to Hendrik, for putting up with me and allowing me to write all of these posts. It was probably nothing to him, but it meant the world to me.\n\nYou can read over all the posts chronologically here. (If you’re interested, you should also check out the replies to all of the posts).\n\nHere’s a playlist to all the songs I mentioned this week.\n\nHere’s a playlist to all the discography Erlend and Eirik have ever been involved with (not including live shows and covers).\n\nHere’s a list of my favorite quotes from their interviews, with sources.\n\nHere’s where you can talk to me, about literally anything: my Tumblr, my email, my Twitter.\n\nYou can find Kings of Convenience on Facebook, and through their website.\n\nImagine this: we’re good friends. You’ve been listening to me rant about my favorite band, sometimes in a very precise manner, sometimes incoherently. I have to go, I haven’t finished writing all my homework or writing any of the letters I promised to send out a month ago. We hug. We say goodbye.\n\nYou watch me walk towards my car. I drop my keys, but pick them up quickly and get in. A minute later, I’m waving to you.\n\nYou feel unsettled. You think you just learned something deeply intimate about me: you’re not sure what.\n\nIt starts to rain. You think that’s very fitting. You stay there, thinking, listening to your breathing.\n\nYou want to call me. You almost do.\n\nI’ll see her again, you think. We’ll meet again."
