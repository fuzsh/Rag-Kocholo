        "text": "Motion City Soundtrack is a pop punk band from Minneapolis comprised of founding members Justin Pierre (lead vocals, guitar, lyrics) and Joshua Cain (lead guitar, backing vocals) as well as Jesse Johnson (keyboards, synth), Matthew Taylor (bass), and Claudio Rivera (percussion). Between the years of 1997 and 2003 they released two EPs leading up to their first self-released full length album I Am the Movie (also in 2003). Their first real mainstream success was found in the release of 2005′s Commit This To Memory; in total, their discography consists of five studio albums, seven EPs, and ten singles. Their most recent album, Panic Stations, was released this month.\n\nSo that’s the necessary history of the band information. I’m not going to go into much more here, as anyone can read wikipedia.\n\nI am, however, going to focus on Justin Pierre for a minute for reasons that, if you have ever had a single conversation with me or read my blog, are going to become very clear.\n\nJustin Courtney Pierre was born and raised in Mahtomedi, Minnesota. He was a skater kid growing up on Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys before turning to indie rock bands like The Weakerthans and the Pixies. Pierre sang and played with the band Slide Coaster in the mid-90s before jumping ship to join Joshua Cain in what would become Motion City Soundtrack. In between this, he made short films.\n\nHe has struggled with alcohol and substance abuse and suffers from severe asthma to the point that he keeps his inhaler on him and uses it on stage during shows. He has thick porkchop sideburns, wild hair that seems to grow straight up and out from his head, and thick black-framed glasses. He hasn’t changed this look since 1997. He is, honestly, one of the most intriguing individuals I have ever come across.\n\nWhen the mosh pit got out of hand at the show I went to in 2008, guys in the pit were pushing and pulling and trampling over girls and Justin Pierre stopped dead in the middle of “Attractive Today” to say “hey, hey okay everyone stop. everyone stop and take a breath and calm the fuck down. If someone is on the ground help them up, don’t be an asshole. Take care of each other.” and then started the song over. I feel more affection for him than I have ever felt for someone who is essentially a total stranger.\n\nThis week I’m going to remind you why you love Motion City Soundtrack. If you missed the boat on them back in the pop punk hey-day, I am going to convince you to start loving them now. Those are my ambitions.\n\nMy plan is not to necessarily go through their discography chronologically but rather to explore and group songs together thematically, cataloged more or less by my own experience of them."
