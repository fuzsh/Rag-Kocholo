        "text": "Kommode is a project by Eirik Glambek Bøe (Kings of Convenience) and Øystein Gjærder Bruvik. 'Fight or Flight or Dance All Night' is the first dazzling single taken from the debut album 'Analog Dance Music' on Brilliance Records. Analog dance music is music that arises when you can't help but notice that you live in amazing times and that the opportunities laid out before you are greater than those enjoyed by any previous generation. Unlike pop music, where every song is three minutes long and has a bridge and a chorus, ADM lets the band play on if the groove is good and the harmonies are intriguing. ADM is about played instruments, so that every time a pattern is repeated, everything is slightly different. An electronic signal is a mathematical representation of a sound, allowing the exact same note to be repeated several times during a song. An analog signal is, well, analog to what it signalises, and whether it's a drum beat or guitar riff, every element of a song is a performance. ADM is about musicians and a lot of studio hours to get a good take! ADM allows any rhythm that's appealing and danceable, whether it's house, samba, rock or whatever. There are no rules. The limitations are whatever a band is capable of playing with the instruments at hand."
