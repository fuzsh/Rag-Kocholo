The group consisted of Anders Waage Nilsen, Øystein Gjærder Bruvik, Eirik Glambek Bøe and Erlend Øye. The latter two later found success as the duo Kings of Convenience. The band released in 1996 the EP Tom Tids Tale, which consisted of four songs, plus a cover song of Joy Division's The Eternal on a compilation. In 2006, Anders Waage Nilsen, Øystein Gjærder Bruvik and Eirik Glambek Bøe got back together to form the band Kommode.\n\nErlend Øye (bass and vocals)\n\nEirik Glambek Bøe (guitar)\n\nØystein Gjærder Bruvik (guitar)\n\nAnders Waage Nilsen (drums)\n\n1996 – Tom Tids Tale\n\n1997 – VV.AA. – Balance.
