Kommode’s members are Anders Waage Nilsen, Øystein Gjærder Bruvik and Eirik, founded in 2006. They’ve only released four songs, and it’s unknown whether there will be another album.

I think this is my proudest accomplishment this month: I’ve figured out a way to get into the academic building of my school. New College is tiny, and none of the buildings have more than three stories here. So I sneak in before the doors automatically lock at 6 PM, and just stay inside. When I need to leave, I fold up sheets of paper to prevent the door from locking.

And it’s beautiful. I can see the sun setting, people walking back and forth from the bay, and the trees, which almost makes me forget it’s Florida.

But I can’t stay in there forever. It doesn’t matter how much work I put in or how many people I see pass by. It’s worthless without experiences.

So I pack up and come down. I start walking. It’s not solitude: solitude is intentional. It’s loneliness, one person looking for another. Looking for intimacy.

Like the rest of us are.
