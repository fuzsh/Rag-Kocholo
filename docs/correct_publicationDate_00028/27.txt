Michael Shea (3 July 1946-16 February 2014) was an American author who wrote in the horror, fantasy and science fiction genres. A recipient of multiple awards, he won two World Fantasy Awards, and was nominated for a Hugo award, two Nebula Awards, and the British Fantasy Society's August Derleth Award. Possessed of a life-long interest in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, Shea wrote several stories within the setting, and two volumes of these were collected and edited by Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi. His works have also been favourably compared to those of Lord Dunsany and Clark Ashton Smith.

Much of Shea's Lovecraftian work is set in his home town of Los Angeles, California.
