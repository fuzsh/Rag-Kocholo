        "text": "I just learned this afternoon of the passing of Tom Sumeragi, who played an incredibly important role in the ultimate success of Blue Ribbon Sports, then Nike and then Nike Japan. Sumeragi-san was responsible for the General Commodities business for the Portland office of Nissho Iwai, a Japan-based trading company that provided critically important financial support for Blue Ribbon Sports starting in early 1971. I had the honor and good fortune about a decade ago to interview Sumeragi and Phil Knight, and one of the first things I learned was that Sumeragi had come to the Portland office only a few days before Knight's first visit to Nissho Iwai. Knight told me he had been turned down by several Portland-based banks and he needed to find a new source of funding, which was how he'd learned of Japanese trading companies. Sumeragi explained to me that among other things, a trading company invested money in small businesses to help them grow. And even though they would meticulously review these businesses before investing in them, only a tiny percentage of small companies ever became successful. He admitted that Blue Ribbon Sports intrigued him, and after meeting Knight and other BRS employees, Sumeragi said he \"bought into their dream to become the top footwear brand in the US.\" It would be several years later that Knight would find out exactly how Sumeragi helped BRS survive. Unbeknownst to Knight and his colleagues (and to Nissho executives) Sumeragi began sliding outstanding invoices into his desk drawer. Why? As Knight wrote in his memoir, 'Shoe Dog': \"Sumeragi explained that he'd been worried about us, that he'd tried to help us manage our credit problems by hiding Nissho's invoices in a drawer. He'd held them back, not sent them on through his accounting people, until he felt we had enough cash to pay them.\" When Nissho Iwai learned what Sumeragi had been doing, Tadayuki Ito, financial manager of the Portland office, asked Sumeragi why he would do such a thing? Knight quoted Sumeragi's reply: 'Because I think Blue Ribbon could be a great success, maybe $20 million account.' He explained that he'd become friends with Steve Prefontaine and Bill Bowerman and gone to Blazers games with Knight, and even helped fill orders at the BRS warehouse. 'Nike is my business child. Always it is nice to see one's business child grow.' [The full, harrowing and amazing story is recounted in the chapter '1975' in 'Shoe Dog,' which begins on page 257 in the hardbound printing.] Rest in peace, Sumeragi-san. 6453 ALUMNI"
