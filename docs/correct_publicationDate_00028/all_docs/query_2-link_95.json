While it is possible to pitch most most well-known media outlets (TV, radio, podcasts, print, online) yourself, a well-known book publicist who’s successfully getting exposure with such outlets in the past is going to have an easier time. For the very reason authors want one of the best literary agents to pitch the biggest and most powerful book publishers, authors can benefit from a powerful book publicist to get major media. Like the best literary agents, book publicists know what to say and how to say it—concisely.\n\nDo authors need to hire book publicists? – Best Literary Agents Article Series\n\nNo.\n\nI simply wrote this article is because some of my coaching clients who’ve scheduled an Introductory Coaching Call with me and then gone on to get agents (click here to see Author Success Stories) have asked me if they should hire publicists. Some of those authors have gotten some of the best literary agents, while other have gotten up-and-coming agents.\n\nDuring my nine years as an author coach—and my time as a literary agent prior to that—I never had a situation in which a publisher required or expected an author to hire a publicist. However, some authors do so, to sell more books and increase the odds they’ll be able to publish more books. In other words, the more successful your first book is, the easier it is to get a book deal for the next book(s). Even if you have one of the best literary agents–and a great publisher who does a lot to promote your book–your literary agent and publisher aren’t going to do everything possible to promote your book.\n\nThat means an author can/should do some things as well. And, if an author hires a private publicist, the author should coordinate his or her efforts with their publisher, so they don’t duplicate their work. Some publishers do a little to promote a book; others do a lot. Some publishers have an in-house team dedicated to publicity; others have just one person. And, still others, especially small publishers, have just one person who works on publicity part-time, while other book publishers outsource most or all of their publicity efforts.\n\nAre there different types of book publicists? – Best Literary Agents Article Series\n\nYes.\n\nIn two respects.\n\nFirst, book publicists are like the best literary agents in that some are highly specialized, whereas others are generalists. In other words, some book publicists have experience helping all types of authors get exposure for their book in all types of media (TV, radio, podcasts, print, online), while others only work with certain types of book in certain types of media outlets. Depending on the unique nature of your book, the promotional efforts of your publisher, and other factors, it might make sense for you to promote you book in different ways than someone else. You might have more success and a greater return on your investment.\n\nBook publicists also vary regarding how and what they charge. Most charge a flat fee for a certain amount of time (many have a minimum) or a certain amount of outreach they plan to do that’s agreed on. Some publicists (very few) charge an hourly rate. And, even fewer, charge a fee only when they get results (hardly any publicists work this way, as it’s very difficult, even for a very good publicist, to predict which books are going to do very well—and luck, good timing, or divine intervention (however you want to look at it) are part of the process as well.\n\nHow much does a book publicist cost? – Best Literary Agents Article Series\n\nLegitimate book agents, including the best literary agents, don’t get paid unless they sell an author’s book. Hiring a book publicist, however, is like hiring a book editor when it comes to the investment required. You can get a good publicist for anywhere between $2-3,000 or tens of thousands of dollars. It will depend on the caliber of the publicist (as you likely already know, you usually get what you pay for). The cost will also depend on the term of your agreement (most publicists will tell you it takes months to get traction and see decent results). And, the cost will depend on the type of media exposure you want.\n\nFor example, it’s going cost more to get booked on major morning TV shows than it will to get booked on small radio stations or a small blog. The cost will also depend on whether you hire the publicist for one round or cycle of promotion or do something long-term. Many publicists are hired for multiple months (minimum) with a monthly cost of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t expect to make all the money you spend back via book sales if you hire a publicist. That might happen, but it might not. The best way to think of it is as an investment in your writing career.\n\nIn other words, hiring a publicist is no different than hiring someone to create an author website, hiring a freelance editor, or hiring a coach like me to give you the best chance of getting the best literary agents interested in your book. No one that you hire can (or should) promise you’re going to achieve a certain result or outcome. All they can (or should) say is that working with them will give you the best chance of achieving the results you want.\n\nAnd, if that person has a proven track record and genuinely believes you might be successful together, that’s the best you can hope for.\n\nHow should you choose a book publicist? – Best Literary Agents Article Series\n\nIf you’re going to hire a publicist, shop around. Do Google searches to browse the many different types of publicists online. Then consider setting up a consultation with multiple publicists, prior to make a decision. Most publicists offer a free or paid consultation, during which you learn things to help you become a better marketer. And, of course, such calls will help you make a better decision regarding who you decided to ultimately hire—if you decide to hire someone.\n\nWhere can I learn more about author platform? – Best Literary Agents Article Series\n\nExplaining how to improve one’s profile or platform to attract the best literary agents–or to improve your market reach after you have a book agent–is one of the most difficult things to do in an article. That’s because there are so many different ways to promote a book, depending on an individual author’s: book, time, location, physical limitations (perhaps due to age or a disability), computer ability, pitch ability, article writing ability, interview ability, personality, money available to invest in platform (though you can do a lot without paying), personal preferences, etc.\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all formula.\n\nThe good news is you don’t need to be an extrovert, young, good-looking, etc. to promote a book—authors ask me about things like that sometimes. Anyone can promote a book, and there are many ways to do it. The trick is finding the right way for you.\n\nIt’s the same writing a query letter to send to the best literary agents.\n\nThere are certain things every author should and shouldn’t do when writing a query. And, learning and following those things will help you significantly improve your odds of getting a good agent. But nothing compares to consulting with someone experienced who can help you see your unique opportunities (and trouble spots) for your unique book and situation.\n\nThat’s why I suggest every author consult with someone about their query. Just like a good publicist helps authors find the best hooks, angles, and media people to pitch a story to…I help authors find the best hooks and angles, and the best literary agents, to pitch a story to.

First, this assortment of the best book agents is partly based on deals that have been “self-reported” by the agents to a website called Publishers Marketplace.
