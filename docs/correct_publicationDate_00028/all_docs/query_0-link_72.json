The contents include all of the stories from the Arkham House book Polyphemus, two complete novels with I Said the Fly and The Color Out of Time, a new Mythos tale, and several stories that have never been reprinted in any form.\n\nMichael Shea has extensively revised many of the stories, making these the first definitive editions. Laird Barron has provided an insightful introduction. The book also features the complete John Stewart line drawings from Polyphemus, and about twenty color photographs. Limited to 500 copies, all signed by Michael Shea. Over 7 × 10 inches, bound in full cloth with a ribbon marker and patterned endsheets."
