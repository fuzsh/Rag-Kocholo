        "text": "The former Foreign Office diplomat Michael Shea, who has died aged 71 following a long illness, was press spokesman for the Queen from 1978 to 1987, a rich period for royal stories. A smooth and urbane figure, he was in charge of Buckingham Palace's relations with the media during the courtship and wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer; the exposure of Sir Anthony Blunt, the man in charge of the royal picture collection, as a former Soviet spy; and Michael Fagan's early morning incursion into the royal apartments in July 1982, which got him as far as the Queen's bedside.\n\nShea's accessibility was a considerable advance on a previous spokesman, Commander Richard Colville, whose supercilious taciturnity earned him the nickname of the Abominable No-man. But he was wrong-footed by the Sunday Times's story in July 1986 that the Queen did not see eye to eye with the social policies of Margaret Thatcher towards the miners, nor her dismissive attitude towards the Commonwealth.\n\nShea admitted talking to the paper's reporter, but denied being the source of the information. But there was more than a suspicion that, if not necessarily conveying Her Majesty's views, he was sympathetically interpreting them to accord with his own. A courtier, quoted by the historian Ben Pimlott in his biography of the Queen, said Shea had been \"seduced, tricked and ... caused to be indiscreet\". He left the palace the following year and, conspicuously, was not awarded a knighthood for his services, though he did become a CVO.\n\nBy then, relations with the media, particularly the tabloids, were beginning to fray. Shea's attempts to foster a discreet and cosy understanding with editors about their coverage of the royal superstar, Princess Diana, foundered.\n\nDiana's later claims that the palace and its officials had treated her coldly irked Shea, who protested that he had gone out of his way to give her media training in answering questions.\n\nThe increasingly intrusive interest in the royal family became wearing, and there may have been some disillusionment on Shea's part, too. \"There were aspects to [the job] I could have done without, such as the endless tabloid queries that exhausted one's patience: 'Does the Queen use a heated loo seat?'\" he remarked. Even the editor of the Times was apparently infected, ringing up to ask whether the Queen Mother – then 80, with 21 more years to go – was dying. Shea was able to tell him that, according to her private secretary: \"Her Majesty has, at this precise moment, got her waders on and is up to her waist fishing.\"\n\nShea was born in Carluke, Lanarkshire, in 1938, the son of a marine engineer and a teacher. He was educated locally at the school where his mother taught and later at Gordonstoun – which may have recommended him eventually to Prince Philip, one of the rugged school's most enthusiastic old boys (less so, perhaps, Prince Charles, who hated his time there). He studied economics to doctorate level at Edinburgh University and entered the Foreign Office in 1963, serving in west Africa (the region of his doctoral study); Bonn, where he met his wife, Mona, a Norwegian diplomat; and Romania during the Ceausescu regime.\n\nShea first came to the notice of the Queen when, as director general of the British Information Service in New York, he helped to organise the royal visit to the US in 1976. The following year, he was seconded to the palace, despite, according to colleagues, neither being obsequious, courtier material nor especially devoted to royalty. He accompanied the Queen on tours to 65 countries and the palace said this week she was \"saddened\" to hear of his death.\n\nAfter leaving the royal service in 1987, he worked as director of public affairs for the Hanson Group, before retiring back to Edinburgh to concentrate on a writing career. His first thriller had been published under the pseudonym Michael Sinclair, based on his first two forenames, while he worked at the embassy in Bonn. He wrote more than 20 books, including a discreet memoir of his time at the palace, called A View from the Sidelines (2003), and a book about diplomacy, To Lie Abroad (1996).\n\nHe also played an engaged role in city life, as a trustee of the National Galleries of Scotland, a director of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, chairman of the Royal Lyceum theatre and supporter of the campaign to establish a national photographic centre at the former Royal High School building. He and friends also revived the Edinburgh Oyster Club, a congenial dining society originally founded by Adam Smith.\n\nShea, who had dementia, is survived by his wife and two daughters.\n\nMichael Sinclair MacAuslan Shea, press secretary to the Queen, born 10 May 1938; died 17 October 2009"
