        "text": "Michael Shea (3 July 1946-16 February 2014) was an American author who wrote in the horror, fantasy and science fiction genres. A recipient of multiple awards, he won two World Fantasy Awards, and was nominated for a Hugo award, two Nebula Awards, and the British Fantasy Society's August Derleth Award. Possessed of a life-long interest in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, Shea wrote several stories within the setting, and two volumes of these were collected and edited by Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi. His works have also been favourably compared to those of Lord Dunsany and Clark Ashton Smith.\n\nMuch of Shea's Lovecraftian work is set in his home town of Los Angeles, California.\n\nSelected Works[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nMr. Cannyharme (2021)\n\nCollections[]\n\nThe Autopsy and Other Tales (2008)\n\nCopping Squid and Other Mythos Tales (2009)\n\nDemiurge: The Complete Cthulhu Mythos Tales of Michael Shea (2017)\n\nShort Fiction[]\n\n\"Nemo Me Impune Lacessit\" (1982)\n\n\"Fat Face\" (1987)\n\n\"The Presentation\" (2005)\n\n\"The Pool\" (2007)\n\n\"Tsathoggua\" (2008)\n\n\"The Recruiter\" (2009)\n\n\"The Battery\" (2009)\n\n\"Copping Squid\" (2009)\n\n\"Dagoniad\" (2009)\n\n\"Momma Durtt\" (2012)\n\n\"Beneath the Beardmore\" (2014)\n\n\"Under the Shelf\" (2014)\n\n\"Demiurge\" (2017)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn Shea's Mythos stories, H. P. Lovecraft and his works actually exist, with their descriptions of the horrors seemingly being for the most part accurate. How Lovecraft is supposed to have come about this information is unknown.\n\n[]"
