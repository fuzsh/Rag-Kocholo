        "text": "Polyphemus (In Greek: Πολύφημος) was a cyclops portrayed in the Odyssey and the Aeneid. After capturing Odysseus and several of his men, Polyphemus held them to capture in a cave, along with the cyclops' sheep and goats. He sealed the cave shut with a massive stone. During the ordeal, Polyphemus killed and ate six of the sailors. On the second day, Odysseus made the cyclops drunk, claiming his name was \"Nobody\", before five men drove a small sharpened stake into Polyphemus' only eye, blinding him. The cyclops called for help and other cyclops came to his aid; but when he said \"Nobody\" had hurt him, the cyclops took it to mean that nobody had hurt him, so they left him alone.\n\nThe next day, when Polyphemus rolled away the stone to let out his flock, Odysseus and his men clung to the fur of the flocks underbelly. Checking the animals, backs with his hands, Polyphemus did not find the men.\n\nYet after they have escaped and were on their ship, Odysseus called to the blind cyclops and told him who he really was. Polyphemus, in rage, hurled a great stone into the sea, nearly sending Odysseus' ship onto land. They sailed further out and again Odysseus mocked the cyclops. Yet Odysseus did not know that Polyphemus was the child of Poseidon, who would torment Odysseus' voyage.\n\nIn the Aeneid, it tells of Aeneas' encounter with the cyclops, seeing his wounds:\n\nPolyphemus, lived on berries and roots, and walked with a cane. He went to the sea often to wash out his eye-socket. One time, he heard the sounds of Aeneas' ships oars as they rowed nearby; but in fear, they hurriedly rowed away."
