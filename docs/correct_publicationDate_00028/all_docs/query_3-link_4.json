Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPolyphemus Polyphemus was the giant offspring of Thoosa and Poseidon.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Polyphemus or alternatively, you can download our 27-page Polyphemus worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nDescription\n\nPolyphemus was a cyclops – a monster that has only one eye located in the center of his forehead.\n\nHe was the child of Poseidon and Thoosa. His mother was a sea nymph and the daughter of the primordial sea god Phorcys.\n\nThe name Polyphemus means “abounding in songs and legends”.\n\nIn Odyssey, Homer mentions that Polyphemus was part of a group of uncivilized cyclopes.\n\nHomer’s cyclopes were shepherds who lived in caves in a faraway island and had no regard for Zeus. They also had no knowledge about ships, crafts, or agriculture.\n\nHomer also noted that Polyphemus was a man-eating giant.\n\nMythology\n\nOne of the most famous tales involving Polyphemus was told in the Odyssey.\n\nOdysseus and his crew came to the shore of the island of the Cyclopes.\n\nThey entered a cave full of supplies which turned out to be Polyphemus’ cave.\n\nWhen the giant returned home he was carrying a large weight of dry wood to use for fire at his supper time.\n\nHe then guided his sheep into the cave, separating the males from the female sheep and from those that he had already milked.\n\nWhen all his sheep were already in their pens, Polyphemus blocked the cave’s entrance with a huge rock.\n\nHe then sat down and proceeded to milk the goats and ewes, and placing the offspring beneath each dam.\n\nPolyphemus then curdled half of the white milk, stored it in wicker baskets, and put it away. The other half of the milk was put into vessels for him to take and consume whenever.\n\nOnly then did he notice the mortal men in his cave. He got angry at the men and ate two of them before going to sleep. This left Odysseus and his crew terrified.\n\nWhen the giant woke up the next morning, he ate two more men and left the cave to graze his flock, using the rock to block the entrance and trap Odysseus and his men.\n\nWhile Polyphemus was out, Odysseus started devising a plan for their escape.\n\nTwo more men were eaten when the giant returned in the evening. Odysseus then gave Polyphemus some strong, undiluted wine.\n\nThe drunken Polyphemus asked Odysseus his name in exchange for a guest-gift.\n\nOdysseus replied “Οὖτις”, meaning “nobody”, to which Polyphemus responded with a promise of eating “nobody” last, before he fell asleep due to drunkenness.\n\nWhile the cyclops was asleep, Odysseus retrieved the wooden stake which he sharpened and hardened in the fire the morning before. He then impaled Polyphemus in his eye, blinding him.\n\nPolyphemus shouted to the other cyclopes for help, crying out “nobody” hurt him, making his kin think that think that Polyphemus was being disturbed by divine power, recommending that he should pray.\n\nThe next morning, Polyphemus let his flock out to graze. He felt the back of each sheep to make sure that none of his captive men escaped.\n\nBut Odysseus and his crew had tied themselves to the bellies of the sheep, enabling them to escape.\n\nAs they sailed off from the island, Odysseus boastfully shouted his real name to the cyclops, an arrogant act that caused him problems later on.\n\nPolyphemus prayed to his father for revenge, and hurled huge rocks to the ship, which the men barely escaped.\n\nCenturies after the Odyssey, classical writers and poets depicted Polyphemus as a lover who fell in love with the sea nymph Galatea.\n\nIn these works, Polyphemus was a romantic musician, and unlike the earlier versions of Polyphemus, Classical poets, Philoxenus of Cythera being the first to do so, made the cyclops a creature that understood civilization, human nature, and even literature.\n\nMost writers showed Polyphemus’ advances to be unsuccessful.\n\nIn Metamorphoses, Ovid makes Polyphemus a little more like the monster he was as in the Odyssey.\n\nOvid introduced the character Acis, a man whom Galatea falls in love with.\n\nThe giant was oblivious to his uncivilized demeanor, ugliness, and enormous size, and continued to court Galatea with his songs.\n\nGalatea hid from the giant with her lover Acis.\n\nWhen Polyphemus found out about Galatea and Acis, he got jealous and, in anger, crushed Acis with a boulder.\n\nPolyphemus in Art\n\nThe blinding of the cyclops was a popular theme on ancient Greek ceramics.\n\nPolyphemus is often portrayed naked, with beard and the ears of a satyr. In front of him are a few men about to thrust a sharpened pole into his eye.\n\nAn example of this scene can be found on a krater made in the 7th century BCE, by Aristonothos.\n\nPolyphemus’ affection for Galatea was also depicted in a number of murals.\n\nOne such mural is at Pompeii, at the Casa del Sacerdote Amando. In this piece, Galatea sits on a dolphin, and Polyphemus, characterized as a shepherd, watches the nymph.\n\nPolyphemus Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle that includes everything you need to know about Marcelo Vieira across 27 in-depth pages.
