        "text": "All you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nI think we can all agree I'm a ten amongst these threes\n\n“I'm a ten amongst these threes”: This line refers to the commonly used 1-10 scale of attractiveness, where 10 is apparently just the best and hottest. Obviously this scale is problematic, but this line simultaneously shows Katheryn reclaiming it for her own, and using her bravado to distance herself from the other 5 queens, as she has in multiple other lines by this point in the show. Over the course of the song, she’ll lose her attempts to control her narrative with flippant words when she becomes overwhelmed by all her trauma.\n\nWe don’t actually know what Katheryn looked like, as we have no portraits that are definitively identified as her. The portrait I’ve seen most commonly described as showing her is actually probably Anna of Cleves. However, contemporary descriptions do consistently refer to her as quite pretty, specifically referring to her “very delightful” appearance, and describing her as “flourishing in youth, with beauty fresh and pure.”\n\nAll you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nAnd ever since I was a child, I'd make the boys go wild\n\nAll you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\n“And ever since I was a child, I'd make the boys go wild”: This lyric can often slip past you quickly before you realize how creepy this line really is. And it’s supposed to be. This song is designed to sound chipper and positive but has a dark, disturbing background that only really comes towards the end.\n\nTake my first music teacher, Henry Manox,\n\nI was young it's true but even then I knew, The only thing you wanna do is... *kiss* ahh\n\nBroad, dark, sexy Manox, Taught me all about dynamics\n\nHe was 23, And I was 13 going on 30\n\nDynamics refer to the relative loudness or softness of notes or phrases in a musical piece.\n\n13 Going on 30 is a 2004 rom com that follows a 13 year old who wakes up one day in the future, at age 30. In this context, it refers to the way Katheryn was forced to behave as an adult at a very young age.\n\nWe don’t know for sure when Katheryn was born, but estimates of her age at the time of her marriage to the king have varied from 15-19 over the years. Tudor Historian Gareth Russell, who wrote “Young and Damned and Fair” about Katheryn Howard, places her most likely birth year as in 1521/1522. His full reasoning on this subject is explained fully in this Royal History Geeks article.\n\nGareth also estimates that at most, Manox was 5 years older than Katheryn . He began teaching her in 1536, and although we don’t know exactly when their “relationship” started, it ended in early 1538. Thus, Katheryn was 15-16 when their relationship began, and Manox was at most 21, although he was 23 by the time their relationship ended.\n\nObviously from a modern perspective, a relationship between a teenage girl and an adult man is problematic and criminal. It was also viewed as problematic in that time, although that was more due to Manox and Howard’s class differences, the risk to her reputation, and the religious concerns with “sinful” sexual activity than their actual age difference.\n\nWe'd spend hours strumming the lute, Striking the chords and blowing the flute\n\nHe plucked my strings all the way to G, Went from major to minor, C to D\n\nlute, flute: I don’t believe we have any evidence indicating which instruments Katheryn learned to play, but both the lute and flute were very common instruments in Tudor times. We know that Henry VIII himself played the lute and the flute, along with the organ, other keyboard instruments, various recorders, and the harp. He also sang and wrote music.\n\n“He plucked my strings all the way to G:This lyric puns on the fact that musical instruments (in western tradition) have notes corresponding to the letters A through G + the existence of string bikinis/underwear referred to as G Strings (or thongs).\n\n“Major to Minor” refers to the musical scales. I’m not going to explain this in depth, but essentially a song written in a major scale generally sounds brighter and happier, while a song written in a minor scale is more likely to sound sad or ominous. “C to D” refers to musical keys, which is a group of pitches, named after the starting note.\n\nTell me what you need, What you want, you don't need to plead\n\n'Cause I feel the chemistry, Like I get you and you get me\n\nAnd maybe this is it, He just cares so much, it feels legit\n\nWe have a connection, I think this guy is different\n\nThere aren’t any historical or cultural references here in particular, but the lyrics in general refer to the character Katheryn’s desire to be loved and appreciated. “I think this guy is different” indicates that Katheryn already has reason to distrust men and relationships, even at such a young age.\n\n'Cause all you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs touch me, love me, can't get enough, see\n\nAll you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me\n\nRun your fingers through my hair, Tell me, I'm the fairest of the fair\n\nPlaytime's over, The only thing you wanna do is...*kiss* ahh\n\n“Birds and the bees” refers to stories parents tell to children when they’re explaining sexuality and how babies are made. This not only refers to actual sexy time activities, but continues to underline Katheryn'’s relative youth to the adult Manox. Evidence indicates that while Katheryn fooled around with Manox, she was reluctant to actually have sex with him and “lose her virginity” (note: virginity is an incredibly damaging social construct designed to control and shame women, and it’s not actually possible to lose it because it doesn’t actually exist. but! that’s a rant for another day).\n\nI couldn’t find any actual evidence that anyone called Katheryn “the fairest of the fair” in Tudor times (“the fairest of the fair” is actually a march by John Philip Sousa!). However, “fair” was very commonly used to describe attractive women at the time, and several contemporary records described Katheryn with this word. This may have literally just meant “beautiful” then, or it may have referred to Katheryn having a light complexion or light hair, but since we don’t have a definitive Katheryn portrait, the exact meaning is unclear. For the record, Gareth Russell’s book describes Katheryn with blonde hair.\n\nBut then there was another guy, Francis Dereham\n\nSerious, stern and slow, Gets what he wants, and he won't take no\n\nPassion in all that he touches, The sexy secretary to the Dowager Duchess\n\nLife at the Dowager Duchess’s: Katheryn’s parents died when she was fairly young. After that, she lived in the household of her step-grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, and roomed with numerous other girls in the maiden’s chamber, in a dormitory type set up. Even if her parents hadn’t died, she likely would have been sent to her grandmother’s for a while; it was very common for noble children to live in a different family’s household for several years.\n\nIt was pretty common for men to sneak into the maidens’ chamber at night with wine and treats to speak and flirt with the various girls there. Apparently it was fairly easy for the men to hide behind a curtained area of the chamber if anyone came to check in on the girls in the night. Katheryn herself stole a key to the staircase up to the chamber and had it copied, to ensure that these visits could continue without issue.\n\nFrancis Dereham had been the Dowager Duchess’s secretary for about two years before his relationship with Katheryn started in 1538. According to Gareth Russell’s research, Dereham was very confident and had quite the temper. Dereham had already had a few flings with other servants at the Dowager Duchess’s home, including Joan Acworth, Katheryn’s roommate and secretary. Joan was clearly over Dereham by this time and apparently said very nice things about him to Katheryn .\n\nKatheryn had likely only ended her relationship with Manox a few weeks before starting her relationship with Francis Dereham. She was apparently quite in love with Dereham and did indeed have sex with him, despite the lack of privacy in the maiden’s chamber. Witnesses attested to hearing both Dereham and Katheryn talk about how they knew how to have sexual relations without risking pregnancy.\n\nContent Warning, Sexual assault: “He won’t take no”: Another ominous, creepy line delivered playfully enough that you can often miss it initially. Although some witnesses at the time said that Katheryn and Dereham seemed to have consensual relations, Katheryn herself said that Dereham coerced her and raped her. She said in a letter, “Francis Dereham by many persuasions procured me to his vicious purpose, and obtained first to lie upon my bed with his doublet and hose, and after within the bed, and finally he lay with me naked, and used me in such sort as a man doth his wife, many and sundry times.” Although she might have saved her life if she testified that there was a precontract between her and Dereham, as this would have given the king a pretext for annulling the marriage (and potentially saving her life), she steadfastly denied this.\n\n*Note: In the initial form of this post, I accidentally left out Katheryn’s own testimony as to the nature of her relationship with Dereham in this post. Katheryn always asserted that Francis Dereham coerced and raped her, and I erred in leaving that aspect out of this post. This was a huge oversight and I apologize for it.\n\nHelped him in his office, had a duty to fulfil, He even let me use his favorite quill\n\nSpilled ink all over the parchment, my wrist was so tired\n\nStill I came back the next day as he required\n\nThe innuendo in this section gets even more explicit. If you don’t understand it, I’m certainly not going to explain it. :)\n\nThe actual action (of Katheryn helping Francis in his office) described here likely didn’t happen, as Katheryn was a high ranking noble woman and would not have been helping a secretary with his work whatsoever. As I noted before, she actually had her own personal secretary (although she likely had very little correspondence, so that was really more an indication of her station than a necessity).\n\nQuills and ink: In Tudor times and for many centuries after, feather quills were used to write. When properly cut, a feather’s ink can hold ink and slowly release it for the writer’s use. Quill feathers often came from geese or swans.\n\nYou say I'm what you need, All you want, you don't need to plead\n\n'Cause I feel the chemistry, Like I get you and you get me\n\nAnd I know this is it, He just cares so much, this one's legit\n\nWe have a real connection, I'm sure this time is different\n\n'Cause all you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs touch me, love me, can't get enough see\n\nAll you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs please me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me\n\nYou can't wait a second more to get, My corset on the floor\n\nPlaytime's over, The only thing you wanna do is...*kiss* ahh\n\nThe choruses of this song are very repetitive and often have only minor variations on the same theme, so I’m not going to analyze them all in depth. There isn’t really much historical content in here anyway, it’s all characterization of the character’s thoughts on her relationships.\n\nIn Katheryn Howard’s time, corsets were actually called bodies or stays.\n\nYeah, that didn't work out, So I decided to have a break from boys.\n\nAnd you'll never guess who I met\n\nThis song, as long as it is, concentrates on Katheryn’s state of mind and really doesn’t get into a lot of the details about what actually happened in her relationships or at the end of her life. To elaborate a bit more, Katheryn’s step-grandmother, the Dowager Duchess, eventually walked in on Katheryn embracing Francis (in the company of her friend and secretary Joan) and apparently was QUITE angry; she punched all three people and raged for a while, but never actually fired Dereham (she wasn’t the greatest of guardians, tbh). Francis adored Katheryn and very much wanted to marry her, giving her several costly gifts. She seemed to indulge him for a while, and they called each other “husband” and “wife.”\n\nAlthough Dereham seemed to think that they were pre-contacted to marry, Katheryn did not. A precontract was a commitment to marry in the future, which was often used so a couple could start sleeping together before the actual wedding. Precontracts were legally considered as good as marriage, and could be used to annul later marriages or disinherit children from now-invalid marriages (Henry VIII used a supposed precontract between Anna of Cleves and Francis of Lorraine to dissolve his marriage with her).\n\nKatheryn Howard broke things off with Francis when her uncle the Duke of Norfolk arranged for her to join the new queen Anna of Cleves’ court as a maid of honor. Francis later claimed that Katheryn wept when they parted, saying she had to do as her family ordered, while Katheryn said that she lost her temper and told him to do what he liked. Whatever the actual truth was, Francis apparently still believed after the conversation that he had a chance with Katheryn in the future, and might still be her husband.\n\nKatheryn joined the royal court in the late summer/early autumn of 1539, and was reportedly quite enthusiastic about her new position. We don’t know exactly when she met Henry VIII, but it was probably around this time.\n\nTall, large, Henry the Eighth, Supreme head of the Church of England\n\nGlobally revered, Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard\n\nThe lines here aren’t nearly as clever or as flirtatious as her previous compliments. This is a subtle way of indicating that Katheryn isn’t really interested in Henry at all, and is struggling to say anything sexy or good about him.\n\nTall, large, Henry the Eighth: We actually have a pretty good idea of Henry’s size in 1540 based on the dimensions of his suits of armour. He was 6’1” in height and the armour he had made a year before his marriage to Katheryn Howard had a 51 inch waist and a 54.5 inch chest circumference.\n\nSupreme head of the Church of England: Henry established the Church of England with himself at the head in 1536, so he had only been in this role for a few years when he married Katheryn. It might be a bit of an exaggeration to call Henry “globally revered” though. Maybe more “globally notorious.”\n\nMade me a lady in waiting, Hurled me and my family up in the world\n\nGave me duties in court and he swears it's true,\n\nThat without me, he doesn't know what he'd do\n\nlady in waiting: As I noted earlier, Katheryn’s uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, actually arranged for her position as a maid of honor for Anna of Cleves before she even met Henry. The maids of honor were the lowest ranked noble ladies in the queen’s household. They were younger than the ladies in waiting and unmarried. They accompanied the queen and served as her companions, but also supervised various servants and performed various tasks, such as dressing the queen or fetching items for her. This usage of “lady in waiting” as a substitute for “maid of honor'“ is consistent throughout Six, as presumably, the writers were concerned people would get confused by the nomenclature, given its modern meaning in a wedding party sense.\n\nHurled me and my family up in the world: It’s interesting that anyone would say Katheryn or her family were hurled up in the world, as she was actually very well placed already as a Howard. Although her parents died when she was young and she was relatively penniless before she came to court, as a maid of honor, she received lodgings and a decent salary, and she had numerous family members in prominent places at court. She would have been fine money and status-wise even if Henry had never noticed her, perhaps not wealthy or well known, but still comfortable and happy.\n\nHowever, the king did give her many presents, starting in April 1540 (when he was still married to Anna of Cleves), so the relationship did materially benefit her. In April, she was given the property of two condemned criminals, and in May, Henry bought her 23 light silk quilts.\n\nAlthough many tellings of the story of Henry annulling his marriage to Anna of Cleves and then marrying Katheryn Howard position her as the victim of her uncle’s machinations, the evidence seems to indicate that their relationship was a bit more spontaneous than that. Katheryn’s youthful misadventures at the Dowager Duchess’s home were widely known enough that if anyone had dug much into her background, they would have found evidence of them pretty quickly (as later became clear). It seems unlikely that the Howards would have deliberately put her forward to distract the king without vetting her, and she honestly wouldn’t have made it past such a vetting. The Howards did use the king’s attraction to Katheryn to their own advantage later, but there’s really no indication that they set it up themselves.\n\nYou say I'm what you need, All you want, we both agree\n\nThis is the place for me, I'm finally where I'm meant to be\n\nThen he starts saying all this stuff, He cares so much, he calls me love\n\nHe says we have this connection, I guess it's not so different\n\nHe cares so much, he calls me love: Henry VIII considered himself a romantic at heart and really wanted to be in love with his wives. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer (who I honestly think was one of the most emotionally intelligent members of Henry’s court), even said to Thomas Cromwell pre-Anna of Cleves’ arrival in England that it would be “most expedient the King to marry where that he had his fantasy and love, for that would be most comfort to his Grace.”\n\nThe Dowager Duchess later testified that the king liked Katheryn the moment he met her. This instant attraction to a woman really fit into Henry’s own romantic ideals of love, and even if this interest didn’t result in him pursuing a relationship with her for a few more months (there’s no evidence that Henry pursued her until early 1540 sometime), this connection was probably revived anew the moment he realized he didn’t want to marry/stay married to Anna of Cleves.\n\nThe Howards moved Katheryn back to Lambeth at some point during Henry’s courtship of her for the sake of her reputation. However, Henry visited her multiple times there in his royal barge, which probably only increased the level of gossip about their relationship.\n\n'Cause all you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs touch me, love me, can't get enough, see\n\nAll you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs seize me, squeeze me, birds and the bees me\n\nThere's no time for when or how 'cause you\n\nJust got to have me now, Playtime's over\n\nThe only thing you wanna do is...*kiss* ahh\n\nAll you wanna do: We have no idea when Henry began a physical relationship with Katheryn. However, as Gareth Russell noted in his book, Henry was impressed by his past wives’ abstaining from sex until marriage (Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour), so it’s possible that they waited until after his fourth marriage was annulled and his fifth marriage was performed.\n\nSo we got married, Woo\n\nThe annulment of Henry’s marriage to Anna of Cleves was motivated by many things (which I addressed more in depth in my post on her song “Get Down”), and was made official in early July 1540. Anna was given numerous properties and a very high rank in return for her acquiescence during the process.\n\nHenry and Katheryn married in a small ceremony on July 28, 1540. At the time, Henry was 49 and Katheryn was probably 19. For comparison’s sake, Henry’s daughter Mary was 24 at this time (Elizabeth was almost 7 and Edward was nearing 3).\n\nWith Henry, it isn't easy, His temper's short, and his mates are sleazy\n\nExcept for this one courtier, He's a really nice guy, just so sincere\n\nThe royal life isn't what I planned, But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand\n\nSo sweet, makes sure that I'm okay, And we hang out loads when the King's away\n\nHenry really did have a terrible temper. There are countless examples of this from throughout his life, but one of the most relevant for Katheryn’s story is the downfall of Thomas Cromwell. Although Cromwell had served on the king’s privy council since 1530 and as his chief minister since 1534, Henry was so displeased with his fourth marriage and the breakdown of the alliance secured by that marriage that he ordered Cromwell arrested in June 1540, and executed on July 28, 1540. Henry came to regret executing Cromwell and later blamed the decision on his privy council, reportedly stating: “on the pretext of several trivial faults [Cromwell] had committed, they had made several false accusations which had resulted in him killing the most faithful servant he had ever had” (this was reported in a letter by a French ambassador in March 1541).\n\nDespite the lyrics in this song implying “Thomas” was different than Henry’s usual friends, Thomas Culpepper was very much sleezy himself. He was a gentleman of the King’s privy chamber and a close friend to the King, who gave him numerous properties. He was apparently quite handsome, flirtatious, and, as Gareth Russell described him, “unashamedly promiscuous with consensual partners.”\n\nContent Warning, Sexual assault: We also have records indicating that sometime in 1540, Culpepper may have raped the wife of a park-keeper and killed a man when the villagers tried to apprehend him for the crime. I say “may have” because we only have one report of the case, and it is possible that the letter writer mixed up Thomas with his older brother. Regardless, whoever committed the crime, the king pardoned him for the rape and murder.\n\nGareth Russell’s book notes that Culpepper noticed Katheryn pretty quickly after she arrived at court and pursued her, but after she played hard to get, he moved on to someone else. This upset Katheryn more than she may have expected, as it apparently caused her to weep in front of several of her fellow maids of honor. Rumors of this did get back to Francis Dereham, who came up to court and confronted Katheryn about it. Katheryn apparently rather brutally put him down and said she would not have Francis and if he had heard anything about Thomas, he knew more than she did.\n\nThis guy finally Is what I want, the friend I need\n\nJust mates, no chemistry, I get him and he gets me\n\nAnd there's nothing more to it, He just cares so much, he's devoted\n\nHe says we have a connection, I thought this time was different\n\nWhy did I think he'd be different?, But it's never, ever different\n\nWe know that there was a LOT of evidence gathered in the case against Katheryn Howard and that many many interviews were conducted. However, a lot of these documents were lost or destroyed over the years, so we don’t quite have the full story.\n\nAlthough courtly love and flirtation games were de rigeur in royal courts of the time, Katheryn’s relationship with Culpepper appeared to have crossed that line into a much more emotional entanglement than was generally accepted.\n\nKatheryn also sent him a letter when he was sick that has often been described as a love letter, but could also be interpreted as a letter between friends, as passionate language was commonly used in friendly letters of the time. This is also the only example we have her handwriting, so it has to be viewed with a bit of suspicion. The letter also may contain writing from two different people, as there are several words at the beginning of the letter which look quite different from the rest of the writing. I’m really not pulling these doubts out of thin air, by the way; Conor Byrne’s “Katherine Howard: Henry VIII’s Slandered Queen” argues that Katherine neither had romantic feelings nor sexual relations with Culpepper. I haven’t read his book in depth, but will need to do so in the future to really explore this argument, which he laid out a bit in a blog post.\n\nLater when he was interrogated, Thomas said that he had not actually had sex with Katheryn, but that “he intended and meant to do ill with the Queen and that likewise the Queen so minded with him.” Thomas was not tortured, but apparently was quite frank and open in his discussion of his relationship with Katheryn, so he really might have been speaking the truth here.\n\n'Cause all you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nIs touch me, when will enough be enough?\n\nSee, All you wanna do, All you wanna do, baby\n\nSqueeze me, don't care if you don't please me\n\nBite my lip and pull my hair, As you tell me, I'm the fairest of the fair\n\nPlaytime's over, Playtime's over, Playtime's over\n\nThe only thing, The only thing, The only thing you wanna do is...*kiss* ahh\n\nThe formerly playful and sexy lyrics are now angry and desperate and are performed with much more intensity and disgust as the character loses her equilibrium. It’s honestly a really powerful moment of the show and leaves me breathless every time.\n\nBecause this song and the show doesn’t address Katheryn’s ultimate downfall and execution beyond noting that she was beheaded, I won’t get too much into those details. However, in short, reports of Katheryn’s pre-marital relationships ended up reaching the privy council and the king and a thorough investigation launched into the reports also uncovered her relationship with Culpepper (whether it was friendly or romantic in nature, she undoubtedly met with him in secret, which looked…bad, to say the least).\n\nThree confessions were taken from Katheryn in the course of the investigation, which related to her pre-marital relationships. You can read those letters, along with Katheryn’s letter to Culpepper over at The History of England website.\n\nWhat led to Katheryn’s ultimate fate was summarized very well by Gareth Russell in his book, who said “What happened to Catherine Howard was monstrous and it struck many of her contemporaries as unnecessary, but it was not a lynching. The Queen was toppled by a combination of bad luck, poor decisions, and the Henrican state’s determination to punish those who failed its king.” She was ultimately executed on February 13, 1542. The night before, she asked for the execution block to be brought to her so she could practice placing her head on it.\n\nAlthough there’s a legend that Katheryn said “I die a Queen, but I would rather die the wife of Culpeper,” she really did not. We have witness accounts of what she actually said, and it’s not that. In addition, saying something like this would have been incredibly foolish , as if the king disliked something she said from the block, he could very well go punish her entire family after her death.\n\nKatheryn was not the only victim of her downfall. Lady Rochford was executed right after her.\n\nFrom necessity, this post can’t even slightly cover all the events of Katheryn Howard’s life. I highly recommend reading Gareth Russell’s “Young, Damned, and Fair” for more info.\"\n\nCLEVES: So I guess you already know what happened next. How I came to England hopeful, summoned after the king saw my portrait. And how I, with my meager looks the way they are, didn’t live up to his expectations. I mean, it’s the usual story, isn’t it? The savvy educated young princess deemed repulsive by the wrinkled, wheezing, ulcer-riddled man twenty-four years her senior.\n\nRejection! Rejection from a king! I mean, how can anyone overcome the fate as devastating as being forced to move into a resplendent palace in Richmond with more money that I could ever spend in a lifetime? And not a single man around to tell me what to do with it. I mean, seriously, it’s just… tragic.\n\nYou’ve probably heard the story before - at least the story from Henry VIII’s point of view. King chooses a bride based on her portrait only to be disappointed by her appearance in real life. Henry had actually been trying to get out of the marriage contract since the day he met Anna of Cleves, claiming that he did not find her attractive, but his counselors couldn’t find him a good excuse. So a reluctant Henry married Anna on January 6, 1540, and the next day, he told his advisor Thomas Cromwell “I liked her before not well, but now I like her much worse.” He claimed her breasts were saggy and said she had an unpleasant odor.\n\nAs Six points out quite rightly, Henry really had no place to talk about Anna’s appearance. Anna was a young woman who most everyone considered pretty. Everyone who saw her and her portrait said it was a good likeness of her, and Henry had chosen her based on that portrait, so he clearly considered her pretty at some point. In contrast, Henry was 25-26 years older than Anna, and had significant ulcers on both legs that were kept open most of the time; these ulcers constantly “wept” and likely were very smelly. At this point, he was in significant chronic pain and had trouble moving around. We know from a set of armor worn by Henry in 1540 that his waist was 51 inches around at this point. As I’ll discuss later, Henry, for one reason or another, was looking for a reason to get out of the marriage. Perhaps Anna offended him personally in other ways. Perhaps the political landscape had changed since the engagement was arranged. Either way, no one ever thought of Anna as repulsive except Henry himself.\n\nNote: The use of the word “princess” isn’t quite accurate here. Anna wasn’t a princess, but the daughter of a Duke and Duchess. Her mother was the last in the line ruling the combined duchies of Jülich and Berg; since women could not hold property in their own right under Salic law, these duchies went to her husband, John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark, when they married. Thus, Anna’s father was Duke of not only his own family’s lands, but ruled as Duke over his wife’s lands as well.\n\nSittin' here all alone on a throne In a palace that I happen to own\n\nBring me some pheasant - Keep it on the bone\n\nThis song is all set from Anna’s point of view after her marriage was annulled, when she’s off on her own in her own house, enjoying her very nice divorce settlement. Henry likely gave her such a nice settlement partially out of gratitude that she wasn’t kicking up a fuss like Catherine of Aragon had, and partially to keep good relations with her brother, the Duke of Cleves, and his allies. Henry gave Anna the residences of Richmond and Bletchingley, which included houses and parks as well. She also received 8,000 nobles and many gifts, including jewels, pearls, plate, furniture, and hangings. She was officially named “the king’s sister,” and given precedence over all other ladies in England, apart from the King’s own wife and children.\n\nRichmond was built after a previous royal residence, Sheen, burned down in 1497. When Henry VII rebuilt the residence in 1501, he named it Richmond Palace after his title of Earl of Richmond (which actually took its name from Richmond Castle in Yorkshire); the town of Sheen, which had been built up around the manor, changed its name to Richmond around the same time. The palace was placed on the River Thames and lay about nine miles from the Palace of Westminster. Before Anna was given the residence, Henry VIII’s daughter Mary lived there for a while.\n\nFill my goblet up to the brim Sippin' on mead\n\nand I spill it on my dress with the gold lace trim\n\nNot very prim and proper. Can't make me stop\n\nThis song is based off a classic hip hop style of braggadocio, where the singer basically tells you how amazing and rich they are. These songs are often from a male’s point of view, and the positioning of Anna as a woman bragging about her fantastic life is super empowering, particularly since she’s gone down in history as Henry VIII’s “ugly wife.”\n\nFun fact: The term braggadocio came from the name of a braggart character named Braggadocchio in the Tudor-era epic poem “The Faerie Queen,” by Edmund Spenser which partially praised and partially criticized Elizabeth I.\n\nAnna actually did have a pretty great time post annulment! She was financially well off and had far more freedom living on her own in England than she did living with her brother back in Germany or as Henry’s wife in England. She was one of the highest ranking people in the country as the king’s “beloved sister.” In addition, the people of England really loved her, and she was popular with crowds wherever she went.\n\nWe have records indicating that she wore new clothes almost every day, and the French ambassador at the time described her “as joyous as ever.” She also sought licenses to order a huge amount of beer (800 tuns of beer, adding up to about 201,600 gallons) and export it, presumably for income.\n\nSix’s portrayal of Anna as living the best life ever and having no regrets though is…alas, not quite accurate. Anna definitely made the best of her situation, and was probably quite grateful that she avoided the fate of Henry’s first two wives, but it wasn’t her ideal life. Neither Anna nor the people around her would consider her “the lucky one.”\n\nThe gold lace trim reference here may refer to the outfit Anna is wearing in her most famous portrait, which is trimmed in orange that could perhaps be read as gold and features gold fabric around the neck line that could be lace.\n\nI wanna go hunting, any takers?\n\nI'm not fake 'cause I've got acres and acres\n\nPaid for with my own riches\n\nWhere my hounds at? Release the bitches (Woof)\n\nAnna did hunt when she lived in Germany, although I don’t know if we have any evidence that she hunted in England. Hunting was a very popular past time for nobles then, so it’s quite possible.\n\nAnd she absolutely did have actual acres of land!\n\nEveryday. Head back for a round of croquet, yeah\n\n'Cause I'm a playa and tomorrow, I'll hit replay\n\nAlthough croquet as we think of it today did not exist in the 1500s, its predecessor Jeu de Mail may have been around by 1540, when Anna moved to Richmond Palace. Some sources claim it goes back to 1300s France, and while there’s a bit of skepticism about that, most people seem to think it developed in the 15th-16th century.\n\nYou, you said that I tricked ya\n\n'Cause I, I didn't look like my profile picture\n\nToo, too bad I don't agree\n\nSo I'm gonna hang it up for everyone to see\n\nAnd you can't stop me 'cause\n\nThe chorus continues the musical’s comparison of Anna’s situation to online dating with the description of her portrait as a profile picture.\n\nAlthough Henry complained to Thomas Cromwell before the wedding “Say what they will, she is nothing so fair as she hath been reported, howbeit she is well and seemly,” there’s no actual evidence indicating that Anna that the portrait was inaccurate. Hans Holbein had been specifically sent by Henry to paint realistic portraits of Anna and her sister, and everyone who had seen her and the portrait agreed it was a good likeness. Holbein himself kept his job with Henry VIII after the annulment and continued to paint portraits for him, strongly indicating that Henry had no problem with the actual painting or the artist who made it.\n\nOne theory of what led to Henry VIII’s dislike of Anna derives from what happened at their first meeting. Henry was a bit of a romantic and disguised himself to go surprise Anna earlier than planned; this was in line with courtly love traditions in England of the like that his previous queens and lovers had played along with. The idea was that the female target of such a disguising would somehow intuit the identity of her intended and fall in love with him at first sight. Records indicate that Anna did not know who Henry was and instead, ignored him and treated him like a servant. For a king who had been used to getting what he wanted since childhood, he probably was rather embarrassed.\n\nThere are other, political reasons that Henry may not have wanted to get or stay married to Anna. I’m not going to get into those in depth, but they basically have to do with the balance of powers throughout Europe, and those powers’ feelings toward Henry at the time. At one point it made political sense for Henry to marry Anna, as he was short on other allies; later, it made a lot less sense.\n\nI'm the queen of the castle\n\nGet down, you dirty rascal, Get down\n\nGet down, Get down you dirty rascal\n\nGet down, Get down, 'Cause I'm the queen of the castle\n\nThe chorus is based on the classic children’s rhyme of “King of the Castle” (which goes back to at least 1850), which adds a fun touch of playfulness to the musical.\n\nWhen I get bored I go to court\n\nPull up outside in my carriage Don't got no marriage\n\nSo I have a little flirt with the footman As he takes my fur. As you were\n\nAnna really did go to the royal court several times after her annulment. Most famously, she visited Hampton Court for New Year 1541, exchanging significant gifts with Henry VIII’s new queen Katherine Howard at the time.\n\nAnna did relatively well after her marriage to Henry ended, and seemed to be determined to make the best of it, but we have records that she actually wasn’t very happy about it and did want to reunite with the king after Katherine Howard’s execution. She was actually in an impossible situation in a lot of ways. The annulment of her marriage was based on the assertion that she had a valid pre-contract and thus, was already married to another man. This made her married/unmarried status so tenuous that no man would be willing to pursue her as a potential spouse. Anna was very intelligent and would have realized this at the time. Thus, at age 25, Anna had to accept that she was never going to be able to get married or have children. We don’t really know if she wanted those things, but in any case, the choice was completely taken away from her.\n\nAs he takes my fur: Cleves' costume in Six actually is trimmed with fake fur! And Tudor winter clothes definitely were lined with fur at times to keep the wearer warm.\n\nMaking my way to the dance floor\n\nSome boys making advance - I ignore them\n\n'Cause my jam comes on the lute\n\nLooking cute - Das ist gut\n\nRecords indicate that Anna of Cleves and Katherine Howard danced together when Anna visited Hampton Court for New Years’ Day.\n\nHenry VIII loved music and kept a huge number of musicians on staff. Dancing music at court would commonly feature keyboard instruments and lutes.\n\n“Das ist gut” is German for “this is good.”\n\nAll eyes on me No criticism\n\nI look more rad than Lutheranism\n\nDance so hard that I'm causin' a sensation\n\nOkay ladies, let's get in reformation\n\n/sigh/ TL;DR Anna wasn’t really Protestant, but these lyrics are fire so I’ll excuse it.\n\nLonger explanation: A lot of people assume Anna was Lutheran, because she grew up in Germany during the time of the Protestant Reformation. However, Anna’s very devout Catholic mother raised her children as Catholics. Cleves was allied with several Lutheran princes of other areas of Germany in the Schmalkaldic League, and was fairly tolerant of Reformist teachings, but this did not make the rulers of Cleves or Anna herself Protestant. When Anna married Henry, she started following his religious ways (which were themselves not really protestant, but more just “Catholic without a pope”), but later officially returned to Roman Catholicism when her step-daughter Mary I took the throne.\n\nThe term “Lutheran” actually was used as early as 1519, although it was originally used as a derogatory reference to follower’s of Martin Luther.\n\nFun Side Tangent: Henry VIII and Martin Luther kind of battled each other with words for years. Henry authored and published the 1521 tract known as “Assertio Septem Sacramentorum,” which defended Catholic views on sacraments against Martin Luther’s teachings. In it, Henry repeatedly refers to Luther as “little Monk.” Henry’s Assertio was translated into German and was actually pretty popular for a few years there. Luther responded in a 1521 work called “Contra Henricum Regem Anglie,” which mocked Henry quite sarcastically at times. One of my favorite parts is: “Where, pray, did this new God, the King of England, come from, this Creator of new articles of faith? Till now I have heard of but one God with the right to make articles of faith and to require belief in them.” He also just straight up called Henry a frivolous buffoon, so that’s fun. Translation here. Then Thomas More responded that with “Responsio ad Lutherum,” which included such choice insults as “When I began to read [Luther’s Contra Henricum Regem Anglie]—good God, what an ocean of nonsense, what a bottomless pit of madness presented itself.” It was a whole thing. Later, when Luther heard that Henry had broken with the Catholic Church, he was wholly unimpressed, and noted in letters that he believed Henry wasn’t actually a reformer but was pursuing his own desires instead.\n\n“Okay ladies, let’s get in reformation” is a hilarious reference to Beyonce’s “Formation” (the original is “Okay ladies now let’s get in formation”) and the English reformation\n\n[Chorus]\n\nNow I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger but check my prenup, and go figure\n\nStrong reference to Kanye West’s “Gold Digger.” The original line goes “Now I ain’t saying she a gold digger,” and a later line in the song says “If you ain't no punk holla, ‘We want prenup!’”\n\nGot gold chains - Symbolic of my faith to the higher power\n\nIn the fast lane - My horses can trot up to 12 miles an hour\n\nLet me explain - I'm a wiener schnitzel, not an English flower\n\nNo one tells me I need a rich man\n\nDoin' my thing in my palace in Richmond\n\nGold chain necklaces are often worn and referenced in songs as a way to brag about wealth. I like that in the middle of this bragging song, Anna takes a break to reference her actual religious faith.\n\nMy horses can trot up to 12 miles an hour: this plays off braggadocio songs, which sometimes reference fast cars. This line also probably is a playful reference to a cars' “horsepower” (motor lower). I read online that the average horse-drawn carriage can go up to 15 miles an hour, so this is a pretty realistic number actually.\n\nWiener schnitzel - wiener schnitzel refers to a type of schnitzel (a thin slice of meat, usually prepared by pounding) from Vienna, not Germany, so this is actually …a weird lyrical choice. In addition, wiener schnitzel didn’t show up in records until 1831, so it almost certainly didn’t exist in Tudor times.\n\nEnglish flower- Beautiful English women are often referred to as English roses.\n\n“No one tells me I need a rich man” is a reference to a famous quote by Cher. \"My mom said to me, 'You know sweetheart, one day you should settle down and marry a rich man. And I said, 'Mom, I am a rich man.'“\n\n[Chorus, various repeated lines]\n\nIt’s Anna of Cleves\n\nBy dropping her own name at the end of the song, Cleves references yet another hip-hop trope popular in braggadocio that has been more recently picked up by pop artists (see: 2 Chainz, Nicki Minaj, Usher, Britney Spears, Jason Derulo).\n\nAll My Six Posts!\n\nOver-Analyzing All the Historical References in Six- “Ex Wives,” “No Way,” “Don’t Lose Your Head” “Heart of Stone” “Haus of Holbein” “Get Down”\n\nThe Tudor Crown Inspiration in Six’s Logo; The Tudor Fashion Elements of the Costumes in Six (with Painting References)\n\nSix the Musical Wives 1-3: Historical and Modern Costume Inspirations; Six the Musical Wives 4-6: Historical and Modern Costume Inspirations\n\nThe Ladies in Waiting of Six: Historical Inspirations and Costumes; Details from Six Costumer Gabriella Slade’s Instagram Takeover\n\nThe Early Costumes of Six the Musical: From Edinburgh to Cambridge to London\n\nUpdated Six the Musical Costumes for Broadway!; The Shoes of Six the Musical\n\nThe Alternate Costumes of Six the Musical; How the Six Alternates Change Their Styling for Each Queen\n\nVirtual Dance Workshops and Q&As with Different Six Cast Members!"
