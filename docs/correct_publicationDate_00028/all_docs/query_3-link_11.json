        "text": "On ancient Greek ceramics, the blinding of Polyphemus was a favorite theme: the Cyclops is a naked, bearded giant with satyr's ears, and a number of men are on the verge of thrusting a sharpened pole into his single eye. Such a scene can be found on a krater by Aristonothus (seventh century BCE; Rome). On a Laconian kylix (ca. 550 BCE; Paris), Odysseus offers a pitcher of wine to Polyphemus who still holds the limbs of the men he ate in his hand.\n\nHis love for Galatea is depicted on several murals, such as at the Casa del Sacerdote Amando at Pompeii. Galatea is seated on a dolphin while Polyphemus, who is represented here as a shepherd, watches her. A fresco at the house of Augustus on the Palatine at Rome (the Casa di Livia) shows Polyphemus standing up to his chest in the water, lovingly gazing at Galatea who is passing-by on a sea horse. Two other nymphs are in attendance and a small Amor is standing on the shoulder of the Cyclops, holding reins which are looped around his neck."
