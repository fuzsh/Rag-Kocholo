        "text": "So, this week (#9 of my ‚ÄúDeal Me In 2014‚Äù short story reading challenge) I drew the seven of spades (see my full roster here) and was rewarded with a re-read of a great horror story I first read more than twenty years ago‚Ä¶ Seeing the story‚Äôs title reminded me of something else,\n\nThe case of the never returned short story anthology. üôÇ\n\nIn the late ‚Äò80s/early ‚Äò90s I read an anthology of American horror stories which included one story per state. I remember very little about most of the stories in it these days, but I do remember loaning the book to a friend and never seeing it again. Not a big deal, as I had already read it, but I‚Äôm still not thrilled about it no longer gracing my shelves. There were a couple great stories as I recalled, and when I purchased ‚ÄúThe Weird‚Äù anthology of stories was pleased to see that one of them, ‚ÄúThe Autopsy‚Äù was also included in that collection. I decided I must re-read that story.\n\n(below: author Michael Shea <from Goodreads>)\n\nIn ‚ÄúThe Autopsy‚Äù we meet an aging doctor working in the coroner‚Äôs office. He has cancer, and to add to the misery, he is on a sad errand to perform autopsies on ten miners killed after an explosion in the mine. Why do they need autopsies? Because it is assumed that the explosion was a willful act of murder by one of the ten men. The mining company‚Äôs insurance only has to compensate the families if the miners die in the process of doing their job. Being murdered while at their job? Well, that would save the company a lot of money.\n\nBut the greed of the company and the aging coroner are just the backdrop for a chilling story. What the doctor learns and finds while doing the autopsies is out of this world. Literally."
