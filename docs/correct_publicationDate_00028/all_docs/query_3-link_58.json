        "text": "Introduction to Polyphemus\n\nGoals and Policy\n\nPolyphemus is a Cyclops in Odyssey whose name roughly means \"multiple speeches\". It is consistent with the goals of the system, that is, gathering on the same platform:\n\nseveral models: with Gaussian, Eulerian, Lagrangian ... formulations;\n\nseveral scales: from small/local scale to continental scale;\n\nmultiple polluants: passive, radionuclides, photochemistry, aerosols, ...\n\nprocessing from many inputs (meteorological models, ground data);\n\nmany advanced methods: data assimilation, ensemble forecasting, models coupling, ...\n\nIt is written as much as possible with modern computer languages (mainly C++), and only perennial and scalable developments are included. Polyphemus is open. It is open source, distributed under GNU GPL, well documented (for users and developers), and released on a regular basis. Open also means that contributions from other teams are welcome.\n\nParallel computing is implemented in its main modules. Both OpenMP and MPI API are supported and allow shared-memory, distributed memory or hybrid parallel schemes.\n\nMain Reference\n\nThe main reference for Polyphemus is:\n\n[Reference] \"Technical Note: The air quality modeling system Polyphemus\", V. Mallet, D. Quélo, B. Sportisse, M. Ahmed de Biasi, É. Debry, I. Korsakissok, L. Wu, Y. Roustan, K. Sartelet, M. Tombette and H. Foudhil, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 7 (20), 2007 (bib) [Read it on ACP website ]\n\nPlease cite this paper if you refer to Polyphemus in a publication, a talk or so.\n\nContents in Short\n\nPolyphemus has a rich content which may be summarized with this list (in bold: key components or features):\n\nModels\n\nGaussian models\n\nStationary Gaussian model and puff Gaussian model\n\nGas and aerosols\n\nSeveral parameterizations to compute the dispersion\n\nEulerian models\n\nCastor (clone of the gas version of Chimere): passive and reactive versions\n\nPolair3D: passive, reactive, aerosol and adjoint (for gas) versions\n\nModules for transport, chemistry and aerosols\n\nLagrangian models\n\nBasic stochastic Lagrangian transport without scavenging nor deposition\n\nParticles related to the Horker and Fokker-Planck formulations\n\nDrivers\n\nWhat is a driver?\n\nit implements advanced methods (data assimilation, model coupling, ...) on top of the models\n\nit is developed independently from the underlying model: the model is a black box\n\nit can be applied to any model in the platform providing the model has a sufficient interface\n\nit is also a model: for instance, a driver that couples two models can be seen as a new model\n\nDriver list\n\n\"BaseDriver\": forward simulations\n\n\"StationaryModel\": stationary solutions (for small/local scale)\n\nOptimal interpolation\n\nEnsemble Kalman filter\n\nReduced-rank square root Kalman filter\n\n4D-Var (and adjoint validation)\n\nPlume-in-grid model (couples a Gaussian model and an Eulerian model)\n\nMonte Carlo\n\nPerturbation driver (applying factors to input fields)\n\nModules\n\nTransport\n\nAdvection (DST3, PPM), diffusion (ROS2)\n\nChemistry\n\nRACM, RACM2, CB05, RADM 2, Melchior\n\nRadioactive or biological decay\n\nAerosols\n\nSIREAM (size-resolved module, semi-Lagrangian)\n\nSIREAM-AEC (same as SIREAM, with better treatment of organic matter)\n\nVSRM (clouds)\n\nRadioactive or biological decay\n\nOutput savers\n\nWhole domain, list of points\n\nBoundary conditions (for nesting)\n\nDeposition fluxes, ...\n\nPreprocessing (rough summary)\n\nMeteorological fields\n\nECMWF, MM5, WRF\n\nVertical diffusion: Louis and Troen&Mahrt\n\nGround data\n\nLand use cover: USGS, GLCF\n\nEmissions from EMEP\n\nBiogenic emissions (Simpson et al., 1999), sea salt\n\nDry deposition: Emberson, Wesely and Zhang\n\nBoundary conditions\n\nMozart 2, Inca\n\nGocart\n\nGaussian models (linear sources, deposition, ...)\n\nLibraries\n\nSeldonData\n\nInterpolations, input/output operations, ...\n\nAtmoData\n\nExtension of SeldonData to atmospheric sciences\n\nPhysical parameterizations: meteorology, emissions, aerosols, ...\n\nAtmoPy\n\nVisualization\n\nPostprocessing, statistics\n\nObservations, ensemble forecasts, ...\n\nPolyphemus is distributed with several other resources for the user: test cases, training sessions, a comprehensive user's guide, a scientific documentation for AtmoData, a reference documentation for AtmoPy. In addition, the development team can be contacted at polyphemus-help@liste.enpc.fr. Futhermore, resources are available on this website for new developers.\n\nOther Resources\n\nBelow is the talk given during the Polyphemus training day (27 March 2007). It explains Polyphemus purpose, its structure and its contents:\n\nIntroduction à Polyphemus\n\nIntroduction to Polyphemus (translation)"
