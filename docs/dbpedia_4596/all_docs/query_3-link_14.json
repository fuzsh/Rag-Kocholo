        "text": "From the daily mail -\n\nMiserable Chelsy splits from Prince Harry after three years\n\nChelsy Davy has split from Prince Harry, telling him she 'needs space' to carve out her own identity.\n\nThe party-loving Zimbabwean told friends she was having a 'trial separation' from the Prince while she studies at Leeds University and he pursues his Army career.\n\nThe couple began their separation in the style that has characterised their three-year relationship – partying hard at different nightclubs just a few miles away from each other in London.\n\nChelsy's decision to split from the Prince came less than a week after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the 22-year-old was desperately unhappy in Leeds.\n\nThe news is sure to cause concern to the Queen, who will be worried that the separation, following the on-off romance between Prince William and Kate Middleton, will convince the public that the young Royals, like their parents' generation, are incapable of forming a stable relationship.\n\nChelsy was said to have made a series of tearful telephone calls to the Prince last week – and she later confided to a close friend that Harry had agreed to the \"trial separation\".\n\nA friend close to Chelsy told The Mail on Sunday: \"This is not an over-for-good situation. Chelsy and Harry both love each other very much but Chelsy has had a lot to come to terms with over recent months since moving to the UK and has not found the transition an easy one.\n\n\"She kept saying she needed to take some time out to re-establish herself. She still loves him, but she feels she needs to carve an identity as her own person rather than as Prince Harry's girlfriend.\n\n\"Over recent weeks she's been coming down to London and partying with Harry's friends. They were together at Amika nightclub in Kensington just two weeks ago when Chelsy appeared incredibly down and subdued.\n\n\"She was not her normal partying self. She had confided it was because she was missing Zimbabwe and her family in South Africa but in fact she was having doubts about her relationship with Prince Harry back then.\n\n\"While they care for each other deeply she needs to be able to be her own person. She is pragmatic about the split. They're using it as an opportunity to take a break rather than splitting for good.\"\n\nA senior Palace aide was last night reported to have said: \"The relationship is over. It has simply run its course. Harry will be carrying on his Army career and Chelsy will continue her studies.\"\n\nBut we can reveal today that Harry has had as many problems with his Army career as with his relationship with Chelsy.\n\nHe has told friends that he has threatened to leave the Household Cavalry and concentrate on charity work if he is not sent to Afghanistan to fight with his regiment.\n\nImmediately after the split, Harry was back at Amika, partying hard with a group of five friends on Friday night – one of whom bore a remarkable resemblance to his old friend, TV presenter Natalie Pinkham. \"She looked very pretty,\" said one onlooker.\n\nHe was overheard boasting that he planned to get \"as drunk as possible\" and ran up a £2,500 bar bill in only a few hours. Other guests noticed an ice bucket filled with a magnum of Dom Perignon champagne, at a cost of £400 a bottle.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsy was on the other side of London, partying with friends from Leeds University, where she is studying for her law postgraduate degree.\n\nShe is said to have been concerned about Harry's increasing appetite for alcohol, as well as not feeling able to trust the 23-year-old Prince when he was not by her side. Last week this newspaper revealed that Chelsy's friends in Leeds had become concerned that she was becoming increasingly depressed about her situation.\n\nLess than two months into her two-year course, she appeared to be finding it difficult to settle in and deal with a new country, climate and social scene.\n\nHer mother Beverly had initially stayed in Leeds to help her put down some roots, but she has now flown back to South Africa.\n\nChelsy is said to have found it hard to cope with swapping her privileged upbringing in Zimbabwe, where she has a penthouse apartment and a family ranch, for the dour surroundings of Leeds, where she lives in a redbrick terrace house.\n\nAnd despite travelling 6,000 miles to be closer to her boyfriend, Chelsy has not seen as much of Harry as she might have liked.\n\nThey are still separated by a 200 miles, as he has had duties to perform at his barracks in Windsor with the Household Cavalry, where he holds the rank of Second Lieutenant.\n\nmore gossip...\n\nfrom the daily mail\n\nNow Chelsy is all smiles as Prince Harry plots to win her back\n\nNewly single Chelsy arrived at her university in Leeds yesterday looking glum, but today, her mood has clearly lifted.\n\nShe was all smiles as she faced photographers on her way to the campus wrapped in a stylish black coat.\n\nHer brighter disposition comes as sources reveal Prince Harry has enlisted the help of his close pal Guy Pelly's girlfriend Susanna Warren to try and convince Chelsy to take him back.\n\nThe prince wants Susanna to act as a go-between in a last-ditch effort to build a bridge between the estranged couple.\n\nA well placed source says the South African beauty feels Harry has let her down severely since she moved from Cape Town to Leeds to go to university.\n\nThe source said: \"Chelsy feels isolated and lonely. Harry promised her he'd be there for her at all times, but he barely came to see her in Leeds. He didn't help her as she struggled with the difficulties of moving country, and moving far away from her family and friends.\n\n\"Chelsy basically decided it just wasn't worth it anymore.\"\n\nBut source reveal Susanna Warren, 19, who has become close to Chelsy, is trying to get her to forgive Harry's faults and move on.\n\nSusanna, a student at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, could be the key to getting their three-and-a-half year relationship back on track.\n\nA friend says: \"Susanna is trying to convince Chelsy to treat her planned trip home to South Africa as a short break and time to reconsider, rather than a move back home.\n\n\"Harry hasn't given up hope. He is desperately trying to get Chelsy back and fight for their relationship but he thinks another girl will be better at softening Chelsy at the moment.\"\n\nYesterday, a lank-haired and puffy-eyed, Chelsy was the picture of misery as she trudged through the streets of Leeds.\n\nHer appearance suggested that she had either spent the weekend in tears - or followed her ex-boyfriend's example by drowning her sorrows.\n\nAlthough it was Chelsy, 22, who decided to call time on the romance - telling friends she needed space to \"be herself\" - it is clear that the end of her three-year romance with the prince had taken its toll.\n\nReports have claimed that she found texts from a mystery woman on Harry's phone. She is said to have discovered the messages after overhearing him having a whispered conversation.\n\nThe Zimbabwean-born student, who gave up a life of luxury in Cape Town to be closer to Harry, says the move has made her \"utterly miserable\".\n\nIn particular, she is struggling to settle in at Leeds University, where she shares grimy £50-aweek student digs and is studying for a postgraduate degree in law.\n\nFriends say she is ready to quit the course and could move back to Cape Town, where her father has already bought her a £350,000 waterfront apartment.\n\nYesterday she surfaced shortly before 10am and headed for the university campus, meeting on the way a girl friend who hugged her and asked how she was. \"OK\", was the tearful reply.\n\nShe managed to eat a sandwich in the Student Union bar before going to the law faculty for an afternoon lecture.\n\nBlues and Royals officer Harry was back at his barracks in Windsor yesterday, although friends said he had been in regular touch with Chelsy.\n\n\"Chelsy was - and still is - the love of his life,\" said one. \"He will be gutted to see her looking like the weight of the world is on her shoulders.\"\n\nOver the weekend there was speculation that the prince might already had his eye on someone else after being photographed with a leggy brunette on Friday night.\n\nWe can reveal, however, that she is make-up artist Charlotte Cowen - and she is dating one of his best friends.\n\nMiss Cowen, 25, is the girlfriend of Arthur Landon, son of the infamous \"White Sultan\", Brigadier Tim Landon, who died in August from lung cancer. He made &£500million as an adventurer and arms dealer in oil-rich Oman.\n\nArthur, who will inherit much of his father's fortune, is an old friend of the prince and met up with him at the London nightclub Amika.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=493068&in_page_id=1770"
