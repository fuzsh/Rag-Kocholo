        "text": "'Oh, hello there, Spunky.' Do not be alarmed, dear reader - we are not suggesting you have had an unfortunate incident, or are in fact an exceptionally plucky person. We are merely trying to illustrate the confusion that might be felt on witnessing certain Sloane interactions on the King's Road. Because 'Spunky' - like 'Dingo', 'Fastly', 'Minnow' and 'Piggers' - is an acceptable, nay common, nickname.\n\nMost Sloanes have nicknames. There's 'Bunter' Somerset and his sister 'Monster'; there's 'Flea' St George (née Brudenell-Bruce), and 'Flops' Cameron; there's 'Nick Nock' Palmer (as he even called himself on his own wedding RSVP card) and - really requiring a\n\nsense of humour - 'Loony' Cayzer. So you see,\n\nPG Wodehouse (himself nicknamed 'Plum')\n\nwas not overegging the pudding with his characters' names. 'Stinker', 'Oofy', 'Pongo',\n\n'Little Bingo', 'Stiffy', 'Catsmeat', 'Kipper' and 'Tuppy' - these are entry-level stuff.\n\nAnd school, especially boarding school, is often the source of such names. They can be descriptive: 'Copperknob' (Winston Churchill,\n\nFYI, at Harrow, as a result of his red hair); or 'Knobbles' (as Christine Dickinson is known\n\ndue to her knees); or based on character traits - one OE, for example, is still affectionately known to his chums, a decade after leaving school, as 'The Bum', due to his laziness.\n\nAll of this is partly to compensate for the lack of individuality in an environment\n\nwhere people are only called by their surnames. Boredom and silliness and long nights in dormitories are also factors. And, if we are going to get sociological about it, there is also the influence of a gang mentality. Nicknames are rife in other male-dominated peer groups, such as the Mafia and, um, Jackass. Nicknames suggest acceptance into the gang - be known as 'Joey Bananas' and you're a made man.\n\nAnd what's the ultimate gang to be in? Family, of course. So, if a 'Binky' wasn't picked up at school, you can be certain it was grown and watered in family soil. Take Diana Mitford. No one in her family ever bothered to call her Diana - her mother Sydney called her 'Dana'; her father David referred to her as 'Dina'; and... as for her sisters? Nancy preferred to\n\nuse 'Bodley', Pam and Unity coined the name 'Nardy', and the youngest, Deborah, the late Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, called her 'Honks'. Deborah herself was, of course, known as 'Debo' to the world in general, but her sisters' letters to her at Chatsworth were addressed\n\nto 'Nine', due to her apparent 'mental age'. And the Mitfords aren't the only family keen on nicknames. You need only look to Charlie Mortimer's bestseller Dear Lupin to discover that his sister is known as 'Lumpy' (occasionally 'Plumpling', sometimes the 'Lump with the Hump'), whilst his mother was called 'Nidnod' (due to her fondness for a tipple). And then there's the three Hohler sisters: 'Felix', 'Tibs' and 'Minka' (though in reality they're Ophelia, Emily and Isobel).\n\nIf you want to get even more confused about Cressida Bonas's extended family, you could refer to her half-siblings Jacobi Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe and Isabella Branson as 'Cozy' and 'Bellie', while her half-sister Gabriella Wilde is known as 'Bumpy' (via her starter nickname, 'Bumble Bee').\n\nFlea B-B's name comes from her family too - it was initially 'Flee Fly Flo Flum' - though being the youngest of her clan of four, she says, she suffered a whole lot of rather less kind nicknames: ' Runt', 'Grunter' and - 'the worst' - 'Bogey'. As for 'Wiz' Bowlby... well, her nickname came about because, as her sister Molly explains, she 'used to wiz around a lot'. But why do nicknames happen and why do they persist? Perhaps it is down to a lack of emotional interaction - a tradition passed on by many a nanny-reared generation. Or perhaps it's even more obvious than that. There's no greater social crime than not to be amusing. So the bestowing of nicknames is meant to be funny, even when they are cruel. And the wackier the nickname, the more it shows good, old-fashioned Sloane eccentricity.\n\nAnd so Flea and Wiz are known as Flea and Wiz not just by their families, but by their whole 'extended family'- the ever-growing gang picked up over gap years, during days as a student up in Edinburgh or on one of many country- house weekends. Because nicknames last all your life (longer than reputations and many marriages) and, as in the case of huntress 'Migs' (Margaret) Greenall, can even end up as the name on top of your obituary, as hers was in The Telegraph. But although nicknames are never totally shaken, they can become elaborated over time - as 'Wiz', 'Wiz Bang' and 'Wizzle Kicks' points out. There is one exception, though, Wiz declares - the office, where they refer to her by her Christian name: Olivia.\n\nSo is that where nicknames have the ripcord pulled on them? Work? Well, as one OE (and CEO) points out, 'You can't go round calling yourself \"Mash\" in meetings.' And you suspect that 'The Bum' won't choose to introduce himself to any future fathers-in-law as that. But, if he's lucky, his future mother-in-law might give him a new nickname: 'The Botty', perhaps. It'll be her way of saying 'Welcome to the gang.'"
