Wilde did not seek spousal support, and they reached a private agreement on property division.[74]\n\nWilde began dating actor Jason Sudeikis in November 2011.[75] They became engaged in January 2013.[76][77] They have two children: a son, born in 2014,[78] and a daughter, born in 2016.[79] Sudeikis and Wilde's relationship ended in November 2020.[80] Wilde was publicly served with court documents regarding child custody while she was presenting Don't Worry Darling at CinemaCon 2022.[81]\n\nIn January 2021, Wilde began dating singer Harry Styles after they met during the filming of Don't Worry Darling.[82][83] Their relationship ended in November 2022.[84]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Award Category Work Result 2006 The Comedy Festival Best Actress[citation needed] Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas Won 2008 Teen Choice Awards Choice TV Breakout Star Female House Nominated Vail Film Festival Rising Star Award[citation needed] Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas Won 2009 Screen Actors Guild Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series House Nominated Teen Choice Awards Choice TV Actress: Drama Nominated 2010 Teen Choice Awards Choice TV Actress: Drama Nominated 2011 MTV Movie Awards Best Breakout Star Tron: Legacy Nominated Teen Choice Awards Choice Movie Breakout Female Nominated Choice TV Actress: Drama House Nominated 2013 Teen Choice Awards Choice Movie Actress: Comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Nominated 2020 Independent Spirit Awards Best First Feature Booksmart Won 2020 Gotham Awards Breakthrough Director Nominated Audience Award Nominated\n\nSee also\n\nList of female film and television directors\n\nReferences"
