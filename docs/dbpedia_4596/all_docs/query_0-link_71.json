        "text": "First love spawns intense feelings, rash decision, and in the case of Endless Love, one immortal song. A remake of the 1981 movie is (predictably) out in theaters tomorrow. And although it doesn't seem like the basic premise of melodramatic teenage infatuation has changed, the hair, wardrobe, setting, and just about everything else, have. Here's how young love looks 32 years later.\n\nTHE BEAUTY LOOK\n\nThen: Brooke Shields played Jade Butterfield with full, wavy hair, and, of course, full, dark eyebrows.\n\nNow: Gabriella Wilde's Jade has beachy blonde waves and romantic princess braids.\n\nTHE STAR POWER\n\nThen: Just 16 when the film was released, Shields was already famous as a model and as an actress, playing a child prostitute in Pretty Baby and beach-stranded, topless teen in The Blue Lagoon.\n\nNow: Wilde is a 24-year-old Brit with ties to nobility (real name: Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe).\n\nTHE BOY\n\nThen: In his only big role, Martin Hewitt played David Axelrod, a high schooler who whispers sweet nothings in French.\n\nNow: In the reboot, David is a buff bad boy portrayed by Magic Mike's Alex Pettyfer, who also happens to be British.\n\nTHE LIFESTYLE PORN\n\nThen: The Butterfield residence, a charming old house filled with trinkets and knick-knacks, is the destination for underage house parties.\n\nNow: Gated brick mansion; Maserati; summer getaway—the Butterfields seem to be splashy new money for the Internet age.\n\nTHE MOOD MUSIC\n\nThen: The Diana Ross-Lionel Richie ballad was Billboard's most successful duet and soundtrack single of all time.\n\nNow: The trailer features Skylar Grey's dramatic, breathy cover of Robert Palmer's 1986 hit \"Addicted to Love.\" Nothing says, \"I love you, baby\" like an 80's rock tune.\n\nTHE LOVE SCENE\n\nThen: They have sex by a fireplace.\n\nNow: Based on some very un-scientific movie trailer analysis, yep, them too.\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\n• Romance Is My Day Job: Behind Harlequin's Covers\n\n• New Study: Love Really Can Make Life Sweeter"
