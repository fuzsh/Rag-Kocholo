Digitized by Google DEDICATION TO HER ROYAL HIGHNESS VICTORIA-MARY-LOUISA, DUCHESS OF KENT. Madam, In continuing most respectfully to dedicate this work to your Royal Highness, we entreat you to accept our humble and sincere thanks for the distinguished favour your Royal Highness has, during so long a period, vouchsafed towards it, to the effects of which we trace, with renewed gratitude and pride, the high honour of our beloved Sovereign’s spontaneous patronage, and the gratifying privilege of announcing it in our Title Page, most graciously accorded. That your Royal Highness may long live in the enjoys ment of health and happiness, witnessing with delight the flourishing condition of your august descendants on and around the Throne of these Realms, and possessing in fullest measure that high estimation which the exemplary virtues of the female character never fail to ensure from the British Public, is, Madam, the ardent Prayer of Your Royal Highness’s Most grateful and devoted Servants, Anne, Eliza, and Maria Innes, Editors. PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. It may be proper to remark, that the present work, founded on the personal communications of the Nobility, is classed in two volumes, — the one comprising the living subjects of the British Peerage, including their Collateral Branches, (a feature peculiar to this work,) and the other exhibiting concise historical sketches of their Ancestrv and Families. The obvious advantage of this mode of publication will be found in the option which it affords to purchasers. Each volume may be considered either as a whole or as a moiety, for each is in its peculiar character and import perfect; and he who is once possessed of that which, for the sake of distinction, in reference, it has been thought fit to denominate “ The Genealogical Volume,” the contents of which, as matters of History, are necessarily permanent, may always, at a reduced and comparatively small charge, efficiently retain the entire work by the addition of that which will be found referred to by the title of “ The Peerage,” and which the course of events will unavoidably require to be occasionally replaced by a revised copy. EDMUND LODGE, Norhoy College of Arms, 1832 t > Digitized by Google PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. The fact that two large impressions of this work have been very rapidly exhausted, cannot but be considered as a flattering testimony of its general utility. To render the present new edition yet more worthy of public attention and approbation, its pages have beon again submitted to the revision of the noble families of which it treats, who have again condescended to grant their aid to ensure its correctness ; and for this favour the Editor feels it to be his duty to tender his most grateful acknowledg- ments. On the publication, therefore, of this improved edition, he is sensible that it is not only as a token of sincere respect, but as an act of justice to the numerous communications with which he has been honoured, that he is bound thus to express his obligation, and to ciaim for Uie work a reputa- tion for authenticity, perhaps never equalled, certainly never exceeded, oy any publication of a similar nature. EDMUND LODGE, Norroy. College of Arms, Nov. 20, 1833. PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. A very short Prefatory explanation to this Sixth Edition seems to be required. The constantly increasing demand for this publication in each succeeding year, is a proof of the general estimation in which it is held, too gratifying to be doubted. At the suggestion of many of its noble Patrons are introduced in this Edition the Armorial Bearings of the Peers, beauti- fully engraved, and incorporated with the text, — the only feature which seems to have been wanting to render the work perfect In acknowledging the numerous communications with which he continues to be favoured and honoured, the Editor begs leave to state, that as the Type for the entire work is now kept constantly standing, (a measure never before accomplished,) every alteration in each successive Edition will be introduced in tne projier place, down to the date of publication. EDMUND LODGE, Norroy. College of Arms, Nov. 22, 1836. ADVERTISEMENT TO THE NINTH EDITION. The following from among many other Letters received during the progress of the present Edition is here inserted, chiefly on account of the important suggestion it contains, though, at the same time, with a grateful acknowledgment of the favour shown to the unremitting labour which has been, and will continue to be, devoted to this Work, in order to ensure its continued accuracy in each of its sue cessive Editions : — “ Lord presents his compliments to Mr. Lodge. and begs to assure him that he has looked over the enclosed paper with great care and attention, and finds it perfectly correct. Lord hopes Mr. Lodge will permit him to add, that he has never yet found so few mistakes in any publication of the kind as in his last Edition ; and if every Peer will carefully correct the paper Mr. Lodge sends him,* a Good and Correct Peerage will at last be pub- lished. “ July 27, 1839.” * This favour, which has been so generally experienced in the progress of the present Edition, is gratefully acknowledged, and induces a hope that the suggestion here thrown out, with such high sanction, will be adopted on all future occasions, insuring the result so justly anticipated by the noble writer ADVERTISEMENT TO THE THIRTEENTH EDITION. rL he Editors return thanks for the numerous Communica- tions of the Nobility, especially for those recently received, by means of which this Peerage is enabled to maintain its reputation for Authenticity and Correctness, and ear- nestly request a continuance of such favours. In these Communications, a desire has been frequently expressed that to the name of any Gentleman mentioned m the respective pedigrees, that of his Seat should be appended ; and the Editors beg respectfully to assure their noble Correspondents that from the first they have not only been anxious to gratify this wish, but have been fully aware of the great advantage in respect of identity and consequent accuracy to be derived from so desirable an addition ; the adoption of which has been prevented solely by the extent of the Work and its consequent heavy expense ; and in adverting to this fact, they feel assured that their unwearied watchfulness over the conti- nual correction of its ever-varying details, will exonerate them from any suspicion of shrinking from the extra labour involved in such a change of plan. But the an- nually increasing claims of this valuable Correspondence have at length obtained an influence so preponderating, xiii Digitized by Google as to determine the Publishers to comply, at all risks, with the general wish. Together with this desideratum, the Editors have, in the present Edition, further enlarged the work, by the inser- tion of an “ Historical View of the British Peerage ,” derived from authentic sources, and the Roll of the House of Peers, as ordered by their Lordships to be printed. These, they venture to believe, will be received as proofs of their desire to render the work as perfect a vehicle of information as possible, in testimony of their high sense of the distinguished patronage with which it continues to be honoured. For the Arms of the Prince of Wales, which were first Engraved for this Work in the Edition of 1842, the Editors are indebted to the condescension of His Royal Highness Prince Albert, who kindly favoured them with the authen- ticated copy from which the Engraving is taken. w?

The Peerage divides itself primarily into the two classes of Lords Spiritual and Temporal. Secondly, into such as in virtue of their peerages, have seats and votes in the Lords, or Upper House of Parliament; and those in whom the right of so sitting and voting is inherent, but is called into operation through the election of a certain number by their colleagues. Thus the temporal and spiritual Peers of the realm of England all sit by virtue of their creation or consecration. The temporal Peers of Scotland have each a vote in the election of sixteen members of their body, to represent the whole during the continuance of each distinct parliament The temporal Peers of Ireland, immediately after the passing of the Act of Union, elected under its authority, in the same manner, but for life, twenty-eight representatives ; and the right of election has subsequently been exercised to supply, from time to time, the deficiency created in the representation by death. The spiritual Peers of Ireland are represented in parliament, not by election, but by rotation ; the two Archbishops sitting alternate years, and three Bishops in annual rotation. Since the completion of the Imperial Parliament by these two Acts of Union, every newly-created Peer (except the new Peers of Ireland, of whom one is created under the Act on the extinction of three Irish Peerages) has been denoroi- xvii c Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF nated a Peer of the United Kingdom, and has the right of sitting inherent from his creation. Also the Peers of Great Britain ixeated subsequently to the Act of Union between England and Scotland, in 1707, and prior to that between Great Britain and Ireland, in 1800, take their seats in the House of Lords in right of their creation. The several distinctions — namely, of the Peerage of England, of Great Britain, of the United Kingdom, of Scotland, and of Ireland — are noticed in this Work in describing the titles of each Peer, and also whether the present possessor of a Scotch or Irish Peerage is a Representative in Parliament of his class. The Imperial Peerage of Great Britain is hereditary, and in the nature of its inheritance follows the same mode of descent with the Crown, from which, as the fountain of all honour within the Empire, it emanates ; but with this differ- ence, that whereas, in the descent of the Crown, the rule of primogeniture obtains in both sexes, in that of a Peerage the heirship in females of the same degree is co-equal. But as the power which gives has also the unalienable right of limiting the gift, such course of inheritance prevails only where the grant of the Peerage is without limit, as in those titles which originate in a summons to Parliament without a patent of creation. But in modem times it is usual for the Crown, in granting this high honour, to do so by letters- patent under the Great Seal ; which instrument of creation also points out the line of inheritance, and most commonly in the male heirs of the body of the first Grantee. The following is the ceremony in use in admitting a Peer into the House of Lords. After the Peers have taken their seats, the Lord Chancellor being on the woolsack, Garter King at Arms, attired in his tabard, and bare-headed, comes into the House of Lords bearing the Patent, (if there be one,) and writ of summons of the Peer to be introduced ; who then follows between two Peers of his own rank, attired in their Robes of Estate, and is led by them up to the Lord Chancellor, to whom he makes obeisance; Garter then xviii Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. presents the Patent and writ of summons to the Lord Chan- cellor, who directs the same to be read ; this being done, the oaths are administered to the new Peer, and the Chancellor dismisses him to take his seat, to which he is directed by the two noblemen who introduce him, Garter leading the wray. The writ is then delivered by the Lord Chancellor to the Clerk of the House, to be laid up. The new Peer forthwith rises from his seat and returns to the Lord Chancellor, who congratulates him on becoming a member of the House of Peers, or on his elevation to the dignity of the Peerage, as the case may be. The Peers, by their privileges as a body, cannot be arrested and taken into custody, unless for an indictable offence ; this being a privilege of Parliament, they hold it in common with the members of the Lower House, except that the privilege of a Commoner ceases within a limited period after the dissolution of Parliament, w’hile that of a Peer is perpetual. Also to assault by violence a member of either House, or his menial servant, is a high contempt of Parliament, and would there be punished with severity. Peers are not subject to make answer to questions from the Lower House of Parliament. As Peers of Parliament, they are entitled to vote by proxy ; the proxy being always given to a Lord of Parliament, styled the Procurator, for his Principal ; which Procurator must be a spiritual for a spiritual, a temporal for a temporal Lord. Each Peer may also, with leave of the House, enter his protest upon the journals, expressing his dissent from any vote that has passed the House, with his reasons for such dissent. All bills that may in their consequences any way affect the right of Peerage, are, by the custom of Parliament, to have their first rise and beginning in the House of Lords, and to suffer no changes or amendments in the House of Commons. Another very ancient privilege of the Peerage, which now appears to have fallen into disuse, is declared by the Charter of the Forest, confirmed in Parliament, 9th Henry III.; xix r 2 Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF namely, that every Lord spiritual or temporal summoned to Parliament, and passing through the King’s forests, may, both in going and returning, kill one or two of the King’s deer without warrant, in view of the forester if he be present, or on blowing a horn if he be absent ; that he may not seem to take the King’s venison by stealth. The very important privilege of franking letters, which till lately the Peers possessed in common with the members of the Lower House of Parliament, all have magnanimously abandoned, on behalf of the great boon conceded to the com- munity at large by the New Postage Act. The privileges above enumerated belong to the Peers in their capacity of Members of Parliament, they also possess others attached to their personal dignity. In common with all the subjects of the realm, they can be tried only by their Peers ; thus a Commoner is tried by a jury of Commoners, but a Lord of Parliament, when crimi- nally arraigned — that is, in cases of felony, treason, or mis- prision of treason — has this especial privilege, that all his Peers are summoned to the trial, and he is acquitted or condemned by the verdict of the majority; which is given, not upon oath, as in the case of legal juries, but in the form, “ Guilty — or, Not guilty — upon my honour;” pronounced by each Peer in his place, in answer to the question severally put by the Lord Steward, who presides in the Court, be- ginning with the youngest Baron, and proceeding to the first Duke or senior Prince of the Blood Royal. A Peer also answers to bills in Chancery upon his honour, and not upon his oath; but when he is examined as a witness either in civil or criminal cases, or in the High Court of Par- liament, he must be sworn. On all charges of misdemeanor, however, as libels, riots, perjury, conspiracy, &c., a Peer is tried, like a commoner, by a jury. But he cannot be bound over to keep the peace in any other place than the Courts of Queen’s Bench and Chancery. And the honour of Peers is so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them, and cert in other great XX Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. officers of the realm, than of other men ; scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of scandalum rnag- ruitum , and subjected to punishment by divers ancient statutes. Peers are exempted fiom attending Court Leets or on the posse comitatus. A Peer cannot lose his Nobility but by death or at- tainder ; except, indeed, if he wastes his estate, so that he is not able to support his dignity, it has been said by the old writers that the King may degrade him: later authorities, however, expressly hold that a Peer cannot be degraded except by Act of Parliament ; and there is but one instance of the exercise of this supreme jurisdiction, which was in the case pf George Neville, Duke of Bedford, in the reign of Edward IV. In the case of forfeiture by attainder, an important differ- ence exists in the operation of the attainder, according as it may be for high treason or felony. A person upon whom judgment of high treason is pronounced, or who is outlawed upon an indictment of high treason, is said to be attainted of high treason, and his honours are forfeited to the crown for ever. Nothing but a reversal of such act of attainder by Parliament will restore a Peer so attainted, or his pos- terity, to the dignity thus forfeited ; nor in the event of the issue of the body of the person attainted failing, will the descendants of the person who was first created to the Peerage be admitted to it, without a removal of the attainder by which it was forfeited. Dignities created either by writ or by patent become thus forfeited by an attainder for high treason ; but by an attainder for felony an entailed dignity is not forfeited, though a dignity created by writ, and descendible to heirs- general, is forfeited by such attainder of the person possessed of it. There is also a material difference in the effect of an at- tainder for high treason, between a dignity created by ietters-patent, and one which originates in a writ of sum mons. If the eldest son of a Baron, holding his dignity by rxi Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF writ, or other person within the line of inheritance, is at- tainted of high treason, if he or his posterity should after- wards become entitled to the honour, by the decease of his father or other predecessors, the title so falling upon an attainted person becomes equally forfeited, as if he had pos- sessed it at the time of his attainder, and so would remain as long as any descendants from him were in existence, but would revive on the extinction of his issue, in favour of any heir whose claim to it would not have been derived through the attainted person. But in the case of an heir to a title by letters-patent being attainted of high treason, and dying before those persons whose title to the dignity was prior to his, the attainder would not prevent such dignity from afterwards falling upon the descendants of the person so attainted. Having thus considered the principal circumstances in- cident to the Nobility at large, whether as a body or in- dividually, it remains to take a view of such points as relate respectively to each grade of the Peerage, from the Princes of the Blood Royal to the Barons; which title, though lowest in rank, formerly gave name to the whole Order, in the same manner as it is now spoken of under the generic appellation of Peers. Prince of Wales’s Coronet. Princess Royal’s Coronet. PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL. In England, the Sovereign’s sons, except the eldest, are of no other account in the constitution than by the dignity they derive from their near connexion with the reigning Monarch and the possibility of their ascending the throne, or giving to it a future heir. They have no appanages xxii Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. allotted to them ; no titles of honour reserved for them ; they are known only by the princely rank their birth secures to them, until it is the pleasure of the Crown to give them a seat or a voice in the great council of the nation, by conferring a Peerage on them of its free grace and favour. Nevertheless, so high is the respect in which the Majesty of these realms is held, that especial honours are paid to all the children of the Crown ; they take precedence of all other subjects, are addressed by the style of Royal Highness, are served at table on the bended knee, except in presence of the Sovereign ; all subjects are to uncover their heads in their presence, and to kneel when admitted to kiss their hands. The origin of the title of Prince of Wales and others ap- pertaining to the royal infant (whom may Heaven preserve I) the heir-apparent of our gracious Queen, are stated at length in their appropriate place, but it may be here proper to notice the style borne by the sons of our Kings before the principality became annexed to the Crown of England. In the Saxon times, the eldest and others of the King’s sons are met with in subscriptions to public documents under the denomination of Clitones , derived (according to Selden) “ from xXeror, that is, illustrious : the affectation of making words out of wrhat little Greek they had, being fre- quent in Eugland at that period.” But a more common title for the sons of the Kings, and borne especially by the eldest, was the Saxon word to the same purport, Atheling , signifying literally, one bom of him that is noble. And when, about the time of Athelstan, the Danish word Eorle was introduced, it was not, as afterwards, synonymous with Earldorman, but applied exclusively to Princes of the blood royal. After the Norman Conquest, the younger sons of the King usually bore the title of Prince simply, until created to Earldoms, or until, as frequently occurred, they acquired such honours by marriage with heiresses, who, in those early times, were supposed to convey them to their husbands ; and xxiii A Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF if the title was not perfectly good, it was easily supplied by a new creation. The earliest instances recorded of both these cases are in the sons of King Plenry II., of whom Geoffrey, fourth son, is styled Earl of Richmond, from his marriage with Constance, daughter and heir of Conan, Earl of Bretagne and Richmond ; and John, fifth son, (afterwards King,) bore the title of Earl of Cornwall, and having married Isabel, a co-heiress of the Earl of Gloucester, obtained his creation to that title from his father, in the thirty-fourth year of King Plenry II. After this time, the younger sons of the Kings were constantly provided for by the investi- ture of some great Earldom with its broad domains, till Edward III. added to the Earldoms with which his younger sons had been previously portioned, the title of Duke, which has since been usually accorded to the younger Princes ; but the period of their creation is altogether arbitrary, the crea- tion itself being a grace from the Crown, and by no means a matter of right. The last century, indeed, and the sway of the House of Brunswick, afford evidence of the total want of uniformity in those creations ; for whereas the Prince William- Augustus, second son of King George II., was by his grandfather, King George I., created Duke of Cumber- land, when in the sixth year of his age, in 1726; Prince Edward, fourth son of King George III., and father of our present most gracious Queen, was not created Duke of Kent till 1799, after he had completed his thirty-first year; until which time his Royal Highness had no political place in the realm, nor other title than that of Prince, to which, in common with all the royal family, his birth en- titled him. Prince Robert, the eldest son of William the Conqueror, bore no peculiar title till, by the death of his father, he became Duke of Normandy. Prince William, only son of Henry I., had no other title. Henry II. gave a crown and the rank of King to his eldest son Henry, who died before him ; and the King, warned by the ill effect of this eleva- tion, which had been the fruitful source of trouble and xxiv Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. rebellions, refrained from giving to Prince Richard, who was Earl of Poictiers in France, and by the decease of his brother became heir apparent to the Crown, any increase of power or title. From that time the King’s eldest son is not known in history by any distinctive appellation, till, by the death of Prince Alphonso, eldest son of Edward L, his brother Edward, previously created Prince of Wales, became heir to the throne. Edward IIL never was Prince of Wales, but he gave the investiture of the principality to his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince ; and this has ever since been the title of the eldest son of the Crown of England. The present infant Prince is only the ninth who, born in the purple, has received the title in his infancy. The eight who have preceded him arc Edward, above-mentioned, afterwards King Edward II. Edward, son of King IIenry VI. Edward, afterwards King Edward V. Arthur, son of King Henry VH. Edward, afterwards King Edward VL Charles, afterwards King Charles II. James, son of King James II. George, afterwards King George IV. The Prince of Wales, who is also born Duke of Cornwall, and by creation is Earl of Chester, is of age from his birth, and a chair of state is placed for him on the right of the throne in the House of Lords. He is also, in right of his birth, a Knight of the Garter ; and all the King’s sons, who are elected Knights of the most Noble Order, it is expressly provided by the statutes, should be independent of the number twenty-five, of which the order consists. The Sove- reign’s younger sons and grandsons, when created Peers, are entitled to seats in the House of Lords, at the left hand of the throne ; but when, by the death of their father, they become only collaterally related to the Crown, they take their places as first upon the Ducal bench. The Royal Marriage Act of the 12th of George III. renders all marriages of the descendants of George II. (other than the issue of Princesses married into foreign families) XXV Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF null and void, unless solemnized with the previous consent of the Crown, signified under the great seal The robe of estate of the Prince of Wales is of purple velvet lined with ermine, and trimmed with a cape of ermine descending from the neck to the elbow, distin- guished by five rows of ermine tails. His cap is of velvet, turned up with ermine, and having a tassel of gold on the crown. Over it is worn a coronet composed of a circlet of gold enriched with jewels ; above its upper rim rise four fleur-de-lis and four crosses-pattee alternately; from them an arched diadem of gold crosses the head, and is finished at top with a ball surmounted by a cross pattee. This coronet is engraved at the head of the present article It is, in fact, the same as the imperial crown, with the difference of having but one diadem, instead of that one being crossed, as in the crown, by a second. The coronet appertaining to the younger sons of the Sovereign differs from that of the Prince of Wales only by the omission of the diadem and the ball and cross which surmount it. That for the Queen’s daughters has two strawberry leaves in the place of two of the four fleur-de-lis above the rim of the circlet ; otherwise it is the same as that of their younger brothers ; this coronet is also represented above. The nephews and nieces of the Crown have their coronets differenced by the substitution of four strawberry leaves for the four fleur-de-lis. A Duke’s Coronet. DUKES. The title of Duke, though first in rank, and in its denva- THE PEERAGE. tion the most ancient, is much later in its introduction to our hereditary Peerage than that of Earl and Baron. The word is found almost literally in the Latin Dux , which in ancient Rome signified the leader of an army, but in the Lower Empire became the title of a local military Lieutenant of the Emperor; and in this sense was trans- ferred to the Western Empire, under the Franks and Ger- mans, but speedily grew in the latter into the designation of hereditary feudal rank and power, inferior only to that of a King. Among our Saxon ancestors the title was in fre- quent use in its Latin military sense ; it is given by Ethel- werd (a Saxon writer) to Uengist, the first Saxon invader of Britain ; and in another old Saxon manuscript the brothers Uengist and Horsa are called Heretoga, the same word, Herzog , still signifying a Duke in Germany ; and in the above-mentioned manuscript it is used in its ancient proper sense, of the leader of an army. Here, also, the title soon acquired a territorial signification, and in the earlier Saxon documents is subscribed as synonymous with Comes or Earldormen, till the reign of Canute ; when the Danish word Eorle began to prevail, but did not entirely supersede the more ancient term before the time of the Normans ; for Henry of Huntingdon calls Godwin (the father of King Harold) Dux. After the Norman Conquest, which changed the military polity of the nation, the Kings themselves continuing for many generations Dukes of Normandy, they would not honour any subjects with the title of Duke, till the time of Edward III., who, claiming to be King of France, and thereby merging the Ducal in the .Royal dignity, in the eleventh year of his reign created his son, Edward the Black Prince, Duke of Cornwall; and many, of the royal family especially, were afterwards raised to the like honour. u However, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a.d. 1572, the whole order,” says Judge Blackstone, “ became utterly extinct” But this expression requires some qualification; for, though the attainder of the Duke of Norfolk, in that xxvii Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF year did for the time extinguish the highest grade of the Peerage, yet it contained in itself the principle of vitality. Philip, son and heir of the attainted Duke of Norfolk, suc- ceeded, in 1579, to the ancient Earldom of Arundel, and had summons to Parliament accordingly ; he was restored in blood, but without the restoration of the forfeited honours, and his son and grandson continued to bear the title of Earl of Arundel ; but the Dukedom was restored by Charles II. in 1664, with its original precedency: and at the period in question, the heir of the Dukedom of Somerset, forfeited by the attainder of the Protector, enjoyed the honours of the Peerage ; the son of the attainted Duke having been created Earl of Hertford in the first year of Queen Elizabeth, and all the family titles were also restored to his descendant in the 1st of Charles IT. Soon after the temporary suspension of the Ducal title in England, King James VI., then reigning in Scotland, be- stowed it, for the first time in that kingdom, (with some unimportant and temporary exceptions,) on a subject not the son of a King ; the Nobleman so advanced being Esme Stuart, Earl of Lennox, the King’s near relation on the father’s side, whom, in 1581, he created Duke of Lennox. The same King having acquired the sovereignty of the three kingdoms, by succeeding to the throne of Elizabeth after her decease, under the name of James I., revived this order in England in 1623, by raising Ludowick, second Duke of Lennox, to the rank of Duke of Richmond ; and the following day bestowed the same honour on his favourite, George Villiers, whom he created Duke of Buckingham. James added no other Dukes to the Peerage ; and great as was the need of his son, King Charles, for the support of his most powerful nobles, he refrained from increasing this small number in England, though he renewed the title of Duke of Richmond to James Stuart, the brother and heir of the first Duke, on whose death it had become extinct by the failure of issue male ; and in Scotland he created the Duke of Hamilton only. The Ducal dignity existed at the xxviii THE PEERAGE. restoration of Charles II/ in no families but these three. But that Monarch, prodigal in all things, not only restored the two forfeited Dukedoms of Norfolk and Somerset, but gave new patents for the title with unsparing hand, espe- cially to his illegitimate sons. Five English and three Scotch Dukedoms of this reign arc still in existence, though two of the latter merge in the superior titles of Richmond and Buccleuch. The only Duke that Ireland has ever had is the existing family of Fitzgerald, Duke of Leinster, so created by King George III. in 1766. In heraldic documents, a Duke is styled the High, Puis- sant, and Most Noble Prince ; his general style is His Grace, and Most Noble : in letters of form he is addressed, “ My Lord Duke, may it please your Grace.” The coronation-robe of a Duke, and that in which he would be invested, wrere not the ceremonies of investiture now dispensed with in the patents of creation, is — a mantle of crimson velvet, lined with white taffeta, and trimmed with a cape of ermine reaching from the neck to the elbow, distin- guished by four rows of black spots. His parliamentary- robe is of fine scarlet cloth, lined with taffeta, and doubled with four guards of ermine at equal distances, w'ith gold lace above each guard, and is tied up to the left shoulder with w’hite ribbon. His cap is of crimson velvet, lined with ermine, having a gold tassel on the top. His coronet, worn over the cap, is a circlet of gold enriched with jewels, and set round with eight golden strawberry leaves rising from its upper rim. The eldest son of a Duke, though in law only an Esquire, takes by courtesy his father’s second title, and is legally styled thus — “ Henry Granville Fitzalan Howard, Esq., commonly called Earl of Arundel and Surrey;” — but to whatever grade of the Peerage that title may belong, he ranks next after the Marquises. The Duke’s daughters and younger sons take by courtesy the title of Lady or Lord, before their Christian and surnames, and are styled in law. XXIX HISTORICAL VIEW OF “ Mary Charlotte Fitzalan Howard, commonly called Lady Mary Charlotte Fitzalan Howard or “ Edward George Fitzalan Howard, Esq., commonly called Lord Edward George Fitzalan Howard,” and all the children bear also by courtesy the style of Right Honourable. marquises. The word Marchio was, in the Saxon and early Norman periods of our history, applied to the Baron or Earl whose office it was to preserve the frontier, (as on the borders of Wales or Scotland,) usually called the Marches, free from the inroads of an enemy : so in Germany the Count or Graf of the border is called Markgraf. As distinguished from other titles of honour, it was unknown in this country till, in 1386, Richard II. created his favourite, Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, Marquis of Dublin, and gave him prece- dence between the degrees of Duke and Earl. From that time it occurs very sparingly in the lists of the Peerage, and seems most frequently to have been little more than a step to the higher honours of the Dukedom, and otherwise to have been peculiarly liable to extinction; for in the long period of 500 years from the date of that first creation, only in twelve instances has the title of Marquis existed as the chief honour of its possessor for a longer term than five years. The first Marquis was created Duke of Ireland in the year following his advance to the Marquisate. It appears from the circumstances attending a second experiment, that in those early times there existed a prejudice against this newly invented honour. John de Beaufort (the eldest legi- timated son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster) was created by the same King, in 1 397, Marquis of Dorset ; and that dignity being taken from him in the first year of XXX Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. Henry IV. by Act of Parliament, on accusation of having been aiding, together with some other Lords whose dignities were also reduced by the same statute, in the imprison- ment of the Duke of Gloucester, Uncle to the King, which led to the Dukes death ; the Commons, recommending his merits, petitioned the Crown for the restoration of his title of Marquis ; to which the King signified his willing- ness, but the Earl himself opposed the request, and humbly prayed the King, Que come le nom de Marquis feust etrange nom en cest royaulme (fil ne lui vorroit auscunement dormer ce nom de Marquis: car jamais par conge du Boi il ne vorroit porter ne accepter pur lui nul tiel nom en auscune maniere. From this time it was not in use till the reign of Henry VL, who again created a member of the family of Beaufort to the title of Marquis of Dorset, which was soon afterwards merged in that of Duke of Somerset, and both were forfeited in 1463. The title of Dorset was how- ever destined to be the first in which the marquisate should take root in the House of Lords ; Thomas Grey, Lord Ferrers, of Groby, step-son of Edward IV., was by that King, in 1475, created Marquis of Dorset, which con- tinued to be the distinguishing honour of his family till his grandson, father of the Lady Jane Grey, was created Duke of Suffolk, in 1551, and attainted in 1554. In the same year that the Marquis of Dorset was advanced to the dukedom, there being then one other existing Marquis in the person of William Parr, brother to King Henry VIII. ’s sixth wife, (which title having become extinct in 1571,) William Paulet, Earl of Wiltshire, was created Marquis of Winchester, and though, after one hundred and thirty-eight years, his successor was advanced to the Dukedom of Bolton, the latter title being now extinct, the Marquis of Win- chester continues at the head of the Peers of his rank to the present day, the next to him, indeed, bearing date only from 1784. Except for about twenty years in and after the reign of Charles I., when there were five Marquises, no more than three noblemen have ever borne this title cotemporaneously m England till the latter half of the reign of George III., XXXI HISTORICAL VIEW OF since which period its ranks have been filled up to an equal number with the Dukes. This degree of nobility first appeared in Scotland in 1476, when James IIL created his second son, at his baptism. Marquis of Ormond ; “ an empty title,” says Douglas, and it does not appear what precedence was allotted to it, as that of Earl of Ross, to which the young prince was created four years afterwards, entirely superseded it. The title does not appear again in Scotland till, in the year 1599, James VL advanced the Earls of Huntly and Arran to the dignity of Marquis ; since that time it has been borne suc- cessively by two or three of the first families on their passage to the superior rank of Dukes, till the Union fixed the Marquises of Tweeddale and Lothian in the second grade ; to which the titles of Huntly and Queensberry have since been added, by the extinction of their respective dukedoms. In Ireland the title was still more rare, indeed almost un- known, till near the close of last century, but there are now fourteen Marquises in the Irish Peerage. The Marquis’s style is, “ Most Honourable Marquis of • ,” and he is addressed, “ My Lord Marquis.” The coronation robe of a Marquis is a mantle of crimson velvet, lined with white taffeta, and trimmed with a cape of ermine reaching from the neck to the elbow, distinguished by four rows of black spots on the right, and three on the left shoulder. His parliamentary robe, but for a similar distinc- tion, would be the same as that of a Duke. His cap and coronet also resemble the Duke, differenced only by four of the strawberry leaves on the rim being ex- changed for as many golden balls. See the engraving above. The eldest son, though in law only an Esquire, takes by courtesy his father’s second title, and ranks next after the Earls. The Marquis's daughters and younger sons have by courtesy the titles of Ladies before their Christian and sur- .names, and all his children are styled Right Honourable. xxxii Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. EARLS. This is the most ancient order of our nobility. In the Saxon times the grandees of the kingdom, under the name of Ealdorman, (which literally has the same meaning as the Latin Senior or Senator,) had shires or other territories committed to their rule; and were sometimes from these governments denominated Shiremen, sometimes, from their military commands, described by the Saxon word Heretoga , and in Latin documents were styled Princeps , Dux, or Comes. These names seem all to be synonymous and indicative of a rank inferior to the Etheling or Princes of the blood, and superior to the Thane. With the Danes came in the title of Eorle , used in the parts subject to their power in a sense equivalent to this of Ealdorman, but admitted into the Saxon dominions with reference to the higher dignity of the King’s immediate relatives; from whom, on the sway of Canute extending all over England, it descended to the same persons who had previously borne the title of Ealdorman. This honour, with the authority and reverence attached to it, was conferred for life, or with an estate of inheritance at the King’s pleasure ; but in those unsettled times no evidence remains of any long succession in the same family. Upon the Norman conquest, the territorial possessions of the Saxon nobility were declared forfeited upon perpetually recurring pretences, and transferred to the Norman followers of the Conqueror ; to whom, also, other fiefs were dispensed under the new denomination of Count or Countee, which, however, was soon again supplanted by the ancient title of Earl ; though, singularly enough, the alien word that would not attach itself to the persons of its Norman owners, took root in their English shires, which from thence are called xxxiii d Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF counties to this day. The Norman Earl, to which rank the most illustrious names of our early history belong, was invested with the third penny out of the Sheriff’s court of the county ; and there is some trace of his Saxon pre- decessor having also enjoyed it. Upon the increase of their number in latter times, this revenue ceased ; and it was usual to assign to them, in the patent of creation, in lieu of it, for the support of their dignity, a certain sum, frequently twenty pounds, out of the profits of the county, which also is obsolete; indeed the Earls have become so numerous that they now usually derive their titles from a town or village, or even a family name, instead of a county, as formerly. The Earls and Barons, as they are the most ancient, so ilso have they always been the most numerous Orders of the Peerage ; though in England, at the present time, the number of Barons nearly doubles that of Earls. In Ireland the number is nearly equal. But in Scotland, where the title is known to have existed almost four hundred years oefore any other parliamentary honour is recognised by official documents, this Order is more numerous than all the other degrees of the Peerage collectively. The Earl’s style is “ the Right Honourable Earl of ;w he is addressed as “ My Lord.” The robes of an Earl are differenced from those of a Duke by having three instead of four rows of ermine ; in other re- spects they are precisely the same. His cap, also, is the same as a Duke’s. His Coronet is a circlet of gold enriched with jewels, from which rise eight points surmounted by as many balls of gold, and between them eight small strawberry leaves close to the upper rim of the circlet — Sec the engraving above. The eldest son, though in law only an Esquire, takes by courtesy his father’s second title, or in the unusual case of there being no second title, he is Lord with the family name. The daughters have by courtesy the title of Ladies before their Christian and surnames, and, as well as the eldest son, XXXIV THE PEERAGE. are styled Eight Honourable. The younger sons are styled Honourable ; and it is a peculiarity respecting them, that in the public schools they are distinguished in the school list as Mr. ; this is attached, however, to the title of Honour- able, not to their being the sons of an Earl, and is equally applied to any sons of the nobility who by courtesy bear the title of Honourable. VISCOUNTS. In the Saxon times, next in rank to the Ealdorman was the Highgereve , or Sfiire-reve, an officiary dignity only, de- rived immediately from the King, and having still its re- presentative in our High Sheriff ; they were not deputies to the Earl, but held for the King’s use such countries or terri- tories as had no Ealdorman; and in those that had, the Sheriff had the custody of whatever rights the King reserved to himself in them. In Latin documents those officers were styled Vice-comites, but the particle vice did not then denote subordination, other than to the King, any more than it now does in the dignity we are considering. This was introduced as a title of hereditary nobility in England, but without a shadow of official trust, by Henry VI., who found it established in his kingdom of France. In 1440, he created John, previously Baron Beaumont, Viscount Beaumont, and gave him place above the Barons ; the title became extinct by the death of the first Viscount’s son, in 1507 Meanwhile this rank had been conferred on the Lords Lovel and Welles, both extinct before 1507; and L’Isle, which failed in 1512, when the Viscount’s degree no longer existed in the Peerage, till, after an interval ot twenty -one years, this title of L’lsle was revived. It failed again in 1541, but the Earl of Hertford, afterwards Duke of wes? d 2 Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF Somerset and Protector, then held the title of Viscount Beauchamp, though merge. 1 in the superior rank of his Earldom. lie was attainted and all his honours forfeited in 1552 ; two years previous to which period, Walter Devereux, Baron Ferrars of Chartley, had been created Viscount Hereford. This dignity was merged in the Earldom of Essex in 1572, from which time, for nearly fifty years, none bore the title of Viscount as their chief honour ; and the for- feiture of Robert, the celebrated Earl of Essex, in 1600, again suspended the Order, till his son was restored to his diguities, in 1603; on his death, in 1646, the Viscounty emerged by the extinction of the Earldom of Essex, and Hereford has since, without farther interruption, been borne as the prin- cipal title of the first English Viscount. In 1620, three Viscounts were created, and the number was gradually increased till 1628, when they amounted to nine, the largest number this rank has ever counted, before the accession of George III. ; till which period they con- tinued to vary somewhat between nine and four, except during a few years of the reign of William III., when there were no more than two, and afterwards three Viscounts. They are still not numerous as compared with Earls and Barons, but about equal with the Dukes and Marquises. As Henry VI. borrowed the title of Viscount from his French dominions, so, after James VI. of Scotland had as- cended the throne of England, it makes its first appearance in the Scottish Peerage. In 1606, the Viscounts of Fentoun and Haddington were created ; of then}, the former was ad- vanced, in 1619, to the Earldom of Kellie, and the latter became extinct in 1625, but not till other creations had raised the number of Viscounts, independently of such as bore superior titles, from the one which remained, in 1619, to five ; and though occasionally fluctuating, the number of this order continued on the whole to increase, till, in the year 1700, they amounted to seventeen, besides those that were merged ; but from that period they have gradually de- clined, leaving at the present time no more than four. This class has always been comparatively large in the Irish xxxvi Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. Peerage. Early in the last century it numerically nearly doubled that of either Earls or Barons ; at present it is ex- ceeded in number by both these ranks, but is considerably more numerous than the English Viscounts. The Viscount’s style is u the Right Honourable Lord Viscount he is addressed as “ My Lord.” The robes of a Viscount are in form the same as have been described under the higher orders of the Peerage — dif- ferenced by having three rows of black spots on the right, and two on the left shoulder. His cap is the same as a Duke’s. His coronet is a circle of gold enriched with jewels, the upper rim of which is sur- mounted by fourteen balls set close together, as represented in the engraving above. His sons and daughters are all styled Honourable, there being no distinctive title for the eldest son. BARONS. An inferior order of territorial Nobility was known in the Anglo-Saxon polity, divided into the spiritual and secular classes, by the names of Messe Thegnes and World, Thegnes . The former were not Bishops who by that name ( Bisceopes ) ranked with the Earls, but subordinate Priests, ranked by the laws of King Athelstan on an equality with the secular Thanes. The latter were hereditarily endowed with fan- possessions, held of the King by tenure of Knight’s service, and called Tainland. They belonged to the great nobility, though the officiary dignity of Highgereve ranked before them. To constitute a Thane, it was necessary he should possess intii Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF a distinct office in the King’s Court ; or, being a churle or countryman, that he should have fully five hides of his own land, a church, a kitchen, a bellhousc, and a boroughgate with a seat. In these curious particulars, handed down by a Saxon writer, an interesting insight is afforded us into the manners and piety of our ancestors. A great Lord must have a church for the edification of his family and retainers ; he must also keep a court in which justice may be adminis- tered to them, the original of the Court Baron, still existing in all manors, and here described under those simple words, “ sitting in the gate,” which we so often read in the Scrip- ture ; the hospitality required of them is expressed in the kitchen and the bellhouse being the only indispensable parts of a mansion; the bellhouse denoting the hall of entertainment to which the guests, no doubt, were sum- moned, as is still practised in the country seats of our gentry, by ringing a bell ; and it is remarkable that a statute of Richard II. calls the King’s Ilall, “ Tinel-le-Roy,” from the tingling of a bell. Under the Norman monarchy, the term Baron gradually superseded that of Thane ; at first they were used indiscrimi- nately. except that Baron is never applied, as in the Saxon description of a Thane, to the servants of the King’s Court mi that capacity; a Baron must hold territorial Barony, by feudal service, immediately of the King. Selden, in his “ Titles of Honour,” describing the principles of the feudal Baronage, divides the time from the Conquest into three periods : the first comprehending from the Conquest to the latter end of the reign of King Joiin ; the second, to the eleventh year of Richard II. ; the third, from the latter period to that in which he wrote, and which may now be ex- tended to the present time. In the first period, all who held any quantity of land of the King had, without distinction, a right to be summoned to Parliament ; and this right being confined solely to the King’s tenants, of consequence all the Peers of Parliament during that period sat by virtue of tenure and a writ of xxxviii THE PEERAGE. summons. But towards its close the conflux of Peers be- came so large and troublesome, that the King was obliged to divide them, and summon only the greater Barons in per- son ; leaving the small ones to be summoned by the Sheriff, and (as it is said by Blackstone) to sit by representation in another house ; which gave rise to the separation of the two Houses of Parliament. In the beginning of the second period — that is, in the last year of the reign of King John, this distinction was con- firmed by Magna Charta, in which the King declares, facie- mus summoncri archiepisarpos, episcopos, abbates , comites , et majores barones regni sigillatim per litercis nostras , et prceterea faciemus summoneri in generali per vicecomites et ballivos nostros omnes alios , qui in capite tenent de nobis ad certum diem , Sfc. Tenure, therefore, now began to be disregarded, and persons wrho held no lands of the Crown were sum- moned to Parliament by the King’s writ ; and it has been held that right by tenure ceased under Henry IIL, and that no person was then considered to be entitled to sit in the Parliament, unless he was summoned thereto by the King’s writ; though it is contended, on the authority of a proceeding in the Parliament of 1225, that the Crown never possessed the prerogative of omitting to summon to every Parliament the Barones majores , who had for- merly been entitled to sit in right of their tenures. That the right to a seat in Parliament, as attached to the posses- sion of certain lands, is now wholly abolished, is evidenced by the proceedings in the case of Benjamin Mildmay, Esq., who, in 1668, presented a petition, claiming the Barony of Fitz- Walter, as heir-general of Robert Fitz- Walter, summoned to Parliament in the twenty-third of Edward I., a.d. 1295, and was opposed by Robert Cheeke, Esq. Whereupon, his Majesty was pleased to order in council that the cause should be heard by the Privy Council, on the 19th January, 1669, when the two Chief Justices and the Lord Chief Baron were ordered to attend. The Counsel for the said Robert Cheeke affirmed, that tne same was a Barony by tenure, and ought to go along with the land; xxxix Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF which the Counsel of the Petitioner denied, and offered to argue upon the same. Upon which, both parties being ordered to withdraw, the nature of a Barony by tenure being discoursed, it was found to have been discontinued for many ages, and not in being, and so not fit to be re- vived, or to admit any pretence of right of succession thereupon. An 1 it was ordered by his Majesty in Council, “ that the Petitioner is admitted humbly to address himself to his Majesty, for his writ to sit in the House of Peers as Baron Fitz- Walter.” And he was so summoned accordingly. In every instance since, which has had any bearing upon the question of Baronies by Tenure, the resolutions of the House of Lords have tended to confirm that of the Privy Council in 1669. The third period commences in 1387, with the first in- stance of a creation by patent, when Richard II. created John de Beauchamp, Baron Beauchamp of Kydderminster, v ith remainder to the heirs male of his body, since which period Peerages have been indifferently created by writ or patent, but in modem times by patent only, and usually with limitation to the heirs male of the body, but without prejudice to the right of the Crown to grant to any other re- mainder, or, which is less frequently (if indeed ever) exer- cised, to create a Barony by writ. With regard to the mode in which a Peerage is heredi- tary, it has been already shown, that in the first century and a half of Norman rule, a Barony appears to have apper- tained to the tenure of a certain demesne, the honour con- sequently following the land, however conveyed. Also, that the inheritance of Peerages conferred by patent is, by the instrument of creation, so defined, or rather limited from what would otherwise have been its natural course, as to be incapable of any other than the designed succession. I therefore remains to explain the effect on the inheritance, of a title derived from a writ of summons, and a sitting under it, without which consummation the writ conveys no right. And this effect is so intelligible to Englishmen, from its near xl Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. affinity to the operation of a fee simple, that a few particu- lars only require notice, in which it differs from that well- understood rule of common law. First, then, it is distinctly laid down that the writ of summons conveys no inheritance except to the descendants of the first Baron who took his seat under it. Secondly, on the failure of an equally proximate male the right of females is admitted, as in in- heritances at common law ; but with a difference growing out of the nature of the estate, which, being a Parliamentary Barony, is indivisible.* Thus, if a Baron leaves no son, the honour becomes vested in his daughters ; if he has only one daughter, she succeeds to it, but if there be more daughters than one, the title falls into Abeyance amongst them, and continues in that state either until all but one of the daughters be deceased without issue, or the sole heir of only one daughter survives ; in which case the Barony devolves on the surviving daughter, or the heir of her body. If, however, the representation of such daughter be among her co-heirs, the dignity falls into abeyance among them, but the moment the representation is vested in an individual, that individual will have an immediate right to the Barony. During the continuance of the abeyance it is the prerogative of the Crown to terminate it, by conferring the Peerage on any one of the co-heirs ; no one being injured by this operation of the royal favour, as no one could claim the title until all the other co-heirs were extinct. The person so preferred, however, must be the heir-general of one of the original co-heirs, or of some later co-heir of her moiety of the inheritance. The manner of terminating the abeyance of a dignity in favour of a male co-heir who is not a Peer, is by the issuing of a writ of summons, by the style and title of the Barony in abeyance ; out when tne person in whose favour an abeyance is to be determined is already a peer, and has a higher dignity, the Sovereign confirms the Barony to him by letters patent ; and in the case of a female, an abeyance is also terminated by patent On failure of the descendants of the body of * Fcr this account of the law of Abeyance, we are indebted to that valuable work, the Synopeis of the Peerage of England, by Sir Harris Nicolas, xli Digitized by Google HISTORICAL VIEW OF the person so summoned, or confirmed by patent, the Barony would again fall into abeyance, unless such failure involved that of all the other branches, leaving a sole repre- sentative of one of the original co-heirs, who in that case would take the title by right of inheritance from his ancestor. It must be remembered that the representation of a Barony by writ is always vested in the heirs of the body of the per- son first created ; thus, on the death of a Baron who in- herited the dignity, without issue, the title, if he has no bi other living, or there be no issue of such brother, will be- come vested in his sister or sisters, or their heirs ; in default of which it will revert to his eldest uncle of the side from whom he inherited the dignity, or his issue ; failing which, to his aunts and their issue; the females of each generation being preferred to the males of the preceding generation. On the failure of the issue of a Baron who inherited a dignity from his mother, and also the issue of his mother, the dignity of course devolves on his maternal ancestors. When the eldest sou of a Peer is summoned by Writ to the House of Lords in his father’s lifetime, and placed in a Barony vested in his father; the Writ neither takes the Barony out of the father, nor creates any new estate in it in the son, but is merely allowed to enable him to sit in Par- liament If, however, he should die before his father, leaving an heir of his body capable of inheriting the Barony, accord- ing to the original limitation of it, such heir, if a son of full age, would also be entitled to a Writ of Summons. The rank of Baron has always had the preponderance in number over the other classes of the English Peerage, but at present it is a more numerous body than all the other Peers collectively. In Scotland, the title of Baron does not appear till the year 1430, when Thomas Dominus Somerville is named as one of the conservators of the truce with England. After this time, the title became common, but the dates of the xlii Digitized by Google THE PEERAGE. earlier creations are so uncertain, that it is not easy to settle the precedence of tbe respective Barons. Where no patent appears, the descent of a Peerage is usually, as in England, to the heirs-general, but with preference of primogeniture amongst the daughters as well as amongst the sons ; and this is frequently the line of descent marked out by the patents or charters of creation. The number of Barons has never been great in the Peerage of Scotland, and is now about half that of the Earls. Kingsale, the first Irish Barony, bears date 1181; the nature of the Irish Baronies resembles those of England, being originally founded on feudal tenure, afterwards on writs of summons to Parliament, and lastly on creations by Patent. The number is about equal to that of the Earls. The style of a Baron is “ the Right Honourable Lord he is addressed as “ My Lord.” His robes are differenced from those of a Viscount by having two rows of ermine spots only ; his Coronet, by having only six balls on its upper rim. His sons and daughters are all styled Honourable THE LORDS SPIRITUAL. We have already seen that by the laws of King Athelstan the Bishops were ranked with Ealdormen or Earls, and the Messe Thanes , or Priests, with the World or Secular Thanes . HISTORICAL VIEW OF But they were exempt from the services the Crown was en- titled to claim from the secular nobility ; which, however, William the Conqueror, early in his reign, imposed on the Bishops, by converting their lands into secular Baronies; thereby requiring of them both military service and attend- ance on the King’s Courts, subsequently the High Court of Parliament ; and this attendance was especially confirmed by the Constitutions of Clarendon, in the reign of Hknry II. The Archbishop of Canterbury ranks as the first subject in the realm, next after the Blood Royal. The Lord High Chancellor is the second, and the Archbishop of York the third. Bishops, by a statute of Henry VHI., rank next after the Viscounts, taking precedence of all Barons. The Archbishop is styled “ His Grace,” and “ The Most Reverend Father in God, the Lord Archbishop of .” A Bishop is “ The Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of .” He is styled “ My Lord.” The Arch- bishop of Canterbury writes himself, “ by Divine Providence, Archbishop of Canterbury, &c.” The Archbishop of York and the other Bishops use the form, “ by Divine Permission.” The Mitre is a high cap, pointed and cleft at the top, with two pendants fringed at the ends hanging from the lower part of the cap ; the Bishop’s cap is surmounted with a fillet of gold enriched with jewels; that of the Archbishop, with a ducal coronet. THE BARONETAGE. It has been observed that in the reign of King John the Barones Minores lost the right of individual summons to Parliament; the title of Baronet was afterwards frequently applied to this class of nobility, and is so used in a statute as late as the reign of King Richard II. But it was a general term without any defined application till the reign of James I. This monarch, finding his expenses outrun his revenue, THE PEERAGE. amongst many devices to recruit his treasury, erected, in 1611, the Order of Baronets — an hereditary distinction next in rank to the Peerage — and offered it to two hundred gen- tlemen of good birth, possessing u clear estate of one thou- sand pounds a year ; on condition that each one should pay into the King’s Exchequer, in three equal instalments, a sum equivalent to three years’ pay of thirty soldiers, at eight pence a- day per man ; the first instalment to be paid on the delivery of the patent. The state of Ireland afforded an ostensible plea for this open and quite unprecedented sale of dignities ; the province of Ulster especially was in a state of almost hopeless anarchy, and the patents of the new Baronets, which were all word for word the same, the names of the parties only excepted, embodied a declaration that the money so raised should be employed in establishing an army for the reduction and good government of that Province, in witness of which design the cognizance of the Order was to be the bloody hand of Ulster, borne m a Canton on their Arms, or more heraldically, on a field Argent, a sinister hand erect gules. In 1619, the same dignity was created in Ireland, upon the same terms ; and shortly before the death of King James, the plantation of the province of Nova Scotia, in North America, was assigned as a cause for extending the same offers to the landed proprietors of Scotland. The King did not live to fulfil his intention, but Charles I., his son and suocessor, soon after his accession, created the first Baronet of Nova Scotia. The rank of Baronet is the last of the hereditary titles.
