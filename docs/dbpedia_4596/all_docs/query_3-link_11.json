        "text": "Kaya Rose Scodelario was born in Haywards Heath, Sussex, England, to Katia (Scodelario) and Roger Humphrey. Her father was English and her mother is Brazilian, of Italian and Portuguese descent. Her surname comes from her mother's Italian grandfather. Thanks to her mother, Kaya grew up fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, as well as English. At the age of fourteen, she auditioned for Skins - Hautnah (2007), the debut series for new channel E4 that would become known for casting real teenagers like her, who had no professional acting experience, rather than experienced adult actors. She won the role of \"Effy Stonem\" and joined the show in January 2007. After an challenging debut in which she never spoke, Scodelario and Effy made quite an impression on viewers. At the forefront of many disasters, including stalkers, death, and sexual pressures, Effy became a fan favorite for her ability to resolve testing life situations while keeping her head above water. As the character and the role grew, Scodelario enjoyed depicting what she described as the realistic trials and challenges Effy faced with friendships, relationships, and adolescence. After two seasons of Skins - Hautnah (2007), the series endured an overhaul at the end of 2007. Feeling that most of the characters had run their course, the writers wrote out every character except Effy. This put significantly more pressure on Scodelario because it meant that she would be the most recognizable face for season three. As she waited for the new season of Skins - Hautnah (2007) to begin, she took advantage of her recent clout to seek out additional career opportunities. She joined the elite agency Models 1 and soon was featured as the cover model for SuperSuper Magazine. She made her feature film debut with a role in Moon (2009), starring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut suffering from surreal encounters while on the moon. With a blossoming film career and her successful TV series to fall back on, Kaya Scodelario is certainly someone to watch.\n\nKatherine McNamara, named one of Vanity Fair's \"Breakout Bunch,\" is a sought after accomplished actor, dancer, singer/songwriter. She is most recently known as the titular lead role of \"Abby Walker\" in Walker: Independence (2022), the prequel to CW's Walker (2021).

As a lead role, Holland plays the role of the popular girl Lydia Martin, whom the actress says is a mix of Tracy Flick's IQ (Election (1999)) meets Violet Beauregarde's spunk (Charlie und die Schokoladenfabrik (1971)).\n\nBorn and raised in Dallas, Texas, Holland was drawn to the arts at an early age. Fascinated by the \"Queen of England\" at only six years old, Holland would put on one-woman plays for her family, emulating her favorite royal. Holland took her love of performing one step further and enrolled in theatre camps as well as acting classes to further her passion. However, it was Holland's second love, science that brought her out to Los Angeles and jump-started her career.\n\nHolland enrolled at UCLA as a molecular biology major and after one year of school, realized she wanted to return to her passion in acting. Within two months of hiring an agent, Holland got her first big break, a recurring role on HBO's 12 Miles of Bad Road (2008). Holland learned the highs and lows of this business early on, experiencing how such a promising show could be cancelled before it premiered. However, she persevered and went on to book guest starring appearances on shows such as: The Event (2010), Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003), Community (2009), and Criminal Minds (2005), as well as a lead in the cult classic franchise: Girls United - Gib alles! (2009). During her hiatus from \"Teen Wolf,\" Holland recently took time out to shoot a guest star episode on ABC's Grey's Anatomy: Die jungen Ärzte (2005), and a leading role in an independent horror flick titled House of Dust (2013) currently in post-production.\n\nEven though Holland has been fulfilling her dream as an actor, she still remained dedicated to her education as a full-time student. However, due to Holland's busy work schedule, she was forced to make the hard decision of switching majors, leaving her love for science behind and majoring in women studies; a field Holland found surprisingly fascinating and received her degree in from UCLA.\n\nIn contrast to her professional and academic life, Holland's free time consists of exploring the world of music. Whether it's coming across new indie artists or listening to her all time favorites including Ingrid Michaelson, Josh Rouse, Cat Stevens, Mumford & Sons, and Crash Kings, Holland is a music fan through and through.\n\nHannah Dakota Fanning was born on the 23rd of February 1994, in Conyers, Georgia, USA, to Heather Joy (Arrington) and Steven Fanning. Her mother played professional tennis, and her father, now an electronics salesman, played minor league baseball. She is of German, Irish, English, French, and Channel Islander descent. Before her debut into the cinematic world, Dakota did her own acting around her house. She was very active for her age, and often put a blanket under her shirt and pretended to be having a baby, using her younger sister, Elle Fanning, who is also an actress now, as the baby. Dakota went to a playhouse near her home, where the children that attended put on a play every week to show to their parents. But the people running the playhouse noticed that Dakota stood out, and advised her parents to take her to an agency. They believed that she was extremely talented.\n\nThe Fanning family were advised to spend six weeks in Los Angeles, a long way from their home in Georgia. But there Dakota managed to get her first work; to star in a national Tide commercial. She was chosen out of many, many other children.\n\nThe family then decided to move to Los Angeles permanently, for it looked like Dakota's career was looking very good. After they moved, Dakota signed with a professional agency, and soon won a role in the movie Tomcats (2001). She then went onto a small project called Father Xmas (2001) as Clairee.\n\nBut Dakota's big break-through was yet to come. She auditioned for one of the main characters in Ich bin Sam (2001), and the director and the rest of the crew were amazed by her extraordinary talent. Dakota was cast, and starred in the movie as Lucy Diamond Dawson, alongside major Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nAfter Ich bin Sam (2001) her talent was immediately recognized around the world. She went straight onto 24 Stunden Angst (2002) as Abby Jennings, alongside Charlize Theron, then played the younger version of Reese Witherspoon in 2002's Sweet Home Alabama - Liebe auf Umwegen (2002) But Dakota still had two more movies to come in 2002. Firstly she got a huge role in Steven Spielberg's Taken (2002), the mini-TV series, and narrated the ten whole episodes, as well as having a part. This was a little more challenging, as she was playing a troubled alien child, but she managed to do brilliantly. Her last movie for 2002 was the children's movie Hansel & Gretel (2002) as Katie.\n\n2003 was also a brilliant year for Dakota, as she starred in a number of exciting projects. Firstly, it was as Sally Walden in Ein Kater macht Theater (2003) with Mike Myers, then she played Lorraine \"Ray\" Schleine, a bratty little girl, in the sweet comedy Uptown Girls - Eine Zicke kommt selten allein (2003) alongside Brittany Murphy. She then voiced preschool Kim in Kim Possible: Mission zwischen den Zeiten (2003).\n\nIn 2004, Dakota appeared in the violent thriller, Mann unter Feuer (2004), alongside Denzel Washington. Her reviews were excellent.\n\nFirst in 2005 was Nine Lives (2005), as Maria, then the chilling Hide and Seek - Du kannst dich nicht verstecken (2005) alongside Robert De Niro. By now, she was the busiest child actress in Hollywood, with a resume to die for. Her younger sister, (Elle Fanning), had also been discovered a few years earlier.\n\nAfter Hide and Seek - Du kannst dich nicht verstecken (2005) came Krieg der Welten (2005), which was one of her major movies out of everything she'd worked in. Not only did it make her more popular, but she got to play the daughter of A-list Hollywood actor Tom Cruise. They had four very successful premieres; the first in Tokyo, Japan, the second in France, the third in London, England and the fourth in New York, USA. The reviews were outstanding, especially Dakota's. She then voiced Lilo in Lilo & Stitch 2 - Stitch völlig abgedreht (2005)."
