Since his screen debut in 1949 in Alf Sjoberg's Only a Mother, he has appeared in countless films, including titles as diverse as Hannah and Her Sisters and Conan the Barbarian, The Emigrants and The Exorcist, Pelle the Conqueror and Judge Dredd. The actor is easily recognized by his gaunt appearance: he is tall, with a long, lean face and sharp features. These physical characteristics have been an asset in both aspects of his screen career, comprised of the character roles he has played in English-language films and his status as a principal on-screen interpreter of Ingmar Bergman.\n\nIn the United States, von Sydow enjoys the reputation of a serious actor, due to the roles he plays—character ones, rather than leading men or traditional star parts—and his past association with Bergman. His roles have ranged from intellectuals (the painter who is Barbara Hershey's live-in lover in Hannah and Her Sisters) to ministers and priests (in Hawaii and The Exorcist) to stock heavies (a sadistic Nazi in The Quiller Memorandum, cold-blooded assassins in Three Days of the Condor and Brass Target). He was the title character in The Exorcist, and a supernatural guide in What Dreams May Come; he also has played Christ, in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and the Devil, in Needful Things. And he has appeared in as many forgettable, if not outright disastrous, American films (Dune, Judge Dredd, and Hurricane are but a few) as he has in first-rate, Oscar-caliber titles (Hannah and Her Sisters, The Exorcist, Awakenings).\n\nVon Sydow has co-starred in a number of European productions by prominent directors, including Mauro Bolognini, Bertrand Tavernier, Jan Troell, and, most recently, Bille August. But it is his work with Bergman for which he will be best-remembered. He earned his initial international acclaim in Bergman-directed films, particularly The Seventh Seal (as the tormented knight who rides through the plague-ridden countryside in search of a good deed he might perform before the figure of Death takes him away) and The Virgin Spring (as the father who avenges the rape-murder of his young daughter). Indeed, in his best roles for Bergman (in which he has, more often than not, played husbands and artists), von Sydow has embodied the anguished soul who suffers as a result of his desires, or guilt, or the guilt he feels because of his desires. Throughout his career, he has remained active on the stage, often working with Bergman on the latter's theatrical undertakings; in fact, he began his collaboration with Bergman in the 1950s when he joined the Municipal Theatre of Malmö, where Bergman was the principal director. Decades later, he capped his association with the filmmaker by taking supporting roles in two Bergman-scripted family histories. First he played Johan Akerblom, Bergman's maternal grandfather, in the Bille August-directed The Best Intentions. Then he was a character who, in an earlier day, might have been the counselor of one of his prior Bergman parts: the spiritual advisor of Anna, the filmmaker's mother, in Private Confessions, directed by Liv Ullmann. Nearing age 60, von Sydow extended the boundaries of his career by directing his first feature: Katinka, a romantic story based on a novel by Herman Bang. Yet he remains primarily an actor, with his mere presence lending his projects an aura of class. In recent years, most of his roles have been supporting ones. One notable exception is Hamsun, directed by Jan Troell, in which he stars as Knut Hamsun, the controversial Nobel laureate writer who sided with Hitler during World War II.\n\nNonetheless, von Sydow's finest late career role is the aging, illiterate old widower Lasse Karlsson in Pelle the Conqueror, directed by Bille August. Lasse and his young son Pelle are impoverished Swedish immigrants in Denmark: simple folk with modest dreams, who must valiantly struggle for survival in a world rife with everyday cruelty and injustice. Von Sydow eloquently captures his character in voice and mannerism; he plays Lasse brilliantly, with much grace, humor, and understanding, and he went on to earn his first (and, to date, only) Best Actor Academy Award nomination.\n\n—Rob Edelman"
