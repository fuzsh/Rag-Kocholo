Written and directed by Markus Imhoof, the Swiss production is a convincing, often moving depiction of its characters’ plight (A-II, PG).\n\n“Brooklyn” (2015)\n\nDignified, meticulously understated story about a young Irishwoman (gracefully portrayed by Saoirse Ronan) who immigrates to America in the early 1950s with the help of a Roman Catholic priest (Jim Broadbent) and who falls in love with a plumber of Italian descent (Emory Cohen). Director John Crowley and screenwriter Nick Hornby neatly calibrate the pathos and humor; the result is elevated entertainment A non-explicit premarital encounter, several uses of rough language, some crude and crass language (A-II, PG-13).\n\n“Dirty Pretty Things” (2003)\n\nSoulful tale set in a small London hotel where a Nigerian overnight desk clerk (Chiwetel Ejiofor) discovers the manager (Sergei Lopez) is exploiting other illegal immigrants in a passports-for-kidneys black-market operation that threatens to engulf his virginal friend, a desperate Turkish immigrant (Audrey Tautou).

Partly subtitled.

Directed by Joan Micklin Silver, it’s a film to be seen as a piece of Americana but also to be savored for the many brilliant little scenes that comprise a pulsating mosaic (A-III, PG).\n\n“I Remember Mama” (1948)\n\nEngaging, warmhearted version of the John Van Druten play in which a daughter (Barbara Bel Geddes) recalls the nurturing influence of her mother (Irene Dunne) on her Norwegian-American brood in San Francisco circa 1910. Directed by George Stevens, the interplay of family life is richly depicted through good times and bad (A-I, no rating).\n\n“In America” (2003)\n\nInspiring, largely autobiographical tale of grieving Irish parents (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton) who arrive impoverished in 1980s New York City with two little daughters (Sarah Bolger and Emma Bolger) whose friendship with a volatile African-American artist (Djimon Hounsou) helps the troubled family to survive.

Wayne Wang directs the adaptation of Amy Tang’s novel with considerable sensitivity. Brief violence including a suicide, a restrained sexual encounter, much sexual innuendo and minimal rough language (A-III, R).\n\n“The Kite Runner” (2007)\n\nSuperb adaptation of Khaled Hosseini’s best-seller about an Afghan writer (Khalid Abdalla) now living in the U.S. who recalls how as a boy (Zekiria Ebrahimi), he failed to help and subsequently betrayed his best friend (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), and now finds he has a chance to atone for that misdeed.

Brief violence and a few instances of rough language (A-II, no rating).\n\n“Lamerica” (1995)\n\nEager to make a fortune in post-communist Albania, an Italian con man (Enrico Lo Verso) sets up a phony scheme involving a confused old man (Carmelo Di Mazzarelli) who spent 50 years as a political prisoner, then becomes ashamed of exploiting his simple love and trust.

Fleeting bedroom scene and a few instances of crass language (A-II, PG).\n\n“My Family-Mi Familia” (1995)\n\nDirector Gregory Nava’s ambitious, sprawling Mexican-American family saga, set in Los Angeles from the 1920s to the 1980s, follows the parents and their six children (including Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos and Esai Morales) as they endure separations, tragic deaths and brushes with the law.

Director Mira Nair’s adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri’s acclaimed novel holds your interest right up to its two-hankie conclusion. Partially subtitled.

Director Michel Brault’s unpretentious movie is a slight but rather sweet love story that gradually brings out the best in its varied characters. Subtitles. An extramarital affair and flash of nudity (A-III, no rating).\n\n“Pelle the Conqueror” (1988)\n\nA Dickensian adaptation of a Danish novel which tracks a turn-of-the-century elderly widower (Max von Sydow) and his young son (Pelle Hvenegaard) from their arrival on Danish shores in search of a better life to their many hardships as stablehands on a farm. Directed by Bille August, this is long and grim, but imbued with a strong feel for the life-sustaining love of a father for his child. Brief, graphic images imply the results of incest, infanticide and castration, some vulgar language suggesting sexual impropriety and some violence. English subtitles (A-III, no rating).\n\n“Popi” (1969)\n\nPuerto Rican widower (Alan Arkin), struggling to give his sons something of a decent life amidst the slums of New York City, finds that he can’t make it — even with his three jobs. Director Arthur Hiller skirts sentimental melodrama and Arkin’s comic lightness keeps viewers engaged in a potentially tragic story, the point of which is that there are no fantasy solutions to the hard realities of poverty. Some brutal aspects of slum life (A-II, G).\n\n“Real Women Have Curves” (2002)\n\nCredible coming-of-age story set in East Los Angeles where a heavyset 18-year-old Latina (America Ferrera) who is constantly criticized by her mother (Lupe Ontiveros) is torn between accepting a distant university scholarship or helping her older sister (Ingrid Oliu) keep her struggling sewing factory afloat. Director Patricia Cardoso captures the hardscrabble lives of a close-knit Mexican-American family. Some subtitles. An off-screen sexual encounter and an instance of rough language (A-III, PG-13).\n\n“Sophie’s Choice” (1982)\n\nScreen version of William Styron’s novel about a Polish Auschwitz survivor (Meryl Streep) who has found refuge in a 1947 Brooklyn boarding house with her lover (Kevin Kline), a volatile American Jew. A young, inexperienced Southern writer (Peter MacNichol) gets caught up in their lives, their lies and their secrets. Director Alan J. Pakula’s harrowing film is overlong but Streep’s performance conveys the anguish of survivor guilt and the frailty of the human psyche. Suicide, some brief nudity and rough language (A-III, R).\n\n“Stand and Deliver” (1988)\n\nQuietly affecting movie about an extraordinary real-life math teacher (Edward James Olmos) in an East Los Angeles high school who transforms a rowdy class of Hispanics into calculus whiz kids. Inspiring story, fine acting by the leads and deft direction by Ramon Menendez. Some profanity in a realistic context (A-II, PG).\n\n“Tortilla Soup” (2001)\n\nPleasing comedy about a Mexican-American widower (Hector Elizondo) and his three grown daughters (Jacqueline Obradors, Elizabeth Pena, Tamara Mello) who experience unexpected romances and discover their true passions while their chef father cooks elaborate gourmet meals for them each Sunday. Director Maria Ripoll’s spicy story about family, food and romance entices the taste buds while tugging on the heartstrings. A sexual encounter and a few sexual references with brief profanity and crass language (A-III, PG-13).\n\n“Under the Same Moon” (“La Misma Luna”) (2008)\n\nTouching story of a 9-year-old Mexican boy (Adrian Alonso) who, following the death of his grandmother and temporary guardian (Angelina Pelaez), pays two American siblings (America Ferrera and Jesse Garcia) to smuggle him across the border so that he can reunite with his mother (Kate del Castillo), working in the United States illegally to improve his future. Director Patricia Riggen’s restrained feature debut movingly dramatizes a real-life plight affecting millions of children, with all three leads turning in luminous performances. In Spanish. Subtitles. Occasional crude, crass and profane language, a sexual reference (A-III, PG-13).\n\n“West Side Story” (1961)\n\nRousing Broadway musical, with choreography by Jerome Robbins and music by Leonard Bernstein, is a contemporary, inner-city adaptation of the classic Romeo and Juliet theme, with Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood playing the star-crossed lovers set apart ethnically and by their opposing street-gang backgrounds. Directed by Robert Wise, the picture captures the grit of life in the city’s lower depths, with glimmers of hope and elements of tragedy in a delicate balance (A-III, no rating)."
