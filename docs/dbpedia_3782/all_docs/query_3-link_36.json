        "text": "In an exclusive interview, Lars Blomgren, managing director of Filmlance International, one of Sweden's largest independent production companies, spoke to us about his company (now part of the UK Shine Group) and about four major projects set to start filming soon.\n\nThe first 3D live action film The Crown Jewels to be directed by Ella Lemhagen, Jan Troell's new film Truth and Consequence, the 10 x 60' TV series The Bridge co-produced with Nimbus Film, and a 10 x 90' series based on best-selling crime novels by Arne Dahl.\n\nYour mother company Metronome Film & TV was acquired a year ago by Elisabeth Murdoch's UK based Shine Group. What changes has this new set up brought to your own activities?\n\nIt's wonderful and challenging for us to be part of Shine Group. They do fantastic feature films and are a major player in the global television industry. If we want to take our projects on the international marketplace, beyond Scandinavia, they can help us because they have access to the right distribution companies and can push us into the system. They were perhaps surprised by the level of quality of our productions that have relatively low budgets compared to what they are used to. They respect and appreciate what we do and let us work independently the way we used to.\n\nYou're producing Jan Troell's new project...\n\nI met him two years ago in Toronto. We connected immediately. He's a fabulous director and I'm proud to work with him. He has co-written his new film Domen over död man (Truth and Consequence) with Danish writer Klaus Rifbjerg. It's based on the true story of Swedish journalist Torgny Segerstedt who became famous during WW2 for standing up against the Nazis. The Scandinavian cast will be announced within the next few weeks. Shooting will start the second part of this year.\n\nWhat's the budget and who's financing it with you?\n\nThe film has a SEK45m budget. Nordisk Film is co-producing with us and has Scandinavian rights. All major Swedish players are involved such as SFI, SVT and Film i Väst.\n\nIs this your biggest project for 2010?\n\nNot at all. Prior to that, Ella Lemhagen will make the first Swedish 3D live action film. It will also be made as a 3 x 60' TV series for SVT. The feature film version will be like a Tim Burton film with Ella's typical touch. It focuses on a young girl accused of being part of a murder. During the interrogation, she tells the story of her life, a fantastic and unbelievable - yet true - story. It's a contemporary story that spans over 20 years. The SEK48m film will start shooting in August.\n\nYou also produce first time directors, like Lisa Siwe (Glowing Stars). Who are your next rising stars?\n\nTV director Simon Kaijser da Silva (The Half Hidden) is currently working on his directorial debut Östra Station (supported by Nordisk Film & TV Fond) starring Mikael Persbrandt. It's a passionate love story. We still have some shooting scenes to lock up in May. Then we have an experimental film by up and coming feature filmmaker Levan Akin. It's called The Game We Play.\n\nOn the TV side, you've been highly successful with your Beck series. Do you have other crime/investigation series in production?\n\nWith Nimbus Film in Denmark, we're working on The Bridge directed by Charlotte Sieling (among others). The 10 x 60' series based on a script by Hans Rosenfeldt, Nikolaj Sherfig and Måns Mårlind is basically a crime investigation that lasts over ten hours. It's a true organic 50/50 co-production with Danish and Swedish actors. The SEK 80 million series produced for SVT, DR and NRK, with support from Nordisk Film & TV Fond, will be ready in 2011.\n\nThen we have another very exciting crime series based on Arne Dahl's ‘Intercrime' books. The 10 x 90' series for SVT and ZDF is our next step after the Beck series. It will be different in the sense that the crime investigations are led by a group of seven to nine policemen, not by one individual. Each episode will have one of them as a lead. We will have the same quality as the writers Cilla and Rolf Börjlind were also behind Beck. ZDF in Germany - involved in several of our TV series - is co-producing and handling world distribution.\n\nScandinavian crime adaptations based on novels has been very popular on international TV screens for a while, but now feature films such as the Millenium trilogy and Easy Money are also selling well. What do you make of this trend?\n\nI think the success that everyone talks about is a bit exaggerated. The first Millennium film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a fantastic success, but perhaps once in a life time that we should put aside. Crime on television is our bread and butter, and we're lucky to have a Scandinavian market and a German market - that often represents 30% of the budget for our projects. Swedish crime series travel quite well, but it's much harder for feature films in general, even in the Nordic region. We have to fight for every single seat in a cinema. It's almost impossible to do pre-sales with distributors in other Nordic countries. If a film has a good local market, then eventually it will be picked up.\n\nAre you investigating new distribution platforms and cross media?\n\nWith our animation franchise Laban the Little Ghost, we're talking about applications for I-phones. We spend time and efforts investigating new digital platforms, but it's a bit scary to make big decisions. We don't even know who the big players will be in the business in next five years. There are so many changes on the market and one has to make the right moves."
