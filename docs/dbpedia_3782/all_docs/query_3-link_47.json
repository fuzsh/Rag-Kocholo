        "text": "On Monday, July 10, 2023, the Coolidge presented legendary actor, filmmaker, and humanitarian Liv Ullmann with the Coolidge Award, recognizing her film artistry and inspiring, decades-long career.\n\n“At the Coolidge, we treasure our times with Liv and are thrilled and honored to have the opportunity to welcome her back. She is the preeminent representative of the power of film to change us as individuals and collectively, and she changes the world with her humility and kindness.” – Coolidge Corner Theatre Executive Director & CEO Katherine Tallman\n\nABOUT LIV ULLMANN\n\nLiv Ullmann’s filmography as an actor includes eleven of Ingmar Bergman’s films (including Persona, Cries and Whispers, Scenes from a Marriage, and Shame), Jan Troell’s The Emigrants, and Richard Attenborough’s A Bridge Too Far. In 2022, she was presented with an Honorary Academy Award® in recognition of her \"bravery and emotional transparency that has gifted audiences with deeply affecting screen portrayals.\" Additional international awards include four Golden Globes, three National Society of Film Critics awards, three New York Film Critics Circle awards, and two Academy Award nominations for Best Actress.\n\nIn the 1990s, Ullmann turned to directing and went on to helm the feature films Sofie (1992), Kristin Lavransdatter (1995), Private Confessions (1999), Faithless (In Competition, Cannes Film Festival 2000), and Miss Julie (2014, starring Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell). Ullmann has also directed numerous critically acclaimed stage plays all over the world, including the sell-out production of A Streetcar Named Desire (starring Cate Blanchett) in New York and Sydney, and Uncle Vanya at the National Theatre in Oslo.\n\nBeyond her film and stage work, Ullmann considers her highest priority to be her avocation for human rights and the empowerment of underprivileged people around the globe. For over 35 years, she served as Vice President International of IRC (International Rescue Committee), the largest non-governmental refugee organization in the world. She is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and has traveled widely for the organization. She is also co-founder and honorary chair of the Women's Refugee Commission.\n\nWATCH THE FULL CEREMONY"
