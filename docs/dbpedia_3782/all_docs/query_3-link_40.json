        "text": "Sweden's entry into the Academy Awards this year was a film called Everlasting Moments from filmmaker Jan Troell, a revered director who has been working in Sweden for over 40 years. IFC asked me to feature this trailer today and I watched it and thought it'd be good to share. The story is set in the early 1900s and focuses on a woman who wins a camera in a lottery and finds new found joy in life in using it. It showed at both the Toronto and Telluride Film Festivals and received rather positive reviews from Variety and LA Weekly amongst others, as you can see in the trailer. So if you're interested, check it out below.\n\nWatch the trailer for Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments:\n\n[flv:https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/everlastingmoments_trailer.flv https://media2.firstshowing.net/firstshowing/everlastingmoments_trailer.jpg 598 336]\n\nSweden, early 1900s. In a time of social change and unrest, war and poverty, a young working class woman, Maria, wins a camera in a lottery. The decision to keep it alters her whole life. The camera grants Maria new eyes with which to see the world, and brings the charming photographer \"Piff Paff Puff\" into her life. Trouble ensues when Maria's alcoholic, womanizing husband, feels threatened by the young man and his wife's newfound outlook on life.\n\nEverlasting Moments is directed by Swedish filmmaker Jan Troell, of the Oscar nominated film The Emigrants as well as Il Capitano previously. The screenplay was written by Niklas Rådström, with a story by Jan Troell and Agneta Ulfsäter-Troell. This was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Golden Globe, but didn't win. IFC is debuting Everlasting Moments in limited theaters starting on March 6th."
