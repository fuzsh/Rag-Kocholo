        "text": "In this epic sequel to the 1971 film The Emigrants, Karl-Oskar (Max von Sydow) and his wife Kristina (Liv Ullmann), having journeyed to America from Sweden, are now living in the wilderness of Minnesota. While building a farmhouse and clearing and farming their land, they must deal with the brutal realities of American frontier life, including a fierce Sioux uprising and a bloody Civil War as well as the lure of the gold fields of California, throughout family squabbles and the raising of their children across births, disease, journeys, illnesses, and deaths.\n\nNominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1973 Academy Awards and hailed as “a shattering film” (New York Times) with “poetic and human detail” (New York), this film adaptation of the final two books in Swedish novelist Vilhelm Moberg’s Upon a Good Land series captures the hardships and dreams of 19th-century Swedish immigrant households. With precise, minute detail, Troell charts a journey that was shared by countless other people who sought better lives across the Atlantic. Directed by Jan Troell (Sweden, 1972)"
