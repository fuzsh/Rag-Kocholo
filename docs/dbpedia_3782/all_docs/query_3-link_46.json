For his follow-up, Warner Bros. gave Troell studio resources to make a real American film, a tart character study of a Big Sur homesteader (Gene Hackman) who gives his mail-order wife (Liv Ulmann) a crash course in the realities of her new homeland.35mm Technicolor print courtesy of the Chicago Film Society",
