        "text": "Kristina Nilsson and her family leaves a poor Sweden in the 1840s hoping to find a better future in the wild country of America.\n\nIn the middle of the 1800s, millions of Scandinavians left their lives in hunger and despair hoping for a better life in America. This epic story follows Kristina, Karl Oskar and their young children on a dangerous journey across the Atlantic Ocean and onwards to the wild North America. Their challenges are enormous and someone has to be sacrificed so that others can survive.\n\nThe Emigrants is based on a book from Swedish literature – The Emigrant Series (1949-1959) written by Vilhelm Moberg. The first movie adaptation came out in 1971, which was directed by Jan Troell with Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow in the leading roles and was based on two parts of the Emigrant series.\n\nNow another great film was made based on the novel. The film depicts a group of emigrants from Sweden and their journey to the United States in 1840.\n\nMaka Dolidze\n\nDirector\n\nErik Poppe (b. 1960) is one of Scandinavia's most awarded film directors. He grew up in Portugal and Norway. Sharp scripts, strong acting ensembles, and impressive cinematography usually characterize his films. He has directed Troubled Water (2008), A Thousand Times Good Night (2013), The King's Choice (2016), and Utøya: July 22 (2018). The King's Choice was Norway's Oscar submission in 2017.\n\nThis film is part of\n\nOne chance!"
