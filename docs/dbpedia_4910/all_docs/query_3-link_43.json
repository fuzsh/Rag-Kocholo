        "text": "Coming Full Circle\n\nDisclaimer: despite the fact that I don’t perceive Karate to be a sport, I do understand that it is a recognised sport that is trying to achieve Olympic status. It is on this basis that I write about the art in this sphere.\n\nI’ve never been particularly an avid fan of kata, however I must admit that when performed honestly and with great skill;it’s a thing of beauty. It seems that in the modern karate landscape that in a very general sense, the motivation for perfecting technique in kata and its performance stems from competition. With all the exposure I’ve had to competitions, including WKF-style as well as the more traditional competitions, it’s no surprise that as an overzealous kyu grade that I couldn’t wait to sink my teeth into some more advanced kata. However, it is a slight irony that now that I am finally at the rank and experience to do such, I more find myself looking back in order to look forward.\n\nYears ago, I once read from Nakayama Masatoshi, former Chief Instructor of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) that both Bassai and Kanku Dai are kata representative of Shotokan Karate, and the mastering of them both is mandatory. The importance of this cannot be understated simply because it isn’t an exaggeration to say that they both form the backbone of all of the dan-grade kata. I learnt this in the final preparations for my shodan exam when countless repetitions of Bassai Dai in particular were done in order to ensure we understood the fundamentals of the kata. I’d like to add further that based on this experience, I also gained a greater appreciation for the even more basic and fundamental Heian series of kata.\n\nThe basic Heian kata are unbelievably difficult for the average kyu grade moving up the ranks. However as a full black belt I appreciate their significance because not only does Heian provide indispensable tools and transferable skill to the average karateka, they also are the basis of Bassai and Kanku. Thus Bassai and Kanku are the backbone, but Heian equates the roots of Shotokan Karate. I would like to expand on this.\n\nApart from the fact that they are easier to perform and are mercifully short, the historical significance of this series is an often overlooked but integral factor to its importance. According to Kanazawa Hirokazu Kancho, in his book “Karate the Complete Kata”, the Heian series was established in order to create an easier avenue for a student to master basic karate techniques. The antiquated Naihanchi (Tekki) series once provided these means for students in Okinawan middle schools.\n\nKanazawa Kancho also described the fact that Heian incorporated not only elements of Kanku Dai, as it greatly known, but Bassai Dai as well – therein lies the close relation between these kata. Master Itosu Yasutsune (1830-1915) created this series with the intention to create a self-defence or physical education-oriented area of study rather than a technique for killing. Which was perceived as a product of the changing times.\n\nAccording to Kancho, because of emphasis on physical education the more lethal strikes such as nukite to the eye, (Chinte) or nami gaeshi to the groin (Tekki) were deemed inappropriate from an education standpoint. Also, all Heian kata begin and end with a defensive or blocking technique, which conveys a humble attitude, and also in my opinion resonates the general concepts of the Dojo Kun.\n\nHowever, with the modernisation of Karate-do, it is unfortunate that the regular practice of some kata is being overlooked based on their unsuitability for competition. Meanwhile the time-honoured classics such as Unsu, Gankaku and perhaps the Gojushiho kata among other high-ranking kata are preferred. I think that despite the physical benefits of performing these kata on a regular basis, they should not be practised at the expense of the more fundamental patterns. Particularly important to newly-promoted Shodan grades, it is necessary to diligently continue the practice of the kata necessary to attain their rank. From Heian straight to Bassai.\n\nI think that Karate should remain in principle a budo (art of war) despite the machinations of the sport arena. The sporting aspect of the art as well as the traditional concepts should not work exclusively, but instead in tandem; therefore a karateka can further evolve into the 21st century as a balanced martial artist. As far as kata is concerned, I’ve finally had the revelation of how important that mundane, but inextricable series of five kata are to my development. I hope to learn a lot more about the art through its continued repetitions.\n\nSean Taylor, 1st dan\n\nThe advent of Tournament Karate and Overseas Instructors\n\nAfter Funakoshi’s death there came the first All Japan Championships. Here we saw emerging the most gifted exponent of Shotokan since maybe Gigo Sensei. At least this was the opinion of the entire JKA. Kanazawa Hirokazu Sensei won the kumite division, with a broken wrist; a story which has become a part of Shotokan history. The same year, he with Mikami Takayuki and Takahura Eiji,were the first three graduates of the first JKA instructor’s programme which was overseen by Nakayama and Okazaki Sensei. Okazaki was never allowed to compete because the JKA wanted him to play a pivotal role in being a referee as well as the trainer for the instructor program.\n\nThe following year in 1958, Kanazawa was again in the kumite final this time against his good friend and roommate Mikami. Kanazawa had already won the kata division but fought Mikami to a literal stale-mate in the final. They circled each other for minutes without landing a technique in what became more of a psychological battle instead of a physical one. Eventually they were heralded as joint champions with many witnesses claiming it was the best fight they ever saw. In 1959 however Mikami got the better of him and defeated him in both the kata and kumite divisions becoming the first outright grand champion (Kanazawa was heralded Grand Champ in 1958 despite the draw).\n\nKanazawa Sensei’s time was short lived on the tournament circuit, as he became the literal prototype for Shotokan and was the first instructor sent overseas to Hawaii in 1961. He was replaced by Asai Tetsuhiko a few years later and returned to Japan. On the point of his return there were several more instructors who emerged from the kenshui programme which was nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest” by Stan Schmidt a South African kenshui graduate. Chief of these were Shirai Hiroshi, Enoeda Keinosuke, Ueki Masaaki, Ochi Hideo, Oishi Takeshi, Abe Keigo, Yaguchi Yutaka and Asai Tetsuhiko.\n\nIn 1965 Kanazawa, Enoeda, Shirai and their senior Kase Teiji were sent to Europe to establish Shotokan in Britain. There apparently was Shotokan there before but the level was very poor technically. Together with Kanazawa, Enoeda made massive improvements to the standard of Karate in England, Shirai and Kase went to France and Italy. When Kanazawa left Europe, Enoeda remained where the KUGB: Karate Union of Great Britain was established.\n\nCue the 1970s and the zenith of the JKA. This decade alone saw some of their most amazing competitors. With Kanazawa, Enoeda, Asai, Ueki and co. already retired from competition and teaching abroad, the time came for a new crop of talent to emerge. And emerge they did!\n\nInstructor Program Graduate List\n\nName Year Rank Position Mikami Takayuki 1957 8th dan USA JKA/AF Southern Takaura Eiji 1957 Kanazawa Hirokazu 1957 10th dan Founder SKIF Tsushima Toshio 1958 Yaguchi Yutaka 1958 9th dan USA ISKF Mountain States Ouchi Kyo 1959 Sato Masaki 1959 *Saito Shigeru 1959 Inaba Mitsue 1960 Kano Masahiko 1960 Watanabe Gunji 1960 *Ogata Kyoji 1960 Kisaka Katsuharu 1961 USA Nakaya Ken 1961 Ogawa Eiko 1961 Ueki Masaaki 1961 8th dan HQ Full-Time Instructor Keinosuke Enoeda 1961 9th dan Deceased 29th March 2003. *Miyazaki Satoshi 1961 8th dan Deceased 31st May 1993. *Mori Osamu 1961 *Takahashi Yoshimasa 1961 *Majima Kenshiro 1962 Sakai Ryusuke 1962 7th dan Jitsuhara Shoji 1963 Ochi Hideo 1963 8th dan JKA Germany.

However the kumite was quite literally a two horse race between Oishi Takeshi and Tanaka Masahiko. Other top competitors included Iida Norihiko and Yahara Mikio. With an overseas collaboration with Nishiyama and Okazaki Sensei who both were in the United States at the time, the JKA established the IAKF: International Amateur Karate Federation. Which was more or less held the first world championships for Shotokan.\n\nWinds of Change: Kanazawa’s Expulsion and Nakayama’s death\n\nDue to apparent irreconcilable differences Nakayama Sensei had Kanazawa expelled from the JKA in 1977. It was the first crack that emerged in the JKA massif. To this day, no one knows for sure what occurred, but what was obvious was that JKA parted ways with their golden boy. Kanazawa went on to start his own organisation called SKIF: Shotokan Karate-do International Federation. Thus the JKA lost a lot of affiliate organisations in the process.\n\nThe JKA continued to thrive in spite of this, but then came the death of Nakayama in 1987. After which, Asai sensei was installed as the chief instructor temporarily. There however emerged a heated legal battle that created a distinctive rift in the organisation. This led to the split between the current Chairman Nakahara and the Matsuno section. Under the Nakahara section which eventually won the legal rights to the JKA was Tanaka, Osaka, Kawawada, Imamura, Izumiya, Naka, Ueki, Oishi, Iida and Taniyama. The Matsuno section consisted of instructors who ultimately left when in the late 90s the courts ruled for the rights to be given to Nakahara Nobuyuki. These instructors were Asai, Abe, Yahara, Isaka and Kagawa among others. The largest JKA exodus occurred in 2000 when Abe, Asai and Yahara left and opened their own organisations. That was the same year that Kanazawa Sensei was awarded his 10th dan (not by the JKA who don’t recognise this rank) and he was the first instructor to be awarded this rank while still alive. Okazaki Sensei although senior to Kanzawa, was awarded his 10th dan grade after him. Even the overseas affiliates such as KUGB and ISKF (Okazaki) became independent ultimately from the JKA.\n\nFor instance when Enoeda died in 2003 the JKA appointed Ohta Sensei who was Enoeda’s assistant since 1982 as the chief instructor, although he was junior to many of Enoeda’s British based students like Andy Sherry and Robert Poynton. This led Sherry and co. to split from the JKA and form their own organisation keeping the KUGB name. Today, there are several different Shotokan organisations with worldwide recognition, and this is because they are led by former JKA stalwarts.\n\nI personally believe that this rift would have been inevitable regardless of if Kanazawa was not expelled or if Nakayama was still alive. The reason is that one organisation could never have enough room for so many juggernauts. It is said that the Shotokan curriculum must be strictly adhered to until one attains 3rd or 4th dan. After which, the practitioner is seen as being comfortable with his techniques, and is able to evolve it to fit is personal interpretation of Karate. Which are what technicians such as Kanazawa, Asai and Yahara did. Therefore it is inconceivable that these masters would stay under the same umbrella till today.\n\nHowever, the JKA still remains as one of the largest and most significant martial arts organisations today, helping spread the knowledge of Karate across the globe thus making it a household name.\n\nKarate in the modern scope\n\nToday Shotokan is still the most well known martial art. Many traditional ultras criticise Shotokan for the way it changed Karate. For instance, the advent of tournament Karate paved the way for many other styles whether traditional or eclectic to do so as well. In all fairness however, Judo long before had competitions and was still revered as an effective martial art.\n\nRegardless Shotokan has its many critics because of its constant evolution which has popularised the martial art in the process. In the sport karate arena the general image has changed with new organisations such as the WKF: World Karate Federationbeing formed. The addition of the red/blue colouration, similar to Taekwondo has helped market the tournament circuit much to the disapproval of traditional circles. Shotokan, along with Wado-Ryu, Goju-Ryu and Shito-Ryu are the recognised styles within the WKF. I think that these developments were inevitable because ultimately the powers that be, want to see Karate become an Olympic event at long last. Whether or not that would be a benefit, remains to be seen.\n\nIn conclusion, no one can deny the influence Shotokan has had on global martial arts as Funakoshi taught several students who in turn founded their own systems. Such as Choi Yong-Eui (Oyama Masutatsu), Choi Hong Hi and Otsuka Hirnori founded Kyokushin, modern Taewondo and Wado-Ryu Karate respectively. Nevertheless despite the evidence apparent throughout history, topics such as this will always, most definitely be debatable.\n\nEnd.\n\nHirano 平野\n\nThe Shotokan Timeline\n\nby Sean Taylor\n\n. An unofficial documentary of Shotokan Karate\n\nIntro:\n\nKarate by far is the most popular known martial art in the world today. Many people attribute this popularity to the Hollywood industry and the martial arts film boom of the 1970s. Often, the late actor Bruce Lee has been credited with introducing Karate to western civilisation. While it is true that his movies have inspired several thousands of people at the time to start some form of self defence, he did not introduce “Karate” to the western world. Nevertheless, the term Karate has become so common that almost all martial arts are generically referred to as a form of Karate, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to unofficially document the brief but eventful history of Shotokan Karate. I stress that this document is not official and some of the events described may be erroneous. However in any case, most Shotokan historical references differ from each other due to political motivations amongst several other factors. I assure readers that this rendition is in no way motivated by anything else than to inform active practitioners as well as anyone else that reads this.\n\nLastly I must indicate that the names of instructors from the orient were displayed in the traditional fashion of the surname being written first. Thus, Gichin Funakoshi becomes Funakoshi Gichin and Masatoshi Nakayama becomes Nakayama Masatoshi and so on.\n\nI hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed researching and writing it…OSU!!\n\nSean Taylor 2011-02-20\n\nWhat is Karate?\n\nWithout going into too many technicalities, Karate is Japanese martial art, with implicated origins from Okinawa as well as China. It utilises the body as a weapon by implementing percussive and concussive blows to the vulnerable areas of the human body. Thus, an opponent can be efficiently incapacitated and neutralised.\n\nStyles/Systems\n\nDue to different interpretations by different masters, towns, and cultures there are several Karate styles. However the one documented here is the one that I practise: Shotokan. It is a style that is very unique and iconic amongst Karate styles because of its sole use of low strong stances, and dynamic kata. These are not the only factors that make it a unique style but, as I go on you will discover this.\n\nShotokan is a modern martial art with its roots embedded in the past. Centuries ago, martial arts were widely believed to have been created by an Indian monk called Bodhidharma. He was known as the founder of Zen Buddhism and eventually took his teachings to China. He travelled to the Shaolin Temple where he began teaching the monks that resided there. At first they were physically unable to keep up with his teachings, and so Bodhidharma devised a training system to supplement their spiritual discipline. The Shaolin Monks became known as the best fighters in China and the system by which they were taught became known as Shaolin Boxing (Kung-Fu). The Shaolin Monks travelled from China to spread the word of Bodhidharma and his fighting system. Zen was readily accepted in Japan.\n\nOne of the most devout followers of the Buddhist religion was Sho Shin. His father was King Sho En, ruler of Ryukyu Kingdom (Okinawa), and Sho Shin became King at the age of just 13 in 1477. Due to his devout religious beliefs, one of the first things he did during his reign was to ban all weapons. This ban was continued by the Satsuma clan. Those who studied martial arts now had to do so without any form of weaponry.\n\nIn 1609 Japan invaded Okinawa, and further to the ban on weaponry, placed a ban upon anyone doing martial arts, and so martial arts training became shrouded in secrecy. Okinawans, who were mainly peasants and farmers, were constantly in mortal danger as they had several confrontations with the heavily armed and trained Samurai. The Samurai were a clan as well as a sort of “feudal police” for the Japanese government at the time. They trained in Ju-Jitsu, several types of weaponry which included swordsmanship and had a moral code of ethics which made them formidable soldiers.\n\nOkinawans in prospect of the inevitable conflict developed their own martial art. Over the next 300 years in Okinawa – during the long reigning ban on martial arts – three main branches of self defence became evident. These were Shuri-Te, Naha-Te and Tomari-Te named after the Okinawan towns within which they developed. They were known collectively as Okinawa-Te or Tode.\n\nEventually these developed into two mains styles, Shorin-Ryu which developed from Shuri and Tomari and Shorei-ryu which came from Naha. It is believed that Shorin-ryu was best for smaller men, with a light and fast style. Shorei-ryu was suited to the bigger, more powerful man. Apart from this unarmed combat Okinawans were still severely handicapped because the Samurai not only donned their razor sharp swords but also wore protective armour as well. Therefore Okinawans created new weapons from everyday farming tools because the conventional weapons were previously banned.\n\nNow at this time of constant war and conflict, the Ryukyu Kingdom being a chain of hundreds of islands, was a well known port of trade and commerce between Okinawa and China. It is widely believed that one of the Chinese merchants; a master in Shaolin Boxing showed locals some techniques during one of the many “cultural exchanges” that took place on the ports. This was a significant integration as it supplemented and modified the resident arts on Okinawa added supposedly more fluid movements among other innovations.\n\nFunakoshi Gichin was born in 1868 and began studying martial arts at a very young age, under Itosu Anko and Azato Yasutsune. The ban on martial arts still stood, and so Funakoshi would often have lessons with his instructors at night time, so not to be discovered. As the years elapsed, Funakoshi became more and more proficient, and he ultimately combined Shorin-Ryu and Shorei-Ryu which were the arts he studied. Also the arts which were known as Karate which Kanji characters were 中国 手, were interpreted as “China Hand.” Funakoshi changed the meaning of “Kara” which also meant empty, so that China Hand became “Empty Hand” 空 手.\n\nThe ban on martial arts was finally lifted in 1902 when Ogawa Shintaro, the Commissioner of Education recommended that martial arts should be included in physical education in the first middle school of Okinawa. This meant that Funakoshi could continue his training in without fear of discovery, and he could now spread the word of his karate. Funakoshi was invited to Japan in 1922 to give a demonstration of Karate at the First National Athletic Exhibition in Tokyo, which was organised by the Ministry of Education. After this demonstration he decided to remain in Japan to spread the word. It is thanks to his efforts that Karate became part of the school curriculum in Japan.\n\nFunakoshi is widely known as the first Okinawan to introduce Karate to the Japanese public. Although some sources claim that Mabuni Kenwa (Shito-Ryu) and Choku Motobu (Goju-Ryu) were in Japan prior. Contrary to today, and unknown to most people, at that time Judo was the most popular martial art in Japan and little or nothing was known of Karate, which was seen as foreign and Okinawan. Funakoshi sensei who was a school teacher did not have much financial backing and initially struggled until he demonstrated for the Emperor. Kano Jigoro, the founder of Judo in 1882, befriended Funakoshi and invited him to teach classes at the Kodokan which was the headquarters for Judo.\n\nFunakoshi sensei innovated his art even further and borrowed the keiko-gi or white pyjama like uniform from Judo as well as their kyu-dan ranking system. It has also been reported that he taught atemi-waza (striking techniques) to Kano’s students. After his stint at the Kodokan, he and Kano remained friends till Kano’s death in 1938. Funakoshi began going from University to University teaching his art which he simply referred to as “Karate-do.” He added the “do” suffix when he arrived at Japan to differentiate it from “Karate-jutsu.” Thus\n\nchanging the style from a killing art to a way of life. In a corollary to this change, he created the Dojo Kun and Niju Kun, as guideline principles for general etiquette.\n\nFunakoshi travelled throughout Japan, taught at many well known universities such as; Keio, Waseda, Hitostsubashi, Gakushuin, Hosei and most famously Takushoku. It is alleged that he have the first shodan grade to seven students on April 10th 1924. These students were Tokuda, Otsuka Hironori (founder of Wado-Ryu), Akiba, Shimizu, Hirose, Gima and Kasuya Shinyō. Otsuka was possibly his greatest exponent and became his disciple in the following years. Otsuka began training under Funakoshi Sensei at age 30 and was already a master in Ju-Jitsu, however they parted ways as Otsuka founded his own Karate style which became known as Wado-Ryu and was an eclectic blend of Shotokan and Ju-Jitsu.\n\nFunakoshi changed the Karate-do terminology to more Japanese terms as he sought to easier integrate his style to suit the palate of the nationalistic Japanese. Therefore kata names changed for example; Pinan became Heian and Passai became Bassai, Kushanku to Kanku, Wanshu to Enpi/Empi, Rohai to Meikyo, Chinto to Gankaku, Naihanchi to Tekki and so on. As mentioned prior Takushoku University became the main hub for Karate-do. Students that studied there actively were involved in Karate-do. At this time Funakoshi’s son, Funakoshi Yoshitaka also known by his nickname “Gigo” along with prominent Takushoku club members began revolutionising further, the already successful art.\n\nGigo Sensei alone introduced the low stances for the first time, which became characteristic of the art. He also added the mawashi geri (roundhouse kick) and ushiro-geri (back kick) to the curriculum. Also it is written, that in a friendly challenge to his father, he rebranded the style Shoto-Kan as opposed to Karate-do. This became the name of the first dojo as Shoto was Funakoshi Gichin’s pen name (he wrote literature, and did Kanji Calligraphy) and Kan being hall. This first official dojo was built in 1936 (1939 in other sources). It was bombed during World War II. It was around this time that Gigo sensei sadly passed away after being ill for a long time thus, Shotokan again lost another great exponent.\n\nHowever Takushoku University became a literal breeding ground for excellent Karateka, and chief among these at that time was Nakayama Masatoshi, Nishiyama Hidetaka and Okazaki Teruyuki who all trained under Funakoshi. In 1949 the Japan Karate Association was founded by Funakoshi, Nakayama Sensei as well Nishiyama Sensei. Their first honbu dojo was built in 1955. Nakayama sensei was a pioneer in the art, and had the most extensive contribution with help from his juniors Nishiyama and Okazaki. Together they sought to spread the art to all of Japan and ultimately to the entire world.\n\nNow it is my opinion that this zeal to spread the art was a culmination of US G.I.s being stationed in Okinawa and Japan during and after the war and discovering the art.\n\nRegardless of the true objective, it was clear that the shores of Japan would no longer be able to hold the secret and Nakayama desired to elevate the level of Shotokan. He was the first instructor to scientifically research Karate and how its techniques were effective in tandem with the body. Therefore this scientific approach gave training methods more clarity and increased the technical ability of students exponentially.\n\nFunakoshi Sensei’s principles for Shotokan were very strict as observed in his motto: “Karate ni sente nashi.” Which means there is no first attack in Karate. Practice was mainly basics and kata and kumite was strictly pre-arranged because of the concepts of ikken hisatsu. Therefore Funakoshi thought it too dangerous for jiyu kumite (free sparring). However, the students loved it, and also Okazaki Sensei among other seniors wanted to create tournament Karate. However, they were aware of Funakoshi’s feelings towards this but were able to convince him when they pointed out that it would have been an excellent way to advertise and spread the art.\n\nTherefore Okazaki, Nakayama and others spent years trying to develop sporting rules that enabled the competitors to maintain their safety without compromising the core philosophy of Shotokan. In an interview Okazaki stated that at first they used a sumo style ring, which was essentially a circle. They soon realised that it wasn’t practical and didn’t meet the needs of Karate. Eventually they agreed on a boxing style square ring and also developed the shobu-ippon point system. When they were finished, Funakoshi Sensei was pleased with what he saw and gave the go ahead for the first All Japan Karate Championships. It is also noted that Okazaki with the help of Nakayama with propagation of Karate in mind, developed the JKA instructors programme; the first of its kind in any martial art.\n\nFunakoshi was unable however to witness the first All Japan Championships as he passed away in 1957 just before it was held. Funakoshi’s funeral culminated in the first sign of in-fighting within the Shotokan fraternity. Now many historical references praise the JKA and its contributions to globalising karate. However, there was a faction that although closely affiliated with Funakoshi, had no connection to the JKA. This faction was led by Egami Shigeru who also trained under Funakoshi and surmised that his Karate in its original format should be preserved.\n\nThis group came to call themselves the “Shotokai” and isn’t as widely known today as Shotokan is. One of Egami’s exponents Harada Mitsusuke, made statements in an interview, that gave the impression that he did not share the reverence that the rest of the world had for the JKA. He said: “There was a time it is true, when I was close to him. It was the time when we taught the American Air force groups after the war. My impression then was that he was not particularly special, just a karateka with some experience. So I do not really understand why the JKA later chose to turn him into some kind of demi-god.” That was a statement of course he made about Nakayama sensei. The animosity came to its peak seemingly when there was a dispute over Funakoshi’s funeral arrangements.\n\nEnd of Part One.\n\nHirano 平野\n\nIn October 1957, the inaugural All Japan Karate championships were held in Tokyo. Kanazawa Hirokazu was the kumite champion that day and it was reported that he achieved that feat with a broken wrist. In order to conceal his handicap and protect himself, Kanazawa used only keri waza (kicking techniques). His intention was just to win one fight, but he kept on winning and winning until he made it to the final. That single tournament launched him into legendary status, as well as putting karate-do on the launch pad from a sporting perspective. Such feats are unheard of today in contemporary sports karate.\n\nAs most people know, the World Karate Federation which is the most widely known karate organisation (sanctioned by the IOC) has been trying to get karate into the Olympics for decades. Where Judo (since 1964) and Taekwondo (since 2000*) have succeeded their karate peers have had to enviously look on from a detached view. The IOC needs to have a guarantee that the inclusion of any one sport into the Olympics can make money for the organisation. Therefore over the past couple decades, sponsorships from sports equipment manufacturers mainly Adidas, have reared its ugly head in tournament karate. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nSeveral wholesale changes have been made to traditional karate tournaments to make them more “entertaining” to onlookers. Now this isn’t to say the older tournaments which utilised the shobu-ippon rule system were not entertaining. It is just that they mostly had fans from budo (martial arts) circles enthused. Thus came rise to the WKF point-sparring system; where 3 points (sanbon) are allotted for kicks to the head and takedowns with a finish in tandem, nihon (2 points) for a kick to the mid section and ippon (one point) for a punch to any part of the body above the belt. The old tournament system only awarded an ippon (full point) for a decisive technique with proper intent. In other words, if the technique was executed in a real-life situation the opponent would be incapacitated. Notice a striking difference?\n\nThe changes also altered the way kata were performed for competition, where techniques were either diluted, or even dramatised in order to add a garnishment to the performance. The WKF seemingly adopted the dual red/blue colour representations from Taekwondo. Therefore one opponent would wear a red belt, while the other a blue. If this wasn’t enough, matching gloves, shin pads and even foot protectors were included. So unless you were lucky to compete in one colour throughout a tournament, chances are you’d have to have all the gears in both colours thus doubling the profit suppliers make. The head gear and face masks have already found their way into traditional karate tournaments as children are mandated to wear them for their protection. Soon adults will have to add this to their armour as they go into “battle.” When I was convinced that it couldn’t get any worse it did. Elite karate athletes, including males now wear chest protectors to compete.\n\nThis brings me back to my analogy at the start. How did karate evolve (regress?) from competitors being allowed to fight with broken limbs to having to wear a chest shield to thwart already padded fists? The WKF ultimately has good intentions I suppose, as millions of karateka are motivated by competition and have the opportunity to compete on an international level. However wearing protection of any kind does defeat the purpose of budo training, because there are no gloves in the streets. But with legal stipulations taken into consideration, mouth guards and gloves are understood as mandatory. But there’s a thin line between protecting one from plausible physical injury and just being plain ridiculous. The JKA boys of 1960s fame knew nothing of groin cups and fore-arm guards. They conditioned their bodies, and practised their craft to the point that most injuries would be avoided.\n\nThe WKF are attempting to meet the IOC’s whims I suppose. It is sad to say that there will be no karate in London this summer or in Rio in 2016. Or is it? In hindsight Funakoshi Gichin, the father of modern karate, knew the dangers of tournament kumite; which is why he prohibited it. What he did not know was that when he finally sanctioned it, that it would be repackaged into this diluted version of the martial art. He is probably rolling in his grave right now.\n\n*Taekwondo was an event used only for demonstration purposes at Seoul ’88 and Barcelona ’92.\n\nTaylor 1st kyu\n\n“What’s the use of practising Karate? That stuff can’t stop bullets!” That’s the common dictum among on-lookers and detractors alike in contemporary society. Our world has become increasingly violent since this ancient art made it across the Pacific to the western world in the early 20th century. In Trinidad and Tobago, violent crimes have been on the rise; including armed robbery, rape, homicide and drug-related shootouts. The general consensus about an increase in gun play in our country is justified. Because we all know the good-old crime of unarmed assault is a thing of the past. Or is it?\n\nIn the past 18 months I’ve noticed a lot of anti-bullying campaigns on the major social networks I frequent. As a matter of fact, there are many physical altercations that get swept under the carpet because the average person wouldn’t dare report them to the authorities. Bullying has been on the rise in secondary schools across the nation for some time now. The pack mentality of the strong taking advantage of the weak is a known affliction among teenagers. When these individuals get older this escalates into violent crimes and aspirations of wanton gun-weilding destruction. Well, at least that is the obscure impression a karateka would get if they actually took the time to listen to their more “practical” critics. “You should join the gym instead, lift weights and buy a gun…” was a retort I remembered receiving when I was an enthusiastic 10th kyu (white belt).\n\nIn the realm of adults however, these unarmed assaults are more common than most people realise. People with sinister ulterior motives are always sizing up their victims, competition or whatever you want to call the recipients of their intentions. It’s always a case of surivival of the fittest wherever you go; a case made by Funakoshi Gichin the father of modern-day karate almost a century ago. He was famous for saying when you leave your home you face a million enemies. And as much as that may sound like a kung-fu movie archetype, it is very relevant even today. Every carnival you hear a lot of stories about fights started in crowds – and they usually only make the news when someone is injured or killed.\n\nThe most galling truth is that more often than not, it’s someone in authority guilty of these afflictions usually associated with our unsavoury criminal elements. Last night one of my friends on Facebook posted this video. Apart from the obvious the most disturbing thing about it was that the two assailants were security guards. They even had an accomplice outside who came to help the onslaught on the defenseless man. For those of you reading this post that are not from Trinidad and Tobago, the diminutive man using the ATM machine allegedly stole the card. The guard (against common ATM protocol) came to help him and upon the assumption the card wasn’t his, began his physical tirade.\n\nAnyone can see that the victim was unarmed and harmless, and the lethality in their methods was not necessary. But they did it regardless because they could.\n\nThis article is a message, both to the karateka as well as people who don’t see the use in physical training. The physical and philosophical aspects of karate and other traditional arts transcend most other physically regimental systems. Not only are you gaining the tools to defend yourself, but also moral and ethical values that would generally benefit society. If the untrained bullies in that video had an iota of these ethics, then they would have handled the “issue” with the dignified conduct that should come with the job. Karateka of all levels particularly mudansha (under black belt ranks) should be mindful that every time they train is a priceless opportunity to improve, protect themselves and others from these characters. Because it’s clear that even in the 21st century all criminals don’t weild guns. Train sensibly my friends. OSU!\n\nSean Taylor 1st kyu SKIF"
