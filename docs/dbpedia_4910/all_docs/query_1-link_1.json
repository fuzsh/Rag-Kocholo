        "text": "I'm continuing to study kanji in the morning as part of my day-bookending (building an ideal day). Kanshudo is a powerful AI-driven tool to help me master Japanese. It's almost too much, to be honest. The dashboard is a bit overwhelming for someone who wants about 20 min per day of practice, but I'm going to persist and see how it goes. The reason I like it is the components of the kanji are interesting to me. I love seeing how the various parts form the whole, and imagine the story behind how the kanji developed centuries ago. For instance, the kanji for spirit (ki) involves a man, a second, and two crossed swords. I know from practicing kendo that the kiai is extremely important - the very presence of your body and your bearing, and how you approach your opponent with a very wide field of view and an overwhelming spirit - can make or break your exchange with that opponent. My first strike in competition was the best I will probably ever have, and I will never forget it. It was so impressive that the referees came over and complimented me. I was the only foreigner in the entire gymnasium filled with hundreds (it felt like thousands) of people. Perhaps I was fortunate to fill my spirit with all of theirs for just a moment and soared through the air, filling it with my voice. (You have to yell loudly as you strike, naming the specific strike you are doing at the same time and execute it perfectly in order to earn a point). What is your ki (spirit) today? How are you showing it to the world? What are you exuding such that it is palpable without words?"
