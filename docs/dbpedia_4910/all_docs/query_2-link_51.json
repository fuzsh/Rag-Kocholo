        "text": "Name: Kimura Ryohei (木村 良平)\n\nDate of Birth: 30th July 1984\n\nHometown: Tokyo\n\nAgency: Gekidan Himawari\n\nRepresentative Roles: Takizawa Akira in Higashi no Eden, Takakura Shoma in Mawaru Penguindrum, Hasegawa Kodaka in Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, Hachiken Yugo in Silver Spoon series, Nishimi Kaoru in Sakamichi no Apollon\n\nKimura’s had a bit of a roundabout career – he is attached to Gekidan Himawari, the same theatre troupe as Miyano Mamoru, and did not actively get involved in anime work until the end of the ‘00s. Instead, he started out as a child actor and for the early part of his adult career, was focused on dubbing for films and Western cartoons. Kimura’s first anime lead role was in 2009 in Higashi no Eden, and he won a Seiyuu Award for Best Supporting Actor in 2012.\n\nI first heard of Kimura in 2002’s Full Moon o Sagashite (he was the voice of the dead childhood friend Sakurai Eichi) but he disappeared off the radar after that and I was quite surprised when he did resurface with bit-parts in Oofuri and Natsume Yujincho. Since then he’s gone from strength to strength and is a regular fixture in many an anime and otome game.\n\nSource of translation here.\n\n1. Please tell us how you became a seiyuu.\n\nI have been doing dubbing work from before I can remember.\n\n2. What was your debut anime role?\n\nIf we’re talking about Japanese animation, then it’s probably Taiho Shichauzo (You’re Under Arrest).\n\n3. Of all the shows you have acted in thus far, is there any character that has left a particularly strong impression?\n\nYes there are. A lot of them, really.\n\n4. Please tell us if any of the characters you are voicing now share any similarities to yourself.\n\nHmm, I’ve never sucked anyone’s blood before.\n\n5. From all the shows you’ve been in, please tell us about any one scene that left a particularly strong impression.\n\nThe other day, I was completely destroyed by an arrow that had been fired by Ishikawa Kaito.\n\n*This would be referring to Zion, his character in Madan no Ou to Vanadis being killed by Ishikawa’s Tigre.\n\n6. Please tell us any horror stories or memorable tales from the recording studio.\n\nIt was during a quiet, graceful scene. I was supposed to gently whisper the heroine’s name but…I said my own character’s name instead.\n\n7. Are there any seiyuu you see as rivals or as someone to aim for?\n\nI love Yamaji Kazuhiro’s acting.\n\n8. If you weren’t a seiyuu, what do you think you would be doing now?\n\nI haven’t a clue.\n\n9. What’s the hardest thing you’ve experienced as a seiyuu?\n\nI don’t have a hard time. I just have fun.\n\n10. On the flipside, what’s the happiest thing(s) that has happened to you as a seiyuu?\n\nThe fact that so many people cheer me on in a job I’m actually working at because I love to. It’s an amazing thing.\n\n11. Do you like singing? What has left the biggest impression when it comes to singing thus far?\n\nI do like it, but I’m horrible. Neo Romance was my first stage performance.\n\n12. From all the radio shows you have hosted, were there any mails that left an impression on you?\n\nOn Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai radio when many listeners wrote in reporting on how they gathered up the courage to confess to the person they liked.\n\n13. Is there anything you take particular care about when you’re acting?\n\nTo breathe life into the show and the characters.\n\n14. What kind of roles would you consider your specialty?\n\nThere aren’t any.\n\n15. Tell us what goals and dreams you have as a seiyuu?\n\nTo enjoy, to delight, and to continue eating.\n\n16. To the people who are aiming to become seiyuu, please give them a word of advice.\n\nJust take in lots and lots of things.\n\n17. Apart from the shows that you’ve been in, are there anime that you like to watch?\n\nThe shows I’ve watched to completion are Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell STAND ALONE COMPLEX and Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wa Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.\n\n18. In relation to the above, are there any types of roles you’d like to voice or perhaps, characters that you admire?\n\nNope.\n\n19. As a viewer, what kind of anime do you like?\n\nGhibli productions.\n\n20. What kind of child were you?\n\nA cheeky kid.\n\n21.

Tell us about your favourite musician(s).\n\nI can’t choose.\n\n26.

Tell us about any of your experiences with sports.\n\nI was in the “Go-Home Club” in both junior and high school, but I did have a passion for soccer.\n\n28. Tell us what songs you often sing when you go to the karaoke.\n\nI like to get the people I go with to sing their own songs, so I’ll reply in kind.\n\n29. Tell us what your favourite foods are.\n\nI like all delicious foods. And sake.\n\n30. Tell us what foods you hate.\n\nI’m training myself to eat coriander.\n\n31.

Do you have any favourite snacks?\n\nI kinda have a soft spot for things with fresh cream.\n\n33. Do you drink? If you do, what sort of drinks do you like?\n\nI’ll drink anything, but my favourite is whisky.\n\n34. What did you do on your last day off?\n\nI don’t remember. On my next day off, I plan to watch films to my heart’s content in the daytime, and in the evening I’ll go out and have fun with friends.\n\n35. If you had a whole week off, what would you do?\n\nTravel abroad.\n\n36.

What is the one thing you most desire now?\n\nA driving license.\n\n43. If you could bring only one item to a deserted island, what would it be?\n\nA satellite phone that actually connects.
