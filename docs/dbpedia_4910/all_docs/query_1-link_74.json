        "text": "Hello & Welcome!\n\nWow apologies for disappearing for like two months. Who knows what I’ve been doing because it certainly wasn’t playing games, oops~\n\nThat being said, I did play a few so let’s go through them:\n\nI firstly finished the Doukyuusei 2 remake – the latter routes were pretty underwhelming so, despite some improvements, I preferred the first game overall. Probably because the protagonist had more flair.\n\nNext up was something short and overwhelmingly sweet – Boku to Kanojo no Kojin Lesson 2. It’s a very solid pure-love moege with a likable heroine and I couldn’t really ask for much more from this.\n\nI finally then got around to playing Kiniro Loveriche, a Saga Planet game that has been on my backlog for a WHILE. While not my absolute favourite game from them, I did enjoy it a lot (especially Ria’s route). Sylvie is too cute~ Similarly to Anmitsu the 3P scenes were pretty out of place though.\n\nDespite being SUPER hyped for Hooksoft’s newest game Secret Love (Kari) I ended up dropping it after 2 routes. It’s just bad and utterly lacking any vibrancy or soul. All I can say is the art was nice?\n\nTo cheer me up I played Nanaka Mai’s doujin title Nagaruboshi. For a super cheap game it was pretty decent. The story was simple but the artwork was great and heroine Mikoto was ADORABLE. A must play for Ogura Yui fans.\n\nI’m currently playing Select Obliege – it’s my first MadoSoft title and it is okay so far. I’ve only put like 5 hours into it though so I don’t have strong opinions yet. The heroine designs and artwork are delightful though!\n\nAugust’s games have been ordered already – it’s a double Azarashi Soft month so I’ll get my fix (and more points for my nexton account lmao). Kira Kano being a collaboration with Lump of Sugar is pretty much my dream game so I hope it delivers.\n\nDespite trying to resist, I did end up buying just a “few” games from the various Fanza sales. The Nitroplus one in particular was pretty nice.\n\nI’ll have a short blog anniversary post up this weekend & a review of Lovepical Poppy up next week. After that maybe another mini-review collection, who knows?"
