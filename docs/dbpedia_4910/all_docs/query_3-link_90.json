        "text": "Chapter One:\n\nThe Tale of Genji: Women’s Romance, Men’s ClassicPage 17 →\n\n春曙抄に伊勢をかさねてかさ足らぬ枕はやがてくづれけるかな\n\nShunjoshō ni lse o kasanete kasataranu\n\nmakura wa yagate kuzurekeru kana. (1: 127)1\n\nPiled the Ise on The Pillow Book but it wasn’t pile enough;\n\nno sooner I lay down than my pillow collapsed!\n\n美を愛ずる女にしかず源氏をば男作らず法師の書かず\n\nBi o mezuru onna ni shikazu Genji oba\n\notoko tsukurazu hōshi no kakazu. (5:562)\n\nGenji: made not by man; written not by monk;\n\nneither can equal a woman enamored of beauty.\n\nThe first of the two poems above evokes a woman’s world of monogatari reading reminiscent of that described centuries earlier by Murasaki Shikibu in the ‘Hotaru’ (Fireflies) chapter of Genji: a young woman spends the day alternately reading and dozing, her books spread about the room, some of them piled up as a makeshift pillow (3:202; S 436–37). It is a world in which The Tale of Genji might be said to exist, as it had for nearly a millennium, as a “romance.”\n\nIn the second poem-in words and inflections that almost caricature the heavily sinified style of monks and men—Akiko is concerned to defend Genji from men who would claim it as their own work.2 Page 18 →In so doing, she limns a realm in which Genji is something other than a “romance” for women, the realm of Genji as a “classic,” or, as it would come to be seen in her day, Genji as koten.3\n\nAn awareness of the history and vicissitudes of these two worlds that Akiko briefly illuminates, the worlds of Genji as women’s romance and men’s classic, is crucial to an understanding of the nature of the role played by Genji in Akiko’s own life and work. In order to grasp the significance that Genji had for Akiko throughout her career, it is important to note that the “Genji-world” that she inhabited in her youth was by no means the same as that of her old age. The changes this conceptual world underwent in her lifetime can be seen clearly only against a background of earlier Genji-worlds, and the upheavals of the Meiji era that made possible many of the changes in Akiko’s own Genji-world. These latter changes will be discussed in chapter three. In this chapter I will attempt a brief sketch of earlier Genji worlds with the principal aim of suggesting something of the variety of readers’ interactions with Genji.\n\nMonogatari seem always to have been regarded as reading for women that was dangerous for women. In the preface to the Sanbōe (984), a collection of Buddhist tales compiled as a spiritual guide for an imperial princess in her new life as a nun, Minamoto Tamenori (941?–1011) describes monogatari reading as a dangerous distraction from the imperative task of attaining the tranquillity of mind that leads to enlightenment:\n\nTo pass the time of day at a game of go may be diverting, but how fruitless to waste one’s thoughts in striving and contention. The koto, too, can be a pleasant companion of an evening; but one is Page 19 →apt to grow over-fond of its music. And monogatari—these are but for the amusement of women. They flourish in greater profusion than the weeds upon the wooded graves of old, they are as numerous as the grains of sand upon the rocky strand. To creatures that lack the gift of speech they give words; to insentient objects they impart feelings—even to the trees and grasses, mountains and rivers, birds and beasts, fishes and insects. Their words flow forth unchecked, as flotsam upon the sea; unlike reeds at the river’s edge, they have no root in truth. The Old Trickster (Iga no taome), The Tosa Minister (Tosa no otodo), The Fashionable Captain (Imameki no chūjō), The Lady of the Inner Chamber (Nakai no jijū)—these and all of their ilk describe the affairs of men and women as if they were possessed of all the beauty of flowers and butterflies. They are the very root of sin. They amount to not so much as a drop of dew in the Grove of Letters.4\n\nBy the latter half of the tenth century, the monogatari was clearly identified as a women’s plaything. Murasaki Shikibu seems not to have taken issue with the designation of the genre as reading matter for women, but only with its evaluation. When Genji says that monogatari “have set down and preserved happenings from the age of the gods to our own” (Seidensticker’s translation, 3:204; S 437),]; his comparison is with historical writing. But monogatari are much more than mere historical record. Genji continues:\n\n“The Chronicles of Japan are really very one-sided. But these must give you all the choice little details,” he said with a smile. “At any rate, they do not simply relate the events of some person’s life exactly as they happened. Rather I think that some things seen and heard of people’s lives, be they good or evil, so intrigue one that they Page 20 →cannot be shut away in the heart but make one wish to pass them on to generations to come—and so one sets out to tell the story.”5\n\nAnd, as if in answer to Tamenori:\n\n“Even in the Holy Law which the Buddha in his righteousness has expounded to us, there are what we call the Partial Truths (hōben) which, owing to the occasional contradictions they contain, the unenlightened doubtless view with suspicion. In the Vaipulya sutras these are numerous, but in the final analysis, they all share a single aim. And this disparity between enlightenment and delusion, you see, is of the same order as that between the good and evil in these characters. Given their fair due, then, none of them are utterly bereft of benefit.” So saying, he deftly described monogatari as indispensable. (3:205; S 438)6\n\nAlthough Fujiwara no Kintō (966–1041) revealed a certain familiarity with Genji when he asked the author whether “little Murasaki” was in attendance,7and although we also know that Michinaga made off with sections of Genji from Murasaki’s room while she was serving his daughter, Empress Shōshi (988–1074),8 the only explicit contemporary response to Genji that we have came from the Ichijō emperor (r. 986–1011):\n\nHis Majesty was listening to someone reading the Tale of Genji aloud. “She must have read the Chronicles of Japan!” he said. “She seems very learned.”9\n\nMurasaki’s account of Ichijō’s exclamation serves subtly to underscore the claims she has made for the monogatari genre in the ‘Hotaru’ chapter: this monogatari, my Genji, justifies them.Page 21 →\n\nDespite Ichijō’s amazed—or perhaps merely amused—recognition of the author’s learning, there remains something cautious about the attitude to monogatari of both Genji and Michinaga as they are depicted by Murasaki Shikibu. Genji admits only to standing by and listening as tales are read to his daughter (3:203; S 437). Later he will “spend a great deal of time selecting romances he thought suitable, and order[ing] them copied and illustrated” (Seidensticker’s translation, 3:208; S 439). He does not admit to reading them himself. As for Michinaga, he must slip into the author’s unguarded room and make off with her chapter drafts if he is to read the whole of the Genji. In any case, Murasaki’s own interpretation of the theft is that it was for the benefit of Michinaga’s second daughter Kenshi (994–1027).\n\nIn one sense this male/female division was a total fiction. It is clear even from the meager evidence just examined that men did read monogatari. Yet tradition may as readily take root in fantasy as in fact. Whatever the facts of the matter, the fiction that monogatari were only for women proved a hardy notion. In Murasaki’s day, defend the worth of the genre though she may, refer obliquely to her own erudition as well, The Tale of Genji was decidedly a women’s book—in Tamagami Takuya’s pithy formulation, Genji was “a story by a woman, for women, of a woman’s world.”10 For a man to be able to admit to more than standing by and listening as his womenfolk read aloud; for a man to ask unabashed about the possibility of obtaining a complete manuscript to read and have copied, as Fujiwara Teika (1162–1241)records doing in his diary entry for the sixteenth day of the second month of Gennin 2 (1225)11—the first mention of any monogatari in a man’s diary12—Genji had to become something other than a “story for Page 22 →women.” The Ichijō emperor’s wonder at the author’s learning showed the way. If the Genji were to become an object of study—a classic—as works in Chinese had long been, then it might become openly the province of male as well as female readers.\n\nBy the late twelfth century, the first known commentary on Genji had been compiled.13 Genji had become the object of scholarly enquiry by men and therefore might be said to have entered the realm of the classic. It is not that Genji ceased to be read as a romance; but that by and large, men’s concern with Genji has necessarily been of a different order from the ecstatic reading described by Sugawara no Takasue no Musume (1008–?) in her Sarashina nikki.14\n\nThe study of Genji the classic took many different forms. As political power shifted from the court aristocracy to a succession of military clans, Genji became a vital source of information about the correct conduct of court ceremony.15 Genji was mined by those who believed that such fiction was sinful, salacious, or simply frivolous, and, for different reasons, by those who did not.16 An ability to understand and make allusions to Genji became de rigueur for poets after Page 23 →Fujiwara Shunzei’s (1114–1204) famous declaration, at a poetry contest held in 1193, that “to compose poetry without having read Genji is deplorable (Genji mizaru utayomi wa ikon no koto nari).”17\n\nBy the time we reach the end of the Muromachi period, this accumulation of scholarship, lore, and the products of its application had grown so vast that it could only be mastered by those willing and able to devote their lives to the study of Genji. For the poet and would be classicist with somewhat less than a lifetime to devote to the pursuit, Kitamura Kigin compiled a selection from the best of the multivolume commentaries, which he published in combination with a complete text of Genji. This work, the Kogetsushō (The Moonlit Lake Commentary, completed 1673), was to become the most widely circulated edition of The Tale of Genji throughout the Edo period and well into the present century.\n\nWith the development of a commercial publishing industry in the early years of the Pax Tokugawa, together with the new market for books that it built and the new literacy that it fed, there came greater changes in the readership of Genji than at any time during the previous six centuries.18 What then became of the traditional male/female division within this vastly larger and more varied readership? We must recall first of all the shift in the custodianship of the classics in which the study of Genji passed from the hands of the court nobility to a line of nonaristocratic scholars who practiced what Hagiwara Hiromichi (1815–63) termed the “New Criticism” (shinchū)—Keichū. (1640–1701), Kamo no Mabuchi (1697–1769), Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801), and of course Hiromichi himself.19 Revolutionary though the Page 24 →interpretations of these scholars were, however, we must also note that the nature of their activities remained commentarial and the practitioners exclusively male. There was to be no crossing the male/female divide in the world of the classics.\n\nMore surprisingly, in the larger world of book publishing, we find that according to the most comprehensive modern catalogues, not a single new edition of a complete text of The Tale of Genji appeared between 1706 and 1890, a period of almost two centuries.20 This is not to say that the text was unobtainable during these years. Andrew Markus suggests that the numerous extant copies of the 1675 printing of the Kogetsushō indicate a large initial issue, many of which would have remained in circulation.21 It is also likely that reprints were made Page 25 →from old blocks without altering the colophons, even though evidence of such printings cannot be gleaned from catalogues. Be that as it may, demand for printed editions of other works in the classical canon, particularly Kokinshū, Ise monogatari, and Tsurezuregusa, seems to have been far greater than demand for Genji.\n\nThe immense cost of a complete text of Genji is surely one reason for the apparent lack of demand for the work. As Richard Bowring points out, “[I]‌n 1696 a copy [of the Kogetsushō] was selling for well over twenty times what it cost to buy a work of contemporary fiction, well beyond the reach of the average reading public.”22 Indeed, the long hiatus in the publication of new editions of Genji lends further support to Bowring’s assertion that “[t]he work was so long and so difficult, the language now so remote, that it remained one of the great ‘unreads.’”23\n\nThis does not mean, however, that Genji passed out of the consciousness of generations of readers. For those without the money to buy or borrow a copy, or for those who lacked the time, the desire, or simply the linguistic ability to read the complete text, there were digests that could be used to acquire a passing acquaintance with the work. Originally compiled for use by poets as a “shortcut” to Genji, several had been in circulation since the first half of the fifteenth century. As the renga master Sōchō (1448–1532) said when asked, “People nowadays say that if you do not know Genji thoroughly you should not use it when the preceding link happens to allude to something from the past. Is this indeed so?”\n\nOf course it is best to have been through the entire work and know it well, but it would be hard to find one person in a thousand who has. A scrap of brocade, small though it be, can still make a talisman or an ornament. And likewise with The Tale of Genji. Even if you know only one passage, why shouldn’t you make a link of it if an appropriate occasion arises?24\n\nPage 26 →\n\nThe longevity of Sōchō’s attitude is attested in the variety of digest versions of Genji, and their rapid proliferation during the Edo period.25 The titles of these works are revealing. The most popular, for example, was Genji kokagami, “A Little Genji Mirror.”26 In 1661, the haikai poet Nonoguchi Ryūho (1595–1669) published an illustrated digest called Fūjō Genji, “A Genji in Ten Chapters;” and in 1665 he brought out a simplified version of the same work to which he gave the title Osana Genji, “A Young Person’s Genji.”27 Of course such titles need not be taken entirely at face value, for they are likely to have been read by anyone, male or female, who was content to have their dose of the classic in popular, abbreviated, or simplified form.\n\nAnother “shortcut” to Genji open to both sexes was vernacular translation (zokugoyaku). These were part of a growing interest in and demand for translations of the classics, apparently among those who read for pleasure as well as for academic or artistic ends.28 The most complete list of Edo period vernacular versions of Genji was compiled Page 27 →by Fujita Tokutarō (1901–45) in 1932.29 His chapter of “translations and versions” (yakubun hon’an) lists more than a dozen attempts to render Genji in the contemporary language. Given that these items in Fujita’s bibliography constitute but a small subgenre of a large branch of the publishing industry devoted to the translation of all manner of works originally written in classical Japanese (not to mention Chinese), it seems no exaggeration to say that vernacular translation was to become almost as important in the Edo period as it is today.30\n\nNot only were there what might be called “pure” translations; the translation of classical Japanese into the vernacular might at times verge upon parody31 and even pornography. Fūryū Genji monogatari (A Fashionable Tale of Genji, 1703), for example, is described by Noguchi Takehiko as a “decidedly pornographic, in reality parodic” version of Genji.32 One might also mention Kōshoku ichidai otoko (The Life of an Amorous Man, 1682) by Ihara Saikaku (1642–93) and Nise murasaki inaka Genji (An Imposter Murasaki and a Rustic Genji, 1829–42) by Ryūtei Tanehiko (1783–1842) as works which, while principally parody, also contain elements of translation.33Page 28 →\n\nThe popularity of these new “shortcuts” to Genji—digests, vernacular translations, and parodies-signals not the disappearance of the old polarity of men’s classic/women’s romance but rather the development of a multitude of hybrid responses that lay somewhere between the two extremes. Near one end of the continuum, a digest, originally written for renga/haikai poets in a hurry, might just as well serve the needs of a woman wishing to acquire a quick veneer of courtly refinement: hence the woodblock print showing a prostitute writing a letter to one of her clients with a Genji digest on her desk at the ready.34 Near the opposite end is a work such as the Amayo monogatari damikotoba (The Rainy Night Tale in Eastern Dialect). Completed in 1769 and first published c. 1777, it is a commentary on the famous “Rainy Night Ranking” of women section of the ‘Hahakigi’ (The Broom Tree) chapter. Although prepared by the bakufu official and scholar of National Learning (kokugakusha) Katō Umaki (1721–77), Amayo monogatari damikotoba was ostensibly not intended for use by (male) classicists, but was commissioned by “a person who had many daughters” as a version of Genji suitable for them to read.35\n\nEvidence of specifically female readership of The Tale of Genji is unfortunately scanty: we know of only one or two women who were reading Genji, and not because they have left accounts of their reading, but because that reading left its traces in their writing. Ōgimachi Machiko (1679?–1724), a consort of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu (1658–1714), Chief Adjutant to the fifth shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi Page 29 →(1646–1709; r. 1680–1709), was one such reader. Her Matsukage nikki (In the Shelter of the Pine, 1710–12) is resonant with echoes of The Tale of Genji. For example, an account of a visit by Tsunayoshi to Yanagisawa’s residence recalls the ‘Otome’ chapter, and a description of Yanagisawa’s villa on the then outskirts of Edo at Komagome calls to mind Genji’s Rokujō-in.36 The Matsukage nikki provides clear evidence that Machiko had access to a copy of Genji and was intimately familiar with the work.\n\nMarkus maintains that “it is a certainty that [Genji] was read and did retain a devoted female following in the latter Edo period.”37 He cites several senryū about women who read Genji; and a satirical passage from Ukiyoburo (1809–13) by Shikitei Sanba (1776–1822) in which two women (named after two species of duck whose names happen to coincide with two verb endings commonly found in classical poetry: one is “Kamoko,” the other “Keriko”) encounter each other at a bathhouse and chat about their recent reading: one has begun to reread Utsuho monogatari; the other is “annotating” her copy of Genji with the help of Mabuchi’s Shinshaku and Norinaga’s Tama no ogushi. Markus’s translation of the scene, unfortunately only available in typescript, is given here in full:\n\nKeriko:“Kamoko-san. What are you perusing these days?” Kamoko: “Well now, just as I was thinking that I might reread Utsuho, I was lucky enough to find an edition in movable type and so I am collating the texts. But I have been interrupted by this and that since last year and so I put it aside having got as far as the latter half of the ‘Toshikage’ chapter [the first chapter of Utsuho].”\n\nKeriko:“You have got your hands on something nice.”\n\nKamoko:“Keriko-san. I expect you’re still with Genji?”\n\nKeriko:“Yes indeed. With the Venerable Kamo’s Shinshaku and the Great Motoori’s Tama no ogushi as my guides, I had just begun Page 30 →annotating it, but what with all the distractions of the mundane world, I have hardly had time to pick up my brush.”38\n\nAlthough “Kamoko” and “Keriko” could be “figments of Sanba’s fantasy” as much as “the exaggeration of observable stereotypes,” Markus concludes that “there were women of leisure and education who at least attempted the study of classics on their own, and made use of major commentaries in their pursuit of a cultivated understanding of the texts.”39\n\nOne such woman was Kanzawa Tami, the daughter of Kanzawa Tokō (1710–95), a deputy (yoriki) in the office of the Kyoto City Magistrate (Kyōto machi bugyō). Tokō also wrote haikai and was a prolific essayist. Tami was the youngest of his five children, and, as she was the only one to survive childhood, he made her his heir. In his 200–volume miscellany Okinagusa (published in part 1784), Tokō describes how he copied the entire Mingō nisso40—a total of 3,333 pages—by getting up early in the morning and working by lamplight in the evening. He then explains his decision to pass the finished work on to his daughter:\n\nMy heir Tamiko has from childhood adored [Genji] and always had it by her side. Often Tamiko would enlighten me about things which I was unclear about, or could not remember at all. Therefore, rather than keep [the copy of the Mingō nisso] for myself, though not without some reluctance, I decided to pass it on to Tamiko as something to remember me by. When I gave it to her, box and all, she was as delighted as ever I could have hoped. Moreover, taking the poetry index, she wrote in it a preface of her own.41\n\nPage 31 →\n\nTami’s preface, in which the imagery of conventional Buddhist sentiment acts as a veil of modesty for her passion for Genji, reads as follows:\n\nSurely this has been said any number of times by poets from ages past: when one does not comprehend the nuances of a text, to what can one turn for help? But the moon shines with equal brilliance upon the eaves of the poor; how then can it pass by unheeding the humble hut of the saltmaker? I have for many years steeped myself deeply in this monogatari. Brushing away the mists of dawn, dampened by the dews of evening, I have pored over these fiftyfour chapters, time and again, scroll after scroll, a thousand upon thousands of times; all the while persisting in my delusion in this ephemeral mundane world where one knows not which will be the first to fall, the dewdrop upon the tip of the branch or the droplet upon the stem, where just as the hailstone upon the leaf of the scrub bamboo (tamasasa) vanishes no sooner than it is taken up, time passes not as one would wish; and so it is with those unfathomable thousand-league depths [of Genji] that I failed to understand no matter how often I read. Shallow as I am, how am I to abandon these ties of fondness and affection [for Genji], to cross the floating bridge of dreams from this life to a world of words free of frivolity? Such is the excess of my pride.\n\nことの葉をかきあつめたるもしほ草よむともつきじみるにまさりて\n\nKoto no ha o kakiatsumetaru moshiogusa\n\nyomu tomo tsukiji miru ni masarite.\n\nWords raked together as seaweed: however much read, inexhaustible;\n\nbetter than actual experience.42\n\nAnother woman who made use of a major commentary to deepen her understanding of Genji was Matsuo Taseko (1811–94), a peasant from the Ina Valley of Shinano Province in central Japan. Aged about 40, she invested in a copy of Kigin’s Kogetsushō so that she could better incorporate allusions to the tale in her poetry.43Page 32 →\n\nFurther evidence, though less direct, of female readership is to be found in the ongoing debate over the moral advisability of women reading The Tale of Genji—and even in the demimonde.44 The Confucian scholars Kumazawa Banzan (1619–91) and Andō Tameakira (1659–1716) maintained that the female characters in Genji were exemplars of the various virtues women ought to cultivate.45 Such a view explains, perhaps, Genji’s suitability as yome-iri dōgu, an item in a bride’s trousseau, exquisitely bound and arranged (in more expensive versions) in a set of black and gold lacquered drawers.46 Kanzawa Tami’s father certainly approved of his daughter’s knowledge of Genji and the same may well have been true for Ōgimachi Machiko, since in her Matsukage nikki she recalls receiving her education at her father’s side.\n\nOthers, however, seem to have felt that reading Genji was not merely a threat to morality but positively unhealthy. In his advice to pregnant women, the Confucian doctor Inō Kōken (1610–80) wrote:\n\nWhen reading books, choose those of which neither the words nor pictures will cause agitation; books such as Yamato shōgaku or Kagamigusa are permissible but on no account should works such as The Tale of Genji be read.47\n\nPage 33 →\n\nThe Confucian scholar Kaibara Ekiken (1630–1714) was of a similar opinion:\n\nOne must be selective in what one allows young women to read. There is no harm in those books depicting the events of the past. Do not allow them to read kouta and jōruri books: they do not teach the true way of the sages and are tinged with frivolity. Moreover, one should not readily allow them to read such books as Ise monogatari, Genji monogatari and their ilk, which, although possessed of a literary elegance, depict licentious behavior.48\n\nWhile Confucian scholars might debate the advisability of women of leisure reading monogatari, for the professional woman of higher rank, familiarity with Genji was an essential accomplishment. Though digests must often have sufficed for this purpose, there are also accounts of such women sending for impoverished court nobles to read Genji and other classical texts to them.49 Perhaps some even managed to read Genji by themselves: a scene from “Mina no kawa” (Men and Women Getting Together), a series of woodblock prints by Numata Gabimaru (1787–1864), shows a prostitute at her work; on the other side of a pile of rumpled bedding can be seen a large box, labeled somewhat emphatically “Kogetsushō zen,” that is, “The Kogetsushō Complete.” A volume lies open on her desk, and beside it a writing brush and inkstone, as if to suggest that the arrival of a customer has momentarily called her away from her study of Genji.50\n\nKigin’s Kogetsushō makes another appearance in Seirō hiru no sekai: Nishiki no ura (A Brothel in the Light of Day: The Other Side of the Brocade, 1791), asharebon by Santō Kyōden (1761–1816) which is set in a brothel:\n\nPage 34 →Meanwhile, in Yūgiri’s room the juniors have been getting out the chopstick boxes and gold-lacquered trays, and setting out tea bowls. Steam is whistling from a kettle hanging over a brazier. They put some tea on top of a copy of Kogetsushū [an alternative title for Kogetsushō] nearby, pull out the drawers of the smoking set, and fill the tobacco pouches.51\n\nNo further mention of the commentary is made. Unopened and serving as a cupstand, the Kogetsushō appears along with poem-cards and tortoise-shell hairpins, essential to the decor of a well-furnished boudoir.\n\nFor the female reader of the Edo period, then, familiarity with The Tale of Genji might improve her behavior as daughter, wife, and mother; might “endanger” her physical and moral well-being; might enhance her reputation as cultivated prostitute. Whatever the results, however, Genji remained for them what it had been for all women since the time of its creation. For Ōgimachi Machiko as much as for Kanzawa Tami, it remained an avocation, an adjunct of their recreational reading. The great scholars of the work, their male contemporaries of the Edo period, came from the world of Genji as a classic. Any woman who might presume to join their number—as did “Kamoko” and “Keriko”—is a figure of fun.\n\nAkiko’s childhood reading too has much in common with what we can glean of earlier female readers of Genji. Indeed Akiko herself suggests a parallel with Takasue no Musume, the Sarashina diarist. For both young women, The Tale of Genji was everything that monogatari had always been: absorbing, transporting, ultimately escapist. And yet, for both of them, it was this childhood reading that nurtured abilities that later led to greater accomplishments—as a “novelist” for the Sarashina diarist; and as a scholar for Akiko:\n\nFrom the time that she was a young woman living in the countryside in an eastern province, the author of The Sarashina diary read works of literature and, in as much as she had been born a Page 35 →woman, she wanted somehow or other to grow up to be a beautiful woman, like Yūgao or Ukifune in The Tale of Genji, and be loved, even if only briefly, by a sensitive man like the Shining Genji, and with that in mind she cultivated herself accordingly. Ultimately she achieved her aim of going up to the capital, where she wrote The Tale of Sagoromo and other such novels. It is unfortunate that young women these days do not have such self-confidence.
