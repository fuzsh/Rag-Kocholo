At S-LLP, physicists gather to share the latest results, plans and ideas for future searches. The topic of the 1st seminar is dark photon. Dr. Graham White (IPMU) will tell us theory on LLP dark photons, and Dr. Simone Pagan Griso (LBNL, co-chair of EF09-BSM Generic) will talk about the experimental side including the topics being studied in the...",
