        "text": "「黒子のバスケ」キャラクターソング Duet Series Vol. 10: ミニドラマ\n\nKuroko no Basuke Character Song Duet Series Vol. 10: Mini Drama\n\n火神大我 (小野友樹) & 氷室辰也 (谷山紀章)\n\nKagami Taiga (Ono Yuuki) &\n\nHimuro Tatsuya (Taniyama Kishou)\n\nKagami: “No, I thought you might want my pickles.”\n\nTranslation:\n\n[Kagami is practicing on an outdoor court]\n\nKagami: [drives to the basket] Wooooh—! [dunks the ball] Alright! I think I’ve got the hang of it.\n\nHimuro: [picks up the basketball] Nice shot, Taiga.\n\nKagami: Tatsuya! When did you get here?\n\nHimuro: Just today, actually. I wanted to stretch my legs after being on the train for so long, so I was taking a walk, but…I didn’t expect to run into you, Taiga.\n\nKagami: Yeah, I didn’t expect to see you here. Is he with you?\n\nHimuro: You mean Atsushi? He came home with me, of course, but he’s not here right now. When I asked him if he wanted to go for a walk, he turned me down and said he didn’t feel like moving anymore today.\n\nKagami: So he’s like that off the court, too?\n\nHimuro: Well…he said he didn’t want to come because even if I invited him on a walk, we’d end up playing streetball anyway.\n\nKagami: He’s got a point, though. That always happens with you.\n\nHimuro: And on that note…Taiga, would you be my opponent instead?\n\nKagami: Yeah. Do you even have to ask?\n\nHimuro: Heh. Alright, get ready!\n\nKagami: Bring it on, Tatsuya!\n\n[Himuro starts on offense]\n\nKagami: —damn, you’re fast! That’s the Tatsuya I know!\n\nHimuro: You’re good, Taiga. But—\n\nKagami: What? A fake?! [jumps for the block] I’ve gotta make it—!\n\nHimuro: [takes a shot]\n\nKagami: Huh?!\n\nHimuro: [makes the basket] Yes!\n\nKagami: Dammit! You got me good. That fake threw me completely off balance!\n\nHimuro: I can’t keep losing to you, after all. But, Taiga…you didn’t put all your strength into that jump, did you?\n\nKagami: Huh?\n\nHimuro: Knowing you, you should’ve been able to block that shot, even if you were off balance.\n\nKagami: T-that’s not true! I put everything I had into that jump!\n\nHimuro: [sighs]\n\nKagami: Tatsuya! You have to believe me!\n\nHimuro: [laughing]\n\nKagami: H-hey, Tatsuya…?\n\nHimuro: Don’t worry. I believe you. You were practicing by yourself before I got here, right? Your movements were a little sluggish, so I’m actually impressed you were able to keep up with me.\n\nKagami: Whew… I was afraid you thought I was holding back again or something.\n\nHimuro: [laughing] Sorry about that.\n\n[Kagami’s stomach growls]\n\nKagami: Uh…\n\nHimuro: That was another impressive feat.\n\nKagami: It’s just…I was so relieved to hear that, it made me work up an appetite.\n\nHimuro: If you’re worn out and hungry, then it’s no wonder you’re not playing at full strength. Oh, I know. Why don’t we go grab something to eat at Maji Burger?\n\nKagami: Yeah, that sounds great!\n\n– –\n\n[at Maji Burger]\n\nKagami: Time to dig in!\n\nHimuro: I see your appetite is as huge as ever.\n\nKagami: Here. [holds out one of the burgers]\n\nHimuro: What is it? I already have plenty.\n\nKagami: No, I thought you might want my pickles.\n\nHimuro: Huh?\n\nKagami: You can have all of them, if you want.\n\nHimuro: Taiga, you remembered?\n\nKagami: Well, we used to do this all the time.\n\nHimuro: That’s true. [laughs] Then I don’t mind if I do.\n\nKagami: Feels like it’s been forever since the last time you and I had burgers together.\n\nHimuro: It really does.\n\nKagami: We’d always go for burgers after playing basketball.\n\nHimuro: Since you could order a ton of them without breaking the bank. Oh, that reminds me—\n\nKagami: Hm?\n\nHimuro: Remember that one time Alex offered to treat us, and you were so excited that you ordered twice as many burgers as usual? She got mad at you and said, “There’s no way a kid can eat that much!” And you took that as a challenge!\n\nKagami: Ugh, I remember that…\n\nHimuro: I was amazed you managed to eat them all, but then we had our hands full trying to get you home when you couldn’t even move.\n\nKagami: Now I could eat that much and have room for seconds!\n\nHimuro: [laughs] I’ll have to make sure to warn Alex not to offer to treat you on a whim.\n\nKagami: C’mon, that’s enough about that—let’s eat!\n\nHimuro: That’s right. Let’s eat.\n\nKagami: [talking with his mouth full]\n\nHimuro: Come again?\n\nKagami: [swallows] Tatsuya, you’ve still got some time after this, right?\n\nHimuro: As long as I don’t stay out too late.\n\nKagami: Then…when we’re done eating, let’s pick up where we left off! I’ll put everything I’ve got into my jumps and show you I can block every shot you take!\n\nHimuro: Oh, is that so? Then I’ll show you I can score on you when you’re playing your best.\n\nKagami: That’s what I like to hear! Awesome! I can’t wait!\n\n– – –"
