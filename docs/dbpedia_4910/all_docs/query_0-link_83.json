        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nReviews\n\nThe first season is more of an introduction of the characters and the world in which Bungo Stray Dogs is set. Mainly a Detective Agency where ppl have supernatural abilities. There's not much of an ongoing plot and is more episodic for the first season. Not bad but not great... It gets much more interesting by the 3rd season and the 4th season is heads and shoulders above the 1st. It gets into murder mystery detective stories and conspiracies. The special powers are also unique and original, not just ur run of the mill elemental powers or general magic. There are ... several wellrounded, likable characters.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWhat a fun concept to use literary figures as the main characters of the story! And what a shame not to make full use of such a fun concept! Besides the names of the their special abilities and the occasional jokes alluding to literary works, the characters' personalities do not seem to reflect those of the literary figures that they are meant to embody. An interesting clash of philosophies, of cultural differences, and of overall personal expressions could have been shown with such personas as your protagonists, but I didn't see much of any of that. The conflicts that are present (jealousy over power and ... position; punctuality and precision vs nihilistic bravado; etc.) are typical of any shonen anime.\n\nIn short, I wish that the characters were flashed out a bit more. However, this is only the beginning. To fit a careful character study of each \"author\" into merely 12 eps would've been impossible, so I am hoping that this aspect of the show will be explored more in the upcoming seasons. And actually, I appreciated Atsushi's development! He goes from sacrificing himself for others out of purely suicidal intentions and feelings of unworthiness to protecting others due to a newly found appreciation for human life - an appreciation that includes his own life as well. The only thing that baffles me is his special ability: for the first 3 eps he does not even know how to transform into that tiger, let alone how to use it effectively, and then he just...decks everyone. Uses advanced fighting moves and showcases a relatively high battle IQ. Punches the living hell out of the main antagonist. How?\n\nThe animation is what I truly appreciated, btw. The fighting sequences were really entertaining for me to watch, and the dramatic beats of the narrative are executed quite well, too. On that note, I've read that some viewers felt that the show didn't find a healthy balance between its dramatic and comedic elements. And yes, it didn't (and the jokes are not even always funny and at times triggering, actually). But I think that's kinda the point? Even if it isn't intentional, this messiness definitely elevates the overall absurd, chaotic, and anxiety-inducing tone of the story for me.\n\nGotta say, I had some fun.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nBungou Stray Dogs desperately attempts to be a quirky anime that tries to tell a \"dark\" and \"gritty\" story about organized crime, detectives and their interplay with a little bit of magic sprinkled in. However, the writing, whether it be the main characters, or any of the antagonists, or even the beats of the entire plot are at best generic (not inherently a bad thing) and at worst (which is the majority of the time) pedantically annoying and annoyingly melodramatic. It so badly wants you to empathize with the main character that every 2-3 episodes it flashes back to our protagonist Atsushis backstory, to the ... point it becomes overplayed and hard to care about. There's no nuance or subtlety with the character or how his tragic upbringing really affected him outside of these flashbacks, and a moment early in the season that feels empty due to its immediate resolution. It feels like a surface level justification that has little to do with the characters growth, struggles and life. For a show that's about detectives, psychology, and understanding the human being- its delivers nothing but shallow analysis and conclusions. It's boring and unentertaining.\n\nSpeaking of boring and unentertaining, the \"Gifted\" systems implementation feels like a half baked idea to me. On one hand, I totally understand the desire to add some degree of a power system to a story like this as it has some noteworthy potential- but this suffers from a similar issue as to what I felt like the Imperial Relics from Akame ga Kill did- there's no real cohesion with what's being chosen for gifts. It's just a power system but for detectives, with some having interesting implementations, with strengths and notable weaknesses like Kunikidas- and others feeling entirely haphazard like Akutagawa or Nakajimas. They don't seem to fit in the overall narrative cohesion of the story, and are more akin to \"cool superpowers that we wanted to include\" with there being no real precedent for what being \"Gifted\" actually is outside of apparently being magic that is somehow extremely prevalent but simultaneously not relevant in the public sphere.\n\nA note about the characters, their designs, etc. While this may be more of a personal preference, I don't think any of their designs were all that interesting or memorable. It's a situation where each of the characters were meant to fill a specific aesthetic, but also be designed in a way that they reflect their personalities but often come off as strangely uninspired and uninteresting. I feel like I've seen all of them in another anime, whether it be the archetypes and rolls they fill, their personality, and even their powers- each one of them feels so bland I don't really expect to remember them outside of the names of the authors they stem from. Which is another fairly strong point of contention I have in regards to one character.\n\nOsamu Dazai, the pen name for the author Shūji Tsushima, was a Japanese author who died in a double suicide via drowning in 1938. How does this anime interpret the tragic death of a real human being? By relegating much of the characters dialogue, and near every single one of his gags, to be how badly he wants to participate in a double suicide with a pretty woman. His character was first introduced attempting to kill himself via drowning in a river. It's so unabashedly tasteless, and frankly speaking its gross and was a horrible note to begin this series off with- and it set the precedent for the standard of humor and overall writing this show was to present.\n\nMuch of the show persists on an episodic format, introducing characters steadily that have a mild influence or importance to the story on the whole, and are relegated to importance later on- which I can only assume to be in its following seasons. If a character is introduced in an episode, then its more likely than not their arc will be concluded in that same episode. there's nothing inherently wrong with an episodic format, some of the greatest stories ever told have been done so in this medium. Stray Dogs, however, doesn't tell any interesting stories, or build the mystique of the world through this format. It wants to leave little crumbs of information that build towards a grander narrative, but that narrative is paper thin and I just don't think its good.\n\nSo far as positives I think the animation quality is fine, same with the directing of action sequences (however the lows for the action scenes are just rock bottom, like the gunfight in early episode 11). They're plenty punchy and tight, with the comedy scenes (while I don't think there's much humor to be found in the show) do a plenty fine job at conveying the attempts at humor and stylization that befits them- but that's not enough to carry the show, or even really do enough to help overcome the shows weaknesses.\n\nBungou Stray Dogs really doesn't care about its story or its characters, or even the real people they draw their names from. It's embarrassingly unfunny, bland, uninspired, and a slog to watch through. It was a struggle to force myself to watch this show, which is an utter shame as the premise was interesting- I wouldn't have considered it if there wasn't something I thought was worth my time. But the execution of the already struggling story results in a bad season. I'll more likely than not give the subsequent seasons a shot to see if they were able to redeem itself, but my hopes for what follows have plummeted.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for November\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for November Week 1: November 5 - 11 Anime Releases Dragon Ball Z 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition Bl...read more\n\nNov 4, 2019 11:17 AM by Sakana-san | Discuss (3 comments)\n\n2019 April Fools' Day Collection\n\nEach year, April Fools' Day gives a chance for creators in the anime, manga, and games industry to showcase their creativity.
