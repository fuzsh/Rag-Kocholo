        "text": "Warning: I’m on mobile and have no formatting, also I will probably be screaming nonsense the whole time. XDDDDDD\n\nAlright, so in the room where his panel was, there was a screen on the right side, and the table was in the middle. Suwabe-san came out from behind the screen and we could see his shadow XDDDDDDD He introduced himself mostly in English!!! His English is actually really good XPPP\n\nHe told us to call him “Be-san” XDDDDD and as a joke, he said it was only for the Ladies, but the guys did it as well. Sadly I missed it ;-; and idek why I just did… T^T\n\nThe MC proceeded to ask him questions.\n\nOne of them was about if he ever came to the US before, and he said that this was his second time, his first in LA specifically and his first time in general was in Atlanta. Then he was asked if he got to do like sightseeing and other things to do, and he said that he went to Santa Monica and took a picture with the Hollywood sign which, “I will post it on Twitter later” XDDDDD\n\nHe got asked about being a seiyuu, and he said that it wasn’t something he had wanted to do since childhood. His first role was a random Soldier 1 and the only line he had was *cue scream* *cue fan’s scream as well*\n\nThen they talked about Gangsta (and when we walked in they handed us a gangsta paper/thing) They showed the preview and he said that Worick, his character, was really sexy XPPPPP and that all of them were really sexy. He said that the director asked him to make Worick’s voice higher than the other guy’s (who was voiced by Tsuda Kenjiro!) *cue random high pitched scream* XDDDDDDDDDD\n\nEDIT: THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT AIRING ANIME AND MENTIONED SHOKGEKI NO SOUMA AND AHHHH HAYAMA AKIRAAAAAAAAA!!! He also said that he’s glad we still enjoy his older works because the anime season ends in three months in Japan!\n\nThey also talked about Space Dandy and showed a clip of I think episode 20, where Be-san’s character Dandy was singing\n\nAND HE ACTUALLY SANG!! I WAS SO SURPRISED BUT AOSKMCOSKWKDNCNIEJDKCKOWKDMCO it was like on of those joke-type songs BUT STILL IT WAS BEAUTIFUL XDDDDDD\n\nThey also showed the Live Action trailer in English, and Suwabe’s voiceover! He said that one day he would like to see the live action with him in it XDDDDDDDD\n\nThe Bones president Masahiko Minami also came for a little bit!!! He said that he likes having the girls scream at him like they scream at Suwabe-san 😂 Be-san said they were “best friends (in English)” and put his arm around him >o<\n\nMinami-san also said that he thought the English voice of Dandy was really similar and he was like “don’t you think so too?” And someone shouted NO! XDDDDDDD\n\nSadly he had to leave early :( because he had more work to do, and someone shouted “Ganbare!” XDDDDDDD\n\nDuring the Space Dandy stuff the little Nyan mascot thing (sorry, haven’t watched it yet ;-;) came out! They said that he couldn’t talk to us though XDDDDDDDDD\n\nAfter that there was a short little Q&A. (Out of order probably!!) The first person talked about how he does a lot of Otome drama CDs and asked what the challenges were with using a dummy head mic versus a normal mic. Be-san explained what the mic was and how it worked, and he said that it looked like a gorilla 😂😂😂 He said that it was hard to imagine it as a “jousei (what even is spelling)” as he hugged you and “I LOVE YOU” (whisper) EVERYONE SCREAMING AND AUWKKDJVNDKWODCKMCHDHSJD I CANNOT I STILL GET LIKE THIS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT 😍😭😍😍😍❤️❤️\n\nSome Japanese person asked him to do Aomine’s “the only one who can beat me is me” (I’m 90% sure, I mean what else does Aomine say that’s famous? XP) *CUE MORE DYING AGHHHHH SOWICNNVJENENF*\n\nSomeone else asked who, in the industry, he thought was the most attractive, and Be-san said that everyone was all so attractive, it was too hard to pick just one. (AWWWWWW <3333)\n\nThen someone asked what he likes to do on his free time, and he said “driving” and “taking his dog for walks” (AWWWWWWWWWWW <333)\n\nThe last person asked about this drama cd series with Jeffrey and asked him who his favorite character was besides his own. Suwabe said that his favorites were always the one he voiced, so it would be Jeffrey XDDDDD\n\nAND THEN IT WAS THE GOODBYE COMMENT 😭\n\nHe said that he was really happy to be here and to meet his international fans! He also said that he’s glad we enjoy his works in Japanese, his natural language.\n\nWE ALL WAVED GOODBYE AND PEOPLE STARTED GETTING UP SO I HAD TO STAND UP TO SEE AND LIKE I FORGOT WHAT HE SAID BUT HE SAID SOMETHING AND UGHHHH 😭😭😭 I CRIED\n\nAlso in the middle somewhere someone yelled “I love you” and he said “I love you too” AND WKEMCMSOSJNVNDNWNCQLKWKA\n\nAhh, anyways, his signature is like the most beautiful thing ever. And his LAUGH AND SMILE SO PRECIOUS ❤️❤️❤️ >o<\n\nSuwabe-san is so adorably shy and humble and kind <3 And he knows how to make the fans scream XDDDDDDDD\n\nBut really, in all seriousness, he is really nice!!!\n\nHe did all the standby autographs (idk bout day 1) and also random info he used “watashi” which I mean i dunno if you wanted to know that but yeah XPPPPP\n\nExcuse me while I go die of feels again…\n\nSo, so good to see the guys on stage again! Kiiyan was super high tension and having a great time.\n\nOpening song was Trash Candy; closing song was Bararai\n\nOh the screams when Kiiyan did the monologue in the middle of Sugar (Nakahara Chuuya-sama)\n\nLovers High is freakin’ adorable live. Seriously cute!\n\nNichijou Horizon! I really didn’t expect that to be on the set list. Nor Gambit and Yokubou mugendai.\n\nKiiyan was so excited about Yokubou that he accidentally kicked over his mic stand. Good thing he had the mic in his hand.\n\nRAIN BEAT. ACOUSTIC. It’s absolutely gorgeous. Kiiyan’s voice was sublime.\n\nKiiyan was pumped at the number of Yamaguchi fans.\n\ne-zuka’s punning has rubbed off on Val. He called for fans from Kumamoto to “kumamon (come on)” during Go for It!\n\nI ended up front row thanks to an older woman who was so surprised to see me that she let me in front of her, and I squeezed in between an RG and an RB. I was in front of the amps, to the right of e-zuka, but with a great view of the stage.\n\nAnd yep, they noticed me. Kiiyan saw me right way and behind e-zuka’s back gave me one of his patented dorky faces: brows raised way high, eyes wide and crazy looking. Heh. He gestured my way during one of the early songs too. (darlin’, I think). And during darlin’, right after the guitar intro, when Kiiyan started singing, e-zuka lounged against a speaker, pointed to someone behind me, pretended to be chatting with them, then did the same for me. ^_^\n\nAt different times, both Takita and Kiiyan stretched to stand with one foot on the stage, one on the barrier. A few girls apparently tweeted that the leg hair on Takita’s legs was really soft. Kiiyan … well, I didn’t get touch either because they did this about 10-15 feet from where I was, but I didn’t nee to touch to see that Kiiyan’s legs are still amazingly smooth and oh my god how sculpted. His calves are nicely muscled, and that continues up to his thighs (he was wearing shorts for the second half of the show).\n\nAnd speaking of those shorts … at one point he was fumbling around with them, and as e-zuka commented on it, Kiiyan came out with a key. On a wooden key chain. His hotel room key. Wtf was that doing down the back of your shorts, Kiiyan!? He read off the number and “made in Japan” and offhandedly said “Hakata,” at which point everyone was like “ooooh.” Realizing his mistake, he backpedaled, said he was joking. Wonder how many girls went roaming Hakata hotels after the show…. heh.\n\nHe said something about his rear I couldn’t quite figure out. Just that he was commenting on his right butt check and then the left. And he patted each side.\n\nHe also thanked the other half of the front row for their lovely breasts. And at one point asked one girl if she was okay (maybe she was in danger of falling out?) prompting e-zuka to not leave the rest of the front row out, asking if we were all okay. And then said something I didn’t catch that clearly embarrassed the heck out of Kiiyan. Heh.\n\nNo new announcements, but they talked about G11 and the live viewing. When Kiiyan brought up the kaigai viewings, e-zuka trotted out the joke they’ve been having since Kiiyan got his passport – that he got it for the live viewings.\n\nKiiyan’s mom was there on the 2nd floor (and so of course heard Kiiyan’s breast talk). When the show was over, and the lights up, we all waved at her. She waved back, then grabbed a bottle of water and gestured as if to say “should I toss it?” (as Kiiyan had done). Of course we urged her to, so she did, then was immediately embarrassed in a very cute fashion. Then she went back to waving and then made a heart shape with her hands. So. Damn. Adorable! Thank you for giving us Kiiyan, and for showing his fans love.\n\nCan’t wait for todays’ show!"
