        "text": "The advent of Tournament Karate and Overseas Instructors\n\nAfter Funakoshi’s death there came the first All Japan Championships. Here we saw emerging the most gifted exponent of Shotokan since maybe Gigo Sensei. At least this was the opinion of the entire JKA. Kanazawa Hirokazu Sensei won the kumite division, with a broken wrist; a story which has become a part of Shotokan history. The same year, he with Mikami Takayuki and Takahura Eiji,were the first three graduates of the first JKA instructor’s programme which was overseen by Nakayama and Okazaki Sensei. Okazaki was never allowed to compete because the JKA wanted him to play a pivotal role in being a referee as well as the trainer for the instructor program.\n\nThe following year in 1958, Kanazawa was again in the kumite final this time against his good friend and roommate Mikami. Kanazawa had already won the kata division but fought Mikami to a literal stale-mate in the final. They circled each other for minutes without landing a technique in what became more of a psychological battle instead of a physical one. Eventually they were heralded as joint champions with many witnesses claiming it was the best fight they ever saw. In 1959 however Mikami got the better of him and defeated him in both the kata and kumite divisions becoming the first outright grand champion (Kanazawa was heralded Grand Champ in 1958 despite the draw).\n\nKanazawa Sensei’s time was short lived on the tournament circuit, as he became the literal prototype for Shotokan and was the first instructor sent overseas to Hawaii in 1961. He was replaced by Asai Tetsuhiko a few years later and returned to Japan. On the point of his return there were several more instructors who emerged from the kenshui programme which was nicknamed the “Hornet’s Nest” by Stan Schmidt a South African kenshui graduate. Chief of these were Shirai Hiroshi, Enoeda Keinosuke, Ueki Masaaki, Ochi Hideo, Oishi Takeshi, Abe Keigo, Yaguchi Yutaka and Asai Tetsuhiko.\n\nIn 1965 Kanazawa, Enoeda, Shirai and their senior Kase Teiji were sent to Europe to establish Shotokan in Britain. There apparently was Shotokan there before but the level was very poor technically. Together with Kanazawa, Enoeda made massive improvements to the standard of Karate in England, Shirai and Kase went to France and Italy. When Kanazawa left Europe, Enoeda remained where the KUGB: Karate Union of Great Britain was established.\n\nCue the 1970s and the zenith of the JKA. This decade alone saw some of their most amazing competitors. With Kanazawa, Enoeda, Asai, Ueki and co. already retired from competition and teaching abroad, the time came for a new crop of talent to emerge. And emerge they did!\n\nInstructor Program Graduate List\n\nName Year Rank Position Mikami Takayuki 1957 8th dan USA JKA/AF Southern Takaura Eiji 1957 Kanazawa Hirokazu 1957 10th dan Founder SKIF Tsushima Toshio 1958 Yaguchi Yutaka 1958 9th dan USA ISKF Mountain States Ouchi Kyo 1959 Sato Masaki 1959 *Saito Shigeru 1959 Inaba Mitsue 1960 Kano Masahiko 1960 Watanabe Gunji 1960 *Ogata Kyoji 1960 Kisaka Katsuharu 1961 USA Nakaya Ken 1961 Ogawa Eiko 1961 Ueki Masaaki 1961 8th dan HQ Full-Time Instructor Keinosuke Enoeda 1961 9th dan Deceased 29th March 2003. *Miyazaki Satoshi 1961 8th dan Deceased 31st May 1993. *Mori Osamu 1961 *Takahashi Yoshimasa 1961 *Majima Kenshiro 1962 Sakai Ryusuke 1962 7th dan Jitsuhara Shoji 1963 Ochi Hideo 1963 8th dan JKA Germany.

However the kumite was quite literally a two horse race between Oishi Takeshi and Tanaka Masahiko. Other top competitors included Iida Norihiko and Yahara Mikio. With an overseas collaboration with Nishiyama and Okazaki Sensei who both were in the United States at the time, the JKA established the IAKF: International Amateur Karate Federation. Which was more or less held the first world championships for Shotokan.\n\nWinds of Change: Kanazawa’s Expulsion and Nakayama’s death\n\nDue to apparent irreconcilable differences Nakayama Sensei had Kanazawa expelled from the JKA in 1977. It was the first crack that emerged in the JKA massif. To this day, no one knows for sure what occurred, but what was obvious was that JKA parted ways with their golden boy. Kanazawa went on to start his own organisation called SKIF: Shotokan Karate-do International Federation. Thus the JKA lost a lot of affiliate organisations in the process.\n\nThe JKA continued to thrive in spite of this, but then came the death of Nakayama in 1987. After which, Asai sensei was installed as the chief instructor temporarily. There however emerged a heated legal battle that created a distinctive rift in the organisation. This led to the split between the current Chairman Nakahara and the Matsuno section. Under the Nakahara section which eventually won the legal rights to the JKA was Tanaka, Osaka, Kawawada, Imamura, Izumiya, Naka, Ueki, Oishi, Iida and Taniyama. The Matsuno section consisted of instructors who ultimately left when in the late 90s the courts ruled for the rights to be given to Nakahara Nobuyuki. These instructors were Asai, Abe, Yahara, Isaka and Kagawa among others. The largest JKA exodus occurred in 2000 when Abe, Asai and Yahara left and opened their own organisations. That was the same year that Kanazawa Sensei was awarded his 10th dan (not by the JKA who don’t recognise this rank) and he was the first instructor to be awarded this rank while still alive. Okazaki Sensei although senior to Kanzawa, was awarded his 10th dan grade after him. Even the overseas affiliates such as KUGB and ISKF (Okazaki) became independent ultimately from the JKA.\n\nFor instance when Enoeda died in 2003 the JKA appointed Ohta Sensei who was Enoeda’s assistant since 1982 as the chief instructor, although he was junior to many of Enoeda’s British based students like Andy Sherry and Robert Poynton. This led Sherry and co. to split from the JKA and form their own organisation keeping the KUGB name. Today, there are several different Shotokan organisations with worldwide recognition, and this is because they are led by former JKA stalwarts.\n\nI personally believe that this rift would have been inevitable regardless of if Kanazawa was not expelled or if Nakayama was still alive. The reason is that one organisation could never have enough room for so many juggernauts. It is said that the Shotokan curriculum must be strictly adhered to until one attains 3rd or 4th dan. After which, the practitioner is seen as being comfortable with his techniques, and is able to evolve it to fit is personal interpretation of Karate. Which are what technicians such as Kanazawa, Asai and Yahara did. Therefore it is inconceivable that these masters would stay under the same umbrella till today.\n\nHowever, the JKA still remains as one of the largest and most significant martial arts organisations today, helping spread the knowledge of Karate across the globe thus making it a household name.\n\nKarate in the modern scope\n\nToday Shotokan is still the most well known martial art. Many traditional ultras criticise Shotokan for the way it changed Karate. For instance, the advent of tournament Karate paved the way for many other styles whether traditional or eclectic to do so as well. In all fairness however, Judo long before had competitions and was still revered as an effective martial art.\n\nRegardless Shotokan has its many critics because of its constant evolution which has popularised the martial art in the process. In the sport karate arena the general image has changed with new organisations such as the WKF: World Karate Federationbeing formed. The addition of the red/blue colouration, similar to Taekwondo has helped market the tournament circuit much to the disapproval of traditional circles. Shotokan, along with Wado-Ryu, Goju-Ryu and Shito-Ryu are the recognised styles within the WKF. I think that these developments were inevitable because ultimately the powers that be, want to see Karate become an Olympic event at long last. Whether or not that would be a benefit, remains to be seen.\n\nIn conclusion, no one can deny the influence Shotokan has had on global martial arts as Funakoshi taught several students who in turn founded their own systems. Such as Choi Yong-Eui (Oyama Masutatsu), Choi Hong Hi and Otsuka Hirnori founded Kyokushin, modern Taewondo and Wado-Ryu Karate respectively. Nevertheless despite the evidence apparent throughout history, topics such as this will always, most definitely be debatable.\n\nEnd."
