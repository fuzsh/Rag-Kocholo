        "text": "Get early access to audio commentaries like this one at Patreon. You can download an audio file there or on Substack, or listen on YouTube.\n\nBungo Stray Dogs kicks off a new season! Listen to me ramble a bit making (mostly wrong) predictions for what will happen in the season premiere, followed by (at 9:22 audio commentary that you can listen to while watching along to the episode on the Crunchyroll web site (#JustAMeeting).\n\nSpoiler warning for content up to Chapter 105 of the Bungo Stray Dogs manga and all of the light novels.\n\nThanks to Ko-fi and Patreon contributors Emily Lauer and Ellak Roach.\n\nA transcript of the audio commentary with time stamps follows.\n\n00;00;01;15 – 00;00;27;10\n\nHello, I’m Derek S. McGrath, my pronouns are he/him/his. And this is my first time recording an audio commentary. This is new content I’m developing for initial release on my Patreon. You can support my writing, research, and content like this at patreon.com/dereksmcgrath. Thank you for your consideration. But what is this exactly?\n\n00;00;27;24 – 00;01;03;10\n\nWell, today is Wednesday, January 4, 2023, and that is the premiere for Season 4 of Bungo Stray Dogs. I have been a big fan of this show for some time, although it was slow going getting into it. If you haven’t watched the series, the short version is that it’s an anime based on an ongoing manga and light novel series in which real life authors have superpowers, engage in shenanigans, and hunt down a book that if you write in it, you can make anything come into reality.\n\n00;01;04;23 – 00;01;33;17\n\nI had just said it was slow going for me to get into the series and, sadly, some of that is due to my own ignorance. I’m a literature scholar, I have a PhD in literature, so you would think a story in which you have Atsushi Nakajima as a tiger person versus Ryūnosuke Akutagawa and his magical overcoat would be compelling. But that’s not where my research is.\n\n00;01;33;17 – 00;02;06;00\n\nI specialize in 19th-century U.S. literature primarily. So it wasn’t until Season 2 of the anime when it introduced authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne that I got more into the series. The manga and light novels started in 2012 and are written by Kafka Asagiri, with numerous illustrators behind the many iterations of the franchise, including Sango Harukawa, Kanai Neko, Ganjii, and Oyoyoyo.\n\n00;02;06;00 – 00;02;38;13\n\nThe anime adaptation is directed by Takuya Igarashi, written by Yōji Enokido, with music by Taku Iwasaki and the new theme song titled “True Story” performed by the band Screen Mode, which spoiler before recording, I already listened to the full four-minute-and-seconds theme song. It’s really good this season. I’m probably going to be disappointed with how the visuals match if it’s anything like the Season 3 opening, but I’m going on tangents.\n\n00;02;38;13 – 00;03;12;13\n\nThe ending theme “Shirushi” is performed by Luck Life, who has done an ending theme to the previous seasons of the anime. The Japanese cast includes Yuto Uemura as Atsushi, Mamoru Miyano as Osamu Dazai, Kensho Ono as Akutagawa, and Kisho Taniyama as Chuuya Nakahara. There are numerous other characters in this series, and I’ll credit who I think may pop up in today’s episode in a moment.\n\n00;03;12;13 – 00;03;45;23\n\nSo, what awaits us in Season 4 of Bungo Stray Dogs? This is where we get into spoilers, so, if you don’t want to know what awaits us this season, I suggest not listening to these audio commentaries until this season wraps up or until you finish reading the manga, because, yeah, I’m going to get into some manga spoilers up what has come out as of today, January 4, 2023–and that will be Chapter 105 of the manga, now out in Japan.\n\n00;03;46;07 – 00;04;24;11\n\nSo, if you don’t want spoilers, stop listening here until you get to Chapter 105 of the manga. Still here? Okay. At the end of Season 3 of the anime, Atsushi and Akutagawa managed to help stop Fyodor Dostoyevsky–yes, that Dostoyevsky–from his campaign of violence and got him arrested. Season 4 is going to see how Dostoyevsky now acts as a threat from prison, as one mastermind behind a scheme to get Atsushi and his allies wrongfully accused of a crime they did not commit.\n\n00;04;25;04 – 00;04;50;29\n\nIf this was any other anime, Bungo Stray Dogs would pick up right after. And that would mean we would pick up with an adaptation of Chapter 54 of the manga, in which we see Dostoyevsky’s next scheme depends on Mushitaro Oguri, played in the anime by Takashi Kusao, as he has been using his ability to erase evidence of Dostoyevsky’s crimes.\n\n00;04;51;14 – 00;05;27;21\n\nIt is now up to Atsushi’s coworker Ranpo Edogawa, played by Hiroshi Kamiya, and his rival Edgar Allan Poe, played by Toshiyuki Morikawa, to stop Oguri’s schemes. But Bungo Stray Dogs is sadly not a typical anime. This is where we get into a problem. Back in November 2021, I wrote a post on my WordPress–dereksmcgrath.wordpress.com–about what a Season 4 of Bungo Stray Dogs could look like–and this led to a problem.\n\n00;05;27;21 – 00;06;13;26\n\nFor each season of the anime, Studio BONES adapts not only the manga but one of series creator Kafka Asagiri’s light novels. Season 1 adapted one of Dazai’s first missions, Season 2 adapted a novel about Dazai’s past, and Season 3 adapted a novel about Chuuya’s origin story. Seasons 2 and 3 started off the season with these light novels–and, honestly, as good as the one for Season 2 was, these adaptations tend to disrupt the flow of the ongoing story, and they don’t usually connect in any meaningful way with the themes or characters of that season.\n\n00;06;14;10 – 00;06;39;27\n\nMore often, they set up stuff that won’t pay off until seasons down the road. And I don’t expect things will get better with this season if Season 4 premieres today with a light novel adaptation. Like I said, I haven’t watched the new episode. I haven’t even seen any screen captures or preview images, so I don’t know what awaits us.\n\n00;06;40;06 – 00;07;06;10\n\nBut if I had to take a guess, what do I think Season 4 would start with? If we don’t start with Ranpo and Poe versus Oguri, I think we’re going to start with an adaptation of the light novel that shares more about Chuuya’s origin story. I haven’t said much about Chuuya in these introductory remarks, and if he is the focus of this Season 4 premiere, I’ll share more during the commentary and after the episode finishes.\n\n00;07;07;00 – 00;07;33;21\n\nBut his backstory is so not necessary for this season–at all. Season 3 was really bad at this in terms of shoehorning Chuuya’s origin story without that having any bearing on the plot for the rest of the season. At least if Season 4 is another Chuuya light novel adaptation, then at least at some point we’re continuing that story.\n\n00;07;33;21 – 00;08;02;21\n\nAnd, bonus, this story is actually entertaining. The previous season’s story about Chuuya was for worldbuilding that doesn’t do much to pay off anything–except maybe a few details that will finally come up in Season 4. At least the second Chuuya light novel, if that is indeed what is adapted today, has some actual pathos and heart and good comedy. Like, it’s a story about an android named Adam Frankenstein.\n\n00;08;03;24 – 00;08;33;21\n\nI repeat: Bungo Stray Dogs, in canon, has Frankenstein’s monster as a character–and he is this awkward pleasant man who is stuck having to act as Chuuya’s babysitter and shenanigans ensue. You may think, “Didn’t the trailers and promotional artwork for this season feature only the ongoing manga plot? And didn’t the cast announcements only bring up the manga characters, not these light novel characters?”\n\n00;08;34;10 – 00;08;59;19\n\nAnd you’re correct: there is no promotional art or casting announcements that I’ve seen for Adam and other characters from that light novel — yet. I wouldn’t be surprised if I haven’t seen it yet this afternoon that there is information already out now that the episode’s premiered showing those casting announcements and promotional artwork, but we’ll see in a moment.\n\n00;08;59;19 – 00;09;26;29\n\nI have been lucky enough to avoid any content on social media or other parts of the Internet showing off more spoilers — aside from getting to listen to the full opening theme song and not seen the visuals that go with that, thank goodness. But enough of all of that. This has been long enough preamble to today’s audio commentary. I’m going to pull up today’s episode, which you can watch on Crunchyroll.\n\n00;09;27;10 – 00;09;54;02\n\nAnd since I’m pretty sure the previous seasons of Bungo Stray Dogs were union dubs, it is all the more vital to support actors unions, so #Just A Meeting, Crunchyroll. I have the episode pulled up and have paused it, so after I do a “3, 2, 1, unpause” countdown, you can unpause the episode where you have it and listen along to my commentary.\n\n00;09;54;20 – 00;10;24;19\n\nThis is my first time watching this episode, so please forgive me if a lot of this is “first thought theater” rather than more reasoned thoughts, which I’ll share after finishing this episode. Everyone ready? Okay. Starting the countdown to pause with 3… 2… 1… unpause. Just given the episode title and what we’re going to see at the beginning, I’m shocked we’re doing this.\n\n00;10;24;19 – 00;10;50;25\n\nThe fact that it says this is a story about parenting, and we’re starting with Fukuzawa… And we’re seeing the newspaper reports and we already have Ranpo as part of the title– I can’t believe we’re doing an adaptation of the light novel that is about the origins of the Armed Detective Agency. This should have been the adaptation last season.\n\n00;10;51;16 – 00;11;30;28\n\nLast season was going to be about Fukuzawa and what he means to the Agency. And instead it starts with having the Chuuya story. We needed to know how Rumple met Fukuzawa earlier and we didn’t get that. And now we’re finally getting it, and I can’t be more excited. And now we have the opening, and… I’m glad we’re doing this theater opening because that’s going to be relevant for this season’s plot since it is about how Fukuzawa and Ranpo first meet.\n\n00;11;30;28 – 00;11;56;09\n\nYeah, and now I’m just silent because they are making this such a theatrical opening, which I love seeing… At best, what I could say that makes this connect into the overall season arc is that Ranpo and Fukuzawa has such a tie in to our antagonist from the Hunting Dogs, so we do need that build up. And there he is.\n\n00;11;56;09 – 00;12;35;23\n\nThere’s Fukuchi, our– one of our antagonists this season. I’m going to try to avoid certain spoilers regarding him… And that– that curry you just saw should be very familiar, which means, yes, you are going to see Oda in this season as well. I’m– If you saw the Season 2 opener, it did show Ranpo recognize Oda, and there’s a reason, as this arc is going to show that Oda’s path has crossed Ranpo’s before, although not in the way you would expect.\n\n00;12;36;11 – 00;13;20;27\n\nI am just floored we’re getting this as an opening. This is so good to finally get Ranpo’s origin story and how he met Fukuzawa… Having not read this light novel but reading the wiki page for it, is also exciting, getting to finally have anime designs for characters that I only read about and never saw… This is a little bizarre.\n\n00;13;21;06 – 00;14;14;07\n\nI remember this plot, and I don’t remember this person being there before. I’m kind of wondering if this is going to be revealed as Ranpo’s father, but I don’t think it is. I think this is the secretary to the pharmacy CEO… Yep, it is. This is the CEO of the pharmacy. This is their secretary. Studio BONES, again, not showing faces because it saves on the animation budget. Just kidding — it’s a stylistic choice, I get it, it’s that these aren’t very important characters. they’re just here to be characters who were killed off to set off the mystery.\n\n00;14;14;07 – 00;14;46;09\n\nAnd now Fukuzawa wants to meet the assassin… And… yeah, some of you people who really enjoyed how Season 2 started are really going like who the assassin is… That’s just hilarious. Fukuzawa’s told, “Don’t touch the documents,” so he’s like, “Fine, I’ll do it in the most dramatic way possible.” There he is. We have brought back Oda, and… wow, I did not realize how young Oda was in this flashback.\n\n00;14;46;29 – 00;15;28;10\n\nI thought he was older, but yeah, that makes sense. Child assassin. Wow. I didn’t know Oda was that young when he first met Fukuzawa. I’ve complained about how Studio BONES tried to make Dazai and Chuuya look a lot younger in their kid designs. But here? They made Oda look young. And now we’re interrupted with Ranpo’s arrival. And, of course, he has to interrupt our secretary explaining everything…\n\n00;15;28;10 – 00;16;10;15\n\nI’m glad that they gave the secretary this Ango-like design, and now he’s just really tired of Ranpo interrupting everything… (laugh) Now I’m just reading the subtitles because I’m just impressed that Ranpo has arrived on the scene and made his characterization so clear from the beginning, that had direction– easy– just completely capable at being able to discern the situation, but also just constantly plagued by his instincts:\n\n00;16;10;15 – 00;16;48;21\n\nIf he’s hungry, he’s going to tell you; if he’s lost, he’s going to tell you… And now he’s ignoring the evidence itself because he just wants the job to be able to feed himself. And he already calls out the lie that the secretary is giving to cover up for the crime. “The old man can speak,” Ranpo says… And Ranpo’s just walking all over the evidence, not even caring.\n\n00;16;49;09 – 00;17;26;25\n\nAnd then he opens up the window, just ruining the secretary’s work. Got to give it to Studio BONES, they know how to stage something like this to just be so visually dynamic. Like, here go all the papers, and now Ranpo gets the one sheet he wants… And we get more of Ranpo’s powers of observation, as he points out that no one stole any of the documents and that Oda didn’t kill this president.\n\n00;17;27;04 – 00;18;14;08\n\nIt was indeed the secretary who did it… I know I’m just being an obsessive fan about this. I am so glad we’re getting this adaptation. I am so glad we’re finally seeing how Ranpo and Fukuzawa met. And Ranpo just calls out the secretary for covering up and doing a sloppy job of covering up for this murder. And the best the secretary can do is say, “This kid is lying, kick them out.”\n\n00;18;14;08 – 00;18;51;01\n\nRanpo just plants himself up on the desk. This light novel that was the inspiration for this– (laughs) And Ranpo does the little fingerprints pose to demonstrate, pushing the president out the window– As I was saying, this light novel that became this anime episode also was a stage play. So, I’m curious how much Studio BONES pull from the siege play. I haven’t had a chance to watch the video recording of that play, so I would be curious how much Studio BONES pulled from it or how much they just went in their own direction.\n\n00;18;51;15 – 00;19;19;06\n\nOne of the problems that I’m going to talk about on the next livestream — I do a livestream on Twitch and YouTube, Sundays at 11 AM — will be about this problem of how do you adapt something for anime without just sticking so close to the manga panels that you’re not trying something new. But then you look at that scene where the secretary is just taking up the entire side of the screen while calling out Ranpo.\n\n00;19;19;15 – 00;19;51;05\n\nThat’s not something you could do in a stage play. So Studio BONES was focusing on, “How do we adapt this without having a manga getting in the way where you’re so fixated on manga panels that you aren’t trying something new?” And now Oda has broken his restraints, and I’m laughing because Oda still has this deep voice, despite being a little kid now. In the original light novel, I believe Oda was not named and you didn’t see his face.\n\n00;19;51;05 – 00;20;17;23\n\nSo Fukuzawa didn’t recognize who this was. The anime decides, “No, have Oda show his face so that the audience knows who this is.” This fight scene isn’t that impressive. We had just Oda floating, and that’s supposed to look like he’s getting around everywhere. If there is a benefit: it is showing not that Fukuzawa was not able to keep track of Oda because again, Oda can predict movements.\n\n00;20;18;05 – 00;20;46;11\n\nOda has now shot the secretary dead… And now we get the blood pooling. That’s some of our first red — I haven’t brought up color use here — A little hard for me admittedly given that I am colorblind, so, kind of hard to tell exactly what I’m seeing… And Ranpo says, “Don’t even bother calling the ambulance. He’s dead anyway.” Man, Ranpo is harsh.\n\n00;20;46;11 – 00;21;16;16\n\nOda has gotten away. Ranpo brings Fukuzawa to get a ton of rice cake, or rather red bean rice cake, and then not even rice, just the red bean. Because it’s sweets. Fukuzawa asks how Ranpo could have figured all of this out. Ranpo figured this out because the secretary has his coat on while sorting through the documents, and who would do that?\n\n00;21;16;23 – 00;21;46;02\n\nHe had to have been so that people won’t look as fingers or I guess — I’ll have to remind at another point — looking at his fingerprints… Huh, I didn’t know this: Ranpo, in this iteration… I don’t remember this in the light novel, but here in the anime, he says he was trying to become a police officer, was in the training program but got kicked out because he pointed out his chief was corrupt.\n\n00;21;46;02 – 00;22;25;16\n\nAnd there we pause a moment to reveal Ranpo’s parents have already passed away… Fukuzawa goes to pay the bill and then says– Ranpo stops him, saying, “So you’re just going to leave me after I just gave my whole life story of being an orphan at 14.” (laugh) I do like that Ranpo calls him out, like, “You’re just going to abandon me?!” It’s kind of like the Iron Man 3 thing of\n\n00;22;25;16 – 00;22;53;12\n\n“I’m just a little kid and you’re going to leave me alone?” Fukuzawa explains he’s a bodyguard for the police, so he leaves his contact info with Ranpo and Ranpo is heading out with Fukuzawa paying the bill. Fukuzawa calls out to Ranpo but now has another flip phone call coming in… And it’s already Ranpo asking for help, and Fukuzawa just has the most\n\n00;22;53;12 – 00;23;19;17\n\n“I’m done with this” reaction. (laughs) Ranpo is still acting like the orphan, saying, “I’m all alone and have nowhere to go. Please help.” … I am so relieved, and I’m going to keep repeating this point that we are getting the Fukuzawa / Ranpo origin story. This is a pleasant surprise — and it will tie into Fukuchi’s story as one of the antagonists this season.\n\n00;23;19;17 – 00;23;53;10\n\nI just wasn’t expecting this… So now we go to the theater, which you already saw in the opening theme song, which was cool. I’ve already forgotten this, and forgive me for not doing research on this before starting. I know that the playwright for this theatrical work is based on a real life Japanese author. We now have the manager of the theater. Kind of reminds me of Kouyou from the Mafia a bit in design,\n\n00;23;53;10 – 00;24;31;15\n\nmostly in the face, obviously not in the hair… She’s now showing the threatening note written out in newspaper clippings, written by someone named “V,” promising to do the murder. And this has been the Chuuya origin story, It would have been Verlaine, but thankfully, that’s not who V is here… (laugh) Oh, boy…\n\n00;24;31;15 – 00;25;22;03\n\nRanpo just expected to get hired, and once he learns there will be other job candidates, he’s upset. Ooooh, boy, he just — Ranpo just called her the wrong thing… Ranpo calls out the manager here that she’s playing Fukuzawa against the police, so both of them keep the other one’s corruption in check. Fukuzawa defends himself, saying he’s just here to prevent a crime and wants to interrogate her staff members to figure out who might have sent this threatening note. (laughs)\n\n00;25;22;03 – 00;25;46;14\n\nThis is a good start for Studio BONES this season: a lot more of the comedic reaction takes. Something weird I had read on TV Tropes this week: they had complained about how much this anime was so much more slapstick-y than the manga, and I was thinking, “Have you not read the manga or the light novels?” They have plenty of these gags in there already.\n\n00;25;46;14 – 00;26;28;07\n\nThe anime actually doing animation to animate the slapstick is really good… Fukuzawa is now interviewing one of the actors who complains how long they’ve been in this business and that they’re willing to kill because they’re tired of not getting their big break… Hmm… Studio BONES is making this person have that distinctive Bungo Stray Dogs smile. So Murakami is this actor. And… yeah, the smile’s making this one look more Chuuya than they need to.\n\n00;26;28;17 – 00;27;05;26\n\nI kind of wish they varied this design a little. Ranpo is already calling out this actor for who they actually are. Fukuzawa is trying to stop him. This is doing a good job setting up the dynamic of Fukuzawa having to be Ranpo’s keeper, and Ranpo being the real brains behind this operation. More faceless actors, so literally extras. One of the other actors brings up that “Murakami is someone you should pay attention to because they’re the one who wants all the spotlight.\n\n00;27;05;26 – 00;27;48;12\n\nThey were already meeting with the playwrights”… So we get the playwright’s name as well… Another actor who is in a minor role says Murakami’s probably going to be the one who… Wait! Did they just– That one extra there just said, “I’m probably going to end up being stuck being a taxi driver later.” Is that the taxi driver who was in the Dazai and Kunikida light novel? Man, Studio BONES is just playing games where I’m going to need a stringboard connecting all these characters.\n\n00;27;48;25 – 00;28;14;05\n\nWe just skipped over Ranpo losing out on some free chocolates. He’s now going to the concession… We just had the newspaper headline that Fukuzawa is paying attention to regarding the “hawk assassins.” I don’t remember them from the light novel. I don’t know if they tie into this season’s arc. Were the “hawks” supposed to be, “the Hunting Dogs”?\n\n00;28;14;05 – 00;29;05;27\n\nI don’t think so… Ranpo is insisting that this isn’t a threat, it’s a warning. A threat would have had an “either or” scenario. This warning is a warning saying that it is a declaration to kill an actor… Kind of skipping ahead and spoiling this a bit: if you’re giving a warning, could it be that the warning is a distraction from the real crime that’s going to be committed? …\n\n00;29;05;27 – 00;30;06;09\n\nOh, wow. When Fukuzawa has his flashback, it’s in normal colors. I know that’s so weird to say, but this is such an odd color arrangement for this flashback arc, and I’m digging it that Studio BONES took a risk on this. And yeah, I’m going to be really insulting: when you have something as good as Mob Psycho and something as mid-tier as this season of My Hero Academia, I appreciate having Studio BONES taking effort in color arrangement choices. Man, and you’re doing more flashbacks, and it’s all in normal color! That’s such a weird choice, but it’s like, “Oh, okay, it doesn’t have any meaning”, but it stands out, or — no obvious meaning rather, but stands out as just, “We made a different choice.” So then the choice becomes more deliberate and obvious to the audience.\n\n00;30;06;09 – 00;30;44;26\n\nMan, I am so glad they’re adapting this light novel. I know I’ve said this before, but this is just so much more exciting than getting the Chuuya one. The Chuuya one would’ve hurt emotionally, but this one’s going to hurt too, so we’re going to get the pain but at least this ties in more to Season 4’s theme and story… (laughs) And Ranpo was doing the Sherlock routine, identifying everything about what kind of a person Fukuzawa is, including what weapon of choice he uses.\n\n00;30;44;26 – 00;31;09;10\n\nAnd Ranpo points out that the last job Fukuzawa had must have traumatized him. I don’t think the light novels or the manga have pointed this– Oh, okay. Ranpo is explaining this, and yes, this is confirmed in the manga, and this is going to tie into this season. This season we learn about the war that took place, and that’s what that headline was about.\n\n00;31;09;10 – 00;31;44;15\n\nThe hawks… Oh, wow. Studio BONES just knocked this out of the park this season already with just one episode. Fukuzawa yells, and that manages to literally put out so much breath it knocks Ranpo back. That is [a] good choice of… It breaks reality, it’s not realistic, but it gets across what you’re trying to show that Fukuzawa is a force of nature and he just knocked Ranpo over by yelling at him.\n\n00;31;44;26 – 00;32;40;19\n\nBut anyway, the backstory I talked over that Ranpo explains. We’re going to learn this season about the war that took place, and the war’s been brought up before, I think, by Mori, Fukuzawa, and others… And now I think we’re getting the ending theme, I guess. So this will be in a wrap on this episode soon. Anyway, to stop the war, the Japanese government hired Fukuzawa to assassinate military commanders and members of corporations to stop the war. Basically think the current plot of Spy x Family: here, Fukuzawa was the Twilight. So we got the ending theme and the cast and credits. No new ending title sequence yet because, you know, haven’t gotten to Season 4 proper with the actual plots. This is my first time hearing the ending theme, so I’ll be surprised how it goes.\n\n00;32;41;01 – 00;33;15;19\n\nJust looking at the credits, we can see work done by JC Staff, Silver Link, and Seven Arcs as well for Studio BONES. Not bad at all. I’m kind of surprised to see Silver Link and JC on this… So while the credits roll, I can give some quick thoughts about where things are going. We saw Natsume — the cat person that Fukuzawa worked for — in the opening credits.\n\n00;33;15;19 – 00;33;40;06\n\nYes, you are going to get him in this opening arc. No, wait, no we didn’t: we saw Fukuchi. He looks like Natsumi. So, sorry, my mistake. Same face problem. But yeah, you will get to see “Cat Man” return in this. The cat remains important to all of Bungo Stray Dogs. But Fukuchi, we haven’t gotten the proper appearance.\n\n00;33;40;06 – 00;34;14;08\n\nSo kind of weird putting him in the opening, aside from making it obvious his conflicts with Fukuzawa and how that screws things up for Ranpo. And next episode, “The Day Is a Dream, The Night Is Real.” I’m wondering how long this light novel adaptation will go because there are at least two more narrative beats, so if you don’t want spoilers for what happens in the next two episodes, you might want to stop here, and I’ll be back next week with another one of these audio commentaries.\n\n00;34;14;08 – 00;34;47;09\n\nThank you for listening. Okay, are you still there? Alright, so next two beats are — we do have a murder here at the theater, and that’s where we also get Ranpo breaking down and just explaining how difficult life is for him. And… this is a bit of an aside. A couple years ago, I had done a conference presentation about how you read neurodivergency with Ranpo’s character in Bungo Stray Dogs.\n\n00;34;47;26 – 00;35;15;06\n\nSo much of what you’re going to get in the next episode is Ranpo saying that the way he conducts himself and the way that he isn’t picking up on other people’s social cues and that he doesn’t feel like he belongs and that his family was protecting him and making him recognize his strengths and values — but now he feels like he can’t function at any job in this world.\n\n00;35;15;06 – 00;36;29;01\n\nIt is not hard to read Ranpo as a neurodivergent character. There is that danger of ascribing real world conditions to fictional characters and what that says about how you are trying to diagnose someone when you are not a trained professional — and I certainly am not. But I wasn’t making the argument as, “This is how I read Ranpo.” It was, “This is how fans who are neurodivergent have read Ranpo and how important the character has been to them for recognizing what it feels like being neurodivergent.” I will not be shocked if we get a ton of takes from this arc talking about what Ranpo means to them with that kind of characterization. I wonder what we’re going to get in the next episodes. If we are doing an adaptation of this light novel… Fukuchi, our antagonist from the Hunting Dogs, the one who was placed with Fukuzawa who we see in the opening title sequence, and, again, who is our antagonist this season… Fukuchi, from what I remember, does not pop up in that light novel.\n\n00;36;29;01 – 00;37;02;03\n\nHe wasn’t hinted yet. He wasn’t introduced in the manga yet. Will Studio BONES introduce him earlier? Will we see a flashback, or was he the person on the phone with Fukuzawa earlier? Is he someone who’s going to call him Fukuzawa and keep trying to get him back into the military?\n\nThis light novel ends with Ranpo and Fukuzawa forming the Armed Detective Agency, and the manga confirms that the first person to come visit their new office was Fukuchi.\n\n00;37;02;16 – 00;37;26;19\n\nWill Fukuchi be knocking on the door at the end of this arc, and that introduces him to Ranpo and us in the audience and sets up the threat that our heroes will be facing the rest of the season? I’m just floored after how Studio BONES, in my opinion, screwed up doing the Chuuya light novel adaptation at the beginning of Season 3 —\n\n00;37;26;28 – 00;38;01;03\n\nGetting this as the adaptation to start Season 4 is an excellent choice, and I’m just so happy they did. I’m excited to see where things go. But I’ll wrap up here with one final question: what did you think of this opening for Season 4 of Bungo Stray Dogs? I would love to know. Please comment. And if you’re interested, you can reach out to me on– Well, I’m not on much social media now, but you can find me on Discord if you’re a Patreon contributor, or you can email me, derek.s.mcgrath@gmail.com.\n\n00;38;01;17 – 00;38;07;11\n\nSo until next Wednesday, I’ve been Derek S. McGrath. You have a good day. Bye."
