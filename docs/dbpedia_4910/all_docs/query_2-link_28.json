        "text": "Birthday: February 25, 1974\n\nOther Names: Show-cha, Morikubo nii-san, moriri\n\nAge: 44\n\nBirthplace: Hachiouji, Tokyo, Japan\n\nOccupation(s): Actor, Voice Actor, Singer\n\nHobbies:\n\nSkills & Abilities:\n\nBlood Type: B\n\nYears Active: 1996 - present\n\nLabels: VIMS, Lantis\n\nHeight: 165 cm\n\nWeight: 52kg\n\nNoble Credit(s):\n\nNaruto as Shikamaru Nara\n\nPersona 4 as Yosuke Hanamura\n\nUta no Prince-sama as Kotobuki Reiji\n\nBoyfriend (Beta) as Negoto Arashi (A/N: personal fave char from Show-chan <3)\n\nSeiyuu Facts from Tumblr(seiyuuslittleforest.tumblr.com)\n\n~Morikubo enjoy thinking about various stuff while taking a bath, it seems like he gets new ideas while in the bath, so it's not surprising that he spends an hour in the bathroom\n\n~Show-chan said that Morita Masakazu's character is like an old grandmother\n\n~Morikubo said that he is bad at giving surprises, there was one time he tried to surprise the woman he loved, but it failed (He never dared to try and surprise anyone after this incident)\n\n~He is also bad at giving presents, he always asks the person what would be nice but the answer he always gets is \"Anything would be fine\" which makes him even more confused\n\n~The first time Morikubo Shoutarou met Aoi Shouta, he thought Shoutan was a girl\n\n~Morikubo Shoutarou is the first close male seiyuu friend Shouta had\n\n~\"My mom loves seiyuu.

I adore him as if he was my older brother. From my point of view, Morikubo looks so cool, and he looks even cooler when he sings rock songs. He is an amazing senpai for me\" -Aoi Shouta about Morikubo Shoutarou\n\n~The first time Aoi Shouta met Morikubo Shoutarou was inside the dressing room. Morikubo didn't put himself higher than Shouta, even though it was obvious that he was the senpai. Morikubo used a gentle voice, and helped Shouta, by soothing his panicking junior, and calmly talked to him to ease his nervousness. Shoutan said that it made him really happy\n\n~Show-chan once absentmindedly tried to enter his hotel room using his house key, he spaced out for a moment thinking about what was wrong\n\n~The day Show-chan turned 41, he got hospitalized for the first time. He thought that he would be encountering a lot of misfortunes after this. When he got bored of lying on the hospital bed, he started to investigate more about his illness, and it lead him to the melody of his song Phantom Pain due to the word that popped out of his head [幻の痛み]\n\n~\"When you think 'this isn't good enough' or 'this is trash'; there will always be a reason for why you think that way. It might be because of 'this'reason or 'that' reason, but even if you do things perfectly, things still go an entirely different way. They simply happen to keep you determined to finish your goal. Because I got this theme from the time I was hospitalized, it just means that the time I spent in the hospital wasn't a waste. If I fall down, then I just have to get up again\"\n\n~When he was a student and he was tight on money, little Show-chan will use toilet freshener as a replacement for perfume, when he went back to class, his classmates complained about the smell\n\nFacts from Wikis\n\n~Morikubo and Toriumi spent the new year of 2008 and 2009 together\n\n~Got married to Asakawa Yuu on February 22, 2007 but they got divorced on January 14, 2009\n\n~Remarried an ordinary girl on July 4, 2014\n\n~Announced that he already has a child (girl) on December 29, 2017\n\nFacts from me\n\n~He can dance to Ono Daisuke's Kiss Kiss Kiss so well to the point that he says he could replace the dancer if something were to happen (He covered this song during orepara 2017)\n\n~He composed the melody for Terashima Takuma's KimiKimi Shake feat. D that can be found in the single ID\n\n~Worked in a gas station before\n\n~His famous line is 「ちょっと待ってくださいよ！」(Wait just a moment!)\n\n~He does smoke (just not sure if he stopped or not)\n\n~To star in the movie D5 with other seiyuus. The movie is said to be a legendary movie because the main cast is composed of 5 legendary seiyuus, namely, Namikawa Daisuke, Midorikawa Hikaru, Konishi Katsuyki, Kishio Daisuke and Morikubo Showtarou\n\nMusical Career\n\nSingles:\n\nThe Answer\n\nbeing the TRY\n\nLazy Mind\n\nRide Free\n\nParallel World\n\nStand down\n\nMr.CLOWN\n\nCHAIN REACTION\n\nTRIBALISM ～sunrise side～\n\nTRIBALISM ～sunset side～\n\nFocus\n\nPHANTOM PAIN\n\nTRUTH\n\nFire\n\nAlbums:\n\n臆病者のG行為\n\n叫〜kyo〜\n\n凛〜rin〜\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
