The story is about our heroine Asahina Yui who decides to revive the Starlight Orchestra because the sensei she knew from a long time ago basically ropes her and her childhood friend classmate into it and won‚Äôt take no for an answer. üòÇüòÇ\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúMobile Game Review: Kiniro no Corda ~Starlight Orchestra~‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nOtome Game Review: Heiligenstadt Lied\n\nLied, an orphan whose parents supposedly died in an accident, has recently began to live on her own (with her cockatiel ojisan BFF Soprano who can talk due to all the magic of her town of Shall). She is also a pianist for her former orphanage but she‚Äôs not really that good. Actually she really sucks at both playing piano and cooking lol. One day she meets a bunch of dudes who happen to have the magical ‚ÄúFalga‚Äù powers of famous classical pianists. An evil force called the Forgotten Apostle comes and tries to steal all the sound from the town because of the ‚Äúevil noise‚Äù that‚Äôs coming from the darkness inside the performers. Most average people are affected but Lied is safe ‚Äì so now she joins the musical academy to work with everyone to help restore music back to Shall and defeat the Forgotten Apostle. Continue reading ‚ÄúOtome Game Review: Heiligenstadt Lied‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nOtome Game Review: Fortissimo\n\nWell this was certainly not your ‚Äúaverage idol game‚Äù. Fujisaki Futaba works at the James company and the president Lily chooses her to become the new idol manager for the group Fortissimo. Futaba is a country bumpkin with no style or experience so thanks to hurls of insults from bratty underage teens and her strict boss, she ~blooms~ into a Cinderella. Continue reading ‚ÄúOtome Game Review: Fortissimo‚Äù ‚Üí\n\nMusic Game Review: Uta no Prince-sama ~Music 3~\n\nI guess now that all the fujoshis have moved on to Osomatsu-san, the Broccoli fujobait wagon has lost its fuel and so in a desperate attempt to make money, they decided to try and please their otome fans once more. With this they released UtaPri music 3, which is actually a lot like Music 1 but more Cero A~ish because the randyness of the original UtaPri game has been lost somewhere along the way. Unfortunately for anyone who has played the previous 2 music games, there‚Äôs nothing new in store for you so this is just more of the same. More after the jump!\n\nContinue reading ‚ÄúMusic Game Review: Uta no Prince-sama ~Music 3~‚Äù ‚Üí"
