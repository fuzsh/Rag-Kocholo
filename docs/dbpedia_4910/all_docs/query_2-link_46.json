        "text": "Korei is a my-pace type of person. He had little interest in women and would often appear out-of-focus. But he is actually a smart and talented leader! In the common route, Shirien was hired by Kirei, Korei’s stepbrother, to seduce Korei so that he becomes more interested in women. Kirei and Korei had a short stay at Shanasa kingdom, and Shirien basically stayed at Korei’s side to fulfill this mission. Korei was intrigued by Shirien because he genuinely thought Shirien was the character from his favourite book – that she was hakujoushi (literal translation: “The White Woman”).\n\nKorei’s route had the most questionable start. In a nutshell, Korei asked Shirien to come with him to Rin kingdom, but was turned down. Shirien then found herself thinking a lot about Korei, and visited a place which was memorable to them. She was out of luck that day as she ended up getting kidnapped and brought to Rin kingdom. She escaped and met Korei, who promised to protect her. They were horny and had their hatsu ecchi. Then literally the next day, Korei annouced to the whole kingdom that he was to marry her, and had their ceremony. Even Shirien was confused – he took the phrase “that escalated real quick” to the next level!\n\nLyla Ali, the daughter of a noble family, was to be engaged to King Lizaru of Shanasa. Lyla then hired Shirien to pretend to be her, while she makes her escape with her lover to avoid the arrangement. This was my “omg that’s why this is called Jakou no Lyla!!!” moment. When Lizaru first saw “Lyla” without her veil, he was so blown away by her beauty he actually lost his composure for a second. But Lizaru had his doubts about “Lyla” because she wasn’t known to be such a beauty. Shirien also became suspicious of Lizaru after hearing from Jemiru that a bunch of young girls have gone missing, and she caught Lizaru sneaking out in the middle of the night on multiple occasions. The whole premise was pretty much them playing catch, trying to uncover each others’ true identities.\n\nLizaru’s route honestly had a lot of twists and turns because he was hiding SO many freaking secrets! He was no ordinary king for sure. Later it was revealed that Shirien and Lizaru had actually met when they were young. They lived together in a small cave. One day, Lizaru went back to the cave and found that Shirien was gone, and he had since been looking for her. I am a huge sucker for the “meet during childhood, rejoins in adulthood” trope. Yanagi’s route in Collar x Malice also fell into similar trope, and I freaking loved it for that alone. Oh, and Lizaru also has a pet named Karuu. The official website describes it as a rare animal called Maut Guider (マウトグイーダ or “The Guider of Death” – FYI “maut” in Arabic means “the end of life”), but I think Karuu is just a black panther…?\n\n✤ Sexiest otome protagonist\n\n✤ Highly principled\n\nShirien is really dedicated to her work, both dancing and spying. She is freaking gorgeous and fully embraces her sensuality, I love her so much! The Kamal show bar frequenters call her maiyouhi (舞妖妃). I’m not sure how to best translate this, but it’s something along line of “the dancing fairy”.\n\nShirien is kind hearted, holds a strong front and is really considerate of others. She is very professional about her job – when dealing with men, she threads very carefully in order not to catch feelings! Shirien believes that men’s emotions directed towards her are mere lust and never love. For the most part, her character was consistent. But in some routes, I did occasionally find her to be too easily swayed by the love interests. I mean, who can resists?!?!! I think she was a great protagonist and I love the way she thinks. I feel like we can totally be friends irl and we would gossip about the smelly old men she has to seduce."
