        "text": "Goro Inagaki Origin/Culture/Country: Japanese\n\nGoro Inagaki: a member of the Japanese pop idol group SMAP. His career began while he was in junior high school when his sister entered his picture to a talent company. Soon, Goro was chosen to be part of one of the most famous groups in Japan, SMAP. The band proved to be popular in Japanese entertainment and Goro became a star. His first movie was in 1990 with Saraba itoshino yakuza. In 1993, Goro got his first taste of international films when he was chosen as the male lead in the romantic comedy Private Lessons II as a Japanese student who falls for his tutor. The film also had SMAP leader Masahiro Nakai. In 1994, Goro appeared with fellow SMAP member Takuya Kimura in Shoot. Goro continued making films until 1999, but still continues with SMAP today, mainly concentrating on music.\n\nGoro Miyazawa Origin/Culture/Country: Japanese\n\nGoro Miyazawa: a professional Go player[1].Miyazawa turned professional in 1966 and reached 9 dan in 1993. He currently resides in the Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan[2].\n\nGoro Azumaya Origin/Culture/Country: Japanese\n\nGoro Azumaya: a Japanese mathematician who introduced the notion of Azumaya algebra in 1951. His advisor was Shokichi Iyanaga and he is now an emeritus professor at Indiana University.\n\nGoro Shimura Origin/Culture/Country: Japanese\n\nGoro Shimura: a Japanese mathematician, and currently a professor emeritus of mathematics (former Michael Henry Strater Chair) at Princeton University.Shimura was a colleague and a friend of Yutaka Taniyama. They wrote a book (the first book treatment) on the complex multiplication of abelian varieties, an area which in collaboration they had opened up.Shimura then wrote a long series of major papers, extending the phenomena found in the theory of complex multiplication and modular forms to higher dimensions (amongst other results). This work (and other developments it provoked) provided some of the 'raw data' later incorporated into the Langlands program. It equally brought out the concept, in general, of Shimura variety; which is the higher-dimensional equivalent of modular curve. Even to define in general a Shimura variety is quite a formidable task: they bear, roughly speaking, the same relation to general Hodge structures as modular curves do to elliptic curves.\n\nGoronwy Owen Origin/Culture/Country: Welsh\n\nGoronwy Owen: was a Welsh Liberal politician and businessman.He served in France and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1916. He was promoted to Brigade Major and twice mentioned in dispatches. By 1948 however he was being referred to as having achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel[1]. After the war, he was called to the Bar by Grays Inn but the law was a subordinate interest to business and politics. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange and went into the oil business."
