But maybe Nintendo referenced to it as he only was Project Lead for Mario Kart Live from the side of EPD4? Don't know for sure.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,405\n\nI absolutely love him maths Essenc to me m\n\nShinya Takahashi is the one who took up Miyamoto's old role, if I remember correctly\n\nFor me, he is much closer to the role that Iwata played.

Anyway they are two exceptional developers and at a time when many things can change negatively at Nintendo, their presence at both the head of EPD is extremely reassuring.\n\nTheMoon\n\n(not a sphere)\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,406\n\nI absolutely love him maths Essenc to me m\n\nFor me, he is much closer to the role that Iwata played. Moreover, he was the one who appointed him to head Nintendo SPD. Koizumi looks more like the creative face of Nintendo. Anyway they are two exceptional developers and at a time when many things can change negatively at Nintendo, their presence at both the head of EPD is extremely reassuring.\n\nTakahashi literally has Miyamoto's old job (GM for all of EPD)\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,407\n\nSPD and EAD merged only in 2015 to give birth to EPD as we know it. Therefore, their respective responsibilities are not really comparable. Being in charge of EAD as was Miyamoto does not amount to the same as being in charge of EPD.\n\nThe comparison with Koizumi focuses more on the position he has held since 2015, that of creative fellow. Koizumi is gradually becoming the creative face of Nintendo, and his new responsibilities, such as its appointment to Nintendo pictures, also go in this direction.\n\nSirArthur\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,408\n\nAn interesting find.

EPD shares much of their engine tech.\n\nYeah, but that was never the case with BOTW as that game got into production well before LunchPack was established on the Wii U. I would have guessed that TotK is just an expansion of that, but it looks like maybe not then.\n\nAlso the original tweet says that \"it uses the same engine as Splatoon 3, this engine has first appeared in Switch Sports\". Which I don't know what they are refferencing as both of these run on updated LunchPack that's the thing ever since Switch era started.\n\nMisterSpo\n\nVillager\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,412\n\nNintendo could have been in the process of moving all of EPD over to Lunch Pack 2 during the last few years for the sake of development efficiency. It'll be interesting to see what they've used for Pikmin 4; I'm guessing Pikmin 3 wasn't done in Lunch Pack.\n\nILikeFeet\n\nFox Brigade\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,413\n\nMaybe some things we're brought over and adapted for Zelda. But to move engines, I'm not sure about.\n\nLukasManak22\n\nwho the fuck is that\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,415\n\nWtf, so neither Splat3 or Switch Sports aren't using LunchPack?\n\nWelcome ModuleSystems\n\nSirArthur\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,416\n\nModuleSystem lol. Interesting to see which future epd games might use this. Pikmin is next up.\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,417\n\nThat's really surprising. I guess this was probably done to keep the tools for all EPD games consistent, make it easier to shuffle around staff.\n\nILikeFeet\n\nFox Brigade\n\nMay 11, 2023\n\n#4,419\n\nModuleSystem lol.

Historically \"engine\" meant something closer to just \"renderer\", but now often means a whole stack of integrated parts. Instead of a single monolithic engine, the Nintendo approach seems to be a large number of communally maintained bits of middleware that are forked by teams, assembled per-game, and then shared back out.\n\nIn the case of Zelda, at some point it appears that Takuhiro Dohta became the lead software architect for Nintendo generally, so it shouldn't be surprising that Tears technology made it's way to Switch Sports or Splatoon 3. And I imagine that is the direction it would flow, as Tears development began well before Switch Sports.\n\nLukasManak22\n\nwho the fuck is that\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\n#4,433\n\nIn the case of Zelda, at some point it appears that Takuhiro Dohta became the lead software architect for Nintendo generally, so it shouldn't be surprising that Tears technology made it's way to Switch Sports or Splatoon 3.
