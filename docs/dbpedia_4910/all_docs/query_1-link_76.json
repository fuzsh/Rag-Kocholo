        "text": "Tomorrow at Korakuen Hall we'll see a new Japanese female Bantamweight champion being crowned as Kanako Taniyama (3-1-1, 1) [谷山佳菜子] battles Yuko Henzan (8-10-4, 2) [平安山裕子] vacant title. The match, which not a big one, is an interesting one, and a must win for both women, if either expects to ever ge a world title fight down the line.\n\nToday the two fighters took part in their weigh in and both fighters easily made the 118lb Bantamweight limit.\n\nOn the scales Taniyama was the heavier fighter, weighing in bang on the divisional limit. She looked the naturally bigger, stronger and thicker set fighter and is clearly the one many are tipping as the favourite. The former kick boxer turned boxer, was touted very highly when she turned professional, and despite two set backs, both against Tomoko Okuda who has since won a world title, is still expected to achieve title success in the pro ranks.\n\nInterestingly Taniyama explained to Boxmob that she has rebuilt her style coming into this bout, and was still fighting too much in the kick boxing mindset in her other pro bouts. It'll be interesting to see what adjustments she has made for this bout.\n\nHenzan, a true veteran of the ring, was well under the limit weighing in at just 117lbs for the bout. Although the under-dog it is worth noting that Henzan has previously won an OPBF title during her career and a win here would see her winning her second professional title. She stated that she was originally worried about her physical condition, though was fortunate that the bout was delayted by two weeks due to the on going pandemic. Interestingly this will be her first bout at Korakuen Hall in the better part part of a decade.\n\nFor fans wanting to watch this one it will be made available on demand on the Boxing Raise service.\n\nRelated - Taniyama and Henzan battle for Japanese female title!\n\n​(Image credit - Watanabe Gym)"
