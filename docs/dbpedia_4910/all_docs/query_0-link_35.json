It’s only one route, but seeing how much of a slog it took me to get through the previous episode I was expecting this to take me longer than a day to get through. But then I checked Steam and oops, they’re only charging half price for this one after all so I probably should’ve known better. Aaaaaaaaaaanyway, as usual spoilers ahoy, especially given the nature of how this epilogue plays out.\n\nContinue reading “Guest Review: Taisho Alice: Epilogue” →\n\nGuest Review: Taisho Alice: Tokyo Drift\n\nAs I mentioned before, I grabbed all the rest of the Taisho Alice games when they got released before the Steam Summer sale. Buuuuuuuuuuuuut then we got sidetracked by Real Games For Real Gamers (TM) for the last few months (and trying to finish up our final prep before the upcoming FFXIV expansion) so this game has been sitting in limbo since then.

The rest of the Taisho Alice games all got released in pretty rapid fashion so I picked them all up at the discounted rate. Again, as before they’re releasing these games in four parts, so this one just covers Gretel and Kaguya (plus the short prologue with Katakana Alice, of course) and therefore still doesn’t cover any of the overarching metanarrative just yet.\n\nContinue reading “Guest Review: 2 Taisho 2 Alice” →"
