Mr. President, Honorable Illembers of the Court :

1 am indeed greatly honoured that the Secretary-General has assigned

me to rewesent him before the Court. He has asked me to be aresent

during these oral hearings iii the hope that 1 may he of assistance to

the Court in respect to matters within the special knowledge and coin-

et en cof the Secretariat. Tlie Secretarv-General desired. in ~articular.

1 il~oulrllikc ro riicnrio:Lfciv ooirirs ivirh rr,i>vzr to i<.liicli" iiii~lit

be able to supply information of Possible interest' to the Court.

The first point would relate to the procedure and practices of the

United Nations in reg-d tothe payment of awardsmade bythe Adminis-

trative Tribunal, and particularly the rôle of the General Assembly in

this respect.

A second point concerns the question of the reinstatement ofa termi-

nated staff member as it relates, under Article g of the Statute of the

Administrative Tribunal, to the payment or non-payment of awards

of compensation.

A third point concerns the practices of the United Xations with

respect to the budgetary powers of the General Assembly in relation to

the oblieations of the Or-anization. This oint relates to one of the

nisjur IS~IIL\vliicI~h:~s~rnerged frrjiii rlie 'cliçciisiunj aiicl st;it<~iiiriits

awards of ~orn~ensatiinkade by the Administratyve ~yiblinal and to

decide whether or not to give them effect by appropriating funds neces-

sary for their payment ;but in fact imposes an obligation on the Assem-

bly to do so in each case. On the other hand, it has been contended that

while the General Assembly may have the power to refuse an appropri-

ation, it does not have the riglit to do sowhere there is a legal obligatioii

of the Orgaiiization as there is in the case of an award by the Tribunal.

It,may therefore he of interest to consider the practice of the United

Nations in regard to tlie payment of contractual obligations and otlier

commitments made.

A fourth point concerns tlie practice of the United Xations, and par-

ticularly of the General Assembly, in establishing subsidiary organs and

the various characteristics of such organs. This practice might be of

interest in view of the discussions of the Administrative Tribunal as

a subsidiary organ, whicli have taken place in the General Assembly2SS STATEMEKT BY 31I. STAVROPOULOS (u.x.)-IO VI 54

and in the Written Statements t<ithe Court. In the light of this discus-

sion. it would seem vertinent to examine in varticular the vractice with

respect to the relatiÔnship of a subsidiary orgin to the GeneGalAssembly.

Finally, should Question I be answered in the affirmative, and should

the Court examine the subject of the principal grounds on which the

General Assembly might refuse to give effect toan award, a few obser-

vations might be of interest conccrning possible procedures which might

be observed in determining. in a particular case, whether such grounds

exist.

Mr. President, 1 have now outlined aii the points upon which 1 am

prepared to give information to the Court and 1 should be grateful to

you if you could indicate to me which are the points upon which the

Court would desire to hear me.

The PRESIDEST : Mr. Stavropoulos, after haring listened to the

outline of your speech, 1 feel Sun: that the Court would be glad to have

your assistance on all those points.

Mr. STAVROPOOL :OShank you, hlr. President.

-4s 1 noted in my preliminary remarks, one of the major issues which

has emerged from the discussioris and statements in the present case

relates ti) the right of the General Assembly under Article 17 of the

Charter to consider and approve the Budget of the Organization. 1

believe it miglit be of assistance to the Court in its examination of this

issue if1 mere to describe certain United Nations practices and proce-

dures involved.

In the first instance,1 should like to describe the practice foliowed

by the United Xations in the payment of awards in the past. %ce the

Administrative Tribunal was established at the end of 1949. there have

been 57 cases decided by it. In 32 of these there have been awards in

favour of tlie - -licants either of compensation for termination or of

costs.

In 1950, 16cases involving the same number of claimants were decided

in joint proceedings. The Administrative Tribunal found in favour of the

applicants and ordered their reinstatement, and this order was accepted

by the Secretary-General. The Tribunal also awarded costs to the appli-

cants amoiinting to approximately $2,000. This award was paid by the

Secretary-General from an item in the 1950Budget previously approved

by the GeneralAssembly, coverin: miscellaneousclaims and adjustments.

In 1951,there were two cases decided in favour of applicants invclving

awards of compensation amounting to $13,7jo and, in 1952, there were

two cases decided in favour of applicants involving a\vards of compensa-

tion and costs amounting to $7,:$90.These were paid by tlie Secretary-

General from the Section of the 1951and the 1952Budgets respectively,

covering Common Staff Costs. This Section in each Budget included

an account for termination indemnity to mhich tliese pnvm.nt. were

charged.

In each of these instances the money had already been appropnated

by the General Assembly in the regiilar budget prior to the consideration

of the cases by the Administrative Tribunal, and the Assembly did not

have any occasion to consider the awards.

In 1gj3, however, there were awards of compensation and costs in

eleren cases and an award of costs in one other totalling more than

$17o,ooo. The.Secretary-General submitted supplementary estinlates to the Eighth Session of the General Assembly, referring to the fact that

no money was available in the 1953Budget for the pakment of the large

àmount in\rolved.

Thus, 1 have described in brief the practice which has been follo\ved

also be ofnterest i1describe the procedures fordealingrnith thepayment

of an alvard wliich are available under the existing Financial Regula-

tions of the United Nations andother resolutions oftheGeneral Assembly.

There are. in fact. foureDarate vrocedures which mi~ht be followed.

As a tirkt thésecrétary-~eneral could, yffnnds are availa-

ble, make the paynient from monies within the appropriate section

of tlie Budget without affecting the total appropriated Budget. Under

the Financial Regulations the annual Budget estimates are divided into

parts, sections, chapters and articles.Normally, the Secretary-General

can transfer funds from one article or cha~ter to another. so lone as

and Budgetary Questions.

As noted a moment ago, the Secreta~-y-Generaldid, in 1050, 1951and

~gjz,make the payment of awards from within the appropriate section

of the Budget.

As a second procedure, if sufficient funds are not available in the

appropriate section of the Budget,the Secretary-General might make

the payment by increasing the amount in an). one section and decreasing

correspondingly the amount in another section or sections with the prior

concurrence of tlie Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budget-

ary Questions. and without affecting thetotal appropriated Budget.

The Financial Regulations provide that no transfer between appropri-

ation sections may be made without authorization by the General

r\ssembly. However, the General Assembly resolution approving the

Budget each year has autborized the transfer of funds between sections

with the prior coiicurrence of the ad vis or)^Committee (for example,

while available if there are sufficient surplus funds in other sections

of the Budget, and while used on occasion for other purposes, has iiot

been employed to date for the payment of awardsmade by the Adminis-

trative Tribunal.

As a third procedure, the Secretary-General might, with the concur-

rence of the Advisory Committee, make the payment by a withdrawal

from the \Vorking Capital I'uiid provided that the awards could be

considered as unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. He would then

submit a rcvised total Budget in his supplementary estimates. Each

year the General Assembly has ap roved resolutions relating to unfore-

seen and extraordinary expenses ?for example, Resolution 787 of the

Eighth Session) and to the \Vorking Capital Fund (for example, Resolu-

tion 788 of the Eighth Session) which could authorize the Secretary-

General toenter into commitments to meet uiiforeseen and extraordinary

expenses and to advance money from the Workiiig Capital Fund for

payment. In such a case the Secretary-General must submit supple-

mentary estimates to the General Assembly with a report of al1commit-

ments and the circumstances relating thereto. The appropriation by

the General Assembly in such a case, however, is for the purpose of

replenishing the \Vorking Capital Fund and not for the purpose of

payment which would already have been made. \\'hile tbeoreticallyavailable, if the expenses are unforeseen and extraordinary, this third

method also has not been employed by the Secretary-General for the

payment of awards made by the Administrative Tribunal.

As a fourth procedure, the Secretary-Generalmight request the General

Assembly for funds for the direct payment of the awards by submitting

supplementary estimates for tliis purpose. Such estimates are first

submitted to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary

Questions.

Only in the case of this last method, which in fact has been employed

only with respect to the awards made in 1gj3, would the General

Assembly have an opportunity to consider wliether or not to appropriate

the funds necessary to give cffect to awards of compensations made

by the Administrative Tribunal. Tlius, under esisting procedures and

past practices, the opportunity of the General Assembly to consider

an appropriation for the payment of specific awards is dependent on

the fortuituus circumstance of whetlier or not funds are available in the

current budget. On the other haiid. the Assembly might, particularly

\vitIl respect to the third procedure whicli 1 have described, discuss the

matter after the payment had boen made.

Iii concluding my remarks concerning Budgetary Procedures relating

to the payment of amards, 1 should like to observe that the Statute of

the Administrative Tribunal of the League of Xations provided tliat

any compensation awarded by the Tribuiial should be chargeable to the

budget of the Administration concerned. In implementation of this

provision of the Statute, it was recommeiided in the report of the

Supervisory Commission when it proposed the Statute, that a nomiiial

ainount of one thousand francs sliould be inserted in the budgets of

the League Secretariat aiid of the Iriternational Labour Officeso as to

provide an item to whicli such comnensation could be charaed if it

escess of this nominal vote would be provided by a transfer under the

usual guarantees.

A secoiid question concerns reinstatement in relation to the payment

General Assembly concern only "ail award of compensation made by the

the Tribuiial in favour of a staff inember of the United Nations whose

coiitract of service has been tenninated witliout his assent". Never-

theless, it is impossible, in the light of Article g of the Statute, to con-

sider this question without bearing in mind the relation between rein-

statement and payment of compeiisation.

Articleg of the Statute which prescribes the right of the Tribunal

to award compensation, gives tlie Tribunal the rigtit in the first instance

to order the rescinding of the decision contested or the specific perfom-

ance of the obligation involved. Under the present wording of Article 9,

it is within the absolute discretion of the Secretary-General to decide,

in the interest of the United 'I:itions, that the applicant should be

compensated in lieu of such rescisiori or specific performance.

The drafting history of Article 9, as well as the original wording of

the Article approved by the Gencral Asseinbly in 1949, indicated that

it was at that time believed that tlie Secretarv-Gcneral would use his STATEIEST BY hlr. STAVROPOULOS (u.x.)-IO VI 54

291

cretion only if rescision or specific performance was in his opinion impos-

sible or inadvisable.

Experience over a number of years, ho~vever, showed that in many

cases it was necessary for the Secretary-General to ask that the Tribunal

aurard compensation in lieu of rescision of the terminatioii. The Secre-

tary-General, iii his report on Personnel Policy to the Eiglith Session

of the General Assembly, stated :

"Experience lias indicated that, particularly in cases invol.viiig

termination of appointment, where the Tribunal finds tliat the

application is well founded, the payrnent of compensation should

be the rule rather than the exception. It is normally not in keeping

with tlie iiiterest of good administration to reiiistate an employee

whom the Secretary-General has considered it necessary to ternii-

nate. At tlie same time. from the n ointof view 01tlie staff member.

experience arid consideratioiis indicate that the normal reaction,

in case a decision of the Secretary-General is iiot uplield by the

Admiiiistrative Tribunal, should be tlie payinent of compensat'1011.

lie shuiilil Ii:ive tlie oyt<ilt,nciiiig ~uclir~~sciuioitio tlic ;ippliciirit

in lieu of the compensation ordered?

Article g \vas amended by the General Assembly at its Eighth Session

in response to tliis suggestion of the Secretary-General. The present

text of Article 9 provides, inter alia,that if the Tribunal finds that the

application is well founded it shall order the rescinding of the decision

contested or tlie specific performance of the obligation invoked. It also

provides tliat at the same time the Tribunal shall fix the amouiit of

compensation to be paid to the applicant forthe injury sustained, sliould

the Secretary-General decide, in the interest of the Uiiited Nations,

tliat the applicaiit should bc compensated without fiirther actioii beiiig

taken.

Under this text, the same judgment of the Tribunal is to contain

both an order of reinstatemerit and the fixing of compensation. It is

then for the Secrekiry-General to decide whether, in tlie interest of the

United Nations, tlie applicant is to be compensated rather than rein-

stated. Under the former text, compensation was fised in a subsequent

judgment in lieu of reinstatement when the Secretary-Gerieral decided

that such reinstatement was impossible or inadvisable. Uiider both texts

the close relationship between reinstatement and compensation is

apparent.

Accordingly, the Secretary-General is concerned with tlie problem of

the consequences wliich refusal by the General Assembly to give effect

to an award of compeiisation might have on his right, under Article g.

to refuse reinstatement ordered by the Tribunal.

Before proceeding to a discussion of United Xations practices with

respect to biidgetary powers of the General Assembly on the one Iiand

and obligations of the Oreanization on the other. 1 should like to reriew

briefly the bases of these two concepts as they relate to the qiiestions

before the Court.292 STATE~IEST BY :,IrSTA\'ROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54

On the oiie hand, there are the budgetary powers of the General

consider and approve the Budget of the Organization. Under Article 18,

hudgetary questions are among the important questions requiring

a two-thirds majority vote in tlie General Assembly.

On the other hand, there are the legal obligations of the Organization.

The Secretary-General has already pointed out in his \\'ritten Statement

to the Court that the StaffRegulations and Staff Rules are incorporated

by refereiice in the letters of ap ointment of staff memhers. For example,

the permanent appointment orm contains the following provisions :

"You are hereby offered a permanent appointment in the Secre-

tariat of the United Nations, in accordance with the terms and

conditions as specified, as amended by or as otherwise provided

in the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, together with such amend-

andtsuch Staff Rules. A copy of the Staff Regulations and Staffns

Rules is transmitted hereivith."

The same letter of appointment also provides that a permanent

appointment may be terminated by the Secretary-Genernl in accordance

with the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.

Similar provisions are also contaiiied in the other letters of appointment.

111 turn, the Staff Regulations provide inter aliathat the United

Nations Administrative Tribiinal shall, under conditions provided in

its Statute, hear and pass judgment on applications from staff members

alleging non-observance of the terms of their appointment including

al1 pertinent regulations and niles. Thus, as long as the present Staff

Regulations remain in force, the provision of the Administrative Tribunal

is a part of the legal relationship between the staff member and the

Organization.

Furthemore, as 1 have just iioted, the Administrative Tribunal is

authorized, in accordance with the provisions of Articleg of the Statute,

that the compensation shall be fixed hy the Tribunal and paid by theides

United Nations, or as appropriate, by the specialized agencies partici-

pating under Article 12. Article IO, paragraph z, provides that the

judgments shall be final and without appeal. These provisions are the

basis for the conclusion drawn by many Memher States that there is

a legal obligation involved witli respect to ail award made by the

Administrative Tribunal.

1should now like to examine the United Nations practice with respect

to the exercise of the hudgetary power under such circumstances.

It \r.ould seem elementary that there should be difference in the exercise

of the biidgetary power with respect, on the one hand, to future plans

and programmes where the discretion ofthe General Assembly isabsolute,

and, on the other hand, to obligations and commitments which have

been already duly made. In fact, with regard to such commitments

and obligations, the practice of the United Xations under its Financial

Regulations does not ordinanly involve consideration by the General

Assenibly.

Likewise, it may be noted that the General Assembly does not

ordinarily consider specific expcnditures even with regard to future

programmes, but deals rather with general categories. Geiieral Assembly STATEAIENT Bi' hlr. STAVROPOULO (u.s.)-IO VI 54 293

appropriations are normally made with respect to a class of espenses,

and it is for the Secretary-General, as Chief Administrative Officer, to

make the specific commitments and payments within this general

anthorization. Furthermore, as already noted, the Secretary-General,

with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Cornmittee on Administrative

and Budgetary Questions, or in certain cases even without such concur-

from the It'orking Capital Fund.reseen and extraordinary expenses

. The United Nations, under Article 105 of the Charter, enjoys in the

territory of each of its Members such privileges and immunities as are

necessary for the fulfilrnent of its purposes. The detailed privileges and

immunities provided by this Article of the Charter have been defined

in the Convention on Privileges and Irnrnunities of the United Nations.

The Convention, inter alia, provides for immunity from any form of

legal process.

If the Organization were not immune, persons with respect to whom

it had obligations could go into the national courts and seck redress.

Such a course of procedure, ho~ve\~er,might be a serious handical) to

the Organization in the fulfilment of its purposes. It has therefore been

considered necessary and desirable that this immunity be maintained.

At the same time, however, the Organization has not desired that its

irnmunity should be a cause of denial of justice or a shield to avoid

payment of legal obligations. It therefore desired to provide adequate

procedures for the settlement of disputes in lieu of submission to national

courts.

This principle has heen emhodied in the Convention on Privileges

and Irnmunities adopted by the General Assembly. Section zg of .this

Convention requires the United Nations to make provisions for appro-

ria te modes of settlement with resvect to two tv~e,.of disriutes. The

position-enj;?ys immunity, if immunity has not'been waived by the

Secretary-General.

With respect to the second class of disputes, no necessity has arisen

to make provision for settlement, although the Secretary-General has

on occasion waived the immunity of an official.

1 should like now to describe certain procedures which have been

established in business relations with firms and individuals outside

the Organization with whom the United Nations has contracts.

When the United Nations enters into a contract with a private firm,

for example, for the purchase of materials, a clause is inserted setting '

process. Because of the existence of this immunity, an arbitration claiise

is also generally inserted in such contracts. Th'isclause provides that

any claim or controversy arising out of a contract shall he settled by

arbitration. It also provides that both parties agree to be bound by any

arbitral award which is made.

However, it is further stated in this clause that nothing therein shall

constitute a waiver of the Organization's immunity. This means, in

effect, that any arbitral award given against the United Nations cannot

be enforced by the other side. Thus, the other party enters into the

contract knowing that in the final analysis he is ohliged to rely upon 294 STATEMEST Bi' NT. STAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54

the good faith of the United Nations iii paying any award made against

it. This postulation of good faith in the meeting of commitments and

légalobligations is, 1 believe, a siizcqua iioitfor the successful conduct

of the business of the Organization.

Inthe case of staff members, theorganization has provided the Admin-

istrative Tribunal for the settlenient of claims arising out of contracts.

The Supervisory Commission, \vhicti prepared the draft Statute of

the Administrative Tribunal of the League of Xations, pointed out in

its report that the international status of the League prevented officials

from bringing action in the ordinary courts to enforce the provisions

of their contracts. It then observed that it could not be considered

right that a class ofemployees, amouiiting ta several hundreds of persons

and engaged on terms which were necessarily complicated and which

might give nse to dispiites as to their legal effect, should have no means

of referring questions as to their riglits to a decision of a judicial body.

This passage of the report is quoted in the Written Statementsubmitted

by the Government of France together with observations of MI. Siraud.

In a similar vein, the Advisory Committee on a Statute for a United

Nations Administrative Tribunal, in presenting a draft Statute, said :

"The United Xations is not suable in any national court without

its consent ; nor can it be stied by an officia1in the International

Court of Justice. Tiy cre:iting a tribunal to serve as a jurisdiction

- open toits many officialsof various nationalities, the United Nations

will be acting not oiily in the iiiterest of efficient administration,

but also in the cause of justice."

In addition to the discussion with respect to the budgetary powers

of the General Assernbly, there have been issues raised concerning the

supervisory powers of the General Assetnbly in relation to the Adminis-

trative Tribunal. It has been argued tliat the Tribunal is a subsidiary

organ of the General Assembly and that, therefore, its decisions are

subject to review by the Assembly. On the basis of this argument it

would be impossible for a subsidiary organ to take a decision binding

upon the principal organ which createcl it.

On the other hand, it has been iirgued that, while the General Assem-

bly established the Adininistratioe Tribunal ancl can amend its Statute

or abolish the Tribunal altogether, it cloesnot follow that the Assenibly

can refuse to gire effect to tlie Tribunal's decisions.

It may he of interest to the Court if 1 were to review the position of

subsidiary organs in general in thcir relationship to the General Assem-

bly, and describe certain aspects and practices which may be relevant

to the consideration of this issue.

The principal organs of tlie United Nations are established and specifi-

cally enurnerated in paragraph I of Article7 of the Charter. They are :

the General Assembly. the Security Council, the Economic and Social

Council, the Trusteeship Council, tlie International Court of Justice, and

the Secretariat. Paragraph 2 of Article 7 provides that such subsidiary

organs as may be fouiid necessary may be established in accordance

witli the Charter. With respect to the General Assembly, the Charter

specifically States in Article22 th:it "The General Assembly may estab-

lish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance

of its functions." A similnr provision concerning the Security CounciL

is contained in Article zg.' STATE.\IEST BY AIT. STAVROPOULOS (u.s.)-IO VI 54 2gj

There are, in addition, a few organs which may not be characterized

as either principal or subsidiary under Article 7 of the Charter. Certain

organs which function within the orbit of the United Nations and are

supported from the United Natioiis Budget, i.e. the Permanent Central

Opium Board and the Drug Supervisory Body, were establislied by

treaty and not by a principal organ in accordance with the Charter.

Furthermore, the Military Staff Committee was provided directly in

Article 47 of the Charter, but is not a principal organ under Article 7.

The General Assemblv. oursuant to its Dowers under Articlc 22 of

the Charter, has establiSl,ed nearly 100 subsidiarz o;gans since it first

met in London in the early part of rq46. There 1sconsiderable clifficulty

for an indefinite peri8d, and still others haveAbeen established for a

single session, for a specifically limited time, or for the accomplishment

ofa particular purpose of limited duration.

From the point of view of membership, there are those siibsidiary

organs whose members are States and there are others composed of

individual experts, or even represented by a single individual as in

the case of the Mediator in Palestine. Members may, on the one hand,

be appointed directly by the General Assembly either through n simple

decision or through a system of nomination and election. On the other

hand, the General Assembly may provide that their appointment should

be by the President of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General

or the President of the International Court of Justice.

It is particularly dificult to classify the subsidiary organs from the

point of view of function. In order to obtain an o\.er-al1 picture, 1 have

listed the foliowine urincioal cateeories : Studv Committees. Political

Commissions, ~dmynistrati've r\ssisfance OrganS, ~~erationa<~gencies,

and ludicial Bodies. Theré are of course cases where a subsidiaryorgan

time that tce Assembly is in session each year of course perfok a

niajor part of this work. But the Assembly often desires to have pûrticu-

lar studies conducted between sessions and has established numerous

committees to consider and report on specific subjects. For example,

there were the Committees on International Criminal Jurisdiction, the

Suecial Committee on Admission of Xew Xembers. and the Collecti\~e

3ieasures Cornmittee. Subsidiary organs of this type are very numerous

and many more could be enumerated, but 1 belicve these will serve as

adequateillustration.

1shouldlike to note one other organ, however. The Interim Committee

of the General Assembly, first established in 1047 and placed on a296 STATEMEST BY 3IT.STAYROPOULOS (u.x.)-IO VI 54 ,

of international CO-ooeration in the oolitical field, and the ~eaceful

adjustment of situations likely to impâir the general welfare oririendly

relations among nations. Because of the very hroad sphere of actirity

of this Commitfee. there was oarticular carein the ~&t of its soonso~s

to point out that the functiois of this "Little Assembly" were'largely

confined to cqnsidenng and reporting to the General Assembly. This

function. however. covered bath the consideration of eeneral Droblems

in fact ;iiitli~,ri~crlto c-oiiductiii-~itirntion.i ..d ;ivr>uintconiiiii.;sionsof

eiiquiry.

It was also given certain other rights and functions which made it

more than a study committee. Thus, Resolution IIZ of the Second

Session. which recommended the holding of~~"e~ti~ns~in Korea for the

establishinent of an independent government, authorized the ~em~orary

Commission on Korea to consult with the Interim Committee with

resl~ectto the application of the Resolution. In 1948. by anthorization

of the General Assemhl (Resoliition 196 (III) of 3 Decemher 1948),

the Interim Committee &came the only subsidiary organ which might

request advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice; and

in 1950 it was authorized to utilize the Peace Observation Commission

(Resolution 377 (V) of 3 Xovember 1950).

The primary function of each committee falling within this category

of subsidiary organs, including even the Interim Committee, is to study

and report to the General Assembly.

A second group of subsidiary organs are those having active political

functions. Political Commissions may likewise have the function of

studying and reporting to the General Assembly, particularly with

respect ta observations or investigations in the field. This was the

primary function in the case of the United Xations Special Committee

on Palestine. But this function of reporting may well be only incidental

to the performance of other functions, and may not be the primary

purpose of the organ. Assistance in estahlishing governments, as in

Lihya, in bnnging about a federation, as in Eritrea, and in supervising

elections, as in Korea in 1948,may be the principal function ofthe sub-

sidiary organ. Mediation and conciliation may in other cases be the

primary function, as in Palestine. Observation as a means of maintaining

peace may also be important, as in the Balkans, where there was first

the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans, and later the

Balkan sub-commission of the I'eace Observation Commission. These

subsidiary organs whidi operate in the field must often, within their

terms of reference, take final actions and decisions.

A third category of subsidiary organs includes those which 1 have

called Administrative Assistance Organs. These organs have been

established bv the General Assemblv to assist it in carrvine out its

functions rt:latirii: to finlinrial. l>iidg&t;iry:a<liiiinistra6\~eum:ittt:rs.

A fewrepresentatives have suggested that the Administrative Tribunal

should also be classified as an administrative assistance organ of the

General Assembly. For reasons which 1will point out in a fewmoments,

1 have chosen, however, ta classiiy it as a judicial rather than as an

administrative organ.\Vorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the

United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency (UNKRA), and the

Hieh Commissioner for Refueees. 1 mav also note the Ex~anded Pro-

gramme of Technical Assistance and the responsibilities wifh respect to

this Programme of the Technical Assistance Board which is a subsidiary

orean of the ~conomi~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ù Council

ln examinntion of tlie terms of referencc of the operational subsidiary

orrans of the United Nations reveals that these orgaiis have been vested

wgh varying degrees of financial power regardingUtheprogrammes they

administer. TIie financial procedures followed with regard to these pro-

grammes differ from those applicable to the regular Budget of the

Organization. These differences are maiiifested mainly in the manner

in which the activities of these organs are financed, in the financial

regulations under which they operate, in the vestiiig ofgreater authority

to determine the disposition of tlie funds in the agency concerned, and

in the less rigid controls exercised by the General Assembly over the

disposition of the funds.

The first aspect which 1 will mention concerns the financing of these

programmes. A feature common to al1is the fact that they are financed

from voluntary contributions of governments rather than by assess-

ments uiider the reylar budget of the Organization. For this reason,

these programmes are sometimes called extra-budgetary programmes.

An exception is the administrative expenses of tlie Office of the High

Commissioner for Refugees, which are paid from the regular United

Nations Budget.

A second aspect relates to the application of financial regulations.

Arrangements made by the General Assembly with respect to the finan-

cial regulations which govern the operation of the programmes have

not been unilorm. The Statute of the Officeof the High Commissioner

for Refugees provides that the administration of the Office shall be

subject to the regular Financial Replations and liules of the United

Nations. On the other hand, the Agent of the United Nations Korean

Reconstruction Agency and the Ilirector-General of the United Xations

Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees are authorized to

establish finaiicial regulations for tlieir respective agencies. Each was

reouired to do so in consultation with the Secretarv-General and the

Advisory Committee on Administrative and ~od~et;;~ Questions ;and

in addition, the Agent-General of ihe United Nations Korean Reconstruc-

tion Ageiicy had ?O secure tlie agreement of the Advisory Committee of

his agency. \Vith regard to the United Nations Children's Fund and

the Expanded Programnie ofTechnical Assistance, certain specifiedfinan-

cial arrangements were laid down or approve<-lby GeneralAssembly

resolutions, but no express provisions were included as to the financial

regulations which should apply to these programmes. In point of fact,

the regular Financial Replations of the United Nations are applied.

A thircl aspect of particular interest concerns the authority delegated

bv the General Assemblv for the disuosition of funds. Here again. there

ate considerable variations in the &rangements which havëbeen laid

down by the General Assembly.

rigid since the Agency is authorized to transfer funds or make other

necessary adjustments. Resolutions of the l'ourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh

and Eighth Sessions of the General Assembly have provided for such

adjustment. Perhaps the most direct authorization was that made at

the Sisth Session by the General Assembly. Paragraph g of Resolution

\Vith regard to the Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance,

the General Assembly has determined how much should be made available

to the agencies by outright allocation, as well as the percentage to be

received bv each of the aeencies. how much should be retained for further

allocation'and liow muzh sho"ld he retained as a reserve. However,

considerable :lutlioritv has been granted to the Technical Assistance

Board in regard to théallocation of funds.

Very broad discretion with respect to disposition of funds has heen

granted by the General Assembly with respect to the United Xations

Children's Fund, the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency

andthe High Commissioner for Refugees. As regards the first, the power

to allocate the resources of the Fund is vested in the Executive Board

of the Fund. General Assembly Resolution 417 of the Fifth Session

provided that the Board, in accordance ivitli such principles as may be

laid down by the Economic and Social Council and the Social Commis-

sion, should formulate the policies, determine the programmes, and

allocate the resources of the Fund for the purpose of meeting, through

the provision of supplies, training and advice, emergency and long-range

needs of children and their continuine needs ~articularlv in under-

developed countries, with a vie; to strengthening wherevepthis may be

appropriate, the permanent child health and child welfare programmes

agencies whicli he deems best qualified to administer such assistance.

He does not have this broad discretion, however, with respect to adminis-

trative expenses which are paid from the regular United Xations budget

andare subject to the same scrutiny as the rest of the budget.

The broad discretion vested in these agencies for the' disposition of

funds represeiits at the same time a less rigid set of controls by the

General Assembly. The practice of the General Assembly with regard to tlie delegation of financial powers to these subsidiary organs would

appear to indicate that the General Assembly has not considered it

necessary to pass upon the disposition of every dollar which comes

into tlie custody of the Organizalion.

[Public sittifzg of ]une ~oth, 1954, afternoon]

A final categoiy of orgaiis established by the General Assembly is

that of judicial bodies. The Assemblv lias, in addition to the Adminis-

trative Tribunal, set up a United sations Tribunal in Libya and in

Eritrea.

In accordance with the provisii>nsof the Treaty of l'eace with Italy,

the question of the disposal of the formerItalian colonies was submitted

to tlie General Assembly on ~j September 1948 by ttie Governments

of l'rance, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kirigdom

of Great Britain and Northern lreland and tlie United States of America.

As part of the settlemeiit, the General Assembly, by Resolution 388

(V) of 15 December 1950 approvecl articles oii economic and financial

provisions relating to Libya. Tlia final article provided that a United

Nations Tribunal should be set up, composed of three persans selected

bv the Secretani-General for their leeal aualifications froin the nationals

of three differeit States not directlYinterested.

The Tribunal, whose decisioii was to be based on law, \vas given the

follo\ving two functions :

First, it should give to tlie Administering Powers, the Libyan

Government after its establishmeiit. and the Italian Government,

on n:quest by those aiitliorities, sucli instructions as inight be

requircd for the purpose of giving effect to the rcsolution of the

Gëneral Assembly.

Second, it shoulcl decide al1 disputes arisiiig between the afore-

nientioned authorities concerning the interpretatioii and applica-

tion of the resolntion. The Tribunal rvould be seised of aiiy such

dispute on the unilateral request of one of those antliorities.

The Tribunal \vas authorized to determine its own proccdure. In

tlie absence of unanimity, tlie Tribiinal could take decisions by a majority

vote. Its decisions were to be final and bindinr. Xo provisioii was made

-~~ ~ ~orts~ ~ ~h~ G~neral t2ssemblv. ,, for an; revikv of its <Iecisiorisbv

the General Assembly.

At the following sessiori of tlie Genernl Assembly, a United Natioiis

Tribunal was established by Resolution 530 (VI) of 1952, in coniiection

with the economic and finnncial provisions relating to Eritrea. The terins

of refereiice of this Tribunal were similar but not i<leritical witli the

terins of reference of the Tribunal for Libya. An ad<-litiorialprovision

.ofinterest was that the United Nations Tribunal in Eritrea should have

.esclusive cornuetence on iiiatters fallinrr \vithiil its functioris. In the

.event of any Latter Ùi dispute Iieiiig rcferred to the Tribunal, it was

provided that any action pending in civil courts should be siispended.

As in the case of the United X;itioris Tribunal in Libya, iio provision

was made for reports to tlic General Assembly, or for any review by

the Assenibly. There has been consi<lerable disciission by the General Assembly of

the ~ossibilitv and desirabilitv of establishine an international criminal

cou;. As eariy as 1948 the .&sembly adopted a resolution in which it

considered "that in the course of development of the international

community, there will be an increasing need of an international judicial

organ for the trial of certain crimes under international law". Since

that time the subject has been examined by the International Law

Commission and by Committees on International Criminal Jurisdiction

established by the General Assembly which met in 1951 and 1953.

Two principal methods of establisliing sucli a court were considered.

One method was by resolution of the General Assembly, the other by a

multilateral conveiition. The 1953 Committee on International Criminal

Jurisdiction favoured the second mcthod. In the discussion, however,

there were several points raised whicli are relevant to our present

consideration.

The Report of the Coinmittee siirnin:~rizesthe views expressed in these

discussions as follows :

Some members believcd tliat the legal powers of the General Assembly

under the Charter were not sufficient to enable it to establish a court

by r:soliirioii. Cii,lcr :\rticle22 of clic C'Ii:.rr, III<.c;t:li<-inl:\;scnibl!.

~ribunal and the United Xations Tribunals in ~ritria and Libya), were

considered by others as furnishing no adequate precedent since they were

based on provisions not applicable to the proposed crimuial court.

In favour of the power of the General Assembly to establish the court

by resolution, it was said that, under Article 22 of the Charter, the

Assembly could establish subsidiary organs to assist it in performing its

functions. Under Article II, the Assemblv mas eiven functions with

regard to the indntenaiice of internatiorcal pea& and security. The

existence of ail international crimirial jurisdiction, it was argued, rvould

be a factor in the maintenance of peice, since it would stringthen the.

moral opinion of the ivorld agairist international crimes. Therelore,

nothing in the Charter prevcnted the General .assembly from creating an

international criminal court as a siibsidiary organ. Such a subsidiary

organ, it was said, miglit wcll be entitled to do things which the General

Assembly itself could iiever perform, provided that its activity was in

the iiiterest of tlie mainteilancc of peace.

Some mcmbers fclt tlmt tlicre would be a serious ioçç of independence

and stability if the court wcre set up by a resolution, which could always

he repealed or niodificd later by tlie Geiieral Assembly. The same argu-

ment would apply, it was believcd, if the court were a subsidiary organ,

the budget of which Iiad to be deblited each year. Those who favoured

the resolution method took the view that the stability, permanence and

independence of the court would be adequately safeguarded, since the

General Assembly would ?lot reverse a decision taken on so important

a subject.

The report does not malie any reference to the question of review

of decisions by the General Assembly.302 STATEYEST BY Mr. STAVROPOULO(S u.N.)-IO \'154

In reviewing the character of the .4dministrative Tribunal it is

apparent that the tenninology in its Statute is that generally followed

with respect to judicial bodies. -4rticle 2 of its Statute refers to the

competence of the Tribunal to pass judgment on application. The tenn

judgment, clearly a judicial terni, is also used in Articles IO and 12.

It is true that in the English test the word "competencc" is used rather

than "jiirisdiction", which latter is perhaps a morc common judicial

phrase. In this connection, Iiowf:ver, it can be noted that while the

tenn "jurisdiction" is used in Artide 36 of the Statute of tlie lnter-

national Court of Justice, the title of Chapter II which iiicludes Article

36 is "Competence of the Court".

-4rticle 6 of the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal indicates

certain rules of procedure of a judicial character. Furthermore, several

provisions of tlie Statute appear to be borrowed from the Statute of

the Permanent Court of International Justice, or even earlier judicial

tests, via the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the League of

Nations. One of the most important of these is paragraph z of Article

IO, which provides that "The judgrnent shall be final and without

appeal." An almost identical provision was contained in Article 60 of

the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and in

the same Article of the Statute of this Court. Paragraph 3 of Article 2

relating to the Tribunal's right to decide its own competence also

appears tibe bascd on siinilar provisionsin the Statute of the predecessor

of this Court, which willalso be found in Article 36of the present Statute.

As has been pointed out on several occasions, the General Assembly

chose to use tlie word "Tribunal" rather than "Staff Claims Board".

". the other hand, it decided to use the word "member" instead of

ludge" and "executive secretary" instead of "registrar".

1 should also like to examine certain other aspects of the relationship

of the Administrative Tribunal to the General Assemblv. It would

seem that the Tribunal has been established pursuant to the authority

of the General Assembly under Article 22 of the Charter and, therefore,

in thissense is properly designated as a subsidiary organ.

The Statute by which the Administrative Tribunal was established

was adopted by the General Assembly by Resolution 351 (IV) on

24 November 1949. The Statute, in accordance with its Article II, may.

be amended by decisions of the General Assembly. It is also generally

accepted tliat the Statute could be complctcly repealed and the Tribunal

abolished by decison of the General Assembly. It is not believed that

such action by the General Assembly would violate acquired rights of

staffmembers. This view has been supported by almost al1members of

the General Assembly who have commented on the subject and would

also seem to be supported by recent decisions of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal stated in recent judgments that while the contractual

elements of the relations between the staff members of the United

Nations cannot be changed without the agreement of the two parties,

the statutory elements, on the other hand, can always be changed at

any time though regulations established by the General Assembly, and

these changes are binding on staff members. It further defined al1

matters as contractual which affect the personal status of each staff

member, for example, the nature of Iiis contract, salary and grade.

It defined al1 matters as statutory elements which affect in general the

organization of the international. civil service, and the need for its STATENEXT BY >Ir. STAVROPOULO(S u.s.)-IO VI 54 303

proper functioning, for example, general mles that have no persona1

reference. It would certainly seem that the provision of an Adminis-

trative Tribunal falls within the statutory elements.

Another factor in the relationship of the General Assembly to the

Administrative Tribunal is provided by Article 3 of the Statute under

which members are appointcd by the General Assembly. A proposa1

that the members stiould be appointed by the International Coiirt of

Justice instead of by the General Assembly was not acccpted. On the

other hand, a member cannot be dismissed by the General Assembly

unless the other members of the Tribunal are of the unanimous opinion

that he is unsuited for further service. A close decision of the Fifth

Committee to the effect that the dismissal of a member of the Adminis-

trative Tribunal could take place merely by a two-thirds majority vote

of the General Assembly was reversed in the plenary meeting of the

General Assembly.

It may further he noted that the Statute of the Tribunal does not

provide for any report to the General Assembly or for any review of

its decisions:

fGnctionshave been revie&ed in general tenns. It is Lot possiblEhithin

the scope of the present statement to attempt to analyze the minute

variations which exist in these respects from one organ to another.

Nor am 1 able to dcscribe the various other differences with respect

to such subjects as n~les of procedure, reporting requirements, place

of meeting, staff services, and other matters.

It is mnch more difficult to discover the few characteristics which

these organs have in common. Fundamentally, these appear to be that

the organs are established by the General Assembly and that their

membership, terms of reference and other particulars are defined by

the Assembly. Presumably the terms of reference could be changed or

the organ abolished by decision of the Assembly.

The requirement of a report is usual but not universal. Normally

such report is to be made to the General Assembly. However, in some

cases, as for example the Conciliation Commission for I'alestine, the

General Assembly has requested that reports he rendcred to the Secre-

tary-General for transmission to Member States. In other cases reports

are to he submitted not only to the General Assembly, but to other

organs such as the Security Council as in the case of the Collective

MeasuresCommittee and the Disrmament Commission,orthe Economic

and Social Coùncil as in the case of the High Commissionerfor Refugees.

It is my hope that this description of United Nations practices with

respect to snbsidiary organs established by the General Assembly may

Questions now before it.n its consideration of the issues raised by the

',The last Point refers to possible procedures for the application of

principal grounds" to individual cases.

Question z is only to be answered by the Court if the reply to Ques-

tion I 1sin the affirmative. 1wish to make it clear that by commenting

on the second question 1donot mean to imply any position with regard

to the answer to Question I. The comments which 1 shall make, in so304 STATEMEST BY arr. STAVROPOULO~ (u.N.)-IO VI 54

far as they relate to Question 2, wiUonly become relevant should Ques-

tion I be answered in the affirmative by the Court.

It may be noted that in the discussions in the General Assembly or

in Written Statements to the Court some governments have expressed

the view that issues in particular cases before tlie Tribunal could not

properly bc decided by a vote in the General Assembly. It was argued,

for example, by the representative of India in the Fifth Committee that

the General Assembly was not a proper forum to deal with questions

of Iaw or especially to examine individual cases from tliat viewpoint.

(India, Document 5, Fifth Committee, 425th meeting, paragraph 49.)

The representative of the Netberlands also expressed the view that the'

General Assembly could not perform judicial functions. (Netherlands,

Document z, FifthCommittee, 4ï1st meeting, paragraph 16 ; see also

Written Statemcnts, Distr. 54/17, page 85.)

The possible grounds on which the General Assembly miglit Iiave the

right to refuse to give effect to an award wliich were suggcsted during

discussions in the Fifth Committee have been collected in the Secretary-

General's Written Statement. Other proposed grounds have been set

forth in the Written Statements of Members of the United Nations

snbinitted to the Court.

Since 1 am not presuming in any way what the answer of the Court

to Question I may be, it would be most inappropriate for me to presume

any "principal grounds" which the Court might define in answer to

Question 2. However, \\+th this reservation, 1 should like to note that

among the possible grounds most frequently referred to by >lember

States are those which, in their application to particular cases, raise

certain problems of procedure. 1 may take, for example, the grounds

for revision or annulment of arbitral amards set forth by the Inter-

national Law Commissionin itsdraft Convention on Arbitral Procedure.

These embody a convenient summary of international jurisprudence on

the subjcct made by an organ of the United Xations, and have been

referred to bv several reuresentatives in discussions of the nresent case.

~ ~ ~~-

corruption on the part of a member of'the Tribunal :and third, that

there has been a serious departure [rom a fundainental rule of procedure,

including failure to state the reasons for the award. The draft also recog-

nized as a ground for revision of the award the discovery of some fact of

such ;inature as to have a decisive influenceon the award, provided that

~hen the award was rendered that fact was not known to the Tribunal

and to the party requesting revision and that such ignorance %-as not

diie to the negligence of the party requesting revision.

It is to be noted that while the International Law Commission indi-

cated these as grounds for annulment or revision, it also siiggested the

appropriate judicial procedures which it considered should be followed

in applying these grounds. In the case of possiblegrounds of annulment,

the International Law Commissiorirecommended that the question be

considered by the International Court of Justice, and if annulment was

decided, then the case should be re-submitted to a new tribunal. In

the case of possible grounds for revision, the arbitral tribunal itself, or,

should consider such revisionl, then the International Court of Justice, STATEhlENT BY Hr. STAVROPOU~OS (u.N.)-IO VI 54

305

In the report of the Commission covering the work of its fifth session,

the following observations wcrc made with particular reference to excess

of power as a ground for annulment :

"It is a fundamental-and inescapable-principle of jurisprudence

that an arbitral tribunal must have the power to determine its

competence on tlie basis of the instrument which is the source of

its jurisdiction. It is a no less fundamental principle that an award

rendered in excess of the powers conferred by that instrument is

nul1and void. The satisfactory operation of these two equally essen-

tial principles can be assurcd only by an impartial judicial authority

competent to decide whether there has taken place excess of juris-

diction."

The Governrneiit of thc Netherlands in its IVritten Statement to the

Court, after referring to tlie grounds enurnerated in the Draft Con-

vention of the International Law Commission, stated :

"But there would be littlc poiiit in recognizing these grounds if

not at the same timc rriacliinery would be provided in order to

decide whether or not in a certain case these grounds are invoked

rightly; leaving this to either party would deprive the award of

its binding and final character." (1,C.J. Distr54/17.page 85.)

1 might also note that the present Statute of the Administrative

Tribunal of the lnternational Labour Organization, as amended in 1946,

provides that tlie Governing Body of the International Labour Office

or the Administrative Board of the Pensions Fund may challenge a

decision of the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction, or may question

the validity of the decision ori the grounds that it is vitiated by funda-

mental fault in the procedure followed. However, the Statute also

provides that the Governing Body must submit the question of the

validity of the decision to the lnternational Court of Justice for an

Advisory Opinion, and the opinion given by the Court is binding.

The article provi~lingfor this challenge and reference to the Court \vas

adopted in October 1946, following the decision of the Assembly of

the League of Nations not to pay certain awards which had heen made

hy the Tribunal which had served both the League of Xations and the

International Labour Orgnnization.

The examples 1 gave suggest procedures which might be open to tlie

General Assembly with regard to the application of principal grouiids to

particular cases. III the first place, it might be possible that the Assembly

could order that the case be sent back to the Administrative Tribunal

for reconsideration. Thc procedure of revision is well-established in inter-

national practicc iii thc case of discovery of a new material fact. Such

proceduri for rcvision would not seem to be inconsistent with a provision

that a judgment is final and witliout appeal. Article 60 of tlie Statute

of the Iiitcrnatioiial Court of Justice provides that its judgments are

final and witbout alilieal. The following Article of the Statute permits

an application for revision when it is based upon the discovery of some

fact of such a naturc as to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the

judgment was given, unknown to the Court and also tothe party claiming

revision, always provided tliat such ignorance was not due to negligence.

\Vhat is the possibility of reconsideration of a case by the Adminis-

trative Tribunal ? The Secretary-Gerieral in his \Witten Staternent to306 STATE~IENT BY MT. <TAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54 l

the Court described the action in the case of Miss Jane Reed. In that

case, Counsel for the SecretaryGeneral applied for the revision of an

award based on the correction of an error of fact. The Tribunal, in

fixing the compensation, had based its computation on the age of

MissReed and the time remaining beforeshe would have been eligible for

retirement had shenot been terminated. It was subsequently discovered

that there was an error in the age and the fact was recognized by both

parties.

The Tribunal, in correcting the award, stated tliat it was entitled

to rectify figures computed on the basis of a date submitted by both

parties and recognized by both after the judgment as erroneous. As

noted in the \Vritten Statement, other questions relating to the power

of the Administrative Tribunal to reconsider a case or revise a judgment

are as yet undetermined by the Tribunal. The Statute of the Tribunal

is silent on the subject.

\\'liile the procedure of revision is normally limited to the discovery

of migtake or of new material facts. it would appcar possible that a

similar procedure could be considered for the re-esamination of a case on

other possible grounds, should the Court findthat there areany grounds

which would justify the Assembly in refusiog to give effect to an award.

On the other hand, as noted above in reference to the Statute of

the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization,

ancl t r the drxft Convention on Arbitral Procedure pxepared by the

International Law Commission, there is precedent for a procedure pro-

viding for a request for an advisory opinion from the International Court

of Justice in order to obtain a determination of the legal questions

involved. The General Assembly might, in fact, providefor botli methods

and, if ttie Assembly were still dissatisfied, reference to the Court.,

Perhaps othe~ procedures, such, for example, as reference to a special

committee of the Assembly, miglit also be considered for the examina-

tion of issues of this kind in particular cases.

I'resumably the procedures which 1have rnentioned could he provided

by the Geiieral Assembly by amendment of the Statute of the Tribunal

under Article II. It is not my intention to discuss whether or uot they

coulà be applied without amendirig the present Statute. Such discussion

would involve consideration of whether or not there are "any grounds"

under the present Statute of the Admiiiistrative Tribunal and other

relevant iiistruments on wliich the General Assembly could refuse to

give effect to an award of compensation made by the Tribunal. As 1

have already emphasized, 1 did not intend, in discussing these proce-

dural aspects, to imply any position with respect to the answer to Ques-

tion I.

In closing 1 should like to refer to another possible ground which

has been frequently mentioned by representatives in their discussion

of this matter. This possible ground is that of an unreasonably large

award of compeiisation. The question of reasonableness of compensation

\vas undoubtedly of concern to the General Assembly. At its Eighth

Session it dealt with the problem by an amendment to Article g of the

Statute of the Administrative Tribunal. This Article was amended for

the purpose intear lia of placing a ceiling on the amount of compensation

which might be awarded. STATEhlENT BY hlr.STAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54 307

Under the amended Article 9,compensation is not ta esceed the equiv-

alent of two years' net base salary of the applicant. The Article further

provides, however, that the Tribunal may, in exceptional cases, when

it considers it justified, order the payment of a higher indemnity. A

statement of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision is to accompany

each such order.

\Vith respect ta this possible ground, it will thus be seen tliat the

General Assembly has acted in its legislaiive capacity in order to mini-

mize the possibility of what it might consider an excessively large award. 2. ORAL STATERIENT BY MI. PHLEGER

MI. President and Honourable Members of the Court :

May it please tlie Court,

The events giving rise ta the request for an advisory opinion of this

Court mav be brieflv summarized as foilo~s ~ :

Ilvtiv-:cil~eceiiit)ér1952niid 11:~):iijjjtlicSecrcrnr!.-Geiier:il diiriiis-

on tlieir refusal ta answer questions put ta them by an investigating

comrnittee of the United States Senate. These questions related ta mem-

bership in the Cornmunist Party or subversive activities against the

United States. The refusals to auswer were based upon a plea of the

Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United .States upon the

ground that the answers might tend to incriininate the witnesses.

The discharged staff members filed applications with the United

Nations Administrative Tribunal, aileging non-performance or non-

observance of the terms of their contracts.

TheAdministrativeTribunal rendered judgments in their favour, and

awarded compensation to the eleven in the total amount of one hundred

and seventy ~thousand dollars ($17o,ooo)-an average of more than

$xj,ooo per employee. The highest single award was $40,000 ;the lowest,

$4,700.

The Secretary-General included this amount of S170,oooin his budget

report to the General Assembly on Supplementary Estimates for the

Financial Year 1953, and proposed a supplementary appropriation of

S17g.ooofor Section 17 of the United Nations Budget to pay the awards

including compensation, adjusted salary ta date of termination, and

legal costs.

Some Members of the Assenibly objected to the appropriation. Debate

tlien ensued botli in favour of aiid against payrnent. Some members.

took the position that the Assembly had no power to refuse ta give

effect ta the awards : that they were irrevocable and binding on the

Assembly, which had no choice but to pay them. Others took the position

that the Assembly not only had the power but the cluty to examine

auards of the Tribunal, and that these particular awards should not be

paid. Still otliers took intermediate positions.

In the course of the debate it was proposed that, before the Assembly

acted on the request for appropriation, the opinion of this Court should

be sought ;and on December g, 1gj3, the General Assembly adopted by

41 votes ta 6, with 13 abstentions, a Resolution submitting two ques-

tions to this Court for its advisory opinion. Tliese questions are :

"(1) Having regard to the Statute of the United Nations Adminis-

trative Tribunal and to any other relevant instruments and

ta the relevent records, has the General Assembly the right on any grounds to refuse to give effect to an award of com-

pensation made by that Tribunal in favour of a staff memher

of theUnited Nationswhose contract of service has been termi-

nated without liis assent ?

(2)If the answer given by the Court to question (1) is in the

affirmative, what are tlie principal grounds upon which the

General Assembly coiild lawfully exercise such a right ?"

In the view of the United States Government, the argument that the

Assembly has no right to review the awards, and must automatically

pay them, cannot be sustained. \\le think the Asseinbly has not only

the right, but the duty as well; to examine requests for appropriations,

and has the right to refuse appropriations to pay awards of the Admin-

istrative Tribunal in those cases where it belieres tliat the relevant

considerations so require. \\'e think the grounds to support such action

are found in the Charter provisions defining the budgetary and regula-

tory responsibilities of the t\ssembly, its relationship to subsidiaryorgans

such as the Administrative Tribunal, the function of tlie Secretary-

General as the chief administrative officer of the Orzanization, and in

the Charter pro\.isions regarding interpretation and jüdicial power.

Whether the General Assemblv should decide, in a riven case, to

refuse an appropriation must dePend on its judgment of many factors

which are proper for the Assembly's consideration. The weighing of

these factors adds up to n judgment of a legislative character, to be

made by the highest United Nations body in which al1 Members are

represented. The Charter basis and limitations of Assembly action

can and should be stated as a matter of law. The reasons and motivations

of Assembly decision to vote or refuse an appropriation in a particular

situation are othenvise to be left to the judgment of thc Assembly, as

the United Xations orgaii with immediate responsibility in the matter.

1 will state briefly the propositions for which we shall contend in

the course of argument.

First, the questions put to this Court by the General Assembly are

legal questions, concerniiig the Assembly's right and power to vote

funds, or to refuse to vote them. The questions do not relate to policy

considerations of what the Assembly should or should not do.

2. The Charter reqiiires n two-thirds vote of the General Assembly

before United Nations funds can be spent. Article 17 requires that ail

expenditure be co~zsideredby the Assembly. ,The Assembly cannot be

compeiled to make an automatic appropriation without consideration

and deliberate approval.

3.The General Assembly has not voted any appropriation to pay

the Tribunal's awards, either in advance or alter they were made.

4. There is no basis in the Charter for any delegation by the General

Assembly, to any other body, of the Assembly's duty to examine and

pass upon all requests for funds. In fact, the Assembly has not sought

-in the Staff Regulations or the Statute of the Administrative Tribu-

nal-to make any sucli delegation of responsibility.

5. The Administrative Tribunal is a subsidiary organ of the General

Assembly under the Charter. The Tribunal's judgments cannot bind the

Assembly nor can their status be superior to that of authoritative

expressions by this Court, whicli is the principal judickil organ of theUnited Nations, on matters referred to the Court by the Assembly.

Even in such cases the Court's opinions are advisory only.

6. The one precedent, bearin upon the relationship of the Assembly

to the Tribunal and staff mem%ersin the matter of awards, is to the

effect that the Assembly may refuse to give effect to Tribunal awards.

Such was the decision of the League of Nations in 1946.

7. The contract between a staff member and the United Nations

Secretariat may not infringe the Charter responsibility and powers

of such principal organs as the Secretary-General and the General

Assembly. The Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer,

on a staff member by the General Assembly. He has no vested or acquired

right to this resort, and the Assembly may abolish the Tribunal.

Similarly, he has no vested or acquired right to any award given by the

Tribunal during a period when the Assembly permits such resort.

g. In discharge of its Charter responsibilities for the United Nations

budget,and for the control of its suhsidiary organs, the GeneralAssemhly

may examine any award rendered hy the Administrative Tribunal, and

may refuse to give it effect on aiiy Charter grounds. Thus, it might do

so on grounds relating to the criteria set forth in Article 101, para-

grnph 3,for selection of staff, on financial grounds, on groundsrelating to

the proper functioning of the Tribunal, among others. The considerations

and reasons leading the Assembly to pay an award or to refuse payment,

on auy grounds, are not questions of law but of policy ; they are as

broad and varied as are the bases for action by any legislative body.

Let us now turn to a detailed consicleration of these propositions.

The questions which the General Assembly addressed to this Court

are strictly legal in character and intentionally limited in scope. They

and tlie Statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal. Articlens,

96 of the Charter excludes policy questions from reference for advisory

opinion.

These considerations were recognized by the United Kingdom when,

in introducine the draft resolution Drovidine for reference to this Court.

to the kraft-r/solution, proposed by France and desi&ed to submit

to this Court the merits of the awards and commit the Assembly to the

result, were rejected. Written Statements 178-79.

Tlius, the Gcneral Assembly did not intend to shift its responsibilities

to this Court. It souglit advice, ;iiid only legal advice, on its own legal

autliority with respect to Tribunal awards. It did not ask what it should

decide as to payment. Nor did it make any advance provision to pay

the awards. It considered and rejected proposais to such ends. It simply

asked if it had the right to refuse effect to awards on any grounds at

all, and, ifso, on what principal grounds. STATEMENT BY m. PHLEGER (U.S.A.)-IO VI 54 311

"Kight", in the context of a question addressed to this Court, must

mean legal right. This is emphasized in the United Kingdom Written

Statement, where it is said :"The questions before the Court are solely

questions of law." Written Statements 103. M'hen we.speak of the right

power, and its exercise in a fashion consistent with the authority and

responsibility of the Assembly under the Charter.

\Ve do not mean moral, or ethical, or political right. Such matters

are, in tlieir nature, not properly the subject of a request for an advisory

opinion. They are to be weighed and decided by the responsible political

body, here the General Assembly, which we must assume will give due

weight to al1 such considerations in the discharge of its responsibility

under the Charter.

Question two speaks of the "principal grounds" upon which the

Assembly could la~~fwllryefuse to give effect to an award of the Tribunal.

The presencc of the word "lawfully" is sigiiificant. It emphasizes again

that the questions suhmitted are legalincharacter and that the "grouiids"

for refusal involve questions of power, and not of ethics or mornls.

\IThat are the "principal grounds" ? Does the question ask this Court

to declare what in the applicable law, and basically in the Charter,

bears upon the Assembly's right to tliscuss and decide ? Does it ask,

what are the relevant provisions and what is their legal meaning ?

\f7e think the Court is asked these questioris.

But is this Court asked to declare how the Assembly shall weigh

its lawful concerns in the light of given or hypothetical fact? The last

question, we submit, must be put aside, since it would not be this

Court's rôle to anticipate Assembly policy or to substitute this Court's

judgment for the political judgment of another principal organ of the

United Nations in deciding amongst lawful alternatives.

Tlic United Kingdom is correct iii saying of the two questions asked

the Court: "these two questions are closely related to one aiiother".

Wrilten Stntements 102.The truth is, that the "principal grounds" are

the legal reasons why an affirmative ariswer must be given to question

one. A reasoned determination that the General Assembly has the legal

cipal legal groun<ls for any such refusal. They are the principal legaln-

bases of Assembly authority,and the principal legal provisions governing

its esercise.

Mr. President. what is the authority and the responsibility of the

General Assembly under the Charter?

The questions submitted raise issues concerning the nature and

constitutional structure of the United Nations. This is not a simple

case of a iuridical entitv-such as a nrivate nerson, a coruoration. or

cven a nat'ionalgoverndent-which hks a contract r&lationihip with an

individual. An individual's rirhts under a contract with a private person,

corporation, or national g&ernment are determined- according to

municipal law made by the sovereign. In this case, however, rights and

obligations must be determined in accordance with the disposition of a

treaty entered into by sixty sovereigns-the Charter of the United

Xations.

In the United Xations Organization, power is not centralized in one

organ, as it is in theegislature of Great Britain or France, for esample.

The commitments which may be undertaken by, and enforced against. STATEhlENT BY hlr. PHLEGER (U.S.A.)-IO VI 54

precisely for this reason that the matter com'esbefore the Fifth

Committee. For at the very outset there is posed the vital question

-wliether the award of a tribunal set up by its authority, or

whether any other outside authority can or shoulcl override the

power of appropriation and its free exercise, without which no

sovereign body
