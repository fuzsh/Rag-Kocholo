Lighting plan

The document discusses lighting techniques used in films. It explains that there are two main types of lighting: high key and low key. High key lighting has little dramatic effect and is used in upbeat scenes, while low key lighting comprises both bright and dark areas and is used in more tense scenes to create drama or negative emotions. The document provides the example of the film Raincoat (2004), which effectively uses both high key and low key lighting to manipulate the viewer's attitudes and portray different emotions. It also describes how the author of the document similarly used both lighting techniques in their own short film to positively portray outdoor scenes but create a sense of anger and sorrow in indoor scenes through low key lighting.

1 Within the EHR [footnoteRef:1] [1: ] [Student Name Removed] Abstract— This research paper was conducted to demonstrate the usefulness, positives, negatives and challenges associated with implementing the Electronic Health Record in a small private family practice group. Further use of research in this paper includes pieces on project implementation, government security accordance and system recommendations. INTRODUCTION Health information technology (HIT) has been revolutionized by the development of the electronic health record (EHR) and its expansion. The generalization of its use includes the transformation of paper patient charts and protected health information (PHI) into electronic forms and from there the options to revolutionize HIT began. The development of the EHR has brought a multitude of advantages and challenges with its implementation in the HIT world. Although the functions of EHR have allowed for both public and private sectors to utilize its possibilities, the private sector will be focused on in this situation. The ability for an electronic system to safely document, record, save, integrate and share with other instantly has allowed HIT to expand rapidly to all corners of the world. EHR functionalities In health information technologies, electronic health records have been identified by the Institute of Medicine as having eight core components which include the following [1]: recording patient health information and data, result management, physician order management, decision support, electronic communication and connectivity, patient support, administrative process and reporting, reporting requirements, and population health. Table 1 allows a visual representation of the core components along with other variable options available through the EHR [2]: As seen, the electronic health record is much more than digitized patient records. As the EHR has the ability to provide functions ranging from patient care through supportive administration functions and even the function of informational infrastructure guidance in order to better aid the staff of the practice in clinical and clerical office services. Integration of Practice Management System Practice management systems (PMS) have multiple levels of integration with electronic health record systems yet there are difficulties at each level. Levels of integration can range from full system communication sharing all data entered in to each system or select data pending on the organizations need for level of integration from one system to another [3]. To distinguish the two systems, practice management systems provide more clerical functions of a physician’s office such as patient billing profiles, insurance verification, appointment scheduling and sending appointment reminders [3]. Co-coordination between the two systems have become increasingly more difficult due to the evolution and development of multiple EHR products. As organizations develop new electronic h.

Monitoring the Execution of 14K Tests: Methods Tend to Have One Path that Is ...andrehoraa

The literature has provided evidence that developers are likely to test some behaviors of the program and avoid other ones. Despite this observation, we still lack empirical evidence from real-world systems. In this paper, we propose to automatically identify the tested paths of a method as a way to detect the method’s behaviors. Then, we provide an empirical study to assess the tested paths quantitatively. We monitor the execution of 14,177 tests from 25 real-world Python systems and assess 11,425 tested paths from 2,357 methods. Overall, our empirical study shows that one tested path is prevalent and receives most of the calls, while others are significantly less executed. We find that the most frequently executed tested path of a method has 4x more calls than the second one. Based on these findings, we discuss practical implications for practitioners and researchers and future research directions.
