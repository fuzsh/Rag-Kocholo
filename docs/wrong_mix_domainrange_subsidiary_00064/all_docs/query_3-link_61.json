        "text": "effect ship testcraft of less than 100 gross tons.\n\nPrevious studies have led to the conclu­sion that the sidewall craft or captured air bubble configuration, which uses underwater propulsion, is well suited to the JSESPO long­term objective. The craft are to be designed to meet or improve upon the following major design requirements or characteristics:\n\nGross weight: less than 100 short tons\n\nMaximum speed: 80 knots acceptable; 100 knots preferred\n\nSea state: operation in 6-foot waves\n\nPropulsion: 2 gas turbine engines and\n\nsupercavitating propeller or equivalent systems.\n\nThe three contractors are to submit their studies within five months. If the results are promising a contract for an experimental vessel probably will be let by JSESPO.\n\nH 16 Vessels Taken Off Vietnam Run\n\n{The New York Times, 16 August 1967) Six­teen of the 172 vessels mobilized from the nation’s reserve fleet for service in the Viet­nam sealift are being shunted from active status to semi-retirement.\n\nThe Maritime Administration confirmed yesterday that Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara has informed the agency that a sharp reduction in vessel turnaround time in ports in Southeast Asia permitted the step to be taken.\n\nMr. McNamara reported that “as much as 22 days” had been cut from the time required to unload ships in Vietnam operations. One of the major complaints of shipping companies chartering high-speed ships on the Vietnam run has been that the vessels have had to wait as long as three months for unloading.\n\nAll of the vessels being taken out of the run are World War II Victory-type ships.\n\nResearch and Development\n\ns Submarine to Study Ocean Shelf\n\n(John Noble Wilford in The New York Times, 3 August 1967) The little research submarine Alvin, finder of the lost hydrogen bomb off Spain last year, left her home port here today on one of the final expeditions in a five-year study of the continental shelf off the East United States.\n\nThe submarine, secured between the twin- hulls of a catamaran, headed 135 miles south­east of Woods Hole, Mass., to Oceanographer Canyon. She is scheduled to be dropped from the catamaran for at least five manned dives, of between 4,000 and 6,000 feet each, into the canyon at the edge of the shelf.\n\nScientists of the United States Geological Survey and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution want to get a first-hand look at the edge of the shelf in their effort to explain how and when the shelf was formed and what mineral treasures it may hold.\n\nThe submarine is equipped with a mechan­ical arm that can reach out and take temper­atures and scoop up rocks and mud to be brought back to the surface for analysis.\n\ns Undeveloped Ocean Areas Outlined\n\n(Helen Delich Bentley in Baltimore Sun, 18 August 1967) The five areas which have been set up for development under the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of 1966 were outlined today in the first annual report of the national council named under the act by President Johnson.\n\nThe report was presented to the subcom­mittee on oceanography of the House Mer­chant Marine and Fisheries Committee.\n\nThe first area embraces fishing and mar­keting potential overseas of fish protein con­centrate, so that the Food-from-the-Sea pro­gram will bring assistance to undernourished people.\n\nThis program is being developed with the Agency for International Development as the lead agency, assisted by the Bureau of Com- merical Fisheries, which is developing the necessary technology.\n\nThe second area of increased emphasis relates to the capability of the United States Navy to operate in the deep oceans.\n\nThe third area concerns the upgrading of the nation’s oceanographic data system, while the fourth is derived from the National Sea Grant College and Program Act of 1966 which is aimed at advanced education, training, applied research and information transfer—in phase with accomplishment of the over-all purpose of a viable marine sci­ences activity.\n\nThe council recommended utilization of a proposed replacement vessel for the ice pa­trol in sub-polar oceanographic research because “this particular research field has been somewhat neglected.”"
