As of 1130am EDT July 19, 2024: CISA is aware of the widespread outage affecting Microsoft Windows hosts due to an issue with a recent CrowdStrike update and is working closely with Crowdstrike and federal, state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) partners, as well as critical infrastructure and international partners to assess impacts and support remediation efforts. CrowdStrike has confirmed the outage: Impacts Windows 10 and later systems. Does not impact Mac and Linux hosts. Is due to the CrowdStrike Falcon content update and not to malicious cyber activity. According to CrowdStrike, the issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike customer organizations should reference CrowdStrike guidance and their customer portal to resolve the issue. Of note, CISA has observed threat actors taking advantage of this incident for phishing and other malicious activity.

These vulnerabilities allowed unauthenticated malicious actors to remotely execute code on network edge devices. OS command injection vulnerabilities have long been preventable by clearly separating user input from the contents of a command. Despite this finding, OS command injection vulnerabilities—many of which result from CWE-78—are still a prevalent class of vulnerability. CISA and FBI urge CEOs and other business leaders at technology manufacturers to request their technical leaders analyze past occurrences of this class of defect and develop a plan to eliminate them in the future.

The following organizations also collaborated with ASD's ACSC on the guidance: The National Security Agency (NSA); The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK); The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS); The New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ); The German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV); The Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) and NIS’ National Cyber Security Center (NCSC); and Japan’s National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) and National Policy Agency (NPA). The advisory is based on current ACSC-led incident response investigations and shared understanding of a PRC state-sponsored cyber group, APT40—also known as Kryptonite Panda, GINGHAM TYPHOON, Leviathan and Bronze Mohawk in industry reporting. APT 40 has previously targeted organizations in various countries, including Australia and the United States. Notably, APT 40 possesses the ability to quickly transform and adapt vulnerability proofs of concept (POCs) for targeting, reconnaissance, and exploitation operations. APT 40 identifies new exploits within widely used public software such as Log4J, Atlassian Confluence and Microsoft Exchange to target the infrastructure of the associated vulnerability. CISA urges all organizations and software manufacturers to review the advisory to help identify, prevent, and remediate APT 40 intrusions. Software vendors are also urged to incorporate Secure by Design principles into their practices to limit the impact of threat actor techniques and to strengthen the security posture of their products for their customers. For more information on PRC state-sponsored threat actor activity, see CISA’s People's Republic of China Cyber Threat.
