In the light of this discus-\n\nsion. it would seem vertinent to examine in varticular the vractice with\n\nrespect to the relatiÔnship of a subsidiary orgin to the GeneGalAssembly.\n\nFinally, should Question I be answered in the affirmative, and should\n\nthe Court examine the subject of the principal grounds on which the\n\nGeneral Assembly might refuse to give effect toan award, a few obser-\n\nvations might be of interest conccrning possible procedures which might\n\nbe observed in determining. in a particular case, whether such grounds\n\nexist.\n\nMr. President, 1 have now outlined aii the points upon which 1 am\n\nprepared to give information to the Court and 1 should be grateful to\n\nyou if you could indicate to me which are the points upon which the\n\nCourt would desire to hear me.\n\nThe PRESIDEST : Mr. Stavropoulos, after haring listened to the\n\noutline of your speech, 1 feel Sun: that the Court would be glad to have\n\nyour assistance on all those points.\n\nMr. STAVROPOOL :OShank you, hlr. President.\n\n-4s 1 noted in my preliminary remarks, one of the major issues which\n\nhas emerged from the discussioris and statements in the present case\n\nrelates ti) the right of the General Assembly under Article 17 of the\n\nCharter to consider and approve the Budget of the Organization. 1\n\nbelieve it miglit be of assistance to the Court in its examination of this\n\nissue if1 mere to describe certain United Nations practices and proce-\n\ndures involved.\n\nIn the first instance,1 should like to describe the practice foliowed\n\nby the United Xations in the payment of awards in the past. %ce the\n\nAdministrative Tribunal was established at the end of 1949. there have\n\nbeen 57 cases decided by it. In 32 of these there have been awards in\n\nfavour of tlie - -licants either of compensation for termination or of\n\ncosts.\n\nIn 1950, 16cases involving the same number of claimants were decided\n\nin joint proceedings. The Administrative Tribunal found in favour of the\n\napplicants and ordered their reinstatement, and this order was accepted\n\nby the Secretary-General. The Tribunal also awarded costs to the appli-\n\ncants amoiinting to approximately $2,000. This award was paid by the\n\nSecretary-General from an item in the 1950Budget previously approved\n\nby the GeneralAssembly, coverin: miscellaneousclaims and adjustments.\n\nIn 1951,there were two cases decided in favour of applicants invclving\n\nawards of compensation amounting to $13,7jo and, in 1952, there were\n\ntwo cases decided in favour of applicants involving a\\vards of compensa-\n\ntion and costs amounting to $7,:$90.These were paid by tlie Secretary-\n\nGeneral from the Section of the 1951and the 1952Budgets respectively,\n\ncovering Common Staff Costs. This Section in each Budget included\n\nan account for termination indemnity to mhich tliese pnvm.nt. were\n\ncharged.\n\nIn each of these instances the money had already been appropnated\n\nby the General Assembly in the regiilar budget prior to the consideration\n\nof the cases by the Administrative Tribunal, and the Assembly did not\n\nhave any occasion to consider the awards.\n\nIn 1gj3, however, there were awards of compensation and costs in\n\neleren cases and an award of costs in one other totalling more than\n\n$17o,ooo. The.Secretary-General submitted supplementary estinlates to the Eighth Session of the General Assembly, referring to the fact that\n\nno money was available in the 1953Budget for the pakment of the large\n\nàmount in\\rolved.\n\nThus, 1 have described in brief the practice which has been follo\\ved\n\nalso be ofnterest i1describe the procedures fordealingrnith thepayment\n\nof an alvard wliich are available under the existing Financial Regula-\n\ntions of the United Nations andother resolutions oftheGeneral Assembly.\n\nThere are. in fact. foureDarate vrocedures which mi~ht be followed.\n\nAs a tirkt thésecrétary-~eneral could, yffnnds are availa-\n\nble, make the paynient from monies within the appropriate section\n\nof tlie Budget without affecting the total appropriated Budget. Under\n\nthe Financial Regulations the annual Budget estimates are divided into\n\nparts, sections, chapters and articles.Normally, the Secretary-General\n\ncan transfer funds from one article or cha~ter to another. so lone as\n\nand Budgetary Questions.\n\nAs noted a moment ago, the Secreta~-y-Generaldid, in 1050, 1951and\n\n~gjz,make the payment of awards from within the appropriate section\n\nof the Budget.\n\nAs a second procedure, if sufficient funds are not available in the\n\nappropriate section of the Budget,the Secretary-General might make\n\nthe payment by increasing the amount in an). one section and decreasing\n\ncorrespondingly the amount in another section or sections with the prior\n\nconcurrence of tlie Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budget-\n\nary Questions. and without affecting thetotal appropriated Budget.\n\nThe Financial Regulations provide that no transfer between appropri-\n\nation sections may be made without authorization by the General\n\nr\\ssembly. However, the General Assembly resolution approving the\n\nBudget each year has autborized the transfer of funds between sections\n\nwith the prior coiicurrence of the ad vis or)^Committee (for example,\n\nwhile available if there are sufficient surplus funds in other sections\n\nof the Budget, and while used on occasion for other purposes, has iiot\n\nbeen employed to date for the payment of awardsmade by the Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal.\n\nAs a third procedure, the Secretary-General might, with the concur-\n\nrence of the Advisory Committee, make the payment by a withdrawal\n\nfrom the \\Vorking Capital I'uiid provided that the awards could be\n\nconsidered as unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. He would then\n\nsubmit a rcvised total Budget in his supplementary estimates. Each\n\nyear the General Assembly has ap roved resolutions relating to unfore-\n\nseen and extraordinary expenses ?for example, Resolution 787 of the\n\nEighth Session) and to the \\Vorking Capital Fund (for example, Resolu-\n\ntion 788 of the Eighth Session) which could authorize the Secretary-\n\nGeneral toenter into commitments to meet uiiforeseen and extraordinary\n\nexpenses and to advance money from the Workiiig Capital Fund for\n\npayment. In such a case the Secretary-General must submit supple-\n\nmentary estimates to the General Assembly with a report of al1commit-\n\nments and the circumstances relating thereto. The appropriation by\n\nthe General Assembly in such a case, however, is for the purpose of\n\nreplenishing the \\Vorking Capital Fund and not for the purpose of\n\npayment which would already have been made. \\\\'hile tbeoreticallyavailable, if the expenses are unforeseen and extraordinary, this third\n\nmethod also has not been employed by the Secretary-General for the\n\npayment of awards made by the Administrative Tribunal.\n\nAs a fourth procedure, the Secretary-Generalmight request the General\n\nAssembly for funds for the direct payment of the awards by submitting\n\nsupplementary estimates for tliis purpose. Such estimates are first\n\nsubmitted to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\n\nQuestions.\n\nOnly in the case of this last method, which in fact has been employed\n\nonly with respect to the awards made in 1gj3, would the General\n\nAssembly have an opportunity to consider wliether or not to appropriate\n\nthe funds necessary to give cffect to awards of compensations made\n\nby the Administrative Tribunal. Tlius, under esisting procedures and\n\npast practices, the opportunity of the General Assembly to consider\n\nan appropriation for the payment of specific awards is dependent on\n\nthe fortuituus circumstance of whetlier or not funds are available in the\n\ncurrent budget. On the other haiid. the Assembly might, particularly\n\n\\vitIl respect to the third procedure whicli 1 have described, discuss the\n\nmatter after the payment had boen made.\n\nIii concluding my remarks concerning Budgetary Procedures relating\n\nto the payment of amards, 1 should like to observe that the Statute of\n\nthe Administrative Tribunal of the League of Xations provided tliat\n\nany compensation awarded by the Tribuiial should be chargeable to the\n\nbudget of the Administration concerned. In implementation of this\n\nprovision of the Statute, it was recommeiided in the report of the\n\nSupervisory Commission when it proposed the Statute, that a nomiiial\n\nainount of one thousand francs sliould be inserted in the budgets of\n\nthe League Secretariat aiid of the Iriternational Labour Officeso as to\n\nprovide an item to whicli such comnensation could be charaed if it\n\nescess of this nominal vote would be provided by a transfer under the\n\nusual guarantees.\n\nA secoiid question concerns reinstatement in relation to the payment\n\nGeneral Assembly concern only \"ail award of compensation made by the\n\nthe Tribuiial in favour of a staff inember of the United Nations whose\n\ncoiitract of service has been tenninated witliout his assent\". Never-\n\ntheless, it is impossible, in the light of Article g of the Statute, to con-\n\nsider this question without bearing in mind the relation between rein-\n\nstatement and payment of compeiisation.\n\nArticleg of the Statute which prescribes the right of the Tribunal\n\nto award compensation, gives tlie Tribunal the rigtit in the first instance\n\nto order the rescinding of the decision contested or the specific perfom-\n\nance of the obligation involved. Under the present wording of Article 9,\n\nit is within the absolute discretion of the Secretary-General to decide,\n\nin the interest of the United 'I:itions, that the applicant should be\n\ncompensated in lieu of such rescisiori or specific performance.\n\nThe drafting history of Article 9, as well as the original wording of\n\nthe Article approved by the Gencral Asseinbly in 1949, indicated that\n\nit was at that time believed that tlie Secretarv-Gcneral would use his STATEIEST BY hlr. STAVROPOULOS (u.x.)-IO VI 54\n\n291\n\ncretion only if rescision or specific performance was in his opinion impos-\n\nsible or inadvisable.\n\nExperience over a number of years, ho~vever, showed that in many\n\ncases it was necessary for the Secretary-General to ask that the Tribunal\n\naurard compensation in lieu of rescision of the terminatioii. The Secre-\n\ntary-General, iii his report on Personnel Policy to the Eiglith Session\n\nof the General Assembly, stated :\n\n\"Experience lias indicated that, particularly in cases invol.viiig\n\ntermination of appointment, where the Tribunal finds tliat the\n\napplication is well founded, the payrnent of compensation should\n\nbe the rule rather than the exception. It is normally not in keeping\n\nwith tlie iiiterest of good administration to reiiistate an employee\n\nwhom the Secretary-General has considered it necessary to ternii-\n\nnate. At tlie same time. from the n ointof view 01tlie staff member.\n\nexperience arid consideratioiis indicate that the normal reaction,\n\nin case a decision of the Secretary-General is iiot uplield by the\n\nAdmiiiistrative Tribunal, should be tlie payinent of compensat'1011.\n\nIn those circumstances. however. where the Secretarv-General\n\nbtiliçves tliat it \\i.olicitIje<lisnd~:iiit:~g~~~oiiesciiiil Iiis<lecisioii.\n\nlie shuiilil Ii:ive tlie oyt<ilt,nciiiig ~uclir~~sciuioitio tlic ;ippliciirit\n\nin lieu of the compensation ordered?\n\nArticle g \\vas amended by the General Assembly at its Eighth Session\n\nin response to tliis suggestion of the Secretary-General. The present\n\ntext of Article 9 provides, inter alia,that if the Tribunal finds that the\n\napplication is well founded it shall order the rescinding of the decision\n\ncontested or tlie specific performance of the obligation invoked. It also\n\nprovides tliat at the same time the Tribunal shall fix the amouiit of\n\ncompensation to be paid to the applicant forthe injury sustained, sliould\n\nthe Secretary-General decide, in the interest of the Uiiited Nations,\n\ntliat the applicaiit should bc compensated without fiirther actioii beiiig\n\ntaken.\n\nUnder this text, the same judgment of the Tribunal is to contain\n\nboth an order of reinstatemerit and the fixing of compensation. It is\n\nthen for the Secrekiry-General to decide whether, in tlie interest of the\n\nUnited Nations, tlie applicant is to be compensated rather than rein-\n\nstated. Under the former text, compensation was fised in a subsequent\n\njudgment in lieu of reinstatement when the Secretary-Gerieral decided\n\nthat such reinstatement was impossible or inadvisable. Uiider both texts\n\nthe close relationship between reinstatement and compensation is\n\napparent.\n\nAccordingly, the Secretary-General is concerned with tlie problem of\n\nthe consequences wliich refusal by the General Assembly to give effect\n\nto an award of compeiisation might have on his right, under Article g.\n\nto refuse reinstatement ordered by the Tribunal.\n\nBefore proceeding to a discussion of United Xations practices with\n\nrespect to biidgetary powers of the General Assembly on the one Iiand\n\nand obligations of the Oreanization on the other. 1 should like to reriew\n\nbriefly the bases of these two concepts as they relate to the qiiestions\n\nbefore the Court.292 STATE~IEST BY :,IrSTA\\'ROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54\n\nOn the oiie hand, there are the budgetary powers of the General\n\nconsider and approve the Budget of the Organization. Under Article 18,\n\nhudgetary questions are among the important questions requiring\n\na two-thirds majority vote in tlie General Assembly.\n\nOn the other hand, there are the legal obligations of the Organization.\n\nThe Secretary-General has already pointed out in his \\\\'ritten Statement\n\nto the Court that the StaffRegulations and Staff Rules are incorporated\n\nby refereiice in the letters of ap ointment of staff memhers. For example,\n\nthe permanent appointment orm contains the following provisions :\n\n\"You are hereby offered a permanent appointment in the Secre-\n\ntariat of the United Nations, in accordance with the terms and\n\nconditions as specified, as amended by or as otherwise provided\n\nin the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules, together with such amend-\n\nandtsuch Staff Rules. A copy of the Staff Regulations and Staffns\n\nRules is transmitted hereivith.\"\n\nThe same letter of appointment also provides that a permanent\n\nappointment may be terminated by the Secretary-Genernl in accordance\n\nwith the relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules.\n\nSimilar provisions are also contaiiied in the other letters of appointment.\n\n111 turn, the Staff Regulations provide inter aliathat the United\n\nNations Administrative Tribiinal shall, under conditions provided in\n\nits Statute, hear and pass judgment on applications from staff members\n\nalleging non-observance of the terms of their appointment including\n\nal1 pertinent regulations and niles. Thus, as long as the present Staff\n\nRegulations remain in force, the provision of the Administrative Tribunal\n\nis a part of the legal relationship between the staff member and the\n\nOrganization.\n\nFurthemore, as 1 have just iioted, the Administrative Tribunal is\n\nauthorized, in accordance with the provisions of Articleg of the Statute,\n\nthat the compensation shall be fixed hy the Tribunal and paid by theides\n\nUnited Nations, or as appropriate, by the specialized agencies partici-\n\npating under Article 12. Article IO, paragraph z, provides that the\n\njudgments shall be final and without appeal. These provisions are the\n\nbasis for the conclusion drawn by many Memher States that there is\n\na legal obligation involved witli respect to ail award made by the\n\nAdministrative Tribunal.\n\n1should now like to examine the United Nations practice with respect\n\nto the exercise of the hudgetary power under such circumstances.\n\nIt \\r.ould seem elementary that there should be difference in the exercise\n\nof the biidgetary power with respect, on the one hand, to future plans\n\nand programmes where the discretion ofthe General Assembly isabsolute,\n\nand, on the other hand, to obligations and commitments which have\n\nbeen already duly made. In fact, with regard to such commitments\n\nand obligations, the practice of the United Xations under its Financial\n\nRegulations does not ordinanly involve consideration by the General\n\nAssenibly.\n\nLikewise, it may be noted that the General Assembly does not\n\nordinarily consider specific expcnditures even with regard to future\n\nprogrammes, but deals rather with general categories. Geiieral Assembly STATEAIENT Bi' hlr. STAVROPOULO (u.s.)-IO VI 54 293\n\nappropriations are normally made with respect to a class of espenses,\n\nand it is for the Secretary-General, as Chief Administrative Officer, to\n\nmake the specific commitments and payments within this general\n\nanthorization. Furthermore, as already noted, the Secretary-General,\n\nwith the prior concurrence of the Advisory Cornmittee on Administrative\n\nand Budgetary Questions, or in certain cases even without such concur-\n\nfrom the It'orking Capital Fund.reseen and extraordinary expenses\n\n. The United Nations, under Article 105 of the Charter, enjoys in the\n\nterritory of each of its Members such privileges and immunities as are\n\nnecessary for the fulfilrnent of its purposes. The detailed privileges and\n\nimmunities provided by this Article of the Charter have been defined\n\nin the Convention on Privileges and Irnrnunities of the United Nations.\n\nThe Convention, inter alia, provides for immunity from any form of\n\nlegal process.\n\nIf the Organization were not immune, persons with respect to whom\n\nit had obligations could go into the national courts and seck redress.\n\nSuch a course of procedure, ho~ve\\~er,might be a serious handical) to\n\nthe Organization in the fulfilment of its purposes. It has therefore been\n\nconsidered necessary and desirable that this immunity be maintained.\n\nAt the same time, however, the Organization has not desired that its\n\nirnmunity should be a cause of denial of justice or a shield to avoid\n\npayment of legal obligations. It therefore desired to provide adequate\n\nprocedures for the settlement of disputes in lieu of submission to national\n\ncourts.\n\nThis principle has heen emhodied in the Convention on Privileges\n\nand Irnmunities adopted by the General Assembly. Section zg of .this\n\nConvention requires the United Nations to make provisions for appro-\n\nria te modes of settlement with resvect to two tv~e,.of disriutes.

Because of the existence of this immunity, an arbitration claiise\n\nis also generally inserted in such contracts. Th'isclause provides that\n\nany claim or controversy arising out of a contract shall he settled by\n\narbitration. It also provides that both parties agree to be bound by any\n\narbitral award which is made.\n\nHowever, it is further stated in this clause that nothing therein shall\n\nconstitute a waiver of the Organization's immunity. This means, in\n\neffect, that any arbitral award given against the United Nations cannot\n\nbe enforced by the other side. Thus, the other party enters into the\n\ncontract knowing that in the final analysis he is ohliged to rely upon 294 STATEMEST Bi' NT. STAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54\n\nthe good faith of the United Nations iii paying any award made against\n\nit. This postulation of good faith in the meeting of commitments and\n\nlégalobligations is, 1 believe, a siizcqua iioitfor the successful conduct\n\nof the business of the Organization.\n\nInthe case of staff members, theorganization has provided the Admin-\n\nistrative Tribunal for the settlenient of claims arising out of contracts.\n\nThe Supervisory Commission, \\vhicti prepared the draft Statute of\n\nthe Administrative Tribunal of the League of Xations, pointed out in\n\nits report that the international status of the League prevented officials\n\nfrom bringing action in the ordinary courts to enforce the provisions\n\nof their contracts. It then observed that it could not be considered\n\nright that a class ofemployees, amouiiting ta several hundreds of persons\n\nand engaged on terms which were necessarily complicated and which\n\nmight give nse to dispiites as to their legal effect, should have no means\n\nof referring questions as to their riglits to a decision of a judicial body.\n\nThis passage of the report is quoted in the Written Statementsubmitted\n\nby the Government of France together with observations of MI. Siraud.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Advisory Committee on a Statute for a United\n\nNations Administrative Tribunal, in presenting a draft Statute, said :\n\n\"The United Xations is not suable in any national court without\n\nits consent ; nor can it be stied by an officia1in the International\n\nCourt of Justice. Tiy cre:iting a tribunal to serve as a jurisdiction\n\n- open toits many officialsof various nationalities, the United Nations\n\nwill be acting not oiily in the iiiterest of efficient administration,\n\nbut also in the cause of justice.\"\n\nIn addition to the discussion with respect to the budgetary powers\n\nof the General Assernbly, there have been issues raised concerning the\n\nsupervisory powers of the General Assetnbly in relation to the Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal. It has been argued tliat the Tribunal is a subsidiary\n\norgan of the General Assembly and that, therefore, its decisions are\n\nsubject to review by the Assembly. On the basis of this argument it\n\nwould be impossible for a subsidiary organ to take a decision binding\n\nupon the principal organ which createcl it.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been iirgued that, while the General Assem-\n\nbly established the Adininistratioe Tribunal ancl can amend its Statute\n\nor abolish the Tribunal altogether, it cloesnot follow that the Assenibly\n\ncan refuse to gire effect to tlie Tribunal's decisions.\n\nIt may he of interest to the Court if 1 were to review the position of\n\nsubsidiary organs in general in thcir relationship to the General Assem-\n\nbly, and describe certain aspects and practices which may be relevant\n\nto the consideration of this issue.\n\nThe principal organs of tlie United Nations are established and specifi-\n\ncally enurnerated in paragraph I of Article7 of the Charter. They are :\n\nthe General Assembly. the Security Council, the Economic and Social\n\nCouncil, the Trusteeship Council, tlie International Court of Justice, and\n\nthe Secretariat. Paragraph 2 of Article 7 provides that such subsidiary\n\norgans as may be fouiid necessary may be established in accordance\n\nwitli the Charter. With respect to the General Assembly, the Charter\n\nspecifically States in Article22 th:it \"The General Assembly may estab-\n\nlish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance\n\nof its functions.\" A similnr provision concerning the Security CounciL\n\nis contained in Article zg.' STATE.\\IEST BY AIT. STAVROPOULOS (u.s.)-IO VI 54 2gj\n\nThere are, in addition, a few organs which may not be characterized\n\nas either principal or subsidiary under Article 7 of the Charter. Certain\n\norgans which function within the orbit of the United Nations and are\n\nsupported from the United Natioiis Budget, i.e. the Permanent Central\n\nOpium Board and the Drug Supervisory Body, were establislied by\n\ntreaty and not by a principal organ in accordance with the Charter.\n\nFurthermore, the Military Staff Committee was provided directly in\n\nArticle 47 of the Charter, but is not a principal organ under Article 7.\n\nThe General Assemblv. oursuant to its Dowers under Articlc 22 of\n\nthe Charter, has establiSl,ed nearly 100 subsidiarz o;gans since it first\n\nmet in London in the early part of rq46.

But the Assembly often desires to have pûrticu-\n\nlar studies conducted between sessions and has established numerous\n\ncommittees to consider and report on specific subjects. For example,\n\nthere were the Committees on International Criminal Jurisdiction, the\n\nSuecial Committee on Admission of Xew Xembers. and the Collecti\\~e\n\n3ieasures Cornmittee. Subsidiary organs of this type are very numerous\n\nand many more could be enumerated, but 1 belicve these will serve as\n\nadequateillustration.\n\n1shouldlike to note one other organ, however. The Interim Committee\n\nof the General Assembly, first established in 1047 and placed on a296 STATEMEST BY 3IT.STAYROPOULOS (u.x.)-IO VI 54 ,\n\nof international CO-ooeration in the oolitical field, and the ~eaceful\n\nadjustment of situations likely to impâir the general welfare oririendly\n\nrelations among nations. Because of the very hroad sphere of actirity\n\nof this Commitfee. there was oarticular carein the ~&t of its soonso~s\n\nto point out that the functiois of this \"Little Assembly\" were'largely\n\nconfined to cqnsidenng and reporting to the General Assembly. This\n\nfunction. however. covered bath the consideration of eeneral Droblems\n\naiid tlie coiisiderntioii of spccifiî disputes.

Thus, Resolution IIZ of the Second\n\nSession. which recommended the holding of~~\"e~ti~ns~in Korea for the\n\nestablishinent of an independent government, authorized the ~em~orary\n\nCommission on Korea to consult with the Interim Committee with\n\nresl~ectto the application of the Resolution. In 1948. by anthorization\n\nof the General Assemhl (Resoliition 196 (III) of 3 Decemher 1948),\n\nthe Interim Committee &came the only subsidiary organ which might\n\nrequest advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice; and\n\nin 1950 it was authorized to utilize the Peace Observation Commission\n\n(Resolution 377 (V) of 3 Xovember 1950).\n\nThe primary function of each committee falling within this category\n\nof subsidiary organs, including even the Interim Committee, is to study\n\nand report to the General Assembly.\n\nA second group of subsidiary organs are those having active political\n\nfunctions. Political Commissions may likewise have the function of\n\nstudying and reporting to the General Assembly, particularly with\n\nrespect ta observations or investigations in the field. This was the\n\nprimary function in the case of the United Xations Special Committee\n\non Palestine. But this function of reporting may well be only incidental\n\nto the performance of other functions, and may not be the primary\n\npurpose of the organ. Assistance in estahlishing governments, as in\n\nLihya, in bnnging about a federation, as in Eritrea, and in supervising\n\nelections, as in Korea in 1948,may be the principal function ofthe sub-\n\nsidiary organ. Mediation and conciliation may in other cases be the\n\nprimary function, as in Palestine. Observation as a means of maintaining\n\npeace may also be important, as in the Balkans, where there was first\n\nthe United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans, and later the\n\nBalkan sub-commission of the I'eace Observation Commission. These\n\nsubsidiary organs whidi operate in the field must often, within their\n\nterms of reference, take final actions and decisions.\n\nA third category of subsidiary organs includes those which 1 have\n\ncalled Administrative Assistance Organs. These organs have been\n\nestablished bv the General Assemblv to assist it in carrvine out its\n\nfunctions rt:latirii: to finlinrial. l>iidg&t;iry:a<liiiinistra6\\~eum:ittt:rs.\n\n7'lieyiiicludc the .Ad\\,isijry('ominittrc on Administrative aiid Uudget;try\n\nOuestions. the Coiiiiiiittee on Coritrihiitions. the l'<oardof i\\uditors. aiid\n\nthe. h'egotiating Committee for ~xtra-~ud~etary Funds.\n\nA fewrepresentatives have suggested that the Administrative Tribunal\n\nshould also be classified as an administrative assistance organ of the\n\nGeneral Assembly.

TIie financial procedures followed with regard to these pro-\n\ngrammes differ from those applicable to the regular Budget of the\n\nOrganization. These differences are maiiifested mainly in the manner\n\nin which the activities of these organs are financed, in the financial\n\nregulations under which they operate, in the vestiiig ofgreater authority\n\nto determine the disposition of tlie funds in the agency concerned, and\n\nin the less rigid controls exercised by the General Assembly over the\n\ndisposition of the funds.\n\nThe first aspect which 1 will mention concerns the financing of these\n\nprogrammes. A feature common to al1is the fact that they are financed\n\nfrom voluntary contributions of governments rather than by assess-\n\nments uiider the reylar budget of the Organization. For this reason,\n\nthese programmes are sometimes called extra-budgetary programmes.\n\nAn exception is the administrative expenses of tlie Office of the High\n\nCommissioner for Refugees, which are paid from the regular United\n\nNations Budget.\n\nA second aspect relates to the application of financial regulations.\n\nArrangements made by the General Assembly with respect to the finan-\n\ncial regulations which govern the operation of the programmes have\n\nnot been unilorm. The Statute of the Officeof the High Commissioner\n\nfor Refugees provides that the administration of the Office shall be\n\nsubject to the regular Financial Replations and liules of the United\n\nNations. On the other hand, the Agent of the United Nations Korean\n\nReconstruction Agency and the Ilirector-General of the United Xations\n\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees are authorized to\n\nestablish finaiicial regulations for tlieir respective agencies. Each was\n\nreouired to do so in consultation with the Secretarv-General and the\n\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and ~od~et;;~ Questions ;and\n\nin addition, the Agent-General of ihe United Nations Korean Reconstruc-\n\ntion Ageiicy had ?O secure tlie agreement of the Advisory Committee of\n\nhis agency. \\Vith regard to the United Nations Children's Fund and\n\nthe Expanded Programnie ofTechnical Assistance, certain specifiedfinan-\n\ncial arrangements were laid down or approve<-lby GeneralAssembly\n\nresolutions, but no express provisions were included as to the financial\n\nregulations which should apply to these programmes. In point of fact,\n\nthe regular Financial Replations of the United Nations are applied.\n\nA thircl aspect of particular interest concerns the authority delegated\n\nbv the General Assemblv for the disuosition of funds.

The limits set for these programmes, however, are not\n\nrigid since the Agency is authorized to transfer funds or make other\n\nnecessary adjustments. Resolutions of the l'ourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh\n\nand Eighth Sessions of the General Assembly have provided for such\n\nadjustment. Perhaps the most direct authorization was that made at\n\nthe Sisth Session by the General Assembly.

However,\n\nconsiderable :lutlioritv has been granted to the Technical Assistance\n\nBoard in regard to théallocation of funds.\n\nVery broad discretion with respect to disposition of funds has heen\n\ngranted by the General Assembly with respect to the United Xations\n\nChildren's Fund, the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency\n\nandthe High Commissioner for Refugees. As regards the first, the power\n\nto allocate the resources of the Fund is vested in the Executive Board\n\nof the Fund. General Assembly Resolution 417 of the Fifth Session\n\nprovided that the Board, in accordance ivitli such principles as may be\n\nlaid down by the Economic and Social Council and the Social Commis-\n\nsion, should formulate the policies, determine the programmes, and\n\nallocate the resources of the Fund for the purpose of meeting, through\n\nthe provision of supplies, training and advice, emergency and long-range\n\nneeds of children and their continuine needs ~articularlv in under-\n\ndeveloped countries, with a vie; to strengthening wherevepthis may be\n\nappropriate, the permanent child health and child welfare programmes\n\nof ihëconntries rêceivingassistance. . .\n\nThe Agent-General of the United Nations Korean Reconstruction\n\nAgency, under General Assembly Resolution 410 of the Fifth Session,\n\nis authorized to use contributions iii kind or services at his discretion\n\nfor tlic prugr;iriiiiit: of relief niid r~.Ii~I>ilitatioiiiind :idiiiinistrstive\n\nczpciiscs coniir.ctecl ther~~\\r.irli..Ar1i\\dvisor!~ Curiiiiiitr~<~,onsistiiig of\n\ntlic rei>rescnt.iti\\.cuf fi\\.c \\~ci~ ~er St;itcs. is r~st:iblislicdto :id\\.ise the\n\n.Agciit:(;ener:il with rt~;iril tu iiinjor iii1;incinl pruciireriiçiit. distribution\n\n:iii<i>tlierecon,miic pr~~l>lc~i~ is<.rt:iiiiiOi llis ~11.~iiiiaiiigd opcriiti<,iis.\n\n:\\ siiii11:irl>rr,:t(l~Ii~cr~ri15ivest,:d iii thc 1.1161< 1~~:~iii.i~sioncfror\n\nI(~.fiig~càa.110,un<l,irtlic '-.t:iri.f1.i.Oiticc is .~utl.oih (1to :i<liiiiiiiiicr\n\nail!, fiiiiiij uiihlic or i>ri\\.i~l~i;lIic rcccivej for ii~ilithllcc tu ri.fu:c1.5,\n\nand to disiribute thém among the private and, as appropriate, public\n\nagencies whicli he deems best qualified to administer such assistance.\n\nHe does not have this broad discretion, however, with respect to adminis-\n\ntrative expenses which are paid from the regular United Xations budget\n\nandare subject to the same scrutiny as the rest of the budget.\n\nThe broad discretion vested in these agencies for the' disposition of\n\nfunds represeiits at the same time a less rigid set of controls by the\n\nGeneral Assembly. The practice of the General Assembly with regard to tlie delegation of financial powers to these subsidiary organs would\n\nappear to indicate that the General Assembly has not considered it\n\nnecessary to pass upon the disposition of every dollar which comes\n\ninto tlie custody of the Organizalion.\n\n[Public sittifzg of ]une ~oth, 1954, afternoon]\n\nA final categoiy of orgaiis established by the General Assembly is\n\nthat of judicial bodies. The Assemblv lias, in addition to the Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal, set up a United sations Tribunal in Libya and in\n\nEritrea.\n\nIn accordance with the provisii>nsof the Treaty of l'eace with Italy,\n\nthe question of the disposal of the formerItalian colonies was submitted\n\nto tlie General Assembly on ~j September 1948 by ttie Governments\n\nof l'rance, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kirigdom\n\nof Great Britain and Northern lreland and tlie United States of America.\n\nAs part of the settlemeiit, the General Assembly, by Resolution 388\n\n(V) of 15 December 1950 approvecl articles oii economic and financial\n\nprovisions relating to Libya. Tlia final article provided that a United\n\nNations Tribunal should be set up, composed of three persans selected\n\nbv the Secretani-General for their leeal aualifications froin the nationals\n\nof three differeit States not directlYinterested.\n\nThe Tribunal, whose decisioii was to be based on law, \\vas given the\n\nfollo\\ving two functions :\n\nFirst, it should give to tlie Administering Powers, the Libyan\n\nGovernment after its establishmeiit. and the Italian Government,\n\non n:quest by those aiitliorities, sucli instructions as inight be\n\nrequircd for the purpose of giving effect to the rcsolution of the\n\nGëneral Assembly.\n\nSecond, it shoulcl decide al1 disputes arisiiig between the afore-\n\nnientioned authorities concerning the interpretatioii and applica-\n\ntion of the resolntion. The Tribunal rvould be seised of aiiy such\n\ndispute on the unilateral request of one of those antliorities.\n\nThe Tribunal \\vas authorized to determine its own proccdure. In\n\ntlie absence of unanimity, tlie Tribiinal could take decisions by a majority\n\nvote. Its decisions were to be final and bindinr. Xo provisioii was made\n\n-~~ ~ ~orts~ ~ ~h~ G~neral t2ssemblv. ,, for an; revikv of its <Iecisiorisbv\n\nthe General Assembly.\n\nAt the following sessiori of tlie Genernl Assembly, a United Natioiis\n\nTribunal was established by Resolution 530 (VI) of 1952, in coniiection\n\nwith the economic and finnncial provisions relating to Eritrea. The terins\n\nof refereiice of this Tribunal were similar but not i<leritical witli the\n\nterins of reference of the Tribunal for Libya. An ad<-litiorialprovision\n\n.ofinterest was that the United Nations Tribunal in Eritrea should have\n\n.esclusive cornuetence on iiiatters fallinrr \\vithiil its functioris. In the\n\n.event of any Latter Ùi dispute Iieiiig rcferred to the Tribunal, it was\n\nprovided that any action pending in civil courts should be siispended.\n\nAs in the case of the United X;itioris Tribunal in Libya, iio provision\n\nwas made for reports to tlic General Assembly, or for any review by\n\nthe Assenibly. There has been consi<lerable disciission by the General Assembly of\n\nthe ~ossibilitv and desirabilitv of establishine an international criminal\n\ncou;. As eariy as 1948 the .&sembly adopted a resolution in which it\n\nconsidered \"that in the course of development of the international\n\ncommunity, there will be an increasing need of an international judicial\n\norgan for the trial of certain crimes under international law\". Since\n\nthat time the subject has been examined by the International Law\n\nCommission and by Committees on International Criminal Jurisdiction\n\nestablished by the General Assembly which met in 1951 and 1953.\n\nTwo principal methods of establisliing sucli a court were considered.\n\nOne method was by resolution of the General Assembly, the other by a\n\nmultilateral conveiition. The 1953 Committee on International Criminal\n\nJurisdiction favoured the second mcthod. In the discussion, however,\n\nthere were several points raised whicli are relevant to our present\n\nconsideration.\n\nThe Report of the Coinmittee siirnin:~rizesthe views expressed in these\n\ndiscussions as follows :\n\nSome members believcd tliat the legal powers of the General Assembly\n\nunder the Charter were not sufficient to enable it to establish a court\n\nby r:soliirioii.

Under Article II, the Assemblv mas eiven functions with\n\nregard to the indntenaiice of internatiorcal pea& and security. The\n\nexistence of ail international crimirial jurisdiction, it was argued, rvould\n\nbe a factor in the maintenance of peice, since it would stringthen the.\n\nmoral opinion of the ivorld agairist international crimes. Therelore,\n\nnothing in the Charter prevcnted the General .assembly from creating an\n\ninternational criminal court as a siibsidiary organ. Such a subsidiary\n\norgan, it was said, miglit wcll be entitled to do things which the General\n\nAssembly itself could iiever perform, provided that its activity was in\n\nthe iiiterest of tlie mainteilancc of peace.\n\nSome mcmbers fclt tlmt tlicre would be a serious ioçç of independence\n\nand stability if the court wcre set up by a resolution, which could always\n\nhe repealed or niodificd later by tlie Geiieral Assembly. The same argu-\n\nment would apply, it was believcd, if the court were a subsidiary organ,\n\nthe budget of which Iiad to be deblited each year. Those who favoured\n\nthe resolution method took the view that the stability, permanence and\n\nindependence of the court would be adequately safeguarded, since the\n\nGeneral Assembly would ?lot reverse a decision taken on so important\n\na subject.\n\nThe report does not malie any reference to the question of review\n\nof decisions by the General Assembly.302 STATEYEST BY Mr. STAVROPOULO(S u.N.)-IO \\'154\n\nIn reviewing the character of the .4dministrative Tribunal it is\n\napparent that the tenninology in its Statute is that generally followed\n\nwith respect to judicial bodies. -4rticle 2 of its Statute refers to the\n\ncompetence of the Tribunal to pass judgment on application. The tenn\n\njudgment, clearly a judicial terni, is also used in Articles IO and 12.\n\nIt is true that in the English test the word \"competencc\" is used rather\n\nthan \"jiirisdiction\", which latter is perhaps a morc common judicial\n\nphrase. In this connection, Iiowf:ver, it can be noted that while the\n\ntenn \"jurisdiction\" is used in Artide 36 of the Statute of tlie lnter-\n\nnational Court of Justice, the title of Chapter II which iiicludes Article\n\n36 is \"Competence of the Court\".\n\n-4rticle 6 of the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal indicates\n\ncertain rules of procedure of a judicial character. Furthermore, several\n\nprovisions of tlie Statute appear to be borrowed from the Statute of\n\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice, or even earlier judicial\n\ntests, via the Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the League of\n\nNations. One of the most important of these is paragraph z of Article\n\nIO, which provides that \"The judgrnent shall be final and without\n\nappeal.\" An almost identical provision was contained in Article 60 of\n\nthe Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, and in\n\nthe same Article of the Statute of this Court. Paragraph 3 of Article 2\n\nrelating to the Tribunal's right to decide its own competence also\n\nappears tibe bascd on siinilar provisionsin the Statute of the predecessor\n\nof this Court, which willalso be found in Article 36of the present Statute.\n\nAs has been pointed out on several occasions, the General Assembly\n\nchose to use tlie word \"Tribunal\" rather than \"Staff Claims Board\".\n\n\". the other hand, it decided to use the word \"member\" instead of\n\nludge\" and \"executive secretary\" instead of \"registrar\".\n\n1 should also like to examine certain other aspects of the relationship\n\nof the Administrative Tribunal to the General Assemblv. It would\n\nseem that the Tribunal has been established pursuant to the authority\n\nof the General Assembly under Article 22 of the Charter and, therefore,\n\nin thissense is properly designated as a subsidiary organ.\n\nThe Statute by which the Administrative Tribunal was established\n\nwas adopted by the General Assembly by Resolution 351 (IV) on\n\n24 November 1949. The Statute, in accordance with its Article II, may.\n\nbe amended by decisions of the General Assembly. It is also generally\n\naccepted tliat the Statute could be complctcly repealed and the Tribunal\n\nabolished by decison of the General Assembly. It is not believed that\n\nsuch action by the General Assembly would violate acquired rights of\n\nstaffmembers. This view has been supported by almost al1members of\n\nthe General Assembly who have commented on the subject and would\n\nalso seem to be supported by recent decisions of the Tribunal.\n\nThe Tribunal stated in recent judgments that while the contractual\n\nelements of the relations between the staff members of the United\n\nNations cannot be changed without the agreement of the two parties,\n\nthe statutory elements, on the other hand, can always be changed at\n\nany time though regulations established by the General Assembly, and\n\nthese changes are binding on staff members. It further defined al1\n\nmatters as contractual which affect the personal status of each staff\n\nmember, for example, the nature of Iiis contract, salary and grade.\n\nIt defined al1 matters as statutory elements which affect in general the\n\norganization of the international. civil service, and the need for its STATENEXT BY >Ir. STAVROPOULO(S u.s.)-IO VI 54 303\n\nproper functioning, for example, general mles that have no persona1\n\nreference. It would certainly seem that the provision of an Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal falls within the statutory elements.\n\nAnother factor in the relationship of the General Assembly to the\n\nAdministrative Tribunal is provided by Article 3 of the Statute under\n\nwhich members are appointcd by the General Assembly. A proposa1\n\nthat the members stiould be appointed by the International Coiirt of\n\nJustice instead of by the General Assembly was not acccpted. On the\n\nother hand, a member cannot be dismissed by the General Assembly\n\nunless the other members of the Tribunal are of the unanimous opinion\n\nthat he is unsuited for further service. A close decision of the Fifth\n\nCommittee to the effect that the dismissal of a member of the Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal could take place merely by a two-thirds majority vote\n\nof the General Assembly was reversed in the plenary meeting of the\n\nGeneral Assembly.\n\nIt may further he noted that the Statute of the Tribunal does not\n\nprovide for any report to the General Assembly or for any review of\n\nits decisions:\n\n1;ruiii tlic nbow siirvcy. tlic f;iit nii,it iiiiiiirdintcl!~;il>pnrcntis the\n\ngrcdt \\.;iri.iriivlliilcsiits\\vitIrcs1h:cttu ,iilisiiii:ir! urgniii cjt:il>liilic<l\n\nII\\,tlii.

It is Lot possiblEhithin\n\nthe scope of the present statement to attempt to analyze the minute\n\nvariations which exist in these respects from one organ to another.\n\nNor am 1 able to dcscribe the various other differences with respect\n\nto such subjects as n~les of procedure, reporting requirements, place\n\nof meeting, staff services, and other matters.\n\nIt is mnch more difficult to discover the few characteristics which\n\nthese organs have in common. Fundamentally, these appear to be that\n\nthe organs are established by the General Assembly and that their\n\nmembership, terms of reference and other particulars are defined by\n\nthe Assembly. Presumably the terms of reference could be changed or\n\nthe organ abolished by decision of the Assembly.\n\nThe requirement of a report is usual but not universal. Normally\n\nsuch report is to be made to the General Assembly. However, in some\n\ncases, as for example the Conciliation Commission for I'alestine, the\n\nGeneral Assembly has requested that reports he rendcred to the Secre-\n\ntary-General for transmission to Member States. In other cases reports\n\nare to he submitted not only to the General Assembly, but to other\n\norgans such as the Security Council as in the case of the Collective\n\nMeasuresCommittee and the Disrmament Commission,orthe Economic\n\nand Social Coùncil as in the case of the High Commissionerfor Refugees.\n\nIt is my hope that this description of United Nations practices with\n\nrespect to snbsidiary organs established by the General Assembly may\n\nQuestions now before it.n its consideration of the issues raised by the\n\n',The last Point refers to possible procedures for the application of\n\nprincipal grounds\" to individual cases.\n\nQuestion z is only to be answered by the Court if the reply to Ques-\n\ntion I 1sin the affirmative. 1wish to make it clear that by commenting\n\non the second question 1donot mean to imply any position with regard\n\nto the answer to Question I.

STAVROPOULO~ (u.N.)-IO VI 54\n\nfar as they relate to Question 2, wiUonly become relevant should Ques-\n\ntion I be answered in the affirmative by the Court.\n\nIt may be noted that in the discussions in the General Assembly or\n\nin Written Statements to the Court some governments have expressed\n\nthe view that issues in particular cases before tlie Tribunal could not\n\nproperly bc decided by a vote in the General Assembly. It was argued,\n\nfor example, by the representative of India in the Fifth Committee that\n\nthe General Assembly was not a proper forum to deal with questions\n\nof Iaw or especially to examine individual cases from tliat viewpoint.\n\n(India, Document 5, Fifth Committee, 425th meeting, paragraph 49.)\n\nThe representative of the Netberlands also expressed the view that the'\n\nGeneral Assembly could not perform judicial functions. (Netherlands,\n\nDocument z, FifthCommittee, 4ï1st meeting, paragraph 16 ; see also\n\nWritten Statemcnts, Distr. 54/17, page 85.)\n\nThe possible grounds on which the General Assembly miglit Iiave the\n\nright to refuse to give effect to an award wliich were suggcsted during\n\ndiscussions in the Fifth Committee have been collected in the Secretary-\n\nGeneral's Written Statement. Other proposed grounds have been set\n\nforth in the Written Statements of Members of the United Nations\n\nsnbinitted to the Court.\n\nSince 1 am not presuming in any way what the answer of the Court\n\nto Question I may be, it would be most inappropriate for me to presume\n\nany \"principal grounds\" which the Court might define in answer to\n\nQuestion 2. However, \\\\+th this reservation, 1 should like to note that\n\namong the possible grounds most frequently referred to by >lember\n\nStates are those which, in their application to particular cases, raise\n\ncertain problems of procedure. 1 may take, for example, the grounds\n\nfor revision or annulment of arbitral amards set forth by the Inter-\n\nnational Law Commissionin itsdraft Convention on Arbitral Procedure.\n\nThese embody a convenient summary of international jurisprudence on\n\nthe subjcct made by an organ of the United Xations, and have been\n\nreferred to bv several reuresentatives in discussions of the nresent case.\n\n~ ~ ~~-\n\ncorruption on the part of a member of'the Tribunal :and third, that\n\nthere has been a serious departure [rom a fundainental rule of procedure,\n\nincluding failure to state the reasons for the award. The draft also recog-\n\nnized as a ground for revision of the award the discovery of some fact of\n\nsuch ;inature as to have a decisive influenceon the award, provided that\n\n~hen the award was rendered that fact was not known to the Tribunal\n\nand to the party requesting revision and that such ignorance %-as not\n\ndiie to the negligence of the party requesting revision.\n\nIt is to be noted that while the International Law Commission indi-\n\ncated these as grounds for annulment or revision, it also siiggested the\n\nappropriate judicial procedures which it considered should be followed\n\nin applying these grounds. In the case of possiblegrounds of annulment,\n\nthe International Law Commissiorirecommended that the question be\n\nconsidered by the International Court of Justice, and if annulment was\n\ndecided, then the case should be re-submitted to a new tribunal. In\n\nthe case of possible grounds for revision, the arbitral tribunal itself, or,\n\nshould consider such revisionl, then the International Court of Justice, STATEhlENT BY Hr. STAVROPOU~OS (u.N.)-IO VI 54\n\n305\n\nIn the report of the Commission covering the work of its fifth session,\n\nthe following observations wcrc made with particular reference to excess\n\nof power as a ground for annulment :\n\n\"It is a fundamental-and inescapable-principle of jurisprudence\n\nthat an arbitral tribunal must have the power to determine its\n\ncompetence on tlie basis of the instrument which is the source of\n\nits jurisdiction. It is a no less fundamental principle that an award\n\nrendered in excess of the powers conferred by that instrument is\n\nnul1and void. The satisfactory operation of these two equally essen-\n\ntial principles can be assurcd only by an impartial judicial authority\n\ncompetent to decide whether there has taken place excess of juris-\n\ndiction.\"\n\nThe Governrneiit of thc Netherlands in its IVritten Statement to the\n\nCourt, after referring to tlie grounds enurnerated in the Draft Con-\n\nvention of the International Law Commission, stated :\n\n\"But there would be littlc poiiit in recognizing these grounds if\n\nnot at the same timc rriacliinery would be provided in order to\n\ndecide whether or not in a certain case these grounds are invoked\n\nrightly; leaving this to either party would deprive the award of\n\nits binding and final character.\" (1,C.J. Distr54/17.page 85.)\n\n1 might also note that the present Statute of the Administrative\n\nTribunal of the lnternational Labour Organization, as amended in 1946,\n\nprovides that tlie Governing Body of the International Labour Office\n\nor the Administrative Board of the Pensions Fund may challenge a\n\ndecision of the Tribunal confirming its jurisdiction, or may question\n\nthe validity of the decision ori the grounds that it is vitiated by funda-\n\nmental fault in the procedure followed. However, the Statute also\n\nprovides that the Governing Body must submit the question of the\n\nvalidity of the decision to the lnternational Court of Justice for an\n\nAdvisory Opinion, and the opinion given by the Court is binding.\n\nThe article provi~lingfor this challenge and reference to the Court \\vas\n\nadopted in October 1946, following the decision of the Assembly of\n\nthe League of Nations not to pay certain awards which had heen made\n\nhy the Tribunal which had served both the League of Xations and the\n\nInternational Labour Orgnnization.\n\nThe examples 1 gave suggest procedures which might be open to tlie\n\nGeneral Assembly with regard to the application of principal grouiids to\n\nparticular cases. III the first place, it might be possible that the Assembly\n\ncould order that the case be sent back to the Administrative Tribunal\n\nfor reconsideration. Thc procedure of revision is well-established in inter-\n\nnational practicc iii thc case of discovery of a new material fact. Such\n\nproceduri for rcvision would not seem to be inconsistent with a provision\n\nthat a judgment is final and witliout appeal. Article 60 of tlie Statute\n\nof the Iiitcrnatioiial Court of Justice provides that its judgments are\n\nfinal and witbout alilieal. The following Article of the Statute permits\n\nan application for revision when it is based upon the discovery of some\n\nfact of such a naturc as to be a decisive factor, which fact was, when the\n\njudgment was given, unknown to the Court and also tothe party claiming\n\nrevision, always provided tliat such ignorance was not due to negligence.\n\n\\Vhat is the possibility of reconsideration of a case by the Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal ? The Secretary-Gerieral in his \\Witten Staternent to306 STATE~IENT BY MT. <TAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54 l\n\nthe Court described the action in the case of Miss Jane Reed. In that\n\ncase, Counsel for the SecretaryGeneral applied for the revision of an\n\naward based on the correction of an error of fact. The Tribunal, in\n\nfixing the compensation, had based its computation on the age of\n\nMissReed and the time remaining beforeshe would have been eligible for\n\nretirement had shenot been terminated. It was subsequently discovered\n\nthat there was an error in the age and the fact was recognized by both\n\nparties.\n\nThe Tribunal, in correcting the award, stated tliat it was entitled\n\nto rectify figures computed on the basis of a date submitted by both\n\nparties and recognized by both after the judgment as erroneous. As\n\nnoted in the \\Vritten Statement, other questions relating to the power\n\nof the Administrative Tribunal to reconsider a case or revise a judgment\n\nare as yet undetermined by the Tribunal. The Statute of the Tribunal\n\nis silent on the subject.\n\n\\\\'liile the procedure of revision is normally limited to the discovery\n\nof migtake or of new material facts. it would appcar possible that a\n\nsimilar procedure could be considered for the re-esamination of a case on\n\nother possible grounds, should the Court findthat there areany grounds\n\nwhich would justify the Assembly in refusiog to give effect to an award.\n\nOn the other hand, as noted above in reference to the Statute of\n\nthe Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization,\n\nancl t r the drxft Convention on Arbitral Procedure pxepared by the\n\nInternational Law Commission, there is precedent for a procedure pro-\n\nviding for a request for an advisory opinion from the International Court\n\nof Justice in order to obtain a determination of the legal questions\n\ninvolved. The General Assembly might, in fact, providefor botli methods\n\nand, if ttie Assembly were still dissatisfied, reference to the Court.,\n\nPerhaps othe~ procedures, such, for example, as reference to a special\n\ncommittee of the Assembly, miglit also be considered for the examina-\n\ntion of issues of this kind in particular cases.\n\nI'resumably the procedures which 1have rnentioned could he provided\n\nby the Geiieral Assembly by amendment of the Statute of the Tribunal\n\nunder Article II. It is not my intention to discuss whether or uot they\n\ncoulà be applied without amendirig the present Statute. Such discussion\n\nwould involve consideration of whether or not there are \"any grounds\"\n\nunder the present Statute of the Admiiiistrative Tribunal and other\n\nrelevant iiistruments on wliich the General Assembly could refuse to\n\ngive effect to an award of compensation made by the Tribunal. As 1\n\nhave already emphasized, 1 did not intend, in discussing these proce-\n\ndural aspects, to imply any position with respect to the answer to Ques-\n\ntion I.\n\nIn closing 1 should like to refer to another possible ground which\n\nhas been frequently mentioned by representatives in their discussion\n\nof this matter. This possible ground is that of an unreasonably large\n\naward of compeiisation. The question of reasonableness of compensation\n\n\\vas undoubtedly of concern to the General Assembly. At its Eighth\n\nSession it dealt with the problem by an amendment to Article g of the\n\nStatute of the Administrative Tribunal. This Article was amended for\n\nthe purpose intear lia of placing a ceiling on the amount of compensation\n\nwhich might be awarded. STATEhlENT BY hlr.STAVROPOULOS (u.N.)-IO VI 54 307\n\nUnder the amended Article 9,compensation is not ta esceed the equiv-\n\nalent of two years' net base salary of the applicant. The Article further\n\nprovides, however, that the Tribunal may, in exceptional cases, when\n\nit considers it justified, order the payment of a higher indemnity. A\n\nstatement of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision is to accompany\n\neach such order.\n\n\\Vith respect ta this possible ground, it will thus be seen tliat the\n\nGeneral Assembly has acted in its legislaiive capacity in order to mini-\n\nmize the possibility of what it might consider an excessively large award. 2.

'l'liis:icti\\vas II~FC~\n\non tlieir refusal ta answer questions put ta them by an investigating\n\ncomrnittee of the United States Senate. These questions related ta mem-\n\nbership in the Cornmunist Party or subversive activities against the\n\nUnited States. The refusals to auswer were based upon a plea of the\n\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United .States upon the\n\nground that the answers might tend to incriininate the witnesses.\n\nThe discharged staff members filed applications with the United\n\nNations Administrative Tribunal, aileging non-performance or non-\n\nobservance of the terms of their contracts.\n\nTheAdministrativeTribunal rendered judgments in their favour, and\n\nawarded compensation to the eleven in the total amount of one hundred\n\nand seventy ~thousand dollars ($17o,ooo)-an average of more than\n\n$xj,ooo per employee. The highest single award was $40,000 ;the lowest,\n\n$4,700.\n\nThe Secretary-General included this amount of S170,oooin his budget\n\nreport to the General Assembly on Supplementary Estimates for the\n\nFinancial Year 1953, and proposed a supplementary appropriation of\n\nS17g.ooofor Section 17 of the United Nations Budget to pay the awards\n\nincluding compensation, adjusted salary ta date of termination, and\n\nlegal costs.\n\nSome Members of the Assenibly objected to the appropriation. Debate\n\ntlien ensued botli in favour of aiid against payrnent. Some members.\n\ntook the position that the Assembly had no power to refuse ta give\n\neffect ta the awards : that they were irrevocable and binding on the\n\nAssembly, which had no choice but to pay them. Others took the position\n\nthat the Assembly not only had the power but the cluty to examine\n\nauards of the Tribunal, and that these particular awards should not be\n\npaid. Still otliers took intermediate positions.\n\nIn the course of the debate it was proposed that, before the Assembly\n\nacted on the request for appropriation, the opinion of this Court should\n\nbe sought ;and on December g, 1gj3, the General Assembly adopted by\n\n41 votes ta 6, with 13 abstentions, a Resolution submitting two ques-\n\ntions to this Court for its advisory opinion. Tliese questions are :\n\n\"(1) Having regard to the Statute of the United Nations Adminis-\n\ntrative Tribunal and to any other relevant instruments and\n\nta the relevent records, has the General Assembly the right on any grounds to refuse to give effect to an award of com-\n\npensation made by that Tribunal in favour of a staff memher\n\nof theUnited Nationswhose contract of service has been termi-\n\nnated without liis assent ?\n\n(2)If the answer given by the Court to question (1) is in the\n\naffirmative, what are tlie principal grounds upon which the\n\nGeneral Assembly coiild lawfully exercise such a right ?\"\n\nIn the view of the United States Government, the argument that the\n\nAssembly has no right to review the awards, and must automatically\n\npay them, cannot be sustained. \\\\le think the Asseinbly has not only\n\nthe right, but the duty as well; to examine requests for appropriations,\n\nand has the right to refuse appropriations to pay awards of the Admin-\n\nistrative Tribunal in those cases where it belieres tliat the relevant\n\nconsiderations so require. \\\\'e think the grounds to support such action\n\nare found in the Charter provisions defining the budgetary and regula-\n\ntory responsibilities of the t\\ssembly, its relationship to subsidiaryorgans\n\nsuch as the Administrative Tribunal, the function of tlie Secretary-\n\nGeneral as the chief administrative officer of the Orzanization, and in\n\nthe Charter pro\\.isions regarding interpretation and jüdicial power.\n\nWhether the General Assemblv should decide, in a riven case, to\n\nrefuse an appropriation must dePend on its judgment of many factors\n\nwhich are proper for the Assembly's consideration. The weighing of\n\nthese factors adds up to n judgment of a legislative character, to be\n\nmade by the highest United Nations body in which al1 Members are\n\nrepresented. The Charter basis and limitations of Assembly action\n\ncan and should be stated as a matter of law. The reasons and motivations\n\nof Assembly decision to vote or refuse an appropriation in a particular\n\nsituation are othenvise to be left to the judgment of thc Assembly, as\n\nthe United Xations orgaii with immediate responsibility in the matter.\n\n1 will state briefly the propositions for which we shall contend in\n\nthe course of argument.\n\nFirst, the questions put to this Court by the General Assembly are\n\nlegal questions, concerniiig the Assembly's right and power to vote\n\nfunds, or to refuse to vote them. The questions do not relate to policy\n\nconsiderations of what the Assembly should or should not do.\n\n2. The Charter reqiiires n two-thirds vote of the General Assembly\n\nbefore United Nations funds can be spent. Article 17 requires that ail\n\nexpenditure be co~zsideredby the Assembly. ,The Assembly cannot be\n\ncompeiled to make an automatic appropriation without consideration\n\nand deliberate approval.\n\n3.The General Assembly has not voted any appropriation to pay\n\nthe Tribunal's awards, either in advance or alter they were made.\n\n4. There is no basis in the Charter for any delegation by the General\n\nAssembly, to any other body, of the Assembly's duty to examine and\n\npass upon all requests for funds. In fact, the Assembly has not sought\n\n-in the Staff Regulations or the Statute of the Administrative Tribu-\n\nnal-to make any sucli delegation of responsibility.\n\n5. The Administrative Tribunal is a subsidiary organ of the General\n\nAssembly under the Charter. The Tribunal's judgments cannot bind the\n\nAssembly nor can their status be superior to that of authoritative\n\nexpressions by this Court, whicli is the principal judickil organ of theUnited Nations, on matters referred to the Court by the Assembly.\n\nEven in such cases the Court's opinions are advisory only.\n\n6. The one precedent, bearin upon the relationship of the Assembly\n\nto the Tribunal and staff mem%ersin the matter of awards, is to the\n\neffect that the Assembly may refuse to give effect to Tribunal awards.\n\nSuch was the decision of the League of Nations in 1946.\n\n7. The contract between a staff member and the United Nations\n\nSecretariat may not infringe the Charter responsibility and powers\n\nof such principal organs as the Secretary-General and the General\n\nAssembly. The Secretary-General is the chief administrative officer,\n\nThe terms of a staff member's contract are siibject to these responsi-.\n\nbilities and powers.\n\non a staff member by the General Assembly. He has no vested or acquired\n\nright to this resort, and the Assembly may abolish the Tribunal.\n\nSimilarly, he has no vested or acquired right to any award given by the\n\nTribunal during a period when the Assembly permits such resort.\n\nAwards. of necessitv. remain subiect to the Charter Dowersof ~rincii~al\n\nUnited Nations orians.\n\ng. In discharge of its Charter responsibilities for the United Nations\n\nbudget,and for the control of its suhsidiary organs, the GeneralAssemhly\n\nmay examine any award rendered hy the Administrative Tribunal, and\n\nmay refuse to give it effect on aiiy Charter grounds. Thus, it might do\n\nso on grounds relating to the criteria set forth in Article 101, para-\n\ngrnph 3,for selection of staff, on financial grounds, on groundsrelating to\n\nthe proper functioning of the Tribunal, among others. The considerations\n\nand reasons leading the Assembly to pay an award or to refuse payment,\n\non auy grounds, are not questions of law but of policy ; they are as\n\nbroad and varied as are the bases for action by any legislative body.\n\nLet us now turn to a detailed consicleration of these propositions.\n\nThe questions which the General Assembly addressed to this Court\n\nare strictly legal in character and intentionally limited in scope. They\n\nand tlie Statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal. Articlens,\n\n96 of the Charter excludes policy questions from reference for advisory\n\nopinion.\n\nThese considerations were recognized by the United Kingdom when,\n\nin introducine the draft resolution Drovidine for reference to this Court.\n\nto the kraft-r/solution, proposed by France and desi&ed to submit\n\nto this Court the merits of the awards and commit the Assembly to the\n\nresult, were rejected. Written Statements 178-79.\n\nTlius, the Gcneral Assembly did not intend to shift its responsibilities\n\nto this Court. It souglit advice, ;iiid only legal advice, on its own legal\n\nautliority with respect to Tribunal awards. It did not ask what it should\n\ndecide as to payment. Nor did it make any advance provision to pay\n\nthe awards. It considered and rejected proposais to such ends. It simply\n\nasked if it had the right to refuse effect to awards on any grounds at\n\nall, and, ifso, on what principal grounds. STATEMENT BY m. PHLEGER (U.S.A.)-IO VI 54 311\n\n\"Kight\", in the context of a question addressed to this Court, must\n\nmean legal right. This is emphasized in the United Kingdom Written\n\nStatement, where it is said :\"The questions before the Court are solely\n\nquestions of law.\" Written Statements 103. M'hen we.speak of the right\n\npower, and its exercise in a fashion consistent with the authority and\n\nresponsibility of the Assembly under the Charter.\n\n\\Ve do not mean moral, or ethical, or political right. Such matters\n\nare, in tlieir nature, not properly the subject of a request for an advisory\n\nopinion. They are to be weighed and decided by the responsible political\n\nbody, here the General Assembly, which we must assume will give due\n\nweight to al1 such considerations in the discharge of its responsibility\n\nunder the Charter.\n\nQuestion two speaks of the \"principal grounds\" upon which the\n\nAssembly could la~~fwllryefuse to give effect to an award of the Tribunal.\n\nThe presencc of the word \"lawfully\" is sigiiificant. It emphasizes again\n\nthat the questions suhmitted are legalincharacter and that the \"grouiids\"\n\nfor refusal involve questions of power, and not of ethics or mornls.\n\n\\IThat are the \"principal grounds\" ? Does the question ask this Court\n\nto declare what in the applicable law, and basically in the Charter,\n\nbears upon the Assembly's right to tliscuss and decide ? Does it ask,\n\nwhat are the relevant provisions and what is their legal meaning ?\n\n\\f7e think the Court is asked these questioris.\n\nBut is this Court asked to declare how the Assembly shall weigh\n\nits lawful concerns in the light of given or hypothetical fact? The last\n\nquestion, we submit, must be put aside, since it would not be this\n\nCourt's rôle to anticipate Assembly policy or to substitute this Court's\n\njudgment for the political judgment of another principal organ of the\n\nUnited Nations in deciding amongst lawful alternatives.\n\nTlic United Kingdom is correct iii saying of the two questions asked\n\nthe Court: \"these two questions are closely related to one aiiother\".\n\nWrilten Stntements 102.The truth is, that the \"principal grounds\" are\n\nthe legal reasons why an affirmative ariswer must be given to question\n\none.

They are the principal legaln-\n\nbases of Assembly authority,and the principal legal provisions governing\n\nits esercise.\n\nMr. President. what is the authority and the responsibility of the\n\nGeneral Assembly under the Charter?\n\nThe questions submitted raise issues concerning the nature and\n\nconstitutional structure of the United Nations.

An individual's rirhts under a contract with a private person,\n\ncorporation, or national g&ernment are determined- according to\n\nmunicipal law made by the sovereign. In this case, however, rights and\n\nobligations must be determined in accordance with the disposition of a\n\ntreaty entered into by sixty sovereigns-the Charter of the United\n\nXations.\n\nIn the United Xations Organization, power is not centralized in one\n\norgan, as it is in theegislature of Great Britain or France, for esample.\n\nThe commitments which may be undertaken by, and enforced against.
