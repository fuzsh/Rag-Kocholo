A recent study published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has shown promising results in improving mental health service accessibility and efficiency through AI-based interventions. Over several months, the study demonstrated significant reductions in administrative workloads and enhanced patient engagement and support. The AI system proved efficient in improving the patient experience and also freeing up clinician time, allowing them to focus more on direct patient care. However, such technology cannot replace human connection and intervention, especially in an area as delicate as mental health. Just like in #Surgery, integrating AI into mental health care highlights the need for balanced approaches that combine technological advancements with the human touch. Technology is not a replacement for surgeons and medical staff, but rather an extension that helps #CareGivers in the goal of providing safe #PatientCare.
