Work Done ● Quality Management System ● Bootstrap v3.3.1 > v3.3.7 ● Dark Mode ● Support Enhancement and Service Level Agreements\n\n117. Bootstrap v3.3.1 > v3.3.7 ● Switched to compiling Bootstrap from Leaner Style Sheets (.less) unlike using Cascading Style Sheets (.css). ● Not much of a difference but it’ll be handy for customization and defining sizes. ● Now bootstrap is not bundled in desk.css but as a standalone css file.\n\n118. Dark Mode ● Dark UI for desk finally! ● Merged maximum of the css files into desk css and not applying multiple css files. ● Also use the variables.less file for customization not “style” tag. ● If any further customizations, don’t forget to edit the dark variables file as well.\n\n120. Support Enhancement and Service Level Agreement ● Currently working on the Service Level Agreements enhancement for Support. ● Automated tagging of Issue level. ● Countdown timer for time to respond and resolve.\n\n121. What lies next.. ● Not much work done, hoping to accelerate my work pace. ● Currently looking forward to working in SaaS team. ● Have a few ideas hoping to get it in PoC stage soon as UI IS FINALLY DONE.\n\n123. ★ Reports ○ Defined Contribution Pension Scheme ○ Employee Insurance Policy Deductions ○ ECS format for RBI (Text Report) Enterprise TMC\n\n124.

Frappe Open Day Oct-Nov 2018 Rohit\n\n135. User Permissions Fixed patch by Nabin and Suraj\n\n136. Custom Script Strict Mode On\n\n137. Prepared Report\n\n138. Fixtures & Workflow\n\n139. Filters\n\n140. Vulnerability Issues for Child Table Fake Parent No permissions for child table\n\n141. Added Group by Voucher (Consolidated)\n\n142. Other Fixes • Date between ﬁlters not working for the report. • Dashboard links shows all the data. • Sales analytics report not able to export • Links in the prepared report. • Web form grid view for text editor showing toolbar • Replaced frappe.model.get_value and frappe.client.get_list for single doctype to avoid permissions issue.\n\n143. Other Fixes • Fetch from works after submission of the document • Stock value difference calculation issue for negative inventory with Nabin. • Increased global search data limit. • Added currency ﬁlter in the consolidated ﬁnancial statement report to ﬁx multi-currency issue • Address not set using API • Added disabled ﬁeld in the address form • Company dashboard sales count showing incorrect value. • Tax withholding, tds is applying on the tax amount\n\n144. Contributed Code\n\n145. Operation Team • Testing • Code Review • PR merging • Release • Deploy • Support\n\n146. Thanks :) Coolest thing is client satisfaction not our satisfaction.\n\n148.

Topics ● 3 months at Frappe. ● Work before Conference. ● Work during Conference. ● Work after Conference. ● Current work and Future plans.\n\n166. 3 Months At Frappe ● Successfully adapted this work culture. ● Learned a lot from the senior members. ● Biggest learning curve, yet ;) ● Great exposure (where else does a fresher get to interact with clients from multiple countries). ● Excelled at BombSquad.\n\n167. Work Before Conference ● Was a member of FrappeJS team. ● Made Data-Import in Frappe Accounting. ● Did FrappeJS and Frappe Accounting Documentation. ● Sat with Faris for some minor bug fixes. ● Productivity was less as I was still learning JS and what we had to do in Accounting was still unclear.\n\n170. Documentation: FrappeJS\n\n172. Work During Conference: ● Was part of the Live Streaming team. ● Went to the venue one day before for testing. ● These 2 days were the most stressful days, each day came with a new set of problems. The master audio was not working the first day, net fibre cable broke the other day, camera setup was a pain, our mics were not working as the batteries were left inside after the last conference, have to run to the control area every time to adjust lighting, the list goes on and on……... ● All things considered, did a decent job if not excellent. ● Slept like a baby the day after :)\n\n173. Work After Conference ● Went to the Dark side with Ameya i.e Switched to team DevOps. ● The first thing that Ameya did on my laptop was ‘sudo apt install vim’ (installing vim). ● Shadowed him for a week and learned all the basic essentials required (basically learning vim). ● For another 1-2 weeks, stuck in the vicious cycle of release and deploy.\n\n174. Executing Bench Commands Remotely CLI command: bench remote COMMAND [OPTION] Parameters: command: The command to be executed on the remote instance Returns: Prints the ansible output Examples: - bench remote update --server 'frappe.erpnext.com' - bench remote setup requirements --server 'frappe.erpnext.com' - bench remote build --server 'frappe.erpnext.com' - bench remote migrate --site 'frappe.io' --server 'frappe.erpnext.com'\n\n175. Support Issues Support Issues that required: ● migration of sites from v10 to v11. ● Setting up a test instance. ● One of the issue was the ssl certification was not getting completed as the customer has set up a load balancer on a single server which was blocking the packets. The first thought that came to my mind was ->\n\n176. Current Work And Future Plans ● Currently working with chinmay on frappe-bot which will create a test instance on a server for a PR when you type ‘@frappe-bot create test instance py2/3’. ● Attending wednesday training sessions as there’s so much to learn about the product. ● Completing the Release and Deploy to-do list which goes on till the end of december. ● Keeping a log of the daily work done.\n\n178. Open Day Conference to Now, 2018\n\n180. Academy & LMS\n\n182. Proﬁle Page\n\n183. Improvements\n\n184. In the works Topic Level Separation Inside Course Test Cases Review by Team Pull Request\n\n186. Designs\n\n187. Afﬁnity Designer\n\n188. Side Project - Website\n\n189. Reading\n\n191. Cancelled It\n\n194. Bye! !\n\n197. Permission Issues ! User permission structure was not import friendly ! Required tracking of doctype name changes ! “If owner” permission override was not working as expected ! User permission was not contextual ! Users were not able to figure out the reason of restriction\n\n198. Permission Issues ! User permission structure was not import friendly ! Required tracking of doctype name changes ! “If owner” permission override was not working as expected ! User was not able to figure out the reason of restriction Solution ! https://github.com/frappe/frappe/pull/6397\n\n199. Social Improvements\n\n201. Post transition and delete option\n\n202. Other Improvements ! Enabled keep-alive feature to avoid unwanted network calls ! Post/Comment permission fixes\n\n205. Shortcut Popover\n\n206. Shortcut Popover\n\n210. Random features\n\n211. Searchable function\n\n212. Searchable function\n\n213. Open a site from terminal\n\n214. Open a site from terminal OR\n\n215. Got myself a kindle\n\n217. surajshetty3416 Thanks!\n\n219. Fixes… Preserve Naming Series while deleting in bulk. Timeline date fix [minor - showed “invalid date”] Option to route form to success link added in webform. Duplicate row below a selected row in grid table. Delete Events if its reference doc is deleted.\n\n220. Fixes… GST reports not showing data in their fields. Setup wizard silently failing because of taxes_setup file. Scan Barcode field added in transaction DocType. Display ‘Discount Amount’ in print without taxes table. TDS calculation fix - taxes calculated before net_total was set\n\n221. Android & IOS\n\n222. Salvaging code from Frappekt anko Top based login Oath based Generating ui from meta Kotlin coroutines Android specific approach\n\n223. Hurdles No proper guide or tutorials yet to achieve significant feat. khttp, retrofit, etc known kotlin libraries for http request are android specific Abstracting the code to be shared without knowledge of swift.\n\n224. Hurdles Maps API that is common for both else separate implementation for android & iOS? Mapbox yet to try. Ktor supposedly should solve the problem doesn’t have good guidelines to achieve multiplatform-ness\n\n225. What I did most of the time… ! Reading… a lot of blogs and documentation regarding kotlin. Reverse Engineering demo apps that were built using Kotlin/Native Reading and learning Swift - pretty similar to kotlin from a glance view. Has lot of syntactic difference though.\n\n226. Achievement Nothing major, a simple android app (not platform independent code) that can log in to frappe. A map view to see our current location. Note:- Leaflet could be used for map but via web view. Manipulating markers or highlighting path will need work\n\n227. Awakening Writing code in Python and Javascript is 100x more enjoyable and gives back fruitful result soon than developing mobile app. Updating and matching kotlin version and gradle and android sdk for my pie - to download stuff and install it."
