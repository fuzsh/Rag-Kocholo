All of this happened before Polkit authentication was even started.\n\nThe dnf5 library code does not check whether non-root users control the directory in question.\n\nOn one hand, this poses a Denial-of-Service attack vector by making the daemonoperate on a blocking file (e.g. named FIFO special file) or a very large file\n\nthat causes an out-of-memory situation (e.g. /dev/zero). On the other hand, this can be used to let the daemon process privileged files like /etc/shadow.\n\nThe file in question is parsed as an INI file. Error diagnostics resulting from parsing privileged files could cause information leaks, if these diagnostics\n\nare accessible to unprivileged users. In the case of libdnf5, no such user accessible diagnostics should exist, though.\n\nAlso, a local attacker can place a valid repository configuration file in this directory. This configuration file allows to specify\n\na plethora of additional configuration options. This makes various additional code paths in libdnf5 accessible to the attacker.\n\n8.8https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2746CVE-2024-23473The SolarWinds Access Rights Manager was found to contain a hard-coded credential authentication bypass vulnerability.

Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.8.3https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34347CVE-2024-31475There is an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the Central Communications service accessed by PAPI (Aruba's access point management protocol).

Nodes can publish activations transactions (ATXs) which reference the incorrect previous ATX of the Smesher that created the ATX. ATXs are expected to form a single chain from the newest to the first ATX ever published by an identity. Allowing Smeshers to reference an earlier (but not the latest) ATX as previous breaks this protocol rule and can serve as an attack vector where Nodes are rewarded for holding their PoST data for less than one epoch but still being eligible for rewards. This vulnerability is fixed in go-spacemesh 1.5.2-hotfix1 and Spacemesh API 1.37.1.8.2https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34360CVE-2024-30259FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves malformed `RTPS` packet, heap buffer overflow occurs on the subscriber. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.\n\n8.2https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30259CVE-2024-30258FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves a malformed `RTPS` packet, the subscriber crashes when creating `pthread`. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.\n\n8.2https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30258CVE-2020-26312Dotmesh is a git-like command-line interface for capturing, organizing and sharing application states. In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may\n\nenable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the\n\ndesignated target folder. The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball’s parent directory, contrary to the routine’s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.\n\n8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26312CVE-2024-32004Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, an attacker can prepare a local repository in such a way that, when cloned, will execute arbitrary code during the operation. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32004CVE-2024-30020Windows Cryptographic Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-30020CVE-2024-28165\n\nSAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform is vulnerable to stored XSS allowing an attacker to manipulate a parameter in the Opendocument URL which could lead to high impact on Confidentiality and Integrity of the application\n\n8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28165CVE-2024-4441The XML Sitemap & Google News plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 5.4.8 via the 'feed' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4441CVE-2024-34345The CycloneDX JavaScript library contains the core functionality of OWASP CycloneDX for JavaScript. In 6.7.0, XML External entity injections were possible, when running the provided XML Validator on arbitrary input. This issue was fixed in version 6.7.1.8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34345CVE-2024-32655Npgsql is the .NET data provider for PostgreSQL. The `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large. This causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message. Attackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.0.14, 4.1.13, 5.0.18, 6.0.11, 7.0.7, and 8.0.3.8.1https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32655CVE-2024-31459Cacti provides an operational monitoring and fault management framework.

Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.\n\nThis vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`.

The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34707CVE-2024-34559Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in Ghost Foundation Ghost.This issue affects Ghost: from n/a through 1.4.0.\n\n7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34559CVE-2024-34351Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34351CVE-2024-34350Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34350CVE-2024-32992Insufficient verification vulnerability in the baseband module\n\nImpact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will affect availability.7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32992CVE-2024-32991Permission verification vulnerability in the wpa_supplicant module\n\nImpact: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will affect availability.7.5https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32991CVE-2024-32739A sql injection vulnerability exists in CyberPower PowerPanel Enterprise prior to v2.8.3.

The `org.rpm.dnf.v0.SessionManager.open_session` method takes a key/value map of configuration entries. A sub-entry in this map, placed under the \"config\" key, is another key/value map. The configuration values found in it will be forwarded as configuration overrides to the `libdnf5::Base` configuration.\n\nPractically all libdnf5 configuration aspects can be influenced here. Already when opening the session via D-Bus, the libdnf5 will be initialized using these override configuration values. There is no sanity checking of the content of this \"config\" map, which is untrusted data.

The Git project recommends to avoid working in untrusted repositories, and instead to clone it first with `git clone --no-local` to obtain a clean copy. Git has specific protections to make that a safe operation even with an untrusted source repository, but vulnerabilities allow those protections to be bypassed. In the context of cloning local repositories owned by other users, this vulnerability has been covered in CVE-2024-32004. But there are circumstances where the fixes for CVE-2024-32004 are not enough: For example, when obtaining a `.zip` file containing a full copy of a Git repository, it should not be trusted by default to be safe, as e.g. hooks could be configured to run within the context of that repository. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4. As a workaround, avoid using Git in repositories that have been obtained via archives from untrusted sources.7.3https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32465CVE-2024-34077MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).7.3https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34077CVE-2024-31954An issue was discovered in the installer in Samsung Portable SSD for T5 1.6.10 on Windows.
