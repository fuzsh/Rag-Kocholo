Whenever two foils are to be utilized, these must be assembled in opposite sides of the disk.\n\nthe multi-metallic foil technology is based on a sequence of four different operations; three cold metal forming stages (preforming, rimming and coining) and one intermediate annealing treatment.\n\nthe metal forming sequence starts with the preforming operation.\n\nThis operation utilizes one flat die in conjunction with a special purpose die in order to produce an intermediate disk geometry having, in one of the sides, a considerably high distance from the table (lower floor surface of a coin with uniform level from which the volumes of the relieves grow) to the surface of the rim ( Figure 3).\n\nthe preforming operation transforms the blank into an intermediate non-symmetrical disk having a near-flat surface in one of the sides and a high rim on the opposite side.\n\nthe second metal forming stage is the rimming operation in which the preformed disk is bent along its diameter in order to generate a suitable profile for subsequent assembly with the foil ( Figure 4). Close dimensional tolerances are required as the final diameter reduction does not exceed approximately 1 %. Sharp fillets at the rim to table corner are preferable to round corners with concave curvatures. The rimming operation is crucial for the overall success of the coining process.\n\nthe third metal forming stage is the coining operation in which the two parts are assembled by locking the foil (1) into the rimmed edge of the disk (2), during the imprint of the surface details ( Figure 6).\n\nThis operation requires the foil to be previously positioned on the surface of the disk.\n\nthe clearance between the foil and the rimmed edge of the disk must be comprised within the range 1 %-3% of the initial diameter of the blank.\n\nthe multi-metallic foil technology can be applied to all the metals and metal alloys currently utilized in the production of coins and medals. Proper selection of the metals to be used require the combination of technical and aesthetical criteria.\n\nthe multi-metallic foil technology is an alternative to conventional bi-metallic ring technology utilized worldwide, as well as to galvanized surface treatments that can also induce bi-color effects on a monometallic disk.\n\nMulti-metallic foil technology allows the coining of gold-silver specimens with larger diameters and lower costs than those that would arise from the utilization of monometallic gold blanks. Therefore, it presents a unique opportunity for minting gold with large diameters without increasing the final cost of the product. As a consequent this technology opens new market opportunities for brilliant uncirculated coins and proof coins as well as for medals.\n\nLandscapes\n\nAdornments (AREA)\n\nTesting Of Coins (AREA)\n\nForging (AREA)\n\nPinball Game Machines (AREA)\n\nEP97901854A 1996-02-09 1997-02-10 Systeme a feuilles polymetalliques pour la frappe de medailles et de pieces de monnaie en deux ou trois couleurs Expired - Lifetime EP0822905B1 (fr)\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (4)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title PT101828A PT101828B (pt) 1996-02-09 1996-02-09 Processo de fabrico de moedas ou medalhas lamelares bi tricolores e respectivos especimes PT10182896 1996-02-09 PCT/PT1997/000002 WO1997028973A1 (fr) 1996-02-09 1997-02-10 Systeme a feuilles polymetalliques pour la frappe de medailles et de pieces de monnaie en deux ou trois couleurs US09/638,988 US6722012B1 (en) 1996-02-09 2000-08-15 Minting process for producing a two color coin or medal\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date EP0822905A1 true EP0822905A1 (fr) 1998-02-11 EP0822905B1 EP0822905B1 (fr) 1999-12-08\n\nFamily\n\nID=32737790\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date EP97901854A Expired - Lifetime EP0822905B1 (fr) 1996-02-09 1997-02-10 Systeme a feuilles polymetalliques pour la frappe de medailles et de pieces de monnaie en deux ou trois couleurs\n\nCountry Status (10)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US6722012B1 (fr) EP (1) EP0822905B1 (fr) AT (1) ATE187397T1 (fr) CA (1) CA2222096C (fr) DE (1) DE69700899T2 (fr) DK (1) DK0822905T3 (fr) ES (1) ES2143297T3 (fr) GR (1) GR3032908T3 (fr) PT (1) PT101828B (fr) WO (1) WO1997028973A1 (fr)\n\nFamilies Citing this family (6)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title ES1034280Y (es) * 1996-05-30 1997-05-01 Grupo Promer Mon Graphic Sa Nueva ficha para juegos de sociedad.
