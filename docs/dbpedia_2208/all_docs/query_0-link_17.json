        "text": "Charlie Chan’s Family\n\nas Seen in the Movies\n\nIn the early Warner Oland movies—“Charlie Chan Carries On,” “The Black Camel,” “Charlie Chan’s Chance,” “Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case,” and “Charlie Chan’s Courage”—Charlie Chan’s family accurately reflects what the novels describe.\n\nEarl Derr Biggers had stipulated that the movies (and other media including stage plays and radio dramatizations) follow his writing. At the time, the film studios lacked permission to create original stories.\n\nBut when Biggers died of a heart attack, his widow—the former Eleanor Ladd—granted permission to create original stories—and, boy, are we ever grateful that she did!\n\nThe first original story—\"Charlie Chan in London”—shows Charlie in his hotel room reviewing a photograph showing his family: Charlie, his wife, and about eleven children are in the photograph. Then Charlie replaces this photo on the bureau and picks up a picture of the most recent addition to the Chan family, an infant.\n\n“Charlie Chan in Paris” introduces Keye Luke as Charlie’s number one son Lee:\n\nLee (Keye Luke) doesn’t appear in the next film, “Charlie Chan in Egypt,” but Charlie refers to him when he says, “As son Lee would say, ‘You telling me?’ ”\n\nBut Lee returns in the following film, “Charlie Chan in Shanghai.” When he sees Lee, Charlie says, “Joy equals astonishment at seeing offspring in Shanghai.”\n\nLee is very active in this film, and the chemistry between Charlie (Warner Oland) and Lee (Keye Luke) is strong. Charlie praises Lee:\n\nWhen Lee dives down a flight of stairs to tackle an enemy, Charlie says, “Very proud of athletic offspring.”\n\nLee doesn’t appear in the next film, “Charlie Chan’s Secret.” However, Charlie mentions him more than once. In one place, Chan says, “As son Lee would say, ‘Play hunch.’ ” Elsewhere, he says, “As son Lee would say, ‘Okey dokey.’ Let us go.”\n\nLee is in every one of the remaining Warner Oland films, and a number of Chan’s other children are introduced to us. Children who are not his own also admire him and enjoy his company. For example, in “Charlie Chan in Shanghai” Chan is on an ocean liner. A group of children are gathered around him while he sings, “Long the journey, hard the way. But his heart was gay.”\n\nAs the films continue, just as Charlie had quoted Lee in “Charlie Chan in Egypt” and “Charlie Chan’s Secret,” his children quote Charlie in many films.\n\nIn “Charlie Chan at the Olympics,” Lee inattentively and carelessly walks into Betty—an Olympic athlete and teammate of his. Lee says, “As my Pop would say, ‘Man who stretch neck looking up very apt to break neck falling down,’ or something like that.”\n\nIn “Charlie Chan at Treasure Island,” Jimmy says, “As Pop would put it, ‘Swelled head gives owner more trouble than indigestion.’ ”\n\nCharlie’s Number One Son\n\nBut who is Charlie Chan’s number one son really? In the books and the early films he is named Henry. In the lost “Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case” he is named Oswald. And starting with “Charlie Chan in Paris” we know him as Lee.\n\nFor an interesting and clever solution to this apparent contradiction, see The Charlie Chan Family Home -- The Family Room: Charlie Chan's Multitudinous Family. Other discrepancies among the films are also explored on the page I just linked to, and a more detailed and robust investigation of Chan’s family is discussed than I can give here. Inconsistencies, such as the size of the Chan family (for example, a film may show that Chan has more children in an earlier film while a later film may show that Chan seems to have fewer children) are investigated methodically.\n\nAlso there are occasional identifications of who is the number two (or number three) son or daughter. We tend to overlook such discrepancies because the films are entertaining and we are absorbed in the story.\n\nHere is a short list of some of the children:\n\nLing—identified as Chan’s number one daughter in “The Black Camel.”\n\nIris—Charlie Chan’s number two daughter according to “Charlie Chan in the Secret Service.”\n\nFrances—Charlie’s daughter—“Black Magic” (aka “Meeting at Midnight”).\n\nJimmy—Charlie’s number two son (“Charlie Chan in Honolulu”).\n\nTommy (aka as “Thomas”—Chan’s number three son—“Charlie Chan in Honolulu,” “Charlie Chan in the Secret Service,” “The Chinese Cat,” and more.\n\nEddie (aka “Edward”)—Charlie’s number four son.\n\nWillie—“Charlie Chan’s Murder Cruise.”\n\nBarry—Charlie’s youngest child—appeared in multiple episodes in the television series “The New Adventures of Charlie Chan,” starring J. Carrol Naish.\n\nCharlie, His Wife, and His Family at the Circus\n\n“Charlie Chan at the Circus” introduces Charlie’s entire family. As Charlie and his wife, led by their children, line up to enter the circus through a turnstile, a ticket taker counts each member of his family:\n\nInteractions among Charlie Chan and his children continued to appear throughout the series—not only those which featured Warner Oland but with subsequent actors Sydney Toler and Roland Winters. Examples include the following.\n\nCharlie Chan often compliments his children\n\nObviously, Charlie Chan is proud of his offspring, as the following examples show:\n\nChan: “Increasing wisdom of number one son give much pleasure to humble father.” (“The Sky Dragon”)\n\nChan: “Yes. Ha! With patience and perseverance, number one son might just make detective. . . .” (“The Sky Dragon”)\n\nChan [to his daughter Frances]: “You work lights very well. For helping me illuminate dark mystery, I now make you junior member of the Firm.” (“Meeting at Midnight”)\n\n“Meeting at Midnight”\n\nReferences to Charlie Disciplining His Children When They were Young\n\n“Charlie Chan at the Race Track”\n\nCharlie enters his hotel room. Lee, his back to Charlie, is bending over drying his hair with a towel. Charlie smacks Lee’s butt. Lee jumps, turns to face his father, and removes the towel:\n\n“Charlie Chan in Panama”\n\n“Charlie Chan at the Olympics”\n\nLee says,: “Don’t worry, Pop. I learned to sprint when you used to chase me through the water with a paddle.”\n\n“Charlie Chan’s Murder Cruise”\n\nCharlie’s son Willie has gotten poor grades in school. Rather than telling his father, Willie attempts to hide the letter that the school sent to inform Willie’s parents. But, of course, Charlie has already read the letter and proposes to discipline Willie for lying.\n\nCharlie says, “Please assume proper position across parent’s knee.”\n\nWillie goes across Charlie’s knee but, fortunately for Willie, Inspector Duff of Scotland Yard enters Charlie’s office to visit him, interrupting the spanking about to be administered. Willie escapes the punishment unscathed.\n\nCharlie Sometimes Criticizes his Children\n\nSometimes Charlie makes a comment to one of his children that seems condescending, such as when they are puzzling through clues. He seems critical of their fledgling, as-yet-amateurish attempts to offer a solution to a case. Chan’s criticisms may reflect his personal sense of humor as well as his frustration at their well-intentioned interference.\n\nCharlie is a patient man, but there are times that try one’s patience, such as in scenes like the following.\n\n“Meeting at Midnight”\n\nCharlie’s daughter Frances says, “You know, Pop. I got an idea about this Bonner case.”\n\nChan responds, “Water on brain now leaking, huh?”\n\n“Charlie Chan in the Secret Service”\n\nCharlie responds to son Tommy’s offer to help:\n\n“The Chinese Cat”\n\nChan says to Tommy, “Your assistance about as welcome as water in a leaking ship.”\n\nSometimes Chan gives disparaging, meant-to-be witty remarks to his children, such as when he refers to them as feeble minded or stupid. This sometimes occurs when introducing them to a third party.\n\nAgain, this may be a sign of Chan’s sense of humor. But it may also reflect a sense of his frustration when the children are overeager to follow a false lead too hastily.\n\n“The Scarlet Clue”\n\nChan says, “This is number three son, Tommy. And this one is second assistant, Birmingham Brown. Both at times often feebleminded.” (“The Scarlet Clue”)\n\n“Docks of New Orleans”\n\n“The Jade Mask”\n\nChan says, “My boy, if silence is golden, you are bankrupt.”\n\nExpensive College Education versus Playing Hooky\n\nCharlie is particularly annoyed when he is paying for his college-age children to be educated but they play hooky.\n\n“Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum”\n\nA larger-than-life “mechanical man” (i.e., a robot) was sometimes a featured attraction at arcades. These may tell your fortune or challenge you to play chess or checkers.\n\nAs depicted in this film, the robot was activated by a human who would climb into the device. When Jimmy experiments by disappearing into the robot, his father discovers him and says, “Will please explain presence of one dummy inside another dummy.”\n\n“Dark Alibi”\n\nTommy says, “Pop, we have been thinking.”\n\nChan replies, “Most impossible.”\n\n“Murder Over New York”\n\nChan: “Number two son promising detective. Promise very much; deliver very little.”\n\n“Dark Alibi”\n\nChan: “Son Tommy is noisy woodpecker on family tree.”\n\n“The Shanghai Cobra”\n\nTommy says, “Pop. I want to talk to you as man to man.”\n\nChan responds, “I am ready but you still have few years to go.”\n\n“The Red Dragon”\n\nTommy: “You know what I think, Pop?”\n\nChan: “Number three son is thinking. Uh, most unusual, but does not assist police.”\n\n“Charlie Chan’s Murder Cruise”\n\nJimmy says, “But I tell you, Pop. . . ”\n\nChan responds, “Correction, please. Pop tell you. Offspring return to footwork. Parent take care of headwork.”\n\n“Expensive American Education”\n\nA common frustration that Charlie has with his kids is that they often skip school to help him investigate cases. Chan articulates this in scenes including the following:\n\n“Charlie Chan at Treasure Island”\n\n“Charlie Chan in Panama”\n\nChan’s children (some of whom have become college age) occasionally embarrass Charlie when they use slang. Charlie’s son Jimmy reacts to a convoluted theory when he says, “Sounds awfully screwy to me.”\n\nChan remarks, “Son’s grammar result of expensive American education.”\n\n“Charlie Chan in Rio”\n\n“The Chinese Cat”\n\n“The Chinese Cat” displays another example of Charlie’s frustration:\n\n“The Jade Mask”\n\nWhen Charlie’s Number Four son Edward enters a scene with Birmingham Brown, Edward says, “Greetings, Father.”\n\nChan says, “I am right. It is mistake. Intruder is number four son Edward, who stop becoming college student to become social problem. Also, his assistant, Birmingham Brown.”\n\n“The Chinese Cat”\n\nCharlie refers to Tommy when he says to Leah, “This Mr. Chan is number three son, Tommy, who should be at University of California but who, for some strange reason, now out on parole.”\n\nChan Speaks Lovingly of His Wife\n\n“Charlie Chan at the Opera”\n\nCharlie’s son Lee asks for his allowance money because he wants to buy flowers for a young woman he likes.\n\nCharlie says, “Puppy love very expensive pastime.”\n\nLee says, “Aw, gee, Pop. We’re leaving tonight. And this is, well, sort of a farewell present. She’s a lovely girl — she’s —”\n\nChan completes Lee’s sentence: “Graceful as bamboo shoot; beautiful as blossom of water lily.”\n\n“Yeah! That’s her,” says Lee. “When did you meet her?”\n\nChan: “Never. But long time ago use same description for honorable mother.”\n\n“Dead Men Tell”\n\nWhen Chan intends to interview a woman, Jimmy asks, “Why, Pop! Have you got a girlfriend waiting for you upstairs?”\n\nChan replies, “Only girlfriend is honorable wife in Honolulu.”\n\nSlang Used by Chan’s Children\n\n“Charlie Chan in Rio”\n\nThe use of slang by Charlie’s children frustrates him and shows the generation gap between them. “Charlie Chan in Rio” includes the following comic scene:\n\n“Charlie Chan in the Secret Service”\n\n“Charlie Chan in the Secret Service” includes another comic scene that shows several of his children using slang:\n\nBy this time in the series we have been introduced to Charlie Chan’s number one son, Lee, Number Two son, Jimmy, and Number Three son, Tommy, as well as other children of his. In “The Jade Mask,” we are introduced to Charlie’s Number Four son, Edward (who Charlie calls “Eddie”). Chan’s “Number Four son,” Edward is the intellectual member of the Chan family.\n\nWhen Charlie is trying to close a suitcase that is overfull, he sits on it in an attempt to latch it—unsuccessfully. Calling “Eddie” to help:\n\n“Charlie Chan in the Secret Service”\n\nOne of the most endearing features of the Charlie Chan movies is the relationship Charlie has with his family. This makes the films memorable. We enjoy them so much that we tend to overlook minor discrepancies or inconsistencies, such as the number of children in the family from one film to another, if a later movie shows fewer children than a previous movie did, or whether a child is introduced as “number two [or three]” son or daughter inconsistently among the films.\n\nCharlie Chan is a devoted father and an honorable family man. And we love him for that.\n\nFor more information about Charlie Chan, click on the links below to read articles.\n\nThe Novels by Earl Derr Biggers:\n\nThe House Without a Key\n\nThe Chinese Parrot\n\nBehind That Curtain\n\nThe Black Camel\n\nCharlie Chan Carries On\n\nKeeper of the Keys\n\nCharlie Chan Movies\n\nThe Early Charlie Chan Films\n\nEnter Warner Oland: \"Charlie Chan Carries On\" and \"Eran Trece\"\n\n\"The Black Camel\" and Three Lost Charlie Chan Movies\n\nCharlie Chan's Aphorisms and Sayings\n\nCharlie Chan's Family as Described in the Books\n\nCharlie Chan's Family as Seen in the Movies\n\nCharlie Chan's Travels\n\nCharlie Chan Pastiches\n\nDeath, I Said by John L.
