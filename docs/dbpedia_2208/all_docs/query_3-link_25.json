        "meta_description": "Warner Oland. Actor: Charlie Chan in Shanghai. Warner Oland was born Johan Verner Olund in the small village of Nyby in Bjurholm parish in the county of Vasterbotten, Sweden, on October 3, 1879. Bjurholm is situated about 60 kilometers outside the town of Umea. His family emigrated to the US on October 15, 1892. His father Jonas was a shopkeeper and his mother was Maria Johanna (nee Forsberg).\n\nAfter finishing grade...",

        "text": "Soon after his last film, another Chan entry titled Charlie Chan in Monte Carlo (1937), which was completed in the fall of 1937, Oland began experiencing symptoms of dementia. He was apprehended walking outside his neighborhood in his underwear in the company of his prized miniature schnauzer completely disoriented. He returned to Sweden and sadly, Oland died the following August after a brief bout with pneumonia.\n\nBuried in Southborough Rural Cemetery, Southborough, Massachusetts. His gravestone, a rough oval, was made from one of the steps of his beloved home in this town.\n\nAccording to co-star Keye Luke Oland didn't need make-up when he played Charlie Chan; all he would do is curl down his mustache and curl up his eyebrows. In fact, the Chinese often mistook him for one of their own countrymen. He attributed this to the fact that his Russian grandmother was of Mongolian descent.\n\nAfter almost 15 years in silent films, he had one of the starring roles in \"Don Juan\" (1926), the first film with synchronized sound. He also had a starring role in the \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), the first \"talkie.\".\n\nOf the sixteen Charlie Chan films he starred in, four of the earliest (Charlie Chan Carrie's On, Charlie Chan's Chance, Charlie Chan's Greatest Case and Charlie Chan's Courage) are believed to be lost.\n\nHe developed a close friendship with Keye Luke who was playing his son Lee (aka \"number one son\"). Their genuine affection for each other aided the on-screen chemistry in their father and son roles.\n\nDied August 6, 1938 in Stockholm just two days after the death of Pearl White, his former co-star in \"The Fatal Ring.\".\n\nHe and his wife, Edith, were instrumental in translating the works of playwright August Strindberg into English. Their translation of some of these plays was published in book form in 1912.\n\nAs a choice for playing Charlie Chan, the rotund and almost six-foot Oland was quite unlike a Chinese gentleman of that generation. (His replacement in the series, Sidney Toler, was even taller.).\n\nOland played his first Oriental role in \"Patria,\" when the Japanese actor playing the villain proved too short for star Irene Castle, and the six foot Oland was hired to fill the role.\n\nMoved to Connecticut with his parents from his native Sweden when he was thirteen. Three years later he left to join Curry's Dramatic School in Boston."
