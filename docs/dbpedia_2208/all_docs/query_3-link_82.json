        "text": "In Gosford Park, Bob Balaban plays Morris Weissman, a Hollywood producer whose specialty is Charlie Chan movies. (A Golden Raspberry Award goes to reader Everard Smith who caught me in a slip of the keyboard; I don't know why, but in my review, I typed in \"Charlie Chaplin movies.\")\n\nIt was an apt and clever touch for a clever and surprisingly authentic movie. The Charlie Chan series from 20th Century Fox was in its heyday in the mid-1930s, about the time of that fatal English dinner party.\n\nMoreover, Charlie was a peripatetic detective. Although employed by the Honolulu Police Department (and rising through the ranks, over the years, from sergeant to inspector), he spent a remarkable amount of time out of town at exotic places - New York, Rio, Egypt, Panama, Monte Carlo, Shanghai and even Treasure Island.\n\nMore than 50 Charlie Chan mysteries were filmed between 1926 and 1948, and they ranked as one of Hollywood's most durable franchises - the great-granddaddy, without a doubt, of dozens of eccentric TV sleuths and their comical hangers-on.\n\nIn its heyday, the series drew some of the studios' best character actors for guest spots: Boris Karloff, Leo G. Carroll, Lionel Atwill, Cesar Romero.\n\nNow, slowly, some of the best of the old Charlie Chan movies are coming out on video from CBS/Fox and MGM/UA. A few titles pop up from time to time on the rotation on Turner Classic Movies or American Movie Classics (although none are scheduled this month, apparently.)\n\nA devoted coterie of fans swap trivia and gossip on their own Web site, www.charliechan.net.\n\nCharlie was the offspring of pulp writer Earl Derr Biggers. On a Hawaiian vacation in 1919, Mr. Biggers had been fascinated by local tales about a real-life Chinese-American detective, Chang Apana. Filing away the details, he recycled them for the first of many Charlie Chan novels, The House Without a Key, published in 1925.\n\nAn adaptation followed within a year and the sequels rolled on regularly thereafter.\n\nCharlie never quite mastered English - in scripts, he routinely omitted \"a,\" \"an\" and \"the\" - but armed with his own brand of Confucian wisdom (which he frequently quoted), he had little trouble unraveling the most convoluted criminal plots.\n\nIn fact, none of the actors who played him was Chinese.\n\nThe original Charlie, Warner Oland (1879-1938),was born in Nyby, Sweden. Immigrating to America in 1892, he went on stage (reportedly at the urging of the actress Anna Nazimova) and earned a reputation as a scholarly actor who translated dramas by the Swedish playwright August Strindberg.\n\nHeading to Hollywood, the heavyset Mr. Oland found himself typecast as a villain and, for some reason, as an Oriental. He appeared opposite Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express, with Greta Garbo in The Painted Veil, in the original Werewolf of London (1935) and in several installments as Sax Rohmer's Chinese villain, Dr. Fu Manchu. He earned a permanent footnote in film history, playing Al Jolson's father in The Jazz Singer.\n\nRather like David Suchet's version of Hercule Poirot, Mr. Oland managed to make his detective mildly humorous, highly dignified and formidable all at once.\n\nComic relief was provided by various members of Inspector Chan's enormous family.\n\nHis original sidekick was Lee Chan, always addressed by his father as \"Number One Son.\" Played by Keye Luke (1904-1991), Number One was a stereotypical teen-ager of his period, somewhat like Henry Aldrich. Although he spoke perfect (if colloquial) English, he was always full of impractical schemes and had to be rescued from scrapes in almost every picture by his exasperated dad.\n\nMr. Oland died suddenly in 1938 of bronchial pneumonia, and his role was taken over by Sidney Toler (1874-1947), a veteran character actor who hailed from the mysterious and inscrutable state of Missouri. Noah Beery and Leo Carillo (\"Pancho\" from The Cisco Kid) both took screen tests for the role but were turned down.\n\nKeye Luke (who would end a long and distinguished career as one of the Shaolin masters on TV's Kung Fu) became an occasional guest player on the series, and regular sidekick duties shifted to Victor Sen Yung (1915-1980) as Jimmy Chan, alias \"Number Two Son.\" (Mr. Sen Yung would later draw a new generation of fans as Hop Sing on TV's Bonanza.)\n\nProduction of Charlie Chan movies was shut down soon after Pearl Harbor, and in 1942, Fox sold the movie rights to the dinky Monogram studio. Monogram resumed the series after the war with increasingly low-budget \"B\" pictures, but the spark had gone out.\n\nAfter Mr. Toler's death, Charlie Chan would be played for a few films by Robert Woods (1904-1989), who would go on to play Elvis Presley's dad in Blue Hawaii.\n\nBy the 1960s, the Chinese detective was denounced as a racist stereotype for his pidgin English and his oversized family. Keye Luke defended the concept, explaining that the Inspector was a brilliant man who thought in Mandarin but had to communicate in English.\n\nThe Monogram features were marred by the addition of Birmingham Brown, a stereotyped wide-eyed, easily scared black taxi driver, played by Mantan Moreland. (Mr. Moreland would survive to an era when black actors could gain more dignified roles; before his death in 1973, he appeared in Godfrey Cambridge's satire Watermelon Man.\n\nPeter Ustinov, who found later-day success as Hercule Poirot, tried to revive the series in Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981). The comedy fell flat and would be utterly forgettable except for an appearance by an ingenue named Michelle Pfeiffer.\n\nJ. Carroll Naish took the title role in a short-lived syndicated TV Charlie Chan series, produced in 1958. Keye Luke supplied the voice of Charlie Chan for a Hanna-Barbera cartoon series from 1972, The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan, which also featured young Jodie Foster as the voice of Anne Chan.\n\nBen Steelman: 343-2208 or ben.steelman@wilmingtonstar.com."
