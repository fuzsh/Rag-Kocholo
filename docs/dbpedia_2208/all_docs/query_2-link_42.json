        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nJohan Verner Ölund was born 140 years ago in the village of Nyby, Bjurholm Municipality, Västerbotten County, Sweden (that's way up north). He claimed that his vaguely Asian appearance was due to possessing some Mongolian ancestry, though his known ancestry contains no indication that this was so and could be a Hollywood publicity stunt. That non-Asians or Orientals was portrayed by other nationalities was a normal procedure once (we can't change the past, but we can change the future), especially if the parts were big (there was a few exceptions, like Sessue Hayakawa and Anna May Wong). Today Oland is mostly remembered for his portrayal of detective Charlie Chan in a very successful film serial.\n\nWhen he was 13, his family emigrated to the United States in November 1892 on board the S/S Thingvalla, which sailed from Christiania (Oslo), Norway to New York. After an initial stay in New York City, the family settled in New Britain, Connecticut, and also changed their name to the more anglified Oland.\n\nEducated in Boston, Oland spoke English and his native Swedish, and eventually translated some of the plays of August Strindberg, with Strindberg's permission (a letter has been found where Strindberg gladly writes that he wouldn't mind having his plays translated to English, Copywright laws and worries were a bit different back then).\n\nAs a young man he pursued a career in theater, at first working on set design while developing his skills as a dramatic actor. In 1906, he was signed to tour the country with the troupe led by actress Alla Nazimova.\n\nThe following year he met and married the playwright and portrait painter Edith Gardener Shearn. Shearn made an ideal partner for Oland. She mastered Swedish, helping him with the translation of Strindberg's works that they jointly published in book form in 1912.\n\nAfter several years in theater, including appearances on Broadway as Warner Oland, in 1912 he made his silent film debut in Pilgrim's Progress, a film based on the John Bunyan novel. As a result of his training as a Shakespearean actor and his easy adoption of a sinister look, he was much in demand as a villain and in ethnic roles.\n\nOland's movie debut in Pilgrim's Progress 1912\n\nA Swedish film fans magazine in the 1920s was surpriced when interviewing Oland that he could speak fluent Swedish, when published wrote in big sensationalistic letters \"HOLLYWOOD'S FAVORITE VILLAIN IS SWEDISH!\", over their article that became much bigger than originally planned.\n\nOver the next 15 years, he appeared in more than 30 films, including a major role in The Jazz Singer 1927, one of the first talkies produced, though Oland only utters one word in sound.\n\nOland's normal appearance fit the Hollywood expectation of caricatured Asianness of the time, despite his having no proven Asian ethnic background. Oland portrayed a variety of Asian characters in several movies before being offered the leading role in the 1929 film, The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu. It was the first onscreen portrayal of the Fu Manchu character in film.\n\nA box office success, The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu made Oland a star, and during the next two years he portrayed the evil Dr. Fu Manchu in three more films (although the second one was purely a cameo appearance). Firmly locked into such roles, he was cast as Charlie Chan in the international detective mystery film Charlie Chan Carries On 1931.\n\nOland was the first actor to play a werewolf in a major Hollywood film, biting the protagonist, played by Henry Hull, in Werewolf of London 1935. Once again, Oland's character was Asian.\n\nThe enormous worldwide box office success of his Charlie Chan film led to more, with Oland starring in 16 Chan films in total. The series, Jill Lepore later wrote, \"kept Fox afloat\" during the 1930s, while earning Oland $40,000 per movie. Oland took his role seriously, studying the Chinese language and calligraphy.\n\nDespite his wealth and success, Oland suffered from alcoholism that severely affected his health and his 30-year marriage. In January 1938, he started filming Charlie Chan at the Ringside. However, a week into shooting, his erratic behavior culminated in his walking off the set, causing the film to be abandoned. After a spell in the hospital, he signed a new three-picture deal with Fox to continue playing Chan. At the same time, he was involved in a bitter divorce from his wife which prevented him, by court order, from traveling overseas and moving his assets abroad. He was also soon involved in a public incident when, having ordered his chauffeur to drive him to Mexico, he was observed during a rest stop sitting on the running board of his car throwing his shoes at onlookers. The divorce settlement, favoring his wife, was announced to the media on April 2, 1938, and the same day he left the USA by ship, turning up in southern Europe, then proceeding to his native Sweden where he stayed with an architect friend.\n\nIn Sweden, Oland contracted bronchial pneumonia, worsened by the apparent onset of emphysema from years of heavy cigarette smoking and he died in a hospital in Stockholm. Oland's last film was the unfinished Charlie Chan at the Ringside. Fox reshot Oland's scenes with Peter Lorre and released the finished picture as Mr. Moto's Gamble 1938 (another serial).\n\nOland died in August 1938, aged only 59. That summer he had travelled to his birthplace and stayed there for a few days. A few weeks before his death he appeared at a lookalike contest at a nightclub in Stockholm.\n\nThe Third Eye 1920, a 15-part movie serial. Where he is shot to death early, or is he?\n\nSince the serial is lost, we can't find out.\n\nEast is West 1922 lantern slide.\n\nDon Q, Son of Zorro 1925, as the Archduke in the middle. A Douglas Fairbanks vehicle.\n\nThe Jazz Singer 1927, as Al Jolson's father The Cantor.\n\nGood Time Charlie 1927 lobby card, as Good Time Charley Keene.\n\nThe Mysterious Dr Fu Manchu 1929.\n\nDishonored 1931, as Colonel von Hindau, with Marlene Dietrich.\n\nCharlie Chan Carries On 1931 lobby card. It is the very first appearance of Warner Oland as Charlie Chan.\n\nIt is now considered a lost film, however, Fox simultaneously filmed a Spanish-language version which was released under the title Eran Trece, and this version survives.\n\nBulldog Drummod Strikes Back 1934, as Prince Achmed, with Ronald Colman as the titled Bulldog that strikes back.\n\nWerewolf of London 1935, as Dr Yogami, with Henry Hull, who's been bitten.\n\nCharlie Chan at the Opera 1936, with Boris Karloff. The 13th of the Oland-Chan movies, and considered by many to be the best with Oland.\n\nMaybe due to the presence of Boris Karloff as the principal suspect, as well as faux operatic music composed by Oscar Levant.\n\nOland developed a close friendship with Keye Luke who was playing his son Lee (aka \"number one son\"). Their genuine affection for each other aided the on-screen chemistry in their father and son roles.\n\nCharlie Chan at Monte Carlo 1937, became Oland's final completed film.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nThoughts, ideas, oppinions, lists, favorits or/and anything Warner Oland is very very welcome!"
