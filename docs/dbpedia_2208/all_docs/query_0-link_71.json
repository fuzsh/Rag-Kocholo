Vintage Photo Still (8\" X 10\").\n\nWarner Oland's third excursion as the Chinese detective, this early talkie features a plot in which Chan himself was the intended victim of a murder, but escaped, while another man was killed. He has to fend off the inquiries of both Scotland Yard and the New York police while he tracks down the killer. Unique in the series as being the only Chan film to have the involvement of creator Earl Derr Biggers (credited with \"added suggestions\"), this is a lost film, much to the chagrin of many Chan enthusiasts.
