        "text": "Prime Minister of Spain Primer ministro de españa Coat of arms of the Spanish State Nation Spain Style Mr/Madame Prime Minister Type Head of Government Reports To Cortes Generales Appointer President Term Length Indefinite Formation February 12, 1873 (first iteration)\n\nJanuary 20, 1921 (second iteration)\n\nJune 11, 1940 (third iteration)\n\nJune 9, 1973 (fourth iteration) First Holder Estanislao Figueras\n\nThe Prime Minister of Spain is a position in the Spanish government which has existed on several different occasions between 1873 and 1980 under a variety of different names. Despite the different names and offices held in the period, all offices serving as a separate head of government position are retrospectively considered to be the same office.\n\nThe office of prime minister was first established in February 1873 as the position of Chairman of the Provisional Republican Government, which was vested in Estanislao Figueras by the Cortes Generales to compliment his role as president of the executive power, the Republic of Spain's initial de-facto head of state; in 1875, the role briefly evolved into the Chairman of the Constitutional Government before being merged into the office of President of the Republic of Spain with the inauguration of Francesc Pi i Margall as president in June 1875.\n\nIn January 1921, the office was revived as the position of Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers under the new Federal Republic of Spain. This iteration of the office of prime minister was intended to be the head of government and constitutionally the most powerful office within the country, though this became de-facto ambiguous under Antonio Maura's premiership as President Manuel Allendesalazar wielded significant power over the government and Cortes Generales. However, between 1930 and 1931, the office of Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers was unambiguously the most powerful role in government under Allendesalazar's premiership, and would remain so under his successors. In November 1940, the armed forces conducted a coup d'état and installed Nationalist party leader Francisco Franco as Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, marking the beginning of a thirty five year dictatorship under Franco; during the first 17 years of his rule, Franco remained in office as prime minister, before abolishing the office and merging it with the presidency after the death of President José Miaja in 1957.\n\nIn June 1973, with the ailing President Francisco Franco increasingly unable to carry out the duties of his office, the office of prime minister was re-established and granted to Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel in order to run the government. Upon Franco's death in 1975, Rodríguez assumed the presidency but retained the position of prime minister as a separate title. During the transition to democracy, Adolfo Suárez was appointed as prime minister in 1979 by President Rodríguez and presided over the writing of a new republican constitution which abolished the office in June 1980.\n\nList of Prime Ministers\n\nChairman of the Provisional Republican Government Tenure Party Head of State 1 Estanislao Figueras February 12, 1873 February 16, 1875 Independent Estanislao Figueras\n\n(1873 - 1875) 2 years and 4 days Chairman of the Constitutional Government Tenure Party Head of State (1) Estanislao Figueras February 16, 1875 June 11, 1875 Independent Estanislao Figueras\n\n(1873 - 1875) 115 days Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Tenure Party President 2 Eduardo Dato January 20, 1921 March 7, 1921 Conservative Eduardo Dato\n\n(1920 - 1921) 46 days 3 Antonio Maura March 7, 1921 March 8, 1921 Conservative March 8, 1921 June 11, 1921 Antonio Maura\n\n(1921) June 11, 1921 June 11, 1925 Manuel Allendesalazar\n\n(1921 - 1930) June 11, 1925 June 11, 1930 9 years and 96 days 4 Miguel Primo de Rivera June 11, 1930 August 19, 1930 Independent\n\n(Military) Miguel Primo de Rivera\n\n(1930 - 1931) 69 days 5 Manuel Allendesalazar August 19, 1930 December 10, 1931 Conservative December 10, 1931 April 17, 1932 Niceto Alcalá-Zamora\n\n(1931 - 1935) 1 year and 242 days 6 Niceto Alcalá-Zamora April 17, 1932 August 18, 1932 Liberal Republican 123 days 7 Diego Martínez Barrio August 18, 1932 June 11, 1935 Republican Union June 11, 1935 June 11, 1940 Diego Martínez Barrio\n\n(1940) June 11, 1940 October 23, 1940 Manuel Azaña\n\n(1940) October 23, 1940 November 19, 1940 Diego Martínez Barrio\n\n(1940) 8 years and 93 days 8 Francisco Franco November 19, 1940 October 1, 1957 Nationalist José Miaja\n\n(1940 - 1957) 16 years and 316 days Prime Minister Tenure Party President 8 Alejandro Rodríguez June 9, 1973 November 20, 1975 Nationalist Francisco Franco\n\n(1957 - 1975) November 20, 1975 June 11, 1979 Alejandro Rodríguez\n\n(1975 - 1980) 6 years and 2 days 9 Adolfo Suárez June 11, 1979 June 11, 1980 Union for\n\nDemocratic Centre 1 year and 0 days\n\nTimeline"
