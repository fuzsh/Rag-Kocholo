        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nJosé Antonio Primo de Rivera and His People\n\nFascism and the Desire to Exceed His Father\n\nJosé Antonio Primo de Rivera y Sáenz de Heredia (1903–1936) was known as José by his family and friends, and as José Antonio by his colleagues in the Fascist party he founded, the Falange Española. At the party’s inception, the members decided to copy Italy’s Partito Nazionale Facscista (National Fascist Party—PNF) and address one another informally in their internal dealings. This decision was quite revolutionary for 1930s Spain and aimed to show that at the heart of the organization was a desire to create a new political society that was at once anti-Democratic, anti-leftist, and anti-separatist but also anti-Conservative. The idea was to remove unequal social treatment within the party, which was quite a novelty, but not the internal chain of command, which was of the extremely inflexible paramilitary type and, of course, unequal. This was an unexpected combination in right-wing organizations in general but not in the extreme left wing. Also unexpected was the emergence of a Fascist party in Spain at the end of 1933.\n\nBefore this time, Fascism had only been present in the form of factions that managed to gather just a few hundred supporters. One was the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (Councils of the National Syndicalist Offensive—JONS), led by Ramiro Ledesma Ramos and Onésimo Redondo Ortega, who had previously founded two even smaller groups that the JONS subsequently subsumed: La Conquista del Estado (founded in February 1931), which also published a weekly magazine of the same name, and the Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica (Castilian Groups of Hispanic Action),¹ set up in August 1931. Although the latter group had experienced a slight increase in popularity, among university students in particular, in 1933 after Hitler’s rise to power in Germany and played an active part in such dramatic events as the attack on the Association of Friends of Russia and the robbery of its files, it was little more than a marginal group funded by anti-Republican Alfonsist monarchists who were interested in inciting as much of this sort of unrest as possible.\n\nThe Falange would be the most important of all the Fascist parties, even though it was marginal in terms of numbers until the spring of 1936. In this respect, it was quite unlike the Fascist parties of other European countries and simply incomparable with the Fascists in Italy and Germany, who had managed to seize power and create the only Fascist regimes in the world. One of the three initial leaders of the Falange, presented in public on 29 October 1933, was no less than the firstborn son of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, the Spanish dictator from 1923 to 1930. Like all Fascist parties, the Falange was founded with the ambition of conquering the state; ending democracy, left-wing revolutionary threats, and non-Spanish Nationalist movements (particularly in Catalonia and the Basque Country); and, of course, constructing a new Fascist state.\n\nBut what exactly did this involve? And what was the difference between the aims of Fascism and the political objectives of the right-wing parties when the Falange came into being? The right-wing forces—the extreme Comunión Tradicionalista (Traditionalist Communion) and Renovación Española (Spanish Renewal), and the somewhat more moderate Acción Popular (Popular Action), which was the backbone of the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights—CEDA)—all aspired to wipe out left-wing parties, end democracy (i.e., the Spanish Republic), and set up an authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regime in its place. Two of these groups’ members were monarchists: the Traditionalist Communion consisted of Carlists (supporters of the dissident Bourbon branch who opposed the dynasty of Isabella II), and the Spanish Renewal of Alfonsists (supporters of Isabella’s descendants, the last of whom had been Alfonso XIII). They had both been acting clandestinely to bring down the Republican regime and to this end had set up paramilitary militias: the Carlist Requetés and the Alfonsist militias. Of course, they also acted legally, taking part in elections and sending deputies to the Republican parliament.\n\nHowever, the dynastic issue—the two branches of the House of Bourbon—was not the only point on which the two groups disagreed. Their models of monarchy were also quite distinct. The Carlists believed in absolutism: that a king had a divine right to the throne and that Spain should go back to the model of the Ancien Régime, with its class-based parliaments, guilds, and autonomous councils. For their part, the Alfonsists were fighting for an authoritarian monarchy, a strong government (dictatorial or semi-dictatorial), and the definitive withdrawal of the Constitution of 1876, which would mean the end of Liberalism. Because both groups rejected democracy and Liberalism, they managed to get along to a much greater extent than would have been possible just fifty years earlier, after the end of the third of the civil wars—the Carlist Wars—in which they had clashed.\n\nPopular Action—the right-wing group with the most voters, deputies, and members—also clearly opposed the Republic and its constitution. It was a Catholic and confessional party, but unlike the other two parties, which sought the complete destruction of the Republican regime and thus deserve the label of extreme, it merely wanted the regime to be more authoritarian and to follow the social and political doctrine of the Catholic Church. It also advocated a different system of parliamentary representation: the parliament would have a new corporate house in which professions, families, and municipalities, among others, would be represented. Its idea of a republic, then, was quite different from the reforming, left-wing republic that had been created on 14 April 1931. Moreover, although the party was not officially monarchist, many of its leaders, members, and voters were. The fact was that Popular Action, which merged into the CEDA, hoped to fulfill its aims by means of a gradual, electoral strategy that involved accepting the Republican regime—something that the monarchist parties did not approve of at all.\n\nNeither the extreme nor the more moderate right-wingers were Fascists, although the left-wing parties referred to them as such, and there were several fundamental differences between them and the Falange. First, the former were not Fascists, because they believed in the Catholic confessional state. The Falange, on the other hand, wanted a clear separation between the state and the Church even though Catholicism heavily influenced its ideology and political program. Second, two of the right-wing parties were explicitly monarchist. The Falange was not. It made no pronouncement on the form the regime would take, and, over time and through the statements made by its National Leader, it would disassociate itself from the monarchy. Third, the right-wing forces were Conservative—extremely Conservative. They defended the status quo and property at all levels and, with some slight exceptions in minority sections of the CEDA, opposed any form of structural social reforms. The Falange, however, aimed to make some nationalizations—in financial services (i.e., banking) and public services—and implement economic and social reforms, the most important of which was land reform.\n\nAll these policies were anti-capitalist approaches to financial, speculative, and usurious capitalism—in contrast to legitimate productive capitalism—and were, of course, compatible with private property, although not with the abuses perpetrated by owners against the less fortunate classes, who the Falange believed should be delivered from the misery in which they lived (referring specifically to landless peasants and day laborers). By no means did the Falange intend to bring about a left-wing revolution, but it did want to improve the country’s general standard of living and wipe out the enormous pockets of poverty. This Falangist-Fascist revolution was known as the National Syndicalist revolution and aimed to end the class struggle by uniting employers and workers in a new, enormous, vertical syndical structure, under the supervision of the Falange, within which everybody would have a role in working for social justice. So, the Falange, a Fascist party, was differentiated from the rest of the right-wing forces by its (relative) anti-Conservatism.\n\nThere was a fourth difference, which was quite subtle with respect to the far right-wing forces but somewhat less so with respect to the right-wing Popular Action and CEDA: violence and its use as a political weapon. In this respect, the difference between the Falange and the far right wing (which practiced violence) was almost nonexistent but was quite clear between the Falange and Popular Action. The Falange defended violence as a new form of political struggle in the street. José Antonio regarded this as necessary, humanitarian, crude, and chivalrous and surgical. This violence included squadron missions by the Falange militias to break up left-wing meetings, lay siege to their headquarters, cause confrontations in the streets, and so on. He argued that violence should be used against the left-wing forces because they would not hesitate to use violence against the Falange. The wave of violence led to deaths, injuries, assassination attempts, and, above all, the preparation of coups to conquer the state with forces of their own or with the assistance of the Army, which was also an aim of the far-right monarchist parties.\n\nFifth, the Falange was interested in attracting all the social classes, including peasants and workers, whether or not they had been members of left-wing political groups or syndicates. This desire to unify, or reunify, was fundamental to the Fascist ideology: if the Fascists were to combat the divisions in the political parties that had sprung out of Liberalism and democracy, and the looming shadow of an Asian Communist revolution that threatened to destroy Western civilization, then they had to reunify the whole of Spain in a project that would regenerate the country and make it great again. So, they aimed to unify, reunify, and form a fascio to end the artificial divisions invented by theorists of democracy (e.g., Rousseau), achieve social justice in opposition to the egocentric wealthy classes and the Communist revolutionaries, and lead the country in the quest for further imperial expansion, thus restoring past glories.\n\nThe ultimate objective of all this was for the country to reencounter its essence, its internal flair. At the time, it was in a state of convalescence, but it was still possible to make a full recovery—to fulfill the unity of destiny of the whole population, of all the regions that, when they had worked together, had made Spain a world power, the greatest nation of its time, the nation of Catholic kings and the first years of the House of Hapsburg rule with its European and colonial empire. Unity, however, had come up against the obstacle of the peripheral nationalisms of some regions, the result of the ailing unity of destiny. This obstacle had to be confronted and overcome by offering the inhabitants of these regions new projects and new missions that were Spanish in their conception. National issues were to be given priority, followed by imperial ones. This is what the Falange and its leader promised the country.\n\nThe Falange’s Fascist project, then, was quite different from other right-wing options of the time. This difference was partly because the Falange’s future National Leader, José Antonio, said the party was in neither the left nor the right wing. Indeed, he said it was not even a party but instead an anti-party or a social movement. In general, and with some specific national distinctions, this difference placed his organization and political thought on par with general European Fascism. When José Antonio said, as he did on occasion, he was not a Fascist, he was referring to the term of Italian origin and to the fact that he did not apply the Fascist doctrine as did Mussolini in Italy or Hitler in Germany; he applied it to the reality in Spain. He wrote: Fascism is not just an Italian movement: it is a total, universal sense of life. Italy was the first to apply it. But is not the conception of the state as a permanent historic mission also valid outside Italy? . . . Who can say that only Italians aspire to such things?² At other times, he pointed out differences with Nazism and the totalitarian state. This, however, does not mean he—or, after studying and analyzing his Falange ideology and practices, we—did not believe he was a Fascist, albeit with some slight nuances in his way of thinking (see chap. 4).\n\nOf course, there were differences between the Falange’s Fascism and that of Germany, Italy, and other places in Europe. Racism was one of the most important distinguishing features of German Fascism, while the focus on the individual and Catholicism was a defining feature of Spanish Fascism. However, the similarities were far greater. For this reason, José Antonio, before he decided to launch his party, visited Mussolini in Rome and had an interview with Hitler and the leading Nazi theorist Alfred Rosenberg in Berlin.³ In his heart, he felt closer to Fascism than to Nazism, closer to the Italian than to the German. And although he never explicitly said so and sometimes denied it,⁴ he aspired to be a dictator like these two leaders. He never referred to the role his party would play in the new Fascist state that would have him at the head. He did, however, talk of the natural entities—the family, the municipality, the syndicate—as the pillars of a state he defined as Syndicalist, as opposed to capitalist or Socialist. This was quite consistent with his anti-political party stance, his anti-Democratism. But the fact that he did not refer to the existence of a single party or a social movement after succeeding to power does not mean he had not thought about it. Nevertheless, this lack of reference was subsequently exploited to cast doubts on his Fascism.\n\nJosé Antonio’s ambition was to lead his party, restore national unity, and strive for imperial goals. He was convinced Spain, thanks to him and his Falange, would once again start to move in the same circles as the few nations in the world—like Italy, Germany, and England—with a national and imperial unity of destiny. Another ambition was for the population as a whole to accept the Falangist doctrine. Once the party succeeded to power, as tended to be the case in totalitarian states, the single ideology that governed it would spread to encompass society, family, and the world of employment. This is what Primo aspired to, even though at times he said he wanted to create a totalitarian state and at others cast doubt on the whole concept. Whatever the case, he would be unreservedly adored after October 1934 as the National Leader of the Falange.\n\nHowever, only the party respected him, and this respect was obviously on a much smaller scale than that afforded to the leaders of the only two Fascist regimes at the time, which had even gone so far as to formulate principles such as Il Duce is never wrong and The Fuhrer’s word is law (Führerprinzip). The adoration was real and was felt by many of his comrades, beginning with the intellectuals whom he had managed to attract to his party and who sincerely appreciated and admired him. Of course, it was quite different from the hero worship later accorded to him by the Franco regime—conveniently, when he was dead—which was on a far bigger scale than this first, internal outburst of affection, only surpassed in Spain by the homage paid to Franco—the Caudillo, Generalissimo, and head of state.\n\nLike all other European Fascists, the Falangists had a liking for uniforms (their characteristic blue shirt made of nankeen brought to mind industrial workers—the proletariat—and was an expression of their desire to appeal to working classes and peasants). They also cultivated paramilitary structures and direct action; carefully planned rallies and meetings; the cult of the fallen, who were regarded as combatants and saluted with a rousing Present! whenever their names were called (this was copied from Italian Fascism); the Roman salute (also copied from Italy); symbols such as the yoke and arrows, a visual reflection of the Italian fascio, on the red-and-black flag (in this case, the colors were copied from Anarcho-syndicalism, considered the most national of syndicates, in contrast to Marxist internationalism); and the supposedly revolutionary slogans. This liking for uniforms, salutes, and rallies was by no means the only expression of the militarization of politics in the interwar years and was not exclusive to the Fascists; it was shared with the whole range of right-wing groups and even with the left-wing, Communist, and Socialist parties.\n\nMilitias were not exclusive to the Falange and the Fascists either. Left-wing groups had them, too, but they were for the Falange an expression of the cult of violence required to bring down democracy and the left wing. They were enveloped in an aura of masculine domination that glorified heroism, daring, bravery, and austerity and reserved for women the traditional role of mother and conveyor of the Fascist ideology within the family. Both the Falange and the Fascists viewed the young as a generational force that was fundamental to the political transformation they were striving for. They aimed to combine tradition and modernity—in contrast to the outdated Conservatism and egoism of the wealthy classes—and their aspiration was to subordinate the economy to politics without questioning either the essence or the existence of the capitalist system. Their informal, friendly way of speaking to one another was precisely the expression of an internal camaraderie that was a taste of things to come once they succeeded to power.\n\nJosé Antonio had another reason for encouraging informality, which became the official party line some months after it merged with the JONS. He decided to add Antonio to the name his family used for him (José, never Pepe) because he did not want to be known politically by the surname that was directly associated with his father, a dictator. This does not mean to say, however, that his political project, although more ambitious than his father’s, was not partly a tribute to it. Unlike his father, he wanted to make a clean break with the Liberal-Democratic system and place himself at the head of a regime that would be not only authoritarian and dictatorial but also Fascist. This regime would continually use the party and its militias, syndicates, women’s sections, and youth sections to organize and mobilize Spanish society and make the necessary economic and social reforms so that the country could resist what the Falange believed was the imminent Communist or left-wing revolution. This was how it planned to solve the country’s two great problems: nation and society. This new, reunited Spain, with no fragmenting political parties, would not eliminate class differences but would make them less pronounced, and the country would once again be in a position to play an important role in the world, just like other countries with similar (Fascist) regimes. José Antonio thought that, in this way, he would be able to emulate and, given time, surpass his father.\n\nFormulating his ideology, building up his party, and assuming the leadership would take José Antonio some time—although not too much, as we shall see—and in the process, he would have moments of doubt and hesitation. Later on, in 1936, he seemed to be on the point of renouncing his aspiration to play a central role in the country’s future, particularly when the militias, so fundamental to his party, were dismantled (at the beginning of the Civil War, when he was in Alicante prison). This raised doubts about how firmly he had assumed the role of Fascist leader and even suggested the existence of two José Antonios. Whatever the case, the dominant José Antonio acted to satisfy his desire to create an alternative Fascist party, to become its one and only leader, and to rule the country as head of state—all out of a deep-seated need to emulate and outdo his father.\n\nAll the above suggests that the political figure of José Antonio cannot be understood without his father’s influence. Although the father (and/or mother) figure always affects the personality of offspring, by no means do all children identify with their parents to the extent that José Antonio did. Neither do they feel such deep desires to emulate and surpass them. In fact, the opposite is quite often the case when children do not identify with their parents, or even actively reject them. Even when their instinct is to emulate, this does not mean they wish to reproduce, copy, or imitate all aspects of their paternal and maternal figures. And if they wish to show their superiority, then the difference is ensured. José Antonio wanted to be superior to his father in two aspects that I believe are crucial: a messianic nature (i.e., a desire to save the mother country—and to save it himself), and an intention to impose an authoritarian political program. In many respects, his personal political plans were different from those of his father, but they did share these two characteristics.\n\nThe young José Antonio had inherited his father’s messianism, which in the General’s case had culminated in nothing less than his becoming a dictator, the paradigm of the maximum possible concentration of political power in a single person. Primo de Rivera was convinced he had been entrusted with a personal mission and that he was simply doing his duty (i.e., he was ambitious). This sense of duty prompted him to lead a military uprising that aimed to take power by threatening to mobilize troops and displace the legitimate, constitutional authority. The uprising, which in the event required no actual mobilization, was successful: he succeeded to power in forty-eight hours and remained there for just over six years. And in both quantitative and qualitative terms, the power he held was enormous. For José Antonio, matching, and then surpassing, his father’s achievements meant not only vindicating his legacy but also pointing out the shortcomings of his political program. And it required him to come up with his own program that was more authoritarian and palingenetic, and designed to create deeper rifts with the immediate past. Had José Antonio managed to gain power through a coup of his own (or with the help of the Army, which would have subsequently ceded all power to him), he no doubt would have created and headed a form of government completely new to Spain: a Fascist regime.\n\nHowever, his hopes would not be realized. Unlike his father, who did manage to gain power and set up a regime, he failed in his attempt. Even so, in terms of his political status and idealized image, if we go by how Francoist Spain hero-worshipped him after his death and for many decades afterward, he did not fail but rather was a resounding success. He was praised, worshipped, lauded, and put on an unimaginable pedestal by the new Franco regime and the Falange. Thus, José Antonio, an object of such postmortem adoration, would eclipse his father.⁵\n\nJosé Antonio’s siblings did not share his intense identification with his father as a politician or his desire to emulate and eclipse him. The dictator’s second son, Miguel, named after his father and one year younger than José Antonio, took after his father in ways his brother did not: he was kindhearted (but without the General’s clear paternalistic traits), easygoing, highly likeable, and extremely fond of women⁶ (especially if they were of high social status). In fact, among his youthful conquests was Infanta Beatriz⁷ (a daughter of Alfonso XIII), a dalliance that prompted his father to send him to the United States to study economics and art (he was apparently quite passionate about art, particularly sculpture and painting).⁸ Likewise, years after the Civil War had ended, he was forced to resign as ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post he had occupied for seven years, because he had fallen in love with a married English woman whose husband accused him of adultery. He tried to avoid any responsibility by claiming diplomatic immunity. In stark contrast to his elder brother, who was a much better student,⁹ his good looks, charm, manners, and spontaneity seemed to make him irresistible to many women.¹⁰ Nevertheless, he, like his brother, had inherited from his father a certain fondness for using violence to settle personal disputes and defend his ideas, and the brothers were involved in various student skirmishes while studying law at the Central University of Madrid. Afterward, in 1930, they again resorted to force to defend the memory of their recently deceased father.\n\nSo, unlike his father, José Antonio was shy, serious, and somewhat curt. The two men were, in many ways, opposites, much to the admiration of his father, who was convinced this boy will go down in history¹¹ and that he and Fernando (the youngest) were the two highfliers in the family.¹² José Antonio was largely serious, organized, thorough, and hardworking. He demanded a lot of himself. All these character traits came from his mother’s side of the family but were also the outward expression of accepting the role of big brother, reinforced by the loss of his mother at the tender age of five. José Antonio’s seriousness differentiated him from his father, and, once he became the Fascist leader, he deliberately cultivated it, adding a certain amount of pretense to what was a real part of his character. After his death, this is what he was most revered for. As a young man, he had an undeniable urge to be the leader of his siblings and was almost forced into this role by his father, who appointed him as their director.¹³ This must have been his first experience of being in charge, something that was quite common for the eldest child of a family (although not all of them were able to cope with their duties).¹⁴ After his mother’s death, his father’s unmarried sister, María Jesús Primo de Rivera, known to the family as Aunt Ma, had taken over the role of homemaker. In later years, she gave the Primo brothers staunch support during their political adventures.\n\nJosé Antonio may have been passionate—although there are some differences of opinion in this respect,¹⁵ and he made excessive use of the adjective in his writings—but what he exuded above all was control. He needed to exercise considerable self-control because he was prone to violence, sometimes expressed in outbursts, which he could not always restrain, and in the use of irony, which frequently developed into biting sarcasm. Both characteristics must have been his way of letting off steam after all the effort he always made to seem serious and well mannered.¹⁶ Moreover, José Antonio was like all his family: easily excitable. For no reason at all, he was capable of blowing his top, and he could be extremely violent.¹⁷ And all these features of his character were apparently compatible with a personality that was childish, polite, and capable of whiling away a summer evening in San Sebastián laughing and dancing.¹⁸ The politician José María de Areilza recalled that he seemed to live a straightforward life, with lots of plans involving women, and nonstop summer meetings and society celebrations.¹⁹ José Antonio, then, was a hodgepodge of seriousness, pride,²⁰ high standards, thoroughness, anger, aggressiveness, irony, sarcasm, cheerfulness, indifference, friendliness, and shyness. He undoubtedly had a strong character, but he was also attractive, seductive, and charismatic, for at least some of those who knew him.\n\nPerfectionism was one of his most obvious character traits. He applied his desire for perfection to projects, speeches, political and literary texts, and his profession as a lawyer. In this respect, he was quite the opposite of his father, who was undoubtedly more easygoing. This perfectionism involved rigorous work and perseverance, which he demanded of himself and theorized about: Spanish people . . . have the urge to set everything in motion, which is a form of laziness. And laziness may be the muse of many a revolution. Instead of setting everything in motion, you should first set about patiently tying up the loose ends.²¹ One of the more formal results of this perfectionism was his desire for a style expressed in his writings and reinforced by the proximity—and attraction—of writers of archaic prose such as Rafael Sánchez Mazas, José María Alfaro, Agustín de Foxá, Eugenio Montes, and Jacinto Miquelarena. The aim of his literary perfectionism was to make up for his father’s shortcomings in this respect (he did not write at all), and he adopted a style that made many of his and the Falange’s pronouncements frankly incomprehensible to most mortals who were not among the chosen few or ruling minority (including many party members). To sum up, José Antonio applied himself with rigor and perfectionism to design his own political project—the expression of his fervent, ambitious desire to emulate his father—that he would gradually perfect before and after he became leader of the Falange. And although he resoundingly failed in his attempt to gain power, he occasionally proved to be a fine political analyst. Most of his mistakes were made because of his own ideas and obsessions, one of which was his belief that a Communist revolution was imminent.\n\nThe second of his brothers, Fernando, the youngest of the Primo de Rivera y Sáenz de Heredia family and familiarly known as el nene (our kid), was five years younger than José Antonio and the protégé of the three eldest children (José, Miguel, and Carmen). Like José Antonio, he was serious and hardworking, and he had followed in the professional footsteps of his father and a great-uncle, Fernando Primo de Rivera y Sobremonte, the family patriarch and protector of all the Primo children and their father. He became a career soldier, first in the cavalry like his great-uncle and then a pilot. At the beginning of the Second Spanish Republic, however, there was a great deal of hostility toward his father because of the various conflicts with different sections of the Armed Forces (the Artillery in particular) during the dictatorship,²² so he gave up his military career and dedicated himself to medicine. Later, he even worked with Dr. Gregorio Marañón. José Antonio admired Fernando and said he was the best of them all²³ and the bravest one in the family.²⁴\n\nThe two sisters, Carmen and Pilar, were quite different from each other. Carmen, the third born, managed to fulfill her life’s ambition. All she wanted was to be a normal person, which in her case meant getting married and having children.²⁵ She did some work for the Falange but much less than did Pilar, the twin sister of Ángela, who died when she was five years old. Like Fernando, Pilar was taken under the wing of the three eldest. She felt particularly close to José Antonio (and he to her), which was surely why she followed his political career so closely. Fernando did likewise. In the months before the outbreak of the Civil War, he became his brother’s right-hand man and took over the leadership of the party when José Antonio was imprisoned in Alicante. Pilar ended up accepting a post of considerable responsibility during the Franco dictatorship: she was the perennial and only national delegate of the Women’s Section (Sección Femenina) of the regime’s single party, the Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx of the Councils of the National Syndicalist Offensive (FET y de las JONS).²⁶\n\nJosé Antonio, Pilar, and Fernando seemed to have the most Castilian character—more austere, more prone to melancholy and self-absorption—while Miguel and Carmen were more Andalusian, more cheerful, more full of life and laughter.²⁷ They all admired their father, whom they regarded as not only a good man but also an authentic hero. Professionally, José Antonio initially wanted to follow in the footsteps of his father, his uncle Fernando Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja (married to María Cobo de Guzmán and whose sons were like brothers to José Antonio),²⁸ and his great-uncle Fernando, all of whom had had military careers. The last of these men appreciated his seriousness and even started to dictate his memoirs to him on his El Encinar estate in Robledo de Chavela. There, on the outskirts of Madrid, Uncle Fernando taught José and his brothers horseback riding, hunting, and other sports with the sons of the Fernández-Cuesta y Merelo family. One of these boys, Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta, was seven years older than José Antonio and was first a friend and then a comrade in the Falange.\n\nThe stories his great-uncle and father told José Antonio undoubtedly influenced this early vocation for a military career, a vocation that, despite everything, would not become a reality.²⁹ His father saw no reason for his son to join the Armed Forces that had so disappointed him, and apparently he did everything he could to change his mind. Later, in different circumstances, he did not react similarly to the desires of his youngest son, Fernando. Nevertheless, the fact that José Antonio did not embark on a military career does not mean he, as the son, grandson, nephew, and great-nephew of soldiers, did not fully embrace military values or would not apply these values to his Fascist party militia in the future. Apparently, the young José Antonio was finally advised to become a lawyer by his uncle Antón Sáenz de Heredia and Fernández-Cuesta. He also considered becoming an engineer, but Antón—who had already instilled in him an interest for literature and theater, as a homespun reader, writer, and actor—made him opt for a more humanistic profession, in this case, law. There was already a certain family tradition because Antón had worked as a lawyer, and José Antonio’s maternal grandfather had been a judge. After graduating in law, Fernández-Cuesta had taken the examinations for the Armed Forces legal office and then for the profession of notary, which influenced José Antonio. Fernández-Cuesta went on to become his general secretary in the Falange and an executor of his will, and he had a long political career in Franco’s Falange.\n\nDespite opting for a legal career, José Antonio never forgot his frustrated interest—vocation, even—for literature and theater as both an author and actor. According to his cousin Nieves Primo, he wrote a play, La campana de Huesca, as a young man, and in the last few years and months of his life, he wrote the outlines of several novels.³⁰ An educated man, with a strong, sidelined—but always present—literary inclination, he managed to gather around him a group of learned men of letters whom he provided with political leadership. They were in sincere admiration of him for not only the Fascist program he was preparing but also his ideas, culture, and character, all of which made a considerable contribution to the cult of personality that José Antonio as a Fascist leader encouraged within his party. His encounter with these men of letters had been a fortunate one: they were in search of a strong leader and an authoritarian project, and he was fleeing what had happened to his father as a dictator and the opposition of some of the country’s most important and influential intellectuals in an attempt to construct a political project with solid foundations from the intellectual point of view and with the support of other intellectuals. He was not given this support by all those he would have liked (e.g., his much-admired José Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno), but he did manage to gather a solid group, led from the beginning by Sánchez Mazas. He was even supported by some who were not party members (e.g., Eugenio d’Ors, one of the greats of the literary scene). This says a great deal about his ability to attract support, which was obviously increased by the glamour of being his father’s son. More important than who he was, though, was the Fascist political project he was in the process of constructing, which was extremely attractive to many. Some of the men he attracted helped him lay down the lines of the project. There was, then, a mutual interest: some men were looking for a leader, and the leader needed men.\n\nJosé Antonio also took an interest in the aristocracy, to which he believed—with some foundation—he belonged. When he inherited a title in 1930, he wrote texts in defense of the role of the authentic nobility as opposed to empty señoritismo (which only involved playing at being a gentleman). In fact, the family’s somewhat straitened circumstances never allowed him, or his father or uncles before him, to enjoy the leisurely life of the well-to-do families from Jerez or Madrid. For example, the boys and girls in his family wore hand-me-downs from elder brothers and cousins, respectively, because the family could not afford to buy new clothes.³¹ And from the end of his secondary education until his third year of law school, José Antonio had to work to get by. A company that sold North American machinery hired him because his uncle Antón had shares in the company and because he could speak English—thanks to the family nanny—and French.³² After he completed his military service and until he reached the required age to practice law, he remained in the same company. Although he was not a man of leisure, he did live the life of a member of the upper classes during his father’s dictatorship (he was earning a lot of money from his legal practice; he could even be said to have been a member of what today we would call the jet set). Even so, he always had to work.\n\nJosé Antonio completed his primary and secondary studies, as well as the first two years of his law degree at the Central University of Madrid, without attending classes and only turning up for the final exams. He only decided to register as an official university student when he reached his third year. And when he did, he, like many others before and since, started to take an active interest in politics. He became the leader of the Official Association of Law Students, a Liberal body that had been set up in application of the 1919 official decree on university associations issued by Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts César Silió in Prime Minister Antonio Maura’s national government.³³ In response to these official associations, the Asociación de Estudiantes (Association of Catholic Students) set up others that were explicitly confessional and modeled on the ecclesiastical hierarchy and, in particular, on the Jesuits and the National Catholic Association of Apostles of the Faith.³⁴ In late 1920, José Antonio was elected general secretary of his faculty’s association, the president of which was his colleague and friend Ramón Serrano Suñer. At the time, Serrano Suñer’s second surname was written as it is here, but he added an accent (Súñer) to remove all traces of its Catalan origin when he was given a position of power in the Franco dictatorship.³⁵ He was the president of the José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones Section for Catholic Law Students. The fact that Primo and Serrano Suñer were not members of the confessional student organization does not mean they were not Catholics (they were). Rather, they believed the Church should not get involved in professional or student matters and that the separation of the Church and the state should be respected. In later years, Primo stuck to this viewpoint as a member of the Falange, unlike Serrano Suñer, who joined the confessional and Catholic Popular Action and CEDA under the leadership of Gil-Robles. The three of them would meet in 1933 as members of the Republican parliament.\n\nAs a member of the Federal Union of Students, José Antonio was heavily involved in a confrontation with the leader of the official student association of the School of Agricultural Engineering and future opponent of the dictatorship, Antoni María Sbert i Massanet. José Antonio had convinced the Faculty of Law not to support a strike called by the special schools in response to a government decree that awarded officers from the Field Artillery Command and the Engineers Command a degree in civil engineering.³⁶ On this occasion, José Antonio for the first time used violence as a means of political struggle. The events occurred when the Association of Catholic Students attempted to make Thomas the Apostle the patron saint of all the faculties, a proposal that the rector had refused to accept. José Antonio and his brother Miguel played a leading role in defending the right to academic activity on that day in their faculty, and, armed with sticks, they took on the Catholics, led by the Martín-Artajo brothers³⁷ (one of whom would later be a minister under Franco). Years later, when he was working as a lawyer during the dictatorship, José Antonio was involved in another confrontation with the same brothers. This time, after a public examination for the post of professor of commercial law at the University of Madrid, the votes cast by the professors Felipe Clemente de Diego and Felipe Sánchez Román in favor of the candidate Joaquín Garrigues—an Official Association of Law Students member—prompted the Catholics to pelt them with eggs and meringue. Their former students, including José Antonio, rushed to their defense.³⁸\n\nIn the final years of his degree, which he finished in 1922 at the age of nineteen, José Antonio was heavily involved in student politics but also put his heart into his studies. He began to show a preference for civil law, which was taught by the two aforementioned professors, and, to a lesser extent, for criminal law, which was taught by the Socialist Luis Jiménez de Asúa. Despite his hard work, however, he always lagged a bit behind the brilliant Serrano Suñer. At the beginning of José Antonio’s time at university, in 1917 and 1918, his great-uncle Fernando had been minister of war for five months but died in 1921 (the same year his uncle Fernando died at the Battle of Annual), so Primo de Rivera inherited his title of Marquess of Estella, and it became clear that the title would someday be handed down to José Antonio.\n\nAdolescence and early adulthood were important times for José Antonio because, through the influence of his great-uncle Fernando, a minister, he managed to get some work with the government and state administration. Military interventionism (or praetorianism) had declined after the start of the Restoration but had been rising since the first decade of the twentieth century and was rife in Spanish politics at the time. This was the result of not only the Morocco crisis but also the setting up of the so-called defense councils, pseudo-syndicates consisting of Army officers who questioned some aspects of military policy but were always prepared to join forces when the increasingly mobilized left-wing rabbles or the Catalan separatists had to be put in their place. They were tumultuous times. The last years of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the beginning of the first postwar period in Spain were characterized by extreme economic, social, and political conflict. This so-called period of pistolerismo (the practice, used by Spanish employers, of hiring thugs to solve their problems with employees and syndicates) saw workers’ protests, as well as demands for a genuine Democratization of politics, the end to caciquismo and corruption, and, in Catalonia, a statute of autonomy. In the meantime, the monarchy was on the defensive.\n\nDuring these years, José Antonio’s father took the final and decisive steps in his military and political career, which would culminate in his becoming dictator of Spain in September 1923. In 1920, he was elected Conservative senator for Cadiz and promoted to lieutenant general, the highest rank in the Army. As such, he was in a position to be appointed to a captaincy general (i.e., the highest authority of one of the military regions into which the country was divided). He was very soon in charge of the third captaincy general, which was headquartered in Valencia; he was then made responsible for the first (Madrid) and, finally, the fourth (Catalonia), which is where he would initiate his coup. The General and his family found that both Valencia and Barcelona were being rocked by social tensions and terrorist violence perpetrated by anarchist gunmen and thugs in the pay of the employers’ associations. This violence was partly the result of the harsh economic and working reality that was making life extremely difficult for the working classes during and after World War I.\n\nTo combat this wave of pistolerismo and to stand up to the scum, the General opted to take measures of doubtful legality, as he was wont to say in private and as he communicated by letter to Conservative Prime Minister Eduardo Dato. These measures soon led to the infamous Ley de Fugas (a law that allowed prison guards to shoot escaping prisoners and was often abused to cover up what were, essentially, executions). In his letter, the General communicated to Dato that, in response to the terrorist activity and the murder of the Conde de Salvatierra, who had not been replaced, the secretary of the civil government, the colonel of the Civil Guard, and I agreed to take measures that worked wonders because they put an end to all the terrorist attacks.³⁹ He went on to refer to the Ley de Fugas: A raid, a transfer, an escape attempt, a few bullets, and that was the beginning of the solution to the problem. At first, things got worse. It is not pleasant to see cultured cities abandoning themselves to such acts, but there is no other option because ordinary justice and legislation are powerless. What’s more, the savagery of terrorism, which spares no one, is all the justification we need.⁴⁰ None of this met the opposition of the generals, other Army officers, and many Conservatives, but it is significant that Primo de Rivera informed the head of a constitutional government—albeit in a private letter—and that no consequences were to be paid. Nevertheless, and most importantly, the events prompted Primo de Rivera to consider taking extreme political action—a coup or uprising. He subsequently wrote:\n\nI first started to think that I should intervene in Spanish politics in some way other than the usual channels while I was in command as the captain general of Valencia in 1920. There was no need for me to believe I had the ability or the character to change the course of politics in the normal fashion when men of great talent, some of whom were undoubtedly of good faith, had all, one after the other, failed in their attempts to do so.⁴¹\n\nThe root causes underlying this decision to rise up against the established order were problems of public order, the desire to restore authority and bring down the caciques, and the Battle of Annual (aka Disaster of Annual), where the Army had suffered more than ten thousand casualties and the defeat had instilled the nation with a sense of shame. Also important were his opposition to the reforms made by Prime Minister Manuel García Prieto’s Liberal government and the imminence—in September 1923—of the Picasso Report (Expediente Picasso) being submitted to the parliament, drawn up by General Juan Picasso González to investigate the events at Annual. It revealed that the king was largely responsible for encouraging General Manuel Fernández Silvestre’s reckless offensive that had ended in disaster.\n\nThe military disaster had had a seismic effect on Spanish political life and on Primo de Rivera. His younger brother, Fernando, at the head of the light cavalry unit Cazadores de Alcántara no. 14, had died in action at Monte Arruit trying to protect the chaotic, disordered, and pathetic retreat of the officers and soldiers. Many of the former, by the way, had been running faster than the latter, or leaving the scene by car and abandoning the troops and wounded to their fate. In the aftermath, Primo de Rivera had given a speech in the Senate in which he proposed that Spain give up the protectorate. Conservative Minister of War Juan de la Cierva y Peñafiel’s response was to sack him. He would not be out of work for long, however. In 1922, there was a change of government. García Prieto became prime minister, and Primo de Rivera was asked to take command of the fourth military region in Barcelona. One year later, he was back in Madrid after heading the bloodless uprising that would make him Spain’s dictator for more than six years, during which time his family’s intervention in politics would reach new heights.\n\nJosé Antonio, who had recently graduated in law,⁴² did not go with his father to Barcelona. He did spend the summers of 1922 and 1923 there, but he otherwise lived in Madrid, studying for his doctorate and waiting to be old enough to practice law. Because no courses were available in the specialty of civil law, which is what most attracted him, he had to choose others, and he became particularly interested in social politics, taught by Luis de Olariaga.⁴³ However, he did not complete his doctorate: he never got around to writing his dissertation. After he had finished his course, he went to Barcelona to do his military service and, as a one-year volunteer, was allowed to serve as a junior officer. In Barcelona, with his brother Miguel, he joined a cavalry regiment, the Santiago Dragoons, and this is when his father staged his uprising. On its successful completion, José Antonio moved back to Madrid with all the family, after he had requested a transfer⁴⁴ to the Húsares de la Princesa regiment. He finished his military service in 1924 with the rank of second lieutenant."
