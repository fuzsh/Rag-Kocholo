        "text": "Spain Table of Contents\n\nSpain was neutral in World War I, but the Spanish army was constantly engaged from 1909 to 1926 against Abd al Krim's Riff Berbers in Morocco, where Spain had joined France in proclaiming a protectorate. Successive civilian governments in Spain allowed the war to continue, but they refused to supply the army with the means to win it. Spanish losses were heavy to their fierce and skillful enemy, who was equipped with superior weapons. Riots against conscription for the African war spread disorder throughout the country, and opposition to the war was often expressed in church burnings. Officers, who often had served in Morocco, formed juntas to register complaints that were just short of pronunciamientos against wartime inflation, low fixed salaries for the military, alleged civilian corruption, and inadequate and scarce equipment.\n\nConditions in Morocco, increased anarchist and communist terrorism, industrial unrest, and the effects of the postwar economic slump prompted the pronunciamiento that brought a general officer, Miguel Primo de Rivera (in power, 1923-30), into office. His authoritarian regime originally enjoyed wide support in much of the country and had the confidence of the king and the loyalty of the army. The government lacked an ideological foundation, however; its mandate was based on general disillusionment with both the parliamentary government and the extreme partisan politics of the previous period.\n\nOnce in power, Primo de Rivera dissolved parliament and ruled through directorates and the aid of the military until 1930. His regime sponsored public works to curb unemployment. Protectionism and state control of the economy led to a temporary economic recovery. A better led and better supplied army brought the African war to a successful conclusion in 1926.\n\nThe precipitous economic decline in 1930 undercut support for the government from special-interest groups. For seven years, Primo de Rivera remained a man on horseback. He established no new system to replace parliamentary government. Criticism from academics mounted. Bankers expressed disappointment at the state loans that his government had tried to float. An attempt to reform the promotion system cost him the support of the army. This loss of army support caused him to lose the support of the king. Primo de Rivera resigned and died shortly afterward in exile.\n\nHISTORY CONTENTS\n\nIBERIA\n\nHISPANIA\n\nAL ANDALUS\n\nCASTILE AND ARAGON\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE\n\nFerdinand and Isabella\n\nCharles V and Philip II\n\nSpain in Decline\n\nBOURBON SPAIN\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession\n\nThe Enlightenment\n\nThe Napoleonic Era\n\nTHE LIBERAL ASCENDANCY\n\nThe Cadiz Cortes\n\nRule by Pronunciamiento\n\nLiberal Rule\n\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY\n\nThe Cuban Disaster\n\nThe African War\n\nREPUBLICAN SPAIN\n\nTHE SPANISH CIVIL WAR\n\nTHE FRANCO YEARS\n\nFranco's Political System\n\nPolicies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest\n\nForeign Policy under Franco\n\nTHE POST-FRANCO ERA\n\nTransition to Democracy\n\nDisenchantment with UCD Leadership\n\nGrowth of the PSOE\n\nForeign Policy in the Post-Franco Period"
