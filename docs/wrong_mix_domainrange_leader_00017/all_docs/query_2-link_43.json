        "text": "PART ONE\n\nOn Board\n\nthe \"Ramblacita\"\n\n'TIS just as well that you were chained on Olympus and could not see me off, for had you gotten a glimpse of the antiquated \"Ramblacita\" you would surely have taken it into your classic old head to question my judgment and then proceeded to bother.\n\nWhen this one goes to France she always takes a French steamer, just as she takes an Italian boat for Italy. Thus you must understand that I was principle-bound to sometime experience a passage on a trampy steamer, especially when I found one with a disposition properly developed for introducing wanderers from the Peninsula. Now that we are proudly eight days out skimming along at fifteen knots on the smooth sea of reasonable adventure, I can risk telling you that our little craft is a veritable gamine of the deep — a sort of de classe — knowing nothing of the courses and manners of the de luxe millionaire freighters plying the tourist route from New York to Cherbourg and Southampton. This old hull is a boat — she has a hobo soul and having long rendered service to mankind belongs to the world at large. Smudged is she with the oily backwaters of every available port in the north, east, south and west corners of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. I even suspect her of a dark past gathered on the Pacific. True to the traditions of mixed civilizations discovering and exploiting new lands, she is uncontaminated by either European or American modernism. The last time she docked at Manhattan a mutiny actually broke out. If one is to believe printed news, a number of her rogues and rapscallions were placed in chains and for several days sprawled helplessly on the unsheltered upper deck while an old-time sea captain rid himself of spleen and other manifestations of leadership. If I had been the original \"Peter Pickem\" I could not have chosen a more entertaining craft. Yet the passage is not cheap if measured in our standards — But to go back to the hour when I embarked.\n\nYou should have seen my smile grow crooked and almost carry my courage overboard as I realized that this, my very own choice of unknown steamers, was giving evidences of being loaded with human strata of color and type with which I had never had occasion to commune — America as I had never known it. To be ten days enisled in these crowded quarters was too much of a bargain. I wondered if I should not — or should, in Tennessee vernacular, have my luggage \"toted back to de banks.\" Then utterly disgusted with myself for indulging \"insular prejudice,\" I decided to make the best of it. So the fun began right there.\n\nUp in my cabin I had another shock remaining to be survived. When I climbed over an assortment of early Victorian baggage before my door, I bumped into a pretty, white-haired, troubled-faced woman, who stood taking an inventory of my goods. She, too, seemed surprised. On further inquiry we were both convinced that we were not to occupy that space singly and perforce put away our disappointment in a few pressing and mutual housekeeping interests. In other words, these old-fashioned bunks were thoroughly examined and pronounced clean.\n\nSo you may picture me installed — books, boxes, flowers and trunks — in the same compartment with the sister of two Irish-American priests. They, by the way, are comfortably settled on the other side of a partition so thin that as I write in bed one can hear a cheerful rumble of wits which have flare enough even when not unloosed by the virtues of good Scotch. This aroma is a distinct sign that the dinner gong is about to pierce the air. Then for the conversational feast and choosing dishes simple enough to offer to one's digestive members. Yesterday, fasting-Friday, I was amazed to see a thick beefsteak being passed around. It inspired some lively interpretations of certain precepts of the church as understood and practiced on a Latin-American liner. Despite my arguments as humanitarian, as vegetarian, despite all the warning rimes for meat-eaters, and the whys and wherefore of his (Father John's) rheumatism, Father John became incorrigibly human, partaking of the red flesh. Father Leonard remained himself — a true Roman Catholic — and ate of the fishes.\n\nIt seems incredible that one could put to sea from New York and, with the exception of these three persons and an American consul with his wife, be the only English-speaking individual aboard. On the first day, by gravitation natural to races, we formed a group for luncheon, and ere the clanging brasses sounded announcing dinner, Malaga wines and all the queer little surprises in the soup, we had acquired an enchanting addition to our party. It was the Condesa Mont X, a glowing Spaniard from Barcelona, who took a presiding place between the two beneficents of the cloth to shine like the Pope's diamond between two brilliants of Pharaoh's onyx.\n\nThe Condesa sparkles with the most intriguing broken English, speaking it with an accent and energy peculiar to Catalonia. Her eyes are enough to make even a bookworm (like our friend Ralph Roeder) turn to more resolute pursuits. Her repertoire of Spanish dialect songs is endless — and her Latin heart ample enough to mother the world. Yesterday I looked down on the third-class deck to see her embracing in a most affecting manner, a woman draped in a black shawl and mantilla. That was rather surprising to me, having heard so much about the insupportable Spanish sense of class differences.\n\nAt dinner she related to me the joys of finding a personal maid who had served her when she had been happily established in Mexico City. Later, under the unfolding influences of stars and sky, came the Condesa's dramatic story of a parent-planned marriage with a Spanish nobleman at the age of fourteen. \"Ah, Señora,\" she tragically gasped, \"until my husband died, I had never known another man. I did not love him then, but if I had him back to-day, I should worship him like God.\" And she meant it.\n\n'Twould be futile to begin to define the accuracy of this sailing list. Its variations include citizens of Cuba and Indian-Spanish mixtures of Mexico who by consanguinity are tinctured with the Aztecs and probably Coronado's band that went searching into New Mexico for the Seven Cities of Cibola. Many are plain-spoken representatives of Central America, several of whom are German, with perhaps ten pure Castillanos.\n\nAs you know, Latin races hold close to the most natural custom of propagating large families. The jungle in its palmiest spots never produced more active youthful dozens than congregate at certain hours on the promenade where I am now seated. These revelrous arenas are fast becoming a menace to health and sanity. One little fellow has succeeded in breaking an arm during a wrestling match. Another, savagely intent upon imitating the fearlessness of a charging bull, dashed into the steward carrying pots of boiling water for the tea, and is so severely scalded that a hush has fallen upon the little imps, their sires and vituperous mothers.\n\nHaving gained a little understanding — enough to find me in sympathy with nearly everything my sensibilities find within reach, I have been unashamedly watching the antics of a pair of newly-weds. Never outside of Sicily could any female be guarded with more jealous and volcanic attentions. Thank goodness we are spared the scenes de la vie privée!\n\nThe Condesa and I are the only women aboard not traveling under the supervision of husband or priest. All the others are attended by brothers and fathers, or the master of the house and so many of his offspring that individuality has been completely submerged in their troubles and demands. Needless to say, years have vanished from my mental age and I find myself stretching my wings in sheer luxuriousness of freedom, putting away the pangs of frustrated motherhood and counting my cherished born and unborn blessings, even approving the fact that I have not summoned to this flippant planet any replicas with my own capacity for chasing horizons.\n\nLast evening I looked down upon the busy uninviting steerage deck, where many bedraggled women with their men were preparing the sopa (thick soup of meat and vegetables) for themselves and their litters of hopeless young hybrids. Some of them are without doubt taking home goodly savings hard gained in the New West, but most of them could not possibly have found a single nugget in the \"caves of silver\" or \"mines of gold\" — tales of which had lured them from old Spain. In any case they carry themselves happily. \"Mañana\" for them is about to arrive. Then, do they not possess Africa's greatest gift to humanity — the art of natural song? Far into the night their splendid voices break forth into the wailing of wild minors (Malagueñas) of some ancient Andalusian half-Moorish melody, songs of nomadic loves and partings, of ruthless banditti of the Mountains, of faithless señoritas, songs taken into their Arabic natures through generations of sea and desert wanderings.\n\nDuring the day, despite a collection of peace-blasting parrots, they sleep. One asks what their babies have done to be growing into their respective destinies. On the other hand, from such decks have come the moving force of the two mighty Americas, and we see the shape of a race that is being bred of foreign genius like Michael Pupin, who made the long distance telephone possible — Pupin alongside the great artisan, all constructing the age of steel, shafts of light — of spirit and clay, — an intelligible force unfalteringly reaching toward the heavens. But still the old Gods are not dead, as you may see from your Olympian heights.\n\nTo come back from a nap — and to earth again.\n\nI've made myself comfortable (for a nature worshiper) amongst these sisters who pace back and forth counting their pearls in prayer. Priests too are numerous. Some are leading groups from their home parish and all are diligently plucking the outcropping little misdemeanors, piously preparing themselves, as pilgrims must, before entering the holy land. Their ultimate destination is Rome — \"Roma per il anno Santo.\" How I envy them the thrills of gazing out for the first time over the world's greatest and most dramatic stage — Rome, Eternal Rome, the home of the artist's soul. I even find myself wondering what takes me to Spain, when I could return to the city crowned with the glory of the Seven Hills. As the Condesa would add, \"Kindlee explain me zat.\" No, don't, — I know what you would say and that would force a defense which I haven't the courage to begin.\n\nAmong my gift books I found \"All the Way Round\" from A. L. D. by Mrs. Carter H. Harrison. She began it in May, 1921, on the R— when I too happened to be crossing. But pardon me if I have not first thanked you for the sweets and the volumes of letters with the ship's log kept by Christopher Columbus on his first voyage to the West Indies. You who live by exactitudes — \"Justice in the abstract\" — as well as psalms and story, are you cognizant of the fact that Rodrigo de Triana was the first to see and announce \"la tierra\" — for which it is recorded that he received a brand new embroidered silver-buttoned waistcoat?\n\nI found this book a fascinating and informing record, and in consequence was prepared to appreciate the location of the Azores when we passed them off the Isle of Flores. Near this island in the time of Elizabeth the Revenge was anchored with six other British war ships. The Revenge was commanded by Sir Richard Grenville. Upon the appearance of fifty-three Spanish galleons (about all that was left of one hundred and fifty of the original Invincible Armada) Lord Thomas Howard sped away with the six ships, leaving Grenville with his hundred men to charge the enemy. Two or three of the Spanish ships were sunk, and several shattered before Grenville was mortally wounded and the Revenge captured. The Spaniards, amazed at his bravery, gave him all the honors of a military funeral before casting his body into the sea. The Revenge was remanned by the Spaniards and set Spainward only to sail into a storm that sent her down with every man aboard. Sir Walter Raleigh in contemporary documents recounts the courage of this incident — Lord Bacon eulogized — Froude wrote essays — Canon Kingsley brought it into his \"Westward Ho!\" — and Tennyson in his famous ballad honored the glorious Commander of that never-to-be-forgotten age.\n\nFortunately we crept by as the sun rose and I arrived on deck just in time to see the outline of villages before the islands disappeared like fading opals on a lapis sea. Little wonder they were subject to dispute between Spain and Portugal when Columbus saw them, pointing like fingers of hope, as he sailed on to disprove the mariners' songs of that \"region of eternal darkness\" beyond where lay the world's jagged edge.1\n\nI brought with me an old history by David Pryde, M.D., published before Garibaldi had united the parts of Italy into a free kingdom. In a few paragraphs he gives us all the information the more modern writer requires volumes in which to add a compendium to former fragments of this-and-that. In this book we are told that Columbus was born in a house many of us have seen in Genoa.2 He was the son of a wool comber, possibly a Spaniard, and became a sailor and pirate-wise at the early age of fourteen. At thirty-five he was drawing maps in Lisbon, having married Felope Moniz de Perestrello, the daughter of a deceased Portuguese navigator. With the maps of his father-in-law he learned about the attempts made to reach India by doubling the continent of Africa. Then it flashed upon his brain to make a short cut from the western coast of Europe. Two strangely colored men had been washed onto the shores of the Azores, evidently Indian sea rovers from those unknown climes. Thus, accompanied by his little boy, he was inspired to begin his begging from court to court until he accomplished the great ambition in becoming head of an exploring armament for Isabella and Ferdinand of Castile and Aragón.\n\nIt is in the letters of his friend Las Casas that we view the pathetic side of our persevering hero's biography. He died without knowing that he had opened up vistas to other continents having civilizations highly developed by the Aztecs in Mexico and the Incas in Peru. His records prove that he thought that he had reached some lost stretches of land inhabited by savages beyond the known parts of China and India. Having given up all the hoped-for honors and revenues promised to him, shortly before he expired he wrote this sad complaint: \"Little have I profited by twenty years of toils and perils since I do not own a roof in Spain. I have no resort but an inn; and for the most times have not wherewithal to pay my bill.\"\n\nThe year Columbus discovered America, Lorenzo de Medici in Florence died after helping Michael Angelo toward an unparalleled fame. In Milan Ludovico Sforza had recognized the genius of Leonardo da Vinci. Already established as a great painter, but occupied with the principles for a flying machine (principles that are now applied in the flying machines), da Vinci found days for going over the 1499 maps and reports of Columbus, in which Colon stated that the world was shaped like a pear, with a mountain so high that its summit leaned against the lunar sphere \"where lies an earthly paradise.\" But my idea was not to make a treatise on Columbus — even if you do permit me to write to you as I would talk to myself.\n\nOur own captain, a long-legged, mutiny-loving individual, appears to be equal to the \"devil on the plank,\" carrying a perfectly calm but fierce mien over a last year's celluloid collar and giving out atmosphere that scents of Conrad's \"Rover.\" He must have indeed been a trial to his maker, for his head has the set of having been impatiently jammed onto his broad, high, fat shoulders. Being himself is the most conspicuous thing he does. Plainly he is the product of the old sailing vessel, and now that he has a passenger list that includes my sex, he thinks he is always ashore. . . . (I trust that you follow me.) If he ever had pure and tender inclinations they must have been spent in some former existence before he lashed a galley of Roman slaves!\n\nBut I shouldn't be too hard on the old dog. After all, he is of that rare variety which, drunk or sober, feels every variating point in the star of the winds. 'Tis said that he sometimes lists heavily under the hot juices of the vine, — but who minds these indulgences during fair weather? Not I. Besides, 'tis good to live, as Mussolini says, a bit \"dangerously.\" Furthermore, didn't you Gods set the cup before men to lead them carelessly on into godlike endeavors?\n\nAs to our engineer — (always the important fellow) he is quite of another species. This moment he informed me that the Captain is all right, as proved by the fact that the Ramblacita is on time. Yesterday, in rivalry, the Captain vouchsafed the information that if we didn't arrive on schedule it would be because of a stupid engineer — so they agree in fact if not by compliments.\n\nThe Captain said that he would probably take a cargo of freight from Barcelona to Civitavechia. — So you see the Ramblacita is also an opportunist. Adventuresses usually are!\n\nWould you that I sketch in the Purser? Tiens! One glance at him is worth the price of a show on dissipating Broadway. And one look from him is worth about all one aspiring male can sum up or suggest in one swing of an eye. The French would call him a gallant in the true sixteenth-century meaning of the word. His huge, ripe, dark eyes tempt me to flick them off like bulging, over-juicy, wild blackberries! He is without doubt the attraction of the two leathery-finned sharks that have followed us this last hour or more frightening my favorite of deep sea creatures, the racing, rollicking schools of dolphins, and scattering them off to happier fields of mirth. So much and enough of Señor Purser and the sharks!\n\nThe voyage has been a great success, and at last we are coming to the waters of the Mediterranean where ages of history whirl into the brain — waters particularly swept by \"the thunder Steeds of Spain,\" (Lord Lytton), and zones, as you know, that were so repeatedly made murky with the blood of all the pirate races of Europe. To-morrow morning we shall be able to distinguish the first lines of \"la tierra,\" and though the Harbor of Palos, known as the bar of Salters, will be lost in the mystic hues of earth and lee, I shall certainly see on my mind's horizon the ghosts of those three caravels, commanded by our First Western Pioneer, as they sailed from the delta of the Guadalquivir to disappear over the bottomless deeps we have traversed.\n\nColumbus isn't the only person that looked back towards home! I have been at it for ten days!\n\nCadiz\n\nFrom the morning we glided into the Cadiz Bay I have given myself over to inducements which play on the emotions like music — \"beautiful Electronic Music!\" If you can imagine Turner painting a harbor scintillating with tartanes and small vessels, frigates and steamers from every country surrounding the Mediterranean, each flying its flags en gala in honor of the birthday of His Majesty Alfonso XIII — if you can see the shining sand undulating to the east and west and upon them build a little city smiling midst palms in an absolute Sunday calm, then you may have a picture of the beauty spot where I descended to terra firma and moreover to the tune of a Spanish national march! Yes, sir, a really truly grand brass band was decorating the docks as only Spanish mustaches and the Andalucian uniforms can. All was color — a bright gently moving agitation or semi-oriental excitement that pervaded even the quarters of the very uncompromising custom officials.\n\nCustoms and derechos (duties) always prick the fun out of any frontier. Simple philosopher that I am, never have I quite adjusted my tempers to fit these occasions. Being in high spirits I walked into the Cadiz customs shed, feeling very much like first declaring my alleged American liberty, but instead I produced the trifles that instantly marked me for special negotiations. One of my boxes gave up an electric coffee percolator and a toaster. They were for an American resident of Spain. Thereupon I became the center of attraction until the Spanish Condesa declared an incubator. The magic of an incubator when explained certainly struck consternation into those demurring, discrediting miscreants of the law who paid no heed to my smiles!\n\nDetained as we were the hotel diligence left us to settle for our ne plus ultra, and by the time it returned all my missionary intentions (as if I ever claimed any) were completely exhausted. For all I care, backward southern Spain need never boast of another percolator and can boil coffee in an oven or toast its bread in the sun. I found the Hôtel de France a revelation. The service is courteous, the cuisine anything but French. The rooms being clustered about the glass-covered patio which serves as a lobby, make it impossible to proceed to the bath without attracting the attention of an audience. It is the best of the posadas in Cadiz with pension rates approximating thirty to forty pesetas per day.\n\n\"DUELO\" (Mourning)\n\nTypes of Peasant Women\n\nFrom a Painting by Lopez Mezquita. Madrid\n\nFollowing luncheon yesterday, I peered down from my iron-grilled balcony on the clean plaza and felt closed into some remote pocket of Time where nothing stirred — not even a cigarette butt in the wind. At that hour the entire population of 70,000 persons were either having a siesta or collectively running wild in the Plaza del Toro. I judged it to be the proper instant to saunter forth for exercising my curiosity in general.\n\nCadiz is projected into the sea on a slender peninsula. When I turned the corner I decided that had Hercules tried to drive away the oxen of the ancient King Geryon on so blustery an afternoon, that the feat of overcoming Eurytion and the two-headed Dog and driving oxen from Gades would not have been counted among his \"twelve labors\" — unless Hercules be the name for the four winds! At any rate I made a tour through streets almost too narrow for one vehicle to pass, noted the only trolley line that goes out into the country, mentally photographed several marvelous old doorways, and decided to write \"Aunt Sallie\" about the cigar factory planted right next to a church! On the quays I rested my weary legs on a very cold bench near trays of fish and cake. Soon thereafter I was on my way back to the hotel, arriving just as things were reawakening for the evening, and feeling two thousand years from home.\n\n\"Cadiz, sweet Cadiz,\" wrote your antithesis \"Cortejo\" Byron to his mother, \"the first spot in creation, the beauty of its streets and mansions only excelled by the liveliness of its inhabitants.\" The \"liveliness of its inhabitants\" is the first mark made upon one's permanent impressions if one happens to be an unaccompanied woman — even when she is intent upon her own business! Men congregate upon the lintel at one's approach. — However, I made no acquaintances except the four-storied white-balconied houses aflame with flowers. The bright faces which at intervals beamed from the green outside shutters (called postigos), and were all of my sex, observed me investigating the squares and promenades fanned by rows of tropical trees. I have concluded that the place is rich with creative hormons and worthy of the list of artists, such as Gautier, de Musset, George Sand and various others who have left their names upon the Cadiz social register. The tom-toms of the Cosmic forces are in the air for one to collect into highly modern savage composition. I have, by the way, a copy of E. P.'s book on G. A.'s music. Having survived, I shall never forget his first concert in Paris — particularly the expression on the face of James Joyce.\n\n§\n\nI'LL admit here and now that I have become a \"Peeping Tom\" and am sinfully curious about the doings of these beautiful Señoras. Whatever Byron may have made it in his day when he was inspired to write the Girl of Cadiz, the parts played by women simply are not seen outside the hidden patios, except it be at the church. One is inclined to believe — owing to well-guarded gates — that \"Apollo\" Byron must have found Cadiz rather a discouraging corner of the world for his love-making overtures, and in sheer despair turned to the safety valve of boastfulness that nourished the incomparable escapades of his Don Juan. (Legend contends that Don Juan's father and mother actually lived near here on the banks of the Guadalquivir.)\n\nSince Byron's time Andalucía cannot have changed much. They still possess the charm he couldn't forget, and their sphere still extends from the husband's arms to the cradle and back to the husband again. Novios sing of the \"eternal flower\" (siempre flor) of womanhood, sentimentalizing over the bud, the blossom, and the fragrance in the garden of love (particularly the fragrance)! And to quote some one whose identity I forget, \"Rosa bianca at ten in the morning, rosa perfecta at two P.M., rosa perfecta incarnada at five.\" That well expresses the day-long life of her youth. These coveted flowers are hidden back of the semi-harem walls, and in many cases submit to being locked (like the Siciliana we knew in Rome) in their chambers while the passionately adored males make commerce abroad or release sparkling ventilations equal to this one; \"The most fragile articles of furniture are women and windowpanes!\" Unswerving in her place she is content to accept his dialectics, welcome him as master, show off the children, encourage him in manly pride by enjoying his society, and outside that seeking only the consolations of religion. Bearing the appellations of martyrs and saints, they live, to all outward appearances, up to the standard names of Maria, Solitude, and Concepcion, sharing the joys and also the collective woes of the Mother Immaculate, all the while swearing lightly by her purity.\n\nHow they pray! — constantly expecting everything from God! The extremes of medievalism are still attendant upon their natures, traits that comprehensively mark the southern Italian from the Italian of the north where the pre-Bourbon-Spanish influence did not altogether penetrate the public conscience. For instance, no doubt you have seen in southern Italy those Spanish-like ladies who without a sign of remorse are doing time after some hurried vow made before the Madonna by donning the leather belt, that being an ungainly and sometimes knotted cordon worn around the oft none too slender waist; by it they are evidently rendered all the more irresistible to the males! Is it any wonder one's humor reverts to Armida to whom Tasso, in his \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1575) presented a girdle surpassing even the jeweled cestus of Venus which worked so much enchantment that men loved her all the more?\n\n§\n\nTHIS morning my mail gave up a letter from Viscount George Henri du Manior, whom Dr. Thompson Sweeny rightly insists upon calling \"Man o'War\"! . . . He was with the French Mission in San Sebastian, having received there a military decoration at the hand of His Majesty. Since then he has been engaged with affairs stationing him in the Basque Provinces. From Bilbao he writes that which from the French point of view is amusing. He says — in translation : —\n\n\"There is no limit to the numbers of children in the Spanish family. I have seen as many as sixteen all by the same mother and father — and in spite of the fact that a Spaniard devotes more time to the café, telling all he knows, than to his wife. These large families are in fashion among the rich as well as the poor. The average of two or three in America or France attains the average of a dozen in Spain. The family has remained what it is said to have been in the Roman times, that is, governed by the Almighty 'Pater Familias.' In Bilbao the wealthiest gentleman in town, and in that part of Spain, sits at the dining table surrounded by forty-five of his sons and daughters with their husbands and children. He provides not only the roof, but the largest part of the spending money.\n\n\"An attractive dancer whom I knew in Madrid insisted that I call at her home and astonished me by introducing the mother and a sister and fourteen children, 'the how, why, and who' not even the grandmother could tell me.\n\n\"I called once on a customer who was about to sign a contract with our firm for the supply of oxygen. When I heard that he had lost a recently born child, I asked him to accept the expression of my sympathy. 'Oh, don't worry, the mold is not broken!' was his cheerful answer, asking me to have a little drink at the next café.\n\n\"A rich father is always prompt to tell you that in Spain they never give a 'dot' to the señoritas. It must be true, yet I never saw any young man working after being married to a rich man's daughter. As a rule the young married couple start borrowing the next morning after the ceremony. Day by day all they need is given them and sometimes much more. If the parents are known as rich people, the young couple may easily find credit up to the amount they are expected to inherit at the father's death. Of course they will have to pay a heavy interest on such money, but not as heavy as might be supposed, since the risk for the lender is not as big as it would be in other countries where money is made — but also lost — much more quickly than it is in Spain. Besides, divorce does not exist and people are married for life, with no way out; so they are all the more ready when they are young to spend everything they have in common. As age comes along they accept more readily a steady life, and are glad to live together in some quiet way, where little money will be needed. The children (for many children will be theirs) do not cost much to breed or rear in the way big families are brought up in this country.\"\n\nFrom personal observation, I really believe that a woman's club such as a woman's club is known in England and America would throw a Spanish community into a state of panic or martial law. Phrases suggesting a quasi-public life for women or a \"Pome\" by E. P. would convulse the entire kingdom if repeated by any group of these subordinated ones aiming to see \"la Vérité toute nue,\" or voice their opinions for home or state. At this stage of their evolution they are almost as fixed behind double standards as ever they were in the eighteenth century.\n\nOf course, a great many American men profess to think that this Spanish code is half right. I, myself, believe that we American and English women are forfeiting too much in gaining our complete emancipation. We have lost a very great deal of charm that makes for power. We will drive our men to raising long, assertive, or parted J. Ham Lewis beards, and, moreover, with these shimmering garments outlining all the imperfections (as well as the perfections of sculptural line) it has reached the point where — well, our position has become decidedly unfair. That is to say, our styles leave nothing to the imagination, and in the instance of the intended marriage, unless the girl organizes a marathon, she is liable to draw any old pair of shanks, no matter how unshapely, and have to pretend for the rest of her life that she has married a Perseus.\n\nThe prurient Spaniard taboos our short skirt. To an extent one must agree with him, but entirely on American grounds where the æsthetic senses too often are sent shivering down the spine in revolt against the unbeautiful. In other words, if we women ever aspire to ideals about the underpinnings of the human race the deformities on exhibition to-day certainly don't prove that we have done our part. If we add leg-culture to the daily dozen perchance the future generations will profit by the concentration!\n\nNow our Spanish sisters do not have to be preoccupied about this so much, for they live in the extreme of retirement. They are still victims of the system of education that has fostered false modesty and considerable illiteracy, a condition in this generation to which we in America can lay no claim.\n\nYesterday I spent an edifying afternoon in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan, who are established in an old Moorish house that is an enticing pattern of all the other ancient dwellings in Cadiz. Like the hotel, the square white marble patio is open to the sun. Mrs. Sullivan has drawn a beautiful canopy over this space which coaxes in the breeze and still protects the house from the summer heat. An arrangement of tile-floored rooms connects with the old galleries surrounding the rotunda where caged birds twitter amongst tropical plants and a soft tinkle of water plays in an Arabic-tiled fountain. It is the background into which I set the families of her more cloistered neighbors, who, I understand, are beginning to insist upon their \"four o'clock,\" which in Madrid they say is really a five o'clock tea or coffee, but in Andalucía a refreshment of lime in sweetened water.\n\nThe inconveniences of these houses are countless. In comparison with the London apartment or Paris studio they belong to the Biblical era. The kitchen, by reason of the terrific heat of summer, is always on the top, or upper floor, where a two-hundred-year-old tiled stove (that being a series of open rings under which a charcoal fire burned) is built into the wall. But in such a house, made beautiful by many plants and ravishing old furniture, one falls under the benediction of peace that comes with turning one's back to the world.\n\nFor the respectable, outside diversions (other than the corredo and church feasts) don't exist any more than international politics. Of course, there is that question of the Riff, but in our sense they are free of the mad reactions following the World War. So it is that time doesn't mean \"poco tiempo!\" as it does in America. One can well imagine the type of relaxation habitual to the Spanish women who live to the measured passing of their child-bearing years, growing corpulent at thirty, and becoming old when forty. Fortunately at that age the \"flower\" of their youth causes their men no more alarm, and a little freedom comes with granddaughters they \"duenna\" to mass.\n\nTo go on with the love motifs of our Andalusian sisters, I must tell you how a hint to my young Spanish guide launched him into his version of this ever-refreshing refrain. He had but recently married and viewed himself still in the feathers of the conquest. He said that he had first followed his señorita to the church when she had the tender age of twelve years. He prided himself in the fact that before he had shadowed her she had not found a chance to think of any man but himself. (Observing the behavior of little girls of that age I am sure that she was well aware of her woman's mission.) However, during three years when other men had dared once or twice to slide into the offing, he had followed her about, suffering through the church feasts and winning never a satisfaction beyond a word slyly dropped in her ear. 'Twas her \"wheedling she\" part to lead him on with a smile, — scorning to answer. Then, continuing the Spanish courting receipt for accepting the gentleman, she unloosed the \"Mimosa\" glances and one day decided his future by dropping a little trinket from her bracelet. He had dashed four and five times a day lingering under her balcony to ache by the moon and bake by the sun.\n\n\"Carai, Señora, but that balcony was high!\" said he.\n\nMaria had several small sisters and brothers to attend in the patio. But when she was fifteen, another sister was fourteen and old enough to take over the young charges, whereupon mother and father suddenly appeared to have become aware of his Troubadour presence. They had obtained to their satisfaction his full record. He was invited on Christmas to warm his hands over the same brazier with the family of his enamorata. Fruit must not be over-ripened on the bough, and so a speedy marriage ensued.\n\n\"It costs a man a great deal to marry,\" he explained, and proceeded to tell me about the customary party he had given in her house, saying that he had paid all the expenses for his friends and hers, not forgetting to add that at this, her one party, she danced with no man but himself. Now she never leaves his house except on his arm. Vinculum matrimonii!\n\nConsidering the business from the other angle, that is from the woman's side of it, well, you must not think that she is unhappy in sharing such a contract. Except inside the Spanish convents, I'll venture to say that here there are no causes for the well-advertised Anglo-Saxon complex! The women are uncomplicated females exulting in the functions of Motherhood. Besides, I am wondering if Mr. Andalucía does not know his Mrs. Andalucía. Anyway whether 'twas spoken of the ladies or the gentlemen, history boasts that Cadiz was \"the first to be free and the last to be subdued!\"\n\nIn a manner of speaking it is a relief to be some place where the unmarried women do not archly discuss (in precious ridiculousness) the dangers of a \"son complex\" and \"birth control\" with women of substance who have given themselves over to the ecstasies of mothering their offspring — daughters as well as sons. Nor is there to be found within these boundaries that Allia-Lælia-Crispis woman of the U. S. A.; or that stall-bursting Margot-Scarfati-de-Stahl European type, who, deficient in æstheticism, sterile with feminine abstractions without corresponding reason, plop ideas upon a sensation-loving public without the slightest gradation of finer thought to back them up. Such a type overlooking the significance of epochs for incidents of a generation, and virtually being the annoying or amusing quantities known as \"brilliant women\" imagining themselves useful to politicians, and therefore a little dangerous to the reigning powers — that example of our sex, is, I believe, still unborn in Spain.\n\n§\n\nWELL how goes the Bel Esprit? I have just come in from an interurban drive, having stopped at the suppressed convent of San Francisco. (The priest in charge wasn't the least bit suppressed. He was too handsome for anything like that!) 'Twas there that Murillo, while working on the St. Catherine altar painting, moved to arrange the light and fell six meters, receiving the injuries which caused his death six months later in Sevilla. When I think about the jest you made on the last chapter in the life of \"George\" I begin to wonder if somebody who thought he had the right to the joys of prowess didn't give Murillo a little push! Anyway his collection of beautiful paintings in the Municipal Art Gallery, owned by the Municipal Council, is too sweet to suit your virile taste. You did not miss anything by not dropping in on Cadiz. Still I think you'd not scorn the few archæological treasures of the Museo where one sees rings, amulets, and escutcheons found in the eleventh century B.C. Phœnician tombs when the 1892 excavations were in progress. Considering the ravages of wars and the fact that Cadiz is surrounded by the ever-encroaching seas, beaten with the persistently blowing sands, it is amazing that even these tombs remained to tell the story of the post-Greek culture that followed the Carthaginians, who in their turn had driven out the ancient Berbers or Iberians. These conquerors under Pompey, Lucullus, Sylla, and Cæsar have left only a trace in the form of wall or the usual large stone roadbeds. One finds it difficult to realize that Hannibal, who had reduced Roman Legions at Cannæ (616 B.C.), supplied his fleet here. Nor is there anything to remind one of the first brute invaders of the north (60 B.C.), when Gothic Gods of Sun and Thunder met Roman Gods of Delian fame. Oblivion has practically swallowed up the fortifications of those Empire builders who passed on before the far-reaching Christianizing policy of Constantine (335 A.D.) delayed the dismemberment of the Roman Empire.\n\nThere is certainly something of the savage Goth shining in these Spanish faces, and something of those ancient barbarians who, exasperated under the cruelties of Emperor Valeus, rose along the Danube in combined tribal armies led by Aleric, to conquer Greece, Sparta, Corinth and Argos, and finally, during the reign of Honorius (408), to destroy Rome itself. Of the monuments of the first Visi-Gothic King (414) of León and Castile (a Scandinavian, who, like the Goths, affected a Roman name), I've seen nothing. And 'tis enough to forget them and not be conscious of anything but the sunshine painting more gay the fresh blue-green shutters on the pink washed houses. So quiet it is, one's thoughts flit unmolested on the quays, up the north road to the fortifications and along the shore circumventing many peninsulas given over to hundreds of shallow canals, where sea water is evaporated to crystallize the salt that for miles glistens white in pyramidic piles. Then in Cadiz, one's senses are lulled with the mystery of the kindred civilization that is calling from Algiers, just three hours' sailing across the strait. Something that is purely Spanish simply stops the pendulum. I am too tired after a long expenditure of strength to listen for the tick of modern advancement or miss the life force vibrating through our American flow of world energy.\n\nWhen you wrote the volume on G.A., was a gadfly after your Pegasus? I could not quite follow you. I understand his harmonies — ? — or collections of hellish sounds are going to be heard in America. Tell him for me that he will be obliged to introduce a sky scraper in the stages of pneumatic hammering if he is to truly complete the orchestrated dins expressive of the unadulterated go-getting American spirit.\n\nI have given to Dr. Christian Brinton (yes, he is only named Christian) a card of presentation to you! Without doubt you will some day come together in your travels. He is somewhat of a mental grasshopper — universal one to be sure — who knows his blue skies. If you want discussion tie him up, or he will whiz off to Russia where he is most at home.\n\nYes, Dr. Brinton is a critic, but he hasn't swallowed a porcupine. However, he doesn't wade into much MSS — just painting, and sculpture, etchings, drawing-rooms and museums.\n\nDon't get too soon bored with EXILE. May it prosper and bring forth issue after issue . . . all virgins according to \"le nouveau né\"!\n\nP.S. — I am grateful for the address. Now I shall think of zabaglione and by association of ideas know that it is Via Marsala . . . one dozen.\n\nSevilla\n\nI MAILED a letter to Precious You just before taking a squeak tortured train for the interior of Andalucía, by Cervantes spoken of as the \"gold purse of Spain.\" Over stretches of alluvial plain — through wild ranges and eroisms which inspired the fabulous poetry of a people that have been so productive in history — past aromatic thickets of myrtle and groves of citrous fruits — Sevilla-ward we crawled. I enjoyed the whole length of the trip even to the train's funny little thin whistle. There were no white bulls (emblems of pagan sacrifice and now used in special bull fights) to count, so I guessed how many Germans were in my coach and missed by a half a dozen! In truth I was anticipating the 280-plus castles we saw among the Vernon Howe Bailey drawings in the Hispanic Museum at New York. He certainly furnished the traveler toward Spain with anticipations. Tumble-down ruins really do top the crest of every commanding height. However, it was not until sunset that the first great castle rose from the mauves of the distance.\n\nAs we approached it, I perceived that a village old and gray as the earth from which it was born, nestled to its foundations still appearing to live by grace of shadowy feudal protection. When the magnificence of its towers and strength of its walls receded, it rested on the horizon like a crown of unparalleled medievalism. In isolation and resistance, in tranquil aloofness it expressed a sustained quality that is the soul of Spain. For one brief second I reverberated to the terror of the mystic life — a Spanish quality which is at once cruel, passionate, greedy, and self-sacrificing and withal something too illusive to be readily understood by an Anglo-Saxon.\n\nIn the compartment with me was a Californian couple who had spent the winter in Malaga, the second city of importance in Andalucía. It is a beautiful port and even by them praised for its perfectly dry winter air. A fountain there, according to their tale, is the scandal of Spain. 'Twas designed during the 16th Century for a Sultan of Turkey, stolen by pirates and sold to Malaga. To be explicit, it's a three-storied and several-figured elaboration of the little fountain lad of Brussels.\n\nAt Malaga the Easter ceremonies and religious processions and pasos were described as vying with those of Sevilla. Malaga is a great winter resort for the English (as Ronda is fast becoming popular with the Americans — which fact does not at all please our English cousins). The history of Malaga is lurid with the burnings of the Jews and the maltreatment of the African population when it fell under the Christianizing wills of Ferdinand and Isabella.\n\nWhen I left New York, my plan was to debark at Gibraltar. In fact I had an English visé in order to be welcomed on that bit of \"neutral ground\" — neutral since the war with England (1702-13) said to have been precipitated by Philip V but in reality by Louis XIV who forced Bourbon politics over Spain through his incompetent grandson at that time surrounded with the English Allies composed of the Dutch, the Austrians (whose Archduke claimed the Spanish throne) and the Spaniards of Aragón and Catalonia. England was particularly anxious to bring about disruption of the unity between Spain and France, her object being to break Bourbon strength. The war continued until the Whigs in England (who had promoted the war) were overruled by the Tories who desired peace. Moreover Charles had ascended the throne in Austria, after having been completely vanquished in his attempt to take the Crown from Philip, and it was feared by England that Austria, the natural friend of Spain, would unite with the latter. Spain meantime had lost Sardinia and Minorca. Dismembership of the Dominions had been cruelly devastating since after the peace concluded at Utrecht, there remained nothing of the former Spanish Dominions but Spain and the Indies, with England standing in \"Prudential\" guard over the Gibraltar!\n\nNow to go on with myself . . . I also wished very much to drive into the heart of the old Iberia (as well as Malaga) to the town of Elche where that beautiful sculptured bust (Lady of Elche3) was unearthed. It is situated in the much talked of forest of date palms and is the home of The Mystery, a sixteenth century Opera founded on an earlier pageant and given annually at the Cathedral on the day of the Assumption. I had intended to return by way of \"Mare Nostrum\" from Algeciras to Cadiz. But, I was advised not to make this picturesque journey to the English cemetery (and other coast attractions) without pleasant traveling companions. It was something sacrificed, for in that part of the land Flora holds a feast the year round. If I could find an agreeable traveling companion I should go on to Ronda before I start north.\n\nTo come back to the train — after crossings and re-crossings of the Guadalquivir's silver riband, making delays at every sleepy town en route, a little after dark the lusty voices of the blue-overalled porters of Sevilla tore me from a stupor whereupon I found my bags in the clutches of an Aleizegue (a famous giant of Spain) and the strongest portiero I can remember ever having encountered in all my wanderings. Not satisfied with one man's load, he and each of his tribe wore on his waist a heavy belt studded with iron hooks on which was attached a second man's capacity. (Tips, too, are doubled in Spain.)\n\nAgain I kept the hotel bus waiting, while I opened my trunk which was inspected by the consumos. Naturally I should not have had a trunk with me, but I did not feel that it was safe to send baggage on to Paris until I got to Madrid. Why this extra examination I could not ascertain, and being an unaccompanied woman in a land where women do not demand reasons, I didn't brave any man with an extra interrogation. In Cadiz, I heard that \"nice\" women do not go about alone, so I was almost too intimidated to ask if my room had been reserved. This timidity became real embarrassment when, on entering the lobby of the Inglaterra, the porter in unpardonable gaucherie but apparently without discourteous intent dropped my luggage with a resounding bang and the announcement \"Una señora sola!\" (A woman alone!) Having a letter to the American Consul and his wife who live in the hotel and had been apprized of my intentions to stop there, I rose to the occasion and ordered the entire hotel office to announce my arrival to the American Consul. As the Italians say, that put him and the audience \"al posto\" and they perforce accepted me as one of those independent English dames who have long traveled outside the bounds of domesticity and masculine authority. Before ten o'clock (the hour Spain dines and the hour the stranger will dine if he be comme il faut) I sent up a note to the Consul saying that I hoped to see him and his wife the next morning and then had my dinner served before the balcony in a delightful camera — where I am now writing.\n\nEvery little while I am drawn to the window by some strange and distracting sound. Already I find myself hanging over the iron grilling, very à la Española, filling my nostrils with the perfume of orange blossoms as 'tis borne out upon the night air that happily is no respecter of hidden away gardens, creamy-skinned damsels, frantic husbands and duennas, or jealous lovers. It is good to feel myself succumbing to the leisure-making processes of the Spanish climate and customs. The persons who ramble below my windows appear to have no industrial incentives beyond gaining the simple necessities of the day. They are at liberty to enjoy the evening as they were free to take the siesta in the early afternoon. That applies to all classes.\n\nSo you can see I am full under the spell of Andalucía. From my balcony I behold the first rays of the sun as He strikes the Giralda tower on which the most changeable female, a bronze figure of Faith (oh, happy fusion of ignorance and wisdom) turns like a weather-cock to the winds flaunting her bronze banner of the great liberalist Constantine. This tower was designed by Gever who introduced algebra into Spain during the twelfth century when the Moslem was about to terminate his renaissance in Sevilla, Córdoba, and Granada.\n\nHistorical Note\n\nIn the same Two-Hundred-Year epoch of prosperity shared by the Moors and Jews of Spain, their contemporaries in Europe, beginning with Godfrey de Bouillon in 1095 to Edward I of England in 1270 (forgetting not the seven others including Richard Cœur de Lion) had called the barons from their donjon keeps, draining off two million savage followers of the Cross in the Crusades against the Turks who had taken Jerusalem in 1096. Those of the eight armies of \"Knight Errants\" and riffraff fortunate enough to return, made great stock of the relics brought from the Holy Land, selling them for fabulous prices to anyone who could pay, all of which explains the great store of odd bones and splinters to be found in the church collections of Europe.\n\nWith the waning enthusiasm among the crusading Christians Ferdinand El Santo (1217-52) arrived at the Mosque of Sevilla, having taken it with a formidable army clad in metal visors, hauberks, helmets, greaves, fighting hand-to-hand battles with ax, spikes and arrows.\n\n&dot; &dot; &dot; &dot; &dot; &dot; &dot;\n\nThe Giralda tower has been spared principally because gunpowder was not used in Europe until the siege of Algeciras in 1343. So there she stands, rising above every other building in Sevilla, unshaken by war and earthquakes that have been too numerous and devastating, and still carrying the golden floral decors of the cultured Arab.\n\nYesterday I stood in the Giralda on the level with these ornaments and feasted on pastoral hill and dale of the surrounding country. Below me were the Alcázar gardens where once reigned the Moorish queens amongst the Sultan's slaves and concubines, and where the crescent banners of the Arab Abd-el-Asis established other North African rulers in Spain (711).\n\nI was amply repaid for hurrying on to Sevilla in order to attend the feast of May 21st when one hears the full Cathedral chorister with a special organ program. The service excelled even Rome. For a couple of hours I stood before the high gilt reja enthralled with the formalities and fervors of sense-stirring music that culminated in the utmost exaltation of Christian-pagan rites. The same day I returned to this most beautiful of the Spanish Cathedrals seeking to refresh me within its cool battlement walls built over the foundation of the old Mosque adjoining the Giralda. The feeling of tremendous space is caught within this architecture covering 124,999 square feet. The 100-foot nave and overwhelming length place it third amongst the world's Cathedrals. On entering one is attracted to the right side of the transept where stands the conspicuously handsome tomb of him who gave to Spain's glory the credit for the discovery of the Western Continent. This memorial was previously erected in Havana, but after the Cuban disaster was transported to the city that first proclaimed his daring worth.\n\nIf only one could flee from the sight of the beggars! A few of the muy pobres, tired of wandering in the streets, are always standing outside or praying before the stations and gilded saints, or by the golden gate set up between worshipers and the silver shrine in the Capella Real, where lies Fernando, founder of the Gothic line of kings of southern Spain and Castile (1217-52) and raised to sainthood (1671) for having begun the burning of the Moors.\n\nYes, one must take one's history with one's travels. Incidentally in this \"deliverer of Sevilla\" after the five hundred years of Moslem rule, one discovers the cousin to St. Louis. The latter, having set the boundaries between France and Spain, died attending a plague-ridden people of North Africa. Fernando El Santo is said to have passed on to his son, Alfonso the Tenth, some of his political talents which may have been the seed that flourished in the son (Sancho Fourth) who, being estranged, resorted to arms against the father. At any rate Sancho Fourth begot Fernando Fourth and Fernando enjoyed an uproarious seven years, leaving the crown to Alfonso Eleventh, \"The Very Just.\"\n\nIn Alfonso Eleventh we have one of the busiest romancers that ever delighted in seraglios. Therefrom issued the characters for the next series of blood-curdling errors besmirching the careers of his legitimate heir, Pedro the Cruel, and Pedro's several bastard brothers. Regardless of his \"left-handed\" offspring writers have chosen to deal kindly with Alfonso Eleventh. They find in him much to talk about. Donizetti in \"La Favorita,\" an opera (1842), tells the story of Leonora de Guzman (one of his mistresses) and Fernando (his kinsman) who, having won the battle of Tarifa in 1340, was created Count of Zamora and Marquis of Montreal. The story goes that the King, knowing the Marquis's love for Leonora, presented her to him in marriage. Fernando, hearing almost at once that she was the king's mistress, restored to the king both the lady and his new rank, retiring to the monastery of St. James de Compostella where he was soon joined by a novice, Leonora, who obtained his pardon and died. One surmises that the opera runs more or less to facts.\n\nPedro (El Cruel) with his rapacious mistress and accomplice, Maria de Padilla, is buried under another hallowed stone in the Cathedral. The old Spaniards, unlike the present Dean of Westminster, had no compunction about entombing Pedro in all the poetic glamour of his hard-ridden desires. Nowhere, with the exception of the incestuous Roderick Borgia (Vice-chancellor of the Church, Arch Bishop of Valencia, a criminal in Spain before he bought the papal chair) does one come upon a more complete archvillain and born murderer than Pedro El Cruel. Albeit he did not hunt human quarry with the hounds like the son of the great Gian Galeazzo of Milan, his sword is strung with the lives of his mother, Mary of Portugal; his wife, Blanche de Bourbon, whom he accused and had condemned by a perfidious council of bishops for incest involving a brother Fadique, who before the marriage he had sent to meet Blanche in Toledo. Added to these were two women cousins, three brothers, his head minister, the brother of his mistress, Don Juan d'Aragón, and countless of his subjects. Of his three illegitimate daughters, derogating from the title, two of them, Isabel and Costanza, he married to the Duke of Lancaster and John of Gaunt, brothers of the Black Prince. Beatrix, the third daughter, became a nun.\n\nIf we may go on with this deviation from the subject of the Cathedral, when still a young man we discover Pedro reduced and blockaded in the castle of Montiel on the crags of the Sierra Morena. There, according to the prediction of his long dead child-wife, he passed under the Torre de Estrella to final capitulation. A short distance from this castle he was met and slain (1369) by the remaining natural brother Enrique, first of the line of Trastamara, who having at last settled the old feud, realized by that assassination his ambition to take over the Crown.\n\nEnrique reigned eleven years. In this line of the middle-age forerunners of the golden period of Medieval Spain, we note favorably that his son Juan First died at thirty-four in an honest game of tournament. En suite came Enrique \"El Enfermo,\" who was all that \"infirm\" implies. Catalina then took the regency, only to be dominated by Doña Leonor Lopez, until Catalina's son, Juan Second, assumed the sovereign duties. He in turn abandoned public interests for literature. Enrique El Impotente (1454-74), the next king, is described in Spanish history as \"indolent, weak, and alternately vicious and full of errors.\" His reign was fraught with civil wars which in the end forced him to resign in favor of his sister Isabel. She was married to her second cousin, the strong-willed Fernando \"El Católico\" king of Aragón. They initiated the Inquisition, vanquished the Moors in Granada, quelled the Jewish powers, and became great with new fortunes for a united Spain (1474-1516) that continued with the record of Church, Crown and Serfdom.\n\nIn the Cathedral are some grandiose paintings scarcely crossed by the rhombic rays of daylight. Better still are the priceless fabrics — robes spun of silk, silver, and gold — alongside jeweled chalices, patens, reliquaries and miters which with other splendors annually make worldly peregrinations into the street processions of Corpus Christi and Christi Domini. At these events the great diamond crowned Madonna afire with jewels, San Fernando in knight's armor of León and Castile, Rufina and Justina, the martyred Sans, and Santiago with his baton (every figure a personification of glory), come out into the 20th Century amongst thousands of worshipers, proceeding from the church to the Alcalde or Mayor's balcony back to safety in the vaulted treasury.\n\nThe unique Sieses dance performed with castanets by the chorister in Philip Second costumes is given once during the Setemana Santo, and on three other occasions during the year. On Good Friday the Miserere is sung. In the same week the Queen washes the feet of twelve old dames who are said sometimes to faint from an exhausted state of hysteria.\n\nThe feria, or horse show, brings Spanish custom into the open and has been attractively illustrated by the postcards I inclose. If they are true to color this floral display of gypsy-like garnishing of carriages and carts must be the most gorgeous extravaganza of the Spring season.\n\n§\n\nTHE more one sees of the home city of \"Figaro\" the more one senses the blood of the Moor dominant over the early Goth, whose last sovereign, Roderick, gave way under the African swarm that covered the Peninsula and remained overpowering rulers for two and a half centuries, before the Goth returned to the re-conquests which were not conclusive until the 13th century.\n\nThis morning I have been in the Alcázar (accent middle A) built by Prince Abdurraman, enlarged by Yussuf after the Alhambra on a smaller scale for Pedro El Cruel. It is the key to the soul of Sevilla or the modified culture of the East, an exotic spot even in the times of Abd-el-Asis and his Arabs, who took the city from the Goth Roderick (709) demanding, according to the Moorish law, One-Hundred Christian virgins, Fifty rich and Fifty poor. 'Twas there in the Patio de las Munecas amongst the slaves that Abd-el-Asis found Roderick's queen, a former African Princess, who promptly kindled the \"idle passion,\" led him up the shining steps of ambition to the Precipice of Ruin. This luxury-loving pair, drugged in seraphic dreams, were murdered by the Damascan Caliph and their bodies entombed no one knows where.\n\nOn entering the Alcázar one becomes nonplused by the character of the fortified walls. The passage inside takes almost the shape of a Roman sottopassaggio. These walls served to protect the Royal Palace both before and after Ferdinand (1217-52) raised the Christian flags over the fortress.\n\nCrossing the Patio de la Monteria one confronts the portal of Don Pedro with its Gothic runes, declaring that \"the most high and powerful Don Pedro by the Grace of God, King of Castilla y León, ordered these castles and fortresses to be erected.\"\n\nInside I stood futilely trying to follow the indescribable blending of old colors bringing out the contours of Arabesque borders, tiers, domes, roofs, arcades, horseshoe-shaped arches, lacy curves and carvings that only the Moor's accurate knowledge of geometries could produce. There under the hungry eyes of his mistress, who witnessed all from the Mirador, Pedro, to his dedecoration , put into action the awful declaration, \"I am El Rey Justiciero.\"\n\nThe most splendid part of the chain of fantastic apartments is the Hall of the Ambassadors. It is a conglomerate of late Moslem and Mujedor of the Spanish Renaissance. On these walls that have buffed so many cries, curses and intrigues, run bands of Moorish plateresque and ungainly female heads. Below is a fitting congregation of busts, said to be the portraits of all the good, bad and inconsequential kings of Spain. In going over the Spanish history of the \"Reyes y Jefes de Estado de España\" I have counted one hundred and eight, beginning with Ataulfo (414 A.D.) and ending with the present very beloved Alfonso 13th.\n\nBut, caro mio, one of the objects in bringing you to me in this place is to show to you the trail of the scimitar brandished by the young, blond, and handsome-featured Don Pedro. In this patio are the porphyry pillars supporting a Moslem arch under which, on the marble pavement, after five centuries, are the stains of Don Fradique's, his brother's, blood. Into the same court was dragged the body of Prince Abu Said after he was murdered by Pedro, who coveted the great ruby worn in his green turban. That jewel was later given in settlement for a national debt by Pedro to the Black Prince of England, when he came to Pedro's rescue during the war waged with his brother Enrique de Trastamara. This celebrated stone you probably recall having seen in the Tower of London, where it smoulders in the Royal Crown of England.\n\nPending the Easter festivities, the present Royal Family occupy the upper chambers of the Alcázar, apartments that are not accessible to the public. But the gardens — the ancient pleasure paths of many sovereigns, are open the year round. There nothing remains of death's-heads or deathbeds. Nor does the profusion of laurel and roses red have anything to suggest of the violent deeds of former intemporizing inmates. Cross-shaped flower plots of the old orders of Catholic nuns resanctify the older earth and preach the gospel of living things. Midst marvelously groomed hedges, Arabic fountains and baths, one simply ceases one's silly thinking and is content to be a harmonious part of the beauty and stillness.\n\nAll the gardens of Andalucía have the same atmosphere. Unmolested by the demon of discontent they sing with beauty, and that quantity is copied throughout Spain. Every person of any wealth at all affords one. When the space is small it becomes a glassed \"Solarium\" which has many advantages of comfort, if lacking the promenade and vistas. One of the famous small gardens of Sevilla lies within the walls of the villa of El Condé de la Torres de Sanchez Dalp who is the famous plantation owner of Andalucía. His garden is about a hundred feet square, and set with pepper trees, oranges, blooming plants and palms. Steps inlaid with tile, lead down from the house in a walkway that is decorated with columns, jars, old iron, benches, and flowers blooming from niches. Seen from the garden this walk is framed by a beautiful Moorish arch. A pergola invites one to the right and trellised windows and tiles demand attention on the left. Frescoes painted over plaster walls (similar to those of the Alcázar), vines clinging here and running there, cast a network of charm over the whole, and leave one, as I have said, content to cease one's silly thinking in order to be a part of the harmony of it all.\n\nJUAN BELMONTE\n\nThe Famous Bullfighter of Spain\n\nFrom a Painting by Lopez Mezquita. Madrid\n\n§\n\nNO matter in what direction one goes in Europe it is impossible to get entirely away from old associations of Rome. This afternoon I was meandering about the gardens of the Alcázar when, turning a hedge, I bumped pell mell into two of our compatriots from the American Academy on The Jenicolo, one of whom had grown a disguising beard. We engaged a carriage, much like the old vis-à-vis we used in Bologna, and drove to the Paseo de las Delicias, which, taking on the social importance of the Pincio in Rome, is a fashionable driveway. Following the principal avenues of the park, a number of buildings are in process of erection. They are going to house the 1927 Ibero-Americano Exposition.\n\nYesterday morning I drove around the remains of the 166 Roman towers and castellated town walls dating back to Cæsar and Pompey, and, after finding the Roman-Moorish aqueduct that still brings the waters from Alcala to Sevilla, I sped onward twenty miles or more over bad roads to the ruins of a Roman amphitheater and the site of ancient Hispania said by Madroza to have been the first Latin-speaking town outside of Italy. Imagine also my standing on the ruins of Trajan's Palace in this part of Spain! And a short journey would bring me to the high old Roman town of Medinaceli.\n\nIt is surprising how many great Roman names had their origin in the Spanish colonies. The Emperors Theodosius, Honorius, Hadrian, and Trajan were natives of this country. Seneca of Córdoba, who became a real person to me when I had seen the bronzes of him in the Museum of Naples, was said, like Marcus Aurelius, to have spoken Latin with the accent peculiar to this country. Peleyos, the 12th century Spanish bard who followed Homer in his epic style and subject matter, must have got all his inspirations from these monuments of Roman domination in Spain before Rome weakened through Greek infection of luxury.4\n\nBut to get back to yesterday's drive — I took another direction branching from the road leading towards Sevilla, arriving in Castilleja la Cuesta visiting a little palace where the hero of \"The Fair God\" (Hernando Cortez), first conqueror of Mexico, died in 1549. The wing of this palace adjoins the buildings occupied by an English order of sisters to whom I had the privilege of presenting myself with a large box of American bonbons sent to them by an acquaintance in Chicago.\n\nI found these sisters to be among the most informed persons I ever met. They know all about Mussolini and President Coolidge and I presume Will Rogers! No international news seems to have escaped their vigilant minds. With the exquisite faced Mother Provincial I visited their snow-white chapel. The extensive gardens were sunny with the poor tots of the township who came each day to receive gratis not only instruction but a nourishing merienda. The types of families from whence these children came were in evidence all along the route, peasants who gained a slack livelihood during the farm season when work is available on the lands of the well-to-do.\n\nComing back through rather interesting country, passing the squalid outskirts of the city, I stopped in Triana. It is the languid community in Sevilla where one's olfactories constantly detect garlic and the cocido stew. To be exact, it is to Sevilla what Trastavere is to Rome, more consistently the bed of the old city where the business of living has been going on uninterruptedly since the days of the Roman Empire. It takes its name after the Emperor Adriano who was born there. What historical fact could make it more Roman than that?\n\nNow you understand why I am thinking of you and your terrace. If I could only tell you how many wonderful benefits I gathered there during those far more than happy three winters.\n\n§\n\nIT was certainly good to have news from the \"Four by Four.\" May I ask you to pass this letter on to them that I may not have to repeat in my notes to the other two.\n\nIn Spain one becomes enamoured of tiles — principally the old ones. I have developed almost a collector's zest having from Cadiz carried in my handbag three precious red ones presented to me from the floor of an old Moorish house then in the stage of reconstruction. From such reconstructions (some of them discarding tiles from the 12th and 13th century) many of the roofs of Coral Gables in Florida and other Spanish-effecting communities in America have been built. Cyrus F. Wicker, I understand, has bought hundreds of thousands from the small towns of Iberia and Andalucía.\n\nHaving in mind to add to my nucleus of genuines, in this old shop I asked where such a miracle could be performed. Much to my consternation a most polite manager came forward to give it his consideration, which attention sent me on a tour accompanied by him and a couple of workmen. They dived into cracks, and dust of decades, that had settled over the several courts and sheds, finally to dig up some ancient colored tiles that had once served for the models of the modern reproductions. Following that success we visited the long departments of wet clay and wheels. There the relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker was revealed in the exquisite proportions being so easily and I might say carelessly turned out. Needless to remark none of the workmen had even heard of the \"redoubtable\" and mystifying \"dynamic symmetry\" and ratios. They were all unconsciously creating \"linear units\" having that surprising sense of accuracy and distinction with which the Gods have endowed the brain-handed artist. Some of the men were turning the queer long spouted water jugs one sees in the market stalls all over Spain. Finished, they, like our Indian waterpots, have, as you know, by process of evaporation the virtue of maintaining liquids at a drinkable temperature despite the sun's undivided attentions to mother earth and are the most indispensable of all the simple commodities of the Peninsular restaurant table and household.\n\nTo arrive in the pottery section of Sevilla one crosses an old bridge, where a collection of quaint barks receive their quota of freight bound for the piers of the Mediterranean. I saw several larger vessels from the Americas that had come over with grain and other imports. These wharves are only sixty miles from the sea and mark the navigatable point of the Guadalquivir.\n\nWhen you are here next year you must bring your water colors for sketches of this vicinity. Also you will want to get a picture of the scenes on the roof gardens.\n\nLast week from the windows of a pension, I looked over a roof terrace that disclosed everything, even the family skeleton. These activities (by the guides called \"life on the roofs\") end with beginning of extreme heat. 'Tis now getting to be the time of year when families are contemplating moving down to the lower stories until summer has passed.\n\nDon't forget in self-defense to adjust your program to the schedule of recreation hours, otherwise you will be aimlessly trotting about with no place to go. Beginning work at ten the \"Juans\" amble home at twelve or one and do not open their stores again until four or five. They place a little card on the doors to that effect which is not the most pleasing thing in the world to read when one goes out at the last moment determined to buy postals.\n\nApropos to railroad tickets, one may take advantage of mileage books sold by the 3000-kilometers, and cut one's fare in half, at the same time be free to come and go on any day during the year, the only attention necessary being to have the ticket stamped before boarding the train.\n\nNeedless to say after days of constant going I am beginning to be tramp-tired. Last night I went to sleep over some excerpts from Isadore of Sevilla, a 6th century scholar who claims to have rescued from oblivion the choice statement that Alia, a Spartan warrior, invented dice during the siege of Troy. Naturally anything that recalls the courageous Helen gets down to fundamentals which discredit the most careful of subconscious selves. In consequence, that oversoul of me which simply will not behave, promptly fell into weaving a dream from the doings and impressions of yesterday. Somewhere on this side of Censor I found me midst a collection of genuine Greek vases where black-lined warriors and silhouettes (after making a few Raymond Duncan gestures) calmly stepped into life and pantomime. Paris and Helen and Menelaus were there \"having it out\" whilst the place became eerie with shadowy forms of gods and the lesser deities. The scene changed, as dream products usually do, but not before Helen led out the Fates and in this delightful illusion advanced holding a bejeweled ivory die in each upturned palm. With the changeless expression of Michael Angelo's Pythia, she broke the silence saying, \"They are only plaster of Paris.\" And that idiotic pun brought me to reality and my coffee, and thus to writing you before meeting an appointment at a studio near the Alcázar.\n\n§\n\nDAY before yesterday I came near completing my education in Spanish tiles or azulejos, ancient and modern. I had a selection of old and new ones packed and shipped to Valley-Bridge for the Rose Garden, where you may at length study them for yourself. The old ones are twice the thickness of the poor imitations manufactured to-day. I was told that it is impossible to reproduce the same quality in color of metallic lacquers and lusters so artfully developed by the Moslem. The Arabs inherited the secret from the Semitics. So it happens that the Spanish tile, probably originating under the Persians or the Egyptians about 1500 B.C. in the time of the Old Testament, arrived via Arabia to Spain and is now generally known as the Flemish or Dutch tile that was popularly used in the fireplaces of the 16th century English and Scottish castles.\n\n[ quite agree with you in what you say in your last letter with reference to my attending a bullfight. Like you I have no desire to or curiosity about brutal exhibitions. But here in the Peninsula it is the rage that no one is allowed to overlook or dismiss from mind. For instance, on Sundays I must see from my windows the thousands that disgorge from the electric cars and dash across the plaza, towards the Bull Ring which is not distant. Then at this moment, on the plaza below, fresh and presentable horses are being harnessed to the shafts that have imprisoned the worn bony creatures of the night shift. All the joy of the morning goes with the sight of those miserable frames of bone and stiffened sinew. Many of them are in the last stagger before being relegated to the dealer who has a contract to furnish the horses to the managers of the Bull Rings. One's resentment rises against the conditions and educational systems or national consciousness that permits these poor beasts after a life of servitude to man to be so ungratefully beaten through to its last breath of usefulness into the arena or more cruel tortures. Six horses are sometimes killed by one bull. I have heard that the vocal cords of the horses are cut in order that they can utter no groans of agony when they are disemboweled.\n\nSevilla is the home of the bullfight. 'Tis said by Spanish historians that the game was established by the Moors in the 12th century which one is loath to accept as a characteristic of the Arabs whose athletic sports developed the delicate arched foot practiced in 25-foot jumps on level ground, and whose closest friends were the Kadischi, or the Kochlani (that more famous race of horses described by Niebuhr as the animals for two thousand years preserved in the pure line from the studs of Solomon and beloved as the devoted steed of battle which rescued fallen masters from the perils of the field).\n\nThe first bullfight seems to have been recorded in 1405 and took place in the Plaza del Triunfo in honor of the birth of a son to the Enfermo Enrique Third of Castile. At that time it was not so degenerate an amusement as it is to-day. Then knights who had never had the advantages of humane education, mounted in full armor on pure-blooded Arab stallions, presented a game where horse, rider, and bull had an equal chance. At that epoch the object of the competition was, if possible, to preserve the steed by quick maneuvers and to give the palfrey itself an opportunity to enter into the spirit of the contest. In 1499 a bullfight was participated in by Cæsar Borgia and Alfonzo, held in the Piazza before St. Peter's in Rome. Alexander Dumas' account of it does not mention horses having been used. In the recent bullfighting exhibitions in Rome (1923) given for the benefit of the mutilati of Italy, horses were covered with padded leather and were buffeted but not injured.\n\nAt this moment Canero, the famous bullfighter of Portugal, is giving hair-raising performances of the medieval methods and is said never to have lost a mount. Of course, the Portuguese game is still a brutal farce, yet it is certainly one step forward in the game as it is conducted in any Plaza del Toro in Spain or South America.\n\nIn a paper that was published in Madrid, I read a little announcement covering two square inches perhaps, reporting that a manager of a bull ring had been fined five hundred pesetas, or in normal exchange one hundred dollars, for having filled the abdomen of a horse with hemp after disembowelment and two days later pushing the animal out again in the ring to be the objective of a charging bull. Inasmuch as several old horses can be bought for five hundred pesetas, this law is said to be seldom broken.\n\nThe Spanish popolo, captivating as it is, like the popolo of Peru, has at the present rating very little conscious duty towards an animal. Only the few have ever thought of extending their love to them. Ethical judgment has never interceded and since their own experience has taught them nothing but the harsh natural laws it is not surprising to find this cruelty. Also a nation under so much artificial restraint must discharge the abderian-blues. Until Spain produces educational leaders in numbers the populace will continue to misuse animals with passion-doped senses. The English and American Humane Workers have representatives in Madrid and in consequence the two princesses, Infantas Doña Beatriz and Doña Cristina, are enrolled in support of the work. Initial steps have been taken to introduce the humane idea into the minds of the school children but that cure will not be very effective until all children are made to go to school long enough to really learn to read and write. It will doubtless be several generations before the principles of the movement ever reach the understanding of the people. In Spain the fruits of knowledge (for the many) are still a forbidden vision and violent emotion is the spice of life and religion. And yet one is not insensible to the change — the slow ferment of a hidden life, or a phase of new orientation that is in the air.\n\nI am told that opposition is growing in Madrid against the Corredo. Two of the chic men of the Capital refuse to be seen at a bullfight. Many Spaniards naturally have that disinclination. No doubt Primo de Rivera will bring some humane action when he gets around to it.5 They from Madrid say that the queen, a true granddaughter of Victoria, wears glasses that blot out the gory scenes she is forced through political measures to witness. The English and American residents I have met have for the most part come to enjoy this Spanish sport.\n\nThe first Sunday I was here, Juan Lafitte, painter and brother of the sculptor who erected the monument to San Fernando in the principal Plaza, asked me to join some other Americans and two Spaniards for the Corredo. \"Señor, I am not a savage,\" was my reply. He was stunned, but he remained polite.\n\nThe matador of that afternoon's performance I believe was Nicanor Villata, who has won the \"Golden Ear\" medal stamped with the spear of the matador piercing the ear of a bull. This medal has been won by only four or five living experts in the arena. Villata has a method all his own. When the toreadors have finished goading he faces the charging animal, evades him and manages to pat him on the flank. Sometimes he feigns sleep lying down in the ring. The bull being misled thinks the game is over, off guard, becomes easy prey and is dispatched with celerity. All this the matador has done within 20 minutes, for if he has not finished on the sound of the bell he is dismissed from the ring in disgrace. Villata has nearly a thousand notches on his matador's spear which is not unglorious for one whose career is yet only four years old . . . with a salary of forty thousand dollars per annum.\n\nAmong other things, Señor Lafitte informed me that by order of the Crown, respectful to sex even to the animals, mares are not permitted to be slaughtered in the bull rings and that only males can be entered.\n\nIn this province are many vacados or training corrals for the fighting bulls. Don Pedro of Larreatequi, forbear of the present Duque de Veragua, established one of the famous bull farms of Andalucía. These fighting bulls are advertised throughout Spain.\n\nLuckily I saw at a cinema not only a bull ranch but the presentation of the Easter Game which opens the season as an established ritual of the Nation. On these occasions His Majesty is said to join the Grandees and populace in risking high stakes on bulls and toreros (toreros being the title for all bullfighters). This picture of the procession de la cuadrilla led by the matador and espadas, presented all the players from the dazzling picadors to the hospital carriage for the wounded, the garnished mule team that drags away the carcasses of bulls and horses.\n\nSuch a contest begins when the king (or mayor) throws down the key to the bull cages, and the bull comes pawing into the arena to meet the red muleta. Sharp spears soon form a halo of streamers about the beast's shoulders. Blood trickles down in a shining solid necklace leaving discolorations in the sand. If the bull is not impatient enough the crowds cry for burning darts and so our helpless fellow creature is worn down by torture and made safe for the espada to deliver the blade between the shoulders to the heart.\n\nFollowing the Easter feasts the Plaza del Toro opens in every town large enough to support one. In villages too small and poor to afford an amphitheater, stakes or lists are built around the main square where the natives watch the ceremonious shedding of blood from the roofs and windows of the surrounding houses. Old horses fortunately are too valuable to be used in these Sunday butcherings. These are exhibitions given by venturesome boys who are anxious to become professionals.\n\nRelative to Sports . . . In an antique shop here I saw a set of eighteenth-century English engravings which depicted not only the disgusting blood lust of the cockfight but also a scene in a bull baiting corral where a dozen or more dogs were being tossed to threads. It is not to be forgotten that bear baiting was the favorite New England Sunday sport until the game was made unlawful by the Puritans principally on the grounds that no one should enjoy himself — especially on Sundays. And considering the cruelty of the fox hunters and the Ingleses who permit the animal to be devoured by the chase-maddened hounds, one must conceded that all the medievalism of to-day does not thrive in Spain. Besides take a look at the dollar-hounds of the U.S.A. and the same snarling-for-power class in other parts of the globe. Furthermore, as to the Corredo, one can attend a bullfight in several towns in the Midi of France, a custom that has come over the borders with a mixed race, but nevertheless countenanced by the French Government. \"So that is that,\" as Schopenhauer has said, exerting himself in his essay on Women.\n\n§\n\nIF you could be with me this morning you would not have to leave the hotel in search of a stage setting for a Spanish play. With me things begin at breakfast time from my window where I am imbibing a great deal that is the life of Sevilla. Being beset by a restless spirit that calls me early, I know that I am the bane of the cook's existence. I regularly ring for coffee about eight o'clock — before the fire is started.\n\nAt this precise moment the Señoras and Señoritas — those I'll wager who have \"had the last word,\" or think they have — are following the angle across the little park on their way to Matins. Nearly all of them wear the mantilla which is light enough in texture to expose beautiful hair.\n\nSpanish women take a great deal of pride in the coiffure. I never saw one that didn't appear to have just come from the piendora. Some of them comb the locks back into straight severe lines to a low Psyche knot, but I think the present styles favor the high coil and many little curls to frame the face. In all cases every little strand is in place, and a little old tradition seems to nest in each fold of the lace that drops from the high comb. Shingling the hair is of course unheard of here.\n\nAnd, my dear, about the same hour an early Andalucíano wearing a tall crowned broad-brimmed felt dashes along in his fringed topped leather carriage driving a span of small, sleekly groomed, brightly harnessed mules of a breed that suggests Royalty and speed! He, too, has some special business at the feet of the Virgin. Maybe her name is not Mary but Carmen! You will forgive my levity when I explain that one of the two \"sparking\" places the women seem to rely upon is the church. Very safe and very conducive to the right temperate forms of yielding!\n\nHow often have I wished for you and the other members of our \"Four by Four.\" I would this instant take you downstairs and push you into a bevy of the energetic and irresistible carnation venders who are ever on the lookout for the stranger. You would eventually tear yourself away — but not without carnations! Then, for this afternoon's diversion we would count on the motivas de la Calle Sierpes, a very narrow center which is always preparing to tempt the tourist and where the Andalucíano shows himself to perfection. There too, under the duster of the book merchant, Sherlock Holmes runs wild with Don Quixote — that embodiment of Spanish psychology of the zenith period of Spain.\n\nCervantes began \"Don\" here in Sevilla when, by reason of debt, he was detained for a year or so in the old prison.\n\nThe Sierpes is a veritable circus at certain hours. Ticket sellers are partout. One is pursued by them. You should hear me trying to say in Spanish, \"No, Señor, I will not see a bullfight.\" After one reaches the hissing state they are discouraged, but another fellow wants you to buy a chance. \"No, thanks,\" I repeat, \"I do not want a fortune — I have no passion for the lotteries,\" — and in the end I buy a chance! In sequence to a few more attacks I've renounced all self-control and also reached the last word of my Spanish vocabulary. One day in desperation I resorted to the word \"caramba\" which for all I know may mean G — D — . Anyway it was just the word I needed for saying that my patience had its limitations and at once I found myself scot-free!\n\nThe Loteria Nacional is a state-wide institution and must be the inspiration of many a castle that never has been and never shall be built. The great Gordo of December 20th, aggregating fifteen million pesetas, is the chance that feeds perennial hope of a fortune in thousands of hearts. 'Tis the subject of conversation from one winter to another. The revenue on tobacco does not net the Spanish Government the returns gathered by the gambling system. Italians too have this craze but not to the madness that is practiced by the Spaniard.\n\nWe were straying along the Sierpes . . .\n\nHere a few days ago I perceived a crowd staring towards a figure that had turned the corner. It was a Señor with a coleta neatly wound in a knob at the back of his skull. As a Sevillana would say, \"Madre de Dios, it was Nacional the Second!\" This torero, famous Lothario over two continents, on the coming Sunday is to deal the estocado (death stroke) through the shoulders of six Miura bulls.6 The Miura is a breed of black, crooked-nosed, narrow-chested beasts, tame in a sapling corral, but so brave and ferocious in the Corredo that matadors are paid extra fees to meet him in battle. Herds of this breed are raised on the famous ranch near Sevilla owned by the Duque de Veragua — a Grandee and the last of the direct descendants of Christopher Columbus. His name appears on the placards announcing the Corredo \"and 8 bulls, colors red and white, from H. E. Duque de Veragua.\"\n\nThe famous \"Nacional\" is reputed to be rich and ready to retire, but popularity holds him in that most vulnerable of spots — the seat of vanity!\n\nHe, as I was saying, came down the Sierpes disporting himself. Agile as a serpent he glided through the crowds, contained and with the assurance of an espada who understands the hearts of women as he knows the nature of bulls. Not being content with the stir he had made on the streets the Idol entered one of the big coffee shops taking with him a trailing atmosphere of red-cloaked capeadores and explosive banderillas.\n\nAnd on the Sierpes no one is as much engaged as Señor \"Armado.\" Wearing his Fedora at a defiant yet indifferent slant, he struts along in an easy exulting manner, his eyes making momentary dessert of every passing woman. The duennas pretend to keep the weather eye on their fair damsels, but what can a chaperone see in the smiles of the Señoritas when the young ladies are walking ahead? Thus it is arranged for the heart smasher to put into service the prerogatives of his sex. In fact flirting is the first thing expected of the Spanish men and so the lure and the lured parade on!\n\nI have been searching for a shawl, but so far have not found anything that would enhance green eyes without wrecking the purse. Most of them are expensive according to the weight of silk and embroidery. I watched two American men become involved in the purchase of two newly manufactured shawls (of pattern and colors designed for the flashing beauty peculiar to dark regular types) hoping their selections would not eclipse the ladies who were destined to wear them.\n\nAccompanied by an M. P. and his wife from Cardiff (the last week in May), I attended a party where I had the opportunity of admiring shawls worn by the women of Sevilla who enjoyed the feasts and dances given in honor of St. Hyacinth. The fête was held before a temporary altar lighted by hundreds of candles and erected in an old court in Triana, the ancient part of Sevilla that is called the Gypsy Quarter. In a huge square surrounded by tables, Spanish maidens in the Provincial costume were keeping time with tambourines and castanets, clicking heels and swaying to the rhythms of the Provincial dances. A fortunate few, those who had reached the dancing stage of courtship, were reeling around in the arms of their lovers. Otherwise the girls danced sedately in groups while the stout duennas, looking on from their places at the tables, were discreetly libating champagne or having just another little cup of chocolate while her Lord husband, bibbling his everlasting canes of Manzanilla, maintained a perfect decorum.\n\nNo Americans were monopolizing the floor — for once! And only two others were present. The sensation of the evening was the appearance of three popular actresses who came unaccompanied. Several unattached Spanish gentlemen (one whom I knew) asked them for dance numbers. They appeared to have just come from the footlights and were very highly \"made-up\" after the Spanish idea of much black around the eyes, white faces and carmen lips. Like many of the other women they wore the \"velo,\" that coquettish arrangement of the red rose and mantilla. Their jeweled hands fluttered the most delicate and priceless fans. Not a single one of them smoked. I have yet to see the Spanish woman smoke, — but perhaps that is because I have not been to the low dance halls.\n\nThis fête was in the essentials like all the other social affairs of the people of Sevilla — very gay but restrained. 'Twas a fitting opportunity for displaying the feminine foibles and therefore a little market for prospectors of wives.\n\nOn an elevated platform — a very elevated one indeed — the Infanta Marie Louisa, with her blonde daughter, sat good-naturedly among a party of attendants from the court. I should have been delighted to see Her Alteza fall into the enticing steps of the Agarrado which is unquestionably adequate exercise for reducing. The Agarrado I think ought to be mastered by anyone who can do the Charleston!\n\nNow don't tell me that you are doing the Charleston too! With cutting your hair \"to experience the psychology of change and to understand some of the reactions of the modern flapper\" — I will not only fail to recognize \"Alice\" but the bust I made of Alice will surely be far out of date.\n\n§\n\nLATTERLY the heat has been too much! I shall not risk remaining in Andalucía until July. This afternoon I nearly collapsed on the Alameda. The Alameda being an avenue of commonweal known as the Alameda de Hercules is so called after the two Corinthian columns that were supposed to have been left in this territory by the Roman conquerors. My mind was hazily wandering around after some Julius (or Theodoric) when the shrill note of a rooster called me back to the local color. As my eye prospected around for the gentleman I wish you might have seen what pranced from the gutter to acclaim public approval. It was a perfectly shameless remnant of the cockfight plucked of all lustrous plumage of natural illustriousness, but solemnly bearing the wounds of Victory.\n\nI had never seen a fighting cock after the match. I never wish to see one again either before or after the fray. Although his injuries were healing, a few drab wing and tail feathers and the terrible pair of spurs, presented an altogether too disgusting personality to risk snapping my fingers before.\n\nThis bird had escaped from some near-by training establishment. An Englishman who has visited these places tells me that this game is a most scientifically conducted amusement among the Spaniards. Innumerable cocks are kept in cages within the rooms of a regular house having an azotea (roof) for sunning, and garden for scratching. Perches are placed in the boxes only at the roosting hour and removed in the mornings. A hundred birds or more take their course in training and are matched in pairs with the same number of birds of another establishment. Seven pairs are allowed to brutalize one another at a single performance, each contest usually lasting from ten to twenty minutes. Oh, I have learned heaps from the English Sportsman. The fighting weight ranges from three pounds twelve ounces to five pounds two ounces. The object of the training is to keep the cocks within that weight, and therefore they are weighed each day and fed accordingly.\n\nBut the preparation for the last hour begins first with producing fighting-blooded stock. Breed, as to color, being of no particular importance, lineage alone is the point carefully guarded. Training, in cases of overweight, compels the cock to fight his weaker brothers that have for one reason or another been discarded for blood tasting in the sham battles. Sometimes the spurs of two-year-old gamesters are put into gloves and allowed to hack about in the training bin without being able to pierce each other. The spurs are usually cut away, the stubs serving for attaching on other spurs of steel which assures a more gory showing. If a cock naturally loses his spur in the act of fighting a new one is immediately wired on. A cock of extraordinary hereditary fighting ability and constitution sells for around seventy-five or one hundred dollars, but the everyday fodder for the cockpit are worth three to five dollars each.\n\nAt these tournaments the stakes made by the two establishments range from $200 to $500. The gate returns being divided between the owner of the cockpit and the establishments matching the birds.\n\nThere is a great deal of cooperative betting. Cheating is said sometimes to stir an audience. A greased cock or a cock with its spurs poisoned with garlic (which causes the wounds to swell) is considered not the squarest sort of sport for a Sunday afternoon. For the reason that the audience wishes to see a fair fight the formality of running the spur into lemon after the fowl is weighed dispels all doubt of this kind of cheating. The battle proceeds with each bird trying to push his spur into the brain of his antagonist.\n\nThe cock I have seen to-day had his comb and crests cut off. He had been plucked about the neck and breast and shorn of heavy feathers, the idea being that the bird must be kept cool and not have anything about the head onto which the other can lay hold. Unbeautiful beyond description he was a walking symbol of the national taste for blood or at least the taste of the majority of citizens promenading along the Alameda.\n\nThe Alameda, a parkway set between two drives, attracts nearly the whole of Sevilla during the street fairs where (in season) a galaxy of performing stars light up the midway from dusk to dawn. Anyone who relishes the sight of dwarfs, fire eaters and monstrosities, can usually find them spangling there.\n\nHad'st thou been here we might just now have had a little tilting. We always clash on the nuances des mots. I see a word in the above paragraph that you will find très provoquant. We begin about like this . . . \"Nancy, why do say the 'common people'\"? (Nancy explaining) \"I use it in a sense of world-wideness, in a sense of understanding and feeling . . . born equal if you will have it so . . . even sisters and brothers . . . but nevertheless persons who have little in common with me when they can enjoy a cockfight.\" As you once very inconsistently put it \"They were born on the other side of the tracks!\"\n\nWhewwww. As I have already remarked it is a warm evening! More anon.\n\n§\n\nI RECEIVED the Marcus Aurelius clipping"
