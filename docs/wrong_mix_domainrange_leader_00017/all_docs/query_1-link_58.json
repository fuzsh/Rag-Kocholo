[Paraphrase.] I am informed from reliable sources that the Spanish Government plans an oil monopoly which may in the near future be put into effect suddenly by Royal decree. Details are not available but such a procedure would be in accord with the attitude of obstruction and opposition on the part of the Government toward all foreign business interests in Spain. [End paraphrase.]"
