        "text": "The collection is arranged into the following categories: articles, brochures, letters, and other minor works; source materials, reviews, and related items for Sinclair's major published works arranged alphabetically by the title of the work; broadsides (posters); audio tapes; photographs; sound recordings; memorabilia. In listing the source materials in Boxes XIX to XXIV, an effort was made to maintain as nearly as possible the divisions which were conceived by Upton Sinclair in the preparation of the World's End Series. In some instances this has required unusual departures from a strictly logical treatment of the source material. The following original headings of Sinclair (the new headings in the Short Title List, to which they correspond, are listed in parentheses), and the sources which are entered under each, quite faithfully preserve the author's intentions and organization: Art (World's End Series-Sources-Art); Cartels (World's End Series-Sources-Cartels), from which was separated the whole section entitled World's End Series-Sources-Post-World War II-Germany; Gold (World's End Series-Sources-Gold); Hitler Attempts (World's End Series-Sources-World War II-Holland and Belgium); Invasions of France and Germany (World's End Series-Sources-World War II-Invasion of France and Germany); North Africa-Early (World's End Series-Sources-World War II-North Africa); Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (World's End Series-Sources-World War II-Scandinavia); Riviera (World's End Series-Sources-Riviera, France-Maps and guidebooks), from which was removed a map of the D-Day beaches, now in Box XX, no. 12.; Smart Set (World's End Series-World War II-Smart Set); Technology (World's End Series-Sources-Technology), from which was removed two newspaper reviews of The Cup of Gold (1915); War and Brutality (World's End Series-Sources-Political Prisoners), from which was removed Gottesman A586 and A643. The main exceptions to these principles of organizations occurred initially with six envelopes of source materials with the following Sinclair labels: Corrections, Europe Misc, Finished, LB Misc, Lanny used, and orig notes used Lanny Budd notes used (sic). All of this material was integrated into three new headings: World's End Series-Sources-World War II, World's End Series-Sources-World War II-Social Life and Customs. Because of the nature of the source material in the six envelopes and the lack of any apparent rationale in their disposition and arrangement it was not feasible to attempt to regroup the materials under their original Sinclair headings after their significance was ascertained. Also, the materials labelled by Sinclair as Atomic Bombs and Los Alamos were combined under the new heading World's End Series-Source-Post-World War II-Atomic Energy. Envelope(s) with an original label(s) have been used wherever possible to house the last item(s) under the major divisions in the Short Title List to which they refer."
