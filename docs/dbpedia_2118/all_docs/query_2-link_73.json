        "text": "A TIME TO BE BORN – Ecclesiastes 3:1-4\n\nAnthony Lavonne Merritt, affectionately known as “Mertz” was born November 22, 1965 to the late Patricia Corprew Merritt and Lee Andrew Merritt Jr. Anthony was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He was the eldest sibling to Rosalynn \"Rose\" and Darryl Merritt.\n\nA TIME TO LEARN: ISAIAH 1:17\n\nAnthony obtained his early elementary education from Park Elementary and Carver Intermediate Schools in Chesapeake, VA. The family moved from Chesapeake, VA to Norfolk, VA, “aka Berkley, VA” which allowed Anthony to experience Lake Taylor Middle. Anthony was a proud Lake Taylor High School Titan and graduated with the class of 1985.\n\nA TIME TO SERVE: Proverbs 18:16\n\nAnthony matriculated from an apprentice student to become a master welder and pipefitter. He began his career at the Newport News Shipyard. Anthony was presented an opportunity to share his welding skills in New Orleans. While in New Orleans, Anthony gained employment with Avondale Shipyard where he set up a life for him, his wife Kenyatta, and children.\n\nA TIME TO REFLECT: Philippians 4:8\n\nAnthony loved people. He was the life of the party! He loved dancing and loved participating in the New Orleans Second Line. He was known as the Dancing Machine and often responded to, “Dance for me Gator!” Anthony was a die-hard Chicago Bears fan. Playing the lottery and slot machines was Anthony’s favorite past time. He smoked a million and one cigarettes a day, drank a thousand and one beers, but that was life and love for him. To know Anthony was to love Anthony. His infectious and distinct laugh could be heard and still heard by all! His personality coupled with his laugh and love for everyone will forever be treasured by all.\n\nA TIME TO DEPART: Hebrews 9:27\n\nOn the eve of January 9, in Chalmette, Louisiana, Anthony Lavonne Merritt slipped away peacefully into the hands of our Lord. Beside him lay his Bible and his glasses.\n\nA TIME TO MOURN: ECCLESTIASTES 3:4\n\nAnthony was preceded in death by his mother, Reverend Patricia Corprew Merritt; grandparents, Meredith Corprew Jackson, Lloyd Corprew Jr., Lee Andrew Merritt Sr.\n\nAnthony leaves with saddened hearts but fond memories the mother of his children, Esper Kenyatta Jordan (Norfolk, VA); sons, Anthony Jordan (Meraux, LA), Tyquan Jordan (Kristian) (Laplace, LA); father, Lee A. Merritt Jr. (Norfolk, VA); sister, Dr. Rosalynn Sanderlin (Vernon) (Chesapeake, VA); brother, Darryl Merritt (Norfolk, VA); grandchildren, Ski ‘Marie Jordan, Cameron Jordan, Kamau Jordan (LA); nieces, Fredecia Hawkins (Chesapeake, VA), Rosharia Lane, (Delmar, MD), Amina Merritt (Chicago, ILL); great-nieces, Jazilynn and Ava Hawkins; nephews, Darryl and DeAngelo Wilkins (Norfolk, VA); great aunt, Deborah Corprew Butler; aunts Henrietta Corprew Vann, Evangela Corprew Baines; uncles, Meredith Corprew, Theodore Merritt (Brenda), Clarence Ferebee (Ida), Gregory Chapman (Darlene); god-daughter, Caprice Howard; a host of special cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends both near and far."
