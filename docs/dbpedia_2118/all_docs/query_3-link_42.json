Based on print media published exclusively before the year 1965, his drawings also weave imaginary celebrities into their narratives, ultimately evolving into a self-contained world from which their author is emphatically absent.

Text by Martin Hellmold, Harry Lehmann, Stephan Berg.\n\nThe drawings of Marcel van Eeden (born 1965) depict seemingly familiar images of decisive or epiphanic moments. Based on photographs culled from vintage magazines and periodicals, which the artist finds in used bookstores and archives, these graphite drawings are often counterposed with captions and assembled in series that further heighten the implication of a buried or occluded narrative. This first comprehensive monograph on van Eeden makes a selection of over 500 drawings, including The Zurich Trial 1 series and the recent Witness for the Prosecution cycle and offers a first overview of Marcel van Eeden's oeuvre.\n\nPUBLISHER\n\nDuMont\n\nBOOK FORMAT\n\nHardcover, 10.25 x 10.5 in. / 344 pgs / 542 color.\n\nPUBLISHING STATUS\n\nPub Date 2/28/2010\n\nOut of print\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nD.A.P.

Wiegand\n\nLife and Work\n\nPublished by Hatje Cantz.\n\nEssay by Massimiliano Gioni.\n\nThe Dutch artist Marcel van Eeden has done a drawing a day for more than a decade, since 1993. Each one interprets photographs or text from before he was born in 1965, source material he gathers through a network of vintage book dealers, archives and libraries. His thousands of small-format works show people and places at once anachronistic and ready to spring to life at any moment; they make the time before his birth seem present in front of the viewer's eyes, as though through the looking glass into a period film. Van Eeden calls his life's work an \"encyclopedia\" of his death--he imagines a time before he existed in order to imagine a time after he is gone. This collection of approximately 140 of his virtuosic drawings describes a fictitious biography for K. M. Wiegand, who, history verifies, was actually a botanist.\n\nPUBLISHER\n\nHatje Cantz\n\nBOOK FORMAT\n\nHardcover, 6.75 x 9.5 in. / 160 pgs / 140 duotones.\n\nPUBLISHING STATUS\n\nPub Date 8/15/2006\n\nOut of print\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nD.A.P.

The only condition to which van Eeden holds himself is that the primary image must have been made at least one year before 1965, the year of his birth. So far, van Eeden has created thousands of these small-format, diaristic charcoal and pencil drawings, which he describes together as, \"an encyclopedia of my death.\" This substantial first monograph airs the mystery surrounding Celia, the protagonist of van Eeden's latest cycle of works, and also features a representative selection of early drawings.\n\nPUBLISHER\n\nHatje Cantz\n\nBOOK FORMAT\n\nHardcover, 9.5 x 6.75 in. / 204 pgs / 170 duotone.\n\nPUBLISHING STATUS\n\nPub Date 10/1/2006\n\nOut of print\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nD.A.P.
