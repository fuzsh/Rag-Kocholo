The British series Demob follows two war buddies trying to make it in showbiz. They're Martin Clunes and Griff Rhys Jones, and they're determined to resurrect their old performances and land themselves on BBC radio. They're a daring duo, but our hearts and parts belong to Samantha Janus and Amanda Redman, the delicious Demob dames who have us fingering our remotes and wanking our bangers into mash.
