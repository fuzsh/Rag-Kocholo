        "text": "Well, what about this one. ``Martin, you smoke a pipe in the film. Did your father smoke a pipe?''\n\n``As a matter of fact he did,'' Clunes said, perking up. ``In fact, that was his pipe I used in the film. The one that killed him.'' When the actor was eight years of age, his old man died of lung cancer. And next again. Enough about his father.\n\n``Did you get a chance to fly in the old Spitfires?''\n\n``Well, no.''\n\n``Did no-one take you up in one?''\n\n``No. They're Spitfires.''\n\n``Yes?''\n\n``Well, they're only one-seater aircraft . . . . Mind you, I did get to sit in one.''\n\nThrough it all, Clunes remains the consummate pro, polite and charming in ever increasing circles. The first thing you notice about him is the fact that what you see on television is what you get in real life. Here is a man possessed of the kind of looks which suggest that God has a wicked sense of humour. The actor is no oil painting. He has the kind of rubbery face which could win him first prize in a girning contest. And huge ears. Enormous sticky-out ears.\n\nStill, he should worry. That face like a half-chewed caramel has done him no harm at all. He is best known these days as Gary, the epitome of the two-pints-of-lager-and-a-quick-shag New Lad in Men Behaving Badly. Last year he directed and starred in his own respectably successful film, Staggered.\n\nHe has also appeared in good movies (The Russia House) and bad movies (Carry On Columbus). And then there is his television work - dramas like Demob (in which he starred alongside Griff Rhys Jones) Jeeves and Wooster, Boon, Morse, Lovejoy, Moving Story, and the television adaptation of An Evening With Gary Lineker. The face obviously fits.\n\nOver Here, which is being shown over two nights during the Easter Weekend, tells the story of a squadron of young RAF fighter pilots and the tensions which arise between them and the newly-arrived US Bomber crews. It also stars Samuel and Timothy West, Jack Shepherd, and Geraldine James.\n\nJohn Sullivan, the man who created Only Fools and Horses, has written a witty script but it is a genuinely funny performance by Clunes which really lifts the film and makes it something more than just another wartime tale of Anglo-Yankee rivalry. As Group Captain Cyril Barker he delivers a truly memorable comic performance.\n\nHere is a character whose mustachioed upper lip remains steadfastly stiff - until anyone mentions the word ``Luftwaffe''. Then comes the involuntary (and hilarious) twitch.\n\n``I suppose it was just a question of entering into Robert Lindsay territory. . . and everyone else who has gone before in the twitching stakes. I don't know why but it just makes you laugh.'' he explains.\n\nClunes, as if to prove perhaps that he's not just a pretty face, set up his own production company to make the aforementioned Staggered. It was, by the strict terms of the act, a hit movie. However, he points out that despite its success it has not yet returned a penny profit to him.\n\n``I understand that it will only start to make money when it gets shown on terrestrial television. But I didn't do it to get rich. I would never use my own money to make a film. It takes so much money to do it and I'm not that rich, to be honest,'' he says.\n\nn Over Here will be screened on BBC1 on Sunday and Monday evenings.\n\nALLAN LAING"
