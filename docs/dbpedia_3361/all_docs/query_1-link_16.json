        "text": "Martin Clunes has landed a new ITV role following the conclusion of Doc Martin last year – and it sounds a world away from the comedy-drama series.\n\nThe actor will star in thriller Out There, where he will play \"a farmer confronted with dark forces seeping into his rural community\" – namely county lines drug dealing.\n\nThe six-part series is also set to star The Queen's Gambit's Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Outlander's Mark Lewis Jones, Save Me's Natalia Kostrzewa, Midsomer Murders' Carly-Sophia Davies and McDonald & Dodds' Gerran Howell, and has been written by Manhunt's Ed Whitmore and Marc Evans.\n\nRelated: Doc Martin star Martin Clunes reveals why the show is ending\n\nClunes's character Nathan Williams is \"a man who runs a farm which has been in his family for generations, caught in a numbing rhythm of work and grief following the death of his wife, Sabine, two years previously,\" the synopsis reads.\n\n\"A single parent to teenager Johnny, played by Louis Ashbourne Serkis, Nathan is uniquely placed and possesses enough pent-up energy to take on the gangs that threaten to engulf his son,\" it continues.\n\nNathan then \"embarks on a personal journey that will take him ever further out of his comfort zone into a dark alternative world as he fights to protect his family, his homestead and his legacy\".\n\nRelated: Doc Martin Christmas special fixes series finale's biggest problem\n\n\"He’s missed all the clues that the country idyll around him has been fatally compromised, contaminated by waves of criminality spreading and mutating virus-like from the city.\n\n\"Now Nathan must accept that the rustic atmosphere of his childhood is long gone, replaced by something altogether more edgy and perilous. And the only way for Nathan, our hero, to survive in this brave new world is to learn the rules and fight back…\".\n\nClunes said: \"I’m very happy to be working with Marc Evans and Ed Whitmore again after the success of Manhunt. Out There couldn’t be more different from Doc Martin. It’s pretty dark, but definitely a story worth telling.”\n\nDoc Martin came to an end last December after 18 years, with its final episode airing as a Christmas special.\n\nOut There will air on ITV1 and ITVX.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
