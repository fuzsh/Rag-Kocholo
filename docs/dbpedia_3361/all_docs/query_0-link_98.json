Beaton, this feature-length pilot stars Ashley Jensen (Extras) as the PR pro-turned-amateur sleuth. After moving from London to a quaint village in the Cotswolds, Agatha discovers she has a knack for solving crimes when she must prove herself innocent in the death of the quiche competition judge after her entry kills him.

Blackstone premieres in the US on 1 August 2016 on Netflix.\n\nInspector Lewis: Season 8 (Final)\n\nStateside viewers will soon bid a fond farewell to one of British TV’s most beloved detective duos, Robbie Lewis (Kevin Whately) and James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), as Inspector Lewis comes to a close. As they investigate three new murder cases under a new boss (Steve Toussaint, Scott & Bailey), Lewis must prove his worth as a consultant to the Oxford Police and keep his relationship with Laura from going off the rails, while Hathaway must face the inevitable conclusion of his father’s declining health.

Costarring in the six episodes are Lenny Henry (Chef!), Cara Theobold (Downton Abbey), Elizabeth Berrington (Stella), Melanie Hill (Coronation Street), and Richard Rankin (The Crimson Field).

(Photo © Rollem Productions, courtesy of Acorn TV)\n\nJanet King: The Invisible Wound (Series 2) (Australia)\n\nSeries 2 of this hit Aussie legal/political drama opens two years after Series 1 (see below), and finds Janet (Marta Dusseldorp, A Place to Call Home, Jack Irish) still grieving the death of her partner Ash, the victim of an unsolved murder, while heading a high-profile royal commission into serious firearm crime. As she and her team piece together how illegal guns enter the country, they discover evidence related to Ash’s murder and become targets for criminals and politicians alike.

Hosted by Robin Ellis, who played Ross in the first television adaptation of Winston Graham‘s “Poldark Saga” historical novels, this special uses interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, and program clips to explore the themes of the series and Poldark as hero. (Photo courtesy of Robert Viglasky/Mammoth Screen)\n\nJanet King: The Enemy Within (Series 1) (Australia)\n\nIn Series 1 of Janet King, Marta Dusseldorp plays the eponymous Senior Crown Prosecutor who, after taking a year of maternity leave, returns to work at the Department of Public Prosecutions, only to lose her first case back on the job. Undaunted and out to prove she isn’t off her game, she pours herself into a controversial case involving a senior-ranking police officer. However, conspiracy and corruption threaten her career, her family, and her life.\n\nNON-PREMIERE PROGRAMS ADDED TO STREAMING SERVICES\n\nDemob\n\nCaptain Ian Deasey (Griff Rhys Jones, Alias Smith and Jones) and Lance Corporal Dick Dobson (Martin Clunes, Doc Martin) had a “good war,” having spent much of World War II entertaining troops with their bawdy stage routines. But with the war ending, they’re being “demobbed” — demobilized and sent back into civilian life. Sounds great, but after serving four years in the North African desert, adjusting to peacetime London comes with a renewed longing for the stage. Demob begins streaming today, 1 August 2016, on Acorn TV.\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nIn this two-part miniseries, war and revolution bring poet and physician Yury Zhivago (Hans Matheson, The Tudors) together with the beautiful Lara (Keira Knightley, Pride & Prejudice), his muse and all-consuming passion. But both are haunted — Yury by guilt over his betrayal of his beloved wife Tonya (Alexandra Maria Lara, Bukow and König), and Lara by fear of Victor Komarovsky (Sam Neill, And Then There Were None), the powerful man who means to have her any way he can. Doctor Zhivago begins streaming today, 1 August 2016, on Acorn TV.\n\nQI: Series 7\n\nHost Stephen Fry, permanent panelist Alan Davies, and guests panelists, including David Tennant (Doctor Who), David Mitchell (Upstart Crow), and Sue Perkins (The Great British Baking Show), take on topics starting with the letter G in this hilarious panel game show. Watch to see who gets the most points for their “quite interesting,” if not correct, answers about gardens, gifts, gravity, and more. QI: Series 7 begins streaming today, 1 August 2016, on Acorn TV.\n\nSummer School (Documentary Compilation)\n\nWhether you gravitated toward math and science in school or not, there’s no denying they form the foundation of nearly everything we do and reveal the beauty and mystery of the world around us. This curated collection of documentaries — including The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms, Calculating Ada, and Secrets of the Universe — delve into lives of celebrated minds in these fields and show how their work affects us even today. The Summer School documentaries begin streaming Monday, 8 August 2016, on Acorn TV.\n\nBedtime\n\nSet during the half-hour before bedtime, this dramedy series goes behind closed doors to give viewers a fly-on-the-wall listen of the nighttime conversations between husbands and wives, fathers and sons, and more. It features an all-star ensemble cast that includes Alun Armstrong (New Tricks), Sienna Miller (The Girl), Claire Skinner (Outnumbered), Stephen Tomkinson (DCI Banks), and Timothy West (EastEnders), amongst others. Acorn TV begins streaming the complete Bedtime starting with Series 1 on Monday, 15 August 2016, followed by Series 2 on 22 August and Series 3 on 29 August.\n\nPorterhouse Blue\n\nAdapted from Tom Sharpe’s bestselling novel of the same name, this four-part miniseries stars David Jason (A Touch of Frost) as Skullion, head porter of (fictional) Porterhouse College, whose 500-plus years of tradition mostly involve decadent banquets, drunkenness, and undistinguished scholarship. Crackling with dry wit and bristling with satirical barbs, this send-up of Cambridge life costars Ian Richardson (House of Cards trilogy). Porterhouse Blue begins streaming Monday, 29 August 2016, on Acorn TV.\n\n(All photos in this section courtesy of Acorn TV.)\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 6\n\nJon Snow (still) knows nothing, and he’s not dead. (This cannot have been a spoiler, given all the hype.) As for the Starks, Lannisters, Boltons, Greyjoys, and Tyrells, the Mother of Dragons, the High Sparrow and the Faith Militant, the Faceless Men, the Hound, et al, some of them know and do more than others in the quest for the Iron Throne. Ultimately, the sixth season of this fantasy drama, based on George R.R. Martin‘s “A Song of Ice and Fire” novels, has women doing it for themselves and one of the most rewarding comeuppances in the series’ history. Game of Thrones: Season 6 begins streaming today, 1 August 2016, on Amazon Video.\n\nJack Irish: Season 1 (Australia)\n\nGuy Pearce (Memento) reprises his role as the eponymous private investigator and debt collector in the first full series of this Aussie noir drama inspired by the bestselling “Jack Irish” novels by Peter Temple.

Murdoch Mysteries: Season 9 begins streaming on 1 August 2016 on Amazon Video.\n\nHoudini and Doyle\n\nThis mystery series stars Michael Weston (House) as Harry Houdini and Stephen Mangan (Episodes) as Arthur Conan Doyle, frenemies called on by New Scotland Yard to help solve inexplicable cases.

Houdini & Doyle begins streaming Monday, 8 August 2016, on Hulu.\n\nThe Bastard Executioner\n\nSet against the backdrop of political upheaval in early 14th-century Wales, this historical drama (which I love) follows Wilkin Brattle (Lee Jones, Home and Away), a Welsh warrior knight who assumes the identity of a journeyman executioner after receiving a divine message.
