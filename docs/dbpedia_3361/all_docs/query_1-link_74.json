        "text": "Filming is underway in Wales on Out There, a new ITV drama starring Martin Clunes about county lines and the rise of rural crime.\n\nThe six-part thriller is from writers Ed Whitmore and Marc Evans; the latter directs along with Philippa Langdale. The producers are Philippa Braithwaite for Buffalo Pictures and Evie Bergson-Korn.\n\nClunes plays Nathan, now running the generations-old family farm. Widowed two years ago, Nathan is challenged by dark forces as an insidious crime wave sweeps across his rural community.\n\nLouis Ashbourne Serkis co-stars as his teenage son Johnny; Mark Lewis Jones, Natalia Kostrzewa, Carly-Sophia Davies and Gerran Howell are among the supporting cast; the drama is supported by Creative Wales.\n\nClunes said: “I’m very happy to be working with Marc Evans and Ed Whitmore again after the success of Manhunt. Out There couldn’t be more different from Doc Martin. It’s pretty dark, but definitely a story worth telling.”\n\nWhitmore added: “County lines is a particularly vicious and ruthless wave of drug dealing that uses fear and violence to coerce, often vulnerable, young people into working as runners and dealers. It has become a serious and rapidly increasing problem across the whole of the UK, so it felt like an important and timely story to tell.”\n\n“I’ve always been fascinated by the notion of things being hidden in plain sight and the way in which different social worlds can co-exist cheek-by-jowl until, one day, they collide. The fundamental premise of Out There – a widowed farmer who discovers that his son has fallen foul of county lines – immediately spoke to me as a story I wanted to tell.”\n\nEvans commented: “We are thrilled to have the support of Creative Wales to produce Out There in my in my home country. We are able to explore beautiful and rarely seen areas around the Black Mountains and to use local talent for our cast and crew.”"
