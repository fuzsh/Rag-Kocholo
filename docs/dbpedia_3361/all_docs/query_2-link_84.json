        "text": "I hope the members of 3T make some money out of this and can buy some new clothes. The poor loves have obviously no choice currently but to wear 'hand me downs' from some grossly over weight relatives by the look of it.\n\n1\n\nPerseverance was the first single from the new Terrorvision album Regular Urban Survivors.\n\nPerseverance will not chart for another 3 weeks - they will be back when it does\n\n0\n\nWeek 3 of 5 at number 1 for Spaceman - its sales were going down fast but still comfortably ahead of the chasing pack - in fact an 85% lead over 3T now at number 2.\n\nSales the previous week were 129,000 - down over a third from last week.\n\n2\n\nThis legendary clip of Rod Stewart, The Faces and John Peel came from the episode on the 30th September 1971.\n\nRod and Peely were good mates - John having played Rod a lot on his radio shows - in fact, Rod and The Faces turned up at John's wedding.\n\nRod insisted that John appear on stage for this performance of Maggie May - this annoyed the Musicians Union as Peely was not a member.\n\nIn Top of the Pops history, Maggie May featured 18 times in total on the show\n\nNext week's presenters for the 1996 shows will be Justine Frischman from Elastica and Lisa I'Anson.\n\n3"
