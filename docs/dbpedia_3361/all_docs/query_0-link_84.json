        "text": "DENHOLM ELLIOTT QUOTE: \"I like actors - such as Margaret Rutherford and Peter Lorre - who aren't afraid to over-act like real people. When I take a job I can always come up with ten different ways of doing the part. But I'll always choose the flashiest one. You've got to dress the window a bit.\"\n\nJOHN KEATS QUOTE: \"You speak of Lord Byron and me; there is this great difference between us. He describes what he sees I describe what I imagine. Mine is the hardest task\".\n\nWhen ‘Ann Veronica’ finished I still had about four weeks to go before call-up when a lifeline was given to me by Bill Bruce who was the Chief Electrician at the New Theatre, now known as the Coward.\n\nHe employed me as a showman working a temporary switchboard. The switchboard was in the flies and my cue sheets were propped up against the fly rail. One night I brushed against them and they fluttered down across the stage in the middle of the performance of ‘Love’s Labours Lost’ which starred Michael Redgrave. I don’t think the cast were too happy.\n\nIncidentally the New theatre was one of the last theatres in the West End which contained water dimmers. These were tall cylindrical pots situated on the fly floor with a solution inside and a conductor, which by a series of wires, travelled up and down in the solution, thereby reducing or increasing the intensity of the current, which dimmed or increased the stage lighting. There was a novel method of topping these pots up. The fly men used to urinate into them - so much for a piece of theatrical history.\n\nThe day arrived for my call up. I bade a fond farewell to Bill Bruce who said that he would find me work in the theatre if I cared to coincide my leaves with times that his electrical staff were taking their holidays. The landlady I was staying with said she would store my suitcase for me; so there I was, relatively secure for the future and ready to do my duty for King and country.\n\nI arrived at the transit camp where I was kitted out, issued with my service number, given intelligence tests and interviewed, with a view as to which particular branch of the Royal Air Force I would be placed in. When asked for my preference, since I was feeling rather bolshie at what I considered to be a complete waste of two years of my time, I replied, ‘drill instructor or military policeman’. I got neither; in their wisdom they decided I would be a radar mechanic\n\nAt the end of the week I attended my first pay parade. We marched in as a squad and formed three ranks in front of the paying officer. They called out our name and then we had to call out the last three digits of our service number and say, ‘Sir’. We then marched smartly forward to the paying officer’s desk, saluted, and we were handed our pay which in my case was the princely sum of 25p. I thought to myself, all this bullshit on a pay parade for 25p. If they had been giving me a pound they would have wanted a march past!\n\nTogether with my new found fortune I was dispatched to RAF Bridgenorth which was my square bashing or basic training camp. When I arrived there I was issued with a rifle and bayonet. The next eight weeks were spent learning to shoot the rifle, fire a machine gun and bayonet suspended sacks of sand. This was the light side of the training. The rest was marching and drilling known as square bashing, blancoing and polishing not only my equipment, but everything within sight - the floor, the stove, the bedsprings, the coal and scraping the wooden seats of the latrines with a razor blade. I never actually got to do the famous one, which was given as a punishment. That was to scrub the parade ground with a toothbrush!\n\nI was billeted in a metal and wooden hut with twenty-one other recruits all from varying walks of life; some really hard nuts and some sensitive and retiring boys. As always, when a diverse group of people are thrown together, one or two people try to take control. If you are a retiring boy, you are going to be bullied. In order not to be put in that particular category I had to fight one of the hard nuts. I guess it was a draw, and after that they left me alone.\n\nAll the bullshit that went on was of course to make sure that the recruits never had an idle moment, and that they would obey any command no matter how silly it seemed, without hesitation. The system worked, and it instilled in those that needed it a sense of discipline. Some people say that it’s a pity we don’t still have National Service as it may help to solve the problems of juvenile delinquency. However what National Service did, was to remove the vast majority of eighteen to twenty year old men from the civilian population, and keep them employed in almost prison-like circumstances. Naturally, if you removed the same number of eighteen to twenty year olds from the current civilian population, it would reduce the crime statistics correspondingly.\n\nBy the time people reach the age of eighteen, they are either delinquent or they aren’t. You could try and put a fine gloss over it by giving them military training, but I believe they would still be delinquent at heart. Personally, I believe parents or single parents who do not instill a sense of responsibility and discipline is basically the cause of delinquency. Civilised behaviour does not come naturally to a large section of the human race; it has to be instilled. I suppose I shouldn’t be throwing stones in my particular glasshouse, since I was a bit of a delinquent myself. Fortunately I managed to overcome this by being involved in something which I loved - the theatre.\n\nEnd of basic training - front row third from right\n\nReady to serve King and Country\n\nWhen we finally passed out from our square bashing camp, RAF Bridgenorth, we were posted to the various camps where we would learn our trade. As I was to be a radar mechanic, I was posted to RAF Yatesbury where there were 3,500 other airmen, most of whom were being taught to be an electrician, radar operator or radar mechanic.\n\nMy billet was once again shared with twenty-one other people. The hut had an iron stove in the centre and each of us had a metal locker. Our metal beds had steel springs, a horse hair pillow and three horse hair filled slabs, 2 ft x 2 ft and about 3 inches deep known as biscuits, which when placed together formed your mattress. Not very comfortable, but during the square bashing we were kept so busy I slept like a baby when I was at Bridgenorth, but not quite so soundly at Yatesbury.\n\nIn the hut with me, the other recruits who were all training to be radar mechanics like me were regular airmen - not two year conscripts, but regular long serving, usually five years. I don’t know why I was selected, (probably something to do with the electrical training I’d had in the theatre). Normally they didn’t train many national servicemen to be radar mechanics because it was a costly exercise and took at least six months, so when the course was over, the national servicemen were only around for just over a year to perform their duties. No sensitive boys in the hut this time - but the same problems of one or more boys trying to assert themselves. The same result as before - one fight and I was left alone.\n\nI was entitled to two lots of one week’s leave during the time I was at Yatesbury, and Bill Bruce at the New Theatre arranged work for me during these weeks. The first week was in February and I worked as an electrician on Michael Redgrave’s ‘Hamlet’. I remember while I was there his two daughters coming to visit him. Vanessa was about thirteen and Lynn, seven. Little did I dream at the time these girls would become two great actresses.\n\nOn the second week’s leave which was in May, I worked once again as an electrician on T.S. Elliot's ‘The Cocktail Party’ starring Rex Harrison. The landlady at my old digs in Streatham always managed to find a bed for me during my leaves, even if it meant sharing a room with two other people.\n\nThere was an examination at Yatesbury approximately every two weeks, which as far as I was concerned went more or less okay, but when we got to the fourth examination, I was the only one who passed. The result was that the entire class, me included, was put back two weeks and had to cover the same ground over again.\n\nIn the meantime, I had just agreed to play the part of Philip Lombard, in Agatha Christie’s (as it was known then) ‘Ten Little Niggers’. Later political correctness caused it to be changed to ‘Ten Little Indians’. That was still not correct enough and today it’s called ‘And Then There Were None’.\n\nTalking of political correctness, there are still some areas of the theatre where it has not stretched out its cold clammy hand. Otherwise ‘Guys and Dolls’ would probably be called ‘Men and Women’, Oscar Hammerstein’s lyrics in South Pacific would be changed from There is Nothing Like a Dame to There is Nothing Like a Woman, and the lyric She’s Broad where a Broad Should be Broad, would be changed to She’s Large in Areas Where Ideally a Woman Should Be Ample, and as for the lyric in Carousel, You’re a Queer One Julie Jordan, - well make up your own.\n\nThe play was due to be performed for three performances in the camp theatre which was a converted aircraft hangar, seating about eight hundred. They were usually a pretty rowdy audience. There was a scene in the play in which all the lights go out, and in the dark someone is murdered. This was okay on the first night, but on the second night the word had got round and in the black-out there were eight hundred flashlights directed at the stage.\n\nComing back to the point, I had just started to rehearse the play at the time that the class was put back two weeks, and I spent the next two weeks learning my lines and did no work whatsoever on my radar studies. We sat the same exam again with of course different questions, and there were twenty-one passes and one failure – me. I was called before the Squadron Leader in charge of our group who asked me to explain. When I told him that the theatre was my life and I really didn’t want to be a radar mechanic he was surprisingly understanding, took the point and just told me to pull my socks up.\n\nWe eventually got to the end of our training and I went off on a week’s leave. Bill Bruce found me a job as showman/electrician for a week. We were then posted to RAF Bawdsey in Norfolk for our final four week’s training of the system we were going to work on, which was known as CH2 (Chain Home 2).\n\nCH2 was an early warning system of the approach of enemy planes. It comprised of two transmitters, one of which was a stand-by, housed in a semi-bomb proof bunker. The transmitters created ultra high-frequency emissions which were passed to the transmitting towers, which stood about 200 yards away. There were three steel towers each 360 ft high, and strung between them was a steel mesh curtain which broadcasted the impulses. It had a range of about 60 miles. The impulses bounced off the incoming aircraft and were reflected back to the receiving towers, which were 240 ft high and constructed out of wood. These signals were picked up and then carried into another semi-concrete bunker housing two receivers, one main and one standby. The impulses could obviously reflect off any aircraft, but our planes had a system which was called IFF (Identification Friend or Foe), which triggered an impulse which came back to the receivers and showed up on the radar screen, thereby identifying the aircraft as friendly.\n\nCH2 was invented during the 30s and when the war clouds gathered, a chain of these radar stations was established along the south, east and north coasts and were up and running, ready for World War II.\n\nIf it hadn’t been for this radar system, the whole course of the war could have been changed because we might have lost the Battle of Britain. Germany would have had air superiority, which would have allowed them to launch an invasion, and if they had been successful, America could not have marshalled her forces along with ours in this country for the European invasion.\n\nOne of the reasons, apart from the tremendous valour of the pilots, who won the Battle of Britain, was that by the time the German aircraft arrived over this country, they only had about ten minutes of fuel left before they had to return to their airfields. Because the radar gave us a ten minute warning at their approach and told us exactly where they were, we were able to scramble all our aircraft in three minutes and have them in position ready to meet the oncoming Germans. Our planes had plenty of fuel because they’d only flown a short distance and could break off when they ran out of ammunition, land, rearm, and be back in the air very quickly. This, together with the great courage of the Few, undoubtedly tipped the scales in our favour. Thank God the German intelligence was not up to scratch, otherwise they would have devoted all their initial bombing raids against the CH2 radar stations, putting them all out of action.\n\nWhile we were at Bawdsey, the war in Korea was raging and there was a rumour that we all going to be shipped off there. I didn’t pay much attention to this, because having spent all that time training to work with a certain type of equipment, I figured there wouldn’t be a lot of 360 ft. steel towers scattered about Korea. As it turned out, I was fortunate enough to receive a slightly better posting than Korea. I was assigned to a station called RAF Pevensey, which is just outside Eastbourne.\n\nThe entire site at Pevensey was ringed with a 12 ft. high metal fence topped with barbed wire. Twenty-four hours a day the area was patrolled by guard dogs. The equipment was old-fashioned and more or less defunct by this time, so all the Chain Home stations were moth-balled, and were under what was known as ‘care and maintenance’. The total personnel on the camp were two radar mechanics, me being in charge of receivers, and the other in charge of transmitters, a cook, an administration orderly and three military police dog handlers. The parent station was RAF Wartling which was about three miles away. They weren’t particularly interested in us and nobody ever came to visit us. We were left to get on with it ourselves.\n\nThis was a dream posting. No authority; we were just left alone. I found myself a nice mattress to replace the service issue ‘biscuits’ and would quite comfortably lie in bed until 9 o’clock in the morning and then saunter down to the cook house for breakfast. After breakfast I would go and unlock the receiver bunker, switch everything on and run the receivers, whilst my opposite number in the transmitter block would do the same so that we could test the equipment.\n\nThe receivers were 8 ft high and 15 ft long, and had literally thousands of components which were subdivided into many panels. Although I had been trained as a semi-skilled radar mechanic, there was no way that I was competent enough to resolve any complicated malfunctions. If a problem developed on the main receiver, I would isolate the fault by removing the panels one by one until I found the one with the fault, and then replace it with a panel from the stand-by receiver. The end result was, by the time I’d finished doing my national service, I had one receiver which was working and one pile of junk. It was a photo-finish as to whether I was demobbed before the annual inspection of equipment took place, with all sorts of boffins coming to check that everything was alright.\n\nIt was laughable really that they’d left me in charge with millions of pounds of equipment, expecting me to keep it up and running. But perhaps they didn’t expect that; perhaps they merely wanted someone on site to make sure it was switched on occasionally, that the floor was polished and the roof didn’t leak.\n\nAfter I had been there for about six months, a Sergeant was posted in as overall in charge of the radar equipment. He took one look at it and said, ‘I’m not trained for this. I’m trained for a different system’, so he went away and sat in his office somewhere else on the site and left me to get on with it. He lived with his wife in married quarters some miles away, so he was just with us on weekdays and not at nights. He was happy to let things remain as they were and not rock the boat.\n\nThe posting was very cushy, but boring. After I’d borrowed the guard dogs, (one at a time) from the MPs and taken them for a patrol around the camp (which was highly irregular), had sun bathed on the towers, listened to the radio and polished the floor, there wasn’t much else to do. I read Homer’s 'Iliad', 'The Odyssey' and most of Shakespeare’s plays. I had typing lessons in the evening for a while; I attended a drama course but only for a short time, since it wasn’t any good.\n\nThere was a dance held at a ballroom on the Eastbourne pier twice a week, so I thought it would be a good idea to go along and see if I could pick up some girls. Unfortunately I couldn’t dance, so I enrolled at a dancing class. The first evening I was there, I was paired off with a pretty seventeen-year old. She immediately became my girl friend and we spent the next year seeking out secluded places in Eastbourne; the favourites in the winter were the shelters on the sea front. One of the problems with our arrangement was, that she lived about a mile and a half from the railway station, and by the time I’d taken her home, I’d missed the last train which meant a four mile walk back to the camp. Oh well, you can’t have your cake and eat it.\n\nOne of the schemes I got up to was forming a bookmaking partnership with the corporal who was in charge of the telephone exchange at RAF Wartling, the parent camp. Airmen who wanted to make a bet could pick up a phone anywhere on the camp; he would answer and divert the call to me, where I would be sitting in the seclusion of my receiving bunker and take the bets. They were mainly 5p and 10p bets, but we made a reasonable profit of about four or five pounds a week, and all was going swimmingly until I went on leave.\n\nWhen I returned, I asked in eager anticipation how much we’d made while I was on leave, (since we had been able to make alternative arrangements with someone recording the bets in my absence), and he replied, ‘We’ve lost eight pounds’. I didn’t believe it for a minute, but I bided my time and when he went on leave, we lost twelve pounds. To cover my tracks, I got a friend to inform him that he was the lucky punter who had won most of the money.\n\nDuring the leave which I had taken, I went back to the New Theatre to work as an electrician on Alec Guinness’ ‘Hamlet’. The player king was Ken Tynan; he became a critic about two years later. It was once said by a critic that he played the king as if he were afraid someone would play the ace. But this was not about Tynan, although he wasn’t very well received. Kathleen Tynan in ‘The Life of Kenneth Tynan’ writes that the Evening Standard critic, Beverley Baxter, wrote, ‘I am a man of a kindly nature who takes no joy in hurting those who are without defence, but Mr Kenneth Tynan ….would not get a chance in a village hall unless he were related to the vicar. His performance was quite dreadful’. Maybe this coloured some of Tynan’s reviews in later life.\n\nMy national service drew to a close and I managed to escape unscathed which was lucky considering the bookmaking, the late rising, walking the dogs and leaving the stand-by receiver in a mess. If I had been caught on any one of these I might have finished up in the glasshouse.\n\nJEAN ANOUILH QUOTE: \"Every man thinks God is on his side. The rich and powerful know he is\".\n\nI was due to start on the morning of Boxing Day. I had celebrated Christmas Day with my dear Aunt Gladys, Uncle Leslie and their family, and I must confess I’d had far too much to drink. The next morning I presented myself to John Bruce at 9 a.m. and was instructed to go to the boiler room, which was down a metal ladder into the bowels of the earth, and light the boiler. The boiler room was a tiny compartment measuring about 6 ft x 6 ft, with a coal chute on one side and the boiler on the other. I had to rake all the ashes and embers out and light it. The confined space was an almost impenetrable fog of ash, and there I was, with the most monumental hangover of all time, in the middle of this swirling, choking mist. I managed to get the boiler lit, then climbed up the metal ladder and staggered out into the fresh air. This, I thought to myself, is another poor start to a new job.\n\nHowever, there was a rainbow on the horizon. It was Boxing Day and at one o’clock just before the matinee, the first electrical day man went out and got pissed. When he returned to the theatre, John Bruce fired him immediately and promoted me. Four hours into the job and already a promotion!\n\nThe show running at the Wyndhams was ‘The Love of Four Colonels’ written by and starring Peter Ustinov. I applied myself industriously to my new position, which among other things meant working the switchboard. Time went by quite reasonably and I was now receiving a liveable wage.\n\nEarly on in the run one of the understudies, an actor called William Franklyn, who later on gained a certain amount of fame as the Schweppes advert man, (but of course he did many other things as well), asked me where I was living. I told him I was living in digs out in Streatham which were okay, except that on Saturday nights when we did two shows back to back, I could only get as far on the tube as Stockwell, then had to walk from the Oval to Streatham via Brixton - which wasn’t very good news late on a Saturday night.\n\nBill asked me if I would like to rent a room in his flat in the Earls Court Road, which he could let me have at two pounds a week. This sounded very good to me, so I went to have a look at it. I discovered he had used the word ‘room’ in its loosest possible sense since the ‘room’, nine feet long by five feet wide, was in the attic with a sloping roof and a fanlight. So of the five feet width, you could only stand upright in about two and a half feet. There was a bed, a very small table, chair and a cupboard where I could hang my clothes.The room was so small;you had to go outside to change your mind.\n\nI often drive past this house when I am coming back from the West End and I always look up, see this fanlight on top of the house and think, that’s where I used to sleep fifty odd years ago. I then start counting my blessings. There was however one major bonus to this room and that was, that if by any chance you happened to invite a young lady of your acquaintance to visit you, there was nowhere for her to sit except on the bed, circumnavigating a great deal of the usual manoeuvrings which go on in trying to persuade ladies to visit your bedroom. Mind you, they had to be pretty keen on you to go into the bloody room in the first place!\n\nWhilst there, Bill who was a very keen member of the Stage Cricket Club asked if I played cricket. I said yes, and he arranged for me to be enrolled in the team where I spent many happy years playing with various theatrical personalities. Our first captain at the time was a loveable actor called Gary Marsh and later on, the captaincy, by Sam Kydd. Dear reader, these people may not be known to you, but they were charming.\n\nAfter one of the Stage cricket matches I was standing on the platform at Thames Ditton railway station, when I was joined by another member of the team whose name was Tony Huntley-Gordon. I asked Tony what he was up to and he said he was company managing a murder mystery play, didn’t see much hope for it, but thought he might get a few weeks work out of it. ‘What’s it called?’ I asked ‘The Mousetrap’ he replied. It opened on 25th November 1952.\n\nThere is a side story to this. When it was presented by Peter Saunders, a film producer, John Woolfe, who subsequently produced many films among them ‘Oliver’, ‘Day of the Jackal’ and ‘The African Queen’, acquired the film rights to ‘The Mousetrap’, with the proviso that he couldn’t make the film until the show finished in the West End. Forty years later, when I was on the board of the First Leisure Company with him, he told me he was still trying to persuade Peter Saunders to let him make the film. But Peter resolutely refused. ‘The Mousetrap’ still hasn’t been produced as a film.\n\nOne of the joys of working on the ‘The Love of Four Colonels’ was that Peter Ustinov seemed to quite like me and when he was not on stage, he didn’t bother to go to his dressing room - he just used to sit on a chair at the side. Occasionally he used to beckon me over and we used to chat, and he would tell me various theatrical anecdotes. The most interesting of which was based on the film ‘Quo Vadis?’ in which he just played Nero.\n\nPeter told me that when he went into this major epic, Mervyn LeRoy, the director, wasn’t too sure that being relatively young, how he would cope with playing the part of Nero. Peter pointed out to him that in fact, Nero was a very young man and Peter was actually older than he was, but I guess LeRoy was thinking in terms of experience rather than age.\n\nPeter seeking inspiration on how to play the part asked Mervyn how he saw the character. Mervyn looked nonplussed for a moment and then muttered; 'it was a terrible thing he did to his mother'. Peter nodded in agreement; another pause - Mervyn said, 'I suppose you could see him as a person who played with himself every night'. The meeting ended and Peter departed bearing those rare nuggets of information about the character.\n\nPeter told me that when he played his first scene, he played Nero as he considered, well over the top. LeRoy said to him, ‘Look – Nero is one of the great freaks in history – I want you to go as far over the top as you possibly can. Go bloody bananas’. Peter said he did, and the end result seemed to work out very well.\n\nDuring one of our chats Peter told me he had purchased an enormous vintage Mercedes Benz. I asked him why he needed such a large car and he replied jokingly, ‘I want to make sure that if I have an accident, I won’t come off second best’.\n\nHe would also do impressions for me during his breaks on the side of the stage. It was like having my own private show. He could impersonate anyone - not only people, but he also did the most fantastic impression of the two cheetahs which were in the film with him; they repeatedly tried to mount his legs whilst he was in the middle of some of his scenes. Peter did actually manage to look like a cheetah, on heat.\n\nThere was one hilarious moment during the run of Four Colonels, (but not for the people concerned). In all theatres, the iron or safety curtain has to be lowered and raised in full view of the audience. On this occasion the fireman lowered it, and when it was time to raise it, he was slightly distracted and pulled the drencher handle by mistake. The drencher is a pipe full of water attached to the water main, which is situated immediately in front of the top of the safety curtain. In case of fire, this drenches the iron curtain. The water in the drencher is extremely dirty because it sits in the pipe for years. As soon as the fireman pulled the drencher handle, the filthy water hit the safety curtain and bounced out - the first three rows got it. The theatre management had a lot of cleaning bills to settle, apart from anything else.\n\nWhilst working on the switchboard, I supplemented my income during the show by playing poker between cues with the Second day man who’d moved into my position when I was promoted. He made additional money by writing Westerns which he did quite successfully. Since I was a better poker player than him, some of this finished up in my pocket.\n\nThe days went by at the Wyndhams and it was enjoyable working with John Bruce. Since the shows on Saturday were twice nightly, it meant that I could go to watch Arsenal on Saturday afternoons when they were playing at home. It was always difficult to get back from the game in time for curtain up, but John always kindly covered for me.\n\nThe worst part of working at the Wyndhams was that although I was not the boiler man, I had to keep the coal bunker stocked with coal. The bunker was on one side of the theatre and the coal cellar was on the other. My job was to lift the cover of the coal cellar, take a ladder, climb down into it with a bucket, fill it and then pass it up to John Bruce. (The boiler man was never on duty when this operation was performed). We then transferred the coal into a dustbin and wheeled it around to the other side of the theatre.\n\nThe problem was that filling the bucket in the confines of the coal cellar, a great deal of coal dust was disturbed. It was like being in a large coffin surrounded by swirling black clouds of coal dust which got into every conceivable orifice. When I finally surfaced I was as black as the ‘Ace of Spades’ and covered in coal dust from head to foot. There were no such things as baths or showers in the theatre and the only way to get reasonably clean was to use a cold tap at the sink under the stage; but you couldn’t get rid of the coal dust which had got into your lungs.\n\nI felt rather like the man who worked in the circus, whose job was to keep the ring tidy, so twice a day, six times a week, he followed the elephants round, cleaning up mountainous piles of dung. When asked why didn’t he give it up and find something more rewarding he replied, ‘What? – and give up show business?’ It so happened that one of these days coincided with my twenty-first birthday so it wasn’t exactly celebrated in style, although my father had sent me a cheque for twenty-one pounds.\n\n‘The Love of Four Colonels’ eventually finished. I will always remember with affection Peter Ustinov’s kindness to an obscure young electrician.\n\nRON MOODY QUOTE: \"Working on a film, you don't get time to develop rivalries, but the theatre is like a little village, and the differences between me, Lionel and Georgia grew\" - talking of Lionel Bart and Georgia Brown during the run of 'Oliver'.\n\nI was still financially very much in trouble, receiving only a stagehand’s wage when salvation hove into sight. I was having a drink in ‘The Salisbury’, a well-known pub frequented by actors in St. Martins Lane, when I got into conversation with a Company Manager called Pat Farrell, who was about to start working on a play called ‘No Escape’. He asked me if I’d like to understudy the juvenile and act as Assistant Stage Manager. As I was broke at the time, I leapt at the chance.\n\nThe play starred Flora Robson and featured Miriam Karlin. Two more diverse personalities it would be hard to find. Flora was dignified, polite and a trifle withdrawn; a nice person, a brilliant actress - but not Marilyn Monroe. Miriam was loud and out-going, a lot of fun and sexy - also a fine actress. They didn’t get on together. It was at last a production where I managed to spend a little time in bed with someone of the opposite sex. No, I’m not talking about Dame Flora.\n\nThe part I was to understudy was played by a friend, Francis Matthews, whose career has subsequently spanned over fifty years, playing everything from a starring role as an Indian opposite Ava Gardner in ‘Bhowni Junction’, to Professor Higgins in ‘My Fair Lady’. He is probably best known for the television series, ‘Paul Temple’. One of the dates we played was the Opera House, Manchester. I had been rather lazy and hadn’t bothered to fix up any digs thinking it would be easy enough when we arrived. There was always the famous Ackers Street where virtually every house took in ‘pros’.\n\nTheatrical digs came in various categories, almost if you like similar to hotels. Mrs McKay, the most famous landlady in the country, at 9-11 Daisy Avenue, Plymouth Grove Manchester, was the 5 Star ‘Savoy’ of digs where a lot of the stars stayed in preference to hotels - Flora Robson being one. Mrs McKay was strictly averse to any nocturnal activities in her bedrooms. She slept next to the stairs and if she heard the sound of two sets of footsteps coming up the stairs, she was out of her room in a flash to confront the couple. It is said that Eric Morecambe being aware of this, carried someone up the stairs on his back.\n\nRight down at the other end of the scale, you could have a flea ridden bedroom in ‘The Gorbals’, where you could be eaten alive by bed bugs - it happened to me. The more experienced of touring people used to carry a travelling iron, and when they were shown to their bedroom, whilst the landlady left them for a moment, they would plug it in, turn the sheets back and run it over the bed. If there was any wild life there, it would appear and they would then rapidly depart. But to be fair, the majority of digs were well run and comfortable, as well as being reasonably priced. I suppose they had to be, because there was a lot of competition.\n\nMany of the landladies could be quite particular in who they accommodated. They would get advance bills of the shows which were appearing in the town, and when they were approached by the artists looking for accommodation, they would check to see whether you were variety or legit, legit taking preference. They would then inspect the bill matter and obviously, the better your billing, the more chance you stood. This didn’t follow religiously, because on occasions, even I got into Mrs McKay’s Savoy. I believe also that the landladies used to tip the stage door keepers if they recommended an artist to them.\n\nThey were a very mixed bunch; most of them had a guest book which they kept and asked visitors to make comments in the book. There were various codes which could be used. ‘LDVG’ was one. When the landlady asked what it meant, she was told, ‘Landladies’ Dinners Very Good’. What it really meant was, ‘Landlady’s Daughter Very Good’. There was another frequent entry in some of the ‘bad digs’ books from Edgar Allan Poe’s poem: ‘quoth the raven’. For those who don’t know, the next word in the poem is ‘nevermore’.\n\nThere is a story which Harry Secombe tells. One morning he awoke at 6 a.m. and feeling a bit peckish, wandered down into the landlady’s kitchen where he saw her spread eagled on the kitchen table, with the milkman on top of her. She looked over the milkman’s shoulder, saw Harry and said, ‘Oh Mr Secombe, you must think I’m a terrible flirt’. Anyway, God bless them all. They provided us with shelter, food, even warmth sometimes. We certainly couldn’t have done without them.\n\nBack to my arrival in Manchester. The train pulled in on a typical cold, wet, dark Manchester Sunday afternoon. I didn’t feel too enthused about trudging up Ackers Street looking for digs. Francis said that he had some good ones and was sure there would be room for me there too. I got a lecture from him about always booking digs in advance.\n\nWe arrived at his abode and the friendly landlady ushered us in to the warm and cosy front room where there was a roaring fire in the grate. She told Francis how nice it was to see him and that she had a hot meal ready to serve him. She was most apologetic to me and said she hadn’t any room but there was a commercial hotel a few hundred yards away that might be able to put me up; she served Francis his hot meal as I prepared to leave. As I walked down the dark path carrying my heavy suitcase in the cold rain, I looked back and saw Francis in the cosy room, sitting down to eat his hot meal in front of the fire. He waved a cheery farewell to me with two fingers extended and I proceeded on my way.\n\nThe commercial hotel was a grey sombre building, looking about as welcoming as Count Dracula’s Castle. I booked in, was shown to my poky bedroom with an iron bedstead and was informed the next meal that would be served was breakfast. I was also told that there was a sitting room downstairs which I could make my self comfortable in. Comfortable? It was a large cold room with linoleum on the floor, a couple of leather armchairs with the stuffing coming out, some bentwood chairs, and a table littered with some dog-eared prehistoric magazines that looked as if they’d been thrown out of a dentist’s waiting room. I picked up one of the magazines, moved some of the horsehair to one side and settled into an armchair.\n\nI was idly flicking through, (I think the stop press contained the details of the latest Jack the Ripper murder), thinking what a bitch life was, when the door opened and in walked a young, tall and extremely attractive young lady followed by another and another and another - until I was surrounded by ten of the gorgeous creatures. Playing at the opposition theatre, The Palace, was ‘The Folies Bergère’ presented by Bernard Delfont, (this was the first of many times I had reason to be grateful to Bernie although he didn’t know at the time), and staying with me in the hotel were ten showgirls! They were just as bored as I was and in racing parlance ‘doubles and trebles’ were not out of the question.\n\nWhen I staggered into the theatre the next day I received a cheery greeting from Francis asking me how the hotel was. ‘It’s a bit overcrowded’ I said, mentioning the ten showgirls. His face turned green with envy and he asked if I would be kind enough to ask him over. I said, ‘I’d like to, but I wouldn’t want you to miss your nice hot suppers - besides there aren’t enough girls to go round’, and returned the cheery two fingered wave he had given me the previous evening.\n\nAs the week wore on I arrived at the theatre looking worse and worse each day. On the Friday there was a trade show of a new film ‘On the Waterfront’ and as usual, the cinema invited the casts from various theatres to attend. It really upset Flora Robson who was sitting in the middle of the ‘No Escape’ cast when she turned round and saw me sitting in the middle of about sixteen girls in a different part of the theatre. ‘Why isn’t Richard sitting here where he belongs?’ she asked. No-one had the courage to tell her. What a way to spend a week in Manchester! I can’t think of a better one.\n\nOne of the dates we played on tour was the Olympia Theatre, Dublin and because of transportation difficulties we could only take the costumes and certain vital hand props. The theatre said, ‘no problem’; they would build the set and provide all the furnishings. When we arrived at the theatre on the Sunday evening they were still painting the set and there wasn’t a stick of furniture anywhere. I was told, ‘Don’t worry, be here at 9.00 am in the morning. A lorry will be waiting for you; the driver will take you round all the shops in Dublin and whatever you want. Just go in and ask for it; tell them you want it for the theatre and they will lend it to you without charge’.\n\nThis turned out to be true – no matter what we asked for, we got it. We went to some auction rooms for the furniture; what I picked out was due to be auctioned that week, but the auctioneer simply withdrew it until the following week. All the Dublin people I met turned out to be the most charming and generous I have ever come across. The other great thing about Dublin was that the pubs were open all day; the cigarettes were cheap and there were betting shops long before they became legal in England. Miriam and I spent a blissful week non-stop in either the pubs or the betting shops.\n\nFrancis was obsessed with the fact that he was too thin and he wanted to build his body up, so each day he would drink two pints of milk and eat a very large bar of chocolate. On the last week of the tour in Plymouth, I was in digs with him and he started complaining that he was losing his appetite and wasn’t feeling very well. This was the worst news I could imagine. I had thought he would never be off, so had never completely learnt the part. I was panic stricken.\n\nEach day he would complain, and each day I would urge him to go on, telling him that there was nothing wrong with him; he was just eating too much chocolate and drinking too much milk; that was the reason he had no appetite. This went on all week with Francis soldiering on. The show closed on Saturday. He went to see his doctor on the Monday and I received a phone call from him later that day. ‘Thanks a lot,’ he said. ‘The doctor has told me I am just recovering from an attack of yellow jaundice’.\n\nI finished that tour without a penny in my pocket. During the last week in Plymouth, I lost all my money in a poker game with Stubby Kaye who was appearing in ‘Guys and Dolls’ at the opposition theatre. Miriam, bless her, lent me the money to get out of town.\n\nDENNIS PRICE QUOTE: \"I am a second-rate feature actor. I am not a star and never was. I lack the essential spark.\"\n\nWhilst the show was running, Anna Wiman used to occasionally invite me back to her flat for a drink, which was in a mews just opposite St. James Palace – purely socially. The show only lasted a few weeks and it looked like I was out of work again. However my benefactor, Pat Farrell, had an argument with Anna and left. Anna asked me if I would like to take over Pat’s job as General Manager. Naturally, although I wasn’t experienced enough, I said yes, and took up my job in her offices in Dover Street in the West End. There were only two other people there; a secretary and a very charming Irish gentleman who held the position of Social Secretary. That meant that he booked all the tables in restaurants, theatre tickets, arranged flowers and generally managed Anna’s social life. In the midst of doing this I believe he might have been enjoying quite a good social life of his own, on Anna’s bill.\n\nAnna didn’t have much going on in London at that time apart from running the Fortune Theatre which she had leased. After I had been in the job four weeks she said, ‘We are off to New York’. She was going to co-present with an American impresario, Kermit Bloomgarden, a play called ‘Maiden Voyage’ by Paul Osbourne. It was a comedy, very loosely based on Homer’s Odyssey. This starred Melvin Douglas, Mildred Natwick and a promising young newcomer playing Odysseus, Walter Matthau. Before arriving in New York we were first of all due to stop off in Bermuda at her country home.\n\nAnna was thirty-two, a petite blonde and fairly attractive. She had studied dancing in New York with the American Ballet Company under George Balanchine and in Paris with Serge Lifar and Egorova. She had danced in several shows in America, but then badly fractured her leg in a car accident which finished her career. Although she now couldn’t dance, her love was show business and she decided to try to emulate her father, Dwight Wiman, who was a famous American impresario from the mid twenties to 1951, presenting over fifty shows on Broadway, including: ‘On Yours Toes’, ‘Babes in Arms’, ‘Three Sisters’, ‘Mornings at Seven’, ‘The Big Knife’ and ‘The Country Girl’; so Anna had a hard act to follow. She was however blessed with great wealth.\n\nJohn Deere, one of Anna’s ancestors, had invented in the early 1880s, a self-scoring steel plough which enabled the homesteaders to cultivate the mid West. The old ploughs which had been used on the East coast were not suitable since they continually clogged with the rich mid Western soil. The John Deere Company grew with leaps and bounds and today, is one of the top two hundred companies in America. In 2004, its company profits were nearly two billion dollars net. Unfortunately, Anna didn’t live to see this. She died at the very early age of thirty-nine on 22nd March, 1963.\n\nAnna Deere-Wiman\n\nIn 1951, apart from her trust funds and inheritances from the John Deere estate, her father died and left her even more money. She was warm, generous, had a good sense of humour and was keen on me. Had it been my inclination, I think I could have had almost anything I wanted, but there were two problems. One, I didn’t fancy her, although I was very fond of her, and two, she was an alcoholic. After just one drink she could turn from being loveable into a very hard lady. But I must add she never took it out on me, but it caused me great embarrassment when I was around and she took it out on other people.\n\nBecause of her wealth, when we flew to Bermuda from London we naturally went first class. In those days some of the planes were equipped with two tier bunk beds with curtains which you could draw across. Half way into the flight I was asleep in my bed and a change in the pitch of the engines woke me up. It was night; I looked out of the window and saw by bright moonlight, icebergs and an icy wasteland getting closer and closer. I got rather nervous at this because I didn’t expect icebergs on the way to Bermuda. I didn’t realise at the time that we were going to have to land in Greenland to refuel.\n\nWe arrived in Bermuda and were driven to her palatial home which was set on the top of a hill in its own vast grounds overlooking the sea. There are not many beaches in Bermuda because the coastline is very rocky, but her father Dwight Wiman had created his own beach, by dynamiting a great deal of the rock frontage on his property by the sea and creating a sandy cove.\n\nAnna's home in Bermuda\n\nThe time was spent entertaining her friends, and me learning to drive her car on her private road. She took me water skiing and fishing. You could go out in a shallow bottomed boat through the coral reefs which surrounded the island for about half a mile, and still, the coral was so close to the surface, you could get out of the boat and walk on it.\n\nI did sleep with Anna once in Bermuda, but she didn’t seem particularly upset with me when I didn’t want to make it a regular thing. I can only assume she liked having me around as her companion and escort. Anyway, I had a wonderful time and Anna didn’t take too many drinks.\n\nOn the last night before we were due to fly to New York we went out to a club situated at the other end of the island from Anna’s house. Anna was chatting to some friends and I saw that the owner of the club was playing poker at the bar with three other people, one of whom was the Captain of a British submarine which was in port. I got involved in the game, and after about an hour Anna said it was getting late and she was leaving, but was happy for me to stay.\n\nThe flight to New York was due to leave at noon the next day. By four a.m. I had lost half of all the dollars that was supposed to last me for three months, (there was very strict currency regulations in those days), and I was starting to panic. I had worked out that it would take about three quarters of an hour to get back to Anna’s, and then three quarters of an hour to get to the airport after packing. By 6 a.m. I had lost three quarters of my bankroll - now I was really in trouble. By seven a.m. I had lost the lot. ‘Will you take an English cheque?’ I asked. ‘For up to one hundred pounds’, the bar owner answered. I phoned for a taxi and asked it to wait by the entrance. The clock ticked on - a sort of ‘High Noon’. Then my luck turned - by eight o’clock I had a quarter of my bankroll back - I was on a roll - by nine o’clock I had half of it back - but I couldn’t stay any longer. I rushed out, got into the taxi and sped back to Anna’s.\n\nShe didn’t say a word when I arrived or reproach me in any way. I ran into my bedroom, threw all my clothes into my suitcase and hurried out to join Anna who was waiting in the taxi. We arrived at the airport, just in time I thought, but as we went through the main doors, a voice came over the loud speakers – ‘The flight to New York has been delayed by five hours’. Just think, if I’d known, I would have had time to get all my dollars back - but on the other hand? (In any event, Anna decided to pay me $100 a week in expenses).\n\nI didn’t normally get excited, but on this occasion, on my first visit to New York - I was. We touched down when it was dark, so my first glimpse of the Manhattan skyline was when it was lit up in all its glory. We arrived at 219 East 49th Street, a four storey brown stone house which Anna owned. The ground floor was rented out; Anna’s apartment was on the first floor and the top two floors consisted of a magnificent, unoccupied, furnished penthouse. As soon as we got our cases in the front door of Anna’s flat, she said, ‘we now better sort out the sleeping arrangements. You can stay here with me or you can have the penthouse. The choice is entirely yours’. Because I didn’t really fancy her sexually although I liked her a lot, and possibly stupidly, was not interested in her money, I opted for the penthouse.\n\nThe next day I couldn’t wait to start exploring New York - a regular ‘rubber-necker’. However it was time for business, not pleasure. Anna took me to her office suite backstage at the Alvin theatre on 52nd Street, which at the time was playing ‘No Time for Sergeants’. She introduced me to her secretary and then showed me into an enormous office, beautifully furnished and decorated and said, ‘This is for you. It’s really my office but I’ll work from home. It is the office that my father Dwight Wiman worked from when he was presenting so many Broadway shows’. And with that, she left me to get on with it.\n\nNow, what was I going to do? I sat behind this enormous desk and thought. Anna wants me to be creative, but I’m not old enough or experienced enough at the age of twenty-five to quite know where to start. Yes, I was good at stage management and organisation, but had not developed any creative abilities. I considered that we might be able to transfer some Broadway hits but this was extremely unlikely, since Binkie Beaumont had a virtual stranglehold on anything which was successful.\n\nWe had on the stocks ‘Maiden Voyage’, which was due to open in Philadelphia and then transfer to Broadway. We also had an interest in a play which was due to open in Toronto. We were running the Fortune theatre back in London which I was responsible for, we had a play running, ‘The Devil Was Sick’ which didn’t work, and to follow this in, I booked ‘Who Cares’, a play by Leo Lehman starring Alec Clunes. This didn’t work either, but soon to come our way was the Flanders and Swan show, ‘At the Drop of a Hat’, which opened on 24th January and was a great success. We were also in the process of setting up a deal with Sam Wanamaker to run the New Shakespeare theatre, Liverpool, (completely funded by Anna), which was to present plays directed by Sam, and have a social club, a children’s theatre, a restaurant, an art gallery and be open twelve hours a day. Eventually, this got underway in October 1957.\n\nThe first few evenings in New York were spent squiring Anna round all the Broadway hits except one, which was ‘My Fair Lady’, starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. Even Anna couldn’t get two seats for this. The management said to her that they could illegally put one bentwood chair in a side aisle - but only one. Anna said to me, ‘You have it’. We dined at Twenty One, Sardis and The Copacabana and met lots of her friends. But my favourite outing was going to see Bobby Short at the Café Carlyle, which I revisited several times.\n\nOne day Anna said, ‘I’ve got a special treat for you tonight. We’re having dinner at home and one of my very best friends is dining with us’. That evening her friend arrived at the flat sporting a black eye and a bloody nose. Her first words were, ‘Don’t worry about my appearance - I’ve just been having a fight with two sailors’. It was Diana Barrymore, the daughter of the legendary John Barrymore.\n\nDiana had had a very hard life trying to emulate the success of the Barrymore family. She appeared on stage and in films, but didn’t make much of an impression. In 1955 suffering from alcoholism and severe depression, she committed herself to a sanatorium for a year. In 1957 she published her ‘warts and all’ autobiography, ‘Too Much Too Soon’, which was made into a film the following year, starring Dorothy Malone as Diana and Errol Flynn as John Barrymore. She committed suicide two years after the film was released. She was thirty-nine.\n\nThe evening started well enough; Diana was very tough but charming, but as time went on and a few drinks had been downed, she started to get a little nasty. Because of Anna, I didn’t wish to be impolite to her friend, so I put up with it. It got worse and worse until eventually I was forced to say, ‘Look, just because you’ve got your period, don’t take it out on me’. With that, she hit me over the head with a champagne bucket and knocked me out. When I came to she had left, and that was my only meeting with a most unusual and very interesting lady.\n\nI got in touch with my old friend Gabe Katz who’d moved back to New York to a studio in Greenwich Village. I phoned him and arranged to meet him. I took a taxi to the street where he lived but couldn’t find the number, so I paid off the taxi and walked up and down trying to find it. It was snowing at the time, and from the roofs of various buildings I started to get pelted with snowballs – but no direct hits. I finally found Gabe’s flat. When I got inside I told him that some of the local kids were having a bit of fun throwing snowballs at me. ‘A bit of fun?’ he said. ‘You were lucky they didn’t hit you. They put rocks in them down here’.\n\nGabe introduced me to the English contingent in New York; one was a twenty-one year old who worked in the bookshop of an art gallery but he desperately wanted to get into the theatre. I think he was impressed with what I’d done, and he was certainly impressed when I took him and some other friends back to meet Anna in her apartment. He eventually made it in the theatre, his name - Michael White. Among the many shows he subsequently produced in London were: ‘A Chorus Line’, ‘Annie’, 'Crazy for You’ and ‘Oh Calcutta’.\n\nOne of the English contingent was a girl called Pamela. She was married to a Polish count, (they were plentiful in those days), and they had what is euphemistically known as an ‘understanding’. He screwed who he liked and she could make her own arrangements. To be fair to Pamela, I don’t believe she availed herself of this opportunity. When I met her, her husband was away in Europe; we formed a very close relationship which endured for the period of my stay. I expected Anna to be a bit pissed off with this, but she took it in her stride. Sometimes, when she obtained tickets for the theatre she would pass them to me and say, ‘Here – you can take your little blonde friend’. I’ve never quite understood Anna’s feelings towards me – whether she was genuinely indifferent to my relationship with Pamela or whether it hurt, but she didn’t want to make a scene about it.\n\nOne day Anna asked me to help her open her safe which had a tricky combination. After a great deal of fiddling about, we finally we finally opened it; she removed all the contents and spread them across the dining room table. There was every conceivable kind of jewelry; watches, earrings, diamond necklaces, gold lighters etc., and a solid gold cigarette case with the map of America engraved upon it, including various cities which were picked out in rubies. I asked Anna what the significance of this was. She said it was her father’s cigarette case, highlighting the cities in which he previewed his shows before bringing them to New York. Anna then said, ‘Would you like something?’ I said ‘What do you mean?’ She said, ‘Help yourself to anything you like’. I said, ‘You’re joking’. She said, ‘No - take anything you like’. I took the cigarette case.\n\nFour weeks later when I returned to my flat from the office, I couldn’t get my key into the lock. After fiddling about for a while trying to get the door open, I went downstairs to Anna’s apartment and called a locksmith. When he arrived, he tinkered with the Yale lock and pulled out a broken toothpick. ‘You’ve been burgled’, he said. He let me in and I went upstairs to the bedroom. It was in total disarray, all the drawers had been pulled out and all my clothes had been taken from the wardrobe and were on the bed ready to be packed in two of my suitcases, which were alongside. For some reason, which I have never been able to work out, there were black handprints all over the white paintwork in the bedroom. Everything small was gone, including the gold cigarette case - even a jar which had some one cent pieces in it. I called the police, and a real hard- bitten New York detective arrived very quickly and took all the details. ‘You were very lucky. He heard you trying to get in, otherwise you might be dead’. That made me feel a bit better\n\nWhen I told Anna about the burglary and the fact that the cigarette case was gone, she said ‘Well, you should have been using it shouldn’t you, but never mind, I’ll get the value of it back on insurance’ - which she did. But she didn’t offer me any of the money.\n\nMe, listening to Anna tell me I wasn't getting any of\n\nthe insurance money\n\nAnna and I went to Philadelphia for the rehearsals and opening of ‘Maiden Voyage’ but in spite of a lot of cutting and re-writing and a brilliant performance by Walter Matthau, it just didn’t work, so it was reluctantly decided to cancel the Broadway opening.\n\nAt Christmas, magnanimous as always, Anna said I could invite Gabe Katz, Pamela and all the English contingent back to her flat to celebrate Christmas Day. They were all rather surprised at being entertained by this fabulously wealthy lady who had just three or four of her own friends present, but they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The more I think about it, the more I think that Anna was probably basically very lonely and with good cause. She was always concerned that the people who flocked around her were after her money.\n\nThere had been an occasion back in London when after the opening night of one of her plays, ‘Plaintive in a Pretty Hat’, she invited me and twelve of her friends to dinner at Les Ambassadeurs, one of the most expensive restaurants in London. Several of the guests were free-loaders, and Anna, near the end of the meal, rose to her feet and said, ‘I’m fed up with you lot using me as your meal ticket. I’m off and you can pay the bill yourselves’. With that, she swept out. There was a furore – everyone desperately scrambling through the contents of their wallets and purses to see if between us, we could scrape together enough to pay the gargantuan bill, since we had been eating and drinking the best of everything. When we finished pooling all our resources, we found we had just about got enough to cover it – but we passed on the coffee. The next day at the office, Anna breezed in and said, ‘Hi Richard - sorry about last night - didn’t mean for you to pay a share. How much was it?’ and wrote me a cheque to reimburse me.\n\nOne evening in New York, Anna told me we’d been invited to dinner at her mother’s, just the two of us. I was a little nervous at the prospect of this, thinking that her mother wanted to vet who this potential new con artist might be helping Anna spend her money. We arrived at her apartment on 5th Avenue, the opulence of which was stunning. Her mother, a beautiful aristocratic lady was dressed impeccably; she greeted me, patted the seat beside her and said, ‘Now, tell me all about yourself’ - which I did, sparing very few details. I think the penny dropped that I wasn’t after Anna’s money, and she, for her part was pleased that Anna had an escort who wasn’t a fortune hunter. She was absolutely charming to me all evening and at the end said, ‘Anna, you really must bring Richard again’. Regretfully, we never had the opportunity to return.\n\nAt about this time Pamela’s husband returned from Europe and Pamela threw a party to welcome him home. All the usual people were there, plus two English nurses who were working in a hospital in New York. The evening started well, but contrary to the arrangements which were supposed to exist between Pamela and her husband, he got exceedingly jealous and wanted to fight me. During the scuffle which ensued, I had the better of him but just could not bring myself to punch him: (a), because I could understand him being jealous and (b), I didn’t want to upset Pamela, so it was more of a defensive battle on my part. The culmination of this was that I banged my head on the wall and got concussion. I was escorted back to my penthouse by the two nurses who stayed the night. What a waste – two nurses in one room and me in another suffering from concussion.\n\nI received one hundred dollars a week, which was for my salary and living expenses, more than adequate for my needs, since I had no rent, gas or electricity to pay in New York, just my share of the expenses of the flat in London. Each working day I took great delight in having lunch at a different restaurant in New York of which there are hundreds. I experienced every conceivable type of cuisine; the only one I didn’t enjoy was the uncooked Japanese. I would save my receipts and give them to Gabe Katz who used them to claim against his income tax.\n\nAnna and I flew up to Toronto to see the play ‘Be My Guest’ which she had an option on. I had thought New York was cold; when I went out on the streets in winter it was so bitter, I felt as if my face was cracking. In Toronto, I felt if somebody struck me a glancing blow; my whole body would disintegrate into shards of frozen, splintered flesh; that’s what being brought up in a temperate climate does for you.\n\nThe play was fair and we tied up the arrangements to present it in London. It was then getting near time to return to England, but Anna kept changing her mind about how we were going to do it. First we were going to fly to Bermuda; then we were going to sail on the Isle de France; then we were going to sail on the Queen Mary and finally, we finished up on a grotty ship called the Empress of Scotland. The voyage took six days; Anna had taken a girlfriend along with her so I was left to my own devices. I can honestly say at that time I never wanted to set foot on a boat again. It just felt completely claustrophobic.\n\nOn the morning of the day we set sail, I thought I had better not return from New York without visiting the Empire State Building. I jumped in a taxi, drove there, took the lift to the top, had a quick look round, went back to the flat and made ready for my departure. To my surprise, by the gangway on the dock stood Gabe Katz with a weeping Pamela to see me off. New York was a pleasant interlude in my life and I was very fond of Pamela – but not fond enough.\n\nEUGENE O'NEILL QUOTE: \"There is no present or future, only the past, happening over and over again, now\".\n\nAfter the show closed - still no money. Usual routine - Labour Exchange - poker - George deferring the rent. I received a phone call from a producer, Toby Rowland, at the beginning of June asking me if I would like a job as Company and Stage Manager on ‘Brouhaha’ starring Peter Sellers. I readily agreed. Little did I know of the aggravation that was in store for me. Toby Rowland had apparently asked Ruth Atkinson, my Deputy Stage Manager on ‘Hunter’s Moon’ who her Company Manager was. Ruth told him and Toby said, ‘I’ve never heard of him’. Ruth recommended me.\n\nToby was a charming man. He originally came from Libby, Montana with his wife, Milly and started to work with Binkie Beaumont at H.M. Tennent's. Apparently there was a falling out, since John Perry, who was Binkie’s partner, was jealous of the relationship that developed between Toby and Binkie.\n\nToby left to set up on his own with the backing of Prince Littler, the head of Stoll Moss Theatres. He hadn’t had much success and was hard up. His office consisted of three tiny rooms in Chandos Place; his room was at the back. There were no windows, just a skylight and it was very damp. Toby and I hit if off very well – so well, that for years afterwards he always asked to look in my diary to see what my poker winnings or losses were for each week. He was the only one I ever showed it to.\n\nAn excerpt from a letter Toby wrote to Sheila years later\n\nToby had a great capacity for drink. I had on more than one occasion seen him put a whole bottle of Scotch away in about two and a half hours, and not appear the slightest bit worse for wear. Toby formed an important part of my theatrical life over the next few years, as you will read later. (That is if you continue to read).\n\nToby and Millie Rowland as children in Libby Montana\n\nToby and Millie just a year or two later\n\n‘Brouhaha’ was a comedy written by George Tabori, set in the 1950s in a tiny Arabian country by the sea, which was formerly a British Protectorate. Because of its position on the map, both America and Russia were anxious to be an influence in its development. Its ruler, the Sultan, was played by Peter Sellars, who in order to receive aid from both the Russians and the Americans, pretends that there is internal strife, and there might be a coup, which would be to the detriment of one of the two countries.\n\nThe two nations sent representatives to try and gain a foothold in the country. The American representative, Stitch Allentock, was played by Jules Munshin, a charming American who had appeared in many Hollywood films including ‘On the Town’, in which he played one of three American sailors. The other two sailors were played by Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. You are not going to believe the following - but it's true - one of the captions on the trailer for 'On the Town' read 'Twice as Gay as Anchors Aweigh'!\n\nAmong the rest of the ‘Brouhaha’ cast, the Russian representative, O. Tyekin, was played by Leo McKern and Buscombe, the British resident, was played by Lionel Jeffries. Also appearing among the large cast were John Wood, Hermione Harvey, Anne Leon, Timothy Bateson and John Cater.\n\nFrancis, my flatmate was also initially cast, but he didn’t know how big his part was. After he looked at my script, which I had some weeks before we started rehearsing, he decided his part was too small and asked his agent to get him released. Peter Hall, the director, was not very pleased when he found out how Francis had seen a copy of the script.\n\nWhilst ‘Brouhaha’ was running I formed a relationship with my Assistant Stage Manager, Prue, who was the daughter of Mrs Campbell-Williams by a previous marriage. The Campbell-Williams’s owned The Arts Theatre, and had a flat on the top floor. In their absence in the country, Prue and I used their flat. Mrs Cambell-Williams who had a great sense of humour, tackled me one day at the bar in the Arts Theatre and said, ‘Who’s been sleeping in my bed then?’ I don’t know how she found out, but I had to own up.\n\nIt was during this period that I heard that they were looking for a Stage Manager for the Arts Theatre and as my father was out of work, I introduced him to Campbell-Williams. He joined them as Resident Stage Manager.\n\nDuring rehearsals for ‘Brouhaha’, Peter Hall was nearly lost to the theatre. We had a scene in the play in which John Wood was to be guillotined, but the blade sticks. Peter, being a perfectionist for detail, wanted a real guillotine with a very heavy steel blade, so that it made a loud crash when it was tried out onstage, prior to John Wood putting his head into it ready for execution. The way we caused it to jam was that after it was tried out, without the audience being able to see, the actors surrounding it inserted four heavy steel bolts into the track supporting the blade, which stopped it on the way down.\n\nBecause it was such an important and dangerous prop, during the rehearsal period, Peter Hall, John Wood and I went to the property makers to see it in action. We set it up to fall without the steel bolts in position. We released the heavy steel blade and it fell with a crash that shook the floor. John Wood turned green, ‘I’m NOT going to put my head in that’, he muttered. Peter said, ‘John there’s no problem. Once we insert the steel bolts, it will stick. I’ll show you’. We put the steel bolts in and tested it three times and it worked perfectly. ‘I’m still not putting my head in it’, said John.\n\nPeter said, ‘John, would I ask you to do anything that wasn’t perfectly safe? I’ll put my head in it to show you how confident I am that it’s safe’. ‘Just a minute Peter’, I said. ‘Let’s try it out a few more times before you do’. We tried it three times, and it worked perfectly. ‘Okay, let’s do it’, Peter said. My nervous response was, ‘Just one more test for luck’. We raised the blade and released it. The blade clattered down, jumped out of its guide tracks, bypassed the steel pins, and smashed into the floor just below where Peter’s neck would have been. Many green faces and back to the drawing board.\n\nI sometimes, in subsequent years when I was sitting round the table with Peter Hall at National Theatre Board meetings, used to wonder who would have been running the National Theatre if we hadn’t had ‘Just one more for luck’.\n\nPeter Sellers revealed himself as a total monster during the run. On the first night in Brighton I received the first inkling of what might lie ahead when he said to me, ‘If I’d known I was going to have to have to do the same thing every night, I wouldn’t have signed the contract’. As it turned out, he never did do the same thing two nights running.\n\nWhilst we were in Brighton he said to me, ‘It takes too long to put all this bloody body make-up on for every performance. Will you go out and buy me a car paint spray so I can spray it on every night?’ A strange request, I thought; but as my job was to keep him happy, I obliged. He tried it once and then said that it bored him - he wasn’t going to use body make up after all. I got a rocket from the producers for wasting money. After a two week try-out in Brighton, we opened on August 27th 1958 at the Aldwych in the West End.\n\nThe play was constructed rather like a revue, with all short scenes running between five and ten minutes, except for the last one which lasted for half an hour. The total theoretical running time of the play was just under three hours, including interval, but according to the whims of Peter, it varied enormously. The fastest recorded running time was two hours and thirty-one minutes, and the longest, three hours thirty-one minutes. If Peter was enjoying himself, he really padded it out.\n\nOne night he took a film camera on stage with him and said to the audience, ‘This is my favourite scene in the play - do you mind if I film it?’ This he proceeded to do, including several retakes. He also asked other members of the cast to take the camera and film him in various shots, both close-up and long shots. The audience was a trifle bemused.\n\nOn another occasion he had been out drinking before the show. Upon his first entrance he went forward to the footlights and said to the audience, ‘I’m pissed, I’m very pissed. Would you please vote and let me know if you would prefer to see me pissed, or the understudy sober’. Of course, the audience all shouted, ‘You’\n\nYou might ask why this was tolerated by the management. The answer was that without him the play would have closed, so I was instructed not to make any waves, just let him do his own thing. In the meantime, the management and Peter Hall were noticeable by their absence, just in case they felt compelled to say anything. After a while, things deteriorated to such an extent that I said to Toby Rowland, ‘You really must send Peter Hall in to see what is happening’. Toby and Peter reluctantly agreed, and the evening arrived when Peter was due to see the show.\n\nIn the interval he told me to call everyone onstage after the performance for notes, but not Peter Sellers, and asked me to make sure the float mikes are left on, so Peter could hear what was being said in his dressing room. The cast were assembled onstage. This is it, I thought. Now Peter Hall is going to address the situation. Peter spoke. ‘Ladies and gentlemen’, he said. ‘I have just watched the performance and you should all be ashamed - it was terrible. The only person who is being true to the piece is Peter Sellers’.\n\nHe knew which side of the bread was buttered, for the show, the cast and everyone in the theatre. If he had criticised Peter, Peter would have walked out. The company realised that too. Honour had been served - the director had been in, and it was every man for himself. If I’d been Peter Hall I would have done the same thing.\n\nPeter Sellers was starring in the film ‘Mouse on the Moon’ which he shot in the daytime while appearing in ‘Brouhaha’. There was a great deal of location work in Southampton, and he hired an ambulance to take him back and forth from London so that he could sleep. On occasions he would either be delayed, or, I assumed he felt he just didn’t want to perform. About one hour before the curtain went up each night, I used to dread getting a phone call at the stage door from him telling me he wouldn’t be appearing. This happened frequently. In fact so often, that his understudy Colin Ellis, held a party to celebrate his 25th appearance.\n\nAmong all the artists who suffered from his activities was the very lovely actress, Hermione Harvey. One evening when he had had a little too much to drink, he was dancing with her along the footlights, when he took one step too many and fell into the orchestra pit, taking her with him. There was a hell of a crash and a long pause. I rushed onstage, and peered down into the darkness asking, ‘Are you all right down there?’ There was a groan, followed by another pause, and then he slowly clambered out of the pit and wandered off into the wings. Hermione called out, ‘What about me?’ He reluctantly came back, and helped her out of the pit. Hermione said, ‘Let’s continue,’ and he said, ‘I’ve had enough for the night’, and went to his dressing room, leaving Hermione and me looking at each other. I said to the audience, ‘You’ve all seen what happened - I’m afraid Mr. Sellers can’t continue - the understudy will have to take over’, which he did, and Hermione, the trouper that she was, continued as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe press were at the stage door within ten minutes, trying to find out what had happened. It seems that we must have had a mole in the theatre, because whenever there was a problem, the press were always there looking for a story within ten minutes. The mole must have earned a fortune during the run, whoever he/she was.\n\nPeter was always trying to corpse Hermione, but she somehow always managed to take it with good grace, even on the occasion when he said to her, ‘I want you to wear a moustache tonight’. She protested - but he was adamant, and, rather than upset him and possibly cause him to miss the performance, she agreed. She appeared that evening, this beautiful actress, most unhappy, with a huge black curly moustache painted on. God knows what the audience thought of it all.\n\nNo one escaped. One night while playing a scene with Leo McKern, Peter suddenly said, ‘Would you like to dance?’ Leo was not sure what to do, but thought he had better go along with it and said, ‘I would be delighted’, and they performed a dainty minuet along the footlights. He tried to throw Lionel Jeffries, but Lionel with his own eccentric style of performing was always able to hold his own.\n\nJules Munshin came in for it. One night I had invited Charles Palmer to see the show. Peter who was a Judo enthusiast, was most impressed by the fact that the Captain of the British Judo team was in front, and in the middle of a scene with Jules he suddenly stopped, and said to Jules, ‘I want to introduce Charles Palmer to the audience’.\n\nJules, not knowing who Charles Palmer was, and wondering what was about to happen, muttered something to the effect of, ‘Okay’, and sat down on a dustbin at the side of the stage. Peter came forward to the floats and said, ‘Ladies and Gentlemen, may I introduce Charles Palmer who is a fourth Dan black belt Judo expert, and Captain of the British Judo team. I would like to do some demonstration falls and throws for him, using the authentic Japanese descriptions. Do you have any objections?’ There weren’t any from the audience, but Jules and Charles Palmer looked extremely uncomfortable. Peter then proceeded to do three of four minutes of Judo instruction from the stage, accompanied by break falls etc., and then moved back to do the plot. When I saw Jules later he just shrugged and said, ‘That’s Peter.’\n\nAfter a few months when his contract was up, Jules was replaced in the show by Graham Payne, Noël Coward’s partner. Everything Graham had done prior to this had been for the large part, criticised. The much maligned Graham first met Noël Coward in the early 30s as a teenager, when he auditioned for him. Later on in the 40s, he became Noël’s life companion until Noël’s death in 1973. Graham had had an indifferent career, in spite of all Noël’s efforts on his behalf. He gave him leading roles in ‘Sigh No More’ and ‘Pacific 1860’, opposite Mary Martin, (which my father stage managed), in a revival of the revue ‘Tonight at Eight Thirty’ alongside Gertrude Lawrence, a leading role in ‘The Ace of Clubs’ opposite Pat Kirkwood and ‘Waiting in the Wings’ in 1960.\n\nWhen Coward died, he left him his homes in Montreux and Jamaica, and a very large sum of money. Graham died at the age of eighty-seven, an alcoholic. (If you can live to eighty-seven, please pass me another bottle). Graham was said to have been given the part in ‘Brouhaha’, only because he was Noël’s partner. I, for my part found he played his role as a foil to Peter Sellers extremely well, and was very charming to everyone in the theatre. More than that, you could not ask.\n\nLester Osterman, the co-producer with Toby, was planning to present the show in New York. He told me that he wanted me to go with it since I could save them tens of thousands of dollars in view of my knowledge of the production. I asked him how much he was going to pay me for this knowledge and he replied: 'I wasn't actually planning to share it with you'.\n\nWhen I was allocating the dressing rooms for the large cast, we got rather stuck for space, and I finished up without an office. Timothy Bateson, John Wood and two other actors were in a large dressing room; I floated the idea that I might take a corner of the room. This met with disagreement, particularly from Timothy who said, ‘Suppose Noël Coward comes round to see me and finds you in the dressing room?’ I couldn’t answer that one, so I made alternative arrangements, and moved into the Fireman’s room which I shared for the run.\n\nLater, Noël Coward did indeed come to see his friend Graham Payne in the play. Timothy Bateson asked me if Noël had been backstage, and I said, ‘Yes, he came back to see the Fireman, and was very surprised to find me sharing his dressing room’.\n\nSpeaking of Firemen, I was sitting in his room one Friday afternoon making up the casts’ salaries, with pound notes spread out everywhere, when suddenly the door opened and a head came round it. ‘Can I help you?’ I asked. ‘No, thank you’, came a guilty sounding reply. ‘I am just looking for the Waldorf Hotel’. ‘Well what are you doing backstage at the Aldwych theatre?’ I asked, and with that, he took off. I chased him down the stairs, out of the stage door and up Drury Lane. I managed to collar him by the Winter Garden Theatre, (I was young and fit then). I marched him back to the stage door, and asked the stage door keeper to phone the police.\n\nThe fugitive broke away from me again, ran down the street, and past the front of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Unfortunately it wasn’t his lucky day, because there was a Royal Gala matinee taking place at Drury Lane; there were about twenty policemen standing there on duty. He ran straight into the middle of them and was apprehended.\n\nThat’s a good job done I thought, and feeling quite self-satisfied with myself, made my way back to the theatre, up the stairs and saw that I’d left the door of the Fireman’s room open, with all the money spread out for anyone to walk in and help themselves. Fortunately, no-one did. I subsequently received a present from Frederick Lloyd, the General Manager at Stoll Moss theatres, of two bottles of Scotch for valour. With hindsight, it might have been for stupidity.\n\nSometimes Peter would wear his costume; at other times he would appear in all sorts of strange garb. He was like a mad baby, indulging himself regardless of anyone else on-stage. But although he upset me, and others connected with the show, what shone through was this mad comic genius, whose anarchic comedy kept everyone in the audience on the edge of their seats.\n\nHe once said to me when he was coming to the end of his contract, and it looked as if we might try and replace him, ‘I hear you’re thinking of replacing me with Spike Milligan. Well if you do, and you think you’ve had trouble with me, boy, are you in for a big surprise!’\n\nI think it was about that time that Peter who had an obsession with cars, and seemed to change them every few weeks, bought a new Rolls Royce. He was very happy with it, apart from the fact that he kept hearing a squeak that seemed to be coming from the boot, and he couldn’t work out what it was. So, at about two in the morning, he turned up at Spike Milligan’s house and rang the bell. When Milligan came to the door in his pyjamas, Peter said, ‘Spike, you’ve got to help me. Will you get into the boot and I’ll drive around, and you try and find out where the squeak is coming from’. Spike, being as mad as Peter, agreed.\n\nHe got into the boot and Peter drove off. He did U turns, braked, sped up and slowed down. The local constabulary, who happened to be passing in a police car observed this, and pulled him over. They started to ask all the usual questions - have you been drinking? etc. They then said, ‘Will you open the boot please?’ Peter duly obliged, and they peered in to see Spike looking up at them. All the policeman could bring himself to say was, ‘Oh, it’s you, is it’.\n\nThere was only one long scene, which lasted for about half an hour in the play. This was a transformation scene, at the end of which, the whole town is blown up, and all that is left is a smouldering ruin. All the stagehands were hard drinking Covent Garden porters, and the only time that they could go to the pub for a drink was during this scene\n\nOn the evening in question, the act started as normal - all the stagehands left the theatre for their pint, and then five minutes later, Peter decided to cut to the end of the scene. This deleted several actors’ scenes, and left us with others not ready to make their entrances. But more importantly - there were no stagehands to make the transformation.\n\nThe only man left was in the flies, and he was trying to fly away the main structure, which weighed about half a ton. All he could manage was to make it lurch a little. As for the rest - nothing happened - so we came to the end of the play in chaos, with no one in the audience knowing what on earth was happening. Having already been told to give Peter his head, no matter what, and bearing in mind the sort of mood he was in, I thought I’d give him a chance to cool down and tackle it the next night.\n\nThe next evening half an hour before the curtain went up, I went to see him in his dressing room where he was chatting to Jules Munshin. ‘Pete’, I said, in what I considered to be my most ingratiating tone, ‘I hope you don’t mind my mentioning it, since I’ve been told that whatever you do is fine, but, if you decide you want to cut twenty-five minutes out of the last scene, would you mind letting me know, so I can tell all the artists concerned, and also tell the stage hands not to go out for a drink - then we can do the transformation’.\n\nHe went absolutely berserk. ‘You’re a fucker. All the management are fucking poufs, and I’m fucking off out of here’. With that, he put on his hat and coat and swept out of the dressing room, leaving Jules and me staring at each other open mouthed. ‘Perhaps he’ll come back’, said Jules. ‘I don’t think so’, was my reply.\n\nThe understudy went on as normal. Later on that evening, I received a phone call from Toby Rowland the producer, saying that Peter had been on the phone to him, saying that I been grossly rude and insulting to him, and unless Toby fired me, he wasn’t returning to the show. Toby asked me for my side of the story, and I said, ‘Don’t believe me - ask Jules Munshin who was present’. Jules confirmed what had happened, and that Peter had suffered one of his brainstorms.\n\nI wouldn’t have blamed Toby for replacing me in order placate Peter, but to his eternal credit, he refused to do that, and for once, caused Peter to back down. But from then on, there was no communication between Peter and me for some time. All messages were passed back and forward through my stalwart Deputy Stage Manager, Ruth Atkinson.\n\nLate on in the run, much as he didn’t want to, Toby Rowland thought he had better come in and show the flag one night. He worked out that if he came in for the last five minutes and saw the curtain calls, he could then have a chat with various actors, to show he was thinking about them. All went well with the last five minutes, but on the curtain calls, Lionel Jeffries banged his head on the scenery, split it open and concussed himself. Toby spent until four in the morning with Lionel in the casualty department of the hospital.\n\nSomeone asked me later on, ‘Apart from Peter Sellers, you have some very difficult actors in the show. How do you cope with them?’ ‘I suppose you don’t notice a snake biting your ankle when an elephant is trampling on you’, was my reply.\n\nThe business for ‘Brouhaha’ had slackened off slightly towards the end of the year, and we did a three-quarters of an hour television excerpt. Immediately the business rocketed back to capacity. It then got to the end of Peter’s contract, and the show closed, much to my relief, since the possibility of working with Spike Milligan, was not one that filled me with joy.\n\nIt was the most traumatic period of my show business career. In retrospect, to quote someone else, ‘It was a bit like the Blitz. It was quite an experience, but you wouldn’t want to go through it again’.\n\nWhile ‘Brouhaha’ was running, André, the restauranteur whom George Cole had introduced me to, was operating an illegal chemin de fer game, and I got into a little financial difficulty playing in it. Sharing my difficulty was a friend of mine, Peter Rollason, who worked as a film extra, and had helped me out on a couple of occasions, by getting me a job as an extra on ‘Carve Her name With Pride’ and ‘The Dunkirk Story’.\n\nTo help pay off part of the debt,I borrowed some money from my girlfriend Prue who was rather wealthy, having inherited a great deal of money from her grandmother. André said to Peter and me, ‘To help you pay off the rest of the debt and earn you some money, I will make you junior partners in the chemin de fer game. All you have to do is let us occasionally use Peter’s flat’, which was in Bryanston Street. André had to keep changing the location of the game in case the law cottoned on to it.\n\nEverything was going along reasonably well; the games were always catered for magnificently; with great food and fine wines from André’s restaurant, together with his head waiter in attendance, looking after the players. One night while the game was taking place at Peter’s flat, it got to 2 a.m. and André, having been up all the previous night went home to bed, leaving Peter and me in charge. The game looked as if it was going to break up at about 3 a.m. To keep it going, we made the mistake of playing ourselves and started to lose a great deal of money\n\nThe waiter who was keeping an eye on us, phoned Andre at home to warn him what was happening. André arrived back post haste, by which time we had recovered some of the money. He let the game continue until we had more or less broken even, but he wasn’t very happy. There was one big loser who owed about £10,000, and there were several winners – all of whom were paid by André. The loser gave a cheque to André which bounced. This meant that André was very much out of pocket.\n\nThe loser owned a hairdressing salon. What I didn’t know at the time, was that André had sent someone to see him. In the ‘interview’, several of the hairdryers happened to get knocked over. Following that, the man phoned André and said, ‘Please - I will settle. I’ll give you another cheque’. This cheque also bounced. André was now livid. He phoned the man and said, ‘You will meet me tomorrow at twelve o’clock in the bar at the Regent Palace Hotel with the cash. If you don’t – I will shoot you’. The man frightened, said, ‘I’ll definitely be there with the cash’.\n\nAndré told me this conversation, and said, ‘I want you to come with me to the Regent Palace to meet the man’. So, I reluctantly went along. The man appeared with a briefcase which he opened for André, and it was stuffed full of five pound notes - £10,000 worth.\n\nAndré asked me to accompany him back to his flat, with the money. When we arrived, I said, ‘André, you really frightened him to death, didn’t you. What a bluff! He really thought you were going to shoot him’. ‘Yes, he did’, said André, taking a gun out of his pocket and unloading it. I was horror-stricken. I thought - Christ, he was going to shoot him – with me sitting next to him - I’m out of here. ‘Andre’, I said, ‘The partnership is dissolved. I don’t want to be involved anymore’ and that was my brief foray into illegal gaming.\n\nI started taking driving lessons during this time with BSM. The baptism of fire was the test, because the starting off point was the Charing Cross Road, and the route was Trafalgar Square, Whitehall, then back through the West End. I passed my test first time, and Peter Rolloson sold me a beautiful vintage Jaguar for £20. I drove it from Elgin Avenue to Marylebone High Road, and the gear box fell out. He did give me my money back.\n\nApart from the chemin de fer, there was lots of poker during this year, mainly with me finishing up a winner. There was also, lots of cricket, and in one match against Old Merchant Taylors, I shared a record last wicket partnership for the Stage with Brian Rix, now Lord Rix, of 117 runs. I scored 66 not out, he scored 44 and there were 7 extras. I don’t believe this record has been beaten for the Stage Cricket Club.\n\nThe poker game was now in full swing every Wednesday and Friday evenings, at Charles Palmer’s flat.\n\nCharles, a self-made man, had studied Judo in Japan; he could speak fluent Japanese and French. Among many honours, he was made President of the British Judo Association in 1977, Chairman of the British Olympic Association in 1983, Gold Medal - Judo Union, and honours throughout the world, too numerous to mention. He was also Member of the Board of Governors - Royal Albert Hall, and years later became the only Tenth Dan in the world outside Japan.\n\nHe ruled the poker game with a rod of iron. It usually started at about seven in the evening, (I got there after the show), and you could play until eight o’clock the next morning, if you so desired, but before the game started, you had to write in a book the time you were going to finish, be it two or three in the morning, and once you had written a time - that was it. You could not go beyond it - there were no extensions. You could leave before, but only if you were losing. And that is usually unlikely, since losers want to stay - winners want to leave.\n\nCharles had an incredibly short fuse, so nobody dared argue with him. On one occasion, one of the players had brought a friend who Charles did not know, as an observer. This man was wandering around the flat, inspecting everything and generally being nosy. I could see that Charles was getting very irritated by this, but he didn’t say anything. Then the man reached up above the mantelpiece, and started to lift down a Samurai sword which was in a scabbard. Charles shouted, ‘Don’t touch that’, and as he did, the sword slid out of the scabbard and took the man’s little finger off. Charles jumped up from the table, picked up the man’s finger, stuffed it in his hand and threw him out of the door saying, ‘Don’t bleed on my carpet. Now fuck off!’\n\nI used to take great delight in teasing him. On one occasion, we were playing poker and he was leaning with his forearms (which were enormous) on the table, and I said something to upset him; he started to get angry. I laughed at him and said, ‘It doesn’t matter how angry you get, there’s nothing you can do. In view of your Judo prowess, you can’t touch me because you’ll be put in prison. And, while we’re at it – take your legs of the table!’\n\nThings had been quite good at poker this year, and I achieved one of my life’s ambitions. I had seen a beautiful Omega gold wrist watch in Asprey, which cost £240. With my winnings, I was able to buy it and, in order to irritate Charles, I used to take it off, put it on the table under his nose and spin it round. He hadn’t got a gold watch – so he got very upset.\n\nYears later - me with Charles and his girlfriend from the 50s\n\nMaggie Golding who went on to become Headmistress of\n\nseveral schools for autistic children\n\nAt this time, Charles persuaded me to have Judo lessons with him at the Budokwai Club, which was a bit late in life to start but I thought – give it a shot. I got only as far as yellow belt, and then decided I really couldn’t devote the time to it, so I stopped.\n\nQUOTE ABOUT CHARLES PALMER: Mr YS Park, president of the International Judo Federation, said, \"Charles Palmer is the father of modern Judo.The sport was highly modernised by his efforts.\n\nTHE TIMES OBITUARY 20th AUGUST 2001: Charles Palmer, Chairman of the British Olympic Association who played a key role in sending athletes to the Moscow Games in defiance of the Government. Few Britons have ever played such a significant and contentious role in the administration of world and domestic sport as Charles Palmer.\n\nI knew Joe and Bruce Robinson, who were both actors, fight co-ordinators and stuntmen; Joe played opposite Diana Dors in ‘A Kid for Two Farthings’; they also ran Judo classes in a gym next door to the Comedy theatre.\n\nThe difference between them and the Budokwai, was that they were not officially recognised by the Judo authorities, since they were professionals. They invited me to go to their class to see what it was like. I think their method of awarding belts to their pupils was a little less stringent than the methods used at the Budokwai, because I went on the mat with a green belt that I knocked over, and then a brown belt, who I managed to throw.\n\nDoug who had a short fuse, unlike the easy-going Joe, said, ‘You’re so good, come and practice with me’. He proceeded to bounce me round the gym like a tennis ball. He kicked me so hard on my shin that I developed phlebitis, and I could sink my finger into the bone for weeks afterwards. Joe saw what was happening, and fortunately stopped him before he injured me really badly.\n\nSince I was winning at poker, coupled with the fact that I was in a reasonably lengthy run with ‘Brouhaha’, I could pay off all my arrears of rent and any other debts, and still have enough left over to purchase a second hand Austin Healy sports car. It was racing green, and a convertible. It was essentially a two seater, but you could just about squeeze two vertically challenged people into the back. I confess, I did drive it too fast.\n\nI was once proudly driving my new acquisition through the West End, when the lights changed, and the car in front of me stopped very abruptly. I wasn’t able to pull up in time, and I ran into the back of the car. No great damage, but my two headlights were broken. Imagine my horror, when out of the car in front stepped Alastair Sim. ‘Oh Dickie’, he said. ‘I see you’ve broken your car’.\n\nOn another occasion, at 2 a.m. in the morning I was going to a poker game, speeding down the Embankment which was deserted, at 100 miles per hour. I suddenly noticed in my rear view mirror, a police motorcyclist pull out from a side street behind me. I didn’t put the brakes on, because I didn’t want him to see the braking lights; instead, I changed down through the gears. When he caught up with me, he said, ‘I must congratulate you on your use of the rear view mirror, but on a conservative estimate, I think you were doing about 95 miles per hour. But since it’s clear and deserted, and you were observant, I’m going to let you off, but don’t let any of the young ones catch you, otherwise you’ll be in trouble’.\n\nAbout four weeks later, I was going to play in a cricket match against the police at Imber Court; I was doing about 35 miles per hour alongside Tooting Common, when I was pulled over by a police car and given a ticket. I said to the officer, ‘I’m awfully sorry, I am a bit over the speed limit and I’m late for a cricket match against the police’. ‘Well, I don’t play cricket myself’, he said as he handed me the ticket. So far, that’s the only ticket I’ve ever had for speeding. I do drive a lot slower nowadays, but I really enjoyed driving that car.\n\nThere was no immediate prospect of any work, so as usual, I spent a lot of time playing poker and cricket, and wondering where the next job was coming from. After a few weeks, I decided that with a wife and child to support, the insecurities of the West End theatre were not for me, so I wrote letters to television companies, asking if there was any possibility of obtaining work as a floor manager.\n\nBefore there was time for any responses, which incidentally I never received, Freddie Granville, (whom I had met doing ‘Detour After Dark’ with his wife Maxine Audley), phoned me and told me he had acquired the rights to a play running on Broadway called ‘Come Blow Your Horn’.\n\nAlthough an extremely prolific comedy writer, this was Neil Simon’s first play, turning out to be the only one that was a really big financial success, out of the many critically acclaimed plays of his that were presented in London. Although all the others were well received and had good reviews, they didn’t fully capture the imagination of the general public. They all ran, but they didn't make serious money for the investors. His musicals did better, but didn't make megabucks.\n\nFreddie explained to me, that although he could make deals, he knew nothing about the nuts and bolts of putting shows on, and asked me if I would like to be his silent partner, but with a 50% share of the business. I accepted with alacrity. I found a room for us at the Arts Theatre Club which we used as an office, and we set to work.\n\nCy Enfield, who later on went on to produce ‘Zulu’ and other films, was to direct the play. Bob Monkhouse played the leading role, supported by David Kossoff, Libby Morris and a young man aged twenty, whose first job it was in the West End ‘proper’ - Michael Crawford - although he had just done a play at The Arts theatre.\n\nCy was very meticulous with his casting, and I think we saw virtually every young actress in London for the role opposite Bob Monkhouse. Among the many people Cy turned down were: Susannah York, Sarah Miles and Samantha Eggar, but he finally plumped for Nyree Dawn Porter.\n\nIn the meantime, Jimmy Grafton, an agent who looked after Harry Secombe among others, obtained an introduction for us to meet Bernard Delfont who liked the idea, and offered to put up all the money and open the play at the Prince of Wales theatre, which was absolutely perfect for the show. Saying was one thing - doing was another.\n\nFreddie and I got involved in all sorts of expense prior to rehearsals, but we could not get one penny out of Douglas Harrison, who was Bernie’s Chief Accountant. It was a classic case of ‘there’s a cheque in the post’. After about three weeks of this procrastination I said to Freddie, ‘We can’t wait any longer. I’m going to see Prince Littler’s representative, Frederick Lloyd, maybe he will be interested.\n\nMr Llo"
