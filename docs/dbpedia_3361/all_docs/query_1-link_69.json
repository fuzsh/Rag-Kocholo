        "text": "Everyone's favourite grumpy GP is returning for a ninth series later his year.\n\nPort Isaac-based Doc Martin first hit our screens in 2004 and despite some rumours that it would be drawing to a close, the cast is expected back in Cornwall next month.\n\nLeading the cast, Martin Clunes recently revealed that filming usually brings the production to the duchy for five months of the year - seeing the sleepy village in which the show is set, completely overrun with fans and camera crews.\n\nThe 57-year-old also revealed that he would love to have Alien star Sigourney Weaver return to join the cast but wanted to avoid repetition.\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nIn a recent interview, Martin Clunes told Acorn TV: \"So where were we last time, we have James Henry who is getting older, we have a dog living with us who has to be dealt with.\n\n\"We are back in Port Isaac, there will be patients, there will be a grumpy doctor and there will be the Cornish countryside.\"\n\nWhen asked why the series, which has been running for 15 years, has celebrated so much success, he added: \"In England, it works well because in England we want a bossy posh man in a suit to tell us what to do and to fix everything but we also have to walk him into a door frame every now and again.\n\n\"The letters I get, mainly from the United States actually, it's quite dreary really - the letters I get in England they just want a photo, but people tell me why they watch it and why they like it.\n\n\"But a lot of people have watched it going through chemotherapy or radiotherapy and having a rotten time and I think well, I can sort of see that, I’d like to see a bossy posh man fix everything.\"\n\nHe added that fans are \"grateful for the lack of profanity, no sex and no violence\".\n\nWhen will it air?\n\nDoc Martin typically airs at the end of September, so if we were to follow the same pattern we could expect to see the series nine premiere on Wednesday, September 18 or 24.\n\nGiven that filming is due to commence in Cornwall next month - we suspect September is a realistic goal after editing and publicity.\n\nWill series nine be the last?\n\nThere was speculation that series eight would be the final run for Doc Martin so fans were surprised when the Cornwall-based drama was renewed for a ninth go.\n\nHowever, the future isn't looking that great for the show, as Bert Large actor Ian McNeice recently admitted: \"I don’t want it to end.\n\n\"But I have a nasty feeling that it will and that the next is the final series that we’re going to do, which is the 9th.\n\n\"I suppose all the people involved who make it want it to go out on a high.\n\n\"They don’t want it to sort of dibble down, which a lot of shows do.\"\n\nIf it really does come to an end, Ian said he had just one modest hope for Bert before he says goodbye – a new hat and jumper.\n\nHe says: \"It always cracks me up when I go for my costume fitting and they bring out the same freaking costumes I’ve worn for the last 10 years.\n\n\"And I think to myself, ‘My budget for my clothes is going on everybody else. Where are my new clothes? I get nothing.’ I’m wearing the same gig. I’m wearing the same clothes. It’s sad.\n\n\"It’s the same blue jumper. It’s recognisable – we know where we are with this guy. I’ll probably be buried with it. It’ll go in the coffin because no one else will have it.\n\n\"Or maybe I could take Bert’s hat and as much costume as I could, because I’ve got to keep on doing conventions, baby. Let’s get the Doc Martin conventions out. I’ll have to be wearing the costume.\"\n\nWill there be any guest appearances?\n\nSpeaking about the chances of guest stars in the upcoming series, Martin Clunes recently said: \"We would love to have Sigourney back because she was such a blast but you sort of don’t want to get into novelty casting - she’d have to have something to do.\n\n\"The first time she came on it we had a little scene because we weren’t sure she would have the time or whatever but she did make the time and she did come and do it but we could have taken her out and put someone else in.\n\n\"So the second time she had a lot more to do but we knew because she was pinned down, she was about to do about 95 Avatar films in a row.\n\n\"We wouldn’t want to repeat it – we try never to repeat ourselves. But we will have a whole new cast - we are casting at the moment.\"\n\nDon't forget to join our celebrity spotting group for all the latest showbiz news."
