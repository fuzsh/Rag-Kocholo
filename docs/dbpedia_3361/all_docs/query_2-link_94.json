        "text": "My Demon's remarkable cast is led by two Korean drama favorites namely 20th Century Girl star Kim Yoo-jung and Sweet Home actor Song Kang.\n\nThe SBS-produced K-Drama, which Netflix has streaming rights to, revolves around the story of a contract marriage between a multimillionaire heiress and a demon who goes to Earth after seemingly losing his powers.\n\nMy Demon's first two episodes premiered on Netflix on Thursday, November 24.\n\nEvery Main Actor & Character in My Demon\n\nKim Yoo-jung - Do Do-hee\n\nAfter losing her parents when she was a child, Do Do-hee (played by Kim Yoo-jung) was adopted by the chairwoman of Mirae Group, which is one of the top ten companies in Korea.\n\nDo-hee eventually becomes one of the top CEOs in Korea, and her rise to the top makes her a primary target for her enemies. Do-hee then meets a demon named Gu-won, and their chance encounter leads to an unexpected partnership that changes their lives forever.\n\nKim Yoo-jung has an impressive K-Drama resume, with roles in Moon Embracing the Sun, Backstreet Rookie, and Lovers of the Red Sky.\n\nSong Kang - Jung Gu-won\n\nSong Kang plays Jung Gu-won, the demon who has been roaming around Earth for thousands of years, making contractual agreements with humans in exchange for a hefty price that involves going to hell.\n\nAfter a fateful encounter with Do Hee, Gu-won unexpectedly loses his powers as a demon, ultimately transferring all of them to Do Hee. As a result, Gu-won needs to work together with Do Hee to find out how to regain his powers before it's too late.\n\nSong Kang is dubbed the \"Son of Netflix\" since most of his projects are being streamed on the service. The actor is best known for his roles in Nevertheless, Navillera, and Sweet Home.\n\nLee Sang-yi - Ju Seok-hoon\n\nAs the CEO of Mirae Investment Group, Lee Sang-yi's Ju Seok-hoon has everything except the chance to get the full extent of the inheritance from the business group he works for.\n\nJoo Seok-hoon secretly hates Do Hee since she is primed to become the owner of Madam Ju's inheritance before she takes over.\n\nLee Sang-yi previously appeared in notable K-Dramas like Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, Bloodhounds, and Han River Police.\n\nKim Hae-sook - Ju Cheon-sook\n\nJu Cheon-sook, (aka Madam Ju), is the founder of Mirae Group and she is also Seok-hoon's aunt.

The actor also has credits in My Dearest and Queenmaker.\n\nLee Yoon-ji - Noh Soo-an\n\nNoh Soo-an (played by Lee Yoon-ji) is Cheon-sook's second daughter and the CEO of Mirae Apparel.\n\nNoh Soo-an is a self-proclaimed Parisian who wants to buy all of the latest things that are tied to the famous French city.
