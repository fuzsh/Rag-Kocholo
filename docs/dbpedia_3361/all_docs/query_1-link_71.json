        "text": "One year ago today, September 26, 2013, I created this blog for the “insanely addicted\n\nfans of ‘Doc Martin.’” I had intended simply to review the eight episodes of Series 6. Serendipitously, the blog has turned into an amazing experience, and I have developed a number of friendships thanks to this virtual reality.\n\nHere are a few memorable milestones.\n\nSeptember 26, 2013: “Doc Martin” Series 6 Airs October 7, 2013” – First blog article announces that Acorn TV will stream the new series for the American audience.\n\nOctober 7, 2013: “‘Doc Martin’ Is Back!” — I posted my review of Series 6, Episode 1 — and what a great episode it was! Romantic, funny, heart-warming.\n\nDecember 5, 2013: “Christmas Memories” — I was over the moon by the responses to my first attempt at FanFiction. “Ruthie” wrote: “Oh how perfect…thank you, thank you! My new favorite Christmas story.”\n\nDecember 28, 2013: “Confessions of an Insanely Addicted Fan” brought in this amusing reply from “Hopelessly Devoted”: ” . . . Until a year ago, I had never heard of Doc Martin, Martin and Phillipa Clunes, etc. Now I know the name of his dogs, his horses, what he looks like naked (he seems to like to get starkers in his movies). . . ”\n\nJanuary 25, 2014: “Martin Clunes Announces “Doc Martin” Season 7″ — It was official. Martin Clunes would film a new series in 2015! The story brought in hundreds of comments from fans, who were all thrilled with the news, but also weighed in on their impressions of Series 6, which many thought contained too much drama and not enough comedy. Fans are hoping for a lighter, happier Season 7.\n\nAugust 23, 2014: “Up Close and Personal with Martin Clunes at the Buckham Fair” — My daughter, granddaughter and I attended the Fair and hooked up with UK “Doc Martin” fans, John and Pam Russell. I was star-struck by my brief encounter with the awesome Martin Clunes.\n\nSeptember 16, 2014: #19 “Doc Martin” FanFiction — “Cornwall, Part 2” — I am amazed to look back and see that I have written 19 short stories based on this wonderful show and that I still delight in creating “Doc Martin” FanFiction.\n\nSeptember 26, 2014: As of today, nearly a quarter-of-a-million visitors from 135 countries have touched the blog. The power of social media blows my mind.\n\nCheers to everyone connected with the insanely great “Doc Martin” series! And a huge shout out to all the fans who keep the show the top-rated series, not only on ITV, but in hundreds of other countries around the globe."
