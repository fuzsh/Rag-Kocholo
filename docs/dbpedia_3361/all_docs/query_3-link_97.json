        "text": "With Doc Martin drawing to a close as it reached its tenth season, Martin Clunes began turning to one of his passion projects with his free time: travelologues. Fans of the actor will know that since 2017, he's been behind several projects where he travels to different remote areas and takes audiences on adventures of exploration. These series, Martin Clunes: Islands of Australia and Martin Clunes: Islands of America, were big hits for ITV, and in 2019, he followed it up by filming Martin Clunes: Islands of the Pacific.\n\nHowever, when it came time to make a second season of his Pacific project, it was February 2020, and as the world remembers, the world was shutting down, even remote islands in the middle of nowhere. At the last minute, the trip was canceled, and – tragically – COVID-19 invaded the islands. However, after a long delay, Clunes finally returned to complete the new season, as the press release states, \"moving north into a vast swathe of tropical waters littered with beautiful islands; and yet remain defiantly off the conveyor belt of modern tourism.\"\n\nThe series delay meant Season 2 only debuted at the end of 2023. Episodes aired and streamed in the U.K. over the December holidays and arrived on Acorn TV just after. The show's charge directly to PBS Passport only a few months ago is a quick turnaround of an Acorn TV series for PBS, and Clunes fans are surely grateful.\n\nHere's the series synopsis:\n\nFollowing the success of part one of Islands of the Pacific, Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) continues on his epic journey across the Pacific. This season, Martin travels to Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and Micronesia. In the first episode, Martin travels to Papua New Guinea and lives amongst the subsistence farmers of the Trobriand Islands. There, he plays their favorite game – cricket! Next, he visits the volcanic island of New Britain. Both are a reminder of the fragility of island existence in this part of the Pacific Ocean. Martin then explores the Philippines, from Manila’s jeepneys and bamboo bikes, Catholic fiestas and family feasts, to remote tribal burials, rice god rituals, meeting chocolate heroes, shamans and witches, to spotting cuddly tarsiers and pulsing fireflies. Finally, Martin travels to Guam to see the effect of invasive species on remote islands; discovering animals and humans driven to the edge of extinction. In Palau, he meets the endangered Hawksbill Turtle and rare Dugong, learning more about this tiny island’s work in world-leading marine conservation.\n\nMartin Clunes narrates and stars in the three-episode series, which was directed by Ian Leese and Russell England and produced by Sandy Poustie. Philippa Braithwaite and Bill Jones executive produced the series for ITV, where it was initially broadcast before streaming on Acorn TV in 2023.\n\nAll episodes of Martin Clunes: Islands of the Pacific Season 2 debut on PBS Passport on Wednesday, May 1, 2024, on select PBS Passports and airs on linear on some PBS stations. As always, check your local listings."
