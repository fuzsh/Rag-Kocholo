        "text": "The actor Martin Clunes OBE is best known for his work on Doc Martin and Men Behaving Badly – but he’s also a passionate animal-lover and owns a working farm!\n\nHis first-ever TV role was on the BBC sitcom No Place Like Home and the same year he also appeared in an episode of Doctor Who, and then another sitcom called All at No 20. He’s also appeared in William and Mary and voices Kipper the cartoon dog.\n\nHow old is Martin Clunes?\n\nThe actor was born in November 1961 and is currently 59.\n\nMartin Clunes' wife\n\nMartin has been married to his wife Philippa Braithwaite since 1997, and she produced the programme Doc Martin.\n\nHe was previously married to actress Lucy Aston from 1990 until 1997.\n\nMartin Clunes' daughter\n\nMartin and Philippa have a daughter, Emily, who was born in 1999. The three live together in their animal-packed working farm!\n\nWhere does Martin Clunes' live?\n\nThe actor lives with his wife and daughter on a 130-acre working farm near Beaminster, with a whopping four dogs, two cats, 14 horses and chickens! Together they host an annual Buckham Fair which raises money for charity.\n\nWhat is Martin Clunes' net worth?\n\nMartin is quite a wealthy man, thanks largely to Doc Martin. He and wife Philippa own the production company that makes the programme, and the fact that it’s been sold to more than 70 countries means the actor is worth roughly £12m! That should keep his pets fed and watered for the foreseeable.\n\nHow tall is Martin Clunes?\n\nMartin is 1.89 m tall.\n\nMartin Clunes' TV shows\n\nMartin Clunes in Men Behaving Badly\n\nMartin is probably best known for his work on Men Behaving Badly which has many loyal viewers to this day. He played Gary Strange, alongside Neil Morrissey, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash. The series, which ran from 1992-1998, saw the two men living together and getting up to all sorts of disgusting (but amusing) laddish behaviour, mostly involving beer.\n\nMartin Clunes in Manhunt\n\nIn 2018 Martin took on the role of a lifetime, in Manhunt, playing real-life police officer DCI Colin Sutton, who famously solved the Milly Dowler murder case.\n\nThe drama played out the shocking real life story of the memoirs of former London Metropolitan police detective DCI Colin Sutton (played by Martin Clunes). DCI Sutton became well known for his tireless work pursuing serial killer Levi Bellfield.\n\nIt followed the horrific murder of French National Amelie Delagrange on Twickenham Green back in 2004, and how thanks to DCI Sutton it was linked to the murders of Marsha McDonnell in 2003 and schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002.\n\nThe series came under much fire after critics labelled the move 'insensitive' and claimed it 'rakes up the past' of the horrible events.\n\nMartin Clunes in Doc Martin\n\nOne of Martin's most popular shows is ITV drama Doc Martin where Martin plays the title character alongside Caroline Catz. Set in the fictional seaside village of Portwenn, the series started airing in 2004 and has currently run for nine series with many avid fans of the grumpy Doc. Sadly in April 2020 the tenth and final series of Doc Martin was confirmed by director Nigel Cole.\n\nMartin Clunes in Goodbye Mr Chips\n\nIn 2002, Martin took the role as Mr. Chipping in the TV movie Goodbye Mr Chips which was based on a novella about the life of a schoolteacher, first published in October 1934.\n\nMartin Clunes in Warren\n\nMartin starred in the sitcom Warren, which is about a grumpy driving instructor. Unfortunately, the six-part series wasn't recommissioned by the BBC with viewing figures not as high as expected. Warren was a character who struggles with problems of his own making, and Martin has said: \"the script is just so funny I didn't want anyone else to do it.\"\n\nThe script was written by Jimmy Donny Cosgrove and Paul McKenna (no, not THAT Paul McKenna!) Martin hasn't been in a sitcom since 2009's The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.\n\nMartin Clunes in Come Fly With Me\n\nMartin was referenced in the comedy show Come Fly With Me. Characters Nanako and Asuka (played by Matt Lucas and David Walliams) are obsessed with Martin and own several Japanese Martin Clunes merchandise and products. They are delighted to hear Martin is due to land in the airport and go to meet their idol however upon learning this news, Martin has his plane diverted to RAF Northolt.\n\nMartin Clunes in Australia\n\nBack in 2016, Martin hosted the three part documentary series Martin Clunes: Islands of Australia (also known as Islands of Oz) which was adapted from Martin's other show, Islands of Britain. The show follows Martin exploring various islands off the Australian mainland.\n\nMartin Clunes: My Travels and Other Animals\n\nIn this 12 part series, Martin learns how to look after the planet's vulnerable animals as he travels around the world meeting those trying to learn more about these beasts.\n\nCatch up on ITV player now.\n\nMartin Clunes: Islands of the Pacific\n\nIn his latest three-part show, Martin embarks on an epic ocean wide adventure in search of the real Pacific. His voyage was inspired by reading a book given to him when he was a child by his father about the Kon-Tiki expedition across the Pacific. Martin has always yearned to follow in those explorers’ footsteps.\n\nWatch on ITV player now.\n\nMartin Clunes' dogs\n\nMartin adores dogs, and used his enthusiasm to present Martin Clunes: A Man and his Dogs in 2008. He went on to narrate the documentary Secret Life of Dogs in 2013, which led to Secret Life of Cats and Secret Life of Babies.\n\nOther animal-related documentaries narrated by Martin have included Martin Clunes and A Lion Called Mugie (which followed conservation work in Kenya), Martin Clunes: Man to Manta, Martin Clunes: The Lemurs of Madagascar, Britain’s Favourite Dogs and Man and Beast with Martin Clunes.\n\nMartin Clunes' love for horses and horsepower\n\nAlong with dogs, Martin’s other passion is horses – he even became president of the British Horse Society in 2011. In 2010 he presented the series Horsepower, about man’s relationship with horses, followed by Heavy Horsepower in 2013. He lives on a farm with 14 horses – so he clearly knows his stuff!\n\nMartin Clunes' weight loss\n\nThe actor lost a considerable amount of weight in 2012 thanks to following the 5:2 diet. He said: \"I was getting heavy, I had tired knees\". He lost three stone in three months with the diet, which involves fasting for two days a week and eating as normal on the other five. Now that he's down to a weight he's happy with, he follows a 6:1 diet (the same, but only one day's fast per week). Working on his farm keeps him fit too, with horse riding in particular.\n\nMartin Clunes' films\n\nIn 1998 he appeared in Shakespeare In Love where Martin Clunes played Richard Burbage. He’s also appeared in The Russia House, Sweet Revenge and Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey? as Jeremy Shepherd.\n\nPopular articles to read next\n\nSandi Toksvig: Her spouse, children and The Great British Bake Off\n\nJohn and Nula Suchet open up about their dementia journey"
