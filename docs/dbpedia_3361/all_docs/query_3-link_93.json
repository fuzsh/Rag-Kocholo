Following his wedding day disaster with Louisa, Martin is now focused on leaving Portwenn and returning to his job as a top class surgeon in London. But will he be able to conquer his fear of blood first? And will a pretty large obstacle affect his plans? We sat down with Martin Clunes for a wee chinwag to find out more.\n\nDoc Martin airs Sundays at 9pm on ITV1.\n\nAdditional reporting by Tom Mansell"
