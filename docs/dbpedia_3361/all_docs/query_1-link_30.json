The case begins when a French student is discovered on Twickenham Green, having sustained fatal head injuries. Martin Clunes stars as DCI Colin Sutton of the Metropolitan Police, who is placed in charge of the investigation.\"\n\nBellfield was jailed for the horrific murders of three young women and attempting to kill another. He was sentenced to life in 2008 for the murders of Marsha McDonnell, 19, and Amelie Delagrange, 22, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18. And then, in 2011, he was found guilty of the murder of Milly Dowler, 13, and given another life term, becoming the only serial killer to have been given two whole life sentences.\n\nThe first Manhunt series is adapted from Colin Sutton's book of the same name, in which he details how he brought Bellfield to justice. He was brought in as a senior investigating officer to help police find new leads at the time of the killing of French student Amelie Delagrange, who was found on Twickenham Green in south London in 2004. More on the true story behind Manhunt series 1 here\n\nThe second series of Manhunt looks at the case of Delroy Grant, a serial rapist known as The Night Stalker. In 2009, DCI Colin Sutton was brought in to join Operation Minstead, the ongoing investigation launched by the Metropolitan Police to solve a series of rapes that spanned 17 years.\n\nHow many episodes are there?\n\nThe first series of Manhunt has three episodes that originally aired in January 2019. The second series has four episodes and originally aired in September 2021.\n\nThe first series is being shown again this week, starting on Wednesday, June 7, at 9pm on ITV1. The two remaining episodes air at the same time on Thursday, June 8, and Friday, June 9.\n\nWhere was Manhunt filmed?\n\nFor the first series, actor Celyn Jones (who plays Bellfield) and Martin Clunes were spotted filming scenes in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, where Milly Dowler went missing in 2002.\n\nITV also filmed at the block of flats in West Drayton where Bellfield was arrested. The drama was also filmed on Twickenham Green, where Amelie Delagrange was killed in 2004, and also in Maidenhead where Bellfield had worked as a bouncer in 2001.\n\nFor the second series, the story is set in southeast London, where the crimes took place, but most of the filming was done in Bristol. The old Bank of England building on Bridge Street was transformed into a London police station. Other Bristol locations included the 'A Bond' Warehouse in the Floating Harbour docks, the Lord Mayor's Reception Room in City Hall, Knowle Cricket Club, Henleaze Junior School and the railway arches in Stapleton Road.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
