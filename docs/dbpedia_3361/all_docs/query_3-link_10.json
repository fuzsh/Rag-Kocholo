It first broadcast on BBC Two in 1990 in the 9 pm slot on Thursdays nights which became the traditional time for alternative comedy on television.

It starred Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, a young gentleman with a \"distinctive blend of airy nonchalance and refined gormlessness\", and Stephen Fry as Jeeves, his improbably well-informed and talented valet. Wooster is a bachelor, a minor aristocrat and member of the idle rich. He and his friends, who are mainly members of The Drones Club, are extricated from all manner of societal misadventures by the indispensable valet Jeeves. The stories are set in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1930s. When Fry and Laurie began the series they were already a popular double act due to regular appearances on Channel 4's Friday Night Live and their own show A Bit of Fry & Laurie.\n\nIslands of Britain\n\nMartin Clunes\n\nPremiered : 2009\n\nIslands of Britain is a 2009 documentary series, filmed over the summers of 2008 and 2009, hosted by Martin Clunes, which visited a number of the islands that lie off the coast of Great Britain."
