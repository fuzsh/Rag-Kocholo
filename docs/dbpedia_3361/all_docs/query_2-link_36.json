He has also written books for the Mountain and Rivers TV series and recently published \"Insufficiently Welsh\" following his ITV series about Wales. He made a quiz programme \"The Quizeum\" for BBC4.\n\nGriff recently played the lead role in \"The Miser\" by Moliere in the West End and appeared on Celebrity Bake Off.

He can currently be seen on Channel 4 in Griff’s Canadian Adventures.\n\nHe spent many years fund-raising to restore the Hackney Empire, is a patron of many other charities and the President of Civic Voice and the Victorian Society.
