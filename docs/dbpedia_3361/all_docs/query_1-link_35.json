        "text": "Martin Clunes is currently portraying DCI Colin Sutton in the new series of ITV's Manhunt.\n\nThe gripping true-crime drama The Night Stalker follows the detective as he works tirelessly to catch serial rapist Delroy Grant who operated in South East London for 17 years.\n\nMartin also played Sutton in the first series Manhunt back in 2019 which followed Sutton's role in capturing serial killer Levi Bellfield.\n\nThis week, viewers at home have been praising him for his portrayal of Sutton and hailed his acting performance as 'extraordinary' and 'incredible'.\n\nREAD MORE: Ex-EastEnders heartthrob who played Joey Branning is starring alongside Martin Clunes in The Night Stalker\n\nThe 59-year-old actor from Wimbledon has been a star on the small screen for years with a very long list of acting credits including Men Behaving Badly, William and Mary, Doc Martin, and Reggie Perrin.\n\nHowever, away from Martin's showbiz success, life couldn't be more different for the TV icon as he lives a quiet lifestyle with his family far away from his South West London roots.\n\nFamily Life\n\nMartin married his wife Philippa Braithwaite in 1997 after the pair met whilst working alongside each other, and are still going strong.\n\nPhilippa is a TV and film producer and is famed for her work on Sliding Doors (1998), Doc Martin (2019), and most recently the series, Manhunt (2019).\n\nThe actor proposed to his adored wife whilst filming a documentary a Hawaii, after their work commitments had kept them apart.\n\nIn an interview with the Irish News, Martin recalled the time when he got down on one knee, saying: \"I was doing a holiday programme and they'd agreed to fly Philippa out.\n\n\"I'd done San Francisco and Hawaii on the same trip and she came out at the end of the Hawaii shoot.\n\n\"It was the longest we'd been apart, and I missed her so much that I proposed, while she was really jet-lagged and in such a strange place.\"\n\nThe couple has one daughter called Emily Clunes.\n\nAfter living in the big smoke for years the Clunes family decided to move away from hectic London life and moved to Dorset in 2013.\n\nThey now reside on a 130-acre farm near Beaminster which is home to an array of animals including horses, chicken, dogs and cats.\n\nMaking the most of their farm life the family even hosts an annual fair to raise money for charity.\n\nWho is Emily Clunes?\n\nHaving a very famous father and a television producer mother would push some children into the spotlight, however, their daughter has taken a different path in life.\n\nEmily is pursuing a career in equestrian, thanks to her country lifestyle, and judging by her Instagram profile she's very talented.\n\nThe 22-year-old can be seen in action as her horse makes various jumps in competitions.\n\nAlthough, Emily did once star alongside her dad Martin in an episode of Doc Martin.\n\nShe had a small speaking role in episode eight of Doc Martin series four.\n\nIn the episode, she delivered the line: “Are you okay, Miss?”\n\nIn some selfies posted to social media, there's also no wondering who her parents are as she resembles her father!\n\nManhunt: The Night Stalker concludes on Thursday (September 23) at 9pm. However, you can catch-ip on the ITV Hub and Britbox"
