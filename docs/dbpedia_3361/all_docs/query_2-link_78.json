Current wildfires have burned 2,061,572 acres. About 18,000 wildland firefighters and support ... personnel are assigned to wildfires, including 18 complex and one Type 1 incident management teams, 418 crews, 705 engines, 95 helicopters, and one Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS). No other country in the world has a public land system like the United States. Please do your part in protecting it. Remember and teach campfire safety to your children. Make sure campfires are dead out by using dirt and water when stirring the coals. Use a shovel to help properly extinguish your campfire and keep it nearby, just in case. Be careful with matches and lighters and carefully extinguish all smoking materials. Together we can prevent unwanted wildfires.

These agencies manage wildland fire on nearly 700 million acres of federal public land, or one-fifth of the total land area in the United States.\n\nNIFC is home to the national fire management programs of each federal fire agency, along with partners including the National Association of State Foresters, the U.S. Fire Administration, and the National Weather Service. A Department of Defense liaison was added as a permanent partner at NIFC in 2008. Working together, these partners provide leadership, policy oversight and coordination to manage the nation‚Äôs wildland fire programs.\n\nIn recent years, the role of the agencies at NIFC has grown to include all types of fire management, including hazardous fuels treatments, integrated fire and land-use planning, and more. Fire management under this larger umbrella is designed to achieve not only suppression goals, but to accomplish a broad spectrum of natural resource objectives, and do so in an efficient, cost-effective manner.\n\nImage\n\nNIFC Gallery\n\nPowered by flickr embed.\n\nHave a wildland fire photo to share?\n\nSend it our way!\n\nNIFC Videos"
