        "text": "ITV is bringing its Manhunt series back to our screens this week. The detective drama is coming back for three nights starting on June 7.\n\nMartin Clunes stars as DCI Colin Sutton of the Metropolitan Police. And now the first series is returning for a new run this week, focusing on the search for a serial killer in London.\n\nManhunt begins with police looking into the death of French student Amelie Delagrange. The Metropolitan Police assign Detective Chief Inspector Sutton to lead a large task force, which eventually leads to the arrest of a man called Levi Bellfield.\n\nThe drama is based on the memoirs of the real Colin Sutton in a book he wrote about how he caught the serial killer. So what is the real story behind the Manhunt TV series?\n\nREAD MORE: BBC1 Annika filming locations including major change from original story\n\nWhat's the true story of the Levi Bellfield killings?\n\nDCI Colin Sutton was brought in to look at the murder of 22-year-old French student Amelie Delagrange, who was found on Twickenham Green in August 2004, with serious head injuries. Amelie died in hospital the same night.\n\nHe soon came to the conclusion she might have been killed by the same person who had murdered Marsha McDonnell 18 months earlier. Marsha, who was 19, was beaten over the head in February 2003 after she got off a bus, and died in hospital two days later.\n\nA possible suspect, Levi Bellfield, was put under surveillance and seen driving around in a white van, talking to young women at bus stops. He was arrested at his home on suspicion of the murder of Amelie.\n\nAt a trial in 2008, Bellfield was convicted of the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, who was run over as she crossed a road. He was sentenced to life.\n\nAnd then, in 2011, the man a judge described as a \"cruel and pitiless killer\" was linked to the death of Milly Dowler and convicted of her murder. Bellfield was given another life term, becoming the only serial killer to have been given two whole life sentences.\n\nMilly had gone missing in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002, as she walked home from school. Her body was found in Yateley, Hampshire, six months later. Police found evidence that she had last been seen walking past Bellfield's flat.\n\nAt the time of his conviction, detectives said they believed Bellfield was responsible for a further 20 attacks on women that had remained unsolved. He was said to have admitted his involvement in 2015, while in prison, but co-ordinated investigations across multiple police forces did not find any proof linking him to the other killings.\n\nIn a statement in 2016, the Metropolitan Police said: \"All lines of inquiry have now been exhausted and the decision has been taken to close this investigation as there is no evidence to link the individual to any case for which he has not already been convicted.\"\n\nManhunt series 1 returned on Wednesday, June 7, at 9pm on ITV1. The two remaining episodes air at the same time on Thursday, June 8, and Friday, June 9.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
