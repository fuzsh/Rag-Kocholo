        "text": "DEMOB HAPPY are back in thunderous form with the announcement of a brand new album called Holy Doom.\n\nDue for release on 23rd March 2018 via SO Recordings, our first insight into the forthcoming record is the riff-heavy ‘Be Your Man’; three and a half minutes of crunching guitars, Beatles-esque harmonies and storming choruses. The matching video is an appropriately vintage affair which pays homage to old-school music shows with a slight hint of tongue-in-cheek.\n\nBassist and vocalist Matthew Marcantonio said: ” “We like old videos of bands on TV shows, they have this unorganised quality to them, before this standardised version of what a performer should do and how to act. it was looser and more care free, they took the piss out of it all”\n\nAlongside the album announcement and new video, the band have shared plans for European tour with Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes. After supporting The Cribs this December as part of their Cribsmas shows, they will head out on a lengthy tour next spring as Carter’s main support act.\n\nCheck out the new video below."
