        "text": "Lucille Ball welcomes a variety of celebrity guests to her second sitcom, which leads these TV shows that are new on DVD this week.\n\n\"The Lucy Show: The Official Fourth Season\" (CBS/Paramount, 1965-66, four discs, $42.99). This was the irrepressible redhead's second sitcom after her seminal series \"I Love Lucy.\" Vivian Vance was again her co-star — until this season. Vance departed at the end of Season 3.\n\nAs a result, the show was revamped for this fourth year, with Lucy Carmichael moving to Southern California, as does her bombastic banker Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon), who becomes her boss. The kids are dispatched early on and the series essentially becomes focused on weekly guest stars. But it certainly didn't hurt the show, which bounced up to No. 3 in the Nielsen ratings and remained in the top four over the rest of its run.\n\nThis set is loaded with bonus features, and Season 4 is also notable for the first episode having been partially shot on location at Marineland of the Pacific. (Trivia note: Marineland was Southern California's first major theme park, having opened a year before Disneyland, but SeaWorld bought it out in the mid-1980s, simply to close it and move its oceanic attractions to the still-popular San Diego facility).\n\nGuests in this season include Kirk Douglas, Edward G. Robinson, Dean Martin, Ann Sothern (in three episodes, reprising a character that appeared in Season 3), Joan Blondell (in two), Mel Torme, Milton Berle, Danny Thomas, Art Linkletter, Mickey Rooney, Harvey Korman, Clint Walker and Robert Stack. And one episode has a cameo by William Frawley, who played Fred Mertz on \"I Love Lucy,\" his last performance before his death.\n\nExtras: full frame, 26 episodes, featurettes, promos, original credits, text biographies/production notes, photo galleries, excerpts from TV shows with Lucy's guest appearances, \"Magic of Broadcasting\" (1966) and \"Wonderful World of Burlesque (1965).\n\n\"Growing Pains: The Complete Second Season\" (Warner, 1986-87, three discs, $29.98). It's been five years since Season 1 was released so fans have been clamoring for this one. Kirk Cameron, Alan Thicke, Joanna Kerns, Tracey Gold and young Jeremy Miller fill out the cast of this sitcom about the Seaver family getting in and out of comic scrapes. Guests include Gordon Jump, Kristy Swanson, Olivia d'Abo and Heather Graham.\n\nExtras: full frame, 22 episodes\n\n\"The President's Book of Secrets\" (History, 2010, $19.95). Documentary exploring secrets that have been passed down from president to president, such as aspects of Air Force One and material so highly classified that even he doesn't have access, with comments from former intelligence operatives as well as historians.\n\nExtras: widescreen\n\n\"Stan Lee's Superhumans: The Complete Season One\" (History, 2010, $19.95). The \"Spider-Man\" creator co-hosts this series with Daniel Browning Smith, \"the most flexible man in the world,\" as the show profiles people with unique genetic traits. The episode titles tell it all: \"The Human Calculator,\" \"Rubber Band Man,\" \"Super Memory,\" etc.\n\nExtras: widescreen, eight episodes, deleted scenes\n\n\"20th Century With Mike Wallace: America at War\" (Athena/CBS, 2010, three discs, $49.99). Wallace hosts these documentaries covering various aspects of the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Gulf War, as well as the finale, \"The Changing Face of Warfare,\" which looks at how modern technology has altered the battlefield. Veteran journalists Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Morley Safer are featured.\n\nExtras: widescreen, updates; 12-page booklet\n\n\"Demob\" (Acorn, 1993, two discs, $39.99). The title is short for \"demobilized\" from army life after World War II, referring specifically to Capt. Ian Deasey (Griff Rhys Jones) and Lance Corp. Dick Dobson (Martin Clunes, well before he landed \"Doc Martin\"). They are wartime entertainers who decide to try their bawdy stage comedy in peacetime London, where they become a cabaret act at the Blue Parrot. \"Blue\" being the operative word. There is some language and nudity.\n\nExtras: full frame, six episodes\n\n\"Doc Martin Collection: Series 1-4\" (Acorn, 2004-09, nine discs, $99.99). This is the show that made Martin Clunes a national treasure in Great Britain as he plays a misanthropic medical man who is exiled to a village on the sea, where all kinds of quirky characters reside and drive him to distraction. Naturally, he returns the favor. This show kicked off the same year that \"House\" debuted in America, but \"Doc Martin\" is more directly aimed at comedy and therefore more enjoyable.\n\nExtras: widescreen, 30 episodes, text filmographies/trivia, photo gallery\n\n\"The Universe: The Mega Collection\" (History/Blu-ray, 2007-10, 16 discs, $179.95). This mammoth gathering of all five seasons of the remarkable documentary series is a real treat, filled with computer graphics that really sparkle in the luster of high definition as the show investigates everything from distant planets to collapsing suns and everything in between.\n\nExtras: widescreen, 63 episodes, 3-D episode \"7 Wonders of the Solar System,\" documentary \"Beyond the big Bang,\" featurettes on meteors, comets and backyard astronomers.\n\n\"Tikki Tikki Tembo … and more stories to celebrate Asian heritage\" (Scholastic, 2011, $14.95). More animated tales, this time focusing on Asian traditions, including the title story, \"The Tale of the Mandarin Ducks, \"Sam and the Lucky Monkey\" and three more. For ages 3-10.\n\nExtras: full frame, six stories"
