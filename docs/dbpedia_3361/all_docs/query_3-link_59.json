        "text": "Martin Clunes is shaking off his gentle comedy-drama image of Doc Martin to fight vicious drug dealers in an explosive new drama that will address rising County lines drug traffickers.\n\nThe 61-year-old actor has built up a successful career mainly as a comedy actor - from his breakout role as Gary in iconic sitcom Men Behaving Badly in the 1990s to his loveable role as Dr Martin Ellingham which lasted from 2004 until 2022. But now fans will see him in a gritty new drama playing a retired farmer who discovers his vulnerable son has become involved in a dangerous drug dealing ring.\n\nThe Sun reports that ITV have commissioned a new show called Out There which will explore the impact of county lines drug dealers in a quiet countryside town. While Martin himself will have a leading role as a character named Nathan Williams who will be forced to address the dark changes happening within his community.\n\nThe series will reunite Martin with creative duo Ed Whitmore and Marc Evans who respectively wrote and directed the police drama Manhunt which aired on ITV from 2019 until 2021 and starred Martin as DCI Colin Sutton. And it seems Martin is more than happy to be back working with the pair after their previous show ended up being BAFTA nominated.\n\nThe former Men Behaving Badly star said: \"I’m very happy to be working with Marc Evans and Ed Whitmore again after the success of Manhunt. Out There couldn’t be more different from Doc Martin. It’s pretty dark, but definitely a story worth telling.\"\n\nIndeed, writer Ed explained that he thinks the county lines drug issue is a serious and growing problem across the UK that needs to be addressed. And the fact that it is happening \"in plain sight\" only adds to the urgency of the story being told. He said: “County lines is a particularly vicious and ruthless wave of drug dealing that uses fear and violence to coerce, often vulnerable, young people into working as runners and dealers... The fundamental premise of Out There - a widowed farmer who discovers that his son has fallen foul of county lines - immediately spoke to me as a story I wanted to tell.”\n\nThe show has reportedly already started filming in Wales. It will be Martin’s first major role back on screens since Doc Martin ended last year after an 18 year run.\n\nThe star shared his love for the show when it came to an end, saying in July last year: “I have loved going to Cornwall to make Doc Martin over the past 18 years. I have looked forward to returning to this beautiful county this year for the 10th and final series.\n\n\"The people of Cornwall, and Port Isaac in particular, have always been so helpful to us when we are making the series.\n\n\"We have some great storylines for the new series, and for the Christmas special, which I hope Doc Martin fans will love. I shall miss Cornwall and all the lovely people we have worked with. But it is the right time to say farewell to the Doc, and Portwenn.\""
