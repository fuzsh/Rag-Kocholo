        "text": "With over 30 years of production experience and numerous awards to her name, Jo has worked with much of the finest talent in British TV drama and comedy. Most recently she has produced the second series of MANHUNT, starring Martin Clunes, for Buffalo Pictures/ITV. The first series averaged over 9 million viewers. You can read her full biography here or check out her IMDB profile.\n\nIf you want to hire Jo as a freelance producer, please contact her via her agent Sara Putt at Sara Putt Associates\n\nReviews\n\n“This sober, responsible production has managed to avoid the temptation of hyping it as Martin Clunes’s first foray into straight drama and aggrandising him or the production at the victims’ expense. Clunes does fine work as an utterly ordinary detective finding himself in charge of an utterly extraordinary investigation.”\n\n“It takes a very good actor to make a real, do-it-by-the-book detective, who isn’t a hard drinker and doesn’t shoot from the hip, come alive on screen.”\n\n“Even though we know the outcome, I found myself rooting for Sutton and his team. I’ll be glued over the next two nights as the net closes in.”\n\n“This seemed to me a sober and responsible attempt to tell a true story of good police work making connections and getting results which probably saved lives…this was another ITV crime drama of the highest order.”\n\n“This is a realistic glimpse into actual policing, where originality counts a good deal less than persistence.”\n\nManhunt: The Nightstalker\n\nJo produced the second series of Manhunt, which was broadcast in September 2021. It is currently shortlisted for the Broadcast Awards 2022 in the category Best Drama Series or Serial.\n\nReviews\n\n‘It is a chilling account, but avoids being unnecessarily prurient by showing the mechanics of the investigation: the flawed DNA testing, shifting office politics, the background bureaucracy. Fortunately Clunes stands as a raincoated force for good in a terrifying world.’\n\n‘Evans – an expert at twitchy paranoia- keeps things taut, and Clunes’ innate decency keeps things on track whenever it tends to the exploitative; the attacks themselves are thankfully off camera, but the aftermaths are harrowing enough.’\n\n‘If there is any TV series that does a better job of re-enacting true crime than ITV’s Manhunt I do not know it, and would wish you to tell me of it. But I think we all know it doesn’t exist.’"
