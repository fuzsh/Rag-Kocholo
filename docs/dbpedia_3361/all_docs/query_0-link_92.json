        "text": "A richly imaginative mix of CSI-style forensic police procedurals and Victorian-era detective mysteries, Acorn Media's MURDOCH MYSTERIES: SEASON 3 is rousing good fun in every way.\n\nToronto of the late 1890s is the setting for the adventures of Inspector William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson), a brilliant young detective whose fascination with the scientific advancements of \"The Age of Invention\" gives him an invaluable advantage in solving the most baffling homicide cases. While his crusty boss Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig) is an old-school copper with a more sledgehammer approach to police work, he recognizes and supports the value of Murdoch's modern methods even when he doesn't understand them, giving him a free hand.\n\nThis is an impeccably produced series with outstanding period atmosphere. The stories, based on the novels of author Maureen Jennings, are well-written and filled with intriguing situations and wry dialogue laced with subtle humor. A wide range of baffling mysteries include everything from a locked-door murder in which the victim appears to have been cooked from the inside out (\"The Tesla Effect\") to an apparent haunting in a cursed mansion (\"The Curse of Beaton Manor\").\n\nUnlike the aloof, arrogant, and coldly-methodical Sherlock Holmes, Murdoch (as wonderfully played by Bisson) is an unassuming gentleman of deep moral and spiritual conviction--he crosses himself whenever he discovers a dead body--who is driven by a sense of propriety and compassion. This sometimes hinders his impartiality and in certain cases causes him to arrive at incorrect conclusions, though he always reasons his way to the truth eventually. The fact that Murdoch possesses certain fallibilities, along with a tinge of Victorian rigidity that conflicts with his more liberal convictions, makes his master-detective character all the more complex and disarmingly appealing.\n\nIn a particularly interesting ongoing storyline, Murdoch's suspicion that eccentric millionaire-inventor James Pendrick (Peter Stebbings) is a criminal mastermind behind a series of high-profile crimes will lead to several scintillating encounters culminating in the exciting season finale. While Pendrick proves a challenging intellectual match for Murdoch, his beautiful and mysterious wife Sally (Kate Greenhouse) becomes a tempting distraction as her relationship with Murdoch grows almost indecently bold.\n\nThe retro-futuristic concepts and devices which are so cleverly woven into each plotline are consistently intriguing without veering into the improbable or becoming mere gimmicks. These run the gamut from simple things such as Murdoch's use of \"fingermarks\" in identifying suspects, to larger concepts like eugenics and a microwave death ray as conceived by Nikola Tesla (Dmitry Chepovetsky). One of the show's many pleasures is watching Murdoch dazzle the admiring Inspector Brackenreid time and again with his newfangled techniques while leaving their stuffy, skeptical superiors in a state of consternation.\n\nAlso on the cutting edge of science as well as the burgeoning women's movement is the precinct's ace medical examiner, Dr. Julia Ogden (a radiant Helene Joy). Dr. Ogden applies her up-to-date forensic skills to an endless parade of murder victims and comes up with evidence that would've been undetectable using more antiquated methods. Bisson and Joy have a warm chemistry together during the scenes in which their characters pursue a long and chaste courtship, which reaches a crisis stage in the season cliffhanger with Dr. Ogden making a fateful decision about her medical career.\n\nAdditional characters include Jonny Harris as Constable George Crabtree, a bright but callow young officer eager to follow in Murdoch's footsteps, and Lachlan Murdoch as comic-relief bumbler Constable Higgins. In addition to Nikol Tesla, Murdoch also meets author H.G. Wells (Peter Mikhail) in the eugenics-based episode \"Future Imperfect.\" Fans of the homespun Canadian comedy series \"The Red Green Show\" will be pleased to find regulars Patrick McKenna (\"Harold Green\") as an inept visiting detective in the season opener \"The Murdoch Identity\" and Peter Keleghan (\"Ranger Gord\") as a shady government agent in \"The Tesla Effect.\"\n\nOther noteworthy episodes include: \"Me, Myself, and Murdoch\", a study of multiple personalities with a dazzling performance by guest star Anastasia Phillips as a troubled girl found with a bloody axe in her hands after the murder of her father; \"Rich Boy, Poor Boy\", in which Inspector Brackenreid's own son Bobby is kidnapped after being mistaken for a millionaire's son; \"The Great Wall\", a tale of anti-Chinese racism with Murdoch's investigation of a cop killer possibly implicating members of a rival precinct; and \"Love and Human Remains\", in which the mummified bodies of three people challenge Murdoch and Dr. Ogden to solve a 60-year-old murder mystery. Season opener \"The Murdoch Identity\" finds the amnesia-stricken detective in a quest to track down his own past while eluding a gang of unknown men who are out to kill him.\n\nThe four-disc, 13-episode DVD set from Acorn Media is in 16:9 widescreen with Dolby Digital stereo sound and English subtitles. Extras consist of three brief featurettes (making of, costumes, makeup) and an alternate ending for episode 13 \"The Tesla Effect\" which wraps up a dangling storyline in the event that the series wasn't picked up for a fourth season (it was).\n\nNicely blending a hazy atmosphere of Victorian antiquity with intriguing flashes of the modern, MURDOCH MYSTERIES: SEASON 3 is a satisfying, finely-rendered detective series brimming with creativity and imagination. Best of all, it's stocked with characters that you'll enjoy spending time with.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com:\n\nDVD\n\nBlu-Ray\n\nMURDOCH MYSTERIES: SEASON 3 -- DVD review by porfle\n\nOSCAR WINNER© NICOLAS CAGE STARS IN THE SUPERNATURAL ACTION-ADVENTURE \"SEASON OF THE WITCH\"\n\nArrives on Blu-ray and DVD June 28\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (April 28) – Oscar© winner Nicolas Cage ('National Treasure', Best Actor, ‘Leaving Las Vegas’) and Ron Perlman ('Hellboy', TV’s ‘Sons of Anarchy’) star in SEASON OF THE WITCH, a supernatural action adventure about a heroic Crusader, Knight Behmen (Cage) and his fellow soldier, Felson (Perlman) who must transport a woman accused of being a witch to a remote monastery.

Okay...maybe we haven't heard this one that many times.\n\nThere's enough material right there for a pretty good story, but CRAZY LOVE (2007) just keeps getting crazier. This has got to be the most bizarre love story I've ever heard, or at least in the top three. It's all true, too--nobody could make this stuff up. And, like Forrest Gump or Zelig, the strange saga of Burt and Linda is laced with famous people and historical events that make it even more compelling. But before it's all over, they're pretty famous themselves.\n\nIt all started the day a young ambulance-chasing lawyer and B-movie producer named Burt Pugach, described by one interviewee as resembling the nebbishy actor Arnold Stang, laid eyes on a beautiful young woman name Linda Niss on a street corner in the Bronx back in 1957. Burt's aggressively full-throttle courtship of Linda began immediately, and while she wasn't nearly as taken with him, his extravagant lifestyle was attractive to her--until she found out he was already married and his current wife had no intention of granting him a divorce. With that, she ended their \"engagement\" and began to seek romance elsewhere.\n\nBurt did not take this well. What follows is an increasingly outrageous series of events that include the aforementioned acid incident, Burt's bizarre trial in which he served as his own defense and ended up in prison for several years (where he was almost killed during the Attica uprising), and his eventual parole, when--sure enough--he started stalking Linda all over again.\n\nThe present-day Burt, a normal-enough looking older guy, sits cheerfully recounting his craze-o past while you can almost see the image of his beloved Linda still swirling through his mind and lighting up his eyes. Meanwhile, there sits a barely-recognizable Linda somewhere else (somewhere far away from Burt, we hope), \"bald and blind\" as a friend describes her, wearing an obvious wig and dark glasses, puffing a cigarette and giving her side of the story. We aren't told the present circumstances of the two for a long time--it's an intriguing mystery that runs through most of the film and isn't resolved until the final act, which left me almost numb with disbelief.\n\nThis offbeat documentary by Dan Klores, who gave us the excellent VIVA BASEBALL! two years earlier, and co-director Fisher Stevens, is loaded with on-camera interviews with many of the people involved, which are all smoothly linked together with old photographs and home movies of Burt and Linda, vintage stock footage from the New York State Archives and other sources, and lots of news footage. There's also a killer soundtrack with songs from Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis, Edie Brickell, and several others, plus a cool original score by Douglas J. Cuomo, all nicely evocative of the period.\n\nBut it's those interview segments with Burt and Linda that get ya the most, especially when CRAZY LOVE reaches its final minutes and the true craziness of the whole thing is finally revealed. Everybody loves a love story, they say, but I'm not sure everybody's quite ready for this one.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nCRAZY LOVE -- movie review by porfle\n\nFollowing the critically-acclaimed release of Upstairs, Downstairs: 40th Anniversary Edition, Acorn Media’s upcoming DVD release calendar features several highly entertaining British series previously unavailable to U.S. audiences, including Identity, a slick identity theft series with Upstairs, Downstairs revival star Keeley Hawes and The Wire’s Aidan Gillen; and the inspiration for the star-studded American remake in development at ABC.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. debuts of the third season of Murdoch Mysteries (DVD and Blu-ray) - the critically-acclaimed Sherlock Holmes meets CSI series; The Feathered Serpent Complete Series, the cult classic set in ancient Mexico featuring Patrick Troughton (Doctor Who, The Omen); Circles of Deceit, riveting spy thrillers featuring Dennis Waterman (New Tricks) and guest stars Derek Jacobi, Corin Redgrave, John Hannah, and Leo McKern; and Genius of Britain: The Scientists Who Changed the World a new documentary featuring Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins, James Dyson, and David Attenborough discussing the legacies of their heroes.\n\nAlso, Robin of Sherwood, Set 1, the definitive retelling of the Robin Hood legend makes its Blu-ray debut with more than eight hours of extras; starring Michael Praed (Dynasty) and Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Departed); and New Tricks Season 4, the must-see, smash hit crime series seen on public television; featuring a brilliant cast, deft writing, and an irresistible blend of compelling drama and dry humor.\n\nThis week: The must-see PBS hit series Doc Martin Collection: Series 1-4 starring Martin Clunes as a British version of House; as well as the light-hearted WWII-era comedy drama Demob also-starring Clunes; and 20th Century with Mike Wallace: America at War, featuring expert analysis from David Halberstam, Robert S.

Needless to say, it's hard to see a good dog get murdered by bad guys, as happens in such films as HONDO, BIG JAKE, and THE ROAD WARRIOR in scenes that I still find painful to watch. Here, the incident occurs early and serves to light the slow fuse for the powderkeg we know will go off before the movie's over.\n\nLike SLING BLADE, this is a leisurely-paced character study that takes place in a rural setting and slowly builds toward a violent climax. Here, the main character of Avery Ludlow is an older gent who lives with his beloved canine companion Red, having tragically lost his wife and two sons years earlier. While enjoying a lazy afternoon's fishing at a secluded lake, Avery is accosted by three young punks--brothers Danny and Harold, and their friend Pete--who first try to rob him and, discovering that the old geezer doesn't have enough cash to bother with, shotgun his dog just for the sadistic hell of it.\n\nCrushed beyond words, Avery tracks down the identity of the shooter and confronts the boy's father, McCormack (a blonde Tom Sizemore), in the hope of at least inspiring a little parental discipline. But it turns out that the father is just as much of a punk as the kid, and a rich, influential one at that, so Avery's only recourse is to pursue legal channels. This not only proves fruitless but eventually escalates into a feud between him and the McCormack clan that we just know aint a-gonna end well.\n\nBrian Cox brings the same quiet intensity to the role of Avery Ludlow as he did when brilliantly portraying the screen's first Hannibal Lecter in Michael Mann's MANHUNTER, although here, needless to say, he's a much more benign character. Any other actor might have given in to temptation and chewed several large chunks of scenery along the way (I'm looking at you, George C. Scott) but Cox maintains a firm resolve throughout, making his moments of silent grief and barely-restrained anger more effective.\n\nHe gets one particularly dramatic single-take scene in which he recounts the lengthy tale of what really happened to his wife and sons to a sympathetic TV reporter named Carrie (Kim Dickens), and it's almost as riveting as Robert Shaw's \"Indianapolis\" story in JAWS. Even when worst finally comes to worst, he never loses his cool, and never seeks the kind of revenge we're used to seeing in stories like this--all he wants is for somebody to own up to what happened and do right by him and old Red.\n\nTom Sizemore is just right as the sort of rich redneck who buys his delinquent son a shotgun for his birthday and doesn't give a damn what he does with it. Noel Fisher succeeds in making us hate his guts as Danny, the kid who pulls the trigger on the dog, while Kyle Gallner as his guilt-ridden brother Harold is somewhat reminiscent of a soulful young Eric Roberts. In lesser roles that are little more than cameos, Robert \"Freddy\" Englund and the always unpredictable Amanda Plummer play the weaselly parents of one of the boys, while HELLRAISER's Ashley Laurence is McCormack's abused wife.\n\nThe direction, begun by Lucky McKee (MAY, THE WOODS) and completed by Trygve Allister Diesen, isn't particularly outstanding and the cinematography tends a bit toward the murky side, but both are adequate. I haven't read the original novel by Jack Ketchum so I can't attest to the faithfulness of Stephen Susco's screenplay, though I can say that it's well-written. The give and take between opposing sides keeps things interesting as it progresses from rocks to baseball bats to arson, and then, finally, to things that go \"pow.\"\n\nOnce you get past that difficult early scene in which the dog dies--and if you're like me, it's indeed hard to do, especially after we're shown what devoted buddies Avery and Red are--this is a slow but engrossing tale that makes its way inexorably toward the final showdown between a man who won't compromise and a group of lowlifes just begging for some good old-fashioned comeuppance. RED delivers, just as long as you aren't expecting to see it dished out Charles Bronson style.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nRED -- movie review by porfle\n\nHAYDEN CHRISTENSEN, JOHN LEQUIZAMO AND THANDIE NEWTON STAR IN THE TERRIFYING APOCOLYPTIC THRILLER \"VANISHING ON 7TH STREET\"\n\nFrom Award-Winning Genre Director Brad Anderson, The Lights Go Out On\n\nBlu-ray Disc And DVD May 17 From Magnolia Home Entertainment\n\nWhen the city of Detroit is suddenly plunged into complete darkness, a group of strangers will need to band together in Vanishing On 7th Street, debuting on Blu-ray Disc and DVD May 17 from Magnolia Home Entertainment. Directed by Brad Anderson (The Machinist, Session 9) and starring Golden Globeânominee Hayden Christensen (Takers, Jumper), Emmy winner John Leguizamo (The Lincoln Lawyer, The Happening), Thandie Newton (For Colored Girls, 2012) and young R&B sensation Jacob Latimore, Vanishing On 7th Street taps into one of humankind’s most primal anxieties: fear of the dark. As the survivors gather at an abandoned tavern, they realize they have found their enemy in the darkness itself, with only their limited light sources available to keep them out of harms way. With time running out, they must face the horrific terror hiding in the shadows.\n\n“A nicely calibrated mix of intellectual dread and visceral shock,” (MSN Movies), the Vanishing On 7th Street Blu-ray Disc and DVD includes suspenseful bonus features including a making-of featurette and commentary by Anderson. The Blu-ray Disc and DVD will be available for the suggested retail price of $29.98 and $26.98, respectively.\n\nSynopsis\n\nAn unexplained blackout plunges the city of Detroit into total darkness, and by the time the sun rises, only a few people remain—surrounded by heaps of empty clothing, abandoned cars and lengthening shadows. A small handful of strangers that have survived the night (Hayden Christensen, Thandie Newton, John Leguizamo and newcomer Jacob Latimore) each find their way to a rundown bar, whose gasoline-powered generator and stockpile of food and drink make it the last refuge in a deserted city. With daylight beginning to disappear completely and whispering shadows surrounding the survivors, they soon discover that the enemy is the darkness itself, and only the few remaining light sources can keep them safe. As time begins to run out for them, darkness closes in and they must face the ultimate terror.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com:\n\nDVD\n\nBlu-Ray\n\n\"Vanishing On 7th Street\" Coming To Blu-ray & DVD May 17\n\n“Dino-Mite, Croc-Tastic!

How ya Doone?\"\n\nThis exchange from the Three Stooges short \"Scotched in Scotland\" was pretty much all I ever knew about Lorna Doone, never having read R.D. Blackmore's 1869 novel, seen any of the previous film adaptations, or eaten the cookies. Now, Acorn Media's DVD release of the Thames Television production of LORNA DOONE (1990) brings me up to speed on the story, although not quite as entertainingly as I might've liked.\n\nIt gets off to a good start with a prologue showing how young John Ridd's father was murdered by Carver Doone (Sean Bean, FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, GOLDENEYE) of the Doone clan, a once-noble family now known as marauding outlaws. This sequence is quite well done and gives John his first glimpse of Lorna, whom Carver has just kidnapped after killing her parents. It also introduces us to the vast, gloomy countryside that plays such a major role in setting the mood of the film.\n\nTwelve years later we find the older John (Clive Owen, SIN CITY) living with his sister Annie (Jane Gurnett) and mother Sarah (Billie Whitelaw, THE OMEN) on their small farm beneath the ever-lowering sky of rural England. A chance meeting with the now-grown Lorna (Polly Walker) sparks a forbidden love that stirs things up big-time between the Ridds and the Doones, leading to a deadly feud involving half the local population.\n\nBeing a fan of Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights\", I was expecting a tempestuous romance similar to that of Heathcliff and Catherine, but the match-up of John and Lorna is a rather tepid affair. It begins with a 17th-century \"meet cute\"--John tumbles over a waterfall while fishing and is plucked from the water by Lorna--and never really gets all that passionate or even convincing. Clive Owen's stiff performance doesn't help, and Polly Walker's Lorna scarcely resembles Bronte's feral nature-child Catherine.\n\nThe most warm and heartfelt love affair, in fact, is the one between John's sister Annie and their cousin, notorious highwayman Tom Faggus (Miles Anderson), who comes to the farm seeking asylum. Tom is a likable rogue and the story comes to life when he's onscreen, whether courting Annie or helping the Ridds fend off the attacking Doone clan in one of the film's two major battle sequences.\n\nIt's here that LORNA DOONE sparks the most interest, although the direction and editing during these scenes is somewhat clumsy. Sean Bean does all he can with his one-note character and is an effective scenery-chewing villain. A later attack on the Doone compound by John and his fellow farmers, after the local militia fails to take action, is another relative highpoint.\n\nStill, it's a pretty bland affair, with uninspired direction and unremarkable performances in the lead roles. The script seems to be checking off the main parts of the story in rather cursory fashion, while the Cliff Notes dialogue lacks depth. It all gets much more involving when we begin to learn of Lorna's true origins, with some pretty grand surprises in store for the Ridd family, but little of it truly effects us on an emotional level.\n\nSupporting performances are strong, with Jane Gurnett and Miles Anderson as Annie and Tom being the most likable members of the cast. Billie Whitelaw, of course, can't help but be good no matter what she's in. As Carver's young son Ensie, who is later adopted by John, the diminutive Euan Grant MacLachlan is wonderfully expressive.\n\nThe DVD from Acorn Media is in fullscreen with Dolby Digital sound and English subtitles. Text-based extras consist of cast filmographies and a biography of novelist R.D. Blackmore.\n\nI probably shouldn't be too picky, since this is a television production that was probably done on a low budget and a tight schedule. It does manage to maintain interest throughout its running time, with a rich period atmosphere and a smattering of fairly good scenes here and there. But in the end, this version of LORNA DOONE does little more than make me want to seek out a better one.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nLORNA DOONE -- DVD review by porfle\n\nIDENTITY\n\nStarring Keeley Hawes (Upstairs, Downstairs, Ashes to Ashes) and Aidan Gillen (The Wire); North American DVD Debut on May 3, 2011\n\nAmerican version starring Angela Bassett and Wentworth Miller in development at ABC\n\n“Superlative.

Keeley Hawes (Upstairs, Downstairs revival, Ashes to Ashes, MI-5) and Aidan Gillen (The Wire, Queer as Folk UK) star in this British series about an elite police team charged with investigating the high-stakes world of identity theft. Broadcast on ITV in the U.K. in July 2010 and available to U.S. audiences for the first time, Identity features realistic plots and intelligent writing and offers a riveting glimpse into one of the 21st century’s most ubiquitous crimes. The DVD 2-Disc Set includes six episodes, as well as text interviews with the cast, and cast filmographies ($39.99, www.AcornOnline.com). An American remake is currently in development at ABC starring Angela Bassett (ER) and Wentworth Miller (Prison Break).\n\nUncovering the dark side of reinvention, Identity follows an elite police unit tracking identity thieves and their unwitting victims. DSI Martha Lawson (Keeley Hawes) assembles a crack team of investigators, betting her reputation on their results. Cavalier DI John Bloom (Aidan Gillen) has undercover experience and knows exactly what it’s like to live a lie. Ambitious DS Anthony Wareing (Shaun Parkes, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries) clashes with Bloom about his questionable past and even more questionable methods. Rounding out the group are cocksure DC José Rodriguez (Elyes Gabel, Casualty) and IT expert Tessa Stein (Holly Aird, Waking the Dead).\n\nThe cases reveal the many reasons for adopting a new persona, from simple greed to far more sinister motives.

Together with a forward-thinking pathologist (Gemini® winner Hélène Joy, Durham County), he applies revolutionary criminology techniques to crack the toughest cases. This season finds Murdoch making the acquaintance of H.G. Wells, teaming up a second time with Nikola Tesla, investigating art forgery, and using the fledgling science of psychology to out the era’s most elusive murderers.\n\nThe series co-stars Thomas Craig (Where the Heart Is) and Jonny Harris (Hatching, Matching & Dispatching) with guest stars including Patrick McKenna (The Red Green Show), Lisa Faulkner (Murder in Suburbia), Ashley Leggat (Life with Derek), Sarah Gadon (Being Erica, Happy Town), Dmitry Chepovetsky (ReGenesis), and Peter Keleghan (The Newsroom).\n\nSeason 3 debuted in Canada on CityTV in February 2010 and a fourth season has already been produced.

This takes him from the shadowy streets and back alleys of the big city to those quaint little villages where the citizens are close-knit, tight-lipped, and suspicious of outsiders.\n\nTwo examples of the latter are \"Shadow Falls\" and \"The Little House in the Forest\", both of which use the dreary Welsh countryside to add an element of gloom to the stories. \"Shadow Falls\" first aired in 1998, a full three years before the next installment in the series, and at this point the show still has the feel of a Detective Book Club selection that one might curl up with on a stormy night. The story of two suspicious suicides that take place ten years apart and the three couples who share a terrible secret regarding the victims is interesting though not altogether engaging. But it's a good start and things get better from here.\n\n\"Shadow Falls\" introduces us newbies to Bain's personality and methods. A veteran who's seen it all, he's quietly unflappable and a bit curmudgeonly, a genial cynic with a wry sense of humor and a faintly-flickering spark of faith in humanity. Refreshingly, Bain is neither a supercop, a renegade loner cop, nor an eccentric genius with the near-supernatural deductive skills of a Sherlock Holmes--he's simply a world-weary detective using his sharp mind, finely-honed instincts, and years of experience in the dogged pursuit of criminals.\n\nTwo other important characters make an appearance here. The first is Sharon Morgan as the serenely cheerful Professor Margaret Edwards, master medical examiner and nominal love interest for Bain (their relationship is kept enticingly enigmatic until the final episode). The second is Bain's independent-minded teenage daughter Hannah (Ffion Wilkins), who trades good-natured barbs with her dad but admires him enough to want to follow in his footsteps. In this episode we see her begin to give unsolicited aid in Bain's investigation by questioning suspects on her own; in subsequent stories, she's a newly-graduated rookie cop assigned to her father's department.\n\n\"Box\" (2001) is the bizarre urban tale of a serial killer haunted by a childhood of abuse and a severe identity crisis, whose motives for murder are almost pathetic enough to garner sympathy. It marks a transition between the somewhat rough-hewn qualities of \"Shadow Falls\" and the later episodes that gradually become more finely-rendered and intriguing, in terms of both story and production elements.\n\nThe first really fine episode, \"The Little House in the Woods\", keeps us guessing as to the identity of a young girl's killer, focusing also on the devastation of the victim's parents and how the lust for revenge results in even more violence and death. The discovery of a convicted child-murderer living in the woods near the victim's house after being released from prison complicates things even further. (William Thomas gives a fine performance as the enigmatic Beckwith, as do most of the supporting and guest players throughout the series.)\n\nOn the home front, Bain's relationships with the women in his life provide some drama as he plans to house-share with Margaret (teaching her how to tango leads to some coyly understated romantic overtures) and tries to help an insecure Detective Sergeant Leila Hamoudi (the slightly butch-looking but gorgeous Sara McGaughey) through her first case as lead investigator without stepping on her toes. Hannah, meanwhile, learns not to jump to conclusions after overhearing part of a heated locker room exchange between Sgt. Tom Swann (Ieuan Rhys), whom she considers a \"sexist bastard\", and another officer.\n\nThe show just keeps getting better with \"Soundbites\", in which an aspiring local policitian and popular talk radio host who advocates vigilante justice (Phil Reid) is torn when his own troubled son is accused of arson and attempted manslaughter. This darkly moody story is beautifully directed and shot and is technically and visually the best of the lot so far, with a sinewy musical score and strong guest performances. \"Colour Blind\", a twisted tale of racist skinheads vs. Pakistanis and the hit-and-run murder of a young student named Kasim, is another winner.\n\nIn \"The Inner Life of Strangers\", a pop star suddenly trades the spotlight for the quiet life in a remote village but is hounded by a homicidal stalker who starts offing her friends and working his way to her. \"Engineer\" is another revenge tale in which a surgeon whose carelessness puts a young girl into a coma finds his own daughter kidnapped by the girl's father. The final episode, \"Blood and Water\", ends the series in grand style as the brutal murder of a young woman in an alley leads to one man's agonizing conflict over whether or not to help his estranged brother beat the rap, while grappling with his own morbid obsessions and crippling guilt over a past deed.\n\nSharply directed with a natural, non-melodramatic style, A MIND TO KILL eschews sensationalism, flashy camerawork and editing, and pulse-pounding music in favor of a somber, mature style that's absorbing and consistently rewarding. As Bain, star Philip Madoc (DR. JEKYLL & SISTER HYDE, JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN) is interesting to watch because of his restraint, refusing to imbue the character with the standard kit of theatrical eccentricities or bursts of show-stopping histrionics. This is true of the rest of the cast as well, all of whom are consistently fine and help give the show its air of realism. An interesting side note is that each episode was shot twice, both in English and Welsh (the Welsh title is \"Yr Heliwr\").\n\nThe DVD set from Acorn Media is in 16:9 widescreen with Dolby Digital stereo sound and English subtitles. A text-based extra on disc one features three of \"The Women of 'A Mind to Kill'\"', with comments from Sharon Morgan, Ffion Wilkins, and Gillian Elisa (who appeared in some earlier episodes as \"DS Alison Griffiths\").\n\nAs I've mentioned before, I liken British cop shows such as this to Detective Club mystery novels, those leisurely-paced, atmospheric tales with great characters and absorbing plots that make for a good, slow read. If you don't have the patience or attention span for that brand of entertainment, then A MIND TO KILL: SERIES 3 will probably have you snoozing within the first five minutes. Otherwise, settle in and enjoy this above-average collection of bleak mystery tales.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nA MIND TO KILL: SERIES 3 -- DVD review by porfle\n\nSecret Key Motion Pictures brings us another nostalgic festival of 50s smut-filled sexploitation with their 2-disc set, SKIN IN THE FIFTIES. Loaded with old 8mm nudie loops along with the 1956 roadhouse feature THE FLESH MERCHANT, this titillating time-capsule is more fun than you can shake a stick at. Or whatever you happen to be holding at the moment.\n\nTHE FLESH MERCHANT begins as Paula Sheridan (Lisa Rack) gets a surprise visit from her kid sister, Nancy (the perky, voluptuous Joy Reynolds). Eager to escape her small-town existence and jealous of her big sister's success as a Hollywood \"model\", Nancy has come to the big city to get in on the action herself. Despite Paula's insistence that she turn around and go back home, the naive Nancy applies for a modeling job and quickly ends up as a prostitute servicing rich clientele at a swank hideaway called \"The Colony.\" This joint is run by a violent scumbag named Vito Perini (Marko Perri) who slaps his employees around whenever they don't \"cooperate\"--which proves a painful lesson for Nancy after she initially rejects a wealthy customer's amourous advances.\n\nNancy's roommate is an over-the-hill veteran named Easy (Geri Moffatt) who is getting fed up with her life of sexual servitude. After blowing up at a customer one night, she's dealt with by a vicious Perini, who savagely beats her up and banishes the aging party girl to a cheap brothel on skid row. With Easy gone, Nancy gets a surprising new roommate--her sister, Paula. When Paula sees the sorry state her kid sister has ended up in, she rebels against Perini and the rest of the flesh merchants at the risk of her own life.\n\nTHE FLESH MERCHANT is an hour-long parade of softcore 50s-style titillation that's surprisingly entertaining. The story zips along briskly, rarely slowing down even when clips from various nudie loops are spliced in here and there to naked things up a bit. In fact, about halfway through this story I realized I was really getting into it.\n\nThis is especially true during the scene where Easy is called into Perini's office--as she desperately begs the heartless creep not to kick her down the ladder to skid row, only to be beaten within an inch of her life, the movie has suddenly become surprisingly effective. And when Paula lashes out at her bosses and the clients themselves for being a bunch of sick perverts, Lisa Rack's intensely dramatic performance during this well-written scene is riveting. This may be the first time I've sat down to laugh my way through a cheap, campy old sex flick and watched it morph into a relatively good movie before my eyes.\n\nTechnically, it's just below the level of a really low-budget 50s TV episode, with performances that range from adequate to fine. The nudie-loop inserts (the full versions of which are available as disc-one bonus features) are pretty well incorporated into the movie proper, though their film quality is markedly inferior. The print used for this DVD isn't in the best shape, but to me that adds to its grindhouse appeal. Unfortunately the original opening and closing titles appear to have been lost.\n\nMoving on to disc two, we get a selection of nineteen short nudie films from the era. These bring back old memories of my younger days when I ordered some of these things from the back of adult magazines before home video made 8mm obsolete. Even the discs in this set are made to resemble 8mm movie reels, and a booklet insert, which includes a history of 50s sexploitation films along with a vintage Joy Reynolds pictorial, has the look of an old nudie digest.\n\nMost of these loops look pretty ancient, some seemingly pre-dating the '50s a bit. There's full nudity, except for the \"forbidden zone\", of course. Some of the girls are pretty cute, while others are, well, frightening. Several shorts have rudimentary storylines, which tend to be downright nutty--in fact, \"African Frenzy\" is one of the most accidentally avant-garde films I've ever seen, and \"Cocktails and Cuties\" is so wacky it's hard to believe real people actually made it.\n\nOne nice-looking brunette does something called the \"Danse de L'Ebandan\" in which she slinks into a seedy bar and proceeds to freak out for three-and-a-half minutes as her clothes fall off. The rest of the performers seem to be second-rate burlesque dancers, some resembling a few of my grade school teachers. One pleasant surprise, however, was the appearance of an adorable young Jennie Lee in \"Diamond Lil.\" Her segment is about as captivatingly sexy as one of these 50s loops can get, ending with Jenny performing her famous \"tassle trick.\" At that moment, I was officially enjoying myself. And when another statuesque beauty resembling Blaze Starr showed up to do her routine to the sultry strains of \"Harlem Nocturne\", I think my TV started to smoke. Or maybe that was just me.\n\nI didn't live during the heyday of these films, but mail-order warehouses everywhere were still clearing out their stock of this stuff well into the 80s. And now that it's on DVD, I don't have to crank up my old projector to see it. If you're still nostalgic for those times, or you just want to check out what they were all about, SKIN IN THE FIFTIES should be a welcome addition to your collection.\n\nBuy it at Amazon.com\n\nSKIN IN THE FIFTIES -- DVD review by porfle\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment Unveils New Selection of Classic Films from MGM’s Limited Edition Collection\n\n19 New Classics Currently Available From Online Retailers\n\nLOS ANGELES (April 14, 2011) – Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment is bringing even more classics to DVD in April through its unique “manufacturing on demand” (“MOD”).

After enlisting the help of their friend Rocco (David Della Rocco, The Boondock Saints: All Saints Day), the brothers set out to hunt down every mobster and vicious criminal with unusual flair and dramatic style: by praying for each victim before the ensuing bloodbath. The Russian mob hires a hitman, the infamous ‘Il Duce’ (Billy Connolly, X-Files, I Want to Believe), to avenge the deaths of their comrades.
