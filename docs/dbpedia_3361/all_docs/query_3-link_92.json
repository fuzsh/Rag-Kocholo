        "text": "Horsepower\n\nFrom remotest Mongolia to the deserts of Arabia. From the Mustangs of Nevada to the Windsor Greys of Buckingham Palace. From chariots to cowboys, armoured knights to mounted police to horse whisperers, actor and horse lover Martin Clunes travels the world to unlock the secrets of a partnership which shaped the world.\n\nThe first programme in the two part series explores why the horse evolved to be the way it is, and why it was possible to connect with it and turn it to our advantage.\n\nIslands of Britain\n\nMartin Clunes embarks on an epic journey to search for island paradise and travels from the most northern tip of Britain to the southerly seas to visit some of the 1000 or so islands off our shores.\n\nIn the three-part series the actor explores hidden Britain  the stunning, wild, curious and culturally diverse islands around our coast, and listens to the fascinating stories of what life is like away from the mainland from the people who live there.\n\nStarting on Muckle Flugga then travelling south to Forvik, Unst, Eigg and Barra in Scotland before ending on the Isles of Scilly off the south west coast near Landsend.\n\nReggie Perrin\n\nI've watched this with an open mind as a fan of the original (and of Martin Clunes) and tried to appreciate it on it's own merits - I find it to be a good series, but doubt it will ever be as iconic as the original.\n\nThe new show is another interpretation of the original book (not he TV series, but the book the original was based upon) - forget Leonard Rossiter etc. as it isn't attempting to recreate that at all - it's not even set at Sunshine Desserts, but at GroomTech.\n\nThe Man Who Lost His Head\n\nA British museum curator goes to New Zealand to explain to the locals why they can't have a sacred carved head returned to their village, but it doesn't go as planned.\n\nIan Bennett works with the British Museum but is finding his passion for the past is being overtaken by the marketing savvy of his younger colleagues.\n\nWhen a Maori carved head is put forward for exhibition it comes to the attention of a small community in the northern part of the country. Led by Zac, they make a claim to repatriate the mask and so Ian is sent over to help sort it all out but under no circumstances let their claim be valid. Ian gets there and is immediately treated with suspicion and dislike  but can both Ian and the community find more than they first assume?\n\nBeauty\n\nThis is the second in a trilogy of comedy dramas (with Von Trapped and King of Fridges) based on the theme of being trapped.\n\nThe setting of this film is superb and believable, and furthermore the casting was excellent.\n\nMartin Clunes perfectly plays a stuck-up Englishman clinging to the ways of the past in his run down stately home, hiding from a world he believes is not ready to accept his appearance.\n\nThe film challenges issues we create for ourselves, and the assumptions we make about other people's beliefs and acceptance levels.\n\nIf you want to watch a heartwarming tale which is beautifully shot and acted, this is one to choose. Its short, but packs in everything it needs to in the time. Its funny, but poignant, and subtle.\n\nDoc Martin - Series 1 : 6 episodes - 50 minutes each.\n\nMartin Clunes plays (fictional) Portwenn's local GP, Martin Ellingham, who was once a successful London surgeon until he developed a phobia of blood that prevented him conducting operations. After retraining as a GP, he applied for a post in the sleepy Cornish hamlet of Portwenn, where he spent childhood holidays.\n\nMuch of the show's humour revolves around Ellingham's interaction with the local Cornish villagers. Despite his surgical brilliance, Ellingham lacks vital personal skills and any semblance of a bedside manner, and often fails to understand other people. Dr Ellingham (referred to as \"Doc Martin\" by the friendly locals), much to his disgust, finds the surgery is in disarray. The medical equipment is beyond repair, and the patients records are a mess. To top it all he inherits the worlds most incompetent receptionist, Elaine Denham, who clearly resents Doc Martin moving in.\n\nDisk 1\n\n1 - Going Bodmin\n\n2 - Gentlemen Prefer\n\n3 - Shit Happens\n\nDisk 2\n\n4 - The Port Wenn Effect\n\n5 - Of All The Harbours In All The Towns\n\n6 - Haemophobia\n\n7 - Extras\n\nDoc Martin - On The Edge :\n\nFeature-length Christmas special.\n\nThe tranquility of Portwenn is disturbed when a group of birdwatchers descends on the village in search of a rare bird.\n\nPauline announces that she wants to go to university, so Martin has to start looking for another receptionist.\n\nLouisa's father Terry arrives unannounced in Portwenn - could this have an effect on the relationship between Martin and Louisa?\n\nPicture quality 7/10\n\nLosing It\n\nPhil MacNaughton is 43-year old copy-writer in advertising. Because he's a hypochondriac neither he nor his wife take it seriously when he feels a lump in his groin, but after a referral by his GP the specialist diagnoses a tumor and amputates one testicle.\n\nHowever it spread, so an intensive radiation therapy is unavoidable. Meanwhile he tries to live as normal as possible, but slowly the pressure mounts both on the home front (wife, teenage daughter and small son Todd) and at work, where he fears his boss will replace him by younger talent.\n\nWilliam & Mary : Series 1, 2 & 3.\n\n\"The lives of William (an undertaker) and Mary (a midwife) cross. They become romantically involved, but what happens for the rest of the series is far less predictable\".\n\nThis is a brilliant series, certainly not a comedy as some might think, there are many heart rendering moments. William (Martin Clunes) is an undertaker by default and Mary (Julie Graham) is a midwife so you can imagine death is around them but there is also so much joy. What a premise to a series, one partner brings new life in to the world and the other gently takes it away.\n\nThe writer and directors from the very first episode have built a tight and wonderful story based on the characters rather than the plot. Each character and there are many in each episode are acted perfectly. There are many twists and funny/sad moments throughout.\n\nDirty Tricks\n\nDirty Tricks stars Martin Clunes, who plays an English tutor at an Oxford language school. Although Edward can be charming and thoughtful, this camouflages an underlying calculating liar and manipulator. And although things are going great financially for Edward at the moment, he is under suspicion by a local CID inspector after a couple of murders in the area. An innocent dinner invitation by his friend and his wife triggers a series of events which lead our hero Edward down a very precarious path.\n\nTriva\n\nEdward states that he learned French so that he could read \"Thérèse Racquin\" in the original language. \"Thérèse Racquin\" is about an adulterous couple who dispose of the woman's husband so that they may be together, a close parallel to the story of \"Dirty Tricks.\"\n\nCan supply this with or without Dutch subtitles. By default it will be without.\n\nLegend Of The Cloutie [film] : Doc Martin\n\nDoctor Bamford has had enough of village life and is desperate for some distance from inquisitive Cornish neighbours.\n\nWhen the local estate agent shows him Tregunnt Farm, derelict and miles from anywhere, it's love at first sight.\n\nHowever, the Bowden family from London also have their eye on the property with a view to developing it into holiday cottages.\n\nAfter being gazumped, the Doc decides to spook the family in the hope they'll leave, by pretending to be the Beast of Bodmin.\n\nThis is the third film about the character who was first seen in Saving Grace (Dr Martin Bamford), and not the same character in the TV series of Doc Martin (Dr Ellingham), but there is a connection....\n\nSeries A Is For Acid : Unreleased (2018)\n\nDramatisation of the true story of the notorious \"acid bath murderer\" John Haigh, who murdered women and disposed of their bodies in vats of acid in the 1940's.\n\nHe was only caught when the gallstones of one of his victims, Mrs Durand-Deacon, failed to dissolve in the acid and were detected by the pathologist who examined the residue from the acid bath.\n\nSaving Grace : Doc Martin\n\nThis is the initial film in which Martin Clunes plays Doc Martin (in this film he's Dr Martin Bamford, and not Dr Martin Ellingham as in the TV series 'Doc Martin').\n\nIt's a bit confusing, but if you like Doc Martin, you'll see the beginnings of the series here and in the two films 'Doc Martin' and 'The Legend of the Cloutie'.\n\nMen Down Under\n\nDocumentary. The boys travel across Australia experiencing the culture and landscape - usually ending up drunk.\n\nMartin Clunes and Neil Morrissey, the stars of Men Behaving Badly, go in search of the reality behind the dubious myth that is the archetypal Australian male.\n\nIn their travels they meet a multitude of genuine Aussie blokes, such as Noel Fullerton, Australia's leading camal breeder, and Queensland's Graham 'Dave' Davidson, proprieter of the Gregory Hotel which boasts Australia's only tooth-picking cockatoo.\n\nAussie celebrities are part of their research too and include that all-round ocker John 'Singo' Singleton, ex porn star Rick Worth and even former State Premier, Jeff Kennett.\n\nTogether they traverse the great expanse of Australia, combining curiosity and wit, unmasking the unique intriguing and sometimes bizarre lifestyles of the men who have shaped the image of the Australian male.\n\nThis is episode 1 and 2 only. Episode 3 - WANTED\n\nHunting Venus : Unreleased (2011)\n\nFormer pop-star turned con artist Simon Delancey is kidnapped by two fans of his eighties band the - Venus Hunters, and are blackmailed to re-form the band for one final show.\n\nThe show is stolen by Neil Morrissey's performance as Charlie/Charlotte, but the rest of the Hunters (and the rest of the cast; Jane Horrocks' versatility shines through yet again, with the whole idea of her being a lesbian landlady in a seaside resort b&b verging on the ridiculous) add in some vital and amazingly funny elements.\n\nSoundtrack\n\n1.

Starburst [ screengrabs ].\n\nShakespear In Love\n\nRomantic comedy set in London in the late 16th century: Young playwright William Shakespeare struggles with his latest work \"Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter\" (So, that's where Python got the idea).\n\nThe story is.... A great fan of Shakespeare's plays is young, wealthy Viola who is about to be married to the cold-hearted Lord Wessex, but constantly dreams of becoming an actress (she dresses as a boy - cropped hair [not called \"Bob\" a la Blackadder]).\n\nWomen were not allowed to act on stage at the time, so female roles were played by men too, but dressed up as a boy, Viola successfully auditions for the part of Romeo. Soon she and William are caught in a forbidden romance that provides rich inspiration for his play.\n\nThis is a superb film but Martin Clunes has a tiny part - 5 minutes max. Superb film though.\n\nSex & Death\n\nFilm / Drama. About a British Shock-TV Show with Martin as the host.\n\n\"Ben Black is the host of a popular television program that aims to shock and outrage its audience, which continues to tune in even though most of them think they are 'above it.\"\n\nBut Ben's (Clunes) cruel persona as TV host often continues after the cameras are turned off and his ex-lover / current producer, his co-workers, and his lover are often at the receiving end of his barbs.\n\nIts what might happen behind the scenes of the Big Brother false set up. wink wink\n\nChristmas Special 1998 : 3 episodes : 45 mins each.\n\nPerformance\n\nGary and Dorothy are determined to try for a baby; however Gary has a slight impotence problem so collects a heavy collection of pornography to solve the issue.\n\nGary in Love\n\nGary attends a conference in Worthing, and Dorothy, Deborah and Tony tag along for the trip; Tony and Gary make the local headlines by stealing a large ornamental fish, and Gary falls in love - and not with Dorothy.\n\nDelivery\n\nIn the final episode, Tony takes up his new job as a postman; however Deborah believes he's become boring as a result. Meanwhile Gary gets heavily drunk to break the news to George and Anthea the office is closing down; and Dorothy goes into labour, but with a drunken Gary and Tony (whos now back to his old ways) and an unconscious midwife."
