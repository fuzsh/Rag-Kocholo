        "text": "Drama serial Demob scored highly on the period detail in this tale of a pair of demobbed soldiers, Captain Ian Deasey and Lance Corporal Dick Dobson, who try to find success on the stage as a double act after the end of world war II. Deasey begins an affair with the glamorous Hedda whom he meets when the duo begin working at the The Blue Parrot nightclub (obviously a nod to the real life Windmill club with riqsue nude dancers), and almost ruins his marriage in the process. The pair also tangle with seedy con man Rudy Lorimer.\n\nDemob was very much influenced by actual events that saw comics such as Tony Hancock, Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers and the like making a name for themselves on both the stage and radio. They all had begun their careers entertaining the troops during the hostilities. This was also the last television appearance of the brilliant Les Dawson who sadly died during the making of it.\n\nMartin Clunes and Samantha Janus.\n\nproduction details\n\nUK / ITV – Carlton – Yorkshire – Talk Back / 6×60 minute episodes / Broadcast 15 October – 19 November 1993\n\nWriters: Andrew Montgomery, Dean Lemmon / Producer: Adrian Bate / Executive Producers: David Reynolds, Peter Fincham / Director: Robert Knights"
