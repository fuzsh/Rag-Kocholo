        "text": "Collier Memorial State Park is a beautiful spot a half hour north of Klamath Falls, near the town of Chiloquin. The park has several nice trails on horse-friendly terrain, plus views of the area's impressive springs and rivers.\n\nThe park’s horse camp is located on the west side of Hwy. 97. It has 4 corrals, potable water, a hitching rail, and a picnic table. There’s no toilet in the horse camp, but you’ll find one a short distance away in the family day-use area.\n\nThe Collier-Kimball Trail follows dirt roads past ponderosa pine forest and pretty meadows to Jackson F. Kimball State Park.\n\nThe Wood River originates at Kimball State Park, where a huge spring flows out of the hillside and creates a full-sized river within just a few hundred yards. It’s impressive.\n\nOr, you can ride to the headwaters of Spring Creek which grows to a full-size river in a couple hundred yards.\n\nIf you cross Hwy. 97, you can ride the trails on the east side of the park, connect to forest roads, and ride up onto the rimrock to enjoy the views.\n\nThis summer, be sure to plan a trip to Collier State Park. You’ll enjoy the fine riding in this beautiful area!\n\nLearn More\n\nCollier Memorial State Park is covered in Riding Southern Oregon Horse Trails by Kim McCarrel, available at www.NWHorseTrails.com."
