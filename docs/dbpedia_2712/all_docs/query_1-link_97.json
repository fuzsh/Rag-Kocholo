        "text": "Logging's heyday, from the 1860s through the 1920s, is on display in one of Oregon's most unusual stops: the Collier Logging Museum in woodsy Collier Memorial State Park in Klamath County.\n\nNestled at the confluence of Spring Creek and the Williamson River, the open-air collection of logging equipment is nothing short of mind-boggling. More than 70 pieces of heavy equipment, some that look like they come from a medieval torture chamber, are scattered around the scenic grounds.\n\nThe museum dates to 1947 when brothers Alfred and Andrew Collier of Klamath Falls donated 146 acres and a collection of antique logging equipment to the state.\n\nDisplays show the evolution of logging, from donkey engines to yarders and gang saws. Signs help visitors weave their way past displays, including a slice of the largest Douglas fir ever cut in Oregon. Columbus hadn't set sail from Spain when this tree was a youngster. In the summer through Labor Day, movies about old-time logging and other topics are shown at 9 p.m. every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nMore info: Thirty miles north of Klamath Falls, on the west side of U.S. 97. Open dawn-dusk daily; admission free. 541-783-2471, www.oregonstateparks.org/park_228.php."
