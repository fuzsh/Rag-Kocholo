        "text": "4. Collier State Park / Spring Creek Rest Area\n\nLocation:\n\nHighway 97, near mile marker 244; 35 miles north of Klamath Falls, Oregon\n\nHabitat:\n\nPonderosa Pine forest. The Williamson River and crystal-clear Spring Creek converge in the park. The Williamson River is famous for its quality trout fishing. Ice cold and crystal clear, Spring Creek gushes dramatically out of a nearby spring, and then paints a picture-perfect scene as it flows through the park.\n\nDistinct Features:\n\nCollier Memorial State Park features a campground; outdoor museum of historic logging equipment; relocated pioneer village; and a new four-corral, primitive horse camp and trailhead. At the state's finest logging museum, you'll see rare and antique logging equipment dating to the 1880s, as well as more recent pieces. From the equestrian trailhead, you can ride north from the park across national forest land to the Jackson F. Kimball State Park (KBBT Site Number 6).\n\nBirds to Look For:\n\nSpotted Sandpiper, Hairy, Black-backed and White-headed Woodpeckers, Dusky Flycatcher, Gray Jay, Clark's Nutcracker, three nuthatch species, American Dipper, Western Tanager, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, many warbler species (especially during spring migration), Steller's Jay, Great Blue Heron, seasonal waterfowl (Common and Hooded Mergansers, Common and Barrow's goldeneyes and Bufflehead), and Bald Eagle. Members of the Audubon Society, who recently visited the park, reported excellent birding at this site.\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom Klamath Falls travel north on Highway 97 for 31 miles. Collier State Park and the Spring Creeks Rest area are on both sides of the Highway The park is 105 miles south of the town of Bend, Oregon; travel time is approximately 2 hours 20 minutes. GPS: 121° 52' 57.45\" W, 42° 38' 28.34\" N.\n\nFor more information Contact:\n\nCollier Memorial State Park\n\n46000 Highway 97 N\n\nChiloquin, OR 97624\n\n(541) 783-2471\n\nWeb info:\n\nwww.oregonstateparks.org\n\nNavigation:\n\nYou are here: Home > Birding Sites > Trail Map > 4.
