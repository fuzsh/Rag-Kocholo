        "text": "September 23, 2022 - reviewed by William Yoder\n\n$36\n\nGreat Spot\n\nGreat spot unfortunately a fire came through and took most of the trees. Very clean full hookups well maintained Here September 23rd 2022 Great place for us to stop for the night.\n\nJuly 13, 2019 - reviewed by LongRider\n\n$19\n\nCity Dwellers Will Like\n\nThe amenities are good. Nearby two beautiful rivers. Nice camping spots. Having said that i won't be back. The spots are too close. I'm in bed gagging on my neighbor's camp fire smoke and skunk weed. If you like being packed in like sardines, you will like this place. If you like camping go elsewhere. Oh, one last thing. The echoing sounds of the busy highway says, tranquility is unwelcome.\n\nJuly 27, 2018 - reviewed by John K\n\nVery nice shady camp ground. Sites are well spaced. Close to Crater Lake.\n\nDecember 3, 2017 - reviewed by RFB\n\nThings To Do\n\nThere are TWO interesting museums nearby. The logging museum has lots of turn of the century logging equipment, a lot of it steam powered. Live demonstrations during the summer months. Two miles south is a railroad museum with more steam power, this time on rails. Bump on the mosquitos in spring and early summer.\n\nOctober 3, 2017 - reviewed by Cheryl\n\nClosed!\n\nIt is only October 3, not my definition of \"late October\" and the campground is closed. And don't go the 1 1/2 miles to the Forest Service Campground unless you have water. They turned off the water in that camp on Sept. 23, but the signage with that info is not until you get into the campground.\n\nJuly 26, 2017 - reviewed by Meredith\n\n$25\n\nGreat Little Campground\n\nWe pulled in without reservations. Found an open spot. Kids jumped out and quickly found other kids to ride around with. Small enough campground that it's not too hard to keep track of them. Great trails and walks to rivers. Spaces nicely laid out. Camp hosts were friendly. Had a thunderstorm come thru and knock out power. Electric was back on by 11am. Warm free showers and decently cleaned restrooms. Would have liked to stay longer but it was booked up.\n\nJuly 15, 2017 - reviewed by Stephanie\n\n$26\n\nNice Park\n\nFull hook up $26 - people are very friendly and helpful. Trails and museum. Lots of bugs! Makes sure to bring mosquito repellent- these guys are vicious. Level pads with rear parking. The only downside is the spots are pretty close together depending where you are.\n\nOctober 2, 2016 - reviewed by Bruce\n\nNice quiet camp. Spacious.\n\nAugust 13, 2016 - reviewed by Michael\n\nLove it love it going back soon\n\nMay 28, 2016 - reviewed by Willow\n\nRates 2016\n\nFull Hookup $26 Horse facilities $19 Tent site $19\n\nOctober 9, 2015 - reviewed by Helen\n\nGreat park. Spacious sites with full hookups. Nice camp host."
