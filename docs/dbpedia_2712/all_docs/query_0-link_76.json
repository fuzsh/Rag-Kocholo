Located in Oregon’s high desert, Klamath Falls boasts 300 days of sunshine a year. The city is nestled on the shores of Upper Klamath Lake, and in the backdrop of the Cascade Mountain Range. Mt. Shasta, Mt. Mcloughlin and a number of other peaks stand in contrast to the surrounding mountains. Klamath Falls is an outdoor enthusiasts’ paradise, with hiking and mountain biking and gravel biking trails, kayaking, paddle boarding, rock climbing and much more. Temperatures can range from the mid-60’s during the day, down to the mid-30’s in the evenings.\n\nThe Feast will be held in the ballroom at the beautiful Running Y Resort, a 3600-acre property just 15 minutes outside of Klamath Falls. The Resort offers an Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course (the only one in Oregon) a spa and wellness center, outdoor basketball and pickleball courts, an indoor swimming pool, wading pool and hot tub. There are also outdoor tennis courts, horseshoe pits, cornhole, a sand volleyball court, a cardio and weight room with available fitness classes, a dry sauna, playground, horseback riding and hiking and biking trails.\n\nMusic: The music coordinator is Ralph Redline (ralphredline@gmail.com) and the choir director is Andy McClain (acmcclain@sbcglobal.net).\n\nDining: There is only one restaurant on site. There are a number of other dining options located in Klamath Falls, 15 minutes away.\n\nHousing: Housing prices for the Running Y Resort will be posted early April. There will be phone reservations or an online booking link. Besides the discounted rates listed on the housing tab, there are many options on site through VRBO or Airbnb to consider.\n\nActivities: Crater Lake National Park is a little over an hour away, which offers spectacular views, hiking trails, boat tours and opportunities for photography and wildlife viewing. Klamath Falls is known for its excellent fishing opportunities, with both river and lake fishing opportunities available. Upper Klamath Lake and nearby rivers provide numerous opportunities for boating, kayaking and canoeing. The Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Visitors Center is 45 minutes away. There are also a number of museums within an hour’s drive: Favell Museum, Klamath County Museum, Baldwin Hotel Museum, Fort Klamath Museum, Train Mountain Railroad Museum and the Collier Memorial State Park and Logging Museum.\n\nWe will also have numerous opportunities for teen, singles, young adult and family activities during the Feast of Tabernacles.\n\nTravel: For those flying, most airlines service Medford (MFR) (a 1.5 hour drive from the Feast site), Eugene (EUG) (a three-hour drive), or Redmond (RDM) (approximately three hours’ drive). For those coming into Portland (PDX) it is a 4.5-hour drive."
