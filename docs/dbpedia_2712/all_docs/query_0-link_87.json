Either art studio provides a way for you and your family to get creative and thrive.\n\nBurn Energy at a Nearby Park\n\nA great way to burn some energy for kids is at one of the many Klamath Falls parks. Eulalona Nature Play Area, Moore Park, Wiard Park, or Steen Sports Park are all fantastic places for kids and those young at heart.\n\nThe Eulalona Nature Play Area is one of the newest playgrounds to Klamath Falls, and is located within the Pacific Terrace neighborhood, just off Crater Lake Parkway. The play structures are made from natural elements, such as timber and natural ropes, and offer many ways that kids can interact with the landscape on slides, balance beams, a zip line, and every parent’s favorite – a sandbox.\n\nMoore Park is the largest park in the community, with two playgrounds, a marina, large open fields, a disc golf course, tennis, picnic areas, and a trail system. The playground on the upper side of the park, near the tennis courts features play structures for both 5-12 year olds and 2-4 year olds. If you’re into cycling at all, pack the bikes and check out the Moore Park Bike Skills Park, which opened in 2021.\n\nWiard Park System features several neighborhood parks in the south suburbs of Klamath Falls, with the main park located along the OC&E Trail off Wiard Street.

Steen can be a great place to fly a kite, with large, wide-open fields.\n\nCheck out a family-friendly trail\n\nKlamath Falls and the surrounding offers an abundance of trails. For those looking for a shorter, easier trek that even the littlest can enjoy, consider one of the following footpaths:\n\nFit Trail at Steen Sports Park: This 3.15 mile cross-country trail may be a little long for littles, we still chose to include it here, for it’s ease of access. Additionally, while the whole family might not be able to do the entire trail, it offers a number of access points for those who may need to shorten the trek, with connections to the athletic fields and parking lots at Steen Sports Park. It also features outdoor fitness structures such as balance beams, pull up bars, and a variety of other challenges along the way.\n\nMoore Mountain Trail System: Klamath Trails Alliance and it’s volunteers have invested heavily in the trails in the area, and Moore Mountain is quickly becoming regionally known as an easy to get to location for those that enjoy trail running, hiking, and mountain biking. Check out the trail map to be sure you find something that meets your interest and skill level. (Side note: many fitness enthusiasts find that the proximity of these trails allows them to fit in a quick mountain bike ride or trail run during their lunch hour. Where else offers the opportunity to be away from it all and back to work within an hour?)\n\nGeo Trail: The Geo Trail, located within a half-mile of both Sky Lakes Medical Center and Oregon Tech campuses, and only a mile and half from Pacific Terrace neighborhood, is a quick 2-mile loop that even little kids can do. Be sure to take a minute when you reach the top to enjoy the views of Klamath Lake, Campus Drive, and the Mountains surrounding.\n\nStreet Fairs, Outdoor Events, and Parades\n\nWe’d be remiss not to include a few seasonal community favorites when sharing all the family-friendly fun Klamath has to offer.\n\nKlamath Falls Farmer’s Market occurs every Saturday from June to October, and features local agricultural producers, value-added food producers, and artisans. Enjoy the close-knit, community atmosphere. The Farmer’s Market typically features live music and a variety of activities in addition to the vendor booths.\n\nThird Thursdays in Downtown Klamath Falls run from June to August. Each third Thursday during the summer months, Main Street is closed to auto traffic and local vendors, entertainers, community groups, and businesses open up shop in the street for the community.\n\nKlamath Basin Oktoberfest aligns with the German tradition each September to celebrate the local harvest and regional brewers. It is a family-friendly event with live music, great foods, and fun for the whole family.\n\nSnowflake Festival is annual tradition, celebrating the winter season each December.
