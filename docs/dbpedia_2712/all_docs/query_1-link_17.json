        "text": "Found on highway 97 in southern Oregon, Collier Memorial State Park stands as a testament to the rich history of logging and timber in the region. Named after the Collier family from Klamath Falls, this park offers visitors an immersive experience into the world of logging and a glimpse into the lives of the pioneers who shaped the industry.\n\nHistory Of Collier Memorial State Park\n\nThe park's roots trace back to the generosity of brothers Andrew and Alfred Collier, who donated 146 acres of land in 1945 to the state as a tribute to their parents.\n\nThis initial gesture laid the foundation for what would eventually grow into a 536-acre expanse of natural beauty and historical significance. Today, managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Collier Memorial State Park welcomes over 350,000 visitors annually.\n\nThe Collier Logging Museum\n\nCollier Memorial State Park can be split into three parts: the campground, the rest area and day use area, and the logging museum. The rest area is a popular place to stop off and stretch your legs on a walk down to the spot where scenic Williamson River and Spring Creek meet, but most never go further than that, and end up paying no attention to the logging museum just across the road.\n\nThe Collier family's involvement in the logging business led them to amass an impressive collection of antique logging equipment. In 1947, they donated the first machines, setting the stage for what would become one of the largest collections of logging equipment in the country. The museum now boasts a diverse array of equipment spanning eight decades of logging history.\n\nVisitors are invited to embark on a journey through time with two main routes within the museum. The \"Cut, Move, Mill Trail\" serves as a gateway to the past, showcasing the methods and tools used by logging crews in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nStarting at the Cookhouse, where a gift shop and historic displays are, this trail offers insights into the laborious process of felling trees, transporting logs, and milling them into lumber.\n\nThe \"Logging Evolution Trail\" offers a chronological exploration of logging machine technology from the 1860s to modern times. It guides visitors through three distinct eras: horse and oxen, steam engines, and internal combustion engines. These periods reflect the evolution of both machinery and techniques that defined the logging industry's growth and transformation over the years.\n\nCollier Memorial State Park stands as a living tribute to the pioneering spirit of the Collier family and the generations of loggers who shaped the region's history. As you walk through the park's trails and immerse yourself in its exhibits, you'll gain a deep appreciation for the resilience and ingenuity that defined the logging industry. Whether you're a history enthusiast, nature lover, or simply curious about the past, a visit to Collier Memorial State Park promises an enriching experience that bridges the gap between the past and the present.\n\nCamping At Collier Memorial State Park\n\nSeasonal camping is available at the park between May 15th and September 30th each year. There are 46 full hookup sites and 18 non hookup sites with water nearby. A restroom with hot showers and flush toilets is available.\n\nThere are also two horse camp sites with corrals. You can book reservations up to six months in advance here.\n\nCampers should note that this campground is high in elevation, and that it gets cold at night, and can be cold in the daytime, even in the summer. Come prepared for cold and inclement weather.\n\nCollier Memorial State Park Information\n\nTo get to Collier Memorial State Park from Eugene: Take I-5 south to Highway 58.
