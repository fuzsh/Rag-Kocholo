        "text": "Canoeing\n\nLaunch your canoe, paddle quietly and keep your ears perked. You'll hear the subtle sounds of nature that are all too often drowned out by the noise of boat motors or car engines: the grebe's call, the hawk's piercing screech, or the crane's boisterous chortle.\n\nSuch are the rewards for the canoeist who paddles many of the flat-water trails in Klamath, Lake and Modoc Country, where wildlife flourishes in dozens of bogs, swamps, marshes and wetlands.\n\nRecognizing the enduring popularity of canoeing, several agencies in the Klamath Basin are developing new trails through areas rich in scenery and wildlife. Many have brochures printed on waterproof paper to guide you along the way.\n\nSnow-covered peaks loom over the waters of the Cascade Mountain range, while towering ponderosa pines form a canopy above streams and lakeshores in Klamath, Lake, Modoc and Siskiyou Country. Popular canoe trails include the Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge, where spring-fed streams weave their way through wetlands along the edge of the Winema National Forest. The Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge offers a trail near areas that support large populations of waterfowl and songbirds.\n\nFood and lodging are available near most canoe areas, and rentals are available at several resorts throughout the region.\n\nHere you'll find a list of the area's most popular canoe areas, including directions and telephone numbers for more information.
