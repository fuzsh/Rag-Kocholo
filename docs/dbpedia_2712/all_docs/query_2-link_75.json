        "text": "Another Oregon State Park Beauty\n\nWe stayed here for 5 nights just prior to Labor Day weekend. Like most of the Oregon State Parks I have visited, this is another gem. Reservable, clean, sites are well spaced apart, most with full hookups. Clean laundry facilities, camp hosts (3), firewood for $5 a bundle. Situated along the river with some sites on the water. Across the highway, via footbridge, is the Logging Museum, for history/sightseeing buffs. Lots of trails with river access. Most sites are level and all are paved. Some good sized pull throughs, but to get one, I would suggest reservations. They do have some first come, first served spots. Most spots are nestled among the pines. Pets allowed, with the usual restrictions. Rangers drove through the park at all times during the day. Restrooms and showers were kept clean and well stocked.\n\nOutdoor Museum\n\nCollier Memorial State Park provides an opportunity to camp among Oregonâ€™s beautiful Ponderous Pines, next to the crystal-clear waters of Spring Creek, where it flows into the famous fishing waters of the Williamson River. Plus you have the opportunity to visit the largest outdoor logging museum, perhaps in the world. All this is connected with a network of walking trails. Paved sites in an immaculately kept campground, laundry, & showers. Closed in winter.\n\nRate Paid:\n\n$22.00"
