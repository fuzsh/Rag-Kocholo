        "text": "“Another Gem in the Oregon State Park System!”\n\nCollier Memorial State Park\n\nWe simply loved it here and would have stayed longer if it hadn’t been all booked up over the weekend.\n\nWe loved the fact that the sites were somewhat spread out and it was so peaceful and quiet. Camp hosts were super nice and stayed busy raking and cleaning up around each site as campers came and went.\n\nWe really enjoyed the walking trail that led down to the creek, which was more like a small river this time of year. Following the path onward you can choose to cross over the creek on a cool footbridge to the Collier Memorial day use area or under Hwy 97 to the free outdoor logging museum just a short distance away. The museum was neat with displays of old logging equipment and cabins/buildings built and used in the old logging days. Definitely worth a stop if you are passing through the area.\n\nCell service was a bit weak but with our WeBoost booster turned on we were able to work and stream using Verizon. T-Mobile and AT&T were still a bit iffy even boosted.\n\nUnfortunately, the campground was completely booked the weekend following our stay, Memorial Day weekend, so we headed over to the Williamson River Campground just next door.\n\nWould We Stay Again?\n\nCollier Memorial State Park is on our list of top 5 campgrounds in Oregon and we loved our time spent here. We’ll be back next time we’re through the area without a doubt. We truly enjoyed our time at the Collier Memorial State Park and will definitely stay again when in the area.\n\nNightly Cost: $28\n\nDays Stayed: 5\n\nHookups: Full Hookups\n\nPets: Allowed\n\nWIFI: Our cell coverage was good in this park as well. Verizon was the strongest but AT&T and T-Mobile worked fine too. Our weBoost cell booster was on standby just in case the signal strength wasn’t strong enough but was not needed.\n\nThis is our review/opinions of our stay at Collier Memorial State Park, Oregon\n\nCollier Memorial State Park – Oregon GPS: 42.6467, -121.8792\n\nYou might also like:"
