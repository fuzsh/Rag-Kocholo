Start checking each one off your list and visit them all!\n\nAs a life long resident of Oregon, I know all too well that it is easy to take for granted all that our home state has to offer. If you live in Oregon, are thinking of moving to Oregon or are just planning a visit to our wonderful state, I hope that this list is helpful to you.\n\nHappy travels!\n\nAmie Krieger\n\nYour Oregon Real Estate Broker\n\nThank you for viewing! Oregon has many beautiful parks and recreation areas to enjoy!\n\nPlease keep in mind that some of these areas may not be maintained, have proper signage or could be underdeveloped. Visit these areas at your own risk. Everyone should follow all state and local laws. Do not trespass onto private property. Please pick up after yourself and treat these areas with respect. Thank you!\n\nI created this page because I couldn't find a list anywhere out there that had every state owned park and recreation area in Oregon. Some of these rec areas were pretty obscure and took some serious effort to find their location. This is as complete of a list as I believe is out there, but if you think I'm missing something or otherwise see any errors, please email me.\n\nFor a printable version of the list, click here.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ms. Miller at the Oregon Communications & Research Division for getting me the list of 257 parks and rec names."
