        "text": "So a year ago, I made this game called Cheesy, I wasnt really experienced with scripting then, and followed a bunch of youtube videos, scripted some “myself” hired some free developers from a roblox game and somehow got it somewhat “sucessful”. Ive moved on to a much stable, original game, but i decided I would like some quick “fame” like a used to experience from Cheesy. Got any ideas to revive it?\n\ngame: [NEW UPDATE] Cheesy - Roblox\n\nCreate ads for the game, have better art for icon and thumb nail.\n\nwhat would be a “better thumbnail”?\n\nMAKE IT KNOWN: do some ads to get some players again, and advertize your game in different places. for example: devforum cool creations, youtube, twitter, tiktok ect.\n\nCONCURRENT PLAYERS: daily/weekly/monthly rewards so people have more of a reason to come back, maybe leaderboards which will make people want to get to the top and it may keep them in your game longer. and also make sure to have some kind of reward system such as skins for doing various things.\n\nUPDATES: do small updates weekly and big updates monthly,\n\nWORKING GAME: listen to what your community wants, be open minded when you get suggestions\n\nCOMMUNITY: Develop a community whether that be a roblox group or a discord server.\n\nthats all I could think of\n\nAs a note, a game that easily dies is a game that lacks any kind of major replay-ability. Have not tried your game, but horror games almost automatically lack any reason to return unless a player brings a friend. Updates and ads are your friend, aim to gather feedback from players who do play your game.\n\nAlright, I’ve played the game and this is a trend game, therefore its much harder to revive.\n\nGL Though\n\nThey mean GFX Artwork, but unless you make some yourself you might have to pay someone to make some for you. I noticed that your thumbnails are in-game screenshots and usually people don’t use the Roblox engine since the lighting and rendering aren’t too good. You can also have the artwork for your game if you or someone else can draw.\n\nI don’t want to be harsh but from my understanding, this game was popular during the piggy era and there is nothing wrong with that it’s just that people want replayability and many of these trends just don’t have that much. For example story games, there is no incentive to play again due to the fact that you finish it and there is nothing else to do, and that goes along with why many people don’t purchase items from story games so there has to be an incentive to return and a sense of value that the player has to even consider to play the game again. Basically, I’m just saying that more likely than not it will be very challenging to get old players back on. What I see is a game that got a lot of visits and an opportunity to learn from it so see what people like and what they don’t like and see how to capture and keep their interest after the big surge starts to die down. If you haven’t fallen asleep by now I hope this may have helped you.\n\nIn terms of the game, I do have some improvement points that I hope can be useful.\n\nthis text part right here stays here all game it’s a bit annoying and I realized that the game has already surpassed the 125 like goal so I recommend removing it since it has already passed but for the future, you should make a little text box that can be closed so that people can read it and close it.\n\nThe lobby area is a bit big and I feel that it may get confusing to some players so I’d say to make it into the main lobby area with the credits off to the side and have the little mini obby in another room.\n\nI’ve realized this paradox (you probably have) where you need at least 2 people so many people who are in single-player lobbies have no choice but to leave or invite a friend so it might be complicated but maybe add a separate version which would be a single-player version.\n\nMany of the fonts on the UI look weird since they are different and they all give off a different atmosphere so I would maybe choose 1-2 fonts and stick with those.\n\nThere are too many maps to choose from; When I was playing I had to choose from about 9 different maps so what I am thinking is you have people choose from 3 maps and they will be alternating each round.\n\nPeace!"
