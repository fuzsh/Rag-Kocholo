        "text": "Intro\n\nThe game starts with John Creasman, working on his car with his radio on when an Emergency Broadcast airs, informing the players of the rapidly worsening situation. John has been working on his car for several days and realises that today might be his last day to escape. Although not mentioned in the game, according to Road of the Dead 2, it is implied that John stole an encrypted military transmitter the day prior which explains his ability to listen in on encrypted military chatter.\n\nThe military had locked down and quarantined the city in hopes of containing the zombie epidemic. No one is allowed to enter or exit the city. To enforce quarantine, the military had set up 9 checkpoints throughout the city highway with orders to shoot anyone on sight.\n\nEntering Highway 65\n\nJohn enters Highway 65, the fastest way out of the city, at the Evan City entrance. The zombies fortunately haven't made it too far into this area so there are relatively few zombies.\n\nCheckpoint 1: Monroeville\n\nThe military first encounters John at the Monroeville checkpoint. There are a small amount of soldiers at the checkpoint. Soldiers stationed at the checkpoint alert command. The military, fearing the driver of the car could be infected and may possibly spread the virus out of the city, warns the next checkpoint and sends troops to stop John. More soldiers will attack John as he moves through Monroeville to the second checkpoint.\n\nCheckpoint 2: Red Ridge\n\nThe second checkpoint feature more soldiers prepared to take on John. Highway Unit 12 is then activated sending even more troops that will also appear throughout Red Ridge and at the next checkpoint as zombie numbers increase and John approaches.\n\nCheckpoint 3: Burgony Street\n\nThe third checkpoint contains a high amount of soldiers to stop the car and the approaching zombies. Highway Unit 9 is sent to reinforce Burgony Street resulting a steady stream of soldiers throughout Burgony Street and a extremely high military presence at the next checkpoint. Spike Strips have been authorised to neutralise the motor vehicle by bursting the vehicle's tyres. The military also identifies John Creaseman as the driver of the car at this point by running his license plate.\n\nCheckpoint 4: Central City\n\nThe fourth checkpoint contains far more soldiers then the other checkpoints as the military makes John priority number 1. Highway Unit 7 is deployed to stop John, making using of moving spike strips to trick John and inflict more damage on his vehicle. Hellfire attack helicopters have also been deployed to stop John and can be force to land after hitting several street signs.\n\nCheckpoint 5: Down Town\n\nA heavily reinforced checkpoint with far more soldiers and obstacles to try and avoid. The bomb squad has been authorised to neutralise John's vehicle. Bomb operators will set up a line of bombs which will explode one at a time. Driving towards the origin of the line and closer to the already denonated will decrease the damage taken by John.\n\nCheckpoint 6: Chinatown\n\nBy the time John gets to Chinatown, the military operation in Evans City now changes command to General Sherman who immediately changes tactics throughout the city. Mutanted Zombies also appear in Chinatown. They are extremely dangerous and cannot be run over at any speed, simply grabbing onto your hood no matter how fast. They appear on the road and will position themselves to try to get in front of John's car. They require much collisions to knock off and do more damage to the windscreen. A bullet from a revolver will still instantly kill them.\n\nCheckpoint 7: Brighton Square\n\nThere is a great number of troops at the Brighton Square Checkpoint. Air strikes have been authorised on Highway 65 to wipe out zombie hordes and John's muscle car. They will fly over the highway, alerting the player. Shortly after they'll come back facing John, dropping bombs in a single line along the length of the highway. They should be avoided by going to the opposite side of the explosives as they can deal very high damage even to a fully armoured car.\n\nCheckpoint 8: North Side Park\n\nThere are a reduced amount of soldiers in North Side Park as the military pulls out of Evans City but there will still be some dedicated soldiers trying to stop Creasman. More Hellfire units have also been deployed and they have been authorised to use Air-to-ground missiles to neutralise the vehicle. They will use them once enough time has elasped since they appeared. Missiles, similar to other explosives, will deal heavy damage. However, they will broadcast their request over the radio, and the missile are quite slow, giving time to evade.\n\nCheckpoint 9: West Ridge\n\nAs the military prepares for their final pullout, there are barely any soldiers left on the Highway to stop Creasman. However, after receiving approval from the president, General Sherman has authorised a nuclear strike on the city. A few Hellfire Units and bomber jets will still try to stop John from escaping and mutants have been increasing in number.\n\nCheckpoint 10: Tunnel Drive\n\nWith the military in full retreat and the nuclear bomb about to hit, all military personnel on Highway 65 abandon the mission leaving the final stretch clear from military presence. Unfortunately, there is a much higher number of obstacles and zombies, including mutated variations.\n\nEpilogue\n\nWith the tunnel in sight, John escapes the city with seconds to spare. As John watches his home destroyed by the nuke, it is revealed through the radio that the nuclear option failed to eliminate all of the undead hordes and many return. With everything he has ever known destroyed and the military in chaos, John drives into the sunset."
