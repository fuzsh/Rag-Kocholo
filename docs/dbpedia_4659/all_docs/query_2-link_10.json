        "text": "#1 The Last of Us\n\n#2 Telltale's: The Walking Dead\n\n#3 Dead Island\n\n#4 Dying Light (I haven't finished either of, but I think 1 is better so far, no hate on 2 though.)\n\n#5 Dead Rising\n\n#6 DEAD SPACE\n\n#7 The Evil Within\n\n#8 Call of Duty: Zombies\n\n#9 MORE Left 4 Dead content.\n\n#10 EVIL DEAD (Technically a video game... sad excuse, I know...)\n\n#Bonus \"HALF LIFE\" at least I THINK it's a zombie game. There can't be more than 10 Polls, so if you think this ought to come in, feel free to comment. I don't know much about this game, but I do know it well from \"Garry's Mod.\" If there's any zombie games I missed, I think I got everything, but if I didn't, feel free to share your thoughts!\n\nTrigger Warning for some die-hard fans.\n\nThe Last of Us - A dramatic, heartwarming story about a fatherly bond between a survivor and a young girl, while on an important escort to find what she most seeks. A Playstation cult classic in the PS3-PS4 era. Makes you not want mushrooms on your pizza, cause then your paranoid thinking they'd make clicking noises...\n\nLast of Us for me as I donâ€™t have an attachment to the others except TWD - and while I enjoy the games (currently first playthrough) I think it should be show or comics as the main source.\n\nProbably because they is no monetary gain from it, I would assume\n\nThe Evil Within - Same as Poll 6, not technically a zombie game, but they still make me think \"ZOMBIES.\" Although, completely different from Dead Space. Basically if RE and Silent Hill had a beautiful child named \"The Evil Within\".\n\nStefano Valentini with Obscura would be a great killer. Stefano could use a shorter speed attack like Wesker, whilst unleashing Obscura could be quite terrifying, especially with it having a flash attack that could even slow survivors ridiculously.\n\nTo be honest, a few of these titles I'd be happy with, namely: Evil Within, The Walking Dead (TV series though), Dead Space, Left 4 Dead (chapter 2, since Biiiillll's here!) and The Evil Dead franchise."
