        "text": "DUKE NUKEM JOINS THE CREW - 40% off to celebrate!\n\nItâs the last 10 minutes of your favorite sci-fi TV showâ¦ except that this time things have gone seriously wrong and The Captain Is Dead!\n\nBased on the frantic and fun board game, this turn-based, survival/strategy puts YOU in the Captain's chair...\n\nYou must co-ordinate the crew to repair critical systems and fend off hostile aliens, or you'll share the captainâs fate. From the Chief Engineer, Weapons Officer, and visiting Admiral, all the way down to the Ensign and the shipâs Janitor, you must combine your unique talents to avoid utter annihilation in the cold depths of space!\n\nYOU HAVE THE CONN!\n\nStep into the Captain's chair and command the crew! Each team member has a very particular set of skills that you'll need to leverage to the full if you want to survive, including...\n\nADMIRAL - A master of plans and evasion.\n\nCYBORG - Immune to the mysterious forces of deep space.\n\nCREWMAN - Gets killed very easily... good thing there is an infinite supply!\n\nCOUNSELOR - Can manipulate skills for the best chance of success.\n\nENSIGN - A fast learner, and even faster runner.\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER - Can fix the ship real quick.\n\nSOLDIER - An expert at taking out aliens.\n\n...with more on the way!\n\nRESISTANCE IS FUTILE!\n\nDefend the ship against an unknown alien nemesis that will do everything they can to blast you to atoms! Fortunately you have state-of-the-art systems to help you out...\n\nBRIDGE - Scan for threats, repair shields and communicate with your crew.\n\nWAR ROOM - The Captain planned ahead, and left emergency dossiers to help you out.\n\nARMORY - Destroy alien ships with torpedoes, and activate auto-turrets to repel boarders.\n\nCPU CORE - Power-up your crew with skills.\n\nCARGO HOLD - Bust open the cargo pods to grab lasers, scanners, and other helpful gear.\n\nINFIRMARY - He's dead, Jim! Oh wait... no... it's just a flesh wound. That can be fixed here.\n\nSCIENCE LAB - Upgrade the ship, and research spooky, sub-space anomalies.\n\nENGINEERING - Fix the Jump Core to get the heck outta there!\n\nJUMP TO HYPERSPACE!\n\nIf you can stay cool, repel the aliens, protect the crew, and keep the systems operational long enough to repair the Jump Core, then you can activate the engines and escape to Hyperspace!\n\nOr is it Warp Speed? I can never remember...\n\nVtyjdyjtdujyfuykyf ,\n\nA solid game, but hereâs a quick heads up.\n\nI had not played or had even heard the original board game until I came across the AppStore port. Iâve only played a few games so far, and but I think itâs very solid. I havenât encountered any bugs yet, the animations, graphics, and voice acting capture the original art style and tone of the game very well. The tutorial is good for teaching you the base mechanics of the game but it leaves the exact specifics and team synergies for you to figure out, which is something I really like. I think itâs very good game, but Moving onto that little heads up notice: there currently only seven crew members available, with devs planning to add more in the coming months. The currently available crew members are: the Admiral, the Chief Engineer, the Crew Member, the Soldier, the Cyborg, the Ensign, and the Councilor. This limited choice was actually helpful for me, as it didnât have the overwhelming selection of the full crew. Just a heads up. All in all, I think itâs a good game.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nThanks for the kind words - so glad we helped you discover this fantastic board game! Your are spot on with the tutorial... happy to hear you are down for experimentation once the training wheels are off! We are absolutely bringing new crew... there are currently 16 available, and we are on track for delivering the whole gang by the end of 2021! ðð"
