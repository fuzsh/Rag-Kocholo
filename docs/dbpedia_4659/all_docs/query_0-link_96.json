        "text": "Capcom has announced that Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be getting a physical release on November 8. The launch comes two months after the game’s digital release on September 19.\n\n“It releases a bit later than the digital version, but we hope you pick up whichever version you prefer [for Xbox or PlayStation],” producer Kei Morimoto said.\n\nIn addition to the announcement on a physical release, Capcom gave players a nearly 12-minute video that goes into details on some of the enhancements coming to the game as well as some new gameplay.\n\n“You can tell what they’re thinking just by looking at them,” Morimoto said of the improvements to the games facial expressions where they recaptured the game’s facial motion capture.\n\nEven things such as Paradise Plaza in the shopping mall received a face lift to add to the feel and immersion of the game.\n\nYou can check out everything in the latest Director’s Report for yourself, below."
