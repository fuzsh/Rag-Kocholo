It is a one-versus-four game in which one player takes on the role of a Killer and the other four play as Survivors;[a] the Killer must hunt and impale each Survivor on sacrificial hooks to appease a malevolent force known as the Entity, while the Survivors have to avoid being caught and power up the exit gates by working together to fix five generators.\n\nThe game was released for Windows in 2016;[1] PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2017;[2][3][4] Nintendo Switch in 2019; Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, Google Stadia, and Xbox Series X/S in 2020;[5] and Steam Deck in 2023.[6][b] Swedish studio Starbreeze Studios published the game on behalf of Behaviour from 2016 until 2018, when Behaviour bought the publishing rights.[7][8] Italian company 505 Games publishes the Nintendo Switch version, while Austrian company Deep Silver publishes physical copies for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions. Cross-play was added to the game in 2020 to allow play with people on other platforms, while cross-progression followed in 2024 to allow players with accounts on different platforms to share everything they had unlocked across each account.[9] The game ran on Unreal Engine 4 from 2016 to 2024,[10] when it upgraded to Unreal Engine 5.[11]\n\nDead by Daylight received mixed reviews upon release, but was a commercial success; it has since attracted more than 60 million players and improved its ratings. In 2023, it was announced that production companies Blumhouse Productions and Atomic Monster had begun developing a film adaptation.\n\nGameplay\n\n[edit]\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical horror game where one player is the Killer and the other four are Survivors.[12] Matches are referred to as trials. The Survivors' objective is to escape the trial by repairing five of seven generators scattered throughout it to power the two exit gates. The Killer must impale all Survivors on hooks before they escape, which will cause them to be sacrificed to a malevolent force known as the Entity. If only one Survivor remains, an escape hatch opens at a random location on the map; if the Killer closes the hatch or an exit gate is opened, the two-minute \"Endgame Collapse\" begins, with the timer being extended if there are any incapacitated or hooked Survivors. When the timer ends, any remaining Survivors are immediately sacrificed to the Entity.\n\nWhen hunting Survivors, the Killer must capture them by either striking them with their weapon twice and picking them up off the ground while they are in the dying state (one strike injures Survivors and a second strikes puts them into the dying state) or by grabbing them in one move by catching them unexpectedly while they interact with objects such as generators. Although Survivors can attempt to pull themselves free of the hook the first time they are impaled, there is only a 3% chance of success and failed attempts lead to a faster death. They can also be saved by other Survivors. If they are hooked a second time, they enter a phase in which they must resist the Entity as it attempts to take them out of the game by performing skill checks until they are either killed or rescued. If they are hooked a third time, they will be sacrificed to the Entity.\n\nThe Survivors' movement options consist of sprinting, walking, crouch-walking, or crawling if they are in the dying state. They must elude the Killer by losing their line of sight in a chase or by successfully hiding from them. Most Killers can move at a pace that is moderately faster than that of a sprinting Survivor but are slower in other movements, such as vaulting obstacles, which can buy Survivors time. Survivors can throw down wooden pallets placed at key locations on the map, and if the Killer is close enough to the pallet when the Survivor throws it down, they will be stunned for a brief moment. The Survivor can then vault over the downed pallet, but most Killers cannot, and must either spend time to break the pallet or go around it. The Killer also has an aura-reading ability, constantly revealing the location of generators, hooks, and sometimes Survivors. Every Killer has their own unique power that can be altered using add-ons obtained through gameplay. A significant amount of the gameplay revolves around chases, with Survivors using their environment and wits to outmanoeuvre the Killer and escape them or at least buy time for their allies to complete objectives.\n\nSurvivors can unlock chests to find useful items or bring items at the start of the trial, such as maps that highlight the locations of objectives, keys that can be used for certain aura-reading abilities or re-opening a closed escape hatch, toolboxes for quicker generator repairs, med-kits for quicker healing, and flashlights that can be used to blind the Killer temporarily; the latter, if the Killer is carrying a Survivor, will let that Survivor escape. All Killers have an innate \"terror radius\" that surrounds them, although the size of the terror radius varies depending on the Killer, the state of the Killer's power, and what add-ons or perks they may have. Survivors inside the radius will hear a heartbeat, which increases in intensity with proximity to the Killer.[c] They can also see a red light called the \"red stain\" emanating from the Killer's head onto the ground, which reveals the direction they are facing and can help the Survivors determine when the Killer is about to come around a corner. Some Killers have the ability to suppress their terror radius and red stain under certain conditions, enabling them to surprise unaware Survivors.\n\nObjectives\n\n[edit]\n\nSurvivor interactions with many objects in the game can trigger random skill checks. The player can either perform a good skill check which has no additional effect, a great skill check which speeds up the progression of the action the player is taking, or a failed skill check which usually notifies the Killer of the Survivor's location and may also cause a loss of progress. Great skill checks require more precision, and may not always be possible depending on the type of interaction or the perks being used by either the Survivor or the Killer. Killers have the ability to damage generators, which will slightly regress their repair progress and continue regressing progress slowly until a Survivor resumes repairing it for at least a few seconds, and may trigger certain perks.\n\nIf the Killer catches a Survivor, the Killer can pick them up and carry them to one of many sacrificial hooks scattered throughout the map. While being carried, the Survivor can attempt to wiggle out of the Killer's grasp by successfully hitting consecutive skill checks before they reach the hook. When a Survivor is hooked, they gain a hook stage up to a maximum of three stages; when they are hooked for the first time, they can wait to be rescued or attempt to unhook themselves. If they are left too long or hooked again, they will progress to the second stage, during which they have to succeed at skill checks before another Survivor rescues them. If a Survivor is hooked a third time or left long enough to progress to the third stage, they are sacrificed and removed from the match.\n\nOnce five generators are repaired, the exit gates are powered, allowing Survivors to open the gates and escape from the match. The game only ends when all Survivors have either escaped or died; thus, while some Survivors may escape and finish early, those still inside must keep playing. Players who have escaped or died have the ability to cycle through the remaining players' points of view as a spectator or return to the main menu.\n\nIf only one Survivor remains, repairing generators is typically not practical. When the other three Survivors have escaped or have died, an escape hatch will appear somewhere throughout the map. If the Survivor finds this hatch first, they may escape through it, but if the Killer finds it first, then they can close it. If the Killer closes the hatch, the exit gates become powered as though the generator objective was completed, allowing the remaining Survivor a way to escape the trial.\n\nPerks\n\n[edit]\n\nSurvivors and Killers each have the option to use up to four perks in their loadout, which gives their characters special abilities. Perks differ between Survivors and Killers; a Survivor perk may not be used by Killers and vice versa. Examples of Survivor perks include a burst of speed when running from the Killer, the ability to self-heal without a med-kit, briefly sabotaging sacrificial hooks without a toolbox, and many more. Examples of Killer perks include seeing Survivors through walls, hindering the effects of struggling Survivors while taking them to a hook, preventing generators from being worked on, regressing generators, speeding up the recovery from a missed basic attack, and many more.\n\nThere are a number of \"general perks\" that start unlocked for any character to learn. Additionally, each specific character starts off with a set of three perks that are unique to them. Perks, add-ons, and items can be unlocked through the Bloodweb, a skill tree where each character can spend in-game currency. Advancing to level 50 in a character's Bloodweb allows the player to \"prestige\" that particular character. Doing so resets the character back to level 1 and unlocks the next tier (level) of the character's unique perks to every other character owned of the same role if there is a higher tier.\n\nSetting\n\n[edit]\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nA group of four Survivors must elude one Killer obsessed with sacrificing them on hooks to a malevolent being called the Entity. The Survivors' perspectives are third-person,[8] while most Killer's perspectives are first-person.[d] The Survivors can only fight back by stunning the Killer or using items such as flashlights to blind them. Survivors can also vault over obstacles much faster than the Killer, providing a means of escape. Survivors use these obstacles and tools to help them elude the Killer for as long as they can. In order to escape, Survivors must repair five of the seven generators scattered across the map to power up the exit gates. They must then open the exit gates and escape through them; the final Survivor may also find an unmarked escape hatch to jump into, though the hatch can be shut if the Killer finds it first. Repairing generators can be made quicker with items such as toolboxes, or if the player repairs a generator alongside other Survivors, or if certain perks are equipped to help the process along.[14]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Entity, an eldritch horror that exists between dimensions, is attracted to actions of great violence and malice. The majority of Killers, most of whom are serial murderers or victims of terrible tragedy, are pulled out of reality by the Entity and convinced or forced to do its bidding.[e] In order to maintain its existence, the Entity requires sacrifices and demands that they hunt and kill the Survivors so it can feed off their emotions and steal a piece of their souls upon death. In order to continue this hunt, the Entity blocks off the gateways of death and puts the Survivors into a dreamlike state that leads them back to the Entity's purgatory-esque world to get hunted again.\n\nThe Survivors are pulled into the Entity's constructed world when they wander into the woods or explore abandoned buildings, disappearing from the real world without a trace. More recent Survivors have entered through other methods such as being taken right before they die or sending themselves there using witchcraft. They end up at a campfire in the woods, where they rest between trials until a Killer pursues them again. Each trial takes place in a series of realms constructed by the Entity of areas related to each Killer's history. Escaping from the grounds always takes the Survivors back to the campfire, and offerings can be created to be burnt at it and appeal to the Entity. Since the Entity feeds off of Survivors' hopes of escaping, it helps them just as much as it helps Killers, acting as an impartial observer of the hunt and stepping in only to claim those successfully sacrificed to it.\n\nEach original Survivor and Killer also has their own individual backstory which explains their personality and their unique abilities, along with how they end up in the realm of the Entity. These backstories are expanded in \"Tomes\" where completing in-game challenges unlocks more information. These Tomes are released every few months alongside a battle pass known as \"The Rift\".\n\nDownloadable content\n\n[edit]\n\nAlongside original characters, the game licenses characters and settings from several franchises. As of July 2024, the game has featured 39 individual DLC releases in total. Most DLC releases include both a new Survivor and Killer, except for ten where only one character was introduced and four where three characters were introduced. 25 of the DLCs released have also introduced new maps that are accessible to all players. The DLCs release with an average of three months between each one. Prior to the release of every DLC since the Clown, a Public Test Build (PTB) becomes available to PC players, which allows the developers of the game to test and receive community feedback on major upcoming changes. Once the PTB has been out for roughly two weeks, it is disabled for further maintenance on the upcoming DLC, such as bug fixing and adding missing features. The estimated time span between the opening of the PTB and a new DLC's release is approximately 2–3 weeks, and the DLC typically releases a few days after the shutdown of the PTB.\n\n19 of the currently released DLCs have featured licensed Killers and Survivors from both popular horror franchises and other video games. The DLCs can be acquired by either purchasing them normally through Steam or non-licensed characters can be purchased through a shop within the game using an in-game currency called iridescent shards. This alternative way of obtaining the DLCs was introduced in the 2.0 update. Each DLC has its own trailer and a so-called \"spotlight\" that exhibits the Killer and Survivor as well as a new in-game map. The relevant DLC does not need to be purchased in order for any map to be played on. Three DLCs (The Last Breath, Left Behind, and A Lullaby for the Dark) have been distributed for free.\n\nIn August 2021, Behaviour announced that the Stranger Things DLC (including individual characters from the DLC and their cosmetics) would no longer be available for purchase after November 17 and that the Hawkins National Laboratory map would be removed from rotation. All characters from the DLC, as well as their cosmetics, remained usable by players who purchased them before the removal date.[15] On November 6, 2023, Behavior announced that all Stranger Things content would be returning to the game.[16]\n\nIn October 2021, Behaviour collaborated with Boss Protocol to release the Pinhead character model as an NFT.[17] This led to criticism from players, with Steam reviews of the DLC falling down to a \"Mostly Negative\" rating.[18][19][20] However, it was later revealed that Behaviour gave license holders access to character models, and that the license holder had collaborated to create the NFTs using the in-game Pinhead model without Behaviour's involvement.\n\nIn addition to DLCs, other collaborations have resulted in purely cosmetic items being added to existing characters. Collaborations with Crypt TV and Attack on Titan added cosmetic items to original characters in order to make them resemble characters from those franchises.[21][22] Cosmetic items have also been added from video game franchises such as For Honor, Meet Your Maker,[23] PUBG: Battlegrounds,[24] Rainbow Six Siege,[25] and Naughty Bear.[26] Collaborations with real people have resulted in cosmetic items inspired by heavy metal bands Iron Maiden and Slipknot, as well as actor Nicolas Cage being a playable Survivor.[27][28]\n\nList\n\n[edit]\n\n† This symbol denotes DLCs that unveiled licensed characters.\n\nDownloadable content for Dead by Daylight Title Release Date Killer Survivor(s) Map (Realm) Ref.

The characters introduced were still available to play for those who had purchased them prior to the removal, however the Underground Complex map was not accessible during this time.\n\nb.^ ^ The Raccoon City Police Station map introduced in the Resident Evil chapter was reworked and split into two separate maps for the Resident Evil: Project W chapter due to issues with sizing and pathing. The original map is no longer accessible.\n\nc.^ The Shelter Woods map was introduced with the release of the game in 2016. However, with the release of the Tools of Torment chapter, a new landmark, The Hunting Camp, was added to the map. This landmark is modeled after The Skull Merchant's lore and can be seen in the chapter's reveal trailer.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nDead by Daylight received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator Metacritic.[70] GameSpot awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying, \"At launch, Dead by Daylight suffered because of its reliance on peer-to-peer hosting and absent social features, but over time it rectified these issues. And while a brief and premature tussle with skill-based matchmaking turned the new player experience into a bit of a horror show (a problem which is now [was] fixed), thanks to its community of players Dead by Daylight is without peer in the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer arena, and has grown into one of the most robust horror experiences around.\"[75] Luke Winkie of PC Gamer awarded it a score of 88 out of 100, saying, \"In the five years since Behaviour Interactive released Dead by Daylight on Steam, the game has developed razor-sharp mechanical intrigue, an ultra-complex web of versatile builds and strategies, and a diverse suite of characters, each equipped with relative strengths and weaknesses.\"[76]\n\nSales\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring its first week, Dead by Daylight sold more than 270,000 copies.[77][78] The game sold more than 1 million copies within 2 months.[79][80] On November 16, 2017, more than 3 million copies were sold.[81] As of May 2019, the game sold more than 5 million copies.[82] In August 2020, the game reached more than 25 million players across all platforms.[83] This number reached 36 million by May 2021,[84] 50 million by May 2022,[85] and 60 million by November 2023.[86]\n\nPopularity and impact\n\n[edit]\n\nDead by Daylight has become increasingly popular in Japan due to Behaviour catering to Japanese players with the release of Japanese-themed chapters like \"The Shattered Bloodline\" and \"The Cursed Legacy\", as well as expanding the lore of its in-game universe, which the Japanese gaming community tends to favor in video games. In return, the country has become one of the biggest markets for the game,[87] becoming so popular that a Dead by Daylight-themed Entity Café opened on the fourth floor of the Tokyo Skytree in August 2021.[88]\n\nOriginal Dead by Daylight characters and items have appeared in other video games. In Payday 2, Dead by Daylight initially launched with an optional \"Deluxe Edition\" for an additional price which granted cosmetics for Payday 2 as well as a discount for Payday 2 owners who pre-ordered the game.[78][89] The Ubisoft fighting game For Honor featured a crossover event called \"Survivors of the Fog\" from October 21 to November 11, 2021, which featured Dead by Daylight-inspired cosmetic items and a limited-time game mode that featured the Trapper as an AI-controlled enemy.[90][91] From October 21 to November 7, 2022, PUBG: Battlegrounds featured a crossover event with Dead by Daylight which saw the traditionally battle royale game introduce a new mode in which players would repair generators and escape from the killer, alongside cosmetics that emulate certain survivors and killers from the game. The mobile port of Battlegrounds, New State Mobile, also received a similar event. By playing at least one match of the special PUBG game mode, players were given a unique code to unlock cosmetics in Dead by Daylight.[92][93] Other video games in which Dead by Daylight characters appeared were Deathgarden, Meet Your Maker,[23] Move or Die,[94] and Rainbow Six Siege.[95]\n\nMobile release\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Behaviour Interactive Inc. announced the plan to release Dead by Daylight to iOS and Android for free in an attempt to make the game more accessible to players around the world.[96] A different development team was formed that is fully dedicated to optimizing the game for the mobile experience. Dead by Daylight Mobile was initially slated for launch in 2019, however the developers had to push the release to 2020, citing their need for more time to work on bugs and optimize.[97] On February 27, 2019, Behaviour announced that the mobile versions will be published by Chinese video game publisher NetEase Games in Southeast Asia, Japan, and Korea.[98] It was released in EMEA, the Americas, and South Asia on April 16, 2020.[99][100]\n\nIn its 48 hours of release, Dead by Daylight Mobile outnumbered 1 million downloads.[101] By October 2020, the game surpassed 10 million downloads.[102] By May 2022, the game reached 25 million downloads.[103] In December 2022, Behaviour Interactive announced that an improved global version is being developed co-operatively by Behaviour Interactive and NetEase Games. They removed the old global version from the mobile storefronts on December 16, 2022, and announced that the improved global version will be released in February 2023. Then, it got delayed for one month and finally the improved global version released on March 15, 2023.[104]\n\nSpin-offs and other media\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim\n\n[edit]\n\nHooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim is a visual novel dating simulator game released on August 3, 2022. In 2021, Behaviour Interactive held a survey regarding Dead by Daylight, with one of the questions asked of the fans was about what type of genre they would like the company to explore in the future featuring Dead by Daylight's characters; one of the possible options was a dating sim.[105][106] On February 22, 2022, it was discovered that on February 16, Behaviour Interactive had filed a trademark for a project titled Hooked on You: A Dead by Daylight Dating Sim.[107] The description for the trademark states that it covers video games, as well as comic books and graphic novels.[108][106] The game received an official announcement on May 17, 2022, during a developer livestream and officially released later that year on August 3.[109] The dating sim is a visual novel text-based game with an anime style.
