        "text": "This looks really fun! Does the absence of any license info mean itâs free to remix and whatnot? Iâve made a formatted version for personal use - more or less the same but toned down a little for my 7yoâs benefit.\n\nI like to make these things available in case itâs helpful to others. Full attribution etc, obviously.\n\nHad a fantastic time with this game. Doing a bunch of one-pagers to build confidence in my GMing skills and this did the trick. Everyone enjoyed being a vindictive little creature. I think this game can go either quite dark or quite silly depending on who your players are - for my group, we got a bit of both (e.g. pastry heist, but also brutally curb stomping the witch hunter with the help of some townies).\n\nI just finished a single-player game with my brother, my first time running a game. Very easy to improvise/react to dice rolls and still adhere to the premise of the game. Made a couple on-the-fly decisions because it was a one-player session (Dog showed up as a backup when things got dicey), but the Witch was vindicated and Magpie got the pleasure of plucking out the murderer's eyes.\n\nIâve never been GM before. Decided yesterday to run this game for my usual group this morning (regular GM is work-swamped so weâve been mostly just hanging out together for the past couple weeks). It went SO well!!!\n\nI made my own character sheet template in Google Docs since weâre all remote from each other and meet online. I put the âYou are a cute woodland animal.â, traits section, and then the whole bottom section where it explains âwhen you try to do something â what happens and the Danger stuff and everything. Then I put a horizontal line and put stuff from the part of the pdf that looks like a character sheet. It looks pretty dope, if I do say so myself, and avoids having the players be able to see the GM roll tables. This worked out great, too!\n\nThe game was easy for me to run with no experience. My players were amazing and got into it very fast. We had a lot of fun and a lot of laughs.\n\nto the developer: I love the idea of this game, but my RP group likes something with a few more crunchy rules, so I've made a pathfinder module based on it. Fun to play, and I'd like to release it into the wild under a CC sharealike noncommercial license - is that ok? Will reference your game in the obligatory copyright section with a link here. :)"
