        "text": "Just over a decade ago, I was lucky enough to write a large article for SciFiNow magazine about the complete history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I interviewed several people for the article, mostly comic creators but also those involved in the cartoons too, and used snippets for those interviews throughout the printed feature. After writing about the NES version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters this week, I thought it would be fun to dig one of those original interviews out of the archives and share it here. What follows is an unedited Q&A with TMNT co-creator Peter Laird, presented in its entirety for the first time.\n\nFor context, this interview was conducted in February 2012. This was around three years after Laird sold his ownership of the TMNT to Nickelodeon, who were preparing to launch their first CG animated cartoon, were planning a new live action movie for 2014 and had, the year before, licensed IDW to publish a new ongoing Turtles comic with direct involvement from other co-creator, Kevin Eastman. Additionally, as part of the sale, Laird had negotiated the rights to publish a small number of his own TMNT comics from time to time, under the Mirage banner, if he wished. In the ten years since, he’s published two full issues, with no others since 2015.\n\nThis interview definitely captures a specific moment in time and I think Laird took the opportunity to share some very honest reflections. Please recognise that although these were his thoughts and opinions at the time, it was over ten years ago, and some of his views may have changed in the past decade.\n\nI hope you find it interesting…\n\nThe origins of the TMNT are well known by now but I’d like to hear what you think were some of the most important decisions you and Kevin Eastman made during those earliest days.\n\nPeter Laird: Probably keeping ownership and control of the TMNT intellectual property, copyrights and trademarks, was the biggest “smart move” Kevin and I made. But there was a moment early on, before we signed with our licensing agent, Mark Freedman of Surge Licnesing, who then took the Turtles to Playmates Toys (the rest being, as they say, history) when we briefly considered doing something which could very well have changed our futures radically. We had a meeting with Archie Goodwin, who edited the “Epic” comics line at Marvel Comics at the time, about possibly turning the TMNT into an Epic-published title.\n\nWe were excited about the possibilities, because being an Epic title would have brought significant prestige, and it also meant newsstand distribution. But then I looked over the contract they were offering us, and it meant we’d make about half of what we were making at the time (doing the publishing ourselves), we’d have an editor assigned to us (something which had NO appeal to us), and, probably the biggest thing in retrospect, Marvel would get 50% of any royalties from any merchandising of the TMNT, if that happened.\n\nSuddenly, the idea of being an Epic comic seemed a LOT less appealing, and we thanked them and declined the offer.\n\nIs there anything, in hindsight, you feel the two of you should have done differently?\n\nPL: I would have gotten professional people, lawyers, accountants, and such, involved much earlier. And if there is such a thing, I think it would have been good for Kevin and I to have had some kind of “business partner counseling.” It might have allowed us to continue working together. Then again, maybe not.\n\nWhat do you think the process of collaboration between yourself and Kevin Eastman brought to the comic that was greater than the sum of its parts – if anything?\n\nPL: Like many successful collaborations, we sort of filled in our respective weak spots, complementing each other’s abilities. In terms of the artwork, there were things that Kevin was better at than me, and vice versa, and that made doing the books a lot easier. Story-wise, I think Kevin was more into the action parts, while I tended to pay more attention to the logic of plot and dialogue, so we balanced each other out well.\n\nWhen the 1987 cartoon went into production how much creative control did you have, and what’s your opinion of the series as a whole?\n\nPL: In the very beginning, before it became successful, we had significant creative input and a certain level of control. Once it hit big, that essentially disappeared, and the people doing the cartoon decided that they knew best and basically stopped listening to us. If we had been a little more hip to how business is done, we probably could have pushed it and gotten a lot of that control back… But we were pretty naive back then.\n\nI grew quite tired of the repetition and silliness of the show after the first year or two, and ended up not even watching the episodes in the later seasons. I appreciate what that first series did for the TMNT property in terms of helping to make it a “household name”, but I felt then, and still feel, that it could have been much, much better.\n\nAs the TMNT grew into a multimedia franchise, how did it affect your work on the comic?\n\nPL: Very quickly, both Kevin and I started feeling swamped with all the stuff we needed to do to keep up with the growth of the business, and it really took away from the time we needed to do the comics. That’s the main reason we started having other creators do fill-in issues.\n\nAs far as creative decisions, I think we were pretty successful keeping the comics separate from the mass-market stuff, the toys, animation and so forth. The TMNT black and white comic book published by Mirage Studios was our thing, and we kept it that way.\n\nThe live action TMNT film was a huge commercial success that managed to appeal to fans of both the comic and cartoon. From a behind the scenes perspective, to what do you credit its success?\n\nPL: Well, beyond the fact that, however immodest it might sound, the Turtles are great characters, the first live action movie benefited greatly from having a director, Steve Barron, who had a fantastic visual sense, respected the source material and played it straight, and also from having the Jim Henson group doing the costumes for the Turtles and Splinter. They did an incredible job.\n\nAnd what do you think of the two sequels?\n\nPL: I thought the second TMNT movie was somewhat wretched, and a huge step backwards, and the third TMNT movie was okay, but could have been much better.\n\nHere’s a little anecdote about the second movie: The first movie had been a huge success, and at the time it had grossed something like a hundred and thirty-five million dollars. I visited the set of the second movie, around the time they started filming, and was distressed by the apparent cheesiness of the sets I saw and the goofy “take” on the Turtles this movie seemed to have. I went out to dinner with a few of the producers, who started talking about all the ways the first movie had gone wrong, and how they were going to “fix” those problems with the second movie, stuff like how it was too dark, too violent, the actress playing April O’Neil didn’t test well with young boys, etc.. I pointed out that the first movie had cost something like fifteen million dollars to make and had, at that point, already brought it a hundred and thirty-five million dollars. What was the problem? What, exactly, needed to be “fixed”? It was pretty clear to me that, at least as a business proposition, the first movie was clearly not too dark or too violent, and young boys must have liked the original April actress well enough, because the move brought in ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS! Geez.\n\nBut my comments fell on deaf ears, and the second movie was not even close to the success that the first one was, either financially or creatively. I hasten to add that I am NOT saying here that if they had acted on my suggestions, the second movie would surely have been a huge success. But I do feel strongly that if they had REALLY looked at what made the first movie successful, and kept their egos reined in, it may very well have made the sequel a much better and well-received movie. But at this point, who can say, really?\n\nThe popularity of the TMNT hit its lowest point around the mid to late Nineties. Why do you think it happened at that time?\n\nPL: In large part, it was the typical cyclical nature of the business. The Turtles had ruled the roost for a number of years (It was the number one boys action figure line for, I think, six years in a row), and then they just started to wane.\n\nAnd how difficult was it to rebuild the brand around the early 2000s?\n\nPL: Well, for a few years, the Turtles were almost completely dormant. There was some bits and pieces of licensing going on, but not a lot. Then we managed to connect with 4Kids, and they were interested in being our licensing agency AND putting up some money to put the Turtles back on TV. They had a block of TV time they needed to fill, and felt the Turtles were perfect for it. And it worked out quite well. It never got to the crazy heights of the first mass-marketing of the Turtles, but it was successful, and I enjoyed the heck out of it.\n\nWhat do you think the 2003 TV series did better in comparison to the 1987 one?\n\nPL: I think it treated the TMNT property the way Kevin and I treated it from day one, as an adventure story told with some humor. The original TMNT show and toy line went in exactly the opposite direction, doing it as a comedy show with some action. I prefer the former approach, and had a lot of fun working with 4Kids on the 2003 TV series. I’m proud of what we were able to do with that show. I pushed hard for that approach to the show, and really, it’s what I would have wanted the first time out, instead of the goofy “Cowabunga” Turtles. I think it comes down to a matter of taste.\n\nSimilarly, how do you look back at the 2007 animated movie?\n\nPL: I like it a lot, though there are some things I would have liked to have seen done differently. Not many, just a few. And I still think the animation was, for the most part, fantastic.\n\nAround 2009 it was reported that you were collaborating on a new movie, using a hybrid of live action and CGI. How far did that project progress and what happened to it?\n\nPL: As I recall, we had started working on a story, hired a screenwriter, and were trying to put together the production deal. There were discussions about how to do the effects, and it was pretty exciting to envision the Turtles realized in live-action with current CGI “face replacement” technology. Then the sale of the property to Viacom finally came to fruition (after what seemed like a LONG time) and Mirage’s part in the future of the TMNT was over. I understand that there is a new movie in pre-production, but don’t know anything about it, really.\n\nThere’s still a core group of fans (myself included) who would love you and Jim Lawson to conclude the Mirage Comics Volume 4 storyline. Do you think it will ever happen?\n\nPL: I appreciate that you liked the Volume 4 comics, and it is possible that Jim and I will team up again to finish that series. I can’t say when that might happen, though there is at least one more issue which has been drawn, and I may finish that one up this year. We’ll see.\n\nHave you seen Kevin Eastman and IDW’s new TMNT comic series? If so, what do you think?\n\nPL: I have seen a few issues. Honestly, I’m not too thrilled about it, for a number of reasons. It just seems to have a kind of generic feel to it, and what I understand so far about how they have altered the origin story makes me roll my eyes. It seems to me like change for change’s sake, and not an improvement.\n\nAlso, having seen Kevin’s rough layouts for the books, I am disappointed that they didn’t strike a deal with him to just draw the whole thing! He’s done some very neat breakdowns, and not much of them, as far as I can tell, is reflected in the finished artwork.\n\nTo be fair, this may be one of those situations where you need to read a whole bunch of the issues at one sitting to get the real gist of it, so I think I will reserve making firm judgements about it until they come out with a collection, so I can read the first bunch of issues in one sitting in a convenient fashion.\n\nI will say this, though; IDW has put together one of the nicest (possibly THE nicest) reprint collections of our original TMNT comics. It’s beautiful.\n\nFinally, when the new TMNT movie is finally completed do you intend to go see it?\n\nPL: I think so. I’m somewhat ambivalent about it. I suspect that there will be things about it which will make me crazy. But on the other hand, it might turn out really well. I’ll wait and see."
