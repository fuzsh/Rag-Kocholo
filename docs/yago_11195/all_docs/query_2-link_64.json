        "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is here to usher in a new era of the Heroes in a Half-Shell, which it does with grand style, great humor, and tons of heart.\n\nThe Ninja Turtles are back on the big screen (once again), bringing a fresh—modernized—take on the iconic heroes in animated form. I couldn’t be happier. I’ve been a TMNT fan since the late 80s/early 90s and have long credited the original series and live-action films as the impetus for me getting into Martial Arts (which fundamentally impacted my life).\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nDirected By: Jeff Rowe\n\nWritten By: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Jeff Rowe, Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez\n\nStarring: Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nocals Cantu, Brady Noon, Ayo Edebiri, Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Rose Byrne\n\nRelease Date: August 2, 2023\n\nSince then, I’ve mostly enjoyed just about everything TMNT. The games left an indelible mark on me as a youngster, while I’ve found plenty of reason to watch the various animated series reboots over the decades. The big screen attempts in recent memory have been a mixed bag, to say the least, but somehow, I’ve never lost that thrill of seeing the Turtles in action.\n\nEach incarnation brings something new to the table, offering something for new generations that doesn’t always land with older fans. Mutant Mayhem, however, comes out of the gate strong and feels like it’s the most “definitive” version of the heroes on screen since the original films.\n\nStory Basics\n\nIn modern day New York City, four mutant brothers live in the sewers, hidden away from the larger world. Trained in the art of Ninjitsu thanks to their (also mutant) father, the Turtles are fearsome fighters and able to stealthily walk among us. As teenagers, however, their greatest wish is to be accepted and live amongst the people.\n\nWhen they chance upon, and help, a young human (April O’Neil), they’re able to see how their skills can be used for something other than sneaking around for supplies/defense. As a rash of violent attacks plague the city, they team up with April and embark on a perilous journey that could make them heroes; ultimately gaining the acceptance they desperately crave.\n\nThe discovery of fellow mutants, also shunned by society, offers a look at what could be, but sinister plots force them to confront what they want and what’s right. In order to save the city (and the world), they’ll have to come together as a team in order to learn what being a hero is really about.\n\nBy and large, it’s a pretty standard TMNT story formula. Obviously, I’m avoiding any spoilers, but it manages to hit familiar story beats, with iconic characters, in a totally new story we haven’t seen before.\n\nIt’s impressively handled; hitting all the “origin” beats necessary for newcomers, without dragging things out. The result is a fast-paced story that keeps the humor and action going, while steadily building to an impressive/surprisingly emotional finale.\n\nDrawn to Life\n\nMutant Mayhem is a damn fine movie. Two of the biggest reasons it’s so great boils down to it’s gorgeous animation style along with the characterizations of the iconic heroes. Seriously, it’s a STUNNING movie.\n\nAs you’ve seen from the trailers, the animation brings some impressive flair to the world. It’s…tough to describe, honestly. It’s a blend of cartoony sketches, along with an almost stop-motion animated look. It pulls together from a number of styles/techniques, that gives the story/characters a unique style all its own.\n\nThis is highlighted in the film’s many action sequences, which combines great choreography with the style/perspective only animation can provide. It’s just…so fun to watch. Even without the story elements making the action more impactful, they’re impressively well put together. Bringing genuine martial arts techniques (AT LAST) with fun camera angles/cuts each sequence feels fun and engaging, with a “holy crap” factor that will make subsequent viewings just as good.\n\nThere’s one sequence that essentially combines four different fights into a single scene, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. It makes perfect sense for how it moves the story along, while also highlighting their individual skills.\n\nBeyond that, however, the characters themselves are just fantastic. I don’t think I can say enough about the performances all around. Casting actual youngsters as the Turtles was a brilliant decision, and their enthusiasm is palpable in every scene. They ooze sincerity regardless of the scene, bringing an authentic quality to the humor and serious moments that seem impossible to imitate.\n\nMake no mistake, these kids ARE the Ninja Turtles. This film simply wouldn’t work without their genuine camaraderie and charm, which the script caters to in spades.\n\nMore than any other TMNT project, Mutant Mayhem captures the feeling of them being teenagers. Even as we see the things that make them different, the film’s ability to fully immerse/ground their personalities in that fact, makes their journey immediately relatable (and hilarious). Even as things get more and more fantastical, the great characterization of the Turtles keeps you invested on just about every level.\n\nGetting to the Core of the Turtles\n\nPerhaps what’s most impressive to me with Mutant Mayhem, is how it manages to make changes to the TMNT lore without feeling…off. Again without getting into spoilers, the movie makes some fairly significant changes to things considered integral to the Turtles‘ backstory and status quo. And yet none of it feels out of place or strange, even for long-time Turtle fans (like myself).\n\nThis is because the filmmakers seem to have a fundamental understanding of what makes these characters tick. Even as they switch things up, everything feels natural as it lines up with everything we’ve come to expect from the Turtles. The themes of loyalty, brotherhood, acceptance, and learning what it means to be a hero are all there. The characterizations are so on point that such changes manage to feel logical within the story/modern interpretation we’re getting.\n\nTaking on a beloved franchise is never easy, especially in a reboot/revival capacity that ultimately brings changes to established lore. Even so, the filmmakers managed to navigate that fine line in a way that’s both satisfying and understandable to long-time fans, while being plenty endearing for newcomers coming in."
