        "text": "This exclusive just broke from The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nAfter the success of last year’s animated hit film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Paramount Pictures is keeping turtle power going by putting a new feature project into development.\n\nThis one, however, will go beyond the realm of the all-ages material the long-standing property is known for and instead go into gritty, R-rated, territory.\n\nParamount is developing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin, adapting a popular storyline seen in the recent IDW comics, as a live-action feature with the intent of making it for an R-rating...\n\nLive-Action, R-Rated ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Movie in the Works from Producer Walter Hamada (Exclusive)\n\nTyler Burton Smith, who co-wrote the upcoming action movie 'Boy Kills World,' is penning the script for this high-body count tale.\n\nFor those who have been paying attention, this may not be but so much a surprise. Paramount expressed a desire to turn The Last Ronin into its own franchise, which includes a new ongoing comic running parallel to IDW's ongoing book, as well as the video game adaptation.\n\nAnd since Mutant Mayhem is also getting both a sequel, as well as a new cartoon series. It looks like both the lighthearted and grittier aspects of the TMNT brand are looking to be in the best shape it's been in a long time.\n\nI would agree if TMNT hadn't originally been a Frank Miller homage/parody.\n\nThe 90s cartoon set the vibe everyone knows for the mainstream depiction of the turtles, but they started in the dark and gritty territory before becoming cartoony and kid-friendly.\n\nPlus this is gonna be an adaptation of an actual TMNT comic run, so nothing at all like the shock-value movies that take a children's story and twist it. This will be (potentially) the most faithful adaptation of TMNT yet.\n\nThis, plus such an attitude doesn't respect that TMNT has oscillated back and forth between the \"gritty\" and \"cartoony\" vibes plenty of times over its history. Sometimes, within the same media/series!\n\nFor example, the Archie comic, started out as straight adaptation of the '87 toon, before Mirage employees were given the reigns, and it began sharing things in common with the B&W original, while still retaining its own flavor. The very first iteration of April getting trained and becoming a respectable ninja in her own right? Originally came from this book."
