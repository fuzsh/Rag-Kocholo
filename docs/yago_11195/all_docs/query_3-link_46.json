        "text": "Like many other kids with unrestricted Cartoon Network access, on most Saturdays, you’d find me in front of the TV. It would be before my sister got up to turn on Spongebob and before my parents got up to turn on the news, but for about an hour every morning, between Teen Titans and re-runs of Dragon Ball, I’d find the heroes in the half shell: the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nTMNT got its start before my time in 1984, when comics reigned supreme. The first iterations of the series depicted the Ninja Turtles as grizzled heroes who were mature, brazen, and powerful. The concept of a non-human superhero took the world by storm, and having mutant turtles at the forefront of a comic book franchise was as profitable as it was original. Over the next nearly forty years, several adaptations of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created, including several television shows, Michael-Bay-directed movies, and a couple of questionable stage productions.\n\nIn the past five years, the Ninja Turtles have made a resurgence back into the public eye, with the television show “Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” airing in 2018, the movie by the same name appearing in 2022, and most recently, “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” releasing in theaters in 2023. What makes these adaptations different from their predecessors is the way in which they bring “Teenage” back to TMNT. Mutant Mayhem doesn’t shy away from the fact that the turtles are fifteen years old — in fact, it’s one of the core themes of the film.\n\nIn Mutant Mayhem, the four turtles — Donatello, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo — must grapple with the fact that they are outcasts from society due to their appearance and must make constant choices between the safety of the New York City sewer system and the excitement of the New York City streets. At the beginning of the film, they’re seen as monsters by the humans they protect, but despite the fact that they’re mutants, the turtles find kinship in some humans like April O’Neil, who is able to see past their appearance and recognize them as the heroes they are. Grappling with what it means to be a monster in a world that seems to be obsessed with othering is one of the most important threads in the movie. Despite being created by accident, the turtles still embrace their childhoods and act the same way human teenagers would. Mutant Mayhem is not the first film to discuss themes of othering, but it is one of the best films to discuss it in the modern day.\n\nThe main antagonist in Mutant Mayhem is Superfly, a fly who, just like the turtles, was mutated from a normal animal to a sentient being with thoughts and feelings and scorned by society. However, rather than seek to try and find his place in the world as he is, Superfly attempts to turn all humans on Earth into mutants so he doesn’t have to feel like a “freak” or unwanted anymore.\n\nBy all accounts, both the Ninja Turtles and Superfly are monsters. They began as scientific experiments who were accidentally mutated after coming in contact with toxic ooze and are cast out from society. Neither is able to assimilate into the human world at the start of their movie, but while the Ninja Turtles long for humans to accept them, Superfly only wants to take revenge on the humans and make them into the same monsters they’ve grown to hate.\n\nBy the end of the film, the Ninja Turtles are able to defeat Superfly and, with help from April, be seen as the heroes who saved New York City. The film doesn’t end with the turtles turning human or losing the part of themselves that society once deemed ugly and dangerous — they don’t “cease to be monsters.” Instead, they embrace who they are and no longer need to be afraid to show their faces on the streets of New York. In the end, the message of the story is not to conform to society and lose a part of yourself: it’s to find people who accept you for who you are no matter what.\n\nIn stories like Frankenstein, ideas of the “true” monster is one of the focal points of the book. While the creature tries so desperately to make his creator love him, Victor chooses to cast him away. On the other hand, in several iterations of TMNT, Master Splinter is the turtles’ father and treats them like his children. For example, in Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Splinter’s DNA — then human as actor and martial arts expert Lou Jitsu — is spliced with Barum Draxum’s, and with the help of the ooze, the turtles are born. Rather than become horrified with what he’s done, however, Splinter raises the turtles as his own and teaches them everything he knows. Unlike Frankenstein, though, the turtles loving humans rather than using them to take revenge on their creator is crucial to understanding their stories.\n\nIn the modern age, old depictions of monsters as disgusting creatures with no redeeming qualities or humanity are out. Exploring what it means to be seen as a “monster” and what it takes to overcome peoples’ initial negative perceptions of you are what makes stories like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so powerful. Despite being wanting to badly to be human at the start of the movie, the turtles come off as the most human characters in the entire movie. The turtles may be monsters, but that still won’t stop them from saving the day.\n\n-Sawyer"
