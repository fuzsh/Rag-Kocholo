        "text": "So profoundly bad that it represents the worst of two entirely different mediums, \"Ratchet & Clank\" doesn't blur the line between movies and videogames so much as it flushes them both in a toilet and forces us to watch as they swirl together down the drain. Some backstory: \"Ratchet & Clank\" is a deservedly popular series of videogames from a California studio called Insomniac, the first installment of which was released for the Playstation 2 back in 2002. Earlier this month, Insomniac launched a spiffed up HD remake of the original game, and thought that it might be a fun idea to promote it by partnering with Rainmaker Studios â€” an animation house responsible for 11 Barbie movies and \"Escape from Planet Earth\" â€” in order to create a feature-length film that essentially told the same story. They were very, very wrong.\n\nREAD THE FULL REVIEW ON INDIEWIRE\n\nVIDEO GAME MOVIE MARATHON REVIEW #39\n\nAlrighty! I've been waiting to talk about this one for a long time now! I remember seeing the trailers when I was younger and being excited that an animated video game movie was sticking close to the source material and actually looked like it could be fun for anyone of all ages! But then I was baffled by the shockingly poor reception from critics, as well as the hugely disappointing box office numbers even for a movie that only costed $20 million! I eventually gave it a watch after it already left theaters and actually enjoyed it quite a bit while also acknowledging that it was by no means a masterpiece and it couldâ€¦\n\nThis film is literally 70% cutscenes recycled from the game and 30% original content. Whilst the game is pretty fun and worth a playthrough, the film on the other hand is utterly pointless. I don't see how this would appeal to casual audiences, let alone the fans. There's nothing here that warrants shelling out real money. In the end it's nothing more than a quick cash grab from loyal fans of the original series.\n\nWould be better if Rivet was in the movie. Would be a sexier movie too...\n\n*ahem*\n\nI mean they should do a different villain as well.\n\nIt'd probably be a cuter movie as well.\n\nðŸ˜³\n\nRatchet and Clank: Rivet: Origins coming 2030. Sony ya'll better give me royalties if you take that title for a game.\n\nUuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh\n\nA waste of my time. Had a couple good zingers here and there but for the most part was a boring mess. The animation didn't look good for 2016, let alone up to par with the actual video game (which was good). Little kids may find some enjoyment, but older people will pray for it to end. I'd skip this one."
