        "text": "Just one week before the release of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies have announced that they're already working on a sequel film and a series for Paramount+ that'll \"bridge\" the two films.\n\nAccording to Variety, the show will be called \"Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\" and it will span two seasons. It will feature 2D animation, but there is no release date yet. In addition, Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon will all be reprising their roles as the Ninja Turtles for the series.\n\nPoint Grey Pictures will produce the Paramount+ series and will have Chris Yost, who worked on The Mandalorian and Thor: Ragnarok, as well as Alan Wan, who's worked on projects like Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, as executive producers and showrunners for the Paramount+ show. Meanwhile, the sequel will also be produced by Point Grey Pictures. It'll be directed by Jeff Rowe, who directed and co-wrote the upcoming TMNT film.\n\nFor more Ninja Turtle news, check out our story on how Xbox and TMNT are creating a pizza-scented controller, and watch how the turtles meet Superfly in a new Mutant Mayhem clip."
