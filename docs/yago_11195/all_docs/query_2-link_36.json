        "text": "\"The greatest, bravest teenage brothers are forced to fight solo.\" Paramount+ has launched the full official trailer for the animated spin-off series titled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, debuting in August later this summer. This is a continuation of the massively successful animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem from last year, one of my favorites as well. Set after the events of the 2023 movie, the Turtles arrive on the streets of New York, where they are faced with new threats & team up with old allies, to navigate through teenage life. They end up fighting a villain known as \"Bishop\" and her robot henchmen trying to get rid of mutants. The trailer sets up the \"they must fight on their own\" concept quite well. Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon reprise their roles from the film as the Turtles, alongside Ayo Edebiri reprising her role as April O'Neil. This series is the 5th animated TMNT TV show, and was originally announced last year along with the sequel to Mutant Mayhem. They're continuing with the sketch look from Mutant Mayhem, mixing it into Saturday Morning Cartoon style 2D animation. This looks like it should be entertaining! It's always a fun time with the Turtles.\n\nMain official trailer for Paramount+'s series Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, on YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the two teasers for Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right here for the first look."
