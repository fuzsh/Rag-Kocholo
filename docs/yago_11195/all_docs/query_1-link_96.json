        "text": "Using a meticulous and highly scientific process that involves pages of interview transcripts, formal and informal anonymous online polls and a basement-sized supercomputer (anointed \"Wii Man\" by some of our editors), we recently determined that IGN's reader are really interested in a number of subjects near and dear to our own hearts: comic books, science fiction, animation and, of course, humorous, well-placed action hero banter. In all of these areas, the forthcoming TMNT adaptation-update delivers the goods... and then some.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, IGN recently got the chance to talk to TMNT's director, Kevin Munroe, and producer, Tom Gray. After screening a compilation of footage from the new film, the pair sat down to discuss the process of putting together the computer-generated film, which is currently being completed in Hong Kong for its release date on March 23, 2007. In addition to describing their backgrounds with the material, Munroe and Gray discussed achieving a new look for the legendary series. (Stay tuned to IGN for Part Two of this interview, which features an extended preview of the footage shown to journalists in anticipation of the upcoming release!)\n\nIGN Movies: Some of us interviewed you guys at Comicon. How have things been going since then?\n\nKevin Munroe: Latest adventures? Less and less sleep everyday.\n\nTom Gray: Well the biggest thing that happened to us would be the Taiwan earthquake that knocked out our T3 line going back and forth. So that means, that when we get out information everyday, we have to send couriers back and forth hand carrying files everyday.\n\nMunroe: So the film is traveling on people's laps.\n\nGray: Yeah. Technology is a wonderful thing, it's all front-end here and then you ship it overnight to Hong Kong, but when the whole earthquake knocked out all the transpacific cable, which our T3 line is connected to, that is something we have to deal with on a manual basis. It won't affect the release date, but it certainly affected the production -- approvals from Kevin and the process. Just when you think you see the delivery date looming, something comes in.\n\nIGN: How far respectively do each of you guys go back into the TMNT franchise?\n\nGray: I go back to 1988 when I first bought the rights, when I was head of production at Golden Harvest. That's how far I go back with the franchise. I think Kevin goes back to being a fan back in the early '80s.\n\nMunroe: I found it like a year after its release, I found the first issue in a used comics bin and just loved it and that was great. I actually brought that issue one with me, to Peter [Laird], when we first met, thinking, worst case if I don't get the gig I'll at least get an autograph. So after we spent the day together, I slid the comic across the table and he signed it and said, \"Oh, cool. Number one.\" As we were driving back to the airport, I opened it up and there was a picture of Raph saying, \"Kevin, make a good movie or else!\" [laughs] I was like, 'That's awesome!'\n\nIGN: What are you hoping that people will get out of this update? People presumably already are familiar with the characters, but what's different about this film that's going to make them happy and give them something new to watch?\n\nMunroe: I think, as a movie, it's deeper. I think it runs just a little more believable. I'm not going to say realistic because I don't believe we are striving for reality, but I prefer 'believable reality.' I think the first movie does it really well in the sense that it's a very encompassing movie -- you just get in there and you are submerged in that world and it feels like they just actually lived in the sewers to me. Well, at least that's the memory of it. But in this one, I think it's especially important to concentrate on family. They are a family, but you never really got a strong family dynamic, like real tension between brothers and why brothers fight and the way brothers make up and stuff. So it's kind of nice to approach them as a family instead of just character archetypes, you know, the funny one, the smart one, the leader, all this other stuff and just go a shade deeper. I think for the older fans, you get that excitement that you remember, even though when you watch the old series it doesn't hold up the same way that you thought it did, but this is just trying to tap in to what you still remember in your head in terms of level of excitement, and then going a little bit further. We're trying to go a bit beyond the in-jokes for adults, the little wink-nudge to the mom and dad, there's just really no reason for it. There's a level of fun to this movie that will hopefully bring in the older audience to this film.\n\nIGN: Was there a thought to do another live action film before you decided on CGI?\n\nGray: No. I think going back to the first three movies, there was an escalation of budgets going up shooting live and the box office was going in the other direction. Today, I think, if you were making a live action Turtle movie with all the bells and whistles to compete with all the CG and special effects out there, this film would probably be around 150 million dollars to do it, to make it stand up on its own. I think when we started, when the company started looking at it we said, \"You know, through CG, we can do all of that at a greatly reduced price and still have the big scope of it which we couldn't possible afford.\" Our company is a small Hong Kong-listed company -- we couldn't afford a big $150 million budget. So, as CG -- because of our labor rates in Hong Kong are greatly reduced than here -- it made a lot more sense for us to push it as far as we could to give a big, big look to the film without having to go into the live action thing. So, I think that was the total motivation. Plus, we're a CG house, so that was the obvious answer -- let's go do it CG.\n\nIGN: Can you talk about the casting of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Kevin Smith and Chris Evans? And who are the voices of the Turtles?\n\nGray: First of all, we didn't want to touch the Turtles. Remember, we had Corey Feldman way back in the day and that was, kind of, the only person that was somewhat known. [But] we always felt that the Turtles don't require getting Adam Brody or someone like that to play Leonardo or whatever you wanted to do. If we could hold back the Turtles, then we could say, \"OK, if you require going with April or Casey -- or Max Winters in this case -- then we would be amenable to go out and look at actors.\" Although, we didn't really want to do that; we wanted to get just really great voices because our theory is, this is the kind of movie where we're not drawing those characters to look like someone. Sarah Michelle doesn't look like April. But we were somewhat encouraged by the studios to say, \"We need to get a little more firepower out there, so let's go get some so-called names to play the supporting actors in it.\" We said, \"Alright, as long as we don't touch the Turtles.\" And, of course, we had Mako to play Splinter, who, unfortunately passed away. But we got pretty much 90-percent of his voice in there. I think that, certainly Kevin can elaborate on this, it just didn't seem to feel that we were trying to make a movie that was based on star power because we felt that the Turtles transcend all of that. The Turtles are the Turtles and they are types and they are voices. So, I think that was the whole concentration, staying close to what people would perceive them as sounding back in the '90s.\n\nIGN: So who is voicing the Turtles?\n\nGray: Sarah Michelle Geller plays April, Chris Evans plays Casey Jones, Max Winters is Patrick Stewart, Ziyi Zhang is Karai, who's a new character from the film. We have a cameo from Kevin Smith who, just, really wanted to get into it. He came one day and stayed the whole day and just laid there on the floor and said, \"I want to do this!\" We're having narration from Lawrence Fishburne as well. So it's not a huge cast, but it is a good cast and it seems to work for this film. You know, you go overseas and it doesn't matter; we are going to dub in over 17 languages, so it's all about domestic [appeal]. Again, do these people go on Oprah and talk about it? I don't think so, to me it's almost gilding that lily -- you really don't need it. There are so many great voices in this business that are perfect, but then again, you are always in the position of, \"Well, if these people can go and help market the film then why not.\" It doesn't pull back, you see, as long as the turtles are unknown.\n\nIGN: How long did it take you guys to figure out what the look of the movie was going to be in terms of making sure that it was faithful to the comic book and yet achieved a degree of photorealism?\n\nMunroe: You head down a certain path of what you want it to look like. Our production designer comes from live action, a guy called Simon Murton, and he's worked on the past two Matrix films, Judge Dredd, he art directed The Crow, and he's got a pedigree in sort of that genre, cool, gritty realism. And we sort of knew from the start, it was funny to read Web traffic and stuff when we first announced Turtles and everybody sort of assumed they knew what it was going to look like. The whole idea was to have it not look like what people were going to assume right out of the gate. So we lit most of the film in black in white before we even added a stitch of color. We sort of went to [movies] like The Third Man and a lot of really good high-contrast black and white movies instead of just a Frank Miller look -- going back to when black and white film was such a great art form. So, it just sort of grew from there. We shot ourselves in the foot -- though in a good way -- when we started adding stuff like wet downs and specularity and little highlights and all these little details, and you realize why they are not in every little CG film: because it's really hard to do. Especially once we've got one sequence working really good with it, that really stuck out and we had to make the rest of the film like it. It was a little bit of an evolution, but the final look is pretty much what we intended from the start. I just didn't realize that we were going to be able to follow through quite so much. We've got a lot of production keys, just hundreds of them, and it always seems to me that's the 100-percent that you aim for and you think you're gonna hit 75 and you'll just have to make it work. But Hong Kong is just amazing with how they can actually implement and that they can actually implement whatever direction you give them. We wound up really close; were color timing last night until 3:30 in the morning and we were looking at the film and there are so many shots that look just like the paintings that we did. So we ended up pretty close and it's cool.\n\nIGN: How much of the film is already completed?\n\nMunroe: Well, we're done with animation. We're basically about 90-percent completed, I'd say. We're doing color timing right now, just on the visuals and doing just some last minute renders and some effects tweaking, so, that's the stuff that's coming across on people's laps across the Pacific. And from there we still have to color time it, and we're still doing sound effects. We're in the thick of post right now.\n\nIGN: How long did it take you from start to finish, your involvement?\n\nMunroe: I was involved in October 2004. I started on the story and the treatment process. We worked close with Peter Laird and just that alone took quite a few months, just to get the story down and working on how to implement things. We started actual design just a couple of months after that, but even just the couple of us that worked on the story, we had sketchbooks and we we're starting as we were talking about the story, just gave us something to do with our hands.\n\nIGN You discussed cutting it back for a PG rating. Will there be an extended or more aggressive cut on DVD?\n\nGray: I think that would be up to the studios -- you know, their DVD department -- if they wanted to push it a little bit. I'm not sure that would be constructive because it might upset some people to say, \"Well, these guys really cut this thing back.\" And we didn't really cut it back, to be honest; if [we presented] that cut that we really wanted to make, it would be PG-13. So we pulled back some of the things that were pointed out to us, some of the sharpness or some of the monsters were a little bit too over the top, so we pulled back in the effects and the music, so it's not going to really [be] that dramatic. But, again, if the thing does work, I don't know if the studio would allow us to do a 13 again. I certainly would like to do it and grow the franchise in that direction, but I'm not sure. They would look at it economically and say, \"Well, you're going to cut out a huge sector of our audience, so don't do it.\"\n\nIGN: To clarify, there are no nunchucks in the movie at all?\n\nGray: They are in the movie. Nunchucks are OK in the U.K. if they are in the belt or you don't see somebody get whacked with it, because what happens is -- and also with the throwing stars -- kids were going into metal shop in the U.K. and they were making these things and they were going to football matches and launching them into Manchester United. So they outlawed these things. So, and then, you get into the Scandinavian countries where violence is totally taboo and they don't want to know about it. Bruce Lee was banned for years and years in Scandinavia. There's levels around the world of censorship. But we are kind of victimized by the fact that we have three pictures out here, so the Motion Picture Association said to us, \"Well, you're rather special because the parents will say, 'Oh, the Turtles are benign, they're not going to be bad.'\" And some of the action that we have in it is pretty strong. So they said, \"You guys are walking on a tightrope here; pull back a little bit.\" But I think when we're pulling back, we'll do it more with effects and music; it won't be as dramatic, so it will still have power. Kevin and I were just scratching our heads and saying, \"You go look at Narnia and some of the movies out there and they are far more violent. But we come with that preconceived idea that parents will bring their kids to see this.\n\nStay tuned to IGN Movies for Part Two of this interview tomorrow!"
