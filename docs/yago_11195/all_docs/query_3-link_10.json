        "text": "There’s a great episode of “The Simpsons” in which Roger Myers Jr., a cartoon producer who runs the hit show “Itchy & Scratchy,” attempts to introduce a new character into the series to rejuvenate declining ratings. Poochie, the sunglasses-wearing, surfboard-carrying dog the studio comes up with, is “a dog with attitude,” explains one of the network executives pushing the idea. “He’s edgy, he’s in your face. You’ve heard the expression ‘let’s get busy’? Well, this is a dog who gets biz-zay. Consistently and thoroughly.”\n\nPoochie is a parody of a lot of different cartoon animals that have a focus-group-friendly “attitude,” from Sonic the Hedgehog to Tony the Tiger. But perhaps the prime examples of the archetype are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles — anthropomorphic reptiles with superpowers who live in the sewers beneath New York City, where they practice martial arts, chow down on pizza and spout hip 1980s catchphrases like “bodacious” and “cowabunga.”\n\nOriginally created in 1983 by the comic book artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were imagined as a kind of postmodern, semi-ironic sendup of the popular superhero comics of the era, particularly Marvel’s Daredevil and X-Men. With their punky, slang-heavy bite and flip, easygoing demeanor, they were the embodiment of a certain brand of savvy Gen X cool that peaked with the arrival of the ’90s: sarcastic and streetwise, borrowing elements from prevailing trends like surf culture and hip-hop.\n\nNinja Turtles felt extremely of the moment, capturing the zeitgeist in a way that felt irresistible to kids. What’s remarkable is that the moment has yet to come to an end. Since its inception, the franchise has repeatedly reinvented itself with new iterations: live-action features, after-school cartoons, video games, graphic novels. It’s now back on Netflix with a new feature-length animated film, “Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie.” The continual rejuvenation of a franchise that could have easily become just a pop-cultural relic begs an important question.\n\nHow have the Ninja Turtles remained popular for so long?\n\nWhen I was a kid in the early '90s, my most highly prized possession was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pizza Thrower, a battery-operated, football-size toy truck that made an unbelievable amount of noise and emitted a faint scent of burning rubber, and whose “motorized disc-fire action” I used mainly to terrorize my much-aggrieved little sister.\n\nThe Pizza Thrower was the crown jewel of an extensive collection of Turtles-related merchandise that covered my suburban bedroom, which included not only action figures and accessories but coloring books, costumes, lunchboxes and PEZ dispensers. When I was 5, I had Turtles bedsheets; when I turned 6, I had a Turtles-themed birthday party. I was, in short, Turtles-obsessed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
