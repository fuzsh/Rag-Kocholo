        "text": "Are you wondering about what went into the making of the new Ratchet and Clank movie? Is the film going to be true to the video game? Is there going to be a Ratchet and Clank sequel? We recently had the chance to chat with Ratchet and Clank movie director Kevin Munroe about this new film and how it was developed from the classic game. Here’s what he had to say!\n\nOn translating the video game into a good movie….\n\nTaking a beloved, classic video game and turning into a good movie is a challenge. While there are a lot of things to keep in mind Director Kevin Munroe shares what he thinks is the most important, “I think like at the end of the day, it’s all about just finding a good story. It doesn’t matter if it’s a game, or if it’s a movie, or a TV show. It’s all about just experiencing, even on your phones. You can just experience a story anywhere. And so ultimately, it came down to that.”\n\nOn getting the Ratchet and Clank movie from script to screen…\n\nThe first draft of the Ratchet and Clank movie was done by T.J Fixman who had worked in video games for many years. It was filled with lots of fantastic characters and stories and Munroe’s job was to find the story line to tell for the first film. “He had a fantastic first draft that was just filled with so many characters, and so much story.” said Munroe. “My job came in and was basically just to find the movie that we were telling within that, because there were all these other stories where we met his dad at one point in the script, which is a great story line, but that’s its own movie. Because the game has been around since 2002, the thing is, whenever you have something that’s so big – it’s almost like Lord of the Rings. You’ve got 10,000 stories that these guys have gone on and done and adventures, and characters. The question really becomes, ‘What’s the story you want to tell?’ We wanted to tell how Ratchet and Clank met and how they got to become the heroes of the galaxy. Then hopefully if everything goes well, we get to tell a whole bunch more stories.”\n\nOn casting the voices for Ratchet and Clank….\n\nWhen choosing the voices for the Ratchet and Clank film, director Kevin Munroe wanted to focus on the character and not the talent themselves. “You know, it’s funny – especially with animation, I don’t like to fall prey to the whole – ‘we need to get a name actor in there’. To me, it’s always just about the character. And so sometimes it’s worked out really well. Whenever we did the Ninja Turtle movie, in 2007, it’s specifically with that, and also because James Arnold Taylor was my Leonardo in that, and James is Ratchet here, which is a crazy coincidence. But it was always about the character. It was never about like, ‘Can we get Brad Pitt to come do the voice of Leonardo’ or something – because it was always about, that character’s in there, so you need to have somebody who reflects that character.\n\nSo it was very simple when it came to the characters that were already in the franchise, like Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious. And when it came to these new characters, what was great is that we just sort of created a character type.\n\nEven though everybody likes to get really good names on the poster (and we have fantastic names on this poster) at the same time, it was always about – do they service the character? Because I just would not want to hear Sly doing the voice of a meek little child or something, as an example. So what was great is everybody came along, and they just they took the character from there, and owned it, and sort of gave it their own twist, and developed it. And so it was great. So in short, it was always about the character to me, and sort of finding the character, and never casting the name. But we lucked out, and we got both.”\n\nOn the Ratchet and Clank soundtrack….\n\nMunroe credits the fun and funky Ratchet and Clank soundtrack to composer Evan Wise. “The score was great, because Evan Wise is the composer. It was his first film, I think, that he had fully composed and it was fantastic,” said Munroe. “To me, it’s never about experience. It’s always about do you want it do you have something to say? The best part was that Evan did, which was really great. He had been working for years composing stuff, but to be able to give him an entire film was a crazy journey because the movie has so many elements in it, in terms of comedy, and action. You need something that sort of ties everything together, and to me, it was the music was the chance to really do that.\n\nIt was great because he hit some parts that were really great, driving action, and other parts that were, just sort of had that ambling kind of heart. And then at the same time, he really worked in this fun thing, where it was almost like a Carl Stalling Looney Toons kind of vibe, where we’d have a joke, and then the score would go like, do-do-do-do. You know it’s funny, right. But there is something about it. There’s so few movies that you could get away with that, and definitely none of the big studio sort of animated films like that. So I think what was fun with this is that we sort of have an advantage with Ratchet, where you can give those sort of nods and to do them musically great.”\n\nOn Keeping the Ratchet and Clank Film True to The Game for Fans….\n\nMunroe has been surprised at the support rallied around the film by the fans of the game. “Ratchet fans have been so supportive, which is crazy. So I’m sort of not used to that energy. It’s been an incredible fan base to work with. So really, the biggest challenge is that games are such a user driven way of ingesting a story, or entertainment. It’s like comic books. You control how fast you flip. You control how much you stare at a panel. So you’re really directing it whenever you’re doing that. And so when you play the video games, it’s pretty much the same thing.\n\nSo my notion any time you do an adaptation like that, is that you have to find the tone of what works for the people who love it. Then your job is to then translate that love into another medium. You try to take what people love about that and stay true to that. So it has to be less about the details, and more about the feeling, and more about the tone because eventually it has to become a movie. I think we really kind of threaded the needle with this one.”\n\nMunroe shared about the great balance his team had with Insomniac Games and the shared vision of the film. “It was a great balance because Insomniac knew where we wanted to go with it. Tonally, they knew exactly where it needed to be. It was just about supporting it. To me, it was all about not reinventing the things that already worked. You’re looking to a picture of it. Why would I even have the audacity to go in there and say, “The movie should look differently than what those awesome games look like. Let’s just make it look like a movie version of it. That’s the only thing I can bring to the table.” But ultimately that the core of what’s there, I think. So it I think it gives smart producers and smart studios a chance to get a really unique vision on screen.”\n\nOn the Family Friendly Humor in Ratchet and Clank…..\n\nAs a parent, one of my pet peeves is when children’s movies add adult humor. I loved that Ratchet and Clank was suitable for all audiences and still funny for all ages, both kids and adults alike. When asked if he received any push back to add racier humor or inappropriate jokes, director Kevin Munroe laughed and said “Not other than kick some asteroid.” He elaborated.\n\n“The best part is that the film’s humor is always really true to what Ratchet and Clank is. And they’ve always had it. Some of them are super cheeky, like ‘up your arsenal’ like some of the video games that they’ve done. But they’ve never done a nod to parents. The Ratchet and Clank people who created that, they did those puns for the people who consumed it. It wasn’t for the parents of the people who consumed it. So yeah, you can, of course, have a PG13 Ratchet movie. I don’t know if you need it, though. And so a lot of times it was just staying true to what Insomniac had already done, and not screwing it up.”\n\n(Just in case you were wondering if Ratchet and Clank is safe and appropriate for your little space rangers, the answer is definitely yes. It is rated PG and has some great laugh out loud humor that definitely kicks asteroid.)\n\nOn what he wants viewers to take away from Ratchet and Clank….\n\nWhen asked about what messages he wants audiences to take home after viewing the new Ratchet and Clank movie, director Kevin Munroe admits there are many. If he had to pick just one, he says, “I think it’s the message of not just following your dreams, but finding your dream. A lot of time, life will make you think that you’re supposed to be dreaming about something else. If you just listen to yourself, and know the things that make you happy, and know what you can do to make the world a better place, that’s what your dream should be. Ratchet learns it’s not the big things, just the right things.”\n\nOn possible Ratchet and Clank movie sequels\n\nIs there going to be a Ratchet and Clank movie sequel? While film director Kevin Munroe wouldn’t confirm, he did say that the story of our heroes isn’t over. I think there’s a lot of themes with where Ratchet comes from and in terms of his origins,” said Munroe. “Now that Ratchet joined the Rangers, and characters like Cora gave him such a hard time and really made him earn his place in the ranks. I think there’s so many more adventures they could go on.”\n\nWatch for my review and additional exclusive cast interviews and about the RATCHET & CLANK film coming soon!\n\nRATCHET & CLANK releases nationwide from Gramercy Pictures on April 29, 2016.\n\nFollow the film on social:\n\nOfficial Site I Facebook I Twitter I Instagram\n\n#RatchetandClank\n\nDisclosure: Two Kids and a Coupon traveled all expenses paid to Los Angeles for purposes of covering this film.
