        "text": "BELTON, Texas (KWTX) - Bell County’s eighth annual comic con saw large crowds, in part due to the celebrity guests from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were a big part of the convention. Several actors from the 1990 film were in attendance and spoke to fans about their experience participating in the original film.\n\nA fan of the franchise, Wesley Lyons, said meeting the film’s co-creator, Kevin Eastman, was the highlight of the convention.\n\n“It was really surreal,” Lyons said. “Growing up with the turtles and then meeting the man that helped create them. He’s so humble and so nice. Being in costume and everything just makes the whole thing surreal.”\n\nMany attendees dressed in costumes representing characters from various media they enjoy. Attendee Grace Frazier said her costume was a tribute to the late Minecraft Youtuber known as “Technoblade.”\n\n“It’s a great form of self-expression,” Frazier said. “I love being like yeah this is what means a lot to me. This is what made me who I am.”\n\nBell County Comic Con is the largest comic con in Central Texas. Scooby Doo voice actor, Scott Innes, said it is because Bell County Comic Con focuses on family attendance.\n\n“I do so many comic cons across the country where it’s really more of the older side,” Innes said. “But here you look around and there’s kids, they’re everywhere. And parents and grandmas and grandpas. They’re having a great time.”\n\nEvent organizers said many of the celebrity guests in attendance were invited to return next year."
