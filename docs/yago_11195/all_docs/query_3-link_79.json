        "text": "Four turtles named for Renaissance artists—Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello, and Leonardo—became one of the most popular fads of the late 1980s and early ’90s. The pizza-loving, slang-talking, human-sized turtles were born as cartoon characters in 1983. Their popularity among children around the world has continued into the 21st century with the release of their movies.\n\nCartoonists Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman of Northampton, Mass., created the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) as a black-and-white comic strip series. According to the pair’s original story, the turtles were ordinary reptiles living in New York City until they accidentally fell into a pool of radioactive sludge and came out with the size and speech of people. A mutated rat named Splinter taught them ninja-fighting techniques and morals that he had learned from his Japanese master. The four turtles lived in New York sewers, talked California “surferspeak,” ate great amounts of pizza, and became experts in martial arts. The TMNT comic book became such a success that in 1987 the four reptiles also became the subjects of a line of toys and of a syndicated television cartoon show. Although at times the cartoon show revamped its characters and plot lines and was put on hiatus, overall it has been broadcasting for more than 15 years.\n\nThe first turtle film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, appeared in theaters in 1990. Rather than a cartoon, it was a live-action film featuring four actors in foam-rubber turtle suits (designed by Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets) battling an armored villain called Shredder. The sequels were subtitled The Secret of the Ooze (1991) and Turtles in Time (1993). TMNT (2007), which was the first of the turtle movies to use animation, reunited the four turtles to fight a new villain."
