Each film will center around a villain in the franchise, with the projects being developed by Nickelodeon Animation for streaming exclusively released on Paramount+.[75]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2024, at CinemaCon, Paramount announced that an R-rated film adaptation of the comic miniseries The Last Ronin is in development.[76][77] Walter Hamada will produce the movie through his 18hz Productions company while Tyler Burton Smith will write the script.[77]\n\nCanceled projects\n\n[edit]\n\nUntitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III sequel\n\n[edit]\n\nKevin Eastman was working on a fourth Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film between 1995 and 1997 titled TMNT 4: The Next Mutation or TMNT 4: The Foot Walks Again. In 2012, Heritage Auctions published concept arts showing a fifth turtle named Kirby, but also featured are Fang, Shredder, Spyder, Nano Spyder, Super Shredder, Casey, Talbot, Lawson, Bugman and \"Evil April\". Peter Laird showed some concept art of the Turtles and Splinter on his blog.[78][79][80][81][82] The main concept behind the film would have the turtles undergo a second mutation due to the mutagen in the heroes' bloodstream beginning to change with age and giving them new abilities and new problems. Also, the film would revolve around the return of the Shredder and proceeded to rebuild the Foot empire.\n\nTMNT sequels\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007 Kevin Munroe stated that he would like to direct a possible sequel to TMNT, possibly involving the return of the Shredder.[83] Munroe planned a trilogy. TMNT 2 would have loosely adapted the Turtles’ 13-part comic book saga \"City At War\". Michelangelo would have felt rejected and joined the Foot Clan, while the Turtles would have traveled to Japan and would have crossed paths with Karai and Shredder. TMNT 3 would have featured the Triceratons as well as the Technodrome’s arrival from Dimension X. Munroe wanted Michael Clarke Duncan to voice the Triceraton's leader, Commander Mozar.[84] In an interview, Peter Laird stated he was interested in the idea of having the next film be a live-action and CGI hybrid film, with the Turtles rendered in CGI and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Evans reprising their TMNT roles in live-action.[85]\n\nJohn Fusco-written film\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late April 2009, a new live-action film was announced to be in the works for a 2011 release. Mirage Studios was partnering with producers Scott Mednick and Galen Walker, with Peter Laird, Gary Richardson, Frederick Fierst, Eric Crown as executive producers, and 4Kids Entertainment handling the film's merchandising with Lightbox Productions, LLC. funding the project.[86] The film would have used animatronic suits whose facial expressions would be digitally enhanced in post-production.[84] It was stated that the story would focus on the Turtles origin.[87] A few months later, an open casting call was made for extras to play as members of the Foot Clan with Ernie Reyes, Jr. as an acting judge.[88] \"Ninja Turtles\" co-creator Peter Laird said \"there were a lot of positive feelings about a Batman Begins-style reboot,[89] while producer Galen Walker said the film would be headed in a darker direction.[90] In July the same year, John Fusco was hired to be the film's writer.[91] His version was to be inspired by the original dark and gritty black and white comics that Eastman created with Peter Laird, but Paramount wasn't on board. Kevin Eastman described the script as being \"too edgy for what Paramount wanted\". Laird revealed the film would have been a direct sequel to the 1990 film while ignoring its earlier sequels.[92] In October, Viacom's subsidiary network Nickelodeon had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property for $9.75 million, thus terminating all deals with 4Kids and Time Warner.[93][94][95]\n\nOut of the Shadows sequel\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2014, Noel Fisher stated in an interview that he and the other Turtle actors had signed on for three films.[96] Megan Fox had also signed on for three films.[97] In May 2016, Tyler Perry said that if a third film was made, his character, Baxter Stockman, would probably mutate into his fly form during the movie.[98] Pete Ploszek also expressed his interests in reprising his role in a third film as Leonardo.[99] In October the same year, in light of the second film's financial failure, producer Andrew Form indicated that a third film was unlikely.[8]"
