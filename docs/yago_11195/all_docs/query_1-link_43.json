        "text": "Grading the Franchise is a recurring feature at Cinecaps Digest where I review an entire film series. Today, it’s the juvenile action-comedy-fantasy Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.\n\nI’ll be honest up front: I’ve never read the TMNT comic books and only occasionally peeked in on the original cartoon series. Before the release of the first movie adaptation, I knew the characters/mythology mostly through their ubiquitous presence in kiddie pop culture (I was a kid then, so it was hard to miss), and because I’d played a couple of the video games. I knew the basics, but even as a young’un, I found their antics to be too silly and stupid on average (I’ve heard that the original comics were darker and more subversive than the youth-friendly incarnation popularized on the small screen and toy stores, but again, I profess my ignorance on that count). In summary, the turtles are not my thing, so keep that in mind before getting to the reviews.\n\nHowever, I’m firmly in the camp where a movie based on a popular source material (or from a long-running franchise) can insert as much fan service as it wants, but if it leaves outsiders cold, it is a failure as a film. I’m not talking about, say, a horror movie alienating members of the audience who hate being scared or dislike supernatural storytelling or something along those lines. I’m referring to movies aimed only at people who go in with advanced knowledge (beyond mere familiarity with its predecessors in the case of sequels) and a predisposition toward embracing the product. This means that even if I’d been on board with everything related to those heroes-in-a-half-shell before tuning in to one of the movies, that wouldn’t have changed the fact that they’re all bad films (some, just plain execrable). They’re not well-made, acted, written, or directed, and the production values and action scenes are, to put it as kindly as possible, “uneven.” Even if they were completely faithful—which I can’t attest—it’s consistently bad storytelling and filmmaking and it rarely even works as eye candy since the movies are mostly ugly, too (but at least they’re ugly in different ways depending on which of the three phases the series was currently in—the early 90s live action pics, the animated film from the 00s, or the CGI-heavy reboots from the 10s).\n\nAnd speaking of those different phases, I’m nothing if not inconsistent. With the Spider-Man franchise, I decided to grade the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films together, but left out the MCU adventures and that animated “Spider-verse” story (for reasons explained at the time). With the Halloween franchise, I left out the two Rob Zombie movies but included the 2018 remake and the second sequel that had nothing to do with Michael Myers (again, for reasons explained at the time). And with the Alien, Predator, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Friday the 13th franchises, I never included the crossover “versus” movies in any of them. But with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I’m including every feature film there is. Gripe if you like, but any series of movies that involves large, anthropomorphic turtles living in the sewers of New York City kicking butt (but absolutely not behaving like “ninjas”) and scarfing down pizza has no room for logic. If they can be mutants, so can this Grading the Franchise entry.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)\n\nDirected by Steve Barron. Starring Judith Hoag, Elias Koteas, Michael Turney, Jay Patterson, James Saito, Toshishiro Obata, Raymond Serra, (voices) Josh Pais, Corey Feldman, Robbie Rist, Brian Tochi, Kevin Clash. [PG]\n\nFirst there were comic books, then came a toy line, an animated television show, and video games, and now the heroes-in-a-half-shell get a live-action movie adaptation; for better or worse, it’s about what one would expect. The sewer-dwelling, pizza-feasting, slang-spouting mutant turtles (and their wise rat ninja master, Splinter) are brought to life by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, and while they are technically impressive creations, their stylized design simply doesn’t work in the real world the way it did in ink and paint—Raphael (Pais) going incognito aboveground in a trenchcoat is one of the silliest things this very silly movie trots out. Complaints about weak plotting and dialogue are unnecessary—it ain’t that kind of movie—but even the fighting and wisecracking gets tiresome pretty quick. Strictly kids’ stuff…maybe they’ll like it. A young Sam Rockwell has a small role as a thug working with the baddies; look fast for dialogue-free appearances from Skeet Ulrich and Scott Wolf, too. Followed by two direct sequels, plus an animated movie and a couple of “reboot” chapters.\n\n31/100\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991)\n\nDirected by Michael Pressman. Starring Paige Turco, Ernie Reyes Jr., David Warner, François Chau, Toshishiro Obata, Raymond Serra, (voices) Adam Carl, Robbie Rist, Laurie Faso, Brian Tochi, Kevin Clash, David McCharen. [PG]\n\nThe turtles are back, and so is Shredder, who gets his bladed hands on a scientist (Warner) and the same mutagen “ooze” that spawned the cowabunga crew and their whiskery sensei years earlier. Rubber-suited muggery, instantly-outdated slang, genteel martial arts, and gratuitous Vanilla Ice cameos ensue. Juvenile junk that’s borderline insulting to fans—the turtles fail to exhibit distinct personalities and don’t even attack enemies with their weapons anymore! (But there’s still a place for…“combat cold cuts!”) Unsuitable for anyone over the age of eleven (unless their shoe size exceeds their IQ). And remember: “Go, ninja, go, ninja, go!” Dedicated to the memory of Jim Henson.\n\n15/100\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (1993)\n\nDirected by Stuart Gillard. Starring Paige Turco, Stuart Wilson, Elias Koteas, Sab Shimono, Henry Hayashi, Vivian Wu, John Aylward, (voices) Robbie Rist, Corey Feldman, Brian Tochi, Tim Kelleher, James Murray. [PG]\n\nApril O’Neil purchases a magical Japanese scepter at a flea market, and when she tries to give it to Splinter as a gift, it whisks the turtles away to feudal Japan (don’t you hate when that happens?). There, the heroes-in-a-half-shell get involved in family squabbles between a corrupted warlord (Shimono) and his rebel daughter (Wu), plus an English arms dealer (Wilson) just in it for the gold. A remarkably dull third chapter in the sewer-logged saga, which no longer uses Jim Henson’s Creature Shop for their puppets and creature effects (and, boy, does it show); though not quite as crassly immature as the last outing, it’s still kiddie crock and nothing more, heavy on moralizing and light on logic—how lucky was it that apparently all of the 17th-century Japanese characters also speak English? After sitting the last movie out, Koteas returns in a dual role, one of them being a reprisal of Casey Jones…who spends the entire movie in the present day “babysitting” a bunch of ancient warriors who came through the “time portal” in the opposite direction and get a taste for junk food and karaoke; Feldman also returns to voice Donatello once more. Sometimes shown as having the subtitle Turtles in Time, which refers to one of the franchise’s arcade games. The further adventures of the turtle ninjas would continue over a decade later in animated form: TMNT.\n\n19/100\n\nTMNT (2007)\n\nDirected by Kevin Munroe. Starring (voices) Nolan North, James Arnold Taylor, Chris Evans, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mako, Mitchell Whitfield, Zhang Ziyi, Mikey Kelley, Patrick Stewart, Kevin Michael Richardson. [PG]\n\nMundane animated adventure for the heroes-in-a-half-shell pits the foursome against immortal monsters, stone generals, and a businessman-with-a-secret (voiced by Stewart); no extra slice of pizza for guessing what that secret could possibly be. The obstacle of unconvincing makeup/suits making the turtles look silly in the real world has been removed by embracing computer graphics in the film’s entirety, but the (voice) acting and writing have not improved much since the early-90s outings. Even though the characters are drafted with exaggerated, cartoonish features, the script takes itself too seriously without trying anything original or narratively ambitious (when it does attempt humor, mostly through Michelangelo and Donatello’s dialogue, it almost always lands with a thud). Aside from the mediocre figure design, however, the animation is pretty decent, especially in the city backgrounds and motion rendering, making it all look like a very high-quality television program; still, it falls well short of the mid-range bar for feature film animation. April (Gellar), no longer a news reporter, is greatly underused, as are half the Turtle team! How can a movie involving mutated turtles with ninja skills and ancient monsters feel so…ordinary?\n\n36/100\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)\n\nDirected by Jonathan Liebesman. Starring Megan Fox, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, Tohoru Masamune, Minae Noji, Whoopi Goldberg, Abby Elliott, Taran Killam, (voices) Johnny Knoxville, Noel Fisher, Alan Ritchson, Jeremy Howard, Tony Shalhoub. [PG-13]\n\nLive-action reboot of the venerable franchise (created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird) about a quartet of, well, the title gives it away. Here, they’re plugged into the been-there-done-that scenario of reporter April O’Neil (a badly miscast Fox) investigating strange goings-on involving the rise of a criminal organization called the Foot Clan and the mysterious, pizza-loving vigilantes trying to stop them. Overblown and overproduced action/effects extravaganza is devoid of wit and charm; any occasional clever idea, gadget or gimmick is steamrolled by garish photography, whiplash editing, and bleary direction. Never really had a chance to begin with, thanks to the truly ghastly creature/character design of the anthropomorphic turtles, but an abundance of chaotic action scenes (as cartoonish as anything from the TV show) and tiresome banter/wisecracks make it downright painful to endure at times. Should surprise no one when Michael Bay’s name shows up as one of the producers.\n\n24/100\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016)\n\nDirected by Dave Green. Starring Megan Fox, Stephen Amell, Will Arnett, Tyler Perry, Gary Anthony Williams, Stephen Farrelly, Brian Tee, Brittany Ishibashi, Dean Winters, (voices) Jeremy Howard, Noel Fisher, Alan Ritchson, Pete Ploszek, Tony Shalhoub, Brad Garrett. [PG-13]\n\nThe titular turtles spring back into action after Shredder (Tee) breaks out of custody—who saw that coming?—and is teleported to another dimension where he makes a deal with an alien-brain-monster called Krang to go on a few fetch quests to open up a dimensional portal so that…okay, if you’ve seen The Avengers, you know where this is going. A slight improvement over the last overblown superhero-action-fantasy outing, thanks to a little less of the grating banter among the juvenile heroes-in-a-half-shell and a little more clarity in the direction/editing (though one early scene is such visual chaos that it make it look like the sewers lead directly to the roof of Madison Square Garden, which may explain why the Knicks so frequently reek of manure)…but it’s still very stupid and fails to offer anything worth remembering or revisiting. Panders frequently to fans of the animated series, which serves as a reminder that some things may work okay in a kid’s cartoon, but not necessarily in a live-action (er, CGI-rendered) setting—Krang is aptly-described by one of the turtles as a talking wad of chewing gum, and even if Bebop and Rocksteady weren’t hugely obnoxious antagonists, they still look completely absurd. The character assassination of reporter April O’Neil keeps rolling on as Megan Fox is given the assignment of changing into a sexy schoolgirl outfit and…that’s about it.\n\n28/100\n\nCheck back in tomorrow for the next daily update!"
