        "text": "Pizza and films: the most famous cinema and TV series' scenes\n\nIs pizza the most famous made in Italy food in the world? Judging by its presence on large and small screens: yes, it is. Films, TV series, cartoons, and great cinema classics have paid tribute to the par excellence Italian traditional dish in countless variations, not always consistent with the original, but we can safely say that the lucky tasters were quite satisfied.\n\nHow many movie scenes starring pizza can you remember?\n\nIf you are looking for famous anecdotes and gags about pizza in movies, you are in the right place. Here's our list of 10 famous films and TV series' sequences that have made history, and that maybe will make you crave for pizza (in this case, call Fra Diavolo's pizza delivery service for help).\n\nPizza in movies: 10 famous titles and scenes\n\nThe perfect evening: a pizza, your sofa, a film! Here are some ideas for choosing which movie to watch while having a pizza!\n\nThe gold of Naples (Vittorio De Sica)\n\nSophia Loren is the queen of fried pizza! In depicting the truthfulness of the Neapolitan capital, the great Italian director entrusts Sophia Loren with the preparation of that delicious fried pizza that can still be ordered today at Starita in Materdei. In the episode \"Pizza on credit\", there is all of Vittorio De Sica's love for Naples and its jewel to taste. A classic.\n\nEat Pray Love (Ryan Murphy)\n\nJulia Roberts, pizza, and a film that made history: in Eat, Pray, Love, the most beautiful smile in Hollywood, confesses her love affair with pizza during her not-only-existential journey towards happiness. The scene with Julia Roberts in the Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples is perhaps the most successful tribute to that philosophy of life called \"pizza\".\n\nManatthan (Woody Allen)\n\nPizza is not the star in Italian movies: in Manhattan, Woody Allen's masterpiece, the absence of an ingredient from his favorite pizza, succeeds in overshadowing the uncertain fate of the relationship with Tracy, played by Mariel Hemingway. If we consider that the missing ingredient is coconut, we understand the misplaced irony and genius of Woody Allen.\n\nParasite (Bong Joon-ho)\n\nIn director Bong Joon-ho's award-winning South Korean film Parasite, pizza is the only food and source of income for the unfortunate and ambivalent leading family. In the damp basement where they live, the Kims fold the cartons for the Dongjak-gu pizzeria, which will mark the starting point of their tragic social rise. An Oscar-winning pizza!\n\nSpiderman (Sam Raimi)\n\nSpiderman, the acrobatic superhero, pays his tuition by delivering pizzas, and, for faster service, he resorts to jump between New York's skyscrapers, thanks to his super cobwebs. A hilarious and spectacular sequence directed by Sam Raimi, master of horror movies, unexpectedly perfect in directing the first episode of the series of films dedicated to kids' most loved superhero.\n\nDeadpool (Tim Miller)\n\nAn anti-hero can only order an anti-pizza! In the film directed by Tim Miller, the most undisciplined and foul-mouthed character in the Marvel comics, sneaks into the apartment of the criminal on duty and, while waiting for him to come back home, orders and tastes a delicious pineapple and olive pizza, making sure that the crust is not burnt. If it's all right by him...\n\nBack to the future II (Robert Zemeckis)\n\nHow were we going to make pizza in 2015? According to Robert Zemeckis, we would have inserted some discs in special ovens and extracted steaming maxi-sized pizzas. Today we can say that things did not turn out to be that way. But many viewers were startled to watch the imaginative hypotheses about the future of one of the most popular film sagas of the 80s and 90s.\n\nNightmare 4 (Renny Harlin)\n\nPizza also stars in Freddy Krueger's horror splatter film in the fourth episode of Nightmare, directed by Renny Harlin. Before the eyes of a terrified Alice (Lisa Wilcox), Freddy tastes a - according to him - delicious pizza topped with the screaming heads of some unfortunate victims. This is really a matter of personal taste! (Ok, we don't serve that pizza: don't ask.)\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Kevin Munroe)\n\nPizza is also in the 2007 animated film with the funny mutant turtles, born as a comic from the pencils of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. Ninja Turtles gleefully feast on their only food: pizza. Perhaps it is a tribute to the four characters' names, all inspired by Italian Renaissance artists: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo.\n\nBreaking Bad (Vince Gilligan)"
