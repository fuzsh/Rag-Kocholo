        "text": "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (abbreviated as TMNT) is a comic book series by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. As the title states, TMNT focuses on 4 anthropomorphic turtles trained by their sensei who happens to be a mutant rat. The gang lives under the sewers of NYC which is filled with criminal activity, mutated monsters, and aliens trying to take over the world while at the same time keeping themselves hidden from human society from potentially trying to experiment on them. Only the four brothers: Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo can put an end to the terror. TMNT is published by Mirage Studios and was expanded into a cartoon series as well as films, video games, and merchandise.\n\nIn 2009, Peter Laird sold the turtles along with the comic studio to Nickelodeon.\n\nPilot[]\n\n:Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)\n\nComic book authors Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird met in Massachusetts and began working on illustrations together. In 1983, Laird invited Eastman to move in with him in Dover, New Hampshire (USA).[1] That November, Eastman drew a masked turtle standing on its hind legs armed with nunchucks.[2] Laird added the words \"teenage mutant\".[1] The concept parodied several elements popular in superhero comics of the time: the mutants of Uncanny X-Men, the teenagers of New Teen Titans and the ninjas of Daredevil, combined with the comic tradition of funny animals such as Howard the Duck.[3]\n\nDeveloping the concept into a comic book, Eastman and Laird considered giving the turtles Japanese names, but instead named them Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo after the Italian Renaissance artists. Laird said the names \"felt just quirky enough to fit the concept\".[2] They developed a backstory referencing further elements of Daredevil: whereas Daredevil gains his superpowers through exposure to radioactive material, the turtles mutate into humanoid heroes; the Turtles' sensei, Splinter, is a play on Daredevil's sensei, Stick.[3]\n\nIn March 1984, Eastman and Laird founded a comic book company, Mirage Studios, in their home.[2] Using money from a tax refund and a loan from Eastman's uncle, they printed copies of first issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and advertised it in Comics Buyer's Guide Magazine.[2] This attracted the interest of comic distributors, and all 3,000 copies were sold in a few weeks.[2] Sales of further issues continued to climb.[2]\n\nAnimated TV shows[]\n\nFirst animated series (1987–1996)[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nWhen little-known Playmates Toys was approached about producing a TMNT action figure line, they were cautious of the risk and requested that a television deal be acquired first.[4][5] On December 28, 1987, the TMNT's first cartoon series began, starting as a five-part miniseries and becoming a regular Saturday-morning syndicated series on October 1, 1988, with 13 more episodes. The series was produced by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson.[6]\n\nThe show is more lighthearted than the comics. Here, the Turtles are portrayed as four funny but serious superheroes that fight the forces of evil from their sewer hideout. They love pizza and put weird toppings on it. They make their first appearance in masks color-coded to each turtle, where previously they had all worn red.[7] The turtles were also well known for their use of idiomatic expressions characteristic of the surfer lingo of the time, especially by Michelangelo. Words and phrases included \"bummer\", \"dude\", \"bogus\", \"radical\", \"far-out\", \"tubuloso\", \"bodacious\", and possibly the most recognized, \"cowabunga,\" a nonsense expression first coined by The Howdy Doody Show's Chief Thunderthud.[8]\n\nThe cast included new and different characters, such as Bebop and Rocksteady and the Neutrinos. Original characters such as Splinter, Shredder, and the Foot Soldiers stayed true to the comics in appearance and alignment only. Instead of being Hamato Yoshi's mutated pet rat, Splinter was a mutated Hamato himself. The Foot Soldiers changed from human ninjas to an endless supply of robotic grunts, allowing large numbers of them to be destroyed without anyone dying (this was a very important decision in terms of the show's child audience; excessive violence would have alienated parents of children, the show's target demographic). Krang, one of the series' most memorable villains, was inspired by the design of the Utrom, a benign alien race from the Mirage comics. The animated Krang, however, was instead an evil warlord from Dimension X. Baxter Stockman, whose race was changed from black to white, was rewritten as a shy and meek lackey to Shredder, later mutating into an anthropomorphic housefly. During the final two seasons of the show, the lead villain switched to Lord Dregg, an evil alien overlord bent on world conquest by trying to distract the public into believing that the Turtles were the enemy instead of himself.\n\nStarting on September 25, 1989, the series was expanded to weekdays and it had 47 more episodes for the new season. There were 28 new syndicated episodes for season 4 and only 13 of those episodes aired in 1990. The \"European Vacation\" episodes were not seen in the United States until USA Network started showing reruns in late 1993 and the \"Awesome Easter\" episodes were not seen until 1991. These episodes were delayed because of animation or scheduling problems.[9] On April 21, 1990, a drug-prevention television special was broadcast on ABC, NBC, and CBS named Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue that featured some of the most popular cartoons at the time; representing TMNT was Michelangelo, voiced by Townsend Coleman.\n\nStarting on September 8, 1990 (with a different opening sequence), the show began its run on CBS. The CBS weekend edition ran for a full hour until 1994, initially airing a few Saturday-exclusive episodes back-to-back. Also, a brief \"Turtle Tips\" segment aired between the two episodes, which served as public-service announcement about the environment or other issues. After 1994, the show was reduced to just a half-hour and only eight episodes per season were produced, grouped into a \"CBS Action Zone\" block that also featured WildC.A.T.s. and Skeleton Warriors, both of which were canceled after one season; though TMNTs retained their \"Action Zone\" introduction. The series ran until November 2, 1996, when it aired its final episode. Its enormous popularity gave rise to its numerous imitators, including the Battletoads, Cheetahmen, Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa, Road Rovers, Street Sharks, Extreme Dinosaurs, and Biker Mice from Mars. Currently, all 193 episodes are available on DVD and VHS.\n\nSecond animated series (2003–2009)[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)\n\nIn 2003, a new TMNT series produced by 4Kids Entertainment began airing on the \"FoxBox\" (later renamed \"4Kids TV\") programming block. It later moved to \"The CW4Kids\" block. The series was co-produced by Mirage Studios,[10] and Mirage owned one-third of the rights to the series. Mirage's significant stake in creative control resulted in a cartoon that hews more closely to the original comics, creating a darker and edgier feel than the 1987 cartoon, but still kid-friendly enough to be considered appropriate for children.\n\nThis series lasted until 2009, ending with a feature-length television movie titled Turtles Forever, which was produced in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the TMNTs franchise and featured the Turtles of the 2003 series teaming up with their counterparts from the 1987 series, and eventually are visited by the black and white comic versions of themselves in the final act. 4Kidstv.com featured all the episodes of the series, until September 2010, when Nickelodeon bought the series and air the series occasionally on Nicktoons and Nickelodeon normally during TMNTs marathons.\n\nThird animated series (2012–2017)[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)\n\nNickelodeon acquired the global rights to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from the Mirage Group and 4Kids Entertainment, Inc. and announced a new CGI-animated TMNT television series.[11][12][13] The 2012 version is characterized by anime-like iconography and emphasis on mutagen continuing to wreak havoc on the everyday lives of the Turtles and their enemies; in addition, the tone of this version is similar to the original series, but also features a handful of serious episodes as well. The series ran for five seasons. The series was headed by Ciro Nieli, creator of Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!.\n\nFourth animated series (2018–2020)[]\n\nMain article: Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nNickelodeon made a new 2D animated series based on the franchise, which appeared in September 2018. This version is characterized by lighter humor, and also had some anime iconography.[14][15]\n\nFifth animated series (2024)[]\n\nMain article: Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nIn July 2023, it was reported that Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a two-season 2D animated television series spin-off of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem film, had been greenlit for Paramount+. Production company Point Grey, which produced the film, will produce the series.[16] The series will premiere in Q3 2024.[17]\n\nFilms[]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)\n\nA new feature film, rebooting the film franchise, was originally scheduled to be released in December 2013 as part of the acquisition of the franchise by Viacom. It was announced on May 27, 2010, that Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company had landed the rights to the new film. The film is a co-production between Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies.[18] The first film was directed by Jonathan Liebesman and stars Megan Fox as April O'Neil, Will Arnett, William Fichtner, and features motion capture CGI for the Turtles and Splinter, the film was released on August 8, 2014.[19] The film became a box office success.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\n\nA sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows was announced for June 3, 2016 with Dave Green directing.[20][21] The sequel was announced on August 10, 2014, two days after the first film was released. The original cast (with the exception of Johnny Knoxville) returns with Stephen Amell, Brian Tee, Tyler Perry, and Gary Anthony Williams joining as Casey Jones, Shredder, Baxter Stockman, and Bebop respectively.[22][23][24] WWE wrestler Sheamus was later confirmed to portray Rocksteady.[25]\n\nRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie[]\n\nMain article: Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie\n\nOn February 5, 2019, it was announced that a feature film based on the series was in production for Netflix, along with another Nickelodeon TV series, The Loud House. Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie will be about the turtles saving the world from the Krang.[26] The film had been slated to be released in 2021,[27] but on August 27, 2021, the film was announced to be pushed back to 2022 due to production not being completed.[28] Haley Joel Osment will be part of the voice cast.[29]\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nOn June 20, 2018, it was reported that Paramount Pictures will once again reboot the series with Bay, Fuller and Form returning to produce the film and Andrew Dodge writing the script.[30][31] Fuller and Form announced while at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards that production on the reboot is set to start in 2019.[32] However, in July 2019, TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman revealed that the film is still in development and believed that Paramount took the reactions to the 2014 and 2016 films \"to heart\", and that \"its going to be a next-level type of stuff\".[33] In August 2021. Colin Jost and his brother Casey were announced replacing Dodge as screenwriters.[34]\n\nOn February 5, 2019, Variety revealed that Nickelodeon is developing a film adaptation of the 2018 TV series Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is set to be released on Netflix.[35]\n\nOn June 30, 2020, another reboot film separate from the upcoming Bay live action movie was reported. It will be a CGI animated film, titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Next Chapter,[36] with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as producers operating through their Point Grey Pictures production company. It will be the second animated film in the franchise following 2007's TMNT. The film will be directed by The Mitchells vs. the Machines co-director Jeff Rowe with a script by Neighbors co-screenwriter Brendan O'Brien. Nickelodeon president Brian Robbins has described the project as a \"next-level reinvention of the property\".[37] The film is set to be released on August 11, 2023.[38][39]\n\nVideogames[]\n\n:Main article: List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games\n\nIn 2013, Activision released the downloadable game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, based on the 2012 TV series and developed by Red Fly Studio for the Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and Steam.[40]\n\nIn 2016, Activision and PlatinumGames developed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.

It is a side-scrolling beat 'em up based on the 1987 TV series and inspired by Turtles in Time.\n\nComics[]\n\nOriginal series (1984 – present)[]\n\n:Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)\n\nEastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles premiered in May 1984, at a comic book convention held at a local Sheraton Hotel in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. It was published by Mirage Studios in an oversized magazine-style format using black and white artwork on cheap newsprint, limited to a print run of 3,250 copies.[44] Through a clever media kit that included a press release in The Comics Journal No. 89 and a full-page ad placed in Comic Buyer's Guide #547, the public's interest was piqued and thus began the Turtle phenomenon. The small print runs made these early comics and trade magazines instant collector items, and within months, they were trading for over 50 times their cover price.[Citation needed]\n\nMirage also published a bimonthly companion book entitled Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, featuring art by Ryan Brown and Jim Lawson, which was designed to fill in the gaps of continuity in the TMNT universe. This put the original series and Tales in the same mainstream canon. The title's first volume was from 1987 to 1989, released in alternating months with the regular Eastman and Laird book. All seven issues of volume one have been collected in trade paperback form twice, and 25 issues of volume two have been collected in trades of five issues each.[Citation needed]\n\nAs the TMNT phenomenon proliferated to other media, Eastman and Laird found themselves administrating an international merchandising juggernaut. However, this prevented the two creators from participating in the day-to-day work of writing and illustrating a monthly comic book. So, many guest artists were invited to showcase their unique talents in the TMNT universe. The series lasted for 129 issues, spanning four separate volumes (having 62, 13, 23, and 32 issues in the four distinct volumes).[45]\n\nBetween 1984 and 1995, Mirage Studios published 75 regular issues, plus dozens of miniseries and other comics.[2] After the Image Comics series ended, Laird returned the Turtles comic to Mirage in 2001 and disregarded the Image storylines. By 2010, 31 new issues had been produced.[2]\n\nComic strip (1990 – 1997)[]\n\n:Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic strip)\n\nA daily comic strip written and illustrated by Dan Berger began in 1990. It featured an adventure story Monday through Friday and activity puzzles on weekends (with fan art appearing later). The comic strip was published in syndication until its cancellation in December 1996. At its highest point in popularity, it was published in over 250 newspapers.\n\nNew Animated Adventures/Amazing Adventures[]\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: New Animated Adventures and\n\nMain article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Amazing Adventures\n\nSimilar to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures series from Archie Comics, which spun-off from the original TV series, IDW Publishing released a spin-off comic title based on the 2012 cartoon called New Animated Adventures featuring original adventures, starting July 2013. The series was cancelled after 24 issues, and was succeeded by a revised story program entitled Amazing Adventures, which was launched in August 2015 and published until September 2017, with a total of fourteen regular issues, one special story guest-starring Carmelo Anthony, a three-issue story arch titled Robotanimals, and the crossover miniseries Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures.\n\nRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles[]\n\nMain article: Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic book)\n\nIDW published a comic book based on the series, beginning in July 2018.[46] The comics concluded with an introductory issue (#0), a five-issue main story and a Halloween Comicfest special. After a period of inactivity, it was continued with a three-issue story arc titled \"Sound Off!\" from July to September 2019.\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nAmong the first licensed products to feature the TMNT was a tabletop role-playing game titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness, published by Palladium Books in 1985, and featuring original comics and illustrations by Eastman and Laird. The game features a large list of animals, including elephants and sparrows, that are available as mutant player characters. Several more titles were in this genre, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures, Truckin' Turtles, Turtles Go Hollywood, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Guide to the Universe, and Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nIn 1986, Dark Horse Miniatures in Boise, Idaho, produced an attendant set of lead figurines; unlike later incarnations, the bandannas on the store's display set were painted all black before the multicolored versions were released to help younger readers distinguish between the four characters other than their weaponry. Palladium allowed the license to lapse in 2000, in part due to declining sales stemming from the \"kiddification\" of the animated and live-action incarnations to that point. However, Palladium's publisher, Kevin Siembieda, has indicated a potential willingness to revisit the license given the franchise's recent moves closer to its roots.[47]\n\nThe franchise generated merchandise sales of $175 million in 1988 and $350 million in 1989.[48] By 1994, it was the most merchandisable franchise, having generated a total revenue of $6 billion in merchandise sales up until then.[49]\n\nToys[]\n\n:Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures\n\nDuring the run of the 1987 TV series, Playmates Toys produced hundreds of TMNT action figures, along with vehicles, playsets, and accessories, becoming one of the top collectibles for children.[50] Staff artists at Northampton, Massachusetts-based Mirage Studios provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and creator credit can be found in the legal text printed on the back of the toy packaging. In addition, Playmates produced a series of TMNTs/Star Trek crossover figures, due to Playmates holding the Star Trek action-figure license at the time. Playmates employed many design groups to develop looks and styles for the toy line, including Bloom Design, White Design, Pangea, Robinson-Clarke, and McHale Design. The marketing vice president of Playmates, Karl Aaronian, was largely responsible for assembling the talented team of designers and writers, which in turn, helped germinate continued interest in the toy line.\n\nNever before in toy history did an action-figure line have such an impact for over two decades, generating billions of dollars in licensing revenue. The series was highly popular in the UK, where in the run-up to Christmas, the Army & Navy Store in London's Lewisham devoted its entire basement to everything Turtle, including games, videos, costumes, and other items. Playmates continued to produce TMNT action figures based on the 2003 animated series. The 2007 film TMNT also gave Playmates a new source from which to make figures, while National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced a series of high-quality action figures based on character designs from the original Mirage comics. In 2012, a new toy line and a new classic toy line from Playmates were announced to be released.[51]\n\nNickelodeon attraction[]\n\n:Main article: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shell Shock\n\nA Gerstlauer Sky Fly is operating at Nickelodeon Universe at Mall of America, Nickelodeon demonstrated a ride based on the 2012 TV series called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shell Shock. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shell Shock was opened on March 17, 2012, and was the first of its kind in the United States. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group, who handles all of Gerstlauer's operations in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTurtlepedia\n\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles\n\nMedia TV Series: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012) • Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nTV Specials: TMNT: Turtles Forever • TMNT: Turtles Take Time (and Space) • TMNT: Half-Shell Heroes - Blast to the Past\n\nFilms: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows • Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nComics: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Amazing Adventures • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: New Animated Adventures • Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (comic book)\n\nVideo games: Out of the Shadows • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2013) • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) • Danger of the Ooze • Mutants in Manhattan • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Legends • Shredder's Revenge\n\nCharacters Leonardo • Michelangelo • Donatello • Raphael • Splinter • April O'Neil • Casey Jones • Shredder • Karai\n\nEpisodes\n\nLocations New York City • Turtle Hideout • The Foot mansion • The Krang Universe • Planet Triceratron\n\nSongs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Score • TMNT Theme song (CD9 version)\n\nRelated Mirage Studios • Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shell Shock • Lego Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"
