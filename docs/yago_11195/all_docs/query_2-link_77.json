        "text": "With the success of the animated film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, most fans knew it was only a matter of time before the boys returned to live-action. According to The Hollywood Reporter, that’s exactly what’s happening, but in a new and unexpected way. According to the report, Paramount is developing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin, an adaptation of a popular recent IDW comics series and an upcoming video game. Not only will this be a live-action feature, but in a first for the Ninja Turtles franchise, they are aiming for an R-rating. Former DC Films head executive Walter Hamada is producing.\n\nTyler Burton Smith, who co-wrote the 2019 reboot of Child’s Play is writing the script. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin comic is a relatively recent one, coming out as a five-issue mini-series in 2020. It was co-written by TMNT creator Peter Laird, along with Tom Waltz. Esau and Isaac Escorza, Ben Bishop, and Eastman provided the art. The Last Ronin takes place in a dystopian future New York, one where Shredder’s murderous grandson kills three of the Turtles and Splinter one by one. Only one of the Turtles survives and goes on a Kill Bill-style mission of revenge.\n\nIn the original comic, they didn’t make it clear which Turtle survived for some time. Since he had the weapons of all four of them, it was a tantalizing mystery. This The Last Ronin conceit is something they’ll likely keep as part of the upcoming R-rated Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles film."
