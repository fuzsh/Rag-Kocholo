        "text": "New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Series In The Works\n\nA Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, from the team behind Mutant Mayhem, is in the works at Paramount+.\n\nBy Sckylar Gibby-Brown |\n\nIf you were excited about the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated movie from Seth Rogen, then you’re about to be on cloud nine when you hear that a new TMNT series is in the works. According to CBR, it’s time to get ready for more shell-shocking adventures with everyone’s favorite crime-fighting turtles as a new animated series based on the TMNT franchise is currently in development for the streaming service Paramount+.\n\nThe new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated show is rumored to continue the storyline from the highly anticipated film Mutant Mayhem, which is set to hit theaters on August 2, 2023. Directed by Jeff Rowe and written by Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Dan Hernandez, and Benji Samit, Mutant Mayhem promises to bring the beloved characters to life in a whole new way.\n\nWhile the official confirmation from Paramount or ViacomCBS is still pending, fans can expect the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series to debut in 2024. It’s worth noting that this particular animated show will not be connected to the previously announced villain-focused films also slated for Paramount+. Those films, set to be released in 2023, will delve into the world of the TMNT villains, giving audiences a unique perspective on the franchise.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series is said to be keeping the same team as those developing the Mutant Mayhem movie, with Rogan remaining on the project as a producer. The plan for the new TMNT revival will begin later this summer with Mutant Mayhem, a CG-animated film directed by Jeff Rowe, who previously co-directed the critically acclaimed animated feature, The Mitchells vs. The Machines.\n\nMutant Mayhem has already garnered attention with its star-studded voice cast. Seth Rogen himself will be lending his voice to the character of Bebop, while other notable actors include Paul Rudd as Mondo Gecko, John Cena as Rocksteady, Giancarlo Esposito as Baxter Stockman, and Jackie Chan as Splinter. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themselves will be voiced by a talented group of teenage actors: Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Canto as Leonardo, and Brady Noon as Raphael.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie cast also includes Hannibal Buress as Genghis Frog, Rose Byrne as Leatherhead, Ice Cube as Superfly, Natasia Demetriou as Wingnut, Post Malone as Ray Fillet, Maya Rudolph as Cynthia Utrom, and Ayo Edebiri as April O’Neil.\n\nWith such an incredible lineup of talent and an expansive universe to explore, fans are eagerly awaiting the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. The franchise, created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in the 1980s, has captured the hearts of audiences worldwide with its unique blend of action, humor, and camaraderie. The reboot, led by Rogan, aims to capture the magic from the original series and introduce the story to a brand new generation while simultaneously providing entertaining nostalgia for the adults who grew up watching the cartoon in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back, and they’re ready to take on the world once again in a whole new chapter of their iconic story. Cowabunga, dudes!"
