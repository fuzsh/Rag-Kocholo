        "text": "\"I need new butts to kick!!\" Paramount+ has revealed a quick teaser for their upcoming animated spin-off series titled Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, set to launch sometime this summer. This is a continuation of the massively successful animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem from last year, one of my favorites as well. Set after the events of the 2023 movie, the Turtles emerge from the sewers and onto the streets of New York, where they are faced with new threats & team up with old allies, to navigate through teenage life and villains in the city. The Turtles must deal with their new life as heroes while also dealing with the pressures of going to high school in New York City. Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon reprise their roles from the film as the Turtles, alongside Ayo Edebiri reprising her role as April O'Neil. This series is the 5th animated TMNT TV show, and was originally announced last year along with the sequel to Mutant Mayhem. This takes things back to a simple 2D animated style, but it still has the same spunk and charm as the movie. Keep an eye out for more.\n\nFirst look teasers for Paramount+'s series Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, on YouTube:"
