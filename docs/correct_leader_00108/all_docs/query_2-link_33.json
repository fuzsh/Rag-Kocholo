Rubin said the department’s No. 2 official–Strobe Talbott–had left Yerevan–the Armenian capital–an hour or so before the attack.\n\nHe had met with the president–the prime minister and the foreign minister as part of his trip to assess the potential for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan–Rubin said.\n\nAccording to reports by the \"AR1\" TV company–deputy of the Parliament–academician Mikael Kotanian died in the hospital from severe wounds.
