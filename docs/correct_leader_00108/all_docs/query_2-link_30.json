        "text": "The History Museum of Armenia hosted a commemorative matinee and the opening of the exhibition dedicated to the 65th anniversary of Sparapet Vazgen Sargsyan, organised jointly with the Vazgen Sargsyan House-Museum. The event was also attended by family members, relatives, and friends of Vazgen Sargsyan.\n\nDavit Poghosyan, Director of the History Museum of Armenia, delivered welcoming remarks, noting that the exhibition includes items presented to the museum by Sparapet’s family, and they will be included in the museum’s permanent exhibition in the future. He noted that this jointly organised exhibition is another opportunity for visitors to interact with these important relics left to us by Sparapet.\n\nVazgen Sargsyan’s brother Aram Sargsyan, thanking the History Museum for the initiative, emphasised that Vazgen Sargsyan holds a special place in the heart of the Armenian nation and is an exemplary character for the upbringing of generations. Then he presented V. Sargsyan’s pen to the museum.\n\nSparapet’s family and friends also spoke about him and shared their memories.\n\nThe exhibition will run for the next few months."
