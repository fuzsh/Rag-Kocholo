        "text": "According to Prosecutor General Anna Vardapetyan’s order of December 30, 2022 disciplinary sanction in the form of “reprimands” was appointed against the person holding autonomous position in the Prosecutor’s Office of Kotayk region (earlier in the Military Prosecutor’s Office of Goris Garrison).\n\nIt was confirmed that in the framework of the disciplinal proceedings, the former prosecutor of the Military Prosecutor’s Office of Goris Garrison (now the Senior Prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s Office of Kotayk region), being a public prosecutor in two judicial cases, improperly performed his official duties.\n\nParticularly, being responsible for the legitimacy of public prosecution, initiated negotiations in the frameworks of coordinating proceedings with mandatory conscripts, officers A. M., and Ye. Gh., as well as with N. Gh. and their defenders. In the result the prosecutor came to an agreement with the parties to foreseen punishment against the mentioned persons who committed crimes not of great gravity, in the form of imprisonment though according to Article 67, Part 5 of the Criminal Code, the person committed crimes not of great gravity for the first time couldn’t be condemned to imprisonment.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that according to the agreements signed with A.M., Ye. Gh. and their defenders the First Instance Court of General Jurisdiction of Syunik region, despite the envisaged arrangement in accordance with Article 67, Part 5 of the Criminal Code, according to the judgment made on July 15, 2022, A.M. was charged for committing an offence and the punishment of 7 months imprisonment, and against Ye. Gh., the court defined a probation period accordingly 1 year and 6 months and 1 year and 5 months.\n\nBesides, based on the agreement signed in the framework of coordinating proceedings with N. Gh. and his defender the First Instance Court of General Jurisdiction of Syunik region, despite the envisaged arrangement in accordance with the Article 67, Part 5 of the Criminal Code, according to the judgment made on July 15, 2022 N. Gh. was charged and the punishment with 5 months imprisonment, and conditionally not applying this, the court defined a probation period for 1 year and 6 months."
