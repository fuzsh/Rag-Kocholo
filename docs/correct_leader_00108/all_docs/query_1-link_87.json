        "text": "January 21, 1993, dawned cold and sunny as I went to Yanshak village (Kelbajar region) with my friend from Yerevan to meet representatives from the Ministry of Defense of Armenia.\n\nI won’t include their names because, after the war, they held high positions, earned equally high army ranks, received military awards, and most importantly: they have families, children, grandchildren and friends who are respected in society. I had first met them two days prior, at Vazgen Sargsyan’s request, and had promised to cooperate. Their goal was to launch an operation to fight off the enemy from Omar’s mountain pass and recapture the posts they had given up earlier. They meant the summits that a few months ago, we had occupied with the help of the local battalions of Moruq (Bead) Rafo and Kholostoy (Batchelor) Ago. We had retaken those summits, and they were being protected by NN subdivisions. However, under the intense pressure of the Azerbaijani forces, our troops were unable to defend them, so they withdrew to Yanshak village below. Vazgen asked me to help them in recapturing the abandoned positions, and I agreed to allocate two battalions and support them with artillery.\n\nAs Deputy Regiment Commander, I reported Ashot Arushanyan, my Commander, on the situation when I returned to the 5th squad. Refusing to help would mean allowing the enemy to push us back again from the north and the east. I volunteered to go there with two battalions and organize the operation. “Agreed,” said Ashot, “choose who you want and go.” Neither did the Commander of the Defense Army of Nagorno Karabakh object. I chose Moruq Rafo’s and Ilyich’s battalions, because they were the best, and announced our departure. After two hours, we set off. I tried to contact our team in Yanshak, but they didn’t respond. I tried again, but no one answered. Half an hour later, I started to worry and decided to move ahead of my subdivision. I was with Vanik Torosyan, and the silence we encountered seriously alarmed me. We didn’t see a single soul. But the picturesque surroundings eased my fears, and Vanik and I admired the scene. It’s impossible to be indifferent to Kelbajar’s beauty. I told Vanik how we liberated this heavenly place and the significant role it has for Artsakh and Armenia.\n\nKelbajar is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. It boasts ravines, caves, mountains, spruce forests, springs, and rivers in which you see the reflection of the sky. And how fertile this amazingly chocolate-brown soil is! The fruits and vegetables that grow here! The diversity of the plants with their red, blue and yellow flowers makes it seem as though you’re walking over a carefully knitted, delicately designed carpet rather than a meadow. If you throw your head back and gaze at the sky, it seems so close that you’d think you can touch it with your hand. At night, when the sky is clear, the bright stars are so densely packed that the sky behind it is barely visible. Even the soil seems colorful because it’s scattered with various stones that surprisingly aren’t precious gems. Wherever you look, there are rainbows. It seems to me that Kelbajar is an inexhaustible storehouse of many familiar and even unfamiliar colors.\n\nAt Xamshlu village at the foot of the mountain towers the majestic Dadivank monastery. It was built in the ninth century on Dadi’s tomb, the student of the Apostle Judas Thaddeus, who was one of the first to bring Christianity in Armenia. In 2007, excavations in the main church near the altar uncovered the saint’s relics. But before that, it has been destroyed and rebuilt. The Soviet authority brought total ruin to this monastery. The Azerbaijanis turned the temple into a barn. Although it had been under Azerbaijani control for seventy years, the church survived — but I wouldn’t say it was preserved. That’s why I was honored to be the first one to step into this medieval monastery that was long in waiting for us, its liberators. Dadivank became a center from where God’s grace once more spread over the Kelbajar region. When the operation for the liberation of Kelbajar began, Zhora Gasparyan (Commander of Karabakh Artillery), allowed me to discharge the first volley from Grad towards the enemy’s positions. We were surprised, when we later entered the liberated Xamshlu, that not a single shell had fallen on any of its three churches, nor their bell towers. On the other hand, dozens of dead bodies lay between the buildings, and a Ural (on the back of which many half-burnt Azerbaijanis lay holding their guns between their legs), stood near the monastery. It was a stunning result.\n\nBut back to my story. Near the tunnel, the guard stopped us and warned us that we couldn’t continue, because the opponent was up ahead. In a minute, Mayor Serj Karapetyan, the Commander of the Etchmiadzin squad, ran towards us. His report wasn’t good. It turned out that the squad from Armenia led by those same high-ranking officials from the Ministry of Defense who needed my help (again, I won’t name names) had fled after meeting the enemy. Moreover, they had abandoned the nearby post (with its 30 young and untrained recruits) to fate’s hands. Mayor Karapetyan was their Commander. The ministry’s soldiers, once more, didn’t respond when I tried to contact them. Also, I couldn’t contact headquarters, so the only thing to do was to decide our course of action. If the opponent recaptures Ynshak, it could be tough to kick them out. Moreover, the Kelbajar region would be under greater threat of being captured.\n\nMaking sure that Murka’s and Ilyich’s battalions were on their way, I advanced with Serj Karapetyan’s squad to Kamishli to wait for our battalion. I sent scouts ahead, and we made for the village. On the outskirts, a tall maple tree had grown on a wide road, and near it, there were spring and a graveyard of fallen from the Eastern Front in World War II.\n\nMy sixth sense told me that something was wrong, and I ordered everyone to stop and take cover until our scouts clarified the situation. On my radio, I contacted the posts and in doing so, I accidentally shook the long silver antenna. The scouts reported they had noticed a few snipers at the summit of the mountain range, near Dadivank and apparently, spotters of artillery fire.\n\nWe hadn’t yet managed to dig ourselves a trench when the mortar firing began. There was no doubt that they were firing at us. In an instant, Kelbajar’s blessed heaven turned into hell. Everything around us was being torn apart, clots of soil flew up, the blue sky turned black, and the earth turned red. You couldn’t see anything but explosions. By pressing myself to the thick trunk of the maple tree, I managed to move behind the tree, avoiding the splinters and blast waves coming from every side. Almost nothing was left of the tree. Its dry branches ignited. Only then did I realize that the snipers had located us by my silver antenna. It turned out it was I, the commander, who brought trouble down on these men who had never even smelled gunpowder. The Azerbaijanis, like us, had functional intelligence assessments. They knew the call signs of most commanders, and whenever possible, they eavesdropped on our conversations. Not so much by running, but mostly by leaping and dodging, I threw myself into the cemetery, trying to draw fire away from Etchmiadzin recruits. I ordered Mayor Karapetyan to withdraw to the last bend in the road, and the scouts to neutralize the snipers. At that moment, a few mines (82 and 120 millimeters long) exploded nearby. Splinters slammed into my back, leg, right shoulder, chest and head. My friend Vanik, who was running behind me, was also wounded in his leg. The memory of the blast wave hitting me, my body flying through the air is still lodged in my consciousness, even 25 years later. That endless moment felt like an eternity. Without exaggeration, my whole life fitted into that one moment. I took it as a sign from hell and will remember it forever. At that moment, scenes from my childhood, adolescence, Sovkhoz gardens, jazz concerts, tank shootings, signature gatherings, times in jail — short scenes from my entire life flickered by frantically but clearly. Watching this strange film, I mourned the possibility that I might not see the continuation. Covered in blood, I lay under the maple tree near a spring and tried to understand what had happened to Serj’s detachment. My radio lay nearby, speaking to me: “Artur, answer me, it’s Haykaz… Artur to Haykaz, Artur to Haykaz… I can see you, hold on, I’ll get you out of there, everything is going to be okay. Ando — answer me, Ando, can you see Amaras?” “Yes, sir, I see him.” “You’re close to him, run, and carry him out of there.” “Got it, I’m on my way.”\n\nMy blurred consciousness sent signals to my vision, and I looked through the veil before my eyes and noticed someone approaching me.\n\n“Haykaz to Ando. Ando, Ando, are you alive? Ando, answer me! What’s the situation in the cemetery, answer.”\n\n“This is Aro, commander.”\n\n“Aro, run to Ando, see if he’s alive or not and then quickly ran to Amaras, carry him out of there. “\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Respond to Haykaz. Where did they shoot Ando from, who has eyes on the sniper?”\n\n“This is Vardan, we’re already working on it.”\n\n“Got you, Haykaz, Aro, I’m listening.”\n\n“Sir, Ando is dead, we’re moving forward.”\n\n“Be quick, my dear. Aro, Aro — how are you? Take care of that damn sniper. Vardan, where are you? Can’t you see, he’s taking us out one by one?”\n\nAn enormous dust cloud approached me… I could feel that I was losing my consciousness, but I tried to hang on to it by biting my lips until they were covered in blood. Eventually, I lost control of what was happening around me. Where was Vanik? Where were Serj and his troops, what had happened to them? Why had no one come to get me? What’s that cloud coming closer? Within a moment, the cloud had covered me completely. Someone took me by my shoulders and legs, and lifting from the ground, they threw me somewhere. But where? Then, I lost consciousness and found myself in a land of white; a white forest surrounded me, I could see the shining white meadows beyond the trees. Everything was white: far away, I saw the outlines of white cities with white memorials and squares. Was it winter? Apparently, it wasn’t; it wasn’t even snow. Everything was just pure white; nothing moved, everything was frozen. Somewhere above, the sun shone so bright that it blinded me, and I couldn’t figure out what was happening and where I was.\n\n“So, how are you?”\n\nI opened my eyes and saw Haykaz!\n\n“Where am I?” I asked. “What happened with the men?”\n\n“We lost Ando and Aro as they tried to get to you,” said Haykaz. “You’re in the hospital, in Getavan. I’m sorry, I have to hurry, they’re waiting for me. Get well soon!”\n\n“Wait just a moment, Haykaz, who pulled me out?”\n\n“I drove my UAZ, picked you and Vanik up, and got you from the shooting. You and Vanik were wounded by the same shell; I saw it with my eyes.”\n\n“What happened with Serj and his men?”\n\n“They are fine, but we had two losses there as well… The Azerbaijanis had a good spotter, that’s why we had so many casualties. But in the end, we shot the two of them: the spotter and the sniper who killed Ando and Aro. Stay strong, Art, everything will be okay. I have to run.”\n\n“Where’s my rifle?” I shouted after him.\n\n“WhChapter 22: Hell in Heaven\n\nJanuary 21, 1993, dawned cold and sunny as I went to Yanshak village (Kelbajar region) with my friend from Yerevan to meet representatives from the Ministry of Defense of Armenia.\n\nI won’t include their names because, after the war, they held high positions, earned equally high army ranks, received military awards, and most importantly: they have families, children, grandchildren and friends who are respected in society.
