I was fortunate to have had a chance to meet with Prime Minister Sargsyan last month at the White House. He spoke of the commitment of the Armenian people to build a peaceful and prosperous democracy.\n\nI condemn in the strongest possible terms this wanton, reckless effort to subvert that democracy. I am confident this tragedy will only strengthen the determination of the Armenian people to choose their own leaders, and to work toward peace and prosperity in Armenia and throughout the region. We in the United States will continue to work with the Armenian people in pursuit of those goals, as we continue to reach out to them to deepen the U.S.-Armenian friendship.\n\n# # #"
