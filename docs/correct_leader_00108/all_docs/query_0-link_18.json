        "text": "The Prosecutor General's Office of Armenia (Armenian: Հայաստանի Հանրապետության դատախազություն, romanized: Hayastani glkhavor datakhazut’yun) is a government agency tasked for supervising the public procurator system in Armenia, exercising its authority through the Prosecutor General of Armenia.[1] It oversees the enforcement of Armenian law by law enforcement agencies such as the Police of Armenia and the National Security Service.[2] The office is located on 5 Vazgen Sargsyan Street, Yerevan. The current Prosecutor General is Anna Vardapetyan.[3][4]\n\nThe Prosecutor General's Office of the First Republic of Armenia began to operate on 6 December 1918, when the ruling council adopted the law \"On the application of the laws of the former Russian Empire on the territory of Armenia”. In December 1922, the Soviet Union began to create its own governmental institutions and legal systems. During this period, a prosecutor’s office in the USSR Supreme Court, with a subdivision of that office being created in the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (which was one of the predecessors to what is now Armenia) was established. On 20 July 1933, the Office of Public Procurator of the USSR was founded by a joint decision of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and the Council of People's Commissars, which resulted in the creation of republican affiliate units in Soviet Republics. On 27 February 1959, a board was established in the Soviet prosecutor’s office headed by the chief prosecutor of the Armenian SSR.\n\nOn 5 July 1995, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the first Constitution of Armenia was adopted. As a result, an independent military and prosecutor's office was established on 5 October of that year. The agency became a full member of the Coordinating Council of Prosecutors General of the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1999 and became a member of the International Association of Prosecutors and the Conference of Prosecutors General of Europe in 2005.[5]\n\nThe office has the following organizational structure:[6]\n\nCentral office\n\nInvestigation department for\n\nSupervision department\n\nDepartment for Charge Defense and Appealing of Judicial Acts\n\nPublic security department\n\nDepartment for the protection of state interests\n\nLegal department\n\nDepartment for international legal cooperation\n\nDepartment for corruption and economic crimes\n\nDepartment of organization legal assistance\n\nIT department\n\nSecretariat\n\nProtocol department\n\nDivision of public relations\n\nInternal audit division\n\nStaff management division\n\nOrganizational division\n\nStatistics and analysis division\n\nMilitary Prosecutor\n\nInvestigation division\n\nSupervision division\n\nDivision for the protection of state interests\n\nGarrison offices\n\nYerevan Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nGoris Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nLori Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nSevan Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nShirak Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nYeghegnadzor Garrison Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nGarrison № 1 Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nGarrison № 2 Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nGarrison № 3 Military Prosecutor’s Office\n\nCity of Yerevan prosecutors offices:\n\nProsecutor's Office of Yerevan City\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Avan and Nor-Nork Districts\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Malatia-Sebastia District\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Ajapnyak and Davtashen Districts\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Arabkir and Kanaker-Zeytun Districts\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Erebuni and Nubarashen Districts\n\nProsecutor's Office of the Kentron and Nork-Marash Districts\n\nProsecutor's Office of Shengavit Administrative District\n\nRegional prosecutor's offices:\n\nProsecutor's Office of Aragatsotn Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Ararat Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Armavir Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Gegharkunik Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Kotayk Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Shirak Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Lori Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Syunik Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Vayots Dzor Region\n\nProsecutor's Office of Tavush Region\n\nTerritorial divisions\n\nSuren Osipyan (1971–1988)\n\nVladimir Nazaryan (1988–1990)\n\nArtavazd Gevorgyan (1990–1997)\n\nHenrik Khachatryan (1997–1998)\n\nZhirayr Kharatyan (1998)\n\nAghvan Hovsepyan (1998–1999)\n\nBoris Nazaryan (1999–2001)\n\nAram Tamazyan (2001–2004)[7]\n\nAghvan Hovsepyan (2004—2013)[8]\n\nGevorg Kostanyan (2013–2016)[9]\n\nArtur Davtyan (2016–2022)\n\nAnna Vardapetyan (2022–present)[10]\n\nGovernment portal\n\nLaw portal\n\nSociety portal\n\nConstitutional Court of Armenia\n\nConstitution of Armenia\n\nJudiciary of Armenia"
