I have done this for my own use, and would like to share it with Groong readers. Comments in square brackets are my own additions -- Razmik Panossian.] Listening to your comments yesterday, I admit that I totally changed my speech, understanding, with great joy, that there is no need to make historic, moral, and patriotic pronouncements. Everything is clear. The century began with tragedy for us, we continued with achievements and losses, and we have the imperative to end it with victory. We want the 21st century to be the era of unity, the strengthening of statehood, and prosperity. Based on this, I want to assert certain realities, and to give the government's answers and suggestions to them. Reality number 1: Armenia is no longer an abstract and mysterious fatherland which needs to be discovered. Rather, it is a real, independent country. This is Armenia's third republic, with its permanent achievements, with its unlimited problems and uncertainties. Reality number 2: The Armenian republic has solved two of the three arch-problems (gerkhndir) facing it at this historic juncture: a) It has won the [Gharabagh] war forced onto it, achieving an earned peace. b) With the aid of the people, of the rulers and political forces, it has established lasting internal political stability -- which is the most serious basis for the success of future essential tasks. Only two days ago, we marked the anniversary of Armenia's independence. With pride, we greeted the victorious army's military parade. And, I am convinced, we realised that only pan-national unity of will, and unity of forces, brought independence to Armenia and saved Artsakh from destruction. Believe me, today the economic development (verelk) of Armenia is as important as victory in the war was yesterday. Our battle has moved from the field of blood and heroism, to the economic field. Hence, our strategy must change too; from assistance -- for which we will not thank you in order not to offend your honour -- to substantive cooperation. We must give much more productive and organisational shape to our emotional and spontaneous relations. History demonstrates that the peoples who win are the ones who are more organised and rational. And this is our 3rd arch-problem and reality simultaneously. Let us look at questions emanating from this problem: many preconditions are necessary in order to realise a new organisational dimension; but the most important one is the moral-psychological (baroyahogebanakan). Unfortunately, both in the fatherland and in the diaspora, the examples of conflicts leading to disunity and separation are many. First and foremost, mutual trust and tolerance are essential for us. And the first indications of these must come from the fatherland. We will begin improvements from the inside of the country, from the government, from the Prime Minister. As a start, I am declaring in the name of the government of the Armenian republic: 1) The government not only can, but is obliged and is ready to treat the diaspora as an equal partner. 2) The government is ready, where needed, to address issues related to legal, financial, and taxation improvements. (To secure solutions to legal and administrative disputes related to contracts [text in round parentheses was not read during the speech --RP].) 3) The government realistically accepts that the invested capital does not have a sense of nation belonging, even if it is in the hands of investors with Armenian origins. Cooperation with the fatherland has to be economically profitable. Investments in Armenia must be beneficial. [I assume he meant beneficial to Armenia --RP.] 4) The government understands that no financial investments will take place if correct and fair rules are not cultivated and realised, and made known to the public. All information related to investments and loans received must be made public and explained by the President of the republic through the state and mass media. In order to restore trust, and to develop transparent financial-economic means, the Armenian government has already adopted certain concrete measures: 1) A government committee is established, headed by the Prime Minister, to monitor loans, grants, and humanitarian assistance received. This means that responsibility is also fixed. From now on, the government, and the prime minister personally, is responsible for funds (i.e. the loans, grants, assistance received) which are misused or disappear. All Armenian governments [in the past] believed that it was enough to give personal guarantees to foreign investors, assuming that they will invest in our markets and grow. But we are not naive. We understand that investors do not demand, in the first instance, personal guarantees, but structural guarantees -- clear and unchanging rules of the game. Let us, however, accept that the shaping of such structures is a huge task and takes time, and which we must realise together. In the meantime, the first step is the political will to do this. I am, with all responsibility, declaring that the government of the Armenian republic has that will, and is ready to assume the responsibility. Try it and you be convinced. 2) With the National Assembly, we are to create in the upcoming days a joint council (handznazhoghov) which will examine a series of loan programmes which have created some noise. The guilty ones will be known; this will prevent the repetition of similar incidents in the future. 3) With the World Bank and the US Embassy we are developing a comprehensive programme to combat corruption, which, without doubt, we will implement. A bit more in detail about corruption. Corruption in Armenia has, unfortunately, reached serious proportions. But not as serious as we ourselves are presenting. We are \"making a hair into a post.\" Such self-criticism often sounds like \"it is impossible to live in this country, it is impossible to do business in this country...\" Why? Who does this country belong to? Who are the residents of this country? Lately, an extremely dangerous philosophy has emerged: some are even using such excuses to leave the country. Dear Armenians, sisters and brothers, believe me, no one is criticising Armenians to the extend of such rejection, of such self-denial, that we are criticising ourselves. This is making us worse in the eyes of foreigners. We are creating such a moral-psychological environment within which it is impossible to grow the seeds of tomorrow. This county is our difficult but priceless fatherland. Is it possible to leave the fatherland? Who is upsetting you? On the 15-16th of every month, I am declaring a day of reception on economic issues. I am ready to receive all of you, from Armenia and from the diaspora. Let us see who is it that is disturbing you. This, obviously, is once again a personalised and not comprehensive solution. I am also suggesting a structural solution. In the next 5-6 months we will create for external and internal investors an agency to provide them with assistance and services. This will be the Armenian Development Agency (Zargatsman haykakan gortzakalutiun). This will be a unique window between Armenia and the world. A one stop centre, where every potential investor can receive solutions to all problems concerning him -- from the moment of being greeted at the airport, to legal, administrative, technical and other services. Through this Agency, it will be possible, without bureaucratic delays, to register any company and to receive for its operation all the permissions and certificates. The Agency will be a real bridge between foreign businessmen and the Armenia's administration, enabling Armenia's administration to know the problems faced by the businessmen. (The government guarantees the maximum transparency of this Agency [text in parentheses, not read during the speech, but in the written text --RP].) The Agency will be directly subordinate to the Prime Minister. It will have the possibility to work directly with the President, with the Chairman of Parliament and other branches of the administration. The leadership bodies of the Agency will be comprised of the council of trustees (hogabardzuneri khorhurd) wich will include internationally recognised businessmen and benefactors, as well as leaders of authoritative international organisations. There will also be an executive council (tnorenneri khorhurd) which will include all the economic ministers within the government, and representatives from the diaspora. In general, in the 4 executive bodies (varchutiun) of the Agency, the diaspora will be represented as equally as Armenians of Armenia. (It is desirable that the executive council's president be a diasporan Armenian [text in parentheses not read during the speech --RP].) Finally, the Agency will be run by the best and the most knowledgeable people, who will work in the best possible offices, receiving high salaries without being dependent on anyone. The government is assuming the cost of this and all other related expenses. The creation of branch offices of the Agency abroad is being envisioned, notably in London, NY, LA, Beirut and Moscow. Let us think from today onwards, I ask you, about the best cadres of diaspora Armenian that can be made available [for this project]. It is also possible that the best of the young and student diaspora Armenians can work here during their vacations. (As mentioned by the President yesterday, to bring diasporan youth to Armenia, the Armenian government decided to provide one of its resort buildings at Tzaghkadzor to visiting youth [clap, clap... Text in parentheses does not appear in the published version, but was added during the speech --RP].) After independence, Armenia's administration established links mostly with known diasporan organisations and prominent individuals. This has left out many successful individuals, mainly young, who are far from the community's structures and organisations, from party activities. In this \"silent majority,\" no doubt, there will be people whom we must be able to link with the fatherland's economic activities. The experience of the near past also reminds us that the new plans of economic cooperation must remain far from the political domain. What are we proposing? In relation to this and related issues, we are proposing to this conference to establish a Council (handznazhoghov), half of whose members -- at the very least -- and its leader, to be diaspora Armenians [con't on p.2 of newspaper text]. The Armenian Development Agency can serve as a working body for this Council. It is desirable to hold mini-conferences for the Council, including diasporan businessmen, companies, political and economic activists. The government will be willing to assume the costs of such events. The result will be real and mutually beneficial plans. Despite the difficult conditions, the economy of Armenia has wide potential. We will try to convince you of this tomorrow at the business forum and the trade-fair of Armenian products. I am specifically referring to metallurgy, chemical industry, water resources, farming (?- kyiughmterk). I am not even mentioning the serious intellectual potential. These realities are also affirmed by the fact that the president of the World Bank, Wolfensohn, proposed to jointly organise with the Armenian government in 2000 an international businessmen's forum -- to which we have of course agreed. I ask you to seriously think about this proposal. Many of you will soon receive an invitation from Mr. Wolfensohn and I. Believe me, the passivity of diasporan Armenians [to invest] in Armenia is leading to serious doubts among foreign investors. I would like to refer to one other important issue. It is about the economic role of Armenian embassies. They can become important hubs of regional communications, an appropriate communications means between the fatherland and the diaspora. Thank you for the financial assistance which the communities have given to the embassies, particularly in the first phase of their activities. In 2000, the Armenian government will assume the responsibility to provide the embassies with all the administrative and staff (komunal-kentsaghayin) expenses. We must secure the appropriate running/living expenses of the embassies and ambassadors, and their independence. Simultaneously, their responsibilities will increase, including -- and particularly in -- the realm of economic cooperation. Your assistance to the ambassadors must be focussed on more general, political issues such as lobbying, investments, and perhaps in certain places, on problems related to [i.e.acquiring/maintenance of] buildings. I am also proposing to create through this conference a permanent working-coordinating group which will coordinate all proposals, and will prepare the documents for discussion/analysis. In the worse case, by the next (Armenia-diaspora) conference the doubts between the diasporan organisations, and toward us, will be dissipated. In the best case, this will assist in the creation of a pan-national coordinating body which will be able to distinguish between the various problems, and identify the most important, giving directions for their solution. We have become so cautious, that I am thinking: are we not taking the eye out, instead of shaping the eyebrow? In any case, let us take my words as that of a previous straight-forward defence minister. No! we are not going take the eye out of anyone. As they say in diplomatic language, our unity is not directed against anyone. It is to work for, not against. Look at the world powers, what they have achieved. But us, we are still debating to hurry or not to hurry, to say or not to say \"Armenia-diaspora or diaspora-Armenia.\" What are we waiting for? The last step to Armenia's economic ruin? The abandonment of Armenia by Armenians? or, until the followers of the sects are more numerous than the apostolics? [This part, his tone was particularly forceful --RP.] Why not say it? There are issues which Armenia is going to tell the diaspora, and there are issues which the diaspora, without feeling restrained, must tell Armenia. And so that this \"to say/not to say\" is regulated, any body of pan-national trust must be necessarily created. The sooner the better. When we are together we must be cautious only of our desires since they are becoming realities. Let our examples begin from Sardarapat, to the heroic struggle for Artsakh, the Goris-Lachin Highway, the success of 907. Unfortunately, we have more counter-examples. I promised not to be emotional, and I did not succeed. I did not succeed because your humble servant [!!-RP] is not the Prime Minister of a well-to-do country; since the Armenian people is not living a life appropriate to its experienced suffering and to its talents. I am hopeful that in 2001, when we gather once again for the occasion of the 1700th anniversary, conditions will be relatively better. This is our chance. We are going to turn the 20th page of history together and with success. I am optimistic. On the hill in front of Khor Virab altar I also see the image of Noah facing Mt Ararat. I am seeing the prosperous future and honourable living appropriate for this small collective, for the residents of these mountains, who have witnessed (handisatsatz) the rebirth of humanity and of Christian civilisation. For this to materialise, we need only one thing. To use our chance, not to rely on the last possible opportunity, but to use it today, from this moment, and believe me, the 21st century will be ours."
