Mellette, SD-John Ford, 87, of Mellette died June 24, 2022, at his home. His wishes were to have no formal service.

John was united in marriage to Dorothy Barton in 1958 in Mellette. They moved to La Mirada, CA, where he worked for Rockwell International, later Boeing Aircraft, working his way into a management position. He retired from Boeing after 30 years and returned to Mellette in 1990. He lived on the family farm.
