Mr. Ford was called to be with the Lord on Sunday, July 7, 2019. He was born on December 14, 1951 in Lubbock to John W. and Cora May Ford. She preceded him in death in 2013. John married Ernestina Ybarra on September 29, 1999 in Lubbock. He was a car salesman prior to his retirement. His greatest joy was motorcycles.

He was also a master at working in his yard and keeping it meticulously groomed. If you throw any cigarette butts or bottle caps you better pick them up.
