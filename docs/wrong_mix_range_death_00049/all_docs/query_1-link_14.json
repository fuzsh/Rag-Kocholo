        "text": "John Ford (baptized April 17, 1586, Ilsington, Devon, Eng.—died 1639?) was an English dramatist of the Caroline period, whose revenge tragedies are characterized by certain scenes of austere beauty, insight into human passions, and poetic diction of a high order.\n\nIn 1602 Ford was admitted to the Middle Temple (a training college for lawyers), and he remained there, except for a period of suspension (1606–08), until at least 1617 and possibly much later still. He published an elegy on the Earl of Devonshire and a prose pamphlet in 1606, and a few other minor nondramatic works have been attributed to him during this period. It is not certain that he wrote for the stage until his collaboration with Thomas Dekker and William Rowley on the play The Witch of Edmonton in 1621. He also collaborated with Dekker in The Sun’s Darling (1624), perhaps also in The Welsh Ambassador (1623), and in three other plays, now lost, of about the same date. His hand has been seen in Thomas Middleton’s and William Rowley’s Spanish Gypsy (1623), John Fletcher’s Fair Maid of the Inn (1626), and other plays of Francis Beaumont and Fletcher.\n\nFrom about 1627 to 1638 Ford wrote plays by himself, mostly for private theatres, but the sequence of his eight extant plays cannot be precisely determined, and only two of them can be dated. His plays are: The Broken Heart; The Lover’s Melancholy (1628); ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore; Perkin Warbeck; The Queen; The Fancies, Chaste and Noble; Love’s Sacrifice; and The Lady’s Trial (1638). There are a few contemporary references to Ford, but nothing is known of his personal life, and there is no certain record of him after 1639.\n\nFord’s reputation, which has never been beyond controversy, rests mainly on the first four plays he wrote alone; of these, ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore is probably the best known. The story concerns the incestuous love of Giovanni and his sister Annabella. When she is found to be pregnant, she agrees to marry her suitor Soranzo; the lovers’ secret is finally discovered, but Soranzo’s plan for revenge is outpaced by Giovanni’s murder of Annabella and then Soranzo, at the hands of whose hired killers Giovanni himself finally dies. There is no sense in ’Tis Pity that Ford is arguing a case for the brother and sister’s unnatural union, but he does exhibit an eloquent sympathy for the lovers, who are set apart from others by their unlawful relationship, their consciousness of their sin, and their sensual and at times even arrogant acceptance of it.\n\nThe Broken Heart is characteristic of Ford’s work in its depiction of a noble and virtuous heroine who is torn between her true love and an unhappy forced marriage, again with tragic consequences for all concerned. Perkin Warbeck is a historical play centring on the tragic fate of the deluded impostor of that name who claimed to be the Duke of York. The Lover’s Melancholy is the best of Ford’s other plays, all of which are tragicomedies."
