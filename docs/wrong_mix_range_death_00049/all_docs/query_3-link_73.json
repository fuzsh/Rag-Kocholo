        "text": "Notes for John FORD\n\nMin Tamsitt <[email protected]> is a source for FORD and HARRIS. The following is from her email in October 2000:\n\nMy book on the Ford family which was launched in 1997 at a large reunion at Grafton, NSW, is named \"FORDing the Generations\" and is some 400 odd A4 pages filled with family stories and photographs. The story section of the book goes down to the 4th generation; the back section is a tree showing all known descendants of John and Eliza Ford as at March 1997. When we went to print I had some 8500 names in the database. Now, with associated families, like the Levetts, included my database is now well over 13,000, and is far too complex to send to anyone.\n\nJohn Ford was the eldest son of James Ford/Foord and Hannah Milham and had been born in Ninfield on 8 August 1816 one of 11 children. James was the son of Thomas Ford and Lydia Beaching. When John was 13 years of age his father was arrested for his part in the Battle of Sidley Green, a smuggling operation where an excise man, as well as two smugglers, were been killed. Subsequently James, after some time in Newgate Prison and on the Thames hulk “Justitia”, James was transported to Sydney town as a convict aboard the ship “Claudine”, picking up their prisoners from Woolwich on 10th August 1829. Arriving in Sydney on 16 December 1829, James was assigned to the establishment at Wellington Valley, NSW, but it is doubtful whether he could ever have reached this destination and returned to Sydney, in the time before he died there in hospital on 15 Feb 1830 - aged 44 years. Hannah, his wife, eventually remarried a Samuel Banks in 1836.\n\nWhy John and Eliza decided to come to Australia is not known - whether it be to find (out about) his father or for a better life??? They left Gravesend on 27 March 1839 and arrived in Sydney town on 25 July 1839, sailing that morning into Port Jackson. On the ship with them as a fellow bounty immigrant was Henry Parkes and his very pregnant wife. Henry Parkes was to become Sir Henry Parkes, Australia’s Father of Federation. Some very good accounts of the voyage comes from letters which he wrote home.\n\nJohn and Eliza also had his younger brother, James Foord (why he always seemed to keep the “o” and our line not, is not known) and Eliza’s younger sister, Naomi who travelled as a steerage passenger (that is she must have been a paying passenger). Information on Bounty Immigrants is quite detailed but there is only a name (if one is lucky) for a steerage passenger. John and Eliza also had two small children with them.\n\nJohn and Eliza settled on the Hunter River north of Sydney, around the town of Maitland. The res of their children were born in this area. When gold fever hit the area, John went off for a short time to try his luck with his brother-in-law William Seccombe. However John returned home convinced that there was more money to be made for farmers who stuck to their farms, making handsome profits because produce of every kind became so expensive. Johnwas and expert with horses and there are reports of him winning ploughing matches in competitions with much younger men. He became one of the best and most respected farmers in the area.\n\nAlways there were the big floods to contend with and the Hunter River experienced it’s first big flood which white men had seen in 1857, when there were 3 floodings - one in June, another in July and yet another in August, which was the biggest.\n\nAround the 1870s John and his wife and their unmarried children travelled north to the Clarence River and settled near the town of Grafton, where many of their own children had gone and also many of their Sussex friends. Only two daughters stayed in the Maitland area and even one of these came to the Grafton area for a time.\n\nEliza Alice died on 11 August 1885 in Grafton after an illness of four years - “softening of the brain” is given as the cause of death. She was a member of the Baptist Church, having been baptised at Hinton, whilst living on the Hunter River. After a service conducted by Rev. R. F. Becher, the Baptist Minister, Eliza was laid to rest in the Baptist Portion of the Grafton Cemetery on 12 August.\n\nJohn Ford had a trip back to England after his wife’s death. He then went back to the Hunter River for a time, but eventually returned to the Grafton area where he died from pneumonia on 21 Aug 1901. He was laid to rest beside his wife the next day. At his death the newspaper report states that he left 86 grand-children and upwards of 100 great grandchildren.\n\nJohn and Eliza’s children:\n\nJames Ford HARRIS was born in Ninfield, in 1835 or possibly late 1834, and was baptised as James Harris on 1 February 1835, at the same time that his mother, Eliza was baptised at the Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Ninfield, East Sussex, England. Four year old James did not come to Australia with his mother, Eliza, but stayes in England with Eliza’s parents, taking the name of John Ford Harris. It seems he could have been brought up as their own son, as in a letter dated 1864, written to his parents, he refers to his mother’s sister, Ruth thus: “I had a very kind sister in my Aunt Ruthâ¦..”. James married Ann Neeves in 1853 at the Ninfield church, she being the daughter of David and Martha Neeves. They had 5 daughters, Mercy, Ruth, Grace, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, and it is only this past year that we have been able to track down descendants of Elizabeth who married Zacariah Greenhill, who was a nephew to William Smith Greenhill who married her father’s aunt Ruth Harris. James Ford Harris died in St.Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, England in 1903.\n\nMother’s name at registration of death was given as Ann.\n\nNotes for Eliza Alice (Spouse 1)\n\nRegistration of death could be 1885/10037. This needs to be confirmed using the New South Wales BDM records."
