Philosopher and teacher, Jack devoted much of his life to teaching several generations of Louisvillians at Ursuline College, Bellarmine University, where he was chairman of the philosophy department, and the University of Louisville, where he was adjunct professor of philosophy for more than twenty years. In 1968 he became President of Mount St. Agnes College in Baltimore, Maryland. He later returned to Louisville to become Executive Director of Kentuckiana Metroversity, a consortium of Louisville’s universities and colleges.\n\nDr. Ford was a graduate of St. Xavier High School; St. Joseph’s College, Indiana; Xavier University, Ohio; and the University of Ottawa, Canada.

Later he received honorary degrees from St. Joseph’s College and Bellarmine University; the Horrigan Award for Distinguished Service, and the Distinguished Catholic School Alumni Award from the Archdiocese of Louisville.\n\nFor over four decades Jack was a frequent visitor, fellow pilgrim, and friend to the monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani, at times teaching classes and tutoring.\n\nAfter retirement, Jack and his wife Gladys founded Day Spring, a residential community for adults with intellectual disabilities, an accomplishment particularly close to his heart. He maintained an active interest in Day Spring until his death.\n\nJack found great joy in his wife and family. He was preceded in death by his parents, Rose Herbert Ford, and John B.
