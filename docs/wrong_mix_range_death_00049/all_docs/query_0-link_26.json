        "text": "Shots were fired during a rally speech by Donald Trump, in an incident that investigators are treating as a possible assassination attempt on the former President.\n\nIncluding Abraham Lincoln and JFK, here are some notable examples of shootings involving U.S. Presidents or presidential candidates:\n\nDonald Trump shooting LIVE updates July 14, 2024\n\nRonald Reagan (1981)\n\nPresident Reagan was shot and seriously wounded as he left an event at the Hilton hotel in Washington. The attacker was John Hinckley Jr, who was granted unconditional release in 2022.\n\nReagan spent twelve days in the hospital. The incident boosted Reagan’s popularity, as he displayed humor and resilience during his recovery.\n\nGerald Ford (1975)\n\nPresident Ford was left unscathed in two separate assassination attempts by women in September 1975, both in California and within a span of just 17 days.\n\nGeorge Wallace (1972)\n\nWhile campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wallace was shot four times and paralyzed for life at a shopping mall in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nThe assassination attempt on Wallace, who was known for his segregationist views and populist appeal, highlighted the ongoing political tensions in the US and potential for domestic violence in the Vietnam war era.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy (1968)\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy’s brother Robert, who was running for the Democratic presidential nomination, was shot and killed at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe assassination had a profound impact on the 1968 presidential race and occurred just two months after the killing of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, adding to the political turmoil of the late 1960s.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1963)\n\nRiding in his motorcade with his wife Jackie, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas by Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nThe Warren Commission investigating the assassination concluded in 1964 that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former marine who had lived in the Soviet Union, had acted alone.\n\nMany Americans believe the death of JFK began a more violent period in US politics and society, with the Vietnam War build up and the civil rights struggle as a backdrop.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (1933)\n\nAs president-elect, FDR was the target of an assassination attempt in Miami, Florida. He was unharmed, but Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was killed in the attack.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1912)\n\nLike Trump, Teddy Roosevelt was running for the White House as a former President when he was shot in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe bullet, which remained lodged in his chest for the rest of his life, was slowed by the folded 50-page speech and steel eyeglass case in his breast pocket.\n\nFamously, Roosevelt decided to deliver his scheduled speech despite being shot.\n\nWilliam McKinley (1901)\n\nPresident McKinley was shot and killed by anarchist Leon Czolgosz in Buffalo, New York.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1865)\n\nLincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and Confederate sympathizer, while watching a play called “Our American Cousin” at Ford’s Theater in Washington.\n\nBooth’s attack, just days after the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, was part of a larger plot that included attempts to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward."
