        "text": "Mellette, SD-John Ford, 87, of Mellette died June 24, 2022, at his home. His wishes were to have no formal service.\n\nJohn, son of Eugene and Aileen (Rawstern) Ford was born January 20, 1935, at Mellette. This is where he grew up. He attended high school, graduating with the class of 1953. He worked at South Dakota Wheat Growers through high school and then farmed for a few years.\n\nJohn was united in marriage to Dorothy Barton in 1958 in Mellette. They moved to La Mirada, CA, where he worked for Rockwell International, later Boeing Aircraft, working his way into a management position. He retired from Boeing after 30 years and returned to Mellette in 1990. He lived on the family farm.\n\nJohn enjoyed crossword puzzles, mowing and simply just being outside. In his younger years, he liked to play cards. But John loved being around his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The time around them brought him so much happiness.\n\nGrateful for having shared Johnâ€™s life are son, Douglas (Patti) Ford of Mellette; daughter, Kathryn Ford of Long Beach, CA; three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, Brandii (Ryan) Frisch and children, Greta and Mazie, Jill (Jonathan) Knight and children, Dominic, Hudson, Beau and Gemma, and Kevin (Kelsey) Ford and child, Ellis; and two brothers, Larry Ford of Mellette and Brian (Marilyn) Ford of Florida.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, and brother, Phillip.\n\nCarlsen Funeral Home and Crematory of Aberdeen has been entrusted with arrangements."
