John Charles Ford, J.D., passed away on Friday, January 19, 2024, surrounded by those who loved and cherished him most. He is survived by his brother, Paul Ford; his daughters, Mary Elisabeth Ford Bryant and Sarah Ford; and his son, John Charles Ford II. He is preceded in death by his late wife, Barbara Anne Ford.

A sharp wit with an even sharper tongue, John began his law career as a prosecutor before crossing the aisle to open his own successful law office as a self-employed defense attorney. He accomplished all this while also making time to sit on the bench as a judge whenever his services were requested.

When John wasn't busy yelling at the Green Bay Packers or the Indiana Hoosiers on TV, you could find him hunting, fishing, researching antique firearms, or driving his prized Jaguar around town.

A loyal family man, jokester, and puzzle master, John will be missed for his no-nonsense attitude, his inquisitive mind, and his fierce dedication and love for those around him.

A private celebration of life for John will be organized at a later date.
