        "text": "It's no secret: Chris Rock did not like being married. Or, if he did, he sure didn't sound like he did.\n\n\"Marriage is beautiful,\" he said in 2004, seven years after he said \"I do,\" \"but if you think you're going to hold onto your individual self, you're an idiot.\"\n\nRock's barbed riffs from an interview with NBC's Stone Phillips a decade ago sound like signs of trouble now that the 49-year-old actor has announced his impending divorce. Over the weekend, Rock and his wife of 17 years, Malaak Compton-Rock, a philanthropist with whom he has three children, said they would call it quits.\n\n\"Take yourself to the door and wave, 'Hey, see you later,' \" Rock told Phillips. \"You don't walk around the house like you're Stone Phillips. You're 'Her husband.' That's it.\"\n\nRock also expressed sympathy for an unlikely figure — al-Qaida's No. 1 — who he thought might be suffering in holy matrimony as well. \"Hey, if (Osama) bin Laden was here right now, he's going, 'Oh, yeah, my eight wives are killing me, too,' \" Rock said.\n\nNor did Rock portray a happy home in his hilarious riffs on marriage as sexless and miserable in his 2004 HBO special \"Never Scared.\"\n\n\"If you haven't contemplated murder, you ain't been in love'' he said at one point. \"If you haven't seriously thought about killing a motherf**ker, you ain't been in love. If you haven't had a can of rat poison in your hand and looked at it for 45 minutes straight, you ain't been in love ... If you haven't practiced your alibi in front of the mirror, you ain't been in love. And the only thing that's stopped you from killing this motherf**ker was an episode of CSI: 'Oh man, they thorough. I better make up. They might catch my ass.' ''\n\nEven a political saint who endured decades couldn't take the institution, Rock said. \"Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a South African prison ... Man can do hard labor in 100-degree South African heat for 27 years and did it with no problem. He got out of jail after 27 years of torture, spent six months with his wife and said, 'I can't take this (stuff) no more!' \"\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair two years ago, he had this to say: \"Married guys know more about women than single guys. Single guys have girlfriends. Girlfriends are always auditioning, always on their best behavior. Wives are like Supreme Court justices — they do whatever the f**k they want.''\n\nOf course, marriage has been a tried and true target for some long-married comedians, notably the late Henny Youngman of \"take my wife, please\" fame.\n\nRock's either sincere or played-up dissatisfaction went beyond remarks in an old comedy special and in decade-old interviews. After tabloids reported the Rocks were on the rocks in 2007, the couple took to the pages of People to deny the rumors. \"Though we have tried in the past to take the high road and not comment on the tabloid media, we find it necessary to express on record how unfortunate it is that the (New York) Daily News, specifically, and other tabloid outlets have chosen to print untrue rumors and lies about our family and marriage,\" the couple said in a statement. \"It is extremely hurtful to us, our children, and our extended family. We remain, as always, very happy and committed to our marriage and the beautiful family that we have built.\"\n\nYet these statements came not long after Rock directed, co-produced and — with the soon-to-be-divorced comedian Louis C.K. — co-wrote a film called I Think I Love My Wife. The premise: A man played by Rock trapped in a sexless marriage contemplates an affair. \"I've been married close to seven years,\" Rock said in a preview. \"My wife is beautiful, intelligent and a great mother. There's just one problem: We're bored out of our minds.\"\n\nIndeed, in Rock's comedy — as in material from Louis C.K., Larry David and Bill Cosby — marriage isn't just an institution worth a few jokes, but a kind of master-slave relationship worth skewering. For Rock, \"ball-and-chain\" seemed more than an expression.\n\n\"The most romantic words a man will ever say to you are these words: 'I ain't going nowhere,' \" Rock said in his concert film Kill the Messenger (2008). \"... When a man says 'I ain't going nowhere,' what he's trying to tell you is: 'I've actually thought about going somewhere. I talked to a lawyer. I looked at a place. And I realized I'm going to go through the same (stuff) with the next girl, so why not just stay here and be miserable with you?' ''"
