[moves to leave]\n\nBrenda Cooper:\n\nWhere you goin'?\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nTo get some duck!\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nYou know, some people say life is short and that you could get hit by a bus at any moment and that you have to live each day like it's your last. Bullshit. Life is long. You're probably not gonna get hit by a bus. And you're gonna have to live with the choices you make for the next fifty years.\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nBefore you get married you get calls like...\n\nBrenda Cooper:\n\nI can't wait to suck your dick.\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nAfter you get married you get calls like...\n\nBrenda Cooper:\n\nI can't wait for you come home to see these drapes.\n\n[Brenda sees Richard's erection as he's on the phone]\n\nBrenda Cooper:\n\nAre you talking to some little b*tch? Are you talking to some whore? In my house?\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nNo no no, it's George, it's George.\n\nBrenda Cooper:\n\nGeorge? What kind of down low sh*t is that?\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nWhen two people admit that they are attracted to each other, they are no longer in control. Their relationship has to play itself out. For better or for worse.\n\nRichard Cooper:\n\nLife is about choice. We are the sum of our choices. And most of them are made for us. You can't choose when you're born. You can't choose where you are born. You can't choose your family. You can't even choose who you love. But you can choose how you love."
