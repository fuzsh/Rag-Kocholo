        "text": "Listen to this article\n\nPartnerships aren’t cut and dry, with a consistent romantic connection on both sides at all times. To achieve this, each person needs to maintain that commitment, put in the effort and genuine hard work, and give the union sufficient time.\n\nSigns you’re not in love anymore or that the romantic connection is waning are when you no longer have the desire to nurture the relationship or find yourself paying less attention than the union craves.\n\nIt’s unfortunate (and hurts a mate), but you can fall out of love. The trauma for a partner will be devastating, but ideally, life will move on once they go through the stages of grief following the breakup.\n\nIdeally, you will try to recognize the signs you’re not in love anymore early to present the situation to your partner in as straightforward a way as possible, albeit compassionately.\n\nIs it normal to suddenly fall out of love?\n\nThe simple answer is no. If you think you have suddenly fallen out of love with your partner, maybe you mistook infatuation or attraction as love.\n\nPeople usually fall in love slowly and for a reason. Maybe your relationship has gone through something traumatic recently, or you have realized that you and your partner are not right for each other as time together has gone by.\n\nHowever, while falling out of love is normal, falling out of love all of a sudden is not.\n\nIf you feel like you loved your partner yesterday but don’t love them anymore today, you might want to think it through, and you are likely to see that falling out of love was more of a process than an overnight change.\n\n25+ signs that show you’re not in love anymore\n\nIn all honesty, mates can love each other and fall out of love with their partner often while in a long-term commitment. Everyone experiences ups and downs. Merely loving a person is not enough to sustain the couplehood.\n\nNurturing the partnership involves so many other “ingredients,” including communication, time, energy, undivided attention, and maintaining that sense of commitment. Once these things begin to fall away, it’s a sign that you’re not in love anymore.\n\nWhile that can happen periodically during a partnership, one person can reach their end at some point. How do you know you don’t love someone anymore? Look out for these signs.\n\n1. Lack of communication with no desire to try\n\nWhen you feel no desire to discuss anything, or you’ve pretty much stopped having conversations with your mate, it’s apparent there are no more feelings.\n\nConfirming you’re no longer in love would be having little interest when your significant other makes attempts to talk with you, and you, in turn, block them out as they’re expressing how they feel. While you may have the respect to respond to direct questions, there’s little else offered.\n\nThe foundation for a healthy union is communication. If you lack this component and have no wish to repair this aspect of the partnership, it’s a clear sign you’re not in love anymore.\n\n2. Avoidance or excuses combined with dread\n\nYou begin to wonder, “Am I not in love anymore?” when excitement to spend time with your mate turns to dread. There used to be anticipation, initiation of plans, anxious conversations, calls to hang out merely, and an interest in what they were up to each day.\n\nNow, there’s avoidance and excuses for why you can’t hang out.\n\nIn all likelihood, you’ll realize that you’re beginning to make other things a priority over your partner. Ignoring texts or silencing phone calls are also signs you’re not in love, and send that clear message to your mate.\n\n3. Becoming a complainer or being critical is something new\n\nAn unexplainable negative attitude towards any kind of change is also one of the signs you’re not in love anymore.\n\nIt can seem as though everything your partner does at this point irritates you. The mate can do nothing right. You find that you’re complaining all the time, which is something new for you but has been happening for some time.\n\nGenerally, you’re a laid-back, accessible person. Instead of continuing to be hard on your significant other, it’s essential to take a step back and look at yourself to determine, “Why am I not in love?” because that’s basically what this behavior should be saying to you.\n\nIt’s your way of validating your feelings. Your mate might genuinely not be doing anything wrong. You’re merely looking for things to find fault with so you can confirm for yourself why everything you once found endearing is now a source of annoyance.\n\n4. You mistook other feelings for love\n\nInfatuation is not genuinely love but has the potential for enduring a long-term, making people mistake it for love. The problem is that emotion is not sustainable in the same way that genuine love can be.\n\nIf you imply similar interests, goals, lifestyles, and values to develop the relationship, the charade doesn’t have the possibility of growing into something stable, meaning the feelings will ultimately fade.\n\nYou might have been in love with the notion of loving that person rather than ever falling in love with the mate. That will be difficult for your partner to hear and needs delicate handling.\n\n5. When you feel there’s a need for a break\n\nGenerally, when one person finds a need for a break away from the other person to have some “space” or to gain some time to “think about things,” one of those questions you’ll likely be considering is how to know if you’re not in love anymore.\n\nUltimately, taking this time apart is merely your way of gradually breaking away from the other person without officially calling it a breakup. Once there’s “space,” you’ll invariably find reasons why you can’t see the other person again, leading to the end.\n\n6. Making a ton of new friends\n\nIf you’re finding fulfillment with a new social circle outside of the relationship, that can signify that you’re not in love anymore when your mate is not providing the entertainment you desire.\n\nInstead, you’re finding fun and excitement with other people. That’s a definitive red flag that there are problems in the relationship.\n\nYou can undoubtedly have friends apart from your mate, but when you don’t find stimulation from a partner, instead looking for that attention, that “click,” or emotional validation elsewhere, you’ll know if you’re not in love anymore.\n\n7. Intimacy is virtually nonexistent\n\nIf you find that you’re no longer attracted to your mate, with intimacy at every level being the last thing on your mind, you’re indicating you’re not into your partner anymore.\n\nWhen you no longer touch your mate, whether it be a simple hug or a hand on their back, find sex to be a dreaded chore, or flinch when your mate reaches to touch you, these are signs you’re not in love anymore.\n\n8. Independence has become an important concept again\n\nIndependence is crucial and liberating, but when it becomes an exclusive concept in your relationship, it can be one of the signs you’re not really in love anymore.\n\nYou might be noticing that you’re becoming more independent again. Where you were incorporating your partner more into the various aspects of your daily life, now you’re beginning the elimination process to show yourself that you don’t need another person to handle life.\n\nWhen you’re in love, a mate’s guidance and advice are valuable. Even if you know you can handle whatever is thrown at you, support is essential and appreciated. Now, those things are viewed as interference.\n\n9. Discussing the future is no longer a topic\n\nFuture discussions are important for a healthy, long-term relationship. Its complete absence can be one of the sad signs you’re not in love anymore.\n\nWhen you’re not in love anymore, plans for the future are no longer relevant. Discussions that lead toward the subject make you disengage from the conversation.\n\nIn times past, you would perk up when your partner wanted to talk about the possibility of perhaps living together or a more profound commitment. Now, this lends itself to feelings of stress and pressure.\n\n10. You suspect you’re not in love anymore\n\nYour instincts might just be telling you that you’re not in love anymore. It’s essential to pay attention to your intuition. Before having the conversation with your mate, put considerable thought into whether there’s any possibility for working things through or perhaps there’s a future with them.\n\nWhen you can honestly admit to yourself that you no longer love the individual, listen to the voice. Avoid the notion of overthinking the issues and communicate your feelings.\n\nWhile it will be difficult, your mate will find a way to cope with their emotions and ultimately move forward.\n\n11. You can’t get yourself to care as much\n\nThere was a time when you were constantly worried about your partner – whether they ate, if they were okay, if they reached home safely, etc.\n\nNow, even as you may still want the best for them, you cannot get yourself to care about them as much as a partner should. This is one of the signs you are not in love with them anymore.\n\n12. You do not feel proud to be with them anymore\n\nRemember the time when you would flaunt your partner to everyone, whether it was your family or your friends?\n\nWell, that was because you were proud of being with them. One of the signs that you are not in love with them anymore is when you do not feel proud to call them yours for whatever reason.\n\n13. You compare them to others\n\nThere must have been a time when, in your eyes, your partner was the best partner there possibly could exist. However, as time goes by and as things in your relationship change, you find yourself comparing your partner to others, more often than not.\n\nYou are more focused on what they do not do, what they do wrong, and how others seem to get it right. This can be one of the signs that you have fallen out of love with them.\n\n14. No more dating\n\nA very tell-tale sign of falling out of love with your partner is when you are no longer dating each other. Maybe you have been in a relationship for years at this point, or maybe you have been married for a few years.\n\nHowever, it is recommended that even when you are in a long-term committed relationship, you continue to date your partner. If you do not plan hangouts, date nights, or events with your partner anymore, it could be a sign that you are not in love anymore.\n\n15. There is no progress in your relationship\n\nThe biggest mistake we make as couples is thinking that once we are in a committed relationship or married, we have reached the apex of a relationship. The reality, however, is different. As a couple, you keep growing, and so does your relationship.\n\nHowever, when you have fallen out of love with your partner, you might find yourself and your relationship stuck or stagnant.\n\n16. You stay with them so they do not get hurt\n\nThe reasons why you keep a relationship going are very vital to the health of the relationship.\n\nTherefore, when you stay with your partner because you do not want to hurt them, instead of because you love them, you know that while you may still care about their well-being, you are not in love with them anymore.\n\n17. You do not enjoy your time with them\n\nYour partner is supposed to be your best friend, your partner in crime, the person you look forward to being with or spending time with.\n\nHowever, when you do not want to spend time with them, and in fact, try to get out of it or find excuses to cut it short, it is a sign that you are not in love anymore.\n\n18. They are no longer a priority\n\nSo, how to know you’re not in love anymore?\n\nWhether it comes to small decisions or big life-changing ones, your partner is no longer a priority to you. That is how you know that you may not be in love with them anymore as not prioritizing your partner is one of the falling out of love signs.\n\n19. You do not fight anymore\n\nSome people might think that this is actually a sign of a healthy relationship and not a sign that you are not in love anymore.\n\nHowever, the fact that you do not argue, disagree, or fight anymore just goes on to say that maybe one of you doesn’t care about what is right or wrong in your relationship anymore. This can be a sign that you are not in love anymore.\n\n20. They are no more special to you\n\nIt is the love you have for someone that makes them so special; all of us are really very normal people otherwise.\n\nWhen you do not see them as something special anymore, it means that you may have fallen out of love with them.\n\n21. Lack of excitement and passion\n\nWhen you are in love, thinking about or spending time with your partner brings about a feeling of excitement and passion. However, if you are not in love anymore, you may notice that these feelings have faded.\n\nYou no longer feel that same level of excitement and passion when it comes to your relationship.\n\n22. Lack of emotional connection\n\nA strong emotional connection is a vital aspect of being in love. It involves feeling deeply connected to your partner, understanding each other’s emotions, and being able to empathize and support one another.\n\nIf you no longer feel this emotional connection, it could be one of the signs you don’t love him anymore.\n\n23. Lack of effort in the relationship\n\nLove requires effort and investment from both partners. When you are in love, you are willing to put in the time, energy, and attention needed to maintain a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nHowever, if you find that you no longer want to make an effort to nurture the partnership, it could indicate that your feelings have changed.\n\n24. No future vision with your partner\n\nWhen you are in love, you typically see a future with your partner. You envision growing old together, making plans, and setting goals as a couple.\n\nHowever, if you no longer see your partner in your future plans or feel like they are not a part of your long-term vision, it may be a sign that you have fallen out of love.\n\n25. Feeling relieved or indifferent when apart\n\nA clear sign that you are not in love anymore is when you feel a sense of relief or indifference when you are apart from your partner. Instead of missing them or eagerly anticipating their presence, you may feel a sense of freedom or detachment when you have time away from them.\n\n26. Desire to explore or be with other people\n\nWhen you are in love, your partner is typically the object of your desire and affection. However, if you find yourself fantasizing about or longing for other people, it indicates that your feelings may have changed.\n\nHaving a strong desire to explore connections with other individuals or feeling like you are missing out on different experiences can be a sign that you are not in love with your current partner.\n\n5 common reasons why people fall out of love\n\nThere can be various situations where people fall out of love with each other. Here are some reasons why people fall out of love with their partner.\n\n1. You fight too much\n\nFighting sometimes, arguing, or disagreeing with your partner is very normal in a relationship. If fighting is all you do, you might end up falling out of love with your partner, or they might.\n\nThis is because fighting can cause stress, and you just want to avoid it. When you do that, you end up bottling your emotions. You realize that you do not see eye to eye on almost anything, and gradually, you may find yourself falling out of love with them.\n\n2. You fell in love with someone else\n\nAnother reason why some people fall out of love with their partner is because they fall in love with someone else.\n\nWhether or not they do something about it, make a move, or confess their feelings to this other person is a different conversation. Just being in love with someone else can be enough reason to fall out of love with your current partner.\n\n3. Your relationship went through something traumatic\n\nIt could be infidelity, the death of a dear one, or any major incident in your life that has the potential to change your emotional DNA to the point where you start to view your life and your relationship differently.\n\nWhen we go through something huge like that, we may start to see that the person we are with now versus the person we fell in love with or thought that we loved is different. You might not want to stay in love with them anymore.\n\n4. You feel unappreciated\n\nAnother reason you might find yourself falling out of love with your partner is when you feel unaccepted or unappreciated.\n\nOne of the prerequisites of a romantic relationship is to feel appreciated and accepted by the person you are with. If that starts to fade away, you might find yourself falling out of love with them.\n\n5. Your needs aren’t met\n\nIn a relationship, feeling fulfilled and having your needs met is crucial. If you find that your emotional, physical, or even communication needs consistently go unaddressed, you may begin to feel disconnected.\n\nWhen your partner doesn’t meet these essential requirements, the sense of dissatisfaction can grow, and over time, you might find yourself falling out of love. It’s a natural response to feeling unfulfilled and seeking a relationship that better aligns with your needs.\n\nHow to reconnect with your partner when falling out of love\n\nWhen you see the signs that you are falling out of love with your partner, you will find yourself at a crossroads.\n\nThis is the time you decide whether you want to work on the relationship and reconnect with your partner or break it to them that you no longer love them so that the both of you can decide the way forward.\n\nAcknowledging the problems in the relationship, spending more time with each other, communicating better, and seeking professional help are some of the ways to reconnect with your partner.

Ideally, you will have given the partnership sufficient time to ensure you’re not hasty about your feelings.\n\nSomething attracted you to this person, so you need to take considerable time to revisit, albeit not overthink, before having the conversation.\n\nOnce you’ve gone over all the signs, you’re not in love anymore, finding validation; after all, it’s essential to be straightforward so no false hope is taken from the communication. It isn’t the time for sugarcoating or white lies to protect or send mixed messages.\n\nIf this is the case, it would be respectful to allow your ex-mate to know that you care for them but do not share romantic love in the way they would like you to. Kindness is appropriate, and honesty is vital.\n\nConcentrate on the present and make no indications regarding the future. The ex-mate will likely need support and undoubtedly has friends and family available for those needs.\n\nYou need not withdraw too harshly and take caution in offering a great deal of support with the status change in the partnership.\n\nWatch this video to know whether a breakup might be nice for you:\n\nFAQs\n\nUnderstanding your emotions in a relationship is complex. It’s common to question feelings and wonder about the impact of anxiety or comfort on your love life. Let’s explore some relatable answers.\n\nIs it possible to fall out of love?\n\nYes. Some people view love as an emotion, and while it is true, love is also seen as intentional and, at the end of the day, as a choice.\n\nSome people might feel disconnected from their partner for several reasons. They might also feel or may already have fallen out of love with their partner. However, it is possible to reel yourself back into the relationship and fall in love with your partner again.\n\nCan overthinking make you fall out of love?\n\nOverthinking can create unnecessary doubt and stress.

Finding ways to manage over-thinking is key.\n\nWhy do I feel nothing in my relationship?\n\nFeeling emotionally numb can stem from various factors like stress or emotional exhaustion.

Evaluate if comfort has led to complacency or if deeper issues exist. Healthy communication and efforts to keep the relationship dynamic can reignite the spark.\n\nHow can you cope with the pain of losing love?\n\nCoping with the pain of losing love is a difficult process, but there are strategies to help navigate through it. Firstly, allow yourself to grieve and acknowledge your emotions. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can provide a listening ear.\n\nEngage in self-care activities that promote healing, such as exercise or practicing mindfulness. Consider seeking professional help from a therapist to process your emotions. Focus on personal growth and finding new hobbies or interests to fill the void.\n\nFinally, give yourself time and be patient, as healing takes time.\n\nBe clear on your stance\n\nEach of you will ultimately realize you both deserve to find the romantic love you long for with a partner with whom you share these feelings. It’s okay if this is not the one."
