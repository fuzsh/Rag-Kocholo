        "text": "Chris Rock, 49, may be one of the world’s most acclaimed comedians, but his résumé of studio hits hasn’t always reflected the hard-hitting, irreverent comedy his fans love. That won’t be a problem come this Friday, when “Top Five,” a movie Rock wrote, directed and stars in, is released.\n\nIn the film, he plays a comedic star best known for wearing a bear costume, who is now attempting a fresh start as a serious actor in a movie about a slave revolt — not exactly an easy transition.\n\nBen Vereen, the 68-year-old “Roots” star and Broadway legend, features in the stacked cast as Rock’s less-than-perfect dad, playing alongside Rosario Dawson, Tracy Morgan and Kevin Hart.\n\nThe Post caught up with Rock and Vereen to talk legacy, reinvention and White Castle.\n\nChris, this is your third time directing a feature. How was it different?\n\nChris Rock: Well, first of all, I didn’t know what the hell I was doing with my previous [movies]. You learn on the job. The first movie I directed, “Head of State,” I was in love with my script. I didn’t know it’s bad to fall in love with your script. Your script’s a blueprint. It’s not the end all, be all.\n\nI was just setting out to make something really small and honest. Honestly, getting the money for the movie was never really a concern for me. I was more than ready to do it with my own money. I mean, I wouldn’t have spent $8 million, but I could have made this for under a million or something.\n\nBen Vereen: And what’s so beautiful about this, [for any price,] we all would have came.\n\nRock: I think about that. If I’d have done this movie for nothing, I’d have probably had most of the same cast!\n\nChris’ character Andre Allen is a comedic star who wants to be taken seriously as an actor. How do you relate to that?\n\nRock: Nobody wants to be known for one thing. That’s basically what it all boils down to — even when you’re great at something. This guy [gestures to Vereen] is one of the greatest dancers to ever live. But you’ve got a hunger. You want to be known as an actor. Me, I’m a stand-up. Okay, can I direct something as good as I do stand-up? Can I act? You want to test yourself. Especially in this business, because if you only do one thing . . .\n\nVereen: You’re pigeonholed. And they expect that . . . I still get, ‘You’re such a great dancer!’ What about my other body of work? [Laughs.] Did you see Chicken George?\n\nIn the movie, Allen’s haunted by a comedy franchise he wants to break free from, “Hammy the Bear.” What’s your Hammy?\n\nRock: I don’t really have a thing that haunts me. [But] I mean, I am the zebra in “Madagascar.” No matter what I do, honestly, that’s the most popular thing I have ever done and will ever do.\n\nVereen: Mine’s [“Roots” character] Chicken George.\n\nRock: Thank God for Chicken George.\n\nVereen: Thank God for [“Roots” author] Alex Haley. [Laughs.]\n\nHow much of yourselves do you bring to your parts?\n\nVereen: I think it’s kind of hard to detach. You’ve got to be involved. You’ve got to be in it to bring it.\n\nRock: There’s a lot of me in there . . . [Like if] you cast me as a UPS guy, I’m going to be the funny UPS guy. I’ll be the funniest guy down in UPS. I guess Daniel Day-Lewis gets paid to transform into something else.\n\nMaybe there’s like four other actors that get paid to play other people. But most of us get paid to play different versions of ourselves.\n\nThe movie shot all over New York — including East Harlem. How was that?\n\nVereen: I brought my bodyguards, you know. [Laughs.]\n\nRock: I had lunch with Rosario at White Castle. [Both laugh.]\n\nVereen: The community was wonderful. They watched and they were quiet and they were really appreciative, I think, that we were in the community.\n\nChris, did you look to other NY films for inspiration?\n\nRock: Of course all the Woody — “Manhattan,” “Stardust Memories,” “Broadway Danny Rose.” But have you ever seen Hype Williams’ “Belly”? It’s not the best movie, but it looks amazing. I watched it without the sound a lot.\n\nThe film’s title refers to characters naming their top five lists, such as their top five rappers. Where’d that concept come from?\n\nRock: It’s just this thing I always see when I’m at a barbershop. Guys making sports lists — top five running backs, top five guitar players. Hey, top five dancers of all time — Ben Vereen, Gregory Hines!\n\nWhat does a person’s top five say about them?\n\nRock: First of all, it tells you how old they are. I don’t care how old you look, your references always give you away. If you see a girl and she looks 30, and she starts talking about Chaka Khan, she’s 50."
