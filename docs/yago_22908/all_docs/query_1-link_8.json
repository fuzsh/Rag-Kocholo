        "text": "DVD Rentals - Disturbing News on the Rental Charts\n\nAugust 19th, 2007\n\nDisturbia led a large group of new releases and took first place on the rental charts with $9.70 million in rentals. More...\n\nDVD Sales - 300 Does Double Duty at Number One\n\nAugust 19th, 2007\n\nDespite a busy week for new releases, 300 was able to stay on top of the DVD sales chart. This should really surprise no one as it has been tough this year for any DVD to move more than 1 million units in a single week, and with first week sales of more than 5 million units, even a sharp drop-off would leave 300 in first place. And it did have a sharp drop-off, down more than 70% to 1.50 million units sold this week for a total of 6.60 million after two. This works out to $149.82 million in total sales, which is close to the film's entire theatrical haul. More...\n\nDVD Releases for August 7, 2007\n\nAugust 6th, 2007\n\nWow. What a busy week. Not only do we have dozens of releases (many of them Elvis related), we have nine spotlight reviews. There aren't as many contenders for DVD Pick of the Week, however. The two that stand out the most are The Muppet Show - Season Two and The Simpsons - Season 10. The Muppet Show is the better show while The Simpsons has better extras. Call it a tie and both are this week's DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nMoviegoers Cheer Mutant Good Guys\n\nMarch 27th, 2007\n\nSix wide releases in a single weekend appears to have been at least three too many as most struggled at the box office. On the other hand, with so many new films opening and so many different demographics being targeted, it was a good week at the box office overall with receipts hitting $133 million, up 14% from last week and 22% from last year. Year-to-date revenue has already hit $2 billion and is clocking in at nearly 6% higher than last year's pace. More importantly, the number of big hits is increasing interest, and that can have a positive effect on future earnings. I feel confident in saying records will fall this year. More...\n\nSpartans Bend to Competition, but do not Buckle\n\nMarch 19th, 2007\n\nThis proved to be a double milestone weekend, and a record breaker at that. Two films, 300 and Wild Hogs hit $100 million this weekend. Wild Hogs reached that milestone on Sunday the 18th of March, making it the earliest in a year for three new releases to have crossed $100 million. (The previous record was in 2003 when Daredevil made it there early in April.) Overall the box office was also hot, taking in $118 million. Granted, that is down 23% from last weekend, but it was up 10% from the same weekend last year, which is a much more important figure. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: 300 Crashes, But Doesn't Burn\n\nMarch 18th, 2007\n\nMovie Website Updates for March 10 - March 16, 2007\n\nMarch 17th, 2007\n\nWe are starting to get some serious updates on the websites for the summer blockbusters, however, it will be a few more weeks before this list is dominated by such films. In the meantime, it is a website for a new release, Dead Silence - Official Site, that is the winner of the Weekly Website Award. More...\n\nSpartans Try to Hold Box Office Against Whelming Odds\n\nMarch 15th, 2007\n\nThree wide releases are opening this weekend, but none seem to have what it takes to overtake 300. On the other hand, none look like they will bomb either with all three tracking to finish in the top five. Even more importantly, the overall box office looks robust and should have an easy time keeping up with last year's pace. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for March 3 - March 9, 2007\n\nMarch 10th, 2007\n\nWe are starting to see more and more summer blockbusters launching or updating their websites. However, this week it was still a spring release taking top spot as The Fracture - Official Site won the Weekly Website Award. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for February 24 - March 2, 2007\n\nMarch 2nd, 2007\n\nJust an average week in terms of updates, but there are a couple sites of note including the winner of the Weekly Website Award, Wild Hogs - Official Site. More...\n\n2007 Preview: March\n\nMarch 1st, 2007\n\nMarch, a month without a holiday. In fact, It's the only month without any holidays to help boost the box office and this prevents studios from releasing big blockbusters. However, it is not the weakest month either and there are a few midlevel hits coming out over the next four weeks and even a couple that could top $100 million More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for February 10 - February 16, 2007\n\nFebruary 17th, 2007\n\nWhile the big summer blockbusters are sill M.I.A., there are plenty of other films to pick up the slack. This includes this week's winner, Bridge to Terabithia - Official Site. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - October 15, 2006\n\nOctober 15th, 2006"
