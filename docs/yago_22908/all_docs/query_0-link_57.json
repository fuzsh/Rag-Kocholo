        "text": "If it is your intention to see Chris Rock's new movie because you are hoping for 90 minutes of outrageous stand-up comedy, you are in for a very rude awakening.\n\nChris Rock co-wrote, stars in, and directs, \"I Think I Love My Wife,\" and he almost pulls off the hat trick. This movie rolls, is emotionally revealing, funny and oftentimes a bit vulgar, but what it clearly proves is that Chris Rock is much more than a comedian.\n\nChris Rock can act.\n\nRock's character literally develops the 7-year-marriage itch, but he earnestly only wishes to scratch that itch with his wife. Along comes the incredibly attractive and presently available former best friend's girlfriend and we have all the necessary ingredients for the problems that befall men.\n\nWatch the trailer:\n\nRock then spends the balance of the movie explaining the urge, fighting the urge, and genuinely describing to his family, his friends, his co-workers, and to us why this dilemma is such a common occurrence.\n\nAnd he's right on all counts. If you either had the 7-year itch, or lived the 7-year itch you'll end up reliving your own life while squirming in your theater seat.\n\nThe movie's only mistake is its final two minutes which should cause movie goers to wonder if they aren't watching, \"Dream Girls.\"\n\nIt made no sense whatsoever and ruined a great flick."
