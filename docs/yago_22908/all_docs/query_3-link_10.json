        "text": "ops0413\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nMarried, Had an affair and deeply in love.. what now?\n\nThis is a long story but I will try to keep it brief. I’ve been married for five years, we’ve been together for ten. We have two beautiful children whom I love dearly. My wife is an amazing woman and I couldn’t ask for a better mother to my children. She has always remained faithful to me.\n\nI on the other hand have been unfaithful on a few occasions. What started off as a few one night stands led to an affair with a co-worker that lasted 3 months. The day my wife found out about the affair was one of the worse days of my life. We attended counselling and over time she managed to forgive me. I also attended individual counseling in an attempt to find out why I engage in this type of behaviour.\n\nI realize the majority of you think very little of me at this point.. but it gets worse...\n\nThings were great between my wife and I for 2 full years after this affair, until I met someone else in August. What started off as friendly text messages turned into flirting.. sex and so on. I will refer to this woman as KM. I told KM I was married and had no intention of walking away from my family. She was fine with it at first but it didn’t take long for us to get attached. I was away from home with work for a few months and her and I talked every day. She is a single mom with a son the same age as mine. We have since fallen in love and can’t get enough of each other. We have tried to break things off once before but it was too painful so we ended up back in the same place. I have been neglecting my marriage as a result of this affair and I feel terrible for it. My wife has no idea what is going on and would definitely leave me if she found out (as she should).\n\nKM and I had a fight on Friday where she told me she can no longer be the other woman. She wants me all to herself and if I won’t leave my wife then we need to go our separate ways. I have been completely distraught over this and have not been able to contain my emotions.\n\nI am at a loss as to what I should be doing.. if I confess to the Affair, my marriage is over and i will destroy the otherwise good relationship I have with my wife. If I leave my marriage to be with KM, I’m worried I may regret that decision down the road if things don’t work out between us. At the same time I am deeply in love with this woman and the thought of letting her go kills me...\n\nI realize that a lot of you would have a lot of bad things to say about me given everything I’ve done.. I know I’m a dirt bag for being unfaithful and my wife deserves a whole lot better than me.\n\nI am here asking for help... because I’m a mess at this point and need some guidance. Thank you for hearing me out.\n\nDating\n\nRespond to ops0413\n\nWhy are you reporting this question\n\nIt's spam\n\nIt's a duplicate\n\nIt's offensive\n\nIt's not a valid question or answer\n\nIt's not written in English\n\nOther\n\nKYD93\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nI would take this opportunity to tell you what you did was wrong but you already acknowledged that you're a piece of shit so i don't have to. Your wife deserves to know about this and frankly deserves better than you. She gave you a very very rare second chance and you still ruined that. You need to be straightforward, man up and tell her. Prepare yourself to go through a divorce and start looking for another place\n\ntomodachi58\n\nHighly agreeable\n\nIf you're looking for sympathy, you can find it in Merriam Websters between shit and syphilis.\n\nwytchinghours\n\nTop poster\n\nA blog wanting us to feel sorry for a cheater..................\n\nTell your wife what she thinks also have her get checked for STD's.\n\ncolette\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nYou should tell your wife and let her leave you so she has a shot at a decent life. You should get with KM so you can have someone new to cheat on. There is no point in you asking for help as you aren't willing to change.\n\nYou like the thought of being passionately in love. You don't actually know how to love someone. Not your wife, not your children, and ultimately KM won't give you the thrill you are addicted to either.\n\ncd5love96\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nGreat example to set for your son. You will never be content in any relationship.\n\njtsweets27\n\nVery agreeable\n\n@cd5love96\n\nExactly. You keep on talking about how this would affect you, your wife, and your mistress. You mentioned you'd lose your \"friendship\" with your wife. Ok, so what's going wrong in your marriage that you keep on straying? If things are good but not \"great\" with your wife and there's no abuse, affairs, and/or addictions from your wife, then stop getting mistresses and stick it out with your wife until your son is 18, up and out.\n\nDevWife\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nI'm not sure what you expect the internet to tell you that you don't already know, or haven't been told through therapy.\n\nYou are too selfish to care about or love any woman. And, frankly, you don't seem to care too much in what you are doing to your children, either.\n\nYour wife deserves to be happy. You need to get back into therapy.\n\nkenmele\n\nTrusted Poster\n\nIt is clear that you cannot be faithful to your wife. And very likely, if you leave her for this new women, very likely you will find yourself in the same position down the line. You have to face your personal problems and do better. You lack the empathy for their suffering. Also, you lack any kind of control when offered a new relationship. I get it, the love of a new woman can be like a drug. But you need to concentrate on the man you want to be. That has to be on your mind and important to you.\n\nYour marriage is already over. You dont love your wife. If you did love her you would be incapable of causing her so much pain. Yet the only pain you refer to is the pain you felt when you and your mistress tried to break it off\n\nYour son will know his father is a cheater who has no integrity and whose dick is more important than his wife/family\n\nyou made your bed and now you have to lie in it, and someone is going to get hurt all because of you.\n\nCody49\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nIf you believe your wife doesn't know then you're in denial. Deep down she will know especially as you have put her through this before.\n\nAll I see in this is the word \"I\" you have not given any consideration to your wife and children. You are not only cheating on her but your children also.\n\nIt seems to me you are hedging your bets, which one will stay around. You're doting wife who has forgiven before? Or the unknown tart who has willingly broken up a family to meet her own needs. It seems to me you cannot be on you own and you can't decide which one will jump ship the fastest.\n\nI think you are being extremely selfish and not sure why you are asking for help, I think you just want to show off you have 2 women in your life.\n\nIn reality both relationships are doomed. Your wife will never trust you again and the tart won't trust you either because if you can do it to your wife and children you can do it to her. She's in denial if she thinks she is special and has changed you. You need to admit you're a cheater and always will be.\n\nYou need to stop thinking of yourself and leave your wife so she can build up her life again and meet someone who adores her and her children. They deserve better, someone who appreciates that family and will be a good role model, you've just discarded of your family like a piece of trash - They deserve more.\n\nWith regards to the other woman, she deserves everything that comes her way. Stick with her because it will be a disaster anyway and she deserves to feel what your wife has felt.\n\nYou are both selfish and self centered and actually sound like you're a perfect match. You can both rot in your own self pity and \"love\" for eachother. If you truly loved and respected your wife you never would have cheated in the first place.\n\nI have little doubt that choosing to divorce and marry the affair would leave you in a similar situation in another ten years.\n\nI do not think it's \"love\" you're experiencing with either woman as what I would call love supersedes the need to flirt, chat, see others. I'm almost certain marrying the other woman would only lead to more heartbreak for the women, the children and you.\n\nConsider this.... drop BOTH women until you can understand why you are incapable of loyalty, faithfulness and being devoted to the wife and child you have before running off and trying to be husband and father to another set.\n\nIt would be hard to drop the other woman to work on my marriage but I fear if you don't do it soon, you will eventually drop her later for some other \"other woman\" down the road.\n\nIf you can't fix what you have, trading it in for another won't solve anything.\n\nops0413\n\nAskMen Reader\n\n@mossgard\n\nThank you for your input... you’ve given me a lot to think about.\n\nI am guessing that you quit going to therapy and never really discovered the reason why you behave so terribly.\n\nThe day your wife found out about your affair was the worst day of your life?\n\nHow do you think she felt?\n\nWhy do you only think of yourself?\n\nWhy do you love inflicting pain on others?\n\nYou need to leave both women and seek therapy.\n\nAB13\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nGo to marriage counseling and come clean and I would tell her in a session if possible. Your spouse deserves to know the truth and decide if she can forgive you and move on. It would be a deal breaker for me, not because of rage but because I couldn't genuinely forgive my partner and move on without punishing them. So don't let her punish you either if that's how she ends up feeling because your marriage would still be over and highly unhealthy. Do the right thing, accept responsibility and all the possible repercussions and good luck.\n\nS99\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nStop right where you are go get counselling and block KM and change phone numbers if you must and get back with your wife your acting like the Randy ****s in my high school classes little bastard and I ain’t going to give you no sympathy looser\n\nS99\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nOh one simple answer THErAPY tell you therapist that whole thing you were asking us THERAPY\n\nNatural\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nI don`t know why you marry and want to be in relationships that are supposed to be exclusive??? Why didn`t you choose women who want to be in open relationships? That would seem to have better fitted your way of living.\n\nYou will not be faithful to your mistress either, so stay with your wife and love her.\n\nCler16\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nLike the other responses, I am not going to mince words here. You obviously are someone who always thinks the grass looks greener elsewhere. Do your wife a favor, tell her the truth and divorce her. Just be fair with her in the divorce settlement. She hasn't trusted you since you cheated the first time. How could she? I am sure she stayed with you for the children or for financial reasons. Give her the chance to find someone who truly loves and respects her and the marriage.\n\nAs for your children, you have already damaged them for life. You don't provide their ages or sex but know this - they will find out what you have done. They may be too young to know now, but as they age they will overhear a family member or friend of the family talk about your poor wife and what you put her through.\n\nIf you have daughters, you will have taught them to look for men as lowlife as you are. They will think that is all they deserve because they saw their mother put up with it. If you have sons, you are leading by example and this is likely how they will treat future girlfriends and wives. I have seen this play out too many times with friends who have cheating parents.\n\nRegarding your side piece who now is demanding you leave your wife, I suspect this was her plan all along. You do not mention finances but I will bet that you have more money than her. Why shouldn't she want to improve her financial situation? She obviously has zero morals (like you) and will do whatever necessary to get ahead. I recommend that you have a strong prenup if you marry her. She'll be on too the next guy before too long, maybe even before you move on to your next side piece.\n\nIf you marry her, that will also contribute to the complete destruction of your relationship with your children. Every single day they will look at her knowing that she was the woman you were banging on the side. You will throw your disrespect for their mother and the family you had in their face.\n\nCongratulations. You have managed to screw up your life in a pretty spectacular manner.\n\njaeleah\n\nAskMen Reader\n\nThere are a lot of folks who will point out all the negatives using society’s “rules” about love. Remember, there are no rules in Love. Society is here so that we all propagate the species...it does not imply that not following society’s “rules” means you are a bad person. You are merely unfulfilled. So clear your conscious by choosing love or choosing duty. It appears that you cannot have both. Choose the kindest way to move on, or you will never know what your right answer is. You can’t be happy with the wife;that is clear. But there is no guarantee that the mistress will fulfill you down the road. You have to be willing to take the chance on love, or you will never be happy."
