        "text": "MARBLEHEAD, Mass.\n\nIN a sumptuous beach-side house here in this coastal community north of Boston, surrounded by sand, grass, ocean and all the DVDs one could ask for, Chris Rock was feeling cooped up. “I haven’t done any dirty work in a while,” he said through the Nike-swoosh of a smirk on his face. “I’m ready to curse. I’m ready to really, really be a bad boy. I’m ready to actually be Chris Rock.”\n\nOn a recent morning Mr. Rock, the 47-year-old comedian and actor, was waiting to be called into work on “Grown Ups 2,” a sequel to the lucrative (if critically derided) Adam Sandler comedy about reunited school pals, which he’s been filming since May. Nothing else coming up on his schedule is emblematically Rock-like either, from his role in Julie Delpy’s “2 Days in New York” — a sequel to her film “2 Days in Paris,” opening Friday, in which he plays her live-in boyfriend who is overwhelmed by the arrival of her French relatives — to his work as executive producer of a new FX talk show, “Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell.”\n\nFeeling compelled to engage with live audiences again — “It’s time for me to hit the stage or something,” Mr. Rock said — he dove into this conversation as if it were a warm-up act. He was in an expansive, reflective but talkative mood, eager to discuss his career trajectory; why he says “Grown Ups” is better than “The Artist”; recent controversies in comedy (including one he started); and what could keep him from returning to the stand-up clubs anytime soon. Whether he was double-fisting glasses of lemonade and Starbucks coffee, sprawled out on a couch or falling to his knees (as sometimes happens when he gets worked up), Mr. Rock was endlessly animated and never, ever shy with his feelings."
