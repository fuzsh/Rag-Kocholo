        "text": "For the longest time, I thought it was Hollywood's fault. Here was the enigma of Chris Rock, a truly funny, energetic comedian, being thrown into such cinematic compost as \"CB4,\" \"Pootie Tang\" and \"Head of State.\"\n\nI had hoped that his latest film, \"I Think I Love My Wife,\" would be different, considering the comedian co-wrote the script and directed the film.\n\nI'm sad to report, however, that not even Chris Rock gets Chris Rock.\n\nThe plot is the stuff of many a (bad) romantic comedy. Rock plays a 7-year-itched husband who cannot seem to cajole his wife into having sex with him anymore. This leads to his eye roving lecherously to every woman who happens to pass his way.\n\nCoincidentally, Nikki (the stunning Kerry Washington), an old girlfriend of one of Rock's friends, pops into his life, and (surprise surprise) marital strife and zany hijinks ensue. The film can't quite figure out if it's a comedy or a drama. Rock seems to straddle the line between the two with disastrous results.\n\nYou're supposed to feel for Rock's predicament, but every scene with his wife is a setup for the next scene with Nikki. It all rolls into one predictable mess.\n\nAnd some of the jokes simply fall flat, especially a not-so-subtle Viagra moment. Add to that the utter misuse of great actors like Steve Buscemi, Edward Herrmann and Orlando Jones, and you have all the ingredients of a gym-sock souffle of a movie.\n\nThere are a few things about the film that rescue it from total implosion. The female leads, Gina Torres and Kerry Washington, are quite good. And to say there are no laugh-out-loud moments would do it a disservice, but they are sporadic at best, and lack the edge of Rock's stand-up routines.\n\nNot even the music of the diabolical Biz Markie can save this mess."
