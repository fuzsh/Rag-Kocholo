        "text": "Sadly, Julie Worrall passed away on Sunday, December 17, 2023 at White Rapids Manor in Fredericton Junction. She was born in Baie Sainte Anne to Marie Claire (Landry) and Amond Martin on December 8, 1932. Seven years later when her father died, she and her four younger siblings moved to Pointe Sapin in the care of their Uncle Henry. Meanwhile her mother worked as domestic help and managed to visit the children on Sundays. Julie grew up fast and had responsibilities beyond her years.\n\nWhen she turned 16 Julie found employment in Chatham. This was where she met the love of her life, Sanford Worrall. They married before Sanford \"Sonny\" deployed to the Korean Conflict. While Sonny was in Korea Julie lived with his parents where she learned how to speak English. Sonny returned a year later and sons, Keith and George, were born 12 months apart. As a military wife Julie was no stranger to moving around Canada and Europe. She became very independent in these years. She raised her boys with pride and supported her husband in his military career. She worked at Base Gagetown for many years as kitchen and dining room staff. Later she worked at York Drug Store in Fredericton where she had a huge cosmetics clientele.\n\nJulie was a Life Member in the Ladies Auxiliary of Branch #93 Royal Canadian Legion. She loved her years of involvement in the Oromocto Hospital Auxiliary, especially her time in the gift shop. Julie sang in the choir at the Wesley United Church and always took a role on the Board of Directors. If her grandchildren participated in sports, she was on the sidelines cheering them on, always so proud of their efforts.\n\nOver the years, Julie and Sonny travelled a great deal to visit their sons and families. George (Cindy) lives in Calgary which was a favourite destination. There they visited their granddaughters Melanie (DJ) and Stephanie (Frank). They celebrated many special occasions with them.\n\nKeith (Bonnie) added to their travels with military postings across Canada, to England and Cyprus. They never missed an opportunity to be with their grandsons, Deryk (Rula), Kraig (Jennifer) and Sam (Ashlyn).\n\nJulie is fondly known as Super Nanny to her great grandchildren Brayden, Jeremy, Sebastian, Zoë, Declan, Alice and Erik. Julie has one great great grandchild, Calem!\n\nJulie was the last surviving member of her family, predeceased by her siblings Agnes, Madeleine, Madore and Michel. She was also predeceased by her husband, Sanford Ralph Worrall \"Sonny\" and her daughter-in-law, Cindy (Gilroy) Worrall. Julie was happy when George found a new partner, Carole Smoke, to share his life.\n\nHer sons Keith and George Worrall and families have many fond memories of her as there were so many adventures with great food (mainly lobster) and laughter along the way. At 91 she continued to be a voracious reader. She loved great books! Her other interests included clogging, yoga, knitting, golf and of course, Sonny. Seldom would we see one without the other. She was an amazing wife, mom, nanny and super nanny! She would lovingly look at pictures of family and knew their names and interests. In the end she would do roll call and say she loved each of us, then add, “I’m so lucky!” We miss her already!\n\nWe would like to thank the staff at White Rapids Manor for providing Julie a home. She was shown such kindness and friendship while at WRM!\n\nThere will be no services at this time. A private family interment will take place in Oromocto Pioneer Gardens in the spring. For those who wish, donations in Julie's memory can be made to the Oromocto Food Bank or a charity of the donor's choice."
