They are the parents of seven children: Suzanne Kronsberg, spouse Brian Kronsberg; Thomas Ferreira, spouse Jane Ferreira; Mark Ferreira, spouse Melissa Ferreira; David Ferreira, spouse Sally Ferreira; Patrick Ferreira, spouse Nancy Ferreira; Patricia Tolan, spouse William Tolan; and Gary Ferreira. They have 18 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren.\n\nThey have had the courage and the faith to walk hand-in-hand along the path of their lives together. After 60 years, they are still partners in everything they do. They were married on Horace’s birthday and he celebrates 80 years on earth this same day. The blessings also continue for this day as their twins, Pat and Patty were also born on May 31.\n\nTheir love for each other is a beacon for their children and their grandchildren and their great grandchildren. Sixty years of memories built together, a foundation of love for their family.."
