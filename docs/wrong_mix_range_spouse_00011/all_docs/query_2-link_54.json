        "text": "Romeo is the only child of Lord and Lady Montague. When we first meet him, he believes he is in love with Rosaline, but then he meets Juliet at a party. They instantly fall in love and are married in secret the next day. The pair are separated after Romeo kills Tybalt and is banished. A plan to reunite them goes wrong when Romeo believes Juliet is dead. At the end of the play, Romeo kills himself.\n\nFacts we learn about Romeo at the start of the play:\n\nHe didn’t take part in the street brawl with the Capulets.\n\nHe is depressed because he loves Rosaline but she does not love him back.\n\nHe agrees to go to the party with his friends to prove to them that Rosaline is the most beautiful woman there.\n\nJuliet is the only child of Lord and Lady Capulet. She has been promised in marriage to Paris. At a party, she meets Romeo and instantly falls in love with him, even though he is her ‘enemy’ and a Montague. Juliet marries Romeo in secret the next day but they are separated after Romeo kills her cousin Tybalt. In order to avoid marrying Paris, Juliet fakes her own death. Romeo believes her to be dead and kills himself. When she wakes up, and discovers his body, Juliet stabs herself with his dagger.\n\nFacts we learn about Juliet at the start of the play:\n\nShe is thirteen years old.\n\nShe has yet to be introduced to society.\n\nShe intends to obey her parents’ wishes.\n\nFriar Laurence is a Franciscan monk. We first meet him the morning after the party when Romeo goes to him for permission to marry Juliet. Despite telling Romeo to slow down, he agrees to marry the young couple, as he believes it may be a way to end the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets. Later in the play, when Romeo is banished for killing Tybalt, Friar Laurence sends him to Mantua.
