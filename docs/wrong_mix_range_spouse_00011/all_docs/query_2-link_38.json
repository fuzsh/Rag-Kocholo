        "text": "Do perfect relationships exist? As a young adult, I was lucky to have many grown ups around me who had candid conversations about what relationships entail. I also learnt early from observing the relationships in my immediate community that your imagination of what doing life with someone looks like and actually doing life with them have few things in common. During the marriage ceremony when the minister teaches on marriage being the only institution you get a certificate before doing the actual work, quite a number of people view that speech as an effort by the minister to demonstrate their wit and eloquence. However, many later understand the truth in those words as their relationships develop. I find that romantic relationships, just like friendships, require consistent hard work and conscious deliberate decisions. I'm often asked questions by mentees and friends that show that they believe I have the perfect marriage. \"How did you do it?\" \"How did you stay in love for so long?\" \"I want to know how you people navigated this situation.\" \"Oh Coach Jules you are so lucky!\" Usually, by the time we delve into a full conversation, it that leaves them questioning the severity of the situation that has caused them sleepless nights. Many times, people only need an extra set of ears and some prompts for starting a difficult conversation with their spouse. I am grateful for my marriage, and the ways it seems to flow with ease. But I would never underestimate the work my partner and I put towards ensuring that this perfection and ease is present. And many times, that hard work is not rosy or convenient - but we do what it takes to keep the relationship healthy. Back to my original question: do perfect relationships exist? If they do, what do they look like? I would love to learn what perfection in relationships means to you in the comments. #JulietOkene #CoachJules #RelationshipMatters #FinancialHarmony"
