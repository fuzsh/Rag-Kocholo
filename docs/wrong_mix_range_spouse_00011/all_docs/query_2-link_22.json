        "text": "“Where is the dinner plate?” her puzzled aunt asked Juliette, who had been tasked with feed¬ing scraps to the family’s collie. The plate was where Juliette had left it—with the dog in the backyard of the home where the teen was spending her summer. “They were horrified, to a person, that I’d let the dog eat off the china—the china!” she laughs, decades later.\n\nStarting with a pair of poodle “siblings,” dogs have provided Juliette with lifelong company and com¬fort. Unfortunately, she witnessed the suffering of two with puppy mill origins, fueling her determina¬tion to end such breeders.\n\nDuring their 46 years of marriage, Juliette worked in radio, television and theater while George, her high school sweetheart, advanced in a civil service career. As their earnings grew, they began mak¬ing gifts to support causes that mattered to them, including the Humane Society of the United States. Without heirs, the couple extended that support in their estate plans.\n\nShortly after retiring to North Carolina, George passed away after a brief illness. As she had many times previously during challenging times, Juliette sought canine companionship. She says of Rumpus, her Coton de Tulear, simply: “He saved me.”\n\nJuliette hopes to return the favor through her hu¬mane legacy. “I’m enormously grateful for the HSUS and their protection of our animal kingdom,” Juliette says. “We must act to save this heritage Earth has been gifted!”"
