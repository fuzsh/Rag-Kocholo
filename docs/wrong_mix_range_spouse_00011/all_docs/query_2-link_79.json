You can rebuild the foundation of your essential relationship skills and live in harmony with your partner if you make changes now and learn how to have a marriage of love.\n\nHaving the marriage of your dreams does not need to remain a dream. You have it in you to become the perfect partner for your perfect partner, and it’s not something you are born with; it’s something you learn, and anyone can do it!\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association (APA), 40 to 50 percent of marriages end in divorce. Remaining unhappily married is not an option to consider, and divorce is becoming easier and more socially acceptable than ever. Choosing to labor toward a happy and fulfilling marriage is about creating a partnership on which you can depend and from which you can grow.\n\nIf you are brave enough to step into those marriage shoes, you need to listen to this audiobook!\n\nBeing married is no joke, despite there being an abundance of marriage jokes; from the engagement ring, to the wedding ring, to marriage being a sentence instead of a word. Don’t let your marriage become or remain a joke - step in and be present, learning the skills, and the tactics for marital joy. From fights to lessons, learn how to communicate your way to a relationship that can meet all your needs regarding intimacy, sex, partnership, friendship, children, and support. In The Marriage of Love, you’ll discover:\n\nCommunication secrets\n\nHow to solve conflict\n\nThe discussion of children: to have or not to have\n\nThe importance of self-care\n\nIntimacy: dating and sex\n\nYou may have had a slew of relationships you have learned from, fled from, and even been kicked out of, but until you start building the relationship you deserve and need, you will never know true marital bliss."
