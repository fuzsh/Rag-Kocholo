        "text": "When thinking of Girl Scouts, I am sure that the first thing that comes to mind is ‚Äúcookies‚Äù, but what really should be your first thought is Juliette Gordon Low‚Äôs story. She is the founder of Girl Scouts and her story is one of empowerment! Juliette Gordon Low is a person who has left an everlasting legacy and has set an example for generations of girl scouts to follow. Let‚Äôs learn about her amazing life!\n\nThis article was a sponsored visit by the Board of Tourism of Savannah and the Juliette‚Äôs Gordlon Low‚Äôs Birth house ‚Äì nonetheless, as always, all opinions and thoughts are my own. üôÇ\n\nThe Juliette Gordon Low story\n\nJuliette Gordon Low was born on October 31, 1860, in Savannah, Georgia ‚Äì as someone who loves Halloween this is such a cool birthday fact Her close friends would refer to her by her affectionate nickname, ‚ÄúDaisy‚Äù. Her parents were William Washington Gordon II, and Eleanor ‚ÄúNellie‚Äù Kinzie Gordon, and she had 5 siblings.\n\nEarly Life Values that had an Everlasting Impact\n\nEarly on in life her parents taught her and her siblings core values such as loyalty, responsibility, and being respectful of others. These core values would later be essential to the creation of the Girl Scouts and would become central traits of the organization as a whole.\n\nDaisy also had a wide variety of interests early on in life such as art, nature, animals, and athleticism. These interests would later prove to be critical principles in Girl Scouts. As can be seen, Juliette Gordon Low‚Äôs early life contributed greatly to the critical principles seen in the Girl Scouts today.\n\nJuliette Gordon Low Childhood Education\n\nWhen Juliette Gordon Low was 12 years old she began attending many different boarding schools in both the north and south. This resulted in her gaining a well-rounded education. Despite being well educated many of Juliett‚Äôs letters throughout her life had grammatical and spelling errors leading some historians to believe that she had a learning disability, such as dyslexia.\n\nIf this is true, Juliette never slowed down in life because of it. She was a person that persevered through everything that life threw at her. This can also be seen through other events in Juliette Gordon Low‚Äôs life story.\n\nWant to learn more about Juliette‚Äôs childhood and birthplace? Make sure to visit her open-house!\n\nThe Start of Hearing loss\n\nWhen Juliette was a child and young adult she suffered from many illnesses, such as malaria, meningitis, and chronic ear infections. These resulted in partial hearing loss for the majority of her childhood, which would later be worsened in adulthood. Despite life‚Äôs setbacks, this never prevented her from being adventurous and pushing through life‚Äôs difficulties.\n\nThe Final Straw .. Rice?\n\nWhen Juliette was 26 in 1886 she married William Low. He was the son of a wealthy British businessman Andrew Low. At their wedding, as a sign of good luck, the wedding guest threw grains of rice at the couple.\n\nThis resulted in a grain of rice getting lodged into Juliette‚Äôs ear. She had to get surgery to remove the small piece of rice from her ear. Due to the many ear issues she had suffered in childhood coupled with damage from this surgery it resulted in almost total hearing loss for the rest of her life.\n\nThe Highs and Lows of Married life\n\nEven though William Low was a native of Savannah, Georgia he lived in England. Therefore the couple moved to England and spent the majority of their married life there. The couple are associated with aristocratic families of Britain. Her life in England was occupied with hunting parties, society dances, and royal court visits.\n\nThough life was busy for Juliette, her married life was filled with many marital problems. During difficult times in her marriage, Juliette would visit the United States often to connect with family and friends.\n\nFor both personal and professional reasons, Juliette‚Äôs husband often visited London. But then, sadly, he met another woman and fell desperately in love with her, and he began to consider marrying her instead ‚Äì can you imagine the agony she faced?\n\nUpon his return, eventually, the couple began the process of getting a divorce, but in 1905 William Low suddenly died and the divorce was never finalized. Before dying though, Willian left the majority of his wealth to the new woman who disappeared to make herself a good life, leaving Juliette having to fight for just about anything. So, she was left with the house and some extra, which she later turned into the birthplace of the girl scouts ‚Äì the lawyer certainly helped to get what was rightfully hers, considering she spent many years with her (ex)-husband.\n\nIf you enjoy learning and visiting famous places in Savannah then be sure to visit and take some tours of these amazing Savannah destinations. You can find them here.\n\nA Quest for New Meaning and Purpose\n\nAfter the death of her husband, the Juliette Gordon Low story takes a turn that would solidify her place in history. In 1912, on a trip to England, Juliette met Lord Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts during lunch. This chance meeting inspired Juliette ‚Äì not only that, but she had found a good friend in him during her lifetime.\n\nBoy Scout‚Äôs England Sister Organization: Girl Guides\n\nBaden-Powell suggested that Juliette work with Girl Guides, which at the time was the sister organization of the Boy Scouts in England. Juliette wasted no time and jumped right in. She even created more Girl Guide groups in England and rural London.\n\nBringing Girl Guides to America\n\nWanting to bring Girl Guides to her home in America, she quickly sailed home. When in Savannah, Georgia she wasted no time in establishing the first group of 18 girls which consisted of her relatives and girls from other established families in town.\n\nThis group was eventually broken down into smaller groups called patrols that were each named after a flower and met on different days of the week. During these meetings, the girls would learn a variety of skills such as:\n\nMap Reading\n\nFirst Aid\n\nCooking\n\nKnot Tying\n\nWhen they became proficient in a skill the girls would earn a badge. This was adopted from the British Girl Guides.\n\nFun Fact: Although she encouraged women and girls to take on greater roles, she avoided associating herself with feminists. Since some parents of teenage girls could be opposed to her cause, Juliette worried that being labeled a feminist might reduce the number of girls she could recruit.\n\nGirl Guide‚Äôs Expansion and Name Change\n\nIn 1913 Girl‚Äôs Guide began expanding to other states which required the organization to form a headquarters in Washington D.C. Eventually in 1916 this Headquarters would move to New York City. Another major change was that the girls decided instead of being called guides, they wished to be called Scouts. The name was therefore changed to Girl Scouts in the United States in 1913.\n\nNeed more places in Savannah, GA to visit. Here is a map of all the best places in Savannah, GA. Enjoy!\n\nWorld War I\n\nDuring WWI, the Juliette Gordon Low Story continues on. She found ways for the Girl Scouts to be a part of the war effort. She partnered with the American Red Cross and other US organizations to make this happen. This resulted in the Girl Scouts doing the following during WWI:\n\nRolled Bandages\n\nPlanted Gardens\n\nCanned\n\nSold War Bonds\n\nGetting Back to their Roots and Expanding\n\nIn 1918, after the war, Juliette continued her work with the Girl Scouts and dedicated her time to reviving their connection with Girl Guides.\n\nEventually, this led to the expansion of the organization internationally with Juliette being the American representative on the international committee. They expanded to the following countries across the Globe:\n\nSouth Africa\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nChina\n\nIn 1919 Juliette was awarded the organization‚Äôs highest honor, Silver Fish. The following year in 1920 Low stepped down as the President of the Girl Scouts of America and focused her efforts on expanding the organization internationally.\n\nEventually, Juliette was diagnosed with breast cancer. After various surgeries and treatments, she succumbed to her disease on January 17, 1927. Despite spending years sick, she never faltered or stopped her work on promoting and supporting the Girl Scouts.\n\nDid you love this deep dive into Savannah‚Äôs history, then you need to visit the Prohibition Museum in Savannah. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.\n\nHonors and Acknowledgements After Death\n\nEven though Juliette Gordon Low passed away in 1927 her dedication and passion lived on and she received numerous awards and acknowledgments after her death. Here is a list of a few:\n\n1944: The U.S. Launches a ‚Äúliberty Ship‚Äù named SS Juliette Low in her honor\n\n1948: The U.S. Post Office releases a 3-cent stamp of Juliette Gordon Low commemorating her as the founder of the Girl Scouts\n\n1954: In Savannah, an elementary school is named after her.

She dedicated her life to empowering young girls to become confident leaders in their own regard. Juliette made sure they had a space to develop these skills and that their dreams could become a reality.\n\nLastly, she used her skills and talent in networking and public relations to further expand the vision of Girl Scouts worldwide. Juliette was definitely a force to be reckoned with. The Juliette Gordon Low story and her legacy still live on nearly 100 years later in all the past, current, and future Girl Scouts worldwide.\n\nXO,\n\nAnna <3\n\nP.S.
