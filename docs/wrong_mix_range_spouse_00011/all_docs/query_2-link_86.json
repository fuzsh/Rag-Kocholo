        "text": "This does not allow Juliet to make her own decision. An example of this is when Lady Capulet reinforces the plan in which Paris would be Juliet's husband, rather than letting Juliet choose who she marries. Lady Capulet speaks for Juliet when she says “marry, my child, early next Thursday morn.” Having little to no knowledge aforetime about this news, Juliet is utterly astonished. Lady Capulet continues by saying “[the] young and noble gentleman, the county Paris... shall happily make thee there a joyful bride” (III.v.112-115). After having already prepared her life with Romeo, Juliet is in disbelief that her mother would not attempt to step into her father's plan. Juliet lashes back at her mother by saying “I will not marry yet” and threatening that she would marry Romeo “whom you know I hate” rather than Paris (III.v.115-122). The lack of communication between the two characters makes them distant from one another, and the little effort provided by Lady Capulet to approach her daughter is the main reason for this occurrence. The control Lady Capulet has over different characters and her\n\nIn William Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, Paris is Juliet’s suitor and although she did not love him, her father and him had already made the wedding date which in the end lead to their deaths. Paris could not wait to make Juliet his wife and combine his wealth and her beauty him stating,”My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.”(3.4.2088). A close relative of the prince he is not involved in the Capulet-Montague feud ; as he has royal blood he is of higher status which makes him valuable to Lord Capulet since it will bring their status over the Montagues. Once Capulet has promised him he can marry Juliet, he behaves very presumptuous toward her, acting as if they are already married. His death was because of Juliet, The Nurse, and his visiting of the tomb.\n\nI think that Paris was the character that suffered the most in Romeo and Juliet besides those two. I think that because he lost his relative Mercutio, he died, he never got to marry Juliet which he wanted to during the whole play. The first reason that he suffered the most is that he lost his relative Mercutio. We learn this when Benvolio comes out and tells Romeo that Mercutio is dead from the stab wound. This supports that because it physically said that Mercutio is dead. The second reason that Paris suffered the most is that he never got to marry Juliet. During the whole play Juliet was either avoiding him and the marriage, or faking being dead. This supports that because they never get to have the wedding which officially states that those\n\nOne reason why Paris would be a better husband for Juliet is because he didn’t get into as many fights as Romeo. Since there is a division in the Montague and Capulet family, whenever they come across each other, fights might break out easily like the fight with Mercutio and Tybalt or the fight in Act 1 Scene 1 Line: 64 or the fight with Tybalt and Romeo. Because of this, Romeo is more likely to get into duels with Capulets than Paris is to get into fights with either the Montague or Capulet family which is safer for Juliet. Paris was only in one fight and he fought because he thought Juliet was in danger. All in all Paris wanted Juliet not to get hurt.\n\nJuliet and her father definitely had different ideas about her future relationships in this play. Back in that time period, the father of the family was the one who made important decisions for their children, which included who his daughter was allowed to get married to, even if they opposed their preference. So, in the play, Lord Capulet gives his approval to a man named Paris to marry his daughter because he had a promising future and was very prosperous and could provide Juliet with anything she might require. Although she had this option of spouse, she chose\n\nThroughout the play a comparison is made between Paris and Romeo and the different aspects of love they offer Juliet. Paris is \"a gentleman of noble parentage\" and seems to be a sensible husband. He is rich and would be a gain to the Capulet family. The marriage to Paris is a logical arrangement, Capulet says Juliet should \"count her bless'd\" as he has \"wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bride\". She should be proud and grateful that her father has persuaded such a worthy and noble man to marry into their family. Paris is the courtly lover that Romeo wasn't given the chance to be; he brings flowers and kisses Juliet's hand\n\nLord Capulet is forcing Juliet to get married and doesn’t take into consideration that Juliet doesn’t desire to get married. Lord Capulet conversed to Paris, “ . . . Thursday tell her, she shall be married to this noble earl” (Shakespeare 198). Lord Capulet is indubitable for wanting Juliet ot get married, and arranges the wedding, as she is unaware of this. He plans the wedding thinking it will assist her from her grief of Tybalt dying, but he doesn’t know that for certain, and is planning something that will greatly affect her future, without her consent. Furthermore, this quote shows that when Juliet gave an ixnay on why she did not aspire to marry Paris, Capulet belabored her until she was on the ground crying asking for the nurses aid. Lord Capulet explains to Juliet, “But fettle your fine joints ‘gainst Thursday next, go with Paris to Saint Peters Church or I will drag thee on a hurdle*” (Shakespeare 214). This proves Capulet wants nothing more for his daughter than to get married to Paris, and it shows the extent he will go to, to receive his wish. Overall, Lord and Lady Capulet want Juliet to get married to Paris more than she wants to. This shows they don’t mind if she’s happy or not, as long as they get what they want. This goes deeper into the accusation that Juliet’s parents are at fault for the adolescents\n\nParis knows Juliet does not wish to marry him, yet this only makes him more determined to marry her as he sees Juliet as a prize, to show his superiority over everyone else. In today’s society, we would view Lord Capulet as a cold, unfeeling father because of the way he treats his daughter, but Lord Capulet is a prime example of Shakespearian fathers. His only wish is to make a good marriage for his daughter, but she rejects his help. Capulet doesn’t know Juliet has fallen for Romeo and so cannot be expected to understand why she doesn’t wish to marry Paris.\n\nIn examining Juliet's choice between Romeo or Paris, it is clear that Paris's courtly and mannerly approach to a marriage with Juliet is a reason as to why a real relationship between the two would prove beneficial for her. Paris in this instance shows the maturity and mannerly approach as he had consulted with the Capulets in regards to a potential marriage with him to Juliet, where as Romeo married her in secret. In act 1 scene 2 of Romeo and Juliet, Paris and Capulet are walking down the streets of Verona when Paris says, '' But now my lord, what say you to my suit?''. Paris proposes to Capulet in regards to a marriage.\n\nAs a woman, Lady Capulet can relate to how Juliet feels when she is told she is to marry Paris. However, as a wife, she cannot voice an opinion of who or when Juliet is to marry. She is experienced, and asks Juliet, \"Speak briefly: can you like of Paris’ love\" (1.3.98). Because she is the caretaker, she respects Juliet’s feelings, but she can do nothing, even if Juliet does not learn to love Paris. Perhaps she asks this question because her own mother never asked it. She may want to know her daughter’s opinion, because until a woman is married, she has all the rights of a man according to Pitt. However, the father ruled over his daughter, and it was virtually impossible to remain unmarried while the father held all the decision making (14).\n\nIn the play Romeo and Juliet, Paris’ purpose was to intervene with Romeo and Juliet’s secret relationship indirectly, making him an Antagonist in the play. Paris’ presence was heavily desired by the Capulets due to the fact that they want Juliet to get married to a handsome kinsmen like him. From the Capulets’ point of view Paris is a kinsmen of “Delight writ there with beauty’s pen” and his “eyes doth share the glory that in gold clasps locks in the golden story.” The Capulets are awed by his beauty and think that if Juliet marries him then she will be admired by many people which leads to trouble. Since Romeo and Juliet are already married, Juliet marrying Paris will cause a feud between Juliet’s relationship with Romeo.\n\nRomeo and Juliet are the most thought of characters in the play that experience tragedy, but Paris could be considered one as well. Juliet does not love Paris back, Paris does not know that Juliet is already married, and Paris dies are all reasons that Paris is a victim of tragedy in this play. The first reason Paris's story is tragic is that Juliet doesn’t love him back. In the story, Juliet urges, \"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, from off the battlements of yonder tower\" This line implies that she would rather jump off of a tower than marry him, in other words, she does not want to marry him.\n\nIn ‘’Romeo and Juliet’’ the two characters Paris and Romeo has a lot of similarities and differences. They are similarities such as they both are mature, both are wealthy, and they both have the same personality trait. They have differences such as different age and attractiveness, different character trait, and different family positions. One similar fact between the two characters Romeo and Paris is that they are mature. For example, Romeo and Paris are both noble,respectful, and committed."
