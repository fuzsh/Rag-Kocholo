        "text": "⌜Scene 3⌝\n\nSynopsis:\n\nLady Capulet informs Juliet of Paris’s marriage proposal and praises him extravagantly. Juliet says that she has not even dreamed of marrying, but that she will consider Paris as a possible husband if her parents wish her to.\n\nEnter ⌜Lady Capulet⌝ and Nurse.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0370 Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.\n\nNURSE\n\n0371 Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\n\n0372 I bade her come.—What, lamb! What, ladybird!\n\n0373 God forbid. Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!\n\nEnter Juliet.\n\np. 35\n\nJULIET 0374 5How now, who calls?\n\nNURSE 0375 Your mother.\n\nJULIET\n\n0376 Madam, I am here. What is your will?\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0377 This is the matter.—Nurse, give leave awhile.\n\n0378 We must talk in secret.—Nurse, come back again.\n\n0379 10 I have remembered me, thou ’s hear our counsel.\n\n0380 Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\n\nNURSE\n\n0381 Faith, I can tell her age unto ⌜an⌝ hour.\n\nLADY CAPULET 0382 She’s not fourteen.\n\nNURSE 0383 I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth (and yet, to my teen\n\n0384 15 be it spoken, I have but four) she’s not fourteen.\n\n0385 How long is it now to Lammastide?\n\nLADY CAPULET 0386 A fortnight and odd days.\n\nNURSE\n\n0387 Even or odd, of all days in the year,\n\n0388 Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\n\n0389 20 Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\n\n0390 Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\n\n0391 She was too good for me. But, as I said,\n\n0392 On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\n\n0393 That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.\n\n0394 25 ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,\n\n0395 And she was weaned (I never shall forget it)\n\n0396 Of all the days of the year, upon that day.\n\n0397 For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\n\n0398 Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\n\n0399 30 My lord and you were then at Mantua.\n\n0400 Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\n\n0401 When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\n\n0402 Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\n\n0403 To see it tetchy and fall out with ⌜the⌝ dug.\n\n0404 35 “Shake,” quoth the dovehouse. ’Twas no need, I\n\n0405 trow,\n\np. 37\n\n0406 To bid me trudge.\n\n0407 And since that time it is eleven years.\n\n0408 For then she could stand high-lone. Nay, by th’\n\n0409 40 rood,\n\n0410 She could have run and waddled all about,\n\n0411 For even the day before, she broke her brow,\n\n0412 And then my husband (God be with his soul,\n\n0413 He was a merry man) took up the child.\n\n0414 45 “Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?\n\n0415 Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,\n\n0416 Wilt thou not, Jule?” And, by my holidam,\n\n0417 The pretty wretch left crying and said “Ay.”\n\n0418 To see now how a jest shall come about!\n\n0419 50 I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,\n\n0420 I never should forget it. “Wilt thou not, Jule?”\n\n0421 quoth he.\n\n0422 And, pretty fool, it stinted and said “Ay.”\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0423 Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.\n\nNURSE\n\n0424 55 Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh\n\n0425 To think it should leave crying and say “Ay.”\n\n0426 And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow\n\n0427 A bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone,\n\n0428 A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\n\n0429 60 “Yea,” quoth my husband. “Fall’st upon thy face?\n\n0430 Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,\n\n0431 Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “Ay.”\n\nJULIET\n\n0432 And stint thou, too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\n\nNURSE\n\n0433 Peace. I have done. God mark thee to his grace,\n\n0434 65 Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nursed.\n\n0435 An I might live to see thee married once,\n\n0436 I have my wish.\n\np. 39\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0437 Marry, that “marry” is the very theme\n\n0438 I came to talk of.—Tell me, daughter Juliet,\n\n0439 70 How stands your ⌜disposition⌝ to be married?\n\nJULIET\n\n0440 It is an ⌜honor⌝ that I dream not of.\n\nNURSE\n\n0441 An ⌜honor?⌝ Were not I thine only nurse,\n\n0442 I would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy\n\n0443 teat.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0444 75 Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you\n\n0445 Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\n\n0446 Are made already mothers. By my count\n\n0447 I was your mother much upon these years\n\n0448 That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief:\n\n0449 80 The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\n\nNURSE\n\n0450 A man, young lady—lady, such a man\n\n0451 As all the world—why, he’s a man of wax.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0452 Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.\n\nNURSE\n\n0453 Nay, he’s a flower, in faith, a very flower.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0454 85 What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\n\n0455 This night you shall behold him at our feast.\n\n0456 Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,\n\n0457 And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\n\n0458 Examine every married lineament\n\n0459 90 And see how one another lends content,\n\n0460 And what obscured in this fair volume lies\n\n0461 Find written in the margent of his eyes.\n\n0462 This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\n\n0463 To beautify him only lacks a cover.\n\n0464 95 The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride\n\np. 41\n\n0465 For fair without the fair within to hide.\n\n0466 That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory\n\n0467 That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.\n\n0468 So shall you share all that he doth possess\n\n0469 100 By having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNURSE\n\n0470 No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0471 Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris’ love?\n\nJULIET\n\n0472 I’ll look to like, if looking liking move.\n\n0473 But no more deep will I endart mine eye\n\n0474 105 Than your consent gives strength to make ⌜it⌝ fly.\n\nEnter ⌜Servingman.⌝\n\nSERVINGMAN 0475 Madam, the guests are come, supper\n\n0476 served up, you called, my young lady asked for, the\n\n0477 Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in\n\n0478 extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you,\n\n0479 110 follow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET\n\n0480 We follow thee.⌜Servingman exits.⌝\n\n0481 Juliet, the County stays.\n\nNURSE\n\n0482 Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\n\nThey exit."
