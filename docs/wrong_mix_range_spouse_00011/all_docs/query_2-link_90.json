        "text": "Brad Pitt has dated a lot of A-listers, including his ex-wives Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie, but \"one of the greatest\" relationships he ever had was with someone he \"still loves\".\n\nThe 59-year-old actor met his ex-girlfriend Juliette Lewis on the set of their 1990 film Too Young to Die.\n\nDespite Juliette being just 17 at the time while Brad was 27, the pair hit it off and went on to become one of the hottest couples in Hollywood.\n\nThe former lovers dated for three years, but decided to call it quits in early 1993.\n\nWhile Juliette later said Brad is \"not in my universe at all now\", Brad gushed over his ex-girlfriend as he reminisced on the \"great time\" they had together.\n\n\"I still love the woman. There's some real genius there. I had a great time with her,\" he admitted in an interview.\n\n\"It was one of the greatest relationships I've ever been in. The problem is, we grow up with this vision that love conquers all, and that's just not so, is it?\" he told Vanity Fair.\n\nBack in 1993, Brad and Juliette starred alongside each other in their second film Kalifornia.\n\nSpeaking about their romance at the time, Juliette said she already liked Brad as an actor before they started dating.\n\n\"We met on a movie of the week and started dating when it was over. I already liked him as an actor, plus you gotta respect somebody who’s in the same field as you,\" she told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nShe added: \"We're like at the point in love, where we just like to see each other every single day and we don't get bored with each other, so it's really, really nice.\n\n\"Also, we get to be around each other when we’re working and talk and collaborate. We want to work together again and again and again.\"\n\nYears later, Juliette opened up about Brad once again.\n\nDuring an interview with The Guardian, she said: \"He's not in my universe at all now.\n\n\"It seems like a high-school relationship because now he's a very famous person. I look at this person that I shared a bit of history with.\n\n\"I hope he finds happiness because I genuinely loved him. He's a very stand-up, good guy.\"\n\nLater in 2009, she admitted that the only reason people approach her about him is because of his iconic Hollywood status.\n\n\"People ask me about him just because he's famous. They don't really ask about my ex-husband, which is a far more significant relationship because we were married,\" she said.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."
