        "text": "Reader's advisory: Wired News has been unable to confirm some sources for a number of stories written by this author. If you have any information about sources cited in this article, please send an e-mail to sourceinfo[AT]wired.com.\n\nIBM has been accused of providing technology to the Third Reich that allowed Nazis to persecute and kill Holocaust victims more efficiently.\n\nA lawsuit was filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., on behalf of five Holocaust victims. The suit alleges IBM knew the data-processing technology it supplied to the Third Reich would be \"used to facilitate persecution and genocide.\"\n\nThe legal action by the Washington law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll coincides with the publication on Monday of a book entitled IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance Between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation, by Edwin Black.\n\n\"Hitler could not have so quickly and efficiently identified and rounded up Jews and other minorities, used them as slave laborers and ultimately exterminated them, without IBM's assistance,\" attorney Michael Hausfeld said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nHausfeld was one of a team of attorneys that legally compelled Germany to establish a $5 billion reparations fund for Holocaust victims last year.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to collect damages from IBM, and wants Holocaust survivors to receive reparations for profits made through IBM's violations of international law.\n\nThe suit also claims that IBM has not allowed historians access to its archival records, which Hausfeld alleges would prove that the company took an active role in helping the Nazis.\n\nBlack, a son of Holocaust survivors, claims that IBM created a custom system for its Hollerith tabulators that allowed Hitler to computerize his war machine.\n\n\"IBM technology put the blitz into the blitzkrieg,\" claims Black, who argues that IBM technology allowed Hitler's troops to achieve \"scale, velocity, efficiency,\" that would have been impossible without computerization.\n\nBlack also claims that Thomas J. Watson, IBM's chairman from 1915 to 1956, and other top level IBM executives in New York, knowingly allowed the Nazis to use IBM technology in order to protect company's profits.\n\nWatson was awarded the Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star by Hitler.\n\nThe lawsuit filed against IBM echoes this theme, charging that the company helped to develop a custom push-card method of tracking ethnicity for the Germans, and also serviced the machines for the Nazis during the war years.\n\nThe suit alleges that the company should have known what the Nazis were using the machines for, and therefore should have stopped providing and servicing the technology.\n\nThe part that IBM's technology played during Hilter's regime has long been known to researchers, said Melvin Silver, professor of World War II history at Massey College.\n\n\"Hitler and his troops used tabulating machines made by Dehomag, a German subsidiary of IBM,\" Silver said. \"These machines have been exhibited at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and extensive records on the machines are in the archives of the Hohenheim University in Stuttgart, Germany.\"\n\nDehomag was placed under the control of the Reich government just before the war broke out. The tabulating machines made by the company were used for censuses taken in 1933 and 1939, and allowed the Nazis to create cross-indexes of names, family histories, addresses, business records and bank accounts of its citizens, said Silver.\n\n\"Dehomag was IBM's second most profitable company in the 1930s, despite an international boycott of the Nazi economy,\" said Silver.\n\n\"It is of course troubling that the company did not pull out of doing business with the Nazis but I would not venture to say that IBM's technology allowed the Nazis to accomplish more death and horror than they would have with lists kept with pens and paper.\n\n\"Hitler relied on the dark souls of humans to accomplish his horrors, not on technology,\" Silver added.\n\nIBM spokeswoman Carol Makovich said the company had not been allowed to see Black's book before publication, and could not comment on its contents.\n\nIn a letter posted on the firm's internal computer bulletin board on Friday, IBM warned its employees that \"A book will be published shortly stating that Hollerith tabulating machines were used by the Nazi regime and apparently speculating on the activities of IBM's subsidiary in Germany at the time.\n\n\"We recognize that its (the book's) very subject is an important and highly painful one for many IBMers, their families and the world community at large.\""
