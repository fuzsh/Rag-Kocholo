No registration required.\n\nLocation: Furman University. Furman Hall. McEachern Lecture Hall (Room 214)\n\nDescription: For more than a decade, a harsh Congressional immigration policy kept most Jewish refugees out of America, even as Hitler and the Nazis closed in. In 1944, the United States finally acted. That year, Franklin D. Roosevelt created the War Refugee Board, and put a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle in charge.\n\nThis talk discusses the work of War Refugee Board, describing how Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, smugglers, diplomats, millionaires, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, maneuvered food and medicine into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, laundered money, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and sliced red tape to allow Jewish refugees to escape to Palestine. In this remarkable work of historical reclamation, Holocaust historian Rebecca Erbelding pieces together years of research and newly uncovered archival materials to tell the dramatic story of America’s little-known efforts to save the Jews of Europe.\n\nAmericans and the Holocaust: Explorations of an Exhibit\n\nSpeakers: Christy Allen and Alyssa Nance\n\nDate/Time: April 15th, 10:30am - 11:30am\n\nLocation: Furman University.

Furman Hall. McEachern Lecture Hall (Room 214)\n\nAudience: Open to the public. No registration required\n\nDescription: Before World War II, Lithuania was a great center of Jewish life and learning, and yet Americans today know very little about the destruction of the Jewish community in Lithuania or what Patrick Desbois has called “the Holocaust by Bullets.” Dr. Melinda Menzer of Furman University, will be recounting her family's story. In 1941, the German army invaded Jurburg, Lithuania the town where Dr. Menzer's grandfather and his family lived. Over the course of four months, the 2,000 Jewish Lithuanians of Jurburg, including her grandfather's family, were violently murdered by a Nazi mobile death squad and Lithuanian collaborators, and their community destroyed. Dr. Menzer will also discuss how the U.S immigration quota system of the early 20th century affected her family, making it possible for her grandfather to come to the United States while denying entry to his relatives and so many other Eastern European Jews.\n\nCLP - Fighting on Two Fronts: African Americans Respond to the Holocaust\n\nSpeaker: Ted Rosengarten\n\nModerator: Laura Baker and Jeff Makala\n\nDate/Time: April 20th, 6:30pm - 7:30pm\n\nLocation: Furman University. Furman Hall. McEachern Lecture Hall (Room 214)\n\nAudience: Open to the public. No registration required.\n\nDescription: Even before the passage of the Nuremberg laws in 1935 depriving Jews of citizenship and stripping them of basic civil rights, raised the alarm in Jewish circles, the Black press was quick to recognize the incipient threat. Black organizations such as the NAACP and the National Urban League publicly condemned the persecution of Jews in Germany and warned against the spread of antisemitism closer to home. Hitler was our “common concern” they argued, “because of the dramatic example he sets for other demagogues to follow in his sadistic footsteps.”\n\nOnce the United States went to war against Germany and Japan, Black Americans fought for the right to fight. They fought to defeat the greatest racial enemy on earth, and to conquer Jim Crow on the battlefield and the home front. As the Germans retreated to defend Berlin, all black units including the 761st Tank battalion and the 183rd Engineer Combat Battalion entered the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps, coming face to face with the Nazi extermination of Europe’s Jews and the remnants of other peoples deemed unworthy of life by the crazed Nazi theory. There was as yet no name for this crime, yet Black GIs from the South had something to compare to it. “I didn’t know anything about fascism,” one soldier admitted, “but I know about lynching.” To him and his Black comrades, the murders they discovered were “lynching by the hundreds, lynchings by the thousands.” These soldiers who had felt the closeness of death and experienced the shared humanity and love of the liberated were changed for good. Their country would never be the same.\n\nThe 45 minute presentation will be followed by 15 minutes of moderated Q/A."
