        "text": "The problematic representation of Mizrahi Jews in Israeli films has been extensively researched over the past few decades. The subject was first thoroughly analyzed in Ella Shohat’s comprehensive 1989 study, Israeli Cinema: East/West and the Politics of Representation. In her book she uses a Marxist approach, claiming that Israeli films express the views of the Ashkenazi hegemony and help preserve its supremacy. Shohat discusses the modes through which an Orientalist dichotomy dominated Eretz-Israeli and Israeli cinema from the outset. In films that portrayed an encounter between Ashkenazi Jews and Mizrahi Jews, the former represented Western values—they were rational, enlightened, and compassionate—while Mizrahi Jews were mainly depicted as primitive, inferior, and violent. Over the years, scholars have pointed to other features in the cinematic representation of Ashkenazi-Mizrahi relations in Israeli Bourekas films, which were dominant from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, but Shohat’s preliminary observations regarding an Orientalist dichotomy in the 1950s have become generally accepted in Israeli film studies. This article revisits the perceived Orientalist dichotomy through an analysis of 1950s films that focus on encounters between Mizrahi Jews and Holocaust survivors (Ashkenazi Jews) and their integration into Israeli society. These films include Tent City [Ir Ha’ohalim] (Leopold Aryeh Lahola, 1951), Faithful City [Kirya Ne’emana] (Józef Lejtes, 1952), and Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer [Givaa 24 Eina Ona] (Thorold Dickinson, 1955). The article claims that in these films Mizrahi Jews are shown as integrating more quickly than Holocaust survivors. Conversely, Holocaust survivors are presented in the films—much like they were in many other cultural realms at that time—as a broken people who ultimately assimilated, albeit with much difficulty.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, approximately 450,000 Holocaust survivors immigrated to Palestine and after 1948 – to the nascent State of Israel. The complex encounters of the newcomers with the Jews who had already been living in Palestine were reduced to a series of superficial representations in Israeli feature films. The robust Zionist ideology dominated Israeli filmmaking of the 1940s and 1950s. Films made during that era presented a biased worldview, emphasising the Holocaust’s Zionist “lesson”: the importance of a Jewish state in the land of Israel. As part of this narrative, survivors were often portrayed as people broken in body and in spirit, who could be healed and transformed into strong “new Jews” only in Israel. During the 1961 Eichmann trial, Israelis were exposed – some for the first time – to numerous testimonies which made them more cognisant of the complexity of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust. Following the trial, initial attempts were made at producing feature films which depicted a more multifaceted image of survivors. The article argues that the euphoria that followed the 1967 Six‑Day War resurrected the image of the “new Jew” and cast Holocaust survivors into their former role as the antithesis of the powerful Israeli. The rupture of Israeli society following the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, which opened the door to renewed identification with the suffering of Europe’s Jews under Nazism, did not restore these first cinematic attempts of the early 1960s. The article discusses these themes through the analysis of two prominent films that were produced in the decade following the 1967 war: He Walked through the Fields (Hu halach basadot, 1967) by Yosef Millo and Operation Thunderbolt (Mivtsa Yonatan, 1977) by Menahem Golan."
