Filmmaker Michael Turner documents his first visit to a Holocaust memorial created by his grandmother Lici, a Hungarian Jew whose parents and sister were killed in Auschwitz.\n\n2022 - Where is Anne Frank?\n\nThe Melton Center and Wexner Center for the Arts presented the Columbus premiere of Where is Anne Frank, (2021), a contemporary reimagining of Frank’s story and legacy. The film follows Kitty, the imaginary friend to whom Frank’s diary is addressed, who comes to life from the pages of the diary in contemporary Amsterdam in the house, now a museum, where the Frank family hid from the Nazis.\n\n2020 - Thomas and Diann Mann Film Study Series\n\nThe Melton Center offered a virtual 4-part film study series to the public with Ohio State Jewish studies professors. The films included The Debt, a 2010 British remake of the 2007 Israeli thriller film Ha-Hov, Footnote, a 2011 Israeli drama about a troubled relationship between a father and son who teach in the Talmud department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and Dancing Arabs, a 2014 Israeli drama film directed by Eran Riklis.

With her family, Frances \"Baby\" Houseman falls in love with the camp's dance instructor, Johnny Castle.\n\n2014 - The Other Men in Black: The Hasidic Movement, Past and Present\n\nA film presented by the Melton Center for Jewish Studies, The Other Men in Black: the Hasidic Movement, Past and Present.
