        "text": "Class assignments include:\n\n(1) In-class commentary: at the end of each class marked by an asterix (*), students will be asked to write a short response to what has been discussed. The purpose is to allow the students to think through what has just occurred, and to allow me to gauge class progress. The assignment is performed in class. To allow some flexibility, students are required to hand in 12 commentaries out of 14 marked meetings.\n\n(2) Reading responses: students are required to hand in a typed reading response, at least one page long, for 16 of the 17 readings (a double reading response should be two pages long), following a set of questions posted on the web (link will be added here). The responses should demonstrate familiarity with the text and point at passages of special interest to the student. Unlike the two papers, the responses are not meant to demonstrate originality of thought. In principle, no extensions will be allowed for reading responses (see policies).\n\n(3) Mid-term paper: the paper will be written on a given set of questions (link will be added here). The paper should be 4-6 pages long and typed. To understand the expected quality, please consult my grading criteria. (4) Final paper proposal: a one-page typed proposal should include (a) identifying the passage(s) to be discussed, (b) main argument, similar to the opening paragraph of the finished paper, and (c) paper outline, similar to the second paragraph of the finished paper. The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that students think of the thesis and structure of the paper well in advance.\n\n(5) A final paper, 5-7 pages long, typed. Again, pleaseconsult my grading criteria."
