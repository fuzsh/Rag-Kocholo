Discussions will focus on the origins of anti-Semitism and other National Socialist justifications for genocide as well as on theories of Sigmund Freud, Primo Levi, and Saul Friedlander treating the psychology of mourning, repression, trauma, and memory, and apply them to the postwar reactions of Holocaust survivors in poetry, literature, and film.\n\nScreenings: Triumph of the Will (Leni Riefenstahl, 1935), Jüd Süss (Veit Harlan, 1940), Europa, Europa (Agnieszka Holland, 1990), Sophie Scholl: The Final Days (Marc Rothemund, 2006), Valkyrie (Bryan Singer, 2008), The Nasty Girl (Michael Verhoeven, 1991), Life is Beautiful (Roberto Benigni, 1997), Downfall (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2004), Under The Domim Tree (Eli Cohen, 1995), and The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008).\n\n****FORL2600 counts towards the Multicultural/Transnational/International Film Cognate for Summer Session 2017 semester********\n\nSUMMER SESSION II\n\nFILM 2900.601: Introduction to Film Studies (FC:HU)\n\nInstructor: Anna Froula\n\nClass Time: online\n\nThis course introduces you to the broad field of film studies, including formal analysis, genre studies, film history and theory.

While most people go to the movies for mere entertainment, a good film can inspire its viewers, challenge people to think in new ways, and even educate its audience. The purpose of this course is to tap into the power of film to study, learn about, and deepen understanding of controversial social and political issues, public policies and laws, as well as civil liberties, civil rights, the electoral process, and political institutions.\n\nScreenings: Gabriel Over the White House (1933, Gregory La Cava), The Manchurian Candidate (1962, John Frankenheimer), Network (1976, Sidney Lumet), Do The Right Thing (1989, Spike Lee), Schindler’s List (1993, Steven Spielberg), The Lives of Others (2006, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck), The Hurt Locker (2009, Kathryn Bigelow)\n\n***POLS 3012 counts as an elective for the Film Studies Minor in Summer Session 2017 semester***\n\nSOCI 3035-001: Sociology Through Film\n\nInstructor: Sitawa R. Kimuna\n\nClass times: Online\n\nFilm Screenings: Students will watch all assigned films on their own\n\nThe course will examine the importance of film in shaping and creating cultural perceptions. The goal of the course is to provide students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze film as it is organized and presented for public consumption. The course is designed to introduce students to issues of diversity. For example, what films teach us about social class, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and the different forms of disability, etc. We will go beyond overly-simplified discussions of stereotypes to address cultural products subject to a variety of interpretations. Several films have been placed on reserve at Joyner for students. Students could also use Film on Demand and Kanopy, two library services available through Joyner and when possible some of the assigned films can be viewed using Netflix or Hulu.\n\nScreenings: Puss Boots (2011, Chris Miller); Happy Feet (2006, George Miller); Knocked Up (2007, Judd Apatow); The Blind Side (2009, John Lee Hancock); She Hate Me (2004, Spike Lee); The Devil Wears Prada (2006, David Frankel); The Informant (2009, Steven Soderbergh); Dirty Pretty Things (2002, Stephen Frears); It’s Kind of a Funny Story (2010, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck); American Violet (2008, Tim Disney); Doubt (2009, John Patrick Shanley); Boys Don’t Cry (1999, Kimberly Peirce); Brokeback Mountain (2005, Ang Lee); Crash (2004, Paul Haggis); Gran Torino (2009, Clint Eastwood); A Serious Man (2009, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen), Slumdog Millionaire (2008, Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan); Thelma & Louise (1991, Ridley Scott); As Good as It Gets (1997, James L.
