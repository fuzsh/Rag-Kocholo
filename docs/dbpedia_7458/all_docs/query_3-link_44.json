(is?) (seemed to be?)\n\nunder pressure to concentrate on current cinema; their readership (?)\n\nwasn't interested in \"old\" movies -- unless linked to some event being\n\nsponsored by Lincoln Center. At least, that's how the situation\n\nappeared to me, as an outsider.\n\nI did, therefore, suggest that they run a photo saying \"Happy Birthday,\n\nKing,\" but they didn't want to do this. 1994 was the centenary of Ford,\n\nRenoir, Vidor, von Sternberg. The last two guys got almost no attention\n\nin the US and next to none in Europe (the exception being a Venice retro\n\nof Vidor and some series in Germany -- both promoted by yours truly).\n\nI managed to get my Vidor essay into print in Italian, Spanish (twice),\n\nFrench and Swedish. But not English. Neither Senses of Cinema nor\n\nScreening the Past had any interest in running (or even in reading) a\n\npiece on Vidor (or the Tryptych). So it took me almost ten years to get\n\nthis out in English. All the more reason to celebrate Film\n\nInternational !! And for me to recommend the essay to you.\n\nTag Gallagher.\n\nEric Henderson wrote:\n\n>\n\n> I agree with this.

I'm sorry I haven't seen the Dietrich expos in Berlin (or\n\nBerlin).\n\n>\n\n> Your piece made me realize that there the flashback does not exist in\n\n> Sternberg, or at least I can't think of any.\n\nAnatahan is narrated in retrospect and there are flashbacks at the end,\n\nwhen the girl looks at the returning sailors. (I think, offhand, that\n\nRossellini has only one flashback.)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> We need only watch\n\n> Song of Songs to see much of the spark missing from her eyes.\n\nIn the second half of short thing on Mamoulian, I wrote:\n\nIn Song of Songs (1933) Marlene Dietrich's character is many times more\n\nelusive and distant than any of her Sternberg characters (although\n\nParamount's intent was to find a more commercial director for her), and\n\nthe reason is that Mamoulian is literally incapable of looking at\n\nDietrich for more than a second or two without cutting to a reaction, or\n\ncutting closer, or cutting farther away, before finally running away\n\nentirely, from embarrassment, no doubt, at the perpetration of so many\n\ncheap imitations of Sternberg, at the fact that Mamoulian, incapable of\n\ncreating a new Dietrich character (as Sternberg accomplished seven\n\ntimes), can only record her aping her Sternberg personas. Again, he\n\nfidgets. And, finally, this is why Mamoulian is boring: because he\n\ncannot make a movie that is happening before us; instead, he makes a\n\nfilm that follows a text. His tricks, like his cutting up Dietrich, add\n\na layer of distraction from whatever emotional reality his characters\n\nmight undergo, and worse, convince us that the tricks and special\n\neffects are more interesting than the characters and their stories.\n\n>\n\n> I agree that \"Shanghai Express continues for nineteen minutes after it's\n\n> over\", but not \"solely to ponder faith\".

This seems well worth nineteen minutes to me (although\n\n> maybe you are making a different point).\n\nI meant it as a compliment, not a complaint. Your remark about her\n\ndominance is fascinating; I never thought of it that way.\n\n> Roger Ebert is bringing \"the world's leading benshi\" to\n\n> accompany a showing of I Was Born, But...\n\nThere have been a number of benshi performances in Europe at Pordenone\n\nor museums. And there are editions of some Mizomovies that have \"music\n\n& benshi\" soundtracks. The problem is that they do it in Japanese, and\n\nI can't understand a word, and so it's like an announcer who goes on and\n\non and never stops. (I hate to admit it, but I wish there were a DVD of\n\nAnatahan where one could turn off von Sternberg's voice, at least for\n\none screening.) You know, John Ford's brother Francis got his start in\n\npictures as a benshi; they were common in the nickelodeon period in the\n\nUS, albeit not in Japanese.\n\n>\n\n1703\n\nFrom: David Ehrenstein\n\nDate: Wed Sep 3, 2003 5:28pm\n\nSubject: Re: Re: My Favorite Year: 1932\n\nI am in complete agreement that \"Song of Songs\" is\n\nterrible, but it's quiteunjust IMO to then say \"And,\n\nfinally, this is why Mamoulian is boring: because he\n\ncannot make a movie that is happening before us;\n\ninstead, he makes a\n\nfilm that follows a text.\"\n\nWhat do you mean by that? Does \"Love Me Tonight\" not\n\n\"happen before us\"? What about \"Applause\" and \"City\n\nStreets\"? Are they phoned-in? I think not.\n\n--- Tag Gallagher"
