        "text": "BY ELLA TAYLOR\n\nIT'S A TOUGH JOB, BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT\n\nIt's grand to have a job that pays me to see movies and go to film festivals, grander still when one of those festivals takes place on a cruise in the Caribbean. Organized every other year by Dusty Cohl, the founder of the Toronto Film Festival, the Floating Film Festival this time brought together 150 movie buffs, critics, and programmers aboard the fancy MS Ryndam for a series of mostly independent films interspersed with island-hopping excursions. The festival had its share of crowd-pleasers--Marleen Gorris's Antonia's Line won the audience award, with Jon Blair's fine documentary Anne Frank Remembered and Tim Reid's worthy but conventional Once Upon a Time. . . When We Were Coloured running close behind. Time magazine critic Richard Corliss presented the delightfully sophomoric Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie (opening in late April), about a man and two robots marooned in space who are forced by a mad scientist to watch old B-movies--in this case the hilariously awful 1955 sci-fi classic This Island Earth.\n\nCorliss, an Asian-film specialist, presented two Hong Kong films already in commercial release--Wong Kar-Wai's superlative romantic comedy Chungking Express, and Rumble in the Bronx, a delirious action vehicle for Jackie Chan, directed by Stanley Tong--along with Chinese director Jiang Wen's (\"as in John Wayne\") enthralling In the Heat of the Sun, about teenagers cruising Beijing during the Cultural Revolution. Similar in theme, though less impressive conceptually, was the beautifully shot but assaulting Cyclo (coming this August), by the Vietnamese director Tranh Anh Hung (The Scent of Green Papaya), about rickshaw bicyclists on the violent streets of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nAside from a karaoke evening (no, I didn't) and a Robbie Burns Night, in which otherwise sane men showed up for dinner in skirts, one of the most enjoyable events was a chat between critic Roger Ebert and writer Donald E. Westlake. Westlake discoursed with charm and wry wit about his work and about the making of The Grifters, for which he wrote the screenplay--and made my day by describing the movie Seven as \"loathsome.\"\n\nFor me the highlight of the festival was a modest first feature with (as yet) no distributor. Written and directed with astonishing assurance by Michael Shoob, and presented by former New York Daily News critic Kathleen Carroll, Driven tells the stories of three Los Angeles cabbies who work for a two-bit taxi company. The film is a small miracle of good writing coupled with superlative ensemble performances from Tony Todd, Daniel Roebuck, Whip Hubley, and Chad Lowe. Distributors, step right up.\n\nCabbies from Driven\n\nPhoto: Shelby Wood\n\nA SURVIVOR'S STORY\n\nDuring and after the Second World War thousands of mostly orphaned Jewish teenagers were brought from Nazi-occupied countries to Israel to live in youth villages--many run by kibbutzim--alongside troubled Israeli youths. Eli Cohen's Under the Domim Tree is a tribute to the operation, known as Youth Aliyah. Adapted from an autobiographical book by one of Israel's finest actresses, Gila Almagor, the film is a sequel to her well-received 1988 collaboration with Cohen, The Summer of Aviya. Directed with tact and sensitivity, Under the Domim Tree explores the terrors and triumphs of a group of Polish-Jewish teenagers as they struggle with their memories, their night sweats, and their longing for families that in all too many cases have disappeared without a trace. What the movie lacks in sophistication is more than made up for by greathearted sympathy and an imaginative flair for dramatizing inner turmoil.\n\nThe children of Youth Aliyah\n\nPhoto: courtesy of Strand Releasing\n\nOF FLAPPERS AND FARM HANDS\n\nDirector John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy) has mobilized the wicked pen of British novelist Malcolm Bradbury (The History Man) to adapt Cold Comfort Farm, Stella Gibbons's darkly funny 1932 novel of English village life. No rural nostalgia here. Kate Beckinsale stars as Flora Poste, a pert, compulsively tidy London flapper who, after being orphaned, descends on a pack of glum country relatives intending to write a novel, and ends by shaking up everyone's life, including her own. Shrewdly observed, with Schlesinger's sardonic flair and an edge of broad comedy, the movie boasts a stellar cast, featuring Joanna (Abfab) Lumley as Flora's bra-collecting friend, Ian McKellen as her fire-and-brimstone preacher cousin, Eileen Atkins as his sad-sack wife, and Rufus Sewell (Carrington) as their hunky son. There's an improbably happy but oddly satisfying ending.\n\nA city girl takes on the country\n\nPhoto: Chris Capstick\n\nElla Taylor is a film critic for LA Weekly.
