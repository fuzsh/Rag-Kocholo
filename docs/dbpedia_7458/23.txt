A TV Guide review gave the movie three out of four stars and said, "A sweetly romantic teen film about the Holocaust? Well, yes, and not a bad one...Aviya's mother (played by Almagor, who also coproduced and cowrote the screenplay) is in an asylum, and most of her friends are war orphans. Together they fall in love, bicker, study, try to track down the remnants of their scattered families and forget the war that haunts their dreams. The kibbutz's domim (crab apple) tree is where they go to sit when it's all too much. Sentimental, to be sure, but touchingly acted and a welcome antidote to the epic grandiosity of Schindler's List."
