Under the Domim Tree (Hebrew: עץ הדומים תפוס, romanized:Etz Hadomim Tafus) is a 1994 Israeli film based on the 1992 book of the same name by Gila Almagor. The film was directed by Eli Cohen, and screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.[1]

Both the book and the film are sequels to Almagor's 1985 autobiographical book, Summer of Aviya, about the protagonist's childhood in the 1950s in Israel. Under the Domim Tree tells of Aviya's years in the Oudim boarding school and about the relations that are formed between the Israeli-born students and the students who survived the Holocaust.
