        "text": "Penn Badgley needs no introduction.\n\nFrom starring on Gossip Girl to currently appearing in Netflix’s You, the man has made himself a household name from Gen X to Gen Z.\n\nBut having been in the industry since he was 20, means things haven't always been smooth sailing.\n\nRefresh your memory with the trailer for CW's Gossip Girl here. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via Warner Bros.\n\nIn 2007, Badgley was cast on the teen drama TV series Gossip Girl as Dan Humphrey. He became famous seemingly overnight.\n\n\"It was a little bit night and day,\" Badgley told Variety in a recent interview.\n\n\"I think the date was September 19, 2007.\"\n\nNot only was Badgley playing a lead role in one of the biggest shows on television, but he was also dating his co-star Blake Lively.\n\nThe actor was unprepared for how interested fans would be in their relationship both on and off-screen.\n\n\"Beyond our relationship, I don’t think anybody was going to be interested in me publicly,\" he told the publication.\n\nHow wrong he was.\n\nBadgley recalls that time of his life \"fun and fast-paced\" with a \"dark undercurrent that would bottom out in my later 20s\".\n\nHe told Variety that although never suicidal, he was certainly in a despair.\n\nWhile young stars turning to substance abuse is nothing new nor surprising, Badgley didn't. It's something he attributes to Lively and their relationship.\n\n\"Blake didn’t drink, and I think our relationship in some ways saved me from forcing myself to go down that road,\" he said.\n\nInstead, the actor found comfort in spirituality - he travelled, learned about the Baháʼí Faith, and meditated. He also developed an interest in social justice and political causes.\n\nWhen Badgley was 11, he persuaded his mother to move from Seattle to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nHe took his high school GED when he was only 13 years old to allow him to focus on his craft and book roles.\n\nHis first film was in the 2001 cult film, The Fluffer, followed by an appearance on Will & Grace and a role in John Tucker Must Die.\n\nThen came Gossip Girl.\n\nDuring the six seasons, Badgley worked on other projects here and there, most notably Easy A alongside Emma Stone. But his passions were elsewhere.\n\nAfter Lively, Badgley dated Zoë Kravitz from 2011 to 2013.\n\nThe pair lived together in an apartment in New York, and reportedly, ended things amicably.\n\n\"It wasn't a sad breakup. It is all good between them,\" a source told US Weekly source.\n\n\"They are at two different stages in their careers. They just didn't have time for each other.\"\n\nBut good things were just around the corner. Badgley met his now-wife, Domino Kirke, in a meatball shop a year later.\n\nShe told the story of how they met on the actor's podcast, Podcrushed.\n\n\"Penn and I met at a meatball shop… I had never seen Gossip Girl, so I had no context for Penn,\" she said.\n\nThe actor was couch surfing at the time and Kirke offered him the spare room in her apartment.\n\n\"I got his number because I was really interested in him living with me, and I thought he was cute,\" she said.\n\n\"And it would have been nice to have a little winter, you know, fling with my roommate.\"\n\nThe pair got married in 2017, and Badgley took on the role as stepdad to her son Cassius.\n\nThe couple welcomed a child in 2020 after struggling with miscarriages.\n\n\"Everyone was like, 'I want Joe Goldberg to murder me,'\" You executive producer, Sarah Schechter told Variety about fans' initial reaction to Badgley's character.\n\n\"And Penn was like, 'Ladies, no! Do not. Do not be attracted to this man.'\"\n\nBadgley has even taken to TikTok to spread this message.\n\nIn his first video on the platform, the actor lip-synced Taylor Swift's song 'Anti-Hero' in character.\n\n\"It’s me, Hi! I’m the problem, it’s me!\"\n\n@iampennbadgley #antihero ♬ Anti-Hero - Taylor Swift\n\nThese days, Badgley has started his own production company, Ninth Mode Media, which homes his podcast Podcrushed with co-hosts Nava Kavelin and Sophie Ansari.\n\nThe trio have interviewed Lisa Kudrow, Conan O’Brien and You co-stars Jenna Ortega and Victoria Pedretti.\n\nThe actor has plans to expand the company beyond podcasting as well.\n\nAnd after that?\n\nBadgley recently secured the rights and funding to direct his first feature film, an adaption of comedian David Sedaris’ short story Jamboree.\n\n\"I think he has more than proven that he’s someone people really, really want to watch,\" You showrunner Sera Gamble said.\n\n\"But, you know, Penn gets to do whatever he wants.\"\n\nFeature Image: Warner Bros."
