They created a show that people can watch after a long day and not have to stress and worry and feel the burdens of real life. It’s just an escape, watching these sparkly lives and just escaping into this other world for an hour\n\nMario Testino\n\nBlake Lively is repped by Josh Lieberman @ Creative Artists Agency (CAA), managed by Justin Grey Stone and Jason Weinberg @ Untitled Entertainment, attorney Jeff Bernstein @ Jackoway Tyerman Wertheimer Austen Mandelbaum Morris & Klein, and publicist Ruth Bernstein and Leslie Sloane Zelnik @ Baker/Winokur/Ryder.\n\nARTICLEURL\n\nHugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Catherine Martin and Baz Luhrmann came out to promote their epic film – Australia – at its New York premiere at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City.

People talked to actor Connor Paolo about his character, Eric Van Der Woodsen, and here are some highlights and a clip from Gossip Girl:\n\n[redlasso id=’c5c43270-6357-433f-a74b-e0322a4fae58′]\n\nHow will the other characters react to the news? Everyone okay with it: Each character has their own reaction. It does seem to create a rift between me and Jenny. Chuck steps up as big brother though.\n\nWhen did you find out your character was gay: I was told about a month ago. Two of the producers explained the situation. It seemed like a good thing. Up to this point, I’ve had a volatile role on the show. Sometimes, I’m there. Sometimes, I’m not. It’s the producers giving me more screen time and a chance to prove myself as an actor — so I wanted to make sure I delivered."
