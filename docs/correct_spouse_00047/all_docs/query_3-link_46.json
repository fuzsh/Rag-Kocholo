        "text": "More reasons not to date your co-workers: \"Gossip Girl\" stars Blake Lively and Penn Badgley have broken up, though the two still appear together on the CW series - where they play an ex-couple.\n\nA joint representative for Lively and Badgley, both 23, confirmed to People magazine Wednesday that the couple ended their relationship, after nearly three years together, last month - specifically, right after New York Fashion Week, according to E! News.\n\nA resident of Badgley's apartment house in Manhattan's West Village told E!, \"I have not seen Blake in a long time, since early fall. . . . Penn was working out every day downstairs and she'd come in with a big bag and stay all the time. . . . But no more. I haven't seen him in the gym in a while, either.\"\n\nLively was spotted together with actor Ryan Gosling at Disneyland earlier this month, posing for fan photos, but declining to be photographed together, E! reported.\n\nBadgley and Lively have nonetheless remained professionals on set. \"It didn't seem like anything was off at all and no one said anything,\" one source told People."
