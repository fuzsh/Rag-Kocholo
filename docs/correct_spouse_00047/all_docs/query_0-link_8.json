        "text": "Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds first crossed paths while filming the 2010 superhero flick, Green Lantern. Although they were both in relationships with other people at the time, the chemistry between them was undeniable. Their friendship eventually evolved into romance, and by October 2011, the duo was a full-fledged couple. Lively and Reynolds tied the knot in a secret ceremony in September 2012 and have been happily married ever since, sharing three beautiful children together.\n\nRyan Reynolds, a Canadian actor, rose to fame after starring in the television series Two Guys and a Girl in the late 1990s. However, it was his lead role in the 2016 superhero film Deadpool that solidified his status as a Hollywood A-lister. Reynolds has had his fair share of high-profile relationships, having previously been engaged to singer Alanis Morissette and married to Scarlett Johansson before finding lasting love with Lively.\n\nDuring the summer of 2011, Blake Lively and Leonardo DiCaprio had a whirlwind romance that caught the attention of fans worldwide. The pair met at the Cannes Film Festival and were spotted getting cozy in various glamorous locations across Europe, from yacht parties in Monte Carlo to romantic strolls through the streets of Verona. However, their jet-setting love affair was short-lived, and by October 2011, they had called it quits, with Lively moving on to her now-husband Ryan Reynolds soon after.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, one of the most iconic actors of his generation, first gained widespread recognition for his captivating performance in the 1993 film What's Eating Gilbert Grape. His career reached new heights with his starring role in the 1997 blockbuster Titanic, propelling him to international stardom. The Oscar-winning actor is no stranger to high-profile relationships, having dated numerous models and actresses such as Gisele Bündchen, Bar Refaeli, and Camila Morrone.\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Gosling sparked dating rumors in late 2010 after they were spotted enjoying each other's company at Disneyland and attending a private event together. While their connection appeared to be more of a flirtation than a full-blown relationship, the two talented actors left fans wondering \"what if\" after their brief dalliance. Ultimately, their rumored romance fizzled out, and both Lively and Gosling went on to find love with other partners.\n\nRyan Gosling, a Canadian actor and musician, made a name for himself as a child star on Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club alongside future superstars like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. His career skyrocketed after starring in the 2004 romantic drama The Notebook, earning him legions of devoted fans. Gosling has since become a Hollywood heavyweight, receiving critical acclaim for roles in films like La La Land and Blade Runner 2049. Prior to his long-term relationship with actress Eva Mendes, Gosling had been linked to fellow celebrities Sandra Bullock and Rachel McAdams.\n\nBlake Lively's earliest high-profile romance was with her Gossip Girl co-star Penn Dayton Badgley. The pair began dating in 2007, just as their on-screen characters Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey embarked on their own tumultuous love story. For three years, the couple's off-screen relationship paralleled their on-screen counterparts, but by September 2010, Lively and Badgley decided to part ways, both personally and professionally.\n\nPenn Dayton Badgley, an American actor, first gained recognition for his roles in the television series The Young and the Restless and The Mountain, before landing the role of Dan Humphrey on the hit show Gossip Girl in 2007. It was this portrayal that cemented his status as a beloved heartthrob within the entertainment industry. Following his split from Lively, Badgley went on to date actress Zoë Kravitz and ultimately married singer Domino Kirke in 2017. He currently stars as the lead in the popular Netflix series You.\n\nBefore her rise to superstardom, Blake Lively briefly dated actor and musician Kelly Blatz. The pair met in 2004 when they were both up-and-coming actors, and their relationship was relatively low-key compared to Lively's subsequent high-profile romances. Despite their young love eventually ending, Lively and Blatz remained friends and even starred alongside one another in the 2006 film Simon Says.\n\nKelly Blatz is an American actor and musician known for his roles in films like Prom Night and television series such as Glory Daze. His acting career began with guest appearances on popular TV shows like 7th Heaven and CSI: Miami, followed by his performance in Simon Says opposite Blake Lively. In addition to his acting career, Blatz is also a talented musician and was previously the lead singer of the band Capra until its disbandment in 2009."
