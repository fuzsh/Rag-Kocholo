        "text": "Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey may have walked down the aisle in the Gossip Girl series finale, but the IRL relationship between Blake Lively and Penn Badgley barely made it through season two. In fact, the actors broke up halfway through the season but kept it a secret from the rest of the cast for months, taking the concept of \"staying friends with an ex\" to a whole other level.\n\nIn a new interview with Vanity Fair, Blake opened up about her off-set romance with Penn. Despite the fact that their entire lives were highly publicized at the time, the pair tried to keep things between them as hush-hush as possible, especially at the beginning and end of their relationship.\n\nWhen Blake and Penn first coupled up, they pretended that they were just friends because they were afraid they'd get in trouble at work. \"I remember there was one point where we were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses,\" Blake told VF. \"[But then] we were like, ‘Oh no, that’s exactly what they want.’ They wanted us all to date. They wanted us all to wear the same clothes that we’re wearing on the show. They wanted that, because then it fed their whole narrative. People could buy into this world.\"\n\n“At the time, I was wearing the same clothes and doing fashion shoots, and dating the same person that my character was dating — or sometimes that person [Dan] was my brother, you never know with Serena — and because of that, what people were projecting onto me was that I was Serena,\" she continued. \"We look the same, and we acted the same as far as they could tell, because I wasn’t doing anything but that show. If [Penn and I] were photographed walking down the street, they didn’t know if it was a paparazzi shot or if it was a shot from the show.\"\n\nThe pair dated for three years before calling it quits in 2010. Blake and Penn both wanted to make sure their personal and professional lives remained as distinct as possible, so they decided to keep things under wraps. Again. \"The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the Season Two finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,” Gossip Girl co-producer and writer Joshua Safran told Vanity Fair. “They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody, which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”\n\nKeep in mind that they spent the next four seasons pretending to be in a relationship. Talk about \"good acting.\""
