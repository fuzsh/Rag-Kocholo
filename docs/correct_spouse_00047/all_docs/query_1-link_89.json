        "text": "Season three of Netflix's hit series You recently dropped and it seems Joe Goldberg's marriage isn't quite going to plan.\n\nBut in real life, it couldn't be further from the truth as actor Penn Badgley has had quite the love life.\n\nH'es also no stranger to playing leading roles with spicy love lives, either.\n\nHis Lonely Boy alter-ego in teen drama Gossip Girl, Dan Humphrey, had quite the long list of lovers.\n\nMost notable was his character's long-running obsession with It-girl Serena van der Woodsen ( Blake Lively ) which led to that epic series finale reveal of Gossip Girl's true identity.\n\nHowever, he dated characters played by Jessica Szohr, Hilary Duff, and lusted after Leighton Meester's Blair Waldorf across the show.\n\nIn You, he's been even more dysfunctional as Joe Goldberg, a stalker and murderer obsessed with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail) and Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti).\n\nYet, Penn has been a bit luckier in love in real life.\n\nDuring his years at Lewis & Clark college, Penn is reported to have dated his student sweetheart Seneca Rice, however, they parted ways shortly after their tenure ended.\n\nNext came a major love for the handsome young actor as he was cast in Gossip Girl.\n\nHe did, of course, date his co-star Blake Lively from 2007 to 2010.\n\nInitially, the pair kept their relationship secret as their profiles came to international attention due to the hit show.\n\nEventually, Blake told Vanity Fair why they decided to keep the relationship private in a piece for the show's ten-year anniversary.\n\nShe said: \"I remember there was one point where we were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses.\n\n\"[But then] we were like, ‘Oh no, that’s exactly what they want'. They wanted us all to date. They wanted us all to wear the same clothes that we’re wearing on the show.\n\n\"They wanted that, because then it fed their whole narrative. People could buy into this world.\"\n\nThe pair eventually split in 2010 while still on the show, and remained very amicable, professional, and friendly on-set.\n\nTheir characters Dan and Serena even married in the finale.\n\nSpeaking to Elle in 2013, Penn said of their romance: \"I don't know if I can distill it into a sentence, or even articulate it.\n\n\"We were very much caught up in the show, which itself was a six-year endurance test.\n\n\"Our relationship was a part of that and helped us through it. I mean, like anything valuable, it was good and it was bad and it was a learning experience.\"\n\nBlake Lively went on to marry Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds in 2012, but Penn confirmed he did not send a wedding gift.\n\nIt sounds like Penn enjoyed his fame from Gossip Girl for a while when it came to the ladies, but sadly it was never enough.\n\nDespite some fun nights, he added: \"There's a reason the French call the moment of orgasm la petite mort , \"the little death.\" No matter how good the moment was, the moment after is always revealing.\"\n\nAfter Blake, Penn dated actress Zoe Kravitz from 2011.\n\nHowever, distance became an issue between the couple as they both had busy work schedules.\n\nPenn admitted that there were \"always a lot of arguments\" but they tried to be honest with one another.\n\nThe couple split in 2013, however, apparently it was completely amicable.\n\n\"It just wasn't working,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"It really did end on good terms, though.\"\n\nZoe began a relationship with actor Karl Glusman in 2016, becoming engaged in 2018, and marrying him last year.\n\nIn 2014, Penn had moved on to a new relationship, however, with English-American singer Domino Kirke.\n\nShe is the sister of Girls actress Jemima Kirke and Mistress America star Lola Kirke.\n\nDomino previously had a son named Cassius from her relationship with musician Morgan O'Kane.\n\nSpeaking to Hey Mama about them dating, Domino said of life as a single mother: \"A couple of years ago, I was sad and a little scared that that was going to be it for me, but I was good at it.\n\n\"I had a really good thing with my kid and we were like this little team. Penn and I were dating, but it wasn't nearly as serious as it is now, of course. I didn't think marriage was in the cards for us.\"\n\nThankfully, marriage was on the cards for the pair as they tied the knot in a small courthouse ceremony in 2017.\n\nThey proceeded to have a larger ceremony a few months later.\n\nSadly, the couple suffered two miscarriages in their relationship and the pair began to doubt they would have biological children together.\n\nThankfully, in February this year, the pair announced that they were expecting their first child together.\n\nDomino wrote on Instagram : \"On the road again... pregnancy after loss is a whole other thing. After two miscarriages in a row we were ready to call it. I stopped trusting my body and started to accept the fact that I was done.\n\n\"As a birth attendant, I've seen and heard it all. It takes everything I've got to detach lovingly from the losses I've been present for and be in my own experience. When I was pregnant at 25, I knew nothing. I had no community. I dove in blissfully unaware about birth and its mysteries.\n\n\"Now, with 10 years worth of experience to pull from, I treasure my birth community and the knowledge I have. You're already teaching us how to stay in the day in a way we've never had to, little one. Thank you.\"\n\nThe couple then went on to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary on February 27, 2021.\n\nHere's wishing them all the best in the future as Penn seems to have finally found his happily ever after.\n\nYou seasons 1 - 3 are available to watch on Netflix now."
