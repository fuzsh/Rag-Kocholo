        "text": "When it comes to couple goals, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds might just be it.\n\nThe dynamic duo, who welcomed their fourth child last year and will celebrate 12 years of marriage in September, is known for having a great sense of humor and poking fun at each other on social media. And their latest playful exchange is unfolding on Reynolds' \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" co-star Hugh Jackman's Instagram post.\n\nIn a July 2 post, Jackman shared photo of Reynolds sitting in a chair and pointing a finger at the camera. The \"Greatest Showman\" star captioned it: “You want me to put this away?” — Ryan Reynolds, co-star, mouth breather, a------.\"\n\nLively responded to the picture and caption in the comments, writing, \"My thirst has been trapped.\"\n\nAfter over a decade of marriage, the couple and their family continue to grow. Curious how they got to this point? Here’s a look back at their love story.\n\n2010: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively meet but are in other relationships\n\nThe couple first crossed paths in 2010 while filming “Green Lantern.” Lively and Reynolds were love interests in the movie, but were romantically linked to others in real life at the time: Lively was dating her “Gossip Girl” co-star Penn Badgley and Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson.\n\n2010: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are both back on the market\n\nIn late 2010, Reynolds and Johansson split, heading for divorce, and Lively and Badgley also went their separate ways.\n\n2011: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively go on a double date — but not with each other\n\nAfter they both split up with their partners, Lively and Reynolds got together on a double date the following year. Reynolds shared a story about the evening while chatting with Entertainment Weekly in 2016.\n\n“We were buddies then. I remember it was funny because, for about a year after ‘Green Lantern’ had come and gone and all that stuff, we were both single. We went on a double date. She was on a date with another guy, and I was on a date with another girl,” he said.\n\n2012: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively get married\n\nWhen you know, you know, and this couple certainly seemed to know they were right for each other because they wasted no time getting married.\n\nLively and Reynolds tied the knot in September 2012 in a private celebration in South Carolina. In 2014, Lively told Vogue (per Harper's Bazaar) that she accidentally burnt her wedding dress on the big day.\n\n“Florence Welch was singing and they brought out these sparklers, and I’m watching her sing,” she said at the time. “I look down and my wedding dress has a big burn mark from one of the sparklers. Right on the front.”\n\nLuckily, Reynolds helped her put things into perspective later on.\n\n“Later, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, ‘Isn't that beautiful?’ I said, ‘What?’ And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, ‘You’ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved.’ Now that’s my favorite part of the dress,” she said.\n\n2014: The couple makes their red carpet debut as a married couple\n\nIs there any better place to make your red carpet debut than the Met Gala? We think not. Reynolds and Lively must have felt the same way because they stepped out as husband and wife at the high-profile event in May 2014.\n\n2014: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively welcome their first child\n\nIn October 2014 the couple revealed that they were expecting their first child together. Just two months later, they welcomed their first child, a daughter named James.\n\n2016: Ryan Reynolds reveals the moment he fell for Blake Lively\n\nIn a 2016 interview with GQ, Reynolds spoke about the moment when he truly started to fall head over heels in love with Lively.\n\n“(W)e were hanging out at this little restaurant in Tribeca that’s open really late, and this song came on and I was just like, ‘Want to dance?’” he said.\n\n“No one was in there, so it was just totally empty,\" he continued. “And it was just one of those moments where halfway through the dance, it was like, ‘Oh, I think I just crossed a line.’”\n\n2016: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively welcome their second child\n\nThe proud parents revealed in April 2016 that they were expecting their second child. Five months later, they welcomed a daughter named Inez.\n\n2016: The family steps out in public for Ryan Reynolds’ Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony\n\nWhen Reynolds received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016, his wife and two daughters were there to support him. During his speech, the star thanked Lively for standing by his side.\n\n“I want to thank my wife, Blake, who is sitting right there who is everything to me,” he said. “You are the best thing — the best thing — that has ever happened to me ... second only to this star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.”\n\n2019: The couple welcomes their third child\n\nAfter announcing her pregnancy in May 2019, Lively gave birth to the couple’s third daughter, Betty, in October 2019.\n\n2022: Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively co-chair the Met Gala\n\nThe couple went back to the place where they made their debut as a married couple — the Met Gala — in 2022 and served as co-chairs of the event.\n\n2022: Ryan Reynolds gives a shoutout to his family in awards acceptance speech\n\nWhile accepting a People’s Choice Award in December 2023, Reynolds called out his wife and children.\n\n“I got to thank my family: Blake and my three daughters. It’s going to be a fourth child very soon. If it happens tonight while I’m here, I will be looking for a couch to sleep on for a little while,” he joked.\n\n“But, Blake, my girls, you are quite literally my heart. You’re my hope. You’re my happiness,” he said. “I joke that my family exhausts me, but in reality you give me more strength than any man could possibly deserve.”\n\n2023: The couple welcomes their fourth child\n\nLively announced September 2022 that she was expecting her fourth child. Five months later, she hinted that she had given birth. The couple hasn't shared the gender or name of the child yet.\n\nIn April 2023, Reynolds opened up about becoming a family of six during an interview with ET.\n\n“You know, two to three was a huge jump ... three to four less so,” he said. “I cannot speak for my wife, but it’s just from what I’ve observed.”\n\n2024: Blake Lively shares insight on relationship with Ryan Reynolds\n\nDuring an interview with longtime friend and former “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” co-star Amber Tamblyn in February 2024 , Lively shared some insight on her relationship with Reynolds, including the one rule they set when they got together.\n\n“I’m used to working hard and going and going and going and going and not stopping,” she told Tamblyn on her Substack show “Further Ado,\" recalling how long her days were when she filmed “Gossip Girls” for six years. “It was nonstop.”\n\n“And then when Ryan and I got together, we made a rule not to work at the same time,” she continued. “Just so that we could always prioritize our personal life.”\n\nHowever, Lively said that rule means “working really hard when we’re not. Just like financial planning and sustaining that; it takes balance.”\n\nBut Lively does not waste her time when her husband is working. The actor also shared that she sometimes takes up new hobbies to pass the time.\n\n“So when I was in New Orleans, he was on a movie and that’s when I painted because I was there with him,” she told Tamblyn. “But when you have free time suddenly, which I don’t know since having kids, but I did, I felt like I was busy before I had kids. But carving it out to find a new skill, even if it’s for an hour or two, just makes you feel (good).”\n\nShe then added, “It’s nice to keep learning about yourself.”"
