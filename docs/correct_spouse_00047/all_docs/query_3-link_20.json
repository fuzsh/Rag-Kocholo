        "text": "Gossip Girl turns 10 today, and in honor of its big 1-0, Vanity Fair interviewed the cast about the show's history and legacy. There are so many gems to the piece (like Ed Westwick's email to the VF reporter: \"I still am not sure who GG was lol\"), including one tidbit about Blake Lively and Penn Badgley's breakup.\n\nBlake and Penn dated on and off for the first three seasons of Gossip Girl (2007 to 2010), mirroring the way their characters Serena and Dan dated during those same years. One major difference: Serena and Dan got married in the finale, while Blake and Penn parted ways; she married Ryan Reynolds in 2012 and he married Domino Kirke in February.\n\nThe Gossip Girl couple kept their relationship super private, and it turns out that they didn't even tell their colleagues on set that they had broken up.\n\n\"The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the Season 2 finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,\" executive producer Josh Safran told Vanity Fair. \"They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.\"\n\nThat said, the apparent similarities between the on-screen and off-screen relationships only heightened fans' interest.\n\n\"At the time, I was wearing the same clothes and doing fashion shoots, and dating the same person that my character was dating — or sometimes that person [Dan] was my brother, you never know with Serena — and because of that, what people were projecting onto me was that I was Serena,\" Blake told VF. \"We look the same, and we acted the same as far as they could tell, because I wasn’t doing anything but that show. If [Penn and I] were photographed walking down the street, they didn’t know if it was a paparazzi shot or if it was a shot from the show... At the time, what was heightened was, wow, it all looks similar from the outside, but it’s so different on the inside.\"\n\nIn 2013, Penn gave a rare interview about his relationship with Blake to Elle.\n\n\"We were very much caught up in the show, which itself was a six-year endurance test,\" he said. \"Our relationship was a part of that and helped us through it. I mean, like anything valuable, it was good and it was bad and it was a learning experience.\"\n\nUgh. Is it just me, or does anyone else find this adorable on-set photo (from 2008) hard to look at now?"
