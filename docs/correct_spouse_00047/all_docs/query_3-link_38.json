        "text": "On-screen and off-screen, nearly ten years ago, Gossip Girl’s Blake Lively and Penn Badgley—aka Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey—fell in love IRL. The two dated for three years, starting in 2007, and broke up in 2010 when they were both just 23.\n\nThey initially denied the romance and said they were just friends—in part, Blake Lively revealed to Vanity Fair in their 10-year Gossip Girl oral history piece, because they thought they'd get in trouble at work.\n\n\"I remember there was one point where we were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses,\" Lively said. \"[But then] we were like, ‘Oh no, that’s exactly what they want.’ They wanted us all to date. They wanted us all to wear the same clothes that we’re wearing on the show. They wanted that, because then it fed their whole narrative. People could buy into this world.\"\n\nAnd it worked, Lively continued. “At the time, I was wearing the same clothes and doing fashion shoots, and dating the same person that my character was dating—or sometimes that person [Dan] was my brother, you never know with Serena—and because of that, what people were projecting onto me was that I was Serena. We look the same, and we acted the same as far as they could tell, because I wasn’t doing anything but that show. If [Penn and I] were photographed walking down the street, they didn’t know if it was a paparazzi shot or if it was a shot from the show.\"\n\n\"At the time, what was heightened was, wow, it all looks similar from the outside, but it’s so different on the inside,” she added.\n\nThe two still managed to keep their personal lives private. When they did break up, the crew didn’t know for months. “The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the season 2 finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,” co-producer and writer Joshua Safran told Vanity Fair. “They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”"
