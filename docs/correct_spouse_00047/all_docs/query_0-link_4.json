        "text": "Penn Badgley, star of the Netflix series You, has been a fan favourite since he played Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl.\n\nPenn (36) recently opened up about his relationship with former Gossip Girl co-star Blake Lively. They were together from 2007 to 2010.\n\nThe actress married Ryan Reynolds in 2012.\n\nNow, more than 10 years later, Penn says Blake was a positive influence in his life, and he's grateful to have had a relationship with her.\n\n“Beyond our relationship, I didn’t think anybody was going to be interested in me publicly,” Penn says.\n\nHe credits Blake for keeping him on the straight and narrow, and helping him not give in to the temptations of drugs or booze, like many other up-and-coming celebrities.\n\n“To be honest, I never struggled with substances. Blake didn’t drink and I think our relationship, in some ways, saved me from forcing myself to go down that road,” Penn says.\n\nWorking on Gossip Girl, he says, was fun, but at that time he also found himself facing \"nothing short of a spiritual crisis\".\n\n\"Like anybody who experiences some degree of fame and wealth, I was presented with a universal truth,” he told Variety.\n\n\"Not only does [fame] not make your life better or easier, it actually can greatly complicate things, and make you quite unhappy.”\n\nHe overcame his existential despair when he found the Baha'i faith, which teaches that humanity is all connected.\n\nThis, he said, offered him \"the most committed pathway from individual transformation to social transformation\".\n\nThe former child actor has been enjoying a resurgence in popularity thanks to his role as beloved serial killer Joe Goldberg in the Netflix series You. His popular TikTok videos have delighted his fans too.\n\nPenn posted his first video on the app – appropriately enough, it was a clip of him dancing to Taylor Swift's Anti-Hero – last October, and he's since gained more than 3 million followers on the platform.\n\n“For years I thought, 'I’ll get a TikTok account when the time is right', and then Taylor’s record came out. It just seemed the song wouldn’t have worked with anyone else. Me. Joe. Anti-Hero, Taylor Swift? It just was the perfect moment.”\n\nThe video got a response from Taylor, a big You fan.\n\n“OMG!!!! Between this and the use of Exile in the You season 3 finale, I’m fully expecting a cameo in season 4,” she wrote.\n\nAhead of the release of the second half of season four, Netflix dropped a trailer for the final episodes of You, which show the return of Joe's wife, Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti).\n\nOf course, Love is supposed to have died, so it's anyone's guess if she's actually alive, if Joe's hallucinating, or if it's simply a flashback sequence.\n\nThe final episodes of this season of You will stream on Netflix from 9 March."
