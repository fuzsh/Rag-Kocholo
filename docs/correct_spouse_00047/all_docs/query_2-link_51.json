        "text": "Heads up, Gossip Girl fans: Penn Badgley is opening up about his past relationship with Gossip Girl co-star Blake Lively!\n\nIn his cover story for Variety, the 36-year-old You star touched on his previous relationship with Blake, who played his on-screen love interest on the show as well. Penn and Blake are known to have been good friends prior to filming the series back in the day.\n\nHe said about the beginning of Gossip Girl and all the tabloid fodder over him and Blake:\n\n“Beyond out relationship, I don’t think anybody was going to be interested in me publicly.”\n\nHe spoke about feeling a “dark undercurrent” during the latter years of the iconic show, whether he indulged in substances, and how he feels Blake may have “saved” him. Penn candidly shared:\n\n“There’s two ways I see them: Fun and fast-paced… a dark undercurrent that would bottom out in my later 20s…to be honest, I never struggled with substance.\n\nBlake didn’t drink, and I think our relationship in some ways saved me from forcing myself to go down that road.”\n\nRelated Posts"
