        "text": "Penn Badgley and Blake Lively are some of Hollywood's most well-known stars. The two famous actors once worked together on a joint project that gave them great fame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Lively may be a star in her own right; however, the actress has become well-known as the wife of Ryan Reynolds, a top name in Hollywood. The couple recently revealed that they are expecting their fourth child.\n\nOn the other hand, Penn Badgley has also been married for the past five years. He's also making his mark in the entertainment industry and continuing to land leading roles. Lively and Badgley once had a relationship and dated for a few years.\n\nBlake Lively and Penn Badgley at Philippe in New York on May 5, 2008. | Source: Getty Images\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively Began Their Relationship on the Set of “Gossip Girl”\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively have a long history together. The actors had known each other since Lively was 11 years old. However, the two only got close on the set of \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir relationship wouldn't have become intimate if Badgley had continued to decline to be in the series. The actor was offered the part of Dan Humphrey in 2007 numerous times before finally agreeing to take the role.\n\nBadgley and Lively only met during \"Gossip Girl\" filming in 2007, where their characters in the series, Dan and Serena, were a couple. By the end of the first season in 2008, there were rumors they were in a relationship. The co-stars initially denied the rumors, with Lively saying at the time that people always try to \"create things that aren't there\".\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively at Progress Energy Park, Home of Al Lang Field, on January 31, 2009, in St. Petersburg, Florida. | Source: Getty Images\n\nShe said they tried to keep their relationship low-key and pretended they were just friends.\n\nThey continued to hide their relationship but were spotted together in Mexico in May 2008 during a romantic getaway. During their vacation at a luxury resort, the lovebirds kissed numerous times while enjoying themselves in the sun and spending time at the beach and by the pool. They dated for three years before they went their separate ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively Showed Professionalism after Breaking Up\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively were entirely private regarding their relationship, and the two stars were just as quiet about their breakup. The people on set didn't even notice that they were no longer together.\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively walk to the \"Gossip Girl\" movie set on the Upper East Side on August 11, 2009, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe former couple's co-star, Chace Crawford, spoke about what it was like on the set after their split on \"Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\" in 2019. He revealed that Badgley and Lively were very professional and said there was no drama on the set. He described the former couple as the \"most mature people in the world\".\n\nFollowing their breakup, the two eventually spoke about the split. The \"You\" star revealed in the \"Men's Health\" November 2009 issue that he enjoyed being in a relationship where both parties could \"identify with what the other is expecting\". He also stated that being involved with someone you work with \"might not always be the smartest move\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn Badgley and Blake Lively at the Gramercy Park Hotel on October 12, 2009 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe \"All I See is You\" actress spoke to Vanity Fair in 2017 about the breakup. She said they tried to keep their relationship low-key and pretended they were just friends for fear of getting in trouble at work. The star further said:\n\n\"I remember there was one point where we were just afraid of how our personal lives overlapping our work life could be perceived by our bosses. [But then] we were like, 'Oh no, that's exactly what they want.'\"\n\nBlake Lively’s Life after Breaking up with Penn Badgley\n\nBlake Lively went on to date a few other top Hollywood actors after her breakup with Penn Badgley. In 2010, the actress started dating Ryan Gosling; however, their relationship was short-lived. The stars never even confirmed if they were dating then, and rumors that they were a couple started after they went to Disneyland in October 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year in 2011, \"The Shallows\" actress had a relationship with Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio. This relationship, which reportedly began in May 2011, was also short-lived and has been described as a summer fling. They spent the summer of 2011 together trekking across Europe, and a few months later, in September 2011, the couple was separated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA month after the actors split, Lively started dating her now husband, Ryan Reynolds. Lively and Reynolds became husband and wife on September 9, 2012, and have three children together.\n\nLively recently revealed that she is expecting another baby. Due to the actress having three children and expecting her fourth, she hasn't starred in many major projects since the end of \"Gossip Girl\". Her most notable projects after the series were \"The Age of Adaline\" and \"A Simple Favor\".\n\nDomino Kirke and Penn Badgley attend The Weinstein Company and Lyft host a special screening of \"3 Generations\" on April 30, 2017, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images\n\nPenn Badgley’s Life after Breaking up with Blake Lively\n\nPenn Badgley also dated other people after his breakup with Blake Lively.
