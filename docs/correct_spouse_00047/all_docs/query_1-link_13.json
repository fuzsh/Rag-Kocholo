        "text": "Penn Badgley and Blake Lively, both 23, have ended their three-year romance, a rep for the Gossip Girl costars exclusively tells the new Us Weekly (on newsstands now).\n\nThey called it quits in mid-September.\n\n\"They’re professionals,\" an insider tells US Weekly. \"They're still good friends and hang out on the set.\"\n\nThe source says that the duo -- who met as preteen actors in L.A. -- \"kept this news to themselves for a while.\"\n\nIndeed, they have always taken a drama-free approach to their relationship.\n\nBadgley told Us last fall that working together while dating didn't present any problems: \"Some would say it’s a double-edged sword, but in our case, we manage to balance it well.\"\n\nEven those closest to the twosome may be shocked to hear the news.\n\n\"Nobody on set had any idea,\" says the insider. \"They're really just private.\"\n\nTis the season for breakups I guess.\n\nEveryone is ending their relationship. One of my co-workers just told me that she's planning on breaking up with her boyfriend of 4 years today.\n\nI'm not really surprised about Penn and Blake. She's clearly more famous than him and Blake seems a little press hungry sometimes. She likes attention and, according to Lainey Gossip, probably wants to date someone who will get her even more attention.\n\nI hope that doesn't sound mean, but it's probably the truth. That's how this industry works most of the time.\n\nBlake Lively & Penn Badgley Broke Up\n\nA spokesbitch for Gossip Girl's Blake Lively and Penn Badgley (who looks like a Muppet-fied shaved Monchhichis to me) confirm to UsWeekly that the two pieces of unripe jicama ended their relationship back in September. Blake probably told her rep about this back then but b*tch is always mumbling like she's got narcolepsy of the jaw so he didn't know what the hell she was talking about until now.\n\nA source type tells Star Magazine that their break up had nothing to do with the blind items that suggest Blake is trying to pull Ben Affleck's wedding ring off with her chocha, or the pictures of her licking on Ryan Gosling's cream. No, the source says 23-year-old Blake is ready to start a family, but Penn wants to keep his life baby diarrhea-free for a while. The source went on to say, \"Blake comes from a traditional Southern Baptist background, and she’s always had her eye on getting married and having lots of children. The pressure on him to settle down at such a young age finally reached the point where he realized he and Blake couldn’t get on the same page, timing-wise, about starting a family.\"\n\nBlake is in The Green Lantern and Penn was in fuc*ing The Stepfather, so methinks this split has less to do with her wanting a baby in her arms and more with her wanting a piece with a Google ranking higher than hers. Famous dudes of Hollywood better submit their applications now, because spaces are filling up fast (SPOILER ALERT: You know Blake is going to end up with a trick like Shia LaDouche or Leonardo DiCatchaho. b*tch is predictable).\n\ndlisted\n\nA spokesbitch for Gossip Girl's Blake Lively and Penn Badgley (who looks like a Muppet-fied shaved Monchhichis to me) confirm to UsWeekly that the two pieces of unripe jicama ended their relationship back in September. Blake probably told her rep about this back then but b*tch is always mumbling like she's got narcolepsy of the jaw so he didn't know what the hell she was talking about until now.\n\nI couldn't care less if they're together or not. They never made public appearances together anyway. Blake seems to be so busy with kissing Anna Wintour's *** and Penn never seemed to be around at all those events, it's probably just not his thing and he got tired of it or something.\n\nWhile I do believe Penn and Blake are done, Us Weekly is full of ****! They broke up in mid-September? There's photos of Penn and Blake kissing on set of Gossip Girl (they weren't filming scenes) on September 23rd. AND when asked by David Letterman if she had a boyfriend, Blake said yes and proceeded to tell a story of how she pranked him. That interview took place September 27th. So again, Us Weekly fabricated a story.\n\nIts much more likely they broke up towards the end of September or early October. And I doubt she's dating Ryan Gosling. I think they're just friends... I guess the media forgets that a guy and girl can be friends and friends only.\n\n^Do we have a thread on tfs on that Weinstein Girl issue? I had never heard of that before someone else mentioned it in the GG thread but I looked it up and it sounds horrible! I would like to know more about it and what other girls are involved in that apart from Blake.\n\nBasically every actress who wears Marchesa non-stop and is in pictures with Harvey at some sort of party, is involved with him.\n\nWait, I'll show you an article from LaineyGossip:\n\nEvery couple of years or so, Harvey likes to pick a young actress, turn her into a star. Or try to at least. It happened with my Gwyneth. The Alba b*tch had her chance, Anne Hathaway too, now it looks like Blake Lively has caught Harvey’s eye. A deal with the devil, you could say. Curious to see then if Blake shows up in Marchesa on carpet after carpet. It’s so obvious.\n\n^Do we have a thread on tfs on that Weinstein Girl issue?
