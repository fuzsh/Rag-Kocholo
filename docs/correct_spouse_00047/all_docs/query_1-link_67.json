        "text": "Attention, Upper East Siders—and the rest of the world—Gossip Girl's resident angsty loner Penn Badgley is now a married man. Yep, according to E!, the actor quietly wed musician Domino Kirke — sister of Girls actress Jemima Kirke — earlier today in a Brooklyn courthouse ceremony.\n\nAnd while it appears to have been a pretty small affair, with only several close family members and friends present, the photos from the ceremony look gorgeous, with Domino in a white lace dress with three-quarter-length sleeves and Penn in a dapper navy suit.\n\nAnd while there's no word on whether Taylor Momsen, Leighton Meester, Blake Lively or any other Gossip Girl stars were at the ceremony, there was more than enough love going around, as evidenced by Domino's sister Lola posting a sweet photo to Instagram. A picture of the three sisters and Domino's son, Cassius, she captioned the shot with an especially heartfelt message to her sister: \"When someone gets married in a courthouse, it's really an open invitation to everyone, but the beautiful bride to explore all that fashion has to offer. Here, I try a look simply called 'Pants,' as Cassius goes for 'That Dude from #incubus' and Jemima experiments with 'Off to Therapy!' Congratulations @dominokirke. We love you.\"\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnother friend shared a photo of the happy couple together, with the sentiment \"Congrats to a couple beautiful people ❤.\"\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nCulture\n\nOn C,XOXO, Camila Cabello Is Overshadowed by Her Own Taste\n\nBut the reality of C,XOXO is more confusing and weirder than mere mimicry.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nEmily Ratajkowski Just Took Tomato Girl Summer Very Literally\n\nAnother reminder that this is more than a passing trend.\n\nCulture\n\nHow New Girl Group KATSEYE Grew From Dream to Debut\n\nThe members of KATSEYE sit down with Teen Vogue in an exclusive interview about their long-anticipated debut.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nMegan Thee Stallion Approves the Silk Scarf for Hot Girl Summer\n\nIf it's good enough for the Hot Girl Coach, it's good enough for me."
