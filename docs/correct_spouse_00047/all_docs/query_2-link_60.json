After weeks of rumours, the pair have finally confirmed the end of their three-year relationship\n\nAfter weeks of speculation their romance was on the rocks, Gossip Girl pair Blake lively and Penn Badley have gone their separate ways, confirming their split via a rep.\n\nSEE ALL THE LATEST GOSSIP GIRL PICTURES HERE!\n\nBlake and Penn’s break-up follows in the footsteps of their onscreen personas, sexy Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey, who also ended their romance during the US hit show.\n\nThey first met at the tender age of 12, but it definitely wasn’t love at first sight, as they didn’t get on in the beginning.\n\nThe sparks didn’t fly until they reunited on the set of Gossip Girl in 2007 and went public with their romance a year later, earning themselves a place as one of the hottest Hollywood couples around.\n\n'We didn't like each other at all then...but we've become very close,' Blake said of her beau last year.\n\n'It's mad when we go out - it feels like being Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. We didn't set out to be a celebrity couple, but when you work opposite someone you develop chemistry.'\n\nBut even though a rep for the pair has confirmed to Us Weekly they have split, it’s thought they’ll stay friends.\n\n'They're professionals,' one insider revealed. 'They're still good friends and hang out on the set.\n\nSEE ALL THE LATEST GOSSIP GIRL PICTURES HERE!\n\nCELEBRITY SPLITS 2010"
