Blake Lively married Ryan Reynolds; it makes total sense why she’d be an incredible prankster, with her victims being her Gossip Girl cast members. On his podcast Podcrushed, Penn Badgley shared that Lively is “very serious about pranks” and how she tricked him into thinking his dad was Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler during their time on Gossip Girl. “I get an email, just like, ‘There’s this press item that we’re trying to kill, but just so you know, somebody thinks or Steven Tyler thinks he’s your dad,’” Badgley shared. “Didn’t even think about it for a moment because who in their right mind would think that that’s true.” I mean, they both have curly hair…

It escalated to his publicist explaining that the story wasn’t going away, and a few days later, on April Fools, Lively suggested that Badgley call his mother to confirm. Because why would Dan Humphrey’s mom ever lie to him? “My mom is so not an actress, so not a prankster either, and she’s upset,” he continued. “I’m like, ‘Mom, why are you upset?!’ And then she takes a pause— the pause that sold me — and she goes, ‘Why do you think we moved out of Maryland?’” It wasn’t ‘til he realized it was April 1 that the joke was over. If anyone would be hiding a secret that big, it would be Gossip Girl.
