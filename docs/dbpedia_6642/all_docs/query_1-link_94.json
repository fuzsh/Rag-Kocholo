Conservatives love to bemoan the supposed liberal bias in 'the media' but aside from a few cases that are easily balanced by the likes of Fox or The Wall Street Journal, there is no bias that exists unless one considered anything other than a conservative view to be a biased one. Simply, if one is conservative, an unbiased perspective will, by definition, be to the left. This does not mean there is a left-wing or liberal bias, but that the centrist perspective is towards the liberal end of the spectrum from the conservative position.<BR><BR>dasein\n\nMar 28, 2002\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#6\n\nmedia = large corporate conglomerates = slanted to the right<BR><BR>but rather than just giving you such a facile response, there are a few points to consider.<BR><BR>1. conservative and liberal are not absolutes. to ignatius loyola, we're all dirty stinking liberals.<BR><BR>2. right wing critics are often more concerned w/ \"insidious\" cultural values. thus, to them, as big media espouses all sorts of progressive social causes, it is obviously biased to the left.<BR><BR>3. left wing critics are more concerned w/ social concentrations of power, wealth, and priveledge. thus, to them, as big media serves to justify the social order (and satisfy the demands of its corporate owners), it is the most significant tool of reaction.\n\nMar 28, 2002\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#7\n\nTime Magazine is crap. Pure, unadulturated, unmitigated, immutable crap.<BR><BR>Keep in mind that Time Magazine is owned by AOL Time-Warner. It's a massive corporation.

Well, if you dont include the opinions of people who think it's corporate propaganda, which most don't. TIME certainly dosen't stick out as being particularly left or right. <BR><BR>If I were you I'd grab a few issues of TIME (or just go to time.com) and Google the names of some of the columnists.

On some issues they are very liberal. Go back and read their 'reportage' over the years on gun control and the language used in the stories. They are very slanted to a pro guncontrol position. <BR><BR>On other issues the bias isn't nearly as pronounced. <BR><BR>Note: The above was based on my experience reading TIME more than 10 years ago. The bias exhibited on the gun issue alone caused me to spend my newsmagazine dollars on US News and World Report instead of on Time. US News is more balanced (IMHO) than Time or Newsweek.<BR><BR>Things may have changed, but with Ted Turner having a say in AOL-TimeWarner, I doubt it.\n\nMar 28, 2002\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#13\n\nThis discussion is focussed on American media. In that case, it's bound to be a boring conversation. There's one thing that rules American media--neither liberalism nor conservatism, or any political doctrine for that matter--and it's money.<BR><BR>I find American sensitivity towards the political spectrum absurd. Nothing in mainstream media here is even close to being truly leftist or sternly conservative, and rarely is any of the \"content\" worth a serious discussion.
