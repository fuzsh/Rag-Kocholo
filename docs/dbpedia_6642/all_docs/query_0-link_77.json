        "text": "Time magazine declared Taylor Swift as 2023’s person of the year on Wednesday, and accompanied the announcement with a rare interview from the artist in which she reflected on the year of her career that truly put her on top of the world. Unsurprisingly, right-wing commentators took the opportunity to interpret Swift’s well-earned success to launch into a conspiracy theory bender.\n\nSwift, who has publicly aligned herself with the pro-choice movement and declared her opposition to former President Donald Trump, has become the ire of a vocal group of conservatives hell-bent on the bizarre notion that the singer is a political weapon aimed at the upcoming presidential election.\n\nEnd of Wokeness, a far-right account with nearly 2 million followers, credited Swift with having enough rizz to convince a “cult-like following” to “drink poisoned Kool Aid for her.” In the same post, the account prophesied that the singer-songwriter’s next step would be “Politics,” adding, “If you don’t think the regime has plans to weaponize her just in time for 2024, you clearly have not been paying attention.”\n\nEchoing the far-right fear-mongering, former Trump immigration adviser Stephen Miller tweeted, “What’s happening with Taylor Swift is not organic.”\n\nAs Trump surrogates stumbled over themselves to chime in, Jack Posobiec, a well-known alt-right troll whom Trump has retweeted, piped, “The Taylor Swift girlboss psyop has been fully activated.” Posobiec also took a lame jab at Travis Kelce. “From her hand-selected vaccine shill boyfriend to her DINK lifestyle to her upcoming 2024 voter operation for Democrats on abortion rights It’s all coming” he bemoaned.\n\nTrending\n\nJeffrey Clark, the former Trump DOJ official criminally-charged in Georgia in connection with efforts to overturn the 2020 election, reposted Posobiec’s comment along with his own vision for the future. “This is what happens when we cede culture to the Left. Brainless youth raising themselves on Taylor Swift’s saccharine bland music and that washing over into the serious world of politics,” he wrote. “If we reach the point where Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Taylor Swift run for office together we will have truly reached full-on Idiocracy where Mike Judge imagined ‘President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho,'” he added."
