        "text": "This page only shows primary logo variants.\n\nFor other related logos and images, see:\n\nOther\n\n1990–1993 1993–2001 2001–2003 2003–2018 2018–2022 2019–2022\n\nWarnerMedia, LLC was a wholly-owned entertainment and media subsidiary of American telecommunications conglomerate AT&T. It was founded on January 10, 1990 as Time Warner from the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications.\n\nTime Warner (first era)\n\n1990–1993\n\nDesigner: Chermayeff & Geismar\n\nTypography: Futura Extra Bold\n\nLaunched: January 10, 1990\n\nThe company's original identity was created by Chermayeff & Geismar, and included an \"eye-ear\" logo designed by Steff Geissbuhler (which was adopted for Time Warner Cable).[1]\n\n1993–2001\n\nDesigner: Anspach Grossman Portugal\n\nTypography: Electra\n\nLaunched: April 1993\n\nIn April 1993, Time Warner's eye-ear logo was replaced by a more reserved and traditional serif-based wordmark created by Anspach Grossman Portugal.[2]\n\nAOL Time Warner\n\n2001–2003\n\nDesigner: Landor Associates\n\nTypography: Times New Roman\n\nLaunched: January 11, 2001\n\nIn January 2000, AOL stated its intentions to purchase Time Warner for $164 billion. The deal, officially filed on February 11, 2000, employed a merger structure in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000, and gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger later that day. The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal Communications Commission, and had already been cleared by the European Commission on October 11, 2000.\n\nThe combined company was renamed as AOL Time Warner Inc. Landor Associates was responsible for designing the new logo, which retained the last one's horizontal lines, but added the word \"AOL\" next to \"TIME WARNER\", which had been re-rendered as \"Time Warner\". Also, the wordmark was colored blue, and the lines were recolored in a pale shade of blue. The font for the name of the company is Times New Roman.\n\nTime Warner (second era)\n\n2003–2018\n\nDesigner: Joe Finocchiaro for\n\nLippincott Mercer\n\nTypography: Bodoni BE Regular (modified)\n\nLaunched: October 16, 2003\n\nStarting in November 2002, the company alternated with the ​Time Warner and AOL Time Warner names, until October 16, 2003, when its name was legally and officially reverted back to Time Warner. The logo used upon reverting back to Time Warner retained the blue color from the previous logo, but removed the horizonal lines above and below the wordmark, uses the Bodoni BE Regular font, and no spaces between the words \"Time\" and \"Warner\"; thus, the logo (as well as on its byline below the logos of its subsidiaries) is stylized as \"TimeWarner\". Lippincott Mercer was hired to create the company's new corporate identity.\n\nThe Time Warner name was concurrently used with the WarnerMedia name from June 14, 2018 to 2020 as the former is still used on some uses such as on some merchandising products of its subsidiaries like at the back of Infinity Train: Book One DVD by Cartoon Network which released on April 21, 2020.\n\n“The new logo signals this is not the same company it was as the old Time Warner. We wanted it to be forward looking without coming up with some logo that had symbols or fireworks shooting out of it.”\n\n— Edward Adler, Time Warner Senior Vice President, October 2003[3]\n\nWarnerMedia\n\n2018–2022\n\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to acquire Time Warner for $85 billion.[4] The United States Department of Justice attempted to block the acquisition. However, on June 12, 2018, District Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T, thus allowing the acquisition to proceed with no conditions or remedies. Two days later, AT&T announced it had closed the acquisition, renaming Time Warner as WarnerMedia after having de-merged and spun off its former Time Inc. properties back into a separate company that was later purchased by Meredith Corporation. Despite the next logo being introduced a year later, this logo continued to be used on-screen for New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures until 2021 and March 18, 2022 (a few weeks before WarnerMedia went defunct and became Warner Bros. Discovery), respectively.\n\n2019–2022\n\nDesigner: Wolff Olins\n\nTypography: AT&T Aleck Sans (modified)\n\nLaunched: October 17, 2019\n\nOn October 17, 2019, the previous logo was overhauled to change the font, removed the gray color used on the Media portion, removed the uppercase wordmark in favor of highlighting the name's appearance when typed, and bolded the Warner segment. This wordmark was designed by Wolff Olins.[5]\n\nOn May 16, 2021, it was reported that AT&T was in talks with Discovery, Inc. for it to merge with WarnerMedia, forming a publicly traded company that would be divided between its shareholders. The proposed spin-off and merger was officially announced the next day. The merger was completed on April 8, 2022. The company went defunct four days later on April 12, 2022, but despite this, the WarnerMedia name continues to used on press releases relating to the subsidiaries of its successor, Warner Bros. Discovery, and also NBA websites and some Warner Bros. Discovery subsidiaries.\n\nReferences\n\n◄ National Cleaning Contractors\n\nKinney Parking System\n\nWarner Communications\n\nTime Inc.\n\nTurner Broadcasting System\n\nAOL\n\nWarnerMedia\n\nWarner Music Group\n\nAOL\n\nTime Warner Cable\n\nTime Inc.\n\nWarner Bros.
