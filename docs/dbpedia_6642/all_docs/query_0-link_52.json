        "text": "Peter Warwick became President and CEO of Scholastic in August 2021, making him only the third CEO in Scholasticâs more than 100-year history. As CEO, Peter is responsible for Scholasticâs business strategy, and oversees all business segments and corporate functions. Prior to his appointment, Peter was an independent director on Scholasticâs Board from 2014â2021âa period in which the Company dramatically expanded its reach to global audiences and educators through the move into digital platforms and the creation of a number of new and innovative partnerships.Â While President & CEO, he continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Â\n\nÂ\n\nPeterâs focus is on carrying out the vision set forth by Dick Robinson to be the most beloved brand in childrenâs publishing, while continuing to strengthen the company culture and create value for shareholders through a constant focus on innovation.
