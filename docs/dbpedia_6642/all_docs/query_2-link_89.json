Sherrod Brown (D-OH), chairman of the committee, today called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require companies to report on how many workers they employ who are not classified as full-time employees, including independent and subcontracted workers.\n\n&ldquo;We believe that the disclosure of this data is critical to fully capture companies&rsquo; human capital management. We applaud the SEC for focusing on strengthening human capital disclosures as part of its regulatory agenda,&rdquo; wrote the senators in a letter to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. &ldquo;It is clear that investors need more information to understand how companies treat people, the most critical asset of any company. We agree that investors need disclosures that include quantifiable and comparable datasets that clearly articulate a company&rsquo;s human capital management, such as metrics on turnover, skills and development training, compensation, benefits, workforce demographic, and health and safety&hellip; That picture would be wholly incomplete, however, if companies are not required to disclose information about the number of independent contractors they use on a regular basis and the entire workforce that is material to their business strategy.&rdquo;\n\nExamples of subcontracted out workers considered part of the material workforce include security personnel, janitors, food service workers, housekeepers for hotels and lodging real estate investment trusts (REIT), and custodial workers.\n\n&ldquo;In recent decades, companies have replaced in-house operations with contracting, on-demand work, or other forms of independent and contracted work that lower short-term costs for the business but come at the expense of workers, who receive fewer benefits, lower wages, and have less upward mobility within the organization.
