        "text": "Synopsis\n\nWarner Bros Discovery reported a $9.1 billion non-cash goodwill charge due to uncertainties around cable and sports fees, resulting in a $10 billion net loss for Q2. The shift to streaming and TNT's failure to renew NBA rights contributed to declining TV revenues, despite a rise in streaming subscribers.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery said on Wednesday it wrote down the value of its TV assets due to the uncertainty of fees from cable and satellite distributors and sports rights renewals, sending its shares down nearly 10% in extended trading.\n\nThe film and entertainment studio, which owns sports network TNT and streaming service Max, recorded a $9.1 billion non-cash goodwill charge in the second quarter. This charge, stemming from a reassessment of the assets' value since the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, contributed to a $10 billion net loss for the quarter.\n\nThe media landscape has significantly changed in the past two years, impacting valuations and expectations for traditional media companies and this current situation is reflected in the write down, CEO David Zaslav said in a call with analysts.\n\nAsked whether the company was considering hiving off assets, CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said on the call: \"We've said before, you shouldn't be surprised to see us engaging in you know, whatever M&A processes are going on out there.\"\n\nThe shift of viewers from traditional television to streaming services has led to a decline in advertising revenue and affiliate fees, impacting the profitability of Warner Bros. Discovery's television assets. This decline is further compounded by the escalating costs of acquiring sports rights.\n\nTNT failed to renew a broadcast deal with National Basketball Association games, at a time when live sports have become crucial for companies to increase viewership. The company sued the NBA last month.\n\nLosing the lawsuit would accelerate the decline of its TV business, analysts said.\n\n\"The huge impairment charge from Warner Bros Discovery is essentially the final nail in the coffin of the traditional linear TV business,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research.\n\nContent revenue in Warner Bros Discovery's studio segment fell 6%, as the game \"Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League\", released earlier this year underperformed, compared to last year's top game \"Hogwarts Legacy\".\n\nDirector George Miller's much-awaited \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" underperformed at the box office following its release in May. The film raked in $67.5 million at the domestic box office, IMDb's Box Office Mojo data showed, while it had a reported a budget of $168 million, according to analysts at TD Cowen.\n\nThe studio's stock has shed a third of its value this year.\n\nNOT ENOUGH\n\nStill, the company's direct-to-consumer customer base grew thanks to its cheaper ad-supported offerings and expansion of the Max streaming service to new markets.\n\nGlobal direct-to-consumer customers at the end of the quarter was 103.3 million, up from 99.6 million subscribers in the January-March period, and beating analysts' estimates of 101.6 million, according to Visible Alpha data.\n\nRevenue from advertisements on its direct-to-consumer platforms nearly doubled to $240 million, trouncing Wall Street expectations, due to higher engagement on the Max streaming platform and strong subscriber growth, the company said.\n\nThe company's rival Walt Disney said on Wednesday that its Entertainment unit, including its streaming businesses Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, recorded its first profit in the April-June quarter.\n\n\"Strong streaming subscriber growth is not enough to make up for weakening fundamentals, the loss of NBA broadcast rights, advertising weakness, and misses across free cash flow, revenue, EBITDA, and earnings,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer of Running Point Capital.\n\nExcluding one time items such as the goodwill charge, the company's loss was 36 cents per share, wider than estimates of 22 cents per share, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe film raked in $67.5 million at the domestic box office, IMDb's Box Office Mojo data showed. It had a reported budget of $168 million, according to analysts at TD Cowen.\n\nThe media giant reported revenue of $9.71 billion in the second quarter on Wednesday, compared to analysts' estimate of $10.07 billion.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nFive reasons why India’s Economic Survey mentioned Apple five times\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
