        "text": "Supplementary notes\n\nFigures have been rounded.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, the Company completed the legal and structural separation of Time Inc. from the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recast its financial information to present the financial condition and results of operations of its former Time Inc. segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The 2013 and 2014 period calculations should take into account intersegment eliminations of 724 million and 961 million U.S. dollars, respectively.\n\nTime Warner reports a total consolidated revenue of 29.8 billion for 2013, which is less than the sums of the unique segments' revenues reported here. This is due to intersegment overlappings and shall just be noted here.\n\nTime Warner merged with AT&T on June 14, 2018, thereby changing its name from Time Warner Inc. to Warner Media. The 2019 AT&T Annual report did not include results from Time Warner operations prior to the acquisition."
