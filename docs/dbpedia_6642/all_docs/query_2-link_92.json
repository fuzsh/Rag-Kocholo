        "text": "Comcast is now a nationally recognized name, but before Comcast became an empire, it was a small cable station with 1200 subscribers in Tupelo, Mississippi. Ralph Roberts bought the small cable station 1963 during a poker game with some friends. Throughout the years, Comcast has been able to grow and expand with the new technological developments and consumer appetite. Comcast has branched out from cable and entered the high-speed internet provider market, the telephone communications service as well as the home security surveillance. The company has utilized strategies to increase their growth and reinforce their recognized brand name, by providing customers more for their money, corporate social responsibility and acquiring and merging\n\nFrom 1984 until 1996 AT&T was an integrated telecommunications services and equipment company, succeeding in a newly competitive environment. In 1995 On September 20, AT&T announces that it is restructuring into three separate companies: a services company, retaining the AT&T name; a products and systems company (later named Lucent Technologies) and a computer company (which reassumed the NCR name). Lucent is spun off in October 1996, and NCR in December, 1996. Three years later AT&T announces general availability of its local residential telephone service in New York with a bundled plan called \"AT&T Local One Rate New York.\" This is AT&T's first general reentry into the consumer local telephone business since the breakup of the Bell System. It occurs under the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The Telecommunications Act triggered dramatic changes in the competitive landscape. SBC Communications Inc. established itself as a global communications provider by acquiring Pacific Telesis Group (1997), Southern New England Telecommunications (1998) and Ameritech Corp. (1999). In 2005, SBC Communications Inc. acquired AT&T Corp., creating the new AT&T. With the merger of AT&T and BellSouth in 2006, and the consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless and YELLOWPAGES.COM, AT&T is positioned to lead our industry in one of its most significant transformations since the first\n\nThe cable provider would purchase 50 percent of Store Communications Inc., which increased the number of subscribers to over 2 million. At this point in time the company was recognized as one of the largest cable providers in the nation. The company would continue to add subscribers as they acquire Maclean Hunter’s U.S. cable operations, adding 550,000 customers and becoming the third largest cable operator in the United States with approximately 3.3 million customers in 1994. A year later they continued to add subscribers at an alarming rate when they announced the acquisition of E.W. Scripps cable systems, adding 800,000 subscribers and bringing Comcast’s customer total to 4.3 million. In another effort to add more subscribers in 2000 with the acquisition of Lenfest Communications, Inc., the company is able to add approximately 1.3 million cable subscribers. While adding subscribers is important to the business plan, Comcast was always looking for ways to appeal to their customers: specifically, the ones who enjoyed watching sports. So along with entrepreneur and owner\n\nIn 2001 Comcast would acquire AT&T Broadband the largest internet provider at the time for $44.5 billion. The merger would yield just the Comcast name. In 2002 Comcast would acquire all of AT&T Broadband’s assets and make them the largest cable television company in the United States. On April 30th 2006 Comcast would acquire Susquehanna Cable Company and all subsidiaries for $775 million. They would acquire 387,000 previous Susquehanna customers and transfer them to the basic, digital, and high speed cable that Comcast provided at the time. In April 2005 Comcast and Time Warner Cable would declare plans of purchasing the assets of bankrupt Adelphia Cable. Both companies would both pay $17.6 billion through cash and stocks. The deal was finalized\n\nTime Warner is also taking part in joint ventures which bring it more opportunities to advertise and sell its products. For example, in 1993 Time Warner and US West worked together to improve U.S. cable systems to an interactive fiber-optic data highway that could lead to such direct services to the home as music on demand and video on demand. This deal was based on U.S. West investing $2.5 billion in Time Warner Inc. which gave them a big stake (25.5%)in\n\nIn 1983 AOL began life in large part thanks to Bill Von Meister, and only had one product. In fact the company was first called Control Video Corporation. In 2015 as a company was sold to Verizon for 4.4 Billion. To say at the very least, AOL did something right as a corporation over the years. The first product they every came out with was called GameLine, which is a service that hooked your Atari 2600 to your phone line to rent games for 1 dollar (fastcompany). Not soon after it’s beginning, Control Video Corporation collapsed and over 90 % of its staffed were fired. However out of the ashes of Control Video Corporation, in 1985 Steve Case founded “Quantum\n\nOn October 22, 2016, AT&T bought out Time Warner for eighty-five billion dollars. The agreement totaled to be one-hundred and nine dollars with debt. Time Warner is the parent company to many big name channels including, CNN, TNT, HBO and Warner Bros. This major purchase proves that AT&T has a totally different strategy than its big-time rival, Verizon. CFO of Version, Fran Shammo, commented in response to AT&T’s deal, stating that he believes they have the right asset and that there is no large company out there that they need to purchase in order to be successful. Verizon recently made some smaller purchases but seemed but more insignificant with AT&T’s major buy. For nine million billion dollars, AT&T acquired AOL and Yahoo. They\n\nShare holders suffered even more, as stock prices plummeted from the time the merger was first announced. A major part of the failure of this merger was the fact that developing a “learning culture” was never considered, and no strategic vision was created for the newly merged organizations. For example Time Warner Cable’s high speed Internet services, Road Runner, as part of its profitable cable operations was never integrated with AOL as Case explained in his 2005 article in the Washington Post (6/ 11/05: B01). The first AOL Time Warner Annual Report (2000) claimed that it was fostering “… a nimble, entrepreneurial culture that recognizes that it can only succeed if everyone supports the new organization based on a shared set of values and common goals.” Unfortunately, the team-work necessary to integrate the two companies never happened, because there was no shared strategic vision of what the merger should be, and where it would be going. Merger Failure and the Need for a Culture of Learning According to some estimates, 85% of merger failures are related to the mismanagement of cultural issues. Awareness of cultural differences is then seen as an issue of primary concern when organizations merge. According to Miller (2000:8): “Once you develop an understanding of the current culture, and have compared that with the goals of the merged\n\nCablecom is one of the largest broadband cable operators in Zurich, Switzerland. It was founded by affiliation of many small companies in 1994. It operates in many cities of Switzerland and having 73% market share. It is part of UPC broadband which is owned by Liberty global.

The main services provided by Cablecom are Analogue and Digital cable TV and radio, telephone and internet."
