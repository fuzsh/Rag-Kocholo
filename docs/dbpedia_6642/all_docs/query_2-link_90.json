        "text": "History\n\nTime Warner was founded in 1985 as a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The company initially focused on producing magazines, books, and television programming. In the following years, it acquired several other media companies, including HBO, CNN, and Turner Broadcasting System. During the late 20th century, Time Warner became one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with interests in film production, music publishing, and cable television. However, the company faced challenges in the early 21st century due to changing consumer habits and competition from digital platforms. It spun off its publishing division in 2014 and sold its interest in Hulu in 2017. Today, Time Warner is primarily known for its ownership of Warner Bros., which produces films, television shows, and video games.\n\nBusiness model and operations\n\nTime Warner is a multinational media conglomerate that operates in three segments: Entertainment, News & Sports, and Direct-to-Consumer.\n\nThe Entertainment segment includes cable networks such as HBO, Cinemax, and Turner Classic Movies (TCM), as well as film production studios like Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. The News & Sports segment consists of news and sports channels such as CNN, TNT, and NBA TV, as well as international sports network ESPN. Finally, the Direct-to-Consumer segment offers streaming services such as HBO Max and DC Universe.\n\nIn terms of business model, Time Warner generates revenue through subscription fees for its cable networks, advertising sales for its television channels, and licensing fees from its film and television productions. It also earns profits from merchandise sales related to its properties.\n\nOperations-wise, Time Warner has a decentralized structure with most of its divisions based in different locations around the world. However, it does have some centralized functions such as legal and finance departments.

The deal was valued at $34 billion and resulted in AOL becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Warner.\n\nIn 2006, Time Warner acquired the remaining shares of AOL that it did not already own, effectively ending their joint venture partnership.\n\nIn 2018, Time Warner merged with AT&T to form WarnerMedia, a new media company focused on producing and distributing entertainment content across various platforms.\n\nKey executives and board members\n\nAs of 2021, some key executives and board members of Time Warner include:\n\n– Jeffrey L.
