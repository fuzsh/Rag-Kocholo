        "text": "NEW YORK Bringing many of the biggest properties and egos in media together under\n\none roof Thursday, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting System completed their $7.57 billion\n\nmerger.\n\nTime Warner Inc., regaining the title of the world’s largest media and entertainment company,\n\nnow adds such familiar names as Fred Flintstone, CNN and the Atlanta Braves not to mention\n\nTed Turner to an already formidable stable that includes Bugs Bunny, HBO, Time magazine\n\nand many others.\n\nIn separate meetings in New York, shareholders of the two companies voted overwhelmingly to\n\napprove the merger.\n\n“This is the company that I’ve always dreamed of and we are now here, complete, one team and\n\none family,” Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said.\n\n“This is a dream,” said Turner, the founder and chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting,\n\nwho now becomes vice chairman and the largest single shareholder of the merged company.\n\n“Considering the difficulties we had with this merger… it was quite a job to get it completed,”\n\nTurner said after announcing the vote. Later, as his long-time secretary Dee Woods read a final\n\nmotion to adjourn Turner Broadcasting’s final shareholder meeting, a tearful Turner dabbed his\n\neyes with a handkerchief.\n\nThe merger sent Time Warner stock up 25 cents a share to close at $41.37 on the New York\n\nStock Exchange. The deal was concluded after the close of trading.\n\nIt should take about a year to actually combine the numerous, and in some cases overlapping,\n\ndivisions of the two companies, analysts said.\n\n“One of the first things is going to be fairly significant layoffs from Turner,” said Larry\n\nGerbrandt, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a media research firm.\n\n“They’ve got to figure out the areas where they have duplicated overhead, and figure out who\n\ngets the responsibilities of the ones who will be leaving,” Gerbrandt said. “A lot of it is going to\n\nbe basic blocking and tackling. It’s just a painful transition.”\n\nTime Warner officials have not said how many people would be fired, though estimates have run\n\nas high as 1,200.\n\nDespite the contrasts in corporate culture and personality reflected in the reserved but ambitious\n\nLevin and the loose-lipped, risk-loving Turner, Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting already\n\nshare a high degree of understanding of each other’s business that should help smooth the union.\n\n“These are companies that have operated in the same sector, the same industry for almost their\n\nentire existence,” Gerbrandt said.\n\nThe company has a host of other matters to grapple with, including a restructuring of its cable\n\npartnership with U S West.\n\n, the telephone company that owns about one-quarter of the Time Warner Entertainment division\n\nand tried unsuccessfully to stop the merger.\n\nTime Warner also must put into effect plans, touted in private to Wall Street analysts, to make\n\nfurther cuts in the company’s costs and debt if it hopes to continue the recent ascent of its stock\n\nprice.\n\nAs Time Warner and Turner celebrated their merger, a side dispute over the company’s refusal to\n\ncarry News Corp.’s new Fox News channel over its cable television systems was simmering.\n\nOn Wednesday, just 18 hours before the Time Warner shareholders vote, News Corp., controlled\n\nby longtime Turner antagonist Rupert Murdoch, filed a $2 billion breach of contract suit against\n\nTime Warner.\n\nThe lawsuit names Turner Broadcasting and Ted Turner as well as Time Warner and its\n\nentertainment partnership, Time Warner Entertainment, but did not seek an immediate halt to the\n\nmerger.\n\nTurner, asked about the suit Thursday, called it “that frivolous piece of junk.”\n\nAs a condition for approving the merger, federal regulators required Time Warner to carry\n\nanother news channel, in addition to its own Cable News Network, on some of its cable systems.\n\nBut the company opted for MSNBC instead of Fox. Time Warner insists its decision is legal.\n\nComplicating the fight, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced the city would put the\n\nMurdoch 24-hour news channel on one of its public access cable stations. Time Warner’s earlier\n\ndecision not to carry Fox news left that operation with access to only a small portion of New\n\nYork, a critical market for advertising.\n\nIn a letter to Time Warner Wednesday, the Giuliani Administration asserted that Time Warner\n\ncouldn’t block its decision to let Fox and the Bloomberg Television news service use\n\npublic-access television, because that would amount to censorship.\n\nA Time Warner spokesman said the company would fight the city’s move.\n\n<a"
