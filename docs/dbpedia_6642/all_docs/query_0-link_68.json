In this report, overall statements use terms such as \"increased,\" \"decreased,\" or \"declined\" to describe a trend from the baseline year to 2019 that was statistically significant (at the .05 level) based on results of linear or quadratic trend tests. Pairwise t tests also were conducted to compare the estimates in 2019 with corresponding estimates in prior years.\n\nSubstance Use\n\nAmong people aged 12 or older in 2019, 60.1 percent (or 165.4 million people) used a substance (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, kratom, or an illicit drug) in the past month. In particular, 50.8 percent (or 139.7 million people) drank alcohol in the past month, 21.1 percent (or 58.1 million people) used a tobacco product in the past month, and 13.0 percent (or 35.8 million people) used an illicit drug in the past month. In addition, 0.3 percent (or 825,000 people) used kratom in the past month.\n\nTobacco Use\n\nAmong people aged 12 or older in 2019 who used any tobacco product in the past month, 65.3 percent smoked cigarettes but did not use other tobacco products, 13.8 percent smoked cigarettes and used some other type of tobacco product, and 21.0 percent used only noncigarette tobacco products (i.e., other tobacco products but not cigarettes). Thus, most of the past month tobacco users in the United States were cigarette users.\n\nAmong past month tobacco product users in 2019, the percentage who used only cigarettes increased with age (35.4 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17, 49.6 percent of young adults aged 18 to 25, and 68.5 percent of adults aged 26 or older), but the percentage who used only noncigarette tobacco products decreased with age (39.6 percent of adolescents, 27.9 percent of young adults, and 19.5 percent of adults aged 26 or older).\n\nAmong people aged 12 or older, the percentage who were past month cigarette users declined from 26.0 percent (or 61.1 million people) in 2002 to 16.7 percent (or 45.9 million people) in 2019.\n\nAmong past month cigarette smokers aged 12 or older, the percentage who smoked cigarettes daily declined from 63.4 percent in 2002 (or 38.7 million people) to 58.4 percent (or 26.8 million people) in 2019.\n\nAlcohol Use\n\nAmong the 139.7 million current alcohol users aged 12 or older in 2019, 65.8 million people (47.1 percent) were past month binge drinkers.

Perceived Great Risk from Substance Use among People Aged 12 or Older: 2015-2019\n\nD\n\n+ Difference between this estimate and the 2019 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level.\n\nAmong people aged 12 or older, the percentage who perceived great risk of harm from smoking marijuana once or twice a week declined from 36.3 percent in 2015 to 29.2 percent in 2019 (Figure 33 and 2019 DT 7.33).

In addition, the perceived great risk of harm declined slightly from 2016 to 2019 for daily binge drinking (from 65.5 to 63.5 percent) and weekly heroin use (from 83.4 to 82.1 percent).\n\nFigure 34.

However, the perceived great risk of harm from daily binge drinking remained stable between 2015 (62.1 percent) and 2019 (62.4 percent).\n\nFigure 35. Perceived Great Risk from Substance Use among Young Adults Aged 18 to 25: 2015-2019\n\nD\n\n+ Difference between this estimate and the 2019 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level.\n\nPerceived Risk from Substance Use among Adults Aged 26 or Older\n\nAmong adults aged 26 or older between 2015 and 2019, perceived great risk of harm from smoking marijuana weekly declined from 38.7 percent in 2015 to 30.8 percent in 2019 (Figure 36 and 2019 DT 7.37). Perceptions of great risk of harm among adults aged 26 or older declined slightly from 2015 to 2019 for daily binge drinking (from 70.4 to 69.3 percent), smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day (from 74.2 to 72.7 percent), and weekly cocaine use (from 88.8 to 86.9 percent). In addition, the perceived great risk of harm from weekly heroin use among this population declined slightly from 2017 (95.8 percent) to 2019 (95.2 percent).\n\nFigure 36. Perceived Great Risk from Substance Use among Adults Aged 26 or Older: 2015-2019\n\nD\n\n+ Difference between this estimate and the 2019 estimate is statistically significant at the .05 level.\n\nAge Comparisons for Perceived Risk from Substance Use\n\nIn 2019, perceptions of great risk of harm from substance use varied by substance and age. For example, adults aged 26 or older were more likely than adolescents aged 12 to 17 or young adults aged 18 to 25 to perceive great risk of harm from smoking one or more packs of cigarettes per day (Figures 34, 35, and 36 and 2019 DT 7.34, 7.36, and 7.37).\n\nMoreover, young adults aged 18 to 25 were less likely than adolescents aged 12 to 17 or adults aged 26 or older to perceive great risk of harm from smoking marijuana weekly (Figures 34, 35, and 36 and 2019 DT 7.34, 7.36, and 7.37). Recent research has identified associations among adults between decreases in perceptions of great risk of harm from smoking marijuana weekly and increases in marijuana use.42,43 Nevertheless, people can experience adverse effects from marijuana use, such as marijuana use disorder or injury resulting from operating a motor vehicle while impaired by marijuana.44,45 Therefore, it is necessary to educate young adults about adverse effects of marijuana use."
