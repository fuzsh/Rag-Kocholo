        "text": "Wed 7 September: Comedy Stand Up Sessions with Schalk Bezuidenhout, Liam Bento, Phil de Lange and Mel Jones.\n\nVenue: Café Roux, The Farm Village, Noordhoek.\n\nAddress: 270 Chapman`s Peak Drive.\n\nTickets: R120.00\n\nTime: Dinner from 19h00. Show from 20h30.\n\nBookings: go to www.caferouxsessions.co.za or book at www.webtickets.co.za\n\nContact for enquiries: info@caferoux.co.za / 021 789 2538\n\nProudly sponsored by: The Wolftrap Wine.\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout (HEADLINE ACT) was born in a very Afrikaans town right next to the airport in Joburg. In Kempton Park the traditional Afrikaans way of living was a good life. Your mother’s breast milk would be brannewyn en coke, you would walk kaalvoet to school, and you’d hide your lunch money when a black man walked past. His family and friends stood back as they watched Schalk evolve from an Afrikaans conservative caterpillar into a beautiful dramaqueen butterfly, complete with a moustache and furry afro. It was obvious to Schalk’s parents that he would study drama, and to help numb the pain they sent him away to study at the University of Cape Town.While studying in Cape Town Schalk slowly began to realise that there was so much more to life than boerewors and rugby, and started doing stand-up in April 2011.On stage Schalk is fun and energetic and appeals to people of all kinds and colours. Schalk has come a far way in the short amount of time that he has been doing comedy. He has had the privelage to perform at some great venues, alongside some even greater comedians.“Bezuidenhout is known for his quirky dress sense and the way he lets the audience in on what it’s like to be an Afrikaans-speaking young person… His unique material and delivery allow him to stand out in a sea of stand-up comedians” – Helen Herimbi.\n\nBorn and raised in Cape Town and a proud resident of Mitchell’s Plain, Mel Jones (HOST) describes herself as “the favourite” of three siblings. She is a single mother, an award nominated comedian, award nominated radio producer and an energetic MC. Her career started taking flight when she was fondly received at the Spier Amphitheatre only 6 short weeks after doing her very first open mic slot. Since then, you may have heard her on the radio as co-presenter of a very popular morning show, seen her on SABC3’s Comedy Showcase, the Phat Joe show, the King Size Comedy Tour, the Blacks Only Comedy Show, Mind The Gap, The Heavyweight Comedy Jam, Kings & Queens of Comedy, the critically acclaimed comedy & sketch show, Bitches, the Vodacom Funny Festival where she was their very first female host, Comedy Central and is hugely popular as a corporate comedian and MC. There’s also a strong possibility that you may have read about her in various magazines (not the ‘bikini’ mags – the edu-tainment ones. Ask her mom, she’s saved every copy). In fact, she was the guest editor for an edition of Khuluma magazine, Kulula.com’s in-flight magazine. She’s also been featured in a book called ‘Mitchell’s Plain – A Place in the Sun’ which led to an award winning production, which she starred in and was showcased at the Suidoosterfees at the Artscape in Cape Town for 2 years in a row. And, staying true to her roots has earned her a title as one of 12 ‘Mitchell’s Plain Heroes’. These people were selected as individuals who uplift the community and inspire young people who grow up in similar surroundings. You also get to see her face on a pillar, which is pretty cool.The shows, ‘Doing It for the Money’ and ‘Still Doing It’ in which she co-starred with another very popular Cape Town comedian, have been met with great reviews as a Cape Town hit. Mel takes laughter and hilarity very seriously and as one of only a handful of female comedians in the country, she is part of a very exclusive club.\n\nHe’s performed at Cape Town and Joburg’s hottest comedy venues. He’s been a popular act at Rocking The Daisies, Synergy Live, and the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown in both 2014 and 2015. Here he played the Cape Town Comedy Club late night comedy stage, Pants On Fire, Goliath & Goliath, Stand Up 4 Comedy, and also opened for Sne Dladla’s The Joke’s On You in 2014. He’s also opened for Gino Fernandez and Robby Collins at their Cape Town shows.Phil De Lange (SUPPORT ACT) is a comic originally from Bloemfontein and has been playing the Cape Town circuit since 2013. He broke into the comedy scene at the much loved Armchair Theatre in Cape Town, which has sparked the careers for a great deal of South African comedians. He carries a ukulele around and mixes it up with a blend of awkward, tongue in cheek, at times self-deprecating, musical, and stand-up comedy.\n\nPhil is also part of the Comedy On A Roll collective that runs comedy shows across Cape Town, including the very popular Armchair Wednesday open mic night."
