Views and opinions reflected in our newsletter are not necessarily those of Biltongmakers.Com and its team members.\n\nKeerbergen\n\nApril 2011It was still dark outside as I was driving along Vijfstraten on my way to the abattoir.Vijfstraten is a small one-lane road meandering through the leafy little village of Keerbergen where we live.It was still early in the morning and my red bull had not yet had the desired effect.\n\nI was not paying particular attention to anything. After all, I had been driving this same road for the past 9 years and apart from squirrels and an occasional cat there was nothing really to watch out for.But, driving along I felt something was not right, something had changed somewhere.I stopped, reversed, looked ….And there it was! A brand-new traffic sign that had not been there yesterday?I sat there looking at it and could not quite make out what it was that I had to heed or watch out for but then I looked closely at the picture on the sign and it dawned!Frogs! I had to watch out for frogs crossing the road!!Frogs?So, no sooner back home and onto old faithful and onto Wikipedia.\n\nNot much to read there really apart from the fact that it’s Frog Breeding season and at that time of year Frogs think more about sex than cars.Mmmm .. that makes a lot of sense.It’s more about having some fun really, I think. To be quite honest, if there were so many frogs crossing I should have seen at least one cropped body (or a live one) the past month or so.But no. Not even one!Ah well, this is Belgium and this is the country where we stop for ducks and squirrels and doves and chickens and so on and so on. It’s all very nice I think.You can sometimes sit in a queue on the road simply because some car, way up front, in front is waiting for a couple of Donalds and Minnies to get to the other side.\n\nAnd can they dawdle! (the ducks that is ;-)As you probably gathered, it’s spring in our part of the world (hence the frog warnings) and you can just feel and see the whole world coming back to life.\n\nThe trees and the bushes are full of blossoms.\n\nThe gardens are full of crocuses, hyacinths, tulips and bluebells and too many other spring flowers to even mention.\n\nEverywhere it is just one kaleidoscope of colours.\n\nEverything is kind of breathing a loooong sigh of relief\n\nWinter is over (again)!\n\nIt’s good to have some warmth back in our bodies after yet another lengthy winter.\n\nLucky for us we had a whole month break in December when we went to South Africa …..\n\nDecember was the first time we went back in 9 years.\n\nThe first week we were in Jo’burg meeting up with old friends and I spent some time meeting with some our suppliers and customers.\n\nIt was great to meet so many of the people I have been dealing with for such a long time and never really met.\n\nFernando, Malcolm, Liekie, Sandra and Charlie at Crown National, Shane at JJ Airfreight, Anna at Apak, Joe and Roland at Heneways and Avi and his staff at the factory.\n\nBeing in Jo’burg it was like we had never left.\n\nI brought Susie (my GPS) along but did not really need her.\n\nOf course there were changes in the road systems and a lot of new buildings had gone up but for the rest?\n\nEverything was just the same!\n\nEspecially the braais!\n\nMy goodness no-one in this whole world can put together a braai like a South African!\n\nAnd it simply did not stop for the whole month!\n\nWe soon winged our way down to Cape Town and, via the Klipdrift distillery at Robertson (of course), drove down to Knysna to spend the rest of our holidays there with our eldest son Derek and his family at their magnificent place right on top of the “Heads” on the Pezula Golf estate.\n\nOn the right is a picture taken from the 14th hole. Click to see it big. Isn’t South Africa’s coast just incredible!\n\nIn fact the whole family was together. Even Tony, my son who lives in Holland, came over with his whole family. An incredible effort and surprise!\n\nGwendy my daughter, now living in Cape Town, drove down in her magnificent 1960’s restored VW Beetle! (What next will she get up to?)\n\nIt was great to have everyone together for the first time in many years.\n\nI am not going to bore you with my thoughts about the country. Whether it has changed or not changed or waffle on about the security situation etc. etc.\n\nI have my thoughts and will keep them to myself for while. But, it is still one of the most beautiful countries in the world and it is blooming cheap to live there!\n\nI could not believe the prices in the restaurants and supermarkets. Even the house rents and prices.\n\nBut, especially the restaurants! And we went to many.\n\nWhere in this world can you get a full-on breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes and chips etc. for just €4.00?\n\nOr a full-on seafood platter with 12 prawns, chips and all the sauces for just € 8.00?\n\nAnd that was not just at Derek’s restaurant but all over!\n\nCome on!! Fish and chips (and a HUGE piece of Kingklip) for € 1.50! (No, this is not a typo!)\n\nIf you’re ever in Knysna please visit the Swing Café, Derek’s restaurant/nightclub. Good vibes, good food and good music!\n\nWell, it has been a long time!\n\nA lot of water has gone under the bridge and life has changed for many of us.\n\nHopefully for the better.\n\nWhy the long absence?\n\nWell, I am not going to make any excuses. Priorities changed and something had to give.\n\nIn this case our newsletter.\n\nI must be quite honest in saying that I missed putting it together every month; it was always such a lot of fun.\n\nAnd then of course the feedback we received, the contacts we had with South Africans all over the world and the interaction we saw between expats everywhere. We were really global!\n\nSomehow I feel that Biltong is a kind of universal “language/link (whatever you want to call it)” that binds most South Africans together.\n\nThey may be anywhere in the world and not even knowing each other, but …. just mention “Biltong” and all walls seems to disappear and people are instant friends.\n\nThis is the one reason I have done this newsletter.\n\nThe other reason is that I just had to listen to the many, many people who are still writing to us asking for a new newsletter. We even get calls at all odd hours (perhaps they’re forgetting the time zones ;-))\n\nPeople send us their email addresses just wanting to make sure that we have the correct one because they are worried that they had not received a newsletter for a while.\n\nWhen in South Africa in December so many people asked; “When is there going to be another one?”\n\nWell, here it is.\n\nI hope that you get as much fun out of it as you did all those years ago and as I have had doing it.\n\nIt took a while because I did not realize how “rusty” I had become!\n\nI would love to do another one after this. It’s been so much fun. But, I would need some help and input.\n\nThat is, after all, what this is all about. The interaction between the so many South Africans who live away from their home land.\n\nSo, if you have enjoyed this one why not put pen to paper or fingers to the keyboard and let’s hear from you!\n\nHopefully till a next time!\n\nTake care,\n\nMmmmm ….\n\nA woman is sitting at home on the patio with her husband drinking a glass of wine and she says: “I love you”.\n\nHe asks: “Is that you or the wine talking?”\n\nShe replies: “It’s me …….. talking to my wine”.\n\nPoints to ponder …\n\ntop\n\nRemember……………..?\n\n(We’ve all seen it before but it is still nice to remember …-Ed)\n\nRemember…….\n\nBefore the Internet or the AppleMac… Before semi-automatics and crack cocaine… Before SEGA or Cartoon Network… Before Playstation and MTV…\n\nWay, way back……….\n\nI’m talking about the time of Hide and Seek in the park…..or the dark.\n\nThe cafe down the road?\n\nHopscotch, Donkey, skipping and hand stands, backyard cricket with a tomato box, Dandy & Beano annuals\n\nFrench skipping, charms and “arlies”, jumping the river, living on the beach, building a swing from a piece of rope tied to a tree, tennis on the street or swing ball in the backyard.\n\nThe smell of suntan lotion, hot tar and Oros.\n\nWicks bubble gum for a cent.\n\nAn ice cream cone from the kombi that plays a tune. Wait, can you still remember…\n\nWhen around the corner seemed far away and going into town seemed like going somewhere, and your Ma made you “dress up” for the trip.\n\nA million mozzie bites and peeling skin in summer.\n\nSticky fingers and sand in and on everything.\n\nCops and Robbers, Rounders, Stingers, Foefie slides and climbing trees.\n\nWalking or riding your bike to school – no matter what the weather.\n\nRunning till you were out of breath.\n\nLaughing so hard that your stomach hurt\n\nJumping on the bed….. Pillow fights. Spinning around, getting dizzy and falling down. Being tired from playing….. Remember that?\n\nThe worst embarrassment was being picked last for a team.\n\nPaper water bombs and clay “lats” were the ultimate weapon.\n\nA piece of card in the spokes held by a clothes peg transformed any bicycle into a motorcycle.\n\nI’m not finished just yet!\n\nCan you still taste and smell……….\n\nEating jelly powder from the box, ice lollies made from cold drink in Tupperware holders in the freezer.\n\nMaking sherbet from sugar and ENOS and boiling tins of condensed milk to make caramel – took hours!\n\nMarshmallow fish and mice.\n\nRemember when…………\n\nThere were two types of takkies – Tommies and the canvas ones, and the only time you wore them at school was for “PT”.\n\nIt wasn’t odd to have two or three “best” friends.\n\nNobody owned a pedigree dog.\n\n25 cents was decent pocket money.\n\nWhen you’d reach into a muddy gutter for 5 cents and feel lucky.\n\nWhen nearly everyone’s Mom was at home when the kids got there.\n\nRemember when it was magic when dad would “remove” his thumb, or make 10 cents appear from behind your ear.\n\nWhen it was considered a great privilege and very unusual to be taken out to dinner at a real restaurant or in a proper hotel.\n\nWhen on a rare occasion Dad stopped at a roadhouse or “Dairy Den”.\n\nRemember when any parent could discipline any kid, or feed him or use him to carry groceries and nobody, not even the kid, thought a thing of it.\n\nWhen being sent to the headmaster’s office was nothing compared to the fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home. Basically, we were in fear for our lives but it wasn’t because of muggings, drugs, gangs, etc. Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat…… and some of us are still afraid of them!!!\n\nRemember when…………\n\nDecisions were made by going “eeny-meeny-miney-mo”.\n\nMistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming, “Nix!”\n\nA “race issue” meant arguing about who ran the fastest.\n\nMoney was handled by whoever was the banker in “Monopoly”.\n\nThe worst thing you could catch from the opposite sex was germs.\n\nHaving a weapon in school meant being caught with a BIC pen, pea shooter or a “cattie”.\n\nTaking drugs meant orange-flavoured chewable vitamin C or Milk of Magnesia.\n\nIce cream was considered a basic food group.\n\nSkills and courage were discovered because of a “dare”.\n\nOlder Siblings were the worst tormentors, but also the fiercest protectors.\n\nDidn’t that feel good…..just to go back and say, Yeah, I remember that!!!\n\nIf you can remember most or all of these, then you have LIVED!!!!\n\nPass this on to anyone who grew up in South Africa who may need a break from their “grown up” life!\n\nTake care,\n\nStory of the month\n\ntop\n\nThe Daffodil Principle\n\n~~ Jaroldeen Asplund Edwards ~~\n\nSeveral times my daughter had telephoned to say, “Mother, you must come see the daffodils before they are over.” I wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Laguna to Lake Arrowhead. “I will come next Tuesday, “I promised, a little reluctantly, on her third call.\n\nNext Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked into Carolyn’s house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, “Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! The road is invisible in the clouds and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and these children that I want to see bad enough to drive another inch!”\n\nMy daughter smiled calmly and said, “We drive in this all the time, Mother.”Well, you won’t get me back on the road until it clears, and then I’m heading for home!” I assured her.\n\n“I was hoping you’d take me over to the garage to pick up my car.” “How far will we have to drive?” “Just a few blocks,” Carolyn said. “I’ll drive. I’m used to this.”\n\nAfter several minutes, I had to ask, “Where are we going? This isn’t the way to the garage!” “We’re going to my garage the long way,” Carolyn smiled, “by way of the daffodils.”\n\n“Carolyn,” I said sternly, “please turn around.” “It’s all right, Mother, I promise. You will never forgive yourself if you miss this experience.”\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small gravel road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand-lettered sign that read, “Daffodil Garden.” We got out of the car and each took a child’s hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path. Then, we turned a corner of the path, and I looked up and gasped. Before me lay the most glorious sight.\n\nIt looked as though someone had taken a great vat of gold and poured it down over the mountain peak and slopes. The flowers were planted in majestic, swirling patterns — great ribbons and swaths of deep orange, white, lemon yellow, salmon pink, saffron, and butter yellow. Each different colored variety was planted as a group so that it swirled and flowed like its own river with its own unique hue.\n\nThere were five acres of flowers. “But who has done this?” I asked Carolyn. “It’s just one woman,” Carolyn answered. “She lives on the property. That’s her home.” Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house that looked small and modest in the midst of all that glory.\n\nWe walked up to the house. On the patio, we saw a poster:\n\n“Answers to the Questions I Know You Are Asking”\n\n50,000 bulbs.\n\nOne at a time, by one woman.\n\nTwo hands, two feet, and very little brain.\n\nBegan in 1958.\n\nThere it was….”The Daffodil Principle.” For me, that moment was a life-changing experience.\n\nI thought of this woman whom I had never met, who, more than forty years before, had begun — one bulb at a time — to bring her vision of beauty and joy to an obscure mountain top. Still, just planting one bulb at a time, year after year, had changed the world. This unknown woman had forever changed the world in which she lived. She had created something of ineffable (indescribable) magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.\n\nThe principle her daffodil garden taught is one of the greatest principles of celebration. That is, learning to move toward our goals and desires one step at a time — often just one baby-step at a time –and learning to love the doing, learning to use the accumulation of time.\n\nWhen we multiply tiny pieces of time with small increments of daily effort, we too will find we can accomplish magnificent things. We can change the world!\n\n“It makes me sad in a way,” I admitted to Carolyn. “What might I have accomplished if I had thought of a wonderful goal thirty-five or forty years ago and had worked away at it ‘one bulb at a time’ through all those years. Just think what I might have been able to achieve!\n\n“My daughter summed up the message of the day in her usual direct way. “Start tomorrow,” she said. It’s so pointless to think of the lost hours of yesterdays. The way to make learning a lesson of celebration instead of a cause for regret is to only ask….\n\n“How can I put this to use today?”\n\nWe convince ourselves that life will be better after we get married, have a baby, then another. Then we are frustrated that the kids aren’t old enough and we’ll be more content when they are. After that, we’re frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, when we are able to go on a nice vacation, or when we retire. The truth is there’s no better time to be happy than right now. If not now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges. It’s best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with… and remember that time waits for no one.\n\nThere is no better time than right now to be happy. Happiness is a journey, not a destination.\n\nSo work like you don’t need money, love like you’ve never been hurt, and dance like no one’s watching.\n\n* * * * Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement * * * *\n\nThe South African Meat Industry Company,\n\nSamic has very nice meat cutting charts.\n\nJust click on the banner below for lots of interesting information.\n\nI must compliment whoever does the SAMIC newsletter for their lovely sayings! Have look, they are amazing!\n\nOur Home Biltong Makers\n\ntop\n\nThe Brand-New Biltong Buddy!!\n\nThis month sees the launch of our brand-new Biltong Buddy MK-VI!\n\nWe have put a lot of work in this and are very happy with the result.\n\nThe new Mark-VI Biltong Buddy Home Biltong maker operates with a heating element to aid the drying process of the meat.\n\nIt holds a maximum of 2kg of wet meat and is an ideal addition to your kitchen appliances for making your own “stukkie” biltong.\n\nWe have often wondered about the length and trouble they go through on those biltong making videos your get.\n\nMaking biltong the South African way (the way most butchers do it) is as easy as 1-2-3 …!!\n\nCut the meat in slabs resembling pieces of biltong, spice it, let stand overnight, hang and voila!! Superb biltong!\n\nWith the Rugby WorldCup on the horizon you’ll be the envy of your friends!\n\nDo a deal with them … you supply the “stukkies” Biltong and they bring the beer!!!\n\nSome of the advantages and features of the New Mark-VI Biltong Buddy:\n\nNo more searching for globes which are getting more an more difficult to get)\n\nFull 110 and 220 volt versions. The 110 volt guys don’t have to run around looking for the right globe any longer!\n\nAn absolute even drying of the meat within a matter of 2-4 days (depending how dry or wet you like your billies).\n\nSimple and easy design which means that very little can go wrong.\n\nSpare elements are available from our on-line store.\n\nA window in the front of the box so you can see what is happening without having to “peek” all the time. This means that you don’t have to lift the lid and slow down the drying process.\n\nThe switch on the front panel of the box lights up to show that the unit is working.\n\nHave a look at the pictures here and tell us what you don’t like about it! We think it’s magic!\n\nThe new Biltong Buddy Mark-VI is now available from our on-line store at www.biltongmakers.com\n\nAn interesting fact!\n\nDid you know that there are customers all over the world who are still using the old Mk-II Biltong Buddy!\n\nThis is just one of many, many mails we receive every day from all over the world.\n\nMy little biltong maker has kept me sane and smiling ……\n\nFor years, my little biltong maker has kept me sane and smiling. Even my husband wonders how such a small thing can produce so much happiness. It works like a charm, is really easy to use, and makes the best biltong ever.\n\nI first bought my baby Biltong Maker in late 2002 after six months of living in Amsterdam with no biltong. The cravings were just too much and I decided to make it a Christmas gift to myself. I actually found a supplier of biltong in The Netherlands where I could order online, but the complicated Dutch payment system was too much for a poor girl from Mafikeng.\n\nSo the hunt was on. Thanks to the Internet, I discovered The Biltong Maker.\n\nIt arrived a few weeks after Christmas, thanks to a short stop with Dutch customs. Luckily I had a wonderful butcher nearby who helped select and slice the meat, even though he shook his head in doubt when I described what I was doing. But he was very expensive, so I learned to buy the right cuts of meat in wholesale stores and markets.\n\nNow I could make the best biltong, and cheaply too!\n\nThe guidance and recipes on the Biltong Maker site are amazing – you’re up and running in no time at all.\n\nErica Harper\n\nVienna, VA 22181\n\nUSA\n\nRockey’s New Turbo Machine\n\nAnd yes, Rockey’s new 5kg Turbo Home Biltong maker has been an incredible success. So much so that we cannot possibly keep up with the orders that come in at the moment. The order processing time is therefore around 7 working days at the moment.\n\nOne incredible thing about the Turbo Model is that you don’t have to use the light. We found this out by accident when a customer called and said that it works perfectly without the heat from the globe.\n\nThis proves once again that it is not so much the heat but airflow that is the main factor in drying meat.\n\nRockey’s New Age Home Biltong Maker\n\nThe RNA-5 (as we call it) is exactly the same as its brother the “Turbo” model except that it does not have a fan. It is perfect to dry up to 5kg of wet meat and makes incredible biltong but in larger quantities than the Buddy.\n\nSpecial new features:\n\nAll our Home Biltong Makers are now fitted standard with a CE approved appliance power cable complete with a standard EU two-pin plug.\n\nGrommets have been added to the cable entry point on the box.\n\nA highly improved and stronger PST is now used for all boxes.\n\nAnd so, once again, we have improved on previous models and have made it easier and quicker than ever before for you to make your Biltong.\n\nYou too could be making your own Biltong in a very short space of time.\n\nHave a look at our Home Biltong Makers and see how easy it is!!\n\nDetails on ROCKEY’S 5kg Home Biltong Maker as well as the new Turbo Model can be found by clicking on this link.\n\nOur 16th Birthday Specials!!\n\ntop\n\nIt’s our Birthday … again!\n\nThis month it is 16 years ago that we made our very first Home Biltong Maker.\n\nAs most of you will know by now we did not really invent the original 2kg Biltong Maker.\n\nKel had an old Cardboard Biltong Maker box and worked a new idea around that one.\n\nNow, sixteen years later, thousands of people all over the world are making their own Biltong!\n\nWe could tell you some stories about some other products that we have shipped across the world but we will leave that for another newsletter!\n\nSo, it’s April and it’s our birthday and we thought we had to do something special for our customers.\n\nSince no-one will send us a present (he-he) we will give you something to celebrate about.\n\nHere we go:\n\nFrom date of publication of this newsletter till the end of May this is what will happen!\n\nFree to the first 50 customers only!!\n\n(With an order for one of our three Home Biltong Makers)\n\nA choice of …..\n\nA Wooden Biltong Cutter.\n\n1/2 kg of Safari Biltong Spice.\n\n1/2 kg of the following spices ….\n\nCountry Boerewors Spice\n\nOuma’s Boerewors Spice\n\nBurgher Boerwors Spice\n\nSpecial discounts for Special customers!!\n\nThe Brand-New Mk-VI Biltong Buddy 2kg Home Biltong Maker for only R 799.00\n\n(Instead of the normal R 950.00)\n\nRockey’s New Age Home Biltong Maker for only R 895.00\n\n(instead of the normal R 1150.00)\n\nRockey’s New Age TURBO Home Biltong Maker for only R 1095.00\n\n(instead of the normal R 1295.00)\n\nOur SI-30 Industrial Biltong Drying Cabinet (30kg wet meat) for only R 9995.00\n\n(Instead of the normal R 11995.00)\n\nOur Wooden Hand Biltong Cutter for only R 325.00\n\n(Instead of the normal R 425.00)\n\nOur Semi Industrial Hand Biltong Cutter/Shredder for only R 995.00\n\n(Instead of the normal R 1495.00)\n\nOur famous Safari pre-mixed Biltong Spice for only R 69.00 per 500 gram\n\n(Instead of the normal R 75.00)\n\nAll Nice ‘n Spicy spice packets, complete with recipe, for only R 35.00 (including free airmail to anywhere in the world!)\n\n(Instead of the normal R 45.00)\n\nFree with all Biltong Maker orders placed (from this newsletter publication date till the end of May)\n\n20 special Biltong storage bags\n\nA packet of our famous Nice ‘n Spicy spices complete with recipe.\n\nTips of the month\n\ntop\n\nGet rid of mosquitoes …!\n\nMosquito Spray? … Worth a try!!\n\nI was at a garden party a while back, and the bugs were having a ball biting everyone.\n\nA man at the party sprayed the lawn and patio floor with Listerine, and the little blighters disappeared. The next year I filled a 1/2 liter spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever I saw mosquitoes.\n\nAnd voila! That worked like a dream.\n\nIt worked at a picnic where we sprayed the area around the food table, the children’s swing area, and the standing water nearby. During the summer, I don’t leave home without it. Pass it on.\n\nOne of our friend’s comments:\n\nI tried this on my patio and around all of my doors. It works – in fact, it killed them instantly.\n\nIt will last a couple of days. Don’t spray directly on a wood door (like your front door), but spray around the frame. Spray around the window frames, and even inside the dog house.\n\nJohan says:\n\n“Die goedkoper weergawe is Plax.\n\nHelfte goedkoper as Listerine en werk net so goed.\n\nGebruik dit al lank, want boer mos met hase en jy kan geen gif buite gebruik met hulle in die tuin nie.\n\nEnige iets is beter as die ander goed wat so sleg ruik. Plax of Listerine ruik en smaak beter!!”\n\nSome more useful tips …\n\n(do you have any, please let us know?)\n\nAn idea for Potjiekos lovers\n\nThis comes from Barry in South Africa. Give it a try and let us know what you think about his idea ..\n\nHi Guys,\n\nHere is something that your readers may find interesting.\n\nI’m a great Potjiekos maker, and I go for ‘beesstert’ (oxtail) Potjie most of the time.\n\nI had gotten myself a pipe and stand which stands at the bottom of the pot with your food around the pipe, and works similar to the old coffee peculator. But you must make sure that all the onion bits are all removed before you place the stand at the bottom and before you place your ‘sealed’ meat around the pipe.\n\nThe onion bits quickly clog up the pipe if they are left in there. The onions go in much later after you have placed your potatoes and carrots in. During this time, I also pour almost a liter Coke into the pot (size 3 pot) and this really tenderizes the ox tail and gives it a some what sweeter taste to it.\n\nThe idea of the peculator pipe is to get your gravy and spices in the bottom of the pot to the top and over your veggies.\n\nMy mouth is actually watering just talking about it.)\n\nContact me if you wish for more info.\n\nBarry\n\nbarry@tcspta.com\n\nGood vision in a Downpoor!\n\nWe are not sure why it is so effective but just try this method when it rains heavily.\n\nThis method was told to us by a police friend who had experienced and confirmed it.\n\nIt is very useful…even driving at night.\n\nDuring a heavy downpour most motorists turn on the HIGH or FASTEST SPEED of the windshield wipers. Yet the visibility in front of the windshield is still bad……\n\nIn the event you face such a situation, just put on your SUN GLASSES (any model will do), and miracles! All of a sudden, your visibility in front of your windshield is perfectly clear, as if there is no rain.\n\nMake sure you always have a pair of SUN GLASSES in your car. You are not only helping yourself to drive safely with good vision, but also might save your friend’s life by giving him this idea. Try it yourself and share it with your friends!!!!\n\nAmazingly, you still see the drops on the windshield, but not the sheet of rain falling. You can see where the rain bounces off the road. It works to eliminate the “blindness” from passing cars. Or the “kickup” if you are following a car in the rain.\n\nThey ought to teach this little tip in driver’s training. It really does work. This is a good warning.\n\nI wonder how many people know about this???\n\nBoererate\n\nSuurlemoen en koeksoda werk beter as Handy-Andy.\n\nAsyn en koeksoda maak vir ‘n baie goeie disinfectant.\n\nAsyn en warm water kan ontslae raak van ‘n mierplaag!\n\nCitrus Soda en suurlemoen maak ‘n aangebrande pot sommer vinnig skoon!\n\nOur spices are Kosher and Halaal!\n\nIt will certainly interest our Jewish readers that our biltong spices are certified as being kosher by the Beth Din of Johannesburg.

The answers are simple and will solve most problems instantly!\n\nQUESTIONS ON SAUSAGE CASINGS\n\nWhere can I get casings for the boerewors I want to make?\n\nWhich casing should I use for a particular sausage such as for normal boerewors or droewors?\n\nCan you please supply me with casings for my boerewors? You can’t get them here in our country.\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nSausages are made in one form or another in almost every country in the world. It’s the way butchers use the bits and pieces that fall of the meat when trimming (off-cuts).\n\nIf your butcher or supermarket has sausages, the casings for these are available. The easiest way to find out where to get them is to ask your butcher!\n\nIn most cases he will even sell you some if he makes sausages himself.\n\nAs to what size to use? You know how thick boerewors and droëwors is. Just ask the butcher for the size you see in his display cabinet or get the phone number of the people who he buys them from.\n\nWe do not ship sausage casings. Not because they would not survive the trip. They certainly will. But simply because they are available right there where you are!\n\nPLEASE GIVE ME A PRICE FOR A BILTONGMAKER AND THE SHIPPING\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nInstead of emailing us for a price just use the ‘PRICING AND SHIPPING’ link on our home page www.biltongmakers.com. It is much quicker and easier and you’ll even find a currency converter to see what it will cost you in your own money.\n\nYou will find this link on the left-hand side of our home page.\n\nFollow the easy instructions you find there and you’ll find out the exact pricing for everything.\n\nQUESTION\n\nGas bottle adapter?\n\nI am trying to find an adapter for my wife’s Skottel Braai that we got when we went to SA to visit family.\n\nI didn’t realize how difficult it would be to find an adapter to fit an American Gas Bottle!\n\nDo you have one or know how I could obtain one?\n\nJason Stoner\n\nUSA\n\nstoner_gumby@yahoo.com\n\nQUESTION\n\nMy biltong is hard on the outside and still pink on the inside\n\nI recently purchased some biltong in SA from a butcher and the outside was dark, soft and shiny and it was really nice, although there was no fat on the meat the paper it was wrapped in was a bit oily.\n\nWhen I got home I tried making my own but the outside is always rock hard with the inside very soft, it tastes nice but it is just the texture that I cannot get right.\n\nYour help would be appreciated\n\nThanks\n\nEdgar Gregan\n\nLimassol, Cyprus\n\nedgar_gregan@yahoo.co.uk\n\nQUESTION\n\nKalahari Boerewors Recipe\n\nDoes anyone have a receipe for Kalahari Boerewors please?\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nJan Adrian Venter\n\nNew Zealand\n\njanventer@xtra.co.nz\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat is the Dragon herb?\n\nThis one comes up regularly so here it is again. This time from Lee-Anne Marais from Cape Town.\n\nIn one of your recipes you say we must use “Dried Dragon” I have looked it up on the net and have learnt something new. I have never heard of it before and neither have a lot of our suppliers of food products!\n\nANSWER\n\nThe herb called DRAGON is Tarragon and available from all good food stores and super markets.\n\nYou can get it as a small plant (like parsley, mint etc) or in a dried form in a small bottle.\n\nHere is an extract from what we found on the web.\n\n“Tarragon was used by the ancient Greeks as a remedy for toothache.\n\nToday we know that tarragon contains an anesthetic chemical, eugenol, which is the major constituent of anesthetic clove oil, making its use for temporary pain relief understandable.\n\nDuring medieval times there was a belief, called the Doctrine of Signatures, which stated that a herb’s appearance revealed its medicinal value. According to this philosophy, tarragon was thought to cure snake bites, due to the serpentine shape of its roots.\n\nEven tarragon’s species name, dracunculus, comes from the Latin for dragon, again referring to the shape of its root, and adding to the myth of curing bites from venomous beasts and mad dogs.”\n\nhttps://www.foodreference.com/html/a603-tarragon-dragon.html\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do I cook boerewors?\n\nI live in Israel and just purchased 2 kg boerewors from a South African gentleman who was a butcher there.\n\nI have read your article about how to cook them. As an inexperienced boerewors cooker I have a question.\n\nDo you leave the entire link whole and grill it till done and then and only then slice up the sausage into portions? Or is it possible to cut up rather long sections to make grilling easier?\n\nI hope that this does not seem like an absurd question to an experienced person like yourself.\n\n(No question is absurd David and I bet that many people have asked themselves the same questions or simply end up with something they don’t like. -ED)\n\nThank you,\n\nDavid Fishbein\n\nIsrael\n\nnukepa@gmail.com\n\nOUR COMMENT TO THIS QUESTION\n\nDear David,\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nNo questions is absurd. It actually makes good sense.\n\nThe traditional way is to grill the rolls and then cut it into pieces after it has been cooked.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the meat then cooks in its natural juices and the fat that is in the sausage. That way it will retain the juiciness and softness it is supposed to.\n\nIf you cut it up beforehand the juices will just run out and the fat will set the fire alight!\n\nIt’s always handy to have a jug of water next to the fire to sprinkle on the flames when these flare up.\n\nAlternatively you can shape the longer pieces into smaller sausages (just turn them into smaller sausages). That way the juices will also remain. Watch out!! Don’t ever prick the sausage with a fork or damage the casing because, once again, the juices will disappear and your sausage will certainly be not as nice as it could be.\n\nTHE BILTONG TEAM\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nIn reply to the many questions we get regarding a sausage maker the following feedback.\n\nKenwood (as in Kenwood mixer) produces a sausage attachment for their Kenwood Chef kitchen appliance. I believe they also make a mincer on its own with sausage spout.\n\nWhen I got to New Zealand I bought a Kenwood Chef so it gets used for all the normal things and I get the benefit of using it to make sausages and they are awesome.\n\nCheers\n\nPaul and Glenda Bing\n\nOhakune, New Zealand\n\nStoeptalk\n\ntop\n\nTaxiing to a dead stop!\n\nBy James ClarkeTOGETHERNESS Amadeus Tshabalala jinks his Toyota mini-bus taxi (with BMW hubcaps) through the rush-hour traffic.He is a confident man of high spirits, as evidenced by the stickers on his rear window: “God loves Taxi Drivers” and “Defeat Constipation – Travel by Taxi”.On the front of his taxi, above a dent which, ominously, is in the shape of a large traffic cop with his arms akimbo, is a placard reading: Northern Suburbs Express – Inaugural Flight.Using the word “flight” is Togetherness’ little joke. He could well have used the word “fright” for such is his sense of humour.We are witnessing (dear reader) the inaugural journey of a township taxi which hopes to establish a daily service between the quiet, leafy, mainly white northern suburb of Jukskei Park and Johannesburg city centre. It is a 25km journey that takes Togetherness 8.5 minutes if it’s not too busy and assuming he can occasionally drive on the pavements to avoid queuing in traffic.The percussion waves from Togetherness’ powerful radio cause the vehicle’s sides to rhythmically flex. He hoots as he drives. Togetherness hoots at anything he sees – including trees and pretty girls – as is the custom of township taxi drivers.Aboard the taxi are a dozen white people. They do not come whiter. Their whiteness is not due to fear; it is due to stark terror. Take John Hilton. Never in his life has he experienced zero to 100 km/h in six seconds – not in heavy traffic.Denise Smith’s colour had changed to green-white as quickly as the last traffic light changed to red – a colour which, as is traditional among taxi drivers, Togetherness ignores. He looks over his shoulder – for a full minute – asking passengers their destinations. Elsbeth Brown, sitting right at the back, says. “Randburg centre!” She really wants to go all the way to Johannesburg centre but, suddenly, Randburg seems preferable.She worries about how she will make her way from the backseat, but only fleetingly because the taxi has now reached Randburg and has stopped as suddenly as a plane might stop up against a mountain.Now everybody is in front in a warm, intimate heap.Elsbeth alights as gracefully as anybody can with one knee locked behind the other. She is vaguely aware of passers-by loosening her clothing and shouting: “Give her air!”Togetherness bowls happily along Jan Smuts Avenue overtaking a police car that is chasing a getaway car. Then he overtakes the getaway car, exchanging boisterous greetings with the driver whom he appears to know. Togetherness is steering with his elbows because he needs his hands free to check the morning’s takings and to wave to girls.He announces: “Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We will shortly be landing in Johannesburg. Please make sure your seatbelts are fastened and your seats are in the upright position. Thank you.”Piet Smit is chewing on a seatbelt that is made of leather. Togetherness had them specially made because he felt first-time passengers would need to bite on something.Togetherness now merges with the mainstream of in-bound traffic. He merges with it in much the same way his Zulu ancestors merged with the British at the battle of Isandlwana.He stops at his usual disembarkation point in the middle of a busy intersection and picks his teeth, patiently, while people sort out their legs and teeth before groping their way towards a street pole around which they can throw their arms.\n\nBy the time his passengers’ eyeballs have settled back in their sockets, Togetherness is halfway back to the northern suburbs.\n\nRecipe Corner\n\ntop\n\nPork Belly Roast\n\nA Pork belly roast is such a fun and easy thing to do and it takes no time at all.\n\nPork is also a very inexpensive meat and a nicely roasted large Pork belly on a dinner table looks stunning and never fails to impress guests.\n\nYour shopping list\n\n1-2kg Pork belly (medium fat) complete with skin and somewhere between 5 and 10cm thick\n\nOlive oil\n\nSalt\n\nBlack pepper corns\n\n5 Chinese spice mix or\n\nBarbecue spice or\n\nA herb mixture such as an mix of origanum, thyme and rosemary\n\nWhat to do\n\nPut the meat side up and rub with whatever spice or herbs you have handy.\n\nWe often grind together some Chinese 5 spice and black pepper corns\n\nYou can also use a herb mix of origanum, thyme and rosemary plus salt and pepper\n\nIf you have nothing else simply use some barbecue spice\n\nWhatever you use, spice the meat side well\n\nNow turn the belly skin side up\n\nScore the skin of the belly long-ways with a sharp knife (or make diamonds like we do sometimes).\n\nMake sure that you don’t cut all the way into the meat\n\nRub the whole skin side with some olive oil.\n\nTake some coarse salt and black pepper and rub well into the cuts and all the skin.\n\nPut in a container, cover with tin-foil or Gladwrap and keep in the fridge (preferably overnight)\n\nThe next day\n\nHeat the oven to 200C\n\nTake an oven tray and fill with about 1-2cm of water\n\nPut the meat skin-side up on a rack in the tray.\n\nCook for 1.5 to 2 hours\n\nWhen the meat is done put the grill on full blast and really crisp up the skin to “bubbly” crackling.

However I am retired now. I went off on early retirement in May 2008 (at 59) due to medical reasons ie: acute heart problems, constant heart-fibrillation, diabetes, thrombosis, depression etc, etc. Guess my days are numbered.\n\nI keep busy doing the things I never got round to doing, I vacuum the house, (a domestic engineer now), prepare food for my wife who still works and I do handy-man things around the house. I would like to think that I also protect my house by being here, but these days, they even break-in and rob you whilst you are at home.\n\nMy strong points are language; English/Afrikaans and I would like to do translations for an income as one of my family members does, but he lives in Germany. He speaks of a Euro per word for translation work. My German is not nearly good enough for German translation work. However, as an unknown, it is difficult to get a break.\n\nDepending on which side of the fence you stand on, the general feeling here in S.A. is either that of euphoria or of utter despondency. The euphoria referring to those who commit fraud and corruption here on a daily basis and manage to get away with it. The government have just announced that they are thinking of abolishing TV licenses, but in its place, they want to add a 1% or 2% surcharge to every taxpayer, which really means that 7-million people will pay and the remaining 38-million will not. There is also a National “free” Medical Aid on the cards in the future which will also be added to our tax responsibility on an annual basis.\n\nThe free housing supply to all who are needy (3-million so far) is still on schedule according to the minister of housing Tokyo Sexwale, but they have lost billions to shady building contractors who build sub-standard HOP-houses and flee once they have been (handsomely) paid. Apparently, corruption does not differentiate on skin-color. However, he seems very keen to apprehend the perpetrators.\n\nAdd to that the constant black cars with black windows (sic) that scream through busy intersections with wailing sirens and with blue lights flashing, just before impacting with an innocent citizens car at a traffic light and the typical “Banana Republic” vision really starts to take place.\n\nSome cabinet ministers are allowed to “buy” personal vehicles of up to R1.2 million while the people who voted for them, rummage through rubbish-bins to look for something to eat. The new President, Jay Zee, seems to have the right objective in mind in striving to provide decent service delivery, mostly from lackluster municipalities who do exactly as they please, but it is still early days. We’ll see! Clean water supply is a major developing problem and nothing is done by anyone to stop contamination and seepage from nefarious origins which in turn poisons the underground water table.\n\nThe share-prices on the JSE fluctuate daily due to the world crisis and a return on investment that was adequate some years ago is no longer sustainable. We all are making an extra hole in our belts, literally and figuratively. The constant dropping of the repo-rate by the reserve bank leads to a vicious circle as only the people who live beyond their means benefit from it. The rest of us who actually have savings, lose out as our income rate is cut accordingly. Its a case of heads you lose, tails you lose! Survival is paramount and I really feel sorry for the really poor.\n\nThe daily murder rate here will put the American/Afghanistan war deaths to shame yet no-one seems to really care for South Africans. No-one here has the guts to bring back the death penalty to serve as a deterrent to violent crime. Perhaps the U.N. will one day send-in a peace-keeping force to protect the innocent citizens here? However, so far they have done absolutely nothing to assist innocent citizens in Zimbabwe and the head clown still reigns there quite happily and he still commits his despicable atrocities daily. So I wont hold my breath!\n\nHowever, as long as we still have Johnny Walker whiskey to block-out the daily shocking thoughts and visions, we can (must) hold on and survive. Second on my list is biltong and the occasional (expensive) braai, third. I cannot understand it, but I am developing a vegetarian approach to life lately with meat taking a lower priority. Yes I know, terrible outlook, but curiously true.\n\nI am curious now as to who was looking for me with you. Was the enquiry from S.A.? Please see if you can remember.\n\nIn conclusion, a joke;\n\nKoos and his wife were on holiday in Pattaya and they stayed at a beachfront hotel. As an early riser, Koos snuck out of the hotel at 6 in the morning and took a stroll, but a pretty street-whore saw him and offered her horizontal refreshment to him at $200.\n\nHe started to barter and offered her $20. She disdainfully turned around and walked away.\n\nLater, after breakfast, Koos and his wife went shopping and he again bumped into the same pretty tart who started to laugh hysterically.\n\nShe pointed a long finger at his wife and said: “See what you get for $20 mister!”\n\nAll the very best to all of you.\n\nRegards,\n\nBen Schulz\n\nCommercial farmers leaving SA\n\nThe Times newspaper has reported that South African farmers are leaving the country in large numbers for a variety of reasons, including unbearable working conditions. Farmers are leaving the country because of poor working conditions for neighbouring states, such as Malawi, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Soviet State of Georgia among others.\n\nThere were 120,000 commercial farmers in South Africa in 1994 and only 37,000 remain, which has led to SA importing some of the food it used to produce, said AgriSA vice president Theo de Jager.\n\nThe country was now starting to import grains such as wheat. It was also on the brink of importing meat and poultry, which was being produced less and less in the country.\n\nFarmers cited new laws, unionisation of farm workers, expensive water, electricity and other necessities, a shrinking supply of arable land, and the threat of land reform as reasons for farming in South Africa becoming unsustainable.\n\nMany farmers believe that the latest threat, the New Security of Tenure Bill, will be the last straw driving farmers from the country, as it allows workers to plant crops, keep livestock and build houses on the farm on which they work.\n\nRural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti’s spokesman Mthobeli Mxotwa said the New Security of Tenure Bill was meant to “stop cruelty against farm workers.”\n\n“Workers get kicked off farms and dumped along the side of the road”. The Land Tenure Act and Extension of Security of Tenure Act were found [to be] toothless – evictions continued unabated.\n\n“We decided to tighten the new bill in order to give farm workers rights. By the way, we also extended those rights to land owners.”\n\nSapa\n\n04 April 2011\n\n10 things I miss about South Africa\n\ntop\n\nWhat do you miss most about South Africa?\n\nWe all miss things about South Africa.\n\nIt may be great to be an Expat and some of us live in some of the most idyllic parts of the world.\n\nWe have all the safety we longed for while still at home.

Just the 10 most important mind.\n\nWe’ll publish them in our next newsletter and it will be fun to see how many of us miss the same things …\n\nHere is a start:\n\nThe 10 things I miss most about South Africa\n\nThe sound and fury of a real Jo’burg thunderstorm.\n\nThe smell after the storm has abated.\n\nA late lunch braai with your mates that ends at around midnight.\n\nHaving a greasy breakfast with the whole bunch the next morning ‘cos they never left.\n\nSitting out in my garden watching the foals frolic.\n\nThe taste of your first Castle on a Friday night.\n\nDriving through the Magaliesberg or at “Harties” on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nWeekends in the Waterberg where you can rediscover your soul amongst magnificent scenery and wildlife.\n\nDriving all the way to Broederstroom to the “chicken pie farm, home of the chicken pie”, just for one.\n\nAnd, and, and…\n\nAround the World\n\ntop\n\nBits and Bobs from people around the world\n\nHallo there all expats and Saffies around the world!\n\nThis is how I make MY biltong!\n\nHope you guys are doing well, I really enjoy the news letter and hearing from expats all over the world making biltong. For about 25 years in South Africa, we hunted every year in June, bagged a Kudu and a couple of Impala and would cut everything up for biltong. We would then hang it up in the garage and dry it with fans\n\nI moved to the USA 6 years ago and after initially struggling a bit, we found what we needed to make really nice biltong.\n\nWe normally buy 6 to 8 rump steaks, specially if Safeway (local supermarket) has a deal on the meat.\n\nI cut them in strips, probably an inch thick. I then use Baleine course sea salt and red wine vinegar. I bought Crown National Biltong Seas Safari spices with us from SA (probably same as the spices you sell)\n\nI then take a big enough container, sprinkle vinegar, salt and spices, and put one layer of cut meat, sprinkle all 3 again and then put a layer of meat and so on. This is then put in the fridge for 2 days, then hang it in the garage on wires and dry it with a good fan.\n\nI think the secret is the meat laying in the mixture of salt, spices and vinegar.\n\nYour biltong Buddy also works very well but I can just not make enough at a time!\n\nHopes this helps somebody, any expats in the US are most welcome to connect if they need help.\n\nTake care and keep up the good work.\n\nCheers\n\nDeon Pretorius\n\nUSA\n\ndeonpretorius@comcast.net\n\nSomething to smile about\n\ntop\n\nAnother couple “shorties” that keep flowing in daily\n\nA little known fact …\n\nThe first testicular guard (“ball box”) was used in cricket in 1874\n\nand the first helmet was used in 1974\n\nIt obviously took men 100 years to find out they also had brains ;-))\n\nIndian Cab Driver\n\nA drunk woman, stark naked, jumped into a taxi at a Durban Cab Rank.\n\nThe Indian driver opened his eyes wide and stared at the woman. He made no attempt to start the Cab.\n\n“What’s wrong with you Love, haven’t you ever seen a naked woman before?”\n\n“I’ll not be staring at you lady, I am telling you, that would not be proper, where I am coming from”. “Well if you’re not bloody staring at me Lovie, what are you doing then?”\n\n“Well, I am looking and looking, and I am thinking to myself, where is this lady keeping the money to be paying me with.”\n\nOn the subject of Colonoscopies…\n\nColonoscopies are no joke, but these comments during the exam were quite humorous….. A physician claimed that the following are actual comments made by his patients (predominately male) while he was performing their colonoscopies:\n\nTake it easy Doc. You’re boldly going where no man has gone before!\n\nFind Amelia Earhart yet?\n\nCan you hear me NOW?\n\nAre we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?\n\nYou know, in Arkansas , we’re now legally married.\n\nAny sign of the trapped miners, Chief?\n\nYou put your left hand in, you take your left hand out…\n\nHey! Now I know how a Muppet feels!\n\nIf your hand doesn’t fit, you must quit!\n\nHey Doc, let me know if you find my dignity.\n\nYou used to be an executive at Enron, didn’t you?’\n\nAnd the best one of all…. Could you write a note for my wife saying that my head is not up there?\n\nThe power of advertising …\n\nTwo young boys walked into a pharmacy one day, picked out a box of tampons and proceeded to the checkout counter. The man at the counter asked the older boy, “Son, how old are you?”\n\n“Eight,” the boy replied.\n\nThe man continued, “do you know what these are used for?”\n\nThe boy replied, “not exactly, but they aren’t for me.\n\nThey’re for him. He’s my brother. He’s four.\n\nWe saw on TV that if you use these you would be able to swim and ride a bike. Right now, he can’t do either.”\n\nAnd last but not least …. Why we love children …\n\nNudity\n\nI was driving with my three young children one warm summer evening when a woman in the convertible ahead of us stood up and waved. She was stark naked!\n\nAs I was reeling from the shock, I heard my 5-year-old shout from the back seat, ‘Mom, that lady isn’t wearing a seat belt!’\n\nOpinions\n\nOn the first day of school, a first-grader handed his teacher a note from his mother.\n\nThe note read, ‘The opinions expressed by this child are not necessarily those of his parents.’\n\nKetchup\n\nA woman was trying hard to get the ketchup out of the jar.\n\nDuring her struggle the phone rang so she asked her 4-year-old daughter to answer the phone. ‘Mommy can’t come to the phone to talk to you right now. She’s hitting the bottle.’\n\nMore Nudity\n\nA little boy got lost at the YMCA and found himself in the women’s locker room.\n\nWhen he was spotted, the room burst into shrieks, with ladies grabbing towels and running for cover.\n\nThe little boy watched in amazement and then asked, ‘What’s the matter, haven’t you ever seen a little boy before?’\n\nPolice\n\nWhile taking a routine vandalism report at an elementary school, I was interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old.\n\nLooking up and down at my uniform, she asked, ‘Are you a cop? Yes,’ I answered and continued writing the report.\n\nMy mother said if I ever needed help I should ask the police. Is that right?’ ‘Yes, that’s right,’ I told her. ‘Well, then,’ she said as she extended her foot toward me, ‘would you please tie my shoe?’\n\nSport talk\n\ntop\n\nSnippets from the papers\n\nWhere to now for the Proteas?\n\nGraeme Smith’s era has come to an end, not on the high he would have hoped for, and not on the high he probably deserves.\n\nFull Story\n\nLions to employ kicking coach\n\nLions coach John Mitchell has announced that they will be employing a kicking coach to help the struggling Super Rugby outfit.\n\nFull Story\n\nWhite up for Brumbies interview\n\nWorld Cup-winning coach Jake White has applied and will be interviewed for the head coaching job at Australia’s ACT Brumbies.\n\nFull Story\n\nPlenty at stake at Augusta\n\nLee Westwood, Phil Mickelson, Luke Donald, Graeme McDowell and Tiger Woods have extra incentive to win the U.S. Masters this week.\n\nRead Story\n\nSharks “desperate” to bounce back\n\nThe Sharks will be desperate to get back on the winning track when they host the Stormers after two consecutive defeats.\n\nRead Story\n\nWie Ondersteun JY?!?\n\nBlou Bul Rugby is soos ‘n Blou Movie ….

Especially our neighbours in the south of Europe are shipping it by the “truck load”!\n\nThis is the first year we actually ran out twice!\n\nBut, ‘n boer maak ‘n plan’ so we have enough fresh stock available most of the time.\n\nTo place an order just click on the picture or go to our web site at www.boerewors.be and fill in the order form.\n\nYou can either collect or we can mail it to you.\n\nAll our customers in Holland, Belgium and in fact, all over Europe are raving about the packing of and the condition in which the wors arrived at their doorsteps.\n\nJust imagine some “lekker” pap and wors with a nice tomato and onion sauce!\n\n(See the recipe section in our previous newsletter!)\n\nComplete the order form you will find by going to www.boerewors.be or give us a call on +32 (16) 53.96.25.\n\nOur Boerewors is vacuum packed in quantities of about 500 gram.\n\nLike with everything else the price has increased slightly because of the increase in the price of meat, spices and casings. Our spices from South Africa have gone up by no less than 43% and there is a big shortage of casings we are told because China is buying up whatever they can get hold of!\n\nOur normal price at the moment is € 10.25 per kg but for the time being we will keep it at only € 8.45 per kg!!\n\nYou can also place your order by simply clicking here.\n\nDroëwors around the world\n\ntop\n\nDroëwors …… a typical South African delicacy all of its own!\n\nDroëwors, as it is known in South Africa, is as much part of the country’s culinary culture as Biltong, Pap, Boerewors and Potjiekos.\n\nThe spices are of course imported especially from South Africa so you will get the “real” thing!\n\nFresh droëwors is available right now and we normally have ample stock.\n\nThe price is € 40.00 € 29.00 per 1kg pack or € 4.50 € 4.00 per 100 gram packet (at 08-04-2011).\n\nDroëwors (like biltong) travels well and posting is an ideal option.\n\nWe can mail it to you anywhere in the world via priority mail in minimum quantities of 500 gram.\n\nYou can place your order now by going to www.boerewors.be, give us a call on +32 (16) 53.96.25 or email us.\n\ntop\n\nBiltong for all our readers!\n\ntop\n\nBiltong …… once hooked you’re a slave forever!\n\nBiltong is without doubt the snack most associated with South Africa!\n\nIt is so much part of South African culture that there is no food related shop that will not stock it. You find it literally anywhere.\n\nSay Biltong and you say South Africa!\n\nBiltongmakers.Com has for more than 16 years supplied their Home Biltong Makers to South African expats all over the world so they could make their own biltong away from home.\n\nWe were often asked why we don’t make Biltong ourselves and then make it available to the poor and deprived South Africans living away from the Mother Country!\n\nThe requests were relentless and constant so almost 5 years ago we decided to give it a go and you can now get your biltong (and chilli bites) directly from us.\n\nThe spices are of course imported from South Africa so you will get the “real” taste like “back home”!\n\nThe price is € 50.00 39.00 per 1kg pack or € 5.50 4.95 per 75 gram packet.\n\nBiltong travels well and posting is an ideal option.\n\nWe can mail it to you anywhere in the world via priority mail.\n\nTo place your order please go to www.biltongmakers.be and click on one of the order form links.

In October we did our last one for a while. We needed a rest!!\n\nIt is almost summer again and the right time to start thinking about a spit braai this Spring or Summer.\n\nLike every year, we are already booked almost full for May and part of June .\n\nSo, if you want to be part of the fun and really impress your friends, colleagues or other acquaintances, book now!\n\nLamb or pig on the Spit is a way of entertaining as only known by very few mainly because it is thought to be very expensive ……. Not so!\n\nWe will do a Spit Barbecue for parties of between 30 and 50 people from just € 22.50 per person.\n\nTogether with the meat we will treat you to a big pot of curried potatoes, a tomato/salsa salad as well as an incredible Tzatziki (cucumber, yoghurt and mint) salad. Garlic or bread rolls are included as well. And, don’t forget the mint sauce with the lamb and the apple sauce with the piggy!\n\nFor venues more than 50 km from our home base in Keerbergen there is a small transport fee.\n\nStart planning now for those special occasions! Just keep in mind that quite a number of dates up to October are already booked!\n\nRemember that we are doing these functions only during weekends.\n\nBooking early is essential and you can do so on\n\n+32 (16) 53.96.25 or email us.\n\n(A Lamb or pig on the Spit can only be done outside because we cook on coals!)\n\ntop\n\nSubscribing and Unsubscribing\n\ntop\n\nPerhaps you would like to subscribe to this newsletter or tell a friend about Biltongmakers.Com! and the incredible Biltong Makers!!

Views and opinions reflected in our newsletter are not necessarily those of Biltongmakers.Com and its team members.\n\nKeerbergen\n\nBelgium\n\nThe “Aegean Jet” was skimming the waters at a fast pace. The spray of the wake thrown up by the catamaran’s twin turbo diesel engines sometimes shooting as high as 10 feet into the air.\n\nThe sky was deep blue and the breeze coming from the Aegean sea cooling on the skin.\n\nWe got up at 5.30 to be at the harbour on time to catch the boat.\n\nThe trip to Rhodes was relaxing. A lovely boat with airplane-like seating and a speed to almost match it! I stood outside at the bow for most of the 50 minute trip.\n\nWe arrived in the little harbour of Rhodes at around 10.30 and were soon through customs.\n\nOutside taxi drivers were vying for our custom. They were all offering an hour long guided tour around the town. We haggled a bit (even June is getting quite good at it!) and were soon shown the most important sights around the small town. I did not know that this is the best preserved and fully operational medieval village in the world. Complete with walls and the original houses and buildings.\n\nOf course the houses are now mostly occupied by tourist shops. A bit of a pity.\n\nThe trip to Rhodes Island in Greece was one of the things we promised ourselves during our trip to Turkey.\n\nJust days before …..\n\nWe were coming from the theater and were walking down Curetes street. The afternoon sun was beating down on my capless bald patch and we were hot.\n\nWalking down towards the library on the square at the end of the road, we passed the Memmius Monument and Domitian Place and we were talking amongst ourselves how incredible well this whole town was kept.\n\nJust past the public lavatories on the right, were the terraced houses of the rich and famous and just ahead of us was Hadrian’s temple.\n\nWe were in Ephesus the ancient town in western Turkey.\n\nEphesus was first heard of over 4000 years ago but the town we walked through was from the Roman time – around 30-100 AD.\n\nI always wanted to see Ephesus because it has such an incredible history. Not only biblical but long before that as well.\n\nWe arrived there on Sunday afternoon after a harrowing journey during which June found out that our driver of our small 16 seater bus was dozing off behind the wheel. Needless to say he was fired with full support of all. A new driver was installed and although he was wide awake and did not fall asleep behind the wheel he only knew one speed up and down the mountain passes. And his hooter of course!\n\nEven I was worried – which says a lot!!\n\nBut let me start at the beginning ….\n\nWe were on holiday in Turkey. We stayed in a little village called Icmeler, a lovely small place on a beautiful bay.\n\nWe needed to get some sun in and on our bodies and this was the place to do it.\n\nIt was quiet. The tourists had mostly left with only a few remaining. It was the middle of October and soon most holiday places would close down completely not to open again till next April.\n\nOne of the things, apart from lazing by the pool or on the tiny beach was a trip to Ephesus and Hierapolis with its beautiful terraced baths.\n\nIt turned out to be the highlight of our holiday.\n\nI cannot even start to explain how incredible well preserved Ephesus is. And till today only 30% has been unearthed! I also cannot even start to talk about the history of the town. Artimus was their goddess and both the apostles John and Paul spent time there.\n\nJust little away from the town is the house where Mary spent the last days of her life\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, if that is at all possible, you cannot possibly do all of this in one day . There are so many buildings to see and read up on. From the library built by Celsus (see top left, that’s our little group in the front), the Grand Theater that could seat 25000 people, the terrace houses of the rich to the plague of Nike, the goddess of victory.\n\nCan you see where Nike took their emblem from?\n\nWe left walking down harbour street with in the distance the prison [where Paul was held for three years] looking down on us from it’s mountain perch. From there we went to Hierapolis but I cannot go in to that as well unfortunately. I would need another 10 pages!\n\nIf you are interested in this type of history please click on the link for Ephesus and Hierapolis. Enjoy it!\n\nFor the rest it was a sun break.. We soaked up the sun, para-sailed, went on a trip to Rhodes Island in Greece and visited the small little markets in Icmeler and Marmaris.\n\nWe needed the break!\n\nThe last Saturday we watched South Africa win the Worldcup sitting in a small road side restaurant. We were the only South Africans amongst the dozens of England supporters!\n\nI felt good when we won. We cheered every move, English or Bokke. Do you think for one moment that even one of the UK supporters would cheer a good move by us?\n\nNo Sirree!\n\nWell, winter has really hit us early. When June went to work early this morning (at 6.30) it was -4C!\n\nWhen I got myself out of bed eventually and looked out of the upstairs windows, all I could see was white frost. Brrrrrr!\n\nSitting here looking out of the study window it looks nice and sunny but believe me, there is a bite in the air.\n\nThe gardener came this morning to clear up some of the leaves. He is standing outside right now with the leave blower. Poor chap.\n\nI feel sorry for him. But, he needs the work.\n\nI think he is Albanian and does not speak a word of anything that I speak so communication is by means of showing him what to do and how to do it and through a complicated system of hand signals we have developed between the two of us!\n\nHis name is Ashok and he is the husband of our “poetsvrouw” or cleaning lady (that’s what they call them here).\n\nI can’t believe that there are just 24 days to go before it is Christmas again. June and I have decided to stay home this year.\n\nShe cannot get off this December and has to work straight through.\n\nEven boxing day is not a holiday in Belgium! Slave drivers!\n\nBut, last year was her turn when she took three weeks off to go to Singapore. Now it’s one of her colleagues!\n\nNo problem though. I cannot remember when we were on our own for Christmas!\n\nOne last little story\n\nAt the end of October it was little Caitlyn’s birthday. We went to Den Haag to be at her little party. She turned four. Towards the end of the afternoon she was quietly dressing her playmate.\n\nOne of the presents she got was a little box of a kind of rhinestone stickers. The kind that you can stick on paper or your dolly or yourself for that matter.\n\nVery carefully she put another star on its back and then a couple of coloured buttons It crawled slowly across the table having to carry this extra load seemed a bit difficult.\n\nThe little eyes on their stalks turning around to see what is was on its back.\n\nEventually she was told to go and put it back in the garden which she dutifully did, complete with adornments.\n\nSoon afterward we heard a splat and a crunch. Tony had gone outside for a smoke ……..\n\nAt least it went looking beautiful!\n\nWell, that leaves me to say cheers. If you don’t hear from me before the time please have a lovely time over Christmas with your friends and family and may the New Year bring some peace and quiet in this world for a change.\n\nWe all need that!\n\nLo\n\nWhere there is hope,there is light.\n\nWhere there is faith,there is an end in sight.\n\nwhere there is a will, there is a way.\n\nWhere there is love, there is the strength to brave the day.\n\nGod bless!\n\nStand still for a moment… top\n\nWhat shall I give for Christmas?\n\nA listening ear to the friend with a heartache.\n\nA thank you to the tired salesperson who serves you.\n\nLaughter to brighten a less-fortunate’s life.\n\nA kiss and a hug for a handicapped child.\n\nTime to read to the sightless.\n\nAn act of kindness to the shut-in.\n\nA cheery greeting to one who is ill.\n\nA smile to the elderly person who is struggling to walk.\n\nA written message to a lonely one.\n\nHow simple our Christmas shopping can be this year –\n\nAnd every year – when we give gifts of the heart.\n\nStory of the month top\n\nFlanders’ Poppies\n\nEver Ask the Question………\n\nWhat have Red Poppies have to do with Veterans Day?\n\nFor many years I have found myself asking what the significance of the red poppies were in relation to Veterans or Armistice Day.\n\nThis year that question was asked of me and I had no answer.\n\nI just had to find out the story behind the symbol and what a lot of interesting information I found!\n\nHere it is, put together as well as I could from all kinds of bits and pieces I read …..\n\nThroughout history is has been noted that after most major wars poppies popped up in the battlefields and on soldiers graves.\n\nIt seems that poppy seeds can lay dormant in the soil but when the soil is heavily turned or dug up they start to grow!\n\nThe most detailed of this event took place in World War One in Flanders, Belgium. In the craters where bombs fell and on the mounds of rubble, poppies bloomed everywhere.\n\nThe heavily churned earth and the high concentration of lime from the limestone buildings made the perfect catalyst for the poppies to grow.\n\nNear Ypres (Ieper), where the fighting was at it’s fiercest, the soldiers were greeted by an amazing sight as they ventured out of the trenches in early Spring.\n\nThe fields were covered with a carpet of red as the local Flanders Poppy flourished in the recently bomb-tilled soil.\n\nThis, and perhaps the death of his close friend, Lieutenant Alexis Helme, in the second week of fighting during the Second Battle of Ypres (Ieper), was the inspiration for Canadian artillery officer and military doctor, Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, to pen his now famous poem on a scrap piece of paper on May 2nd, 1915: –\n\nMcCrae’s “In Flanders Fields” remains to this day one of the most memorable war poems ever written. It is a lasting legacy of the terrible battle in the Ypres (Ieper) salient in the spring of 1915.\n\n“The poem was very nearly not published. Dissatisfied with it, McCrae tossed the poem away, but a fellow officer retrieved it and sent it to newspapers in England.\n\nThe Spectator, in London, rejected it, but Punch published it on December 8th, 1915, where it was seen as an invitation for recruits.\n\nIn Flanders Fields\n\nIn Flanders fields the poppies blow\n\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\n\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\n\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly\n\nScarce heard amid the guns below\n\nWe are the Dead. Short days ago\n\nWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,\n\nLoved and were loved, and now we lie\n\nIn Flanders fields\n\nTake up our quarrel with the foe:\n\nTo you from failing hands we throw\n\nThe torch; be yours to hold it high.\n\nIf ye break faith with us who die\n\nWe shall not sleep,\n\nthough poppies grow\n\nIn Flanders fields\n\nJohn McRae’s commanding officer records that ‘this poem was born of fire and blood during the hottest phase of the second battle of Ypres’. This battle began on April 22 1915 and lasted 17 days. Total casualties have been estimated at 100,000 on either side.\n\nHalf the Canadian brigade to which John McRae was attached were killed.\n\nShortly afterwards a profoundly weary McRae was posted away from the front line to a hospital in Boulogne. Friends were worried by the change in him.\n\nHe worked at the hospital until January 1918, and was about to take up a post with the British army when he fell ill with double pneumonia and meningitis, and died on January 28.\n\nHe is buried in the cemetery at Wimereux, France.\n\nAfter its publication in Punch the poem soon became the unofficial anthem of the soldiers in the trenches where it was memorised and passed on by word of mouth.\n\nOne of the many readers moved by it was Moina Michael, the American War Secretary of the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association).\n\nShe suggested that American ex-servicemen adopt the poppy as their emblem, and started plans for artificial poppies to be made.\n\nIn November 1918, Moina Michael penned a response to McCrae’s poem entitled “We shall keep the faith” where she promised to wear a red poppy each year in remembrance.\n\nWe Shall Keep the Faith\n\nOh! you who sleep in Flanders Fields,\n\nSleep sweet – to rise anew!\n\nWe caught the torch you threw\n\nAnd holding high, we keep the Faith\n\nWith All who died\n\nWe cherish, too, the poppy red\n\nThat grows on fields where valor led;\n\nIt seems to signal to the skies\n\nThat blood of heroes never dies,\n\nBut lends a lustre to the red\n\nOf the flower that blooms above the dead\n\nIn Flanders Fields\n\nAnd now the Torch and Poppy Red\n\nWe wear in honor of our dead.\n\nFear not that ye have died for naught;\n\nWe’ll teach the lesson that ye wrought\n\nIn Flanders Fields\n\nThe Tradition grows\n\nIn 1918, on the 11th day of the 11th month at 11 o’clock in the morning the Germans signed the armistice and World War One was officially over.\n\nThat day is now remembered as Armistice Day or Remembrance Day.\n\nThe idea of wearing silk Poppies caught on and soon became a tradition amongst those wishing to remember the soldiers who had not returned.\n\nWearing a poppy in November is a way of remembering those who gave their lives for their country.\n\nThe first Poppy Day was held on November 11 1921 and John McRae’s poem has been associated with the Poppy Appeal ever since.\n\nOn Armistice Day in Ieper (Ypres) in Flanders, the idea for The Poppy Umbrella was inspired by the powerful image of poppies growing amongst the soldiers’ graves in John McCrae’s poem.\n\nNote by the editor:\n\nSome years ago when I went to Ieper (Ypres) for the first time I came back and said to June that the whole trip had been kind of eerie.\n\nI found that driving around in the western part of South Flanders, around where Ieper and Koksijde are, that I was driving around in one big graveyard.\n\nThe old bunkers, the abandoned airfields and the tank defenses still there make you feel that it could still be war.\n\nJust no more soldiers ….\n\n[Footnote: Did you know that more than 3000 years ago Poppies were taken to the graves of the dead as a sign of respect!]\n\n* * * * Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement – Advertisement * * * *\n\nThe South African Meat Industry Company,\n\nSamic has very nice meat cutting charts.\n\nJust click on the banner below for lots of interesting information.\n\nI must compliment whoever does the SAMIC newsletter for their lovely sayings!

He runs a little chat web site. Bill ordered his biltong maker at the end of September to be delivered by surface mail from South Africa. He paid with PayPal.\n\nThree weeks later he decides that he has now waited long enough and cancels his PayPal payment. Goods not received! “I’ll pay when the goods finally get here”\n\nThis is the very first time in our 12 years of existence that this has happened. What did you expect Bill?

A fan will assist with the drying of the meat especially in areas where high humidity is experienced at times.\n\nAlthough not necessary, the fan will certainly reduce the drying time giving those people who make Biltong on a small commercial basis a chance to increase their output!\n\nTalking about small industrial manufacturers I must think about one of our customers in England who makes Biltong at home and then sells it on EBay! Apart from making money out of it he also keeps himself supplied with Biltong free of charge!\n\nThe fan option will be available as an accessory in our on-line shop and will cost only R 155.00 fitted or\n\nR 99.50 as a “do-it-yourself’ kit.\n\nIt will be available from the middle of January.\n\nAs an additional improvement all Rockey’s Biltong Makers will be fitted with an on/off switch and both Home Biltong Makers will be fitted with a standard EU cable with a moulded two-pin plug.\n\nAnd so, once again, we have improved on previous models and have made it easier and quicker than ever before for you to make your Biltong.

Cut the potato in half. Take an apple-corer [usually a stainless steel circle shaped utensil with serrated teeth at the end] and shove/turn it into the middle of the flat surface that you have just cut, about half-way. Leave it there and take a knife and cut a 10mm “skirt” horizontal to the flat surface into and towards the corer which is still in the potato, whilst turning.\n\nThe “skirt” is now loose and can be broken off or slid down the corer shaft, to be used elsewhere.\n\nNow, gently slide the corer off the potato shaft or push it out with your pinkie and you now are left with a potato that looks like a white button mushroom!\n\nThis may sound like hard work, but I found that after a few minutes I could churn them out at a rapid rate and they look so good!\n\nEither deep-fry them or use in your Potjie, but not for too long as they will start to disintegrate and you will lose the mushroom effect.\n\nThey look and taste so good and everyone is very perplexed as to the taste and as to what they really are. Everyone loves them as we all “eat with our eyes”, don’t we?\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBen Schultz\n\nNelspruit\n\nSouth Africa\n\nOur spices are Kosher and Halaal!\n\nIt will certainly interest our Jewish readers that our biltong spices are certified as being kosher by the Beth Din of Johannesburg.

Not long ago I was asked to address a garden club in the next street to where my fame as a gardener had spread. The subject: “Gardening as a therapy”.\n\nWhen I sat down to think about the subject, I realised most of my gardening was pure therapy anyway, because most of what I grew was thrown away. My family was unable to keep up with production.\n\nYou cannot plant one cabbage just as you cannot plant one potato or a single bunch of carrots. So, in midsummer you end up with a dozen full-grown cabbages, kilograms of beans, clouds of cauliflower, brinjals by the bag and tomatoes enough to stock Woolworths.\n\nMy wife would say: “We cannot possibly eat a cabbage a day.”\n\n‘We cannot possibly eat a cabbage a day’ I couldn’t see why not. If we were starving we’d give an arm and leg for a fat cabbage. “Give them to the neighbours,” she said, knowing perfectly well that the last season when I threw cabbages over the wall the neighbours threw them back. In any event, in any suburb north of Parktown West, one is not allowed to talk to one’s neighbours.\n\nI think there’s a by-law.\n\nThere are exceptions. For instance, in the event of a fire next door one is allowed to call out “Fire!” three times; and again, in the event of an earthquake registering 9 on the Richter Scale, or, say, in the event of a catastrophic flood such as we had in 1994 when I last had cause to address a neighbour.\n\nThere was a howling gale, I recall. The rain was lashing down and my neighbour was frantically smashing a hole though the back wall of his garage.\n\nFlood water was damming up against the back of his house and the pressure had to be relieved.\n\n“Having a spot of bother, are we?” I called over the fence.\n\n“Yes,” he shouted over the roar of the water.\n\nI clucked – loudly, in the hope he could hear that I was concerned. But neither of us went on and on about it. Eventually the wall burst and he was washed away, probably ending up in the mainstream Jukskei. I kept meaning to ask our maid to ask their maid if they found him.\n\nAnyway, these particular neighbours were wary of me because they once saw me talking to my vegetables. Talking to vegetables provides excellent mental therapy.\n\nI have often wondered what would have happened had my neighbours learned that when they were out I peeped over the wall and talked to their vegetables, too. (I just said “Howzit?” and things like that.)\n\nMy modest success in growing vegetables was not due to any innate farming genius within the Clarke family. In fact the Clarkes, right back to the time of Ethelred the Unsteady, have been intensely urban people who mostly ended their days by being run over by buses or falling down manholes.\n\nMy success with beans and things was, I am convinced, because I talked to them as equals.\n\nMany people do not believe me but, sometimes, vegetables talk back. I have recorded elsewhere (see Annals of the Cruciferous Soc., Nat Arch. Vol III 8673:1 op cit. sit op.) how cabbages enjoy talking politics. Pumpkins, too. The latter sometimes get into parliament.\n\nOnions can be so emotional they bring tears to one’s eyes; turnips can be hilarious.\n\nWhen I suggested to a particularly healthy lettuce that she went into politics with the pumpkins she said the celery… wasn’t good enough. Oh how we laughed.\n\nRecipe Corner top\n\nTwo lovely recipes!\n\nIn the last newsletter (August) we had several bread recipes. This month something different from long, long ago.\n\nHere we go ….\n\nRon Warren’s biltong recipe\n\nThis is a Biltong recipe sent in by Ron Warren from South Africa in November 2003.\n\nIngredients for the spice mix\n\n700 gm medium salt\n\n180 gm brown sugar\n\n15 ml black pepper\n\n120 gm ground coriander (I do not enjoy the scorched and coarsely ground as it sticks in teeth)\n\n30ml bicarbonate of soda\n\nHow to use the spice mix and make the Biltong\n\nSprinkle 40 gm per kg of meat\n\nAdd a generous sprinkle of vinegar between layers of biltong\n\nAllow to stand for at least 6 to 8 hours turning the meat over half way\n\nDip biltong in 350ml vinegar and 4.5 liters of boiling water (or hot) and hang to dry\n\nI have lines in my pantry above my fridge and deep freezes with a fan mounted to one side and this works like a dream especially in muggy damp weather.\n\nThe heat off the fridge and freezers keeps the air dry especially at night. The biltong is allowed to drip until dry outside before I move it inside.\n\nI make biltong and dry wors the whole year round.\n\nFor my dry wors I use a dry wors premix but add 1/3 chili-bite biltong mix to it and even my kids love it.\n\nAll the best\n\nRon Warren\n\nSouth Africa\n\nronwarren@xsinet.co.za\n\nGeorge Wolvaardt se Potjiekos\n\nThis recipe was sent to us by George Wolvaardt in July 2003\n\nHierdie potjie is altyd lekkerrrr!!\n\nDit kan binneshuis op die stoof gemaak word as die weer baie sleg is, gebruik platboom potjie vir die stoof.\n\nWat om the gebruik\n\n1 kg Stowe beesvleis ( in blokkies gesny) Skaap of hoender werk net so lekker.\n\n1 ui fyngekap\n\n3 knoffelhuisies fyngekap\n\n25 ml olyfolie\n\nGroente na smaak.
