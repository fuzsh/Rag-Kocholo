        "text": "“I can’t talk now, darling, I’m performing at the National”\n\nYes, this was the night that I and several others from Threadmash performed at the National Theatre.\n\nThreadmash Begets NashMash\n\nThreadmash is one of Rohan Candappa’s bright ideas. We have been meeting on and off for five years now, writing short pieces to order and then performing them to each other (and occasionally also to invitees). Here is a link to my write up of the first event, which includes my first Threadmash piece:\n\nThe idea needed to morph into ThreadZoomMash during the pandemic and now seems to have retained the capital M for mash. If you are a real glutton for this sort of thing, this link here is a tag for all of the ThreadMash pieces on Ogblog, which will include this one.\n\nAnyway…\n\n…Rohan decided to try the National Theatre foyer bars as a venue this time around – cunningly timed with two quite long plays at the Olivier and Lyttelton both starting at 19:30. That gave us ample time to perform in the relative quiet between the start of the plays and the intervals.\n\nThe relative quiet was rather noisily broken by the bar staff hoovering up around us, very early in the reading of Geraldine’s piece, but we’ll put that temporary disturbance aside. The venue worked.\n\nAnd we can all honestly claim now that we have performed at The National Theatre.\n\nRohan threaded our pieces together, as is his way. In this instance, with the topic “The Phone Call”, Rohan’s thread covered Alexander Graham Bell‘s innovation, the practical telephone. Also the contribution of the lesser known but colourful Florentine, Antonio Meucci, who largely invented that communication method before Bell, but was too polite to patent the critically novel elements of the technology he had discovered.\n\nGeraldine’s piece came first. A charming throwback to 1973, Geraldine recounted her mother’s almost infeasibly regular long-distance calls to Geraldine (who had escaped to New York). Geraldine’s mum persistently tried, in vain, to persuade her daughter to return to “Hicksville” and resume the “normal” life into which Geraldine had, to her mother’s perception, been born.\n\nRohan then reminded us all that Alexander Graham Bell’s first phone call was to an employee who awaited his call…\n\nMr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you\n\n…starting the mighty tradition of bosses using such devices to issue instructions to underlings.\n\nRohan was rather sniffy about my ability to follow a simple instruction – i.e. to write a story about a phone call. I cannot imagine what Rohan’s beef might have been.\n\nThe Phone Call by Ian Harris\n\nWe don’t go out so much anymore. Not since the pandemic. It’s not a fear of infection or anything like that. It’s just that we have got out of the habit. It now takes something especially interesting or unusual to lure us back to the theatre or concert hall. One such interesting concert caught our eyes recently – a concert of African chamber music at the Wigmore Hall, led by Tunde Jegede, who is both a virtuoso kora player and a classically-trained cellist. The kora is a large West-African 21-stringed plucking instrument, sometimes described as a cross between a lute and a harp. Janie and I like the Wigmore Hall. It is one of the few remaining public spaces where we still normally bring down the average age of the audience quite significantly. But we soon saw, on arrival at the Wigmore Hall for the kora concert, that this audience was different. Only sparsely populated with “the usual suspects”, the average age of the audience was, horror of horrors, below ours. The front row still had a comfortingly senior look. Next to Janie was a beaming, white-haired woman you might have got from central casting had you requested “a left-over hippy”. The woman was very friendly and chatty – clearly not part of the regular front row mafia. Familiar with the kora – she had spent time in West Africa when younger – she was a fan of Tunde Jegede’s playing but had not previously managed to see him play live. She was, as the young folk say, super-excited. The first half of the concert was truly magical. Tunde had brought with him a posse of chamber musicians from Lagos, together with a wonderful percussionist. We were transported by the music, not least the entrancing sound of Tunde’s kora-playing. During the interval, our friendly neighbour said that she was delighted with the live music experience and thrilled that we had enjoyed it. She recommended and wrote down the names of a couple of Tunde’s albums for us to follow up, which we did. I wondered what those silky-sounding kora strings are made of. Our otherwise-expert neighbour didn’t know. More or less at that moment, Tunde came on to the stage to rearrange the setting for the second half of the concert. As he was standing, with his kora, about three yards away from me, it seemed only polite to ask him about the strings. I was expecting the answer to be something along the lines of, “skin from an antelope’s anus or a sitatunga’s scrotum“. But instead, Tunde simply said, “Nylon”. “Just Nylon”, I asked, hoping for more enlightenment. “Just Nylon”, said Tunde, gently. The second half of the concert was also good but less to our taste. Tunde didn’t play his kora – instead he demonstrated his skills as a cellist. The fusion theme was retained, as the pieces were arrangements of traditional African music, but to us the real magic had been the kora. I tried to work out the common theme in Tunde’s unusual choice of devices for his multi-instrumentalism. I concluded that Tunde likes making music while holding his instrument between his legs. 525 WORDS\n\nI smiled to myself as I hit the save button and e-mailed my piece to Rohan Candappa for review.\n\nNinety minutes later, my iPhone buzzed.\n\nIt was Rohan.\n\n“Ian, old chap”, said Rohan. “A charming vignette, but it has nothing to do with the subject and title – The Phone Call”.\n\n“I beg to differ”, I said. “The piece is absolutely about The Phone Call”. The introductory story about the kora concert is a MacGuffin. The main story is about the phone call.\n\n“Well”, said Rohan, “I did consider e-mailing you, but then…”\n\n“…never explain”, I interrupted. “You and I have collaborated on and off for over 50 years now, Rohan. Many things don’t need to be said.”\n\nI pressed the “end call” button.\n\nReturning To NashMash\n\nIt seemed that everyone else was able to understand and obey a simple instruction from Rohan…even Jan.\n\nStrangely, Jan, like Geraldine, had set her story in 1973. Without conferring. The central conceit of Jan’s story, which revolved around an uprooted little girl whose family had recently moved to a different town, was a troubling phone call aimed at one or both parents, inadvertently picked up by the little girl.\n\nSimilarly strange was the structural similarity between Jan’s and Julie’s story, which was also about a troubling phone call picked up by someone other than the intended recipient of the call. Julie’s was not set in a particular bygone year, but the details within the story suggested 1970s as well.\n\nDavid’s story was about a character who bought a vintage GPO rotary telephone through the internet and, as a result, got a phone call more than he had bargained for.\n\nAll of The Phone Call stories were charming, thought-provoking and enjoyable to hear. It was also very pleasing to spend time with the ThreadMash gang again, even though we were a somewhat depleted group on this occasion.\n\nSadly, Kay, who was going to join us, was unable to attend due to the recent death of her mother. Yet Kay made a charming contribution to the collection of stories by e-mail a couple of days later:\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words and my goodness that picture of Kay’s is worth at least that many. But Rohan had instructed us to limit our stories to a maximum of 800 words. Honestly, some people can’t comply with the simplest of instructions from the ThreadMaster.\n\nJohn Bull – First Gresham Professor Of Music\n\nWe have no evidence of a direct connection between Sir Thomas Gresham and Hampton Court Palace, but we do have evidence that Sir Thomas’s father, Sir Richard Gresham, supplied tapestries and drapes to Cardinal Wolsey for his new palace at Hampton Court, around the time of Sir Thomas’s infancy.\n\nAround the time that Thomas Gresham was born, c1519, Henry VIII was still a relatively young monarch, about 27 years old, although he had already been king for some 10 years.\n\nHenry VIII is reputed to have been a fine tennis player as a young man and also reputed to have been a fine musician. There is a rich tradition of late medieval nobles being enthusiasts of both music and tennis. Philip The Bold of Burgundy, some 150 years before Henry VIII, being a notable example and subject of a recent performance symposium:\n\nHenry VIII: King, Tennis Player & Composer\n\nIndeed, around the time of Thomas Gresham’s birth, a wonderful manuscript of polyphony was produced, known colloquially as the Henry VIII Manuscript. In British Library circles it is known as MS 31922. If you think “circa 1519” is a bit vague for the birth of Thomas Gresham, dig “circa 1510-1520” for the Henry VIII manuscript. Probably c1518.\n\nThe manuscript contains 109 pieces, including 20 songs and 13 instrumentals attributed to Henry VIII. If you have a DIAMM (Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music) registration you can peruse the whole book on-line here.\n\nQuestion for the audience: would anyone care to name one or more of Henry VIII’s compositions?\n\nNo, not Greensleeves. But we shall come back to Greensleeves.\n\nWe have no reason to doubt the attribution of the Manuscript’s 33 pieces to Henry VIII. Some of those pieces are adaptations of existing works and others were doubtlessly written in collaboration with tutors, although Henry alone gets the credit.\n\nProbably the best known of Henry VIII’s compositions is Pastime With Good Company. Let’s give that one a go.\n\nOxford Camerata under Jeremy Summerly (a visiting Gresham professor of music) have recorded Pastime With Good Company – you can hear that recording by clicking here or below:\n\nHenry VIII’s composing days, to the extent that we have a written record of them, seem to have petered out by 1520 and his mortal coil was shed in 1547. Which brings us to the inconvenient truth – it is utterly implausible that Henry VIII composed the song, or even heard the tune of Greensleeves.\n\nGreensleeves\n\nGreensleeves was first registered at The London Stationer’s Company on 3 September 1580 by Richard Jones: “A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves”. It was the first but not the only ballad with Greensleeves in the title to be registered that month. Actually, in broadside ballad registration terms, a veritable epidemic of this new term, Greensleeves, broke out in early September 1580 and continued quite relentlessly for several years.\n\nWe cannot be sure whether any of the surviving lyrics were part of that initial 1580 bout of registration, but there is a very early surviving version of the song from 1584 in an anthology, A Handful of Pleasant Delights. In that book the song is entitled:\n\nA New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green Sleeves. To the new tune of Green Sleeves.\n\nWe’ll be working from the 1584 version.\n\nWhile it is entirely possible that tunes akin to the tune we now know as Greensleeves and lyrics akin to the 1580s lyrics might have been around for a while ahead of publication, it is unlikely that anything we might recognise as Greensleeves was around much before 1580.\n\nMy early music teacher, Ian Pittaway, explains the history of the piece on his website, click here or below.\n\nThe musical structure of the piece, which is grounded in the melodic, almost jazz-like progressions known as passamezzo antico and romanesca…\n\n[Explain here/demonstrate what that means]\n\n…which emerged in Italy in the first half of the 16th century, but this type of “ground” really caught on as part of the English style in the 1570s.\n\nYou can learn about and hear several examples of mid-16th century European composition in Christopher Page’s fascinating 2017 lecture: The Guitar in Tudor London – click here for all of the Gresham resources on that lecture or below to see the lecture:\n\nWhile mid 16th century musical development will have come too late for Henry VIII, it is likely that Sir Thomas Gresham will have heard music in that style, during his several long stays in the low countries between 1543 and 1567. In particular, in the 1560s, when Gresham was Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Duchess Margaret of Parma, Antwerp and Brussels were melting pots of European culture. Burgon, in his Life and Times of Thomas Gresham, translates from a contemporary account of Antwerp by Lodovico Guicciardini, Description dc Tout le Pais Bas, &c. 1568:\n\nIt was not uncommon…to meet with a lady who could converse in five, six, or even seven different languages…\n\n…on every side, and at all hours, were to be seen signs of festivity and merriment ; there was a constant succession of gay assemblies, nuptials, and dances ; while music, singing, and cheerful sounds prevailed in every street.\n\nSounds like my kind of town.\n\nWhether it was this steeping in European music culture that inspired Thomas Gresham to endow music professorship, we’ll never know. Burgon thought it explained the choice of music for a professorship, whereas John Guy, in the most recent biography of Thomas Gresham, suggests that music (as a subset of astronomy) was part of the standard curriculum at Oxford and Cambridge in the late Tudor period and therefore not especially noteworthy.\n\nWe’ll also never know whether Thomas Gresham, who died in 1579, ever heard Greensleeves. It is, in my view, extremely unlikely that he heard either the specific tune or one of the lyrics that we now think of as Greensleeves, but it is highly likely that Thomas Gresham would have heard some progressive music of that kind, whether he liked it or not.\n\nBut what of the lyrics? I realised, when preparing this event, that I had never really listened to or thought about the words of Greensleeves. Of course I knew that the song was about a man who has courted a lady and not got anywhere, but I hadn’t REALLY thought about the words. I’m guessing that most of you have given this matter similarly little thought.\n\nYour song sheets have got the first two and the last three verses of the 1584 version of the song. I have omitted the twelve middle verses, which I’ll explain when we get there.\n\nFeel free to join in the chorus.\n\nVERSE ONE\n\nAlas, my love, ye do me wrong, To cast me off discourteously;\n\nAnd I have loved you so long, Delighting in your company.\n\nCHORUS\n\nGreensleeves was all my joy, Greensleeves was my delight, Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who but Lady Greensleeves?\n\nVERSE TWO\n\nI have been ready at your hand, To grant whatever you would crave, I have both waged life and land, your love and goodwill for to have.\n\nCHORUS\n\nGreensleeves was all my joy, Greensleeves was my delight, Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who but Lady Greensleeves?\n\nThe next twelve verses describe in great detail the gifts that the unsuccessful suitor has heaped upon the lady in question. To paraphrase:\n\n“kerchers to thy head”,\n\n“board and bed”,\n\n“petticoats of the best”,\n\n“jewels to thy chest”,\n\n“a smock of silk”,\n\n“a girdle of gold”,\n\n“pearls”,\n\n“a purse”,\n\n“gilt knives”,\n\n“a pin case”,\n\n“crimson stockings of silk”,\n\n“pumps as white as was the milk”,\n\n“a gown of the grassy green”,\n\n“sleeves of satin” for “our harvest queen”,\n\n“garters decorated with gold and silver”,\n\n“a gelding”,\n\n“servant men clothed in green”,\n\n“dainties to eat”…\n\n…”and a cuddly toy…didn’t she do well?\n\nI described these inventory list verses to my young singing teacher, Lydia White, who said:\n\nThat is SO ick…\n\nThe word Ick had not featured in my vocabulary until that moment, but I hardly needed to look up the definition to know what it means.\n\nThe singer/suitor, it seems to me, is utterly unsuited to the business of courtship. he knows how to let the lady and the listeners know how wealthy he is and how badly he feels he has been treated, without any self-awareness or understanding of what love is. He is pathetic and pitiful. Let’s sing the last three verses, which includes some language that sounds strangely modern, but I have not tinkered with the words – just a little with the spelling:\n\nLet’s sing the rest of the song now.\n\nVERSE FIFTEEN\n\nThou couldst desire no earthly thing, But still thou hadst it readily; Thy music still to play and sing, And yet thou wouldst not love me.\n\nCHORUS\n\nGreensleeves was all my joy, Greensleeves was my delight, Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who but Lady Greensleeves?\n\nVERSE SIXTEEN\n\nAnd who did pay for all this gear, That thou didst spend when pleased thee?\n\nEven I that am rejected here, And thou distainst to love me.\n\nCHORUS\n\nGreensleeves was all my joy, Greensleeves was my delight, Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who but Lady Greensleeves?\n\nVERSE SEVENTEEN\n\nWell, I will pray to God on high, That thou my constancy must see, And yet that once before I die, Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.\n\nOUTRO\n\nGreensleeves now farewell, adieu,\n\nGod I pray to prosper thee;\n\nFor I am still thy lover true,\n\nCome once again and love me.\n\nThe Famous Victories Of Henry V\n\nThe difficulties we have attributing authorship of Tudor works is not confined to songs. It also applies to many plays. As does the desire to leap to the conclusion that someone famous must have written any interesting piece.\n\nThere is a famous scene in Shakespeare’s Henry V in which the Dauphin has sent a sarcastic gift of tennis balls to the new monarch, which snowballs the plot, via regal anger, to the Battle of Agincourt and English victory.\n\nAn anonymous earlier play, “The Famous Victories of Henry V”, includes that exact plot line – indeed many of the plot lines that unfold in Shakespeare’s second Henriad – Henry IV Parts One and Two plus Henry V.\n\nThe Famous Victories was probably written c1583. It must have been written by/before 1588, as there are accounts of William Knell and Richard Tarlton appearing for Queen Elizabeth’s Men in this play; both of those actors died in 1588. The play was first entered in the Stationers’ register in 1594, while the earliest surviving version was published in 1598. Here is a link to a full transcript of the play.\n\nIn “The Famous Victories”, the ton of tennis balls story arises in a long, pivotal ninth scene, set at Westminster Abbey, just after the coronation of Henry V. King Henry rejects his old friends, including Sir John “Jockey” Oldcastle – the Falstaff character – then turns his attention to seeking the Archbishop of Canterbury and others’ counsel on seizing the French crown. Henry’s counsellors sound hawkish, before introducing the Archbishop of Bourges who has brought with him an offer of money, the hand of Princess Katherine (which Henry desired) and a gift from the Dauphin:\n\nARCHBISHOP: And it please your Maiestie,\n\nMy Lord Prince Dolphin greets you well,\n\nWith this present.\n\n[He deliuereth a Tunne of Tennis Balles.]\n\nHENRY 5: What a guilded Tunne? …\n\nI pray you my Lord of Yorke, looke what is in it?\n\nYORKE: And it please your Grace,\n\nHere is a Carpet and a Tunne of Tennis balles.\n\nHENRY 5: A Tunne of Tennis balles?\n\nI pray you good my Lord Archbishop,\n\nWhat might the meaning therof be?\n\nARCHBISHOP: And it please you my Lord,\n\nA messenger you know, ought to keepe close his message,\n\nAnd specially an Embassador.\n\nHENRY 5: But I know that you may declare your message …\n\nTo a king: the law of Armes allowes no lesse.\n\nARCHBISHOP: My Lord hearing of your wildnesse before your\n\nFathers death, sent you this my good Lord,\n\nMeaning that you are more fitter for a Tennis Court\n\nThen a field, and more fitter for a Carpet then the Camp.\n\nHENRY 5: My lord prince Dolphin is very pleasant with me:\n\nBut tel him, that in steed of balles of leather,\n\nWe wil tosse him balles of brasse and yron,\n\nYea such balles as neuer were tost in France,\n\nThe proudest Tennis Court shall rue it, …\n\nI, and thou Prince of Burges shall rue it.\n\nThis earlier play returns to the tennis ball motif several times later in the play. But in truth the dialogue is unexceptional. Shakespeare tackles the tennis ball story in Act One Scene 2 of Henry V, deploying his exceptionally rich command of language:\n\nFIRST AMBASSADOR\n\nThus, then, in few.\n\nYour highness, lately sending into France,\n\nDid claim some certain dukedoms, in the right\n\nOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.\n\nIn answer of which claim, the prince our master\n\nSays that you savour too much of your youth,\n\nAnd bids you be advised there’s nought in France\n\nThat can be with a nimble galliard won;\n\nYou cannot revel into dukedoms there.\n\nHe therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,\n\nThis tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,\n\nDesires you let the dukedoms that you claim\n\nHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.\n\nKING HENRY V: What treasure, uncle?\n\nEXETER: Tennis-balls, my liege.\n\nKING HENRY V: We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;\n\nHis present and your pains we thank you for:\n\nWhen we have march’d our rackets to these balls,\n\nWe will, in France, by God’s grace, play a set\n\nShall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.\n\nTell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler\n\nThat all the courts of France will be disturb’d\n\nWith chaces. And we understand him well,\n\nHow he comes o’er us with our wilder days,\n\nNot measuring what use we made of them.\n\nWe never valued this poor seat of England;\n\nAnd therefore, living hence, did give ourself\n\nTo barbarous licence; as ’tis ever common\n\nThat men are merriest when they are from home.\n\nBut tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,\n\nBe like a king and show my sail of greatness\n\nWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:\n\nFor that I have laid by my majesty\n\nAnd plodded like a man for working-days,\n\nBut I will rise there with so full a glory\n\nThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,\n\nYea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.\n\nAnd tell the pleasant prince this mock of his\n\nHath turn’d his balls to gun-stones; and his soul\n\nShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance\n\nThat shall fly with them…\n\nScary.\n\nIn the Famous Victories play, at the end of Scene 12, King Henry reprises his verbal volleys about the tennis balls [did you see what I did there?], ahead of a rather corny Scene 13 in which French soldiers talk incomprehensibly in mock French.\n\nIn Shakespeare’s Henry V Act 4, Scene 4, Pistol encounters a surrendering French soldier:\n\nPISTOL Yield, cur.\n\nFRENCH SOLDIER Je pense que vous êtes le gentilhomme\n\nde bonne qualité.\n\nPISTOL Qualtitie calmie custure me. Art thou a gentleman?\n\nWhat is thy name? Discuss.\n\nFRENCH SOLDIER Ô Seigneur Dieu!\n\nPISTOL O, Seigneur Dew should be a gentleman. Perpend\n\nmy words, O Seigneur Dew, and mark: O Seigneur Dew, thou diest on point of fox, except, O Seigneur, thou do give to me egregious ransom.\n\nFRENCH SOLDIER Ô, prenez miséricorde! Ayez pitié de\n\nmoi!\n\nPISTOL Moy shall not serve…\n\nI’m glad to report, following several further rounds of corny misunderstanding, that Pistol spares the poor French soldier for the modest fee of 200 gold coins.\n\nThe nonsense phrase that Pistol utters is a reference to another hugely popular tune and song of the late Elizabethan era, Caleno Custure Me. Another song steeped in mystery and evidence-free theories, as analysed debunked and transformed into sensible analysis by Ian Pittaway here or below.\n\nCaleno Custure Me was first registered at Stationer’s Register in 1582 but the earliest surviving version, like Greensleeves, is in A Handful of Pleasant Delights. It’s quite a lengthy song if you sing all the verses – this abbreviated version works well. Feel free to join in the Caleno Custere Me lines once you get the hang of this simple but charming tune.\n\nVERSE ONE\n\nWhen as I view your comely grace, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nYour golden hair, your angel’s face, Caleno Custure Me.\n\nVERSE TWO\n\nWith in myself then I can say, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nThe night is gone, behold the day, Caleno Custure Me.\n\nVERSE THREE\n\nThen how dare I with boldened face, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nPresume to crave or wish your grace? Caleno Custure Me.\n\nVERSE FOUR\n\nAnd thus amazed as I stand, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nNot feeling sense, nor moving hand. Caleno Custure Me.\n\nVERSE FIVE\n\nMy soul with silence moving sense, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nDoth wish for thee with reverence. Caleno Custure Me.\n\nVERSE SIX\n\nLong life, and virtue you possess:, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nTo match those gifts of worthiness. Caleno Custure Me.\n\nREPRISE\n\nWhen as I view your comely grace, Caleno Custure Me;\n\nYour golden hair, your angel’s face, Caleno Custure Me.\n\nTheatrical Performance At Hampton Court Palace\n\nBefore we move on to the only Shakespeare play that has a discernible Gresham connection, mentions tennis and has a music element for us to enjoy, I’d like to explore the notion that Hampton Court Palace hosted theatrical performances in Elizabethan times.\n\nIt is well documented that Shakespeare and The King’s Men (formerly The Lord Chamberlains Men) performed at least half-a-dozen plays at Hampton Court Palace over the Christmas & New Years period of 1603-1604. Queen Elisabeth had died earlier in 1603. By then the Tudor period was over.\n\nI knew that troupes of players had put on Court performances in Elizabethan times and suspected that the idea of such performances in the Great Hall at Hampton Court Palace would not have been brand new in Christmas 1603.\n\nCould I find evidence of theatrical performance at Hampton Court Palace in Elizabethan times?\n\nMy cursory searches drew a blank. I decided to consult Chat GPT on the matter. I won’t bother you with the largely nonsensical answers that the automaton tried out on me. But it did suggest that I seek advice on sources from experts in the history of Hampton Court Palace and suggested one sources itself: Philip Henslowe‘s diary.\n\nPossibly I should have thought of that source myself. Philip Henslowe was father-in-law to actor-manager Edward Alleyn and I am an alum of Alleyn’s School. But I thought of that diary as a Jacobean artefact and I hadn’t twigged that Henslowe started keeping his records in 1591.\n\nThe evidence I was hoping for still took some finding, but an Edwardian analysis of the diary, Diary of Philip Henslowe, W W Greg, A.H. Bullen, 1904, references an Act of the Privy Council on 7 March 1592/93 (Volume 24, p102):\n\nThirty quid was a splendid haul for a three night gig in those days. Three pounds in takings for a night at The Rose Theatre was close to a top.\n\nAs for additional research materials, I must thank Lesley Ronaldson, Sarah Slater and Sandy Rhodes at Hampton Court Palace for their help in digging out sources and information for me. Several of the sources listed in the appendix below are thanks to them.\n\nThe early 1590s was a confused and confusing time for the theatrical companies. The Earl of Leicester’s Men had been disbanded soon after Leicester’s death in late 1588. Bubonic plague caused considerable disruption in 1592 and even more so in 1593. Companies were merging and cross-fertilising with each other just to survive. In late 1592 Lord Strange’s Men and The Admiral’s Men were united under Henslowe’s management.\n\nWe don’t know which plays Lord Strange’s men put on at Hampton Court Palace that Christmas of 1592/3, but we do know from Philip Henslowe’s diaries that their repertoire over that disrupted period mostly comprised:\n\nTamburlaine The Great & The Jew Of Malta by Christopher Marlowe;\n\nA Knack to Know a Knave by Anon;\n\na lost play about Sir John Mandeville;\n\nJeronimo (aka The Spanish Tragedy) by Thomas Kyd;\n\nHenry VI (part of parts unspecified) by William Shakespeare.\n\nThe 1592 revels at Hampton Court Palace almost certainly will have starred Richard Burbage and William Kempe, who both joined Lord Strange’s Men in 1592 plus Edward Alleyn, who married Henslowe’s daughter that year. It is even possible that William Shakespeare performed in that season, but his role with Henslowe’s companies at that time is undocumented and unclear.\n\nThomas Gresham, Tennis, Hamlet & Walsingham\n\nNeither do we know which plays were put on at Hampton Court Palace by Shakespeare’s lot for the new King James Christmas 1603. But there is a strong suspicion that Hamlet would have been one of them. It was new at the time and might well have seemed pertinent to the newly-succeeded King and his Danish Queen.\n\nThose of you who endured my lockdown webinar about tennis around the time of Thomas Gresham – still available by clicking here or below:\n\n…might recall that the only reference to tennis in any biography of Sir Thomas Gresham refers to 1561 correspondence from Sir William Cecil, whose son, Thomas, took sanctuary at Thomas Gresham’s place in Antwerp having got himself into a spot of bother in Paris.\n\n“I see, in the end,” said the disapproving father in a letter to the errant youth’s tutor, Windebank on 4 November 1561, “my sone shall come home lyke a spendyng sott, mete to kepe a tenniss court.”\n\nCecil was not referring to a grand court like that at Hampton Court Palace, of course, nor even to the more modest (yet still quite grand) court in his own home on The Strand. He was referring to the lowly tavern and gambling den sort of tennis court, for which trades folk sought (but were often denied) licences.\n\nThe really intriguing thing about that footnote of a story is that it found its way, some 40 years later, into a sub-plot in Hamlet. I spent some time in my 2020 Gresham piece exploring some of the wilder theories on this topic, not least the notion that Edward de Vere or John Florio might have written Shakespeare’s works.\n\nAs I said in that piece:\n\nWhat is widely believed and is almost certainly true is that the character of Polonius in Hamlet was based on William Cecil and the character of Laertes, Polonius’s ne’er-do-well son abroad, based on the young Thomas Cecil. Scholars have suggested the Cecil connection for a great many reasons. For our purposes, Act Two Scene One of Hamlet has the sole mention of tennis in Hamlet, in a context that is reminiscent of the sole mention of tennis in Thomas Gresham’s biographies.\n\nThere are other clues to Polonius being based William Cecil. In Act One Scene Three, Polonius sets out “a few precepts” for Laertes ahead of his travels – for all the good they did in the matter of encouraging Laertes to behave himself. William Cecil wrote a treatise of precepts “to his son”, which was published subsequent to Hamlet but its existence would almost certainly have been known to the same insiders whose gossip about the Cecil family was in Shakespeare’s orbit.\n\nWhile William Cecil’s daughter, Anne, did not have an entirely Ophelia-like story, she did have a tempestuous marriage/relationship with Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford and she did die tragically young.\n\nOphelia sings several songs in Act 4 Scene 5, known as “Ophelia’s mad scene”. The first of those songs, “How Should I Your True Love Know” is based on an Elizabethan ballad tune, Walsingham. The tune is by our old friend, Anon, the origins of the tune and various lyrics steeped in mystery.\n\nHere is a relatively simple lute version of that tune:\n\nThe root lyric is believed to be this couplet:\n\nAs I went to Walsingham, to the shrine with speed\n\nMet I with a jolly palmer, in a pilgrim’s weed\n\nThe Walsingham lyric, from there, in its various versions, takes the form of dialogue between pilgrims, one seeking their missing loved one and the other responding.\n\nHOW SHOULD I YOUR TRUE LOVE KNOW?\n\nLet’s have a go at the song, using the Ophelia lyrics from Hamlet, but rather than having Ophelia in her derangement sing both parts, we’ll try the question and response as a duet:\n\nOPHELIA: ‘As you came from the holy land of Walsingham\n\nMet you not with my true love by the way you came?’\n\nPALMER: ‘How should I your true love know from another one?’\n\nOPHELIA: ‘By his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon’\n\nPALMER: ‘He is dead and gone, lady, he is dead and gone\n\nAt his head a grass green turf, at his heels a stone\n\n‘White his shroud as the mountain snow, larded with sweet flow’rs\n\nWhich bewept to the grave did go with true love showers’\n\nI must say, if that’s what a jolly palmer sounds like, I’m glad I have never met with a miserable palmer.\n\nBecause Walsingham was a popular pilgrimage site until the monasteries were disestablished in the 1530s, some music historians assumed the song to be early Tudor. But there is no evidence of the tune until the late Tudor period, at which time many major composers had a go at producing versions and variations on the tune.\n\nWilliam Byrd produced a piece for virginals (keyboard), 22 Variations entitled “Have with Yow to Walsingame”.\n\nNot to be outdone, John Bull (who was the first Gresham Professor of Music), produced 30 Variations on Walsingham.\n\nJohn Dowland had a modest go at a version of the tune for the lute…\n\nThe on-line transcription of my blog has links to good recordings of those several instrumental versions.\n\nRather than inundate you with variations and versions of Walsingham, we’d like to close with three pieces, one example by each of those three composers, all three relevant to today’s event.\n\nWilliam Byrd – Earl Of Salisbury Pavan\n\nWhile William Cecil, Thomas Cecil and Anne Cecil all found their way into a tennis-related subplot of Hamlet, one famous member of the Cecil family, Robert Cecil, was omitted. Robert Cecil was a powerful man even before his father’s death in 1598, at which point he took over from his late father as Lord Privy Seal. His power and status increased under James 1st, ennobled in James’s accession year and made Earl of Salisbury in 1605.\n\nThe story goes that Salisbury protected William Byrd when threatened with eviction from his home at Stondon Massey.\n\nWhether that story is true and whether it was for that reason that Byrd dedicated this pavan to the Earl of Salisbury we’ll never know, but the piece is very charming and beautiful nonetheless, on pretty much any instrument. As one further tennis connection, by the way, one of the Earl of Salisbury’s grand homes, Hatfield House, today houses a rather splendid real tennis court.\n\nWilliam Byrd’s domestic difficulties were probably connected with his recusant Catholicism, or at least his patronage by people, such as the Petre family in neighbouring Ingatestone, who were notable recusants.\n\nJohn Bull – Dr Bull’s My Selfe\n\nJohn Bull, the first Gresham professor of music, claimed similar persecution for his beliefs, when he fled England, for Flanders, in 1613, although it seems far more likely that his misdemeanours were carnal rather than theological. Sadly much of Bull’s music was lost or fliched by other composers when he fled, although we do still have his wonderful Walsingham variations, some extraordinary canons, the suggestion that he might well have written the national anthem, plus a splendid little piece known as Dr Bull’s My Selfe, a piece dedicated to his favourite person – a very early example of a selfie – in this case a musical one.\n\nJohn Bull had a naughty boy track record from the outset as Gresham Professor of Music. He was indicted for criminal damage at Gresham House soon after taking up his Gresham College chair in 1597. We do not know the outcome to that case.\n\nWe do know that he was required to give up his chair in 1607, most likely on the grounds that he had to get married in a hurry, just a couple of weeks before his eventual bride gave birth.\n\nHis flight to Flanders six years after that appears to be a result of incurring the wrath of George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, this time with Bull having been accused of adulty. Abbot had recently said of Bull:\n\n“the man hath more music than honesty and is as famous for marring of virginity as he is for fingering of organs and virginals.”\n\nLet us put to one side the Archbishop’s unfortunate choice of words to modern ears. It does seem that John Bull found it hard to “keep himselfie to himselfie”.\n\nI am probably over-using my imagination when I listen to Dr Bull’s My Selfe, but I envisage Bull using this short piece as his theme tune at the start of each of his Gresham Lectures. It has a theme tune ring to it.\n\nJohn Dowland – Now Oh Now I Needs Must Part (The Frog Galliard)\n\nLegend has it that John Dowland was mightily miffed when his application to be lutenist to the court of Queen Elizabeth was turned down in 1594. So he might well have been similarly miffed when John Bull was selected to be the first Gresham professor of music ahead of Dowland in 1597. The following year Dowland took up a highly-paid post at the Court of Christian IV of Denmark, who subsequently also took on John Bull in the latter’s flee to Europe years.\n\nDowland is said to have believed that it was his recusant religious beliefs that stood in his way with Queen Elizabeth, but that particular matter did not seem to hold back several other performing arts types.\n\nMore likely it was because the Queen liked upbeat performance pieces and upbeat performers. Dowland was reputedly downbeat in character and is best known for his melancholy songs, with titles such as “Flow my tears”, “I saw my Lady weepe” and “In darkness let me dwell”.\n\nDowland’s first book of songs came out in the Gresham College inaugural year, 1597. Now Oh Now I Needs Must Part, from that book, is a personal favourite of mine.\n\nThe instrumental version is known as The Frog Galliard for reasons rumoured to be connected with one of Queen Elizabeth’s suitors, François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon, whom she referred to as “her Frog”.\n\nCoincidentally, François, Duke of Anjou, the youngest son of Henry II of France, was named after his late uncle François, Duke of Brittany, a Dauphin who died in mysterious circumstances in 1536 following refreshments after a rigorous game of tennis “pré[s] d’Ainay“. This is yet one more example of a great French tradition of regal deaths in the aftermath of tennis, going back as far as the untimely demise of Louis X “The Quarrelsome” in 1316, as reported in several of my earlier pieces on tennis e.g. Horrible Histories.\n\nAlso coincidentally, the courtly intrigue surrounding the potential match between Queen Elisabeth and François “The Frog”, which played out for some five years between 1574 and 1579, seems to have kicked off in the immediate aftermath of one of The Queen’s visits to Thomas Gresham at Osterley, in February 1574:\n\nFeb 18,Thur OSTERLEY, Middlesex; Sir Thomas Gresham.\n\nCourt news. Feb 20, La Mothe [French ambassador Bertrand de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon] to Catherine de Medici [François, Duke of Anjou’s mum]:\n\n“Francis Walsingham told me he had never seen the Queen so well disposed to marriage as at present, and he thought everything could be accomplished by a private interview. He said the Duke should regard the Queen’s heart as a strong castle which he might boldly carry by storm. He would lend any assistance in his power.”\n\nFeb 20,Sat HAMPTON COURT.\n\nOn February 20 two Revels Officers hired ‘two geldings to Osterley and to Hampton Court to know my Lord Chamberlain’s pleasure, and back again to St John’s’. St John’s Clerkenwell, the Revels Office.\n\n“The Elizabethan Court Day by Day” by Marion E. Colthorpe, licensed under an Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. 1574.\n\nIt seems that Thomas Gresham was not averse to a bit of theatre. In the above instance, presumably lending or giving some props to the revels. On at least one occasion it is documented that Gresham hosted theatrical entertainments at Osterley.\n\nOn one occasion [at Osterley]]there was a play by Thomas Churchyard, who wrote entertainments in the 1570s for several of the Queen’s progresses, as at Bristol and Norwich.\n\nIn Churchyard’s Challenge (1593) he lists his printed works, but without dates.\n\nOne item is: ‘The devices of war and a play at Osterley, her Highness being at Sir Thomas Gresham’s’. The play is not extant.\n\n“The Elizabethan Court Day by Day” by Marion E. Colthorpe, licensed under an Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license. 1576.\n\nReturning to Now Oh Now I Needs Must Part/The Frog Galliard, while the song and tune has no known connection with Shakespeare, when I appeared in and helped produce Twelfth Night at Alleyn’s School 45 years ago, our Deputy Headmaster/Director, John “Squeaky” Newton, insisted on us using this song/tune as a theme for the production. This piece has long had a place in my heart and makes a suitable closing number.\n\nVERSE ONE\n\nNow, O now, I needs must part, Parting though I absent mourn. Absence can no joy impart Joy once fled cannot return.\n\nWhile I live I needs must love, Love lives not when Hope is gone. Now at last Despair doth prove, Love divided loveth none.\n\nSad despair doth drive me hence, This despair unkindness sends. If that parting be offence, It is she which then offends.\n\nVERSE TWO\n\nDear, when I am from thee gone, Gone are all my joys at once. I loved thee and thee alone, In whose love I joyed once.\n\nAnd although your sight I leave, Sight wherein my joys do lie, Till that death do sense bereave, Never shall affection die.\n\nSad despair doth drive me hence, This despair unkindness sends. If that parting be offence, It is she which then offends.\n\nVERSE THREE\n\nDear if I do not return Love and I shall die together, For my absence never mourn, Whom you might have joyed ever.\n\nPart we must, though now I die. Die I do to part with you. Him despair doth cause to lie, Who both lived and died true.\n\nSad despair doth drive me hence, This despair unkindness sends.

The Duke of Burgundy, according to an old historian , having lost sixty franks at palm play with the Duke of Bourbon , Messire William de Lyon , and Messire Guy de la Trimouille, and not having money enough to pay them, gave his girdle as a pledge for the remainder; and shortly afterwards he left the same girdle with the comte D ‘ Eu for eighty franks, which he also lost at tennis.”\n\n[The reference in Strutt simply reads “Laboureur, sub an. 1368”.]\n\nI wanted to find out more about this 14th century loser of a Duke.\n\nI quickly and easily found out that the Duke in question was Philip The Bold, the youngest brother of Charles V, otherwise known as Charles the Wise.\n\nDespite the pathetic image conjured by the girdle adage, Philip The Bold was no loser. Heralded for his bravery in battle, he became the most influential French nobleman of his period.\n\nFurther, as I shall argue in this immersive presentation, his activities had seminal and lasting effects on worlds as diverse as wine, tennis and music. But evidence to support such arguments is hard to come by for a period as early as the 14th century.\n\nWe really only have three contemporary types of information source. Chronicles [e.g. The Chronicles of Jean Froissart] which record major events and edicts. These tend to tell us that major events happened, with scant evidence about how they happened and almost nothing on activities such as tennis and music.\n\nSecondly, the account books of noble households which provide circumstantial evidence of how activities might have been undertaken. My story will be relying quite a bit on those.\n\nThe third type of source, more open to interpretation than the other two, comes from poets and lyricists of that period. We have a few fascinating and amusing pieces of this kind for Philip the Bold’s story.\n\nA Potted History Of Philip The Bold’s Life\n\nPhilip was born in 1342, the youngest son of John The Good, who become King of France in 1350. Philip joined with his father in 1356 in the Battle of Poitiers, a couple of decades into The Hundred Years War, where both were taken prisoner and removed to England.\n\nPhilip remained a gilded prisoner in England between 1356 and 1360, thus spending the best of his teenage years in captivity and helping to establish the tradition of English residential secondary education resembling a prisoner of war camp. More seriously, there are contemporary accounts of Philip playing chess with his captor, The Black Prince (Prince Edward of Woodstock), but sadly there is nothing in the chronicles connecting Philip with wine, tennis or music during his period in captivity – they don’t even report the chess match results.\n\nPhilip’s mother, Bonne of Luxembourg, had been a great patron of the arts, before her untimely death in 1349 of plague.\n\nWhen, in 1360, the 18-year-old Philip returned from captivity to the Valois court in Paris, Guillaume de Machaut, one of the most important composer-poets of the 14th century, who had been one of Bonne’s favourites, was still a frequent guest of the royal household, certainly until the death of King John the Good some four years later.\n\nDouce Dame Jolie by Guillaume de Machaut\n\nThe structure of the song is a virelai. The subject matter is fin’amor – often now referred to as courtly love – unrequited love directed towards a perfect, unattainable woman – the singer eventually pleads for his lover to kill him as a mercy to end his torment. Typical.\n\nI performed this one mostly acapella with a short instrumental intro and accompanied outro.\n\nHere is a rather beautiful instrumental version of the piece:\n\nWhile here is Theo Bleckmann singing the song beautifully with electronic backing which should not be mistaken for traditional 14th century accompaniment:\n\nA Potted History Of Philip The Bold’s Life (Continued)\n\nIn 1361 the 15-year-old Duke of Burgundy, Philip of Rouvres died, probably of plague, which meant that the Burgundy Dukedom technically reverted to the Kingdom of France. In 1363, John The Good, soon before he also died, secretly conferred the Burgundian Dukedom to Philip. In 1364, Philip’s older brother, now King Charles V, officially invested Burgundy upon Phillip.\n\nThus Philip was a 26-year-old single Duke at the time of the reported 1368 tennis-girdle incident.\n\nIn 1369 Philip married Margaret of Flanders which lined Philip up for a much-expanded Dukedom once Louis of Male, Count of Flanders, died, in 1384.\n\nFour years earlier, In 1380, Charles V died, leaving 11-year-old Charles VI King of France. Three Dukes shared the regency until the youngster reached majority. Philip was the youngest of those three Dukes, but neither Louis, Duke of Anjou nor John, Duke of Berry were particularly interested in governing France, leaving Philip The Bold as de facto regent.\n\nIn 1388 Charles VI claimed the throne, but within four years was regularly in the throes of violent mental illness, such that a more tentative, disputed regency was in play for most of the rest of Philip the Bold’s life, which ended in 1404 following a flu-like or covid-like respiratory illness.\n\nEvidence Of Expenditure On Tennis & Music\n\nReturning to the search for evidence of Philip’s tennis playing, one of the on-line sources – is the 1888 book “Itineraries of Philip the Bold and John the Fearless, Dukes of Burgundy, 1363-1419, according to the expense accounts of their hotel. Collected and put in order by Ernest Petit”. On p475, we find the so-called girdle accounts, recorded as May 1368. My translation:\n\n“On folio 3 1 of the same account, Monseigneur le Duc, having lost sixty pounds in tennis, gave his belt as a pledge for the said sum to the Duc de Bourbon, Guy de la Trémouille and others, who had won it from him.\n\n“Fol. 9-3 from the same account. The duke’s belt is still given as a pledge to the Comte d’Eu for eighty francs which he had lost with him in tennis.”\n\nLeaving a belt as surety at least sounds a little more dignified than leaving a girdle. It also has a more “sporting trophy” sound to it.\n\nThere are several references to tennis and dice losses in the expense accounts for the period when Philip was in residence in Saumur on a military campaign in 1372. On that sequence of occasions, it seems the Duke was not required to leave any clothing as surety but he took pains to seek to return and settle his debts. [This sequence is charmingly written up on-line on the Les Portes Du Temps website.]\n\nAnother fascinating reference, cited in Music at the Court of Burgundy 1364-1419 A Documentary History by Craig Wright, from the account books of 1378, shows Philip presenting Jean De Dinnat with a silver belt worth 29 francs and then 1379 with 10 francs for beating him at tennis. Jean de Dinnant was one of Philip’s favourite musicians who accompanied him at times on his travels. Still, it is most unusual to find an accounted example of a nobleman playing tennis with a minstrel. This unusual transaction makes me wonder whether the 29 franc belt might have previously been mortgaged a few times.\n\nWhat we do know for sure, as reported by Wright and others interested in the history of music in Burgundy at that time, is that Philip ran up huge expenditures by the standards of his time, sending his minstrels around the music schools in France and abroad – certainly in the period 1378 to 1394, with large payments for musicians travel and instruments recorded many times in the household accounts.\n\nPhilip was not the first and not the only French/European noble to do this sort of thing in the 14th century. His parents had been great patrons of the arts, as was to some extent, Edward III of England, whose household accounts show him sending minstrels “across the seas, to learn new songs”, as early as 1335.\n\nBut a concerted bout of international minstrel schooling seems to have been triggered by the Bruges peace conferences of 1375 & 1376, brokered between Philip The Bold and his recent adversary at war, John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster. One of the few conclusive results of those peace conferences was exchanges of minstrels; Gautier l’Anglais remained in Philip’s employ for several years, while several of Philip’s minstrels travelled to England with John of Gaunt’s retinue.\n\nGaunt, was, like Philip, a princely patron of arts, known as “King of the Minstrels” in the Minstrels’ Court, a form of trade guild centred on Tutbury Castle, where the apprenticeship of minstrels was organised in late 14th century England.\n\nSong Two: Puis Que Je Suy Amoureux, attributed Richard Loqueville\n\nAttributed to Richard Loqueville – a harper and teacher at Cambrai;\n\nA rondeau in form;\n\nAnother unrequited love song – in this one the singer hopes for just one glance from his beloved. Typical;\n\nPerforms well either as a harp/gittern instrumental or song.\n\nI performed this one as a short instrumental. There is a beautiful recording of this as a harp instrumental performed by Andrew Lawrence King – still available for purchase/download here.\n\nBelow is a beautiful rendition of the song by Asteria.\n\nWithout question Philip the Bold went large on employing musicians towards the end of his life. When his father-in-law Louis, Count of Flanders, died, Philip retained the entire Flanders collection of musicians along with his own to create probably the largest payroll of musicians anywhere at that time. His prior collection was made up primarily of minstrels, but the collection Philip acquired on the death of Louis of Flanders included a substantial chapel as well as minstrels. The burgeoning importance of the music school at Cambrai in the late 14th and early 15th century was largely attributable to Philip The Bold’s investment in musicians.\n\nWe don’t know for sure what types of music specifically Philip The Bold favoured but we do know that Phillip’s library, towards the end of his life and posthumously, was well stocked with Guillaume de Machaut’s work. Machaut, unlike many of the lyric poets who followed him, was very much a composer of music as well as a poet.\n\nOne of Machaut’s most famous pupils was Eustache Deschamps, a prolific lyric-poet otherwise known as Morel. Deschamps was a contemporary of Philip The Bold. Deschamps’s estates in Champagne had been ransacked by the English, probably under the auspices of John of Gaunt. Unsurprisingly, Deschamps writes disdainfully about the English generally. He was, however, fond of Geoffrey Chaucer, another contemporary of these chaps, such that Deschamps wrote a tribute to Chaucer lauding his work.\n\nIn the 14th century there was no real distinction between lyricists and poets. Much of Deschamps’s canon is written in lyrical forms such as virelays and rondeaus that make it hard to imagine that those poems were not intended to be sung. However, many of Deschamps’s ballad poems, including those that mention Philip the Bold and tennis, were probably intended for recitation, not song.\n\nPhilip the Bold is mentioned in far from flattering terms in a couple of Deschamps’ poems. The poem “Ordre de la Baboue” describes an imaginary drinking club of unsightly looking people who are members of Philip the Bold’s household.\n\nMore interesting is the Dit du Gieu des Dez, The Ballad Of The Dice Game, (1395), in which Deschamps imagines a drunken drinking and dice session at the Hotel de Nesle, the Duke of Berry’s Paris mansion – in which Philip the Bold together with his host & the Duke of Bourbon enjoy a night of excess and ribaldry.\n\nThe Hotel de Nesle was the location of a very early indoor tennis court, built by Philip The Fair around 1300 for his son Louis, latterly Louis X, the Quarrelsome, who famously died in the aftermath of a game of tennis, possibly drunk, possibly murdered or possibly both.\n\nIt is clear from Deschmaps and other medieval sources that an entertainment and gambling session would often have begun with the rigours of tennis and then, to continue gambling, turned to drinking and playing dice.\n\nOn similar themes, an earlier, 1372 Deschamps poem, The Charter of Good Youths of Vertus in Champagne, is a satirical ballad, set in Deschamps’s home town of Vertus, explaining how to live a “good life”. This ballad mentions tennis a couple of times. I shall recite a couple of dozen lines from this relatively long poem (more than 250 lines), sometimes swapping strict meaning to allow the English language version to follow the lyrical and satirical quality of the Medieval French.\n\nThe king of the hedonists,\n\nLived the long life of a dedanist;\n\nDeep inside a tavern in Vertus,\n\nBadly dressed, yet virtuous;\n\nTo all the young in the town,\n\nWho habitually would come on down;\n\nSaying “cheers”, while following this charter faithfully,\n\nWhich I shall now report to you thoughtfully and gracefully.\n\nFirst, as soon as we rise, whatever the time,\n\nLet’s refresh our mouths with the best and most expensive wine;\n\nFrom dawn until dusk, without leaving or pausing for food,\n\nAs none of that would do us any good.\n\nAssign the bill, no-one’s entitled to force it,\n\nHe who gripes or tinkers should pay double as forfeit;\n\nGrandiose talk might turn out to be wisest,\n\nTrading in goods might be done in many guises;\n\nGames of tennis and dice often need arbitration,\n\nAgree peacefully – indoors – in the court of libation.\n\n…\n\nServe yourselves grandly and serve yourselves lazily,\n\nNever care to work – people kill themselves ploughing crazily;\n\nPlay dice and tennis on sloping roofs or on thatch,\n\nTo exercise within – but if you must go out – find a match;\n\nIn women’s cloisters or communes or village communities…\n\n[…followed by another 160 lines of bawdy verse, which no amount of trigger warnings or woke translation could repair for 21st century ears]\n\nPhilip The Bold & The Grapes Of Wrath (Pinot Noir v Gamay)\n\nThose mentions of wine bring me to the third aspect of Philip The Bold’s legacy which I’m keen to discuss with you.\n\nOn 31 July 1395 Philip The Bold made a solemn decree about wine, banning the Gamay grape from Burgundy, insisting that the traditional, high-quality, low-yield grape, pinot noir, be restored to its rightful place in Burgundian vineyards. [The whole text of the ordinance can be found on-line in many places, including the source linked here.] Here is a loosely translated extract from the ordinance, in which Philip objects to the planting of:\n\n“a very bad and treacherous variety of grape called Gameez, which produces abundant quantities of wine; and to allow the greater production of this bad wine they have left in a ruinous state good places where the best sort of grapes might be grown. Wine from Gameez is the type of wine that is extremely harmful to human beings, to the extent that, we are reliably informed, many people who previously partook of this wine were infested by serious diseases, because such wine from grapes of that nature is infused with much foul and horrible bitterness. For these reasons we solemnly command all who have said Gameez vines to cut them down or have them cut down, wherever they may be in our country, within five months.”\n\nThe ordinance goes on to stipulate and restrict other agricultural practices for Burgundy. It is a seminally comprehensive and prescriptive state decree on food and/or wine standards. It’s context was almost certainly the aftermath of the plague, which would have hit Burgundian wine-growers badly, both in terms of massively reduced manpower to produce fine wines from a difficult grape such as pinot noir and a reduced wider market for Burgundy’s fine wines. The Gamay grape – a cross-breed between Pinot Noir and a despised, peasant-variety, Gouais, does indeed grow abundantly compared with its high-falutin’ parent grape. Intriguingly, the Chardonnay grape is also a cross-breed between Pinot and Gouais, yet the white cross-breed latterly found favour for the fine white wines of Burgundy.\n\nThe decree was not popular at the time. The farmers were suffering and the abundant production of Gamay was saving their livelihoods and those of the wine merchants. The town council in Dijon that August voted that the ordinance was a breach of their privileges, thus rejecting it. Philip the Bold had the Mayor imprisoned and replaced. Also several councillors were fined as a result of that impertinence. When Philip made a decree he really meant it.\n\nThe agrarian crisis that led to the decree and followed from it is well-documented, including a fascinating 1982 academic piece The “Disloyal” Grape: The Agrarian Crisis of Late Fourteenth-Century Burgundy by Rosalind Kent Berlow, and a more folksy article summarising the topic by Rupert Millar on thedrinksbusiness.com is available on-line here. Further, as Ben O’Donnell points out in The Exile of Burgundy on winespectator.com, Philip did not go so far as to implement his decree in Beaujolais, which he perhaps saw as a lesser, rural backwater in any case. There the Gamay continued to be planted and wines produced from it, as they are still in Beaujolais.\n\n[ANNOUNCE MINI WINE TASTING BEFORE RETURNING BRIEFLY TO MUSIC – the wine samples were served during the remainder of the session]\n\nBurgundian Music & Tennis Reprise\n\nTowards the end of Philip’s life, a very young Guillaume Dufay was taken to Cambrai by his mother, where he joined the chapel as a choirboy. Little is known of Dufay’s formative years at Cambrai, but he no doubt have studied under several of the Burundian-sponsored masters and benefitted from the many conventions of musicians for which Cambrai became famous at that time. Parenthetically, there is a beautiful picture in a Cambrai book of hours, dated c1300, of monks playing jeu de paume (see below…or click this link to see many of the stunning images from that Book of Hours).\n\nDufay lived a long life and his compositions are seen as central to the Burgundian School’s importance in the development of music from Medieval Ars Nova into Renaissance music. This song, probably from early in Dufay’s life, is a rondeau in the ars nova style popular towards the end of Philip The Bold’s life. It would have been close to the top of the medieval charts for several of the early 1400s decades. Unlike the fin’amor love song I sang earlier, this song is a lament for leaving behind a beloved place, along with, no doubt, loved ones in that place.\n\nAdieu Ces Bon Vins De Lannoy by Guillaume Dufay\n\nAnother rondeau, said to be inspired by Loqueville’s style, as Dufay would have studied under him.\n\nI performed this song acapella.\n\nHere are Asteria again, with a lovely accompanied rendition of this song.\n\nBy the end of Dufay’s life, in 1474, the Valois-Ducal-Burgundian line was almost at an end. Charles The Bold died at the Battle of Nancy in 1477 leaving no male issue. His daughter, Mary of Burgundy, Philip The Bold’s great, great granddaughter, married Maximillian I, ending the Valois dynasty, joining its remainder with the Habsburg dynasty. The Burgundian lands soon reverted to France, but by that time tennis had become more firmly established as a grand game for nobles as well as a smaller-scale town and tavern game for the middling sort.\n\nAs for music, the cross-fertilisation of music styles between the burgeoning Burgundian School and emerging techniques from England (John Dunstable’s influence was overtly recognised by Burgundian musicians) led to the development of multi-part polyphony based on triads and chords which we now consider central to Western music and which are seen musically as the transition from Medieval to Renaissance music.\n\nMy closing number is another lament to a place – Innsbruck – written by Heinrich Isaac, probably in the middle of the 1480s, when he was employed there by the Habsburg Archduke Sigismund. This piece is sometimes misattributed to Maximillian I which is as likely as the attribution of Greensleeves to Henry VIII – i.e. utterly implausible.\n\nInnsbruck Ich Muss Dich Lassen\n\nHere is a recording of my first (2017) attempt at this song for The Gresham Society.\n\nNearly five years later, I think I’m a little bit better at making music, which is more than can be said for my tennis. The following video is a good example of the full four parts Isaac wrote for this song:\n\nIn many ways Philip’s wine & music legacies are more evidentially direct, but his influence on the progress of tennis is, arguably, just as seminal and lasting. We learn from Jean-Michel Mehl, Les Jeux Au Royaume de France, 1998 that:\n\n“in 1385, Philippe le Hardi had made, in his hotel in Arras, “a pavement of thirty feet of stone to play tennis with palms. Without doubt, this tennis court was still used by Philip the Good.”\n\nThe last overt reference to tennis in the accounts of Philip’s household, according to Petit, was in 1390:\n\n“On 10th of March, the duke donated to the lady of Suilly, a clasp of gold, garnished with four brooms and eight large pearls to three children playing tennis, shining, to the value of 180 gold francs. (Letter to the Duke, dated Rouvre 10 March)”\n\nHere we see an older Philip sponsoring things he found beautiful, although whether the donation was primarily for the woman or primarily for the young tennis stars we’ll never know. But Philip was, repeatedly, a generous sponsor of things he liked and wanted to encourage. I warm to that aspect of him. I also share his love for wine, tennis and music.\n\nMini Wine Tasting\n\nWine One: Morgon La Chanaise 2020, Dominique Piron – Cru Beajolais – Gamay – Price range £12 to £16 per bottle\n\nWine Two: Les Pierres Rouges Bourgogne 2020, Louis Jadot – Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée – Pinot Noir – Price range £14 to £18 per bottle\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI’d especially like to thank my friend, Gresham Society colleague and linguist Professor Tim Connell, who has helped me with translation of several Deschamps poems. One fascinating aspect of working through these poems is how open to interpretation some of the material is. I have most certainly taken liberties with some of Tim’s diligent translation, substituting an attempt to emulate the lyrical and satirical rhythm of the work at the expense of strict meaning/translation.\n\nAlso with grateful thanks to my early music tutor, Ian Pittaway, whose patient tutelage on both the music history and the techniques of medieval music-making can only be explained by his depth of knowledge and sense of humour.\n\nThanks also to my wife, Janie, for tolerating my incessant tapping at the keyboard, plucking at the guitar strings and warbling of the songs, regardless of whatever else might have been on the agenda these past few weeks.\n\nFurther Reading & References\n\nIan Harris’s Ogblog Tetralogy On The Origins Of Tennis:\n\nAncient Arithmetic: The Possible Origins Of The Tennis Scoring System, Part One Of Four Pieces On Tennis History;\n\nHorrible Histories: The Primordial, Honourable & Ignoble Arts Of Tennis Handicapping, Part Two Of Four Pieces On Tennis History;\n\nOdds Oddities: 18th & 19th Century Tennis Handicaps & Traditions – Some Stranger Than Others, Part Three Of Four Pieces On Tennis History;\n\nScoring Synchronicity: How Real Tennis Scoring Was Adopted For Lawn Tennis Scoring – Then Lawn Tennis Handicapping Methods Wormed Their Way Into Real Tennis, Part Four Of Four Pieces On Tennis History.\n\nTennis: A Cultural History, Heiner Gillmeister, A&C Black, 1998 or Tennis A Cultural History (Second edition), Heiner Gillmeister, Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2017\n\nReal Tennis Today and Yesterday, John Shneerson, Ronaldson Publications, 2015\n\nWillis Faber Book Of Tennis & Rackets, Lord Aberdare, Hutchinson, 1980\n\nThe Annals Of Tennis, Julian Marshall, “The Field” Office, 1878\n\nColloquia Familiaria by Desiderius Erasmus, c1518\n\nAntonio Scaino, 1555, Trattato del Giuoco della Palla (Treatise of the Ball Game)\n\nA Treatise on Tennis By a Member of the Tennis Club, now attributed to Robert Lukin, 1822\n\nDe Corrupti Sermonis Emendatione, Mathurin Cordier (Corderius), 1536\n\nThe Sports and Pastimes of the People of England from the Earliest Period, Joseph Strutt, 1801\n\nMusic At the Court of Burgundy 1364-1419, Craig Wright, Institute of Medieval Music, 1979.\n\n“Dijon, Burgundy,” in Europe: A Literary History, 1348-1418, Volume 1.
