STATISTICAL TABLES 95 3 Introductory Letter YOUR WORSHIP THE MAYOR and MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF PRETORIA, I have the honour to present the Fifty-Ninth Annual Health Report of the City of Pretoria. I am pleased to report that health conditions throughout the year have been satisfactory. The European population is now 164,500 which is an increase of 3,300. The Bantu population has increased by 5,850 to 193,250. Asiatics have increased by 150 to 7,750 and the Eurafrican population has remained static. There is practically no change in the European birth rate but there is a big increase in the Bantu birth rate from 38.54 to 45.44. As I have mentioned in previous reports, we have for a long time been trying to get more accurate birth registration and I think that this increase from year to year in the birth rate amongst the Bantu really only means that we are at last succeeding in getting most of the births registered. This figure of 45.44 is probably very nearly correct. Death rates for Europeans show an increase from 6.39 to 7.20 and for Bantus from 12.48 to 12.62. Infantile mortality rates amongst Europeans has increased from 26.08 to 28.45, and it has decreased amongst the Bantu from 112.42 to 92.12. This is the lowest figure which we have ever recorded for Bantus. The next lowest figure was in 1960 when the rate was 101.50. The actual rate would probably be still lower if the births and deaths notifications were more accurately recorded. Amongst Europeans, heart disease still remains the biggest cause of death. The total number of deaths from this illness increased from 306 to 329 which gives a somewhat increased rate of from 1.90 last year to 2.00 per 1,000 population. There is also an increase in the number of deaths from cancer from 115 to 131. Here too, the rate has increased from 0.71 per 1,000 population last year to 0.80. Cancer still remains our second highest cause of death. Amongst non-Europeans the largest number of deaths is again due to respiratory diseases, from which there were 255 deaths this year as compared to 241 last year. The next highest was 154 deaths from heart disease. I am very pleased to record that there has been an appreciable decrease in motor accidents from 36 to 24 amongst Europeans and from 51 to 41 amongst non-Europeans. There has been an extensive road safety campaign conducted throughout the Republic of South Africa and this must have had some effect on bringing down this rate. It is hoped that this unnecessary daily toll of deaths will be reduced still further. This will surely happen if drivers of motor vehicles will become less selfish and realise their responsibility. Tuberculosis still remains our most serious infectious disease. This year there is a slight increase amongst the number of European cases notified from 21 to 30 and there has been a still further increase amongst non-Europeans from 716 last year to 758. I again wish to emphasise that his increase should not be interpreted to mean an actual increase in the incidence ; it is really because we have been in a position through our mass miniature apparatus and other means, to extend our search for cases. The number of Diptheria cases amongst Europeans has increased from 12 last year to 29 this year and amongst non-Europeans from 32 to 47. Nearly all the children who contracted the illness had not been immunised, and although the Department has active immunisation clinics as can be seen from the report, the position is still very unsatisfactory and we are continually trying to impress upon the public the importance of immunisation. We can only hope that we will be able to achieve a state of adequate protection through our educational drive. So far we have maintained the low incidence level of Poliomyelitis. This has been the ex¬ perience throughout the Republic and follows the pattern of other countries where active immunisation has been practised on a large scale especially with the orally administered live attenuated Poliomyelitis vaccine. Like others, I too think that the lowering of the incidence is attributable to the efficacy of the vaccine, and it would seem that if sufficiently large numbers were immunised, we should be able to keep the incidence of Poliomyelitis at a minimum. However, without wishing to discredit the efficacy of the vaccine or to minimise the importance of getting all susceptible persons protected, we must always remember that epidemiology has in the past shown strange phenomena. Sometimes illnesses have disappeared or become les- and at other times they have risen to epidemic proportions, for no apparent reason. 4 The Council’s housing activities have been maintained throughout the year and a full re- port is again submitted. I thank your Worship and Members of the City Council for the assistance extended to me and to the Health Department. I am also grateful for the assistance rendered by the public, Heads and sub-heads of other Departments. I wish to record my appreciation of the whole-hearted co-operation received from the Press at all times. They gave publicity to all important health measures in the City and have in no small way helped to establish good relationship between the department and the public as well as to bring to the notice of the public many important health matters. I am deeply grateful to members of my own staff, who have worked with me so loyally and with such enthusiasm. H.

For tables showing district distribution, age incidence and seasonal distribution, see end of report. This report should be read in conjunction with the section dealing with the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Chapter III. One thousand four hundred and eighty (1,480) cases of notifiable disease were reported during the year. This is an increase of 115 on last years figures. In some of the diseases there was a slight but insignificant increase in incidence, but Tuberculosis accounted for the greater part; there being 102 more cases reported this year than last year. In order to assess the incidence and consider methods for the control of Kwashiorkor it was made notifiable by the State Health Department during September of this year. Notifications of this disease also account for some of the increased notifications. One of the main weapons in combating Kwashiorkor is education of the public, and as by far the greatest number of cases occur in Bantu, they are most in need of enlightenment. As the Bantu does not easily take to propaganda in the form of pamphlets, posters etc., the need for personnel specially trained in Health Education is becoming increasingly necessary. Should such personnel be employed they would not only help in controlling this disease but their field could be widened to improve many other aspects of health of which the Bantu, are at present ignorant. There were no epidemics, but Tuberculosis still remains the greatest problem in the control of all Infectious Diseases. Much is already being done, but until the socio-economic and educa¬ tional standard of the Bantu reaches a higher level or unless we discover some more miraculous weapon in the control of Tuberculosis, it will take a long time to reduce the incidence to minimal proportions. TUBERCULOSIS: The number of notifications for Europeans remain reasonably constant again, there being 4 more cases reported than last year, but in non-Europeans there is a considerable drop in the increase of the incidence as compared with previous years. In 1961 there was an increase of 249 over 1960 figures whereas 1962 showed only an increase of 88 compared with 1961. TUBERCULOSIS VITAL STATISTICS: The following tables, A, B and B1 show the total number of notifications for the year, classi¬ fied in the various races and sexes, together with the respective incidence rates for local cases only, and comparative tables of notifications, together with incidence rates for the years 1947 to 1962 for Europeans and non-Europeans respectively.

The X-ray services are performed by a European technical assistant and a Bantu clerk. One European doctor is in charge of Tuberculosis services. By mass miniature X-ray 13,624 chest X-rays were taken. The figure for the previous year was 8,916. Of the 13,624 X-rays taken 4,034 (1,070) were in respect of private enterprises. Of these 94 were found to suffer from Tuberculosis. Where routine X-ray screening of staff is requested by private enterprises, the Department grants this service at a nominal fee of 20c per plate. It is pleasing to note that more and more private enterprises are becoming conscious of the desirability of having members of the staff screened. MORTALITY 1962: (OLD AND NEW CASES).

A considerable number are also only notified at death. The total deaths occurring during the year were as follows: — Non- Europeans Europeans Total Cases notified during 1962 and who also died ^ during 1962 . 2 (2) 96 (89) 98 (91) Cases notified prior to 1962 but who died during 1962 . 3 (2) 69 (47) 72 (49) Total deaths during 1962 . 5 (4) _ 165 (136) 170 (140) Table F shows Tuberculosis mortality in races and sexes together with death rates for the respective groups.

The 26 deaths which occurred within one month of notification were patients who only came to our clinics when the disease was so advanced that treatment was of little avail. There is again a very marked drop in mortality amongst cases who received treatment for periods longer than one month after notification. It is also observed again that in non-Europeans the male deaths exceed by far the female deaths. We think this is because the male is usually the bread-winner of the family and does not present himself for examination, because he is likely to lose a days pay if he stays away from work to attend the clinic. If he happens to be suffering from Tuberculosis, his condition deteriorates until he is no longer able to work, and only then does he seek medical advice, when treatment becomes very difficult. It has often been found that secondary cases are the first to be discovered and only on looking for the source of infection is it found to be the male adult breadwinner who had failed to seek medical advice as stated above.

It is pleasing to report that no deaths were recorded. All the patients were removed to the Isolation Wards for treatment. Three secondary infections were recorded. All these cases occurred in a dwelling from which a recent previous case had been reported. There was no milk-borne outbreak. In tracing the sources of infection, 16 suspects were tested for the possible carrier state. The report of blood specimens of 2 were Vi (+). Typhoid bacilli were, however not grown from repeated stool and urine cultures. Tests carried out for Typhoid Carrier State : Typhoid Fever investigations . .

Here they undergo regular stool and urine examination and are kept under control. 26 Number of inmates in Typhoid Carrier Camp on 1st January, 1962 6 Number of cases admitted during the year . 4 10 Number discharged during the year . 2 Still in camp on 31st December, 1962 . 8 Imported Cases Of the imported cases, twelve (3 Europeans and 9 Bantu) were Pretoria residents who con¬ tracted the disease outside the Pretoria Municipal area. The balance, 49 cases (9 Europeans and 40 Bantu) were patients admitted direct to hospital from outside the Municipal area. POLIOMYELITIS: The number of cases notified during the year were as follows: — Europeans Non-Europeans Total Local cases . — (2) 1 (1) 1 (3) Imported cases . 2(1) 2 (2) 4 (3) Incidence rates per 100,000 population (local cases) . — (1.2) .48 (0.5) .269 (0.8) Deaths in local cases . — ( — ) — ( — ) — ( — ) The local case, a Bantu of 9 months, had paralysis of the right leg with paresis (weakening of the muscles) of the left leg. He was admitted to the Isolation Wards for treatment and has shown a marked degree of recovery. Type 1 Poliomyelitis virus was isolated from his stools. He had never been immunised previously. Imported Cases Two of the imported cases were Europeans and two were Bantus. All were admitted direct to the Isolation Wards from outside the Municipal area. General Like last year the incidence of Poliomyelitis, remains extremely low. We conducted a success¬ ful immunisation campaign during 1961, and have held regular weekly clinics for immunisation of both Europeans and non-Europeans. We hope and think that the reduction in the incidence has resulted from this, but time alone will give the ultimate answer. This sudden drop in incidence, however, must not be taken for granted. We must not loose sight of the fact that before Poliomyelitis occurred in epidemic form, i.e. the years prior to 1954, the incidence increased every 3 to 4 years, dropping to minimal proportions during the in between years. The rise and fall of the incidence may therefore have been part and parcel of a natural and expected epidemiological sequence. As I said before, we will only really be able to judge the effectiveness of the vaccine after a sufficiently long period of years have elapsed, and then only if the rate of immunisation is main¬ tained. Although regular immunisation clinics are conducted for the public, and although continued propaganda is made for immunisation, insufficient numbers of children are at present being immunised to maintain a sufficiently high level of immunity. The following table shows the number of doses of Poliomyelitis vaccine administered to the public during the year: — Preg- Immi- nant grants 3-5 6-11 1-4 5-6 7-9 10-14 15-19 20-29 women 30-39 Total over mths. mths. yrs. yrs. yrs. yrs. yrs. yrs. 29 yrs. yrs.

If it is presumed that each child was given the routine 3 doses it would mean that 1,717 persons were fully immunised. In non-Europeans again for the same age group 5,069 doses were administered which on the same basis of calculation represents 1,689 children fully immunised. 27 Our statistics however show that 4,183 Europeans and 8,531 non-Europeans were born during the year. This means that 2,466 out of a total of 4,183 European children and 6,842 out of a total of 8,531 non-European children were never immunised. In actual fact the number of unimmunised or partly immunised persons would be higher, as there are no doubt some that have not com¬ pleted the course of three doses. These facts are disturbing and much remains to be done in order to get a greater percentage of the susceptible public immunised. It is worthwhile repeating what I said about immunisations against Poliomyelitis in my Annual Report last year, namely we know only too well that once a disease reaches minimal proportions the public becomes apathetic and neglectful about immunisation, and it is this very apathy and neglect that has to be continually and definitely combatted. There is one important factor which we must always bear in mind in connection with mass immunisation against Poliomyelitis with the live attenuated virus; it will eliminate or reduce to a minimum the virulent viruses of Poliomyelitis from the general population. This is all to the good because by so doing it will eliminate Poliomyelitis. But it will also reduce the number of people in the general population who would normally develop natural immunity, as the normal presence of the virus in the general population will disappear because these viruses are killed in the intestinal tract of persons immunised with live viruses and are not excreted. And so, in a few years time, in a properly immunised population, we will have very little natural immunity. This makes it encumbent on us to ensure that all newly born children are immunised when they are about three months old. If this is not done, we might find ourselves with a new young highly susceptible population which might lead to disastrous results if there were to be an outbreak of Poliomyelitis. If we are going to use this immunising agent, and I say we must, then it also becomes our duty to ensure that all newly born children are similarly protected. Although by continual propaganda a reasonable amount of success in this direction could be attained, I feel so strongly about this that I have recommended to the Advisory Committee on Virology to the Minister of Health, that immunisation of children with this vaccine be made compulsory. SCARLET FEVER: The cases reported were as follows: — Europeans Non-Europeans Total Local cases . 54 (61) — (1) 54 (62) Imported cases . 7 (4) — ( — ) 7 (4) Local cases As before the disease remains mild with rarely any complications. Two of the cases were adults, 35 were scholars and 17 children of pre-school age. Twenty-six were males and 28 females. Six of the cases were admitted to the Isolation Wards, 4 to the Military Hospital at Voortrekkerhoogte and 44 were isolated and treated at home. There were 10 secondary cases. All the secondary cases occurred in dwellings from which a recent previous case had been reported. Imported Cases Three of the cases were Pretoria residents who contracted the disease outside the Pretoria Municipal area. The balance, 4 cases, were patients admitted direct to hospital from outside the Municipal area. DIPHTHERIA: The cases notified during the year were as follows: — Europeans Non-Europeans Total Local cases . 29 (12) Imported cases . 6 (9) Deaths in local cases . 6 ( — ) Incidence rates per 100,000 population (local cases) . 18.2(7.4) 47 (32) 76 (44) 67 (72) 73 (81) 5 (4) 11 (4) 22.3 (16.0) 20.5 (12.1) Local Cases The non-European cases were 3 Eurafricans and 44 Bantu. Three of the cases were adults, 18 were scholars and 55 were children of pre-school age. Twenty-six were males and 50 were females. Seventy-five of the cases were removed to the Isolation Wards for treatment and 1 was isolated and treated at home. Eleven of the cases (6 Europeans and 5 Bantu) unfortunately died. Only one of these cases, a European, had previously been immunised. This child was admitted in a moribund condition. Three secondary cases (2 Eurafricans and 1 Bantu) were reported. All the secondary cases occurred in dwellings from which a recent previous case had been reported. 28 Sixty-seven (24 Europeans, 2 Eurafricans and 41 Bantus) had never been immunised, but 9 (5 Europeans and 4 Bantus) had been immunised previously. Eight had the disease in a mild form only, but one had a severe attack and unfortunately died. The number of persons incoculated against Diphtheria at the Departments clinics over the past 12 years, together with the number of cases occurring during the same period are shown in the following table: — Europeans Non-Europeans Number of Number of Immunised cases Immunised cases 1952 . . 604 32 1,291 14 1953 . . 972 27 316 23 1954 . . 3,216 98 590 26 1955 . . 431 52 280 38 1956 . . 989 26 3,345 57 1957 . . 1,062 10 1,023 49 1958 . . 1,123 18 1,174 63 1959 . . 1,452 13 1,410 73 1960 . . 1,411 22 1,486 61 1961 . . 1,259 12 1,728 32 1962 . . 2,427 30 2,224 46 Note The large number of European children immunised during 1954, was because of the increased incidence of Diphtheria in Europeans during that year which resulted in a more ready response to our propaganda campaign at that time. The large number of non-Europeans immunised during 1956 was a result of an intensive immunisation campaign carried out in the Mamelodi Location. It is pleasing to note that the number of Europeans immunised during the year under review is approximately twice the number immunised during the previous year. This is because the public following on the three phases of the Poliomyelitis immunisation campaigns conducted durin 1961, are still “immunisation” conscious. This has had the effect of drawing the public to the Department’s clinics. Once they come for Poliomyelitis immunisation they are offered Diphthera immunisations at the same time. The numbers immunised are still not satisfactory. There has been a similar increase in the number of non-Europeans immunised, but the numbers of persons immunised 2,224 compared with the number of births during the year, 9,151 indicates that a large percentage of the non-European children remain unimmunised. Imported cases Of the imported cases, one was a Pretoria resident who contracted the disease outside the Municipal area. The balance, 72 cases, were patients admitted direct to hospital from outside the Municipal area. SMALLPOX: During May, two Smallpox cases, two Bantu children of 8 and 5 years from the Mamelodi Bantu residential area, were reported. On investigation it was found that they had contracted the disease while visiting relatives in the Northern Transvaal. The patients were removed to Riet- fontein hospital near Johannesburg on the day of discovery, where the diagnosis was confirmed. Both patients had the disease in a mild form and recovered completely. Both cases had attended one of our clinics where a baby clinic was in course. The names and addresses of the persons who attended the clinic that day were obtained and all the contacts in the houses where they lived, were vaccinated during the following two days. As a result, 188 houses were visited and 1,034 contacts vaccinated. Simultaneously five vaccination teams consisting of Health Inspectors, assisted by non- European officials of the non-European Affairs Department, vaccinated residents occupying houses in the vicinity of the dwellings where the cases occurred. Four thousand five hundred and one (4,501) contacts were vaccinated in this way. Seven hundred and seventy nine scholars and staff attending a school in the area were also vaccinated. Hereunder is a summary of the vaccinations : — Clinic contacts vaccinated . 1,034 Residents in vicinity of the infected dwelling vaccinated . 4,501 Scholars and staff at a school nearby vaccinated . 779 Staff at non-European Affairs Department vaccinated . 62 6,376 No further cases occurred. SMALLPOX VACCINATION CAMPAIGN: A series of Smallpox cases occurred in England during December, 1961, and early January, 1962. As a result, the public began to think of vaccination and the dangers of not being adequately protected against this disease. 29 The number of vaccinations done at the weekly clinic at the Department suddenly rose from an average of 40 to over 300. This, coupled with the fact that two cases of Smallpox, one in Pietersburg and one in Meadowlands near Johannesburg, had been reported over the week-end 20th-21st January, resulted in our decision to conduct a Smallpox vaccination campaign. On the 25th January the campaign was started. Two days per week, Mondays and Thursdays were set aside for immunising the European public at the Department. Vaccinations were done from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Vaccination stations were also opened on the Municipal market for non- Europeans in the city centre and domestic and other employees on 25 th January, as well as in the various non-European residential areas as from the 30th January. The market centre was open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays to Fridays and those in the non-European residential areas on Mondays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. All possible publicity was given to the campaign through articles in the press and through broadcasts on general, regional and Bantu news services. On the first day of the campaign, 9,105 Europeans and 1,225 non-Europeans were vaccinated. As many requests were made by private enterprises for the Department to vaccinate members of their staff at their place of employment, a mobile team of two inspectors visited various factories and commercial undertakings. . „ . Health Inspectors assisted by Health Visitors, carried out the vaccinations on Europeans and Health Inspectors, assisted by non-Europeans from the Non-European Affairs Department did vaccinations at centres in the non-European areas. . The response by the public, both European and non-European, was good, and as diminishing j^ujYihers were vaccinated, certain of the vaccination stations were closed until on the 8th March the campaign ended. . The results achieved are shown in the undermentioned table: — Europeans vaccinated . Non-Europeans vaccinated . Total vaccinated . Only two cases (both Bantus) of generalised vaccinia were recorded. No cases of post vaccination encephalitis were reported. 37,299 92,128 129,427 ROUTINE VACCINATION AGAINST SMALLPOX: One thousand nine hundred and forty seven (1,947) Europeans and 1,829 non-Europeans were vaccinated at Municipal clinics during the year, details of which are given below.

This difficulty has now, however, been overcome and notifications for next year may give a reasonably true reflection of the in' cidence of this disease. The number of notifications quoted in the following schedules, for reasons stated above, do not reflect a true figure for the four months September to December, 1962. Seventy-two (72) cases, all Bantus, were reported during this period. 30 Distribution : Lady Selborne Bantu area . 12 Saulsville Bantu area . 12 Atteridgeville Bantu area . 18 Mamelodi Bantu area . 27 Western suburbs . 1 TOTAL . 72 AGE GROUPS IN SEXES 0-1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-6 6-7 Over 7 Total yrs. yrs . yrs . yrs. yrs. yts. yrs. yrs.

STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTIONS During the year a total of 159 cases of this disease in mothers and newborn babies were notified. One hundred and thirty three (133) of the patients were Europeans and 26 non-Europeans. The distribution of the cases, together with the number of confinements in each maternity home or group, and the percentage of mothers and babies who showed signs of infection after parturition, are shown in the following tables: — Europeans.

Non-Europeans . Number of Number of Percentage of Infections confinements confinements infected % Hospital E . 16 6,059 0-2 Hospital F . 9 1,595 0*5 Midwives . 1 ? ? The above figures for non-Europeans are extremely low and are not reliable as it is considered that many cases are never discovered, for the following reasons: — 1. Expansion in Mamelodi and Saulsville townships have increased to such an extent, and the distances to be covered on foot on bad roads by the existing non-European Clinic nurses are so great, that only a small percentage of home visits are actually done. 2. Clinic attendances at the above clinics have increased to such an extent that the non- European Clinic Nurses have very little time left for home visiting. 3. The rate of admissions to the Holy Cross Nursing Home in Lady Selborne township, is so high that most of the patients are discharged on the third day after parturition. Many of these cases are from new extensions to Saulsville township. Most cases are discovered by Health Visitors on their routine visits to newborn babies, usually 14 days after birth when the mothers and babies are at home again. Amongst other routine matters, mothers are questioned on the possible presence of Staphylococcal lesions. Where necessary, swabs are immediately taken and any abnormal condition is reported. 31 The sites of infection, in the 159 cases reported, were as follows: — cases Discharging eyes . 52 Breast abscesses . 46 Skin lesions (boils, pustules or septic rashes) . 46 Septic umbilicus . 9 Septic finger nails . 3 Caesarian wounds septic . 3 TOTAL . 159 In 76 of the cases, diagnostic swabs were taken. Sixty-five (65) of these showed Coagulase (+ ) Staphylococcus and 3 Coagulase ( — ) Staphyloccocus, to be present. In eight cases no growth was found. Swabs were not taken from the balance of the cases (83), as the lesions had been treated and had already healed by the time the Health Visitor made her visit. From the clinical history, however, the lesions were considered to be Staphylococcal. Apart from the above (159) cases, ninety-four (94) suspect cases were found not to be of Staphylococcal origin, for the following reason. Ten (10) because of extended incubation periods which could not be linked up with the confinement of the newborn infant. Sixty-one (61) were notified as staphylococcal eye infections, but proved to be negative for staphylococci on bacterio¬ logical examination. The balance, 23 cases, gave vague clinical symptoms, which showed some doubt as to the infection being of staphylococcal origin and in some cases, the swabs taken, showed no growth. The conditions described in these 23 cases were as follows: — Swollen breasts, lumps in breasts, inflamed and painful breasts . Umbilicus Moist . Skin rashes . Caesarian wound inflamed . Boils . 1 5 Abscess in neck . 1 3 Abscess in nose . 1 9 Breast abscess . 1 Swabs taken in seven of the above cases produced no growth. Where no growth was obtained, repeat swabs were taken if the infection had not healed. Other infections found in nine of the “no cases” were as follows: — Diplococcus pneumonia . 4 Alpha Haemolytic Streptococcus . 3 E. coli . 1 Bacillus subtilis . 1 Fifteen (15) of the patients gave information that either relatives or friends, who had visited them during the puerperium, had histories of boils or suppurating skin lesions. Sensitivity tests were also carried out on cases of Caogulase (V ) Staphylococcus to assist in the treatment of the patients. The number of Coagulase (+) swabs which showed insensitivity to the various anti-bacterial agents were as follows: — To Polymixen . 71 To Chloramphenicol To Penicillin . 61 To Erythromycin. . . 1 o 1 etracyclin . 36 To Colistin . To Oxitetracycline . 35 To Amphicillin. . . . To Chlortetracy cline . 25 To Novobiocin . To Streptomycin . To Kanamycin . 18 5 5 5 4 4 Supervision of persons practising midwifery in the Municipal area, other than medical practitioners, is carried out by the Inspectress of Midwives. Her duties include routine inspections of maternity homes under our control. On these inspections the staff at the maternity homes are consulted and advised in the control of this infection. When the disease first became notifiable, as was expected, some opposition was experienced in some hospitals, but it is pleasing to note that those difficulties have now been overcome and there is friendly co-operation between hospital staff, medical practitioners and officials of this Department. Some of the improvements effected in maternity homes since the disease became notifiable, are given hereunder: — 1. Hospital questionnaires now include questions on the possible presence of Staphylococcal infections in the patient or her family. Where positive cases are found, they are imme¬ diately quarantined on admission. The hospital staff immediately advises the Department of this and we can conduct investigations in good time. 2. Provision of individual clinical thermometers for each patient. 3. The use of Gill soap for washing and bathing infants, as well as the use of Dessicord and Kalacide dusting powders for both mothers and babies. 4. The general use of Quaturge for various cleaning operations. 5. The conveyance of soiled linen in closed bags through the hospital. Med. (Eng.) — 3 32 6. The sorting of clean linen in passages and not in the wards. 7. The provision of covered receptacles in the wards for the temporary storage of soiled napkins and other linen. 8. The use of disposable paper masks by members of hospital staff. 9. The complete separation of clean and soiled linen in laundries at the hospitals. 10. The provision of suitable sleeping accommodation for night staff. It was found in one hospital that staff brought blankets from their homes and slept during their “off period” in the mattress store. 11. The provision of plastic covers to all mattresses. 12. The routine repeated taking and examination of nose and throat swabs of members of the hospital staff. Positive reactors are treated with Naceptin. The Department’s control programme includes some requirements which are costly and it may take some time before everything is done. Considerable progress has however already been made, and it is hoped that in the not too distant future all possible effective measures will be carried out to keep this infection under control. Recently a consultant Bacteriologist, who is interested in the control of this infection in hos- pitals, offered his services to the Department, free of charge. This would include visits to maternity homes once a fortnight during which time he would lecture to the staff, guide them in their pur¬ chases of materials for control of infection, undertake bacteriological survey of blankets, environment and laundry, and in general help the hospital staff to help themselves in reducing the incidence of this infection. Such a service would be a great help in backing up other control measures advocated. It is obvious, with the high rate of nasal carriers, there always will be cases occurring in mothers and newborn babies, but our efforts for control are based in the belief that the spread of infection in maternity homes, can be controlled by a high standard of nursing and asepsis and that possible epidemics may, in this way, be avoided.

The European pavilions, which are entirely separate from the non-European section can accommodate 50 patients, while the non-European pavilions have 40 beds. There is no separate accommodation for Asiatic or Coloured patients, but when possible they are nursed in private, single or double-bedded wards. The non-European Section is staffed entirely by Bantu nurses, with an occasional Eurafrican nurse who is taking her training at the Pretoria General Hospital. FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. The Pretoria Hospital Board supplies all nursing staff, dispensing requirements, X-ray facilities, rations, linen and laundering, steam, light and water, together with certain specified costs of maintenance of buildings and equipment. The City Council in return pays a fixed sum per patient per day for those patients for which it accepts financial responsibility. This sum is revised at intervals by arrangement when rising costs warrant it. In addition by mutual agreement, the Specialist Staff of the General Hospital is available for consultation at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, while the City Council’s Medical Officers provide a twenty-four hour infectious diseases consultation service which is used and appreciated particu¬ larly by the staff of the casualty and admissions section of the General Hospital. AREAS SERVED. These include the Pretoria Municipal area, its Peri-Urban areas and the Northern Transvaal, but patients are accepted from any other area which happens to be having difficulty in accommo¬ dating its own patients during, for example, an epidemic period. AMBULANCE ARRANGEMENTS. Pretoria City Council provides its own infectious diseases ambulance service. The Peri- Urban Areas Health Board does the same, while other local authorities send their patients in by rail, taxi or ambulance as the occasion demands.

This increase in Europeans was practically confined to the north-western suburbs. The number of non-European cases admitted from outside Pretoria was practically the same as last year. One-hundred and forty-one (115) patients were admitted during the year, of which 34 (23) were Europeans and 107 (118) were non Europeans. Two local cases, both nurses, one European and the other non-European were regarded as temporary carriers of the diphtheria bacillus. Distribution. Europeans ....

One of these “bullneck” cases developed, over a period of fifty-one days, just about every possible complication of diphtheria. One other case of “bullneck” diphtheria recovered. Non'Europeans. — Seventeen cases died and of these six had “bullneck” attacks. Altogether twelve cases of “bullneck” diphtheria were admitted.

Other Europeans admitted were two cases of Erysipelas, one Anthrax, one Puerperal sepsis, one Vaccinia with Impetigo, two Meningo-encephalitis and one Guillain-Barre syndrome which had to be placed on an intermittent positive pressure respirator. Three non-European cases with generalised Vaccinia, one with Erysipelas and another with a Coxsackie virus infection were also admitted. Three Europeans and three non-Europeans had to be admitted as lodgers. These were all cases where breast-fed infants were concerned and no alternative arrangements could be made. OBSERVATION CASES: Thirty-four (41) Europeans and 53 (66) non-Europeans sent in for observation were found not to be suffering from an infectious disease. Most of them were sent in as possible Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever or Pulmonary Tuberculosis cases. Two middle-aged European females died. One was admitted as a suspected Pulmonary Tuberculosis but was found to be suffering from Addison’s Disease complicated by a bronchial Carcinoma. The other was admitted as a suspect case of diphtheria but was found to suffer from Agranulocytosis. Two elderly non-European male patients also died. Both were admitted as suspect cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and both died of Carcinoma: The one of a bronchial Carcinoma and the other with secondary carcinomatous lesions in the lung.

EUROPEAN SERVICES: Four sessions a week are held, two for females and two for males, including a session for males in the late afternoon after working hours. The staff who also carry out other duties, consists of a Medical Officer, sister and a male clinic clerk. All European sessions are conducted by the Medical Officer in charge of the Infectious Diseases Hospital.

The main clinics, by far the largest, are conducted as previously explained, at the Special Diseases Clinic in the Pretoria Hospital grounds. Sessions are also held at Atteridgeville- and Mamelodi Poly-clinics. The staff at the Central Clinic is the same as for Europeans with the addition of two part-time non-European orderlies and a non-European nurse. The Medical Officer in charge of the Isolation Hospital conducts all four sessions at the Central Clinic, while the sessions at the other centres are conducted by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. There is thus a total of six sessions a week for non-Europeans in Pretoria, and two centres in the Bantu residential areas, at which patients may present themselves daily for treatment (excluding Saturdays and Sundays). Sessions last approximately an hour and a half while the early evening sessions at the Central Clinic last two hours. Tracing of contacts of non-Eur"
