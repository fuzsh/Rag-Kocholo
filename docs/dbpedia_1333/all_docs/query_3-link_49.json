He was joined in about 1890 by Vincent Charles Cloete and in 1901 by WH(MA)Kempen. The firm practised as Probart, Cloete and Kempen until 1902 when Probart died. Thereafter it was known as Cloete and Kempen. This firm lasted until 1919 when Willie left to move in with the Karoo Board of Executors. The board crashed and was liquidated. Willie continued to have his office in the building which was then purchased by Barclays Bank. Gerhardus Petrus Kempen, first cousin of Willie, joined as a partner in 1922 and the name of the firm Kempen & Kempen came into being. Willie was elected Mayor of Victoria West for 27 years. He was directly responsible for the creation of the Victoria West catchment area dam 1921, the building of the Town Hall 1911, Airport 1920, Hospital and Power Station.\n\nWillie died suddenly as a result of pneumonia in 1933 at the young age of 56.\n\nThis poetic eulogy was written by a family friend, Alwyn Petrus Smit, and his descendant, Alwyn Smit has kindly given permission for it to be published.\n\nTer nagedagtenis van ons ontslape Burgemeester(WH Kempen – oorlede Victoria-Wes 1933)\n\n‘n Almans vader is uit ons dorp geskeur\n\nMaar waarom tog so vroeg al Heer?\n\nOns dorp se grootste roem en eer\n\nAlom so wyd gerespekteer\n\nSo graag wou ons hom langer hou\n\nHeer, en U roep hom dan so gou!?\n\nOns kan nie help ‘n traan uit ons oog te veeg\n\nWant ons hart voel droewig kil en leeg\n\nSoos hy ‘n lamp wat spoedig het uitgegaan\n\nBly ons soos kinders doelloos staan.\n\nPynlik het hy heengegaan\n\nNou rustend langs die sipreslaan\n\nIn lewe ‘n man van eer en reg\n\nWat trou steeds bly by wat hy seg\n\nJa, ‘n man vir vrede en reg\n\nHet hy menig broedertwis besleg\n\nMededeelsaam was hy, goed en wys\n\nDonker en afgryslik mag vir hom gewees het die nag\n\nMaar tog skenk dit vir sy siel die rus so lawend sag\n\nOp sy spore en handewerk val die dou\n\nMaar in die ewige rusplek rus hy nou\n\nGeruk uit ons midde deur die wrede dood\n\nVerlate en gebêre in moeder aard se skoot\n\nTog dink ons nog bly en dankbaar terug\n\nAan sy goedheid en blye gesig\n\nAs ‘n goeie gewer vir sy medemens\n\nSo vroeg gemaai deur vader tyd se sens\n\n‘n Wyse raadsheer van arm en ryk\n\nRed vele nooddriftiges uit die slyk\n\nOf soals Vondel sou hebben geschreven\n\nAs hy saam met die oorledene heeft geleven\n\n“Hy was een man wat deed wat hy konden\n\nGaf uit zijn schrale deel, aan andere vele ponden”.\n\nDaarby\n\nWas hy:\n\n‘n Trou besoeker van sy kerk\n\n‘n Milde gewer vir die Heer se werk\n\nJa, ‘n man van voorbeeld is ons ontruk\n\nEn in benoudheid word ons voortgedruk\n\nOns harte voel met smart deurboor\n\n‘n Vader het ons in hom verloor\n\nEn met gebroke stemme moet ons sê\n\nHeer U wil geskied, U wou dit hê.\n\nJa, talle op aarde die sal hom mis\n\nMaar ons gun hom volkome die soete rus\n\nHy’t voor ons heengegaan, vooruit\n\nVoorberei vir die ewigheid\n\nEn onwillekeurig kom by ons die vraag\n\nHeer, watter boom word eerste nou gesaag\n\nLiewe leser, nie so grootliks watter dag of tyd\n\nMaar die vraag… is u bereid?\n\nLangs die hoë sipreslaan\n\nWaar die graniet grafsteen staan\n\nLê ‘n hopie rooivaal grond\n\nBedekkende die graf se mond\n\nWaar binne die kis van hout\n\nDie laaste oorskot lê so koud…\n\nSoos ‘n uitgedoofde kool, die as\n\nOnder verwelkende blomme, grond en gras\n\nEn self nie van die feit bewus\n\nDis hier waar sy laaste oorskot rus\n\nSy siel is veilig deur die Jordaan\n\nEn ons stamel, God… U het wel gedaan\n\nEn te midde van ons verdriet\n\nHeer… U wil geskied.\n\n(Author: Alwyn Petrus Smit *18.10.1907 + 08.01.1965 )\n\nJACOBA MAGDALENA CLAASSENS: ( KOSIE )\n\nBorn 5th March 1882 at Victoria West.\n\nShe was the daughter of Johannes Hendrik Claassens and Johanna Cornelia Immelman of Victoria West. She was a direct descendant of Claasz Gerritsz of Bengale.\n\nMiscarriage of Justice:\n\nHow much has been embellished in the following story, I don’t know, but there is some truth in it, I believe. It was told to me by my father and involves his Grandfather, Johannes Hendrik Claassens.\n\nAround about 1898, a prisoner escaped from the Victoria West jail. He was an African man. Into the setting sun the escapee made his way to the west. My great-grandfather, Johannes Hendrik Claassens, was a sheep farmer at the farm Gemsboksfontein about nine kilometres to the west out of Victoria West. Later that evening my grandmother Kosie who was 18 years of age at the time, was preparing to go to bed and was dressed in her underwear, when she spotted a black face looking at her through the bedroom window. She gave a frightened scream and her father came running to investigate. She related her story in haste and her dad ran outside grabbing his rifle which always stood near the front door of the farm house. In the pale moonlight he spied a figure running away and without thinking raised his rifle and fired a shot in the direction of the fleeing figure. “Well”, thought JH, “that would put the wind up him”. And without further ado they went to bed.\n\nThe following morning, just after sunrise, the Victoria West Constabulary arrived, to ask if JH had seen any strangers. “Oh Yes” said JH and related his story. “Well Mr Claassens, you had better come with us to see if he is still hiding out on your farm”, the Police insisted. So off they went in the general direction JH gave them. “What’s this” exclaimed the Police, spying a dried drop of blood on a rock nearby. Now the search began in earnest. They scoured the gullies and the small creek beds, they looked through their binoculars near and far but saw nothing. About lunch time the search party sat down for a breather up on a randjie(small ridge). “He’s not here” said JH. “Oh yes, he is”, said one of the searchers. Just beneath them amongst the rocks, lay the body of the fugitive. An object had entered his back and passed through close to the heart !\n\n“No, No, Noooooo. This has nothing to do with me”, protested JH.\n\n“Sorry, Mr. Claassens”, said the Police Sergeant, “by your own admission I have no alternative but to arrest you”.\n\nThe court case attracted a lot of attention. JH was a well known and respected member of the Victoria West community. The newspapers, seven hundred kilometres away in Cape Town, had a field day, decrying the lawlessness and lack of civility in the far flung regions of the Cape Province, prejudging the accused as a criminal.\n\nThe Supreme Court Judge, Barristers, Attorneys and clerks all arrived in Victoria West by train for the case. The Judge, it is surmised, was of English heritage and took a dim view of Afrikaner Boer farmers. He treated JH with disdain and instructed the barristers to do the same. The proceedings took three days and by the end of the trial things were looking grim for JH. The Judge declared that he would make his deliberation overnight and give his verdict the next morning at 9 am sharp!\n\nThe following morning the Judge arrived in court on time and when all were seated the Court Messenger handed a note to him. As he read the note the colour drained out of his face and he appeared to be shaking.\n\nThe note read, I have been told, as follows:\n\n“Your Honour. We, the public and citizens of Victoria West, hold Mr. Johannes Hendrik Claassens in great esteem. We are certain that his actions were unintentional and that the death of the fugitive was the result of an accident. If you decide to find Mr.Claassens guilty of this charge then we will not be able to guarantee your safe passage from Victoria West to where you must board the train for Cape Town. Please look out of the window to see what we mean.”\n\nHe rose from his chair, which sent the whole court jumping up, and walked over to the window and looked out. He returned to his chair and sat down. After some quiet moments he spoke. “I have given great consideration to this matter before me and I declare now that I find Mr Johannes Hendrik Claassens NOT GUILTY as charged”.\n\nOutside there were 30 Horse Commando Riders of the Victoria West Commando Unit, mounted, with their rifles aimed at the court building.\n\nThe newspaper headlines in Cape Town screamed:\n\nGREAT MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IN VICTORIA WEST!\n\nJacoba Magdalena died on 25th June 1952 at Victoria West.\n\nCLAASZ GERRITSZ VAN BENGALE\n\nAn important stamvader(progenitor) to many South Africans, together with Claas Mallebaar, he shares the rare distinction of being one of the very few non-European stamvaders to have founded a family that became an integral part of the indigenous white Afrikaans-speaking community in Southern Africa.\n\nA freed slave from Bengal, his descendants came to bear the patronymic Claesz and also use the surname Claassen. A major portion of his descendants in the male line has been incorrectly ascribed in published works to another stamvader Cornelis Claesz van Utrecht (alias Kees de Boer). Claas Gerritsz has also been ignored in virtually all major genealogical publications and compilations of South African families. This publication hopefully sets the matter straight.\n\nHistorian Anna Böeseken equates him with Gerrit van Bengale who was freed by his owner (patron) the free burgher Jochum Marquart on 23 December 1676. He was already at the Cape in 1671. He appears in the Opgaaf Rol for the year 1682 as single adult male free burgher resident in the Cape District owning the following: 3 male slaves, 1 horse, 35 oxen, 650 sheep, 3 flintlocks and 1 dagger (degen). He was baptised as an adult at the Cape’s Groote Kerk on 10 February 1686 (no witnesses being recorded). The baptismal entry reads as follows:\n\nClaes van Bengale beiaerde\n\nSlavery and Bengal\n\nBengal is the present-day Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). By 1718 the Dutch already had long since established six trading settlements in Mughal-occupied Bengal: Bellesoor (Balasore), Ballouwa or Volta (Falta), Bernagoor (Baranagar), Houghlij (Hug(h)li or Hoogli), Cossema Besaar (Kazimbazar) and Patana (Patna). Then there were also trading posts or factories manned by the English, Danes and French. Baranagar (which was also Danish-controlled) is singled out by Johan Daniel Buttner for its carnal pleasures:\n\nThe Dutch Company has a pleasure-garden, although it is now in a desolate state. This is a place where dwell none but whores, of all sorts of peoples, such as Portuguese, Jentiven [ie Hindus] etc, and here prostitution is no disgrace, nor reckoned as any sin. Anyone who desires a whore can rent such a female and use her as long as he will; everywhere he goes he can take her with him, and when he will have her no longer nor desires her, he lets her go off again, and pays her so much as he thinks fit. This is called here ‘keeping a female’…\n\nButtner’s description of the local Hindu population (the Jentives) is worth quoting:\n\nThe Jentiven, inhabitants of the lands of Bengal, have been here since antiquity, but are not under the rule of the Great Mogul. They offer their services to the Europeans who arrive by ship, to serve them as attendants or servants, since the custom here is that anyone may take a servant to serve him so long as he remains here, for which he pays him nothing except that he has the ‘Costumada’, that is to say when he buys anything [for his master] he receives from the merchant one rupee for each 100 rupees, and this is his pay. In addition, he gets Costumada from everything, although one must beware of such, since they are very deceitful…The inhabitants of the country are called Jentiven, although all the country is occupied and inhabited by the Moors. The Jentiven dress like the Moors or Turks, all in white linen, with a turban on the head. They live very frugally and eat little. They may not kill nor eat any living animal, but nourish themselves with milk, butter, roots, rice etc. They are very deceitful, and everyone must have a care of them lest he be deceived, and especial care of the merchants, who are called Benjanen [Banians], who are very sly and clever in trading. As regards language, they speak a distinct tongue which is not the same as Arabic, and this is called here the Bengal language, although Arabic is also in use and both are spoken…When the rich die they are burned. The wife also lets herself be burned with him, and leaps into the fire to the sound of many instruments. If she will not do this, her hair is cut off and she is chased away. Such a woman may not marry again, but must live by prostitution, and this they call ‘Pousseraun’, chasing away. Dead poor are usually thrown into the water. They take old men who can no longer walk or work to the bank, set a funnel in their gullet or neck and pour into the throat a mixture of sand and water so that they suffocate, and are then thrown into the water…\n\nThe origins of slavery in Bengal are steeped in antiquity. It is unlikely that Claes Gerritsz would have been Hindu or even Muslim, but not unlikely that he could have originally been sold by Moors. The existence of so-called tribal and mountain peoples (indigenes or aborigines) on the fringes of Muslim and Hindu society cannot be disregarded and also the abduction of people from places further afield such as Assam and Arakan (situated in the present-day Burma).\n\nCLAAS GERRITSZ VAN BENGALE at the Cape of Good Hope\n\nClaas van Bengale ( and there were a few slaves at the Cape with a similar name) was purchased by Elbert Diemer from Joachem Blanck on 27 November 1665 for and undisclosed sum of money. On 16 October 1685 Claas Gerritz van Bengale purchased an erf in Block A in Zee Straat in the Table Valley (ie the present-day Strand Street in Cape Town) from the official Guilliam Heems. The size of the erf was 21 r 5′ (300,3 sq m).\n\nHe married Sara van Soloor on 13 March 1686. According to the doopregister she was the slave of Willem van Dieden one of the Cape most influential personages where she is described as Sara Seloor dide meit and the meyt van Willem van Dieden). She originated from the island of Solor in the Indonesian archipelago.\n\nThe islands of Solor\n\nSolor is an island which is just east of Flores Island, in Indonesia, and north of Timor. It use to be called Nusa Holt. It was first a Portugese fort, in 1636 it was attacked by the Dutch, the Portuguese had to abandon the fortress again, and this time, forever. Some slaves from this island was taken to the Cape. The Solor Archipelago – Solor, Adonara and Lembata – has close cultural links the Larantuka area on Flores and together these people are known as the Lamaholot. Pantar and Alor are the main islands of the Alor Archipelago.\n\nHer toponym or provenance is sometimes referred to mistakenly as Ceylon, rather than Solor. Anna Böeseken, equates her (incorrectly?) with Sara van Ceylon who was manumitted on 10 June 1676 by the skipper of the ship Voorsightigheijt Ouwel Jansen with the option of either returning to the East or staying at the Cape. Her ownership by Willen van Dieden, however, is clear from the church records.\n\nSara from Soloor described as the meyt van Willem van Dieden baptised a voorkind on 29 October 1673. The child is described as een onbekent christens kint Henrijtte … Her daughter was re-baptised later together with Sara’s other voorkinders. In this way she was legitimised by the marriage of her mother to Claas Gerritsz van Bengale and by the joint baptism together with her de jure siblings (even though they were actually her half-siblings). Sara’s (initially) illegitimate daughter Henrietta (Jette) came to be known and use the surname Wittebol(s) throughout her adult life. Once legitimised by her mother’s marriage to her step-father, she also used (and was known by) the name Henrietta Claasz. Indications are that the identity of her biological (or ascribed) father – even though she had merely been referred to in her baptismal entry as een onbekent christens kint – was no secret or unknown Christian. He was the surveyor and VOC official Joan / Johan Wittebol (c. 1648-1681) from Amsterdam who was quick to marry Maria van Ruijven / Reuven from Delft at the Cape on 16 September 1674, by whom he had one son, Johan.\n\nWittebol had arrived on the Gecroonde Vrede in 1669 as a midshipman and commenced working a provisional assistant of the Council of Policy and surveyor. As assistant and shopkeeper, he maintained the Company’s books of merchandise. Promoted to junior merchant in 1672, he was discharged and demoted for defects in his administration in 1672 and 1673 and until 1678 no longer served on the Council of Policy. In 1676 the VOC’s visiting commissioner Nicolaas Verburgh described him favourably … een man van goede bequaamheijd en deughdelick comportement … and he was appointed as secretary to the Orphan Chamber serving on the Council of Policy from 1678 until his death in 1681 when holding the position of president of the Orphan Chamber.\n\nSara van Solor herself was only baptised as an adult on 3 September 1679. The baptismal entry (no witnesses are recorded) reads as follows:\n\nSara Seloor dide meit beiarde\n\nAlthough no record of her manumission has been found, she was probably freed just prior to her marriage on 13 March 1686 or at least some time after her baptism on 3 September 1679. We find Claas Gerritsz and Sara van Solor listed as a married couple in the muster roll (Opgaaf) for 1688:\n\nJan [sic] Gerrits from Bengal: 1 man; Sara van Ceylon [sic]: 1 wife: 3 sons; 1 daughter; 1 snaphaen [flint-lock]; Cape District\n\nA month after his marriage to Sara van Solor, the free burgher Claas Gerritsz van Bengale purchased the slave named Pieter van Madagascar from the English slave trader Will Deeron for Rds 55 on 26 April 1686.Pieter was 20 years of age.\n\nThe family appears in the muster roll for 1692:\n\nClaas Gerrits 1 man\n\nSara van Ceylon [sic] 1 wife\n\n3 sons [Meyndert, Gerrit & Hendrik]\n\n1 daughter [Henriette]\n\n1 adult male slave [ie Pieter van Madagascar]\n\n1 flintlock\n\n1 rapier\n\nCape District\n\nThe family appears again in the muster roll for 1695 (no. 286):\n\nClaas Gerritsz van Bengale died in 1697 leaving a house and erf valued at f 3 000. There were 2 slaves in the estate who were sold for Rds 79 each and 2 flint-locks sold for f 36. According to Anna Böeseken, the …plates for daily use were made of tin; the iron pots were used for cooking. There were a mirror and a painting on the wall. Claas Gerritsz and his family must have been hospitable people, for there were 32 “tea-cups” and 38 saucers. The assets of the estate amounted to f 4000, after subtraction of the debts which came to f 247:10. The inventory was signed on 5 November 1697. At the time of his death, his children were the following ages:\n\nHendriette Claas – 23\n\nMeijndert Claas – 16\n\nGerrit Claas – 11\n\nHendrik Claas – 10.\n\nHis widow remarried in 1698 Herman Buys who hailed from Batavia and appears to have been a mestizzo or ‘half-caste’. She obtained a divorce from her second husband in 1707 because he ill-treated her and her children from a previous marriage. Buys had illegitimate children by the slave woman Diana van Trankebar.\n\nAfter her divorce Sara van Solor was granted an erf in Table Valley [Block A] the size of which was 9 r 120′ (ie 140,4 sq. m) on 20 January 1709 with the right to occupation for 16 years. The property was adjacent to the property of her first husband. Again on 22 September 1713 she was given a second grant, an erf in Table Valley in Block A, the size of which was 3 r 123′ (ie 55,0 sq. m) with similar conditions of occupation as the previous grant. Land grants to free blacks were rare in early Cape colonial society. Clearly she was still being favourably treated.\n\nHer divorced husband was still in the neighbourhood as we find him baptising two slave children on 10 March 1709:\n\nTwe Slave-kinderen van Harmen Buijs. de moeder was Diana van Krankebaar [sic]; de Getuigen Moses van Macassar; en Sara van Macassar – 1. Sara; 2. Pieter\n\nGenealogy\n\nThe genealogy appears in the main text under Claas Gerrits(z) van Bengale.\n\nPRIMARY SOURCES\n\n1.
