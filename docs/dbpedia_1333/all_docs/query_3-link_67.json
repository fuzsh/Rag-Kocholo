        "text": "In light of Lesbian Visibility day (April 26th 2021), we are honouring Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Non-Binary, Intersex, Queer, and straight ally women role models.\n\nThe women on this list are all nominated by colleagues and members from the Workplace Pride community. Some companies have shared many names, and in one particular company, there was clearly a team effort to nominate the same colleague multiple times!\n\nThe list is inspired by initiatives such as the “DIVA 100” and similar initiatives. As this is our first year, we are certain there are many great role models missing. So we hope that next year we’ll have a much longer and even more diverse list as well as representation for as many of our member organisations as possible. Having said that, let’s honour these fantastic women!\n\nWe encourage you to think of the LGBTIQ+ women and allies in your organisation and honour them too this week!\n\nThere are also various activities this week. In recognition of Lesbian Visibility Week, Workplace Pride is joining forces with our strategic partner, Catalyst for our latest “Keeping Members Connected” webinar entitled “Intersectionality – Rising to the challenge to be yourself at work” on the 29th of April.\n\nFor a list of other activities by many organisations see\n\nLVW EVENTS 2021 | Lesbian Visibility lesbianvisibilityweek.com\n\nLater in the year, as part of our Workplace Pride Leadership Awards Gala, we will also pay tribute to the entire LGBTIQ+ community world-wide. We want to use the same formula then; further information will follow later in the year.\n\nThe list is in purely alphabetical order :\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nH\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nS\n\nT\n\nV\n\nW"
