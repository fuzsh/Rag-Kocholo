It's a violent and remorseless underworld. No wonder then that, when most of us think of anti-poaching units, we picture armed men ready for combat. But just outside the town of Hoedspruit, we meet a group of rangers with a very different approach. They're called the Black Mambas and they're the world's first all-female anti-poaching unit. Trained to be the eyes and ears of the bush, the Mambas have reduced poaching incursions by 62% in the Greater Kruger where they operate. Remarkably, they've been able to achieve that without a single shot fired. We meet the inspiring group of women taking on the dangers of the bush unarmed.

On the surface, Randolf Jorberg - with his bright yellow t-shirt, sunglasses and newly dyed yellow beard - is an eccentric character. But on the streets of Cape Town, he’s a well-known business owner who used to run one of the best beer houses on Long Street. In recent years, though, Randolf has been forced to retreat from the spotlight as protection rackets targeting small businesses have flourished. Cape Town has become the extortion epicentre, with violent criminal syndicates operating across the city. In 2015, Randolf refused to pay protection money. Weeks later, his doorman was assassinated. He says it was a clear message: pay up or suffer the consequences. Alleged underworld kingpins are currently on trial in the Western Cape High Court, but that hasn’t stopped their henchmen from wreaking havoc. Carte Blanche examines the underbelly of the Western Cape’s deadly extortion rackets.

The mystery around the death of 18-year-old Dylan Bothma has yet to be solved. In June last year, Dylan was beaten and later died after being hit by two cars on the R23 between Heidelberg and Balfour. On the night of his death, he attended a sweet sixteenth birthday party, but our investigation reveals that it may have been anything but an innocent party for teenagers. It has been a year since Dylan’s death and no arrests have been made. His family, battling to find closure, started their own investigation and are slowly piecing together the puzzle of Dylan’s brutal death.

A self-styled indigenous empress poised to pay out billions of rands hidden in a secret trust to the descendants of the Khoi and San in South Africa: if only it were true. But it’s not, despite what the imperial leaders have told a vast network of WhatsApp groups where they groom poor people to pledge their scarce cash to the scheme. They say the ticket to great wealth is an Aboriginal ID, purchased online. This card will supposedly help beneficiaries cash in, and give them immunity to South African law. This scam is part of a larger movement to create a Khoisan leadership class worthy of state perks and influence. We penetrate the campaign of Empress Valerie Sabina Letsie III who revealed herself in front of Parliament this week, and identify two more groups that have taken cash from people desperate to get a cut of the multi-million rand payout that’s promised in the name of their Khoisan legacy.

Derek Bezuidenhout was a gymnastics coach popular with his colleagues and students. But for ten years, Bezuidenhout allegedly physically, sexually and emotionally abused multiple gymnasts at a club in the Free State. When his alleged crimes were uncovered, he took his own life. Red flags about Bezuidenhout’s conduct started early in his career but no one believed the children, and the club failed to investigate the allegations. Now, several of Bezuidenhout’s victims are speaking out about the predator who groomed and targeted them for years while the club and the Gymnastics Federation allegedly stood idle. Carte Blanche investigates why Bezuidenhout’s alleged abuse was permitted to continue for so long.

It began as little more than a group of young boys, all belonging to the school choir, singing melodies together to pass the time. But when the boys from Hammarsdale in Sterkspruit started recording their sessions and sharing them on social media, thousands of South Africans began to take note. Then, within three years, some of the world’s biggest musicians were queuing up to share the stage with the newly-formed acapella singing sensation @thejoyofficialmusic. Now, they’re a bona fide international act, but their musical roots remain firmly in South Africa.

It’s an early Friday morning on Nahoon Beach in the Eastern Cape, and Susan Matthee and her best friend, Riana Swanepoel, are stepping outside their normal routine. Stripping off their vintage jewellery and silk scarves, Susan and Riana don their wetsuits and strap boogie boards to their wrists to catch the morning wave. And they aren’t alone. They belong to a group of dozens of women – all over 50 – who aren’t content with settling into stereotypical hobbies for the elderly. Looking for a little action and excitement, they’ve committed themselves to doing something out-of-the-box in their twilight years. They call themselves the Granny Grommets: elderly amateur boogie boarders with a taste for adventure. Carte Blanche caught some waves with these senior citizens.

It was a case out of Alaska in the United States that gained international attention back in 2019: the discovery of a memory card containing footage of a brutal murder. The man behind the horrific crime was South African, Brian Steven Smith, a newly naturalised US citizen who had documented himself strangling a native Alaskan woman to death in a hotel room. He’d later confess to the murder of another Alaskan woman a year earlier. In February, Smith was convicted on 14 charges, including two counts of murder. He now awaits his fate in a US jail. Carte Blanche tracks his journey from the streets of Komani in the Eastern Cape to his gruesome murders in Alaska.

Cybercrime and piracy are a growing problem in our country. The technology is more sophisticated than ever before, and criminals are selling stolen movies, music and television shows at a fraction of the price. Even live sports like football and rugby haven't been spared the clutches of illicit streamers. Last year, we investigated the growing piracy black market, focusing on an illegal app that provided access to hundreds of channels. We give you an update on that ongoing investigation.

In the capital city of Kyiv, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin and his team have spent months examining evidence of war crimes. Since Russia’s military invasion more than two years ago, Ukraine has been collecting exhibits and eyewitness accounts to mount a case against the Kremlin and its military forces and secure justice for thousands of civilians who have been tortured and killed in the ongoing war. Kostin is confident that it’s only a matter of time before Russia will be prosecuted for war crimes and forced to retreat from Ukraine’s borders. Carte Blanche, alongside a group of international journalists, gets a seat at the table as the high-level strategy missions highlight the plight of the Ukrainian people.

Cape fur seals are generally curious and friendly sea mammals. They are often found lazing around in Western Cape harbours and diving sites, and they’ve become a common sight on our beaches. But in recent years, there has been a significant increase in unprovoked attacks on people both in the water and onshore. Experts say this behaviour is unusual because seals usually attack only when they’re protecting their young. Now eight seals, including a pup that attacked five surfers in May this year, have tested positive for the deadly rabies virus: the first recorded cases in seals since 1981. Scientists, veterinarians and marine authorities are confounded, and companies that used to snorkel with seals have closed shop.

In March 2022, Russia did the unthinkable: Eight years after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, thousands of Russian troops crossed the border as Vladimir Putin carried out his long-standing threat to invade the country again. Chernobyl, home to the world’s most notorious nuclear power station, was captured and hundreds of people were trapped. Then Russian troops occupying the area began to withdraw. Now, more than two years since the war began, Carte Blanche goes inside the exclusion zone to examine why keeping Chernobyl out of Russian hands was critical to Ukraine’s fightback.

Originally employed by the Dutch East India Company from the 1700s to plane wood for furniture and later the railways, very few of the Knysna woodcutters remain in the trade today. But we meet the exception – a woman who learned the craft from her father and took over driving the heavy-duty delivery trucks and feeding the ravenous sawmill when she was finally old enough to get a licence. Now she’s revived this dwindling artistry to contribute to what is considered to be the first African concert violin made from indigenous yellowwood. Carte Blanche gets a taste of the glorious warm tones.

In the grip of earth’s sixth mass extinction animals and insects are dying out at rates up to 1000 times the natural average. The destruction of a hundred species a year is driven by humans. Globally scientists are worried. Carte Blanche journeys to the nuclear exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine – the heart of what has been considered the most radioactive and chemically toxic hotspot in the world, where wildlife was all but wiped out 30 years ago. But in spite of life-threatening ionising radiation, Chernobyl's wildlife is thriving. We explore the lessons to be learned when man is removed from the equation.

In a time long before the coronavirus pandemic affected almost every country in the world, one South African family decided to take on the African continent. Travelling over 47 000 km and crossing through 29 countries – through harsh deserts, and war-torn regions, while fighting off crippling illness – this foursome spent six years living the adventure of a lifetime. And they did it in a small truck, powered entirely by vegetable oil. Carte Blanche met with this family as they returned from their journey.

For years, analysts, banks and rating agencies promoted global retailer Steinhoff as a sound investment. With 40 brands under its belt, and operating in over 30 territories, the retail giant was one of the top performers on world markets. That is until the house of cards came tumbling down. Billionaire businessman and former chairman of the company, Christo Wiese, is suing Steinhoff for R59 billion. But was he really unaware of the accounting fraud and financial irregularities happening right under his nose? We put Wiese in the hot seat.

For the last five years, productivity at our ports has deteriorated, but this year it hit rock bottom. Delays over the last few months have cost the country millions in lost revenue as car manufacturers waited for parts, and citrus meant for across the world sat on the harbour for weeks. Ships fed up with our delays, bypassed the ports. The situation was so desperate that the shipping lines and freight forwarders implored the president to intervene. Now there is a new chief executive in charge of Transnet Port Terminals and she has hit the ground running, but with the country’s export reputation in tatters can she turn this huge state operation around, in time.

It’s a historical whodunit as the University of Cape Town sets out to reconnect nine skeletons, unethically obtained and housed in its vaults for over a century, with their descendants. Now, using DNA analysis and 3D facial reconstruction, scientists aim to reconstruct their faces and finally return the bones back to family members in the Karoo for reburial. Carte Blanche tracks their journey home.

Optimum Mines, bought by the Guptas in 2016 in a controversial deal, has hardly been out of the headlines and now after a lethal gas explosion in one of the shafts, Optimum is back in the news. The mine has been stripped and is in disarray, workers haven’t been paid and rescue operations have been delayed by unsafe conditions underground. What’s gone wrong? In a frank interview, business rescue practitioner Louis Klopper reveals the machinations behind the scenes and how the Guptas are still trying to pull the strings of this Mpumalanga asset.
