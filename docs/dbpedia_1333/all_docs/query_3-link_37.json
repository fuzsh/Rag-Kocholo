Apartheid: Irony and the ‘pseudo-traditional organisational complex’\n\n3. Post-apartheid: From irony to nostalgia, romanticism and cynicism\n\n4. Lost irony\n\nMusic, movements and society\n\nIn December 2006 a crowd congregated for a rock show in Stilbaai, a predominantly white and Afrikaans holiday town. Zinkplaat, a band from Stellenbosch, performed before the main act, Bok van Blerk. According to an eye witness, the crowd pelted Zinkplaat with bottles. They wanted to hear Bok van Blerk sing his hit song ‘De la Rey’. Members of the crowd proceeded to sing ‘Die Stem’, the ‘national’ anthem of apartheid South Africa of yore. When Bok van Blerk got onto the stage, he told the crowd that De la Rey was ‘inside each of them’. Commenting on the De la Rey fad, Bertie Coetzee, a member of Zinkplaat wrote the following:\n\nI met Bok when we performed with him in Stilbaai. I like him a lot, but I can’t get my head around what he is doing, and the storm that is brewing around him. That evening the crowd spontaneously sang a version of ‘Die Stem’ immediately after our show. ‘Stop your crap, this is the new South Africa,’ the MC had shouted into the microphone just before he was cut off by the sound man. I also felt like that…1\n\nSince the launching of the song and its slick video showing Afrikaner women and children as victims in concentration camps and men in trenches and on horseback, the De la Rey phenomenon has led to a number of appraisals in the popular media. Two positions seem to have emerged: an optimistic reading and a pessimistic reading.\n\nThe main proponents of the optimistic reading are Tim du Plessis, editor of the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Rapport, and Koos Kombuis, one of the main figures in the Voëlvry movement of the late-1980s. Both see the popularity of the song as evidence for a new Afrikaner identity emerging – one that deals with issues of guilt and provides a more self-confident basis for challenging the many failures of the post-apartheid state. Du Plessis blames the ANC government for creating the conditions of uncertainty (including the perceived targeting Afrikaans names only for name changes) under which Afrikaners are seeking a new unity:\n\nPeople are feeling more assertive than before. As if they want to say: we are fed-up with being singled out as the only scapegoat for all the evils of SA’s racist past. Was it only white Afrikaners who benefited from apartheid? Is our whole history sullied and compromised? Did we do only bad things? We feel as if we are constantly being delegitimised and we are gatvol… Afrikaners are merely migrating to a new space. It’s a natural, spontaneous process without the erstwhile marshals of the Nat party, the Broederbond and the Afrikaans churches… It’s not the dead-end radicalism of the Boeremag, but it’s also not ANC co-option personified by the acquiescent presence of Marthinus van Schalkwyk in the Mbeki cabinet… They had no choice but to become new South Africans. Now they want to be new Afrikaners.2\n\nInitially Kombuis had been sceptical about the song and its impact, but changed his view after he had met with Bok van Blerk on the latter’s request. He now sees the phenomenon as part of a new struggle against a corrupt and elitist government.3 As he writes:\n\nAs with Voëlvry back then, the movement has a spokesman; yes, it is this somewhat astonished, bruised, unwilling face of Bok van Blerk which the front adorns pages of our magazines. Like Kerkorrel back then. Again, the youth have something to say. The far-rightwing want to steal the energy, that is true, but before we judge too harshly, think about this: at least everyone has forgotten about the pathetic bunch of Idols winners.4\n\nBoth Du Plessis and Kombuis recognise the impact of the song on the Afrikaner ‘right-wing’, but underplay its significance. They point to the fact that Van Blerk removed an old South African flag from his guitar when a fan attempted to attach it to the instrument and said that there was a need to ‘move on.’5 The singer also maintains that it is not his responsibility if people wave old South African flags at his performances, likening his predicament to the Springboks who face criticism because of old flags being waved at their matches. Nevertheless, the fact that Van Blerk met with one of the leaders of the Boeremag and publicly stated that he would be willing to play for the organisation, as long as they pay him, does send out mixed signals.6\n\nIndeed, veteran journalist Max du Preez has a more pessimistic reading. He explains part of the popularity of the song by the audiences not experiencing it as referring to the Anglo-Boer War, but to current conditions where the main enemy is a government that is perceived to be black and hostile to Afrikaners:\n\nThere’s not a word about black people in it. And while the song is in no way racist, it manifests itself – when young people stand there – when they sing about how nasty the British were to the Boer women in the concentration camps, and how general come and lead us, we will fall around you, they’re not thinking about the British, they’re thinking about black, the enemy is now black.7\n\nDu Preez does not seem to have a problem with the song itself. His comments mainly relate to the public performance of members of the crowds who congregate to wave old South African flags. What does the massive popularity of the song mean for how we understand Afrikaner identity in post-apartheid South Africa? Is there a new wave of Afrikaner nationalism? If so, how do we understand this in light of other forms of mobilisation around ‘race’ and ethnicity?8 Do these mobilisations warrant concern that the so-called ‘miracle’ of the transition from apartheid might unravel and cause higher levels of violence than those currently associated with crime?\n\nThe waning of Afrikaner nationalism in the late-1980s led to a decline in academic interest on the topic as well. With the transition to democracy, related questions such as the ‘race-class’ debate also took a back seat in favour a more policy-oriented approach.9 Hence, this seeming resurgence of Afrikaner nationalism in the South Africa of the 2000s has caught many South Africanist scholars by surprise. Some scholars did comment on the demise of Afrikaner nationalism as such. Francis Fukuyama linked it to the rise of a cosmopolitan culture among Afrikaners from the 1980s onwards.10 More interestingly, and based on actual research, Jon Hyslop linked the ‘capitulation’ of apartheid’s supporters to the rise of post-Fordist consumption and the demise of the influence of what he termed the ‘pseudo-traditional organisational complex’, which included the state, churches, the army and the schools that had created an insular Afrikaner world since the economic successes of the 1960s.11\n\nNevertheless, Herman Giliomee’s most recent reappraisal of the history of the Afrikaners has shed new light on the matter. Giliomee pointed out that there had always been more enlightened versions of Afrikaner nationalism, and that the main concern was less about oppressing other people than about the survival of a people.12 The merit of Giliomee’s argument aside, what is curious though, as Pat Hopkins points out, is the fact that Giliomee paid no attention whatsoever to one of the most significant cultural movements in the history of the Afrikaners, namely the Voëlvry movement of the late-1980s.13\n\nAssessing the impact of a cultural product such as a song on processes of identity formation and forms of political mobilisation is no straightforward matter. How songs are received (or rejected) and interpreted (or not interpreted) by audiences is hard to research. The aim of this paper is more modest. It merely attempts to understand the shifts that have occurred in Afrikaans popular music since Voëlvry, and to understand how lyrics embody changing ways of reflecting on the past and mobilising cultural symbolism. Specific attention is paid to rock music, since most of the lyrical innovation took place within this genre. Since Koos Kombuis presents Bok van Blerk as the new Johannes Kerkorrel, what are the links between Voëlvry and De la Rey?\n\nMy academic training as a sociologist specialising in labour movements is somewhat inadequate for the task of answering this question. Nevertheless, I hope some of my insights gained as a ‘participant observer’, as a member of an Afrikaans rock band, makes up for this shortcoming. I am also flouting `anthropologists’ advice not to study one’s own tribe. But most interesting studies of Afrikaner nationalism that I am aware of were done by non-Afrikaans speakers who often do not grasp the subtleties of language and cultural references. Most neo-Marxist analyses suffer from this limitation and have tended to reduce shifts in politics to structural changes such as changes in dominancy among ‘class fractions’.14\n\nFor this paper my method is a limited one – essentially that of discourse analysis. I do not attempt to relate the content of lyrics to the structural shifts mentioned above. Nor do I deny the importance of an understanding of material conditions for shifts in discourse and culture. I am merely interested to trace the symbolic lineage of the outcome of the De la Rey phenomenon, and how this relates to the symbolism of Afrikaner nationalism as expressed in popular music.\n\nApartheid: Irony and the ‘pseudo-traditional organisational complex’\n\nIn spite of valuable contributions on the significance of the Voëlvry movement15, there is dire need for a comprehensive history of Afrikaans music. The industry is characterised by its small scale and allows little room for experimentation. Profitable projects are generally based on economies of scale, or alternatively charging high prices in exclusive venues. Since the mainstream in Afrikaans music is so painfully mainstream anything that is remotely off the beaten ‘backtrack’ is usually described as ‘alternative’ or ‘underground’. Indeed, the first successful response to the mainstream came from the musiek en liriek [music and lyric] movement from the late seventies onwards. People like Koos du Plessis and Jannie du Toit wanted to create quality Afrikaans music – music with a message. They succeeded in doing this, and the growing Afrikaner middle class became the main market for their songs. This movement had very little political content though, and actually sat quite comfortably with the Afrikaner nationalist project of the time. It gave middle class Afrikaners the respectability they sought after.\n\nThere were exceptions. Anton Goosen and David Kramer successfully penetrated this market, but their protest songs often were too subtle to make a large-scale impact. Hard-hitting songs were censored by the state apparatus. Very few of Kramer’s fans knew that ‘Skipskop’ was a song about a community that made way for a missile testing facility, or that Anton Goosen’s ‘Atlantis’ was about the forced removals from District Six. Coenie de Villiers criticised the army, and Amanda Strydom was ostracised when she dared to shout ‘Amandla’ at the end of a show.\n\nThe first real protest movement emerged from the underground clubs and theatres of Johannesburg – places such as the Black Sun and Jameson’s. Performances were deeply political and condemned the apartheid regime in no uncertain terms. The following extract from a lyric, based on the tune of ‘What a friend we have in Jesus’, illustrates the subversive nature of the project:\n\nWat ŉ vriend het ons in PW,\n\nVlok en Heunis en Malan.\n\nHul hou ons land vir ons so veilig,\n\nKommuniste is verban ...16\n\nBut to make a broader impact, the movement had to emerge from the underground and go popular. James Phillips (reinvented as Bernoldus Niemand), André Letoit (who soon changed his name to Koos Kombuis) and Johannes Kerkorrel embarked on a national tour – the Voëlvry Toer in 1988/9.17\n\nVoëlvry represents an ironic phase in Afrikaans music. Instead of destroying the symbols of Afrikaner nationalism, irony was used to expropriate them for a different project. The ox wagon was changed into a ‘funky nuwe rock & roll ossewa [a funky new rock ‘n roll oxwagon]’ 18 by Kerkorrel, and the Voortrekker Monument was painted neon (it was the eighties!). The institutions that annoyed the more cosmopolitan segments of the Afrikaner middle class, what Hyslop has called the pseudo-traditional organisational complex, were knocked – the church, authoritarian schools, the state broadcasting corporation and above all conscription and the army. The fact that all this came from people singing in Afrikaans caught the Botha regime completely off-guard.\n\nIn his song ‘Boer in Beton [Boer (farmer, but also Afrikaner) in Concrete]’, a song about Afrikaners in the city – in this case Pretoria – André Letoit refers to several symbols of the Afrikaner nationalist project, including Paul Kruger, JG Strydom and HF Verwoerd, but these symbols become deeply ironic, since they do not represent the condition of urban Afrikanerdom any longer:\n\nEk rook ingevoerde fags\n\nEk lees Engelssprekende mags\n\nEk gaan nooit kerk toe nie\n\nWant dis ‘n drag19\n\nBernoldus Niemand also ripped Pretoria off as the quintessential node of apartheid compliance and administration. He described it as ‘Snor City [Moustache City]’, where people listen to country music and drive in their ‘Ford Snortina’s’, a combination of Cortina and the Afrikaans word for moustache.20 The following extract from the lyric of ‘Tronk’ [Jail] by Johannes Kerkorrel represents the suburbs where Afrikaner children grew up as a jail:\n\nin die tronk\n\nis dit ’n gewone dag\n\nin die tronk\n\nnet soos elke ander dag\n\nin die tronk\n\nhoor jy laat in die nag\n\ndie honde blaf\n\nlaat in die nag\n\ndie honde blaf21\n\nBarking watchdogs are typical of South African suburbs. He sings about ‘brains’ and ‘thoughts’ that are locked in chains – the inability to break out of the constraints of the pseudo-traditional organisational complex of Afrikaner nationalism. In ‘Ry’ [Ride], he sings about the need to escape from suburban life, and the snobbery and class consciousness of middle-class life in the suburbs:\n\nDaar is dié wat jou vertel jy mag nie op jou motorfiets ry nie\n\nJy moet jou plek altyd ken, jy moet die kos eet wat jy kry\n\nParty is ryk, party sal vir altyd arm bly,\n\nparty sal aan die verkeerde kant\n\nvan die treinspoor agterbly …\n\nEk het jare lank na ’n pad\n\nuit die dorp gesoek\n\nlangs die spoor gestaan en gekyk hoe die treine ry\n\nek het gesien hulle kom\n\nek het gesien hulle gaan\n\nen ek het gewag en geweet\n\n’n kaartjie kom om saam te gaan …22\n\nSuburban life was also a key theme is the music of Koos Kombuis. In ‘Lady van die Bodorp’ [Lady from Uptown], he mocks the cultured existence of middle-class Afrikaners:\n\nEk kuier in jou voorhuis\n\ntussen mikrogolwe se gesuis\n\njou pa rook pyp, jou ma is kuis\n\nen each status symbol’s in its place\n\njulle kennis en kultuur die wys\n\nin elke meubelstuk se prys\n\njou broer studeer nou in Parys\n\njou ouma maak groentesop en vleis\n\ndie bediende is ’n mental case\n\nin die nuutherontwerpte houtkombuis.23\n\nOn an even grittier note, he sings in ‘Paranoia in Parrow-Noord’ [Paranoia in Parrow-North]\n\nEk weet ek is verslaaf aan drank\n\nek is oortrokke by die bank\n\nmy dogter is ’n boere-punk\n\nmaar dank God ek’s ten minste blank …24\n\nKerkorrel’s ‘Energie [Energy]’ applied broad sarcastic brush strokes when he sang about how Afrikaners’ lives were regulated:\n\nJy moet staan in jou ry\n\nJy moet jou hare kort sny\n\nJy moet altyd netjies bly\n\nJy moet al die pryse kry\n\nJy moet altyd netjies bly\n\nTrou en kinders kry\n\nIn jou karretjie ry\n\nEn stem vir die party25\n\nAnother of the artists of the Voëlvry era, Randy Rambo, also explored the pathologies of suburban life:\n\nOns huis is massief en ons kar baie blink\n\nOns swembad is groot en die tuinjong so flink\n\nDie dahlias blom mooi en die kinders is soet\n\nHulle hou ons naam hoog as hul oom dominee hoflik groet …26\n\nApart from suburban life, the army as a source of irritation among Afrikaners, and white South Africans in general, was explored, often with a deep sense of irony. Koos Kombuis sang about the bar on the station in De Aar, where soldiers on their way to the ‘border’ had to pass through:\n\nEen ou lê onder\n\nEen ou lê bo\n\nMaar ek lê langs my cherry\n\nOp die Transkaroo\n\nDie seats stink na rubber\n\nEk walg in my hangover\n\nEn ek dink terug aan laasnag\n\nToe ek ure moes wag …\n\nIn die Bar op De Aar sit ons almal bymekaar\n\nEn ons wag op die trein na wie-weet-waar …\n\nBriewe van êrens met posstempels van nêrens\n\nBosse en gille, koffie slaappille\n\nMet ’n botteltjie blou wat my twee jaar moet hou …27\n\nThe ‘letters from somewhere’ with ‘stamps from nowhere’ refer to the fact that the apartheid regime denied at the time that they were involved in military operations in Angola.\n\nBernoldus Niemand’s ‘Hou My Vas, Korporaal’ [Hold Me Tight, Corporal] became an anthem for the End Conscription Campaign:\n\nHou my vas, Korporaal, ek’s ‘n kind skoon verdwaal\n\nGaan ek weer my cherry sien, as ek van die trein af klim?\n\nJa, sowaar, Korporaal, dis maar swaar, Korporaal\n\nEk speel oorlog met my beste dae…28\n\nKerkorrel also sang songs about the army, but in this case the army doing ‘riots’ in the townships. The following lyric was penned by Marianne de Jongh:\n\nMaar vannag gooi ek my geweerband weg\n\nen ek haal my gordel af\n\nas dit donker is, as almal slaap\n\nis ek voor jou deur en ek wag\n\nEn sing die ou ou lied van Afrika\n\nsing dit sag, sing dit lank vir my\n\nmaak oop jou hart, maak oop jou deur\n\nlaat my binnekom, laat my bly.\n\nBlaas uit die kers draai jou kopdoek los\n\nek het lankal my tent vergeet\n\nlaat ons mond aan mond en lyf aan lyf\n\nlaat ons vry en vir altyd wees.29\n\nThe love scene between the soldier and the inhabitant of the township is most probably what makes this song so subversive. Like the ‘De la Rey’ song, it ends with military drums, but in this case, the drums are profoundly ironic.\n\nKombuis also explored issues of love across the ‘colour line’, which was illegal up until 1984. The following in an extract from ‘Coca Cola Nooi’ refers to the Cape Flats, where most of the ‘coloured’ ghettos were located:\n\nToe vat ek jou na ’n wrede straat\n\nmet graffiti teen die mure en haat\n\nsnags is daar bendes en polisie wat baklei\n\nmaar steeds klou jy soos ’n label aan my sy\n\nsome say love it is a river\n\nmaar hier is saamwees stomper as ’n razor\n\nhow’s your handle mate, rook nog ’n pyp\n\nwant die’s mos die flipside van die Fairest Cape.30\n\nA part of Voëlvry’s success can be attributed to their voicing the smouldering irritation with apartheid’s grip on the personal freedom of Afrikaners. No wonder that it toured university campuses. But its success also imposed a limitation. It never penetrated the working class, and stayed clear of the townships – physically, as well as in terms of most of its lyrical content. The problem with apartheid was what it was doing to ‘us’ – alternative (but middle class) Afrikaners. The symbols and institutions of Afrikaner nationalism became objects of irony. Afrikaner nationalism was turned on its head, and in elite circles it became fashionable to be an ‘alternative’ Afrikaner. In a sense, the Voëlvry movement provided for an ethnic project without the ethnic politics. Yet, the foundation of this was a critique of what apartheid did to the ‘self’, not the ‘other’, which was present in the lyrics of the movement, but somewhat marginal. As Grundlingh argues:\n\nThe embryonic but palpable sense of imminent change and the appeal to new Afrikaner cultural and political sensibilities as well as the enthusiastic following it attracted certainly gave Voëlvry the appearance of a social movement. But the case should not be overstated. It failed to evolve beyond protest music, lacked wider connections, and did not inspire their followers to express themselves in unambiguous and meaningful political terms. At best it can be described as a moderate to weak social movement.31\n\nPost-apartheid: From irony to nostalgia, romanticism and cynicism\n\nWith the end of apartheid, the ironic phase came to an end. James Phillips died, and Kerkorrel and Kombuis consciously became part of the mainstream – to varying degrees of success. For a while Valiant Swart and Paul Riekert’s Battery 9 kept the scene alive. But no-one was prepared for the explosion in Afrikaans music that happened from the mid-nineties onwards at places like Oppikoppi and the Afrikaans arts festivals.\n\nHow do the current waves of Afrikaans music relate to the protest tradition of the past? I would argue that three strands have emerged. These strands are constructed around nostalgia (a longing for an innocent past), romanticism (escapism constructed around a denial of the negative aspects of life in South Africa), and cynicism (a critique of the direction of post-apartheid society, but without plausible programmes of action). In practice they are not mutually exclusive. What makes Bok van Blerk so successful, I would argue, is that he incorporates elements of each of these strands and combines it with a programme of action, even though this programme is somewhat vague.\n\nThe nostalgics converge in bars where popular singers do medleys of Koos Kombuis tunes, but without the irony. They sing along to traditional Afrikaans songs. Their t-shirts say: ‘100% Boer’ or ‘Praat Afrikaans of hou jou bek’ [Speak Afrikaans of shut up]. The fact that the protest singers made it cool to be Afrikaans again suits them well, but they nostalgically long for a past without crime and affirmative action. Many of them are too young to remember this presumed carefree past.32\n\nThe romantics play good solid rock, but their lyrics are about parties, love, booze, drugs, and sometimes our beautiful country. They build on the rock tradition of the protest singers, but see no need for protest. They are upwardly mobile consumers and not interested in politics. The Afrikaans media calls them the ‘Zoid generation’.\n\nThe cynics celebrate their marginality and sing about crime, emigration, poverty, and the new fat cats in government. They keep some of the irony of the protest music of the eighties, but mostly complain about how things are going wrong. Some are tired of feeling guilty about apartheid. After all, they did not go to the army, nor did they decide to spend billions on a crooked arms deal. An example would be Riku Lätti and Jean Marais from the band 12Hz:\n\nek’s bly jy’s bevry\n\nnou kan jy en jou pelle in ’n groot kar ry\n\nkyk na my\n\nry verby\n\nlyk bevry\n\nals goed in jou neighbourhood\n\nmet jou sestienkamerwoning is nou in jou bloed\n\neet vrek goed\n\ndrink sterk goed\n\nrobin hood se voet\n\nin jou suit\n\nwonder hoe jy jou comrades groet …33\n\nThen there is the immensely popular song ‘Nie Langer’ [No Longer] from the band Klopjag:\n\nHou op geld mors op naamsveranderings,\n\ndaar is mense sonder huise en kinders sonder kos,\n\nwie is nou die sondebok?34\n\nEk sal agter in die tou staan\n\nmy reenboog op my mou dra,\n\nmaar ek sal nie langer jammer sê nie.35\n\nDie Melktert Kommissie sing in their song ‘Proudly South African’:\n\nToi-toi-toi toys are us,\n\ndaar word met ons gespeel,\n\ndeur mense van hoër,\n\nklasse is oorvol,\n\nmaar die kosblikke bly leeg,\n\nen almal vreet net politics,\n\nin plaas van aanbeweeg.36\n\nBy far the most interesting of the successful rock acts is Fokofpolisiekar [Fuck Off Police Car]. The surprising element of this band is that they still express alienation from life in the suburbs, and particularly seem to have a gripe against the continued role played by Afrikaans organised religion. The following comes from one of their most popular songs, ‘Hemel op die Platteland’ [Heaven in the Rurals]:\n\nKan iemand dalk ‘n god bel\n\nen vir hom sê ons het hom nie meer nodig nie\n\nkan jy apatie spel?\n\nreguleer my, roetineer my\n\nplaas my in ‘n boks en merk dit veilig\n\nstuur my dan waarheen al die dose gaan\n\nstuur my hemel toe ek dink dis in die platteland.37\n\nBut Fokofpolisiekar have also been exploring issues of guilt, and express an irritation with guilt accorded to them due to the ‘sins’ of previous generations:\n\nmy skoene is deur vroue slawe\n\nin die verre-ooste gemaak\n\ndis nie my skuld nie ...\n\nmy vriende se bediendes het hulle\n\nmet liefde groot gemaak\n\ndis nie my skuld nie\n\nek herinner myself aan my pa\n\nhulle moes grens toe gaan\n\ndis nie my skuld nie ...38\n\nHere the army is something in the lives of their fathers. Most recently, I their song ‘Brand Suid-Afrika’ [Burn South Africa], they sing:\n\nLandmyne van skuldgevoelens,\n\nin ‘n eenman-konsentrasiekamp,\n\njy kla oor die toestand van ons land,\n\nwel fokken doen iets daaromtrent,\n\nbrand Suid-Afrika.39\n\nWhat these lyrics show is that there have been attempts by Afrikaans songwriters to engage with current political uncertainties. They have a critique of state failures and their being scapegoated for the sins of previous generations. However, they have not expressed these irritations as a new ethnic project. To be sure, they see themselves as part of a South Africa and want to contribute on the terms of a new identity and a sense of self-worth.\n\nLost irony\n\nIn spite of some innovation in lyrical content, there is still a limitation to this project. Like the Voëlvry movement, it fails to move beyond a consideration for the ‘other’, and in that sense, a transcendence of the narrow politics of the ‘self’. David Kramer criticised Afrikaans rock for its denial of the multiplicity of origins of Afrikaans language and culture:\n\nIn die afgelope 30 jaar probeer ek in party van my songs sê dat bruin en swart mense óók Afrikaans praat en dat hulle óók op die plaas gebly het … Wat my altyd die moer in gemaak het, was dat alhoewel hulle 'n groot deel van my lewe was, was hulle altyd ‘invisible’. Hulle was nie deel van ons geskiedenis nie. Ek dink die Afrikaanse/Boeremusiek het seker dieselfde geskiedenis as Afrikaans. En dit lyk vir my asof die oplewing van die ‘ou liedjies’ weer gebruik word as ‘n kulturele glue vir die boere, sonder erkenning van die oorsprong of bydrae van daai deel vannie familie.40\n\nKramer criticises the musical style more so than the lyrics:\n\nI don’t find ‘alternative’ Afrikaans music interesting. The problem is not so much with the lyrics as with the music. This borrowing of the blues/rock/punk idiom is so tired and such an easy option… If we look at a genre like rock, then I’d say that what was once fresh, exciting and alternative (within the Western context, particularly America) became stale and clichéd a long time ago. That the so-called alternatives use rock (in a broad sense) as the musical vehicle for their lyrical expression is what I find particularly boring. Particularly in the light of our recent emancipation and the current state of American politics… So a kind of inbreeding occurs and a constant reworking of an idea that is so far removed from its source it becomes anaemic. So much of the music is bloodless and pretentious. Or nostalgic for a fictitious, happier time.41\n\nHis own projects are an attempt to move beyond the constraints of Afrikaner music towards Afrikaans music in the true sense of the word – a music that transcends ‘race’ as a defining category. He explains:\n\n[F]or me, the blikviool is not nostalgic, but a discovery and a confirmation of my premise about the roots of this music. It is a raw, exciting sound with the unique voice of the Kammiesberge or the Koue Bokkeveld. It is real and exists and it is played and enjoyed and danced to. It is connected to a painful history, and when you hear it, it sings of the past and the present and it is as jagged and as fucked as the musician playing it. And when you hear it, ‘dan is jou bloed soos ‘n snaar’ and you know in your being because you were born here and because you are human that this is not someone else’s shoes, this is not hillbilly waltzes or bluegrass.42\n\nThis inability of Afrikaans music, with all its irony and reworking of the symbols of Afrikaner nationalism, to transcend definitions of the ‘self’, I would argue, is the context in which Bok van Blerk’s ‘De la Rey’ was launched. The difference in the way the song is appropriated is that it now provides for a programme of ethnic mobilisation. Indeed, a number of Afrikaner organisations have claimed the song for their programmes, including Solidariteit, the FAK, and the Boeremag.\n\nBut since the argument here rests on an analysis of lyrics, it may be prudent to show how the ‘De la Rey’ song works with nostalgia, romanticism, and indeed, a deep sense of cynicism. The song refers to the Anglo-Boer War, or the Second Freedom War, as it is known in Afrikaner nationalist accounts of history. It recalls the scorched earth policies of Kitchener, and turns the smouldering house and farm into a fire that burns within the heart of the Boer:\n\nen my huis en my plaas tot kole verbrand\n\nsodat hulle ons kan vang\n\nmaar daai vlamme en vuur\n\nbrand nou diep, diep binne my43\n\nThe lyric recalls the nostalgia surrounding notions of suffering during the Anglo-Boer War. The song has to go far back indeed to find a moment when Afrikaners can be presented as victims. The romanticism lies in the notion of the Boerekryger – the Boer warrior – in the person of De la Rey:\n\nMaar die hart van ŉ Boer\n\nlê dieper en wyer\n\nhulle gaan dit nog sien.\n\nOp 'n perd kom hy aan\n\ndie Leeu van die Wes-Transvaal.44\n\nFinally, the cynicism lies in the fact that the call to arms – during the Anglo-Boer War, as any call to arms of Afrikaners in the current historical period – is futile. Taking up arms can only lead to defeat.\n\nDe la Rey, De la Rey\n\nsal jy die Boere kom lei?\n\nDe la Rey, De la Rey\n\nGeneraal, Generaal\n\nsoos een man sal ons om jou val\n\nGeneraal De La Rey45\n\nThe line ‘soos een man sal ons om jou val’ – the promise, or even the inevitability of being slain alongside the General, is seemingly the only hope the authors of the lyric could find. This is a hopeless promise, and deeply cynical indeed. In addition, the word ‘Boer’ redraws a stark line around identity, inextricably linked to whiteness. The irony of being a ‘Boer in beton’ fades into the past. Nevertheless, it is because the Voëlvry movement has rehabilitated those symbols that their successors can now present their new identity project as legitimate in the realm of popular culture. But this re-appropriation of the symbols of Afrikaner nationalism, it seems, has lost al its irony. It is nostalgic, romantic, and deeply cynical at the same time.\n\n1. “Ek het vir Bok ontmoet en ons het saam met hom opgetree in Stilbaai.

I refer here to the mobilization of ethnic symbolism in contestations over leadership (the so-called succession battle) between Thabo Mbeki and his rivals, notably Jacob Zuma, as well as the (not unrelated) contestation over leadership positions in the Congress of South African Trade Union (COSATU) involving the federation’s president Willy Madisha, and the drama around the election of Frans Baleni as the general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Indeed, ‘succession battles’ involving ethnic mobilization also happened at the building blocks of the NUM – its branches.

In the past 30 years I have tried to say in some of my songs that brown and black people also speak Afrikaans and that they also lived on the farm… What always pissed me off was that, although they had were a great part of my life, they had always been invisible. They were not part of our history. I think Afrikaans/Boeremusiek (Boer music) has the same history as Afrikaans. And it seems to me that the revival of the ‘old songs’ is used again as cultural glue for the boers (Afrikaners), without recognising the contribution to the origins or contribution frm that part of the family.
