        "text": "This paper discusses, a systematic method for establishing and maintaining an effective training program that meets the requirements and expectations of road traffic law enforcers (Metropolitan Police and Traffic Officers) as per (South African Police Service Act 68 of 1995 & National Road Traffic Act 39 of 1996 and National Road Traffic Regulation, 2000). The systematic approach to road traffic law enforcers training includes a professional approach that is distinct, yet interrelated, in phases. These phases include analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Road traffic law enforcement training focus amongst other on outcome based training systems such as work integrated learning, performance-based training, training system development, instructional systems development, and other similar methods. For the purpose of this paper, theoretical and practical training are interchangeable. The systematic approach method may also be used in conjunction with other train...\n\nMentoring is a mutually beneficial relationship in which a knowledgeable and skilled veteran officer (mentor) provides insight, guidance and developmental opportunities to a lesser skilled and experienced colleague (protégé).For this article mentoring is a unique interpersonal relationship between two individuals (Janasz et al. 2013: 1437).The article's main goal is to establish whether and how mentoring can be used to promote development. The key purpose of mentoring relationships is to support and challenge both parties toward their learning and development (Parsloe and Wray, 2004; Garvey, 2014). Mentoring is to connect an individual who has a lot of knowledge and experience with someone who hasn't gained the same knowledge or experience yet. Parsloe and Wray suggest that when all the theory is taken away, mentoring is still a simple one-to-one meeting held regularly to support the mentee in their ambitions to make improvements either in their personal or working life.A mentor, therefore, is a leader and a counsellor, who relates on a one-on-one basis with an individual, usually a younger person called a mentee (Akinade, 2001).S/he focuses on giving direction and imparting knowledge. The relationship should be based on mutual understanding and respect. The mentee is aware of his/her need for guidance and deliberately adopts the counsel of the mentor after careful consideration (if it is about making a personal choice). Hence, the mentor is not imposing himself/herself on the mentee. The relationship is not designed to obliterate the personality of the mentee neither is it meant to focus on the superiority of the mentor.\n\nAccording to the latest BIMCO and Drewry reports, there is a global shortage of officers for the worlds’ merchant fleet. This article focuses on the South African labour market for officers and examines some of the maritime education and training challenges facing these officers in accessing global labour markets. The paper argues that despite processes of globalisation, the nation state can still be an important actor in shaping global labour markets. Using a qualitative approach, interviews were conducted with 10 key informants in the maritime human resources management sectors in South Africa. Interview data was analysed and coded for themes using NVivo qualitative data analysis software (QSR International Pty Ltd., Version 10, London, UK). This was theoretically informed by Braun & Clarke’s six-step method of thematic analysis. This was combined with a review of labour market statistics to demonstrate that the key challenges facing South African officers are the lack of training berth availability and the lack of South African ship ownership. The solutions adopted by the state includes a limited adoption of best practices adopted by global MET institutions in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and Nigeria. The article contributes to filling the gap in empirical-based maritime studies that are located on Africa."
