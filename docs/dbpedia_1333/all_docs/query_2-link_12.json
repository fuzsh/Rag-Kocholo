Seven continents. An unprecedented quest to document and preserve our last remaining wild lands.\n\nIn more than 200 striking images, acclaimed South African photographers Peter and Beverly Pickford have created an epic, unparalleled portrait of some of our planet's most untouched places: from the heat-beaten country of Namibia's Skeleton Coast to Alaska and the Yukon's abundance of water, in ocean, river and lake; from the subantarctic islands' wind-tossed shores in the south to the Arctic's immense expanses of cracked pancake ice in the north; and the dazzling juxtaposition of desert and water in Australia's Kimberley to the remote, frozen peaks of Tibet and Patagonia. Within these extreme landscapes, Beverly and Peter's images illuminate and celebrate myriad forms of life: polar bears, rhinoceroses and bharal, as well as the humble lichen, are all evocatively pictured within the landscapes upon which they depend. This is a wildlife book like no other, its images aching with what words struggle to describe: the resonance of wilderness in our inner being, the power of land to transform our emotion, and our ability to transcend the immediate to become sublime.\n\nWild Land's stunning images are accompanied by a fascinating text in which Peter not only vividly describes the photographers' adventures in pursuit of wild land, but also delivers a timely message that highlights the urgent need for these lands to be preserved for the future of the planet - a future on which humankind's very survival is dependent.\n\nPublication date: 2018-09-05\n\nSupplier out of stock.

His father is seriously ill; she fears he is dying. Godwin finds his country, once a post-colonial success story, descending into a vortex of violence and racial hatred. His father recovers, but over the next few years Godwin travels regularly between his family life in Manhattan and the increasing chaos of Zimbabwe, with its rampant inflation and land seizures making famine a very real prospect. It is against this backdrop that Godwin discovers a fifty-year-old family secret, one which changes everything he thought he knew about his father, and his own place in the world. Peter Godwin's book combines vivid reportage, moving personal stories and revealing memoir, and traces his family's quest to belong in hostile lands - a quest that spans three continents and half a century.\n\nPublication date: 2014-08-22\n\nSupplier out of stock.
