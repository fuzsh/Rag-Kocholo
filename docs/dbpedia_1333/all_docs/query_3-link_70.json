        "text": "Over the last four years I have had the privilege of having friends, old and new, participate in my Conversations With Hilary. I enjoy learning more about these friends and appreciate when they share tidbits of their lives, as well as their honest, funny, and personal stories from their past. It has been a thrill and honor to share these conversations with all of you; however, the following Conversations with Grant Korgan is different.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, just months after he married his wife Shawna, the girl of his dreams, Grant suffered a life altering spinal cord injury while snowmobiling in the Sierra Nevada back country. Grant Korgan was told he would never walk again. Yet despite his prognosis, he and Shawna focused on the goal of 120% recovery and on January 17, 2012, along with two seasoned explorers, Grant attempted the insurmountable, and became the first spinal cord injured athlete to literally PUSH himself ~nearly 100 miles (the final degree of latitude) to the most inhospitable place on the planet – the bottom of the glove, the geographic South Pole.\n\nWith all that is going on in the world today, Grant’s story of overcoming the impossible is uplifting, positive, and hopeful. His journey is now being made into a feature-length documentary film titled THE PUSH and it couldn’t be told at a more perfect time. The film is produced by my husband, Geoff Callan, and his partner Jeff Allard.They are currently in post production and they need our support – Please donate to the Kickstarter campaign which ends September 17th.\n\nWhat do you believe to be your greatest accomplishment? Meeting my wife, Shawna. I am proud of many things, but none more than being conscious, aware and appreciative of my ever-growing connection to Shawna through all of life’s challenging chapters. With this angelic beacon of positivity, it would seem that when the going gets tough, the tough chooses love, connection and togetherness… All that said, I do not see my wife as an accomplishment; However, all the greatest things in my life stem from the heart and mind of the graceful, inspiring and overwhelmingly giving truth in which she stands, each and every day.\n\nWhat qualities do you think others love about you?\n\nIf I had to guess what qualities others love about me, my response would probably come from the fact that I yearn to see people smile. More specifically, I get head-to-toe goosebumps when I see others standing in their greatness and rising up to give the world the highest versions of who they truly are. I am loyal (sometimes to a fault), I like a rad group dynamic, and I love cultivating and curating positive energy at all points.\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nI would be a helicopter pilot. Since I was a young man, being an EMS Care Flight pilot has been my occupational dream. In early 2010, after being the President of Nanoscience firm, publishing research in dream publications such as Nature and establishing a strong IP portfolio of international patents, I was transitioning out of active operations with my company and into flight training to fulfill my life-long dream of helping others. Days later, I was the patient laying on the floor of an EMS helicopter looking up at the pilot, as I was being rescued from the worst day of my life. To this day, my eyes mist up when I see a medical helicopter up in the sky, helping others survive the unthinkable, giving lives the chance to go from shattered back to miraculous.\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a living/career?\n\nThe breakthroughs…As a professional speaker, my life revolves around helping individuals unlock the power of positivity in their lives, via turning attitude into action. I live to see others break the old bonds controlling them, to step into their authentic truth and live a truly unbreakable life.\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nStretch. Well…drink coffee, then stretch. After recovering from a spinal cord injury, I am living in a body that does not want to move. Being committed to my physical forward movement routine begins with a pre-workout stretch regimen. Truth be told, I wake up somewhere in my 90s. After stretching I’m in my 60s. Coffee (or a Hi-ball organic energy drink) gets me into my 40s, and after a workout and shower, I am back to my natural state (the age my mind thinks I am) in my early 30s.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nDepends on the season…In the summer, my favorite Friday night would be an evening wake surfing session on Lake Tahoe, followed by dinner at Sunnyside via boat (for three decades, I’ve been sustaining a mild addiction to their zucchini sticks). In the winter, the ideal Friday night lands me at PlumpJack Cafe in Squaw Valley after an all-time day skiing on the mountain with a large group of friends. Lastly, in the spring and fall, the best Fridays consist of being on the road – speaking, traveling, working, exploring, and progressing.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nThe movies Rad, Spaceballs, and Swiss Family Robinson; ski racing; nature; moving water; stand-up jet skiing; jeeping; camping, and BMX biking. Regarding the movie watching, this is not to say I was indoors glued to the screen all the time, but the magic contained within these three films shaped my youth as an adventurer growing up on Lake Tahoe’s north shore. As a kid, I was outside from sun up til way past dark. I had no curfew, I lived in Incline Village, Nevada, and the zest of life was daily around every corner. This freedom allowed me to ride my bike, ski, explore, socialize and live a life that was full to the rim with zest and appreciation.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nI am passionate about my wife’s happiness, my dog’s health, speaking to crowds, plus adding value to lives via new mindsets, tactics, beliefs and achieving perspective-driven breakthroughs. I love sunsets, big-weather events, aviation, film making, skiing powder, Centurion wake boats, spending time on the water, spending time in the snow, Yosemite, nature, surfing ocean waves which are just a shade beyond my comfort zone, travel, reading with hot coffee in my hand, Hiball energy, island life, creating media, capturing memories, adventure vans, regaining feeling, stoking sponsors, and of course doing the work to achieve a full recovery from my 2010 spinal cord injury.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nAs a whitewater kayaker, my favorite season used to be Spring, due to my endless pursuit of the perfect waterfall – which the Sierra Mountains produce with each passing snow melt run-off cycle. Today, I am a summer lover! From surfing behind the boat on Lake Tahoe, to experiencing magical mini road trips which are close to home in our Sportsmobile camper van, the warm months in Tahoe are spectacular.\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nA Hiball organic energy drink with Titos vodka, garnished with multiple fresh lime wedges, served in a chilled a pint glass with a positive message of personal forward movement etched into it (think Pinterest). If we are talking about a non-alchoholic drink, I am probably an Arbonne protein shake with all the nutritious supplements and enzyme-rich, plant-based proteins my wife packs into our Vitamix.\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nEver since my injury in March of 2010, I have been feeling those island dubbin’ reggae vibes from artists like Stick Figure (set your Pandora to that channel and let the corners of your mouth rise), Rebelution, and others in that genre. When a high number of calories need to be burned in physical therapy, I drop into the empowering beats of The Glitch Mob. That said, I always have a soft spot in my heart for the melodies within my teenage years, which shaped my love and understanding of music – artists like Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, and The Doors to name a few.\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nListing to some of the legends that are no longer with us: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Tom Crean, Shane McConkey, Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, Steve Jobs, Jim Morrison, and Amelia Earhart.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie what would it be called?\n\nThe Push, a South Pole Adventure!! This film premiers this coming winter, 2018!! Check it out at thepushison.com\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nI have one regret in life. The moment I met my wife Shawna, I should have said, “Hi, I’m Grant, I love you, let’s spend our lives together.” Instead, I approached, took in a deep breath, and let out an awkward, “hiiiiiieeeeeeeyyyy.” And…all is well that ends well. She smiled, went in for the hug, and we were married a few short years later!\n\nDefine Freedom.\n\nAll lives devoid of paralysis – spiritually, emotionally, environmentally, geopolitically, humanitarianly and physically.\n\nWhat do you believe to be your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI was going to ask whether you wanted to know my greatest personal or professional accomplishment, but quickly realized it all ties back to the same thing. Early in my adult life, I decided that my goal in life was to positively impact as many people as possible through my work and relationships. My greatest accomplishment is my ongoing pursuit of this goal, which won’t end until this life comes to a close!\n\nWhat qualities do you think others love about you?\n\nI would like to think that the people around me in life love that I am generally happy, generous, dependable and willing to be unconventional and follow my own path. But maybe they just love that I can laugh at myself and the many jokes they all make at my expense.\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nHave a large farm or country house with a dog rescue facility.\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a living/career?\n\nI am lucky enough to get to work in the music industry, so there are obvious perks of being able to see some of the most amazingly talented musicians up close and personal. But it’s equally enjoyable to work with others who are so passionate about supporting the arts and the creative community. It’s inspiring to me to see that passion at work every day.\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nUsually check my phone, although I am now trying to give myself a few moments to think about things I am grateful for and get myself in the right mindset for the day.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nGiven that I am out so much during the week for my job, I usually like to crack open a bottle of wine and cook a nice meal with my fiancée and/or two boys before watching a movie.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nSports, music and girls…and it took me a long time to grow up.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nI am still growing up…but passionate just about one girl! I also love my two boys, Declan and Owen, and am amazed at how fast they are growing up (much faster than me).\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nThat’s a tough choice between winter (for skiing) and summer (for long days). Skiing is my favorite activity to do in life; I live to ski. But summer is just such a fun time of year, with the boys out of school and more available to do things and the long summer days leaving more time for outdoor fun.\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nA shot of really good tequila.\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nU2’s “A Beautiful Day”\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nMy family. It doesn’t happen enough. But I would ask them to invite Thomas Jefferson so I could ask him if it was OK for us to clarify the whole thing about the right to bare arms.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie, what would it be called?\n\nThe Rules Not Followed\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nI tend to correct or change anything I may have regretted in the past and therefore don’t dwell on it. This is all just a learning experience so onwards and upwards!\n\nDefine Freedom.\n\nFreedom is being able to love without fear and live without persecution.\n\nWhat are your personal core values?\n\nI value personal integrity, honesty, respect for others and seeing the best in people around me.\n\nWhat three things would you bring with you on a desert Island?\n\nMy family, my music and an endless supply of Plumpjack wine!\n\nWith the recent opening of Wildhawk, I found it fitting to feature the genius behind the cocktails, Jacques Bezuidenhout. A Johannesburg native, Jacques became captivated by the cocktail and spirits culture in London and then decided to take the great American bus adventure to discover the lay of the land. Thankfully for us, he found his favorite American city in San Francisco and officially planted roots here in 1997.\n\nJacques is a partner in both Wildhawk and Forgery, and is also a National Brand Ambassador for Partida Tequila and Campari. Both Jacques and partner Ken Luciano have worked extremely hard this past year to open two amazing bars, with one getting ready to celebrate it’s one year anniversary (Forgery) and the other celebrating its opening (Wildhawk), the future looks bright for our two bar stars.\n\nWhat do you believe to be your greatest accomplishment?\n\nFamily and friends. My relationship with my family, friends and Alexis is my best accomplishment. Without any of them, nothing else really matters. I feel in that regard I have not accomplished as much as I can. I can always be a better friend, family member, son, father, brother or partner.\n\nWhat qualities do you think others love about you?\n\nI hope my passion, generosity and sometimes my jokes.\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nI wish I had the talents to be an Architect. I have always loved the talents and creativity of Architects. Designing something and then building it – Gaudy and Frank Gehry leave beautiful marks on this world.\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a career?\n\nThe creativity and the people. I love the creative process about putting a bar idea together and then the people you work with and the people you serve bring everything together and make it special.\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nKiss Alexis good morning and then slowly try and figure out my first cup of coffee.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nThat could be many things. It could be something at home or out in a city. Usually involves either a cocktail or some food. I love our culture of food and liquids. Every day is a new adventure in food, wine and spirits.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nBasketball. I wanted to be a professional basketball player in the NBA. I loved the process of constantly shooting a ball every day and going through the process of getting better and improving.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nFood, spirits and worldly culture.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nFall. I grew up in constant beautiful summer in Johannesburg so never experienced fall until I moved, and I love it. I love fall on the East Coast. Leaves change. Food changes. Smells change. You start to feel that chill and smell wood smoke in the air.\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nA Negroni. Maybe a little misunderstood, a little bitter, but full of complexity and fun at the same time. It’s the kind of cocktail that makes you happy at any part of the day.\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nJay Z – Ain’t No love like the Heart of the City.\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nI always go back to Nelson Mandela or Madiba as he is affectionately referred to back home. I would just love to connect with such a special person. Try and understand his Grace to humanity after everything he went through.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie, what would it be called?\n\nI hope it’s a Will Farrel movie. Somewhere between Step Brothers, Semi-Pro and Other Guys, with a little sprinkle of the movie Cocktail and a small part of a River Runs Through It. So a little like a cocktail. Many small parts, all good.\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nPhilanthropy brings me great joy, so I would love to eventually run the PlumpJack Foundation. This will happen, I just need more time!\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a living/career?\n\nI am in the business of making people happy. When I came to PlumpJack to work for my brother Gavin, I never imagined I would be here 19 years later and still having so much fun! What is there not to like about the world of hospitality.\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nReflect on how many times my two toy poodles woke me during the night! Then revisit the very vivid dreams I had.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nHave dinner at my best friend Lori Puccinelli Stern’s house. She is a great cook and throws a great dinner party!\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nMaking people happy. My youngest daughter says that to me now- that she only wants to make people happy. I think that is something that has stayed with me over the years, my desire to be a people-pleaser.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nHelping people, even if it’s one person at a time. Raising my daughters to be good citizens, loving my family and friends.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nI love the fall. I love the cooler weather (I have great coats!) and that the holidays are right around the corner.\n\nWhat do you believe to be your greatest accomplishment?\n\nI am proud of three things!\n\n1. My 10 year relationship with my partner and best pal Rick Camargo. I wondered if anyone would ever want to grow old with me? He appears to be…but of course HE is NOT growing old – I am.\n\n2. I am proud of my friendships. They have endured through the years. I love being able to look at a pal and say “twenty years ago do you recall when?” I am a sentimental fart. I treasure friendships immensely.\n\n3. I shed 35 pounds this year and have managed to keep it off. I am proud of that. I took charge of my health by eating right and exercising regularly. Not an easy task when you are the “foodie chap” and one eats and drinks for a living. The key to my weight loss: drink three nights a week instead of eight, push aside the carbs, work out in the morning before you do ANYTHING else and at night, run to bed early instead of to the fridge for snacks.\n\nDo you have a prized possession?\n\nA photo of my brother Rory and my mother who passed in 1998. I was two and my brother five in the photograph. It’s one of just a few that I have of me as a wee one.\n\nWhat qualities do you think others love about you?\n\nI show up, sometimes too much. Often briefly, but I always show up.\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nI always dreamed early on that I might be an actor. The next Peter O’Toole or Michael Caine. There is still time – no?\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a career?\n\nI love that every day is different as a radio/TV/event host. There is never a dull moment. I am always on the move. This week alone: filming commercial spots for PEETS coffee; today I have a voiceover session for Infiniti of SF; later taping at Oakland Zoo; Sunday a Christmas tree lighting in Half Moon Bay; and three charity events to host, too ….and that’s just half of it. Next week I venture off to India to film a week of travel pieces for CBS-TV – so never an opportunity to get bored. Every day brings new adventure. Did I mention I am also about to launch a 10 day cruise with CRYSTAL CRUISES and my pal Chef Hubert Keller!!? See, life is one non-stop, fun filled adventure!!\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\n“Get out of my head, feet on the floor, out of my bed, embrace the day ahead and RUN or drive to the gym”.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nIdeally a date night with my partner Rick, preferably at home, cooking and watching a mindless movie; however, most Fridays I am hosting or auctioneering at a Bay Area charity event.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nI loved to sing and act. I was in all the school plays. Acting was in my young bones. I was a radio nut, too, and listened to much pop radio. BBC radio 1 was my favorite to hear “Top of the pops”! My first job was in radio. At Age 16 I read the cricket scores on County Sound Radio in Surrey.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nI still enjoy radio. I love Terry Gross on NPR and enjoy listening to BBC WORLD SERVICE. I am also a passionate fundraiser. I work with a dozen or more Bay Area charities and get a real thrill playing auctioneer. Nothing feels better than for example, at a recent fundraiser for Operation Smile saying: “Together we raised a quarter million dollars and gave a thousand children the possibility of a smile.” That’s powerful. That is my passion -fundraising and igniting that innate giving spirit in others.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nI enjoy September and October here in the Bay Area- our Indian Summer. The vineyards in wine country turn a patchwork quilt of colors. A pretty scene to drive through, and in San Francisco – my home and heart – it’s warm. It finally feels like Summer.\n\nIf you were stuck on a deserted island, what three items would you want to have with you?\n\nMy iPhone to stay connected, sun lotion so I don’t burn, and a book titled “how to survive on a desert island.”\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nThe Queen Mother (Bombay sapphire, rouge, king’s ginger & lemon bitters). Why this? Because everyone loves the Queen Mum.\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nJeff Buckley – “Hallelujah”\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nMay I have a few guests? Oscar Wilde for his wit, Robin Williams for laughs, Sting for the music, Marilyn Monroe to share secrets and Julia Child for the cooking.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie, what would it be called?\n\nNew Tales of the City by Liam Mayclem and how Armistead Maupin became a friend along the way.\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nNot today.\n\nDefine Freedom.\n\nBeing here in my hometown San Francisco and strolling down the street with my partner Rick arm-in-arm (we are not very handsy) without fear of being verbally or physically abused. And not worrying about what the neighbors think.\n\nWhat are your personal core values?\n\nBe honest. Be faithful. Be here.\n\nDo you have a prized possession?\n\nThis is gonna sound sappy but there are a few. My relationship with my mom is a possession I treasure everyday. She’s the kindest person I know – always inconveniencing herself for others.\n\nMy relationship with my coworker Sarah is another gift from above. Over the past 16 years she has stood up for me more times than I can count. And my third prized possession is my church, REALITY (in the mission). I’ve been to more than 300 churches in my lifetime and this one, hands down, is by far the very best church I’ve ever been to. It’s full of the spirit. I’ve been attending for a year and a half and 99% of the people I’ve brought have come back (atheists and Christians alike).\n\nWhat qualities do you think others love about you?\n\nWow this one is tough. It might seem odd to start with this but I like to provide value to the people that are my friends and acquaintances. I want to be a problem solver for my friends. I want to help them in their time of need. I also genuinely like people! I like to go out and meet everyone in the room if I can, I like to engage. When we meet I’m hopeful you and I will click. Lastly, if I know you are down, I will call, I will reach out, I will get you out of your house! I want you to get out of the pit, I want you to laugh and run and be silly again!\n\nIf you could do anything other than what you currently do, what would it be?\n\nProbably a full time movie maker, I’d also start my own Sirius Satellite radio station, and invent a new type of Yoga.\n\nWhat do you like most about what you do for a living/career?\n\nIn terms of my career – I’ve been with Sarah and Vinnie for 16 years now, and I can honestly say I like that every day is completely unpredictable. No matter what I’m personally dealing with, it has to take a back seat, the show must go on. But what I LOVE about my job is that people tune into us to laugh. Whether they are on their way to work, cleaning the house, exercising, or they are just alone . . .lonely! I love that we comfort people and put a smile on their faces\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nPray, truth be told, I actually wake up 30 min earlier then I need to so I can put the next 12 hours in the LORD’S hands. I used to wake up close to 4AM – I now wake up at 3:20 AM. Each day I have at least 100 decisions to make and 100 crossroads – without the prayer at least 90% of those decisions will be wrong.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nFriday nights are special indeed – because I’m totally single, I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t own a house, I don’t have any kids, I don’t have a wife . . . I go out every night of the week. Often by the time Friday rolls around the week has caught up with me and I just “pass the “F” out around 6PM. If a group of my friends get together for a happy hour on a Friday no matter how tired I am, I’ll rally. The feeling of a Friday night – the feeling of getting through the week is sweet.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nSuccess, getting married, owning a house, accomplishing a lot of things, being admired.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nThe answer here is a bit on the long side so bear with me. Surrounding myself with people who are amazing, Church (Realitysf.com), prayer, making movies, being part of the #1 morning show in the Bay Area, laughing, getting massages. I truly enjoy helping people and being there for them in their time of need. I love going out and there is always so much to do in San Francisco. My birthday is coming up, I’m passionate about throwing a great party where I can see my friends laugh, drink, dance and sing! Lastly I’m very passionate about taking big risks. Trying to accomplish things that are so much bigger then anything I am capable of doing in my own strength.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nI’d have to say Summer. I like good weather. Summer time is usually when I travel and go on adventures. Music concerts during the Summer are usually the best.\n\nIf you were stuck on a deserted island, what three items would you want to have with you?\n\nA solar-powered iPod that is fully loaded with everything I’d ever want to listen to. An unlimited supply of matches that were water proof. Some kind of fishing pole/Rambo knife that is perfectly effective on sea and land (if there could be a fourth a tent with a built-in bed and pillow)\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nProbably a Mojito – (its usually what I order when I go out)\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nWell it depends on what category – In Classical its Bach – Suite No.1 in G performed by Pablo Casals. . . In Pop Music it’s the Beatles either LET IT BE or BLACKBIRD. Lastly I love the song Knees to the Earth by Christy Nockels (Revolution Album Version).\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nIt would have to be in this order; Jesus, Solomon from the Old Testament (David’s son), Mozart, Bach and The Apostle Paul.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie, what would it be called?\n\nFree Like a Bird – A life of Unmerited Grace\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nThis a tricky question because I am exactly where I am supposed to be. If anything in my past were to change then I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing. But that being said…I would have loved to have gone to some famous college like an NYU or a USC or Stanford.\n\nDefine Freedom.\n\nAnother tough question. Freedom for me Is being able to not attach my emotions to my circumstances. If I am truly able to do that, then I am free. Freedom is to be full of Joy and Peace even though I am surrounded by a war.\n\nWhat are your personal core values?\n\nGod first. Even before the desires of my heart, my dreams, or my hopes. Help others even when it’s an inconvenience. Always pray, especially when I don’t want to. Forgive, even if the relationship after you forgive is not the same, still forgive, erase the resentment from your heart.\n\nWhat’s the first thing you do when you wake up?\n\nCheck and respond to emails that I received over night.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do on a Friday night?\n\nMeet for a drink at Balboa Cafe and see a classic film at the Castro theater.\n\nWhat were you passionate about in your younger years growing up?\n\nPolitics and entrepreneurship. I always wanted to invest in real estate and I wanted to run for office. I’ve also always been passionate about history.\n\nWhat are you passionate about now?\n\nDoing real estate, traveling, politics and history.\n\nWhat’s your favorite season and why?\n\nSpring because the weather is just starting to warm up and excitement builds in anticipation of summer!\n\nIf you were stuck on a deserted island, what three items would you want to have with you?\n\nA water filter, a survival guide and my green pants.\n\nIf you were a cocktail or a drink what would it be?\n\nNegroni. Classic and not trendy.\n\nWhat’s the #1 most played song on your iPod?\n\nCan’t You Hear Me Knocking by the Rolling Stones.\n\nIf you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?\n\nQueen Elizabeth I or President Lincoln.\n\nIf your life was made into a movie, what would it be called?\n\nMy Way\n\nDo you have any regrets?\n\nIt would have been great to study abroad.\n\nWhat are your personal core values?\n\nHonesty; ethics; loyalty to friends, family and clients. Working hard and finding time to give back in some way.\n\nDefine Freedom.\n\nFreedom for me is the ability to decide how I spend my time everyday."
