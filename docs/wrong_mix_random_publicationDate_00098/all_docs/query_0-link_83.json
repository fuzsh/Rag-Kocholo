        "text": "Alanton Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1966\n\nFirst Principal: Emily Parks\n\nInteresting Facts: First elementary school in Virginia Beach built with a gymnasium.\n\nOverview\n\nAlanton Elementary was built to alleviate the overcrowding at John B. Dey Elementary. At that time, Alanton contained grades one through seven with an enrollment of 764 students. After completing seventh grade at Alanton, most of the students went directly to First Colonial High School as eighth-graders. It was built before the neighborhood of Baycliff, which currently surrounds the campus of the school.\n\nToday, Alanton Elementary educates kindergarten through 5th grade. Since it was constructed in 1968, an addition was built to house an extended library-media center, computer lab, art room and 10 classrooms.\n\nArrowhead Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1964\n\nFirst Principal: John Prine\n\nInteresting Facts: The name of Arrowhead Elementary was derived from the fact that during the excavation for the school, an Indian mound was found, in which many interesting artifacts were buried, including arrowheads.\n\nOverview\n\nThe land for the site of Arrowhead Elementary was purchased in 1963 with the building opening in time for the 1964-1965 school year. The average student enrollment reached 952 children in grades one through seven. The following school year, 1965-1966, this 32-classroom school was 'bulging at the seams' and the enrollment rose to 1,136 students. In 1966-1967, to relieve the high enrollment, the sixth and seventh grade students were transferred to Kemps Landing Intermediate.\n\nThe school is located on a property totaling 22.9 acres. A ground breaking was held for the construction of a new school, June 23, 2003, and the new building opened in November 2004.\n\nBayside Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1941\n\nFirst Principal: Felix Williams\n\nInteresting Facts: From a one room schoolhouse to a more modern facility, Bayside Elementary has been in existence for at least 74 years.\n\nOverview\n\nBayside began as a log cabin school from 1911-1941 (also referred to as the Little Red School House) on the grounds of Haygood United Methodist Church. This school was headed by Reverend Joseph H. Hall, an ordained minister of the Methodist church and a pastor for several years. He was also a scholar, a schoolteacher, a talented carpenter and a politician. A wooden 'spankin' paddle was found in the wall when the old school building was torn down. The paddle showed the initials ”J.J.H” carved in Spencerian script and underlined with a flourish. The original owner of the paddle was Reverend J.J. Hall. In 1911, the school moved to the W.E. Biddle School, a wooden building located on Independence Boulevard near its intersection with Haygood Road. The school was named in honor of the prominent citizen who was instrumental in getting the school built.\n\nThe school was later renamed The Bayside School. At that time, the two teachers were Nettie Seymour and Agnes Hatchet.\n\nIn November 1941, the present Bayside Elementary opened at a cost of $65,000. The school served as an elementary educational center for the communities of East Ocean View, Little Creek, Diamond Springs, Lake Smith, Robbins Corner, Chesapeake Beach and Ocean Park. The original structure included seven classrooms, an auditorium and a cafeteria. In less than five years, five additional classrooms, at a cost of $100,000, were added to accommodate increased enrollment, and in 1948 one additional classroom was constructed. In 1952, ten classrooms, a library, an office and an expansion to the cafeteria were added.\n\nIn 1997, it was determined that renovations were no longer considered a solution for the problems of an aging facility. The building was demolished in 1999 with a ground breaking held August 2, 1999, for the new $8,885,900 school built on the original site.\n\nThe new Bayside Elementary opened in December 2000, with Janet Zitt as the first principal of the new facility. The building was dedicated May 18, 2001. It provides for a capacity of 725 students with facilities for art, music and physical education. A computer lab and a media center provide technology and support resources and services. All classrooms have data, telephone and cable lines for technology and access to a closed circuit television system.\n\nBettie F. Williams Elementary (See Williams Elementary)\n\nBirdneck Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1986\n\nFirst Principal: Gene Gregory\n\nInteresting Facts: A special dedication program was held Dec. 15, 1986, for the students with the Honorable G. William Whitehurst, Congressman, as the guest speaker. A time capsule filled with memorabilia was buried in the front yard.\n\nOverview\n\nBirdneck Elementary was built on a 23.5 acre site secured from the Commonwealth of Virginia by the City of Virginia Beach and leased to the Virginia Beach School Board. Funding for the $7.2 million dollar school was approved by the School Board and City Council in 1981. Construction of the 137,250 square foot building began in March of 1985. The school, which houses 56 regular and 16 special classrooms in its two wings, opened to nearly 1,400 students Sept. 2, 1986. The architectural firm of Dills, Ainscough, and Duff designed the school; Conrad Brothers was the general contractor.\n\nBrookwood Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1968\n\nFirst Principal: Estell Davis\n\nInteresting Facts: The renovated building is one of the most advanced elementary complexes in Virginia Beach. It was built with the most modern construction materials available for schools today.\n\nOverview\n\nBrookwood Elementary was constructed on 13 acres of land and opened in time for the 1967-1968 school year, housing grades one through seven. The school is bordered on the west side by a small canal that flows into the Lynnhaven Inlet and is adjacent to the largest shopping mall in Virginia Beach - Lynnhaven Mall.\n\nA ground breaking was held for the construction of a new school June 5, 2006. The old building was demolished July 6, 2006, with classrooms and offices relocated behind Plaza Elementary in portable buildings for the duration of the project. The new building was dedicated May 7, 2008.\n\nCenterville Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1984\n\nFirst Principal: George Chandler\n\nInteresting Facts: Centerville was built on land that was once Brown Farm.\n\nOverview\n\nCenterville Elementary was built in 1984 and replaced the old Aragona Elementary. In 1988, student enrollment reached over 1,200 students and Centerville Elementary had 11 portable classrooms to accommodate the overcrowding until Tallwood Elementary was built in 1989.\n\nChristopher Farms Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1997\n\nFirst Principal: Don Clement\n\nInteresting Facts: Christopher Farms Elementary contains the Spanish Partial Immersion Program. This program, launched in 2002, was designed to offer students a foreign language experience within the elementary school setting and give them more career options.\n\nOverview\n\nThe school sits on property which was previously the horse farm known as Pleasant Acres Farm. There is a rumor that the farm was eventually purchased by a man named Christopher and thus the development became Christopher Farms. The school opened under the leadership of Don Clement and Debbie Bennett.\n\nCollege Park Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1973\n\nFirst Principal: Harold Revis\n\nInteresting Facts: College Park Elementary stands on land that was formerly a cluster of dairy farms.\n\nOverview\n\nDuring the first years of operation, College Park Elementary housed grades kindergarten through seventh in an open classroom instructional setting. Following the opening of Brandon Junior High in 1978, seventh grade students were no longer taught at College Park. The open classroom format was disbanded in 1981 for a more traditional instructional arrangement.\n\nThe original building was funded through a city bond referendum for $978,000 with an additional $100,000 spent on equipment. The 49,900 square foot building was divided into 31 classrooms, five additional instructional areas and a cafeteria. In 1982, a gymnasium was added to the original building.\n\nA ground breaking was held for the construction of a new school June 3, 2010, and was completed in Fall 2011.\n\nCooke Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1905\n\nFirst Principal: Clinton Woodhouse\n\nInteresting Facts: Cooke Elementary celebrated their 100th Anniversary on November 4, 2006.\n\nOverview\n\nWilloughby T. Cooke Elementary had its beginning in the year 1904. In that year a canvass was taken to determine that there were thirty children who were of school age and a school was started in two attic rooms in the Driftwood Cottage located at 11th and 12th Street on the oceanfront. This first school was under the direction of Miss Laura R. Washington with Miss Adele O'Connor as her assistant. Miss Mary Townsend acted as a substitute. The school flourished under the direction of these ladies and proved to the Board of Supervisors that a public school for winter residents at the beach was a necessity.\n\nIn 1905, the public school became a reality for Virginia Beach. That year the school was housed in two rooms over the jail and the old Princess Anne Hotel was located within sight. During this time, Judge Keeling and Mr. Spence were among those who took an active interest in the school, and the first unit of the school was built. In March 1906, the town of Virginia Beach received its charter from the Virginia Assembly. Within months, the Town Council voted to fund a public school. In September 1913, students moved into a brand new, two-story brick building known as the Free Public School. The school building was located at 524 15th Street. It cost $14,000 and housed 125 students in grades one through seven.\n\nIn 1919, Mr. Willoughby T. Cooke became a member of the School Board and his years of interest and work in local education brought about the naming of the school in his honor. Mr. Cooke was a retired Norfolk businessman who was interested in children and their progress. Under his tenure the school added health education, a free lunch fund, drinking fountains, indoor plumbing and membership in the P.T.A. Because there was no lunchroom in the school building, neighborhood mothers took turns preparing a daily pot of soup and sandwiches that was delivered to the school by 7th grade students in the child’s wagon. An auditorium and small lunchroom were finally added in 1927. Electricity was installed in 1928. During the 1930s and 1940s some students rode an electric rail bus (known as the Green Hornet) to the 17th Street station and walked two blocks to Cooke School.\n\nAdditions were made to the building in 1946 and 1954. In 1962, all of the 1912 building was demolished and a new building begun. A new gymnasium was added in 1991. At the end of the 1997-1998 school year the “old” Cooke School was torn down (the gymnasium remained) and Cooke students moved to the old Linkhorn School building for the 1998-1999 school year. In 2000, the “new” Cooke opened at the same 15th Street site. The new building cost almost $9 million to build and houses 580 + students in grades K-5. This building is a state-of-the-art building that supports a curriculum that is fully integrated with technology. Participation in this project was extremely special for Cederquist Rodriguez Ripley Maddux, the Architectural Associates. Mr. John Maddux, Principal-in-Charge, attended Willoughby T. Cooke Elementary in the mid fifties and his mother, Mary Maddux, taught there for a number of years.\n\nToday, Cooke Elementary has a memorial brick wall, made from the original school bricks, dons a picture of Mr. Willoughby T. Cooke, the school's namesake. Additionally, there are brass historical plaques and a time capsule.\n\nCorporate Landing Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1993\n\nFirst Principal: Bill Skaggs\n\nInteresting Facts: In 2005, the school was named an NAYRE (The National Association for Year-Round Education) year round school of merit.\n\nOverview\n\nCorporate Landing Elementary opened its doors in 1993 with Bill Skaggs as the first principal. Corporate Landing remained a year-round school for seven years (2002-2009). The school services the regular population in addition to the hearing impaired. Corporate Landing has some of the few Special Ed Teachers on staff that specializes in hearing impairment.\n\nCreeds Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1954\n\nFirst Principal: Bessie Bell\n\nInteresting Facts: Robin Davenport, a previous principal, was a student at Creeds Elementary during the time his mother was the cafeteria manager.\n\nOverview\n\nCreeds Elementary is located in the rural southeastern section of Virginia Beach. The original Creeds building was built in 1848 in a section known as Blossom Hill. The second structure for Creeds Elementary was built in 1908 in Creeds, Virginia, approximately 5 miles south of the present building. The present building was constructed in 1939 at a cost of $80,000 and served as a high school for Princess Anne County until 1954 when it was converted to an elementary school.\n\nAs you walk through the hallways at the south end of the building, a history lesson awaits. Photos, dating back to 1940, of graduating classes line the walls. Generations of students have passed through the school, and children enjoy looking back at family members who once walked those corridors. Another interesting educational feature of the school is a map of the state of Virginia, painted on the wall near the media center.\n\nThe dedication of the first renovation of the school was held March 15, 1970. An air-conditioned primary wing was added to include four classrooms and a modern library in 1969. In 1999, a $6 million dollar modernization project began that tremendously transformed Creeds Elementary. This renovation added classrooms, art and music rooms, an administrative suite and media center. A public library adjoins the school media center, and a story room, conference room and computer lab are shared with the public library. The gym and all the original classrooms were also renovated.\n\nAug. 25, 1999, a partnership ceremony was held celebrating the beginning of a key partnership between Creeds Elementary and Pungo-Blackwater Library in the same facility. This renovation which includes a 'library-in-a-school' approach is a unique partnership not only in our region, but in the state as well. Former Principal Robin Davenport was instrumental in getting the project off the ground.\n\nWhen the school is in session, the public library and the school media center hold separate operations - each with its own entrance and staff. Creeds Elementary students visit the public library during school hours and have full access to the collection. After school, both facilities are managed as one library by Virginia Beach Public Library staff.\n\nCreeds Elementary serves as a model for what schools can become. In 2008, they received the Governor’s School of Excellence Award making them one of 89 schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia to achieve this honor. This is quite an accomplishment considering the fact that there are over 1800 schools in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nDiamond Springs Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 2007\n\nFirst Principal: Shirann Lewis\n\nInteresting Facts: Diamond Springs, Newtown and Bettie F. Williams elementary schools form the Bayside Tri-Campus.\n\nOverview\n\nDiamond Springs Elementary was built to alleviate over crowding at Newtown Road Elementary and Bettie F. Williams Elementary schools. Diamond Springs was built on a section of the former Williams Farm property which the City of Virginia Beach acquired. Kindergarten and first grade students were housed at Newtown and Bettie F. Williams until the completion of the building project.\n\nA public park and a city street (Learning Circle) was built in conjunction with the new Newtown Elementary. The park and the street represent joint ventures with the City of Virginia Beach Departments of Parks and Recreation and Public Works. The cost of the street project was approximately $3 million and the park cost approximately $2 million. The ground breaking was held on June 29, 2006, and the building was dedicated on June 4, 2008.\n\nJohn B. Dey Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1956\n\nFirst Principal: Joseph J. Owens Jr.\n\nInteresting Facts: John B. Dey Elementary School received its name from a former Princess Anne County School Board Chairman who resided less than one mile from the school.\n\nOverview\n\nJohn B. Dey Elementary was built in September 1956. During the first year, however, it housed only grades five through seven to alleviate crowded conditions at Little Creek Elementary. The following year John B. Dey began to function as a complete elementary school including grades one through eight.\n\nThe school was contracted to be built in 1955 with a maximum capacity of 850 students the original school had. A self-contained sewer system, hot water (oil) heat, no air-conditioning and consisted of 48,585 square feet. It was designed without a physical education room. It had a 1,000 barrel bus refueling facility. Over 13 acres of land on Great Neck Road were purchased from the James Farm by the Princess Anne County School Board. On this site the school was constructed.\n\nIncreased population in the area made it necessary to construct an annex of ten rooms, a storage room and two restrooms in 1960. In 1963, the annex housed some eighth graders to help the crowded conditions in the neighboring secondary school.\n\nWith the Virginia Beach population expanding, in September 1972, two mobile classrooms were added to aid congestion. Two kindergarten classes were added 1973. The school gymnasium was completed and opened for the students during the 1978-1979 school year. The much anticipated air-conditioning was installed in the summer of 1986. An addition was added in 1995 that included seven classrooms, a new media center, art room, computer lab and updated office spaces.\n\nThe Story of John B. Dey\n\nJohn B. Dey, who died at the age of 83, on December 10, 1957, was a truck farmer by vocation and lived in one of the most picturesque homes in Princess Anne County. The home was the Broad Bay Manor, which was built in 1640. Mr. Dey lived in the home at the time of his death. The 415 acre estate and the manor house and the life of the master of the manor presented the pleasant picture that can be summed up in phrase, “noblesse oblige.” The landed gentleman lived up to noble obligations.\n\nHe had a fine sense of loyalty to the community obligations he assumed and there were many. An example, and perhaps the outstanding one, was his 17-year chairmanship of the Princess Anne County School Board. He became chairman of that important board in 1940 and retired in June 1957, at which time he was honored by its members for his foresight and wisdom in planning for the county schools.\n\nMr. Dey was a member of the Princess Anne Board of Supervisors, the Norfolk City Council (during a period of residence in that city) and the State House of Delegates. He was a delegate to several state Democratic conventions and to the national Democratic convention in Houston in 1928 that nominated Alfred E. Smith for the presidency. He also served as a longtime director of the Tidewater Automobile Association.\n\nMr. Dey's unselfish devotion to community causes like the schools stood out most strongly. He was born in Princess Anne County, but was educated in the public schools of Norfolk County.\n\nFairfield Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1976\n\nFirst Principal: C.M. Rawls\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nFairfield Elementary was built in 1975, to serve the rapidly growing population of the Kempsville Borough. The school opened in 1976 with an enrollment of 900 students. The next year, enrollment increased to 1,230 students, which led to the transfer of all seventh grade students to another school. The school is currently home to about 530 students, in grades K-5.\n\nPhysically, Fairfield Elementary consists of one large building where two main hallways intersect at a cross between the lower and upper-grade corridors. The cafeteria also serves as an auditorium. The library media center and computer lab are two of the most frequently visited locations in the school. The entry foyer was refurbished at the beginning of the 1996-1997 academic year, with cheerful white wicker furniture donated by the Parent Teacher Association. The technology needed for Internet access was installed in all classrooms during the summer of 1996.\n\nGlenwood Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1990\n\nFirst Principal: John S. Kalocay\n\nInteresting Facts: Glenwood was the largest elementary school in the state of Virginia with 1,600 students until New Castle Elementary was built in1999.\n\nOverview\n\nGlenwood Elementary opened in 1990 with John Kalocay as the first principal. The school colors (blue and orange) and mascot (the gator) are from the University of Florida. For the 1993-1994 school year, Glenwood had 10 adopt-a-school partners and surpassed their motto, “Together Everyone Achieves More.”\n\nIn 2006, the school began the Young Writers’ Celebration, where every student in the school (950-1000 students) published a hard bound book called a Bare Book which was displayed in the gym for the community, school staff and students to view and read.\n\nGlenwood has taken part in recycling efforts for the Lynnhaven NOW project for the 2009-2010 school year. A time capsule is buried in the courtyard holding items that were of importance and trendy during the year the school opened.\n\nGreen Run Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1976\n\nFirst Principal: Robert Pearsall\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nWhen the Green Run community was designed, an elementary school was planned on a 14-acre site at the center of the Green Run community, a unique circular design. The community grew very rapidly before the school could be built; therefore a student body was organized before the building was completed. The school became operational July 1, 1975, when a principal and secretary set up an office in a conference room at nearby Holland Elementary. Students were housed at Brookwood, Plaza, Holland and Windsor Oaks elementary schools until the new building was completed in 1976.\n\nHermitage Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1964\n\nFirst Principal: Ruth Cole\n\nInteresting Facts: Hermitage Elementary is the first \"green” school to be constructed in Virginia Beach.\n\nOverview\n\nThe original school opened its doors in November 1964, on 19 acres donated by the federal government. During this time, 970 students in 6th and 7th grade classes attended school in the unfinished building for the remainder of the term. In the fall of 1965, the completed building was opened to serve grades one through seven. In 1967, four special education classes were added.\n\nGround was broken for a new school June 10, 2003, and renovation was completed March 2004. Hermitage is regarded as a \"green\" school because the new structure contains many environmentally savvy amenities. The environmentally-sound building includes special filters installed in the heating and cooling system; different air flow requirements creating energy efficiency; building materials containing recyclable elements; higher insulation values to keep the building as warm as possible in the winter and cooler in the summer; a structural design that promotes an abundant flow of sunlight; the use of paints and floor adhesives with minimal odors; sinks and toilets with low water usage; and other components.\n\nAccording to Tony Arnold, director of Facilities Planning and Construction, the reason why the division decided to rebuild Hermitage as a \"green” school was to incorporate the nation's best resources to build an environmentally efficient school. The new $9.7 million structure opened with a capacity for 567 students and a building dedication was held November 15, 2005.\n\nHolland Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1967\n\nFirst Principal: Mrs. Edna \"Ellie\" Bates\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nHolland Elementary opened for the 1967-1968 school year, with an average enrollment of 797 children in grades one through seven. In 1973, Holland operated on a 45/15 schedule which was designed to help ease over crowding due to the new development of Green Run. Teachers taught for 45 school days, then had 3 weeks off and rotated all year. During that time, there was only one first grade class that had 35 students. In the following year, there were two first grade classes, which reduced the classroom size to about 18 children. The Accelerated Schools program was piloted at Holland Elementary. It was designed to enhance student performance and was discontinued after only a few years.\n\nIndian Lakes Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1979\n\nFirst Principal: Peggy Bryson\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nIn the spring of 1977, the Virginia Beach School Board approved construction of a new school to house the increasing school population in the Kempsville area. The School Board voted unanimously to the name the elementary school, Indian Lakes Elementary, which was located in the Indian Lakes area of the city. The school would house students from the subdivisions of Indian Lakes, Lake Christopher and Brigadoon. During construction, students were bused to Old Donation Elementary for two school years:1977-1978 and 1978-1979. Indian Lakes Elementary officially opened September 4, 1979, and operated with a student population of 1,086 in grades one through six.\n\nKempsville Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1961\n\nFirst Principal: Robert Stenzhorn\n\nInteresting Facts: The first school on record in the Kempsville area was the Dickson Free School, built in 1794. In 1835, there was a Kempsville Academy (or Male and Female Seminary) which existed until the Civil War.\n\nOverview\n\nKempsville was once an incorporated town. Prior to that, it was known as Kemps Landing, taking its name from a local storekeeper. The creek, part of the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River, was once a deep water landing, and goods for Mr. Kemp's store, as well as bricks and lumber, were unloaded there. It was also a shipping point for grain and other produce from surrounding areas. It is believed that the first skirmish of the American Revolution in Virginia was fought in Kempsville.\n\nKempsville became the county seat of Princess Anne County in 1775. The Court House was later used as a Baptist church. In the old part of the village there were two churches, Emmanuel Episcopal, which was once a part of the Old Donation Parish, and Kempsville Baptist church, organized in 1814. Pleasant Hall, built in 1797, is one of the area's most outstanding homes.\n\nKempsville Elementary was built in 1961. The school was renovated in August 2001, and completed in 2003.\n\nKempsville Meadows Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1959\n\nFirst Principal: Josephine Charles\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nKempsville Meadows Elementary was built on 15 acres of land donated by Mr. Albert Bonney. The school was designed by the architects, Pentecost, Wade, and McLellan and erected by Haycox Construction Company. The first principal, Mrs. Josephine Charles, opened the school in 1959 with a student enrollment of 810.\n\nOn July 3, 2001 a ground breaking ceremony was held for the construction of a new school. The building was dedicated on Aug. 21, 2002, and the new facility opened in September 2002.\n\nKing’s Grant Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1960\n\nFirst Principal: Mildred Wilson\n\nInteresting Facts: The original school was built in a record breaking time of 90 days.\n\nOverview\n\nKing's Grant Elementary was built in 1960 by the Princess Anne County School Board. The school was built to house many of the students who had previously attended Oceana Elementary which was closed due to its proximity to the Oceana Naval Air Station. Mrs. Mildred Wilson was the first principal and served until 1961. The school district was divided and in September 1965, King’s Grant Elementary opened to students from the King’s Grant, Eastern Park and Chesopeian Colony neighborhoods. That same year, five sections of sixth grade students were transported to King’s Grant Elementary to relieve the overcrowded conditions in the Plaza area.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 1968, the original building burned; however, the new school was rebuilt and ready to go in 1969. The King's Grant community continued to grow over the years and a new addition was added to the school in 1997.\n\nKingston Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1965\n\nFirst Principal: Willard Pendleton\n\nInteresting Facts: Kingston Elementary has received the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon Award twice: during the 1989-1990 and 1996-1997 school years.\n\nOverview\n\nKingston Elementary was completed in the summer of 1965. The school was used to house the students of the new Windsor Woods area until the new Windsor Woods Elementary was completed. Approximately 675 students in grades one through seven were housed in the school.\n\nOver the 1965 winter holidays, the Windsor Woods faculty and staff moved into the new Windsor Woods Elementary and the King's Grant students remained at Kingston Elementary for the remainder of the 1965-1966 school year.\n\nIn 1973, a kindergarten program was established at Kingston. Also, in 1990 a gymnasium was added followed by an addition in 1996.\n\nLandstown Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1993\n\nFirst Principal: Shirley Barco\n\nInteresting Facts: Landstown is the only school that is conjoined with a middle school.\n\nOverview\n\nLandstown Elementary, \"Home of the Dolphins\" is one of the largest elementary schools in Virginia Beach.

As the area was primarily undeveloped, this large housing area created an immediate public educational need. In 1961, 3200 single family dwellings had been completed in Aragona Village, and the existing Aragona Elementary housed 2,500 elementary children attending a split session. In 1961 Princess Anne County purchased half of the 12.7 acres that comprise the site occupied by Louise Luxford Elementary with William Oliver, a local farmer, donating the other half.

After completing his three-year indenture in 1624, he went back to England where he married Sarah Offley. Thoroughgood returned to America with Sarah and began to acquire land, west of what is now the Lynnhaven River. It was at this time that Thoroughgood named the Lynnhaven River after his homeland, King's Lynn. 'Haven' also became part of its name and meant \"a safe place.\"\n\nThe name 'Lynnhaven' was also given to the village, which grew around the area near present day Virginia Beach Blvd. and N. Lynnhaven Rd. It was appropriate to name the village after the Lynnhaven River since it extended to this area. The area has continued to be referred to as the Lynnhaven area. Lynnhaven Elementary received its name from Lynnhaven, the area in which it is located. The school is on a tract on the original Lee Farm, which was reserved by developer John Aragona for the construction of a hospital.

Several years later, the school was moved to a three-room building along South Birdneck Road due to growing enrollment.\n\nThe three-room building is now known as the Seatack Community Center, which is one of the oldest continuous settlements in the northeast portion of Virginia Beach. The name Seatack surfaced in 1813 when the British fleet was anchored off what is now Virginia Beach and parties of sailors were sent ashore to rummage for food. The vessels set up a protective bombardment to cover the field. The Seatack area marked the farthest point inland where the great iron cannon balls fell. On one occasion, a messenger ran to tell the American soldiers that the British were attacking by sea. As a result, for many years the area was called Sea Attack.

Cox High was named after a former superintendent of Virginia Beach City Public Schools who served as the school division's leader from 1932-1968. The first senior class graduated from Cox High June 11, 1965. In 1968, Cox graduate Bill Bruner, was the first National Merit Scholar from Virginia Beach.\n\nThe present Cox High building opened in the fall of 1983 and the original building located at 1848 North Great Neck Rd. presently serves as Great Neck Middle. The present Cox High building is located on 2425 Shorehaven Rd.\n\nFirst Colonial High\n\nOpening Date: 1966\n\nFirst Principal: James C. Mounie\n\nInteresting Facts: First Colonial is the first high school in the area to have a Demonstration Library, one of four in the state.\n\nOverview\n\nFirst Colonial High opened in 1966 serving the Lynnhaven and Beach Boroughs. The Legal Studies Academy has been housed at First Colonial High since 2002.\n\nFirst Colonial’s school mascot is the Patriot. The school seal incorporates the mascot along with a waterline which represents the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean along with the Old Cape Henry Lighthouse which was commissioned by George Washington. There are also three ships, the Discovery, the Susan Constant and the Godspeed, which are representations of the first landing in 1607 of the first permanent English settlement in the New World.\n\nGreen Run High\n\nOpening Date: 1979\n\nFirst Principal: Wylie French\n\nInteresting Facts: Green Run is one of three Virginia Beach schools built on land that can be traced back to the Algonquin Indian settlements.\n\nOverview\n\nThe school opened in September 1979 as the largest high school in Virginia with 247,000 square feet. The facility was constructed with 75 classrooms and laboratories along with 8 industrial shops. The site for the school was previously used for fox hunting by the Princess Anne Hunt Club and later used as a garden farm for the Norfolk City Jail. The site was owned by a Mennonite farming family until it was sold in the late 1960’s as part of the Green Run planned development.\n\nIn 1985, portable classrooms were needed to accommodate the large student body. By 1988, Green Run High had an enrollment of 3,000 students. Salem High opened in 1990 and Green Run’s student population dropped to 1,500.\n\nKellam High\n\nOpening Date: 1962 (original building); 2014 (present building)\n\nFirst Principal: Jefferson Davis\n\nInteresting Facts: The knight and school colors – black, white and gold, were taken from the Kellam family’s coat of arms, which the school adopted.\n\nOverview\n\nFloyd E. Kellam High opened in 1962, serving the largest geographical area of any school in Virginia Beach. The school is named after Judge Floyd Eaton Kellam, who practiced law in Princess Anne County until 1946. The Governor of Virginia appointed him to take the 18th Judicial Circuit of Virginia and he remained on the bench until his death in 1958. Kellam’s first graduating class of 176 students received their diplomas in June 1965. A new two-story wing was completed in 1967.\n\nIn 1994-1995, with the opening of Ocean Lakes High, attendance areas were rezoned, causing an enrollment drop of 450 students with a proportional loss of teachers, counselors and administrators.\n\nEnrollment increased to a student population of 2,300 from 1998 to 2001. With the opening of Landstown High in 2001, Kellam High underwent another rezoning and an enrollment drop of nearly 300 students. Following the opening of additions at Landstown High and Ocean Lakes High during the 2006-2007 school year, a rezoning alleviated overcrowding.\n\nThe Virginia Beach School Board approved the acquisition of the Manchester Station property Jan. 5, 2010. This 108-acre property serves as the replacement site for the new Kellam High, located at 2665 West Neck Rd. The new Kellam High School opened in January 2014.\n\nKempsville High\n\nOpening Date: 1966\n\nFirst Principal: Norman W. Morris\n\nInteresting Facts: Kempsville High has been used as a high school and an elementary school.\n\nOverview\n\nKempsville High was built in 1941. It served the community as a high school until 1954, at which time it became an elementary school. A new school opened in the fall of 1966 with approximately 1,800 eighth and ninth grade students. Tenth grade was added in the fall of 1967, eleventh grade in the fall of 1968, and finally a senior class in the fall of 1969. Today, Kempsville High houses grades nine through 12.\n\nThe history of the Kempsville area is depicted by symbols on the school seal and the seal is emblematic of a new history in the making. The Chief, who is the dominant figure on the seal, represents the early settlers, hence the explanation of the \"Kempsville High Chiefs.\" The fact that industry produces reward is symbolized by a plowshare and crops. The tomahawk crossed with the peace pipe shows the acceptance of human differences and the compatibility that comes through the untied effort of all.\n\nLandstown High\n\nOpening Date: 2001\n\nFirst Principal: John Frossard\n\nInteresting Facts: Landstown High was the first Virginia Beach high school built in the 21st Century.\n\nOverview\n\nLandstown High is a state-of-the-art facility designed for 2,000 students. The school is built on a 65-acre campus covering 274,701 square feet. It features two identically designed two-story academic wings which house classrooms, a 1,800-seat gymnasium, media center, cafeteria and a 665-seat auditorium. The facility is also the site of the Virginia Beach City Public Schools' first Technology Academy. Additional amenities include a performing arts complex, a physical education complex and cutting-edge technology systems that include the most complete complement of voice, data and video.\n\nThe Technology Academy has been housed at Landstown High since 2001. In December 2005 construction was started on a twenty-classroom addition, which was completed in January 2007 with a dedication ceremony held May 2, 2007.\n\nOcean Lakes High\n\nOpening Date: 1994\n\nFirst Principal: Jerry Deviney\n\nInteresting Facts: In 1997, Ocean Lakes hosted the inaugural Virginia High School League Student Leaders Conference.\n\nOverview\n\nOcean Lakes High opened in 1994. The 330,525 square foot building is one of the largest in the Commonwealth of Virginia. In September 1996, Ocean Lakes High became the site for Virginia Beach’s first magnet school with 196 students enrolling in the Mathematics & Science Magnet Program. It is now known as the Mathematics & Science Academy.\n\nIn December 2005 construction was started on a twelve-classroom addition and completed in January 2007 with an addition dedication May 30, 2007.\n\nPrincess Anne High\n\nOpening Date: 1954\n\nFirst Principal: J. Warren Littleton\n\nInteresting Facts: Princess Anne High School is the oldest secondary school in Virginia Beach. In June 2013, the school celebrated its 60th graduating class.\n\nOverview\n\nPrincess Anne High opened in August 1954, with 1,558 students and 62 teachers. It was formed from the consolidation of the three high schools that served Princess Anne County. The student population peaked in the early 1970's to approximately 2,800 students.\n\nAs of September 2014, the school serves approximately 1,800 students in grades 9-12, including the West Building, which serves secondary level severely handicapped special education students from the entire city. The school houses an International Baccalaureate Program which opened in 1995.\n\nThe school was modernized several times beginning in 1985. The most recent changes occurred during the 1995-1997 period. A fire destroyed about one-third of the building in September 1995, four days before the new school year began. After the fire, the majority of classes were held in Celebration Station, a vacant shopping mall approximately two miles east of the main campus for the entire 1995-1996 school year. Buses \"shuttled\" students from classes at Celebration Station to portable classrooms at the main campus in the fall of 1995, and then to classes in a new wing which had been under construction prior to the fire. The new wing (the 900 hall), consisting of 26 science classrooms and labs, opened in January 1996. Meanwhile, the entire front of the 2-story building known as the 200 hall was completely rebuilt. The second floor library, where the fire originally started, was rebuilt and expanded over a first floor \"multi-purpose\" addition. A new wing for art classes/studios was added behind the renovated administrative offices in the front of the building.\n\nThe school reopened in January 1997. A dedication was held May 4, 1997.\n\nSalem High\n\nOpening Date: 1989\n\nFirst Principal: Wyley French\n\nInteresting Facts: A student/parent committee selected the name SunDevils to represent Salem High in the spring of 1989. A SunDevil is a weather phenomenon much like a Dust Devil, in which unusual weather is caused by a high amount of sunlight.\n\nOverview\n\nSalem High opened in September 1989 and is a 258,862 square foot facility. The Salem High seal was designed in 1996 and displays a scalloped circle that depicts the various aspects of the school: the book and pen for academics; the mask, lyre and paintbrushes for the fine arts; and the torch and rings for athletics (also to denote that the seal was designed in an Olympic year). The sun is representative of both the SunDevils and the seven boroughs that comprise Virginia Beach. The lighthouse is a symbol of Virginia Beach, and the clasped hands are characteristic of unity and harmony in the school and within the community.\n\nThe Visual and Performing Arts Academy has been housed at Salem High since 2004.\n\nTallwood High\n\nOpening Date: 1992\n\nFirst Principal: Bernard E.Morgan III\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nTallwood High opened its doors in 1992 with a population of 1,748 students. The unique design of the building provides students with lots of large windows, columns, a courtyard area, arched walkways and a general atmosphere of openness. In 2004, the Global Studies and World Languages Academy was implemented at Tallwood High.\n\nThe History of the \"Tallwood\" Plantation\n\nNathaniel Nicholas House (Tallwood) is currently standing at 1676 Kempsville Road in Virginia Beach. William Nicholas came to Kempsville in 1642. His grandson, Nathaniel Nicholas, inherited the family plantation south of Kempsville in 1746, on which he had already built the \"Tallwood\" house in 1740.\n\nAragona Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1957\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe school was established in 1957 and began classes on a half-day basis in Thalia Elementary School. In February 1958, when construction of the present building was completed, the faculty and students in grades one through eight, with their principal, Lee Land, moved into the permanent building. From its beginning a periodic gradual change of elimination of the highest grade has taken place; therefore, since the 1967-68 school term, grade five has been the senior level in the building. The changes of grades were necessary due to the enrollment increases at the various grade levels, especially the lower grades.\n\nThe Primary Disabled Reading Program was transferred to the Aragona School in September 1972. Students enrolled in the special program are transported from the complete geographic area of the City of Virginia Beach. Kindergarten was the latest addition to the school curriculum and became an important part of the school in September 1973.\n\nCareer Development Center (CDC)\n\nOpening Date: 1979\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nCareer Development Center (CDC) opened in the 1979-1980 school year as a vocational training center. The cost of the original building and land was $1,600,000 with renovation and conversion of the 128,000 square foot former G.E.X. building costing $3,028,980.08. Credit for making the CDC project a reality was a result of Superintendent Dr. E.E. Brickell and his staff, John McCage, staff architect; William Moosha, principal for the school; John Curtin, program development specialist; and Dr. John Sutherland, special assistant for program development.\n\nThe Career Development Center (CDC) was renamed in 1996 as the Virginia Beach Central Academy. At this time, the program focused on at-risk students in grades 9-12, offering students diverse academic programs.\n\nCenter for Effective Learning (CEL)\n\nOpening Date: 1969\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts: In August 2007, the center moved from the original campus to the former campus of Kemps Landing Magnet which is located on the corner of Kempsville and Princess Anne Road.\n\nOverview\n\nCenter for Effective Learning (CEL) opened in September 1969, with three major goals. The first was to develop individualized programs for students with certain kinds of problems. With highly specialized, concentrated curricula, these students would be able to “catch up,” and return to their neighborhood schools. The second was to provide facilities for diagnosing learning problems and prescribing appropriate programs for pupils throughout the Virginia Beach City Public Schools. The third was to serve as a model in developing and refining programs and teaching techniques. The school opened with an enrollment of 226 students – 44 of these students were five-year olds, invited from the adjacent area to form the initial class of a Non-graded Primary.\n\nThe goal of the program was to help \"At-Risk\" students successfully function in a school setting through academic success and appropriate center social behaviors. CEL focused on three areas: instruction, intervention, and behaviors. In the area of instruction, a strong emphasis was placed on the acceleration of basic skills proficiencies in order to strengthen academic skills. Intervention concentration was on students' social skills and greater involvement in center life and community projects. Counseling focused on responsibility, improvement in attendance, student behavior patterns, and career awareness.\n\nToday, the center no longer exists. In September 2009, CEL and Virginia Beach Central Academy combined services into what is now known as the Renaissance Academy.\n\nCharity Neck School (re-named Pleasant Ridge School)\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe building was constructed in the 1880s on Charity Neck Road as a two-room school for white children. It ended its service as a one-room school (Pleasant Ridge School) for blacks located on the east side of Princess Anne Road in Southern Pungo and next to Asbury United Methodist Church. The school closed around 1915 when a larger Charity school was built (1916) for white children. The opening of the larger school consolidated the children who had been attending the one-room schools scattered about the countryside. This larger school closed in the early 40s when Creeds School opened.\n\nCourthouse Elementary\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nOne room schools at Tabernacle, Sandbridge, Shipps Corner (now Holland Road) and Beech Grove (now West Neck Road) were consolidated into a two story wooden structure that was placed beside the one room school (Hickory Bridge Elementary) on the Courthouse Elementary site. Several classrooms were on each floor of the building, with the small auditorium upstairs. The building was heated by a central boiler system. On a morning in March 1931, it is thought that the janitor tried to ignite the fire with kerosene, and the boiler exploded, burning the original wooden Courthouse Elementary School to the ground, according to Ms. Lillie Belle Woodhouse (who taught at the school from 1931-1972). Everyone in the area at the time remembers the event vividly, especially Ms. Woodhouse, who lived across the road, and whose father attempted to assist with the fire.\n\nDuring the period when the original brick school was being constructed, the students attended school in two rooms on the first floor of the old Courthouse building. Also, it is possible, that some classes were held in the Masonic Lodge Building, which was on the Courthouse grounds. According to Ms. Lillie Belle Woodhouse , the new school was completed by Thanksgiving in 1931. The building cost $35,000, and it is noteworthy that a new elementary school in 1960 costed approximately $8 million dollars.\n\nSchool commenced each day as the children lined up and marched in to the tune of a John Phillips Sousa March, played on a record player, powered by a spring, that was wound up manually. The classroom day began with a prayer, a song that was frequently America the Beautiful, and pledge allegiance to the American flag.\n\nDuring the early days, the playground was divided into two approximately equal parts, one for the boys and one for the girls. They were not allowed to play together. If boys and girls were caught playing together, they were punished, one method of punishment being the requirement that the offenders sit together in a desk designed for two children. Each play area included an outside restroom facility, which many remember not very fondly as a \"five holer\".\n\nSpelling Bees were frequently held both within the school and between the schools of Princess Anne County, as were music recognition competitions. Mildred McClanan Hassen won the 1928 county music recognition competition by recognizing the Blue Danube Waltz by Strauss, and winning a pen. Ethel Van Nostrand won first place. A non-sectarian religious class was held once each week, as was music instruction. Bands were organized in Princess Anne County in approximately 1946.\n\nThe hot lunch program at Courthouse Elementary, and perhaps Princess Anne County, was started by Mary Gertrude Whitehurst McClanan (mother of The Honorable Delegate Glenn McClanan). This program permitted children to bring $.25 per week to school, and they made hot soup each day on the pot-bellied stove.\n\nRules against corporal punishment had not been thought of in those days, and spankings were frequent. The favorite punishment was spanking hands with a wooden ruler. Frequently the seventh grade teacher and the principal were the same person, and janitorial services were performed by the least intelligent boy in the class. Originally eighth and ninth grades were taught at Courthouse School. Later, grades 8-11 were taught at Kempsville, Oceana and Creeds High Schools. The system of 12 grades in the public school system began in approximately 1946.\n\nAn addition was made to Courthouse Elementary School in 1955-1956. The new classrooms cost $298,000, which included air conditioning for the library and office in the old building.\n\nHickory Bridge School\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nA one-room school that was located approximately 500 yards south of the old Courthouse Elementary School was moved to the Courthouse grounds in approximately 1920. The school site cost $1,000, and may have been purchased from Dr. Chilton, who had his medical office in the corner of the school yard. The school contained grades 1-7 and was heated with an old fashioned pot-bellied stove, with the fire being maintained usually by the largest members of the class. It is said that two of the early \"fire maintainers\" were Herman Glenn McClanan (father of The Honorable Delegate Glenn McClanan) and Herman Bartie.\n\nKemps Landing Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1941\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nOverview\n\nKemps Landing Elementary was built in 1941 and named for the port of Kemps Landing that was once the heart of a thriving colonial settlement on the banks of the Elizabeth River. Sailing ships docked near the place that Princess Anne Road now crosses the Elizabeth River.\n\nThe area prospered and the name was changed to Kempsville. It became the county seat of government around 1775 and soon thereafter one of the fist schools was established in a building that had been a jail. Education was continued in the Kempsville area with the Dickson Free School, built in 1794, and the Kempsville Academy, which served the community from the early nineteenth century until the time of the Civil War.\n\nKemps Landing Elementary was situated on land sold to Princess Anne County by the O.B. Mears family. The long history of this school site bears strong testimony to the concern of our forefathers for education.\n\nIn 1953, a one-story section was built next to the original two-story building and it was used to house elementary students. Then, because of rapid growth, it became a junior high school. In 1966, the school became Kempsville Intermediate, to house 6th and 7th graders, but was renamed Kemps Landing School in 1967. In 1983, due to community needs, the school was changed for usage of 7th graders only. From September 1988 to October 2001, Kemps Landing School housed 6th and 7th graders. Since 2001, this building has intermittently housed students from various grade levels while their home school was renovated or newly constructed.\n\nMore history about this school is featured in a local blog called \"Before There Was a Kemps Landing School\".\n\nLittle Creek Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1954\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe school was built in 1954 at a cost of $475,000. The school was the result of the merger of Princess Anne County and the resort city of Virginia Beach in 1963. Originally, Little Creek Elementary was part of the Norfolk City Public School system.\n\nOceana Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1929\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe school was built in 1929 at a cost of $100,000. A ten room addition and cafeteria were added in 1945 at a cost of $120,000. The school served as a high and elementary school until 1954.\n\nOceana High\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nOceana High fell victim to her own geography, being located at the end of the main runway for Oceana Naval Air Station. With the Navy's transition to jet aircraft after World War II, the noise level made teaching (and concentration) difficult. The post war building boom in Virginia Beach (as well as the baby boom) had also dictated the need for more classrooms, so, for the first time, Virginia Beach had its own high school, rather than sending students to Princess Anne County schools.\n\nOld Donation Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1965\n\nFirst Principal: Grey Cassell\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nOn January 27, 1965, the Virginia Beach City School Board paid Mr. W.D. Hobbs, Jr. $4,653 for 13.1 acres of truck farm land located in the Bayside Borough of Virginia Beach. Later in 1965, Haycox Construction Company was contracted to construct a twenty-nine classroom, \"T\" shaped school, designed by Waller and Britt, an architectural firm, for the sum of $450,063. The school opened on September 3, 1965 with Mr. Grey Cassell as the first principal. For the first two years, the 29 classrooms housed grades 1 through 7. The next three years, it had grades 1 through 5, returning to grades 1 through 7. Enrollment was near 865. When Newtown Road Elementary was opened in 1970, the enrollment was reduced to near 550 students. The school housed regular classes and some special classes. In 1980, the school was named Old Donation Center for the Gifted and Talented.\n\nOpen Campus High\n\nOpening Date: 1989\n\nFirst Principal: Lillian Donnally\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe school was designed in 1988 – 1989 at the request of the School Board and implemented in October 1989 at Princess Anne High School. In July 1990, the school was moved to the Career Development Center. The school was returned to Princess Anne High School at the request of the School Board in March 1991.\n\nIn the Annual Fiscal Plan (Budget) for 1990 – 1991, the School Board recommended that the Princess Anne (then the Thalia) Center for Pregnant Teens be incorporated as a part of the Open Campus High School.\n\nIn July 1990 it was recommended that the program be expanded to include a day component and that a day facility be sought for the program. A presentation to the School Board in December 1990 recommended that the hours of the program be expanded and a facility be sought for the program. The School Board voted on recommendations expanding the Open Campus High School in March 1991.\n\nPlaza Elementary\n\nOpening Date: 1961\n\nFirst Principal: Mable Church\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nPlaza Elemenetary was built in 1961 as part of the Princess Anne County. Mable Church was appointed as Plaza's first principal from 1961 to1969. The school originally served students in grades one through seven. In 1973, kindergarten was added and grade seven was moved to the junior high school. A non-graded program for primary children was in effect in the late sixties. In 1973, Plaza took part in the first pilot program of year-round schools. By 1975, the school area was rezoned and assumed the present 10-month attendance pattern.\n\nA gymnasium was added to the school in 1990. In addition, renovations were made to the school and a dedication ceremony was held on December 7, 1999. Also, Plaza Elementary was instrumental in initiating the job sharing option for teachers.\n\nPleasant Ridge School (formerly Charity Neck School)\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nThe building was constructed in the 1880s on Charity Neck Road as a two-room school (Charity Neck School) for white children. It ended its service as a one-room school (Pleasant Ridge School) for blacks. Around 1915, Pleasant Ridge School, burned down. The “big room” of the old Charity Neck School was placed on skids and pulled by horses to replace the burned-out Pleasant Ridge School. The building has been in that location next to Asbury church ever since.\n\nThe school served African American children in grades 1-7. Grades 1 through 4 went to school from\n\n7:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. and fifth through seventh graders attended classes from 11:30 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. from September through March, to give the children time to help plant the crops. Two outhouses were available - one for girls and one for boys.\n\nThe heat came from a wood stove and the children had to get there early to gather wood for the fire. The first person to school in the morning made the fire in the stove inside the school. Later, the School Board provided a coal stove, and once a week, a pot of beans and cocoa were cooked on the stove. At other times, baskets of fruit were supplied.\n\nThe school closed in 1955 and the building was donated to Asbury church. In 1990, discussions began to refurbish the school. Former Councilwoman Barbara Henley served on the committee. Others included Alvin and Sadie Lamb, Doris Davenport (student), Lillian Craft and Nina Williams. They had a fried chicken dinner, initially, to help raise money to restore the school. When funds and the committee's steam started running out, former Sheriff Frank Drew offered to donate materials and the Community Work Force from the jail to help finish the job. The Renovation Project was completed in 1997 by the Sheriff Frank Drew Community work Force in cooperation with Councilwoman Barbara Henley.\n\nThe school was rededicated on November 18, 1997. The schoolhouse is located on the east side of Princess Anne Road in southern Pungo and next to Asbury United Methodist Church and represents a historic remembrance of early education in Virginia Beach, formerly Princess Anne County.\n\nPrincess Anne County Training School/Union Kempsville High School\n\nOpening Date:\n\nFirst Principal:\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nUnion Kempsville High was established to give African American students in Princess Anne County a school near their homes. Because the county did not operate educational facilities for black children, many parents paid for tuition and transportation costs to send their children to Booker T. Washington High in Norfolk for a secondary education. In the 1930s, black parents in Princess Anne County united to open their own school.\n\nAlong with black business and community leaders, black parents formed an association and began raising money to purchase property for a high school. They eventually bought four acres of land on Witchduck Road. The land and $2,000 were given to the county School Board for the construction of a school. When the School Board made no attempts to establish a high school on the site, parents formed a temporary school at Union Baptist Church in 1934. The school initially served grades eight through eleven, but eventually expanded to include the twelfth grade.\n\nSeveral years later, the School Board finally approved the high school. A four-room Princess Anne Training School opened in 1938 with the help of federal funds and donations from the black community. The building lacked some of the resources of white schools. However, It had outdoor toilets, no cafeteria or science laboratories and only a dictionary in the library.\n\nThroughout the years, parents, students and the community held talent shows, dinners and other activities to raise money to buy materials, supplies, furniture and other items to support the school’s programs and students. Several additions were incorporated at the school between 1949 and 1962. Despite the lack of structural amenities and educational resources, the students were nonetheless able to learn and thrive because of teachers, support staff and parents who always encouraged them to work hard and succeed.\n\nThe name of the school was changed to Union Kempsville High in 1962. In 1969, desegregation led to declining enrollment and the school closed its doors. The school division eventually re-opened the original building as the headquarters of its School Plant. The school’s addition later became the Center for Effective Learning, an alternative school for middle school students.\n\nIn 2007, alumni and former teachers celebrated the school’s past by participating in the Last Walk, an event that gave them an opportunity to walk through the school and recall their old school days one more time. A few months later, the building was demolished for the construction of the Renaissance Academy which now houses all the school division’s secondary alternative programs as well as the Princess Anne County Training School/Union Kempsville High Museum.\n\nThe museum’s exhibition, Reflections on a Legacy, beautifully represents the achievements of the students and staff and their beloved school.\n\nVirginia Beach High\n\nOpening Date: 1952\n\nFirst Principal: James A. Johnson\n\nInteresting Facts:\n\nOverview\n\nIn 1952, at a cost of $1,000,000, Virginia Beach High was built as a replacement for Oceana High. It was occupied for the first time in September 1952 and closed in 1965."
