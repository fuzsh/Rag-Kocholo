After Luke Ridnour was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the thought was he and his $2.85 million non-guaranteed contract were going to get waived. Instead, Ridnour has been dealt for a fourth time in less than a week, this time to the Toronto Raptors, according to Darnell Mayberry of The Oklahoman.

The Thunder sent cash to the Raptors in the deal, and Oklahoma City gets the draft rights to Tomislav Zubcic. A $2.85 million trade exception has also been created for the Thunder, which they may or may not use.

Just one week ago, Ridnour was on the Orlando Magic, the team he played for last season. He's since taken a journey to four different teams, and we'll see if he sticks in Toronto.

Ridnour was first traded from the Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies for the rights to Janis Timma. Ridnour was then flipped to the Charlotte Hornets for Matt Barnes. The Hornets then sent Ridnour to the Thunder for Jeremy Lamb. And now, Ridnour is headed to Toronto.
