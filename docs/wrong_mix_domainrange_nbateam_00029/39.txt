The Oklahoma City Thunder announced they have acquired guard Luke Ridnour and a future draft pick in a trade with the Charlotte Hornets for guard Jeremy Lamb. According to a press release, the Thunder pick up Ridnour, a 12-year NBA veteran, and a conditional 2016 second round draft pick from Charlotte in exchange for Lamb. The Thunder acquired Lamb in a trade for James Harden with the Houston Rockets in 2012. In three seasons with the Thunder, Lamb averaged 7 points, 2 rebounds and 1 assists. Ridnour spent the 2014-15 season with the Orlando Magic. He was acquired by the Memphis Grizzlies Thursday before being traded to Charlotte in a separate transaction.
