Luke Ridnour has had quite the NBA journey over the last week after being traded four times in six days.

The former Orlando Magic point guard was first traded to the Memphis Grizzlies last Wednesday, setting the cycle in motion.

Less than 24 hours later, he was shipped to the Charlotte Hornets from Memphis for veteran forward Matt Barnes. But fewer than three hours after that, Ridnour was sent (along with a 2016 second-round pick) to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Jeremy Lamb.

But the whirlwind didn't end there. On Thursday, the Thunder traded Ridnour to the Toronto Raptors, making for his fifth team of the off-season.

• What could Luke Ridnour have done in his three hours as a Hornet?

If all of that seems hard to follow, just imagine being the man in question. Ridnour was on Mike & Mike on Wednesday and offered a pretty honest assessment of his strange week.

“It’s funny, I didn’t even know some of the trades that happened,” he said.

For now, Ridnour remains a Raptor, though there's plenty of off-season left to go.
