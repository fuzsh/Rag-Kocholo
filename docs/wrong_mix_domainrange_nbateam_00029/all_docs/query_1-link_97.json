        "text": "(TORONTO) — In a sentence that’s becoming commonplace this summer, Luke Ridnour, the veteran NBA point guard, has been traded.\n\nRidnour has been dealt four times since the NBA season ended, in part because his contract does not become guaranteed until July 11. Since the season’s end, Ridnour has been sent from the Orlando Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies, to the Charlotte Hornets, to the Oklahoma City Thunder and now to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nRidnour, 34, has played in 12 NBA seasons, appearing in 47 games last year for Orlando.\n\nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
