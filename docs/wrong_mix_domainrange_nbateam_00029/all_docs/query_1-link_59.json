        "text": "After being traded four different times this offseason, Luke Ridnour finally will have a chance to choose for himself where he'd like to play next season.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors waived Ridnour on Thursday on the same day they officially announced that forward DeMarre Carroll had signed a multiyear contract.\n\nToronto had acquired Ridnour and cash considerations from the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 30 for the rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nRidnour's trade to the Raptors was the fourth time he had been traded in a week.The 34-year-old guard has a fully nonguaranteed contract for next season, which made him a very tradable asset.\n\nHe had been acquired by the Thunder on June 25 in a deal with the Charlotte Hornets that moved Jeremy Lamb. That was the second time he was traded that day as the Memphis Grizzlies had dealt him to the Hornets forforward Matt Barnes.\n\nHis wild trade journey began on June 24 when the Orlando Magic had dealt him to the Grizzliesfor the rights to forward Janis Timma.\n\nHe was able to laugh at his journey in an interview with ESPN Radio's Mike and Mike on July 1.\n\n\"To be honest, it's been pretty funny for us,\" Ridnour said. \"Being in the NBA, you never know what's going to happen and coming into free agency, I knew I had a contract that was desirable for a trade chip or whatever it might be. Getting the updates daily was pretty funny.\""
