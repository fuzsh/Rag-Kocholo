        "text": "His career at Oregon spoke for itself. Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2003. Two-time All-Pac-10 during his time with the Ducks. It seemed to all be working out for Luke Ridnour.\n\nSometimes things don't go according to plan.\n\nIt wasn't that he was a complete flop. He contributed to the Northwest Division championship in 2005 by starting all 82 games, and averaging 10 points a game, to go along with almost 6 assists and just over a steal a game. Ridnour also contributed in the playoffs, helping the Sonics push the Spurs to six games in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nHe was also part of the last Seattle Supersonics team to make the playoffs before they relocated to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nWhat Luke Ridnour might be most famous for now though is the fact that he has been traded four times this off-season. In June, the Orlando Magic traded him to Memphis. Then, the next day, he was shipped off to Charlotte (where he had played in 2014). Then he was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Then, finally at the end of June, he was moved yet again, this time to Toronto for Tomislav Zubcic. Some players would have some anxiety over all the movement, but Ridnour took it all with a grain of salt.\n\n\"I've got a lot of texts from friends and family worried about it\", Ridnour told USA Today. \"It really hasn't affected us at all. It's been pretty funny...\"\n\nThe next bit of news for the former Sonic guard was not.\n\nA month ago, he was waived by the Raptors. After all the shuffling, he ended up with no team. It seemed like something out of a crazy comedy with Will Ferrell.\n\nIt would truly be a shame if this was the end of the road for a true class act. He would be a marvelous backup on any team, providing some spark and much needed veteran advice for a young team. Maybe a contender like Cleveland, Golden State, the Clippers or Chicago could use him in a limited role.\n\nRidnour doesn't seem to be too worried about his employment situation, as evidenced by his interview in July with Rolling Stone.\n\n\"I still have to decide whether or not I'm playing next year, so I'm not sure (on any specific team he'd want to play for). If this had been happening earlier in my career, four or five years ago, I might have been worried. But not now\".\n\nSpoken like a cool customer."
