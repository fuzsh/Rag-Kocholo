        "text": "There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and Luke Ridnour being traded.\n\nThe 34-year-old point guard was shipped from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday, along with cash, in exchange for a trade exception and the rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nRidnour averaged just four points and two assists per game last season, so what’s the big deal? Well, let’s just say he’s had a busy few days.\n\nRidnour was on the Orlando Magic until June 24, when he was shipped to the Memphis Grizzlies for a draft pick. One day later, the Grizzlies sent him to the Charlotte Hornets in return for Matt Barnes. Just hours later, Ridnour was on the move again, this time to the Thunder along with a draft pick for Jeremy Lamb.\n\nIn short, Ridnour has been traded four times. In the last six days.\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/cbssportsnba/status/615916396313120768 align=’center’]\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/DanLevyThinks/status/615922711857115136 align=’center’]\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/EthanJSkolnick/status/615895390202761216 align=’center’]\n\nAccording to a Reddit user, Ridnour has passed Drew Gooden as the most traded active NBA player. According to NBA.com’s John Schuhmann, Ridnour’s summer of adventure might not be over.\n\n[tweet https://twitter.com/johnschuhmann/status/615894005138616320 align=’center’]\n\nDon’t unpack those bags, Luke.\n\nThumbnail photo via Brett Davis/USA TODAY Sports Images"
