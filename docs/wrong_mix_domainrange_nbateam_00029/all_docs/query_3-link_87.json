        "text": "Luke and Kate Ridnour love their kids, basketball, and their community. That’s why they founded The Ridnour Athletic Center (also known as The RAC) in conjunction with Rids Kids, their 501 (c) 3 non-profit foundation.\n\nThe RAC is open to the community and offers student-athletes — starting in Kindergarten — the opportunity to train and play basketball and other sports in a safe, positive and family-friendly environment.\n\n“We wanted to create a top-tier gym where kids can have fun, chase their sports dreams, and build memories,” says Luke, who played basketball at the University of Oregon and in the NBA. “We offer training for the recreationally-minded all the way up to those pursuing elite-level competition.”\n\nRids Kids’ is at the heart of the Ridnour’s vision to give back to their community and The RAC is the platform for all the foundation’s work, including:\n\nHosting tournaments\n\nProviding basketball training for athletes of all levels.\n\nHolding weekly open-gyms\n\nServing as the hub for community-service activations.\n\nKate says, “Anything we can do to help kids and families is a win.”\n\nBecause we are a non-profit foundation all fees that we have for The RAC and Rids Kids are suggested donations. All donations are used to provide scholarships for underprivileged children, operate the RAC, and to do community-service projects to lift up families in need."
