        "text": "Thunder guard Jeremy Lamb has been traded to Charlotte.\n\nIn exchange for the fourth-year shooting guard, the Hornets are sending Oklahoma City veteran point guard Luke Ridnour and a 2016 second-round draft pick.\n\nRidnour, however, has a non-guaranteed contract and will be waived at zero cost to the Thunder, effectively making the deal a salary dump for OKC.\n\nYahoo! Sports first reported the trade.\n\nThe Thunder also needed to declutter its roster to open a spot for whatever player it might select in Thursday night’s NBA Draft, as well as make room for Josh Huestis, last year’s first-round selection. After releasing Ridnour, the team’s roster will stand at 14 players, one below the maximum allowable under league rules.\n\nMore moves possibly could come during Thursday night’s draft or potentially linger into the start of training camp. Reserve forwards Perry Jones and Steve Novak are the two next most likely candidates to be moved.\n\nIn the case of Lamb, it had become clear since mid-December, when he fell out of former Thunder coach Scott Brooks’ rotation, that his days in Oklahoma City were numbered. Lamb appeared in only 23 games after New Year’s Eve, totaling just 123 minutes, most of those coming in garbage time.\n\nPHOTO: Jeremy Lamb thanks Thunder fans, teammates following trade\n\nLamb, the former 12th overall pick in 2012 who was acquired from Houston in the James Harden trade, bounced in and out of the lineup during his three seasons with the Thunder, displaying occasional flashes of his potential but never putting forth enough consistency on both ends to require steady playing time. At his exit interview in April, Lamb openly expressed his willingness to move on if it meant landing a chance to play.\n\n“I just want an opportunity,” Lamb said. “I’m focused on getting better. If the opportunity is here or it’s somewhere else, I can’t really focus on that. I’m just going to try to get better, work on my game, focus on my game and whatever happens, happens.”\n\nThe deal allows the Thunder to shed Lamb’s $3 million salary for next season from its payroll. That money would then be set aside to help the Thunder in its stated goal of re-signing restricted free agents Enes Kanter and Kyle Singler.\n\nBut by cutting ties with Lamb, the Thunder’s total savings next season could be upward of $6 million when its tax computations are figured in. That money, though, would be reinvested in Kanter and Singler.\n\nLamb averaged 7.0 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 148 games with the Thunder."
