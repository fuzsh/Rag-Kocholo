        "text": "When veteran NBA point guard Luke Ridnour woke up Wednesday, he was a member of the Orlando Magic. Now he’s joining the Oklahoma City Thunder as Russell Westbrook’s backup. But not before spending “time” with two other teams.\n\nIn a head-spinning sequence of trades, Ridnour was dealt three separate times in a 24-hour span, turning his name into what appeared to be a glitch on the transaction wire.\n\nUPDATE: Ridnour was traded again! That brings the total to four in seven days.\n\nWelcome to NBA silly season, when superstars like LaMarcus Aldridge get wined and diner at the most attractive free-agent destinations and the likes of Luke Ridnour get passed around like a Craigslist couch.\n\nRidnour, 34, has been traded more times this week and in his 12 previous seasons in the NBA (three times). He averaged 4.0 points and 2.0 rebounds in 47 games for the Magic last season."
