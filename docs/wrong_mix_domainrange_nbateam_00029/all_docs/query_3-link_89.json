For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” – 2 Corinthians 4:18\n\nAfter spending the first part of my life thinking basketball was the be-all, end-all of my existence, this verse finally put things into perspective. Throughout high school, basketball was my life. I didn’t want to be known for anything other than my accomplishments on the court. But even though I was blessed with many achievements and rewards, I still didn’t have peace. The problem was, basketball was just a game; I was treating it like it was a god.\n\nIt wasn’t until college that I was finally able to see this clearly.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, there was no way basketball could ever give me the lasting sense of fulfillment and meaning I craved. The only one who could provide those things was God.\n\nThat truth has become even more real to me since entering the NBA. Even though I now have more success, fame, and money than I ever dreamed, my relationship with God is the only thing that brings me true peace and satisfaction.\n\nWhat are your eyes fixed on: the seen or the unseen? Don’t settle for temporary satisfaction when you can have it for eternity. There is only room for one god in your life. So make sure you’ve chosen the One who can give your life meaning both now and forever.\n\n— Luke Ridnour, NBA player"
