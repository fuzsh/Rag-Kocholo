        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A talented point guard who does a great job getting his teammates involved, but may be quite good enough to start for a winning team. Decent height for the point guard spot, but lacks strength significantly. Has a decent first step, and is capable of beating his man off the dribble on occasion. Lack of strength and explosiveness hurts him when he tries to finish. Doesnt jump high enough to make plays at the rim. Doesnt get to the free throw line at a great rate. Possesses average shooting touch from the outside. Does not make many 3-pointers. Smart offensive player. Makes good decisions when deciding between passing and shooting. Good at setting up teammates. A bit too turnover prone. Poor defender. Put together a nice career at Oregon. Won the PAC 10 Player of the Year Award as a junior, his last season in college. Doesnt look to score as much in the NBA as he did in college. Good team player. Trying to turn over a new leaf in Milwaukee, after struggling in his role as a starter in Seattle.\n\nOffense: A talented distributor who can also do some scoring from the perimeter. Gets over half of his offense as the point guard in pick and roll situations, where he reads defenses well and displays nice timing and court vision. Doesnt look to score as often as he does to set the table. Displays nice shooting mechanics, but is a fairly unimpressive 3-point shooter both in terms of quantity and consistency. Much better from mid-range. Will do most of his damage pulling up off the dribble. Loves to turn the corner on the pick and roll and hit a teammate rolling for easy baskets. Isnt able to finish these plays very well on his own, making him somewhat limited offensively. Doesnt finish well at the rim due to his lack of strength and explosiveness. Not strong enough to take contact and get the ball on the rim. Gets to the free throw line at an average rate, but shoots a great percentage once there. Nice short range floater. Much prefers to drive right to get in the lane. Good ball handler in the open floor, but does not have the quickness to dribble himself out of trouble if trapped, making him very turnover prone throughout his career. Possesses very good court vision and passing ability regardless. Can score, but is valuable because of his status as a pure point guard. May struggle to establish himself as a starter on a winning team due to his lack of individual shot-creating ability coupled with his high turnover rate and below average 3-point stroke.\n\nDefense: A mediocre defender who doesnt have the lateral quickness necessary to be an impact player. Will get beat off the dribble from time to time. Lacks the strength to avoid being posted up inside. Shows very impressive hand quickness and anticipation. Will create some turnovers, but that doesnt compensate for his lack of impact in other areas. Needs to show better intensity and do a better job staying on his man."
