        "text": "Yet another relic of the Seattle SuperSonics is saying goodbye to the game.\n\nHaving played 12 seasons in the NBA, 35-year-old point guard Luke Ridnour told David Rasbach of the Bellingham Herald that he's officially retired.\n\n\"I'm retired,\" Ridnour said. \"I’m not going to go back. I think I knew it last summer, I just didn’t say it.\"\n\nThe former 14th pick of the 2003 draft saw time with the SuperSonics, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Minnesota Timberwolves as a steady hand at point guard before pinballing around the league as a journeyman."
