        "text": "Greg Oden\n\nSept. 2007 — Micro fracture surgery on right knee\n\nDec. 2009 — Fractured left patella\n\nNov. 2010 — Micro fracture surgery on left knee\n\nDec. 2011 — Arthroscopic surgery on right knee\n\nUnfortunately, Trail Blazer fans everywhere already know how drafting Greg Oden over Kevin Durant worked out for their team. After being be the #1 selection in the 2007 NBA Draft, Oden was never able to play a full season due to ongoing knee injuries. The team eventually waived him in March of 2012.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nDennis Dixon\n\nNov. 2007 — Torn left ACL\n\nDuring the 2007 season Dixon had the Oregon Ducks as the #2 team in the country. That was until he suffered a torn ACL against Arizona State and attempted to play on it the following week against Arizona. After Dixon went down for the season the Ducks lost their remaining two regular season games. Fortunately, they were able to end their season on a high note with a victory over South Florida in the 2007 Sun Bowl.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nBrandon Roy\n\nSept. 2008 — Cartilage removed from left knee\n\nApril 2010 — Meniscus tear in right knee\n\nJan. 2011 — Arthroscopic surgery on both knees\n\nBrandon Roy is perhaps one of the most beloved Trail Blazers in the history of the franchise. After being drafted in 2006, and leading the team out of the \"Jail-Blazer\" era, he had to make the tough decision to retire at the young age of 28. His degenerative knees prevented Rip City from seeing their superstar ever play to his full potential.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nJacquizz Rodgers\n\nNov. 2008 — Grade II separation of the acromioclavicular joint\n\nDuring the second to last game in 2008 Jacquizz Rodgers suffered a separated shoulder that ended his season. Unfortunately, this meant that he wasn't able to play in the Civil War, which was perhaps the biggest game of the year for the Beavers. If the Beavers had been able to defeat the Ducks they would've been able to book their tickets to play in the Rose Bowl. Instead, they went to the Sun Bowl where they defeated the Pittsburgh Panthers.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nJames Rodgers\n\nOct. 2009 — Torn left ACL\n\nAfter participating in only 4 games during the 2009 season Rodgers went down with a torn ACL while playing against #9 Arizona. This couldn't have come at a worse time for Rodgers considering he was expected to have a breakout season. Rodgers, who was a senior at the time, was able to end his career at Oregon State as the career leader in all-purpose yards.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nJoel Pryzbilla\n\nDec. 2009 — Ruptured right patella tendon and dislocated patella\n\nIn December of 2009 the Trail Blazers' backup center, Joel Pryzbilla, was lost for the season with a ruptured and dislocated patella. This was a huge blow to the Trailblazers' frontcourt because they had already lost Oden for the season a few weeks before. Pryzbilla was also the team's defensive anchor who provided an inside presence. \"The Vanilla Gorilla\" was sorely missed for the rest of the year.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropepd)\n\nLaMichael James\n\nOct. 2011 — Dislocated right elbow\n\nThe 2011 season couldn't have started any better for LaMichael James. After the first game James became Oregon's career rushing leader, surpassing Derek Loville. During the second game he rushed for over 200 yards against Missouri State. Unfortunately, James' year was slowed by a dislocated elbow suffered against Cal. Luckily for Duck fans he was able to return to end the season.\n\nPhoto via Facebook (image cropped)\n\nNate Costa\n\nNov. 2010 —Torn Right ACL\n\nAfter suffering a multitude of knee injuries throughout his career at Oregon Costa was forced to officially retire from football after tearing his ACL for the third time in agame against Washington. Although Costa's career was hobbled by injuries many of his teammates looked to him as their leader. Oregon's coaching staff referred to Costa as the \"heart and soul\" of the 2010 team that won the Rose Bowl.\n\nPhoto via Addictedtoquack (image cropped)\n\nSean Mannion\n\nOct. 2012 — Torn Left Meniscus\n\nDuring the beginning of the 2012-2013 season, Sean Mannion was enjoying one of his best as a Beaver. Unfortunately, he tore his left meniscus against Washington State that resulted in him missing around half the season. With Mannion leading the way the Beavers had the Pac-12's fourth rated offense, averaging 459.5 yeards per game. With Mannion sidelined Cody Vaz became the starting quarterback\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nMarcus Mariota\n\nOct. 2013 — Partial MCL Tear\n\nMarcus Mariota is widely regarded as one of the greatest Oregon Duck quarterbacks to ever play at Autzen. Unfortunately a knee injury hobbled his sophomore season. After Mariota suffered a partial MCL tear against UCLA he conintued to play the remainder of the season. With Mariota's knee not allowing him to be as mobile as he was accustomed to teams were able to take advantage. In the weeks following the injury the Ducks suffered losses to Stanford and Arizona. Duck fans everywhere would like to know what that season woud've loked like if Mariota had stayed healthy.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nCJ McCollum\n\nOct. 2013 — Broken fifth Metatarsal In Left Foot\n\nAfter being taken 10th overall during the 2013 NBA Draft the shooting guard out of Lehigh wasn't able to start his career the way many had hoped. After breaking the fifth metatarsal bone in his left foot the rookie wasn't able to take the court until January of 2014. Before the injury McCollum was in consideration for playing time behind Lillard.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nAlex Morgan\n\nOct. 2013 — Stress reaction in talus bone\n\nDuring the 2013 season Morgan suffered an injury that doctors misdiagnosed as a mildly sprained ankle. After a few additional tests were performed it turned out that Morgan had suffered a far more serious injury. She actually suffered a stress reaction in the talus bone that put her immediate future with Team USA in question. After rehabbing for 7 months Morgan was able to make a full recovery.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nBralon Addison\n\nApril 2014 — Torn left ACL\n\nAfter exceeding expectations as a freshman and sophomore at the University of Oregon Addison was expecting big things from his junior year. Unfortunately, Addison suffered a torn ACL during last year's spring practice that kept him sidelined the entire year. Without Addison in the lineup the receiving core never lived up to their full potential. If he had been able to play this season the National Championship may have wielded a different outcome.\n\nPhoto via Facebook (image cropped)\n\nIfo Ekpre-Olomu\n\nDec. 2014 — Torn ACL\n\nIn preparation for the first ever college football playoffs Ekpre-Olomu ended up tearing his ACL during a routine practice. This was a huge blow to the Ducks considering Ekpre-Olomu was one of the team's better defenders. He was also one of the best corners in the country who many analysists expected to be selected as high as the first round of the 2015 NFL Draft.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)\n\nWesley Matthews\n\nMarch 2015 — Torn left achilles\n\nJust 2 months before Matthews suffered a torn achilles he had become the Trailblazers' all-time leader in 3-point field goals made. It looked as though the Trailblazers were poised to make a deep playoff run. Things took a drastic turn when Matthews was lost for the season. With the team in a 0-2 hole against the Memphis Grizzlies it doesn't look as though they will be making it to the second round of the playoffs this year.\n\nPhoto via Wikipedia (image cropped)"
