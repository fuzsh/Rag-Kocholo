That's why we are asking you to invest in us.\n\nSince 1916, the Daily has served the Norman and OU communities with free independent journalism, with all decisions made locally with no administrative, governmental or corporate influence. We provide Norman with the city's largest reporting staff, drawn from one of the nation's top journalism colleges. Our coverage is routinely honored at state and national levels. And we're advised by a veteran professional staff with a mission to help us build on our legacy as a launching pad for media professionals.\n\nOU students pay about $14 in annual fees that help support the Daily. If you find value in our work and are not a student, please consider matching or exceeding that with a one-time or recurring donation. In an era when subscriptions to paywalled news organizations routinely exceed $100 annually, grassroots support from readers like you can collectively make a transformative difference in our organization."
