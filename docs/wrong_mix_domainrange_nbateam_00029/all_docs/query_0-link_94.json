Milwaukee scored the last 8 points to get the 128-122 win over the Thunder. The Thunder couldn't find an answer in the second overtime as Jeff Green barely missed a contested shot in the paint to win the game . Luke Ridnour got his career high 15 assist and along with that 24 points and 5 rebounds. Scoring wasn't a factor for the Thunder as they had four with 20 or more points, but rebounding was. Andrew Bogut about out rebounded the Thunder with 20 rebounds while the Thunder had 26 team rebounds. Kevin Durant will try to help his team get a road victory when they play the Houston Rockets this Saturday.\n\nScoreBoard 1 2 3 4 OT\n\nMilwaukee Bucks 27 22 23 28 28\n\nOK.

Yao had 25 pts, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks. Alston and T-Mac also contributed to the win by combining for 36 points and 11 assist. Durant lead the Thunder with 20 points and 9 rebounds and Russell Westbrook lead in assist (12).\n\nThe Rockets out rebounded the Thunder(33 to 24) which lead to 16 second chance points. The Thunder go back home to play the Timberwolves, hoping for the first win of the season.\n\nScoreboard 1 2 3 4\n\nThunder 26 22 23 24 95\n\nRockets 23 35 23 23 104\n\nAround the League\n\nPistons sign Dekembe Mutumbo to 1 year /473k\n\nRockets Sign Alonzo Mourning to 1 year /2.65m\n\nPlayers of the Week\n\nWestern Conference: Russell Westbrook\n\nEastern Conference: Lebron James\n\nPost by btown5 on\n\nI have finished the next two games and will put them up later tonight..\n\nIf you read the thread tell me what you like and what should i add or improve"
