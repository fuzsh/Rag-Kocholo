        "text": "The Toronto Raptors have acquired point guard Luke Ridnour from the Oklahoma City Thunder. Ridnour is a steady veteran that seems to have played everywhere in the league. In fact, this is the 4th time he’s been traded this summer. It is doubtful that he plays a minute for the Raptors, as it is being reported that he will be waived or traded.\n\nBasically, it seems like he was acquired in case the Raps needed a salary filler in a trade. However, he can’t be packaged with another player, so it’s hard to see a favourable scenario. It didn’t cost them anything, except the rights to Zubcic, so whatever. They also get some cash, while OKC gets a trade exception. The Raps basically did OKC a favor."
