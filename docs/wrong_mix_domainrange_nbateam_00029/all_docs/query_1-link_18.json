        "text": "Glenn James/Getty Images\n\nLuke Ridnour has become the most popular man in the NBA, as the veteran guard has been traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nAccording to a release from the Thunder's official website, the team acquired a trade exception and rights to Tomislav Zubcic for Ridnour and cash considerations.\n\nThis marks the fourth time in less than one week Ridnour has been dealt. He started the summer as a member of the Orlando Magic before being dealt on June 24 to Memphis, which shipped him to Charlotte on June 25 before Oklahoma City acquired him later that same day.\n\nEven though the 34-year-old is coming off a season with Orlando in which he averaged a career-low four points in 47 games played, his contract is very appealing to teams.\n\nAccording to John Schuhmann of NBA.com, Ridnour's contract for 2015-16 is not yet guaranteed:\n\nRidnour is scheduled to make $2.75 million in the final year of a two-year deal he signed with the Magic last season, which Schuhmann noted on Twitter is the fourth-largest non-guaranteed deal in the NBA.\n\nGiven the way teams are always searching for financial flexibility, Ridnour's whirlwind summer may not be done yet.\n\nHe's been a declining player for the last two years, averaging less than 20 minutes per game with a low scoring output, so being able to use him to benefit the salary cap is something a lot of teams have been taking advantage of this offseason."
