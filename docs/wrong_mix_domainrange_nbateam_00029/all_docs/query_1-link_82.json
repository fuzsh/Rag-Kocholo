        "text": "TORONTO — The Toronto Raptors have acquired Luke Ridnour and cash from Oklahoma City.\n\nIt’s the fourth time in the past week that the veteran guard has been traded.\n\nThe Raptors sent the rights to 2012 draft pick Tomislav Zubcic to the Thunder.\n\nRidnour started last week with the Orlando Magic, who traded him to Memphis on Wednesday the draft rights to 2013 second-round pick Janis Timma. The next day he was dealt twice at the NBA draft. The Grizzlies sent him to Charlotte for Matt Barnes, then the Hornets flipped him plus a draft pick to the Thunder for guard Jeremy Lamb.\n\nThe six-foot-two, 175-pound Ridnour has averaged 9.3 points, 4.5 assists, one steals and 26.1 minutes in 830 career games.\n\nHe averaged four points, two assists and 1.4 rebounds a game last season with the Magic."
