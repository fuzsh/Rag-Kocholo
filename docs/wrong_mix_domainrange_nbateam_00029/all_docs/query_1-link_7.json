        "text": "Luke Ridnour retiring\n\nRidnour ended up sitting out the 2015-16 NBA season and ultimately announced his plans to retire on Tuesday, June 21, while discussing the third annual Luke Ridnour Basketball Camp he will host July 27-29 at Blaine High School. “I’m retired. I’m not going to go back. I think I knew it last summer, I just didn’t say it,” said Ridnour, who helped lead Blaine to 1999 and 2000 Class 2A high school state titles before playing collegiately at the University of Oregon.\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 2 more rumors\n\nLuke Ridnour to retire?\n\nAfter being traded four times this offseason, NBA free-agent guard Luke Ridnour has made a move that will keep him from getting dealt next season and possibly ever again. Ridnour has decided that he will not play the 2015-16 NBA season, a source told Yahoo Sports. The 12-year NBA veteran has not announced his retirement although his return to professional basketball appears doubtful. Ridnour received interest in free agency, but it wasn’t reciprocated.\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 2 more rumors\n\nMe: Where have you been holed up during all of this? Luke Ridnour: I’ve just been outside of Seattle. I’ve just been at home. It really hasn’t been that crazy, just because you’re not going to any of those places. It’s not like you’re going and checking out the town and all of that, getting traded. I knew with my contract, there was a chance I would get traded once or twice. It’s been a little more than anyone expected. But where I’m at, if this was four or five years ago, it might have affected me a little more. But I’m not that bothered right now. I don’t even know if I’m going to play next year or not. But it’s been kind of funny. I’m just taking it for what it is."
