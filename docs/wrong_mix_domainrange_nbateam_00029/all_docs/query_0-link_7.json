Four!\n\nUpdate: Tuesday, June 30\n\nRidnour is on the move again! According to Darnell Mayberry of the Oklahoman, he is on his way to Toronto:\n\nB/R\n\nThat makes four trades in a week for the veteran.\n\n--End of Update--\n\nFirst, the Orlando Magic, with whom he spent the 2014-15 season, dealt him to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday morning:\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Ridnour found himself on the Charlotte Hornets, who then flipped him to the Oklahoma City Thunder:\n\nAccording to NBA.com's David Aldridge, the veteran could still be on the move:\n\nAt some point, Ridnour should shut off his phone, close his eyes and fall into a Rip Van Winkle-caliber slumber.\n\nWhen he awakens, the onslaught of #WojBombs will be over, and hopefully—for his sanity, at least—he'll have finally found a concrete home...somewhere."
