        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Luke Ridnour may be in need of a rest — or a good travel agent — after being traded for the fourth time in less than a week.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder sent the veteran guard and cash to the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday in exchange for a trade exception and the rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.\n\nIt was just the latest move for Ridnour: After averaging 4 points and 2 assists for Orlando last season, he was dealt to Charlotte last Wednesday in a deal involving Memphis and then almost immediately sent to the Thunder along with a conditional 2016 second-round draft pick for guard Jeremy Lamb.\n\nAnd now he's on the move again. Ridnour has played for five NBA teams in 12 years, and the former Oregon Duck has a career scoring average of 9.3 points per game.\n\nThe Thunder will have one year to exercise the trade exception. Zubcic was the 56th overall pick in the 2012 draft and has yet to play in the NBA."
