        "text": "There were originally reports that the Oklahoma City Thunder were trading Jeremy Lamb for Matt Barnes.\n\nThings have since changed. The Memphis Grizzlies have now traded veteran point guard Luke Ridnour to Charlotte for Matt Barnes.\n\nFor Charlotte, they did this move because they can clear up cap space by waiving Luke Ridnour at no cost, versus if they were to waive Matt Barnes, they would have to pay the $1 million guaranteed.\n\nThe Grizzlies are the winner of this deal. They now have good depth in the back-court with Matt Barnes, Tony Allen, and Jeff Green. Barnes provides depth especially at the wing position. He brings the threat of a three point shot along with a decent defensive presence.\n\nThere will likely be more trades that go down throughout the day since tonight is the 2015 NBA draft.
