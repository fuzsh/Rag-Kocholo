        "text": "CHARLOTTE, USA – Luke Ridnour must be dreading every time his phone rings at this point.\n\nThe 34-year-old guard went to bed on Tuesday night to news that he had been traded from the Orlando Magic to the Memphis Grizzlies for the rights to Janis Timma.\n\nBefore the following day was over, Memphis had traded Ridnour to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for 35-year-old journeyman Matt Barnes. Within hours, Charlotte dealt Ridnour to Oklahoma City for Jeremy Lamb and a 2016 second round draft pick.\n\nAccording to NBA reporter David Aldridge, Ridnour could be on the move once again.\n\nRidnour averaged 4.0 points and 2.0 assists over 47 games for Orlando last season and has career averages of 9.3 points and 4.5 assists a game for Seattle, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Charlotte and Orlando.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets, who struggled to only 33 wins in 82 games last season, made two trades Thursday on the eve of the NBA Draft.\n\nAnd that followed Charlotte obtaining French forward Nicolas Batum on Wednesday from Portland in exchange for guard Gerald Henderson and forward Noah Vonleh.\n\nCharlotte is trying to boost a franchise known until last season as the Bobcats that has managed only two winning seasons in 11 campaigns, both of those runs ending with being swept out of the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Hornets ended up with Lamb, who averaged 6.3 points and 2.3 rebounds in 47 games last season for the Thunder. In 3 NBA seasons, Lamb has averaged 7.0 points and 2.1 rebounds a game.\n\n“Jeremy Lamb is a quality young wing player who we believe has the talent to help our team,” Hornets general manager Rick Cho said. “We look forward to adding him to our rotation next season.”\n\nBarnes, a 35-year-old journeyman, has averaged 8.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists over 779 games over 12 seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, New York, Sacramento, Philadelphia, Golden State, Phoenix and Orlando.\n\nHe averaged 10.1 points and 4.0 rebounds over 76 games last season for the Clippers, who traded him to Charlotte last week."
