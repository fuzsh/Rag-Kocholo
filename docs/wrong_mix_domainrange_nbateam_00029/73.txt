The official press release reads rather simply. Luke Ridnour, he of four trades in one off-season, is no longer a Raptor. He was waived today in advance of a July 11th deadline to get his contract off the Raptors' books.

The cold-blooded announcement:

The Toronto Raptors announced Thursday they have waived guard Luke Ridnour. The club acquired Ridnour and cash considerations from the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 30 in exchange for the draft rights to forward Tomislav Zubcic.

Ridnour, 6-foot-2, 175 pounds, has averaged 9.3 points, 4.5 assists, 1.0 steals and 26.1 minutes in 830 career games (493 starts). He has played with Seattle (2003-08), Milwaukee (2008-10, 2013-14), Minnesota (2010-13), Charlotte (2013-14) and Orlando (2014-15).

But really, how do you sum up a man? Is he just a row of stats and some dates? An age and some physical characteristics? An accumulation of history?

We never got to see Ridnour in a Raptors uniform. He moves now into a life of uncertainty. Where will he end up? Will he retire at 33? And most importantly (for our purposes), should we grieve this loss?

Or do we celebrate the removal of $2.75 million for the Raptors salary cap sheet?

Wait, don't answer that.
