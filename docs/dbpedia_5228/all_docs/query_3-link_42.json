        "meta_description": "Despite improvements in food production, many rural households in Bangladesh are still food insecure, and this requires urgent policy intervention if the situation is to improve. This article examines the factors influencing food security of vulnerable rural riverine households in Bangladesh. The results reveal that riverine households’ lack of access to many basic necessities and services, such as food, safe drinking water, education and health, results in increased vulnerability to food insecurity which could lead to an unfortunate vicious cycle of poverty. Model results indicate that household heads’ education, household size, adoption of livestock and access to non-farm earnings also affect food security. More importantly, evidence suggests that access to improved health care also needs policy support in parallel with improved access to food to achieve and sustain long-term food security in Bangladesh.
