        "text": "Human history is all about coping or crumbling with the changing climate. Bangladesh is one of those countries, which is tagged as one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Climate-driven hazards are exhibited frequently in the haor (wetland) -regions of the country. Shonir Haor is the largest freshwater reservoir and one of the major wetlands of Bangladesh, located at Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj district. This study provides an understanding of climate change and gender roles in the northeastern part of Bangladesh, where soil erosion is one of the most common natural hazards. It states the gender role and adaptation strategy with the danger of soil erosion. In erosion-prone areas people, especially, women are worried about the loss of their homesteads and other sufferings and misery. Since men tend to leave the area in search of employment, all the responsibility of the household falls on the shoulders of women. Moreover, women are affected more severely than males, but they tolerate their vulnerable situation furtively and hardly show any objection and try to play an effective role in their household and family. Data and information that have been used in the paper are collected by a research team that brings together a range of methodological approaches, including Life Histories, Case Studies, In-depth Interviews, and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) in order to obtain deeper insights into the study area."
