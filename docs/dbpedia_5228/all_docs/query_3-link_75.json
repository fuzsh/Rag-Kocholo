        "text": "Allegations against Awami League lawmaker Pankaj Nath are being raised again after his removal from party posts for \"breaching discipline\".\n\nLocals alleged that Pankaj became involved in many controversial activities after being elected lawmaker in 2014 from Barishal-4 (Hijla-Mehendiganj).\n\nTwo factions developed in Mehendiganj upazila AL due to the MP's controversial activities, said party activists.\n\nThe ruling party on Sunday conveyed the decision of his removal to the lawmaker through a letter issued by AL Office Secretary Biplab Barua. The MP was an advisory council member of the party's Barishal district unit.\n\nAL sources said Pankaj backed several independent union parishad chairman candidates in his constituency and many of them won the UP elections beating AL nominees.\n\nIn an audio clip leaked in July, the twice MP was heard talking to then officer-in-charge (investigation) of Mehendiganj Police Station Tauhiduzzaman. During the conversation, the lawmaker threatened that he would hack Mehendiganj municipality Mayor Kamal Khan. The clip went viral on social media, drawing huge criticism.\n\nA few days after the incident, the OC was transferred. Local AL also staged demonstrations against the MP.\n\nIntra-party feuds led to killings of four people and injuries to around 100 over union parishad elections in Pankaj's constituency in the last one year.\n\nThe elections to South and North Ulania union parishads were suspended twice due to clashes between supporters of two AL factions.\n\nThe law and order in Mehendiganj has deteriorated sharply recently.\n\nOn August 28, five leaders and activists of Jubo League and Chhatra League were injured when they came under an attack allegedly by Pankaj's supporters at the upazila health complex. The injured were later moved to Barishal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College Hospital.\n\nPolice arrested four supporters of the lawmaker in connection with the incident.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Barishal city recently, Sanjay Chandra, deputy publicity secretary of Kazirhat thana AL, alleged that supporters of Pankaj tortured him three years ago, leaving his legs and a hand broken. He said he landed in jail on April 20 this year after being implicated in a mugging case.\n\nHe claimed that Pankaj was behind the attack as he filed a corruption case against the lawmaker and his family members on March 5, 2017.\n\nLocal AL leaders also alleged that Pankaj collected crores of taka from businesses at fish landing stationsand sand trading sitesin Mehendiganj, run by his supporters.\n\nMehendiganj municipality Mayor Kamal Khan, also the general secretary of upazila unit AL, said \"Many Awami League men are happy to see Pankaj Nath's removal from party posts. We trust the decision of our leader [party President Sheikh Hasina]. We had informed our party high ups about the MP's activities time to time.\"\n\nBarishal district AL General Secretary Talukdar Md Younus said, \"The party took action against the MP as law and order situation in the district was deteriorating because of him.\"\n\nThough a section of Mehendiganj AL leaders is happy about the lawmaker's removal from party posts, another section keeps mum.\n\nAsked about his removal, Pankaj said \"I have received the party letter. I don't want to make any comment on this.\"\n\nHe denied the allegation of his supporters' involvement in attacks.\n\nThe lawmaker said all allegations against him were politically motivated and those were brought to weaken him politically."
