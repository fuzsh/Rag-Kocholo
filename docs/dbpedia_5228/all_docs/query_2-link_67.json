        "text": "This paper aims at identify the number of climate induced migrants in kazipur upazila with specific reference to riverbank erosion. The study has used Kazipur upazila of Sirajganj for riverbank erosion, which is already identified as the most erosion prone area in Bangladesh. People affected by river bank erosion and immediately migrate for safe shelter and later permanently for survival, are examples of practical risk. While people migrate based on the perception that in future there would be worse condition that could hamper lives and livelihood; the adverse effect of rise of riverbank erosion compels the population to migrate from one place to another. In the Kazipur upazila of Sirajganj district, 21,961 people were migrated which is 9.35 percent of the total population in recent years [1]. The precise cause of riverbank erosion in Bangladesh there are 1,29,853 people are displaced yearly [2]. Permanent migration occurred within the neighbors and mainly it happened in a tiny distance because of the need of earning source and social bonding. In this paper we have considered observed risk such as river bank erosion as causal factors of migration and rural vulnerability, which has important socioeconomic impact on rural development.\n\nBangladesh is situated in riverine and deltaic region in South Asia where riverbank erosion is a catastrophic climate induced disaster in Bangladesh. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the impact of riverbank erosion on lives and livelihoods of the displaced people in the SouthEastern Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative data have been used through in-depth interviews, focus group discussion and questionnaire survey. The study reveals that riverbank erosion is addressing displacement, hidden hunger and poverty, loss of land and identity of coastal people. Besides, displaced persons face social, economic, cultural stigma in their community. People have used different types of indigenous knowledge to reduce the sufferings of the affected people. The findings of this study are vital for policymakers to articulate and implement effective approaches and programs to reduce vulnerability and to increase the local adaptation processes in order to improve such households' livelihood all over Bangladesh.\n\nThis dissertation examines the vulnerability of internal migrants from north-west rural Bangladesh who have had substantial experience with slow-onset forms of natural hazard. To date, the majority of the research on the vulnerability of human systems has tended to focus on the bio-physical impacts of hazards. Although the scholarly works have also contributed to the assessment of the impacts of climate change on human migration, they have provided only a limited understanding of how such groups are affected by various aspects of vulnerability. In the climate-migration research nexus, more recent studies have recognized the need to investigate how climate and environmental vulnerability could result in incremental or non-linear migration outcomes, depending on various contexts of natural hazards. In order to examine such complexities, the concept of drivers of vulnerability offers a valuable analytical alternative to indicator based methods. This approach can explain how multiple dr...\n\nAs the effects of climate change and hazards are starting to be felt worldwide, there are certain frontline countries that are most at risk and Bangladesh is genuinely at risk in terms of its economic viability and food security unless its citizens develop adaptation strategies to compensate for these effects. This study analyses how the impacts of climate change and hazards (specifically riverbank erosion) are already jeopardising the livelihood and food security of rural riparian (riverbank and char) households in Bangladesh, compromising their access to arable land, and thereby holding back their potential for both sustenance and economic development. The researcher has conducted extensive research in two severe riverbank erosion-prone districts in Bangladesh to assess the severity of these problems and to seek the strategies the affected people deploy to offset the effects. This study takes a holistic approach to two key vulnerability assessment methods â€“ the Livelihood Vulnerab...\n\nBangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. In particular, its riverine-island (char) dwellers face continuous riverbank erosion, frequent flooding, and other adverse effects of climate change that increase their vulnerability. This paper aims to assess the livelihood vulnerability of riverine communities by applying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework and the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI). Results indicate substantial variation in the vulnerability of char dwellers based on mainland proximity. The main drivers of livelihood vulnerability are char-dweller adaptation strategies and access to food and health services. The study further reveals that riverbank erosion, frequent flood inundation, and lack of employment and access to basic public services are the major social and natural drivers of livelihood vulnerability. Char-based policy focusing on short-and long-term strategy is required to reduce livelihood vulnerability and enhance char-dweller resilience."
