        "text": "Online Knowledge Society as part of youth empowerment through civic engagement and skills development programme, calls the internet-savvy youth to take part in the online campaign to mark International Women’s Day and asks them to prepare a handwritten placard on a white paper by identifying major issues related to women, girls and adolescents and children. And they are also asked to show the placard to the audiences and set it to a photo frame prepared by the Online Knowledge Society and post it to social media on the 8th of March 2023. About 50 youths from 6 regions of Bangladesh responded and participated in the Social Media Campaign to mark International Women’s Day 2023.\n\n“Inspired by an ancient tale of a hummingbird trying to put out a forest fire, the United Nations has kicked off a World Water Day 2023 campaign that calls on everyone to do what they can to solve the global water and sanitation crisis.”\n\nAfter the International Women’s Day campaign, the Online Knowledge Society launched a hummingbird campaign to mark World Water Day 2023. As a hummingbird effort, again the Internet Savvies are asked to take a water-related photograph from their localities and set the photograph to the photo frame prepared by Online Knowledge Society and post it to social media on 22 March 2023 to celebrate World Water Day 2023. Hundreds of youth hummingbirds responded and participated in this campaign.\n\n`Accelerating Change’, the main theme of World Water Day 2023, and learning from social media campaigns, Online Knowledge Society generate the idea `Campaign to Social Action’ for accelerating change in 2023 and again the campaign participants are asked to identify 4 action areas for accelerating change related to their social media campaign in International Women Day and World Water Day. Based on their identified action areas, a social action plan (SAP) is developed for each individual volunteer.\n\n“A social action project is a multi-step process in which youth address an issue they care about, learn about it and potential solutions to solve it, then take action to create positive change on this issue.”\n\nThe youth internet savvies will executive their own social action plan in their own communities and they will be skilled human resources for the future through participating in these multi-step processes and become a real change maker in society.\n\nSvante Arrhenius Biography | (Scientist) | Birthday: February 19, 1859 (Pisces) | Born In: Vik | Died At Age: 68 | Family: Spouse/Ex-: Maria Johansson, Sofia Rudbeck Died On: October 2, 1927, | Place of Death: Stockholm\n\nSwedish scientist Svante August Arrhenius remains one of the most influential scientists in history and although it is true that he started off as a physicist; he ended up being more influential as a researcher par excellence in chemistry. He showed a remarkable gift for arithmetic at an early age and for all intents and purposes, he was a child prodigy who excelled in the sciences. His major projects were related to chemistry and Arrhenius was also one of the leading purveyors of what is now known as physical chemistry. Arrhenius was Sweden’s leading scientist throughout his life and his papers on the greenhouse effect is regarded as a benchmark study on climate change in the 21st century. He is known as the ‘father of climate change studies and all the research that has been conducted on it is based on the findings of Svante Arrhenius. Besides his study on the greenhouse effect; he is also famous for his work on the theory of electrolytic dissociation. Arrhenius is often referred to as a physical chemist in light of the sort of studies he conducted. Read on to know more about his life and contribution to physical chemistry.\n\nMore about Climate Change\n\nRead more\n\nOut of a total 20 sponsors of Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Summit, 18 were either directly supporting or partnering with the fossil fuel industry. Calling Sharm el-Sheikh climate conference is a ‘greenwashing’ forum, Greta Thunberg abstained from COP27. Human rights groups were also repeatedly condemned Egypt’s record under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and noted the state’s unlawful surveillance and intimidation tactics at the event in last November. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is condemned and also accepted delegates by participating COP27 under the presidency of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nAnother `Greenwashing’ news came today early of the morning at news media that Sultan al-Jaber, CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, will preside over the next round of global climate talks (COP28) in Dubai. Al-Jaber’s firm pumps some 4 million barrels of crude a day and hopes to expand to 5 million daily, generating more of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide the UN annual climate negotiations aim to limit.\n\nRead more\n\nI travelled Char Mantaj, the last southern island of Rangabali Upazila of Patuakhali district on 27 September 2022 to conduct climate and disaster vulnerability and readiness assessment with CPE team. The story has been developed from the observation of the study sideline.\n\nI see that women with their children are living in boats, somebody cooks food on there at Char Mantaj, the last southern island of Bangladesh. They are `Manta’ folks who spend their whole lives in boats. I knew little about them. I read some articles about them. After returning to Dhaka from Char Montaj, I searched for the articles on the `Manta’ community. Approximately 500 plus families are in `Manta’ community in Patuakhali district, these articles say. `Manta families’ float around the rivers of Char Mantaj. They are also found in the southern rivers, char and estuaries, particularly in Panpotty, Golachipa, Kalaiya, Boga, Bodnatali, Ulania, Patuakhali Sadar region. We also found such a family near the Goinkhali Launch Ghat of Rangabali during our journey from Char Momodarbunia Sluice Gate to Char Mantaj by launch.\n\nRead more\n\nG20 climate talks in Bali, Indonesia have been unable to agree a joint communique, amid objections over language used on climate targets and the war in Ukraine, the media report said. Although Indonesia’s Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar had started the meeting by urging countries to cut emissions and prevent the planet from being pushed to a point “where no future will be sustainable”, but some countries, including China, had objected to previously agreed language in the Glasgow climate pact and past G20 agreements on efforts to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius, said an official with knowledge of the meeting, declining to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, reports Reuters.\n\nThe report of NASA on Bangladesh, which is one of the most vulnerable country to climate change, came into view while reading the disappointing news of G20 talks. It seems, we are running towards a mirage. The world is demanding solution, but the leaders are busy in debate and commitment, then everything goes in about empty. Although the G20 emits 75 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, they are not participating in the reduction process properly. Financing discussions are not getting much importance, and finance is not being given as per their commitment. The whole discussion is turning into a stalemate.\n\nRead more\n\nAshar and Srabon – these two months are the rainy season in the Bangla calendar. During this time, there will be rains, people will suffer, and water will overflow in canal-beel-pond-rivers. Farmers will have a busy time planting seeds in mud covered crop fields. And nature will be fresher. This is the character of monsoon. But for the last few years that character is no longer seen. Now heat wave has taken place during the monsoon. Sometimes it rains a little, but the nature burns with the intensity of summer. Even during full monsoons, the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius. And it is predicted to increase further by the Meteorological Department.\n\nThe amount of rainfall is less in the entire monsoon season. According to the sources of the Meteorological Department, in the month of July, Dhaka Division received 116 mm of rain, Chittogram Division 232 mm, Mymensingh 204 mm, Rajshahi 138 mm, Rangpur 299 mm, Khulna 120 mm, Barisal 220 mm and Sylhet maximum 531 mm. Meteorologists say that global warming is affecting the climate. So we see negative behavior in nature.\n\nRead more\n\nNot sufficient, but government allocates some budgetary amounts related to climate change to 25 ministries and to the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ministries; unfortunately the ministries are not are not able to utilize these allocated amount.
