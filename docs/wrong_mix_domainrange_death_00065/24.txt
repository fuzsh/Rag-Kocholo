NORTHAMPTON -- It was splashed in large, bold letters on the front page of the Springfield Evening Union: Calvin Coolidge is dead.

On Jan. 5, 1933, the 30th president of the United States died of a heart attack in Northampton at the age of 60.

Coolidge worked as a lawyer in Northampton and served as the city's mayor from 1910 to 1911. He went on to be a Massachusetts state senator, lieutenant governor, and governor before becoming vice president and president from Aug. 1923 to March 1929.

The Vermont native attended Amherst College from 1891 to 1895. A few years later, Coolidge met his wife, Grace Anna Goodhue, who was a teacher at the Clarke School for the Deaf. They attended the same congregational church and reportedly met at a picnicking and boating function.

After retiring from the U.S. presidency in 1929, Coolidge moved back to Northampton.
