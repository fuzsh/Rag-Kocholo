        "text": "Will Rogers on...\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nThe Republican platform promises to do better. I don't think they have done so bad. Everybody's broke but them.\n\nDemocrats take the whole thing as a joke. Republicans take it seriously and run it like a joke.\n\nThe platform will always be the same. Promise everything, deliver nothing.\n\nRepublicans want a man that can lend dignity to the office. Democrats want a man to lend some money.\n\nWe landed at Cairo but I didn't go to see that thing - what did they call it - the Sphinx. I figured anyhow I just seen Calvin coolidge not long ago.\n\nThe truth can hurt you worse in an election than about anything that could happen to you.\n\nA politician is like a pickpocket. It's almost impossible to get one to reform.\n\nWhy sleep at home when you can sleep in Congress?\n\nOne seldom ever remembers meeting a Vice President.\n\nBe a Republican and sooner or later you will be a postmaster.\n\nEvery guy looks in his pocket and then votes.\n\nOnce a man holds public office, he is absolutely no good for honest work.\n\nAs bad as we sometimes think our government is run, it is the best run I ever saw.\n\nI'm not a member of any organized political party. I'm a Democrat.\n\nWar &amp Peace\n\nI have a scheme for stopping war. It's this - no nation is allowed to enter war until they've paid for the last one.\n\nI don't care how little your country is, you got a right to run it like you want to.\n\nNations are just like individuals. Loan them money and you lose their friendship.\n\nWoe be to a weak nation if they live by a strong one.\n\nWars will never be a success until you have a referee and until they announce before they start just what it's for.\n\nDiplomats are just as essential to starting war as soldiers are for finishing it.\n\nProhibition\n\nYou know statistics have proven that listening to prohibition lecturers has driven more people to drink than any other cause.\n\nThey say Washington was never dry. Course you got to lay most of that to the Senate and Congress being in session.\n\nThe American people will vote dry as long as they are able to stagger to the polls.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe good old days with most of us was when we didn't earn enough to pay income tax.\n\nThey got such a high inheritance tax on 'em that you won't catch these old rich boys drying promiscuously like they did. This bill makes patriots out of everybody. You sure do die for your country if you die from now on.\n\nWhen a party can't think of anything else they always fall back on lower taxes. It has a magic sounds to a voter just like fairyland is spoken of and dreamed by children.\n\nThere is a tremendous movement on to get lower taxes on earned income. Then will come the real problem. Who among us on salary are earning our income?\n\nThe income tax has made more liars out of the American people than golf has.\n\nIt's a country, but you can't life in it for nothing.\n\nGolf\n\nGolf is the only game in the world which takes longer to explain than it does to play.\n\nThere is nothing effeminate about this golf thing played by these champion women.\n\nI can remember when a man could be considered respectable without belonging to a golf club.\n\nIf golf was played as much as talked it would supplant poker as our national game.\n\nEducation\n\nEverybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.\n\nEducation never helped morals. The most savage people are the most moral. The smarter the guy the bigger the rascal.\n\nThe higher the education the higher priced drinks they become accustomed to. Prohibition will never catch up with education.\n\nThe Lord split knowledge up among us about equal. The so-called ignorant is happy. You think he is happy because he don't know any better. Maybe he is happy because he knows how to be happy. The smart one knows a lot. That makes him unhappy because he can't impart it to his friends. Discontent comes in proportion to knowledge.\n\nWhen ignorance gets started, it knows no bounds.\n\nLawyers\n\nOnly one way you can beat a lawyer in a death case. That is to die with nothing.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you can make a lawyer honest by an act of legislature. You've got to work his conscience. And his lack of conscience is what makes him a lawyer.\n\nIt if wasn't for wills, lawyers would have to go to work at an essential employment.\n\nDoctors\n\nAll doctors should make enough out of those who are well able to pay to be able to do all the work for the poor for free. One thing a poor person should every be expected to pay for is medical attention and not from an organized charity but from our best doctors. Your doctor bill should be paid like your income tax, according to what you have.\n\nBest doctor in the world is a veterinarian. He can't ask his patients what's the matter. He's just got to know.\n\nWhen a doctor has pulled you through why you always got a warm place in your heart for him.\n\nThere is nothing that keeps poor people poor as much as paying doctor bills.\n\nWhat others said\n\n\"I was shocked to hear of the tragedy which was taken Will Rogers and Wiley Post from us. Will was an old friend of mine, a humorist and philosopher beloved by all.\"\n\nâPresident Franklin D. Rossevelt\n\n\"Will rogers and Wiley Post were among Oklahoma's most beloved sons. No other man has so well understood and expressed the feelings of just plain folks that Rogers loved so well.\"\n\nâU.S. Rep. Wilburn Cartwright of Oklahoma\n\n\"Both Rogers and Post have been pioneers with new equipment over uncharted skyways... Will Rogers was not a passenger but an adventurer with Wiley.\"\n\nâCapt. Eddie Rickenbacker, American flying ace\n\n\"Every good American will feel a personal loss in the suddent passing of these two beloved characters.\"\n\nâNew York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.\n\n\"Mr. Rogers was a great man, but so human that everyone who worked with him loved him.\"\n\nâMotion Picture Director George Marshall\n\n\"He was one of the grandest people I ever knew.\"\n\nâActress Rochelle Hudson, who appeared in several films with Rogers\n\n\"He knew practically everyone in the flying business by his first name, and was a favorite of the personnel of the three transcontinental airlines\"\n\nâL.W. Goss, Pacific Coast operations superintendent of Transcontinental & Western Air\n\n\"Will Rogers was a great actor as well as a great humorist and a great philosopher.\"\n\nâFrank Gilmore, president of Actors Equity\n\n\"He (Rogers) was a good friend of Ireland. We are poorer for this tragic death.\"\n\nâLord Mayor Alfred Byrne of Dublin\n\n\"Will Rogers was the greatest humorist that ever lived. I knew him as a boy and his father as well. After Will got famous he sent his father a check for $500. His father told me about it and then asked: 'Bill, you reckon Will earned all this money?\"\n\nâFormer Oklahoma Gov. William \"Alfalfa Bill\" Murray\n\n\"Rogers' death is a great shock to every hobo. The organization's 8,000 members will observe a 30-day period of mourning.\"\n\nâJeff Davis, \"King of the hobos of America\"\n\n\"A mixed-blood Cherokee cowboy, actor, comedia, radio personality, speak and humorist takin into the hearts of the American people as no other private citizen before or since.\"\n\nâJim Rogers, his son\n\n\"America's most accomplished human document. One-third humor. One-third humanitarian. One-third heart.\"\n\nâDamon Runyon, author\n\n\"One of the best-known and one of the least-known men in the world. By inclination, a great mixer. By instinct, a hermit.\"\n\nâSpencer Tracy, actor\n\n\"Will Rogers has done more to educate the American public in world affairs than all the professors\"\n\nâNew York Times\n\n\"Will Rogers became the biggest, most popular, and highest-paid star of every existing media of his time. The biggest star America ever produced. What is even more remarkable, the things he said and wrote remain as relevant and meaningful today as they did 60 and 70 years ago.\"\n\nâTommy Tune, director, \"The Will Rogers Follies\""
