        "text": "\"Philip Abbott has written an important book on a neglected topic. Scholars of the American presidency will want to read this work, but so, too, will informed citizens. Everyone interested in the behind-the-scene realities of how our accidental presidents came to power will profit from reading this book.\" - Martin J. Medhurst, Distinguished Professor of Rhetoric and Communication, Baylor University\n\n\"Philip Abbott is one of the most insightful scholars of the presidency working today. In Accidental Presidents, Abbott explores the peculiar difficulties that accidental presidents, those who come to office by the death or resignation of their elected predecessor, have in establishing their legitimacy and authority. Abbott shows that while some accidental presidents succeed better than others, their political path is invariably steep and rocky.\" - Cal Jillson, Professor of Political Science, Southern Methodist University\n\n\"This thoughtful treatise details the circumstances that led each [accidental president] to choose an approach and examines the strategy s success or failure. Summing Up: Recommended. Most levels/libraries.\" - Choice"
