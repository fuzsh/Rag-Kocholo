        "text": "Since Kansas State College for Agriculture and Applied Science was founded in 1863, there have been 15 presidents and first ladies.\n\nThe idea for a gallery was proposed by former K-State President Jon Wefald to acknowledge the important role and impact these women have had at K-State. The gallery highlights the lives of the first ladies. Although they had unique qualities and backgrounds, each first lady possess many of the same admirable characteristics: they represented the university with dignity and were leaders in many campus and community organizations.\n\nBiographical information on the First Ladies was provided by Dr. Michaeline Chance-Reay, author of Land Grant Ladies: Kansas State University Presidential Wives, and K-State Libraries staff."
