        "text": "Arrangement\n\nNo arrangement action taken or arrangement information not recorded at the time of processing.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nSeries 1: Diaries, 1939-1945, covers MacVeagh's tour of duties as Minister to Greece (with the omission of his tours in Iceland and The Union of South Africa), his term as Ambassador to the Greek and Yugoslav Governments-in-exile in Cairo and his return to Greece after liberation. These are photocopies of transcriptions as the original diaries remain the property of the MacVeagh family.\n\nThe diaries contain Lincoln MacVeagh's reflections on Greece under the Metaxas dictatorship of the late 1930s and during World War II, though there are two major gaps (June 7, 1941-November 22, 1943 and December 8, 1944-April 12, 1945). Within the early entries, MacVeagh discusses the turbulence of Polish refugees passing through Greece en route to France to join the Polish legations and rumors of Hitler's \"deadly weapons.\" Turkish-Anglo-French mutual assistance pacts, as well as non-aggression pacts between Italy and France are recorded. Greek military actions, such as the May 1940 militarization of the Albanian frontier and Italy's attack on Greece in October 1940 are detailed, as well as the diplomatic maneuvers prior to and after those and other events. American efforts to provide humanitarian assistance through the Greek Red Cross are also discussed. The diary further records a conference between Anthony Eden and members of the Greek government on February 24, 1941, an interview between MacVeagh and Eden regarding British aid to Greece in the form of military planes and tanks, and MacVeagh's interviews with President Roosevelt in December 1943 (Cairo) and August 1944 (Washington, D.C.).\n\nOther topics detailed by MacVeagh's diaries while in Greece include:\n\nInternal political eruptions and the formation of a new Greek Cabinet (which resulted when Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact with Greece);\n\nAmbassador John Van Antwerp MacMurray's telegram from Turkey delineating his ideas for Turkish neutrality;\n\nVanderbilt Committee's assistance to Jewish soldiers stranded in Greece;\n\nGerman bombings and the evacuation of British troops by sea, including Prince Peter's journey to Crete;\n\nGerman capture of Athens and Greek resistance to occupation, including a radio broadcast from Allen Dulles on May 15, 1941 calling for \"active participation in the war;\"\n\nAmerican efforts to aid the Greek wounded from Crete;\n\nEvacuation of the American diplomatic corps from Greece to Vienna in June 1941.\n\nThese diaries contain no entries from June 7, 1941 until November 23, 1943, during MacVeagh's service in Iceland and South Africa. Entries resume when MacVeagh and his family arrived in Cairo, the seat of the governments-in-exile of Yugoslavia and Greece.\n\nLater entries contain numerous important political discussions with various diplomatic representatives regarding post-war plans for the Balkans, \"the rise of the communist specter in the resistance movements\" and the politics of exile, liberation and civil war.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n3 boxes\n\n1939 October 18 - 1941 January 31, 1939 October 18 - 1941 January 31. 1 box.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box\n\n1941 February 2 - 1941 June 6, 1941 February 2 - 1941 June 6. 1 box.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box\n\n1943 November 23 - 1944 July 31, 1943 November 23 - 1944 July 31. 1 box.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box\n\n1944 August 1 - 1945 April 30, 1944 August 1 - 1945 April 30. 1 box.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box\n\nArrangement\n\nNo arrangement action taken or arrangement information not recorded at the time of processing.\n\nScope and Contents\n\nSeries 3: Dispatches and Telegrams, 1933-1940. From 1933 until the end of 1940 when the war disrupted regular courier service between Athens and Washington, MacVeagh wrote dispatches covering many subjects involving Greek history, national character, political events, and relations with other countries, particularly Italy. This series contains dispatches and telegrams to and from the State Department arranged chronologically.\n\nSpecifically, dispatches detail the Insull Case, electoral law reform, and the power struggle between the Foreign Minister Dimitrios Maximos and Sophocles Venizelos, particularly the 1935 restoration of the Greek monarchy and the return of King George II. MacVeagh discusses Premier/Dictator John Metaxas curtailment of free speech and censorship, the organization of youth groups, the rise of anti-semitism, and the fortification of the Bulgarian and Yugoslavian borders, and the revolt against Metaxas' regime in Crete.\n\nA report on \"Greece in 1938\" which summarizes the political problems in Greece, dated February 1939, and a similar summary for 1939, dated April 1940, are found in this series. Topics of interest include the 1939 Italian invasion of Albania, renewed fears of a Bulgarian invasion, British guarantees of Greek independence and territorial integrity, and Great Britain's $10,000,000 loan to Greece.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box\n\n1933 June 2 - 1940 April 8, 1933 June 2 - 1940 April 8. 1 box.\n\nPhysical Description\n\n1 box"
