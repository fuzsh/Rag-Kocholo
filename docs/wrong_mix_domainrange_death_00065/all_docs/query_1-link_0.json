        "text": "America's 30th president has been largely ignored by historians.\n\nCalvin Coolidge was sworn into office in August 1923, after the death of President Warren Harding. Elected in his own right the following year, Coolidge left office in 1929.\n\nNow, his legacy is being revisited in a new book that suggests Coolidge's world view can be applied to modern politics and life.\n\n'Silent Cal'\n\nCalvin Coolidge is not a well-known president.\n\nWhat most Americans know of him is limited to his nickname - Silent Cal. He was reserved, introspective and often seemed uncomfortable at social events. But this man of few words got a lot accomplished as president.\n\nHe reduced taxes, lowered federal spending, signed a bill granting full citizenship to native Americans and limited immigration. He also made himself available to lawmakers and reporters - a novelty in the early 20th century, says Jim Douglas, government of Vermont.\n\n\"Coolidge had breakfast meetings with the members of Congress,\" he says. \"He had a press conference on average every four days.\"\n\nCore values\n\nDouglas is one of the 21 politicians, journalists, activists and thinkers who contributed their thoughts to \"Why Coolidge Matters,\" a collection of essays about the 30th president.\n\nIn his essay, the governor highlights how Coolidge reflected the character and values of Vermont, where he was born and raised. Calvin Coolidge inspires him.\n\n\"There are really two ways: one is his commitment to fiscal integrity, to reducing debt, to balancing the budget, to lowering taxes, something we did in Vermont in our legislative session this year,\" says Douglas. \"Secondly, I take from the Coolidge legacy the values of civility, integrity, honesty, straightforwardness, of communicating in a transparent way with the people he served and on a frequent basis.\""
