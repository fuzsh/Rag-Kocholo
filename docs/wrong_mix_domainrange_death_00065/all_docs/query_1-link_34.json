        "text": "The president of the United States of America is the head of state and head of government of the United States. The role of the Executive Branch, of which the president is the head, is to enforce the national laws as stated in the Constitution or made by Congress. The office of president was established upon the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788 and the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.\n\nThe president serves as the chief executive and leader of the executive branch of the federal government. Article Two of the Constitution establishes the president as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and enumerates powers specifically granted to the president, including the power to sign into law bills passed by both houses of Congress, to create a Cabinet of advisers, to grant pardons or reprieves, and, with the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate, to make treaties and appoint federal officers, ambassadors, and federal judges (including Justices of the Supreme Court). Article Two also defines a presidential term at four years.\n\nIn OTL, since 1951, presidents have been limited to two terms by the Twenty-second Amendment. There have been 46 presidencies, but only 45 individuals have held the office; Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThis article lists the known presidents found in a fictional work after the Point of Divergence in alternate history, or sitting presidents found in works of science fiction. Presidents who served before the POD of a given alternate history that are mentioned in passing do not need to be listed here - even if they are still alive during the story but do nothing during it. Stories set in the history of OTL may reference past presidents, the sitting president, or future presidents: unless the work is one of speculative fiction, those presidents do not belong here.\n\nRepublican Democratic Socialist\n\n\"The Breaking of Nations\"\n\nDonald Trump attained the presidency with the aid of Vladimir Putin of Russia.[1] At Putin's direction, Trump laid the foundation for increased right-wing authoritarianism in the United States, which in turn lead to the eventual dismemberment of the country.[2]. Trump didn't live to see the break-down; he died in the second COVID-19 outbreak in 2024,[3] and his successor, Mike Pence, who also owed his office to Putin, attempted to thwart the creation of the new country of Pacifica from the states of the west coast. It wasn't until Putin formally recognized Pacifica that Pence backed down.[4]\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 45 Donald Trump 2017-2024 Republican Mike Pence\n\n(Ascended to the Presidency) 46 Mike Pence 2024-2033, 2033-20??* Republican Lindsey Graham\n\n\"The Breaking of Nations\" ends in 2031. In \"The Purloined Republic\", James Morrow's contribution to And the Last Trump Shall Sound, we learn that Pence worked around the Twenty-second Amendment by running as vice president on the bottom of the ticket with Devin Nunes in 2032. Shortly after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States, Nunes resigned, and Pence became the 48th president. As Turtledove did not participate in writing Morrow's work, this wiki will not incorporate further information from that story.\n\n\"Election Day\"\n\nIn 2016, the Democrats were able to keep the presidency when Senator John F. Kennedy Jr. defeated Republican Donald Trump in a close race.[5]\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 43 George W.

He died in March 1953, about six weeks into his sixth term, and was succeeded by Vice President John Nance Garner. However, through the machinations of former Steele loyalists, Garner was impeached, convicted, and removed from office. As a series of circumstances had removed all legal successors to the presidency, J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the Government Bureau of Investigation, seized emergency executive powers, and moved into the Oval Office. He maintained the title of \"Director\", rather than adopting the office of President.\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 31 Herbert Hoover 1929-1933 Republican Charles Curtis\n\n(presumed) 32 Joseph V.

Edgar Hoover 1953-\n\nincumbent at novel's end N/a\n\nThe original \"Joe Steele\" story has a different ending. After Steele's death, a three-way conflict among President Garner, the Hammer, and J. Edgar Hoover claims the lives of both the Hammer and Garner, and Hoover takes over. It is not revealed what title he uses. This is in contrast to the novel's \"legalistic\" process of bloodlessly removing Garner from office and Hoover establishing himself as the \"Director\", but the end result is essentially the same.\n\n\"Must and Shall\"\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln was killed by a Confederate sharpshooter at Fort Stevens in 1864, during the Great Rebellion. Vice President Hannibal Hamlin ascended to the presidency, and began a policy of retribution against the rebelling Southern states. Hamlin's successors continued this policy.\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 16 Abraham Lincoln 1861-1864 Republican Hannibal Hamlin\n\n(Ascended to the presidency) 17 Hannibal Hamlin 1864-1869(?)

Successors unnamed 1869-1942 Unknown Unknown\n\nSouthern Victory\n\nFor most of the history of the United States between the end of the War of Secession and the end of the Great War, the presidency was held by a member of the Democratic Party. This came in response to Abraham Lincoln's status as a Republican. Aside from Republican James G. Blaine, who served from 1881 to 1885, every president from 1865 to 1921 was a Democrat.\n\nAfter U.S. victory in the Great War, Upton Sinclair became the first Socialist Party president. The Socialists had their most successful period over the next generation, winning five of the six elections between 1920 and 1940, though usually by very narrow margins. Neither party dominated the political cycle the way the Democrats had in the 19th century, as each party was able to capitalize on the failures of the other.\n\nFollowing the Second Great War, Democrats successfully laid the blame for the Confederate States' initial successes on the comparatively lighter foreign policy of the Socialists. They parlayed this blame into victory in the 1944 election, electing Thomas Dewey to Powel House and also taking control of the House of Representatives.\n\nIt had been the custom since George Washington that the a president was only elected to two consecutive terms. Theodore Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented third term in 1920, but was defeated, thus leaving the custom intact.\n\nCalvin Coolidge holds the distinction of being the only person elected to the office never to serve. After winning the 1932 election, Coolidge died of a heart attack the following January, just under a month before he could take the oath of office.\n\nAl Smith was killed by a Confederate bombing raid in 1942, the first and only time a president was killed during war time.\n\nOfficially the presidential residence was the White House in Washington, DC. During the Second Mexican War, Washington was evacuated by the Federal government due to its location within range of Confederate heavy artillery. The government relocated to Philadelphia where the president set up residence and office space in the Powel House. After the war, the Federal government remained in Philadelphia due to Washington's continued insecure position, and though Washington remained the capital of the US de jure, for all practical purposes, Philadelphia became the permanent capital and Powel House the permanent executive mansion. The White House was periodically used by the incubment president for certain formal functions, such as inauguration ceremonies and state funerals.\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 16 Abraham Lincoln 1861-1865 Republican Hannibal Hamlin 17-19(?)

La Follette 1942-1945 Socialist Office vacant 34 Thomas Dewey 1945-\n\nIncumbent at series' end Democrat Harry Truman\n\nIn The Center Cannot Hold, Hosea Blackford is specified as the 30th person to serve as president. Mathematically, this implies that two presidents did not complete their terms at some point between 1865 and 1913 for this to be possible.\n\nThe text does not identify all presidents between those years. Only Tilden, Blaine, Mahan, and Reed are named as such for the relevant time period (1865-1913). The exact terms of Mahan and Reed have not been revealed; circumstantial textual evidence supports Mahan serving from 1889-1897, and Reed serving from 1897-1902 (which would make him one of the two presidents to die in office).\n\n1=Presidents identified in the series canon, but their terms are not given.\n\n2=Calvin Coolidge was elected to be the 31st President, but died before taking office, so his entire term was served by his elected Vice President Hoover.\n\n\"Vilcabamba\"\n\nWith the arrival of the Krolp and their military domination of the planet, the United States was reduced to a rump state that ran among the Rocky Mountains and the Wasatch Range, combined with a small part of Canada. The offices of President of the United States and Prime Minister of Canada were combined in one person. The office also became hereditary.[6] The last duly elected president was Harris Moffatt I. His lineage continued to rule the rump U.S. until the presidency of his grandson Harris Moffatt III from the de facto capital of Grand Junction, Colorado. However, with the final defeat of the U.S., 50 years after the Krolp arrived, the presidency was abolished and Harris Moffatt III was forced into exile in the Krolp's North American capital of St. Louis.\n\nKnown Presidents:\n\nHarris Moffatt I\n\nHarris Moffatt II (killed by a renegade Krolp)\n\nHarris Moffatt III\n\nOffice abolished\n\nWorldwar\n\nIn the aftermath of the Race invasion of Earth, the American presidency saw two critical interruptions. The first came in 1944 with the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Vice President Henry Wallace had been killed in January of that year, when the Race's explosive-metal bomb destroyed Seattle while Wallace was visiting. Then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull succeeded Roosevelt per the Presidential Succession Act of 1886.\n\nThe second came in 1965 when President Earl Warren committed suicide after agreeing to allow the Race to destroy Indianapolis. The Race had learned that Warren had ordered the secret attack on the Race's Colonization Fleet in 1962, and the destruction of Indianapolis was the only way to avoid war and to insure the U.S. remained a global power.\n\nWith Washington, DC destroyed by the Race in 1942, the capital was moved to Little Rock, Arkansas after the Peace of Cairo of 1944. The executive residence was the Gray House.\n\n№\n\nPresident Term Party Vice President 32 Franklin D. Roosevelt 1933-1944 Democrat Henry Wallace\n\n-\n\n(Died in office) 33 Cordell Hull 1944-1945(?)

The following Presidents were in office during or after the PODs of various alternate history works, or in speculative stories set in the future of OTL.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams is referenced as the incumbent President in \"Hail! Hail!\"\n\n\"Lee at the Alamo\" is set from February to March 1861, during the transition from James Buchanan to Abraham Lincoln. Buchanan is referenced, and Lincoln directly appears.\n\n\"The House That George Built\" references Woodrow Wilson (in office at the POD) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (incumbent at story's end, February 1941).\n\nIn the State of Jefferson Stories, the 1919 POD does not seem to have affected the list of presidents as of 1981, when the most recent installment \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon\" takes place. Referenced post-POD Presidents include Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. Carter appears via television in \"Always Something New,\" with Reagan being the incumbent during the most recent story.\n\nIn addition to the above, Franklin D. Roosevelt is president in the \"Cayos in the Stream\", Days of Infamy series, \"News From the Front\", Or Even Eagle Flew, and The War That Came Early, all of which end during FDR's third term. \"News From the Front\" ends with Congress preparing to impeach Roosevelt in 1942; he would have been succeeded by Vice President Henry Wallace if convicted and removed from office. FDR is also president during the early scenes of The Man With the Iron Heart, and is referenced posthumously later in that novel.\n\nHarry Truman appears as president in The Man With the Iron Heart and The Hot War, being a POV in the latter.\n\nDwight Eisenhower is referenced as the incumbent president in \"Hindsight\".\n\nJohn F. Kennedy is the president and central POV character in \"A Massachusetts Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", where he goes on a fantasy adventure set in OTL. In The Valley-Westside War, whose POD is deliberately ambiguous, Kennedy appears to have been assassinated on the same schedule as OTL; his successor is unnamed, and the presidency ceased to exist as a result of the Russian-American War of 1967.\n\nKennedy is also president in the unfinished work Winter of Our Discontent, initially co-written with Bryce Zabel, wherein Kennedy survives the attempt on his life, and is subsequently re-elected in 1964, but faces impeachment in 1966. Zabel completed the novel on his own and it was published under the title Surrounded by Enemies: What if Kennedy Survived Dallas? in July 2013. As Turtledove withdrew from the project while it was in progress, the final book is not in the purview of this Wiki.\n\nLyndon Johnson is referenced as the incumbent president in \"The Fillmore Shoggoth\", set in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. His only interaction with the story's speculative elements is ordering a military presence in San Francisco to guard against shoggoths.\n\nIn addition to the above, Donald Trump appears in the guise of the \"Terrific Leader\" in the short work of the same name. He reigns over an authoritarian regime several years after his initial election. The story is set in the then-future of OTL.\n\nIn \"Elder Skelter\", the unnamed incumbent president and her cabinet debate whether or not Quebec's attack on the Maritimes would be sufficient to trigger the emergency clause of the Twenty-Eighth Amendment. Aside from her sex, nothing else is known about her.\n\nThe Supervolcano series takes place over a period of eight to ten years. References are made to a sitting president at various points in the series, but no president is ever named, nor described in any detail. The President at the start of the series is a Democrat.\n\nThe novel Alpha and Omega is set in the near-future. Although there are errant references to Donald Trump, it appears that the incumbent President is not meant to depict anyone in particular.\n\nHistorical Presidents in Non-Presidential Roles\n\nSeveral historical presidents have appeared in the alternate history works of Harry Turtledove but never assumed the office for any number of reasons. In some works, the story is set well before the historical figure took office, or the historical figure is killed before taking office. In other works, the office does not exist. Stories set in the past of OTL may reference a historical figure who later became President; unless the story is one of speculative fiction, such references do not belong here.\n\nGeorge Washington plays significant posthumous background roles in The Two Georges as Governor-General of the North American Union, and The Disunited States of America as a great general but not as a political leader.\n\nJohn Adams is posthumously referenced in The Two Georges as a figure from the North American Union's history.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams plays a posthumous role in The Disunited States of America as the leader of the independent state of Massachusetts.\n\nAndrew Jackson is referenced in The Two Georges as a Governor-General of the North American Union. In \"Hail! Hail!,\" he is likely to run for president in 1828, but the story does not depict the campaign.\n\nAbraham Lincoln is referenced in \"Hail! Hail!\" as a backwoods adolescent, but the story does not engage his political career.\n\nAndrew Johnson appears in \"Must and Shall\" as Military Governor of Tennessee, and it is highly unlikely that he ever became president. In The Guns of the South, Johnson plays a background role as a losing candidate for vice president, and the novel ends before the next election.\n\nUlysses S. Grant appears in The Guns of the South as the General-in-Chief of the Army, and the novel ends before he has had a chance to begin a political career. He appears in How Few Remain as a retired failure, and later volumes of Southern Victory confirm that he never became President in that timeline. In \"Must and Shall,\" he is referenced as a victorious general, but there is no indication that he was president.\n\nRutherford B. Hayes is referenced in The Guns of the South in his OTL role as a soldier, and is killed during the Second American Revolution in 1864.\n\nJames A. Garfield appears as a U.S. Senator in How Few Remain, and is never mentioned again in the rest of the Southern Victory series.\n\nBenjamin Harrison is the Secretary of War in How Few Remain, and is never referenced again in the rest of the Southern Victory series.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft appears in Southern Victory as a congressman who never becomes president.\n\nWoodrow Wilson appears in The Great War trilogy as President of the Confederate States.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt is not president in two works. He seeks the presidency in Joe Steele (both the novel and the short story) but is murdered before he can win the Democratic nomination. He features prominently in the Southern Victory series as both Secretary of War and Assistant Secretary of War for the United States cabinet, but never seeks the presidency.\n\nHarry Truman appears in Settling Accounts: In at the Death as Vice President at the end of the novel.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower appears in his OTL role as a general in The Hot War, Joe Steele (and its source story), The Man With the Iron Heart, and Worldwar. In Joe Steele, he specifically refuses to seek the office. There is no indication in Worldwar that he was ever president. In The Man with the Iron Heart and The Hot War, he is mentioned as a popular candidate, but both works end before the next election.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy appears in The Two Georges as a magazine publisher who bitterly opposes the North American Union's form of government. He appears on the cover of the U.S. edition of Colonization: Down to Earth, operating a \"futuristic\" personal computer, but he is never mentioned in the actual text of the Worldwar Franchise.\n\nRichard Nixon appears in Colonization: Second Contact (as a Congressman), The Two Georges (as a used \"steamer\" salesman), Settling Accounts: The Grapple (as a soldier), and Joe Steele (as an Assistant Attorney General). He plays background roles in The Hot War: Armistice (as a Senator) and \"Hindsight\" (as Vice President). In The Two Georges he never entered politics, while the Worldwar Franchise (of which Second Contact is part) skips ahead in time and leaves his biography undiscussed. All the others end before he has had chance to run for President.\n\nJimmy Carter appears briefly in Settling Accounts: Drive to the East, as a Confederate Navy sailor during the Second Great War in 1942, where he is promptly killed in action.\n\nRonald Reagan appears in American Empire: The Victorious Opposition and The Man With the Iron Heart in his OTL role as a media star; both timelines end before he can enter politics.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush is obliquely referenced in the satire \"Bedfellows\" as someone whom the main characters are on their way to meet. The office of presidency is not mentioned. As the story is a satire, taking the plot literally is not the best approach to the material.\n\nGeorge W. Bush appears in the guise of \"W\" in \"Bedfellows\". As with his father (above), trying to determine whether W is President in the story is beside the point. Bush is referenced obliquely in \"Birdwitching,\" where he seems to have been a head of state, but likely used a title other than President.\n\nDonald Trump appears directly in \"Election Day,\" a story predicated around his failure to win the presidency. Trump's OTL role of tycoon and pussy-grabber is occasionally referenced in stories \"set in the future of OTL\" and written well before his election as President; e.g., The Disunited States of America and Supervolcano: All Fall Down. Trump is also referenced in Alpha and Omega; he was incumbent at time of publication, but it is unclear whether he was ever President in the novel's universe.\n\nSee Also\n\nList of United States Presidential Tickets\n\nVice President of the United States, the second-highest office in the U.S., and the legally designated successor of the President in the event an incumbent cannot perform his/her duties.\n\nPresident of the Confederate States, the parallel office in the Confederate States.

The office survives longer and plays a role in The Guns of the South and Southern Victory.\n\nCensor of the Federated Commonwealths of America, the head of state of the FCA in A Different Flesh.\n\nConsul of the United States of Atlantis, the head of both state and government of the United States of Atlantis in the Atlantis Series.\n\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom, the head of government and highest elected office in the United Kingdom.\n\nGovernor-General of the North American Union, the apparent head of government in the North American Union in The Two Georges.
