A propiska, the official stamp on the passport issued by the NKVD, governed where a person could reside, and restricted who could live or work in designated \"closed cities\" (Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Odessa, Minsk, Kharkov, Vladivostok and Rostov-on-Don).

According to the story, the intent was to kill the Reverend John Reynolds, to keep him from testifying in the Jake Lingle murder trial. Father Reynolds had given up his seat on the airplane in favor of Rockne, but had already testified at the trial of Leo Brothers four days earlier.[27] The investigation of the crash, however, concluded that it was an accident caused by either turbulence or the buildup of ice on the wings.

Nevada had declared the first bank holiday on October 31, 1932, and consumer confidence had stabilized after the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt as President. The Iowa action was followed by more bank failures across the United States, and more temporary closures, with Louisiana following suit on February 3 and Michigan on February 14.

The first is to put Muscle Shoals to work. The second is to make Muscle Shoals a part of an even greater development that will take in all of that magnificent Tennessee River from the mountains of Virginia down to the Ohio and the Gulf...\" The result was that electricity was brought to rural areas in seven of the southeastern United States, in Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia.[73][74]\n\nIn response to the exodus of starving peasants from the famine in the Ukrainian SSR, Stalin and Molotov issued orders directing the national police and local authorities to \"stop, by all means necessary, the large-scale departure of peasants from Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus\" in that \"this massive exodus of the peasants has been organized by enemies of the Soviet regime\". The sale of railway tickets was halted the next day, and barricades were erected to keep peasants from leaving their district of residence.[75]\n\nAt a meeting at the home of Joachim von Ribbentrop, Nazi leaders conferred with three of President Hindenburg's advisers, Franz von Papen, Otto Meissner and the President's son, Oskar von Hindenburg to persuade the President to appoint Adolf Hitler as Chancellor.[76]\n\nDied: Elisabeth Marbury, 77, American literary agent for Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nThe Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified after the legislature of Missouri became the 36th state to vote in favor of it.

Norris of Nebraska, and submitted to the states in 1932 after overwhelming approval by the Senate (63-7) and the House (336-56), the amendment changed the Presidential inauguration from March 4 to January 20. It also changed the date of inauguration Congress members, from March 4 to January 3, and changed the opening day of Congress from \"the first Monday in December\" to January 3 as well. Prior to the change, members who had been defeated in November elections were able to continue meeting for 13 months.[78] Senator Norris had first proposed an amendment that the U.S. Senate had approved, 63 to 6, on February 13, 1923, that would have set the beginning of the new presidential and vice-presidential terms on \"the third Monday in January following their election\", and for Congress to be the first Monday in January [79] but the legislation had not been voted on in the House.\n\nThe boundary dispute between Guatemala and Honduras was settled after nearly 95 years, when the Special Boundary Tribunal issued an arbitration award. Prior attempts to settle the dispute had failed in 1845, 1895 and 1914, until the two nations agreed to submit the dispute on July 16, 1930.[80]\n\nBorn: Chita Rivera, American stage actress and dancer, 2-time Tony Award winner, winner of Presidential Medal of Freedom; (as Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero), in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Central Committee of the CPSU began a purge of the Ukrainian Communist Party by Russia—the first secretaries in three of the seven oblasts were replaced by the Soviet party, with the main change being to replace Roman Terekhov as the Kharkov party boss by Pavel Postyshev.
