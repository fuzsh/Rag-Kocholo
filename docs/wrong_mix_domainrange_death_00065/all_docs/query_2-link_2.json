It was shocking, yet not surprising that he was gone so soon after leaving the White House. Like William McKinley before him, he was an enormously popular presdient while in office, admired for his honesty and thrift, yet quickly forgotten by general public. The former presdient, out of office barely four years, considered himself a forgotten man.\n\nIn 1933, the year he died, the United States witnessed a political revolution unlike anything seen since the end of the Civil War. That year the aristocratic former Governor of New York, Franklin D. Roosevelt, took office. He was elected by a weary population seeking answers to the economic debacle that was the Great Depression. Within 100 days of his inauguration in March, the federal government began to play a much larger role in American life, and the nation was given a New Deal. Between 1933 and 1936, government spending increased more than 83 percent, while the federal debt balooned by 73 percent.1 The goal was to spur the American economy, although 9 million (or over 17 percent of the population) remained unemployed in 1939, and the promised economic recovery only came about because of the industrial production required by Americas entry into World War II.2 By comparison, the laissez-faire policies of President Warren Harding, which included almost a 40 percent cut in government spending over 1916 levels, ended the severe post-war recession he inherited within only a year of taking his office in 1921.3\n\nCoolidge lived to see Roosevelts victory in November 1932, although he died before Roosevelt took office. Always an astute observer of the political scene, he saw Roosevelt as the standardbearer of an activist philosophy of government that had once only been the dream of fringe elements. In December 1932 the ailing former President said to a friend that\n\nI feel I no longer fit in with these times. Great changes can come in four years. [Roosevelts] socialistic notions of government are not of my day....When I read\n\nof the new-fangled things that are now so popular, I realize that my time in public\n\naffairs is past.4 Calvin Coolidge had lived a good life. A small, shy boy from the hills of central Vermont, he learned from his father the importance of becoming a servant of the people. He went on to become the Governor of Massachusetts, then Vice President of the United States, and finally the President. Interestingly, some of the most fitting words about Calvin Coolidge were penned by the man himself about another American, Ulyssses S. Grant, but they apply equally to Coolidge:\n\n[His] greatness did not spring into being in a generation. There lay behind it a\n\nwide sweep of ancestry representing the blood of those who has set a standard\n\nof civilization and borne its burdens for a thousand years. Into his boyhood there\n\ncame little which was uncommon. He had the ordinary experiences of the son\n\nof an average home maintained by a moderately successful business....He did\n\nnot appear brilliant, but he had industry. He worked. He made progress. He had\n\nthat common sense which overcame obstacles....In the important decisions of his\n\nlife his fidelity and honesty are equally important....There was no artifice about him,\n\nno pretense, and no sham. Through and through he was genuine.5 As presdient, Coolidge embodied a return to honest government that Americans sought in the wake of scandals that rocked the administration of his predecessor, President Harding. In 1924, when Coolidge ran for his own term as presdient, his Democratic opponent, John W. Davis, made much of the Harding scandals, but he was also clear about Coolidge: I make no charges against the honesty and integrity of the present occupant of the White House. I think no man truthfully can.6\n\nNonetheless, Calvin Coolidge did not impress many observers as a man who would one day become the president of the United States. At best, they thought, he would live on as a footnote in American history textbooks -- a tenuous sort of political immortality. But Coolidge continued to be full of surprises. One observer remarked that\n\npeople have been reassessing Calvin Coolidge at least since the 1890's, when his Amherst classmates discovered to their astonishment that the sphinx-like Vermonter could entertain the campus with his delivery of the annual Grove Oration. Later, lawmakers in Boston would have second thoughts about the quick-witted Senate president who, when a colleague was told to go to Hell by an angry senator, calmly replied that he had looked up the law and found he didn't have to. In the 1920's, the imperious Senator Henry Cabot Lodge would live to regret his contemptuous dismissal of Coolidge's presidential chances. According to Lodge, the self-proclaimed Scholar in Politics, no man who lived in a $28 a month Northampton duplex could expect to reside at the much grander address of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.7\n\nDespite his reputation for honesty and integrity, Coolidge has generally recieved low marks from presidential historians. One poll of thirty-two \"jurors\" arranged by veteran historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., judged Coolidges presdiency to be a failure.8 These and other historians have generally charged Coolidge with creating an unsutainable level of economic prosperity that was based on rampant speculation on the stock market. They maintain that Coolidges policies led directly to the Great Depression of the 1930s. An influential American historian of a previous generation alleged that Coolidge took it easy in the White House...and did nothing to discourage the whild speculation [in the stock market] that was going on.9 For many Americans, if they consider Coolidge at all, this has been the final word on his presidency.\n\nIn recent years, however, a new generation of scholars has begun to reexamine Coolidges political legacy, and they are beginning to undermine this negative judgment. There has been a new awareness of the fact that presidents who shrunk the size of the federal government often have been judged more harshly by historians than those who advocated a larger federal government.10 This reversal of fortune in Coolidges case was predicted by none other than the writer of Coolidges New York Times obituary in 1933: A popular tradition has been established which it will be difficult to set right iin some needed particulars....But it certainly will not seem right to as time passes to put too low an estimate upon the ability of Mr. Coolidge. To support this view, the Times pointed to Coolidges unusual parts and powers, his masterly strokes in office, his political sagacity, and his courageous positions.11\n\nIn 2000, a poll of 78 scholars of history, politics, and law conducted by the Federalist Society and the Wall Street Journal ranked Coolidges presidency as average. Further, the reports authors noted that only President Ronald Regan was more underrated. In a telling comment, they concluded that Coolidge is among those presidents who are probably rated more on recieved wisdom than on assessment of their records.12\n\nThe question remains: Just who was Calvin Coolidge? Was he a do-nothing president who brought the United States to the brink of an economic depression? Or was he a president who rekindled American pride and prosperity by action and example? As we tell his story, we will come to understand why Calvin Coolidge is a man who continues to defy hasty generalizations.\n\nCHAPTER ONE: THE UNITED STATES AND VERMONT\n\nWhen Calvin Coolidge was born, Abraham Lincoln had been dead for seven years, but the ghosts of the Civil War remained. Slavery had been ended in the South, but Federal troops continued to occupy the region. The 700,000 new black voters who cast ballots in the 1868 presidential election gave victory to former Union General Ulysees S. Grant, a war hero who ran as a Republican. When [President Andrew] Johnson sank in the public estimation, Coolidge later said, Grant rose, being unanimously nominated and handsomely elected President of the United States.13 Grants popularity was so great that he was courted by both Democrats and Republicans to be their candidate.\n\nDuring his first term, Grant was embroiled in a scandal involving bribes allegedly paid by the Union Pacific Railroad to members of his administration. Coolidge, who was a student of American history, later maintained that Grant had little taste for political maneouvres....At a time when the political ideals of the country were very low, President Grant held to his own high standard of honorable public service. That level of personal integrity explained why, according to Coolidge, that Grant was nominated on first ballot at the Republican National Convention in 1872 and then went on to be triumphantly reelected in November.14 Indeed Grant trounced newspaperman Horace Greeley, who had earlier helped found the Republican party, elect Abraham Lincoln president, and then encouraged him declare the emancipation of Southern slaves. Greeley had been nominated for presdient by both the renegade Liberal Republican Party and the Democratic Party.\n\nPolitics aside, the peaceful post-war years brought with them a great torrent of intellectual activity. Discoveries and inventions were being made at a frenetic pace. At the end of the nineteenth century, British writer James Bryce noted in America the diffusion, far more than general than in any other country, of intellectual curiosity.15 In 1825 the U.S. Patent Office issued only 304 patents, but it issued an astonishing 440,000 between 1860 and 1890.16 (Naturally, the patents for a metallic nose improver and a combination cane/spitoon were hardly worth mentioning.17)\n\nThe individuals who made these discoveries were self-made entreprenuers who worked largely free of government oversight. Thomas Edison, the Wizard of Menlo Park, epitomized the self-made American inventor in the postwar era. He left school after only a few months and nursed a love of science until he created an electric voting machine, his first patented invention. Although he was nearly penniless when he came to New York after the Civil War, he went on to invent an improved stock ticker, the mimeograph, the phonograph, the Kinetoscope (the first movie camera), and the electric light, among many others. Later Edison said, I have constructed three thousand different theories in conjunction with the electric light....Yet in only rwo cases did my experiments prove the truth of my theory.18 The electric light soon transformed the nightlife of cities, which in turn attracted more people to the urban centers, leading to creation of electric trolleys, taxicabs, and subways in attempts to ease traffic congestion.\n\nNot to be outdone as an inventor, Scottish immigrant Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, which was originally intended as a device to help the deaf, his own wife among them. On March 10, 1876, Bels assistant Watson came when Bell spoke famously into his telephone: Mr. Watson, come here, I want you! Another victory for Bell came in 1893, when he made the first long-distance phone call between Boston and New York. By 1900, 1.5 million telephones were in American homes.19\n\nAlthough the typewriter had been invented before the Civil War, it underwent many improvements in the years after the war. C. Latham Sholes developed the modern version in the 1870s, and Mark Twain used it to create the first typewritten manuscript to be sent for publication. Twain said, it piled an awful stack of words on one page. The book he typed was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which was destined to become an American classic. With Twains seal of approval, Sholes invention became a staple of the American office for the next century, until it was supplanted by personal computers.20 Not all literary figures supported the typewriter, however: James Russell Lowell wrote, I could never say what I would if I had to pick out my letters like a learned pig.21\n\nAmericas growing technological prowess was on gand display at the Centennial Exhibition, held in Philadelphia in 1876. The 450-acre exhibitions most popular exhibit was the 1,500-horsepower Corliss steam engine, which provided enough electricity to power the enite Machinery Hall. There were also a wallpaper printing press and a half mile of sewing machines on display, and Bell was on hand to demonstrate his telephone. All that Great Britain and Germany have sent is insignificant in amount when compared with our own contributions, wrote William Dean Howells in the Atlantic Monthly,\n\nthe superior elegance, aptness, and ingenuity of our machinery is observable at a glance. Yes, it is still in these things of iron and steel that the national genius most freely speaks; by and by the inspired marbles, the breathing canvasses, the great literature; for the present America is voluble in the strong metals and their infinite uses.22\n\nRailroads also began to crisscross the country during this time, and in 1869 the first transcontinental railroad was completed. The Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads, which met in Utah, relied heavily on government subsidies in the form of free land and loans paid for each mile of track laid down. Speed equalled profits. As a result, poor-quality iron rails were laid down in great haste, and corners were cut in construction wherever possible, resulting in the need to rebuilt large sections of the route a few years later. Meanwhile, a Minnesota-based entreprenuer named James A. Hill constructed a railroad line from St. Paul, Minnesota, to Seattle at the end of the nineteenth century without any federal subsidies, and he helped develop markets in Asia for agricultural goods produced in the American Northwest.23\n\nWhether subsidized by government or not, over 200,000 miles of railroad track were laid down by 1900, up from a mere 30,000 miles at the beginning of the Civil War.24 Construction peaked in1916 at 254,000 miles, and then began to shrink as a result of increased competition from the automobile.25 Although the American population tripled from the Civil War to the 1920s, the miles of railroad track increased eightfold. In 1860 there was one mile of [rail]road to every 1,087 people; in 180 one mile to every 571, and in 1920 one mile to every 417.26 In 1883, the railroads spearheaded the adoption of four time zones across the United States, which replaced a haphazard system in which twleve noon was determined by the time the sun reached its highest point in each area.\n\nThe growth of the railroads helps explain the growth of American cities during this time. Although in the late 1860s a full three-quarters of the American people continued to live on farms or in small towns of less than 2,500 people,27 the trends favored the growth of urban centers. In 1860 there were only sixteen cities with a population over 50,000, but by 1900 there were seventy-eight.28 This trend was made possible in part by an astounding increase in average life expectancy, which went from 38.9 years in 1850 to 49.6 years in 1900.29\n\nThe railroads helped establish cities such as Detroit and Minneapolis, which saw their collective population rise from 93,000 to nearly 500,000 between 1870 and 1900.30 (North America, unlike Africa, has the advantage of many navigable rivers going into the interior of the continent, all of which allow large vessels to deliver goods far and wide and in turn foster economic growth.31). In the Midwest, from 1870 to 1888, cowboys led over 600,000 head of cattle north from Texas to the richer grazing land of the Midwest and thus gave birth to a prosperous meatpacking industry in places like Chicago and St. Louis.32 Between 1860 and 1915, tobacco production doubled, corn production tripled, and cotton production quadrupled. Wheat proiduction rose from 173 million bushels a year to over one billion.33 Between 1870 and 1900, agricultral exports nearly tripled, as did the number of farms.34\n\nBy the end of the Civil War, wrote one historian, America was already engaged in the most astonishing economic expansion in human history, which was to last, with one or two brief interruptions -- and a world war-- until the end of the 1920s.35 The United States, which had been a primarily agricultural economy throughout its history, was making the transition to an manufacturing economy. The shift was official by 1880, the first year in the nations history that less than half of the American work force was involved in farming.36 During the 1890s the United States surpassed Germany to become the worlds leading industrial power, a postion it has held to the present time.37\n\nAmerican businessmen were outdoing one another during this time to bring to the masses goods that were once considered luxuries. Business owners understood the iron law of a capitalist economy, namely that customers would only part with their money if they were offered lower and lower prices. Mail-order companies such as Sears, Roebuck pressured manufacturers to cut costs, which they in turn passed on to consumers. Prices on everything from bicycles to stoves to sweing machines plummeted, the result being that more and more Americans were able to enjoy luxuries that only the rich could have enjoyed several decades earlier. New labor-saving technologies for the home, such as dishwashing machines, also freed up more and more women to enter the workforce.\n\nImmigrants poured into this land of plenty, and generally they shared in the prosperity. Ten million came between 1865 and 1890.38 By 1890 New York had half as many Italians as Naples, as many Germans as Hamburg, twice as many Irish as Dublin, and two and a half times as many Jews as Warsaw.39 Many of these immigrants arrived with little more than the clothes on their backs, but most were assimilated into the great American metling pot, learned English, and began to make unique and valuable contributions to American society as they rose to become solid members of the middle-class.\n\nThere was tremendous upward mobility: the average immigrant Jew to New York, for example, stayed in crowded tenaments for only an average of fifteen years before he moved to wealthier areas in New York -- and beyond.40 Despite pockets of poverty, and the fact that new technology made those in older industries seek different employment, the United States continued to be a place of hope and opportunity for even the poorest Americans. With hard work and presistence, virtually anyone could rise from poverty and make something of himself.\n\nUnlike Europe, where one was born into an economic class and remained there, even newly arrived immigrants to the United States had the very real possibility of bettering themselves.41 As future President James A. Garfield said in a 1873 speech: Our society resembles ... the waves of the ocean, whose every drop may move freely among its fellows, and may rise toward the light until it flashes on the crest of the highest wave.42 James Bryce, a British observer, wrote of a diffusion of wealth among an immense number of small proprietors all interested in the defence of property, an exemption from chronic pauperism and economical distress, work being generally abundant, many careers open...43 One who typified this upward mobility was Scotsman Andrew Carnegie, who went on to become one of the wealthiest men in America. He immigrated to the United States as a boy and grew up in a Pittsburg slum, where he worked twelve-hour days in a factory for $1.50 a week.44 Other rags-to-riches stories included Joseph Pulitzer, who spoke barely a word of English when he arrived from Hungary at age 17, but rose to becoming a publishing magnate who owned the influential New York World newspaper.\n\nSome immigrants came of their own accord, but many more were invited, even begged, to come. American coal mines, factories, and railroads desparately needed labor, which was in short supply after the devastation of the Civil War. Companies went to Europe offering cash bonuses to laborers who would come to work in America. The state of Wisconsin had an agent in Basel, Switzerland, who was charged with coaxing the friends of Germans who had already emigrated to join their fellow countrymen in America.45 The Germans were joined by groups like the Irish, who were escaping from a devastating potato famine, and Russian Jews, who were escpaing Tsarist anti-Semitism. Congress did its part to encourage immigration by passing the Homestead Act in 1862, which promised immigrants 160 free acres of land in the West if they would agree to settle there for several years. (Later the maximum acerage was raised to 320 and then 640 acres.) A total of 147 million acres were distributed.46 Such generosity was unprecdented in world history, for in many societies only a tiny fraction of the population has ever been able to own land.47\n\n---------------\n\nIn 1872, several of the issues that would come to dominate American politics were in their embryonic stages. The first, womens suffrage, was gaining ground, and in November Susan B. Anthony was arrested and fined $100 for voting in the presidential election. She said, I will never pay a dollar,48 she never did. Glimmers of imperialism were seen in February of that year as the Senate refused to ratify a treaty that would have made Somoa an American protectorate. The national push for the prohibition of alcohol continued to be in the news as the Temperance Party fielded a full slate of national candidates in the November elections. In March, the fledgling conservation movement gained steam asYellowstone Park, the second national park, was created. And the National Labor Refrom Party was formed to protest what it perceived to be abuses perpetrated against workers by business owners.\n\nOther issues perhaps hit closer to home for most Americans. The new roller skating fad, spurred by the invention of mass-produced skates in 1866, was sweeping the nation, and even Cheyenne, Wyoming was in on the fun. Rifle shooting, horseracing, and sculling drew large crowds in an age before the advent of football and basketball. An earthquake struck California in February, and the man-made disaster known as Jesse James struck again in April by robbing the Deposit Bank of Columbia, Kentucky. In August in Chicago, Aaron Montgomery Ward sent out his first mail-order catalogue, capitalizing upon the new markets opened up by the railroads. Readers were buying copies of Roughing It, the latest Mark Twain novel, and a new magaine called Popular Science Monthly tapped into Americas love affair with technology. Much of that technology would be on display at the United States Centenntial, the planning for which got underway in earnest when Congress established the Centennial Commission in May.\n\nThen as now, the pace of life varied across the country. While some areas were becoming more and more cosmpolitan, Calvin Coolidges childhood in the hills of central Vermont remained very much a throwback to the nations agricultural roots. There the rhythms of life had not changed in many decades. Farmers wore the same woolen grey smocks that their colonial ancestors did, and old women like his great-aunt still smoked clay pipes.49 In his Autobiography, Coolidge recounted those halcyon days with an unmistakeable fondness:\n\nWe had husking bees, apple-paring bees and singing schools in the winter. There were parties for the young folks and an occasional dramatic exhibition by local talent. Not far away there were some public dances, which I was never permitted to attend.\n\nSome time during the summer we usually went to the circus, often rising by three oclock to get there early. In the autumn we visited the county fair. The holidays were all celebrated in some fashion.\n\nOf course the Fourth of July meant a great deal to me, because it was my birthday. The first one I can remember was when i was four years old. My father took me fishing in the meadow brook in the morning. I recall that I fell in the water, after which we had a heavy thundershower, so that we both came home very wet. Usually there was a picnic celebration on that day.\n\nThanksgiving was a feast day for family reunions at the home of the grandparents. Christmas was a sacrament observed with the exchange of gifts, when the stockings were hung, and the spruce tree was lighted in the symbol of Christian faith and love. While there was a lot of hard work, there was no lack of pleasurable diversion.50\n\nThis is not to say that Plymouth was necessarily isolated. The stagecoach brought Rutland and Boston newspapers to Plymouth, and some of the items for sale in the country store (such as oranges and medicines) were imported from out of state. Even the Sunday School curriculum that Calvin Coolidges grandmother used was purchased via mail order from Chicago. In reality, though, the residents of Plymouth most often chose not to exploit their ability to be in greater contact with the outside world.51\n\nIf we want to understand Calvin Coolidge, then, we must first understand that he was a shy boy from the hills of rural Vermont. Unlike Theodore Roosevelt, he was not born into a family of any great power or privilege.52 He was a child of the working class who appreciated the common sense of the commom man. More than that, however, he understood and respected the inherent dignity of every human being. No man was ever meanly born, Coolidge once said. About his cradle is the wondrous miracle of life.53\n\nCHAPTER TWO: SHADOWS AND SUNLIGHT\n\nIn September 1928, President Calvin Coolidge left Washington for Vermont to view the damage and reconstruction resulting from the flood of 1927. There he extolled the virtues of his native state:\n\nVermont is a state I love. I could not look upon the peaks of Ascutney, Killington, Mansfield, and Equinox, without being moved in a way that no other scene could move me. It was here that I first saw the light of day; here I received my bride, here my dead lie pillowed on the loving breast of our everlasting hills. I love Vermont because of her hills and valleys, her scenery and her invigorating climate. But most of all because of her people. They are a race of pioneers who have almost beggared themselves in the service of others. If the spirit of Liberty should vanish from other parts of our Union and the support of our institutions should languish, it could all be replenished from the generous store held by the people of the brave little state of Vermont.54\n\nThe town of Plymouth, where Calvin Coolidge first opened his eyes, was formally organized in 1787, even as the United States Constitution was being written in Philadelphia. The town is about seven square miles and has the Black River flowing through its western region, sometimes forming beautiful lakes. The towns larger neighbors, Ludlow and Woodstock, lie about twelve miles north and southwest, respectively. Rutland, which was on the railroad lines, was six miles to the east, on the other side of the Green Mountains.\n\nAs in the past, vistors to Plymouth today can walk along wooded trails lined with beech, maple, white pine, and many other varieties of trees. The mountains are green year-round because of the evergreen spruce trees. Plymouth is near the middle of the state, to the east of the Green Mountains made famous by Nathan Hale and the Green Mountain Boys during the Revolution. Saltash Mountain, over 3,000 feet high, is the mountain in Plymouth, and there are wonderful views to be had. New Hampshires White Mountains can be seen 80 miles away in New Hampshire.\n\nEarly settlers to Vermont came from Massachusetts, Rhose Island, and Connecticut. They were English Puritan stock, Coolidge wrote in his Autobiography, and their choice of a habitation stamps them with a courageous pioneering spirit.55 They named the towns they founded after the ones they left back home, as the English also did for the towns they founded in the New World.\n\nThe area in and around Plymouth was covered with old-growth forests, but they were soon cut down and burned to create farmland and to clear the way for log cabins. There were also little clusters of houses in Plymouth, hamlets, all with different names. The one in which the future presdient lived, up in hill country, was called Plymouth Notch. Even during his presidency, over fifty years later, a local resident reported that the Notch consisted of five or six farm houses, a store, a church, a cheese factory, and a school house. One of these farms is owned by John C. Coolidge, father of the President, and has been in the family for several generations.56 Vermont was a sparsely populated state -- the 12,000 people in Rutland made it the states second largest city -- but Plymouth was tiny even by Vermont standards.\n\nPlymouth retained its rustic charm into the early twentieth century. During the presidnecy of Calvin Coolidge, it was still true that Modern bathrooms and running hot water are mostly unknown.57 Although Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone in 1876, the first telephone line in Plymouth was not installed until August 3, 1923, the day Coolidge had taken the oath of office in his fathers house. Calvin used the phone to send his first official message to Washington that day.58\n\nIn many respects, Plymouth and most of Vermont was in a period of decline when Calvin was born, and the situation wasnt helped by a five-year economic depression that swept the country beginning in late 1873. Because of the harsh climate and thin, rocky soil, most farmers could only expect to break even from year to year. Many of their children were taking the railroads and moving to bigger cities in search of better jobs. Farmers grew old and died, and there was no one left to continue the family tradition. Many farm buildings and dirt roads fell into disrepair and nature reclaimed the fields. In Plymouth alone, the population fell from 1,285 in 1870 to 755 in 1890. This reflected a distrubing trend: a full four-fifths of Vermont towns lost population in the 1880s.59 It would be some time before the state began to develop full-fledged dairy and tourism industries.\n\nWhile more and more people were leaving Plymouth, others stayed. There were various craftsmen in Plymouth, including a miller who ground the corn and a clock tinker, as well as various Yankee traders. As Coolidge wrote in his Autobiography, the local residents were a solid breed:\n\nThe neighborhood around [Plymouth] Notch was made up of people of expemplary habits. Their speech was clean and their lives were above reproach. They had no mortgages on their farms. If any debts were contracted they were promptly paid. Credit was good and their was money in the savings bank.\n\nThe break of day saw them stirring. Their industry continued until twilight. They kept up no church organization, and there was little regular preaching the outward manifestation of religion through public profession had little opportunity, but they were without exception a people of faith and charity and good works. They cherished the teachings of the Bible and sought to live in accordance with its precepts.\n\nThe conduct of the young people was modest and respectful.60\n\nThis is not to say that Plymouth did not have its own local color, perhaps made more so by the local gossip mill, a staple of most small communities. One colorful example was an animal handler named Joe Jewell, who had a habit of shouting at his horses and oxen because he thought they were deaf. Another was Amos Butler, who trained a cow to draw a buggy like a horse. Once a young schoolteacher named Carrie Brown sat with him in his buggy to have their picture taken after no other women were willing. If you women are afraid, I am not, she said. She later became the second wife of John Coolidge, the father of the future president.61\n\n---------------------\n\nCalvin Coolidge was of old Puritan stock, very much concetrated New England.62 He was descended from John Coolidge, an Englishman who came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony about the year 1630. John Coolidge became a freeman and later held political office. To each of his five suriviving sons he gave a farm. President Coolidge was a descendant of John Coolidge through Johns second son, Simon.\n\nCalvin Coolidges relatives proliferated in Massachusetts, and later they were among the earliest settlers of Plymouth, Vermont. Captain John Coolidge, a Revolutionary War veteran and the great, great grandfather of the president, was a towering 6 foor, 6 inches tall. In 1781 he settled in the hamlet of Frog City in Plymouth. Captain Coolidge was taller than even George Washington, who at six feet, four and a half inches63 was a full head taller than the average Revolutiuonary War solider, who stood just five feet, eight inches tall.64\n\nCaptain Coolidges son, Calvin, came to live in Plymouth Notch, on the Coolidge farm, in 1801. His son, Calvin Galusha Coolidge, was born there in 1815. One Plymouth resident recalled the personality of the thin man locals knew as Galoosh65 :\n\nHe had a streak of humor, was fond of practical jokes, and had considerable ability. He held most of the important offices in town at different times. The appreciation of the humor that the President is not always credited with is to some extent an inheritance from his grandfather.66\n\nOn a serious note, Calvin Galusha was a kindhearted man. When his sisters son and daughter were ophaned, he and his wife raised them to adults and then gave them the young man the then-princely sum of $800 to give him a start in the world. The future presdient loved his grandfather, who taught him to ride a horse and later left him a farm of forty acres in his will.67 Calvin galusha wanted his grandson to take after him and become a farmer. As Calvin explained, In his mind, the only real, respectable way to get a living was from tilling the soil. He therefore did not exactly approve having his son go into a trade.68\n\nCalvin G. Coolidges wife, and the future presidents paternal grandmother, Sarah Brewer, was known as Aunt Mede to all who knew her. She has a skilled herbalist, midwife, spinner, and weaver. Her grandson remembered her fondly in his Autobiography:\n\nFor most of the time during my boyhood regular Sunday school classes were held in the church which my grandmother Coolidge superintended until in her advanced years she was usperseded by my father. She was a constant reader of the Bible and a devoted member of the church, who daily sought for divine guidance in prayer.\n\nI stayed with her at the farm for much of the time and she had much to do with shaping the thought of my early years. She had a benign influence over all who came in contact with her. The Puritan severity of her convictions was tempered by the sweetness of a womanly charity. There were none whom she ever knew that had not in some way benefitted by her kindness.69\n\nCalvin G. and Sarah Coolidge had two sons. Their first son, Julius caesar Cooligde, died at the age of 20. Their second son, John Calvin Coolidge, became the father of a president. John Coolidge was a Jack of all trades to the residents of Plymoyth. His official job was storekeeper, but he also served in suhc varied capacities as attorney, blacksmiths assistant, farmer, and superintendant of schools. According to his son, John Coolidge earned the respect of everyone in town: He trusted everybody, but lost a surprisingly small amount. Sometimes people he had not seen in years would return and pay him the whole amount.70\n\n------------------\n\nAlthough he was not born in a log cabin, John Calvin Coolidge was undoubtedly born in humble circumstances on July 4, 1872. There is no record of the time of day he was born, nor how long the delivery took, although we know July was in the middle of haymaking season, the time when farmers spent long hours in the fields gathering the hay that would have to last their horses and cows through the winter.71 Coolidge wrote in his Autobiography that he was born in one room of his parents five room cottage, to whcih the town post office and his fathers general store were attached:\n\nOur house was well shaded with maple trees and had a yard in front\n\nenclosed with a picket fence, in which grew a mountain ash, a plum tree,\n\nand the customarypurple lilac bushes. In the summertime my mother\n\nplanted her flower bed there.72\n\nIt is likely that Dr. Rodman, the Coolidge family physician, was on hand for the delivery, as was Calvins gradmother, who some experience as a midwife.73 Gramdmother Coolidge would keep her grandson supplied with stockings, mittens, and blankets.\n\nThe future president was named after his father, John, but it wasnt long before the younger Coolidge began to be called by his middle name. The reason was plain: Calvin, or Cal as he was called, looked and acted more like those on his mothers side of the family. Calvin Coolidges son, John, described the differences between his father and grandfather:\n\nMy father and his father resembled each other very little physically. Grandfather Coolidge was six feet tall, broad-shouldered, big-boned, and study; he has an almost swarthy complexion. Father on the other hand was, like his mother, of smaller and less-rugged build, with features more delicately molded and a fair complexion. The two men were also quite dissimilar in temperament, Grandfather being of an even disposition, not easily upset, while Father (despite the impassiveness he displayed in public) was high-strng and quick-tempered.\n\nStill, the father and son also had things in common: Both were sparing of speech--although each could, on occasion, be quite loquacious. Both took life seriously. Both were thrifty, honest, industrious, and undemonstrative.74\n\nJohn Coolidge was the type of person who could only exist in a very small town, where there are not enough people to take on the roles and responsibilities needed to make a civilized society function. During his life, John served the people of Plymouth in many different capacities, ranging from justice of the peace to deputy sheriff to superintendant of schools. Someone once said to him, You appear to have been everything in this town except the undertaker. John thought for a moment, and then replied that he had once made coffins as a boy.75\n\nBoth John and Calvin Coolidge were political animals. In time, Johns local popularity brought him into state politics. He served three terms in the Vermont House of Represnenatives and one term in the Senate. In his Autobiography, Calvin Coolidge wrote of the impression that his fathers political activities made upon him:\n\nTwo days after I was two months old, my father was elected to the state legislature. By a curious coincidence, when my son was the same age I was elected to the same office in Massachusetts. He was reelected twice, the term being two years, and, while he was serving, my grandfather took my mother and me to visit him at Montpelier.\n\nI think I was three years and four months old, but I always remembered the experience....That was the first of the great many jounreys which I have since made to legislative halls.76\n\nThere was a mutual respect between father and son. John Coolidge was proud of his son, but, Calvins son recalled:\n\nI am sure he breated no direct word of such gratification to Father, who for his part, once decalred: I do not recall that any one in whose judgment I would place much reliance ever told me in my younger days that I should be presdient. If my mother had any such notion she kept it to herself, and the remarks of my father indicated he thought if I did not change my ways I would fall on the towns hands.77\n\nSoon after his fathers death, Calvin wrote: I could not recall that I ever knew of his doing a wrong thing. He would be classed as decidely a man of character...He did not fear the end of life, but looked forward to it as a reunion with all he had loved and lost.78\n\nCalvins mother, Victoria Josephine Coolidge, was the daughter of a successful farmer who lived acorss the street from the country store. Victoria and her family had moved to Plymouth when she was three years old, and she and her future husband grew up together. They were married in 1868. She was of a very light and fair complexion with a rich growth of brown hair that had a glint of gold in it, wrote Calvin in his Autobiography. Her hands and features were regular and finely modeled. The older people always told me how beautiful she was in her youth. The mixture of suffering and strength that was his mother made a deep impression on young Calvin, and he reserved some of his most beautiful prose for her:\n\nShe was practically an invalid ever after I could remember her, but used what strength she had in lavish care upon me and my sister, who was three years younger. There was a touch of mysticism and poetry in her nature which made her love to gaze at the pirple sunsets and watch the evening stars.\n\nWhatever was grand and beautiful in form and color attracted her. It seemed as though the rich green tints of the foliage and the blossoms of the flowers came for her in the springtime, and in the autumn it was for her in the springtime, and in the autumn it was for her that the mountain sides were struck with crimson and with gold.79\n\nHis mother loved him, and she became his first teacher. In his Autobiography, he recalled those early days:\n\nMy education began with a set of blocks which had on them the Roman numerals and the letters of the alphabet. It is not yet finished. As I played with them and asked my mother what they were, I came to know them all when I was three years old.80\n\nAt this time in America, Mark Twain was becoming famous for novels such as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which he published in 1876. Other bestselling books included some destined to become classics: Little Women, Around the World in Eighty Days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Ben-Hur.81 Victoria Coolidge read good books, and she was especially fond of the poetry of Tennyson and Scott, which she taught her son. He memorized extensive passages and could recite them at will. Sarah Coolidge, Calvins grandmother, gave him a solid foundation in the Bible, and she also gave him a set of Shakespeares complete works.82\n\nOn April 15, 1875, when Calvin was nearly three years old, Victoria Coolidge gave birth to a daughter named Abagail Gratia Coolidge. Everyone called her Abbie. She looked and acted like a true Coolidge. Despite their differences in appearance and personality, Calvin and Abbie quickly became playmates and friends.\n\nAt the time Abbie was born, John Coolidge ran the Notchs only store. He had begun to operate the store after he and Virginia were married, thereby angering his father, who wanted John to take over the family farm. The store was a financial success. While he rented the building for $40 pyer year, John made profits of $100 per month. With this income, he felt comfortable enough to use $375 of savings to buy the house in which his son would take the presidential oath of office many years later.\n\nIn 1878, when his father died, John inherited property and sold the store to his brother-in-law, F.C. Moor.83 John Coolidge had greater aspirations for himself than remaining a storekeeper. When he was three, Calvins grandfather took him and his mother to Montpelier to see John, who was serving the second of what would later be three two-year terms in the Vermont state legislature. Although the intent of the trip was doubtless to let Calvin see his father at work and possibly to introduce him to the wonders of state politics, the boys attention was quickly diverted elsewhere:\n\nI think I was three years and four months old, but I always remembered the\n\nexperience. Grandfather carried me to the State House and sat me in the\n\nGovernors chair, which did not impress me so much as a stuffed catamount\n\nthat was in the capital museum.84\n\nCalvin Coolidge would again sit in a Governors chair. The next time, however, it would be for real.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: ON THE FARM AND AT SCHOOL\n\nLife in Plymouth was demanding, but it was not without its simple pleasures. The idyllic setting was the playground of young Calvin Coolidge:\n\nAbout the Notch and Union are many of these attractive mountains and hills. President Calvin Coolidge as a boy often climbed to their summits, tramped through the woods, fished the streams, coasted in winter down the steep snow- covered hillsides, rode horseback on his calico horse, went to parties in the winter to the tune of the sleigh bells, in the summer went to the circus in Rutland or Ludlow and on excursions, and in the fall to county fairs at Windsor or Rutland. Frequently he went to Ludlow, Woodstock and Rutland with his father or relatives.85\n\nOne of the treats for the Coolidge family was an annual trip to see the circus six miles away in Ludlow. Calvin especially liked the equestrian acts because his grandfather had taught him how to ride horses standing up.86\n\nCoolidge was not a malicious youth, but he had a droll sense of humor that few outside of New England seemed able to detect, let alone appreciate. Once as a young man he came into the hosue with a very dirty face and hands. When he was told to wash up, he replied, I do not know about that, I have known people to get drowned in water.87 His sense of humor was finely tuned, so much so that even noted humorist Will Rogers took notice of it many years later when Coolidge was the President:\n\nMr. Coolidge had more subtle humor than almost any public man I ever met. I have often said I would like to have been hidden in his desk somewere and just heard the sly little digs he pulled on various poeple that never got em at all.88\n\nAlthough he was normally quiet and was not given to bursts of laughter, observant friends later in life noted the sly, amused look in his sharp blue eyes as he listened to a conversation.89 Herbert Hoover, a Coolidge cabinet official who would later become President in his own right, added that Coolidge was better apart from the crowds: Many times over the five years he sent for me to come to the White House after dinner just to talk an hour or two. He had a fund of New England stories and a fine, dry wit.90\n\nNot surprisingly, Calvin Coolidge did not fit in well with the other, more typical boys in Plymouth. If these boys thought about him at all, they considered him to be a loner. He spent more time than usual reading books, and when he did play, he prefered to play with younger children. He befriended his familys cats and considered them his friends. I dont think Calvin really knew what play was, said his father years later.91 Perhaps his social difficulties came partly becasue he was smaller than other boys his age, but Coolidge also suffered from an acute case of shyness that made him uncomfortable with strangers. In a revealing interview given while he was President, Coolidge provided some insight into the inner workings of his mind:\n\nDo you know, Ive never really grown up? Its a hard thing for me to play this game. In politics, one must meet people, and thats not easy for me....When I was a little fellow, as long ago as I can remember, I would go into a pnaic if I heard strange voices in the kitchen. I felt I just couldnt meet people and shake hands with them. Most of the visitors would sit with Father and Mother in the kitchen, and the hardest thing in the world was to have to go through the kitchen door and give them a greeting. I was almost ten before I realized I couldnt go on that way. And by fighting hard I used to manage to get through the door. Im all right with old friends, but every time I meet a stranger, Ive got to go through the old kitchen door, and its not easy.92\n\nIn addition, he confided, I am as mcuh interested in human beings as one could possibly be, but it is desperately hard for me to show it.93 His brand of humor, therefore, was ideally suited to a shy person who spent a considerable amount of time watching life from a distance.\n\n---------------------\n\nCalvin began his formal education in December 1877, when he was five years old. The nation was still recovering from the turmoil brought about by a disputed election in which Repiblican Rutherford B. Hayes, a former major general in the Union army, had become presdient, defeating Democrat Samuel J. Tilden by one vote in the Electoral College. Florida, with its four Electoral College votes, had decalred for Hayes, apparently giving him a narrow victory. However, Democrats charged that Republicans had used threats and bribery to win the support of Southern states of Louisiana, South Carolina, both of which were still occupied by Federal troops. Some threatened violence to keep Hayes out of office.\n\nIn December 1876, Congress establihed a bipartisan Electoral Commission to investigate the charges of impropriety and then declare a winner. For months, the nation waited for the results. Finally, on March 2, only two days before Inauguration Day, the Commission voted 8 to 7 to certify Hayes as the victor. Many of Tildens supporters continued to believe that the process was faulty (Hayes became known as Rutherfraud), and some urged Tilden to protest the results. One Tilden supporter even fired a single gunshot into Hayes house while he was eating dinner.\n\nTilden, however, was not about to plunge the nation into chaos, especially so soon after the end of the Civil War. I prefer four years of Hayes administration to four years of Civil War, he said.94 In order to pacify angry Tilden supporters, though, a deal seems to have been made for Hayes to withdraw Federal troops from the South in exchange for Tilden and the Democrats not continuing to fight the election results. And true to his promise, Hayes withdrew the remaining Federal troops from the South soon after taking office, and the Democrats took hold of the region for the next century.\n\nAnother issue that came to the forefront in 1876 was the dispute over the nations currency. Until the time of Abraham Lincoln, all government paper money was supported by an equivalent amount of precious metal -- either gold or silver. However, during the Civil War Lincoln issued $450 million in paper currency with no gold or silver reserves to back them up. Speculators bought these greenbacks for less than face value and then after the war demanded that the federal government redeem the currency for gold. The Greenbacks, who fielded a presdiential candidate in 1876, believed that the tough economic times for farmers in the West were caused by a lack of currency in ciurculation. The farmers wanted higher prices for their products, which they believed would be brought about by printing more money and therefore inflating the currency. Businessmen, meanwhile, feared inflation because it would eventually rise until the currency was devalued and prices for goods and services spiraled out of control.\n\nThe Hayes Administration resumed payment of gold for greenbacks in 1879, but these years were notable more for the ban on obsecities, tobacco, and alcohol in the White House.95 Lucy Hayes, the First Lady, was nicknamed Lemondade Lucy because she barred all alcohol from the White House. Little did she know that White House servants continued to offer willing guests frozen rum punch concelaed inside oranges.96\n\nIn December 1877, after the firestorm of controversy in Washington had died down, Calvin began to take classes in the old schoolhouse a few yeards away from the Coolidge home. The little stone school house which had unpainted benches and desks wide enough to seat two was attended by about twenty-five scholars, he recalled.97 The building was in a state of disrepair, and it was finally torn down in 1886, the year after Calvin graduated, and was replaced with a wooden structure.98\n\nThe school was not divided by grade level, and Calvin was initially the youngest student. There were twenty families in the area, and twenty-three children, ages five through eighteen, attended the school. Classes were held from May to February so that in the springtime children could help their parents plow their fields and harvest the sap from the maple trees.99 On cold days at school, students would gather around a wood stove in the center of the room.\n\nThere was one schoolteacher at any given time, and they often came from away and boarded with a local family. The teachers were mostly young women, although there was an occassional male teacher. In a classroom with such a wide age disparity, it is not suprising that eachers were chosen as much for their ability to maintain discipline as to impart knowledge.100 As the years wore on, young Calvin learned reading, math, grammar, and United States history. He spent much of his time memorizing long passages of material, and then reciting them aloud. Despite his early exposure to literature and poetry, Calvins favorite topics quickly became history and biography.\n\nSchool records incidcate that Calvin was a solid student, although not exceptional, rarely tardy, and rarely in trouble. A former Plymouth teacher could recall only one time when one of his teachers...gave him a real shaking-up and in so doing disloged many buttons from his clothers. To get even with her he left the buttons on his desk for several days and came to school with his clothes minus the buttons.101 School registers indicate that his behavior was good throughout his time at school, although he once earned a beating from a female classmate becasue he continued to throw snow down her neck.102\n\nThere was no indication early on that young Calvin would do anything exceptional. None of his classmates recalled that Coolidge stood out from the crowd. According to Albert A. Sargent, a classmate, He wasnt particularly brilliant or otherwise at school....He wasnt a leader in anything. Academically he most often finished in the top tier of students, but was never first.103\n\n----------------------\n\nJohn Coolidge didnt indulge his sons timidity. As Calvin grew, he was given an increasing number of chores to do around the familys farm. He helped fix fences and harvest portatoes and corn. There was 800 to 2,000 tons of maple syrup to harvest each season, and according to his father, Cal could get more sap out of a maple tree than any boy I ever saw.104 As he grew, Calvin learned to cut and store enough firewood to get the family through the long Vermont winters. His first income -- fifty cents -- was earned by cutting a cord of wood.105\n\nAfter work hours, Calvin and the local men, some of whom were Civil War veterans, would drop into the store to get the evening mail and exchange ciews on topics of interest...106 There was not only the local news to discuss, but the national political scene was as interesting as ever. In 1878, the Democrats gained control of both houses of Congress for the first time since before the beginning of the Civil War, but were narrowly defeated in the 1880 presdiential election by long-time Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield, a former Union general who was also a talented debater and speaker.\n\nPresident Garfield entered the White House with the intention of reforming the civil service, which had grown almost hopelessly corrupt and largely unaccountable to the American people. As a biographer wrote, Garfield experienced firsthand the grasping that took place by propspective office holders:\n\nThey invaded his private house in swarms. They stopped his carriage in the street; they called him out of bed; they bored him in the railroad carriages and stations; they wrote to his wife and sons; they courted, fawningly, all his old neighbors and relatives....More than six hundred applications were made for one office...He could give it to but one, and thus innocently made more than six hundred bitter enemies.107\n\nOne of those enemies was James Guiteau, a failed lawyer and author, who had written to Garfield to ask that he be appointed to a diplomatic post in Marseilles, France. He spoke briefly to Garfield before his inauguration, and Garfield promised to speak to him about the appointment at a later date. Guiteau took this as a promise from Garfield to award him the diplomatic post, and he shadowed Garfield for days, hoping to cement the deal, but Garfield finally refused him the post because of Guiteaus apprent mental instability. Guiteau took his revenge six months into Garfields first term, shooting the president twice in a Baltimore train station. After an agonizing three months, Garfield succumbed to his injuries, and the nation had its second slain president in less than a generation. Now we almost seem to have lost a personal friend, wrote Alfred Tennyson.108\n\nAnother former Union general, Chester A. Arthur, Garfields vice president and a man who had never held political office, became the new Chief Executive. Arthur, once a corrupt clerk at the New York Customs House, had been put on the ticket by Republican leaders opposed to civil service reform. During his term, however, he signed the Pendleton Act, which institued a merit system for the civil service, an issue that recieved new attention in the wake of the Garfield tragedy. Arthur also began building steel Navy ships, and he signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Hawaii to grant the United States exclusive rights to a coaling station at Pearl Harbor. The White House also got a good cleaning, and twenty-four wagonloads of articles were collected and sold at auction. He failed to win support for relection, however, and retired in 1885 after serving out the remainder of Garfields term.\n\n-----------\n\nCalvin Coolidge never did become a farmer, despite the forty acres and the farm animals willed to him by his grandfather when he was still only a child. Another aspect of life in Plymouth, however, did get Calvins attention. From an early age, John Coolidge exposed Calvin to the breath and width of local politics, thereby teaching him lessons to last a lifetime:\n\nIn my youth [my father] was also engaged in the transaction of all kinds of town business, being constantly elected for that purpose....This work gave him such a broad knowledge of the practical side of the law that people of the neighborhood were constantly seeking his advice, to which I awlays listened with great interest. He always counseled them to resist injustice and avoid unfair dealing, but to keep their agreements, meet their obligations and observe strict obedience to the law. By reason of what I saw and heard in my early life, I came to have a good working knowledge of the practicial side of government.109\n\nFollowing in his fathers footsteps, Calvin he tried to marry politics with an entreprenurial spirit. I was accustomed to carry apples and popcorn calls to the town meetings to sell, maninly because my grandmother said my father had done so when he was a boy, and I was exceedingly anxious to grow up to be like him.110 Another time his grandmother paid Calvin one dollar not to dance, and because Calvin had little desire to dance anyway, he gladly accepted her offer.111\n\n--------------\n\nThe first personal personal loss in the life of Calvin Coolidge took place in 1878, when Calvin G. Coolidge, his grandfather, died. Calvin had always been close to his grandfather, and he was present while the rugged old Yankee lay upon his deathbed. In his final hours, Calvin G. Coolidge looked to his grandson, then only six years old, to open the Coolidge family Bible and uphold on a family tradition: During his last illness he would have me read to him the first chapter of the Gospel of John, which he had read to his grandfather.112 Later, after he was sworn in as President, Calvin Coolidge kissed the very same Coolidge family Bible on the exact Scripture passage he had read to his grandfather many years earlier.113\n\nAlthough young Calvin was too young at the time to fully comprehend the importance of religious traditions, he had learned from his mother and grandmother that religion was something to be taken seriously. His personal faith was never of the evangelistic variety, but it was deeply rooted and heartfelt. According to an old schoolmaster who knew Calvin well, there is plenty of evidence that Mr. Coolidge in his personal life and character is a thorough-going Christian.114 As Presdient, Calvin discussed the importance of faith in God, especially for those in positions of responsibility:\n\nI have always attended church regularly when I could, but there being no organized church in our town when I was a boy, I did not join a church. After I became President the First Congregational Church of Washington, without consulting me, voted to make me a member. I was pleased that they took such action and of course accepted the election to membership which they offered me....It would be difficult for me to conceive anyone being able to administer the dutiesof a great office like the Presidency without a belief in the guidance of a divine providence. Unless the President is sustained by an abiding faith in a divine power which is working for the good of humanity, I cannot understand how he would have the courage to attempt to meet the various problems that constantly pour in upon him from all parts of the earth.115\n\n--------------------\n\nCalvin Coolidge needed every ounce of faith he could muster in order to face the death of other family members in the years to come. The next blow was the worst: when Calvin was twelve years old, his beloved mother died. Tragically, Victoria Coolidge never recovered from a long bout with tuberculosis, an illness that in the nineteenth century was often fatal. Many victims simply wasted away. In Vermont at the time, about one in six deaths was due to tuberculosis, which was higher than the national average.116 In his Autobiography, Calvin Coolidge recalled his mothers death:\n\nWhen she knew that her end was near she called us children to her bedside, where we knelt down to recieve her final parting blessing.\n\nIn an hour she was gone. It was her thirty-ninth birthday. I was twelve years old. We laid her away in the blustering snows of March. The greatest grief that can come to a boy came to me. Life was never to seem the same again.117\n\nAs Presdeint, he sat with his Secret Service agent at the White House, smoking large black cigars on the back porch on summer nights when Grace was away. It was in those almost carefree moments that the childhood memories of his mother came rushing back. He seemed to rememebr every day he had spent with her [his mother], Starling wrote. He communed with her, talked with her, and took every problem to her. I wish I could really speak to her, he said one night. I wish that often. 118 When Calvin Coolidge died in 1933, only two items were found in his clothing: a watch and a faded picture of his mother.119\n\nGiven the fact that Calvins mother had died from tuberculosis, and that his uncle was presently suffering from its symptoms, many residents of Plymouth, including Calvin Coolidge himself, believed it to be just a matter of time before the young man himself was struck down by the disease.120 We do know that he suffered from bronchitis as well as severe colds, and there were periods lasting as long as a week where he had no appetite.121 Despite the wagging tongues in Plymouth, though, Calvin defied the odds and escaped serious illness.\n\nNationally, the year of 1885 marked the passing of Union General Ulysses S. Grant, the former president, who died of cancer of the throat only four days after completing his memoirs. Grant was a smoker, but his son Buck Grant said he had little doubt but that the primary cause of the cancers development in the throat was the eating of a peach. Part of the fuzz stuck in Fathers throat, causing an irritation from which the cancer was formed.122 As his funeral procession made its way down Fifth Avenue in New York City, two former Union generals and two former Confederate generals marched side-by-side as his pallbearers in a profound display of national solidatity. Twenty years after the end of the Civil War, the nation seemed ready to put away the bloody shirts.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe death of Calvins mother changed the dynamics of his immediate family. His father, now a widower, continued to travel out of Plymouth on personal or town business. Calvin and Abbie spent much more time with Grandmother Coolidge while their father was away. At times, Calvin was allowed to stay alone in Johns house, as long as the chores were done, while Abbie remained with her grandmother.\n\nEven as Calvin coped with his grief, he was beginning to look toward the future. He was nearing the point where continuing at the one-room schoolhouse would bring him diminishing retruns. Already he was as educated as almost any adult in Plymouth. In November 1885, at his fathers urging, Calvin took the state teachers exam and passed it. This made him able under Vermont law to teach at any public school in the state.123 It was not unusual for teenager to become teachers in Vermont. As Calvin recalled, my sister Abbie passed [the exam] and taught a term of school in a neighboring town when she was twelve years old.124\n\nCalvin had no desire to become a teacher, however. Instead he wanted to continue his education, which would necessarily take him beyond the borders of Plymouth. The nearest high school was ten miles away and the nearest college, forty.125 Uncharacteristically, Calvin continued to press the issue with his father whenever he saw an opportunity, which showed that he had made up his mind.\n\nJohn Coolidge was initially resistant to the idea of sending this shy boy away to school. For a thrifty individual such as Calvins father, there was also a consideration of the tuition and boarding costs. Would he gain a return on his investment? So far as I know, Calvin wrote in his Autobiography, neither he nor any other members of my family ever entertained any ambitions in my behalf. He evidently wished me to stay on the land. Calvins grandmother, too, was worried that her grandson didnt have the temparament needed to succeed in a more urban environment.\n\nCalvin persisted, and his fathers initial reluctance began to weaken. Perhaps John came to appreciate that he and his son were not quite so different after all. John had resisted his fathers wishes when he went into business and politics, just as Calvin was resisting Johns wishes by wanting to go away to school.\n\nSometime in early 1886, Calvin finally convinced his father that he should continue his education. The winter term at the Notch school was ending on Febuary 19, and there were schools to visit. Because there was no equivalent of a modern high school in Plymouth, father and son traveled twelve miles out of town to Woodstock in early February to visit one school. When that school proved to be unsatisfactory to John Coolidge, his attention turned toward Black River Academy in Ludlow.\n\nJohn had attended B.R.A., as locals called it, and there were many young people from Plymouth who were current students. Henry Brown, who grew up with Calvin, was a student at B.R.A., and Calvin undoubtedly learned about the school from him. William Stickney, the son of one of Johns old friends, was an attorney in Ludlow, and he would be a valuable resource to the shy teenager.\n\nOn February 13, 1886, John Coolidge went to Ludlow to arrange for Calvin to attend B.R.A. Meanwhile, Calvin stayed home to do some hunting with a few friends. The next day John returned to Plymouth and announced that Calvin had been accepted as a student at B.R.A. John had also arranged for Calvin to stay with Alva Peck, a law clerk employed by Stickney.\n\nThere was little time to prepare. The winter term at the Notch school ended on Friday, Febrary 19, and classes would begin at B.R.A. the following Monday. There was a going-away party at Johns house on Thursday, where Calvin made molasses candy for the guests. His best clothes were then packed into two suitcases, and he was ready to leave.\n\nCalvin was thirteen years old, and ready to make his mark in the world beyond Plymouth. Going to the Academy, Calvin wrote, meant a complete creak with the past and entering a new and untried field, larger and more alluring than the past, among unknown scenes and unknown people.126 Not only that, but Ludlow was in greater contact with the wider world. There is some truth in the statement of an early Coolidge biographer: When he left Plymouth Notch for Ludlow to attend high school, he traversed fifty years in two hours journey to the railroad.127\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: LUDLOW OR BUST\n\nOnce his father announced that his son had been accepted as a student at Black River Academy, Calvin could barely contain his enthusiasm, such as it was. That was one of the greatest moments of my life, he recalled. The packing and preparation for it required more time and attention than collecting my belongings in preparation for leaving the White House. I counted the hours until it was time to go.128\n\nWhen it came time for the trip, Coolidges father recalled, it was 30 degrees below zero in central Vermont. Always practical, John Coolidge took the opportunity to bring along a calf, which he would ship by rail to market in Boston. As the horse pulled the sled through the snow, heading south to Ludlow, father and son were alone with their thoughts. For Calvin, a new day was dawning, while John struggled to make sense of the emotions that no doubt came upon him. Finally, as the sled pulled in to Ludlow, John used humor to break the silence: Calvin, if you study hard and are a good boy maybe some time you will go to Boston too, but the calf will get there first.129 As it turned out, both calf and Calvin would reach Boston, although under vastly different sets of circumstances.\n\nB.R.A., established in 1835, was housed in a two-story red brick building that had once been a church. The Town of Ludlow owned the building, and they used the hall on the second floor for public meetings. B.R.A. consisted of three rooms located on the first floor -- an essembly room, where morning assembly was held every morning at none oclock sharp, and two recitation rooms. It was a humble setting, to say the least, although it must have appeared positively cosmopolitan to a boy used to a one-room stone schoolhouse. The builidng was replaced by a larger building in 1889, after the previous building was damaged by fire. In the interim, classes were held at the bakery hall.\n\nWhile it was not one of Vermonts prestigious prep schools, B.R.A. served an important purpose for local farmers who wanted a solid education for their children. It was essentially Ludlow High School, and the children from Ludlow and the neighboring communities took classes there. Ludlow children went free of charge, while the children of other towns were charged fees. There were about 125 students at the school, and only half of them were from Ludlow.\n\nSince there were no dormatories at B.R.A., students from away boarded with local residents. During his years in Ludlow, Calvin boarded with several individuals, including Herbert L. Moore, who was also a Plymouth boy, in Charles Parkers home. Years later, Moore reflected on that time:\n\nCal was always a student. Unlike most of us who work hard on the farm and could not get away for any long periods, he always went to school. He didnt play ball or skate, not did he hunt, swim, fish, or go in for any sports, except that he walked a great deal. When he was in the academy, he went to the public library every day, and I think he read every book in it.130\n\nSince the Academy library had only 125 volumes,131 Moore may not have been exaggerating.\n\nThe basic English course, which Calvin and eighty percent of the other students took, cost 50 cents a week. It consisted of Literature, Math, Grammar, World and American History, American Government, and several business courses. This course was intended to prepare students for the business world, or at least to make them more effective at the business of farming. Those students bound for college paid 60 cents a week to take the Classical course, which included classical studies in Greek and Latin. Still others who wanted an education that fell somehwere in between took the Latin Scientific course.132 Later Calvin estimated that his father spent about $150 per year on his room and board.133\n\nWhat separated B.R.A. for modern high schools is that attendance at B.R.A. was not mandatory. The school had three terms from September to May, with a long summer vacation in between, because the girls taught school in the summer and the boys worked on the farm. Despite the time off from school, the demands of rural life were such that many students attended the schools fall, winter, and spring terms only sporadically. Many dropped out of school entirely. Less than forty percent of students graduated, despite the schools addition of a commencement ceremony and the sales pitch it made to parents.134\n\nThere were three full-time and two part-time teachers at B.R.A. The Principal, twenty four year-old Harry Kendall, was a Ludlow native and a recent Harvard graduate. He oversaw the female teaching staff and taught the Greek and Latin courses. In addition to those duties, the young principal was also charged with keeping his students out of trouble -- a task that must have been extremely challenging when one considers that a considerable number of students were away from home for the first time. As Calvin recalled in his Autobiography:\n\nOf course our school life was not free from pranks. The property of the townspeople was moved to strange places in the night. One morning as the janitor was starting the furnace he heard a loud bray from one of the class rooms. His investigation disclosed the presence of a domestic animal notes for his long ears and discordant voice. In some way during the night he had been stabled on the second floor. As far as I deem it prudent to discuss my own connection with these escapades is to record that I was never convicted of any of them and so must be presumed innocent.135\n\nThere was a limit to the pranks, however:\n\nThose who attended the school from out of town were all there with a real purpose of improving themselves, so that while there was no lack of fun and play they all worked as best they could, for their coming had meant too much to sacrifice at home not to be taken seriously. They has come seeking to better their condition in life through what they might learn and the self-discipline they might secure.136\n\nLike most of his classmates, Calvin was a devoted student. He began school in the middle of the school year, and his first term was eventful. One reason was that it exposed him to the one subject that would change the course of his life:\n\nFor some reason I was attracted to civil government and took that. This was my first introduction to the Constitution of the United States. Although I was but thirteen years old the subject interested me exceedingly. The study of it which I then began has never ceased, and the more I study it the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and happiness to humanity. The good it has wrought can never be measured.137\n\nMeanwhile, another subject caused him neverending grief during his first term -- and beyond. Calvin dreaded Algebra, which was taught by Miss Prior, a stern women who wore her hair in a bun. Soon after his enrollment in the course he had fallen behind, and he sought help from classmates. Once he deadpanned to Henry Brown in the presence of Browns housekeeper, I thought I would come down, Henry, and help you on your algebra.138 (Brown later said that Calvin said it so solemly that [the housekeeper] asked me afterwards if I was falling behind in my algebra.139 ) Several years later he confessed that he had no use for the subject,140 although with hard work he managed to achiueve respectable marks.\n\n----------------------\n\nGoing to the Academy meant a complete break with the past and entering a new and untried field, larger and more alluring than the past, Calvin recalled in his Autobiography, among unknown scences and unknown people.141 Many of these hitherto unknown scenes were found in the town of Ludlow itself. The railorad going through town had exposed townspeople to the latest fashions trumpeted by magzines such as Harpers Bazaar: men in Ludlow dressed in coats and top hats, while women wore long organge, pink, and lilac dresses and flowered hats. Unlike Plymouth Notch, which had one country store to serve the needs of local residents, Ludlow boasted a clothing store, a jeweler, a pool hall, and a music hall. Calvin was perhaps most interested in the two drugstores, both of which had soda fountains and candy to satisfy his notorious sweet tooth.142 On the whole, as a B.R.A. advertisment said, Ludlow was exceptionally free from low places of amusement, so that the moral atmosphere is also very good.143\n\nLike many other B.R.A. students, especially those who were not from Ludlow, Calvin traveled off campus most weekends. Sometimes he walked the twelve miles home, but usually his widower father, who no doubt craved companionship, picked him up with his horse and buggy. Otherwise Calvin sayed with his Aunt Sarah Pollard, his mothers older sister, who luived three miles away in Proctorsville. She was wonderfully kind to me, Calvin recalled, and did all she could to take the place of my own mother in affection for me and good influence over me while I was at the Academy and ever after.144 While he was in Proctorsville, he worked in his uncles general store with two of his counsins, Park and Dallas, and often stayed for Sunday dinner before returning to school Monday monring. (One of Calvins favorite foods were pickles, and there was therefore some truth to the sarcastic comment attributed to Alice Roosevelt Longworth that Vice Presdient Coolidge looked as if he had been weaned on a pickle.145 )\n\nThe year 1886 began, and it was remarkable for many reasons. In Atlanta, a pharmacist combined cocaine and the kola nut to create Coca-Cola, which he described as the intellectual beverage and remperance drink146 (caffeine replaced cocaine in 1906), and the newly-formed Johnson & Johnson Company introducted the first sterile bandage. Readers celebrated as Robert Louis Stevenson published Kidnapped and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Louisa May Alcott published the wildly successful Jos Boys, a sequel to Little Women and Little Men. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in New York Harbor, and Emma Lazarus wrote a sonnet for the occassion that spoke of huddled masses yearing to breate free. On the political landscape, labor issues continued to make front-page news as riots against low-wage Chinese immigrants reverberated throughout the West. On May 5, a four-day national strike by 190,000 laborers demanding an eight-hour workday and taxes on incomes ended in terror as home-grown anarchist terorists sympathetic with the laborers exploded a round, cast-iron, dynamtie-filled bomb with a long sputtering fuse147 in Chicagos Haymarket Square, killing a police officer and wounding many others.\n\nHalf a continent away, Calvin Coolidge was finishing the spring term at Black River Academy, a place that seemed largely unaffected by national undulations. When the schools spring term ended, Calvin went back home to Plymouth to visit his father and sister and work on the family farm. He also took time to assess his progress in life while riding on the back of a horse:\n\nWe had a number of horses so that I was able to indulge my pleasure in riding. As no one else in the neighborhood cared for this diversion I had to ride alone. But a horse is much company, and riding over the fields and along the country roads by himself, where nothing interrupts his seeing and thinking, is a good occupation for a boy. The silences of Nature have a discipline all their own.148\n\nAlgebra aside, Calvin could not help but notice that he was developing into a solid student. By the time he returned to Black River Academy in September 1886, he had moved from the English course to the Latin Scientifc, and he began a study of Latin that would continue up through his sophomore year in college. At B.R.A, his Latin studies included the translation of part of Ciceros orations, which he found easy. Cicero was a favorite in part because he and Coolidge had much in common. Both men were instincitve conservatives who wished to preserve the virtues of honesty, thrift, and hard work in a society undergoing dramatic changes.\n\nThe following year Coolidge joined the small percentage of students taking the Classical course, which included the study of Greek, a language he found to be more difficult than Latin. Still, there were rewards to be had. The Classical languages, Calvin wrote later, bring into action all the faculties of observation, understanding, and reason. To become proficient in them is to become possessed of self-control and of intelligence, whihc are the foundations of all caharacter.149 In addition to the classics, he also studied rhetoric, ancient history, and some American literature. He also studied plane geometry and French.\n\nAs he began his first full year of studies at Black River Academy, Calvin became quite homesick, which was probably due to the amount of time he had spent away from school that summer with his family. He wrote to his sister Abbie during the winter term that although she could not believe it, she was would have a better time in Plymouth than you will ever have down here.150\n\nDuring the fall of 1886, Calvin worked Saturdays at the Ludlow Toy Manufacturing Company, where he did made objects such as baby carriages and trains out of wood in order to earn some extra money. As I was employed at piece work, Calvin recalled, my wages depended on my own ability. It was a good training. I was beginning to find out what existence meant.151 Regarding his earnings, he was under strict orders from father:\n\nAny money I earned he had me put in the savings bank, because he wished me to be informed of the value of money at interest. he thought money invested in that way led to a self-respecting independence that was one of the foundations of good character.152\n\nIt also seems likely that John, who arranged for him to work at the toy company, was hoping to keep his young sons mind occupied with work rather than thoughts of home. As Calvins workload at B.R.A. demanded more and more of his attention, and Calvin had less free time, he stopped working a part-time job.\n\nAll things considered, it is clear that Calvin underwent a bit of culture shock in his early days at B.R.A. More precisely, he was undergoing the shock of a country boy who has had some exposure to city life. He wanted to fit in, and he saw that he could do so by wearing a derby hat, carrying a cane, and taking the mild profanity out of his conversation. Calvin lost his temper only on rare occassions, but one of those times was when he ripped his pants on a fence. His father bought him one suit a year, which he typically wore every day until it was threadbare.153\n\nCalvin was not the center of attention at Black River Academy, but he got on well enough with his roommates and classmates. He did not have any close friends, but his peers appreciated his dry sense of humor, and he was not averse to joining in their hijinks. In March 1887, he left an unfinished letter on his desk while he was at dinner, and some other boys added lines such as I have the dearest little darling for the bext girl that you ever saw. and My roommate is the best in town.154 Another time, while Calvin was giving his appreciative roomates a demonstration of the flying trapeze act he had recently seen at the circus in Rutland, he slipped and broke his arm.155\n\nDespite his efforts, Calvin could only escape from his severe shyness for short periods of time. He was forced to settle for respect rather than love. In his letters home at this time, he reveals that he often stayed home and studied while other students went to events in town. When one considers that Coolidge has a tendency to daydream rather than study, it is likely that Calvin used studying as an excuse not to socialize with others. It seemed that when he did choose to socialize, he prefered the company of the lawyers in Ludlow and other adults to his peers at B.R.A.\n\n-------------\n\nCalvins first memory of presidential politics took place in 1888. The sitting president, former New York Governor Grover Cleveland, had been the first Democrat elected to the White House in a generation. Many Republicans called Mugwumps had bolted from their party in 1884 and voted for Cleveland, who was a ministers son. Cleveland was elected as a reformer who believed that public office is a public trust,156 and he did institute some civil service reforms through the appointment of a Civil Service Commission: twenty thousand civil servants were removed from their posts because of incomptenace.157 Corruption was so acceptable in Washington that many individuals used ads in the newspapers to announce that they would pay anyone who could help them secure a government job. The Civil Service Commission institued reforms that attempted to restrict government jobs to those who were qualified to fill them.\n\nCleveland was not interested in selling power and influence in Washington to the highest bidder. He was an ordinary man, and it is said that he even answered the telephone at the White House himself.158 His fellow Democrats, who at first thought he was a closet Republican,159 nicknamed him Grover the Good, although he admitted he may have fathered an illegitimate child in the 1870s. One historian has called him the best presdient between Lincoln and Roosevelt, a man of character and conviction and probity.160 Years later, Presdient Franklin D. Roosevelt recalled that as a boy his father took him to meet Presdient Cleveland, and Cleveland said to him, Im making a strange wish for you, little man, a wish I suppose no one wlese would make. I wish for you that you may never be President of the United States.161\n\nFor many Americans who didnt follow politics, Cleveland was better known as the only president to get married while in the White House. Friends had believed that Cleveland was a confirmed bachelor whose sister, Rose Elizabeth Cleveland, would remain the First Lady for the remainder of his presidency. According to one reporter who covered the Cleveland Administration, however, this opinion was not held by everyone:\n\nThe gossip about the President marrying springs up with every new girl to whom he pays a compliment. I doubt not that there are a score of Washington beauties who have set their craps on him. Matchmaking widows do their best ogling when they are in the Presidents company, and since he has been in the White House a full bakers dozen of ladies have been reported as sure to marry him.162\n\nIn June 1886, President Cleveland married twenty-two year-old Frances Folsom, the daughter of his deceased law partner, in a ceremony at the White House. According to observers, she had a beauty greater than that of any of the ladies of the White House still remembered by the old stagers of Washington.163 When asked why he didnt marry sooner, Cleveland would only say, Im waiting for my wife to grow up.164 Mrs. Cleveland enjoyed great popularity as First Lady: Today you will find her picture in nearly every home, wrote one reporter.165 Observers noticed that Mrs. Cleveland was responsible for reforming the gruff and distant manner her husband had displayed at the beginning of his presidency.\n\nThe election of 1888 was the first truly post-war election. The leading generals on either side of the Civil War -- Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee -- were dead, and the issue of tariffs replaced wartime loyalties as the central line of demarcation between the two national aprties. Clevelands opponent was the grandson of William Henry Harrison, the ninth presdient, and the great-grandson of a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Republican Benjamin Harrison, a senator from Indiana dubbed little Ben because he stood only five feet six inches tall, campaigned in favor of retaining the high protective tariffs for American industry that had been in place since the Civil War.\n\nCleveland wanted a reduction in the tariff not only because the Treasury had a nearly $100 million surplus, but because he believed that the tariff only served to keep prices artifically high and therefore benefitted big business to the detriment of workers. There was much truth in this latter assertion, as it turned out. Trusts such as Standard Oil Company were becoming more commonplace. A congressional inquiry in 1873 had already alerted Americans that the country is fast becoming filled with giant corporations wielding and controlling immense aggregations of money and thereby commanding great influence and power.166 The trust was a corrupt form of corporation that was designed to lobby the federal government to use its power to protect the trust against foreign and domestic competitors. It was capitalism turned on its head.\n\nIn Ludlow and across America, political compaign flags made their appearance on lawns and buildings in the summer and fall of 1888. In the solidly Republican state of Vermont, it was all but a forgone conclusion that Harrison would win the states four Electoral votes. An unofficial poll of Black River Academy students shows that they supported Harrison 70 to 19.167Nonethless, there were some sparks as election day approached. The local barbershop, which occupied the first floor of the bakery hall, was directly below the temporary home of Black River Academy. The owner of the barbershop was a Democrat, and he hung a sizable Cleveland flag in front of his shop. Some B.R.A. students felt so strongly about Harrison that they consciously walked in the street to avoid walking under the flag on their way up the stairs. Not to be outdone, on election day the barber moved the flag so that it overhung a walkway that students woud need to traverse to get to the staircase. The male students had the last laugh by hauling the female students up the steps, thereby avoiding the walkway and the flag.168\n\nThe Republicans resorted to character assassination, bribery, and outright fraud to get votes for Harrison in key swing states. Meanwhile newspapers such as the Washingon Post, a pro-Cleveland newspaper, editorialized in favor of the incumbent.169 The contest was extremely close, and it was not decided until the night after the election. Harrison lost the popular vote to Cleveland by 95,713 votes, but he won 233 Electoral College votes by carrying virtually every state outside the South.\n\nMrs. Cleveland was said to have wept when her husband lost his bid for reelection. Soon, however, she was dancing the waltz with guests at her final White House parties.170 On the day the Clevelands left Washington, she asked the doorkeeper to watch the White House until they returned in four years.171\n\nAlthough some Democrats refused to concede defeat until the following Monday, Wednesday night in Ludlow was devoted to a noisy three-hour celebration by some Republican boys. When Harrison was elected, Coolidge recalled, two nights were spent parading the streets with drums and trumpets, celebrating the victory.172 In all likelihood sixteen year-old Calvin Coolidge, who had clsely collowed the presdiential race, was probably somewhere in the crowd of revelers. Just a few days before the election, he had awoken from a dream in which Harrison had been elected.173\n\n-----------------\n\nThe following year, as the nation celebrated the one hundreth anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington, the United States welcomed the new states of Washington, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In Washington, D.C., the new Congress spent the $97 million budget surplus by giving pensions to old Union soldiers, and within three years the government was running an annual defecit of $159 million. In 1890 Ohio Congressman William McKinley wrote a bill that raised the tariffs on steel, cotton, and many other goods. Congress also passed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the Treasury to buy 4.5 million ounces of silver every month. Farmers hoped that the purchases would raise prices on agriculture and help them reduce their debts.\n\nRelations between rich and poor also became a topic of conversation for many people. Photojournliast and Dutch immigrant Jacob Riis used the newly-invented flash powder to take indoor pictures of those living in the slums, sweatshops, and opium dens of New York City, and his work led to reforms in building codes and sanitation. In his classic work How The Other Half Lives, Riis wrote, Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. I have aimed to tell the truth as I saw it. If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.174 One of Riis disciples was New York Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt, whom Riis led on eye-opening tours of the citys overcorwded and unhealthy tenament buildings.\n\nIn the West, farmers continued to fight against falling prices for their products, which were brought about by a boom in worldwide agricultural production. As Russia, England, and other nations increased their production of wheat, for example, prices plummeted. While wheat had been averaging two dollars a bushel in the immediate post-war years, 262 million bushels were added to the world supply between 1875 and 1878, pushing the price to 98 cents a bushel.175 Over one quarter of American farmers took out mortgages on their farms to keep afloat. Mary Lease of Kansas cited a statistic that 10,000 children were starving to death each year. The Populist Party was born out of this regional anguish, which moderated somewhat as a slump in worldwide production raised prices by 40 cents a bushel. In the 1890 elections, the Populists ended Republican control of Congress. When the dust had cleared, only 88 Republicans remained in the House, while the Democrats, many with Populist leanings, had 235 seats.176\n\nMeanwhile, steel baron Andrew Carnegie wrote essay in 1889 called the The Gospel of Wealth, in which he argued that the wealthy must be philanthropists who use their money for the public good. Carnegie himself gave $350 million to charity during the last eighteen years of his lfie. Over $43 million of those funds were for the construction of 2,811 public library buildings. When he was a boy, a local merchant in Pittsburg opened his personal library to Carnegie and other poor boys in the neighborhood, and Carnegie resolved to do the same for other poor boys if given the chance.177 He said, The man who dies rich dies disgraced.178 Other philanthropists such as John D. Rockefeller gave over $446 million to medical research and other civic causes.179\n\nEven as prices delined, real wages rose 100 percent for industrial workers and 70 percent for farmers between 1865 to 1890.180 Through the industry of its people, America has become the worlds richest nation. By 1890, the national wealth of the United States was over $65 billion, which was more than Great Britain and Germany combined.181 The following year, British observer James Bryce wrote, Life in America is in most ways pleasanter, easier, simpler, than in Europe; it floats in a sense of happiness like that of a radiant summer morning.182\n\nIn other news, Thomas Edison invented the kinetoscope, the first motion picture device, which he said should be used in every school as a learning device. The child will be so interested, hell run to school, boasted Edison.183 Edisons prophecy did not come to pass, but by the turn of the century millions of Americans were watching films for five cents apiece at movie theaters known as Nickelodeons, and soon Hollywood stars were born. Because George Eastman developed the portable Kodak camera the previous year, Americans would be able to take their picture.\n\n-------------------\n\nBack in Ludlow, Calvins homesickness improved once Abbie became a student at B.R.A. in September 1888. For over a year, Calvin had been lobbying his father and gradmother for her to join him in Ludlow. Do you think Abby will come down here to school this spring? he wrote to his grandmother in February 1887, Aunt Sarah thinks it would be a good plan. A few days later, he asked Abbie, When are you coming down to see about coming to the school of course you will come down some time. More insistently, he wrote to his father in January 1888:\n\nWhat do you think about Abbies coming to school here this spring? I think she had better, if you want she should commence a course here next fall....If you decide to have her come I think you can get her boarded here. Mr.s Morgan too wants some boarders.184\n\nCalvins father and grandmother (who was the childrens surrogate mother) acquiesced, and Abby became a student at Black River Academy in the fall of 1888. Thirteen years old, with red hair and a sharp mind, she flourished in her studies. Her future seemed bright, and her big brother was delighted.\n\nThen, on March 6, 1890, two months before Calvins graduation from B.R.A., the unthinkable happened:\n\nIn March of my senior year my sister Abbie died. She was three years my junior but so proficient in her studies that she was but two classes below me in school. She was ill scarcely a week. Several doctors were in attendance but could not save her. Thirty years later one of them told me he was convinced she had appendicitis, which was a disease not well understood in 1890. I went home when her condition became ciritical and staid [sic] beside her until she passed to join our mother. The memory of the charm of her presence and her dignified devotion to the right will always abide with me.185\n\nAbbie was fifteen years old. Her death followed those of other young people in Calvins circle: Meda Kavanaugh, aged fifteen; Orson Plymouth Fat Boy Butler, aged fourteen; and Lula Hall, age nineteen.186 This was little comfort to Calvin, who had already lost his mother. A month after Abbies death, her grief-stricken and melancholy big brother wrote, "
