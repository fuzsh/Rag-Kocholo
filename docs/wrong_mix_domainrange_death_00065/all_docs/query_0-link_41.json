        "text": "Origins\n\nThe Library was founded in 1800, making it the oldest federal cultural institution in the nation. On August 24, 1814, British troops burned the Capitol building (where the Library was housed) and destroyed the Library's core collection of 3,000 volumes. On January 30, 1815, Congress approved the purchase of Thomas Jefferson’s personal library of 6,487 books for $23,950.\n\nStatistics\n\nThe Library of Congress is the largest library in the world with millions of items a variety of formats. View detailed collection statistics.\n\nThe Collections\n\nEach working day the Library receives some 15,000 items and adds more than 10,000 items to its collections. Materials are acquired as Copyright deposits and through gift, purchase, other government agencies (state, local and federal), Cataloging in Publication (a pre-publication arrangement with publishers) and exchange with libraries in the United States and abroad. Items not selected for the collections or other internal purposes are used in the Library’s national and international exchange programs. Through these exchanges the Library acquires material that would not be available otherwise. The remaining items are made available to other federal agencies and are then available for donation to educational institutions, public bodies and nonprofit tax-exempt organizations in the United States.\n\nInternational Collections\n\nSince 1962, the Library of Congress has maintained offices abroad to acquire, catalog and preserve library and research materials from countries where such materials are essentially unavailable through conventional acquisitions methods. Overseas offices in New Delhi (India), Cairo (Egypt), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Jakarta (Indonesia), Nairobi (Kenya) and Islamabad (Pakistan) collectively acquire materials from more than 60 countries and acquire materials on behalf of United States libraries participating in the Cooperative Acquisitions Program.\n\nForeign Languages\n\nApproximately half of the Library’s book and serial collections are in languages other than English. The collections contain materials in some 470 languages.\n\nAfrican and Middle Eastern Materials\n\nThe Library’s African and Middle Eastern Division holds several thousand volumes in the non-Roman script languages of the region.\n\nAsian Materials\n\nThe Library's Asian Division collection holds millions of items, the largest assemblage of Chinese, Japanese and Korean materials outside of Asia, and one of the largest Tibetan collections in the world.\n\nEuropean, Iberian, Latin American and Caribbean Materials\n\nThe Library holds the largest collection of Russian-language materials in the United States and the largest outside of Russia.
