        "text": "A candid conversation with the dynamic duo of pundits about what really goes\n\non in washington, how journalists blow it and why they’d vote for trump and\n\noprah\n\nRowland Evans and Robert Novak have been around forever, like those two\n\nuncles down at the end of the dining room table who have an opinion on\n\neverything. They have wielded major clout in the Beltway-and beyond. Their\n\njointly reported and written newspaper column ran for 30 years-longer than any\n\nother joint report. At the peak of its popularity, the column appeared in 300\n\nnewspapers throughout the country. Then they showed up on TV, becoming regulars\n\non CNN, covering political campaigns and conventions and sparring on The\n\nMcLaughlin Group, Evans and Novak and their current CNN show with Al Hunt and\n\nMark Shields. Their newsletters, magazine articles, books and commentaries are\n\nubiquitous. Michael Kinsley once said, “Their column can place an item on the\n\nWashington agenda.” One column based on Novak’s 1978 interview with Deng\n\nXiaoping helped open the way for normalizing relations with China.\n\nAlthough they are both serious conservatives and aren’t shy about saying so,\n\nEvans and Novak have gone after Republicans with a fervor nearly equal to that\n\nof their attacks on Democrats. From the start, they supported Kennedy,\n\nchampioned Reagan and loathed Clinton. Their columns on the Middle East were\n\nparticularly contentious. They were called the “mother of all Israel bashers.”\n\nOther criticism came from mistakes that appeared in the columns-one critic\n\ndubbed them “Errors and No facts.”\n\nTheir politics are similar but their backgrounds are very different.\n\nNovak, 69, was born in Joliet, Illinois, where he first worked as a reporter\n\nfor the Joliet Herald-News and the Champaign-Urbana Courier while studying at\n\nthe University of Illinois. After serving as a lieutenant in the Army, he took a\n\njob as a reporter with the Associated Press in Omaha. Then he moved on to\n\nIndianapolis, covering the state legislature. In 1957 he was transferred to\n\nWashington, D.C. to cover Congress for the AP. In 1958 he became the Senate\n\ncorrespondent for the Washington bureau of The Wall Street Journal. In 1961 he\n\nbecame the Journal’s chief congressional correspondent. In reference to his\n\ncrabby demeanor, Newsweek called him the Prince of Darkness. Morton Kondracke, a\n\ncolleague on The McLaughlin Group, once described him as “the troll under the\n\nbridge of American journalism.”\n\nRowland Evans, 78, was born in White Marsh, Pennsylvania. His first job as\n\na reporter was with the Philadelphia Bulletin. He then covered Washington and\n\nthe U.S. Senate for the AP. Next, he worked the political beat for the New York\n\nHerald Tribune and traveled extensively to the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and\n\nAsia.\n\nIt was Evans’ idea to try a joint column with Novak, the first of which\n\nappeared in May 1963. “It was like having a second wife,” Evans once said of\n\nthe partnership that has survived for more than 35 years. The column ran four\n\ntimes a week, analyzing world events with plenty of scoops. It became a morning\n\nmust-read in the capital. In May 1993, when he turned 72, Evans retired from\n\nthe column, though he still writes occasionally under his own byline and appears\n\non their joint CNN show. Novak, whose energy knows no bounds, is still the\n\nco-host of Crossfire, a regular on The Capital Gang and a political analyst on\n\nInside Politics. He often shows up on Sunday morning network TV shows.\n\nEvans and Novak may be at their best in an election year, when they\n\nconsider the candidates who are running for the highest office-the perfect time\n\nto sit them down for the Playboy Interview. For the assignment we tapped David\n\nSheff, who has been conducting Playboy Interviews for 20 years (his most recent\n\nwas with Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos). Here is Sheff’s report:\n\n“I first met Evans and Novak at the Metropolitan Club, the stuffy if high-\n\ntoned meeting spot of Washington’s media and political elite. Lunchtime at the\n\nMembers Grill-necktie and jacket required-is old-boy Washington. In fact, one\n\nbalding, near-octogenarian member joked to a friend: ‘There are lots of people\n\nhere with oxygen masks.’\n\n” Evans and Novak are different in dress and personality. Evans is more\n\ncasual; Novak always wears a three-piece suit. Columnist Jack Germond once\n\nsaid, ‘If they hadn’t been partners, Rowly never would have had Bob Novak in\n\nhis house.’ Political consultant Frank Mankiewicz once described them this way:\n\n‘Rowly is your Perrier-and-lime friend.\n\nBob is your shot-and-a-beer friend.’\n\n“Throughout the interview, Evans sucked on cigarettes; Novak quit 30\n\nyears ago, even before two separate bouts of cancer. Evans, though ten years\n\nolder, excused himself from our first interview to play squash; Novak\n\nparticipates in spectator sports. Still, their affection for each other, even\n\nafter all those decades of collaboration, was evident throughout the interview;\n\nthey finished each other’s sentences, heartily teased each other\n\nand-particularly when they weren’t together-praised each other’s journalism. And\n\nthey obviously share a nearly uncontainable delight in skewering politicians.\n\nThat was made immediately clear when I began the interview by asking about the\n\ncoming presidential election.”\n\nPLAYBOY: The election is fast approaching. Do you have a favorite candidate?\n\nNOVAK: Who should go first?\n\nEVANS: Age or beauty?\n\nNOVAK: You win on both counts, Rowly. I’m older than Evans in many ways.\n\nEVANS: Bob, you are ten years younger. Don’t let him kid you.\n\nNOVAK: Fine. I’ll start. I don’t really worry about whether a candidate is\n\ngoing to do a good job as president, because most of them do such a terrible\n\njob.\n\nPLAYBOY: Then what do you look for? As journalists, do you occasionally\n\njudge candidates on whether they will be fun to cover?\n\nNOVAK: There’s an old story about when Lyndon Johnson went on a joyride at\n\nhis ranch with a young, good-looking female columnist. She batted her baby blues\n\nand said, “You are such fun, Mr. President.” Apparently she looked for fun in\n\npresidents, but I don’t. Nor do I look for someone who will do a good job.\n\nPLAYBOY: So what do you look for?\n\nNOVAK: What I look for in a president is somebody who agrees with me. It’s\n\na good model for every American.\n\nPLAYBOY: Rowland, are you as cynical as your partner?\n\nNOVAK: [Interrupting] I am not cynical. I am realistic. Rowly and I don’t\n\nagree on much, but we agree that there were only two good presidents in this\n\ncentury: Reagan and Coolidge. Why? Because they both did as little as possible.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you indeed agree with that, Rowly?\n\nEVANS: I agree, though I approach it differently. I think trying to make\n\npreelection judgments about what a president will do is an absolute waste of\n\ntime. We never know. So much depends on the unpredictable, such as who they put\n\nin important positions. Before he was president, who predicted that Reagan would\n\nbring down the Soviet Union? I didn’t. Maybe Bob did.\n\nNOVAK: Nobody could have.\n\nEVANS: Yet as a member of the political press corps, I have to admit that\n\nthere are some candidates who are more interesting than others to cover.\n\nSomebody a little doltish, who doesn’t really know how to handle himself well,\n\nis good fun. In this election, Albert Gore would be the most fun. But we are not\n\ngoing to get Gore. It is going to be George W., and I’ll say it right out loud.\n\nI find him to be an extraordinarily attractive fella. There may be a lot I\n\ndon’t know about him, though Bob and I did an interview with him for CNN last\n\nAugust. You hear that Bush doesn’t have a position on anything, but it’s untrue.\n\nHe has a lot of positions. I don’t agree with them all, but I like him. I say\n\nthat after admitting that Gore would be the most fun-as well as the worst\n\npresident. John McCain would be fun, too, but he hasn’t got a shot.\n\nPLAYBOY: Bob, do you agree about Bush?\n\nNOVAK: If W. gets to be president, one question is whether he’s going to\n\nbe much better than his father, who wasn’t a good president in my view. When\n\nGeorge Sr. succeeded Reagan, he said, “In this administration, we will be\n\nburning the midnight oil.” It was a slap at Reagan, who definitely wasn’t\n\nburning the midnight oil-he was sawing wood. When George Sr. said that, it made\n\nmy blood run cold. In my opinion, when presidents are burning the midnight oil,\n\nthe country is in trouble. We don’t want workaholics running the country. We\n\ndon’t want presidents doing much of anything, because we get into trouble when\n\nthey do. If you read the Haldeman diaries and hear the Nixon tapes, you see that\n\nNixon was way too busy. He was constantly getting involved in things he had no\n\nbusiness being involved in. He should have taken it easier. Johnson thought he\n\ncould run the whole government. If nothing else, this worries me a little bit\n\nabout George W. He thinks he can run the whole damn thing.\n\nPLAYBOY: What’s your take on the other candidates? How about Bill Bradley?\n\nEVANS: I like Bradley. But he’s hard to get a fix on, even though I spent\n\na lot of time with him when he was in the Senate.\n\nNOVAK: What do you make of some of the third-party candidates?\n\nEVANS: Indeed, there are all these fringe candidates who get taken\n\nseriously! Jesse Ventura was elected governor, which means you can’t just write\n\nthem off. Donald Trump? Who knows! I have a lot of respect for Donald Trump. We\n\ninterviewed him once.\n\nNOVAK: Remember what he said when we asked him if he would ever run for\n\npresident? He said he was too honest to run for president [laughter]. I guess he\n\nlost his honesty.\n\nEVANS: They say his running mate might be Oprah Winfrey. She is probably\n\nthe smartest of them all.\n\nNOVAK: The more I think about that ticket, the more I like it. I just\n\ncan’t imagine Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey bombing the hell out of Kosovo. I\n\ncan’t imagine that happening.\n\nEVANS: It would take them six weeks to find it on the map.\n\nNOVAK: Yes, I might vote for the Trump-Winfrey ticket.\n\nPLAYBOY: In spite of Evans’ observation that they wouldn’t know the\n\nlocation of Kosovo?\n\nNOVAK: Precisely because they wouldn’t know. I just can’t imagine that\n\nthey would try anything terribly dangerous. I can’t imagine that they would do\n\nanything as silly as remaking the map of the Balkans from the Oval Office.\n\nPLAYBOY: Because they just don’t know enough, or because they would be too\n\nafraid?\n\nNOVAK: Maybe they are too smart. Maybe they have lived in the real world\n\ntoo much, as opposed to somebody like President Clinton, who has never had a\n\nreal job, who has lived in government housing. That affects his judgment.\n\nPLAYBOY: Speaking of Clinton–\n\nEVANS: Here’s what I think of Bill Clinton: He has seriously diminished\n\nthe presidency. When you get the kind of action that he got in the Oval\n\nOffice-or right next to it-and you are talking to congressmen while you’re\n\ngetting your thrills, it cheapens the presidency. Clinton has changed a lot of\n\nopinions in this country about how important the presidency is. He is why it is\n\ndifficult to become excited about the next president. We are living in an unreal\n\ntime. We have no foreign problems of any real dimension. Sure, wars are going\n\non, but there is no Soviet Union. We have prosperity. Everybody is supposed to\n\nbe getting a little richer. So at this point I agree with my partner 100\n\npercent. I, too, would vote for Trump-Winfrey, though I would prefer it be\n\nWinfrey-Trump, if she were on the top of the ticket.\n\nPLAYBOY: What do you think of Warren Beatty, who toyed with running?\n\nEVANS: I met him during the McGovern campaign. Had dinner with him one\n\nnight. He was very hot for George McGovern. Warren is very committed, but he’s\n\nan elitist.\n\nNOVAK: And he’s too earnest. He wants to save us all-from the special\n\ninterests and from everything else. He thinks of the presidency as some kind of\n\nevangelistic office. From my reading of history, the presidency, except in times\n\nof crisis, was an administrative office. After Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow\n\nWilson, Calvin Coolidge initiated little legislation, which is a plus. The idea\n\nof a president being a grand monarch penetrating our lives goes against the\n\noriginal concept. It’s one good thing you can say about Clinton: Just think if\n\nhe spent the time on governing and dealing with Congress that he spends on\n\nfund-raising! No president has ever spent so much time raising money and so\n\nlittle time governing, and I am happy for it. It suits me fine.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you understand why Bill Clinton’s popularity remained so high\n\nthroughout the Lewinsky scandal?\n\nEVANS: Clinton is the best communicator I have ever seen. Better than\n\nKennedy, and I thought Kennedy was better than Reagan. He has a miraculous\n\ntouch.\n\nNOVAK: I don’t think that’s why. I think it’s the nation’s prosperity.\n\nThat’s what people care about.\n\nPLAYBOY: Can Clinton take credit for the strong economy?\n\nNOVAK: It’s like blaming the Johnstown flood on a leaky faucet in Altoona.\n\nThere is no cause and effect. But I’ll say one thing. If Clinton had come in and\n\nreally tried to restore prohibitive tax rates and had made government even\n\nbigger than it is-if there hadn’t been a Republican Congress that inhibited\n\nspending-the economy would not be as vigorous as it is. So I think credit for\n\nthe nation’s prosperity should go to the Congress and to the president for what\n\nthey didn’t do. Now, when voters are asked what the biggest problem facing\n\nAmerica is, most say education. That is a sign that we are in pretty good shape.\n\nEVANS: But education is a major problem. Housewives and mothers don’t take\n\ncare of their children anymore. They are worried about their second house on the\n\nlake, and that means a second income is required, so the kids get shipped out.\n\nIt’s probably the most serious crisis this country faces: the breakdown of the\n\nfamily.\n\nNOVAK: Rowly is correct. There’s a problem with families. Children go to\n\nschool unprepared forfirst grade. They don’t know their numbers, they don’t know\n\ntheir shapes. They can’t sit still. But the idea that somebody in Washington is\n\ngoing to spend more money and reduce class size and therefore solve the problem\n\nis nonsense.\n\nEVANS: TV is a huge part of the problem. Consider the number of hours most\n\nkids are allowed or encouraged to watch television because it takes the burden\n\noff the mother and father to take care of them. Twenty or thirty years ago, kids\n\nwere watching less television. When I was growing up in the Twenties and\n\nThirties, we were listening to Amos ‘n Andy.\n\nNOVAK: They had radio when you were growing up?\n\nEVANS: Just barely. The point is that kids can’t conceivably do what you\n\nand I did when we were growing up-our homework-if they are watching six, seven\n\nhours of TV a night. In my family, with five kids, we had homework rules and\n\nthey were followed.\n\nNOVAK: I have four grandchildren. The oldest is just a little over three.\n\nShe is rigorously rationed television.\n\nEVANS: How do their parents do it?\n\nNOVAK: They say, “You can’t watch!” What a novel idea! I don’t know how\n\nlong they are going to be able to keep that up, but the kids watch almost no\n\ntelevision.\n\nEVANS: That’s the kind of thing a president could do. He could talk about\n\nit, but ours doesn’t have the guts to get outand say to families, “Stop it,”\n\nbecause it might not be popular. Instead he goes around to classrooms and crawls\n\naround on his hands and knees, playing dolls with the kids for the cameras. That\n\nis supposed to be politically attractive and appealing to voters.\n\nPLAYBOY: You included Reagan as one of the two best presidents. Is that\n\nbecause of what he accomplished or what he didn’t accomplish?\n\nEVANS: Reagan’s mind was not a highly calibrated instrument, but it worked\n\nin certain situations. The few big ideas he had were huge ideas. Getting rid of\n\nthe Berlin Wall was not a small matter. I don’t think there was any subtlety in\n\nhispresidency-or in the man-but somehow it worked for him. I hate to tell this\n\nstory because it makes him look so bad, but here it is: Reagan was talking to\n\nHosni Mubarak in the Oval Office at a time when we and the Egyptians were\n\nworking together to try to round up some terrorists who were believed to be in\n\nCairo. Early in the session, Mubarak got a call from Cairo and had to leave the\n\nroom for a moment. Mubarak disappeared and, according to a guy who was there,\n\nReagan asked, “What’s his name?” All those stories about him are true.\n\nPLAYBOY: It’s not a surprise that you supported Reagan and other\n\nRepublicans, but we were surprised to note that you both voted for John Kennedy\n\nin 1960. Was that your last Democratic vote?\n\nNOVAK: I voted for LBJ in 1964.\n\nEVANS: I, too, voted for Johnson, though that was the last time I voted\n\nfor a Democrat. I certainly didn’t vote for Carter.\n\nPLAYBOY: Throughout the Lewinsky scandal, there was a lot of discussion\n\nabout the way that the press used to protect Kennedy. Was that better than now,\n\nwhen the press reports everything?\n\nEVANS: Is that better than now, when you’re expected to report every time\n\na guy reaches over and gives a pretty girl a peck on the cheek? If you don’t,\n\nyour boss says, “Hey, you’re not covering the news!” I don’t know.\n\nNOVAK: Gary Bauer is a good friend of mine. When I saw him on television,\n\naccompanied by his wife, who is a lovely woman, his two beautiful daughters and\n\nhis nice young son, who is a good athlete, denying unattributed and\n\nunsubstantiated allegations of adultery, I thought, What is going on? And George\n\nW. Bush has had 100 times more questions about whether or not he ever used\n\ncocaine than on any substantive issue.\n\nPLAYBOY: So where should the line be drawn? When is a politician’s character\n\nrelevant?\n\nEVANS: It’s relevant when the politician goes almost public with that kind\n\nof conduct. I am thinking of Bill Clinton. When you are doing things in the\n\nworking quarters of the White House-or, I should say, having things done to\n\nyou-that is in the public domain.\n\nPLAYBOY: So it matters where you have your affairs?\n\nEVANS: It certainly shows something.\n\nPLAYBOY: Should Gary Hart have been brought down for the affair he had with\n\nDonna Rice?\n\nEVANS: That’s where it all started. Before Gary Hart, sexual escapades\n\nwere not covered. Jack Kennedy had 100 women, and nobody wrote anything.\n\nPLAYBOY: Did Kennedy flaunt his affairs?\n\nEVANS: He never did with me.\n\nNOVAK: There needs to be some sense of proportion. When I saw Bauer, I\n\nknew it was out of control. That is one extreme. The other extreme is back in\n\nthe Kennedy administration. When he was president, Kennedy had an assignation\n\nwith a famous actress at the Carlyle Hotel on the way back to Hyannis Port.\n\nEverybody in the White House press corps knew. It didn’t get any press for about\n\n30 years. Was that the right way to do it? I certainly don’t condone adultery,\n\nso I don’t know.\n\nEVANS: I got whiffs of what was going on in Kennedy’s personal life all\n\nthe time. But it never occurred to me he was involving the country or somehow\n\ndeserting his duty, though you could make a case that he was because he was\n\nbreaking a law and he had sworn to uphold the law of the land.\n\nPLAYBOY: Should Bob Livingston have resigned as Speaker of the House when\n\nLarry Flynt exposed his infidelity?\n\nEVANS: I was shocked.\n\nNOVAK: I wish I knew the answer. There obviously was a huge problem\n\nbetween Bob Livingston and his wife. Does it impinge on his ability to be\n\nSpeaker of the House, particularly since it was in the past?\n\nPLAYBOY: Was Clinton’s infidelity relevant? Many Americans felt it was his\n\nand Hillary’s personal business.\n\nEVANS: The president spread malicious rumors designed and calculated to\n\ndestroy somebody’s reputation. That is a far cry from an assignation in some\n\nhotel. But it’s certainly a change that everything a person does or might have\n\ndone or didn’t do but is accused of doing is fair game- particularly with the\n\nInternet.\n\nPLAYBOY: What impact does the Internet have?\n\nEVANS: It’s big. In the old days, if you had an insight about a real\n\nscoop, the last thing you did was mention it to anybody. Maybe you would tell\n\nyour boss. Then you pursued it, and if you got it, you would write it for the\n\nnext newspaper cycle, depending on the newspaper. Today a hot item that may or\n\nmay not be true inevitably gets out and is on the Internet somewhere, like the\n\nDrudge Report. A lot of the stuff is inaccurate. Much hasn’t been checked and\n\ndouble-checked. It’s all about getting it out there no matter who is affected,\n\nwho is hurt or how accurate it is. It’s diametrically opposed to the training we\n\nhad.\n\nNOVAK: And yet there’s more babbling than ever. When I first got here the\n\nnetworks had two news shows and there were two half-hour Sunday interview shows,\n\nMeet the Press and Face the Nation. There were no talk shows. Now you have this\n\nplethora of outlets, babbling on television and radio, and less newspaper\n\nreadership than ever. And if you watch the three network news shows, you’ll see\n\nless and less serious reporting. There is instead a combination of\n\nsensationalism and expose. You can go for a week on the network news programs\n\nwithout any serious political stories. And we’re part of the problem, though not\n\na big part of the problem.\n\nPLAYBOY: How are you contributing?\n\nNOVAK: I am on Crossfire, which is vastly more serious than most of these\n\nprograms, but we’re trying to have entertainment value. It isn’t like Ed Murrow\n\nand Eric Sevareid pontificating.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is the fiery debate that characterizes Crossfire simply about\n\nmaking good television?\n\nNOVAK: Yes. We’re presenting a serious subject in a way that is\n\nentertaining.\n\nPLAYBOY: What would happen to a serious discussion of events that wasn’t so\n\nadversarial and shrill?\n\nNOVAK: I don’t think that people would watch.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is it ultimately impossible to deal seriously with issues on TV? Is\n\nthe audience’s attention span simply too short?\n\nNOVAK: On television, a minute is long. On TV you are trying to be\n\nprovocative, if not entertaining. You don’t want people to nod off.\n\nEVANS: And I think it’s going to get worse. For a while I thought we had\n\nseen so much sensationalism that it would wither. But that hasn’t happened. The\n\nproblem is that the stations have to fill 24 hours a day. Some of what they fill\n\nit with is good, but there is so much that’s dreadful.\n\nPLAYBOY: Which commentators do you respect?\n\nEVANS: Frankly, I get tired of them. My favorite television guy is Brit\n\nHume on Fox. I think Meet the Press is a wonderful show. I used to go on it all\n\nthe time. What Jim Lehrer tries to do is good, though he ought to have more\n\nvaried panels. Of the commentators, I like Bob Novak better than anybody. He’s\n\nthe best thinker on television.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you have favorites among TV commentators, Bob?\n\nNOVAK: A lot of them are annoying. I don’t think I will mention them.\n\nPLAYBOY: How about print columnists?\n\nNOVAK: I like William Safire a lot. I like Thomas Friedman on foreign\n\npolicy, though I don’t agree with him an awful lot of the time.\n\nEVANS: I read everybody. Novak, of course. Safire is great. Maureen\n\nDowd, too. I think the best column in The Washington Post is David Ignatius.\n\nPLAYBOY: How did CNN change news reporting?\n\nNOVAK: Rowland and I were with CNN from the beginning. When it arrived,\n\neveryone called it Chicken Noodle Network, and it was viewed with a lot of\n\ncontempt. Cable just wasn’t a big deal.\n\nPLAYBOY: Was it exciting to you that there would be such a thing as a news\n\nchannel?\n\nNOVAK: It was fascinating, but it was so primitive when it started out. It\n\nwas a potluck operation compared to the professional operation it is today.\n\nDuring the Gulf War, the ratings went way up and it became the standard for\n\nwatching news. It tries to cover all the news. Does it spend a vast amount of\n\ntime on something like the Columbine massacre? Yes, to the exclusion of all\n\nelse. But it spends a lot of time on serious subjects and does a lot of foreign\n\npolicy. That’s important, particularly since people aren’t reading newspapers\n\nanymore. Out of every 100 people who stop me in airports, three mention the\n\nnewspapers and 97 mention television.\n\nPLAYBOY: Is that disheartening?\n\nNOVAK: It is a fact of life. When somebody mentions my column, I feel like\n\nhugging and kissing them.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you worry about whether or not newspapers will survive?\n\nNOVAK: I worry a little bit about it. I’m 69 years old. Newspapers are\n\ngoing to outlive me, but I’m not sure by how much. Yes, I worry about it.\n\nPLAYBOY: Because of nostalgia or because of what they contribute to the\n\ndebate?\n\nNOVAK: I have sentimental feelings about them, though I think newspapers\n\nhave declined. They have become a little less substantial than they were, but\n\nthey still are important.\n\nPLAYBOY: At one point your column could put something on the agenda in\n\nWashington. Did you relish having that type of responsibility?\n\nEVANS: I wouldn’t put it that way. I think we had a slight influence. In\n\nthe Kennedy administration, Larry O’Brien, the head of the Democratic Party,\n\nwas quoted as saying, “The first thing everybody reads in Washington is Evans\n\nand Novak. ” That gave a sense that we had some influence. But I don’t think we\n\never stepped over the bounds when it came to exercising that influence. What we\n\ndid was get stories that showed the outrages in government and write them as\n\nhard as we could. The effect of that was influence. People read us and said,\n\n“You know, these guys are right,” or they said, “These guys are full of shit.”\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you think that you changed readers’ opinions?\n\nNOVAK: I get the feeling from the reactions I get in airports and the mail\n\nthat I am preaching to the converted. People who agree with me are happy. Just\n\nlike I want a president who agrees with me, they want a television head or\n\ncolumnist who agrees with them. Maybe I’ve convinced somebody somewhere, but I\n\nwouldn’t make book on it.\n\nPLAYBOY: Since JFK, you have moved steadily to the right. Why?\n\nNOVAK: The big moment was in 1976, the Republican primary in the state of\n\nMaryland, when I voted for Reagan over Ford. I couldn’t believe I was doing it.\n\nI was really turning into a right-winger. Since then I have become still more\n\nconservative.\n\nPLAYBOY: What do you think caused the transformation?\n\nNOVAK: I have much less faith in government all the time. In a speech in\n\nNew York, Governor Bush said that we shouldn’t be hostile to government. Well, I\n\nam hostile to government. I think it is very much an American tradition to be\n\nhostile to government. It’s the tradition of Tom Paine, Thomas Jefferson, James\n\nMadison and others. The right is for less government, the left for more. It’s as\n\nsimple as that. Recently, the thing that has pushed me even further to the right\n\nis five years of Republican rule of Congress, which has been miserable. These\n\nRepublicans don’t really want to downsize government. They don’t really want to\n\nderegulate. They don’t want to change anything. They just want to be sucking on\n\nthe spigot instead of the Democrats sucking on the spigot.\n\nPLAYBOY: What changed your politics, Rowland?\n\nEVANS: It started during the Johnson administration: the deep interference\n\nby government in every aspect of life. I never became a Republican, but I\n\ncertainly moved way to the center and then to the right of center. I was never\n\nas conservative as Bob, though, which is not to say I didn’t learn from him. I\n\nwas sitting in that office with him from seven in the morning until seven at\n\nnight, and a lot rubs off on you. He had something to do with shaping my\n\npolitics. Another thing that affected my thinking about politics was the whole\n\nMiddle East situation.\n\nPLAYBOY: For your views on the Middle East you’ve been accused of being\n\nanti-Semitic.\n\nNOVAK: I’ve been accused, but I have always said that if I am anti-\n\nSemitic, Abba Eban, the great Israeli leader, is anti-Semitic. We felt the same\n\nabout many issues related to Israel. Being critical of Israel isn’t being\n\nanti-Semitic.\n\nPLAYBOY: You’ve also been called “the mother of all Israel bashers.”\n\nNOVAK: There has been a lot less Israel bashing from me in the past six\n\nyears.\n\nPLAYBOY: Because?\n\nNOVAK: Because Evans left the column.\n\nPLAYBOY: So you were the Israel basher, Rowland?\n\nEVANS: Not at all. But I was critical of the concessions the U.S. has made\n\nto Israel. Over and over. Basically, the Israelis have too much clout in\n\nCongress. The Israeli lobby is too strong. Once there was a movement in the\n\nSenate to kill one of the weapon systems that was going to be sold to Saudi\n\nArabia or Jordan or Egypt. The sale was all set until the Israelis got everybody\n\nthey possibly could to stop it. Hubert Humphrey wasn’t yet vice president, and I\n\ncalled him. As a senator, he was big with the Jewish lobby. I knew him well and\n\nsaid, “Hubert, how can you do this? How can you put our country in this\n\nposition? Our policy is so transparently uneven!” He said, “Rowland, let me tell\n\nyou something. There are some things I’ll never do. One is that I will never in\n\nmy life get up on the floor of the Senate and say anything against blacks, labor\n\nor Jews.” That’s what I don’t like.\n\nPLAYBOY: Do you disagree that Israel, surrounded by Arab states, has needed\n\nU.S. support in order to survive?\n\nEVANS: It’s a complex matter. Generally, our Israel policy has caused\n\nproblems, not eased them. Here’s an example: I got to know Egyptian president\n\nNasser very well. Some considered him a terrorist, but I think he was a great\n\nleader. I went over there to do a television interview with him. At the time,\n\nthere was a big controversy about whether we could stop the Israelis from\n\nbombing Cairo. I was kept waiting four days for the interview. When it finally\n\nhappened, I went to his ornate palace, and Nasser took me into a little room and\n\nsaid, “I want to ask you something.” He said, “My country has no arms at all. We\n\nhave no artillery. We have no planes. We can’t defend against the Israelis. The\n\nreason I made you wait here four days for this interview was that I had to go to\n\nMoscow. Why did I have to go to Moscow? I had to try to buy some defensive\n\naircraft so I can protect my people from the Israelis. I wanted you to stay here\n\nfor days and watch planes flown by Israel bombing the hell out of the suburbs of\n\nCairo. I can’t stay in charge of this country and do nothing about protecting my\n\npeople. So when you go home, won’t you please tell your country that it is\n\nabsolutely essential for me to get weapons? If you won’t give me weapons, I will\n\ngo to the other major supplier.” It wasn’t that he liked the Russians. He didn’t\n\nlike Communists, but was forced into this position by our policies. That is just\n\na tiny nugget. Then, once it became known that Nasser was begging the Russians\n\nfor weapons, there was a tremendous movement in Congress against Egypt and the\n\nArabs because they were playing with the Russians. But we sent them there.\n\nPLAYBOY: How do you feel about the latest Israeli elections in which Ehud\n\nBarak won against Benjamin Netanyahu?\n\nEVANS: I like Barak. He will continue the policy of Yitzhak Rabin, and I\n\nwas very fond of Rabin. Barak wants a peace settlement. I don’t know whether\n\nNetanyahu did. I didn’t like Netanyahu.\n\nNOVAK: I was delighted by the election. I was not a Netanyahu fan, either.\n\nRabin, on the other hand, was a great statesman.\n\nPLAYBOY: Art Buchwald commented that you two were male chauvinist pigs\n\nbefore it was fashionable. Were you?\n\nEVANS: I won’t say he was wrong. He was right that we weren’t-aren’t-as\n\nmodern as some people [laughs]. We were already part of the older generation\n\nwhen the feminist movement got rolling, and we were on the edge of the male\n\nchauvinist pig thing. It didn’t bother me to be called a male chauvinist pig.\n\nSaying that mothers should raise children is torturous terrain to walk; you make\n\nenemies.\n\nPLAYBOY: What is your view on women in the military?\n\nEVANS: It bothers me. Certain jobs are fine, but I don’t think women\n\nshould carry rifles. I don’t think they should be in the front lines or in naval\n\nvessels.\n\nPLAYBOY: Exactly why?\n\nEVANS: I think the sex thing is significant. God made us that way.\n\nPLAYBOY: So women would distract male soldiers?\n\nEVANS: Yes, plus women simply aren’t as strong as men. Saying “a woman’s\n\nplace is in the home” is a terribly snide thing to say today, but I bemoan the\n\nbreakdown of the family. Somebody has to take care of the kids. In some places\n\nnow men do it. Maybe that’s what we are coming to: equal responsibility. Maybe\n\nthat’s all right. I do agree with women about equal salaries and the glass\n\nceiling and all that. I love to see women go up to the top of corporations and\n\ngo to the Senate, and I would love to see a woman go to the vice presidency or\n\npresidency. But as a general matter, I cannot say that men and women should have\n\nthe same role in life.\n\nPLAYBOY: What’s your view about gays in the military?\n\nEVANS: I am mixed on it. “Don’t ask, don’t tell” is probably as good a\n\nresolution as we are going to get. People feel strongly about it on both sides.\n\nI don’t think Bill Clinton quite grasped the issue because he never was in the\n\nservice. He was never in a platoon where you have these close relationships. I\n\nthink it has a deleterious effect on the nongay component, but I could be\n\ntotally wrong. I am sure there were gays in my unit in the Marine Corps. We\n\nnever called them that. We called them queers.\n\nPLAYBOY: On some of your views, you’re aligned not only with the right but\n\nwith the far right. How close do you feel with the far right as represented by\n\nPat Buchanan?\n\nNOVAK: I like Buchanan a lot personally. I like his views on foreign\n\npolicy. I have trouble with Pat on international economic policy-where he wants\n\nto unscramble the eggs of globalism. He resents Daimler Benz- Chrysler because\n\nhe can’t tell whether it is an American or German company. He thinks it is an\n\narrow poised at the heart of the nation’s fate. That’s reactionary, as far as\n\nI’m concerned. But I like Pat very much and I like his views on\n\nnoninterventionism. I agree with his feelings about interventionism in Kosovo\n\nand around the world-that we shouldn’t do it.\n\nEVANS: The Republican Party has changed since the days of Goldwater. I\n\nremember the convention when he was selected as the Republican candidate. That\n\nwas when the far-right element began to take over the party.\n\nNOVAK: What I remember of that convention is that I’d been up late\n\ndrinking. We used to drink a lot; Evans still does, though I don’t drink much\n\nanymore [smiles]. I had a terrible hangover. I was covering the platform\n\ncommittee hearings before the convention at the St. Francis Hotel in San\n\nFrancisco. A young Republican, who I had quoted with disdain a few months\n\nearlier, came up to me and verbally attacked me. He called me slimy, with a few\n\nother epithets thrown in. I took a swing at him and hit him. Everybody grabbed\n\nus. I really hurt my hand.\n\nEVANS: [Smiling broadly] I remember this great event.\n\nNOVAK: The thing I really didn’t want to do was get in the papers. I told\n\nRowly about it and told him to keep it quiet. The next night he was at a dinner\n\nparty I wasn’t at and, I am sure, lubricated by a little wine. He told the\n\nstory. Among the people at the party was Herb Caen, the former columnist for the\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle. It ran in the paper the next day. We had started the\n\ncolumn a little more than a year earlier, and Newsweek was about to do a big\n\npress piece to come out at the time of the convention. They were writing about\n\nus as the hottest new political column and picked up the story from Herb Caen’s\n\ncolumn. So it was broadcast everywhere, thanks to my good friend.\n\nEVANS: I don’t know if I ever until this second acknowledged my part in\n\nthat. I actually made Bob Novak a hero. I didn’t have him just taking a swing.\n\nI had him decking the guy.\n\nPLAYBOY: Which was it?\n\nNOVAK: I didn’t knock him down, but I hit him-hard.\n\nPLAYBOY: Was that the only time your words led to physical violence?\n\nNOVAK: There was one other time. It was at the Democratic midterm\n\nconvention in Kansas City in 1974. I hadn’t worked around television much and\n\nnobody knew what I looked like, so I left behind my three-piece suit and was\n\nable to sneak into a closed-door labor caucus. I was in the back, just part of\n\nthe guys. They had barely started and the door opens and in walks a tall, Waspy\n\nreporter named Chris Lydon, who was with The New York Times. He was wearing an\n\nascot. They immediately spotted him; he had his press credentials around his\n\nneck. “Get him out of here! Press!” He looked around and saw me and said, “How\n\ncome you let some press in and you don’t let others in?” They said, “There is no\n\npress in here.” He said, “Yes, there is!” and he fingered me.\n\nEVANS: Outrageous.\n\nNOVAK: So they kicked me out. I was furious. I got out of there in a rage\n\nand I took a swing at him. Chris is 6’3″.\n\nEVANS: Six foot two.\n\nNOVAK: I hit him right in the chest. I aimed for his face but I hit him in\n\nthe chest. Then people grabbed us both. There were a million reporters around.\n\nThat got on page one of The Kansas City Star the next day. So that was my second\n\nand last two-fisted encounter. I was more enraged than I had been the first\n\ntime, when the guy called me real bad names and I was a little hung over and\n\ncross. They were ten years apart and 25 years ago.\n\nPLAYBOY: How about you, Rowly? Have your words ever led to physical\n\nviolence?"
