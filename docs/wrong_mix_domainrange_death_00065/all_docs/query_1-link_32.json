        "text": "Yesterday, at 2:30 in the morning, U. S. Vice President Calvin Coolidge, 51, became U. S. president here in his family home upon learning by messenger of the death of Warren G. Harding, 57, in San Francisco the day before.\n\nRecreation of the inauguration of Calvin Coolidge\n\nHarding fell ill during his cross-country speaking tour after becoming the first president to visit Alaska. First, his illness was reported as ptomaine poisoning. Then, bronchopneumonia. Finally, stroke.\n\nThe oath of office was administered to Coolidge by the local notary public and justice of the peace—his father, Colonel John Calvin Coolidge, Sr., 78—by the light of a kerosene lamp in the family parlor. Calvin then returned to bed.\n\nToday the new president boarded a train for Washington, D. C. As his first duty, he declared that August 10th, the date of Harding’s funeral, will be a national day of mourning and prayer.\n\n*****\n\nMajor league baseball cancelled all games for today and the 10th and ordered the flags at all ballparks to be flown at half-mast.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, 64, author and spiritualist, has completed his own cross-country speaking tour and is embarking on the voyage back home to London. He is quoted in the papers as saying,\n\nAfter a period of about three days the spirit of President Harding may, if sought, advise Calvin Coolidge, the nation’s new chief executive, wisely and helpfully on the great problems confronting him.”\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the paperback series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s. Volumes I through IV, covering 1920 through 1923, are available at Thoor Ballylee in Co. Galway, Pan Yan bookstore in Tiffin, OH, and as signed copies at Riverstone Books in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, PA. They are also on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in print and e-book formats. For more information, email me at kaydee@gypsyteacher.com.\n\nThis fall I will be talking about the women of Bloomsbury and the Left Bank at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University, and about art collector John Quinn at the Tiffin-Seneca Public Library, co-sponsored by the Heidelberg University English Department, in Quinn’s hometown of Tiffin, OH.\n\nManager as Muse, about Scribner’s editor Maxwell Perkins’ relationships with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIf you want to walk with me through Bloomsbury, you can download my audio walking tour, “Such Friends”: Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nBritish author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 63, creator of the world’s most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, is pleased to be doing what he is meant to do: Lecturing an audience of Americans about the importance of spiritualism.\n\nThe Conan Doyle family departing from Victoria Station for their trip to America\n\nDoyle spent the past day constantly answering reporters’ questions about the death of George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, 56, financier of and participant in the recent excavation of the tomb of King Tutankhamun near Luxor, Egypt. Carnarvon died yesterday in the Continental Savoy Hotel in Cairo, about two weeks after shaving over a mosquito bite on his cheek that became infected. Blood poisoning combined with pneumonia and his general ill health led to his death.\n\nLord Carnarvon\n\nThe main question to Doyle has been, Was Lord Carnarvon’s death the result of a curse put on all who disturbed the tomb of the Pharaoh, dead over 3,000 years? The headlines have read, “Doyle Blames Spirits for Carnarvon Death,” “Conan-Doyle Says Spirits Killed Lord,” “Says Ghosts Did It,” and\n\nCedar Rapids (Iowa) Gazette\n\nDoyle has told reporters that the spirits of the Egyptians\n\neasily may have used these powers, occult and otherwise, to defend their graves. They always opposed digging up the mummies.”\n\nIn his lecture tonight, the first on a six-month American tour, Doyle wants to leave Egyptian curses behind him and impress the crowd with a series of “spirit photographs” he has, that show ectoplasm and floating faces. He wants to convince them that, since the Great War, mankind is searching for meaning, and religion has failed. Only spiritualism can provide the necessary comfort.\n\nDuring the lecture Conan Doyle rests his head in his hand and closes his eyes—such drama. He says he can see\n\na great church forming which will take in all sects from the Roman Catholic to the Salvation Army…which will bring religion and science together…The old Christianity is dead—dead. How else could 10 million young men have marched out to slaughter? Did any moral force stop that war? No, Christianity is dead.”\n\nThe media are already souring on Conan Doyle’s theories about the Egyptian curse. The New York Times is planning an editorial headlined, “He’s Beginning to Strain Our Patience.”\n\n“Such Friends”: 100 Years Ago… is the basis for the series, “Such Friends”: The Literary 1920s. Volumes I through III, covering 1920 through 1922 are available at Riverstone Books in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, PA. They are also on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in print and e-book formats.

Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nManager as Muse, about Scribner’s editor Maxwell Perkins’ relationships with Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe, is also available on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk in both print and e-book versions.\n\nIf you want to walk with me through Bloomsbury, you can download my audio walking tour, “Such Friends”: Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group."
