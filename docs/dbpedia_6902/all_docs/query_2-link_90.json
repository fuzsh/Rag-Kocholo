Target those businesses for employment opportunities with in-demand occupations within targeted sectors. Succeed when workers skilled in in-demand occupations are hired by healthy and hiring employers.\n\nPlease enjoy our August Newsletter. This month, we highlight a case study from WorkForce Central in Washington, which has transformed its operations, leading to improved program outcomes and stronger connections between job seekers and employers. We also feature two new use cases on two workforce programs: the Recurring Job Fair Program and the Disaster Grant Relief Program. One Workforce Board (WDB) took a more strategic approach to business recruitment for recurring job fairs. Another WDB quickly identified eligible small businesses in underserved communities impacted by historic flooding for emergency grant funds.\n\nJOB FAIRS GOAL: Employment opportunities for jobseekers.\n\nWDB NEED: Invite healthy, growing companies within priority sectors to participate at job fairs.\n\nEconoVue builds a continual recruitment pipeline of qualified local employers in their workforce area: established and new businesses that meet the target criteria of financial stability and growth requirements in priority industries.\n\nPredict actively hiring and most desirable employers within the region. Target stable companies with low risk in priority sectors that do not post job openings on big job boards and request participation at local job fairs. Succeed when participating companies find qualified candidates.\n\nWith EconoVue, workforce development boards (WDBs) can impact more job seekers and businesses in less time. Our intuitive data visualization platform, powered by Dun & Bradstreet, delivers actionable predictive insights in seconds and represents a sea change for workforce boards.\n\nLearn more about how EconoVue accelerates business engagement for workforce boards nationwide.\n\nWorkForce Central Accelerated Business Engagement and Improved Program Outcomes with EconoVue\n\nWorkForce Central, based in Pierce County, Washington, serves the second-most populous county in the state. As a vital link between job seekers and employers, WorkForce Central recognized the need for a more strategic and data-driven approach to business engagement within its workforce programs. This case study explores how EconoVue has transformed WorkForce Central’s operations, leading to improved program outcomes and stronger connections between job seekers and employers.\n\nRead more about the challenges, solution and program success in the full case study.\n\nPlease enjoy our July Newsletter. This month, we highlight fascinating lessons learned from our recent customer roundtable and ask you to share your feedback in our Mid-Year Training Survey. Our two featured use cases this month are the Goodwill Training Program and the TAA Program. While both require workforce boards to identify and target employers, one focuses on recruiting financially stable and growing employers for specialized Goodwill Training programs. The other focuses on identifying foreign-owned manufacturers with declining operations and higher risk of failure.\n\nDISASTER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM GOAL: Prioritize Post-Disaster Business Recovery Support.\n\nWDB NEED: Identify higher-risk small businesses in underserved areas impacted by the region’s catastrophic flooding to support hiring dislocated workers.\n\nIn time-critical scenarios, EconoVue enables WDBs to quickly engage disaster-impacted businesses with relief resources to aid recovery and resilience.\n\nPredict the businesses in a disaster zone with likelihood of employer and workforce instability and business disruption. Target eligible entities to offer assistance with business recovery through grant funding. Succeed when businesses normalize business operations and return to steady-state prosperity.\n\nGOODWILL TRAINING GOAL: Invest in companies needing specialized training for their workforce.\n\nWDB NEED: Find companies who could benefit from available training HVAC and CNC resources.\n\nEconoVue’s data and analysis platform enables workforce boards to precisely target and engage a focused and high-potential subset of businesses for specific training program participation.\n\nPredict the stability of the potential partners or small businesses. Target stable companies of a specific size with low risk to offer training resources. Succeed when new hires complete training and subsequent internships and become valuable employees.\n\nLOCAL AREA PLAN GOAL: Compare the “local market reality” against the broad industry and occupational growth priorities in the Statewide Plan.\n\nWDB NEED: Determine which state’s priorities were viable for the Local WDB area’s economy.\n\nEconoVue enables workforce boards to proactively research, assess, analyze, and validate strategic goals with the data realities of their local communities.\n\nPredict and understand the convergence of industry, employment, and business market shifts over time in your local workforce region. Target growth or at-risk areas as opportunities in the plan. Succeed when local area plans grow a community.\n\nTAA PROGRAM GOAL: Engage with manufacturers impacted by foreign competition.\n\nWDB NEED: Identify foreign-owned manufacturers at higher risk for off-shoring and may be eligible for the TAA Program.\n\nEconoVue enables workforce boards to identify precise business cohorts aligned with TAA workforce development programs.\n\nPredict foreign-owned businesses with an increased likelihood of workforce instability and disruption. Target eligible foreign-owned manufacturers. Workforce boards can then provide aid to workers who lose their jobs or whose hours of work and wages are reduced due to increased imports. Succeed when the workforce is trained, stabilized, or reemployed."
