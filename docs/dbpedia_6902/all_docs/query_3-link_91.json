        "text": "Barbara('s obituary\n\nIn Loving Memory of Barbara J. Harrison Robinson\n\nBarbara J. Harrison Robinson, a devoted and compassionate community leader, peacefully passed away in her home in Manhattan, New York, on May 4, 2024, at the age of 89. Born on October 7, 1934, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Barbara was the youngest of two cherished daughters of the late John Thomas (J.T.) and Francis Harrison. Her older sister, Gertie McGee, preceded her in death.\n\nBarbara's journey began in Tuscaloosa, where she excelled in local public schools before embarking on a career in healthcare. Her dedication and passion led her to Tuskegee University, where she met Blanchard. After graduating from St. Mary’s nursing school, she married Blanchard and they moved to New York. In the following decades, Barbara made significant contributions to the healthcare field, holding supervisory and management roles in nursing homes, hospitals, and drug treatment centers.\n\nBarbara's passion for healthcare extended beyond her professional life. Together with her late husband, Blanchard W. Robinson, Jr., and their son, Kevin Robinson, she established the House of Little People and House of Little People Too in New York City. This was a testament to her unwavering commitment to children's welfare. With the support of a dedicated staff, these establishments have provided a caring and safe educational environment for countless children, instilling in them important life lessons, and guiding them toward becoming responsible individuals.\n\nBarbara’s daughters, Elaine Robinson Beattie of Atlanta, and Jacqueline Robinson of New York City, also played significant roles in the family business, carrying on her legacy of care and compassion.\n\nBarbara was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Blanchard W. Robinson, Jr., and their son, Kevin Robinson. She is survived by her daughters, Elaine and Jacqueline, and her sons-in-law, Rev. Dr. Charles M. (Chuck) Beattie II and Charles Michael Smalls. She is also survived by two sisters-in-law, Henrietta F. Robinson and Mary E. Robinson, and many nieces and nephews: Celeste Robinson, Lois Robinson, Franz Michael McGee, Greg McGee, Sharon McGee, Linda Hosten, and seven great-nieces and nephews. Barbara also leaves behind numerous cousins and friends, both near and far.\n\nA wake will be held on Tuesday, May 14th, from 4 pm to 8 pm at Benta’s Funeral Home at 630 St. Nicholas Avenue, New York, New York (at 141st and St. Nicholas Avenue). A memorial mass will occur on Wednesday, May 15th, from 11 am to 12 noon at the Church of St. Thomas More at 65 E. 89th Street (between Park and Madison Avenues). A repast will follow immediately after the service. Parking is available across from the church or on 90th Street between Madison and Park. Barbara's ashes will be inurned at the National Cemetery in Long Island on Friday, May 17th, at 10 am, where she will be laid to rest with her husband, Blanchard W. Robinson.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations in Barbara's memory to a children's charity of your choice. Let us honor Barbara's life by continuing her mission of nurturing and uplifting young lives.\n\nThe Family"
