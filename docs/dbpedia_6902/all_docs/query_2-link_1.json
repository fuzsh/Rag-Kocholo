        "text": "Barbara Robinson, a children’s author whose beloved and irreverent novel “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever” describes how a church play is hijacked by a Scripture-ignorant and all-around troublesome set of six siblings, died on Tuesday at her home in Berwyn, Pa. She was 85.\n\nThe cause was cancer, said her daughter Marjorie Pinto-Leite.\n\n“The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world,” the book, published in 1972, begins. “They lied and stole and smoked cigars (even the girls) and talked dirty and hit little kids and cussed their teachers and took the name of the Lord in vain and set fire to Fred Shoemaker’s old broken-down toolhouse.”\n\nThe Herdmans make a mess of the play — why not tell Herod where the baby Jesus is? — but they also make it meaningful. They are so poor that they associate the Three Wise Men with visitors from the welfare department.\n\n“Imogene Herdman, the girl Godzilla, plays Mary in the Christmas pageant, and suddenly the audience sees what it must have been like for ‘the real Holy Family, stuck away in a barn by people who didn’t much care what happened to them,’ ” Hazel Rochman wrote in The New York Times in 1994 in a review of sequels to three popular children’s novels from 1972. “And then, in a scene so gentle it’s almost unbearable, awful old Imogene, her veil ‘crookedy,’ the baby doll slung up over her shoulder, hears ‘Silent Night,’ and she cries and cries and glimpses the mystery. No one can add to that.”\n\nMrs. Robinson adapted the novel into the screenplay for a 1983 television movie that starred Loretta Swit as the pageant’s director. But the story found a much larger and more enduring audience in her adaptation of it as a play. Since the early 1980s it has been performed at Christmastime in churches and classrooms and children’s theaters across the country.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
