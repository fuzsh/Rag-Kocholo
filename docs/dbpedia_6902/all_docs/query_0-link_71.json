His quest takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a captivating kitchen witch, Lynnette Peters, who is healing from her own wounds.\n\nA Cure for Spring Fever by Barbara Robinson\n\nSeries: Part of Jelly Beans and Spring Things\n\nPublished by The Wild Rose Press on April 22, 2024\n\nGenres: Fiction, Paranormal, Romance\n\nFormat: eBook\n\nPages: 73\n\nFor centuries, Gamekeepers have used their magical abilities to create a buffer between the creatures who dwell in the enchanted forest and the sleepy coastal town that sits in its shadow. When Gamekeeper Stan Ross’s magic begins to fail, he must find out what went wrong, then fix it before the two worlds collide. His hit or miss magic has already led to a few close calls so he journeys to the Sacred Isle searching for answers and advice.\n\nFinding a cure proves elusive—until Stan encounters a kitchen witch who captivates him body and soul. Lynnette Peters is healing from her own wounds, however, and it isn’t clear whether she’s ready to open herself to the possibility—or the peril—of love.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nExcerpt from A Cure for Spring Fever\n\nThe sun’s rays already had strength, even through the partial shade of the forest. It was only nine o’clock, but Stan could tell it was going to be one of those late spring days that felt more like early summer. The forest was alive with activity, and crowds were beginning to enter through the open gate. No cars were permitted, but the gamekeepers had a shuttle service to take people from one area to another if they preferred not to use the network of trails. He and Owen were scheduled to deliver their first performance in just a few minutes, and he noticed parents beginning to mill about the interpretive station with their little ones.\n\nThe kids seemed to enjoy the 3-D models of mystical creatures, and some were listening to videoclips, but Old Gus was the main attraction of the pregame show. At ten years old, the Basset Hound had proven himself to be an expert tracker, helping to round up stray creatures when they escaped the confines of their forest home.\n\nHe sported his trademark Ranger’s hat and green vest this morning, and a little crowd of children had already gathered around him, trying to get him to bay at them. The old boy was a real ham, and he didn’t mind singing if it earned him more treats. Stan and Owen would be giving a talk on the enchanted forest as\n\na living habitat, but Gus was the star of the show.\n\nThe presentation was off to a good start, with the kids paying as much attention as could be expected when you brought them together outdoors. Some were pulling up small pieces of grass to throw at their neighbours, others were engrossed in looking for insects and spiders, and a few were even paying attention to what he was saying.\n\n“Can anyone tell me how old the trees in enchanted forest are? Anyone?” he asked, scanning the crowd.\n\nThen he caught sight of her, and for a moment he couldn’t remember what he’d been talking about.\n\nExcerpt provided by the author/publisher for use in this post.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPurchase Link for A Cure for Spring Fever\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI love my Amazon Kindle Unlimited Subscription.
