They still set things on fire and knock the other kids black and blue.\n\nOne day the teachers ask all the students to think of compliments for their classmates, and Beth Bradley picks Imogene Herdman’s name. At first, Beth can’t think of anything good, but soon she begins to see Imogene in a new light.\n\nMaybe behind all of the outrageous pranks, there is something good about the Herdmans?"
