        "text": "December 2, 2023\n\nThe sequel to one of my favourite childhood books, when the Herdmans take over the Christmas Pageant at church and retell this most famous story.\n\nIn this book, the Herdmans remain the worst behaved family in town. What's worse is that they all attend Woodrow Wilson School. Robinson tells of the antics of this horrid family throughout a school year, from hazing to smoking cigars and even forcing children to undertake back-alley orthodontics. When the teacher sets out a year-long project of choosing a classmate and finding ways to compliment them, everyone is confused. Is there anything complimentary that can be said about any of the Herdmans? Read and find out...\n\nA lovely story that leaves me smiling, as there is nothing the Herdmans won't do.\n\nLike/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at:\n\nhttp://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nLoosely organized around the theme of Compliments for Classmates and a school year, this second book continues the exploits of the Herdmans. Beth is our narrator and ImogeneHerdman is in her class. The assignment is to think of one genuine compliment for each classmate. Then one name will be assigned to you for additional accolades. What if Beth draws Imogene? Will she be able to think of enough good things to say? Beth keeps track of the things she observes about Imogene. How Imogene is sympathetic when a little boy needs his blanket. How she figures out a way to help little Boyd get his head out of the bike rack. Perhaps there is more to this family than meets the eye. A great reminder to value those who are different from us. Perfect for fans of 'Homer Price' and 'Mercy Watson.'\n\nOctober 6, 2020\n\nNow perhaps if I did not love love love Barbara Robinson's The Best Christmas Pageant Ever so much (and how the author manages to be both entertaining and also thought-provoking, how she shows the true meaning of Christmas and that it is in fact and indeed the nefarious, the ragged and universally feared and despised Herdman children who demonstrate, who show the true meaning of Christmas and who render the church pageant so special, so wonderfully heartwarming and even heartbreaking), perhaps I would be able to actually and truly enjoy the episodic nuggets of Herdman shenanigans featured in the sequel, presented in The Best School Year Ever.\n\nBut honestly, compared to The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, The Best School Year Ever at least to and for me feels simply and for the most part tedious and dragging (is basically a litany, an episodic, not even all that narratively linked list of the Herdman children, of Ralph, Imogene, Leroy, Claude, Ollie and Gladys engaging in one prank after another). And yes, while I do indeed enjoy the episode where Imogene Herdman gives her cherished security blanket to little Howard McCluskey after Boomer Malone and others had absconded with it and do very much massively appreciate that both Alice Wendleken and her even more holier than thou and uppity, full of herself mother are from square one, from the beginning of The Best School Year Ever portrayed as by Barbara Robinson as truly the main nasties, the main villains, and indeed much much worse than the Herdman children could ever be, I just have not found The Best School Year Ever to be entertaining and interesting enough for me on a personal reading pleasure level to consider more than two stars (a high two star rating, for certain, but really, considering how wonderful The Best Christmas Pageant Ever was and is, not quite ready yet for three stars).\n\nOctober 8, 2008\n\nGrowing up, one of my favorite books was Barbara Robinson's \"The Best Christmas Pagent Ever.\" I read it at least once a year at Christmas and even convinced by parents to record the one-hour special version from television so we could watch it every year.\n\nNow, I'm older and trying to find good books for my neice and nephew. Pondering the books I read as kid, I thought of \"Best Christmas Pagent\" and went looking for it at my local library to make sure it was age-appropriate for my niece. And that's when I discovered that Robinson had written a couple of sequels to her popular story.\n\nThe first sequel is \"The Worst School Year Ever\" which is more a series of vignettes on the Herdmann family than an actual plot. The stories are all linked by the class assignment to spend all year studying your classmates and then give them a compliment or two on the last day of school. So, we get to hear about the Herdmann's trying to wash their cat at the laundromat, trying to find their way into the teacher's lounge and carrying other such hijinx as you would expect if you'd read \"Best Christmas Pagent.\"\n\nAnd while I enjoyed the stories, I found that it lacked something the first was missing. I think part of it is that Robinson is working hard to make these stories as timeless as possible, along the lines of \"Best Christmas Pagent\" and left me wondering just what era these stories were taking place. And while most of the stories are extremely funny, the thing there's not really any redeeming qualities to the Herdmann family seen here as we got with \"Last Christmas Pagent.\"\n\nFebruary 10, 2011\n\nMy favorite part of this book was when the Herdmans took the baby and put tacktoos on him and charged every one twenty five cents to see the baby. The book reminded me of people like the Herdmans because they would always ruen every thing. I wonder why the Herdmans has such horrible behavior to mess every thing up, my favorite charecters were the teachers and parents because of what the teachers would always tell the students about the teacher room. I will recomend this book to a friend because it is very funny and a just right book to enjoy. There very many parts were i was confused but the one part were i was is when everyone was wondering were the Herdmans were because no one knew until they came back. There were no words that I wasnt sure about, I think wrote this book because maybe they had someone like the Herdmans growing up were they lived. One of the problems in this book was when students were always trying to get into the teachers room but luckily it was disolved when teachers put new furniture in there and put a plant in there which made students very nurvise. After reading this book I thought that it was a great book and wished it was longer the book was only a hundred and seventeen pages. I wasnt realy dissapoined in this book at all. When I was reading this book I felt like I was in a new world because I was so amazed by the book. I would like to read other books from this aurther if they continue to be funny like this one was. I likes the ending very much because it ended telling me about the summer.I am glad i read this book because i learned a new way of writing some things. The them of this story is the Hermans messing up all the school goals and how horrible they make the town but it is way better when there not around.\n\nFebruary 5, 2015\n\nThis is another book from my son's \"battle of the books\" list that I'm reading along with him. Maybe I would've enjoyed this book as a kid, but I hated it as an adult. I could only read one chapter at a time, and then I had to take a few days break from it.\n\nI'm sure kids think the stories are hilarious, but I found them annoying. And sad--the stories are all about the Herdman family and how these kids mess everything up or just do really crazy things, most of which are not good. But these kids come from a broken family--the father left and the mother works 2 shifts in a shoe factory, so undoubtedly has no time to actually raise her kids. So the whole time I was reading the book I was annoyed--yeah, the Herdman kids did bad things, but why was no one trying to help them out?? Not the other students, the parents, or the teachers--no one!\n\nEven putting that aside, I didn't like the writing style at all. The book began with the first day of school and ended with the last day of school, but the middle didn't seem to be taking place during that same school year--it was filled with stories from the past that seemed to have no connection to each other, aside from the fact that they were talking about the horrible things that the Herman's did. It just seemed like a bunch of rambling.\n\nDefinitely not a book I ever want to read again. And I won't be reading the book that this is a sequel to, nor will I recommend this book to anyone.\n\nMay 21, 2012\n\nThis story was by Barbara Robinson and performed on playaway by Elaine Stritch. It was approximately three hours long (9 chapters). Mrs. Kemp Beth's fifth grade teacher gives an unusual assignment the first day of school. The assignment is to think of compliments for each person in the class and a few more for the person you are partnered up with. These compliments must be about personal qualities, and/or some special characteristic this person holds. They have the whole year to observe each other to find these compliments. But, in this school is the heardman family, they are bad, rude, dirty, and troblesome children. Beth is partnered up with Emmagene Heardman, and through many adventures is forced to see the good in her. This book does encourage children to find the good in all, but at the same time I feel that the book negatively portrays the heardman family all throughout the story. This story is good for 3rd through 5th grade. There is alot of characters to follow in the story. This story is realistic fiction because the story could happen and involves the school as one world and outside the school as another world...going inbetween. The story ends with the question; \"Is it harder to give compliments or recieve them?\"\n\nMarch 12, 2011\n\nI feel bad I'm only giving this 2 stars because my mom loved it and she gave it to us as a gift for Christmas. Sorry mom. I read it aloud to my children and I know they liked it more than I did. I felt the story line was discombobulated. The narrator referred to past experiences with the \"Herdman's\" so often that the story line seemed very choppy and at time to only be comprised of many short stories from the past and a few current events in the story.\n\nSo the premise of the story is that the main character/ narrator has the whole school year to think of compliments for Imogene Herdmen. But she has a hard time seeing any good qualities in her. So much of the story is comprised of her chatting with her mother, brother, and friends about all the awful things the Herdman's have done in the past, that this book reads more like a choppy composite of narrated short stories, which made it a little hard as a read-aloud book. The individual incidents themselves are entertaining, I just found the flow of the book not to be to my liking.\n\nSeptember 23, 2018\n\n#contemporaryathon book 7! I loved this one! I just love these characters and am so invested in them! It’s definitely a product of its time but it hit all the right notes for me.\n\nNovember 9, 2015\n\nI did not like the book that much because it was not adventurous.\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\nCompleted the Herdman trilogy and this is probably my favorite. We laughed, especially me!!!, so much in this book. So many relatable things as a teacher. So many just true to life happenings. And then oh this beautiful thing of finding compliments for Imogene… loved how it resolved and loved the word that best fit her. It was so great to read aloud and we had good discussions.\n\nFebruary 27, 2017\n\nFor many chapters, I didn't know where this book was going. I mean, the Herdmans are SUCH an awful family (kids included) that I thought...gee...how could this get any worse? And then we learned how to view Imogene as a different kind of character in chapter 9 - the perspective of what she does and what she says led me to believe that even in characters that appear to be one thing, they may be complicated with many different layers. Shocking in how terrible the Herman family is, I kept turning the pages, but I would not say this was a terrific book compared to some other 4th grade level books dealing with social issues.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 26, 2015\n\nMy teacher in elementary school read Barbara Robinson's The Best Christmas Pageant Ever to the class one year and we all loved it and couldn't wait each day for story time to find out what happened next. Many years later I remembered loving hearing all about the notorious Herdman kids and all their adventures. I found an old copy of it and shared it with my mom, my sister, and several friends. I did not even know Robinson had written any other Herdman stories. When I found out there were in fact two more books in this series, I had to know what other shenanigans the Herdmans had been up to! I didn't find this one to be as funny and heartwarming as The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (which could be colored by nostalgia on my part), but it has its charm, the Herdmans are still up to their old tricks and pranks, and it was a delight to catch up with these old friends again. Children will get a kick out of all the no-good the Herdmans get up to, and adults like me will smile fondly remembering old school days. I give it a 3.5.\n\nFebruary 20, 2016\n\nI am a fan of another book in this series (The Best Christmas Pageant Ever). I purchased a copy of that book for each of my students for Christmas this year. I thought I would prime them by reading this book first.\n\nLike a lot of series for children, this book was alike. The problem is just like \"A Christmas Story 2\"; the author tried to re-capture the magic by replicating the story later. This wasn't nearly as magical as the first offering. It felt forced.\n\nThe moral, as it were, wasn't a lesson. What we have here is a collection of stories about Iomgene Herdman. Each could stand on its own. There was no interplay throughout the book. Chapter 3 could have been chapter eight. Eight could have been four. It just wasn't . . . a story.\n\nThe Herdmans were there of course. But they didn't seem as nasty as they were previously. We could easily see Imogene as \"resourceful\".\n\nThis will not go on my regular reading list for the students.\n\nJuly 28, 2013\n\nI read this short, funny, episodic novel with my 12-year-old and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. Taking place over the course of their 6th grade year, the stories focus on the narrator Beth's classmate, Imogene, one of the Herdmans, who \"told lies and smoked cigars and set fire to things and hit little kids and cursed and stayed away from school whenever they wanted to and wouldn't learn anything when they were there.\" In the 6th grade, the teacher assigns \"Compliments for Classmates\" and, while Beth is assigned to Imogene, the chapters relate the shenanigans and outlawry of the Herdmans, \"one of them in each grade.\" Naturally, despite her canny scheming, Imogene eventually emerges as somewhat admirable (\"Nobody else thought of buttering Boyd's head or washing their cat at the laundromat.\"), challenging Beth to see the good in her--not a bad assignment for any class.\n\nJanuary 3, 2015\n\nThe Herdmans are the funniest family ever. I think most schools has done for of them. I thought there was only the Christma book, So I was glad to find there were more stories about these \"delightful\" children.\n\nFebruary 27, 2017\n\n- Review for, \"The Best School Year Ever,\" by Barbara Robinson.\n\nI found this book for sale at my local library, and for my quarter, this was quite a gift! This book is really a collection of past stories, and cantankerously funny events, in an attempt to make you crack a grin. I found the writing vague, but entertaining--the exact thing most kids will be looking for in a short story to break away from boredom.\n\n\"Her bubbles were so big and so thin you could see her whole face through the bubble, like looking at somebody through their own skin.\"\n\n(Page 109)\n\nHowever, if the question is to whether I'd advise kids to read this book: it'd be a no. While the story is clever, fun, and thoughtful, I found it not quite beneficial material for a developing mind. The Herdmens' get away with everything, and instead of punishment, and care, they simply are ridiculed, but allowed to continue in their destructive behaviour. The truth not presented here is that, you don't really get away with doing bad; as the Bible says, you reap what you sow. In this way, the book has no helpful meaning, but it was a fun read, with a different sort of idea--everyone has potential, and purpose, but whether they use that for good or bad is up to them. As well, it shows that it's nice to find the good in people; be resourceful, and find the best in everybody!\n\nDon't read this book for sincere thoughts, or character or story development. If you read this book, let it be to smile. I laughed quite a bit, but sadly, didn't realize till about the last page that the main character speaking was a girl.... Heads up--she is. Name's Beth. ;P\n\nSmile, Jesus loves you!\n\n~M.K.\n\n†\n\nJanuary 25, 2019\n\nWhen the children of Woodrow Wilson School participate in a 'Compliment for Classmates' project, Beth is assigned one of the school bullies - Imogene Herdman. Imogene and her siblings terrorize teachers and classmates alike - from tattooing heads to putting animals down people's backs. Beth recalls a year's worth of misadventures and accidents in order to find a compliment for Imogene - proving that there really is a little bit of good in everyone.\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\nThe plot was very confusing and hard to follow. Did not enjoy reading this to my class.\n\nJune 16, 2022\n\nI absolutely LOVED this Herdmans book! Out of all three books, this one showed how human Imogen was. When Beth described Imogen as \"resourceful\" and Imogen asked her to write down that word for her, I got so excited and was so proud of Beth for noticing some good things about one of those \"terrible\" Herdman kids. I really wish there were more of these stories; these are so great for elementary kids!\n\nJune 18, 2021\n\nSo amazingly hilarious. But seriously, the best part was the picture of Alice hooked up to a respirator! 🤣🤣\n\nAugust 26, 2014\n\nCute and funny. I read this book for a mother/daughter book club. My daughter and I both enjoyed the book but I was let down that there was no real resolution. With the dysfunction of the Herdman family, I needed to see a light at the end of the tunnel but there didn't really seem to be one which turned a funny children's book into a depressing children's book in my mind. (My nine year old daughter did not see it that way though. And since she is really the target audience, I guess that speaks volumes.)\n\nSeptember 26, 2014\n\nThis book was okay. It seemed to me that it wasn't what I was expecting. But I do think that maybe some other children think this book would be great for them. This book didn't catch my attention as other usual books do. This book is not my favorite. Even though this book may not be for me, it might be the perfect book for you. THe subject of the book was very different from what I predicted. So I hope you take the chance to read this book because it might be your favorite!\n\nFebruary 26, 2015\n\nThis book is a great sequel to The best Christmas Ever, I read the Best Christmas Ever but never this one which is why i chose it. It starts out with an assignment already written on the board telling the students that they have an entire year to find compliments for everyone and maybe a couple extra for their partner, this task seems easy enough until you are partnered with some rather troublesome students like the Herdmans.\n\nJune 19, 2014\n\nNot nearly as engaging as its predecessor, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, but still enjoyable despite the very loose plot structure, underdeveloped narrator, and slight repetition of elements. In my mind, the Herdmans are entertaining enough to overcome these slight detractions.\n\nOctober 24, 2018\n\nWe just love all the books with the Herdmen kids. These make the best read-aloud! The Christmas Pageant is still my favorite, but the next two are just as fun.\n\nThis was a read-aloud with my middle kiddos. ❤️\n\nUpdate: traditional reading of these books brings great delight.\n\nJanuary 22, 2016\n\nI definitely enjoyed this book! it has been a long time since I have read something so silly and so perfect for young readers.\n\nJanuary 30, 2016\n\nLike its partner, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, this book will make you cry from laughing so hard and from being incredibly moved by the lovely and weird little characters."
