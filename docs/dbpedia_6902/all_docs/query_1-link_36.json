        "text": "Barbara Ann Smith Robinson was born on June 3, 1930, and died at the age of 92 on February 22, 2023. Barbara grew up in Rotan, Texas, graduated from Rotan High School and from Texas Christian University. She taught 6th grade for the Fort Worth Independent School District until her marriage to Dan Robinson in December of 1956. Although she lived most of her last 75 years in Fort Worth, Texas, she never lost her love of the beautiful red dirt bluffs that rise above the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River in Fisher County.\n\nThroughout her life, she was devoted to family, focusing on providing structure, order and support for the many activities of her children and grandchildren. A lifelong learner and supporter of education, she instilled a respect for education in all of her children, encouraging them each to earn post-graduate degrees. Barbara will be remembered fondly by her many family members as both Mother and Bama, roles she embraced wholeheartedly, beginning her mothering practice at age ten with the birth of her sister. Barbara saw to the care of many of her elderly relatives and took great pains to ensure that her children and grandchildren learned family history.\n\nOne of her favorite activities was making cedar holiday boughs for all the extended family in the Rotan Cemetery, and then taking her children and grandchildren with her to place the decorations on their Fisher County ancestors’ gravesites. As Barbara walked around the cemetery, she shared stories about all the family members there, and some that she knew were buried elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of Barbara’s pragmatism and astute business management of the various innovative endeavors on which she and Dan embarked, they enjoyed 65 comfortable years together until he passed away in September of 2022. Despite her many community activities and long-term work in support of University United Methodist Church of Fort Worth, Barbara considered the family that she and Dan built to be her greatest legacy. Honoring her wishes, this tribute includes the names of her four children, twelve grandchildren, their spouses and her nine great-grandchildren.\n\nDani Day, Ed.D. and her husband Claude; Daniel Day, M.E.T.M. and his wife Cherish and their two sons, Jaxon and Max; Duncan Day, his daughters Iris and Scarlet and his son Bentley; Donovan Day.\n\nSally Elkins, R.N.; Andrew Elkins, his wife Shelby and their two children, Emma and Casey; Matthew Elkins; Robin Elkins, M.S. and his wife Rebecca; Carley Elkins, M.S.W. and Sophie Elkins.\n\nRoger Robinson, M.D. and his wife Janice; Wesley Robinson, his wife Lindsey, D.V.M. and their two children, Reid and Kate; Allison Godleski and her husband Lee; Stephanie Robinson and her husband Nick Jenkins.\n\nRobie Robinson, J.D. and his wife Tricia; Jake Robinson and his wife Ashley.\n\nBarbara is also survived by her sister, Beverly Stoeltje, Ph.D. and Beverly’s husband, Dick Bauman, Ph.D."
