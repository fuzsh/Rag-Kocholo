        "text": "June 1, 2023. If you’re interested in wildflowers in the Columbia River Gorge, there’s no better person to go on a hike with than Barbara Robinson. That’s not just because the master botanist can tell you about any native plant species you’ll encounter along the way. She’s also spent the bulk of her life preserving and protecting a unique ecosystem too many of us take for granted.\n\nProducer and writer Deborah Bloom recently accompanied Robinson on a spring hike to check out some of those wildflowers, and catch up with one of the people most responsible for making sure they’re still around each year for all of us to enjoy. —Editor"
