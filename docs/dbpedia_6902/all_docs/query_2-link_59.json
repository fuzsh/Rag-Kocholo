        "text": "“Hey! Unto you a child is born!” Meet the Herdmans—they lie, cheat, and love to give clonks on the head. They are, without a doubt, the worst kids in the history of the world. So no one is prepared when this outlaw family invades church one Sunday and decides to take over the annual Christmas pageant. None of the Herdmans has ever heard the Christmas story before. Joseph, Mary, the baby Jesus—it’s all news to them. So they’re convinced that the Wise Men should bring pizza and that the Angel of the Lord is straight out of a comic book. Everyone worries that this year’s pageant will be horrible (just like the Herdmans!), but they are sure to make it the most unusual anyone has seen and, just possibly, the best one ever. Adapted from the beloved novel of the same name, this sparkling picture-book version is perfect for younger children. They will delight in the antics of the terrible Herdmans, who surprise everyone when they capture the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nAmerica's favorite Christmas book by Barbara Robinson is now a major motion picture! This special movie tie-in edition of the beloved middle grade holiday story will feature cover art from the movie and is the perfect holiday gift. Lionsgate is releasing a live action movie version of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever on November 8, 2024, directed by Dallas Jenkins of The Chosen and featuring actors Judy Greer, Lauren Graham, Elizabeth Tabish, and Pete Holmes, coming to a theater near you! The Herdmans are the worst kids in the history of the world. They lie, steal, and swear. So no one is prepared when this outlaw family invades church one Sunday and decides to take over the annual Christmas pageant. None of the Herdmans has ever heard the Christmas story before. Their interpretation of the tale--the Wise Men are a bunch of dirty spies--has a lot of people up in arms. And their wild antics cause havoc throughout the play's production. But the actual pageant is full of surprises for everyone, starting with the Herdmans themselves, as they ultimately lead the town in finding the true meaning of Christmas. They will make this year's pageant the most unusual anyone has seen and, just possibly, the best one ever. Barbara Robinson's popular and bestselling tale of the rowdy Herdmans has been beloved and celebrated since the book's original release in 1972. Read the book again before you see the movie!"
