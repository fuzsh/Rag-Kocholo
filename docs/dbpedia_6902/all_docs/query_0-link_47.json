        "text": "About the Book\n\nReaders first met the Herdman kids, the notorious troublemakers of Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, in Barbara Robinson's hilarious novel \"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\" Now the Herdmans return in an even funnier sequel in which they start a riot at the laundromat, kidnap someone's baby brother for fun and profit, and create a diversion at the school talent show.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nBuckle up for a wild ride involving a missing gerbil, a crazy cat, and a tattooed baby that will have readers of all ages laughing!\n\nThis hilarious novel stars the Herdmans, the worst kids in the world, who made their first appearance in author Barbara Robinson's classic The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\n\nIn The Best School Year Ever, Imogene, Claude, Ralph, Leroy, Ollie, and Gladys Herdman haven't changed a bit. They still set things on fire and knock the other kids black and blue.\n\nOne day the teachers ask all the students to think of compliments for their classmates, and Beth Bradley picks Imogene Herdman's name. At first, Beth can't think of anything good, but soon she begins to see Imogene in a new light.\n\nMaybe behind all of the outrageous pranks, there is something good about the Herdmans?\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nThe Worst Kids in the History of the World!\n\nWhen anything goes wrong at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, from the hexing of Bus Six to the mysterious disappearance of the kindergarten gerbil, it's sure to have a Herdman behind it. The Herdmans are more than famous -- they're outlaws. They smoke cigars, lie, and set fire to things, and that's only when they bother to come to school!\n\nThen a school project forces the students to think of compliments for all their classmates -- including the Herdmans. Is it possible that behind their outrageous pranks there may be something good about this crazy clan after all?\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"The story features the Herdmans, the terror of their town. WhenImogene, Ralph, and Gladys muscle in on Sunday School and demandthe leading roles in the Christmas pageant, they get their way be-cause the other kids don't dare challenge them. Chaos results, as theHerdmans act out their unique version of what happened so long ago inBethlehem. And surprise-everyone agrees it was the best Christmaspageant ever. This could become a classic, known as one of the bestChristmas books ever.\" \"-- Publishers Weekly\"Wiry-tough, tender-hearted, unsentimental, and consistently funny, the book is in the classic tradition of American humour. Buy it for eight-to-twelves; but the whole family will want to read it.\"\"-- The London Sunday Times\n\n\"One of the most enjoyable children's books since The Emerald City of Oz. The book is outrageous, lively, funny and wonderful."
