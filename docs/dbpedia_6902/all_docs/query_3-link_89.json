Patterson, a retired high school biology teacher in Billerica, and Matt, a professional illustrator, have produced Freshwater Fish of the Northeast, a guidebook to more than 60 species. Matt based most of his illustrations on photographs taken of live catches he or his father made before they set the fish free.”\n\n– Boston Globe\n\nBrandeis University Press is pleased to announce the Fall 2024 catalog, for new titles.\n\nClick to download and explore our forthcoming titles!
