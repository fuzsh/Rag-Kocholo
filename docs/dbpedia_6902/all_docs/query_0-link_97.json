        "text": "What results when an artist is inspired by the landscape, has learnt from teaching young children for many years, discovered serendipity with Rosalie Gascoigne and has inherited a pile of oil paintings from her late father?\n\nThe answer is found in a unique collection of works that have a rugged immediacy, layers of history and texture like early roman tablets. Palimpsest is the name given to scratching, scraping and the patina associated with time and handling and it is the process honoured in my work.\n\nLiving on Waiheke Island off Auckland, has found me in a like minded community who celebrate resourcefulness, upcycling and authenticity, so many found materials inspire repurposing and in time will be added to my collection."
