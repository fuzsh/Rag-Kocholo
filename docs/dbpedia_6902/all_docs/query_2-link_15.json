        "text": "“The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world.” No one in Beth Bradley’s town liked them. No teacher at Woodrow Wilson School wanted them in school. Yet young and old around the world love to read about them. For the most part, Barbara Robinson achieves the tricky balance in her Best Ever chapter books between writing about kids who are not enviously awful but who are entertainingly awful. She convinces us that the Herdmans are like that blonde-haired Dennis the Menace who never sets out to maliciously hurt anyone. Moreover, while all of these kids reap tons of trouble, they never create any permanent serious damage. This doesn’t excuse the Herdmans’ actions, nor does it mean we’d want them living next door, but it does allow us to laugh at their escapades.\n\nTHE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER\n\nMy favorite story about the Herdmans remains the first: The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. It best shows off Barbara Robinson’s strengths. For example, who wouldn’t want to keep reading after its famous introduction? Only after it does Robinson takes a step back to tell us who the Herdmans are. In another sign of her craftsmanship, rather than simply telling us how bad the Herdmans are, Robinson expounds upon one of their bad acts: the burning down of an old tool house. While not making light of fires, Robinson still manages to present it from the perspective of an eleven-year-old: “It was a terrific fire—two fire engines and two police cars and all the volunteer fireman and five dozen doughnuts.” Robinson also deftly juggles seriousness with humor: The fire chief gathered the kids together to give them a little talk about the dangers of playing with matches and gasoline. Of course, the only lesson the Herdmans learned was “wherever there’s a fire there will be free doughnuts sooner or later”. Within the next few chapters, we read about several more disasters involving the Herdmans—and learn that their father disappeared when the youngest was two years old (and no one blamed him), their mother works double shifts at the shoe factory (and no one blamed her either), their home is over a garage, and they own the meanest looking cat. Finally, before The Best Christmas Pageant risks slipping into a rut of episodes, Robinson throws out this hook: “We figured that they were headed straight for hell, by way of the state penitentiary … until they got themselves mixed up with the church, and my mother, and our Christmas pageant.” Clocking in at a mere eighty pages, The Best Christmas Pageant is a quick-paced chapter book filled with quirky anecdotes that left readers clamoring for more tales about the Herdmans.\n\nMy rating? Bag it: Carry it with you. Make it a top priority to read it.\n\nHow would you rate this book?\n\nTHE BEST SCHOOL YEAR EVER\n\nTwenty years later, Barbara Robinson responded with the sequel: The Best School Year Ever. Although kids apparently like it best, I noticed more flaws. When trying to write this sequel, Robinson struggled to find a focus. Then one boy suggested she put the Herdmans in school, because after all this is where students spend most of their time. The first chapter therefore starts at Woodrow Wilson School. The chapter is a rambling one, which picks up only when Miss Kemp assigns the class to study one another. Narrator Beth Bradley, about whom we learn only snippets, sits near the infamous Imogene Herdman who thinks that mice would make a better project than people. At the end of the year, each student will draw a name from a hat and give many compliments about that person. As a teacher, this doesn’t sound like a particularly realistic project. Still, I might have bought into it if Robinson had referred to it throughout the book and not just sporadically or as a tacked-on ending. The follow-up cat in the Laundromat incident seems out of place. Again though, I might have been more forgiving if the rest of the book had felt unified. What really happens in the teachers’ lounge, the school talent show, or the compliments assignment could have provided the glue but none of them do. Then there’s my last problem with The Best School Year Ever. It’s hardest with this book for me to believe that youngest who have been kicked out of pretty much every place in town could have any redeemable qualities. Consequently, I felt as if I were reading more about the childhood of Jesse James rather than mere mischievous kids.\n\nMy rating? Leave it: Don’t even take it off the shelves. Not recommended.\n\nHow would you rate this book?\n\nTHE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER\n\nNone of these faults kept me from checking out Robinson’s subsequent sequel: The Best Halloween Ever. I’m happy to report that here Robinson once again shines. Consider the opening line: “It was the principal’s idea, but it was the Herdman’s fault, according to my mother.” In the very next paragraph, we learn the scandalous facts that the Herdmans piled eight kids into a revolving door and put live guppies on a pizza. Then, horrors upon horrors, we learn that because of the Herdmans there isn’t going to be any Halloween. Who wouldn’t want to keep reading after that introduction? Then just like in The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, Robinson backs up to give us a little more insight into these kids. For example, they own a mean-spirited cat that they need to keep on a chain, which is what most people wanted to do to the Herdmans. The junk from their garage is scattered all over their lawn, but no one complains because everyone has moved far away from them. Oh, and one day they let all the kindergarten mice out of their cage and replaced them with guinea pigs. Although there really wasn’t any last straw, by the time school had started, “so many people were so mad at the Herdmans for so many reasons you knew something was going to happen.” True enough: The mayor cancelled Halloween. To find out what happens next, you’ll have to read The Best Halloween Ever.\n\nMy rating? Read it: Borrow from your library or a friend. It’s worth your time.\n\nHow would you rate this book?\n\nRobinson is working on a new entry in this wickedly funny series. She privileged the attendees of Plum Creek Literacy Festival with a reading of a sample chapter. She also teased us by saying that it might happen at summer camp but then again maybe she should send them back to school. Robinson has already visited a summer camp and plans to return again another year for research. Can she pull together a fourth book? I echo the comment of a visitor to Allison’s Book Bag: “Oh, I would love another Herdman book!” As for those of you who have yet to discover them, what are you waiting for? Get to your library! To everyone else I ask: Which is your favorite book and why?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nDaily Teasers for The “Best Ever” Books\n\nCreator of the Herdmans Has Died\n\nRelated Articles\n\nLesson Plans for The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (brighthub.com)\n\nAfter preparing my last few round-ups, I decided they took too much time to do during my teaching year. For that reason, I had planned to limit them to vacations. However, there is also something crazily fun about reading several books in one week. And so, once again this weekend, I plan to prepare a round-up of books. I’ll review all three Best Ever books. Save the date: October 2!\n\nDaily Teaser Archives\n\n“The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world.”\n\nWho recognizes this line from a famous children’s book? The book of course is The Best Christmas Pageant Ever! Did you know that this book originated as a short story? Its author Barbara Robinson actually started out as a short story writer. Did you know since the novel’s publication The Best Christmas Pageant has also been turned into a play, a movie, and (most recently) a picture book? If you didn’t know all this, check out my write-up of Barbara Robinson and other authors whom I met this past Saturday at Plum Creek Literacy Festival.\n\nAfter typing up my notes from the festival, I started searching online for other biographical info about Barbara Robinson. Turns out, not much exists beyond the info I included in my report. So, this week, instead of author info, I’ll feature a teaser each day from Barbara Robinson’s three books about the Herdmans. For those of you who are already dedicated fans, and so are maybe familiar with the lines, did you know Barbara Robinson is working on a fourth book about the Herdmans? It might be about summer camp, but might be about school again, or…. perhaps, you should drop her a line with some suggestions.\n\n“I couldn’t understand the Herdmans. You would have thought the Christmas story came right out of the F.B. I. files, they got so involved in it–wanted a bloody end to Herod, worried about Mary having her baby in a barn, and called the Wise Men a bunch of dirty spies. And they left the first rehearsal arguing about whether Joseph should have set fire to the inn, or just chased the innkeeper into the next country.”\n\nThe above quote is from The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. Having discovered it during my childhood (the book was first published in 1972), I reread it yesterday for the umpteenth time. Clocking in at eighty pages, it was a quick read. The Herdmans make an unusual holy family!\n\n“…. they got thrown out of the new Laundromat the very day it opened. They planned to wash their cat in one of the machines, but they didn’t know it would cost money, so they just dropped him in and went off to locate some quarters.” Of course, the cat didn’t like it in the washing machine, and it made so much noise hissing and spitting and scratching that the manager went in to see what was wrong.”\n\nThe above quote is from The Best School Year Ever. According to Barbara Robinson, she struggled most with writing this book but it’s probably also the most-loved by students. Incidentally, when she thought up the idea of having the Herdmans throw a cat into the washing machine at the laundromat, adults thought it would be a bad example but kids knew that only the Herdmans would do such a dastardly deed.\n\n“So there really wasn’t any last straw, but by the time school finally started, so many people were mad at the Herdmans for so many reasons you knew something was going to happen. ‘It’s got to stop!’ the mayor said … but nobody knew that ‘it’ was going to be Halloween.”\n\nThe above quote is from The Best Halloween Ever. The mayor has decided to cancel Halloween. Can you imagine a year without one of our special occasions such as Valentine’s, Easter, Thanksgiving, Halloween, or Christmas? Can you imagine a family so terrible that you’d rather give up one of those holidays than have them around? The principal of Woodrow Wilson decides to hold Halloween at school, but with parents and without treats. How will the students have any fun? How do they end up having the best Halloween?\n\nThis weekend, I’ll review all three Best Ever books by Barbara Robinson. Save the date: October 2!\n\nRelated Posts\n\nThe “Best Ever” Books by Barbara Robinson\n\nCreator of the Herdmans Has Died\n\nAs an aspiring author, my favorite event to attend is the Plum Creek Children’s Literacy Festival at Concordia University in Seward, Nebraska. From the moment one walks in the door and receives their registration packet to the moment one drops off the event survey and walks out the door, the air buzzes with children’s literature. I attend the Adult Professional Conference Day on Saturday when, for forty dollars, I can learn from and be inspired by authors and professional literacy speakers.\n\nI arrived at seven fifty in the morning. The doors had been open for only twenty minutes, but already attendees were amassing. My eyes scanned the author tables. This year I had bought some books prior to the festival, knowing I would want them signed. I set off to find Eileen Christelow and Barbara Robinson. The lines grew longer and longer, the hour grew later and later. Limits were imposed on the number of books we could have signed, and numbers were handed out to those who would have to return to the lines after lunch.\n\nBathrooms filled up, attendees grabbed last-minute refreshments, and doors swung outward. By eight forty-five, we were heading to other buildings where we would hear forty-five minute presentations delivered by our chosen speakers. I headed first to Grace Lin because she is a multicultural author. Then I checked out DyAnne DiSilvo who writes community service books but also wrote a chapter book for reluctant and struggling writers. Last, I dropped in on Barbara Robinson whom I grew up hearing about because she wrote The Best Christmas Pageant Ever and two sequels.\n\nGRACE LIN\n\nLooking young and nervous, Grace Lin studied her notes. At nine o’clock she began to share the account of her long conflict with her Asian heritage. She grew up in upstate New York, the only Asian in her school. In her attempts to fit in, she tried to forget that she was Asian. She succeeded so well that once she glanced in a store window and thought “there’s an Asian girl!” before realizing that the Asian girl was her.\n\nWhile Lin grew up loving books, none included Asian characters except The Five Chinese brothers. One day when the librarian took this book out to read, Lin’s classmates all turned Lin’s way and exclaimed, “They’re Chinese like Lin!” Lin felt embarrassed. She was more like her classmates than those five Chinese brothers. After all, she ate at the same restaurants and shopped at the same stores.\n\nLin loved writing as much as reading, and saw every school assignment as an opportunity to write and illustrate another book. A teacher noticed her passion and told her about a writing contest. Drawing on her love of European fairy tales and fantasies about royalty, Lin created a book that won fourth place and earned her $1000. (First place went to none other than Dav Pilkey, who would go on to write the Captain Underpants series.)\n\nOn the heels of this success, Lin decided to pursue an art degree at Rhode Island, through which she improved her illustration skills. During a year of studies in Rome, Lin began to feel strange. Everyone loved their rich culture while she knew nothing about her Asian heritage. Lin began to draw pictures of an Asian girl in these European places but this still didn’t feel right. Lin made a decision. She wasn’t going to be a great European artist. Moreover, her reasons for drawing were all wrong. She desired recognition, when instead she should be drawing for herself and to share.\n\nAs you can see, Lin kept struggling with identity. Lin tried to figure out what to do next. She wondered about what she would want to do if she knew she was going to die. She realized she would more than anything want to spend time with her family. And so she drew a family portrait. It didn’t follow the classical style, but it was uniquely her work.\n\nAfter college, Lin submitted her portfolio to various editors. Eventually one expressed interest in her drawings but wondered if she had a story to go along with them. Lin declared, “Yes!” But in reality she did not. Drawing on her Asian background, the Ugly Vegetables was born and became her first published book. For her next book, the editor wished her to change the main character to a boy and to a Caucasian. Otherwise, Lin would be labeled as multicultural and would find her career choices restricted. Around this time Lin accepted a contract offer from Random House for another Asian book, sealing her fate as a multicultural author . Soon other aspiring artists were praising her for using her culture to get her foot in the door. Lin felt as if in a “double jeopardy”; was it a blessing or curse to be a multicultural author?\n\nAgain Lin pulled back from her Asian culture. She began creating animal stories to avoid culture altogether. The funny thing is that her audience preferred her multicultural books, and so Lin once again evaluated her priorities. She decided that she wanted to explore her culture through her art, and also to help others like her to become comfortable with their race. Lin began writing books for older readers based on her childhood and similar experiences that had been shared with her over the years. Her latest book, Where the Moon Meets the Mountain, draws heavily on Asian folklore. Rather than further typecasting Lin as a multicultural author, it has gained her more attention by landing on the New York Best Seller list and garnering the Newbery Honor. Best of all, the audience for it is mixed, meaning Lin is now being recognized as an author in her own right.\n\nDYANNE DISAVLO\n\nI next attended Dyanne DiSalvo’s presentation, which was focused on her successful community-themed books. City Green appears in grade-school readers across the country. What more could an author ask for?\n\nHelping out has always been a passion for DiSalvo. Even as a child, she helped out in the neighborhood soup kitchen. And after a boy died of muscular dystrophy, Disalvo and her friends started an annual town carnival to raise money to find a cure.\n\nAlthough she also grew up loving to draw, DiSalvo didn’t initially consider a career in art. She thought books were “born” in libraries. Moreover, all the women she knew were either moms or nuns. When a librarian told her that books were created, DiSalvo knew she wanted to be an artist. DiSalvo did what all aspiring artists do: she took classes, submitted her portfolio to editors, and watched for ideas.\n\nDiSavlo didn’t set out to write community books, but to share stories of her neighborhood. The first story she told was about Uncle Willie and the Soup Kitchen. Workers told her she couldn’t because the story would be too sad. DiSalvo persisted, wanting to share the stories of those helped by the soup kitchen. For example, there were the owners of a family store regularly gave food to the soup kitchen. One day they had to close down because they didn’t have insurance. Next thing DiSalvo knew, these people were in the soup kitchen line. She also told of another man who carried around his paintings that he made from discarded nail polish.\n\nAnother story DiSalvo wrote was about a local apartment complex that was torn down because the landlord continued to refuse to maintain it and so it eventually became unsafe. As she talked about City Green, DiSalvo offered tips to aspiring authors and artists. For example, writers are always in training and so should carry a pen around with them everywhere. If they consciously carry a pen with them they’ll consciously think of ideas. This is important because, after all, every story starts with an idea. Characters are also all around. Authors should make an effort to search for names too. Once DiSalvo heard a man tell a boy, “Your head is like a hammer.” This inspired the name of Hammerhead. Once authors start to write the y need to think about what will pull readers into their story. DiSalvo thought about starting City Green with a picture of a wrecking ball, because it would entice even boys to read it. In talks with her editor she realized that because the story focused on people it should instead show the community who would be affected by the destruction of the building. Authors also need to “show, don’t tell.” For example, she never outright says that one of the characters is pregnant, but does use the pregnancy to show the passage of time in City Green. Finally the book was almost ready for printing but still needed a title. DiSalvo had been calling it “The Lot” but her editor didn’t like that name. After compiling a list of variations, a friend gave her the name City Green. Around the same time City Green was published, city gardens were becoming popular. And so City Green became part of a wave, which helped it sell.\n\nDespite its success, DeSalvo has experienced her share of rejections. She brought a stack of letters to prove her point and declared, “It’s an artist’s job to be be rejected.” Then she thanked everyone who has ever given up, for it makes it easier for her to succeed. At the same time, she encouraged aspiring writers and artists to buy a binder with sparkles and smiles for all those rejection letters. Then just persist; it’s not about ego but the art: one of the these days success will come.\n\nAlthough DiSalvo focused her presentation around her community books, my interest lay in her chapter book for reluctant struggling writers: The Sloppy Copy Slip-up. During question time, I asked how she came up with the idea for the book. Well, a lot of readers had been asking her when she would write a chapter book. Moreover, DiSalvo has worked directly with students in writing workshops, where kids frequently complain, “I don’t know what to write!” DiSalvo likes that teachers can use The Sloppy Copy Slip-Up to encourage students. In the process of reading the book, students can also learn tons about how to write. To reluctant struggling writers DiSalvo repeats her advice to always carry a pen and to write down what their senses tell them.\n\nBARBARA ROBINSON\n\nWhile part of the fun of Plum Creek Literacy Festival is discovering new authors such as Lin and DiSalvo, it’s also fun to meet beloved authors such as Barbara Robinson. The more autobiographical stories I hear about authors, the more I realize how different they are despite their common bond. Barbara Robinson is no exception.\n\nRobinson started out as a short story writer. After about five years of submissions, she sold her first story. Some of her sales were to McCalls, whose editor one day called to ask Robinson if she had any Christmas stories. For inspiration, Robinson pulled out Christmas books and music. For the only time in her life the first sentence to a story popped into her head. Readers familiar with The Best Christmas Pageant Ever will all recognize this famous line: “The Herdmans were absolutely the worst kids in the history of the world.” A year after the story’s publication readers began requesting a reprint and a longer version.\n\nThe novel-length version stayed around long enough for parents, teachers, and even ministers to discover it. Schools and theaters began inquiring if there was a play. Robinson knew a little about theater and so gladly turned it into play. Next, she was asked to write it as a script for a producer who wished to turn The Best Christmas Pageant Ever into a movie. She felt less comfortable in this territory, but the producer told her that he always asked children’s book authors to write the script to help ensure the movie maintained the spirit of the book. So Robinson did. And she even learned from the experience. Now when she finds herself stuck, she will imagine the next episode as a scene in a movie. To introduce younger readers to The Best Christmas Pageant Ever, Robinson has written a picture book version that will hit bookstore shelves in about a week.\n\nDue to the popularity of the original book, naturally readers demanded a sequel. Robinson tried to comply but found it tough. She didn’t want to disappoint her fans. For months she recorded ideas on index cards. Then upon a return visit to school one boy asked, “When are you going to finish it?” Robinson admitted she had a problem. She had all these funny ideas but nothing to tie them together. The boy told her, “You need them to be in school, because that’s our job.” This gave Robinson the inspiration she needed to pull the sequel together. The Best School Year Ever won the Nebraska Golden Sower award and is perhaps even more popular among kids than her first book. I look forward to reading it!\n\nAs noon approached, authors began to wrap up their presentations. Those attendees who had paid an extra ten dollars for the luncheon headed towards the large dining room in the back in the main building. Sandwiches and cupcakes awaited us at our tables. I selected an empty table but others soon joined me. We chatted about authors, teaching experiences, and our own writing desires. Then the guest speakers for the luncheon took the podium. One of them was Barbara Robinson, who treated us to a reading from her newest book about the Herdmans. She plans to set it at summer camp and has already visited ones for ideas. As the applause died for her presentation, so did the festival activities. A few people hung around to buy more books or meet more authors, but by three-thirty most of us were headed back out to the routine outside world.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nPlum Creek Literacy Festival, 2010\n\nPlum Creek Literacy Festival, 2012\n\nPlum Creek Literacy Festival, 2013"
