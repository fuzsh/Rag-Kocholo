        "text": "Adjust Text Size: A+ A-\n\nROBINSON: Barbara Goodwin Robinson of Brandon, Manitoba died peacefully at the Brandon Regional Health Centre on Wednesday, June 20, 2012 at the age of 93. Barbara was predeceased by her husband Beverley and her sister Marian. She leaves her devoted family: son, John and daughter-in-law, Marion and grandsons Alex (Eva) and Tim (Kayla), her son Alan, and her son Dale and daughter-in-law, Joan and granddaughters Holly and Krista. Those who knew her will know that Barbara was a humble person who loved the out-of-doors and had a devotion to learning about the animals, birds and plants of the area. She was a self taught authority and shared this knowledge as the curator of the B. J. Hales Museum during part of the time when it was located at Brandon University and she participated as a contributing author to the book, A Birders Guide to Southwestern Manitoba. As a member of the local Friends of the Bluebirds she cared for an extensive line of nest boxes, kept records of their use and travelled to many annual meetings. In September of 1987 she was presented an award for Outstanding Contributions to the North American Bluebird Society. She actively participated in the Brandon Naturalist Society, was one of the first to take part in local bird counts and faithfully volunteered at the Brandon Humane Society. She lived a busy independent life into her nineties, only reluctantly leaving her many pursuits, her bluebird line near the Criddle-Van historical homestead and her friends at Seniors 4 Seniors, Stitch and Chat, as her health failed. Barbaras family would like to thank Dr. Hechler of Rosser Medical, the Home Care team from the Brandon RHA, visitors from the Westman Hospice Association and the many family and friends who helped her, in so many thoughtful ways, to stay in her home during the last two years. Having worked at Fairview Home herself, Barbara learned the significance of thoughtful care for those in their final years, and she fully appreciated the thoughtful care she received as she remained in her own home, enjoying the birds who visited her yard. Thanks are extended as well to the Activity Coordinators and to those on floor three of the Assibinboine Centre who helped make Barbaras last four months as comfortable as possible. Special thanks are reserved for Sharon, who helped Barbara stay connected to those things she continued to find enjoyable and who remained a treasured companion to Barbaras last day. At Barbaras request no service will be held. Those wishing to remember Barbara may send donations to the Brandon Humane Society, Seniors 4 Seniors or a charity of their choice.\n\nAs published in Brandon Sun on Jun 30, 2012"
