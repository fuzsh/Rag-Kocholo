        "text": "How the Hamilton2030 Commonwealth Games bid inspired Community Regeneration. Things are quiet now. Everything is in transition. Doubts and questions remain, about, well, everything. But something notable happened today in the City Of Hamilton. The start of something significant. While the dream of bringing the 2030 Commonwealth Games home for its centenary may be in abeyance, the vision of a movement of community stakeholders united around the goal of transformation and regeneration remains. And has witnessed new life today in the launch of an initiative inspired by the Commonwealth Sporting movement. Not surprisingly, it is called: \"The Commons\". The Commons is an initiative of local stakeholders redeveloping the city's key entertainment assets - those that would be central to any Commonwealth Games - and leveraging the effort to promote regeneration and revitalization throughout the community. The themes, values and ambitions of the Gaming movement have now manifest in the private sector's resolve to bring change directly and immediately to this city through infrastructure and compelling new programming - at its expense. This is what the Games movement can and has inspired. Whether or not the Games ever come back here. That flame burns brightly in all of us. And will not extinguish. Whether you are from Hamilton or not, we invite you to keep the Games dream alive by engaging and following the Commons initiative at the link below.
