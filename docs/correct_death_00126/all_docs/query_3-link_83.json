She did some time for it, then wrote the book.

He was really born in Hobart, Tasmania, an Australian state.\n\nDid you see the photo of Flynn on his yacht with the Randall Made knife? RBScrim posted it here a few weeks ago?\n\nI didnt know that (the book and jail thing) about the last girl he was with or her mother, but did know of their relationship. He was 50 when he died and the girl was with him where he was somewhere in Canada.\n\nIve had and read his autobio--but been over 20 years since. Did you know that early on-he wrote at least two books--one called: Beams End.\n\nSean was his Son, he acted some, but not much. Later on he became some sort of Army? or War Correspondent and was sent to Nam. He and a friend disappeared when out riding a motorcycle--somewhere in Nam. According to Luke Flynn, they were most likely captured by some NVA or Khmer Rouge types, killed and their bodies later found. Up till I read what Luke said, I never knew their bodies were ever found.\n\nErrol's Daughter, (I cant remember her name?) lived in Jamaica with Wymore-who basically disowned her because she became a major drug abuser-kicked her off their 2,000 acre estate/ranch, and she was found dead of a drug overdose and in poverty some several years ago. This gal apparently slept around with anyone who could supply her with illegal drugs.\n\nSean Flynn looked like a young carbon copy of his dad.\n\nI saw posted on youtube or somewhere--Errol's last movie: Cuban Rebel Girls--which was a sad shame that thats what ended up being his last movie. It was a piece of garbage and he really looked about 25 years older than his actual age.\n\nAccording to Luke Flynn, he met Patrice when he filmed the Western: Rocky Mountain--which is a Civil War western) as she was a female lead in it. Also, she was the female in a Coach in the last couple of scenes of: Don Juan. I dont know the exact dates they were together the but--at least 8-9m years. I think they separated late 1958??\n\nI recently found a press photo telling of Flynns funeral - which I think was in Oct 59? and showed Patrice in the photo. I forgot to buy it so dont know if sold or not? If not, im buying it.\n\nI dont recall seeing the knife, but ill bet if he was in a photo and on a boat--that he was on the Siccorro.\n\nLast edited by the ringo kid; 03-25-2014 at 12:54 AM."
