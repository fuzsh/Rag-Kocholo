        "text": "Swashbuckling actor Errol Flynn was known for his movies “Captain Blood,” “The Adventures of Robin Hood,” “The Sea Hawk,” and others.\n\nIn 20-some films in the late 1930s and ‘40s, the Australian-born movie star portrayed the swaggering adventurer, the handsome daredevil and the romantic leading man who triggered a run on smelling salts at the big screen.\n\nOne of his favorite movies, however, was not among the aforementioned films. It was shot, in part, in Coronado and its title might befuddle even Ken Jennings on Jeopardy! It wasn’t the 1941 action hero flick, “Dive Bomber,” shot on location in North Island with Fred MacMurray.\n\nIt was a little known nonfiction film, “Cruise of the Zaca,” a real-life adventure in marine biology. Although completed in 1947 by Warner Brothers, it wasn’t released until 1952 and seldom has been shown since, although it now is available online.\n\nThe film screens at 10:30 a.m. today at the Coronado Island Film Festival in the Sacred Heart Church’s parish hall theater.\n\nZaca was the name of Flynn’s beloved 118-foot schooner built in 1930. Glorietta Bay and the Hotel del Coronado often served as the actor’s home away from his Hollywood estate. He and his dog, Arno, were regulars in the lobby and bar of The Hotel Del (until Arno was banned, however, for his bathroom humor, if you get the gist).\n\nThese real-life adventure stories, and many more, are stored in the mental reelhouse of Tim Reid, a baseball historian by vocation and an Errol Flynn historian by avocation. Reid is in town today to talk about the making of the film, as is film historian Leonard Maltin and the movie star’s daughter, Rory Flynn. She actually had a small role in the film — very small. She was in the womb of her pregnant mother, Nora, who traveled on one leg of the adventure.\n\n“Flynn’s personal life was more fascinating than his Hollywood career,” Reid syas. “He was a swashbuckler in real life, the ultimate adventurer.” Reid describes the heartthrob as a great athlete, a world-class tennis player who actually qualified to play doubles in the U.S. Nationals, an experienced sailor, swimmer and diver. He also was a voracious reader and a writer. He authored two novels and two memoirs, including his autobiography, “My Wicked, Wicked Ways.”\n\nFlynn’s father was Australian biology professor, Theodore Flynn. The actor loved to accompany his dad on research trips in Tasmania and elsewhere in the world. So it was only natural in the mid-’40s that Flynn got his dad together with Carl Hubbs, a marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.\n\nThe nonfiction “Cruise of the Zaca,” starts with a helicopter view of migrating gray whales off the coast of San Diego (during which jokester Flynn, leaning out for a better camera angle, falls into the drink, camera and all).\n\nThe research party, including Hubbs and his marine biologist wife, Laura Hubbs, left from the Broadway pier in San Diego on Aug. 13, 1946 and sailed down the coast of Baja California. They stopped at islands, lagoons and tide pools to observe sea lion colonies, elephant seals and to record and collect rare sea life specimens endemic to these waters.\n\nMarine biologist Frederick Aldrich wrote that the Zaca researchers found some new and unusual species, including herrings of the genus Gibbsonia. In honor of the movie, the discoveries were named: “Gibbsonia Errolae” “Gibbsonia Zacae” and “Gibbsonia Norae” (for Flynn’s wife).\n\nDuring their ocean adventure, the captain’s assistant accidentally harpooned his foot and needed treatment, so the Zaca shifted course to Acapulco to get medical aid, Reid said.\n\nThey arrived while Orson Welles was filming “The Lady from Shanghai” starring Rita Hayworth. Welles asked to rent the Zaca for some sea scenes. Because of his Warner Brothers contract, Flynn was forbidden from appearing in other productions but was involved behind the scenes and actually made a cameo film appearance.\n\nThe Zaca resumed its voyage through the Panama Canal, where movie footage was banned in the interest of national security. On the other side, the ship encountered hurricane winds and ended up docking in Jamaica.\n\nFlynn was so bewitched by the island paradise that he later lived there for several years. His parties and womanizing became legendary among the islanders.\n\nHe owned the Zaca until he died in 1959. The schooner now is berthed in Monaco and still sails.\n\nReel adventures: The Coronado film festival concludes tomorrow evening with its traditional screening of “Some Like It Hot,” the 1959 romantic romp starring Marilyn Monroe that was filmed, in part, at the Hotel Del.\n\nIt was produced by the Mirisch brothers’ film company that created many other classics, including “West Side Story,” “The Great Escape,” “The Pink Panther” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”\n\nThis year, Hollywood publicist and former San Diegan David Mirisch, a member of the legendary film family, joins the festival with his own feature documentary: “David Mirisch, The Man Behind the Golden Stars.”\n\nIn true publicist fashion, Mirisch is bringing a group of Hollywood-linked VIPs to tomorrow’s 1:30 p.m. screening of his film exploring the Golden Age of Hollywood and what it took, and still takes, to create a star."
