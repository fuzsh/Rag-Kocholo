        "text": "Allegedly haunted: Mulholland Farm formerly located at 3100 Torreyson Place, Los Angeles, CA, 90046 In 1941, Errol Flynn, near the peak of his film career and at the end of his marriage to Lili Damita, purchased 11.5 acres off of Mulholland Drive and designed a bright and airy ranch-style Colonial house with a swimming pool, tennis court, barn, and separate casino. Dubbed “Mulholland Farm,” Flynn used the house as a hideaway during his darker moods and as a party house when he felt he needed to entertain, which was often. Following his divorce from Damita (together they had one child), Flynn used Mulholland Farm as a bachelor pad and it became a legendary place for fun, games and naughty hi-jinx. However, not everyone who attended his parties knew that bad boy Flynn had hired Warner Bros. craftspeople to build secrets within the home. In Errol Flynn Slept Here, co-author Michael Mazzone writes: “[Flynn] built secret passageways into the place. One of them led to a small space where he could look into the ladies’ bathroom through a two-way mirror. When he added on to the house, he included another two-way mirror that looked down on a huge bed. He’d tell leading ladies, ‘Oh, go on into that room and change into your bathing suit,’ then run upstairs and spy on them. Flynn and his mirrors were the talk of Hollywood.” In its early years, Mulholland Farm provided the setting for another popular Hollywood story. In May of 1942, when John Barrymore died, director Raoul Walsh and other Flynn cronies allegedly stole Barrymore’s body from the Pierce Brothers Mortuary, sneaked it into Mulholland Farm and propped Barrymore, with drink in hand, into a sitting position in Flynn’s favorite chair as a prank. “Some researchers don’t think it really happened,” Mazzone said. “They say it was against the law, but these guys were crazy enough to do it, and we think they did.” In November of 1942, two underage girls accused Flynn of statutory rape while at a party inside Mulholland Farm and the scandal nearly ruined his career. During the two month-long trial, the dining room became the legal defense headquarters until a jury finally acquitted him. Flynn’s reputation as a womanizer was taken to new heights with the press creating the slogan “In like Flynn” to describe Flynn’s bedroom adventures. However, Flynn was not the unflappable star that the newspapers and magazines often depicted. He would later confess that his darker moods often led to thoughts of suicide. “I have a zest for living, and twice the urge to die,” he wrote. In 1943, Flynn married Nora Eddington and two daughters were born, Deirdre in 1945, and Rory in 1947. However, the marriage ended in 1949. During his final years at Mulholland Farm, Flynn battled ill-health, a growing alcohol and drug addiction and bouts of severe depression as his career began to falter. In 1950, he married actress Patrice Wymore and in 1953, he and Wymore left the United States for Europe and Jamaica, taking whatever movie roles he could find in order to settle his back taxes and delinquent alimony payments to Damita and Eddington. However, Flynn always tended to drift off course. He eventually lost his beloved Mulholland Farm to Damita in court, who sold it following Flynn’s death in 1959, to radio singing cowboy Stuart Hamblen, a devout Christian, who ended up living in the house with his family for twenty years. In 1980, Hamblen sold Mulholland Farm to child star-turned rock ‘n’ roll entertainer, Rick Nelson and his family, who lived there until Nelson’s death in 1985 from a plane crash. The Nelsons moved out the following year and, in time, the property was sold to a real estate developer who tore down the house in 1988. In 1997, actress Helen Hunt purchased the land and built a new home, but she never ended up living there. In 2002, she sold the property for $8.2 million to Justin Timberlake. THE HAUNTING: The first person to really publicly discuss the haunting at Mulholland Farm was Tracy Nelson, Rick Nelson’s daughter, who claimed that family members had occasionally heard the sound of objects being thrown against walls, the breaking of chairs and the shattering of glass. No actual damage was ever found. According to Tracy, whenever these sounds manifested, Rick Nelson would joke, \"Oh that's only Errol.\" Even though Tracy believes that the ghost of Errol Flynn might have been trying to warn Rick Nelson of his impending death, the Nelsons weren’t the only ones to experience the paranormal there. Robert Matzen, writes: “Way back in 1987, when I visited Mulholland, the last thing I expected to find was a ghost, but I sure could feel one there, and I think I caught a glimpse of it in a window, but I didn’t tell anyone for 15 years because I thought I was imagining things. Then Tracy Nelson’s story appeared in the Laurie Jacobson-Marc Wanamaker book, Hollywood Haunted, and I started to believe that maybe I wasn’t crazy. Then when Mike Mazzone and I were conducting serious research into the book and interviewing the people who had lived at Mulholland Farm or spent a significant amount of time there, everyone seemed to have had a first-hand ghost experience, including some hard-core fundamentalist Christians. We had intended to write a light-hearted sidebar about the Mulholland ghost, you know, ha-ha this place is supposedly haunted, but in the end we were compelled to devote a serious chapter to the paranormal goings on there as reported by a dozen witnesses. “Tracy Nelson’s brother, Gunnar, provided vivid accounts of living with the ghost. Even hard-bitten character actor Harv Presnell spent a considerable amount of time with me talking about the ghost of Mulholland Farm. Harv was married to one of the daughters of Stuart Hamblen, who owned Mulholland for 20 years. Several Hamblen family members agreed with Gunnar Nelson that the haunting centered around Flynn’s den and that wing of the house, both the first and second floor, which was where Errol felt most comfortable and chose to spend his time.”"
