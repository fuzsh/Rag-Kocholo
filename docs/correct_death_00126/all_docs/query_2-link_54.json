        "text": "Dear Flynnstones,\n\nhere is our man Flynn with jet set reporter Benno Graziani, one of the of the all time great photographers. www.vogue.co.uk/article/benno-graziani-interview…\n\nHis motto went a little like this: “Make em laugh, then shoot them“.\n\nAnd it applied very well to their encounter in Deauville.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n— shangheinz\n\nLast year I visited the beautiful island of Capri. There I bought a book about Capri in movies. Many movies were filmed there and many stars visited and still visit the island. Our dear Errol was one of them. Here is the picture of him that was in the book. I don’t know when it was taken but in the picture is singer Scarola (Giuseppe Savarese). I hope you enjoy this birthday treat. Happy birthday Errol. Hope you have a good one up there.\n\n— Debbyphielix\n\nDear Flynnstones,\n\nin reference to Errol Flynn’s Relatives in Sligo, Ireland? « The Errol Flynn Blog , Ireland`s poet laureate, William Butler Yeats, immortalized a certain Flynn in his volume of essays “The Celtic Twilight”.\n\n“Many of the tales in this book were told me by one Paddy Flynn, a little bright-eyed old man, who lived in a leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village of Ballisodare, which is, he was wont to say, ’the most gentle’—whereby he meant faery—‘place in the whole County of Sligo.’”\n\nYeats spend many of his childhood holidays in Sligo, actually Sligeach (meaning: place of the shells).\n\n“Flynn, with a few verbal alterations, from a note-book which I almost filled with his tales and sayings, shortly after seeing him. I look now at the note-book regretfully, for the blank pages at the end will never be filled up. Paddy Flynn is dead; a friend of mine gave him a large bottle of whiskey, and though a sober man at most times, the sight of so much liquor filled him with a great enthusiasm, and he lived upon it for some days and then died.”\n\nIf Errol didn`t read this already, that kind of literture seems very much to his liking. Compare it to: The errolist of books « The Errol Flynn Blog\n\nAnd being the perennial Robin Hood, he would have felt right at home in Sleuth Wood, which is situated along the shores of Loch Gill. also in the County of Sligo.\n\n“Sleuth Wood away at the south looked as though cut out of green beryl, and the waters that mirrored them shone like pale opal.” (from the short story “The Heart of Spring”).\n\nSláinte,\n\n— shangheinz"
