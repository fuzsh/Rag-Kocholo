        "text": "The temperature has fluctuated mightily of late, but I went ahead and planted geraniums in the pots on my front porch (before Mother’s Day!) and I think they’ll be okay.\n\nI have had a quiet week compared to last week and my weekend will be likewise sedate. No impending social events beyond the usual Sunday family get-together. I will use some of the time to catch up on the Errol Flynn movies I DVR’d over the month of April when he was the TCM Star of the Month. Many of these movies I have not seen since I watched “Errol Flynn Theater” on Sunday afternoons during my childhood. Some of the ones I have watched are better than I remembered.\n\nI liked Desperate Journey (1942) which follows the crew of a downed British bomber as they escape from their Nazi captors with Top Secret intelligence. The desperate journey they make to get out of Germany alive is exciting and full of derring-do. The cast of Warner Brothers A-teamers is excellent and includes Ronald Reagan in a scene-stealing part.\n\nI also liked Objective, Burma! (1945) which is a gritty WWII adventure about a platoon of special ops who parachute into the remote Burmese jungle to destroy a strategic Japanese radar station, but find that getting back out isn’t easy.\n\nThe Master of Ballantrae (1953) is an entertaining swashbuckler loosely based on the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Filmed in technicolor in England and Scotland, it exhibits high production values and its stars, Errol Flynn and Roger Livesey, look great in their costumes and seem to be enjoying themselves.\n\nNo, it’s not Captain Blood, but it’s not bad.\n\nAs I have noted before, our mother was a huge fan of Errol Flynn and it really bothered her that he ruined his career and his looks with his lifestyle and heavy drinking. (He died at age 50 in 1959.) She basically wrote off all his movies after the mid-1940s. She had a point, but I would argue that some of his later movies are not that bad and, really, compared to a lot of actors, he looked good right up to the end. It’s just that he started out so great. Sigh.\n\nI liked this post about how people, as they age, just want to remain useful and bear fruit. The author even quotes from Psalm 92 which I also did last week.\n\nI love reading about guys like this.\n\nI also liked this post about Elon Musk buying Twitter (although the writer uses ‘pretty’ as a modifier way too much.) “Lest we forget, it seems that Elon Musk got it in his head—at least in part—to purchase Twitter when Twitter gave a temporary suspension to the Babylon Bee.”\n\nI love it. Never underestimate the Bee.\n\n*Ecclesiastes 1: 5\n\nToday is the feast day of Clive Staples Lewis in the Episcopal Church. That’s C.S. Lewis, Christian apologist and spiritual writer, who died on November 22, 1963.\n\n“Your real, new self (which is Christ’s and also yours, and yours just because it is His) will not come as long as you are looking for it. It will come when you are looking for Him. Does that sound strange? The same principle holds, you know, for more everyday matters. Even in social life, you will never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking about what sort of impression you are making. Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it. The principle runs through all life from top to bottom, Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.”\n\n― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity\n\nHere’s an article about CSL to refresh your memory. It may be time to revisit Narnia.\n\nWell, here we are and it is almost Thanksgiving! This weekend I will be getting my act together and the house ready for the big day next week, which won’t be such a big event this year. Still, there will be a turkey and all the fixins…How do you do Thanksgiving? Garden & Gun readers answered that question here.\n\nOur mother served a distinctly New England version of the Thanksgiving feast (which was her mother’s version), and for years after she died, I replicated it, squash and all. Over the years, however, we changed the menu and simplified it to suit our tastes. I don’t think she’d mind. I hope she would approve of our cheesy potato casserole and green beans. She would be pleased that we use her china and set a nice table.\n\nThis past week I watched several Errol Flynn movies, prompted by the boy’s recommendation to watch Against All Flags (1952) which is on Amazon Prime.\n\nHe was right–it is good entertainment and Errol, although along in years (he was 43!) has not yet gone around the bend.\n\nEncouraged by this, I attempted to watch The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939) which I had DVR’d. Despite the fact that Errol was in his prime, the movie for me was unwatchable, due to Bette Davis and her over-acting. Good lord, she was too much. I gave up after half an hour.\n\nBattered but unbowed, I started The Adventures of Don Juan (1948) a few nights later. Flynn was 39 at this point and, although the movie is derivative of every other swashbuckler he made, down to the shot of him riding across a stream with Alan Hale at night followed by a posse of angry Englishmen, with the moonlight coming through the trees, he is still in surprisingly good form and very engaging. I enjoyed the movie a lot.\n\nSo if you are looking for something to watch this weekend, try an Errol Flynn movie. They don’t make profiles like his anymore.\n\nHave a good weekend. Take it easy. Eat some pancakes.\n\nAs you know, today is Valentine’s Day. We thought it would be fun to look at some of our favorite couples in history since we’ve already looked at favorite movie couples/kisses in years past.\n\nWilliam and Mary, King and Queen of England, who rocked the Glorious Revolution together.\n\n2. Simon and Ann Bradstreet, “questing puritans”…She wrote, “If ever two were one, then surely we/If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.”\n\n3. Calvin and Grace Coolidge, President and First Lady. He said, “I do not know what I would do without her.”\n\n3. Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, poets. She wrote, “I love thee with the breath,/Smiles, tears, of all my life; and if God choose,/I shall but love thee better after death.”\n\n4. Katie von Bora and Martin Luther, reformers, who famously said, ” There is no more lovely, charming and friendly relationship, communion or company than a good marriage.”\n\n5. Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, actors, who proved that a long marriage in Hollywood is not impossible…unlikely, but not impossible.\n\nWell, our advice yesterday was to do your best in Lent, and that is good advice for love and marriage as well.\n\nAs for what to watch on Valentine’s Day, nothing tops The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland for romance. This movie turns 80 years old this year! All the stars were aligned when this movie was made. It is perfect.\n\nSigh.\n\nHappy Valentine’s Day!\n\n*Joyce Brothers\n\nCan it be January 19th already? Zut alors! Readers of this blog may remember that this is the birthday of our dear mother, as well as Dolly Parton and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Truly a day to celebrate!\n\nHere is a photo of our little mother holding one DP who is one-year old.\n\nI think my older brother (age 6) took the picture because 1) the look on our mother’s face and 2) the artful set-up of the snapshot, the empty garage taking a prime part of the photo.\n\nThere are other snaps in this series taken by my mother of the baby in the stroller and of Cowboy Chris. But I’m betting my brother picked up the camera and said, “Let ME take a picture of YOU!”\n\nAnyway, I’m glad he did.\n\nWell, I plan to toast Mary, Dolly and Buffy tonight. (Drynuary turned out not to be a thing.) In their honor, I may watch one our mother’s favorite movies. Possibilities would be:\n\nDecisions, decisions…\n\nIn the meantime, here’s a little Bruce Spingsteen to brighten your day: O, Mary, don’t you weep no more…a rockin’ rendition of an old favorite.\n\nHave a blessed day and never forget that pharaoh’s army got drowned.\n\nToday is the birthday of author Rafael Sabatini (April 29, 1875 – February 13, 1950). He was born in Italy, the son of an English mother and an Italian father–both opera singers, which explains a lot.\n\nSabatini wrote in English, and all in all, he produced 31 novels, eight short story collections, six non-fiction books, numerous uncollected short stories, and a play. I think I read Scaramouche way back when, but he is best known these days because of two great movies and a bunch of other not-so-great movies, which were inspired by his novels. I’m thinking, of course, of Captain Blood (1935)\n\nand The Sea Hawk (1940)\n\nboth starring Errol Flynn and directed by Michael Curtiz.\n\nBut we mustn’t forget Scaramouche (1952) which starred Stewart Granger\n\nand The Black Swan (1942) with Tyrone Power–\n\nboth not as good despite being filmed in flaming technicolor. (There are also quite a few old silent movies based on his adventure novels.)\n\nAnyway, I suggest we all watch movies this weekend inspired by the stories of Rafael Sabatini. We could do a lot worse. I vote for Captain Blood which is full of action and good dialogue:\n\nArabella Bishop: Oh, forgive me for not recognizing you, Dr. Blood. You’re so changed… and for the better.\n\nDr. Peter Blood: The Governor tells me I have you to thank for that.\n\nArabella Bishop: You don’t sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.\n\nDr. Peter Blood: Do you suppose I’d be grateful for an easy life, when my friends are treated like animals? Faith, it’s they deserve your favors, not I. They’re all honest rebels. I was snoring in my bed while they were trying to free England from an unclean tyrant [King James].\n\nArabella Bishop: I believe you’re talking treason.\n\nDr. Peter Blood: I hope I’m not obscure.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\n*Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini\n\nToday the boy turns 28 on the 28th! We wish him a glorious birthday. He was actually born on the day after Thanksgiving, shortly before midnight.\n\nAnd now a this-is-how-my-mind-works side-note. Recently I watched The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) on TCM and the host noted that Errol Flynn was 28 years old when he made this film seventy-six years ago. I paid attention, because I was thinking about the boy turning 28. Errol, of course, is at the top of his game at age 28–handsome, athletic, smart–before he started that early slide precipitated by drugs and alcohol and a reckless lifestyle. Sadly, there has never been anyone quite like Errol Flynn in the movies since.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend watching this great film tonight. I really think it is one of the all-time best movies ever made and one of my top-five favorites.\n\nThe cast is perfect.\n\nThe script is tip-top–so witty and sophisticated, yet action-packed. The sets and costumes are un-paralleled and designed for technicolor which is–and so early in the game–vibrant and dazzling. The music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is terrific and oft-copied. At the time, it was the most expensive movie ever made, and it shows. The studio’s money (for once) was not wasted. The director Michael Curtiz (one of my favorites) is the best.\n\nIt won Oscars for Art Direction, Editing and Score, but lost the Best Picture Award to You Can’t Take It With You. Please. You’ve got to be kidding.\n\nIt really is perfect on every level. I should also note that this movie boasts one of the all-time great female characters–Lady Marian Fitzwalter.\n\nAs portrayed by Olivia de Havilland, Maid Marian is beautiful, smart, brave, and chaste. Buttoned up in high-necked gowns at all times, she is also undeniably sexy. She stands up bravely to the villains in the film and does not run off with Robin when things start to get dangerous. No, she stays in the castle where she can do the most good spying for the good guys. She is wonderful. Please note: this is a type of woman Hollywood is completely unable to get right anymore.\n\nSo happy birthday to the boy\n\nand have a great weekend!\n\nMonday is St. Patrick’s Day and a lot of people will be celebrating this weekend. However, besides watching The Quiet Man, which I blogged about here, I am not a great one for celebrating the feast day of old St. Patrick.\n\nI must admit that I do have some Irish blood. My Irish ancestors–the Carnahans–hailed from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Our great-great-great-great-grandfather, David Carnahan came to the U.S. in the mid-18th century, fought in the American Revolution and settled in Alleghany County, Pennsylvania. The Carnahans were staunch Presbyterians. One of our cousins, James Carnahan (below), a Presbyterian minister, became the President of Princeton University where he served from 1823 to 1854 (longer than any other President).\n\nHis cousin James was married to my namesake Catherine Rand in 1857 by the Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire and had seven children in Ravenna, Ohio. They, of course, were brought up as Episcopalians.\n\nMy most favorite Irish thing is the Cuala Press which was established by Elizabeth Yeats, sister of William Butler Yeats and Jack Yeats, in 1908. It played an important part in the “Celtic Revival” in the early 20th century.\n\nI have a framed print in my office and one at home that I bought in the Trinity College Bookstore in Dublin. I do love these woodcuts!\n\nThe real things go up for auction from time to time and are worth a pretty penny. If I had money to spare, I would have my own collection! Don’t you just love them?\n\nOf course, no discussion of favorite Irish things would be complete without mention of Errol Flynn. Although not strictly speaking Irish–he was born in Tasmania of Australian parents of English, Scottish and Irish descent and an Anglican–we can enjoy his movies on St. Patrick’s Day if we want to. And thanks to a good friend who sent me this DVD, I will be watching this classic Flynn opus:\n\nI also plan to watch The Sea Hawk (1940) which I DVR’d on TCM last week.\n\nIt is a fun movie directed by the great Michael Curtiz. Unfortunately Olivia de Haviland is nowhere in sight. But it does have Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth I, and if you ask me, she is 10 times better than Bette Davis as the Virgin Queen.\n\nAs for food, nothing Irish comes to mind. When we were growing up our mother would make corned beef and cabbage and boiled potatoes on March 17, mostly because she just liked them. I was never a fan of this meal. I preferred the corned beef hash she made the next day.\n\nWhat is your favorite Irish thing?\n\nWell, while you’re thinking about that, I’ll wrap this up with the words of Pat Cohan: “Ah, what a day for Innisfree! On a day like this, I can say only one thing – Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!”\n\nSláinte to all Carnahans!\n\nThe battle of Agincourt took place on Friday, October 25, 1415 (Saint Crispin’s Day) in northern France. You can read all about it here. And here’s the rousing speech by (Shakespeare’s) Henry V. (Every day is a good day to read this out loud; you will feel smarter having done so.)\n\nWhat’s he that wishes so?\n\nMy cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:\n\nIf we are mark’d to die, we are enow\n\nTo do our country loss; and if to live,\n\nThe fewer men, the greater share of honour.\n\nGod’s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.\n\nBy Jove, I am not covetous for gold,\n\nNor care I who doth feed upon my cost;\n\nIt yearns me not if men my garments wear;\n\nSuch outward things dwell not in my desires:\n\nBut if it be a sin to covet honour,\n\nI am the most offending soul alive.\n\nNo, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:\n\nGod’s peace! I would not lose so great an honour\n\nAs one man more, methinks, would share from me\n\nFor the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!\n\nRather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,\n\nThat he which hath no stomach to this fight,\n\nLet him depart; his passport shall be made\n\nAnd crowns for convoy put into his purse:\n\nWe would not die in that man’s company\n\nThat fears his fellowship to die with us.\n\nThis day is called the feast of Crispian:\n\nHe that outlives this day, and comes safe home,\n\nWill stand a tip-toe when the day is named,\n\nAnd rouse him at the name of Crispian.\n\nHe that shall live this day, and see old age,\n\nWill yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,\n\nAnd say ‘To-morrow is Saint Crispian:’\n\nThen will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.\n\nAnd say ‘These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.’\n\nOld men forget: yet all shall be forgot,\n\nBut he’ll remember with advantages\n\nWhat feats he did that day: then shall our names.\n\nFamiliar in his mouth as household words\n\nHarry the king, Bedford and Exeter,\n\nWarwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,\n\nBe in their flowing cups freshly remember’d.\n\nThis story shall the good man teach his son;\n\nAnd Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,\n\nFrom this day to the ending of the world,\n\nBut we in it shall be remember’d;\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n\nFor he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n\nShall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,\n\nThis day shall gentle his condition:\n\nAnd gentlemen in England now a-bed\n\nShall think themselves accursed they were not here,\n\nAnd hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks\n\nThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.\n\nToday is also the anniversary of the Charge of the Light Brigade, a charge of British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War in 1854.\n\nHere is the famous poem written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson to commemorate the event. I think my older brother had to memorize this poem in fifth grade and that was my first introduction to it. My kindergarten self thought it was pretty dramatic.\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade\n\nHalf a league, half a league,\n\nHalf a league onward,\n\nAll in the valley of Death,\n\nRode the six hundred.\n\n‘Forward, the Light Brigade!\n\nCharge for the guns’ he said:\n\nInto the valley of Death\n\nRode the six hundred.\n\n‘Forward, the Light Brigade!’\n\nWas there a man dismay’d?\n\nNot tho’ the soldiers knew\n\nSome one had blunder’d:\n\nTheirs not to make reply,\n\nTheirs not to reason why,\n\nTheirs but to do and die:\n\nInto the valley of Death\n\nRode the six hundred.\n\nCannon to right of them,\n\nCannon to left of them,\n\nCannon in front of them\n\nVolley’d and thunder’d;\n\nStorm’d at with shot and shell,\n\nBoldly they rode and well,\n\nInto the jaws of Death,\n\nInto the mouth of Hell\n\nRode the six hundred.\n\nFlash’d all their sabres bare,\n\nFlash’d as they turned in air\n\nSabring the gunners there,\n\nCharging an army while\n\nAll the world wonder’d:\n\nPlunged in the battery-smoke\n\nRight thro’ the line they broke;\n\nCossack and Russian\n\nReel’d from the sabre-stroke\n\nShatter’d and sunder’d.\n\nThen they rode back, but not\n\nNot the six hundred.\n\nCannon to right of them,\n\nCannon to left of them,\n\nCannon behind them\n\nVolley’d and thunder’d;\n\nStorm’d at with shot and shell,\n\nWhile horse and hero fell,\n\nThey that had fought so well\n\nCame thro’ the jaws of Death,\n\nBack from the mouth of Hell,\n\nAll that was left of them,\n\nLeft of six hundred.\n\nWhen can their glory fade?\n\nO the wild charge they made!\n\nAll the world wonder’d.\n\nHonour the charge they made!\n\nHonour the Light Brigade,\n\nNoble six hundred!\n\nWhere is this post going? you ask. Well now, I don’t know about you, but all this patriotic English hoo-haw puts me in the mood for some Errol Flynn! However, the film version of The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936) is notable mostly for the fact that Errol Flynn does not “get the girl” (Olivia de Haviland).\n\nNo, his brother, played by the handsome Patric Knowles, does. This is hardly satisfactory.\n\nI am more in the mood for something like Rocky Mountain (1950), which dishes up some large helpings of Confederate hoo-haw.\n\nMy movie pick for this week tells the story of a Confederate troop, led by Captain Lafe Barstow (Flynn), prowling the far ranges of California and Nevada in “a last desperate attempt” to build up an army in the West for the faltering Confederacy. The troop fails in its mission but the honor of the Old South is upheld as they too make a charge into “the valley of Death”. Although it features an aging Errol Flynn, it is not as bad as it sounds, due mostly to a pretty good screenplay by Alan Le May who wrote The Unforgiven and The Searchers. Also, Flynn does not phone in his performance as usual during this phase of his career, probably because he was trying to impress his co-star, the 24-year old Patrice Wymore, whom he married when filming ended.\n\nAnyway, I like this movie and its old-fashioned gallantry. There is even an obsessively loyal dog. And the tune “Dixie” is prominently featured in the tear-inducing score. I am hoping that it will be a good respite from baseball stress. Our Cardinals who have…fought so well…we hope will come…\n\n…thro’ the jaws of Death,\n\nBack from the mouth of Hell…\n\nWell, you get the idea. In other news: Eminem’s daughter Hailee was named homecoming queen at her high school. I don’t know about you, but this makes me very happy.\n\nI recently saw a post on another blog about the best screen kisses. This got me thinking, because, of course, I didn’t agree with the ones they had chosen. I won’t get into that, but I did think it was a good idea for a post, especially with Valentine’s Day fast approaching. You’ll want to line up your DVD viewing for February.\n\nSo here are the best screen kisses (in my opinion):\n\n1.\n\nThe BEST: Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). When Robin challenges Marian, “Then you do love me, don’t you? Don’t you?” we are right there with her answering, “You know I do.” It’s been 75 years since this great movie was made, and nothing surpasses it for its romance and handsome leading man and lady! Captain Blood (1935)–also with Errol and Olivia–is equally wonderful, but they only kiss once and she slaps him!\n\n2.\n\nThe Quiet Man (1952) actually features several world-class kissing scenes, but John Wayne and Maureen in the rain is pretty special. You can tell they really enjoy kissing each other. John and Maureen were always a good fit.\n\n3.\n\nAnother kissing-in-the-rain scene, this time with Audrey, George and Cat. Eat your heart out, Ryan Gosling.\n\n4.\n\nJimmy Stewart and Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story (1940). Who knew that Jimmy Stewart would steal the sexy-show from co-star Cary Grant? I remember my mother pointed this out to me many years ago–something about his hands and what he was doing with them. Hmmm. It’s always the quiet ones, right?\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nOkay, we’ll give Cary Grant a hat tip for North By Northwest (1959) with Eva Marie Saint. He doesn’t look too uncomfortable in this one.\n\nAnd even though Gone With the Wind (1939) is not one of my favorite movies, who can deny that Clark Gable knew how to kiss? Atlanta is burning and he is parting with Scarlett on the bridge–wow. Back then they really knew how to set up the scene and stage the actors to optimal effect. He looms over her, powerful and manly; they kiss. And then he leaves!\n\nBest acting while kissing:\n\nRock Hudson, God love him, and Doris Day in Pillow Talk (1959) go away for the weekend–so risque, so great. And then she finds out who he really is. Ooooooh!\n\nSo what have I left out?\n\nBecause I felt like I should have something since 1961, but nothing came to mind, I decided to check out one of the kisses that was mentioned several times in the comment section of the other blog. The blogger had asked for readers’ suggestions, and several people mentioned North and South. I did some checking and discovered it is a BBC four-part adaption of the 19th century novel by Elizabeth Gaskell (not the Civil War soap opera from the 1980s). I watched it last weekend (4 episodes) and, boy oh boy, what a find!\n\nHello, Richard Armitage!\n\nLet’s just say he is totally wasted as Thorin Oakenshield in The Hobbit.\n\nIn conclusion, I give you the famous Montage of Kissing Scenes from the wonderful Cinema Paradiso (1988), which includes Errol and Olivia at least twice!"
