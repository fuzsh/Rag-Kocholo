        "text": "Patrice Wymore, an actress and the third and final wife of the swashbuckling star Errol Flynn, died Saturday in Portland, Jamaica, after a long illness, the Jamaica Observer newspaper reported. She was 87.\n\nWymore made her film debut in a singing role in Tea for Two (1950) opposite Doris Day and Gordon MacRae and then met Flynn, 17 years her senior, during the filming of Rocky Mountain (1950) in New Mexico.\n\nThey wed in Monaco in October 1950, lived on his yacht for years and then bought a 2,000-acre cattle ranch and coconut plantation in the foothills of the Blue Mountains near Port Antonio, currently home to the exclusive Errol Flynn Marina.\n\nFlynn, the star of such classic 1930s action films as The Adventures of Robin Hood and Captain Blood, was plagued by health problems and an addiction to alcohol and drugs and died in October 1959 at age 50.\n\nThe couple’s only child, daughter Arnella, died of an apparent drug overdose in 1998.\n\nWymore, a native of Miltonvale, Kan., toured with her family in vaudeville. She appeared on Broadway in the late 1940s in the musicals Hold It! and All for Love, and Warner Bros. signed her to a studio contract.\n\nWymore also was seen in the films I’ll See You in My Dreams (1951), She’s Working Her Way Through College (1952), The Big Trees (1952), She’s Back on Broadway (1953), King’s Rhapsody (1955), The Sad Horse (1959), Ocean’s Eleven (1960) and Chamber of Horrors (1966).\n\nShe starred in installments of the anthology series The Errol Flynn Theater and also appeared on television in Cheyenne, 77 Sunset Strip, Perry Mason, the daytime soap Never Too Young, The Monkees and F Troop."
