Higham read the transcript quickly and decided to call Ladislas Farago. Farago is a popular. writer, whose books include \"The Game of the Foxes\" and \"Patton: Ordeal and Tri- umph\"--and he knew an enormous amount about espionage, and kept vo- luminous files filled with names. Higham reached Farago by tele- phone. Did he know anything about Nazis and Errol Flynn? \"Freddy McEvoy,\" Farago said. Mc- Evoy, a green-eyed Australian playboy who looked very much like Flynn, was one of the central characters in Hig- ham's book. There was a picture of him lounging on the deck of Flynn's yacht. Higham had thought of him as Flynn's-closest friend. Now Farago told him that McEvoy was a rabidly anti-Semitic Nazi sympathizer-that some years before he drowned in a storm off the coast of Morocco, Mc- Evoy had been part of a clandestine international clique working for the Third Reich. Higham called London. He asked his British researcher to find Willi Frischauer, a retired journalist who lived in London and whom Higham considered one of the leading Euro- pean authorities on espionage. The researcher reached Frischauer I at .home. What. Frischauer said, ac- cording to Higham, was this: He said the territory was quite dangerous. He said the researcher should come to his home the following morning to talk. He said, \"There are people that won't like this found out. Be careful. Tell Mr. Higham to be careful.\" He said, \"I do know for a fact -that Errol Flynn was a Nazi agent.\" Charles Higham went to bed. that evening and stared out into- the dark- , & He did not sleep. In the morning operating, he says now, on the, blind instinct of an experienced biographer lip h.Wok the train from Los Angeles shington, went straight to the, nai,Archives, and found the files tpntain. the names of suspected hcolumn\" subsersivesbrought to sW Cention of the State Department during World War I.I. i'' te'found Erben's name. , , He found McEvoy's name. \"And I found cards,\" Higham says, \"on Errol Flynn.\" \"Possible Subver- sive Activities,\" read the cards. h Higham 'had spent `the, last 24 months of . his life researching this bi- ography, interviewing, traveling,- tele- phoning, writing,` rewriting, trapped;,' in the strange symbiosis of the biogra ;pher'and_his subject. His advance was tsed'up. The idea of another year's ;:work,-made him feel physically ill.

By tho'. r time he had finished the book, Hig-' 'ham believed himself considerably be- yond surprises on the subject of Errol Flynn. The documents he requested began arriving in December 1978- fat ma- nila envelopes filled with State Depart- ment - memoranda, passport applica- tions,, consular, reports; FBI reports, Coast Guard reports, military intelli- gence reports. Higham read and in- terviewed, and pieced together what he could. He says he got hold of Erben's Nazi membership card : and certificte of Aryan ancestry. He says he learned from government documents that while Erben was working in Florida, at a- Civilian Conservation. Corps camp, he made photographs of training meth- ods and camp layouts, and spoke openly of his Nazism: He says-he learned that-when a warrant was is- sued for -Erben's arrest, on charges that Erben -left the United States ille gally during. a citizenship revocation trial, Errol Flynn -hid Erben aboard his yacht and helped get. the, German doctor into Mexico.

Errol Flynn raping women, Errol 'Flynn buying, boys for the night. Errol Flynn stealing jewelry and dropping a piranha into his dinner hostess' fish tank and working so drunk he had to be wired. to the castle battlements. Almost from thesfirst in- terviews, Charles Higham had under stood,that he was writing about an es- sentially amoral man-\"frozen in that fascist period of first puberty,\" he. wrote in the introduction, \"when the human male. feels his oats. and is ready to try anything. Higham had worked two full years on his Flynn biography. He had cho- sen a title, perused the photographs, sat through the minor motion pit-, tures,.stared over and over at the fa- mous Flynn profile-the - delicate mustache, the aquiline nose, the clean strong are of the matinee idol's jawline in scenes from \"Captain Blood\" to. \"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\" But something nagged. It began with a single telephone call. Higham still needed some .photo- graphs of Flynn's early childhood, and he phoned for help to the Los Angeles .writer who, had ghosted Flynn's auto- biography. The writer obliged.. Then the writer mentioned that an Errol Flynn buff had called him with an odd tip; perhaps Higham would be interested. It seemed this Flynn ad miter had found an old newspaper ar- ticle that said Dr. H. F. Erben, whom Higham knew, only as an eccentric. Austrian doctor: who had befriended, Flynn in New Guinea and remained a close. companion for many years, had turned state's evidence`at a 1946 Nazi espionage trial held in Shanghai. Higham was curious, and a little un- easy. He got' hold of the Shanghai trial transcript.; Under oath, on, the stand, the mysterious Dr. Erben had; discussed In'-detail his role in the, Mexico City branch of the Abwehr, the German military intelligence, com- mand that asked Erben to found the Shanghai Nazi spyring..Erben, in a recent interview -in Vienna for ABG news program- \"20/20,,\"_ said he did tea- ??

To the charge that he involv- ed Flynn in Nazi spying activities, Er- ben replied, \"Utterly impossible . . neither snaring Errol Flynn. a friend of mine, not brain-washing Errol Flynn, a friend of mine. was ever at- tempted or ever considered.\" A dim memory surfaced now, some- thing the late producer Robert Lord had told Higham nearly 10 years be- fore. It had to do with Lord's picture \"Dive Bomber,\" filmed in Hawaii in 1941. Lord had been adamant that Higham not tape-record or write down his statement,. but as Higham, dug back he believed he could reconstruct almost verbatim what the producer had told him. .. In his book, he writes that this Is what he heard: Lord: \"I do not want. this statement published until after I'm dead. In: our advance prints of the picture, before it 'was released, we used most of Er- rol's land and air. shots of Pearl Har- bor at his suggestion in a special, semi-documentary presentation - -.oi' America's power in the Pacific. An ad. vance print was sent to our represent- atives in Japan In the normal course of events in the late summer of 1941 \" Higham says Lord was in naval in- telligence, and felt the Japanese had studied those films as a planning aid before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lord: \"It's also shocking to think In retrospect .that again at Errol's sug- gestion, we showed every detail of the San Diego Naval Base and the entire structure of the Enterprise. I believe ,the Japanese kept the film under study for years in case of a possible assault on California.\" . Higham had to find Erben. \"Obviously, if he was still alive, he was my number one target,\" Higham says. \"I had a burning, consuming de- sire to expose this man . I hate Nazis with all, my soul. Writing; this book for me had been. an adventure the first time. round. It was a mission the second time round. A mission of exposure of my enemy.\" . Higham had one of his researchers, check for Erben's name in past Ameri- can Medical Association directories. He found it. Erben. was listed as an absentee member in Vienna. _\"So I called Vienna,\" Higham says. \"No reply. I called again. No reply; So I had 'my service. calling day and night, for three weeks, all through the night, with instructions to call me .no matter when, if they got through. Nothing happened. One morning at 9:00, I got out of bed, and I had an overpowering impulse to call Vienna -and I did. And a woman answered. My heart almost stopped:\" .The woman, speaking English, told Higham she was Erben's sister. Erbep was out of the country, High am says she said. He had moved to a leper col- ony in Sagada, in the Philippines, a wild and isolated place in the moun- tains where the doctor was at work on field research in leprosy.. There was no way Higham could reach the place himself, he decided the terrain' was treacherous, and prone to violent storms. He asked the Philippine consulate to suggest relia- .ble journalists who might make the trip for him, with a- tape recorder and a set of questions, and when Higham had his names he'stuck a pin into the list at random to make his selection. The man - he had chosen, Higham says, had grown up in Sagada. And he knew Erben. He knew him very well. The Philippine reporter talked to Erben at some length, Higham says, - asking questions that made no refer- \"\"ence to espionage. It helped to have a third party, Higham thought; he had. learned from a former intelligence of- ficer that in a situation like this, the interviewer ought to look as innocent as possible. \"Ile taught me counterintelligence techniques,\" Higham says. \"He taught me, for instance, that you never dis- close to your subject what you know - that by seeming to be ignorant, you find out more than they intended you -to know. Because the one thing that's :;significant of all Nazi agents is their contempt, especially for the English. And he would have a double contempt for me, because he would see me as a lightweight, showbiz writer who was 'lucky enough to find him. in the wilds 'of the Philippines.\" There was a great deal Higham needed to know about Erben,.but one 'of the, most important points of all was Erben's apparently, illegal flight to Mexico during the trial to revoke his citizenship. If Higham could prove that Flynn helped him go, he believed It would help establish beyond a doubt that actor and German Nazi to-' z gether; knowingly, conspired' against' 'the Allies. So the Philippine reporter inno .cently asked Erben when he had last seen Errol Flynn. _ \"The answer, was exactly what I'd' hoped for--.'When Errol Flynn drove me Into Mexico, in November, 1940,'.\" Higham says. \"Tht was it It was fab- ulous. It was on tape.\" When an FBI I agent was 'recently asked by !a re porter about: the Nazi spying allega- { trans, ~?: the agent asked plaintively, -\"Next you're going to ? tell me that 'Joh'n Wayne was a KGB agent?\" Higham believes that if FBI men had had their wits about them during World War 11,'-Flynn would have. been arrested as-.a. Nazi subversive. \"The FBI was not an intelligence organiza- tian, and ,.their agents were not trained in intelligence techniques,\" he writes in his book. \"They failed to co- ordinate their investigations with -those of the' State Department, -and even `when they tried, they. often. found :their, complaints-blocked.. They also failed-.to=correlate with.. military 'and naval intelligence :-.'.Had British intelligence been in charge of the Flymatter,`. there is .no question ;.the'Y.would.:have, succeeded in.arrest , EXCLisi'1` it Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/18: CIA-RDP90-00552R000201950002-4"
