        "text": "Errol Flynn\n\nErrol Flynn, 1940 Birth name: Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn Date of birth: June 20 1909(1909-06-20) Birth location: Hobart, Tasmania, Australia Date of death: October 14 1959 (aged 50) Death location: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Spouse: Lili Damita\n\nNora Eddington\n\nPatrice Wymore\n\nErrol Leslie Thomson Flynn (June 20, 1909 – October 14, 1959) was an Australian film actor, writer, producer, and director. He became most famous for his romantic swashbuckler roles in Hollywood films and his flamboyant lifestyle. He is remembered as one of Hollywood's legendary figures, with leading roles in more than 60 movies during his short 50 years of life. Flynn brought entertainment to millions of movie goers with his devil–may–care and derring do on–screen adventures. Like many others before and after him, he blurred the lines between on screen and off screen personae. Few did that as well as Errol Flynn.\n\nEarly life\n\nFlynn was born in Hobart, Tasmania, to Marelle Young and Theodore Thomas Flynn. His family moved to Sydney, New South Wales, when Flynn was a young child. Here he met his first love, the ocean. His father, Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a biologist and a professor at the Queen's University of Belfast in Northern Ireland for the latter part of his career. Flynn was a very athletic person However, he did not excel at his studies. He was expelled from two private schools for fighting. When he was 20 years old, he moved to New Guinea, where he bought a tobacco plantation. Unfortunately the business failed. His next attempt at business, a copper mining venture in the hills near the Laloki Valley near Port Moresby, also failed.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Flynn left for Great Britain and got an acting job with the Northampton Repertory Company, where he worked for seven months. There, he starred in the American film In the Wake of the Bounty, directed by Charles Chucker in 1933. According to Gerry Connelly's biography Errol Flynn in Northampton, Flynn also performed at the 1934 Malvern Festival, in Glasgow, and in London's West End. He was discovered by a Warner Bros. executive, signed to a contract, and shipped to America as a contract actor. In 1942, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\n\nActing career\n\nFlynn became an overnight sensation with his first starring role, Captain Blood, in 1935. He became typecast as a swashbuckler and made a host of such films, including The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Dawn Patrol (1938) with his close friend David Niven, Dodge City (1939), The Sea Hawk (1940), and Adventures of Don Juan (1948).\n\nFlynn played opposite Olivia de Havilland in eight films, including Captain Blood, The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood, Dodge City, Santa Fe Trail (1940), and They Died with their Boots On (1941). The Adventures of Robin Hood was Flynn's first film in Technicolor.\n\nDuring the shooting of The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), Flynn and co-star Bette Davis had some legendary off-screen fights, with Davis striking him harder than necessary while filming a scene. Their relationship was always strained, but Warner Brothers teamed them up twice. Their off-screen relationship was later reconciled. A contract was even presented to lend them out as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind but the teaming failed to materialize.\n\nFlynn won acclaim as a drunken ne'er-do-well in The Sun Also Rises (1957). His colorful autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, was published just months after his death and contains humorous anecdotes about Hollywood. Flynn wanted to call the book In Like Me, but the publisher refused. In 1984, CBS produced a television mini-series based on Flynn's autobiography, starring Duncan Regehr as Flynn.\n\nIn the 1950s, Flynn tried his hand as a novelist, penning the adventure novel Showdown, which was published in 1952.\n\nMarriages\n\nFlynn was married three times, to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn); to Nora Eddington from 1943 until 1948 (two daughters, Deirdre and Rory); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma). In Hollywood, he tended to refer to himself as Irish rather than Australian. Flynn lived with Wymore in Port Antonio, Jamaica, in the 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism to this area, and for a while owned the Titchfield Hotel, decorated by the artist Olga Lehmann, and popularized trips down rivers on bamboo rafts.\n\nLater life\n\nFlynn decided to leave California in 1952, after purchasing a yacht named Zaca with his third wife. He had become bored with Hollywood and felt he was not being offered promising roles. Flynn stated that being on the ocean made him feel comfortable and at home. In his later years, he started writing.\n\nFlynn wrote the following books:\n\nBeam Ends (1937)\n\nShowdown (1946)\n\nMy Wicked, Wicked Ways (1959)\n\nWhile at a friend's house in Vancouver, British Columbia, Flynn suffered a heart attack and died on October 14, 1959. He is interred in Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California.\n\nFilmography\n\nIn the Wake of the Bounty 1933\n\nMurder at Monte Carlo 1935\n\nThe Case of the Curious Bride 1935\n\nDon't Bet on Blondes 1935\n\nCaptain Blood 1935\n\nPirate Party on Catalina Isle 1936\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade 1936\n\nThe Green Light 1937\n\nThe Prince and the Pauper 1937\n\nAnother Dawn 1937\n\nThe Perfect Specimen 1937\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood 1938\n\nFour's a Crowd 1938\n\nThe Sisters 1938\n\nThe Dawn Patrol 1938\n\nDodge City 1939\n\nThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex 1939\n\nVirginia City 1940\n\nThe Sea Hawk 1940\n\nSanta Fe Trail 1940\n\nFootsteps in the Dark 1941\n\nDive Bomber 1941\n\nThey Died With Their Boots On 1942\n\nDesperate Journey 1942\n\nGentleman Jim 1942\n\nEdge of Darkness 1943\n\nThank Your Lucky Stars 1943\n\nNorthern Pursuit 1943\n\nUncertain Glory 1944\n\nObjective, Burma! 1945\n\nSan Antonio 1945\n\nNever Say Goodbye 1946\n\nCry Wolf 1947\n\nEscape Me Never 1947\n\nAlways Together 1947\n\nSilver River 1948\n\nAdventures of Don Juan 1949\n\nIt's a Great Feeling 1949\n\nThat Forsyte Woman 1949\n\nMontana 1950\n\nRocky Mountain 1950\n\nKim 1951\n\nHello God 1951\n\nAdventures of Captain Fabian 1951\n\nMara Maru 1952\n\nAgainst All Flags 1952\n\nCruise of the Zaca 1952\n\nDeep Sea Fishing 1952\n\nThe Master of Ballantrae 1953\n\nCrossed Swords 1954\n\nWilliam Tell' 1954\n\nLet's Make Up 1955\n\nThe Warriors 1955\n\nKing's Rhapsody 1955\n\nIstanbul 1956\n\nThe Big Boodle 1956\n\nThe Sun Also Rises 1957\n\nToo Much, Too Soon 1958\n\nThe Roots of Heaven 1958\n\nCuban Rebel Girls 1959\n\nReferences\n\nISBN links support NWE through referral fees\n\nConrad, Earl.
