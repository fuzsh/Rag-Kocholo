Showing an early aptitude for acting, he made his first appearance, aged just nine years, as a page boy to Enid Lyons (an Australian politician, she was the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman to serve in the federal cabinet) in a Queen carnival (a fund-raising event). By 1924 Errol had been sent to a private boarding school in London, England, where he remained for two years. After he returned to Australia, he attended the Sydney Church of England Grammar School (\"Shore\"), from which he was expelled for theft.\n\nAfter a brief stint as a junior clerk in Sydney, at age 18 he tried his hand at tobacco planting and gold mining in the Morobe Goldfield, to Papua New Guinea. He spent the next several years between New Guinea and Sydney.\n\nIn 1932 his acting career began in earnest when he played the part of Fletcher Christian in Charles Chauvel's film In the Wake of the Bounty.\n\nIn 1933 he went to England where he acted with the Northampton Repertory Company until signing a contract with Warner Brothers. After Murder at Monte Carlo, he moved to California, where he shot to stardom in 1935 as the swashbuckling hero in Captain Blood. He made about sixty films in his heyday as one of Hollywood's most handsome actors. The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Charge of the Light Brigade, The Dawn Patrol, The Prince and the Pauper, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, and The Sea Hawk are some of his more famous films. He was granted American citizenship in 1942. In his later years he lived mostly aboard his schooner Zaca.\n\nErrol passed away, aged just fifty years, on 14th October 1959 at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nSources\n\nWilliam Bryden, Flynn, Theodore Thomson (1883–1968), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, First published in hardcopy 1981\n\nTCM Bio\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #349 Errol Flynn\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia: Errol Flynn\n\nWikidata: Item Q93188, en:Wikipedia\n\n\"THE WEEK-END IN SYDNEY\" (1930, February 17).
