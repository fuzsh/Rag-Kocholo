        "text": "When Beverly Aadland was only two years old in 1944, her mother, Florence, was priming her for a career in show business by enrolling her in voice lessons. She already had been an Ivory Soap baby at six months old.\n\nThe Aadlands lived in Hermosa Beach, first on the corner of Manhattan Avenue and Sixteenth Street, and later on Monterey Boulevard. Florence was a retired show girl-turned-manicurist, and Beverly’s father Herbert was a bartender.\n\nBeverly’s schooling in the performing arts continued during her childhood. At 3, she was doing (very early) television commercials and by six, she was taking drama lessons.\n\nShe was much in demand at Hermosa Beach events. In a 1959 Daily Breeze story, she said, “I was queen of the aquaplane races when I was 4 and again when I was 5. I think I cut the ribbon when they opened the Hermosa Beach Aquarium (in 1947)…and I sang ‘God Bless America’ at the Hermosa Biltmore. I was sort of a sponsor for the city. The mayor (Paul H. Drake) was crazy about me.”\n\nFlorence Aadland had been a dancer in the chorus line in vaudeville, and her daughter reportedly spent a brief time in a Las Vegas chorus line at 14. Her ability to pass for older than she really was would get her into hot water soon enough.\n\nIn 1957, Aadland was 15 and working as a dancer on the Warner Bros. Studios lot in the film “Marjorie Morningstar” in a scene with Gene Kelly when Errol Flynn sent a messenger over from a nearby set where was working, asking her to read for a part in a play.\n\nHe thought she was 18, and thus began a relationship that would scandalize Hollywood and generate worldwide headlines.\n\nThe debonair Flynn had crammed a lot of living into his wildy successful acting career. He was only 48 when they met, but Aadland ended up being the last woman of the many in his life.\n\nHe gave her a starring role in his final film, “Cuban Rebel Girls,” in which Flynn plays a correspondent in Havana trying to help Fidel Castro to overthrow the Batista regime. (Castro succeeded in toppling Batista’s regime in 1959.)\n\nCommenters and critics have described the film as among the worst movies ever made by a major star, due to its amateurish nature, low-quality production values and, with the exception of Flynn, almost completely nonprofessional cast. Aadland’s performance failed to garner her much critical praise.\n\nBut Aadland and Flynn had fallen in love, and she later told one of her husbands that the actor was the love of her life and she would have stayed with him had he not died suddenly.\n\nFlynn died from heart failure in Vancouver, Canada on Oct. 14, 1959, several months after the couple had returned from filming in Cuba. Aadland was in the other room when it happened, but her attempts to revive him failed.\n\nIt was only the first shock of what would be a tempestuous time for Aadland.\n\nUpon Flynn’s death, the world learned that Aadland really was only 17 years old, and that Flynn had first romanced her when she was 15. Every Hollywood gossip magazine jumped on the story of Flynn’s underage paramour.\n\nShe held a press conference announcing that she would not attend Flynn’s funeral because “I want to remember him as he was.”\n\nAn inquest was held into charging Beverly’s mother for contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allowing the relationship with Flynn to continue, but it was halted when Beverly refused to testify against her mother.\n\nThe sensational headlines continued in 1960. On April 10, one of Aadland’s suitors, aspiring actor William Stanciu, 20, was shot in the head with his own gun after pushing\n\nhis way into the apartment Aadland shared with her mother. The circumstances of the shooting remain unclear more than 50 years later; Aadland may or may not have pulled the trigger. Her story changed several times. Ultimately, she claimed there was a struggle for the gun, which then went off while in her hand. Stanciu died the next day from the wound.\n\nAfter this incident, authorities ruled that Beverly was not receiving proper guardianship from her mother, and made her a ward of the juvenile court system. She spent more than a year under the guardianship of Mrs. Frances Eilers, even after she turned 18.\n\nThe guardianship ended five months after Beverly married draftsman Jose DeLeon in June 1961. Her mother eventually was convicted on four counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in July 1961.\n\nFlorence Aadland was placed on three years probation, and spent 80 days in jail in 1963 for failure to pay a fine related to the case. Her daughter Beverly had just left her room after a visit when her mother died on May 9, 1955 at the age of 55, after being admitted to the hospital for cirrhosis of the liver and intestinal bleeding.\n\nIn the years that followed, Beverly would divorce DeLeon and pursue various show business careers, including singing. She was performing in the San Fernando Valley club the Black Bull when the Associated Press wrote a “Where are they now?” article on her in 1967.\n\nAadland was working as a cocktail waitress when she met auto parts executive Ronald Fisher in 1970. They were married for 40 years, living mostly in the Lancaster area until her death from diabetes and heart failure at Lancaster Community Hospital on Jan. 5, 2010.\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Breeze files.\n\n“The Death Of Errol Flynn And His Under-Age Girlfriend Beverly Aadland,” Anorak website, http://www.anorak.co.uk/381418/celebrities/the-death-of-errol-flynn-and-his-under-age-girlfriend-beverly-aadland.html/.\n\n“Errol Flynn’s Pretty Baby,” by Beverly Aadland, People magazine, Oct. 17, 1988.\n\nFootnotes on the Sand, by Patricia A.
