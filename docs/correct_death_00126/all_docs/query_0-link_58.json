        "text": "(1909–59). Australian actor Errol Flynn was celebrated during his short but colorful lifetime as the screen’s foremost swashbuckler.\n\nErrol Leslie Thomson Flynn was born on June 20, 1909, in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. He was the son of a prominent Australian marine biologist and zoologist. As such, he was sent to the best schools available—and was expelled from virtually all of them. Flynn’s restless, rebellious nature carried over into his early adulthood, as he unsuccessfully pursued such professions as government official, plantation overseer, gold miner, and journalist. In 1933 an Australian film producer saw some photographs of Flynn and offered the ruggedly handsome 24-year-old the role of the mutineer Fletcher Christian in the semidocumentary feature In the Wake of the Bounty. Encouraged by this experience to pursue acting as a career, Flynn joined England’s Northampton Repertory Company, which led to a few roles in British films and ultimately to a contract with Warner Brothers Pictures in Hollywood, California. When Robert Donat dropped out of the title role in the expensive adventure film Captain Blood (1935), Warners took a chance on Flynn, thereby assuring stardom for him. Typecast as a dashing, fearless adventurer, he went on to star in such colorful costume dramas as The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and The Sea Hawk (1940) and in such big-budget westerns as Dodge City (1939) and They Died with Their Boots On (1941). Unable to serve in World War II because of various physical ailments, Flynn instead acted the part of a soldier in such films as Desperate Journey (1942) and Objective, Burma! (1945).\n\nAlmost as soon as he arrived in Hollywood, Flynn established a reputation as an irrepressible drinker, carouser, and womanizer. Inevitably, his self-indulgence caught up with him; in his later Hollywood films he appeared haggard, distracted, and far older than his years. He also lost a great deal of money in a variety of ill-advised business ventures and headed to England and Europe in hopes of revitalizing his film career."
