        "text": "Errol Flynn was so well-endowed that he entertained Hollywood partygoers by playing \"You Are My Sunshine\" on the piano-using only his organ. Piano.gif\n\nI feel so inadequate. I can just about play ’Happy Birthday’ with one finger…\n\nThe story of Erroll Flynn’s Demise….Warts and All!......\n\nThe story of what happened with Errol Flynn's body and \"the coroner that tampered with his cold, lifeless venereal warts\" is well worth recounting. Flynn flew into Vancouver, British Columbia on October 9, 1959 to solidify the sale of his yacht, the Zaca, to a wealthy stooge named George Caldough. Errol was fifty years old and some Vancouver journalists described him as having \"the body of an 80-year old man.\" Ruth Pinkus of the Vancouver Sun fancied herself a snide columnist in the Hedda Hopper tradition. She stood on the airport tarmac as Flynn descended the airplane staircase with teenage lover Beverly Aadland. As Flynn approached the hoards of microphones, Pinkus jumped in and contemptuously asked why he was always surrounded by young girls. Errol shot her a vicious look and explained, \"Because they **** so good.\"\n\nFlynn had been feeling ill for several days. October 14, he was headed back to the airport, but asked Caldough and his wife to instead immediately find him a doctor. Caldough went to the Sylvia Hotel to get the house doctor Grant Gould, cousin of piano virtuoso Glenn Gould. They were told to bring Errol to the doctor's apartment at 1310 Burnaby Street. True to Flynn's character, he held court in the doctor's home, entertaining, doing impressions, and consuming a great deal of liquor - as did everyone else. He wasn't feeling much better, however, and complained of aggravating back pain. He went to lay flat on the floor of an adjoining room. Beverly Aadland went to check on him some twenty minutes later. He had turned blue. He couldn't speak. Dr. Gould attempted chest thrusts to no avail. An ambulance was called. Shortly before the paramedics arrived, Dr. Gould pronounced Errol Flynn dead.\n\nGlen McDonald of Vancouver's coroner court remembers that he was \"about to leave [the] office when the telephone rang ... I was looking forward to a gin and tonic ... It was the dispatcher from Metropolitan Ambulance ... 'Mac, we've got a beauty for you.\" McDonald has told the story many times. It is the thing of local legend, and no matter how emphatic the retelling, it is nearly impossible to convince someone of its validity. Easy to dismiss as urban legend, the conservative timbre of Coroner McDonald makes it far more difficult to doubt. \"The Vancouver City Police report ... managed to spell the celluloid hero's name wrong ... The news media and everyone else were on the phone ... The calls were fast and furious by now ... Even the night janitor was talking to The New York Times ... [Flynn's] face was sallow and a bit puffy and he looked an awful lot older than fifty years. He looked worn out, wasted ... The autopsy concluded that the death was due to \"myocardial infarction, coronary thrombosis, coronary atherosclerosis, fatty degeneration of the liver, portal cirrhosis of the liver and diverticulosis of the colon ... The belongings found on his person were itemized and bagged: eighty dollars, a credit card, cigarette lighter, a ring and a gold watch that was monogrammed.\"According to Buster Wiles, Flynn's stuntman, confidant, and the one who had to claim both his body and belongings, the lighter was engraved with a picture of a couple \"in a 69 love embrace.\"\n\nWhat followed next is something straight out of Ripley's Believe it or Not. \"An observation [Chief Pathologist] Dr. Tom Harmon made startled me. It concerned a number of VD warts on the end of Flynn's penis. Tom seemed fascinated. 'Well, Tom,' I said, 'They may be of clinical interest to you as a medical man, but there's going to be another autopsy done down in Los Angeles. I really don't think these warts are material to the case. Unless you disagree.' 'Perhaps not ... But, look, I'm going to be lecturing at the Institute of Pathology and I just thought it might be of interest if I could remove these things and fix them in formaldehyde and use them as a visual aid.' 'No way!' I said. 'We're not going to do that. I don't want anything done that isn't relevant to the case because we're really in the limelight tonight. We're on the hot seat. How can we send Mr. Flynn back to his wife with part of his bloody endowment missing?' So I insisted on absolutely no change or variation of routine procedures ... I left Doc Harmon and Errol Flynn alone in the autopsy room ... the telephones were still ringing like mad ... The night janitor had become an expert of evading questions ... Doc Harmon strolled casually into my office, 'Well, I've finished,' he said. Tom and I went back to the autopsy room and the first thing I noticed was that the VD warts had gone - vanished from the end of Mr. Flynn's penis. Then I spotted a jar of formaldehyde on a shelf that looked suspiciously like it might contain VD warts. It did.\n\n\"Oh, God! Tom had gone and done it. I sighed and asked the Doc, 'Did you have to remove those bloody warts ... Did Errol Flynn expire because he had warts on his dong?' Tom looked sheepish but we were both laughing at the utter silliness of the whole thing. 'Put them back,' I said, 'Right now!' Maybe the Doc had never seen warts of that enormity. Maybe he wanted a souvenir. I never did figure out why the temptation had been too great ... So the bloody warts were fished out of the formaldehyde jar and, using the good offices of scotch tape, Doc Harmon and I stuck them back where they belonged. Everything was back to normal. And I was relieved to learn later, talking with the Chief Coroner in Los Angeles, that a further autopsy was performed and the results concurred in every respect with what we had found. The scotch tape was never mentioned.\"\n\nSources\n\nBackstage Vancouver\n\nby Greg Potter (2004, Harbour)\n\nHow Come I'm Dead by Glen McDonald (1985, Hancock House)\n\nArticle by Listener Kliph Nesteroff\n\nThanks for all that Davey.\n\nWhat an interesting character he was, he was always my favourite movie Star in those days.\n\nI was on the TILAPA in Port Antonio in 1954, We sailed into the lagoon and on the right was Naval Island owned by Flynn, with the Zaca alongside the jetty. We tied up opposite on the Banana wharf.\n\nAs we were lowering the gangway, up comes Flynn. He asked us if we could get any Scotch Whisky, as it was in very short supply in those days, Most if not all Scotch was exported to the USA for dollar earnings.Only nine years after WW2.\n\nWe told him it was a dry ship and we had not even had a beer in over two weeks.\n\nThen The Captain came down from the bridge and Flynn asked the Captain for Whisky.\n\nHe was a real bible thumper and anti drink. `Get off my ship` he shouted.\n\nSo Flynn , on the gangway said , `What time do you finish, ` we told him 5pm so he said `I will send the boat over and you can have a drink over on the Zaca,` At 6pm, The boat came over, he had a Puerto Rican Crew then, and over we went. What a beautiful yacht it was seen nothing like it, very luxurious.\n\nWe were served Rum and cokes and had a real good time. chatting to him. He told us of his Court\n\nappearances when he was charged with Raping a couple of young ladies on his yacht.\n\nHe said the girls used to throw themselves at him, he would sail them around the West Indies for a week or two then throw them ashore. They always wanted money off him for services rendered, but they had a couple of weeks free vacation so they were even, They then shout Rape.\n\nHe got away with it when one young lady said Flynn pushed her onto the bed and had his way with her. He showed us the Bed. it was nearly four feet high with four rows of drawers underneath. A bunk.\n\nCase dismissed.\n\nI was in Curacao on the Auris when it was announced on the radio that Flynn had died, he was with Beverley Aadland, 15 years old at the time, he was also married to Patricia Wymore another movie star at the time. I think she was in the Movie, `They Died With Their Boots On`, with him.\n\nIn that link it says that Flynn took his yacht ZACA to Palma, Majorca in 1959, He was there in 1957 because I saw him again and had a few drinks with him and nearly missed the ship, the Valdivia, one of MacAndrews, The Captain went berserk with me until he saw Flynn waving to me from the jetty.He had been making a movie `The Sun Also Rises` in Spain. He was not the same Flynn of three years previous, he had aged considerably and his face was bloated with booze.\n\nI liked him , He had lived a life a lot of Seamen had when ashore with a few bob in the back pocket, Booze and girls. He had it all the time. and it caught up with him fast.\n\nRIP Flynn.\n\nCheers\n\nBrian."
