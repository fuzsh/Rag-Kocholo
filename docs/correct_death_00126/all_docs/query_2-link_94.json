        "text": "Castle, Portland:\n\nRetired American actress, Patrice Wymore Flynn, widow of Hollywood legend Errol Flynn, passed away on Saturday at her plantation home at Castle in east Portland.\n\nFlynn, 86, took up residence in Jamaica following the death of her husband and was an active community member. She was inspirational in paving the way for the Boston Jerk Festival to return to the community of Boston, which is renowned internationally for its authentic jerked pork.\n\nLast year, during the second staging of the Boston Jerk Festival, which made a grand return in 2012, Flynn was made a lifetime member and a director of the festival.\n\nPaul 'Bigga' Young, chairman of the festival committee, in bemoaning the loss of Flynn, described her as a warm and friendly person who, despite her age, was full of energy and fire.\n\n\"She was someone that could easily be approached for just about anything,\" commented Young. \"What I particularly liked about her is that she doesn't beat around the bush. Once she has given a commitment, it is always honoured by her. No doubt, the next staging of the Boston Jerk Festival will be done in her memory.\"\n\nYesterday, Daryl Vaz, member of Parliament for West Portland, said Flynn would not only be remembered for her philanthropic spirit, but also for her tireless efforts to put Portland on the world map.\n\nPolice sources have revealed that the former actress died peacefully at home, shortly after 4:30 p.m., where she has been ailing for sometime after injuring herself during a fall in 2013.\n\nBorn in Kansas, she is survived by her grandson, Luke."
