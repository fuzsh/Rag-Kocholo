        "text": "Steve Cvitkovich, who in October of 1959 was a bartender at the Sylvia Hotel in Vancouver’s west end, died at the age of 94 years old.\n\nIt was at the hotel’s lounge “The Tilting Room” where he met and served actor Errol Flynn the day before his untimely death in Vancouver on October 14, 1959.\n\nThe son of immigrants from Croatia, Steve was their first child born in Canada. His parents, Anton and Kata, were from Udbina, Lika.\n\nHis first language was Croatian. Conceived in Croatia and born in Canada, he would visit the lands of Croatia for the first time in 1969 after the death of his parents.\n\nHe grew up in Vancouver’s east end where his mother ran a boarding house. His father was an itinerant miner and was often away from home working at mines across Canada and the USA.\n\nThe depression years of the 1930’s and then the war years of the 1940’s was hardscrabble for the family who often found refuge at the movies. They loved action/adventure and swashbuckler movies. Steve’s favourite actors were Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Errol Flynn.\n\nCvitkovich worked many jobs during his life including commercial fisherman, dockworker, grain worker and limousine driver. But it was his work as a bartender that was the through line of his career.\n\nBeginning as a bar porter in 1947 he would work at some of Vancouver’s most exclusive establishments including the Sylvia Hotel and the Panorama Roof at the Hotel Vancouver.\n\nBut he was an equal opportunity bartender and his journey took him to an assortment of beer parlours, Legions, pubs and lower-level lounges. But it was the encounter with Flynn that would be his most memorable moment.\n\nFlynn, the Australian-American actor, had been a screen superstar in the 1930’s and 40’s starring in classics like “The Adventures of Robin Hood” and “Captain Blood”. But by 1959 his star had dimmed considerably.\n\nHe had been plagued by personal scandals, health challenges and financial difficulties. He was in Vancouver to sell his beloved yacht Zaca when Cvitkovich served him at the Tilting Room.\n\nFlynn was at the bar for hours where he regaled patrons with assorted stories and anecdotes. He also drank heavily but in Cvitkovich’s words “he could hold his liquor”. He was drinking gin, over ice. At one point he asked that the gin and ice be served in a Royal Doulton teapot.\n\nThe next day, planning to leave Vancouver, Flynn would experience extreme pain and would eventually succumb to a heart attack. He was 50 years old.\n\nCvitkovich was very involved in the Croatian community in Vancouver and North America. He was a 50-year member of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America and would serve a term on their international Board of Trustees; he was a founding member of the Croatian Cultural Centre in Vancouver; he was a member of the uprava of the Croatian Sports Club in Vancouver; a lifelong member of Hrvatska Seljačka Stranka and; a member of Society of Friends of Matica Hrvatska among others.\n\nHe would continue to work intermittently at bars until retiring “for good” in 2005 although he could be coaxed behind the bar at charity or family events. He died of Pulmonary failure and is survived by his wife of 67 years Joan (née Bateman), three children, nine grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren (and counting).\n\nLater in life when asked about his encounter with Flynn he would reflect sadly that his hero had died too young. He would always finish the recollection with the advice “don’t drink gin.”\n\nSteve Cvitkovich June 7 1929 Vancouver – December 20, 2023 Vancouver"
