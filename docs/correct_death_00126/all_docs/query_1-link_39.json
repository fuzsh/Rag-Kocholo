        "text": "KINGSTON, Jamaica - Patrice Wymore Flynn, a Hollywood actress and cattle rancher who was the widow of swashbuckling screen legend Errol Flynn, has died at her seaside home in Jamaica. She was 87.\n\nOn Monday, family spokesman Robb Callahan said Flynn died Saturday at her home in Jamaica's Portland parish after battling pulmonary disease.\n\nDuring her film career, she worked alongside actors such as Doris Day, Kirk Douglas and Randolph Scott. She played Frank Sinatra's girlfriend in the original \"Ocean's 11\" in 1960.\n\nThe Kansas-born actress met her future husband when she was cast as the female lead in the 1950 western \"Rocky Mountain.\" They spent much of their nine-year marriage in Jamaica. He died in 1959.\n\nFor decades, Wymore lived on the 2,000-acre Errol Flynn Estates cattle ranch in Jamaica."
