        "text": "A few months ago, my course entitled Elearning Essentials: Instructional Design released on the LinkedIn Learning (LIL) library. With the release of each course I have worked on as a Content Producer, I usually feel a combination of excitement and relief. Excitement because we are providing a vehicle for people to acquire new knowledge and skills. And relief because we crossed the finish line.\n\nNow with the release of my own course, the feeling was a little different. In addition to being excited, I began to get a little existential about it.\n\nIn the course, I am essentially teaching how to teach while teaching. It's very meta, right? Whoever said \"those who can't do, teach\" ha, the joke is on you!\n\nHaving led numerous Professional Development sessions on educational technology pedagogy and instructional digital tools and having produced numerous courses for the LIL library, I figured authoring a course on instructional design would be a breeze. I mean, I am just practicing what I am preaching, right? Well, now the joke was on me.\n\nAs I was creating the course, I kept bumping up against some core beliefs and teaching philosophies that I usually preach. Here are three unexpected areas I ran into and ways I worked through them:\n\n1) 'Walking the walk' can actually be tricky.\n\nOne of my instructional design tips involving inclusion is not to use jargon or cliches so as not to alienate a global audience who may speak a different language. However, as I am teaching, I want to connect with my learners. Stay cool, casual and most of all authentic. Throwing in a silly saying or making a pun (especially puns!) is something that comes natural to me. So, how do you balance not letting things get lost in translation while actually emulating your true voice?\n\nI found that breaking down the meaning of what I wanted to say and simplifying it worked in most cases. For example, something I find myself saying \"this is not my first rodeo\" in every day conversations. In my course, instead I say \"this is not my first time doing this\". Maybe not as funny but same point made and I did not lose anyone.\n\n2) Being in front of people is easy, being in front of a camera is not.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned experience with in-person training, a childhood theater background, and generally being outgoing, public speaking has never been a big deal to me. I don't get nervous and I only worry that what I am presenting or teaching will be understandable and have an impact. So, what's the difference in doing that in front of a camera?\n\nWhen I present, I really engage with my audience. I pick-up on their cues, make eye contact, assess their engagement and ask a lot of questions. When this dynamic is removed, it feels like 50% of the experience vanishes.\n\nAnd then, the more I read the words on a teleprompter, the more they start sounding crazy (say \"about\" 5 times in a row and get back to me). In-person, if I stumble and slur and mispronounce words, I tell myself it's part of the excitement of witnessing a live presentation. But in front of the camera, it has to be perfect. And perfect, I am not.\n\nOf course, when I am producing, I have told others in front of the camera to \"breathe\", to \"just talk to us\" (aka the people behind the camera that can not be seen due to the blinding lights you are staring into), and to \"practice before coming into the studio\". All words of advice that I was karmically kicking myself for not following when I was now in the hot seat. But when I did take that breath and imagined my learner right in front of me, it did get easier. It's a practice I am still going to work on.\n\n3) As soon as my course was published, it would be outdated.\n\nAs I was writing the content, I wanted to make it fresh, forward-thinking, and cutting edge. But about half way through, I realized that my course would be like buying a new car. No matter how new and shiny, it depreciates as soon as you pull out of the lot.\n\nSo, to avoid my course depreciation, instead of focusing on the latest technology and tools, I focused on the pedagogy, the timeless methods and approaches such as how you build engagement and ownership around learning. These are practices I have developed over my years in this field and could be applied to any technology or tools for years to come.\n\nThrough all these moments, one constant remained true in developing the course and that was the desire to create a meaningful and tangible learning experience for all who took the course. And for me, as a life time learner, I get to keep learning as I am teaching how to teach. Now that's a full circle!"
