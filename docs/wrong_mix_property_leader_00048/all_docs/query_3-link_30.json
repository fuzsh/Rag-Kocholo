From soldiers to scientists, cyber experts to civilian emergency responders, NATO members are committed to supporting and protecting each other. Captain ‘Alexis’, a French fighter pilot, flies the Mirage 2000 fighter jet and served with NATO’s Baltic Air Policing Mission out of Ämari Air Base in Estonia. His mission was to secure the Baltic skies from any airspace infringements or violations. The air policing mission keeps fighter jets on alert 24/7 and ready to scramble in case of suspicious air activity close to the Alliance’s borders. Learn what motivates him and what it takes to fly an aircraft that can go more than twice the speed of sound. Footage includes various shots of Captain ‘Alexis’ preparing to scramble and shots of French Mirage 2000 aircraft in flight over the Baltic states. SCRIPT: (French) Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “I believe the most important quality for a fighter pilot to have is humility.” “There are times when what you’re doing really hits home, when you look out and realise how lucky you are to be in this type of aircraft.” Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “I think the air policing mission is essential because obviously every country wants to ensure the sovereignty of its airspace. “It is important to be present and ready at all times to execute the mission, so that other aircraft that want to enter are aware that the airspace is not free but controlled. Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “I would describe myself as a calm person, able to keep a cool head even in relatively stressful situations. I am also competitive. I like this kind of pressure during flights.” Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “What I appreciate most about being a fighter pilot is the sense of cohesion and brotherhood with the squadron and other pilots from all over the world, knowing that you are part of the same family, an exclusive group that shares things that are only possible if you do this job.” Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “When you fly a fighter jet that can go more than twice the speed of sound, you of course have a feeling of power because you are in control of a plane that can do incredible things. But you also feel a great sense of responsibility.” Cpt ‘Alexis’ – Pilot, NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission “For me, being part of NATO means being able to help other countries that do not have the same means as us, not turning your back on threats or adversity and doing your best to accept and rise to all challenges.” show less\n\n07/28/2020\n\nThe Romanian pilot flying for the Strategic Airlift Capability programme (MASTER)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nMeet Lieutenant Commander Simona Maierean, a pilot with the NATO-supported Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme.

I’m from Romanian Air Force and currently I’m a pilot in the Strategic Airlift Capability programme.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Lieutenant Commander Simona Maierean, Pilot, Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) “SAC involves 12 nations and they share this fleet of three aircraft to fly different missions all over the world.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Lieutenant Commander Simona Maierean, Pilot, Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) “If a normal mission takes a few weeks, these emergency response missions can take two or three days to plan it and to launch it so of course the tempo changed a lot.” “I’ve personally flown Romanian emergency response missions. We brought some medical equipment from South Korea into Bucharest. They really needed that equipment. You don’t have that much time to prepare it and to plan it in advance, so we have to work quickly and use your experience.

Teaser Learn how NATO helped an Italian start-up with their innovation to fight COVID-19. Transcript AUDIO DESCRIPTION --MUSIC-- --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Cristian Fracassi – CEO, Isinnova “We had to find a solution to help hospitals, to give them more masks so we had this idea to convert a traditional snorkelling mask into a respiratory one.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Alessandro Romaioli – Engineer, Isinnova “We redesign and 3D print this kind of product. It’s called a ‘Charlotte valve’. Its goal is to connect the mask to the oxygen and through the filter, the expiration of the patient cannot influence the doctors and other patients.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Alessandro Romaioli – Engineer, Isinnova “We wouldn’t be able to produce, all by ourselves, a lot of Charlotte valves, but NATO asked us ‘do you need our help? We can offer you for free of course our 3D printer to print products for you, to distribute to all the hospitals that are in need of it. --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— Enzo Rondinelli, NATO Support and Procurement Agency “I think now it’s very important that we work all together, all NATO countries, all institutions from all over the world, and we share our knowledge, our capabilities, to beat this virus.” show less\n\n05/19/2020\n\nIsolation tips from a former astronaut and retired US Air Force colonel (Master)\n\nSynopsis\n\nA former space shuttle astronaut uses his experience in space to give tips on how best to cope during isolation.

Transcript —SOUNDBITE—(ENGLISH) Colonel Greg Johnson, former space shuttle astronaut “I’m Greg Johnson, retired Air Force colonel and former astronaut. I’ve got a few ideas that helped in space and help us in our lockdown here on the Earth.” “It might be a good idea for you to look at your situation, and it might be radically changed from your normal routine, and get together so that everybody knows when it’s time to work and when it’s time to play. I recommend creating a distraction-free work zone so that you can be efficient when it’s time to work and then focus on fun when it’s time to do those things.” “We had a little bit of conflict in space. We had a makeshift rock band, while some other guys were doing work and we actually were distracting them. We were not paying attention. I could tell they were a little upset with us about it but they got over it really quickly because there’s no need to escalate conflict. They just let it go and we went on with our jobs.” “We are all in this together. I mean, this pandemic is a great example of how we are all interconnected on this planet, on this spaceship Earth. So it’s really important for us to stick together, to get through this, to follow the rules, to take care of each other and take care of our planet.

Ritu Gill from the ‘Digital and Social Media Assessment for Effective Communication and Cyber Diplomacy Research Task Group’, which is part of the NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO), explains how NATO is responding to disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. The STO generates and capitalises on a leading-edge science and technology programme of work, delivering results and advice that advance the defence capabilities of Allies, partners and NATO in support of the three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. The research task group is represented by scientists from NATO Allies Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as from Singapore. This footage includes soundbites from an online interview with Dr Ritu Gill, Defence Scientist at Defence Research & Development Canada. Teaser Learn how NATO is responding to disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcript AUDIO DESCRIPTION --MUSIC-- --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) — Dr Ritu Gill, Defence scientist, NATO research task group “There is a tonne of disinformation out there and the pandemic serves as a golden platter to be able to use it to put out any narratives.“ --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) — Dr Ritu Gill, Defence scientist, NATO research task group “In essence we see that it represents the first major global health event in which digital platforms are playing a critical role in the dissemination of information, which includes disinformation and misinformation.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) — Dr Ritu Gill, Defence scientist, NATO research task group “In the information environment we see that there is an anti-West, anti-NATO narrative. Not all disinformation merits a response so ignoring it can actually be very effective because it doesn’t give that piece of disinformation attention, traction and credibility.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) — Jens Stoltenberg, NATO Secretary General “I believe that the best response to disinformation and propaganda is free and independent press, is the work of journalists. When they ask the difficult questions, then disinformation and propaganda will never succeed.” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) — Dr Ritu Gill, Defence scientist, NATO research task group “The purpose of our research task group is to examine how digital platforms impact influence operations, so in this particular case it would be helping to identify the actors that propagate disinformation, identifying where the dominant narratives are in the information environment and importantly, developing counter strategies to effectively combat disinformation building up an audience’s resilience to disinformation.” --END-- show less\n\n05/13/2020\n\nMarried to the Navy: María’s story (Master)\n\nMarried to the Navy: María’s story (WITH SUBS)\n\n11 May 2020 09:05\n\nSynopsis\n\nMaría knew how her life was going to be when she married Juan, a Lieutenant in the Spanish Navy.

We knew a little about what our lives were going to be like, that I was going to have to put my career second for a little while, in order to keep up with everything that life in the Navy brings. I'm lucky, there are a lot of women here and we all support each other a lot, and we're all in the same boat. “Whenever the kids ask where dad is, I always tell them that he's on the boat and will be back in a little while.” Each time they leave, missing each other seems fundamental to me in any relationship. It's like you're dating again and you get nervous when you’re going to see each other. “ SOUNDBITE in Spanish Lt Juan Chicharro Sánchez-Agustino, Spanish Navy “Finally, coming home and seeing your wife and children again, I think it's one of the best feelings any man can experience. “ “Now we have to make the most of our time together before the next mission and enjoy ourselves as much as possible.

Teaser Extreme weather events have an effect on our planet and our security. How is NATO responding? Transcript AUDIO DESCRIPTION SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Michael Rühle, Head, NATO Energy Security “They affect NATO’s core tasks in many ways. Crisis management, for example, which is a major task of NATO, will have to happen under perhaps even more difficult circumstances, in terms of weather, in terms of terrain.” SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Sherri Goodman, Environmental change and security expert, Wilson Center “Our militaries need to be able to undertake greater humanitarian assistance and natural disaster response missions because we’re seeing more extreme weather events and more people put at risk from those storms.” SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Dr Jamie Shea, Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change “NATO can be prepared to use its military capabilities to lend a hand. Why? Because often the military with their logistics, their transport aircraft, can get there faster than anybody else.” SOUNDBITE (GERMAN) Dr Susanne Michaelis, NATO energy security officer “In most cases in natural disasters we have floods, over-flooding. The water is dirty, the victims can’t drink this water, they’ll become sick.” “What we can now build is an energy-efficient drinking water processing plant, which the military can bring with them. Then they’re robust, “soldier-proofed”, they work with photovoltaic panels and they can help the victims much better than a huge military system that needs to be transported around the world and uses lots of energy.” SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Michael Rühle, Head, NATO Energy Security “We are trying to make sure, for example, that certain camps can be deployed in such a way that they use less and less diesel fuel, that we use renewables, that we use solar, wind. We use modern computer technology to get the optimal distribution of power within a camp, so that the overall ecological footprint is much, much lower.” SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Sherri Goodman, Environmental change and security expert, Wilson Center “An alliance like NATO and other militaries also around the world have very important roles to play since they are premier planning organisations and one of the best ways we will combat climate change is to make our societies in all its dimensions more resilient to those effects.” SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Michael Rühle, Head, NATO Energy Security “Since the 1970s, NATO has an environmental policy for military operations. In other words, if you go into a region and you put up a camp, let’s say, then you have to follow very strict environmental standards, because the military should not be seen as a polluter.” “NATO is not in the business of conducting climate policies. However, the very fact that we’re looking at this issue for quite a long time and the very fact that we look at it from various dimensions shows that NATO is prepared to defend its Allies under whatever conditions.” #END# show less\n\n04/22/2020\n\nRussia’s top 5 myths about NATO and COVID-19 Master\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn our common fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, facts and information from trusted sources are more important than ever.

NATO is supporting Allies - facilitating the airlift of crucial medical supplies and equipment, matching requests for support with offers from Allies and partners, and delivering innovative responses. As confirmed by the World Health Organization, all available evidence suggests that the coronavirus causing COVID-19, has a natural origin in animals and is not a constructed virus. NATO has implemented robust measures to limit the spread of the virus and minimise risks to our personnel. Some NATO and Allied exercises have been modified or cancelled, and these are sensible precautions. In times of crisis, our troops can play a vital public role. It’s important we continue to invest in our armed forces, not at the expense of public health, but to keep our people and our nations safe. show less\n\n04/16/2020\n\nNATO Science: The Next-Generation Incident Command System (master)\n\n--SYNOPSIS--\n\nWhen first responders come together in an international disaster response force, they need to share information quickly – between military and civilians, and across borders and languages.

NATO has supported the adaptation of a software platform in the Western Balkans, in which maps, videos and pictures can all be shared in real time. It’s called the Next-Generation Incident Command System, or NICS for short, and has been developed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States. The system has been put to use in managing wildfires in California and Australia, and is being deployed across the Western Balkans. In this episode of NATO Science, we travel to Montenegro, where NATO scientists conduct live trials of the system in a simulated emergency situation. Footage includes NICS creator Gregg Hogan explaining how the system works, as well as various shots of the NICS system in use, firefighters from various countries battling barrel fires as part of an exercise scenario, shots of the exercise command centre, and Montenegrin aeroplanes dousing water on simulated bushfires. Please note that exercise footage does not include typical COVID-19 precautions because filming took place before the pandemic. --TRANSCRIPT-- SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Dylan White Oh, hi! If you get your updates from one of these, you’ll know how fast information flows. For first responders, quick access to that information can save lives. How? NATO Science! THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION Presents NATO SCIENCE THE NEXT-GENERATION INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM WITH DYLAN P. WHITE SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Dylan White Emergencies don’t respect borders. So when first responders need to communicate across countries and organisations, they need a simple system that works quickly. Our scientists have come up with a handy solution. Project: Next-Generation Incident Command System Participants: United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia Supported by the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme Gregory Hogan, Programme Manager, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, United States SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Gregg Hogan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Lincoln Laboratory One of the fundamental problems of any kind of disaster response, firefighting, floods, earthquakes, is that many organisations come together that normally don’t work together, so they don’t always know how to communicate or collaborate. We developed a software platform where everybody can join together and develop ways to share information that they normally don’t know how to share. Maps, videos, pictures, all in real time. We call it the Next-Generation Incident Command System, or NICS for short. SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Dylan White Snappy name, but how does it work? SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Gregg Hogan At the core of NICS is the incident map that displays key information such as incident perimeters, evacuation zones, weather conditions, responder locations and images from the scene. Emergency personnel upload the content directly using either a web-based system or a mobile app. There’s even online spaces where responders can chat with each other in real time. Severe storm warning for local evac. Evac locations updated… please proceed with caution Image uploaded – Evac ETA 15 mins SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH) Gregg Hogan The system has been successfully put to use in the United States, including to help fight wildfires in Californaia, and has been adopted by emergency services in the state of Victoria in Australia, where it has helped more than 1000 firefighters battle over 50 bushfires. With support from the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme, we are introducing the platform in the Western Balkans, to support regional responses to man-made and natural disasters. We recently tested the system in Montenegro during a NATO exercise that simulated an international response to wildfires, involving more than 250 first responders and experts. Hazards are only disasters if there’s insufficient preparation and communication. NICS goes one step further to helping our first responders better protect our populations.

Our solemn commitment to each other is that an attack against one Ally is an attack against us all. NATO has kept our countries and our people safe by continuously adapting to new security challenges. For 40 years, NATO successfully deterred the Soviet Union from aggression against Western Europe. In the 1990s, we faced new security challenges in Europe and helped to end conflicts in the Western Balkans. After 9/11, NATO took a lead role in the international response in Afghanistan, where we continue to train local forces. Our world is changing and NATO is changing with it. But our commitment to one another endures, giving us the strength to overcome our differences and rise to any challenge. Standing with unity and resolve in defence of our values, NATO will remain a pillar of stability in an uncertain world for the next generations. show less\n\n12/11/2019\n\nNATO Experts – Why is transparency so important to NATO?, Master Version\n\n‘How do you know you can trust NATO?’ Oana Lungescu, NATO Spokesperson, explains why being transparent is vital to an Alliance that protects almost 1 billion people.\n\nNATO’s extensive pool of subject matter experts tell you what you need to know about a wide variety of defense and security issues around the world, and what NATO is doing to make you safer and more secure.

NATO’s extensive pool of subject matter experts tell you what you need to know about a wide variety of defense and security issues around the world, and what NATO is doing to make you safer and more secure. From fighting terrorism, to collective defense, learn about the security issues that matter directly from the experts. “NATO’s job is to protect almost one billion people and that’s why transparency is vital,” says NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu. But in an organization that deals with defense and security, this isn’t always easy. So how does NATO stay transparent? Transcript --SOUNDBITE—(ENGLISH) Oana Lungescu, NATO Spokesperson “How do you know you can trust NATO?” “NATO’s job is to protect almost one billion people and that’s why transparency is vital. NATO is an alliance of democracies where all decisions are taken by consensus of the 29 member countries, which also fund NATO. So people want to understand how their money is spent, what decisions their country takes within NATO and what it all means to their security. But in an organisation that deals with defence and security, transparency doesn’t come easy. Our discussions and documents are classified because they contain sensitive information. And even when documents aren’t classified, they can be hard to decipher because they include so many military abbreviations. Check out this thick book. It’s the NATO glossary of abbreviations. That’s why we have to be transparent in what we do and clear in what we say. Every year, NATO publishes the civilian and military budgets’ totals. NATO also regularly declassifies documents from our archives. Especially at a time when tensions are high, transparency helps increase predictability and reduce risks. On our website you can find the schedule of NATO and national exercises. We live in open societies and more openness makes us stronger. show less\n\n07/12/2019\n\nPatrolling the Mediterranean: NATO Operation Sea Guardian, Master Version\n\nWhat is NATO Operation Sea Guardian?

And how do crews aboard ships from Croatia, Italy and the United Kingdom work together to help secure the Mediterranean? Maritime security is high on NATO’s agenda. In 2016, NATO launched a maritime security operation in the Mediterranean Sea – called Sea Guardian – to deter and counterterrorism and other threats to Allied maritime security. Sea Guardian also provides maritime situational awareness and can carry out tasks to help build naval capacity of NATO partners. NATOChannel boarded the British ship HMS Echo, the Croatian Navy ship HRMV Vukovar and the Italian Navy frigate ITS Espero during the first days of their focused patrols in 2018. Footage includes various shots aboard ITS Espero and HRMV Vukovar, and various shots as crews from both conduct a practice operation boarding HMS Echo as though it were a potentially hostile vessel. Footage also includes various shots of Dutch Special Forces approaching a fishing vessel from a former Sea Guardian rotation.

They form part of a NATO maritime security operation called Sea Guardian. -- SOUNDBITE IN ITALIAN (with English subtitles) -- COMMANDER ALBERTO FIORENTINO, COMMANDING OFFICER, ITS ESPERO “Sea Guardian is a NATO operation aimed at countering terrorism, guaranteeing maritime situational awareness for the Alliance and improving capacity-building with some countries in the Mediterranean basin.” --VOICEOVER-- Falling under NATO’s maritime command, Operation Sea Guardian’s aim is to keep an eye out for illegal activity, monitor maritime traffic and provide a safe and secure environment for ships in the Mediterranean. It is continuously monitoring the Mediterranean Sea, and to date 12 nations have also sent assets such as ships, aircraft and submarines for focused operations. --UPSOT— Commander of Croatian ship --SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH— LIEUTENANT COMMANDER NIKOLA BAŠIÄ, CROATIAN CONTINGENT “This is the first time for the Croatian Navy to participate in a NATO operation.” --VOICEOVER-- Before embarking on the operation, participating nations need to practise working together. Here a British ship poses as a suspect vessel, while a combined team of Croatian and Italian forces plan and execute a boarding exercise. --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- LIEUTENANT COMMANDER NIKOLA BAŠIÄ, CROATIAN CONTINGENT “We conduct several exercises, force protection exercise, manoeuvring exercise and boarding team exercise.” --VOICEOVER— Ensuring maritime security in the Mediterranean is a NATO-wide effort and all NATO units operating throughout the Mediterranean, including Standing NATO Maritime Group Two and Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group Two, with their five minehunters, also contribute to that aim. --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)— COMMANDER JUSTIN HAINS FORMER COMMANDER, STANDING NATO MINE COUNTERMEASURES GROUP 2 “All the time we’re at sea, we’re taking notice of patterns of life around us, and obviously any anomalies, any ships that have dropped off the plot for a few days and miraculously come back, then they would come to our attention and we’ll put special measures in place to make sure we understand where they’ve been and where they’re going.” --VOICEOVER— Providing a full and detailed maritime picture also requires collaboration between NATO and other international partners such as the European Union, whose Operation Sophia runs in tandem with Sea Guardian. --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- CAPTAIN ETTORE SOCCI, EUROPEAN UNION OPERATION SOPHIA “We are exchanging information on our daily activity with naval, air and submarine assets and make best use of the assets at sea.” --VOICEOVER— Operation Sea Guardian is a demonstration of NATO’s commitment to protecting trade routes, countering crime and terrorism and helping monitor maritime traffic. It also forms part of a wider effort to protect the region, which in turn leads to a more secure Europe. show less\n\n07/08/2019\n\nNATO experts – How does NATO make the world safer? - Master Version\n\nHow does NATO make the world safer?

William Alberque, NATO’s top expert on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, reveals all. NATO’s extensive pool of subject matter experts tell you what you need to know about a wide variety of defence and security issues around the world, and what NATO is doing to make you safer and more secure. From fighting terrorism, to collective defence, learn about the security issues that matter, directly from the experts. In this episode, William Alberque, Director of NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre, elaborates on what NATO has achieved in destroying hundreds of thousands of weapons. NATO limits the proliferation of weapons by destroying small arms, clearing landmines and using diplomacy to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This makes the world a less dangerous place and helps guarantee the long-term safety of Allied states. Transcript --SOUNDBITE—(ENGLISH) William Alberque, Director, NATO Arms Control, Disarmament and Weapons of Mass Destruction Non-Proliferation Centre “Arms control helps prevent war and arms races, and with the current world situation, those are pretty important things to do. Disarmament can only happen if we get at the causes of conflict, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the only legitimate way the whole world can work together to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. At the same time, we have to work together every day to eliminate all other weapons of mass destruction, or WMD as we call it, so that no one else will have to face attacks with chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. And we have to get rid of the illicit small arms and light weapons that make the world a more dangerous place. On small arms and light weapons, NATO has destroyed more than 600,000 guns, tens of millions of rounds of ammunition. We’ve cleared hundreds of hectares of landmines, and so much more. Nuclear weapons committed to NATO’s defence have been reduced by more than 95 per cent since the height of the Cold War. And NATO has been involved in the drafting of just about every significant arms control and non-proliferation treaty since the 1960s. Because Allies knew instinctively that its mission was to deter our enemies from attacking us, but that an endless arms race was in no one’s interest. Allies also meet all the time at our Headquarters here in Brussels in more than 10 different dedicated committees, to coordinate policies and implementation of arms control, disarmament and WMD non-proliferation. So arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation is all about making the world safer. It’s just what we do.” END show less\n\n06/13/2019\n\nHow Does NATO Counter Hybrid Threats?, Master Version\n\nHow do NATO Allies train to counter a form of warfare that is difficult to identify and hard to defend against?\n\nHybrid means of warfare – propaganda, deception, sabotage and other non-military tactics – have long been used in lieu of (or sometimes in conjunction with) overt, conventional military action.

Hybrid means of warfare – propaganda, deception, sabotage and other non-military tactics – have long been used in lieu of (or sometimes in conjunction with) overt, conventional military action. In recent years, the use of hybrid tactics has increased in speed, scale and intensity. How does NATO counter this difficult, covert threat? In 2018, Latvia held Exercise Namejs, its largest military maneuver since the restoration of independence in 1991. They practiced responding against what Chief of Defense Lieutenant General LeonÄŤds KalniĹš called a scenario “very, very close to our perception about threats in our region” – that is, a wide-scale disinformation campaign as a prelude to armed conflict. Exercises like Namejs are useful not only for Latvia, but for the Alliance at large, as Allies share hard-won information and best practices.

You’d see a line of soldiers coming across a borderline and you’d know something was up, conflict was underway or there would be a massive explosion and attack. What NATO is grappling with today is so much of it is in the hybrid realm where we don’t know where the borderline is between peace and war, between conflict and war.” –SOUNDBITE— (ENGLISH) Ben Heap, NATO StratCom Centre of Excellence “Hybrid threats are really anything our adversaries can use against us, that would damage our national security. And this is activity that could be overt, so it’s out in the open, or it’s covert, so it’s hidden. And it can be a mix of military and non-military means. So that means disinformation, sabotage, cyber attacks, but includes the use of troops, tanks, etc.” –SOUNDBITE— (ENGLISH) Lt Gen LeonÄŤds KalniĹš, Chief of Defense, Latvia “The scenario was very, very close to our perception about threats in our region. We have to train our soldiers, our leadership, military leadership, to think wider, to be very creative to test our comprehensive defense system looking for support from society, civil society.” –SOUNDBITE— (English) Ben Heap, NATO StratCom Center of Excellence “Disinformation tends to exploit an existing vulnerability. Grievances in different groups, fractures in society. And it tends to be trying to make people who are angry about something more angry, and so angry that they want to go and do something about it. Resilience is all about understanding, as a nation, what is important to you, and what you want to protect. Nations can’t address the security problems of today on their own. Being able to respond quickly to hybrid threats is really all about working together and sharing information, through NATO and through the EU.” show less\n\n04/17/2019\n\nSlovak Special Forces compete in Warrior Competition (master)\n\n--SYNOPSIS--\n\nWelcome to the Warrior Competition, a tournament where counter-terrorism experts from around the world gather to test their skills.

From soldiers to scientists, cyber experts to civilian emergency responders, NATO members are committed to supporting and protecting each other. “Jonny” wanted to fly since he was a boy growing up in the United Kingdom – and luckily, as a Warrant Officer 2 in the British Army, he gets to fly the Apache AH1. Jonny describes what it takes to fly his army’s premier attack helicopter. The British Army deployed Apaches to Estonia in April 2019 to augment NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence Battlegroup, which is led by the United Kingdom. The attack helicopters have practised integrating with multinational forces, participating in multiple exercises. The Apache’s speed, manoeuvrability and payload make it invaluable to ground operations. Teaser Meet Warrant Officer 2 “Jonny”, who flies an Apache AH1 attack helicopter for the British Army and served as part of the NATO’s enhanced Forward Presence Battlegroup in Estonia. Transcript -SOUNDBITE-(ENGLISH) WO2 ‘JONNY’, BRITISH ARMY “I've always wanted to fly, ever since I was a little boy. And an Apache helicopter is something I've always wanted to be a pilot of. Every time you sit in that aircraft, hit the APU [Auxiliary Power Unit] button, hear it fire up, engage your rotors, it’s an exhilarating feeling going flying in one of these. My name is Jonny. I'm a Warrant Officer Class 2, serving in the British Army. I came up from the ranks. I started off as an Air Trooper, so private level in the Army Air Corps. I worked my way through. I most enjoy the feeling of flying. I’ve always wanted to do it. That feeling of being in the air, being in control of where you’re going. Speed, heights. It’s really exhilarating. A good helicopter pilot obviously needs to be quite good with their hands, their motor skills, but you also need to be adaptable, flexible and really just be able to make decisions based on information presented to you very quickly. The difference about flying in the army is you do it as one big team. None of that that flying capability would happen without wider support.” END show less\n\n04/01/2019\n\nBelgian and German Air Force soldiers with the NATO Air Policing mission in the Baltics send Christmas greetings home\n\nGerman soldiers with the German Air Force detachment under the NATO Air Policing mission in the Baltics send Christmas greetings home, along with a group of Belgian soldiers with the Belgian Air Force detachment under the same NATO Air Policing mission.

Meet the men and women who work every day for NATO. From soldiers to scientists, cyber experts to civilian emergency responders, NATO members are committed to supporting and protecting each other. Private First Class Elva Karzova of the Latvian Army talks you through the stages of applying camouflage face paint in a 1-minute video tutorial. Effective use of military camouflage paint means breaking up the visual patterns of the human face – applying dark paint where light hits the face (cheekbones, chin), and light paint where the face is shadowed (eyes). Elva shows you how, with a few fingers of paint, she can blend into her surroundings. Interview in English. TRANSCRIPT: Karzova applying paint --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- Private First Class Elva Karzova, Latvian Land Forces ‘I’m Private First Class Elva Karzova. And this is a camouflage paint tutorial. First colour we put is black. On our forehead, cheek, nose, jawline, because these are the lightest places of the face. Now we’re going on to the green one. With the green one we actually break the contours of the face. Here. The jawline is a really big contour. And maybe a little bit of forehead. We need to break contours because there are no sharp edges in the nature. The main mistake is forgetting your ears and your neck. Next up we go to the brown, to blend everything out. So when you're done, you shouldn't have any white spots on your face. When I've done all this, I can use the environment and my surroundings to my advantage.” show less\n\n09/14/2018\n\nThe silent professionals: NATO’s close protection agents\n\nNATO’s Close Protection Unit is made up of highly skilled and highly trained individuals.

TEXT ON SCREEN NATO CLOSE PROTECTION AGENTS SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH ANON “There are people working at NATO who are doing their best to keep the world safe. Our job is to keep them safe. Often people get the impression that a close protection agent should be a macho type, which is absolutely not the type of person who works in the NATO Close Protection Unit. A close protection agent is trained for a lot of things, and they just need to be ready to be able to do what is expected in normal situations, in tense situations and in situations of a higher risk.” UPSOT “Contact front, contact front!” --SOUNDBITE (ENGLISH)-- ANON “We are constantly developing medical skills, studying and training on weapons, improving our driving skills and communication skills. There are many highly skilled female close protection agents, but unfortunately we don’t have any working in the NATO Close Protection Unit right now. We are actively recruiting for female agents. Working as a close protection agent for NATO is a great privilege. It’s a high-profile environment with high-profile people. You are protecting men and women who are really making an impact on the world.” END Media tags Reference NATO729040 Date filming 02 Apr 2018 12:00 Location Undisclosed Country Undisclosed Usage rights This media asset is free for editorial broadcast, print, online and radio use.

At the origin of this principle lies the Harmel Report, issued in 1967. In the late 1960s, NATO had to find new ways to respond to new challenges. The Berlin crisis had been a reality check for its strategy of massive retaliation and France’s withdrawal from the integrated military structure was a shock to Allied solidarity. There were also fears that NATO would cease to exist since, according to its founding treaty, members could withdraw from the Alliance after 20 years of its existence. Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Pierre Harmel provided a powerful response to this situation with the Harmel Report, issued on 14 December 1967. This report introduced the idea that pursuing a strong defense was not in conflict with pursuing détente with the Soviet Union and that NATO had a role to play in both. This concept has stood the test of time and has become one of NATO’s core principles. In December this year, NATO is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Report. Footage includes interviews with one of the drafters of the Report, Pierre Harmel’s Head of Staff, along with interviews with Harmel’s biographer, one of Pierre Harmel’s sons and the current Belgian Ambassador to NATO.

What use is a strong military if you don’t have a strong message? Russia’s disinformation about Ukraine has permeated worldwide media and the fight back is tougher than ever. NATO experts, Ukrainian politicians and journalists talk about the distinct challenges of fighting a war of words. About the four-part series Ukraine: The Unseen Attacks Fighting in the east has come to characterize Ukraine. But Ukraine’s struggle for survival and self-determination, free of corrupt governments and Russian influence is fought on many other fronts. From cyber defence to internal defence, fixing its forces to telling the truth – Ukraine faces challenges that may determine its very survival. Full script: =VOICEOVER = Fighting in the east has come to characterize Ukraine. But Ukraine’s struggle for survival and self-determination, free of corrupt governments and Russian influence is fought on many other fronts. In this program, we’ll look at four distinct challenges Ukraine faces in addition to fighting on its borders. From cyber defense to internal defense, fixing its forces to telling the truth – Ukraine faces challenges that may determine its very survival. =GRAPHIC= UKRAINE - THE UNSEEN ATTACKS =GRAPHIC= INFORMATION WAR =VOICEOVER = The information campaign against Ukraine has stepped up. From bad Photoshop jobs to professionally cast actors, the attacks on Ukraine’s credibility are endless and put the country in an impossible situation to try and counter. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Margo Gontar, Co-Founder, Stopfake.org “It’s exciting, but I think it never stops, I mean, the information war.” =VOICEOVER = Facing a well-funded and monolithic Russian communications machine, Ukraine just doesn’t have the resources to debunk every false message. But to do nothing leaves it vulnerable to the lies gaining traction. =SOUNDBITE IN UKRAINIAN= Anna Kovalenko, Advisor, Ministry of Information Policy “If I talk honestly about counter propaganda how do you kill the messages Russia produces? Unfortunately they’re leading in this war. For us it’s important to disseminate truthful information. We’re not talking about fighting with them. We want to install channels of communication that will in return counteract the Russian propaganda that’s flooded us.” =VOICEOVER= Truth and openness ought to be Ukraine’s most powerful weapons against false news, but their ministries have been slow to disseminate information to the public, especially to the conflict areas in the east. =SOUNDBITE IN RUSSIAN= Dmitry Tymchuk, MP, Founder of Information Resistance Blog “For you to understand, in Crimea and Donbass there are very few people who watching Ukrainian TV, they watching Russian. The population saw the events with the eyes of the Kremlin.” =VOICEOVER= And when people do have access to internet, popular social media sites like VKontake are primarily Russian language, making them hotbeds of easily shareable false images and rumors. =SOUNDBITE IN UKRAINIAN= Anna Kovalenko, Advisor, Ministry of Information Policy “As for the occupied territories, there are some citizens that are pro-Ukrainian, but because of their situation, they cannot do anything.” =VOICEOVER= The setting up of a Ministry of Information Policy was a well-intentioned, but unpopular, step to try and synchronise Ukraine’s communications. Almost no one in Ukraine doubts Russia is waging a information war. But the best way to respond is still hotly debated. =SOUNDBITE IN UKRAINIAN= Anna Kovalenko, Advisor, Ministry of Information Policy “If we talk about communications, then we talk about introducing a national identity and the understanding that can unite us and bring us closer to victory.” =VOICEOVER= Building credibility also means self-regulating. Ukrainian media aren’t immune to making mistakes and falling for false news. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Margo Gontar, Co-Founder, Stopfake.org “They just spread without thinking. If something might look like anti-Russia, Ukrainian media or just separate Ukrainian bloggers or whatever they can start putting it round without double check.” =VOICEOVER= Building a new Ukraine that is inclusive, modern and prosperous is a challenge that seems insurmountable. But the strength and will that started the EuroMaidan can still be seen – in volunteers like Margo and in a new, open media that puts the truth before a good story. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Margo Gontar, Co-Founder, Stopfake.org “We have this saying on us that ‘the truth and God is on our side’. And that’s why the best way is to show the truth we have. Eventually truth wins over so you just need to show it.” =VOICEOVER= But Ukraine’s future depends not just on how strongly the government, the armed forces and even the people stand by their intentions but also how much its friends are willing to support it through what may be one of its defining moment in its modern history.

Ukraine remains vulnerable to terror attacks aimed to destabilize its fragile peace from within. When bombs go off in crowded squares, how can Ukraine’s security services unite to protect civilians? NATO experts, Ukrainian politicians and journalists talk about the distinct challenge of potential terrorist attacks in the country. About the four-part series Ukraine: The Unseen Attacks Fighting in the east has come to characterize Ukraine. But Ukraine’s struggle for survival and self-determination, free of corrupt governments and Russian influence is fought on many other fronts.

In this program, we’ll look at four distinct challenges Ukraine faces in addition to fighting on its borders. From cyber defense to internal defense, fixing its forces to telling the truth – Ukraine faces challenges that may determine its very survival. =GRAPHIC= UKRAINE – THE UNSEEN ATTACKS =GRAPHIC= TERRORIST ATTACK =VOICEOVER= February 2015. A bomb exploded in Kharkiv, a city north of the Donbass region and widely considered safe. It killed Three and injured at least 10. It wasn’t the first attack in Kharkiv – a nightclub had been torn apart by a blast the previous November. Kharkiv was joined by Odessa with five separate bomb attacks over the past year and in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, police have had to deal with over 250 bomb threats, closing down their metro stations on numerous occasions. =SOUNDBITE IN RUSSIAN= Dmitry Tymchuk, MP, Founder of Information Resistance Blog “In those areas where pro-Russian forces are very strong, the threat of terrorism is very high. =VOICEOVER= A nightmare scenario like Syria or Iraq is far away, but the incidents served to highlight how Ukrainian internal security - the police, emergency and intelligence services – play just as key a role in defending Ukraine. But the ability of Ukraine’s security services to work as a unified force, defending against attacks like these has been eroded by years of mismanagement. Under Yanukovych, police and secret service agencies were highly centralized and often used as personal militias for his cronies. =SOUNDBITE IN RUSSIAN= Yuriy Butusov, Military Journalist, founder of Censor.net “They’ve recruited militia and the security service officers from the time of Yanukovych, who were like gods almighty back then. That’s why to return to those times is important for them. Right now, they will never earn the money they earned before. That’s why Russian offers to them are interesting. In Kharkiv most of the saboteurs that were exposed by the security services were former militia.” =VOICEOVER= Yuriy cites as an example that of Alexander Khodakovsky, a former commander of the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, who became the leader of the pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. Men like him are the reason, he says, that rebels were able to quickly take over administrative centers in the days following Yanukovych’s flight from Ukraine. Restoring public faith in the police means reducing corruption and putting service people through rigorous retraining to serve the populace, not their own interests. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Martin Linhart, NATO Liaison Office in Ukraine advisor on security sector reform. “Well, according to some research, the trust of the citizens to the national police is very, very low. It’s mainly because of the corruption, mainly that the police officers were not too supportive to normal people. Maybe sometimes not behave well, so the trust is very, very low; so the main challenge is to increase the trust, increase also the participation of the society in the security issues, so this is one of the main challenges in Ukraine.” =VOICEOVER= It’s also a regional problem. Historically, Donbass had stronger ties to Russia and the people have long felt neglected by Kiev. And while Ukraine’s counter-intelligence is often very good, they lack the resources and infrastructure to prevent every attack. =SOUNDBITE IN RUSSIAN= Dmitry Tymchuk, MP, Founder of Information Resistance Blog “Lately our intelligence is working quite efficiently, especially counter-intelligence, but unfortunately they cannot prevent all attacks. Donbass has never felt a part of an undivided Ukraine and this is the fault of Kyiv.” VOICEOVER Ukraine will only start to heal these rifts when it stands resistant to outside interference. Until then, it remains vulnerable to terror attacks aimed to further destabilize its fragile peace from within.

According to Ukraine officials, if the malicious software they installed had not been discovered and removed, it would have portrayed that ultra-nationalist Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh had won with 37 per cent of the vote instead of the one percent he actually received. Moderate Petro Poroshenko, the actual winner with a majority of the vote, would have been placed in second with 29 percent. Cyber Berkut’s aim? To feed into the Russian myth that Ukraine had fallen to a fascist coup. That evening Russian Channel One aired a bulletin declaring Mr Yarosh the winner, quoting these exact percentages. But cyber attacks can be more sinister than pushing Russian propaganda. BlackEnergy is a well-known cyber-crime toolkit that’s been in use since 2007, but over the summer of 2014, as tensions rose between Russia and Ukraine, a new version of the malware was detected being used by a mysterious group of hackers targeting Ukrainian government officials to harvest information. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Tekin Kabasakal, Turkish Army, NATO Cyber Security Advisor to Ukraine “It’s not easy to define the main source of cyber attacks, but when we think about the results and the aim of the attacks, we can guess that these are caused by Russians.” =VOICEOVER= The Black Energy hackers targeted government infrastructure like the Ukrainian Railway, creating proxy servers at key locations to divert traffic, which could have resulted in commuter deaths. =SOUNDBITE IN RUSSIAN= Serhiy Kandaurov, cyber defence expert, Director-General of Institute of International Research. “Ukraine has a lot of serious and dangerous facilities in the chemical, nuclear sectors and also gas pipelines. Any debilitation of these facilities could lead to very serious ecological consequences for Ukraine and for Europe.” =VOICEOVER= The pattern of these attacks follows political events with chilling predictability. For example, a day after the recent announcement of an IMF loan to Ukraine, Ukrainian banks were attacked. For Russian myth busting site Stop Fake, attacks not only follow a pattern, hackers and their junior cousins, trolls, become familiar faces. =SOUNBITE IN UKRAINIAN= Mykhailo Koltsov, Stop Fake webmaster “The more popular the post, the more acute it is, especially after we published evidence of Russian forces in Ukraine, we noticed. After that we got a DDoS (denial of service) attack. They don’t even try to hide behind proxy servers, they come straight from Russia – Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. We have some old faces, as we call them and they can be recognized by their mistakes. They can change their IP address, but the grammar gives them away.” =VOICEOVER= While cyber defence experts can usually tell whether attacks are so called “patriotic hacking”, by lone actors or organized cyber-crime by large institutions, the answer remains the same. Vigilant and coordinated cyber defense. Ukraine doesn’t lack in expertise, but years of neglect and corruption in government institutions have led to a significant brain drain. =SOUNDBITE IN ENGLISH= Tekin Kabasakal, Turkish Army, NATO Cyber Security Advisor to Ukraine “They have enough cyber security experts, for me I think, but they’re currently working in the pr"
