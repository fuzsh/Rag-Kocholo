Born in Brooklyn, he began his career as a stable boy on the East Coast before moving to southern California in 1972 – in that year he won a record 60 races at Hollywood Park. Took the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on six occasions, and sent out six winners in the Breeders' Cup championships. Won $230 million in prize money during his career, second only to D Wayne Lukas.

American actor who appeared in Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), with Clark Gable, in Elmer Gantry (1960), opposite Burt Lancaster and Jean Simmons, and in a multitude of television series, among them The Twilight Zone, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Hawaii Five-O, Perry Mason, Charlie's Angels and Dallas. Took a degree in theatre arts at Yale University. Played on Broadway in the comedy Ladies Night in a Turkish Bath (1950) alongside Joyce Randolph. He was a founder member of the Los Angeles acting, writing and directing group Projects 58, and a voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nSquadron Leader William Assheton\n\nNov 4, aged 91. Flew Spitfires with No 222 Squadron during the Battle of Britain, and was shot down three times in as many weeks. On August 30 1940 he made a crash landing on a forward airfield after seeing combat over Canterbury, and two weeks later was forced to come down in a field after an action in the Maidstone area. His third escape came on September 20, when his aircraft was shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s over the Thames estuary – he bailed out, suffering slight injuries. Later served with a Mosquito photographic reconnaissance squadron. Awarded a DFC in 1945, and retired from the RAF in 1957. Latterly lived in Spain.\n\nCount Pierre Harmel\n\nNov 15, aged 98. Belgian lawyer, diplomat and politician who served as prime minister in a coalition government for eight months in 1965-66. Held a number of government portfolios in the 1950s and 1960s, including education, culture and foreign affairs. As foreign minister from 1966 to 1968 he was involved in the EEC enlargement negotiations and was author of a report, Future Tasks of the Alliance, which was presented to the Nato council of ministers. Its recommendation of strong defence coupled with diplomatic overtures to the Soviet bloc became known as \"the Harmel Doctrine\". Retired from politics in 1977 and was created a count by King Baudouin in 1991.\n\nDavid Lloyd\n\nNov 10, aged 75. Emmy-winning writer whose credits include Taxi, Frasier and Cheers. After graduating from Yale, began by writing jokes for The Jack Paar Show before breaking into sitcoms.

Also worked on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\n\nOrig Williams\n\nNov 12, aged 78. Welsh wrestler who fought under the name \"El Bandito\" and latterly toured the world promoting his sport. The son of a quarryman, he started out as a professional footballer, playing for Oldham Athletic and Shrewsbury Town before joining Pwllheli and subsequently becoming player-manager of Nantlle Vale, where his aim was to build a team consisting entirely of Welsh speakers. Was a popular broadcaster and wrote a column for the Daily Post. His daughter, Tara Bethan, is a singer and actress who last year was a finalist in BBC TV's musical talent show I'd Do Anything."
