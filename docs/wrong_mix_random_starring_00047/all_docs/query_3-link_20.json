No specific validated scales exist to identify and grade the various types of pain in PD. We report an international, cross-sectional, open, multicenter, one-point-in-time evaluation with retest study of the first PD-specific pain scale, the King's PD Pain Scale. Its seven domains include 14 items, each item scored by severity (0-3) multiplied by frequency (0-4), resulting in a subscore of 0 to 12, with a total possible score range from 0 to 168. One hundred seventy-eight PD patients with otherwise unexplained pain (age [meanâÂ±âSD], 64.38âÂ±â11.38 y [range, 29-85]; 62.92% male; duration of disease, 5.40âÂ±â4.93 y) and 83 nonspousal non-PD controls, matched by age (64.25âÂ±â11.10 y) and sex (61.45% males) were studied. No missing data were noted, and floor effect was observed in all domains. The difference between mean and median King's PD Pain Scale total score was less than 10% of the maximum observed value. Skewness was marginally high (1.48 for patients). Factor analysis showed four factors in the King's PD Pain Scale, explaining 57% of the variance (Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin, 0.73; sphericity test). Cronbach's alpha was 0.78, item-total correlation mean value 0.40, and item homogeneity 0.22. Correlation coefficients of the King's PD Pain Scale domains and total score with other pain measures were high. Correlation with the Scale for Outcomes in PD-Motor, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale total score, and quality of life measures was high. The King's PD Pain Scale seems to be a reliable and valid scale for grade rating of various types of pain in PD.

The study also examined the reliability and validity of the Mankoski Pain Scale with the other three scales. A sample of veterans (N = 200) with chronic pain receiving treatment in a residential rehabilitation treatment program (RRTP) and a surgical and specialty care (SSC) outpatient clinic at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center participated in the study. There was a significant difference between scales in regard to preference, Ï2(3) = 64.59, p < .001. A large percentage of the sample preferred the Mankoski Pain Scale (46%). Test-retest of the reliability was comparable for all the scales. Validity of the Mankoski scale was excellent, as it correlated very well with the Numeric (r = .84, p < .001), Analog (r = .83, p < .001), and Faces (r = .78, p < .001) scales. The findings indicate that the Mankoski Pain Scale is a valid and reliable tool for pain with veterans, and it was the preferred scale by veterans for use when describing pain.

Nevertheless, a new tool is required for pain assessment needs in retrospective studies. Methods The postoperative pain episodes, during the first postoperative day, of three patient groups were analyzed. Each pain episode was assessed by a visual analog scale, numerical rating scale, verbal rating scale, and a new tool â pain point system scale (PPSS) â based on the analgesics administered. The type of analgesic was defined based on the authorsâ clinic protocol, patient comorbidities, pain assessment tool scores, and preadministered medications by an artificial neural network system. At each pain episode, each patient was asked to fill the three pain scales. Bartlettâs test and KaiserâMeyerâOlkin criterion were used to evaluate sample sufficiency. The proper scoring system was defined by varimax rotation. Spearmanâs and Pearsonâs coefficients assessed PPSS correlation to the known pain scales. Results A total of 262 pain episodes were evaluated in 124 patients. The PPSS scored one point for each dose of paracetamol, three points for each nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or codeine, and seven points for each dose of opioids. The correlation between the visual analog scale and PPSS was found to be strong and linear (rho: 0.715; P < 0.001 and Pearson: 0.631; P < 0.001). Conclusion PPSS correlated well with the known pain scale and could be used safely in the evaluation of postoperative pain in retrospective studies.

Despite evidence for its utility within the clinical setting, the PainCAS scales have never been subject to psychometric evaluation. The current study is the first to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PainCAS Interference with Daily Activities, Psychological/Emotional Distress, and Pain scales. Patients (Nâ=â4797) from treatment centers and hospitals in 16 different states completed the PainCAS as part of routine clinical assessment. A subsample (nâ=â73) from two hospital-based treatment centers also completed comparator measures. Rasch Rating Scale Models were employed to evaluate the Interference with Daily Activities and Psychological/Emotional Distress scales, and empirical evaluation included assessment of dimensionality, discrimination, item fit, reliability, information, and person-to-item targeting. Additionally, convergent and discriminant validity were evaluated through classical test theory approaches. Convergent validity of the Pain scales was evaluated through correlations with corresponding comparator items. One Interference with Daily Activities item was removed due to poor functioning and discrimination. The retained items from the Interference with Daily Activities and Psychological/Emotional Distress scales conformed to unidimensional Rasch measurement models, yielding satisfactory item fit, reliability, precision, and coverage. Further, results provided support for the convergent and discriminant validity of these two scales. Convergent validity between the PainCAS Pain and BPI Pain items was also strong. Taken together, results provide strong psychometric support for these PainCAS Pain scales. Strengths and limitations of the current study are discussed.\n\nA comparison of change in the 0-10 numeric rating scale to a pain relief scale and global medication performance scale in a short-term clinical trial of breakthrough pain intensity.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarrar, John T; Polomano, Rosemary C; Berlin, Jesse A; Strom, Brian L\n\n2010-06-01\n\nPain intensity is commonly reported using a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale in pain clinical trials. Analysis of the change on the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale as a proportion has most consistently correlated with clinically important differences reported on the patient's global impression of change. The correlation of data from patients with breakthrough pain with a Pain Relief Scale and a different global outcome measures will extend our understanding of these measures. Data were obtained from the open titration phase of a multiple crossover, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate with immediate-release oral morphine sulfate for the treatment of cancer-related breakthrough pain. Raw and percentage changes in the pain intensity scores from 1,307 episodes of pain in 134 oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate-naÃ¯ve patients were correlated with the clinically relevant secondary outcomes of Pain Relief Verbal Response Scale and the global medication performance scale. The changes in raw and percentage change were assessed over time and compared with the ordinal Pain Relief Verbal Response Scale and Global Medication Performance Scale. The P value of the interaction between the raw pain intensity difference was significant (P = 0.034) for four 15-min time periods but not for the percentage pain intensity difference score (P = 0.26). We found similar results in comparison with the ordinal Pain Relief Verbal Response Scale (P = 0.0048 and P = 0.36 respectively) and global medication performance categories (P = 0.048 and P = 0.45, respectively). The change in pain intensity in breakthrough pain was more consistent over time and when compared with both the Pain Relief Verbal Response Scale and the Global Medication Performance Scale when the percentage change is used rather than raw pain intensity difference.\n\n[Validation of the Spanish version of Parent's Postoperative Pain Management pain scale].\n\nPubMed\n\nUllan, A M; PerellÃ³, M; Jerez, C; GÃ³mez, E; Planas, M J; Serrallonga, N\n\n2016-02-01\n\nAssessment of postoperative pain is a fundamental aspect of post-surgical care. When surgery is performed as an outpatient, the parents are mainly responsible for the assessment of pain, but they may not always correctly evaluate their children's pain. This makes it necessary to have tools that help them to assess postoperative pain reliably. The Parent's PostoperativeÂ Pain Measurement (PPPM) is a behavioral measurement tool of post-operative pain developed to help parents to assess their children's post-operative pain. The purpose of this work was to translate this scale into Spanish, and validate the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the scale. Participants were 111 children aged 2 to 12 years, who had undergone surgery, and one of their parents. After the operation, the children's level of pain was assessed, and the parents completed the PPPM scale in Spanish. The PPPM items in Spanish showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.784 and 0.900) and the scale scores were closely related to the global pain assessment (Spearman's rho correlation between 0.626 and 0.431). The score on the scale decreased between the day of the operation and the next day, and discriminated well between children undergoing surgery qualified as low/moderate pain and high pain. We conclude that the Spanish version of the PPPM scale evaluated in this study, has good psychometric properties to assess postoperative pain by parents at home.

Analysis of the change on the Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale as a proportion as most consistently correlated with clinically important differences reported on the Patient Global Impression of Change. The analysis of data using a different global outcome measures and the pain relief scale will extend our understanding of these measures. Use of the pain relief scale is also explored in this study Methods Data came from the open titration phase of a multiple crossover, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate to immediate-release oral morphine sulfate for treatment of cancer-related breakthrough pain. Raw and percent changes in the pain intensity scores on 1,307 from 134 oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate-naive patients were compared to the clinically relevant secondary outcomes of the pain relief verbal response scale and the global medication performance. The changes in raw and percent change were assessed over time and compared to the ordinal pain relief verbal response scale and global medication performance scales. Results The p-value of the interaction between the raw pain intensity difference was significant but not for the percent pain intensity difference score over 4 15 minute time periods (p = 0.034 and p = 0.26 respectively), in comparison with the ordinal pain relief verbal response scale (p = 0.0048 and p = 0.36 respectively), and global medication performance categories (p = 0.048 and p = 0.45 respectively).

Kelley\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To assess internal and external responsiveness of the Activity of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey and Numeric Pain Rating Scale on patients with patellofemoral pain. Design One group pre-post design. Subjects A total of 60 individuals with patellofemoral pain (33 women; mean age 29.9 (standard deviation 9.6) years). Methods The Activity of Daily Living Scale and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale were assessed before and after 8 weeks of physical therapy program. Patients completed a global rating of change scale at the end of therapy. The standardized effect size, Guyatt responsiveness index, and the minimum clinical important difference were calculated. Results Standardized effect size of the Activity of Daily Living Scale was 0.63, Guyatt responsiveness index was 1.4, area under the curve was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.94), and the minimum clinical important difference corresponded to an increase of 7.1 percentile points. Standardized effect size of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale was 0.72, Guyatt responsiveness index was 2.2, area under the curve was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.92), and the minimum clinical important difference corresponded to a decrease of 1.16 points. Conclusion Information from this study may be helpful to therapists when evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation intervention on physical function and pain, and to power future clinical trials on patients with patellofemoral pain.

The aim of this study was to determine and compare the psychometric properties of 3 self-reported pain scales commonly used in the pediatric emergency department (ED). The inclusion criteria were children aged 6 to 17 years presenting to the ED with a musculoskeletal injury and self-reported pain scores â¥30 mm on the mechanical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Self-reported pain intensity was assessed using the mechanical VAS, Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), and Colour Analogue Scale (CAS). Convergent validity was assessed by Pearson correlations and the Bland-Altman method; responsiveness to change was assessed using paired sample t tests and standardized mean responses; and reliability was estimated using relative and absolute indices. A total of 456 participants were included, with a mean age of 11.9 years Â± 2.7 and a majority were boys (252/456, 55.3%). Correlations between each pair of scales were 0.78 (VAS/FPS-R), 0.92 (VAS/CAS), and 0.79 (CAS/FPS-R). Limits of agreement (95% confidence interval) were -3.77 to 2.33 (VAS/FPS-R), -1.74 to 1.75 (VAS/CAS), and -2.21 to 3.62 (CAS/FPS-R). Responsiveness to change was demonstrated by significant differences in mean pain scores among the scales (P < 0.0001). Intraclass correlation coefficient and coefficient of repeatability estimates suggested acceptable reliability for the 3 scales at, respectively, 0.79 and Â±2.29 (VAS), 0.82 and Â±2.07 (CAS), and 0.76 and Â±2.82 (FPS-R). The scales demonstrated good psychometric properties for children with acute pain in the ED. The VAS and CAS showed a strong convergent validity, whereas FPS-R was not in agreement with the other scales.\n\nValidity, Sensitivity, and Responsiveness of the 11-Face Faces Pain Scale to Postoperative Pain in Adult Orthopedic Surgery Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Giang, Nguyen; Chiu, Hsiao-Yean; Thai, Duong Hong; Kuo, Shu-Yu; Tsai, Pei-Shan\n\n2015-10-01\n\nPain is common in patients after orthopedic surgery. The 11-face Faces Pain Scale has not been validated for use in adult patients with postoperative pain. To assess the validity of the 11-face Faces Pain Scale and its ability to detect responses to pain medications, and to determine whether the sensitivity of the 11-face Faces Pain Scale for detecting changes in pain intensity over time is associated with gender differences in adult postorthopedic surgery patients. The 11-face Faces Pain Scale was translated into Vietnamese using forward and back translation. Postoperative pain was assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale and the 11-face Faces Pain Scale on the day of surgery, and before (Time 1) and every 30 minutes after (Times 2-5) the patients had taken pain medications on the first postoperative day. The 11-face Faces Pain Scale highly correlated with the numerical rating scale (r = 0.78, p < .001). When the scores from each follow-up test (Times 2-5) were compared with those from the baseline test (Time 1), the effect sizes were -0.70, -1.05, -1.20, and -1.31, andÂ the standardized response means were -1.17, -1.59, -1.66, andÂ -1.82, respectively. The mean change in pain intensity, but not gender-time interaction effect, over the five time points was significant (F = 182.03, p < .001). Our results support that the 11-face Faces Pain Scale is appropriate for measuring acute postoperative pain in adults. Copyright Â© 2015 American Society for Pain Management Nursing.

The Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (PABS) is a questionnaire designed to differentiate between biomedical and biopsychosocial pain attitudes among health care providers regarding common low back pain. The original version had 36 items, and several shorter versions have been developed. Concern has been raised over the PABS' internal construct validity because of low internal consistency and low explained variance. The aim of this study was to examine and improve the scale's measurement properties and item performance. A convenience sample of 667 Norwegian physiotherapists provided data for Rasch analysis. The biomedical and biopsychosocial subscales of the PABS were examined for unidimensionality, local response independency, invariance, response category function and targeting of persons and items. Reliability was measured with the person separation index (PSI). Items originally excluded by the developers of the scale because of skewness were re-introduced in a second analysis. Our analysis suggested that both subscales required removal of several psychometrically redundant and misfitting items to satisfy the requirements of the Rasch measurement model. Most biopsychosocial items needed revision of their scoring structure. Furthermore, we identified two items originally excluded because of skewness that improved the reliability of the subscales after re-introduction. The ultimate result was two strictly unidimensional subscales, each consisting of seven items, with invariant item ordering and free from any form of misfit. The unidimensionality implies that summation of items to valid total scores is justified. Transformation tables are provided to convert raw ordinal scores to unbiased interval-level scores. Both subscales were\n\n[Visual circle scale (VCS)--a patient-friendly scale to measure pain compared to VAS and Likert scale].\n\nPubMed\n\nHuber, J F; HÃ¼sler, J; Zumstein, M D; Ruflin, G; LÃ¼scher, M\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe visual analogue scale (VAS) and Likert scale (LS) are widely used but the patients might have difficulties to work with these scales and there might be errors in calculation. The visual circle scale (VCS) is a graphic construct with a simple grading to augment the understanding and ease for calculation. This study compares the different scales in orthopaedic patients for pain assessment postoperatively. In addition, the scales were rated by the patients for simplicity, understanding and global rating. Included were 65 patients (40 women) with an average age of 66 years with 330 pain assessments and 65 questionnaire ratings. The average pain was LS 42.7, VAS 39.3, VCS 44. The correlation coefficients r (Spearman) between all scales were > 0.89 and the same held also for sensitivity for change. The VCS was the scale preferred by > 50 % of the orthopaedic patients to assess the pain. The VCS is able to measure pain comparably to the known scales (VAS, Likert scale). From the patients point of view it is the preferred scale to work with.\n\nRefinement and partial validation of the UNESP-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in horses.\n\nPubMed\n\nTaffarel, Marilda Onghero; Luna, Stelio Pacca Loureiro; de Oliveira, Flavia Augusta; Cardoso, Guilherme Schiess; Alonso, Juliana de Moura; Pantoja, Jose Carlos; Brondani, Juliana Tabarelli; Love, Emma; Taylor, Polly; White, Kate; Murrell, Joanna C\n\n2015-04-01\n\nQuantification of pain plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of pain in animals. In order to refine and validate an acute pain scale for horses a prospective, randomized, blinded study was conducted. Twenty-four client owned adult horses were recruited and allocated to one of four following groups: anaesthesia only (GA); pre-emptive analgesia and anaesthesia (GAA,); anaesthesia, castration and postoperative analgesia (GC); or pre-emptive analgesia, anaesthesia and castration (GCA). One investigator, unaware of the treatment group, assessed all horses at time-points before and after intervention and completed the pain scale. Videos were also obtained at these time-points and were evaluated by a further four blinded evaluators who also completed the scale. The data were used to investigate the relevance, specificity, criterion validity and inter- and intra-observer reliability of each item on the pain scale, and to evaluate construct validity and responsiveness of the scale. Construct validity was demonstrated by the observed differences in scores between the groups, four hours after anaesthetic recovery and before administration of systemic analgesia in the GC group. Inter- and intra-observer reliability for the items was only satisfactory. Subsequently the pain scale was refined, based on results for relevance, specificity and total item correlation. Scale refinement and exclusion of items that did not meet predefined requirements generated a selection of relevant pain behaviours in horses. After further validation for reliability, these may be used to evaluate pain under clinical and experimental conditions.\n\nPain assessment scales in newborns: integrative review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Melo, Gleicia Martins; LÃ©lis, Ana LuÃ­za Paula de Aguiar; de Moura, Alline Falconieri; Cardoso, Maria Vera LÃºcia Moreira LeitÃ£o; da Silva, Viviane Martins\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To analyze studies on methods used to assess pain in newborns. DATA SOURCES: Integrative review study of articles published from 2001 to 2012, carried out in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and Cochrane. The sample consisted of 13 articles with level of evidence 5. DATA SYNTHESIS: 29 pain assessment scales in newborns, including 13 one-dimensional and 16 multidimensional, that assess acute and prolonged pain in preterm and full-term infants were available in scientific publications. CONCLUSION: Based on the characteristics of scales, one cannot choose a single one as the most appropriate scale, as this choice will depend on gestational age, type of painful stimulus and the environment in which the infant is inserted. It is suggested the use of multidimensional or one-dimensional scales; however, they must be reliable and validated.

A.; LUCAK, S.; NALIBOFF, B.; ESRAILIAN, E.; CHEY, W. D.; LEMBO, A.; KARSAN, H.; TILLISCH, K.; TALLEY, J.; MAYER, E.; CHANG, L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground Controversy exists about how to effectively measure patient reported outcomes in IBS clinical trials. Pain numeric rating scales (NRS) are widely used in the non-IBS pain literature. The FDA has proposed using the NRS in IBS. Aim To test the psychometrics of an abdominal pain NRS in IBS. Methods We analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort of Rome III IBS subjects. At entry, subjects completed a 10-point NRS, bowel symptoms, IBS severity measurements (IBSSS, FBDSI), health related quality of life indices (IBS-QOL, EQ5D), and the worker productivity activity index (WPAI). We repeated assessments at 3 months along with a response scale to calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Results There were 277 subjects (82% women; age=42Â±15) at baseline and 90 at 3 months. The NRS correlated cross-sectionally with IBSSS (r=0.60; p<0.0011), FBDSI (r=0.49; p<0.0001), IBS-QOL (r=0.43; p<0.0001), EQ5D (r=0.48; p<0.0001), presenteeism (r=0.39; p<0.0001), absenteeism (r=0.17; p=0.04), and distension (r=0.46; p<0.0001), but not stool frequency or form. The MCID was 2.2 points, correlating with a 29.5% reduction over time. Conclusions An abdominal pain NRS exhibits excellent validity and can be readily interpreted with an MCID in patients with IBS. These data support the use of the NRS in IBS clinical trials.

Previous research using hypothetical vignettes and pain following venepuncture has found differences in children's pain ratings as a function of the type of faces scale used. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether scales beginning with a smiling rather than neutral \"no pain\" face would produce higher ratings in the assessment of postoperative pain intensity in children and to compare ratings using different faces scales to those reported with an additional independent measure of pain intensity. Participants were 78 children between the ages of 5 and 13 years undergoing surgery, one of their parents, and their postoperative care nurse. Following surgery, children were asked to provide a rating of their current pain intensity using a set of 5 successively administered faces scales and the Colored Analog Scale (CAS). Parents and nurses provided independent ratings using the same measures. Results showed that parents and nurses rated significantly more pain when using scales with a smiling rather than a neutral \"no pain\" face. This pattern was not as clear for the children's ratings, although their highest ratings were provided when using a smiling \"no pain\" faces scale. Children's and nurses' ratings on the CAS were generally more similar to their ratings using scales with neutral \"no pain\" faces, whereas parents' CAS ratings tended to fall in between ratings provided on the smiling and neutral \"no pain\" faces scales. Scale preference, age and sex differences in pain ratings, and child-parent-nurse agreement in pain ratings are also examined. Children's and parents' ratings of postoperative pain intensity are influenced by the presence of a smiling \"no pain\" face at the beginning of faces scales, with such scales producing significantly higher ratings than scales with neutral \"no pain\" faces. Ratings on the independent CAS measure were more comparable to those\n\nDevelopment and Initial Validation of the Pain Resilience Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nSlepian, P Maxwell; Ankawi, Brett; Himawan, Lina K; France, Christopher R\n\n2016-04-01\n\nOver the past decade, the role of positive psychology in pain experience has gained increasing attention. One such positive factor, identified as resilience, has been defined as the ability to maintain positive emotional and physical functioning despite physical or psychological adversity. Although cross-situational measures of resilience have been shown to be related to pain, it was hypothesized that a pain-specific resilience measure would serve as a stronger predictor of acute pain experience. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a series of studies to develop and validate the Pain Resilience Scale. Study 1 described exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses that support a scale with 2 distinct factors, Cognitive/Affective Positivity and Behavioral Perseverance. Study 2 showed test-retest reliability and construct validity of this new scale, including moderate positive relationships with measures of positive psychological functioning and small to moderate negative relationships with vulnerability measures such as pain catastrophizing. Finally, consistent with our initial hypothesis, study 3 showed that the Pain Resilience Scale is more strongly related to ischemic pain responses than existing measures of general resilience. Together, these studies support the predictive utility of this new pain-specific measure of resilience in the context of acute experimental pain. The Pain Resilience Scale represents a novel measure of Cognitive/Affective Positivity and Behavioral Perseverance during exposure to noxious stimuli.

The English version of the NRS was translated into Arabic as per the translation process guidelines for patient-rated outcome scales. One hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with OA of the knee who had experienced pain for more than 6 months were asked to report their pain levels on the ANPRS, visual analogue scale (VAS), and verbal rating scale (VRS). A second assessment was performed 48 h after the first to assess test-retest reliability. The test-retest reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1). The convergent validity was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient. In addition, the minimum detectable change (MDC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were also assessed. The repeatability of ANPRS was good to excellent (ICC 0.89). The SEM and MDC were 0.71 and 1.96, respectively. Significant correlations were found with the VAS and VRS scores (pâ<0.01). The Arabic numeric pain rating scale is a valid and reliable scale for measuring pain levels in OA of the knee. Implications for Rehabilitation The Arabic Numeric Pain Rating Scale (ANPRS) is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, with psychometric properties in agreement with other widely used scales. The ANPRS is well correlated with the VAS and NRS scores in patients with OA of the knee. The ANPRS appears to measure pain intensity similar to the VAS, NRS, and VRS and may provide additional advantages to Arab populations, as Arabic numbers are easily understood by this population.\n\nFrench translation and validation of the \"Anterior Knee Pain Scale\" (AKPS).\n\nPubMed\n\nBuckinx, F; Bornheim, S; Remy, G; Van Beveren, J; Reginster, Jy; BruyÃ¨re, O; Dardenne, N; Kaux, J F\n\n2017-12-21\n\nTo linguistically and cross-culturally translate the Anterior Knee Pain Scale into French and to evaluate the reliability and validity of this translated version of the questionnaire. The translation part was performed in six stages, according to international guidelines: (i) two initial translations from English to French; (ii) synthesis of the two translations; (iii) backward translations into the original language; (iv) expert committee to compare the backward translations with the original questionnaire; (v) pre-final version testing and (VI) expert committee appraisal. To validate the French version of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale, we assessed its validity, reliability and floor/ceiling effects. To do this, volunteer patients from the French part of Belgium and from France, with patellofemoral pain were asked to answer the French version of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale at baseline and after 7âdays, as well as the generic SF-36 questionnaire. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale was translated without any major difficulties. A total of 101 subjects aged 34.5âÂ±â11.4âyears (58.4% of women) were included in this study. Results indicated an excellent test-retest reliability (Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)â=â0.97, 95%CI: 0.96-0.98), a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alphaÂ =Â 0.87), a consistent construct validity (high correlations with the SF-36 questionnaire were found with domains related to physical function (râ=â0.80), physical role (râ=â0.70) and pain (râ=â0.64)) and low or moderate correlations with domains related to mental health (râ=â0.26), vitality (râ=â0.32) and social function (râ=â0.41). Moreover, no floor/ceiling effects have been found. A valid French version of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale is now available and can be used with confidence to better assess the disease burden associated with patellofemoral pain. It was successfully cross-culturally adapted into French. Implications for rehabilitation The\n\nChinese adaptation and validation of the patellofemoral pain severity scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheung, Roy T H; Ngai, Shirley P C; Lam, Priscillia L; Chiu, Joseph K W; Fung, Eric Y H\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThis study validated the Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale translated into Chinese. The Chinese Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale was translated from the original English version following standard forward and backward translation procedures recommended by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. The survey was then conducted in clinical settings by a questionnaire comprising the Chinese Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale, Kujala Scale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index. Eighty-four Chinese reading patients with patellofemoral pain were recruited from physical therapy clinics. Internal consistency of the translated instrument was measured by Cronbach alpha. Convergent validity was examined by Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) tests by comparing its score with the validated Chinese version of the Kujala Scale and the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index while the test-retest reliability was evaluated by administering the questionnaires twice. Cronbach alpha values of individual questions and their overall value were above 0.85. Strong association was found between the Chinese Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale and the Kujala Scale (rho = -0.72, p < 0.001). Moderate correlation was also found between Chinese Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale with the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index (rho = 0.63, p < 0.001). Excellent test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.98) was demonstrated. The Chinese translated version of the Patellofemoral Pain Severity Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for patients with patellofemoral pain.\n\nResponsiveness of the activities of daily living scale of the knee outcome survey and numeric pain rating scale in patients with patellofemoral pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiva, Sara R; Gil, Alexandra B; Moore, Charity G; Fitzgerald, G Kelley\n\n2009-02-01\n\nTo assess internal and external responsiveness of the Activity of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey and Numeric Pain Rating Scale on patients with patellofemoral pain. One group pre-post design. A total of 60 individuals with patellofemoral pain (33 women; mean age 29.9 (standard deviation 9.6) years). The Activity of Daily Living Scale and the Numeric Pain Rating Scale were assessed before and after 8 weeks of physical therapy program. Patients completed a global rating of change scale at the end of therapy. The standardized effect size, Guyatt responsiveness index, and the minimum clinical important difference were calculated. Standardized effect size of the Activity of Daily Living Scale was 0.63, Guyatt responsiveness index was 1.4, area under the curve was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.72, 0.94), and the minimum clinical important difference corresponded to an increase of 7.1 percentile points. Standardized effect size of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale was 0.72, Guyatt responsiveness index was 2.2, area under the curve was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.92), and the minimum clinical important difference corresponded to a decrease of 1.16 points. Information from this study may be helpful to therapists when evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation intervention on physical function and pain, and to power future clinical trials on patients with patellofemoral pain.\n\nThe Experience of Cognitive Intrusion of Pain: scale development and validation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAttridge, Nina; Crombez, Geert; Van Ryckeghem, Dimitri; Keogh, Edmund; Eccleston, Christopher\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract Patients with chronic pain often report their cognition to be impaired by pain, and this observation has been supported by numerous studies measuring the effects of pain on cognitive task performance. Furthermore, cognitive intrusion by pain has been identified as one of 3 components of pain anxiety, alongside general distress and fear of pain. Although cognitive intrusion is a critical characteristic of pain, no specific measure designed to capture its effects exists. In 3 studies, we describe the initial development and validation of a new measure of pain interruption: the Experience of Cognitive Intrusion of Pain (ECIP) scale. In study 1, the ECIP scale was administered to a general population sample to assess its structure and construct validity. In study 2, the factor structure of the ECIP scale was confirmed in a large general population sample experiencing no pain, acute pain, or chronic pain. In study 3, we examined the predictive value of the ECIP scale in pain-related disability in fibromyalgia patients. The ECIP scale scores followed a normal distribution with good variance in a general population sample. The scale had high internal reliability and a clear 1-component structure. It differentiated between chronic pain and control groups, and it was a significant predictor of pain-related disability over and above pain intensity. Repairing attentional interruption from pain may become a novel target for pain management interventions, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic.

Procedural pain is a common phenomenon but is undermanaged and underassessed in hospitalized neonates. Information for clinician selecting pain measurements to improve neonatal care and outcomes are still limited. A prospective observational study and adheres to the relevant EQUATORÂ guidelines. A total of 1080 pain assessments were made at 90 neonates by two nurses independently, using three scales viewing three phases of videotaped painful (arterial blood sampling) and non-painful procedures (diaper change). Internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, discriminant validity, concurrent validity and convergent validity of scales were analyzed. Feasibility, clinical utility, and nurses' preference of scales were also investigated. All three scales showed excellent inter-raters coefficients (from 0.991 to 0.992) and good internal consistency (0.733 for the PIPP-R, 0.837 for the N-PASS and 0.836 for the NIAPAS, respectively). Scores of painful and nonpainful procedures on the three scales changed significantly across the phases. There was a strong correlation between the three scales with adequate limits of agreement. The mean scores of the N-PASS for feasibility and utility were significantly higher than those of the NIAPAS, but not significantly higher than those of the PIPP-R. The N-PASS was mostly preferred by 55.9% of the nurses, followed by the NIAPAS (23.5%) and the PIPP-R (20.6%). The three scales are all reliable and valid, but the N-PASS and the NIAPAS performs better in reliability. The N-PASS appears to be a better choice for frontier nurses to assess procedural pain in ventilated neonates based on its good feasibility, utility\n\nClinimetric properties of the Nepali version of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale in individuals with chronic pain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThibault, Pascal; Abbott, J Haxby; Jensen, Mark P\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Pain catastrophizing is an exaggerated negative cognitive response related to pain. It is commonly assessed using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Translation and validation of the scale in a new language would facilitate cross-cultural comparisons of the role that pain catastrophizing plays in patient function. Purpose The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the PCS into Nepali (Nepali version of PCS [PCS-NP]) and evaluate its clinimetric properties. Methods We translated, cross-culturally adapted, and performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the PCS-NP in a sample of adults with chronic pain (N=143). We then confirmed the resulting factor model in a separate sample (N=272) and compared this model with 1-, 2-, and 3-factor models previously identified using confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). We also computed internal consistencies, testâretest reliabilities, standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and limits of agreement with 95% confidence interval (LOA95%) of the PCS-NP scales. Concurrent validity with measures of depression, anxiety, and pain intensity was assessed by computing Pearsonâs correlation coefficients. Results The PCS-NP was comprehensible and culturally acceptable. We extracted a two-factor solution using EFA and confirmed this model using CFAs in the second sample. Adequate fit was also found for a one-factor model and different two- and three-factor models based on prior studies. The PCS-NP scores evidenced excellent reliability and temporal stability, and demonstrated validity via moderate-to-strong associations with measures of depression, anxiety, and pain intensity. The SEM and MDC for the PCS-NP total score were 2.52 and 7.86, respectively (range of PCS scores 0â52). LOA95% was between â15.17 and +16.02 for the total PCS-NP scores. Conclusion The PCS-NP is a valid and reliable instrument to assess pain catastrophizing in Nepalese individuals with chronic pain\n\nPostoperative pain assessment using four behavioral scales in Pakistani children undergoing elective surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShamim, Faisal; Ullah, Hameed; Khan, Fauzia A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Several measurement tools have been used for assessment of postoperative pain in pediatric patients. Self-report methods have limitations in younger children and parent, nurse or physician assessment can be used as a surrogate measure. These tools should be tested in different cultures as pain can be influenced by sociocultural factors. The objective was to assess the inter-rater agreement on four different behavioral pain assessment scales in our local population. Materials and Methods: This prospective, descriptive, observational study was conducted in Pakistan. American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II children, 3-7 years of age, undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. Four pain assessment scales were used, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS), Toddler Preschool Postoperative Pain Scale (TPPPS), objective pain scale (OPS), and Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC). After 15 and 60 min of arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), each child evaluated his/her postoperative pain by self-reporting and was also independently assessed by the PACU nurse, PACU anesthetist and the parent. The sensitivity and specificity of the responses of the four pain assessment scales were compared to the response of the child. Results: At 15 min, sensitivity and specificity were >60% for doctors and nurses on FLACC, OPS, and CHEOPS scales and for FLACC and CHEOPS scale for the parents. Parents showed poor agreement on OPS and TPPS. At 60 min, sensitivity was poor on the OPS scale by all three observers. Nurses showed a lower specificity on FLACC tool. Parents had poor specificity on CHEOPS and rate of false negatives was high with TPPS. Conclusions: We recommend the use of FLACC scale for assessment by parents, nurses, and doctors in Pakistani children aged between 3 and 7.

Results of a muticenter study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCapponi, Rebecca; Loguercio, Valentina; Guerrini, Stefania; Beltrami, Giampietro; Vesprini, Andrea; Giostra, Fabrizio\n\n2017-01-16\n\nPain evaluation at triage in Emergency Department (ED) is fundamental, as it influences significantly patients color code determination. Different scales have been proposed to quantify pain but they are not always reliable. This study aims to determine a) how important is for triage nurses pain measurement b) reliability of Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the most used instrument to evaluate pain in Italian EDs, because it frequently shows higher pain scores than others scales. End point 1: a questionnaire was administered to triage nurses in some hospitals of northern Italy. End point 2: 250 patients arriving at the ED referring pain have been evaluated using, randomly, either the NRS or a fake \"30-50\" scale. End point 1: Triage nurses acknowledge to modify frequently the referred pain intensity. This for several reasons: nurses think that patients may exaggerate to obtain a higher priority color code; they may be influenced by specific patients categories (non EU citizens, drugs-addicted, elderly); the pain score referred by patients is not correspondent to nurse perception. End point 2: Data show that the mean value obtained with NRS is significantly (p<0.05) higher that the mean obtained with the \"30-50\" scale. Manipulation on pain evaluation performed by nurses might result in a dangerous underestimation of this symptom. At the same time, the use of NRS seems to allow patients to exaggerate pain perception with consequent altered attribution of color code at triage.\n\nLumbar Disc Screening Using Back Pain Questionnaires: Oswestry Low Back Pain Score, Aberdeen Low Back Pain Scale, and Acute Low Back Pain Screening Questionnaire\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Do Yeon; Oh, Chang Hyun; Park, Hyung Chun; Park, Chong Oon\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the usefulness of back pain questionnaires for lumbar disc screening among Korean young males. Methods We carried out a survey for lumbar disc screening through back pain questionnaires among the volunteers with or without back pain. Three types of back pain questionnaire (Oswestry Low Back Pain Score, Aberdeen Low Back Pain Scale, and Acute Low Back Pain Screeing Questionnaire) were randomly assigned to the examinees. The authors reviewed lumbar imaging studies (simple lumbar radiographs, lumbar computed tomography, and magnetic resolutional images), and the severity of lumbar disc herniation was categorized according to the guidelines issued by the Korean military directorate. We calculated the relationship between the back pain questionnaire scores and the severity of lumbar disc herniation. Results The scores of back pain questionnaires increased according to the severity of lumbar disc herniation. But, the range of scores was very vague, so it is less predictable to detect lumbar disc herniation using only back pain questionnaires. The sensitivity between the back pain questionnaires and the presence of lumbar disc herniation was low (16-64%). Conclusion Screening of lumbar disc herniation using only back pain questionnaires has limited value.

Patient pain was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 Bodily Pain Scale. Four raters assessed 181 audiotaped patient interactions with 68 physicians. Descriptive statistics of PCAP items were computed. Principal components analyses with 20 scale items were used to reduce the scale to composite variables for analyses. Validity was assessed through (1) comparing PCAP composite scores for patients with high versus low pain and (2) correlating PCAP composites with a separate communication rating scale. Principal components analyses yielded four physician and five patient communication composites (mean alpha=.77). Some evidence for concurrent validity was provided (5 of 18 correlations with communication validation rating scale were significant). Paired-sample t tests showed significant differences for 4 patient PCAP composites, showing the PCAP scale discriminates between high and low pain patients' communication. The PCAP scale shows partial evidence of reliability and two forms of validity. More research with this scale (developing more reliable and valid composites) is needed to extend these preliminary findings before this scale is applicable for use in practice.

Pain management in older patients is an important challenge because of their greater susceptibility to adverse effects of analgesics. Nurses play an important role in applying guidelines for postoperative pain treatment. However, effective pain management is dependent upon valid and reliable pain assessment. Cross-sectional study. In total, 2674 older patients scored their postoperative pain on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) and an adjective scale (VRS) including no pain, little pain, painful but bearable, considerable pain and terrible pain. The diagnostic value of different NRS cut-off values for administering analgesics is determined by an ROC curve. Sensitivity of NRS >Â 3 for 'unbearable' pain in older patients was 72% with a specificity of 97Â·2%. With a cut-off point NRS >Â 4, sensitivity increased to 83%, while specificity was 96Â·7%. With a cut-off point NRS >Â 5, sensitivity was 94%, while specificity was 85%. A high proportion (75%) of older old patients (â¥Â 75Â years) with 'painful but bearable' considers NRS 4, 5 and 6 to this VRS category. Using an NRS cut-off point >Â 3 or >Â 4, a large group of older patients with 'bearable' pain would incorrectly classified as 'unbearable'. When we make the assumption that bearable pain means no wish for additional analgesics, this misclassification might result in overtreatment with analgesics, while 3% would be undertreated. With NRS cut-off point >Â 5, 6% have a risk of overtreatment and 15% of undertreatment. Nurses should not rely solely on the NRS score in determining pain treatment; they need to communicate with older patients about their pain, the need for analgesics and eventual misconceptions about analgesics.

Objectives The purpose was to examine the degree of agreement among unidimensional pain scales, and to determine the accuracy of the multidimensional pain scales in the diagnosis of severe pain. Methods A secondary analysis was performed. The sample included a convenience sample of 480 cancer patients recruited from both the internet and community settings. Cancer pain was measured using the Verbal Descriptor Scale (VDS), the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Faces Pain Scale (FPS), the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF) and the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). Data were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Results The agreement between the VDS and VAS was 77.25%, while the agreement was 71.88% and 71.60% between the VDS and FPS, and VAS and FPS, respectively. The MPQ-SF and BPI-SF yielded high accuracy in the diagnosis of severe pain. Cutoff points for severe pain were > 8 for the MPQ-SF and > 14 for the BPI-SF, which exhibited high sensitivity and relatively low specificity. Conclusion The study found substantial agreement between the unidimensional pain scales, and high accuracy of the MPQ-SF and the BPI-SF in the diagnosis of severe pain. Implications for Practice Use of one or more pain screening tools that have been validated diagnostic accuracy and consistency will help classify pain effectively and subsequently promote optimal pain control in multi-ethnic groups of cancer patients.

King's Parkinson's disease pain scale, assesses different pain syndromes, thus allowing exploration of its differential prevalence and influence on the health-related quality of life of patients. Post hoc study 178 patients and 83 matched controls participating in the King's Parkinson's disease pain scale validation study were used. For determining the respective distribution, King's Parkinson's disease pain scale items and domains scoresâ=â0 meant absence and â¥1 presence of the symptom. The regular scores were used for the other analyses. Health-related quality of lifewas evaluated with EQ-5D-3L and PDQ-8 questionnaires. Parkinson's disease patients experienced more pain modalities than controls. In patients, Pain around joints (King's Parkinson's disease pain scale item 1) and Pain while turning in bed (item 8) were the most prevalent types of pain, whereas Burning mouth syndrome (item 11) and Pain due to grinding teeth (item 10) showed the lowest frequency. The total number of experienced pain modalities closely correlated with the PDQ-8 index, but not with other variables. For all pain types except Pain around joints (item 1) and pain related to Periodic leg movements/RLS (item 7), patients with pain had significantly worse health-related quality of life. The influence of pain, as a whole, on the health-related quality of life was not remarkable after adjustment by other variables. When the particular types of pain were considered, adjusted by sex, age, and Parkinson's disease duration, pain determinants were different for EQ-5D-3L and PDQ-8. King's Parkinson's disease pain scale allows exploring the distribution of the diverse syndromic pain occurring in Parkinson's disease and its association with health-related quality of life.\n\nMonitoring acute equine visceral pain with the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Composite Pain Assessment (EQUUS-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Facial Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-FAP): A scale-construction study.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Loon, Johannes P A M; Van Dierendonck, Machteld C\n\n2015-12-01\n\nAlthough recognition of equine pain has been studied extensively over the past decades there is still need for improvement in objective identification of pain in horses with acute colic. This study describes scale construction and clinical applicability of the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Composite Pain Assessment (EQUUS-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Facial Assessment of Pain (EQUUS-FAP) in horses with acute colic. A cohort follow-up study was performed using 50 adult horses (n = 25 with acute colic, n = 25 controls). Composite pain scores were assessed by direct observations, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were assessed from video clips. Colic patients were assessed at arrival, and on the first and second mornings after arrival. Both the EQUUS-COMPASS and EQUUS-FAP scores showed high inter-observer reliability (ICC = 0.98 for EQUUS-COMPASS, ICC = 0.93 for EQUUS-FAP, P <0.001), while a moderate inter-observer reliability for the VAS scores was found (ICC = 0.63, P <0.001). The cut-off value for differentiation between healthy and colic horses for the EQUUS-COMPASS was 5, and for differentiation between conservatively treated and surgically treated or euthanased patients it was 11. For the EQUUS-FAP, cut-off values were 4 and 6, respectively. Internal sensitivity and specificity were good for both EQUUS-COMPASS (sensitivity 95.8%, specificity 84.0%) and EQUUS-FAP (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 88.0%). The use of the EQUUS-COMPASS and EQUUS-FAP enabled repeated and objective scoring of pain in horses with acute colic. A follow-up study with new patients and control animals will be performed to further validate the constructed scales that are described in this study. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

During the six-week collection period, a total of 541 questionnaires were returned, of which 24 (4.25 per cent) were discounted due to completion errors. Overall, the pain scores for procedures involving dogs were higher than those for cats; the veterinary nurses' pain scores were higher for all procedures than those of veterinary surgeons in a previous study. Both veterinary nurses and veterinary surgeons were primarily involved with monitoring pain postoperatively, and 96 per cent of veterinary nurses felt that their knowledge of pain management could be enhanced; 8.1 per cent of the practices used a formal pain scoring system, with the simple descriptive scale most commonly used; 80.3 per cent of the veterinary nurses agreed that a pain scale was a useful clinical tool.\n\nValidation of the UNESP-Botucatu unidimensional composite pain scale for assessing postoperative pain in cattle.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, FlÃ¡via Augusta; Luna, Stelio Pacca Loureiro; do Amaral, Jackson Barros; Rodrigues, Karoline Alves; Sant'Anna, Aline Cristina; Daolio, Milena; Brondani, Juliana Tabarelli\n\n2014-09-06\n\nThe recognition and measurement of pain in cattle are important in determining the necessity for and efficacy of analgesic intervention. The aim of this study was to record behaviour and determine the validity and reliability of an instrument to assess acute pain in 40 cattle subjected to orchiectomy after sedation with xylazine and local anaesthesia. The animals were filmed before and after orchiectomy to record behaviour. The pain scale was based on previous studies, on a pilot study and on analysis of the camera footage. Three blinded observers and a local observer assessed the edited films obtained during the preoperative and postoperative periods, before and after rescue analgesia and 24 hours after surgery. Re-evaluation was performed one month after the first analysis. Criterion validity (agreement) and item-total correlation using Spearman's coefficient were employed to refine the scale. Based on factor analysis, a unidimensional scale was adopted. The internal consistency of the data was excellent after refinement (Cronbach's Î± coefficient = 0.866). There was a high correlation (p < 0.001) between the proposed scale and the visual analogue, simple descriptive and numerical rating scales. The construct validity and responsiveness were confirmed by the increase and decrease in pain scores after surgery and rescue analgesia, respectively (p < 0.001). Inter- and intra-observer reliability ranged from moderate to very good. The optimal cut-off point for rescue analgesia was > 4, and analysis of the area under the curve (AUC = 0.963) showed excellent discriminatory ability. The UNESP-Botucatu unidimensional pain scale for assessing acute postoperative pain in cattle is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument with excellent internal consistency and discriminatory ability. The cut-off point for rescue analgesia provides an additional tool for guiding analgesic therapy.\n\nPsychometric properties of the DASS-Depression scale among a Brazilian population with chronic pain.\n\nPubMed\n\nSardÃ¡, Jamir; Nicholas, Michael K; Pimenta, Cibele A M; Asghari, Ali\n\n2008-01-01\n\nDepression is a common contributor to suffering and disability in people with chronic pain. However, the assessment of depression in this population has been hampered by the presence of a number of somatic symptoms that are shared between chronic pain, treatment side-effects and traditional concepts of depression. As a result, the use of depression measures that do not contain somatic items has been encouraged. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Depression sub-scale of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) in a Brazilian chronic pain patient population. Data on a number of measures were collected from 348 participants attending pain facilities. Principal components and exploratory factor analyses indicated the presence of only one factor. Item analyses indicated adequate item-scale correlations. The Cronbach alpha was .96, which suggests an excellent internal consistency. The DASS-Depression scale has adequate psychometric properties and its further use with Brazilian chronic pain populations can now be supported.\n\nDevelopment and Validation of a Daily Pain Catastrophizing Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nDarnall, Beth D; Sturgeon, John A; Cook, Karon F; Taub, Chloe J; Roy, Anuradha; Burns, John W; Sullivan, Michael; Mackey, Sean C\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTo date, there is no validated measure for pain catastrophizing at the daily level. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is widely used to measure trait pain catastrophizing. We sought to develop and validate a brief, daily version of the PCS for use in daily diary studies to facilitate research on mechanisms of catastrophizing treatment, individual differences in self-regulation, and to reveal the nuanced relationships between catastrophizing, correlates, and pain outcomes. After adapting the PCS for daily use, we evaluated the resulting 14 items using 3 rounds of cognitive interviews with 30 adults with chronic pain. We refined and tested the final daily PCS in 3 independent, prospective, cross-sectional, observational validation studies conducted in a combined total of 519 adults with chronic pain who completed online measures daily for 14 consecutive days. For study 1 (NÂ =Â 131), exploratory factor analysis revealed adequate fit and-unexpectedly-unidimensionality for item responses to the daily PCS. Study 2 (NÂ =Â 177) correlations indicated adequate association with related constructs (anger, anxiety, pain intensity, depression). Similarly, results for study 3 (NÂ =Â 211) revealed expected correlations for daily PCS and measures of daily constructs including physical activity, sleep, energy level, and positive affect. Results from complex/multilevel confirmatory factor analysis confirmed good fit to a unidimensional model. Scores on the daily PCS were statistically comparable with and more parsimonious than the full 14-item version. Next steps include evaluation of score validity in populations with medical diagnoses, greater demographic diversity, and in patients with acute pain. This article describes the development and validation of a daily PCS. This daily measure may facilitate research that aims to characterize pain mechanisms, individual differences in self-regulation, adaptation, and nuanced relationships between catastrophizing, correlates, and pain\n\nValidation of the \"Pain Block\" concrete ordinal scale for children aged 4 to 7 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, Jin Hee; Lee, Jin Hee; Kim, Do Kyun; Jung, Jae Yun; Chang, Ikwan; Kwon, Hyuksool; Shin, Jonghwan; Paek, So Hyun; Oh, Sohee; Kwak, Young Ho\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPain scales using faces are commonly used tools for assessing pain in children capable of communicating. However, some children require other types of pain scales because they have difficulties in understanding faces pain scales. The goal of this study was to develop and validate the \"Pain Block\" concrete ordinal scale for 4- to 7-year-old children. This was a multicenter prospective observational study in the emergency department. Psychometric properties (convergent validity, discriminative validity, responsivity, and reliability) were compared between the \"Pain Block\" pain scale and the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) to assess the validity of the \"Pain Block\" scale. A total of 163 children (mean age, 5.5 years) were included in this study. The correlation coefficient between the FPS-R and the Pain Block scale was 0.82 for all participants which increased with age. Agreement between the 2 pain scales was acceptable, with 95.0% of the values within the predetermined limit. The differences in mean scores between the painful group and nonpainful group were 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-4.1) and 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.1-4.6) for FPR-S and Pain Block, respectively. The pain scores for both pain scales were significantly decreased when analgesics or pain-relieving procedures were administered (difference in Pain Block, 2.4 [1.4-3.3]; and difference in FPS-R, 2.3 [1.3-3.3]). The Pain Block pain scale could be used to assess pain in 4- to 7-year-old children capable of understanding and counting up to the number 5, even if they do not understand the FPS-R pain scale.\n\nPatients' perceptions and responses to procedural pain: results from Thunder Project II.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuntillo, K A; White, C; Morris, A B; Perdue, S T; Stanik-Hutt, J; Thompson, C L; Wild, L R\n\n2001-07-01\n\nLittle is known about the painfulness of procedures commonly performed in acute and critical care settings. To describe pain associated with turning, wound drain removal, tracheal suctioning, femoral catheter removal, placement of a central venous catheter, and nonburn wound dressing change and frequency of use of analgesics during procedures. A comparative, descriptive design was used. Numeric rating scales were used to measure pain intensity and procedural distress; word lists, to measure pain quality. Data were obtained from 6201 patients: 176 younger than 18 years and 5957 adults. Mean pain intensity scores for turning and tracheal suctioning were 2.80 and 3.00, respectively (scale, 0-5), for 4- to 7-year-olds and 52.0 and 28.1 (scale, 0-100) for 8- to 12-year-olds. For adolescents, mean pain intensity scores for wound dressing change, turning, tracheal suctioning, and wound drain removal were 5 to 7 (scale, 0-10); mean procedural distress scores were 4.83 to 6.00 (scale, 0-10). In adults, mean pain intensity scores for all procedures were 2.65 to 4.93 (scale, 0-10); mean procedural distress scores were 1.89 to 3.47 (scale, 0-10). The most painful and distressing procedures were turning for adults and wound care for adolescents. Procedural pain was often described as sharp, stinging, stabbing, shooting, and awful. Less than 20% of patients received opiates before procedures. Procedural pain varies considerably and is procedure specific. Because procedures are performed so often, more individualized attention to preparation for and control of procedural pain is warranted.\n\nDevelopment and validation of the French-Canadian Chronic Pain Self-efficacy Scale\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLacasse, AnaÃ¯s; Bourgault, Patricia; Tousignant-Laflamme, Yannick; Courtemanche-Harel, Roxanne; ChoiniÃ¨re, Manon\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: Perceived self-efficacy is a non-negligible outcome when measuring the impact of self-management interventions for chronic pain patients. However, no validated, chronic pain-specific self-efficacy scales exist for studies conducted with French-speaking populations. OBJECTIVES: To establish the validity of the use of the French-Canadian Chronic Pain Self-efficacy Scale (FC-CPSES) among chronic pain patients. METHODS: The Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scale is a validated 33-item self-administered questionnaire that measures perceived self-efficacy to perform self-management behaviours, manage chronic disease in general and achieve outcomes (a six-item version is also available). This scale was adapted to the context of chronic pain patients following cross-cultural adaptation guidelines. The FC-CPSES was administered to 109 fibromyalgia and 34 chronic low back pain patients (n=143) who participated in an evidence-based self-management intervention (the PASSAGE program) offered in 10 health care centres across the province of Quebec. Cronbachâs alpha coefficients (Î±) were calculated to determine the internal consistency of the 33- and six-item versions of the FC-CPSES. With regard to convergent construct validity, the association between the FC-CPSES baseline scores and related clinical outcomes was examined. With regard to the scaleâs sensitivity to change, pre- and postintervention FC-CPSES scores were compared. RESULTS: Internal consistency was high for both versions of the FC-CPSES (Î±=0.86 to Î±=0.96). Higher self-efficacy was significantly associated with higher mental health-related quality of life and lower pain intensity and catastrophizing (P<0.05), supporting convergent validity of the scale. There was a statistically significant increase in FC-CPSES scores between pre- and postintervention measures for both versions of the FC-CPSES (P<0.003), which supports their sensitivity to clinical change during an intervention.

Methods We recruited 25 patients with low back pain. Of them, 21 patients suffered from low back pain for more than 3 months. The QPD was calculated using the PainVision (PV, PS-2100; Nipro Co., Osaka, Japan). We applied electrodes to the medial forearm of the subjects and the electrical stimulus was amplified sequentially. Minimum perceived current (MPC) and pain equivalent current (PEC) were defined as minimum electrical stimulation that could be sensed by the subject and electrical stimulation that could trigger actual pain itself. To eliminate individual differences, we defined QPD as the following: QPD=PEC-MPC/MPC. We scored pre-treatment QPD three times at admission and post-treatment QPD once at discharge. The VAS, MPQ, and QPD were evaluated and correlations between the scales were analyzed. Results Result showed significant test-retest reliability (ICC=0.967, p<0.001) and the correlation between QDP and MPQ was significant (at admission SRCC=0.619 and p=0.001; at discharge SRCC=0.628, p=0.001). However, the correlation between QPD and VAS was not significant (at admission SRCC=0.240, p=0.248; at discharge SRCC=0.289, p=0.161). Conclusion Numerical values measured with PV showed consistent results with repeated calculations. Electrically measured QPD showed an excellent correlation with MPQ but not with VAS. These results demonstrate that PV is a significantly reliable device for quantifying the intensity of low back pain.

A follow-up cohort study of 46 adult horses (nâ=â23 with acute colic; nâ=â23 healthy control horses) was performed for validation and refinement of the constructed scales. Both pain scales showed statistically significant differences between horses with colic and healthy control horses, and between horses with colic that could be treated conservatively and those that required surgical treatment or were euthanased. Sensitivity and specificity were good for both EQUUS-COMPASS (87% and 71%, respectively) and EQUUS-FAP (77% and 100%, respectively) and were not substantially influenced by applying weighting factors to the individual parameters.

However, self-report scales are often too complex cognitively for preschool-aged children (2-4 years). The Rainbow Pain Scale (RPS) was developed to provide individualized self-reported pain ratings for preschool-aged children. The psychometric properties of this scale have yet to be evaluated. To ensure validity, our first step was to compare RPS scores to a well-validated scale in older children who were able to self-report their pain. The purpose of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the RPS in children aged 5 to 10 years as proof of principle. We compared ratings of 49 children's pain using the RPS with those on the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). Participants suffering from pain related to cancer and cancer treatment were recruited to complete both scales at 3 time points, during both inpatient and outpatient clinic visits. Pearson's r and Cohen's Îº were used to evaluate the level of association between the scales. The association between RPS and the FPS-R was greater than .7 at all 3 visits; r = .96 between the scales at the first clinic visit, .97 at the second visit, and .93 at the third visit. Cohen's Îº between scales was 1.0 at the first clinic visit, .95 at the second visit, and .87 at the third visit. The RPS shows excellent concurrent validity with the FPS-R in school-aged children. The next step will be to examine the psychometric properties of the RPS in preschool-aged children.

This study was conducted in two phases: the Behavioral Pain Scale was translated and culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese and the psychometric properties of this scale were subsequently assessed (reliability and clinical utility). The study sample consisted of 100 patients who were older than 18 years of age, admitted to an intensive care unit, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and subjected or not to sedation and analgesia from July 2012 to December 2012. Pediatric and non-intubated patients were excluded. The study was conducted at a large private hospital that was situated in the city of SÃ£o Paulo (SP). Regarding reproducibility, the results revealed that the observed agreement between the two evaluators was 92.08% for the pain descriptor \"adaptation to mechanical ventilation\", 88.1% for \"upper limbs\", and 90.1% for \"facial expression\". The kappa coefficient of agreement for \"adaptation to mechanical ventilation\" assumed a value of 0.740. Good agreement was observed between the evaluators with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.807 (95% confidence interval: 0.727-0.866). The Behavioral Pain Scale was easy to administer and reproduce. Additionally, this scale had adequate internal consistency. The Behavioral Pain Scale was satisfactorily adapted to Brazilian Portuguese for the assessment of pain in critically ill patients.\n\nCorrelations Between Electrically Quantified Pain Degree, Subjectively Assessed Visual Analogue Scale, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire: A Pilot Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Junho; Lee, Kyung Soo; Kong, Sang Won; Kim, Taikon; Kim, Mi Jung; Park, Si-Bog; Lee, Kyu Hoon\n\n2014-10-01\n\nTo evaluate the clinical utility of the electrically calculated quantitative pain degree (QPD) and to correlate it with subjective assessments of pain degree including a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ).

According to international guidelines, the original PRS was first translated and cross-culturally adapted to formulate the Chinese version of PRS (PRS-C). A total of 152 patients with TMD pain were recruited to complete series of questionnaires. Reliability of the PRS-C was investigated using internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Validity of the PRS-C was calculated using cross-cultural validity and convergent validity. Cross-cultural validity was evaluated by examining the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). And convergent validity was examined through correlating the PRS-C scores with scores of 2 commonly used pain-related measures (the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale [CD-RISC] and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia for Temporomandibular Disorders [TSK-TMD]). The PRS-C had a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alphaÂ =Â 0.92) and good test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]Â =Â 0.81). The CFA supported a 2-factor model for the PRS-C with acceptable fit to the data. The fit indices were chi-square/DFÂ =Â 2.21, GFIÂ =Â 0.91, TLIÂ =Â 0.97, CFIÂ =Â 0.98 and RMSEAÂ =Â 0.08. As regards convergent validity, the PRS-C evidenced moderate-to-good relationships with the CD-RISC and the TSK-TMD. The PRS-C shows good psychometric properties and could be considered as a reliable and valid measure to evaluate pain-related resilience in patients with TMD pain.

A retrospective review was conducted in 41 patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent cervical laminoplasty. The patients were assessed using questionnaires to evaluate the neck pain intensity before surgery, and 2 years after surgery, the outcome was assessed using a VAS. The degree of cervical lordosis and range of motion (ROM) of the cervical spine were evaluated before and after laminoplasty. The neurological status was also evaluated before and after surgery. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their preoperative neck pain: 1) the pain (PA) group, which included patients whose preoperative VAS score was more than 1 mm; and 2) the no pain (NP) group, which included patients whose preoperative VAS score was 0 mm. Inclusion in the PA group indicated a restriction of the cervical ROM before laminoplasty; however, the improvement of neck pain in this group and the deterioration of pain status in the NP group eliminated this difference after laminoplasty. Thereafter, the PA group was classified into 2 subgroups according to the improvement of the preoperative neck pain: 1) the improved group, which included patients whose postoperative VAS score decreased; and 2) the no improvement group, which included patients who were not in the improved group. No significant differences were observed in the average recovery and radiographic results between these 2 subgroups. Neck pain before surgery in the PA group indicated a restriction of the cervical ROM; however, the improvement of neck pain in this group and the deterioration of pain status in the NP group indicated the disappearance of this difference postoperatively. Moreover, improvement of preoperative neck pain was not associated with the radiographic\n\nUse of a medication quantification scale for comparison of pain medication usage in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).\n\nPubMed\n\nGallizzi, Michael A; Khazai, Ravand S; Gagnon, Christine M; Bruehl, Stephen; Harden, R Norman\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo correlate the amount and types of pain medications prescribed to CRPS patients, using the Medication Quantification Scale, and patients' subjective pain levels. An international, multisite, retrospective review. University medical centers in the United States, Israel, Germany, and the Netherlands. A total of 89 subjects were enrolled from four different countries: 27 from the United States, 20 Germany, 18 Netherlands, and 24 Israel. The main outcome measures used were the Medication Quantification Scale III and numerical analog pain scale. There was no statistically significant correlation noted between the medication quantification scale and the visual analog scale for any site except for a moderate positive correlation at German sites. The medication quantification scale mean differences between the United States and Germany, the Netherlands, and Israel were 9.793 (Pâ<â0.002), 10.389 (Pâ<â0.001), and 4.984 (Pâ=â0.303), respectively. There appears to be only a weak correlation between amount of pain medication prescribed and patients' reported subjective pain intensity within this limited patient population. The Medication Quantification Scale is a viable tool for the analysis of pharmaceutical treatment of CRPS patients and would be useful in further prospective studies of pain medication prescription practices in the CRPS population worldwide.

This may be, in part, due to the failure of the NRS to adequately predict patients' preferences for additional treatment. To examine whether patients' illness perceptions have a stronger association with patient treatment preferences than the pain intensity NRS. Single face-to-face interview. Outpatients with chronic, noncancer, musculoskeletal pain. Experience of pain was measured using 18 illness perception items. Factor analysis of these items found that five factors accounted for 67.1% of the variance; 38% of the variance was accounted for by a single factor labeled \"pain impact.\" Generalized linear models were used to examine how NRS scores and physical function compare with pain impact in predicting preferences for highly effective/high-risk treatment. Two hundred forty-nine subjects agreed to participate. Neither NRS nor functioning predicted patient preference (NRS: Ï2â=â1.92, dfâ=â1, pâ=â0.16, physical functioning: Ï2â=â2.48, dfâ=â1, pâ=â0.11). In contrast, pain impact was significantly associated with the preference for a riskier/more effective treatment after adjusting for age, comorbidity, efficacy of current medications and numeracy (Ï2â=â4.40, dfâ=â1, pâ=â0.04). Tools that measure the impact of pain may be a more valuable screening instrument than the NRS. Further research is now needed to determine if measuring the impact of pain in clinical practice is more effective at triggering appropriate management than more restricted measures of pain such as the NRS.\n\nA Comparison of Pain Assessment Measures in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: Visual Analog Scale Versus Numeric Rating Scale.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyrvik, Matthew P; Drendel, Amy L; Brandow, Amanda M; Yan, Ke; Hoffmann, Raymond G; Panepinto, Julie A\n\n2015-04-01\n\nGiven the availability of various pain severity scales, greater understanding of the agreement between pain scales is warranted. We compared Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain severity ratings in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) to identify the relationship and agreement between pain scale ratings. Twenty-eight patients (mean Â± SD age, 14.65 Â± 3.12 y, 50% female) receiving pain interventions within the emergency department completed serial VAS and NRS pain severity ratings every 30 minutes. Data were used to calculate the relationship (Spearman correlation) and agreement (Bland-Altman approach) between the VAS and NRS. One hundred twenty-eight paired VAS-NRS measurements were obtained. VAS and NRS ratings were significantly correlated for the initial assessment (rs = 0.88, P < 0.001) and all assessments (rs = 0.87, P < 0.001). Differences between VAS and NRS means were -0.52 (P = 0.006) for the initial assessment and -0.86 (P < 0.001) across all assessments. The difference between VAS and NRS ratings decreased as pain severity increased across all assessments (P = 0.027), but not the initial assessment. Within pediatric patients with SCD, VAS and NRS ratings were found to trend together; however, VAS scores were found to be significantly lower than NRS scores across assessments. The agreement between the 2 measures improved at increasing levels of pain severity. These findings demonstrate that the VAS and NRS are similar, but cannot be used interchangeably when assessing self-reported pain in SCD.\n\nA Review of Observational Pain Scales in Nonverbal Elderly with Cognitive Impairments\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nPark, Juyoung; Castellanos-Brown, Karen; Belcher, John\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective: Pain assessment for nonverbal older adults with cognitive impairments or dementia presents many challenges, and it is important to determine which scales are most useful in assessing pain among this population.

This study explores MOBID-2's testâretest reliability, measurement error and responsiveness to change. Methods Analyses are based upon data from a cluster randomized trial including 352 patients with advanced dementia from 18 Norwegian nursing homes. Testâretest reliability between baseline and week 2 (n = 163), and weeks 2 and 4 (n = 159) was examined in patients not expected to change (controls), using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2.1), standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC). Responsiveness was examined by testing six priori-formulated hypotheses about the association between change scores on MOBID-2 and other outcome measures. Results ICCs of the total MOBID-2 scores were 0.81 (0â2 weeks) and 0.85 (2â4 weeks). SEM and SDC were 1.9 and 3.1 (0â2 weeks) and 1.4 and 2.3 (2â4 weeks), respectively. Five out of six hypotheses were confirmed: MOBID-2 discriminated (p < 0.001) between change in patients with and without a stepwise protocol for treatment of pain (SPTP). Moderate association (r = 0.35) was demonstrated with Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, and no association with Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Assessment Staging and Activity of Daily Living. Expected associations between change scores of MOBID-2 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory â Nursing Home version were not confirmed. Conclusion The SEM and SDC in connection with the MOBID-2 pain scale indicate that the instrument is responsive to a decrease in pain after a SPTP. Satisfactory testâretest reliability across test periods was demonstrated. Change scores â¥ 3 on total and subscales are clinically relevant and are beyond measurement error.

Clinical measures observational study investigating the severity of chronic pain. The methodology included a process of translation and back-translation following the international guidelines. Study participants were 75 patients who experienced lower back pain for more than six months and were sent to Primary Care physiotherapy units. Internal consistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability, floor and ceiling effects, and answering capacity were analysed. The Spanish version of the Graded Chronic Pain Scale had a high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87 and intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.81. Regarding construct validity, it was identified that two factors explained 72.37% of the variance. Convergent validity showed a moderate positive correlation with the Visual Analogue Scale, the activity avoidance subscale of the Tampa Scale of Kinesophobia, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire, and the FearAvoidance Beliefs Questionnaire. A moderate negative correlation was identified with the Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale. The mean time of questionnaire administration was 2minutes and 28seconds. The Spanish version of the Graded Chronic Pain Scale appears to be a valid, reliable, and useful tool for measuring chronic pain at an early stage in Primary Care settings in Spain.

Using a convenience sampling approach and a combination of face-to-face and telephone surveys, 588 Latino adults in Oregon with arthritis were interviewed. The intensity of pain during a typical day was assessed using a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). A score of >or=7 was defined as severe pain. More than 60% of Latinos reported severe pain. Results from an ordinary least square regression indicated that among Latinos with arthritis, women, those with lower levels of education, and those reporting poor or fair self-rated health and functional limitations had higher levels of pain, after controlling for confounders. Those with severe pain were more likely than those with lower levels of pain to use over the counter medicine and home remedies to manage their arthritis. In addition, Latinos with greater pain were more likely to be interested in arthritis management programs. These findings have important implications for public health policy. The strong interest of Latinos in various arthritis and joint pain management programs could prove to be an important avenue for supporting a population with high levels of arthritic pain and lack of health insurance. These pain management programs are all the more appealing, given the availability of a number of evidence-based, low-cost interventions.\n\nThe use of the Visual Analogue Scale for the assessment of labour pain: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Chin Ke; Leng, Chow Yeow; Siew Lin, Serena Koh\n\nAssessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MASTARI). MAStARI was not used to extract data in this review as predetermined in the protocol because both of the reviewers were in agreement that the data should be extracted by a tool which focuses on the psychometric properties assessment according to the objectives of this review. Therefore, a Data Extraction Form for Psychometric Assessment was developed to extract data from papers included in the review. Four studies were included in this review: 1 RCT, 2 quasi experimental studies and a cross-sectional descriptive study. As the included studies utilised different study designs and collected data at different times, data were unable to be combined in meta analysis and are presented in narrative synthesis. Four studies were included in the review. The evidence on the psychometric properties of the labour pain scales is sparse; therefore, the use of the Visual Analogue Scale for the assessment of labour pain is currently not supported by the evidence of this review. There was evidence that showed that the use of the Visual Analogue Scale in repeated measures of labour pain, such as increasing pain, can result in inconsistency and have a 'ceiling effect'. High correlations were found between several pain scales such as Visual Analogue Scale, Box Numerical Scale and Verbal Rating Scale providing insights into the interchangeability between the scales in the obstetrical setting. In addition, the findings also "
