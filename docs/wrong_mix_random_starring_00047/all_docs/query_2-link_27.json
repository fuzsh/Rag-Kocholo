        "text": "TENNIS\n\nRoddick rolls past del Potro,\n\nearns shot at 30th career title\n\nAndy Roddick beat Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina 6-3, 6-4 Saturday at the Regions Morgan Keegan Championships in Memphis, Tenn., to advance to his 50th career tournament final.\n\nRoddick will play Milos Raonic of Canada in the championship, with the American looking for his 30th title overall and his third in the Memphis ATP event.\n\nAlso: Caroline Wozniacki, set to regain the No. 1 ranking, beat Jelena Jankovic 7-5, 6-3 at the Dubai Championships to reach her first final of the year.\n\nThe top-seeded Dane downed Jankovic for the first time and will play for the title against Svetlana Kuznetsova in Dubai, United Arab Emriates. Kuznetsova defeated Flavia Pennetta, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nRobin Soderling will play Marin Cilic in the final of the Open 13 in Marseille, France. Soderling, 16-1 this year, beat Dmitry Tursunov 7-5, 6-1, and Cilic saved a match point before downing Mikhail Youzhny, 6-2, 1-6, 7-5.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nWranglers net two late goals\n\nto post victory over Grizzlies\n\nThe Wranglers scored two power-play goals in the final three minutes to stun the Utah Grizzlies 3-2 in an ECHL game at West Valley City, Utah.\n\nJosh Lunden scored with 2:49 remaining to tie it for Las Vegas (32-17-3), and Barry Goers banged in the game winner with 38 seconds remaining. Colin Long scored in the first period for the Wranglers, who went 3-for-4 on the power play.\n\nAlso: Chicago Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville was released from the hospital, three days after being treated for gastrointestinal bleeding brought on by a small ulcer.\n\nHe is resting comfortably at home, and a full recovery is expected, team physician Dr. Michael Terry said in a statement. It is not clear when the 52-year-old coach will return to the bench for the Stanley Cup champions, whose next game is today against Pittsburgh.\n\nIn a trade between struggling teams in the Western Conference, the Colorado Avalanche acquired former No. 1 pick Erik Johnson and Jay McClement from the St. Louis Blues for Chris Stewart and Kevin Shattenkirk.\n\nThe Avalanche, who have lost 10 consecutive games, also receive a first-round pick in 2011 or 2012. Colorado surrenders a conditional second-round selection in 2011 or 2012.\n\nJohnson was the top overall pick in 2006. A rugged defenseman, he has five goals and 14 assists in 55 games this season. Johnson also helped the U.S. to a silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nUNLV softball team notches\n\nupset against No. 3 Tennessee\n\nThe UNLV softball team upset third-ranked Tennessee 4-3 to salvage a split of two games on the final day of the Desert Classic at Eller Media Stadium.\n\nAfter losing 1-0 to Southern Illinois-Edwardsville, the Rebels (4-5) scored all four of their runs against the Vols in the second inning. Heather Harrison had an RBI single, and Tayler Van Acker hit a three-run homer.\n\nTennessee (7-1) rallied with a run in the fourth, sixth and seventh innings, but couldn't overcome the deficit.\n\nAlso: Felix Sturm successfully defended his WBA middleweight title by knocking out American challenger Ronald Hearns in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nThe referee stopped the fight in the seventh round when Hearns (26-2, 20 KOs) -- son of Thomas \"Hitman\" Hearns -- was unable to stay on his feet after taking a couple of heavy blows in the corner from Sturm (35-2-1, 15 KOs).\n\nGulfstream Park officials said jockey Eibar Coa fell from his horse and suffered a serious neck injury. A news release said Coa, from Venezuela, broke his C-4 vertebrae in the fall Friday at the track in Hallandale Beach, Fla. He was hospitalized and underwent surgery.\n\nMucho Macho Man moved closer to the starting gate for the Kentucky Derby, with the 3-year-old colt holding off Santiva in the stretch to win the $300,000 Risen Star Stakes by 1Â½ lengths at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana Tech basketball player DeAndre Brown, leading the team at 15.8 points per game, was suspended indefinitely for violating athletic department policy and team rules.\n\nMarlies Schild led Austria to a 1-2 finish in the women's slalom at the world championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, living up to expectations by winning her first major title. Kathrin Zettel was second, 0.34 seconds behind.\n\nCompeting in his first race since escaping a doping ban, Alberto Contador kept alive his chances for a third straight Tour of the Algarve title by remaining in second place overall after the race's next-to-last stage in Tavira, Portugal.\n\nThe Tour de France champion completed the fourth stage out of the top 10 but remains only six seconds behind overall leader Stephen Cummings."
