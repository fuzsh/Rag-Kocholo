        "text": "My Lord Chancellor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, My Lords, and Members of the House of Commons,\n\nFor the past couple of months, I have been pondering on what message I should deliver on my birthday. Initially I wanted to write a letter to the American people, but since I devoted my life towards trying to make America a better place, I opted to deliver a message to those outside of my home country. I then deliberated on whether I should write to the people of Africa or Europe. After deep contemplation and analysing the events of the past six years, I decided to deliver my message to the British Parliament. I hope you will act on what I have to say and relay my message to the good people of Britain. I am also addressing this letter to you because I never had the privilege of addressing both Houses of the British Parliament during my lifetime.\n\nBritain has always held a special place in my heart. I’m amazed at how a small island country can give the world so much. In terms of contribution to the world, Britain excels all, including my own America. Where would the world be without Williams Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, the English language, the industrial revolution, football, the telephone, the Beatles, Isaac Newton, the Rule of Law and of course the Magna Carta?\n\nDespite all these positive contributions, all is not well with Britain. She has become “a thing-oriented society rather than a person-oriented society.” For Britain to be part of the beloved community, she has to do away with the giant triplets of racism, economic exploitation and militarism. In the next couple of pages, I will discuss the ways these evils manifest and what can be done to make Britain an integral part of the beloved community — a community based on justice and equality where the lion and lamb; the rich and poor; the classes and the masses shall lie down together and every person shall sit under his or her own fig tree and none shall be afraid.\n\nEconomic Exploitation and Poverty\n\nA number of you may find it strange that the first evil that I address is economic exploitation rather than racism. This is understandable especially as I am famed for my fight against racism and the “I have a Dream” speech, which I delivered in 1963. Just as I was passionate about fighting racism, I was equally passionate about fighting poverty and militarism because all these three evils are interlinked. To paraphrase what I once said to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a nation that will racially abuse its citizens of colour will “thingify” them and make them things; It will also exploit poor people economically. As a nation exploits the poor, it becomes attractive to foreign and domestic investments, and it will have to use its military and police might to protect these economic interests. So you can see that all of these problems are tied together.\n\nSince the onset of the Great Recession, the British political establishment has fought tooth and nail to bring the economy back on its feet. However, in the process of resolving the crisis, the government has resulted in using a sledgehammer to crack a nut on the head of the downtrodden.\n\nPrior to the financial crisis, a number of financial institutions, motivated by greed engaged in a series of unethical behaviour, which led to the worst economic crisis since 1930. As unemployment, property foreclosure and despair became the order of the day, the so-called City fell to its knees and the government came to its rescue by using £1 trillion of hard-earned taxpayers money to bail out financial institutions. The public became enraged against the banks with the latter accusing the former of “banker bashing”. Shortly after, the narrative changed from the irresponsible behaviour of the so-called Masters of the Universe to the so-called irresponsibility and immorality of the poor. As the government’s fiscal position deteriorated, words like austerity, scrounger and benefits began dripping from the lips of the political elite. Rather than acknowledge the plight of the poor impacted by the crisis, the political elite embarked on the biggest assault against poor folks since the implementation of the Poor Laws of 1834. Instead of declaring war against poverty, war was declared against the poor through the government’s austerity programme.\n\nIn order to press through these austerity measures, the political establishment embarked on a campaign to demonise what Franz Fanon calls the “Wretched of the Earth.” Once the media joined the bandwagon in bashing the poor, the lame and the homeless, the tide of public opinion began to turn against the downtrodden thereby making it easier for the government to implement its reforms. The vulnerable segments of British society have become the principal targets of the government’s spending cuts. Benefits for the unemployed and the disabled have been slashed, youth centres around the country have been closed while students have to incur excessive debts in order to get a quality education. Some of the victims of the war against the poor have paid with their lives like Mrs. Linda Wootton, a woman with a heart condition who died shortly after the government declared her fit for work. Her husband expressed the feelings of many of the least of these when he said, “I sat there and listened to my wife drown in her own body fluids. It took half an hour for her to die – and that’s a woman who’s ‘fit for work’. The last months of her life were a misery because she worried about her benefits, feeling useless, like a scrounger.”\n\nAs the poor, the underclass, the least of these, the downtrodden and the 99 per centers experience the British nightmare; the rich, the upper class, the most of these, the uptrodden and the 1 per centers are experiencing the British dream. I also find it strange that the downtrodden are portrayed as scroungers of the state. If the political elites engage in deep analysis, they would find out that the real scroungers are much closer home. Besides the financial sector, which was bailed out with £1 trillion of taxpayer’s funds, other scroungers include but are not limited to the nuclear and defence sectors, and rich farmers who enjoy government subsidies worth billions of pounds. Members of Parliament who fiddle their expenses also fall into the scrounger category. In modern day Britain, there is a kind of socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor. It is a tragedy that while financial institutions are too big to fail, the downtrodden are too small to save.\n\nWhen the legal rules in Britain were written, a strange formula to determine who was a criminal declared that the influential and mighty shouldn’t be criminalised. While it is illegal for a British teenager to steal a bottle of water worth 50p, it is not illegal for a British Oligarch to use a special purpose vehicle domiciled in a tax haven to avoid paying taxes running into millions of pounds ; while a person who claims unemployment benefit when working is liable to go to jail, a bank dealer who fixes LIBOR, which references financial instruments with notional values of hundreds of trillions of pounds is not liable to go to jail; while a homeless person can go to prison for begging, a high frequency trader who bribes an exchange to flash information relating to buy and sell orders before the information is publicly available walks freely on the street.\n\nAs the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, there has been a lack of political will to address the unsustainable level of inequality in the land. I wonder how Britain can justify the richest 1% having as much wealth as the poorest 55% of the population and I also wonder how Britain can justify 36,000 landowners owning 50% of the rural land in England and Wales. Britain prides herself on being a developed country, she prides herself on being a civilised country, and she prides herself on being a rich country, yet in the midst of plenty, there is so much lack. Many Brits are living on “a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.” In the last year, nearly a million people had to rely on food banks while 400,000 of God’s children are currently homeless. How can this be? It’s time to say NO to poverty. There is enough wealth for everyone in Britain to be well fed and housed; the wealth of the land ought to be used to satisfy the needs of many as opposed to satisfy the greed of few. There can be no real wealth without commonwealth. If Britain does not use its wealth to bridge the gap between the haves and the have not, it could be on its way to a spiritual death.\n\nI understand that the Bank of England committed a total of £375bn to Quantitative Easing. Instead of using this money to purchase assets, which favour financial speculators and continue to reinforce inequality, may I suggest where this money can be deployed? It can be deployed into the “wrinkled stomachs of the millions of God’s children who go to bed hungry at night”; it can be deployed towards ensuring a guaranteed income for all Britons; it can be deployed towards providing affordable housing for every homeless person; it can be deployed towards subsidising students tuition fee and it can be deployed towards making sure that no old person goes to bed cold. If there is enough political will, poverty in Britain can be consigned to the dustbin of history.\n\nIt is time for the political establishment to be in tune with the yearnings of the masses. At the moment, the political class does not speak or understand the language of the least of these. I guess this is because many of you come from more privileged backgrounds. Because the political elites are out of reach from poor folks, they have become out of touch with the pain of poor folks, hence poverty deliberations are now out of scope for poor folks.\n\nSome may ask, “How can I empathise with the marginalised?” The best way to appreciate the sufferings of the masses is to step into their shoes. In short there needs to be a compassionate revolving door between the political establishment and the marginalised constituency, rather than the well-oiled revolving door that currently exist between the political elites and financial firms. When I wanted to understand the plight of the poor in Chicago, I moved into one of the Chicago slums with my family. I suggest you do likewise; perhaps you could spend the summer recess along with your family members in the deprived areas of Britain. Not only will it bring you closer to the people but it will also allow you to have a better appreciation of their plight. Once the political elite is in sync with the masses, politicians will stop sending derogatory tweets like “Image from #Rochester” targeted against the working classes or making vile statements against the disabled like, “There is a group (people living with disabilities) ……. they are not worth the full minimum wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour.”\n\nThe political establishment should strive to come to the defence of the marginalised. For too long, politicians have supported the classes to the detriment of the masses. When the European Union imposed a cap on banker’s bonuses, the British Government filed a lawsuit against the EU to reverse the cap. The Treasury spent £65,000 of taxpayer’s money in preventing the EU from imposing a ban on short-selling of financial products and another £41,669 on suing the European Central Bank for discriminating against UK clearing houses. In 2011, the Prime Minister vetoed the EU treaty so as to protect the City from over 20 financial regulations. Shouldn’t the government stand up for poor folks just as it stands up for rich folks?\n\nSome of you may say, “I am really disappointed with Martin Luther King’s economic analysis.” My response to such people is that they have “not really known me, my commitment, or my calling.” I am also conscious that I might be called a communist because of my suggested radical economic reforms; for the sake of clarity, I am not a communist. “Communism is based on an ethical relativism, a metaphysical materialism, a crippling totalitarianism, and a withdrawal of basic freedom that no Christian can accept.” In addition, as Pope Francis rightly pointed out, “The communists have stolen our flag. The flag of the poor is Christian. Poverty is at the centre of the Gospel.”\n\nMilitarism\n\nThere is no doubt that Britain is a military super power possessing some of the most sophisticated weaponry. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 2013 Britain spent $57.8 billion on military expenditure, which translates to 5.2% of total government expenditure thus making Britain the 6th highest military spender in the world. The UK government also provides the arms industry, export subsidies to the tune of $1bn per annum. I cannot remain silent as the British government commits billions of dollars in military expenditure while God’s children queue for food at the various food banks flooding the country. Neither can I remain silent as cuts are made to public services that benefit the least of these. I have read about the funding crisis in the NHS and I ask myself why can’t financial resources be diverted from the Military Industrial Complex, which benefit a few to the NHS Compassionate Complex which benefits all?\n\nI am also concerned that the military industrial complex like the financial sector has captured the political class. At the height of the Arab Spring, the Prime Minister led a high-powered business delegation to the Middle East. A third of the people in the Prime Minister’s entourage were senior executives from leading British defence and aerospace companies such as BAE Systems, QinetiQ and The Thales Group. Around the same time of this visit, the British Defence Minister was attending a military arms fair at Abu Dhabi along with executives from ninety British companies. These companies were exhibiting their wares including armored vans for riot control and rubber bullets.\n\nIn another instance, shortly after the British led NATO operation had dislodged Gaddafi from Libya, the then Defence Secretary issued a rallying call for British companies to seize the moment saying, “Libya is a relatively wealthy country with oil reserves, and I expect there will be opportunities for British and other companies to get involved in the reconstruction of Libya. I would expect British companies, even British sales directors, to be packing their suitcases and looking to get out to Libya and take part in the reconstruction of that country as soon as they can.” Instead of being captured by the military industrial complex, the political elite should allow itself to be captured by the poverty compassionate complex.\n\nIn its 2013 Human Rights and Democracy Report, the Foreign Office published an overview of its activities in defending human rights and promoting democracy around the world. Included in the report were 28 countries of concern involved in gross human rights violations. Of the 28 countries, 23 have contractual arrangements to purchase arms from the United Kingdom. Isn’t it ironic that as Britain preaches with one side of her mouth freedom and democracy, with the other side of her mouth she urges some of the world’s most brutal despots to buy arms, which they sometimes use to suppress the people they govern?\n\nI also have to talk about an issue, which many of you might find uncomfortable; please be rest assured that I am doing this in love. A couple of centuries ago, Britain was the pre-eminent colonial power whose empire stretched from Australia to Zambia. It was an empire so wide that Kings and Queens could boast that the sun never set on the empire. Since the collapse of the empire in 1947, there are still some remnants, which prevail in the 21st century. There are currently 14 so-called British Overseas Territories for which Britain still retains sovereignty. Since many of these territories are located far away from the UK, it is no surprise that countries like Spain, Argentina and Mauritius dispute Britain’s sovereignty over Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and the British Indian Ocean Territory respectively. While Britain calls these areas – British Overseas Territories, the United Nations refers to them as Non-Self-Governing Territories. According to the UN, there are 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories still under colonial rule. Of the 17 territories identified, Britain accounts for 10 of these. To put it bluntly, Britain is currently colonising 10 territories with a combined population of 235,259 people. By acting as colonial masters to a quarter of a million people, Britain is in breach of UN General Assembly Resolution 2621 (XXV) which states, “The further continuation of colonial cases in all their forms and manifestations is a crime which constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and the principles of international law.” When a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council that claims to champion democracy and human rights breaches such a fundamental principle of freedom, how can it have the moral justification to tell people like Putin or Saddam Hussein not to invade Crimea or Kuwait? I urge you to put the necessary mechanisms in place to grant independence to these territories and to give back the land to the original inhabitants.\n\nRacism\n\nBritain has come a long way from the type of racism that prevailed when I visited Britain fifty years ago. Gone are the days when a person could publicly make racially explicit comments against ethnic minorities or when a landlord could boldly tell a black tenant that he’d prefer renting his house to a black dog than to a black man. In today’s Britain, racism has not disappeared in its entirety. Racism has shed its de jure skin and put on a de facto skin. The individual racism in Britain has morphed into institutional racism. Evidence of the institutional form can be seen in the British judiciary system where Negroes and Asians get tougher sentences relative to their white counterparts; it can be seen in the British media where biased coverage against people of colour prevail; it can be seen in the British educational system where Negro scholars are excluded from the ivory towers; it can be seen in the British police force where Negroes are stopped, searched and arrested at an alarming rate; it can be seen in the British work place where people with “funny sounding names” don’t get shortlisted for interviews and where the unemployment rate for Negroes and other ethnic minorities are at elevated levels. In spite of the rhetoric’s emanating from the political class about tackling racism, little has been done. As far as racial issues are concerned, the political elites exhibit “a high blood pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds”. For the purpose of this letter, I will not dwell much on this issue of institutional racism; I am only bringing it to your attention to remind you of your responsibility to the people on the less privileged side of the colour line. However, I will dwell on another manifestation of racism i.e. the treatment of immigrants.\n\nI am deeply disturbed about UK’s attitude towards its immigrant population. Since the Great Recession, the political establishment has turned its back on immigrants. The emergence of parties like UKIP has resulted in a battle among the political elite to outdo each other in demonising and ostracising immigrants. Scripture tells us, when a foreigner resides in your land, you must not mistreat them. Britain once used to be tolerant towards immigrants. Where did it all go wrong? Politicians are scaremongering and blaming every woe that befalls Britain on “those who do not look or speak like true Brits.” The comments coming out from politicians range from:\n\nThe Bad – “GO HOME OR FACE ARREST”,\n\nThe Ugly – “In some areas of the UK, down the east coast, towns do feel under siege, with large numbers of migrant workers and people claiming benefits,”\n\nThe Outrageous – “Any normal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door.”\n\nThe rhetoric coming from the political elite can be linked to the increase in racism prevailing in the land as the demonisation of immigrants only serves to trigger the latent racial instinct in the hearts of many people. As the media continues to poison the mind of the general population against immigrants, the Office of Communication (Ofcom) turns a blind eye. Every rape, murder, theft, arson is attributed to one immigrant group or the other. The Roma community in particular has been the principal target of these attacks. Programmes like My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, My Big Fat Gypsy Christmas and My Big Fat Gypsy Christening reinforce stereotypes about members of the Roma community. Ever since politicians and the media turned up its verbal assault against Eastern European immigrants, should it be any surprise that there has been an uptick in violent attacks against these children of God?\n\nMany of the government’s anti immigration policies have not been well thought out. Thousands of immigrants are detained in deplorable conditions, while there is a proposal to expel foreign students from Britain after their graduation. The government’s immigration regulation, which shifts responsibility on landlords to check the residential status of prospective tenants could result in housing discrimination against non-white people. More shocking is the recent consultation paper issued by the Home Office on terrorism, which calls for nursery school staff and registered child minders to report toddlers who are at risk of becoming terrorists. I find it absurd that a toddler who can barely walk could be a terrorist. This proposed policy has the potential to criminalise Arab and Muslim toddlers. I thought nothing could be as disturbing as the criminalisation of Negro youths until I heard of the proposed criminalisation of Muslim toddlers, which is reckless at best, and callous at worst. Is Britain gradually morphing into a Gestapo society where landlords, teachers and child minders are co-opted as spies?\n\nPoliticians must reassess their attitudes towards immigrants. Whenever the political elites complain about the influx of immigrants, they must bear in mind that there are over 5.5 million British emigrants permanently living abroad; whenever British politicians suggest immigrants are lazy and live on benefits, they must also bear in mind that there are a number of Britons who go to poor countries around the world and prey on vulnerable young boys and girls and use financial inducements to sexually exploit their victims. In framing the debate about immigration, the political class has developed a historical amnesia by failing to anchor immigration to Britain’s role in meddling in the affairs of other countries. Centuries ago, Britain went uninvited to many countries to enslave the people, take their lands and plunder their resources. In his book titled “All the Countries We’ve Ever Invaded: And the Few We Never Got Round To”, Stuart Laycock argues that Britain has invaded 90 per cent of the countries in the world; he cites that only 22 countries have never been invaded by Britain. Since the wealth of Britain was built on the bent and broken backs of the black and brown people of Africa and the Indian Subcontinent, Britain has no moral justification to stigmatise hardworking immigrants who come to this country to seek better opportunities than they can find at home.\n\nOther Matters\n\nAs a minister of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ and also as the son, grandson and great-grandson of Baptist ministers, I must say something about the treatment of Christians in Britain. The United Kingdom has a rich Christian heritage. Britain played a major role in spreading the Gospel to the four corners of the world. Thanks to King James I, the Bible is now accessible to the masses. Britain gave us great Men of God like John Wesley, Smith Wigglesworth, William Booth, Charles Spurgeon and George Jeffreys. However in today’s Britain, the environment is becoming hostile to Christians who are ridiculed and in some cases persecuted because of their faith. Some laws have been enacted which put pressure on Christians to compromise their faith. I also understand some people say that God is dead in Britain. I would like to talk to them about it because “it disturbs me to know that God died and I didn’t have a chance to attend the funeral. They haven’t been able to tell me yet the date of his death. They haven’t been able to tell me yet who the coroner was that pronounced him dead. They haven’t been able to tell me yet where he’s buried.” I appeal to you to make Britain more conducive for Christians and provide them with the protection that you provide followers of other faiths.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is not my intention to be hostile or to make you feel guilty, so if I come across as hostile or preachy, please accept my apology. Prior to dictating this message to Alatenumo, I considered titling my letter “Why Britain May Go To Hell?” But I thought this would be unfair to the British people as the masses are already experiencing hell on earth. I decided it was not the British masses that needed addressing but those in high places. As rulers in the highest place in the United Kingdom, the buck stops with you.\n\nWhen I see the despair on the faces of the least of these, I see people whose voices have been silenced and whose cries have failed to reach the ears of those in high places. As lawmakers in the land, you are in the privileged position of making a positive impact on the lives of the downtrodden. You need to realise that Britain can never be a first class nation as long as she has second-class citizens who are stripped of their dignity and humanity. When the history books are written say a hundred years from now, how would you want to be remembered? Would you want to be remembered as that generation of politicians who restructured Britain on the symmetric foundation of justice and equality, or would you want to be remembered as that generation of politicians who structured Britain on the asymmetric foundation of injustice and inequality? The choice is yours and history is watching.\n\nSelah.\n\nYours in love\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\n(Translated by Ahmed ‘Alatenumo’ Sule)\n\nIt is time for the Negro middle class to rise up from its stool of indifference, to retreat from its flight into unreality and bring its full resources its heart, its mind, and its checkbook to the aid of the less fortunate brother.\n\nMartin Luther King\n\nBut it must be acknowledged that in the black elite’s strained relations with poorer blacks, white supremacy got two for the price of one. The overly watched black aristocracy over-watched the black poor, themselves already fixed by a damning white gaze in the optics of racial paranoia.\n\nMichael Eric Dyson\n\nOur people in the Negro community are trapped in a vicious cycle of ignorance, poverty, disease, sickness, and death. There seems to be no way out. No way of escape. The wealthy, educated Black bourgeoisie, those uppity Negroes who do escape, never reach back and pull the rest of our people out with them. The Black masses remain trapped in the slums.\n\nMalcolm X\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nNinety-one years ago, in a paper titled “An Appeal To The Soul of White America”, Marcus Garvey wrote, “Surely the soul of liberal, philanthropic, liberty –loving, white America is not dead.” Garvey in the same paper made an appeal to the conscience of white America to listen to the cries of the “awakened Negro for a place in the sun.” As we start 2015, I appeal to the conscience of the Black middle class in the Western world to attend to the cries of millions of black masses trapped on the wrong side of the color line. Surely the soul of the black middle class in the West is not dead.\n\nThe black middle class in many Western countries such as Australia, Canada, Britain and the USA has overcome many barriers to enjoy some of the milk and honey of the land. The black elites ability to defeat racism, prejudice and poverty and still remain standing is a testament to their resilience, intelligence and commitment. They have worked hard, studied hard and sweat hard, so they surely deserve to enjoy the trappings of the middle class life. Even though a few Blacks in the West enjoy the middle class lifestyle, there are millions of other blacks caught up in what Martin Luther King referred to as a, “Lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.” As a collective group, the black middle class has not used its vantage position to fight for the cause of its struggling brethren. It is for this reason that I am appealing to the soul and conscience of the black elite to wake up from its apathy and respond to the cries of its unfortunate brethren.\n\nThroughout the West, the black masses are under siege. The black underclass is one of the most severely impacted groups affected by the consequences of the Great Recession. With the emergence of extreme right wing groups throughout the West, mainstream political parties have gone on the offensive against the most marginalized. Racism in both its overt and subvert forms is on the ascendency. In Australia, the cultural genocide of the Aboriginal community is in full swing while in Britain, the media are constantly dehumanizing immigrants just as the main political parties engage in battle to see who can be more hostile to “those who do not look or speak like real Brits”. In America, the police are gunning down innocent black men at the same time as the black underclass serves as a source of profit for the privatized prison industrial complex.\n\nWhy am I appealing to the conscience of the black middle class? I could have made an appeal to your intelligence, but I know that one could find some logical explanation for not responding to the plight of the black underclass. I could have made an appeal to your pockets, but throwing money at the problem confronting the black masses will not address the structural issues facing the masses. Instead, I appeal to your conscience because as human beings with blood flowing through your veins, I believe you have some measure of compassion and empathy stored up in your heart which should enable you to look at the injustice in the West from the viewpoint of your less privileged brothers and sisters.\n\nBefore I proceed further, I am aware that I might be accused of making sweeping generalization about the black middle class. Some may argue that I am committing a fallacy of composition. I am also conscious of the fact that there are a number of individuals from this privileged strata of society who are actively involved in the emancipation of their less unfortunate brethren. However in spite of these potential counterarguments, as a collective block the black bourgeoisie could do more to help out the “least of these.”\n\nAs the black elites climb higher up the Western social ladder, move deeper into the suburbs and mingle with the privileged of all races, they have become more detached from their less privileged cousins. This has consequently led to a situation whereby the tears, wail and pain of the black masses have gone unnoticed. Members of the black middle class who choose not to respond to the cries of the black working class can be classified into three categories namely the Bootstrapist, the Self-absorbist and the Fatalist.\n\nThe Bootstrapist is an advocate of the bootstrap philosophy, which suggests that for people to succeed in life, they have to do it by their own effort; in short they have to lift themselves up by their own bootstrap. The Bootstrapist black elite often believes that the less fortunate find themselves in that position because they fail to take personal responsibility. This type of bourgeoisie has made a conscious decision to side with the classes to the detriment of the masses. He often feels uncomfortable being around “unsuccessful” members of his own race. If a black underclass tries to explain his misfortune on racism or poverty, the Bootstrapist would quickly interject saying, “You are always using the race card” or “You are always blaming the white man for your woes”. A Bootstrapist takes pride in being colorblind. Because she has succeeded against the odds, the Bootstrapist shows no compassion for her less privileged brothers and sister. The Bootstrapist takes a simplified view of racism and would argue that the black masses are on the wrong side of the privilege line because of the hoodies they wear, the way they talk, their family structure or due to moral bankruptcy. The Bootstrapist suffers from a troika of Racial Myopia, Poverty Alzheimer and what President Obama calls “Empathy Deficit.”\n\nThe Bootstrapist fails to see the structural causes of the misfortune affecting the “least of these”, such as racism, the prison industrial complex, bias in the criminal justice system, economic policies that stifle the 99 per centers etc; instead they focus on token gains by the few black elites sitting on top of the social ladder. Because the Bootstrapist wears “boots”, he assumes that everyone has boots and should therefore be able to pull themselves by their own bootstrap. But how can the bootless black masses be expected to pull themselves by their own bootstrap? Martin Luther King once said, “It’s all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.” The Bootstrapists are loved by politicians and are often used directly or indirectly as stooges to keep the black masses in check. Politicians will point to the successes of the Bootstrapists to castigate the black masses that are below the breadline. The Bootstrapist black elite is often supportive of Western government policies that suppress members of the black and non-black underclass such as Western governments harsh anti immigration and austerity policies – which is a clear case of a turkey voting for Christmas or a ram voting for Eid-el-Kabir (as such policies indirectly impact the black middle class).\n\nIn contrast to the Bootstrapist, the Self-absorbist does not exhibit any hatred for his less fortunate brethren. While the Bootstrapist sees the suffering masses but refuses to see the structures causing the suffering, the Self-absorbist is so caught up in his own world that he fails to see neither his suffering brothers and sisters nor the structures causing the suffering. The Self-absorbist is focused on only one thing: SELF. The Self-absorbist elites concentrate solely on their career, their family, their children, their leisure, their comfort and their happiness. As a consequence, they are unable to see the injustice taking place around them. They suffer from an Alice-In-Wonderland syndrome where they live in a fantasy world where everything is good. Since they are doing well, they have a blind faith in the system even though the system has left many of their black brothers and sisters on the margins. They are so engrossed pursuing the so-called American, British, Canadian or Australian Dream that they fail to see the American, the British, the Canadian or the Australian Nightmare holding the black masses down.\n\nThe Fatalist is the most compassionate of the irresponsive black elite. Unlike the Bootstrapist and the Self-absorbist, the Fatalist is not only aware of the suffering black masses and the structural causes, but is also sympathetic to the plight of the black underclass. However, the Fatalist does nothing to alleviate the suffering of the masses because he feels that his effort to change things will amount to nothing. The Fatalist believes that there will always be injustice and racism so there is no need doing anything to change the system.\n\nWith the demonization, ostracization and criminalization of the black underclass continuing unabated in the West, the black elite should not and cannot continue to maintain its wall of silence and apathy. Some may say, “But why should I be bothered about the black underclass when I am doing fine? After all, I have a good job, drive a nice car, live in a good neighborhood and my children are in good schools.” I beg to disagree with this line of reasoning as it assumes that life is not interlinked. It assumes that we all live in an island. As Martin Luther King wrote while in a Birmingham jail, “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” The Black classes and the Black masses are tied in a single garment of destiny. The black bourgeoisie in the West can never be truly respected as long as the black masses are disrespected and dehumanized. We may be the only black person in our office, we may be the only black person at Wimbledon, we may be the only black person in the theatre, we may be the only black person on our streets, our kids may be the only black children in their schools, but so long as the black masses are looked down upon by the dominant Western culture, the black middle class will not be immune. In case you think that that my claim is a hyperbole, perhaps you may want to examine the plight of Lawrence Otis Graham.\n\nGraham is a black upper middle class attorney living the quintessential American dream. He graduated from two Ivy League institutions, married a beautiful and intelligent wife who was the first African American woman to become a partner at one of the worlds leading management consulting firms. They live in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in New York, which is populated by White people, and their children attend one of the top private schools in the area. Although Graham grew up experiencing discrimination, he tried everything within his power to protect his children from facing racial discrimination. Their children had the perfect diction and Mr. and Mrs. Graham’s developed a set of rules to immunize their kids from being racially profiled such as: “Always zip your backpack firmly closed or leave it in the car or with the cashier so that you will not be suspected of shoplifting” and “If you must wear a T- shirt to an outdoor play event or on a public street, it should have the name of a respected and recognizable school emblazoned on its front.” Graham said he and his wife, “Believed that if we worked hard and maintained great jobs, we could insulate our children from the blatant manifestations of bigotry that we experienced as children in the 1960s and ’70s.” Despite all the efforts to shield their children from racism through their elite upbringing, one day when his son was walking, a car pulled up in front of him and the occupants called the boy a nigger. Graham raised the issue with the school authorities who just waved the issue aside. The Graham’s were shaken by the racism experienced by their son with Graham saying, “The boarding-school incident this summer was a turning point for us — particularly for my son and his younger siblings. Being called a nigger was, of course, a depressing moment for us all. But it was also a moment that helped bring our surroundings into clearer focus. The fact that it happened just days before the police shooting of Michael Brown increased its resonance for our family.” The morale of the Graham’s plight is that no matter how high up a black person is on the Western social ladder, one is not immune from some of the problems confronting the black underclass.\n\nAnother reason why it is in the interest of the black middle class to come to the defense of the black underclass is because many members of the black middle class are just one, two or three pay cheques away from slipping from the heights of the middle class into the depths of the underclass. The black elite cannot remain silent as the black underclass continues to suffer because the numbers do not lie. Earlier on, I gave a high level overview of some of the issues confronting the black underclass in the West. I would now go further by detailing some of the disturbing statistics, which show that the plight faced by the black masses in the West is not a fairytale.\n\nThere is an over-representation of blacks in the Western criminal justice system. According to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, between 2010 and 2011 a black person relative to a white person was eleven times more likely to be stopped by the Metropolitan Police. A research conducted by Release, the drugs charity concluded that the policing and prosecutions of drug possession offences in England and Wales is unduly focused on black and minority communities. It notes that relative to whites, blacks are 6 times more likely to be stopped and searched for drugs, more likely to be charged for possessing cocaine and less likely to be cautioned even though Black people use less drugs than white people. The same trend occurs in the USA. According to Michelle Alexander in her book The New Jim Crow, relative to a white male convicted of the same drug crime, an African-American male is given an average of 20 to 50 times longer prison term. She also notes that of the over 2.3 million men imprisoned in America, seventy percent of them are either blacks or Hispanics.\n\nA study by the Center for Economic Policy and Research revealed that in the USA, the unemployment rate for black college graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 was 12.4% compared to 5.6% for non-black college graduates. The study notes that black and other ethnic minorities workers are twice as likely to be unemployed as whites. In Britain, the youth unemployment among blacks was 20% compared to 8% unemployment rate for white youths in 2013. In Australia and Canada, ever since the Aborigines had their land confiscated by the colonialists, they have been treated as third class citizens in their own land. The Aboriginals rank at the bottom of most social indicators ranging from life expectancy to literacy. Sam Cooper of the Province magazine summed up the attitude towards the Aboriginal in Canada when he wrote, “Racism against aboriginals in B.C (British Columbia) runs so deep that we barely recognize it. It’s in our DNA, it’s in our children’s vocabulary, it’s absorbed by new immigrants as soon as they land.”\n\nBefore I proceed further, I would like to briefly discuss a particular trait exhibited by a few African elites in Diaspora, who grew up and were educated in Africa before moving to the West. As a result of growing in Africa were racism is rare (although tribalism prevails) these African elites in Diaspora were accustomed to seeing people of their own skin tone rise to the pinnacle of society. Shortly after relocating to the West, they had the fortune of securing good jobs and living a comfortable middle class life. Upon assuming this Western middle class lifestyle, a few members of Africans in Diaspora have developed a mindset where they feel that other blacks have not taken advantage of the “opportunities” that the West provides. This has led to some of these middle class Africans based in the USA, Britain and Australia looking down on their African Americans, Caribbean and Aboriginal brethren. As a consequence some African elites make derogatory statements against their brethren such as, “African Americans have a chip on their shoulder always blaming racism for their misfortune” or “African American men are always in prison and the women are single mothers,” in Britain, some middle class Africans suggest that their Caribbean brothers are lazy people who do not want to work. My message to these African elites who have this mindset is that they need to realize that the token gains that they obtained in the West is as a result of the struggles and blood shed by the very people who they look down on. If the African Americans had not fought against Jim Crow, educated Africans would not have had the opportunity to come to America to study and work; if the Caribbean’s had not stood their ground in the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s the token gains enjoyed by the British African middle classes would have been none existence. So rather than having a sense of entitlement, the African middle class in Diaspora should show some humility and acknowledge the struggles of their fellow brothers and sisters.\n\nThrough its silence and apathy, the Western black elites have betrayed their black working class counterparts. Betrayal occurs not only when one party provides information to an enemy, which exposes that person to harm; it also occurs when a person is hurt as a result of someone not giving help. In comparing traitors of different races, Marcus Garvey said, “The traitor of other races is generally confined to the mediocre or irresponsible individual, but, unfortunately, the traitors among the Negro race are generally to be found among the men highest placed in education and society.” It is time for the black middle class to do some soul searching. As a collective group, the black middle class in the West like Nicodemus must become born again. There needs to be a change in the mindset of the Western black bourgeoisie. The black middle class should start to look at life in the West through the lens of the humanity of the masses rather than through the lens of the humanity of the classes. The black elite should strive to see things from the viewpoint of the broader confine of the collective black underclass rather than through the narrow confine of his own individualism. With this change of mindset, the black elite will no longer be deceived by token gains, which put a few blacks at the top and leave the majority of blacks at the bottom of the pile. The elite will then start to acknowledge that all is not well with the black underclass, which should hopefully spur him to action.\n\nFor long, the black underclass has been told to accept personal responsibility by their more successful brothers and sisters. It is now time for the black elite to accept its own responsibility in helping out its less fortunate brethren. For the Fatalist who justifies his inaction because injustice will always be around, he needs to realize that most of the benefits we enjoy in our world today occurred because sometime ago someone somewhere acted. There was a time when it seemed that slavery would never end, but some people acted and slavery ended; there was a time when it was normal for women not to vote, then some people acted and women were allowed to vote. Your voice no matter how low the tone can make a change. As Obama eloquently put it, “One voice can change a room, and if one voice can change a room, then it can change a city, and if it can change a city, it can change a state, and if it can change a state, it can change a nation, and if it can change a nation, it can change the world. Your voice can change the world.” For the Bootstrapist who shows no compassion towards the black underclass to paraphrase a comment by Robert Kennedy, if the Bootstrapist black elite continues to insist that the black underclass should lift himself by his own bootstrap, let him be willing to lose all his money, all his influence, live in the ghetto and be tortured with racism and poverty. Then and only then has he a right to such a claim.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I am not suggesting that every black elite in the West should suddenly become a Martin Luther King or a Malcolm X. However, the black elite could strive to take up a personal cause impacting the black underclass and run with it. There are lots of causes begging for attention such as racism, poverty, gang warfare, income inequality, poor educational attainment, immigrants drowning in the sea, criminal injustice, racial profiling etc. There are also many ways in which the black elite can help – if you can’t shout, you can march; if you can’t march, you can lobby, if you can’t lobby, you can protest, if you can’t protest, you can finance, if you can’t finance, you can mentor, if you can’t mentor, you can petition. Just do something.\n\nThe black middle class should also extend its compassion to non-blacks. Throughout the West, the underclasses of all races are getting a rough deal. In the USA, the Hispanics face the same level of discrimination as blacks; in Britain, Eastern Europeans and the Roma community in particular have been caught up in the cross fire of the anti immigration rhetoric emanating from the media and politicians. At the same time nearly a million people in Britain from all races rely on food banks.\n\nFinally, the black elite should become good stewards by striving to make things better than the way they found it. The benefits which the black middle class enjoys in the West today is as a result of the collective efforts of individuals from previous generations who stood up and said enough is enough. The black underclass is increasing exponentially and if this trend continues, the next generation will face a life of misery. It is therefore critical that the present day black elite add their voices, intelligence, influence and resources to stop this trend.\n\nThe black middle class can still be passionate about living in good neighborhoods, perusing school league tables, monitoring property prices and driving flashy cars at the same time as fighting for justice and equality for the black underclass as all these commitments are not mutually exclusive. So I plead to the conscience of the black middle class on the basis of love to heed to the cry of the black underclass. As you ride along the road be on the lookout for the wounded man by the wayside. When you see the wounded man, please come out of your car and attend to the person who Jesus Christ calls the “least of these”, who the occupy movement calls “the 99 per centers”, who Frantz Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth” and who Michael Eric Dyson calls “the ghettocracy” – who has been left naked, beaten and half dead on the Western road to Jericho.\n\nSelah.\n\nAhmed Olayinka Sule, CFA\n\n01 January 2015\n\nTranscribed by Ahmed ‘Alatenumo’ Sule\n\nDear President Obama,\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and that your soul is prospering. I wanted to write this letter to you longhand, but I was not sure if you would be able to read my handwriting, hence I have asked Alatenumo to transcribe what I have to say. So if there is anything lost in translation, please accept my apologies.\n\nFive decades ago, I stood in the shadow of the author of the Emancipation Proclamation to tell America about a dream. When I made this speech, I never knew that fifty years on, it would continue to reverberate around the four corners of the world. Watching you as you addressed America as its first Negro president at the same spot where I spoke fifty years ago brought a smile to my face. However, I must also confess that seeing you address the country also brought a tear to my face. In short, reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the “I Have A Dream Speech” has been a bittersweet experience for me. One part of me is happy about the progress America has made as a nation since the speech, while another part of me is saddened by the lack of progress the country has made since the speech.\n\nWhen I was on earth, I took a three dimensional approach in finding answers to America’s moral problems by focusing on what I called the three triplets of evil i.e. racism, economic injustice and militarism. I would therefore like to use this same three dimensional approach in accessing your presidency and the progress America has made since I made the speech.\n\nRacism\n\nDuring the early years of the struggle, I spent considerable energy addressing the evil of racism and it is for this I became famous. At the time when I gave the speech, things were dire for the Negro. Our alienable rights were denied. We did not have the freedom to school where we wanted to school, sleep where we wanted to sleep and eat where we wanted to eat. We lived in a segregated society.\n\nFifty years later, a lot of progress has been made. Segregation is now a thing of the past. A Negro can now aspire to the highest position in the land as evidenced by your election twice as the President of the United States of America. I am glad that the Negro is exercising his citizen rights. We now have Negro senators, governors and Mayors. Since my speech, we have seen a Negro defense chief, two Negro Secretaries of State, a Negro Attorney General and three Negro National Security Advisers.\n\nIt is not only in the political establishment that the glass ceiling has been broken for the people of color. In sports, the Negro is excelling in a number of so-called lily-white sports. I am pleased with the accomplishments of the Williams Sisters in tennis and Tiger Woods in golf. In the business world, many Negroes have excelled. There are a number of Negro CEO’s of Fortune 500 and S&P 500 companies and countless Negro managers, senior managers, and directors in these organizations. Our people have been able to set up businesses and own houses, which has helped increase the wealth in the Negro community. We are also excelling academically. Enrollment into schools is much higher than the enrollment rate fifty years ago. Racial expletives such as “nigger” and “coon” that were prevalent back in the days are frowned at nowadays. It is also rare for a white person to call a grownup Negro a “boy”.\n\nSo yes, there has been a lot of progress since 1963 and I am optimistic that more progress is on the way. However, we need to be mindful that we are not blinded by these gains and thereby overlook the subtle forms of racism. After I departed this world, I have seen racism metamorphose from the conscious form to a subtle and institutional form. This new form of racism is more dangerous than the old form because it cannot be easily proved, detected or solved. It comes in many forms and guises. One area is the criminal justice system, where the Negroes are grossly over represented. Negroes account for a million out of the 2.3 million people imprisoned in America. A Negro is six times more likely to be imprisoned relative to his white counterpart. I also understand that if the current incarceration rate continues, that one out of every three Negro male born in 2013 could spend time in prison during his lifetime. I am concerned that Negroes are imprisoned for drug related offences at 10 times the rate of whites even though 5 times as many Whites are using drugs as Negroes. I was heartbroken when I heard about what happened to Trayvon Martin, a young man cut down in his prime just because of the color of his skin. I pray that God Almighty will comfort his family.\n\nI once said that a curious formula seemed to declare that a Negro was fifty percent of a person because at the time, the Negro had half of the good things of whites and twice of the bad things of whites. I still stand by that claim. Today, the unemployment rate for Negro men is 15% compared to 7 % for whites; the median income for black men is 67% of that of white men; 8 per cent of the Negro population has lost the right to vote as a result of a felony conviction compared to 2% for other races.\n\nWe also need to be mindful of what my Brother Malcolm X called “token solutions”. While one needs to celebrate the successes of the token Negroes living in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity, one should not forget the many Negroes living on the lonely island of poverty. There are many Negroes oppressed by racism, who do not have the clout, education or resources to overcome the consequences of racism. I am a bit disappointed with some of those Negroes who have crossed the color line, but have not bothered to look back at their brothers and sisters suffering the ravages of racism. Sometimes, they look down on the less fortunate Negroes and tell them to lift themselves by their own bootstrap. While I acknowledge the importance of personal responsibility, many of our Negroes who W.E. Du Bois called the Talented Tenth, who Edward Franklin Frazier called Black Bourgeoisie, who Malcolm X called uppity Negroes and who Michael Dyson calls the Afristocracy fail to or refuse to look at the structural factors that cause the Negro to remain down. And I said before “It is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he should lift himself up by his own bootstraps. It is even worse to tell a man to lift himself up by his own bootstraps when somebody is standing on the boot.”\n\nI was disappointed to see a key part of the Voting Right Act, which my colleagues and I fought relentlessly for, struck down by the Supreme Court in June this year. I worry that this gives a number of States in the South the motivation to revise their election laws, which could result in the disenfranchisement of Negro voters in these states.\n\nWhere do you stand in the scheme of things? You have made some bold statements on race like your “A More Perfect Union Speech” in response to the Pastor Jeremiah Wright saga and your recent comment in respect of the Trayvon Martin incident. Furthermore, the Attorney General’s suggestion on the need for a national race conversation is commendable. While I am conscious of the fact that you are President of United States of America and not the President of Negro America, I urge you to do more in addressing racism, especially the institutional form.\n\nEconomic Injustice\n\nAlthough I am appreciative that I am celebrated for my stance on racism, I am a bit perplexed that my stance on economic injustice is generally ignored. Just as I was passionate about fighting racism, I was equally passionate about fighting economic injustice, which affects the brotherhood of man whether black, brown or white. It is interesting to see how there has been an overemphasis on my words, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character”; while many don’t know that shortly before my death, I was planning a Poor People’s Campaign. The plan was to lead poor black and white people to build tent settlements on the National Mall, something similar to what the Occupy Wall Street movement did at Zuccotti Park.\n\nIt is unfortunate that in today’s America many white and Negroes live on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. In short, while a number of people are living the American dream, many are experiencing the American nightmare especially in the aftermath of the Great Recession. I am concerned about the level of economic inequality in America. A country in which one per cent of the population controls 42 per cent of the wealth; a country in which those earning over $300,000 see their income increase by 33 percent over a 20 year period while the rest of America sees its earnings stagnate; a country in which the richest 400 individuals have the combined wealth of the bottom 150 million citizens is a country that has lost its soul. I also hear that the Federal Reserve Bank has been printing shiploads of money, which have enabled financial institutions and other speculators make loads of money, yet millions of Americans still depend on food stamps. I know where some of this money used for the so-called quantitative easing can go to, it can go to the wrinkled stomachs of the millions of God’s children who go to bed hungry at night. America can never be a first class nation as long as she has second-class citizens drowning in the well of poverty. Furthermore, as I said before, “If America does not use her vast resources of wealth to end poverty and make it possible for all of God’s children to have the basic necessities of life, she, too, will go to hell.”\n\nObama, I must commend you for your effort at trying to ensure that millions have access to healthcare insurance. I know that you will face opposition from many, but my word for you is to be strong and bold. You have to see this through. However, I feel that you are compromising too much on the healthcare reform and if you continue to give ground to the opposition, the watered down version of the so-called Obamacare may defeat its original purpose.\n\nBesides your healthcare reform, you have done little to address economic inequality in America. I was saddened that during your election campaign, you rarely mentioned the poor. Your emphasis seemed to be on the middle class. While I appreciate that the middle class are also impacted by this Great Recession, the people at the front line of the recession are the millions of poor Americans; so while focusing on the middle class, please give at least equal attention to the poor.\n\nOn another note, it appears that in the aftermath of the Great Recession, it is now business as usual for those that caused the crisis in the first place. While many people now have to work later in life, while many people have seen their pensions decimated; while many people have lost their jobs; while many people are losing their homes — some people are collecting millions in bonuses and smiling all the way to the bank instead of spending time in the prison cell for the havoc they caused on millions of God’s children.\n\nObama, it is a shame that your government is pandering to the interest of Wall Street and you have reneged on your promise to prevent the lobbyists from infiltrating the White House. You have also surrounded yourself with those who want the status quo to remain, so it should be know surprise that the Financial reforms, which was launched with such fanfare, has been watered down by intense lobbying.\n\nMilitarism\n\nMr. President, I have to be harsh with you and tell you that you have failed in the area of militarism. Towards the tail end of my life, I decided to speak out on the militarization of America. I was a vocal advocate against the war in Vietnam even though it cost me my popularity. During your address at the Lincoln Memorial, you rightly pointed out that economic opportunity was our great unfinished business, however throughout that speech you failed to mention a single word about militarism. One cannot talk about economic injustice without talking about militarism and racism, because these three evils are all interlinked. As I once said before, “A nation that will keep people in slavery for 244 years will “thingify” them and make them things. And therefore, they will exploit them and poor people generally economically. And a nation that will exploit economically will have to have foreign investments and everything else, and it will have to use its military might to protect them. All of these problems are tied together.”\n\nWhen you began your political career, you spoke out against the war in Iraq at a time when it was unpopular to voice a dissent against the government’s policy towards Iraq. When you were elected, you promised to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and you put measures in place to reduce America’s military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, you now seem to have turned from a dove into a war hawk with the words “drone attack” and “PRISM” dripping from your lips.\n\nYou claim to be a constitutional lawyer, yet you feel comfortable holding weekly meetings with your security advisers over a cup of tea and biscuit to determine whom around the world to kill. In the process of targeting terrorist through your drone policy, you have succeeded in killing innocent civilians including many women and children. Have you considered what would be the impact if other countries like China, Russia and Iran also decide to replicate your drone programme by drawing a list of selected enemies to strike down? If not, I think you should start dwelling on it before the world becomes an unsafe place to walk the streets.\n\nI am also bothered that you have sanctioned the collection of surveillance information about private citizens in different parts of the world. Besides people, you have also been monitoring governments around the world in addition to the United Nations. Oh Obama, I can imagine John the Baptist coming out of the River Jordan pointing his fingers towards you saying, “OBAMA REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS AT HAND!!!” I can imagine, the Master saying “ OBAMA, FOR WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT A MAN TO GAIN THE WORLD AND LOSE HIS SOUL and I can imagine Prophet Amos screaming at the top of his voice, “ OBAMA, LET JUSTICE ROLL DOWN LIKE WATERS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE A MIGHTY STREAM.”\n\nIn addition, your East Asian foreign policy or the so-called “Pivot to the East” programme seems to me like empire building. Why do you want to increase America’s hegemony in the East while millions of American’s cannot afford decent accommodation, decent clothing and decent food? As the saying goes, charity begins at home.\n\nReports reaching me tell me that you are planning to wage war against Syria. While I doubt if this is true, if I am proved wrong then I have to let you know in advance that I find it hypocritical that you can stand before the world on the anniversary of my speech telling them about my dream, while putting finishing touches to strike Syria. As you are well aware, I am a pacifist and I would not be a party to any attack on a nation, especially when United Nations has not finished conducting its investigation and there is no clear evidence that chemical weapons have been used despite reports in the media. Obama, how quick are you to forget about Iraq, by trying to commit America into a war without any UN resolution. Obama, I don’t know who is advising you, but please listen to your heart, rather than following the advice of David Cameron and François Hollande. I know that you have boxed yourself into a tight corner by saying that if the Syrian Government made use of any chemical weapon that it would be a “game changer”, however you should not let pride or the fear of how you will be perceived act as the basis for plunging America into another war.\n\nYou have also not done much to tame the military industrial complex. I find it surprising that the US Government spends almost $1 trillion on defense related expenditure at a time when almost 50 million Americans are living in poverty. Do we really need to spend this amount of money on our military?\n\nIn 2009 when you won the Nobel Peace Prize, you said you were, “surprised and deeply humbled” by the award. During your speech, you quoted me and though you acknowledged that you stood there as a consequence of my work, you also said that,” the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace.” How wrong can you be? Don’t you know that, “Wars are poor chisels for carving out peaceful tomorrows?” As a Nobel Prize Peace recipient, you need to realize that the prize is a commission, a commission to work harder for the brotherhood of man. If you find it impossible to make that commitment to work for the brotherhood of man, I suggest you return the award and the money back to the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\n\nFather To Son Discussion\n\nMr. Obama, I see you from four-dimensional points of view. First of all, I see you as a creation of God, a part of humanity. Second, I see you as my son. Then I see you as a fellow Negro and finally, I see you as the President of the United States of America. So just as a father can give his son honest advice, I also hope to do the same with you my son. Please do not be offended at what I have to say in the next couple of paragraphs. Just take it as constructive criticism. You have read enough about me to know that I have always spoken truth to power. I spoke the truth to President Kennedy, I spoke the truth the Lyndon Johnson and if I can speak the truth to these two great American presidents, I see no reason why I can’t speak the truth to you my son.\n\nMy son, I love you from the bottom of my heart. I see a lot of similarity between you and I. In some ways, you remind me of myself. You are intelligent, you are black, and you are a great orator. You are married to a lady with a beautiful heart who reminds me of my Coretta. You are also a likeable person. However, that seems to be were the similarity ends. In recent years, you have changed.\n\nWhen you first came on the scene, the whole world was excited. They saw you as a breath of fresh air that would blow the wind of change on White House. Your slogan “Yes We Can” and “Change We Can Believe In” resonated around the world. You were the number one change agent around the world. Your infectious smile brought joys to millions around the world. Men cried like babies when they heard you speak and women fainted when they heard you speak. I would never forget seeing Oprah crying on a man shoulder as she heard you give your victory speech in Chicago. Unfortunately, that seems like a long while ago.\n\nYou are good at speeches, but it is hard to reconcile your speeches with your actions. In short you could sometimes come across someone who has: A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OF CREEDS AND AN ANEMIA OF DEEDS.\n\nIn addition, in trying to achieve some of your government’s goals, you appear to have adopted the principle of “the end justifies the means”, without giving serious consideration to the linkage between the ends and the means. Your administrations approach to American security can be summarized as follows: “As long as we achieve our ‘end’ to significantly keep America and the world secure, it doesn’t matter what type of ‘means’ we use. We hope to achieve our ‘end’ BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. My son, you need to realize that ends are not cut off from means, because the means represent the ideal in the making, and the end in process, and ultimately you can’t reach good ends through evil means.” You cannot achieve a moral end of keeping America secure by snooping on Americans and other people around the world; you cannot achieve a moral end of eradicating terrorism by using drones, which end up killing innocent women and children; you cannot achieve a moral end of maintaining America’s hegemony in the East by piling up military ammunitions in the East; you cannot achieve a moral end of ensuring economic prosperity for all by pandering to the merchants from Wall Street.\n\nMy son, I may be wrong, but sometimes, I get the impression that you like to use other people’s struggles as a photo opportunity. For instance, during your recent visit to South Africa, you went to Brother Nelson Mandela’s former cell at Robben Island and stared through the iron bars while the cameramen recorded you from behind. You seemed to position yourself in the cell in the same manner that you did when you visited the cell for the first time as a senator. I also find it quite ironic and hypocritical that you could look visibly moved when you were inside Mandela’s former cell, yet you have done nothing to fulfill your campaign promise to close Guantanamo Bay.\n\nYou have shown little interest in Africa. When you were elected as president, the whole continent rejoiced. Even though many Africans knew that you were elected president of the USA and not Africa, they still expected you to be more engaging. However, you remain aloof. It was only when the Chinese began to increase its influence in the continent that you decided to engage with Africa. During your last visit to the continent, you seemed to spend more time lecturing African leaders to embrace gay rights rather than helping them to deliberate on strategies to solve the continents many problems. I am sure these leaders must wonder why you are so brave and confident to tell them to accept gay rights, while you are afraid to tell leaders in the Arab world to do likewise. You may not know it, but you have become a laughing stock in Africa.\n\nAnother concern I have about you is that you try to be all things to all men. As a result, you often come across as indecisive. It is as if you try to gauge what is the popular opinion saying before making any decision. Sometimes as a leader, you have to listen to your own convictions. “On some positions, cowardice asks the question, is it expedient? And then expedience comes along and asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? Conscience asks the question, is it right? There comes a time when one must take the position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular, but he must do it because conscience tells him it is right.”\n\nYou may say, “But Martin Luther King, it is difficult effecting change as a politician compared to effecting change as a civil rights activist,” or “Things are tough here, look at the opposition from the Republicans,” or you may even suggest, “ I can’t make the change that I promised because I am a black man in a White House.” You can’t use these as excuses for inaction. After all President Abraham Lincoln whom you idolize was able to amend the US Constitution with the 13th Amendment in 1865 despite opposition from the Democrats; President Franklin Roosevelt instituted the New Deal between 1933 and 1936 despite opposition from conservative Republicans, Democrats and Wall Street; President Lyndon Johnson was able to pass the Civil Rights Act in 1964 despite opposition from 18 senators from his own party. So you see where there’s a will there’s a way.\n\nBefore I finish my letter, I would like to tell you about an encounter that happened almost two thousand years ago somewhere in Israel. One day an influential man in Israel, I think his name was Nicodemus came to see a certain man late at night. When Nicodemus saw the man, he acknowledged that this man was from God. The man then responded to Nicodemus statement saying, “I tell you the truth, unless you are born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.” I also say to you my son that you must be BORN AGAIN. The Obama of 2013 is not the same Obama of 2007. I strongly urge you to heed to the words of Michael Jackson and take a long look in the mirror and make a change.\n\nEven though I might come across as hard hitting in this letter, believe me, I tried to restrain myself. Brother Malcolm (who is copied in this letter) extends his greetings and says that he would be writing you a letter in the not too distant future.\n\nFinally, when I started this letter I addressed you formally as “Dear President Obama”, however, I would now like to end this letter by addressing you informally as a son who I really really love.\n\nSelah.\n\nYour father\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\ncc Malcolm X\n\n© Ahmed Sule 2013\n\nDear Prime Minister,\n\nNot since when Winston Churchill led the country during the Second World War has a leader occupied No. 10 Downing Street under such tough times. The fact that you are still standing three years after stepping into office is a testament to your mental toughness, wisdom and tact.\n\nOne of the burning issues on your in tray when you assumed office was immigration. At the time you assumed office, you inherited a broken immigration system created by the previous government and set about clearing the mess. I presume that you felt that it was not sustainable for Britain to have lax border control and this is not an unreasonable approach to take. After all, if a country does not control and monitor immigration, the country could face the risk of becoming overpopulated, thereby putting pressure on the finite resources available for the citizens of the country. So as you rightly pointed out in a speech, “Immigration has to be properly controlled. Without proper controls, community confidence is sapped, resources are stretched and the benefits that immigration can bring are lost or forgotten.” In order to control immigration, your government set a target of reducing net immigration from 252,000 a year in 2010 to below 100,000 a year by 2015. After this target was set, the government has put in place a number of structures and policies towards achieving its immigration target.\n\nUnfortunately, in trying to achieve this target, the government has adopted the principle of “the end justifies the means”, without giving serious consideration to the linkage between the ends and the means. Your government’s approach to immigration can be summarised as follows: “As long as we achieve our ‘end’ to significantly reduce net immigration into the country, it doesn’t matter what type of ‘means’ we use. We hope to achieve our ‘end’ BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that as long as the means to achieve the ends is bad, the end no matter how good intended will be bad. As Martin Luther King eloquently put it many years ago, “Ends are not cut off from means, because the means represent the ideal in the making, and the end in process, and ultimately you can’t reach good ends through evil means.” Sir, while your advisers, ministers and the media may tell you that the current immigration reform is fair, just and humane, I have come to tell you like the little boy in Hans Andersen’s fairy tale – The Emperor’s New Clothes, that your government’s immigration reform is unfair, unjust and inhumane. In short, the government’s immigration reform is nothing more than a De Facto Jim Crow Immigration Reform. Before I explain why I have likened your immigration policies to Jim Crow, let me recap on some of the ‘immoral means’ the government has implemented or is proposing to implement to achieve its ‘moral end’ of reducing net immigration.\n\nEver since the government set its target to reduce net immigration, it has come up with a number of ill-advised, ill-intentioned and ill-conceived rhetoric, policies and actions. A number of people in your government have been making inflammatory statements, which only succeed in polarising rather than uniting the country. In many other speeches a number of government officials have tried to link immigrants with benefit fraud, crime and laziness.\n\nYour government is also intent on turning private landlords into agents of the UK Border Agency (UKBA) by making sure that “private landlords check their tenants’ immigration status with consequences for those rogue landlords who fail to do so.” Furthermore, raids are currently being carried out in a number of ethnic diverse areas like Daltson, Stratford and Walthamstow where people of colour are detained based on what the government describes as “specific intelligence.” People of colour or people with non-British accents are being arrested on the buses, trains and on the streets until they can prove their legitimacy to live in Britain. The Home Office has been putting pictures of the arrested immigrants on Twitter. In short the country is gradually metamorphosing from Great Britain to Gestapo Britain.\n\nA couple of days ago, the government implemented an anti-immigration scheme by having a number of vans with the inscription “GO HOME OR FACE ARREST” boldly displayed, plying the six ethnic diverse boroughs of Barnet, Hounslow, Barking and Dagenham, Ealing, Brent and Redbridge. This scheme was widely condemned even by people in the government like Vince Cable who described the government’s approach as “stupid and offensive.” Leaflets and posters telling immigrants to go home have been distributed in a number of boroughs that have a large concentration of non-white people. The government has stated that effective from November 2013, visitors from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana will have to pay a £3,000 refundable bond before they can get a visa to visit Britain. According to the government, these countries, which are populated with black and brown people, were selected because they have a high proportion of visa over-stayers in Britain.\n\nIn August 2012, the UKBA revoked London Metropolitan University’s Highly Trusted Status for sponsoring international students. As a consequence, the university, which has a high concentration of non-whites, lost the right to recruit international students from outside of the EU. Almost 2,700 students were affected as they had 60 days after the revocation to gain admission into another school otherwise they faced deportation. According to the UKBA, one of the reasons why the status was revoked was because “a significant proportion did not have a good standard of English.” There was a lot of public uproar over the decision and in April 2013, the university was given back its licence for a probationary period.\n\nOne may say, “Why compare the government’s immigration reform with Jim Crowism when all the government is doing is to control net immigration?” Others may argue, “There is no basis of comparison to Jim Crow as the government’s policy is fair and not racist.” If one looks at each of the government’s approach to immigration in isolation, one may arrive at that conclusion, however when one looks at the government’s actions holistically, one begins to see a pattern, which bears the hallmark of Jim Crowism.\n\nLike Jim Crow, which segregated blacks from whites, the government’s immigration reform also segregates classes of immigrants. Through the government’s reform, it has created two classes of immigrants namely black immigrants and white immigrants; rich immigrants and poor immigrants; upper class immigrants and lower class immigrants; white Western immigrants and white non-Western immigrants. Unlike the white rich and Western immigrants who are treated like human beings, the black, brown and white non-Western immigrants are dehumanised, demonised and ostracised by the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reforms\n\nBritain plays host to immigrants from the four corners of the world and particularly from her ex-colonies. However, one wonders why the immigration reforms are negatively impacting black, brown and Eastern European immigrants. For instance the introduction of the £3,000 refundable cash bond impacts visitors from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ghana, which are countries populated with black and brown people. According to the Visit Britain website, the number of visitors to Britain in 2012 from three of these “BLACKlisted” countries were as follows\n\nWhile visitors from some white majority populated countries were as follows\n\nThe above statistics are quite revealing. Visitors from countries that have fewer visitors to Britain are made to post cash bonds while the visitors from countries that have higher number of visitors are free to come to Britain without posting cash bonds – a case of different strokes for different folks. Just like the Jim Crow mantra was “Separate but equal”; the mantra of the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reform seems to be “ALL IMMIGRANTS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME IMMIGRANTS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.”\n\nSelah.\n\nThe stop and search raids currently taking place in areas that have large concentrations of non-whites or white non-Westerners bears the hallmark of an amalgamation of Jim Crowism and the Pass Laws implemented in South Africa. During the Apartheid regime, the Pass Law Act was passed to restrict the movements of non-white people in certain parts of South Africa. Non-whites were required to carry passbooks with them in certain areas and could be arrested if they failed to produce the passbook. While there are no laws requiring non-whites to carry passbooks in Britain, what we now have in place is a de facto pass law. The recent raids in black populated parts of Britain has created an atmosphere of fear in the black community and the people feel that they have to carry their passports with them wherever they go so as to avoid being arrested for failing to prove their legitimacy to stay in the country. Already, blacks and Asians are disproportionately stopped and searched by the police relative to their white counterparts and this de facto pass law will only increase the frequency of the searching of blacks and Asians. It would be interesting to find out why raids are carried out in the areas of large concentrations of non-white such as Daltson, Peckham and Stratford while areas with little concentrations of black people go unraided.\n\nLike Jim Crow laws, which succeeded in driving blacks out of the southern states of the USA, the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reform seems to be intended to drive the black, brown and white non-Western immigrants out of Britain back to their home countries as evidenced by the message displayed on the so-called racist van i.e. “GO HOME OR FACE ARREST.” Just as Jim Crow laws prevented blacks from going to certain places such as restaurants, hotels, toilets, playgrounds and schools, the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration policies are preventing some black immigrants from entering buses and train stations for fear of being detained. Even the schools are impacted by the de facto Jim Crow immigration reform as evidenced by the revocation of the Highly Trusted Status of London Metropolitan University, a school populated by majority non-whites and non-westerners, partly because some of its students did not “have a good standard of English”.\n\nWhile Jim Crow laws discriminated against an unpopular minority in the USA, the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reforms discriminates against an unpopular minority in Britain i.e. the black, brown and white non-Western immigrants. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see that there is a hierarchy of immigrants in this country. At the top of the pyramid are the Western immigrants from countries like Germany, France, Australia, USA and Canada while at the bottom of the pyramid, are the immigrants from countries ranging from Nigeria, India, Pakistan to Romania, Bulgaria and Poland.\n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, Americans were accustomed to seeing signposts with inscriptions such as “Colored Waiting Room”, “Public Swimming Pool – White Only”, and “Imperial Laundry Co – We Wash For White People Only”. In 21st century Britain, the black, brown and white non-Western immigrants now see more subtle signs such as “GO HOME OR FACE ARREST”, “Text HOME to 78070”, “106 ARRESTS LAST WEEK IN YOUR AREA.” I am sure that a number of older Afro-Caribbean’s will look at these signboards with nostalgia remembering the signs that first greeted them when they landed from the MV Empire Windrush ship – “NO IRISH, NO BLACKS, NO DOGS.”\n\nSelah.\n\nWhile to suggest that these recent immigration reforms are in response to UK Independent Party (UKIP) eating into your parties electoral base is speculative and unverifiable, however what is known is that the government is fixing this broken immigration system without consideration given to the humanity of the immigrants who are targeted. Jesus once said, “For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul.” I can imagine the Master sitting on his majestic throne telling the British government, “For what shall it profit a government to gain some votes and lose its soul over a pottage of de facto Jim Crowism”. Prime Minister, I am concerned that three years into your reign, your government has lost its soul. In the quest for winning the hearts and mind of voters, it has embarked on a campaign of oppression, repression and suppression against the marginalised segments of society. Even though the disabled, the immigrants, the homeless, the unemployed, the aged and the youth did not cause the recent financial crisis, they have been negatively targeted by many of the government’s policies while the major culprits of the crisis are walking free on the streets of Britain smiling all the way to the bank. As each month goes by, the government’s immigration policies become harsher on the vulnerable segment of society.\n\nThe government’s immigration reforms are becoming so harsh that even the UKIP is saying, “Spot checks and being demanded to show your papers by officialdom are not the British way of doing things.” Even though the YouGov poll states that 61% of the public don’t think that the ‘Go home, or face arrest’ vans for illegal immigrants are racist, a responsible government should not make decisions that impacts lives based on YouGov polls or the number of positive comments in some tabloids or the number of “likes” on Facebook. Martin Luther King got it right when he said, “Ultimately, a genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.”\n\nThe government’s de facto Jim Crow reforms have a number of implications, some of which are already happening and others which may happen in the future if it continues at this pace. The reforms are fueling the racial tension in the country thereby resulting in a rise in racial intolerance. The inflammatory rhetoric coming from a number of government officials often sends a wrong signal to closet racists and open racists that they have government approval to carry out racial crimes. One should therefore not be surprised at the high incidence of race insults on the football pitch, TV screens and on the trains in recent years.\n\nIn addition, the current immigration reform is polarising the British society. In 2012, the government published its Integration Strategy in which the government hoped that millions of individuals would come together around common values, aspirations and interests. Sir, with these de facto Jim Crow immigration reforms in place, black and brown people no longer feel part of this society. The reforms are also creating room for suspicion and when people of one race are suspicious of people of the other race, how can the society be effectively integrated?\n\nWhen landlords are pressurised to become agents of the UKBA or when citizens are told to report “suspected illegal immigrants to our Border Agency through the Crimestoppers phoneline or through the Border Agency website” this promotes a polarised society. Why? The word “suspected illegal immigrant” is very subjective. Anyone who does not fit the profile of a “true Brit” is likely to fall under the “suspected illegal immigrant” label. So when a lady has an Eastern European accent, she is likely to be tagged a “suspected illegal immigrant”; when a person does not look like a Caucasian, he is likely to be tagged a “suspected illegal immigrant.” Sir, unlike other immigrants in this country, the black and brown immigrants stand out because of their skin colour in a majority white populated country. They cannot hide under the shade of white skin tone that prevails in this country. Thus they become the main target of the adverse effects of the de facto Jim Crow Immigration reforms and so it is no surprise that they are being arrested, searched, by the police, asked to go home in the train, refused employment and accommodation because they look like “suspected illegal immigrant.”\n\nMoreover, the immigration reform risks jeopardising the British economy. It is a known fact that economic power is shifting from the West to the East and South. Most of the fastest growing economies of the world are populated with brown, black and yellow people. If leaders in countries like India, Nigeria and China feel that Britain is hostile to their citizens, they may divert the businesses, investments and trades which could jump start the British economy to other countries that are more open and friendly. Also, many bright students who would have otherwise studied in Britain may choose to study in other countries such as the USA, Canada or Australia thereby depriving Britain of future scientists and entrepreneurs. Furthermore, as these students become the leaders of tomorrow, they will not have any ties with Britain and future investments could flow to other countries instead.\n\nIn addition, Britain needs to realise that she does not have a monopoly of immigrants coming into her country. Remember that there are Brits in different parts of the world. There is a possibility that some of these countries that are impacted by the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reform could retaliate. For instance, what would happen to the British expatriates working in the Nigerian oil sector if the Nigerian government decides to revoke the visa status of British workers in the oil sector or if the Thailand or Ghanaian Governments embark on say an anti immigration scheme whereby they have a billboard with the message “WE’VE HAD ENOUGH PEDOPHILES IN THIS COUNTRY. GO BACK TO BRITAIN OR FACE ARREST”?\n\nSir, the government’s de facto Jim Crow immigration reform bears some semblance to some of the stages identified by Greg Stanton in his 1996 paper titled “The Eight Stages of Genocide”. The first stage that Mr. Stanton of Genocide Watch describes is the classification stage, in which people are divided into the categories of “them” and “us”. This can be seen in the subtle classification of immigrants into black and white immigrants, rich and poor immigrants; western and non-Western immigrants in which the white, rich and western immigrants are classified as “US” while the black, brown, poor and white non-Western immigrants are classified as “THEM.”\n\nThe second stage is the symbolisation stage. This occurs when the people who have been classified as “them” are given names and symbols associated with the classification. Government officials and the media have given illegal immigrants various labels such as “criminals”, “benefit cheats”, “lazy”,” dishonest”, “untidy” and “immoral”. Mr. Stanton describes the third stage as dehumanisation, in which “one group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases”. The emerging pattern of the treatment of illegal immigrants especially the Romanians suggests that this stage is in full force.\n\nThe fourth stage is organisation. The stopping, searching and detaining of suspected illegal immigrants based on “specific intelligence” is evidence that this stage is on going. The polarisation stage, which is the fifth stage, occurs when the propaganda machine is put in force to reinforce prejudice and hate. Very often, laws are implemented to help achieve this aim. This stage is evident in Britain, not only from the utterances of some government officials, but also from the de facto Jim Crow immigration reform.\n\nThe sixth stage is the preparation stage. In this stage, victims are identified and separated. According to Mr. Stanton, the victims are “often segregated into ghettoes, deported into concentration camps or confined to a famine-struck region and starved”. While illegal immigrants in Britain have not been sent to concentration camps or famine-struck regions, they are being identified and segregated in addition to being harassed by UK Border Agency officials and the police based on their colour, accent or because of a tip off based on “specific intelligence.” While I believe that your government is not intent on committing genocide on illegal immigrants, I believe it is important for you to reflect on these stages, as the ill-treatment of immigrants in Britain appears to be increasing exponentially, starting first with inflammatory rhetoric, proceeding to harsh laws and progressing to deportation and incarceration. Hopefully it will not reach the extermination or incineration stage.\n\nSelah.\n\nAs a result of your government’s approach to immigration, the rest of the world is beginning to see Britain as a patient suffering from Schizophrenia. With one side of her mouth, Britain tells the world that she is open to foreign investment, foreign businessmen and foreign students and with the other side of her mouth she tells the world that Britain does not welcome foreigners. One cannot tell the Indians to open up to British businesses in February 2013 and then tell the Indians in Britain to GO HOME OR FACE ARREST in July 2013. It is time that you call your advisers and ministers to order and come up with a well thought, reasonable and humane immigration policy rather than implementing policies that court controversy, polarise society and dehumanise people.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to clarify what I am saying and what I am not saying regarding the government’s immigration reforms. I am not saying that Britain does not have a broken immigration problem; I am not saying that anyone who attempts to fix Britain’s broken immigration is a racist; I am not saying that some immigrants are not milking the system and taking advantage of Britain’s broken immigration system.\n\nWhat I am saying is that segregating immigrants on the basis of race, accent or financial status is immoral and a crime against humanity; What I am saying is that not ALL immigrants are milking the system; What I am saying is that the government’s current approach to fixing Britain’s broken immigration system is polarising the society, which leads to no good.\n\nSelah.\n\nAhmed Olayinka Sule, CFA\n\nsuleaos@gmail.com\n\nhttp://www.scribd.com/Alatenumo/documents\n\nhttp://about.me/ahmedsule\n\ncc\n\nRt.

I couldn’t believe it. I had to do a double take. I think I hit a double-fault on that point.” After sitting down, she put the towel on her laps and spoke on, “He was harassing me throughout the match, and I should have said something sooner. He was saying things he shouldn’t have and it was totally unethical. It was derogatory.”\n\nIs this story fact or fiction? Who said the above and to whom and on what occasion? This incident actually took place in March 2007 during a match between Serena Williams and Lucie Safarova at the Sony Ericsson Miami Open. The middle-aged man watching the match had just yelled at Serena saying, “Hit the ball into the net like any nigger would.” In response, Serena approached the umpire to complain and to have him ejected from the match. Six years after this event, the racial slurs directed at Serena still continue although they have become more polished and less obvious.\n\nWilliams is one of the finest players of any gender to have graced the game of tennis. She has won 16 Grand Slam singles titles (and counting), 13 Grand Slam doubles titles and 4 Olympic gold medals. She is the only human being to complete a career Golden Grand Slam in both singles and doubles. In addition, Williams is one of only two people to have ever won Grand Slam singles titles in three different decades and to have won each of the Grand Slam singles and doubles titles at least twice. Despite these achievements, Williams is quite possibly the most unloved, underestimated and underappreciated tennis player of all time.\n\nTennis, like most other sports, has had its fair share of “goodies and baddies”; the heroes and the villains. While it’s obvious that Williams falls into the baddie/villain category, unlike the angst directed at other “villains of the game” such as John McEnroe, the angst directed at Williams is not only troubling, "
