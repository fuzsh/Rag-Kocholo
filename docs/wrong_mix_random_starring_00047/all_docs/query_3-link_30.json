        "text": "The cultural wealth of our people represents a very important potential for the development of both the service sector and the entire Serbian economy through the presentation of the original cultural heritage and products derived from it. However, how can we use this huge intellectual capital that we all have and turn it into a value that will provide jobs, a better standard of living and economic growth and development of Serbia? The aim of this paper is to answer this question and it refers not only to the economic justification of projects from our cultural heritage, but also to the preservation and protection of cultural wealth, as well as sustainable cultural development. After the general introduction to the concept and classification of cultural heritage as well as the most important characteristics of cultural heritage in Serbia, the definition of the intellectual capital of cultural heritage follows and the presentation of the model of intellectual capital of cultural heritage by Bratian and Be≈æenar. After that, through the intellectual capital of service activities and its definition and structure, the key creators of the value of intellectual capital in Serbian service companies are presented. The problem of the negative impact of globalization on the preservation and protection of cultural heritage is also addressed, as well as the possibility of preserving and presenting cultural heritage thanks to digitalization. Finally, we herewith present the treatment of one of the most important issues of cultural heritage, and that is the issue of intellectual property, as well as the issue of geographical indications of products, which is perhaps the most important development potential of Serbian companies when it comes to cultural heritage."
