He is resting comfortably at home, and a full recovery is expected, team physician Dr. Michael Terry said in a statement. It is not clear when the 52-year-old coach will return to the bench for the Stanley Cup champions, whose next game is today against Pittsburgh.

In a trade between struggling teams in the Western Conference, the Colorado Avalanche acquired former No. 1 pick Erik Johnson and Jay McClement from the St. Louis Blues for Chris Stewart and Kevin Shattenkirk.

The Avalanche, who have lost 10 consecutive games, also receive a first-round pick in 2011 or 2012. Colorado surrenders a conditional second-round selection in 2011 or 2012.

Johnson was the top overall pick in 2006. A rugged defenseman, he has five goals and 14 assists in 55 games this season. Johnson also helped the U.S. to a silver medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games.
