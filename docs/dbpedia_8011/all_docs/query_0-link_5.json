        "text": "Hermann Niehoff was a German officer during World War II. He was born on 3 April 1897 and died in 1980. Niehoff was born in Papenburg/Ems. He was a German infantry general and was the garrison commander of Fortress Breslau (Festung Breslau) during the Battle of Breslau.\n\nCommands[]\n\nCommanding Officer of the 211th Replacement Regiment - 1939 to 1940\n\nCommanding Officer of the 464th Regiment - 1940 to 1943\n\nInfantry General (General der Infanterie) of the 371st Infantry Division - 1943 to 1945\n\nGarrison Commander of Fortress Breslau - 2 March to 6 May 1945\n\nActions[]\n\nAs General of the 371 Infantry Division (371.Infanterie Division), Niehoff participated in the break out from the Kamieniec-Podolski Pocket during March and April 1944. At this time, his division was part of Colonel General (Generaloberst) Hans-Valentin Hube's 1st Panzer Army. From 13 February to 6 May 1945, Breslau was besieged by the Soviet 6th Army. The 6th Army was part of the Soviet 1st Ukrainian Front commanded by Marshal Ivan Konev. On 2 March, Niehoff became the garrison commander. To oppose the Soviets, Niehoff had a mix of German Army, Home Guard, and Hitler Youth troops. During the siege, Niehoff's over-matched forces held Breslau for more than two months while much of the city was destroyed and many of his troops were killed.\n\nOn 6 May, four days after Berlin fell and only two days before the unconditional surrender of Germany, Niehoff signed a conditional surrender of Fortress Breslau to the Soviets. None of the conditions were kept by the Soviets. Niehoff remained a prisoner of war from 1945 to 1955.\n\nAwards[]\n\nWound Badge in Black\n\nInfantry Assault Badge\n\nGerman Cross in Gold (6 January 1942)\n\nHamburg Hanseatic Cross (World War I)\n\nIron Cross\n\n1st class on 12 June 1918\n\n2nd class on 5 August 1916\n\nClasps to the Iron Cross\n\n1st class 7 July 1941\n\n2nd class 26 June 1940\n\nKnight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords\n\nKnight's Cross on 15 June 1944 as Generalleutnant and commander of the 371.
