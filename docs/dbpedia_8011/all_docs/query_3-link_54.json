        "text": "SMU celebrated the centennial of its opening as well as the successful completion of the largest campaign in University history in 2015–16, during a year that will be remembered for as long as SMU exists. As the campus community joined together to mark SMU's first 100 years of achievement, donors to The Second Century Campaign propelled SMU into the ranks of the nation's most prestigious institutions of higher education through their generous and, ultimately, record-setting support. The spirit of progress that has marked SMU in recent years continued to permeate life on the Hilltop, as the University took new strides to enhance and strengthen its student quality, faculty and academic excellence and the campus experience. And, as students and faculty attained ever-increasing levels of accomplishment, the University began to look forward to the next chapter of its life as a global resource dedicated to education and the creation of new knowledge."
