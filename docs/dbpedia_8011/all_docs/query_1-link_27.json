        "text": "The ArgumentThe Republic of Letters of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries teaches us two lessons about style in science. First, the bearer of style—individual, nation, institution, religious group, region, class—depends crucially on historical context. When the organization and values of intellectual life are self-consciously cosmopolitan, and when allegiances to other entities (e.g., Protestant versus Catholic, or urban versus rural) are culturally more compelling than those to the nation-state, distinctivelynationalstyles are far to seek. This was largely the case for the Republic of Letters, that immaterial (it lacked location, formal administration, and brick and mortar) but nonetheless real (it exercised dominion over thoughts and deeds) realm among the sovereign states of the Enlightenment. Second, that form of objectivity which made science seem so curiously detached from scientists, and therefore so apparently unmarked by style at any level, also has a history. Th...\n\nRecent scholarship has advanced paradoxical conclusions about the relationship between Renaissance humanism and the Reformation. While humanist techniques are considered to have played an instrumental role in the development, spread, and implementation of the Reformation, the humanist community is generally regarded as a supra-confessional “Republic of Letters.” This article addresses this paradox by looking at the religious language in Latin emblem books. These highly popular works emphasized a personal, intellectual spirituality, and expressed reservations against institutionalised religion. They have often been interpreted ideologically, as a humanistic, irenical response to the religious turmoil. When read in the context of the authors’ and readers’ practical interests, however, they reveal a more pragmatic strategy. Rather than promoting religious ideals, they used an a-confessional language to accommodate religious pluriformity. Examples of the reception by individual readers, e.g., in alba amicorum, further exemplify how confessional silence served as a communicative strategy in the Republic of Letters.\n\nPresentation at the Forschungszentrum Gotha, 15 Dec 2016. What happened to the Republic of Letters? Its history seems to stop at the end of the 18th century. And yet, in the 19th century, there was still a learned community gathering in scholarly societies, maintaining a transnational correspondence network, and filling learned journals. The term indeed becomes less frequent, but does not entirely go out of use. This presentation traces the afterlives of the Republic of Letters in the early 19th century. Specifically, I do so by looking at texts that attempt to (re)define the Republic of Letters or a cognate, at the wider diffusion of the term, and at the changing role of learned journals in that period. It transpires that most attempts to reinvent the Republic of Letters failed miserably, and that much of the further usage of the term is either a petrified cliché or negatively flavoured. But a specialist scientific community was hardly there before the 1870s. That leaves us with a undefined period."
