Mrs. James Brown Potter was to have recited today at Dunmow, in Essex, at the residence of Lady Brook, before the Princess Alary, the Duke of Teck, and other notables, but the death of the King of Wurtemberg having plunged the court into mourning the engagement was canceled .\n\nThus it happened that Mrs. Potter ia once more in the blues; for things are not quite as rosy as they might be. Mrs. Potter feels that 6he has been ill -U3ed, and attributes the few pitfalls into which she has fallen to her former society friends and to the evil influence of one in particular, a world-renowned American journalist now living in London who first made violent love to her without success and then for very rage turned upon her and has hounded her ever since. Mrs .\n\nPotter promises the world some interesting gossip, and if she only remains in her present mood she will launch a bomb into New York society that will revenge her for all the slights she has endured. A beautiful wreath, to be placed on Par-Hell's grave, wa9 received in Dublin this morning, having been brought by old Zie-minski, the Polish delegate who was sent over by certain of his fellow-countrymen to represent them at the funeral. He requested the press to express his great regret that he had ocen unable to reach Ireland in time for the ceremony. When the news of Parnell's death was published in Warsaw a number of the representatives of the Polish Nationalists met and deputed Zieminski to proceed to Ireland and convey to the Irish people the deep sympathy of the Nationalists of Poland and also to lay a floral tribute and the colors of Poland on the grave of the Irish leader. Owing, however, to the objection of the Russian Government to allow Irish news to appear in the Polish journals the exact date of Parnell's funeral was not known in Warsaw before the departure of ZiemenskL The wreath of laurel bears the colors of Poland in two great bands of beautiful watered silk of Polish manufacture .\n\nIt was with great difficulty, the delegate said, that he was able to get the silk streamers, with their inscriptions, beyond the frontier. P. Keary oodford died in Dublin today. In the movement of the Clanricarde tenantry he and ohn Roche, M. were the leaders, and it was outside his house that the famous midnight meeting was held while from his windows Mr .\n\nO'Brien addressed the people. His death has caused profound sorrow in all Irish circles. Among the Americans registered at Messrs. Brown, Shipley fe during the week were: Judge Charles L. Easton .\n\nL. J. Bowes, Chicago.

Schnffner .\n\nLittle Unita, the 4-year-old ward of L. Schaffner, No. 656 Fullerton avenue, was kidnaped yesterday afternoon by a woman named Mrs. Emerson, who is Assistant Superintendent at the Erring Woman's Refuge, No. 5024 Indiana avenue .\n\nBy a private police call the Sheffield Avenue police were notified, and through quick work of the officers the child was found at 9 o'clock last night at the refuge on Indiana avenue, where it had been taken by Mrs. Emerson. The latter was arrested on a warrant sworn out by Mr. Schaffner and charged with kidnaping the child. When arrested Mra .\n\nEmerson protested that the child belonged to her, not by ties of blood but because of her affection for it, and that that was the only reason why she had taken it. She said she would do the same thing again if not given possession ot the child. The parentage of the little one is unknown. Three years ago she was left at the dxy nursery maintained by Unity Church, No. 80 Elm street, Mrs .\n\nSchaffner is President of tho Board of Management of the nursery and took the child home with her. All efforts to find its parents failed, and after caring for it some weeks Mrs. Schaffner gave it to Mrs. Emerson, a fr-end who was living at that time on Paulina street near Madison. Mrs .\n\nEmerson retained possession of the child for about two years. Then curne trouble with her husband. She was soon without a suitable home in which to bring up the child, and one day six weeks ago Mrs. Schaffner on making a few inquiries among her friends found the child again at a day nursery on the South Side. Mr .\n\nSchaffner applied to the Probate Court and was appointed guardian of the child. Mrs. Emerson was informed of the fact, ana Unita went to live at the Schaffner mansion on Fullerton avenue, where she was happy and contented. Mr. and Mrs .\n\nSchaffner were both away yesterday and Mr. Schaffner's two daughters were alone in the house. Mrs. Emerson expressed a wish to take Unita with her to visit a friend on Frederick street. The permission was refused by Miss Schaffner .\n\nTowards 4 :30 Mrs, Emerson appeared- to become uneasy, \"and arose to go. \"Kiss mamma good-by,\" she said to the child, and stooped down as if to kiss her. Instead of doing that she threw both arms around the little one, picked her up, dashed through the ooen front door, and motioned to a cabman who was stationed down the street. He drove rapidly up, dismounted, roughly thrust aside Miss Schaffner, who was endeavoring to regain possession of the child, assisted Mrs. Emerson into the cab, and then started at full speed down Larrabee street and Lincoln avenue for the center of the city .\n\nAt Lake and State streets Mrs. Emerson dismissed the cab, 'and, taking a State street car, was soon at the Erring Woman's Refuge, where she was arrested. When brought into the Sheffield Avenue Station and confronted with Mr. and Mrs. Schaffner Mrs .\n\nEmerson was inclined to make a scene. She quieted down, however, when reminded that she was under arrest on a grave charge. Justice Mahoney fixed the bail in who case at $1,000, and the bond being signed by Frank Pearson Mrs. Emerson wa3 given her liberty. The case will come before Justice Mahoney at 9 o'clock Monday morning .\n\nMr. Schaffner says he will not prosecute unless Mrs. Emerson makes a fight. HIS NERVES WERE SHATTERED. Ions in 1890 How the Funds of the Farty Are Secured .\n\nsprrTAi, Paris. Oct. 17. We hare had in Europe this week diplomatic meetings and openings of Parliaments. These are events which cause much discussion but which are of email importance .\n\nThe diplomats are at the njerey of the caprice of chance. The Deputies are the servants of their electors. But there is another event really important, from which may result a political and cial revolution. It is the meeting at Erfurt of the congress of German Socialists that is to say, of people in Germany who have the courage to say thas war is a misfortune and that the difference between Germany and France namely: the Alsace-Lorraine question should be settled otherwise than by resort to arms. Seeing that the progress of the Socialists ia constant tmy must be followed very closely yet again this week they won in the elections to the Saxon Landtag .\n\nLast week they gained seats in an unexpected fashion in the Bavarian elections. It must be rotieed how nuuterous they are, what they have obtained. and what they want. The number of Socialists who voted at the elections in 1871 was 101,927. That was email, and since that time the following has been the increase: In 187-1 .\n\n321,670: in 1673, in 1878, in litol, 311,961. At this eriod Prince Bismarck caused the anti-socialist laws to be passed. In lSSlthte Socialist vote was 549.990 in 1S87, 703,128, and finally in 1800, 1,311,587. From One to Thirty-six. Never in Europe lias a party progressed in euch manner .\n\nIn 1871 there was but one Socialist Deputy, Herr Bebel in 1800 there are thirty-six. In 1871 Berlin alone had Socialist electors; in l8i)J they are everywhere at Hamburg, Munich, Mannheim, Leipzig, also in the rural districts. The propaganda is conducted by agents chosen by the central comuiittee composed of twelve delegates. They pass from town to town holding forth that the anti-Socialist laws are abrogated, making speeches and distributing their newspapers; for the party has forty-rune political journals, nineteen daily ones with ourweekly and 6 biweekly publications. The party has also a review and an illustrated and satirical newspaper .\n\nIn each workshop there is a member who receives one of the party newspapers, and whose mission it is to read these newspapers to his companions. Moreover, there are prop-rjranda pamphlets, of which 200,000 are distributed free each year. The funds are supplied by a weekly call of ten pfennigs from each member besides the voluntary donations. We have seen, for example, M. Singer, a rich dry good merchant of Berlin, giving 100.000 marks at one time, lie is now a parliamentary deputy .\n\nThe party has an income of marks per annum, which is spent in the expenses of the propaganda. All the positions from that of the chief to that of the propagator are hon-criry. There is a special electoral fund to which the extraordinary receipts are added. For condemned companions whose families always live at the exiense of the party special collections are made. The first article of the program is as follows: The political and economical expropriation of toe capitalist class and tho social appropriation of icsans of production .\n\nThe German Socialists wibb firstly aa economic revolution. Prince liis-cmrck has said that the Socialists ate the only dinger threatening the Empire. M. Be bei has said Vet another twenty years of peace and we shall be the masters of Germany.\" William II. Las said: \"The interest of the monarchy compels us to do justice to the demands of the working classes.\" These three phrases show the danger which the son of William 11 .\n\nwill hwve to tight agaiust bloody difficulties. Jacques Saint-Cere. THEY PROFIT BY THE rOPE, Some Are Like Owls. Others Eat Flesh, and Tet Other Kinds Have Absurd Habits. \"Parrots are funny birds,\" said Ornithologist Robert Ridgeway of the Smithsonian Institution to a Washington Star writer the other day .\n\nThere is one species of nocturnal habits in New Zealand called the owl which lives in holes among the roots of trees and feeds upon the succulent roots of big ferns. It looks rather like an owl, but, although it has wings of fair size, it cannot fly at all, because it has no muscles with which to work its pinions. This is the only known bird outside of the ostrich family that has no keel on its breastbone. It can pitch itself off from a height, spreading its wings to ease its descent, but those appendages are merely employed on the parachute principle. Australia and the neighboring islands are more thickly occupied by parrots than any other part of the world, but the species found in that region are peculiar to it and many of them are very curious .\n\nIt is only there that the wonderful cockatoo family exists. To this genus belongs the biggest of all parrots, known as the Goliath which is as large as a goose, jet black all over, even to its crest, with a beak much more powerful than that of any eagle. With this instrument it is said to be able to crack the hardest of the tropical nuts, on the kernels of which it feeds. In New Guinea is found a pigmy parrot not so large as an English sparrow, which is known as the 4 bat because it roosts at night head downward, holding on to the perch by its claws. \"Another kind of Australian parrot a feathered tongue for the purpose of feeding upon the honey of flowers .\n\nSomewhat has already been published concern mg the extraordinary 6heep-eating parrots of New Zealand. They alight upon the backs of sheep at pasture, and fastening themselves to the wool with their claws, tear away with their strong hooked beaks at the backs of the helpless animals. The latter run frantically about in their agony, finally succumbing to their feathered foes, which eagerly gobble the kidneys and. the fat surrounding those organs, leaving the carcasses of the slain scattered about the fields. It was a long time before the sheep farmers discovered what enemy was destroying their flocks in this fashion .\n\nTheir theory is that a winter ot famine among the par-rota rendered the birds hungry. They had always up to that time been vegetable feeders, but one day a number of them alighted near some butchered carcasses of sheep that had been hung up and it occurred to them to try their flavor. Having thus acquired the taste they adopted the carnivorous habit. For tearing and eatmg flesh their beaks are as well adapted as those of owls and hawks. \"Australia has by far the most beautiful parrots in the world, as well as the greatest variety .\n\nSome of them are adorned with all the most brilliant colors of the rainbow. In the Argentine Republic and Paraguay there is a species which makes a communal nest. Combining their efforts they fetch together a great quantity of material, such as sticks and leaves, forming it into a t-ort of platform ten or twelve feet across. This platform serves the purpose of a roof, and beneath it holes are constructed for every pair. These holes are so made, with entrances at first horizontal and then vertical, that a complete house is Erovided for each parrot family, the roof over-ead keeping off the rain .\n\nFifty years ago parrots were plentiful all over the eastern half of the United States. They were of one species, which is now known as the North Carolina paroquet. The genus to which they belong includes fifty known species, of which this is by far the most beautiful. So short a time as half a century ago it was plentiful as far north as the Great Lakes. It was abundant in the Ohio Valley, in the Mississippi Valley, in the Valley of the Missouri, and through Nebraska, Dakota, and the W7est as far as Colorado and south to Texas .\n\nThese parrots have been so systematically exterminated that at present they are found only here and there in Florida, along the gulf coast, and in the Indian Territory. Several reasons are accountable for tneir extermination. One of them is found in their unwillingness to desert a wounded companion. If one paroquet in a flock is wounded the hunter cm kill them all, because they will not leave an injured comrade. Another cause for their disappearance is found in the fact that they used to be a great pest to the farmers, eatmg the corn while in the milk and devouring the young fruits for the sake of the seeds .\n\nAlso, the birds were themselves good to eat. One way of capturing them wholesale was to cut down a hol-ow tree in which they had roosted for the night, their habit being to go in through a hole, as swallows fill a chimney, and hang by rheir bills 6tuck in crevices. Paroquets are true parrots, notwithsanding their dimiuutive 6ize. Those found in America are all small macaws. As for the macaws in general they belong only in the new world .\n\nAnother reason why the North Carolina paroquet has been destroyed is that its feathers are particularly useful for the making of feather flower work, their tints being exactly such as are required 'or the purpose. \"Speaking of macaws reminds me of the only apparently reasonable dialogue that I have ever heard between parrots. It was in the Smithsonian zoo. A blue and yellow one occupied the same place with another that was dressed in red and green. The two fell to fighting in my presence and one knocked the other off the roost .\n\n'Good-bye, Polly I said the vanquished, starting to walk away. The victor shouted from the perch, 'Come back Con.e back 1' But the defeated one looked upj cocked his eye, and replied hoarsely, 'Rats 1' Macaws often talk well, but their voices are disagreeably hoarse and inhuman. Parrots are considered the talking birds par excellence, but there are other feathered creatures which are much more accomplished linguists than they. Ravens, crows, and magpies are all better speakers than parrots. They are not so versatile, it is true, and the sounds they are able to produce are not so varied but their voices and articulation are far more human .\n\nA crow's talk in the next room may readily be mistaken for that of a INDIAN WAB REVIEWED. ANNUAL REPORT O' SOX A. MILES MADE PCBLIcC Disaffection of the Siox: at Standing Rock Attributed to the Failure of the Government to Deal Equitably with the Abor. isrlnes The Fires of Discord Alleged to Be Still Alight-Proposition to Mobilize the National Gnard at the World's Columbian Exposition. Washlxgton, D .\n\nOct. 17. The annual report of Nelson A. Miles, com manding the Department of the Missouri, is mainly a historical review of the Sioux war of last winter, its causes, episodes and its results. Viewed from this distance of time the General finds a good deal to say in a general way and his report is an interesting record of events .\n\nAmong the causes that resulted in the Sioux outbreak he mentions the gradually increasing poverty of the Cheyennes and the Sioux, the insufficiency of the rations issued by the government, the failure of the crops in 1889 and 1890, and the inability of the Indians to immigrate to other parts of the country. He quotes at some length from reports made by Gen. Ruger then commanding the Department of to show that the disaffection of the Indians at Standing Rock was to be attributed to the following failures of the government: To establish an equitable southern boundarv for the reservation. 2. To expend a just proportion of the mnnev m-ceived frjm the Chicago .\n\nMilwaukee St. Paul Railr.ad rompmy for right of way privileges lor the benefit of the Indians of that sgency. 3. To issue certificates of title to allotments a. required by the treaty of lSdS .\n\n4. To provide the full allowance vf seeds and agricultural implement to Indians engaged in farming, as required by the same treaty. 5. To issue the full number of cows and oxan under the same treaty. a 6 .\n\nTo provide comfortable dwellings for tHn Indians, treaty of 1874. las 7. To issue the full ration stipulated In thu treaty of 1876. wa 8. To issue the full amount of annuity supplies, treaty of To have the clothing and other annuity sun-plies ready for issue Aug .\n\n1 of each year, sarne Tit 3ty 10. To appropriate money for the payment of ponies taken from the Indians, by authority of the government in 1870. Insufficient Rations. Of the Indians at Pine Ridge much of the same kind was said by Gen. Brooke, Very nearly a similar showing is made in the report in regard to the causes of dissatisfaction among the Indians at the Rosebud and Cheyenne River agencies and atnon the Yanktonnias, the general tenor of their complaints being that the government had failed to provide sufficient rations .\n\nGen. Miles commends the administration of Capt Penny as acting Indian agent at Pine Ridga and says that through -additional appropriations the Indians receive nearly one-half as much more than they aid a year ago. In concluding his remarks on the campaign heays: Notwithstanding the fact that the volcano has cooled down the tires of discord still remain. Even while the hostages were at Fort Sheridan they received communications from their friends in the Sioux cemps stating that they had not given up the conspiracy of one graud uprising of the Indians, and that the Utes were ready to join the Sioux whenever they were ready to resume hostilities. Communications have been discovered going on between the different camps, inciting the Indians to hostiliry and even now there is a delegation from the la-dian Territory, absent ostensibly to visit relatives, at the Arrapahoe and Shoshone Reservation ia Wyoming .\n\nThey have in fact gone across the mountains, and are now in tne abodes of the supporters of the Messiah delusion, near Pyra? nnd Lake, in Nevada. During the mouths following the eerious disturbance of the peare 'lie confidence of all has been restored. Many of the settlers have gone back to their abandoned' houses and ranches, and the Indians have resumed their accustomed occupations. The affairs are gradually adjusting themselves, after being in a state of transition for a long time. The days of larea holdings of lands by the Indians in common will eventually cease and the Indians take up lands in severalty .\n\nTo mobilize the National Gnnrd. Of the World's Columbian Exposition Gen. Miles says As we approach nearer the time of the World's Columbiam Exposition, the most important affair of the kind that has ever been held in the world, it would seem advisable to take advantage of the occasion to mobilize or assemble what is known as the National Guard, or State militia. The Constitution has very judiciously and wisely reserved the control of these forces to the various State Governmpnts.but as a means to promote the efficiency of the various orinizarions it would be well to assemble them under Congressional enactment, with the approval and authority of the various State Governments, in one national encampment at least once in a generation. As there has been no gathering of that magnitude since the armies were dispersed in 1S65 .\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the militia be brought together at this peace jubilee. Most of the members of the national guard who engaged in the great industries of the country will desire to be present at the Exposition at some time during the session, and many of them would prefer to come with their organization ia order to combine with the encampment benefits of the Exposition. It would also be beneficial to the State organizations to be brought together in one national encampment where they would have the advantage of meeting troops from other States, lor instance, those of New England would be placed alongside of those from the gulf, and those from the Atlantic would meet those from the Pacific slope, making one grand encampment the citizen soldier? of this country, where patriotism and the spirit of emulation would prompt each organization to attain the highest degree of excellence. As the General Government makes yearly appropriations for the equipment of the militia, I see no reason why it should not provide transportation for assembling in the encampment above proposed. The reasonable reduction of rates usual in other countries for such movements of troops and frequently given ia this country would reduce the aggregate cost, say for TO.0U0 State troops and lO.tkM Federal $550,000 approximately .\n\nFor that purpose I would respectfully recommend that Congress be asked to make the necessary appropriation aud to provide the requisite authority for such a movement. HARD WORK SECURING GRAIN CARGOES. The Coroner's Inquiry Into the Pan-Handle Accident in Ohio. STECBESVTLI.E, Oct. 17 .\n\nSpecial. Coroner Starr this morning began his investigation of the Pan-Handle railroad accident near Mingo Junction yesterday, whereby William Marshall and Joseph Vestner lost their lives. Five persons were severely injured and a large amount of valuable property was destroyed. The evidence showed that the deaths vyere more terrible than at first reported, for both Marshall and Vestner were alive when first seen and perished in the flaines. The evidence all tended to show that Sam W .\n\nPerry, the operator at tno west end, was the cause of the accident. He himself testified that he had been on duty thirty-four and a half hours and was asleep at the time of the accident. The Coroner will not announce his verdict until next week. The burned postal-car was a through one from the South and carried mail from that section of country to the East. Most of it was registered packages containing remittances from Southern merchants to wholesale dealers in New York and Philadelphia .\n\nW. R. Johnson a Panhandle Lrakeman, unearthed a registered paefcasre containing It was from tho Ed Collier Banking -mpany of Milan, and addressed to Latham, Alexander No. 18 Wall street, New York. John Peebles, glass-worker, this city, found a certified check for $3,300 .\n\nTwo hundred registered packages were gathered up, but it is known that six packages of registered mail were entirely consumed by fire. Cleveland, Oct. 17. Coroner Sherman of Kent, today rendered his verdict on the wreck of the Otin family excursion train on the Erie railroad at place Sept. 30 .\n\nHe finds Engineer C. E. Brown and Conductor Ernest Biegert of the freight train guilty of gross carelessness and neglect of duty in not observing the signals and in leaving Kent without orders, in direct violation of the rules of the company. The Coroner finds that he railroad company had taken all necessary precautions to prevent accident to tne six excursion trains. THREE NEGRO RIOTERS LYNCHED .\n\nA Large and Brilliant Company Attends the Event Two Mannerch.org and a Number of Well-Enowo Soloists Take Part In a Notable Mnsical Program Elegant Souvenirs Distributed Those Who Were There What the Clab Intends Doing In the Future. The elegant club-house of tho Germania Mannerchor was in a blaze of glory last night. Electric lights showed to advantage the potted plants, the flags, the Persian and Turkish rugs on the floors, and more than all the brilliant company of men and women assembled there. The occasion was the first entertainment given by the club this season. The guests were received by the Reception committee and furnished with copies of an elegantly-bound prospectus of tho entertainments in store fpr thern during the season .\n\nEach program was a work of art. The cover was carved out of calf, the work of Hulbe, the world-famous artificer in leather. It presented in relief a fac-simile of tne original statue of Germania erected in memory of the achievements of the war of 1870 at tho Niederwald Denkmal, near Rudesheim and Bmgen. All the interior was the work of German artists. The feature of last night was the superb musical program .\n\nThe Milwaukee Musik-Verein, one of the most famous choral organizations in the country, united with the Germania Chorus to make it a success. In addition the following soloists appeared: Mrs. Jenny V. Scherenberg, soprano; Mr. Charles Knorr, tenor; Mr .\n\nRudolph Schmidt, baritone and Mr. George Ellsworth Holmes, basso. The Musical Directors. Mr. Eugen Luening, the musical director of the Milwaukee Musik-Verein, and Mr .\n\nHenry Schoenfeld, director of the Germania Mannerchor, were in joint charge of the vocal part of the program, while Mr. Charles Bach was leader of the orchestra. When this has been said the success of the entertainmeut from a musical standpoint is assured. Following is the program Overture, \"RuyBlas\" Mendelssohn Bach's Orchester. hatt' ich ein Hauschen Jnengst Mannerchot a a pell Germania .\n\n\"Lucia\" Fantasia.

The piece de resistance of the musical feast was \"Der Lands-Knocht,\" the rendition of which occupied over an hour. In this cantata the male chorus and the orchestra were all engaged. It was produced in a manner of which the Germania club may well be proud. Many numbers throughout the program were encored .\n\nA Great Throng; Present. The Germania has 700 members and it was well the invitations were restricted to members and their ladies else the spacious halls would not have contained the throng. The announcement that the Milwaukee Musik-Verein is to take part in all the entertainments of the club during the ensuing season has met with universal approval. Harry Rubens, the popular President, seconded by Charles H. Wacker, the Vice-President, ha3 done much to remove the impression that the club is in its nature clannish .\n\nThe class ot entertainments projected for the season is intended to make the club an educator, especially in the matter of music. The excellence of the programs prepared for future entertainments, as well as last night, is due to the efficient Committee of Arrangements, which is composed of the following members: Julius Goidzier, R. E. Bluthardt, Edward Futrst, J. P .\n\nHand, Arthur Magnus, G. L. Reimann, and Albert Schult. After the musical program a reception was held in the rooms, followed by a banquet in the large dining-hall. This room was appropriately decorated with flowers, evergreens, and plants .\n\nSome of Those Present. Among those present were the following: Messrs. and Mesdames: 3. V.

Inauguration or the B.ll Season by the Standard Club .\n\nLast evening the Standard club gave its opening reception and ball of the season at the handsome club home, Michigan avenue and Twenty-fourth street. There was little attempt at display, the only decorations being ferns and plants, but the myriad lights the rich furnishings, and the handsomecosl tumes of the ladies gave an air of splendor to the scene which was all the more brilliant because of its simple setting. At 10 o'clock the grand march began, led by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Siegel, and was participated in by several hundred ladies and gentlemen .\n\nA program\" of twelve dances was enjoyed, an intermission being taken at midnight for supper, which was served in the banquet-balL An orchestra of twenty-five pieces played during the repast, and furnished excellent music for the dancing. There were about 400 persons present, and, while the attendance was not as large as on previous occasions, the reception was one of the most brilliant ever given by the club. An Andience That Fills the Big Auditorium Applauds the Leader and His Musicians to the Echo The Protrram Rendered In ft Manner Heyond Adveree Criticism Its Features Some of Those Who Were In Attendance. No prodigal son was ever received with greater manifestation of delight than was Theodore Thomas and his big orchestra at the Auditorium last evening. Between 3,000 and 4,000 people paid tribute at the box office and there was scarcely a vacant chair in the Auditorium .\n\nThousands of dollars were paid for boxes by people who have thousands plenty, while every 25-cent seat had its occupant, and there ia no telling how many more might have attended if the upper two galleries had been open. The appearance of Mr. Thomas on the platform was the siznal for hearty applause. No sooner had it died away than the music began, and from that time until the close of the program all eyes were turned toward the immense orchestra, all voices hushed, all ears strained to catch every wave of harmony.

A6econd hearing of the program interpreted by the Chicago Orchestra at the public rehearsal and concert at the Auditorium but served to deepen the impressions made by the first and which were in part given voice in these columns yesterday. The orchestra is a truly magnificent one, destined to occupy a position side by side with that held by the finest in America an orchestra which will en-ablo Chicago to take rank in the music world commensurate with her standing as one of the great cities of the country. The playing is beyond adverse criticism, only those shortcomings attributed to the newness of the organization being at any time noticeable, and these being so much fewer than were expected that one can but repeat that Theodore Thomas' success in this direction has been nothing less than phenomenal Such precision, such unity of attack, such accuracy is marvelous when it is remembered that a fortnight ago the first rehearsal had not yet been held .\n\nTheodore Thomas has already worked wonders and tho end is by no means yet. The number on the program new to local concert-goers was Tschaikowski's First Concerto for piano. Once before it has been played here, but with an orchestra so poor that little estimate of its merit as a composition was possible. Last evening it was heard under most favorable conditions. Rafael Joseffy was the master who touched the keys and an orchestra able to reveal the beauties of the difficult score gave support .\n\nThe concerto is one full of the coloring of the northern land where its composer created it, and possesses many noble movements which afford both soloist and orchestra \"plendid opp rtunities to test and display their finest powers. The first movement is the weakest of the three, its majestic introduction preparing the hearer for material grander than the composer has utilized. This material he has treated with skill, but at a length which detracts from the effectiveness the movement might possess were it shorter. The andantino sim plica is an exquisite creation, idyllic and poetic at times, pastorale in style, anon partaking more the character of a berceuse. The middle subject is a quaint conceit and comes almost in the nature of a delightful joke at which both solo and accompaniment smile .\n\nThe final movement is one of splendor, highly colored, and full of broad, striking effect. A subject Russian in nature is most skillfully handled and ends the work with a climax of splendid power. The work is one to which it was thought Joseffy's somewhat dainty style would not be best suited, but he surprised by playing with unexpected breadth and robustness. His mastery of every detail of the technique of his art was displayed in the first and the last movements of the work, in the climax of the latter his rapidity and ease of chord and octave playing being especially excellent. The middle division of the great composition he read with more poetry and feeling than have been revealed by him at any previous appearance in this city .\n\nBeethoven's fifth symphony, a work which, for nobility of conception, melodic beauty, and dramatic power, stands unsurpassed by any instrumental work yet written, was read with that sincerity, truth, and high artistic appreciation which Mr. Thomas has long displayed in it, and although the delicate tonal tints were not at. times brought out as clearly as they have been at one or two previous performances under his baton, yet the rendition was a highly meritorious and satisfactory one. The andante was especially praise-deserving, and one does not remember having ever heard the wonderful transition from the second allegro into the great triumphant march bo effectively given. Dvorak's Hositzka overture has not been played in Chicago since 1888 .\n\nIt is a composition of barbaric splendors, abounding in tremendous climaxes and requiring such liberal use of the brasses as to approach noisiness. Stirring in character it doubtless is, but one wishes that the colors had been a little less lavishly applied. Eine Faust Overture\" of Wagner is dark and somber, but none the less a splendid example of the great composer's ability as a creator of dramatic music. Liszt wished to have a Gretchen theme interwoven in the work, but Wagner, while acknowledging the value of such a contrasting subject in his composition, said that only by a complete remodeling could it be introduced. This he would not do, and, as a result, the lonely, despairing philosopher Faust, unaccompanied by even Mephisto, and destroying by his disgust and weariness at life even the \"sweet, uncomprehending yearning\" which Goethe has him feel for the spirit of woman and her love, is all that exists in the overture to give it interest and color .\n\nSocialism In Germany. The prevalence of Socialism In Germany is indicated by the number of its literary productions. The total number of socialistic periodicals in that country is no less than seventy-six, in addition to which there are upwards of fifty published by labor unions which are allied to Socialism in tone and tendency. There has been an increase since last year of fifteen dailies, nineteen tri-weekiies, and seven weeklies. These signs of the times must be taken into consideration by any observer who endeavors to form an opinion on European questions .\n\nAn Apt Pnpil.

The Vatican and the various church connections, which would inevitably accompany tho Pope in any direction that he misrht go, expend, it is estimated, 6,000,000 of lire yearly among the various business houses of Rome. This is entirely irrespective of the vast total expended by lay and ecclesiastical visitors drawn by the fact that Rome is the headquarters of the church. The amount expended by these varies annually, but an experienced resident snys that in no year can it amount to less than 20,000,000 of lire, including what is paid for paintings, statuary, by the wealthier class of tourists .\n\nIt is true that a good deal of this patronage would remain, eveu should the Papacy oepart, but it is also to be remembered that probably human being, but the same can hardly be said 01 a parrot speaKinz. it Why the Engineer Could Never Ran a Fast Train Agln. San Francisco Call: \"When I was with the Missouri Pacific some years ago there was in our employ an engineer named Wes Haley, who was one of the best men I ever saw ia a cab. He was a careful man and conscientious to a fault so far as his work was concerned but for all that he seemed to have no conception of the meaning of the word fear, and was Known as the fastest runner on the line. For that reason we put him on the fast mail between Kansas City and Sedalia, and for more than a year he took the train through on time .\n\nI cannot recall an instance during that time when he was a minute late. \"At last, however, misfortune overtook him. He had been engaged to De married to a young lady who lived at a smaL' station along the line, but as lovers will, sometimes, they quarreled, and Wes left her in anger. She wrote him to come back, but he was obstinate and made no reply. After a few days he reconsidered the matter and asked for a lay-off, intending to go out and straighten up matters at once .\n\nHe sent no word, intending to surprise her, and that very night she threw herself in front of his engine and was killed. Wes was on the train but riding on the rear coach, An extra man being in his place in the cab. I never saw a man so completely crushed in my life. \"He went back to work in a few days and took his old run, but his heart was gone. For several nights I noticed that his train was reported late and I sent for him .\n\nI asked him about it, and he broke down and cried like a child. His courage was gone, he said, and he dared not rush his engine to the old speed. The upshot of it was we were compelled to put him on a slow train, and he never could be induced to pull a fast train again. He is only one of a number of engineers I have known during my railroad experience to lose their courage, and I never knew one of them to regain it. It requires nerves of iron to pull one of the modern flyers, and that nerve once lost by any mishap an engineer is useless for all time as a fast runner .\n\nThis is a fact known to all old railroad men, nearly all of whom have met with stories similar to that of poor Wes Haley.\" COPPER KETTLES CAUSED THE ILLNESS. Improperly Cooked Food Made the W. C. T. U .\n\nDelegates 111. Beadfoed, Oct. 17. Though the excitement following the poisoning of fully eighty delegates to the State convention of the W. C .\n\nT. U. has somewhat died out the mysterious affair is still tho topic here and will be for some time. Some of the delegates were taken down immediately after dinner, but not until 4 o'clock were the full effects of the poison manifested. Physicians say the symptoms were all those peculiar to poisoning .\n\nThere was no forerunner of the sickness, but a sudden and terrible gnawing at the vitals, Eccompanied by uncontrollable vomiting. In certain more severe cases the pulses of the patients lowered until they were almost imperceptible, followed by deathly pallor and complete prostration. Tho theory of some of the most severely Btricken delegates that the food had been poisoned or the air of thechurch impregnated with gas by some liquor-dealers or other opponents of the temperance cause was completely exploded today. Physicians were of the opinion they had been poisoned by some dendly stuff or powder sprinkled on the grapes, but this theory was shown to be incorrect when investigation today showed the people had been poisoned by food improperly cooked in copper kettles. Of the eighty taken ill about thirty were at first supposed to be beyond bope .\n\nAll those dangerously ill are now out of danger, and it is safe to say all will recover. The \"Seven Wonders\" of i ores. First, a hot mineral spring near Kin-Shantao, the healing properties of which are believed by the people to be miraculous.

The second wonder is two springs situated at a considerable distance from each other in fact, they iiave the breadth of the entire peninsula between them .\n\nThey have two peculiarities: When one is full the other is always empty, and, notwithstanding the obvious fact that they are connected by a subter-raaean passage, one is bitter and the other pare and sweet. The other wonder is a cold wave cave a cavern from which a wintry wind perpetually blows. The force of the wind from the cave is such that a strong man cannot stand before it. A forest that cannot be eradicated is tne fourth wonder.

Aeu Xork Recorder, Settling Day .\n\nLancaster County, Pennsylvania, has a custom that prevails perhaps nowhere eLse in the United States. \"Settling day\" in that county falls upon April 1, and on that day thousands of country folks gather at Lancaster, the county-seat. Bargains are made, contracts are entered into, debts are paid, and new ones are contracted. If a man contracts a debt at any time during the year the understanding is, in the absence of specific agreement, that payment shall be made on settling day. A similar custom prevails in parts of China, but the Lancaster Countians probably took their settling day from German ancestors .\n\nhas been remarked that the voice of a parrot is like that of a crazy person.

It has been said that the Italian Government would not permit the treasures of the Vatican to be removed, but would keep them in Rome as a great museum for the Italian Government. As to this, other governments would probably have something to say, as the treasures of the Vatican are iu great part the gifts of foreign states and Princes, and were donated to the Pope and to no oJier beneficiary. Even the stained-glass windows of tha Vatican stair-case were only recently given to the Pope by tne Regent of Bavaria. It is extremely doubtful, therefore, whether Italy could dare to retain p-operty that obviously belongs to tno head of the Roman Church .\n\nPor this and other reasons there is just cause for the alarm said to exist over the Pope's recent and explicit threat to abandon the sent which the Papacy has held for centuries, and it is believed that the Italian Government may be willing to make some concession to prevent such a calamity. IN THE tXGLISH GALES. Rough Experience of British roasting Vessels Miscellaneous Foreign News. IHPROUt, CABLC.1 Lo xoos. Oct .\n\n17. The Yarmouth fleet has returned to that port, having been at sea since the commencement and throughout the recent most severe gales which have caused so much havoc on land and sea. The fishermen report having had a fearful experience. Their vessels were considerably damaged during the three successive gales which they battled against, but strange to say, in view of the fierceness of the storms, only two fishermen of the fleet were drowned, though it ls-true several others were more or less injured. Among the vessels which have suffered from the gale is the British steamer Ambriz, which beiongs to the line carryina the mails between Liverpool and the west coast of Africa .\n\nIt sailed from Liverpool Wednesday with a large number of passengers bound for the Canary Islands and various ports on the west coast. It had been out but a short time when it experienced the full force of the hurticane, shipping an immense quantity of water. The decks were swept and the boats smashed. The water poured down the companionways in the engine-room, until it was almost impossible for the engineers to remain at their posts. Sea after sea boarded the cteamer and it was impossible for it to free itself by means of the scuppers, and consequently the water found its way into the cabin, and, despite the fact that the hatches wero batteued down, it also entered the hold .\n\nThe Captain feared that his vessel might have been strained by the heavy weather it had experienced, and he therefore put into Holyhead to make an examination and lay to until the gale moderated.
