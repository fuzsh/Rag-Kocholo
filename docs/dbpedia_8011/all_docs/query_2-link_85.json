Also known as Eddy, Barth worked in Porsche's sports development department, which later paved the way for son Jurgen to become a famous name in motorsport. A fine driver, he defected to West Germany after a class win in the 1957 Nurburgring 1000km. Won the 1959 Targa Florio. Three time European Mountain Champion, he won his last title in 1964, whilst suffering from cancer, which he would die from shortly afterwards. Barth started his career as long ago as 1933 in motorcycling, and stayed in that sport until the Second World War intervened.",
