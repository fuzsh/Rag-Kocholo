INTRODUCTION "all languages have typologial links with their neighbouring languages (Trubetzkoy 1939: 86)

The present volume contains 25 papers given at the 8th International Symposium on Language Contact in Europe, which was organized by the Linguistischer Arbeitskreis Mannheim (LAMA) under the title Language Contact in the British Isles and held in Douglas, Isle of Man, September 18 - 24, 1988. The choice of Man as a conference place was not accidental but logical from a geographical, historical and ethnic point of view, as the Isle of Man is situated so strategically in the middle of the Irish Sea at the cross-roads between Ireland, Northern England, Scotland and Wales. The central position of the island was not the only reason for holding an international conference in Douglas, but also the great historical and cultural role, which the island has played throughout its Celtic and Scandinavian past, was an equally decisive factor. During the Middle Ages the island was a veritable meeting-place of Celtic, Nordic and Anglo-Saxon components, so unique in North-Western Europe and still so visible, that to hold a conference on language contact and cultural fusion here seemed to be a natural thing to do. The members of the conference had here, before their very eyes, a miniature of language development in the British Isles, which has led to recession and death of a lesser-used language. The death of Manx is an excellent example, that a small language cannot be saved, if economic and social factors are negative for its use and survival. In other words, the Isle of Man could be used as a stepping-stone to enter the Celtic world in the past and the present. What has happened here, will be repeated elsewhere, where similar sociopolitical conditions prevail as those leading to the death of Manx Gaelic and where a smaller language is confronted with a dominating larger language (English). The causes of the recession and death of Manx belongs to one of the more fascinating problems in contact linguistics (see RHYS 1894, MARSTRANDER 1932, JACKSON 1955, THOMSON 1954-57, 1969 and 1984, HINDLEY 1984 and BRODERICK 1984 and 1986). What does the death of Manx teach us for preserving other Celtic languages from the same destiny?

12

The papers published here deal directly or indirectly with the consequences of contact between languages spoken in the British Isles in the past and the present. The description of contact processes is also a contribution to understanding cultural and linguistic change, which may lead to the rise of new languages. Our undertaking to describe language contact in the British Isles is thus also a description of the genesis of new language varieties and, if standardized and codified, totally new languages. Keeping in mind that death and birth go hand in hand also in the history of languages, it is motivated to start with death in the present volume by dealing first with Manx. The four first papers publihed here treat the decline of Manx (BRODERICK), foreign elements in Manx (THOMSON), place-names in the Isle of Man (GELLING) and foreign influence on Manx stress (0 S£). The special political and economic status which the small island enjoys and has enjoyed since the Middle Ages with a parliament (The Tynwald), legislation, currency and stamps of its own, was, on the other hand, a problem for the organizers of the symposium, in that the island does not today belong to the United Kingdom or Ireland. Therefore no funding was possible through English or Irish sponsors. The fact that the island is not a member of the EC either, prevented a possible financial support through this international organization as well. Consequently, it was up to the participants themselves to carry the costs of the conference and with the generous help of the local organizations in Douglas, Peel and Castletown the Eighth Symposium on Language Contact could be held. In the light of these difficulties it was so much more satisfying that the symposium was met with such great interest among the experts on language contact in the British Isles. Twenty-eight papers were read by participants coming from the Isle of Man, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, West Germany, the Netherlands and the USA, four of which are not published here. Instead one article has been added which was not presented in Douglas.

13 2. The pan-linguistic view of language contact in the British Isles It is not the first time that a linguistics conference focuses on contacts between the languages of the Bristish Isles, but it is the first one to focus on the whole range of contacts between languages as enumerated in Table 1 below, where a score and more are specified from Caesar to Cromwell and Thatcher. It was the task of the symposium to describe the out-come of such contacts and, if possible, arrive at a general typology of language contact in the British Isles, even though all historical contacts were not covered by the papers offered at the symposium. Of the 34 contacts specified in Table 1 six were not dealt with, as speakers could not be found for the following contacts: la Brittonic Goidelic, 4 Brittonic - West Germanic, 6 Goidelic - Old English, 9 Middle Welsh - Anglo Norman, 10 Middle Welsh - Old/Middle English and 20 Middle Welsh - Old Norse. 30 Norman-French English and 31 Romani - English.

u Being easily accessible by sea and practically defenseless against, sudden hit-and-run attacks, the British Isles belonged to one of the most contact-intense areas in North-Western Europe during the Middle Ages due to their exposed position between the North Sea, the Atlantic and the Channel. This exposure to foreign contacts has also been known for a long time in Celtology and English studies. A great number of scholarly activities in the British Isles show that the contact perspective has always been present, especially dealing with place and nature names, loan words etc., although not in a pan-linguistic and integrated way in the sense that all contacts have been accounted for, and both sides of given contacts have been taken into consideration. Of the conferences, research projects and major publications which first come to mind I would like to mention the ten Viking Congresses between 1950 and 1985 now in print (SIMPSON (ed.) 1954, FALCK (ed.) 1955, ELDJÄRN (ed.) 1958, SMALL (ed.) 1965, NICOLAISEN (ed.) 1968, FOOTE and STRÖMBÄCK (eds.) 1971, ALMQVIST and GREENE (eds.) 1976, BEKKER-NIELSEN, FOOTE and OLSEN (eds.) 1981, FELL, FOOTE, GRAHAM-CAMPBELL and THOMSON (eds.) 1983, KNIRK (ed.) 1987 and a symposium held in connection with the Quincentenary of Uppsala University in 1977 (ANDERSSON and SANDRED (eds.) 1978). For the older literature on the contacts between the Insular Scandinavian and Celtic languages see the excellent overview and the state of art of the research on Contacts 17 Middle Irish - Old Norse, 18 Scots Gaelic - Old Norse, 19 Manx - Middle Irish - Old Norse, 20 Middle Welsh - Old Norse 21 Middle Cornish - Old Norse in Werner (1968). The contributions published here deal in a similar way with various aspects of the Scandinavian influence on English: Contact 13 Old Norse - Old/Middle English: in the Danelaw and Anglia (SANDRED), Scandinavian influence on place names in England (FELLOWS-JENSEN), onomastic Danish-English contacts (KISBYE), Old Norse influence on the Old/Mid English pronominal system (WERNER), the rise of a Scandinavian-English creole in the Danelaw (HINES).the decline and death of Norn in Orkney and Shetland (BARNES, MELCHERS). Second, the proceedings of the eight International Congresses of Celtic Studies between 1959 and 1987 contain valuable articles on Insular Celtic languages in contact with other languages spoken

15

in the British Isles (0 CUlV (ed.) 1962, Proceedings of the Second International Congress of Celtic Studies held in Cardiff 1963 (printed 1966), NICOLAISEN (ed.) 1968, Proceedings of the Fourth International Congress of Celtic Studies held in Rennes 1971, Mac EOIN, AHLQVIST and 0 hAODHA (eds.) 1983, EVANS, GRIFFITH and JOPE (eds.) 1986). An inventory of all these proceedings shows that a great number of contact-linguistic articles have been published here, especially those dealing with the contact Celtic Old Norse (Contacts 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22, e.g. 0 CUlV (ed.) 1962 (see e.g. the articles by CHADWICK 1962, DELARGY 1962, HENRY 1962, JACKSON 1962, Mac CANA 1962, OFTEDAL 1962b, SOMMERFELT 1962). Parts of the 1962 proceedings were reprinted in a special volume containing the major papers on the Celtic Scandinavian contacts at the Dublin congress of 1959 (0 CUlV (ed.) 1975). However, an integrated view of all language contacts documented in the history of the Celtic languages has never been presented systematically at any of the Celtic congresses. This is necessary in order to work out a typology of language contact (see section 2 below) and to give an overall picture of the contact patterns as enumerated in Table 1. It has rather been in a piecemeal fashion. Such a panorama of language contacts in the British Isles in the past and the present was one of the major goals of the Douglas symposium. Besides the Manx-English contacts mentioned above some other historical contacts between Celtic and other languages are dealt with in this volume: Contacts Ib , 2b and 3b (in combination) Old Welsh - Old Irish - Latin in the Cambridge Juvencus Glosses (HARVEY); Contact 5: Brittonic - Old English (POUSSA on the rise of English non-standard relativizers); Contacts 11 Old/Mid Cornish - Old/Mid English and 27 Cornish - English (WAKELIN); Contact 29 Pan-Celtic - English (LAZAR-MEYN) Third, the publications of the Minority Conferences held in Glasgow in 1980 (HAUGEN, McCLURE and THOMSON (eds.) 1981) and Galway in 1986 (Mac EOIN, AHLQVIST and 0 hAODHA (eds.) 1987b) contain valuable articles on the contact between Celtic and English and the specific minority problems of Insular Celtic languages in their fight for survival (e.g. AITKEN 1981, GILLIES 1981, McCLURE 1981, MacKINNON 1987, MAGUIRE 1987, THOMSON, D. 1981, PRATTIS 1981, Scotland; AMBROSE and WILLIAMS 1981, AWBERY 1987, JONES 1981, THOMAS 1987, Wales;

16

AKUTAGAWA 1987, FENNELL 1981, HARRIS and MURTAGH 1987, 0 BAOILL 1987, Ireland; GREENE 1981 (pan-Celtic)). However, excepting Greene 1981 and Fennell 1981, there have been no attempts at the international congresses to a general typology of language recession in the British Isles, nor has any one tried to give an overview of the total number of the historical or present contacts in the British Isles. In the present volume the specific Contact 18 Scote Gaelic - Old Norse is described from the view-point of the place names of Lewis (COXXcf. also HENDERSON 1910, OFTEDAL 1956 and 1962a on lexical and phonological aspects), whereas Contact 24 Scots Gaelic - Scots/ English in the Western Isles and Skye is dealt with in another article (MacKINNON) from a socio-linguistic point of view. Contact 28 Scots-(Standard) English is also discussed with special reference to the use of auxiliaries (KIRK). Fourth, the First Hiberno-English Symposium held in Dublin in 1985 brought together experts on the English variety spoken in Ireland and its interaction with Irish and Standard English (HARRIS, LITTLE and SINGLETON (eds.) 1986). In this context the publications edited by 0 Cuiv (1969), 0 Muirithe 1977, 0 Baoill (1985) and ö Riagäin (1988) deserve also to be mentioned, which are useful handbooks for the problems of Contact 23 Irish (Middle) English. . In the proceedings published here the problem of code-switching or borrowing in Modern Irish (Contact 23 Irish - (Middle) English) is treated at some length with emphasis on syntax (STENSON), whereas the development of Irish and English phonological structures in Ireland is seen in the light of the contact between Irish and Hiberno-English (0 BAOILL). The rise of the subordinating and in Hiberno-English and other syntactic structures deviating from Standard English is also dealt with from a contact point of view (ODLIN, FILPPULA). Bilingualism and writing in West Ireland is the topic of another article, which focuses on how well bilingual children write Irish and English in the Connemara Gaeltacht (sixth school year) as compared to bilingual children of the same age in the Grisons, Switzerland (URELAND). Fifth, a number of dialectological projects have directly or indirectly promoted the contact linguistics of the British Isles in that contact-induced structures are visible in almost every

17

dialectological map or table, e.g. The Survey of English Dialects (ORTON et al 1962 - 1969), Word Geography of England (ORTON and WRIGHT 1975, The Linguistic Atlas of England (ORTON, SANDERSON and WIDDOWSON 1978), Adas of English Sounds (KOLB, GLAUSER, ELMER and STAMM 1979), The Linguistic Atlas of Scotland (MATHER and SPEIDEL 1975 - 1977), The Linguistic Geography of Wales (THOMAS 1973), TTie Linguistic Atlas and Survey of Irish Dialects (WAGNER 1958-1969), The Linguistic Survey of Anglo-Irish (HENRY 1957, 1958 and 1985) and The Tape-Recorded Survey of Hiberno-English Speech (BARRY 1981 and BARRY (ed.) 1981, ADAMS, BARRY and TILLING 1985), Studies in Linguistic Geography (KIRK, SANDERSON and WIDDOWSON 1985 and Word Maps. A Dialect Atlas of England (UPTON, SANDERSON and WIDDOWSON 1987). For a historical perspective of language contacts in the British Isles see A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English (McINTOSH, SAMUELS and BENSKIN (eds.) 1985), which" is valuable for reconstructing past contact patterns. The article written by Wakelin for the proceedings could also be seen more in the framework of the dialectological investigations mentioned above, perhaps more than as a contribution to Contact 27 Cornish - English. Sixth, a number of older and more recent publications on language contact in the British Isles must also be mentioned in order to give a complete picture of the great involvement with language contact, which the following studies give evidence of: Contact la Brittonic - Goidelic and Contact Ib Old Welsh - Old Irish (e.g. SARAUW 1900, O'RAHILLY 1942, JACKSON 1953: 122-U8, CARNEY 1973 and HARVEY 1985 on the two Patricks; THOMAS 1971 on the contact between the Celtic (Irish) church and the Roman-Catholic; Contact 2a Brittonic - Latin and Contact 2b Old Welsh - Latin (LOTH 1892, HAVERF1ELD 1906, ZACHRISSON 1927, MUHLHAUSEN 1941, O'RAHILLY 1942, and JACKSON 1953: 76-121, who summarizes earlier research and estimates about 800 loan words to have been borrowed from Latin into the three British languages; LATHAM (ed.) 1975 - 1981, BROOKS 1982, LAPIDGE and SHARPE 1985, LATHAM and HOWLETT (eds.) 1986, LAPIDGE and DUMVILLE 1985, DEVINE, HARVEY and SMITH 1987; Contact 3a Goidelic - Latin and Contact 3b Old Irish Latin (MacNEILL 1931, JACKSON 1953: 122 - 148, McMANUS 1983,

1984, 1986; Contact 5 Brittonic - Old English (LUICK 1914-1940, FÖRSTER 1921, 1941, PARRY - WILLIAMS 1923, KELLER 1925, EKWALL 1924, 1928, 1936 (England); WATSON 1926 (Scotland), THOMAS (1938), WILLIAMS 1945 (Wales); JACKSON 1953: 194 261; Contact 12 Latin - Old/Mid English (POGATSCHER 1888, 1894, COLLINGWOOD and MYRES 1936)

In his Language and History in Early Britain (1953) Kenneth Jackson summarizes the research on the early contacts between British, Latin and Anglo-Saxon by combining both external and internal factors of language change from Brittonic to the modern British languages, Welsh, Cornish and Breton. The rise of these languages is seen within the framework of contacts with Latin and Anglo-Saxon, whereby the role of bilingualism, diglossia, interference, transference, code-switching and language shift for language change and glottogenesis is stressed and included in the description of the Insular-Celtic languages of Early Britain, naturally under other terms than used today, but the description of language contact in Early Britain is surprisingly modern (see in particular Chapter III "Britons and Romans under the Empire" (JACKSON 1953: 76 - 121) and Chapter VI "Britons and Saxons in the fifth to eighth centuries" (idem. 194 - 261). Seventh, for the important contact Anglo-Norman - Old/Middle English (Contact 14) a long series of publications could also be given here. It will suffice here to refer to the extensive bibliographies in Baugh and Cable 1987: 107 - 125 and Berndt 1965 and to the treatment of French loan words in Serjeantson 1935: Chap. V and Jespersen 1938: 78 - 105. In the present volume only one article deals with the influence of Anglo-Norman on the pronunciation of English place-names (CLARK). Eighth, a non-insignificant factor for the development of English was Contacts 15 Middle Low German - (Middle) English and 16 (Middle) Dutch - (Middle) English, which Bense claims to have brought more than 2,500 words of Dutch and Low German origin into the English dialects (BENSE 1939). Like Sense's dictionary there are a number of books and articles which deal generally with the impact of Dutch and Low German on English (HEUSER 1902, de VRIES 1916, BENSE 1925, TOLL 1926, GEORGE 1926, FLEMING 1930, LOGEMAN 1930-31, SERJEANTSON 1935:172) but there are also publications dealing with the influence of Dutch in specific areas of Britain (in Wales, Pembrokeshire: LAWS 1888,

19

OWEN 1895, CHARLES 1938, WALKER 1979; in Kent: SAMUELS 1971; in Scotland: MURISON 1971). Ninth, as examples of recent publications which are of great use for contact linguistics are the contact-oriented book Languages of Britain (PRICE 1984a) and the volume Language in (he British Isles (TRUDGILL (ed.) 1984), in which the contact perspective is present in almost every article ( e.g. AITKEN 1984, Mainland Scotland; BARNES 1984, Orkney and Shetland; BARRY 1984, Isle of Man; BELLIN 1984 and THOMAS 1984, Wales; BLISS 1984 and EDWARDS 1984, Ireland; DOUGLAS-COWIE 1984 and HARRIS 1984 Northern Ireland; MacKINNON 1984 and SHUKEN 1984, The Highlands and The Western Isles; WAKELIN 1984, Cornwall. Tenth, Contact 14 Anglo-Norman - Old/Middle English is still alive on the Channel Islands (Jersey, Guernsey and Sark) as Contact 30 Norman French - English (SJÖGREN 1964, SPENCE 1957, 1984). Eleventh, long distance contacts with the south across the sea have also been assumed on the basis of areal-typological similarities between Insular Celtic languages and other non-Indo-European languages on the Atlantic sea board in the past (Basque and Berber) - the Atlantean Language Area (JONES 1900: Appendix, POKORNY 1927-30, 1949 and 1962, WAGNER 1959, 1962, 1982). Contacts with the north through Norse and even Finno-Ugric languages in Northern Scandinavia (South and North Lappish) during the Viking Age have been assessed for explaining certain phenomena in the North European Language Area posited by Wagner 1962, e.g. preaspiration, pre-occlusives (dn, bm und LM) to mark the plural with a suffix ending. This trend towards suffixal plural structures is a general characteristic of Manx, whereas Irish tends to preserve the old IE vowel alterations to express the sg.-pl. opposition. As with ostems, Manx reflexes of io-, S-, is-, i-, u- stems, lenited velar and dental stems, stems in -t, in -72-, -r- and neuter s-stems generally exhibit only a sg.-pl. contrast, i.e. the plural is the sg. form plus suffix.

72

The vocalization of the original medial palatal spirant in the Manx refl. was perhaps regarded as a weakening in articulation requiring the reinforcement of a suffix. 1.3.14. The foregoing examples indicate that formation of plurals in Olr. can be realized as follows: 1.3.14.1. palatalization of the final consonant with or without umlaut (o-stems; lenited Λ-stems) 1.3.14.2. raising of final /a/ to /i/ (io-, /5-etems) 1.3.14.3. suffix in /a/ (ff-stems, u-stems) 1.3.14.4. suffix in /i/ (/-stems), with syncope (la-stems) 1.3.14.5. suffix in /γΎ (lenited velar stems) 1.3.14.6. suffix in /&'/ (lenited dental stems) 1.3.14.7. suffix in /d'/ (stems in -t) 1.3.14.8. suffix in V+/n, N/ (unlenited Λ-stems) 1.3.14.9. internal palatalization of spirants (r-stems) 1.3.14.10. umlaut + palatalization of final consonant * ending in /a/ (neuter «-stems). Bringing all this down to simple terms plurals in Olr. have either final /CV +/- umlaut or /C + a, i/ or both, the suffix /(m)Vn, N/ or internal palatalization of spirants. A plural ending in /i/, because unstressed, would in the Manx reflexes have become indistinguishable with the singular, e.g. (leaving aside older consonant qualities) (1.3.2.) /dolts/ 'fosterling', pi. */do!ti/ -> /dolta/; (1.3.4.) /sailVa/ 'light', pi. */sail's'i/ -> /sail's'a/ (the fact that we have a pi. in /sail's'ian/ indicates that the ending /i/ was felt to be weak), while a plural suffix in /a/ (brought into contact with a preceding vowel due to the loss or vocalization of an intervening spirant) would due to unstress, have been lost , e.g. (1.3.3.) /d'alu/ 'image', pi. */d'alua/ -> »/d'alu/; (1.3.5.) /kre:u/ 'bone', pi. */kre:ua/ -> */kre:u/ (or EM /kre:f/ pi. */kre:fa/ -> */kre:f/). We have seen the other main distinguishing feature indicating plurals, namely palatalization, has also largely disappeared in Manx resulting in phonemic indistinction between sg. and pi., e.g. (1.3.7.) /ri:/ 'king'.pl. */π:γ'/, */ΓΪ:χ7 -> */ri:/, (1.3.8.) /fine/ 'tongue', pi. »/t'ingaoY -> »/t'ina/. In /kara/ 'friend' (1.3.9.) the plural in */karadV has survived, but with /an/ suffix, probably to make

73 the distinction clearer. With /doras/ 'door' (1.3.6.) an original Manx plural /do:r's'a/ has likely suffered twice: a) loss of /a/ and b) depalatalization of /r/ and /s/, thus rendering it almost the same as the sg. The same would also apply to /e:r/ 'father' (1.3.12.), pi. */e:r'a/ -> /e.-r/, or */e:rW has been replaced to distinguish it from the gs /e:ra/ (cf. 2.5.1.3. below). In consequence this unclarity has necessarily led to morphological innovation in the introduction of suffixal structures to distinguish singular from plural. In spite of this, however, older plural structures do survive, either with umlaut (with or without final palatalized consonant), or with palatalized consonant, or with an ending in /a/ or /i/. These survivals are mainly found in o-, is-, lenited velar stems, and stems in -t. 1.4.

75 1.5. Survival of older Goidelic case forms in Manx 1.5.1. Genitive singular in /-a/ The older genitive singular form in /a/ survives in Manx mainly in is-, i-, r-, and neuter s-stems. In /ff-stems it seems only to be found in set adverbial phrases which have likely helped to preserve it: car ny bleeaney /ka:r na 'bl'iana/ 'all year round', lit. 'the turn of the year'; fud ny bleeaney /fud na 'bl'iana/ 'throughout the year'. 1.5.1.1. /ff^stems: Olr. bliad(a)in f. 'year' (cf. also Sect. 1.4.2.) Olr. EModlr.

The Manx ns form blein can also appear in genitival position, esp. in LM: jerrey yn vlein /d'era an vl'emV 'end of the year', where it is treated as a masculine with lenition (cf. Sect. 2.2. below) here of the lenit. consonant following the definite article in dependent genitive position. 1.5.1.2. In ./-stems; Olr. suil f. 'eye', muir n. 'sea'. Sg.N G

76 Originally neuter in Olr. muir in Manx (and ScG) is treated as masculine in n/as; /an mu:r 'mu:r/ 'the great sea, ocean', and as a feminine in gs: /o:r na 'ma(:)r9/ 'edge of the sea'. 1.5.1.3. In r-stems denoting kinship; Olr. math(a)ir f. 'mother' Olr. EModlr. Sg.N math(a)ir /ma:0irV m thair /ma:har'/ m thar /ma:0ar/ m thar /ma:har/ m thara /ma:hara/

Manx moir /ma:r/ mayrey /merra/

Olr. ath(a)ir 'father', brath(a)ir 'brother', siur 'sister' belong also to this class. The Manx gs reflex /me.-ra/ would represent the alternative form /ma:hara/ in EModlr. This had spread by analogy to other nouns of this class in Manx: /e:r/ 'father', gs /e:ra/; /bre:r/ 'brother', gs /bre:ra/; /s'u:r/ 'sister', gs /se:ra/ (with non-palatalized /s/), cf. Olr. gs sethar /seGar/. For Olr. & /a:/ (and 6 /o:/) -> MX έ /e:/ ([ε:3) cf. Broderick 1986:123. 1.5.1.4. In neuter s-stems; Olr. glenn 'valley' Sg.N G D

EModlr. gleann XgTaN/ gleanna XgTaNa/ gleann /gTaN/

Manx glion /glaun/,/lodn/ glionney /gl'ona/ glion /glaun/,/lodn/

The Manx gs reflex /gl'ona/, often attested in place-names: Ballaglionney /barlVgl'ona/ or Ballalonna /ba:lVlona/, /bala'lona/ (with depalatalized /!/) 'glen farm', shows the same heterolitic development as in Middle Irish where the ns form with neutral /N/ (in Manx /n/) was taken into the gs, and the Olr. ds glinn gave way also to glenn and glionn. 1.5.2. Genitive singular in /-i/ Separate gs forms in /-i/ survive in Manx in original masculine nouns of the o-stem type, usually in nominal constructions, e.g. /dun'an Tu:si/ 'bridegroom', lit. 'man of the marriage', ns. /pu:sa/ cf. Modlr. posadh /po:sa/, g. posaidh /po:si/ < Romance sponsare; /tai O:li/ 'cowhouse', lit. 'house of cattle', ns. /οΐβχ/, cf. Modlr.

77 eallach /aLax/, g. eallaigh /aLi/ 'cattle1; /fer 'tos'i/ 'lea- der', lit. man of /at the beginning', ns. /tos'ax/, cf. Modlr. tosach /tosax/, g. tosaigh /tosi/ (with non-palatalized /s/) 'be- ginning'. 1.5.3. Genitive singular in /-αχ/ in lenited velar stems; Olr. caira f. 'sheep' (v. also Sect. 1.4.3.) Sg. N G

Olr. EModlr. Manx caira /kaira/ caora /ke:ra/,/ki:ra/ keyrrey /ke:ra/ c erach /kairax/ caorach /ke:rax/ keyrragh /kerrax/,

The suffix /-αχ/, /-χ/ is usually attached to forms in /-r/, /-rV + V with syncope of V if necessary. In CM it is found in a number of set nominal phrases of the sort that occur regularly: /boxil'a 'ke:rax/ 'shepherd', lit. 'boy of sheep'; (with definite article) /bleina 'ma(:)x3rax/ 'flower, grass of the field', ns. /πΐα(:)χθΓ/, cf. ScG. machair f. g. mach(a)rach. Olr. machaire, io m, later f. with gs macharach. The feminine genitive form in Manx is rare; it is usually treated as a masculine: /me:s a Va(:)xarax/ 'cattle of the field', with len. after the definite article. Loanwords with r-auslaut may sometimes be treated as lenited stems, viz pooar /pu.T/, g. pooaragh /pu:rax/. Examples of this are rare and seem only to be confined to EM, as in er lau iesh ny poyrygh PB 140 (Mark XIV: 62) */er lau jes' na 'pu:rax/ 'at the right hand of power'. The equivalent in CM is rendered er laue yesh y phooar, with lenition after the definite article, i.e. treated as a masculine. Nouns in Manx with non-r auslaut ma v be similarly treated: /trema Τβνβχ/ 'bed-time', lit. 'time of (the) bed', ns. /l'a:vi/, cf. Modlr. leapa(i) /L'apa/, /L'api/. 1.6. Survival of other case forms in Manx 1.6.1. Original Olr. dative singular as Manx nominative singular A common derivation of many Manx nouns. One example will suffice here; cf.

1.6.2. Original Olr. accusative/dative, singular for Manx nominative singular Also a common derivation for many substantives in Manx. Two examples will suffice: 1.6.2.1. In Af-stems; Olr. soilse f, 'light* (cf. also 1.3.4.) Olr. EModlr. Manx Sg. Ν soilse /soLVe/ soillse /soLVa/ soilshey /sail's'a/, A soilsi /soL's'i/ soillse /soL's'a/ soilshey /sailVi/ G soilse /soL's'e/ soillse /soL's'a/ soilshey D soilsi /soLVi/ soillse /soL's'a/ soilshey The Manx reflex /sail's'a/ would represent the original ns and /sail's'i/ the original a/ds, unless we are to interpret /i/ as a raising after a palatalized liquid or nasal, cf. /ulW, /dun'a/ in Sect. 1.5.1.2. above. 1.6.2.2. In i-stems; Olr. fiche m. 'twenty* Sg. N A G D

EModlr. fiche /Γ ΐχ a/ fichead /f i^d/ fichead /fi/ad/ fichid /fi/idV

Manx feed /fidV, /fid/ feed

79 The Manx reflex /fid'/ would represent the Olr. a/ds form, cf. Ir. ScG. fichid, and /fid/ (with non-palatal, /d/) the Olr. gs., cf. Ir. ScG. fichead, unless we regard /fid/ simply as a depalatalized form of /fid'/. 1.6.3. Genitive plurals In original o-, io-, 8-, /5-stems in Goidelic the gen. pi. had the same form as the nom. sg. (cf. Sect. 1.1. above). This survives in Manx nowadays almost exclusively (in original masculine o-stems) in placenames: /t's'uvat na 'ga:V9l/ 'well of the horses', cf. Ir. tobair na gcapall, /sl'u: no 'ga:'ne:n/ 'mountain of the little cairns', cf. Ir. sliabh na gcarnan, with eclipsis (cf. Sect. 2.2.) after the genitive plural of the definite article. A gen. pi. in /- / survives in Manx keyrrey /ke:ra/ 'sheep' in EM, CM. Olr. EModlr. Manx PL N cairig /kair'iy'/ caoirigh /ke:ri/,/ki:ri/ kirree /ki(:)ri/ G cäerach /kairax/ caorach /ke:rax/, *keyrragh /ki:rax/ In Manx it is found under eclipsis, viz /geirax/, in the phrase ayns bwoaillee ny geyrragh /uns 'buli na 'ge:rax/ 'in the sheepfold', lit. 'in the fold of the sheep'.

1.6.4. Dative plural in /-u/ The old dative plural suffix in Olr. common to all declensions, is -(a)ib /iß'/ and probably represents an earlier -ibis, -obis, etc, cf. L. -ibus, Skt. instrumental -bhih (cf. THURNEYSEN 1970:182). It has practically disappeared from Modern Irish/ScG, and in Manx survives in the occasional nominal phrase: /er 'bi:lu/ 'before him', lit. 'at his lips, mouth', ns. /bi:l/f /bial/, cf. Modlr. ar boalaibh /er 'b'e:al9v'/, ns. boal 'mouth'. Olr. final /ß'/ in Modlr. essentially became /v7 or /u/, but in Manx has become vocalized to /u/. Survival of /vV in EM may be recognized in meirif PB., Ir. mairbh /mer'iv'/ 'the dead'. In CM. LM this would appear as meiriu /meru/ (probably with depalatal. /r/), sg. marroo /maru/ 'dead'.

80 1.7. Loss of case forms In CM in nominal constructions where genitival inflection may be expected often a non-genitive form is found: (in o-stems) /pu:ra Ve:s/ 'the power of death*. Here we have MX. baase /be:s/ 'death' with lenition (cf. Sect. 2.2. below) in the gs after the definite article, viz /ve:s/, but not the expected *vaaish /ve:sV, i.e. also with palatalization of the final consonant ( cf. ball, g. baiU in Sect. 1.1.), cf. Modlr. has /ba:s/, g. Mis /ba:s7 'death'. Similarly in /le:an '};a:ga/ or /~ka:ga/ 'the day of (the) battle', where in the first example the genitive is marked only by lenition, viz. /^a:g9/, radical /ka:ga/, in the second not marked at all, viz. /ka:g9/, i.e. is morphologically the same as the radical. In addition the genitive marker in /-i/, viz />;a:gi/, /ka:gi/, cf. Modlr. cogadh /koga/, g. cogaidh /kogi/, fails to appear. The Olr. neuter s-stem tlr /t'i:r'/, g. tire (later tiredh; cf. DIL T:187) is found as masculine or feminine in Ir., in CM as feminine in the nominal phrase /kumalti na 't's'i:ra/ 'inhabitants of the country', i.e. gen. /t's'i:ra/ is preceded by the feminine genitive form of the definite article, viz /na/, ns. /t's'i:r/. On the other hand /kum9lti an 't's'i:r/ is also found, i.e. the ns form has supplanted the gen. sg. In LM a noun in the genitive is usually marked only by position: /doraxas 9n 'i:/ 'darkness of the night' as compared with the set nominal phrase /fud n9 'hi:/ 'all through the night', with fern. gen. marking. 1.8. Reduction of the genitival and number forms of the Manx definite article The Manx def. art. sg. yn /an/, fern gs ny /n9/, pi. ny /na/ has also suffered from syncretism in that it is reduced to one single form only : yn (the sg.). 1.8.1. /9n 'ga:u/ 'the smith': /an 'ga:yan/ 'the smiths' earlier /na 'gayan/ The long a in /ga:u/ and /ga:uan/ is secondary; cf. bailey and bainney in 2.1.1.2. below. 1.8.2. /tri: d'en 'de:n'a/: 'three of the men'

earlier /tri: d'ena 'de:n'a/

81

In the last example the genitival function of the earlier plural form 737 has been taken over by yn. 2.1. Simplification of the phoneme system 2.1.1. Lack of contrast between neutral and palatal articulation of consonants 2.1.1.1. In the genitive and plural marking The opposition between neutral and palatal articulation of consonants, in initial position at any rate, is preserved in Manx, even in LM, with perhaps the exception of the labials where it is largely lost (cf. BRODERICK 1986). However, the contrast neutral : palatal is lost in final position where palatalization may have been the only marking of case (gs) and number (n/ap) in orig. masculine o-stems. 2.1.1.1.1. Loss of genitive singular marking N G baase /be:s/ 'death* : baaish /bersV -> baase /be:s/ e.g. /re:da've:s'/ 'dying'., lit. On the road to death' -> /rerda'vers/, not /re:d9've:s'/ with gs marking in /sV; cf. also /pu:ra've:s/ in 1.7. above.

2.1.1.1.2. Loss of nom/acc. pi marking Sg.

cabbyl /ka:bal/

PI.

cabbil

Note the raising of the final syllable before the palatal. /. However, /ka:bol/ also occurs to express the n/ap, and because of the loss of the palatalization rule /C/ -> /CY word finally (in masc. o-stems), the sg. and pi. forms have become homophonous. As a result the suffix plural marker /-an/ has been applied to /karbal/ to distinguish it from the singular, i.e. the loss of allophonic variation has thus led to morphological innovation.

82

2.1.1.2. In the phonemic system The loss of the palatalization rule has not only had consequences for the morphophonemics of Manx described above, but has to an extent changed the phonemic patterning of the Manx consonantal system. For example, the double phonemic contrast /L.N.R/ in Olr., viz. neutral : palatalized, unlenited : lenited: /L:L', 1:1'; N:N', n:n'; R:R', r:r'/ is largely reduced in Manx to a single opposition of neutral : palatalized (in init. pos.) in each of the three, and in LM in L and N, with partial survival in R, viz. /bl'Llj]; nin'Cnj]; r:(Cr'])/. In some cases there is even further reduction to /I, n, r/. The following are given as an example of the simplification of the phoneme system in Manx (Mod.Ir./ScG exx. are given for comparison): /L/

Neutral consonants, having velar articulation in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, have largely lost this quality in Manx. For the reduction of Olr. /R'>R/ in EModlr. cf. 0 Murchu (1989: U3-U6). 2.2. Loss of initial mutation The main morphophonological pattern of Manx, as with other Insular Celtic languages, is the system of consonant replacement in initial position in nouns, verbs and adjectives. In certain environments the distinctive features which make up certain of the initial consonants or consonant clusters are wholly or partially replaced and the result shares an articulatory position with the radical consonant. Such replacements are systematic and can be predicted for certain environments, e.g. def. art., prep. + art., some poss. particles, some adverbs, one or two numerals, etc. In common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic two forms of initial replacement are discernible in Manx: lenition and nasalization (or

eclipsis). Lenition in Manx essentially spirantizes bilabials, labio-dentals, dentals and velars, while nasalization voices /p, t, k, f/ and eclipses /b, d, g/. The system including palatalized variants for single initial consonants could be sketched as follows: radical /p t t' k' k b d d' g' g m f s s' / len. [f η,χ η,χ' χ χ,η ν y/w γ',] y'.j v 0 h η,χ' ] nas. [b d d' g' g m n n' n' n v ] For consonant clusters (in LM only) radical /tr kw bw mw fw sl snV len. [χτ hw^w w w hw l (n')] (no nas. forms recorded) For exx. cf. Broderick (1986:65). In addition there developed Co] as a modified articulation of /t, d, s/ and Cz, z] of /s, s'/. For exx. cf. Broderick 1986:1. However, associated with the reduction of phonemes and loss of allophonic variation, there occurred also loss of initial mutation, which in LM ceased to have any grammatical or other function, and as meaning could be conveyed without it its failure to appear became more marked in the transition from CM to LM. Some of the first victims included the loss of initial /χ/ and /γ/ (and /χ'/ and /γΎ or /j/) to their radical /k/ and /g/ respectively (cf. also Yn Vible Casherick in the Conclusion below, p.105.). 2.2.1. Loss of lenition

Loss of lenition can be found in the following environments. All lenitable consonants in theory could fall victim, but in the event it is mainly labials and velars which are affected. 2.2.1.1. After def. art. governing an orig. fern, in N/A: /in vedn/ 'the woman* > /in bedn/, (rad. /bedn/) 2.2.1.2. After prep. + art. in dat. sg. /asa Ve:da/ 'in the boat' > /asa 'be:da / (/be:da/) /asa Te.-ba/ 'in the paper' > /asa 'pe:ba/ (/pe:ba/) /ega Ve:ga/ 'at the market' > /ega 'me:ga/ f/me:ga/)

85

2.2.1.3. After poss. part, /ma/ 'my', /da/ 'thy', /a/ 'his' /ma 'jis'ig/ 'my father' > /mo 'd'is'ig/ (/d'is'ig/) 2.2.1.4. After certain numerals, e.g. /de:/ 'two' /de: xid/ 'two hundred' > /de: kid/ (/kid/) /de: wun'a/ 'two men' > /de: dun'a/ (/dun'a/) 2.2.1.5. In adj. after orig. fern. /iris' Vai/ 'good weather' > /iris' mai/ (/mai/) 2.2.1.6. In adj. after qualifying adv. /fi: 'vai/ 'very good' > /fi: 'mai/ (/mai/) 2.2.1.7. In nouns after the prep, /da/ Of /pa:t da 'vi:/ 'some food* > /pa:t da 'bi:/ (/bi:/) 2.2.1.8. In infinitive after /da/ 'to' /da 'hit/ 'to come' > /da 't's'it/ (/t's'it/) /da 'jenu/ 'to do' > /da 'd'enu/ (/d'enu/) 2.2.1.9. In def. noun in dep. genitival position /k'o:n Vrada/ 'Bradda Head' > /k'o-.n 'brada/ /k'ed an 'yau/ 'the smith's trade' > /k'ed an 'ga(:)u/ 2.2.1.10 Def. art. + t to orig. fern. N/A in s/in 'tu:lV 'the eye' > /in 'su:17 (/su:17) As LM began to lose its vitality false lenition also appeared (here in an attributive adj. qualifying an orig. masc. noun: /gila 'beg/ 'a wee lad' > /gila 'veg/. In spite of the above exx. failure of lenition does not occur in secondary forms without base forms: /jinax/ 'would do', cf. Ir. dheineadh, /va:/ 'was', cf. ScG. bha-, /haris'/ Over', cf. Ir. thairis, etc. 2.2.2. Loss of nasalization In LM nasalization is now only found in set phrases or fossilized forms:

86

2.2.2.1. After poss. part /nan/ Our, your, their' /to:s/ 'silence' - /nan 'dors/ 'in their silence' 2.2.2.2. Sometimes after the neg. part /ha/: */krem/ Ί believe' - /ha 'grem/ Ί do not believe' 2.2.2.3. Sometimes after ER 'after1 in the perfect /d'enu/ 'doing' - /e 'n'enu/ 'having done' As with permanent lenition no failure of nasalization occurs in examples showing permanent nasalization: /vel/ 'is, exists' (dep. pres. of TA), cf. Ir. bhfuil /ma'git/ 'around', cf. Ir. mun gcuairt /mar'gedan/ 'also' cf. Ir. mar an gcoadna 2.2.3. Loss of final mutation Final mutation in Manx manifested itself as palatalization of dentals, nasals and laterals to indicate attenuated plural forms (of the o-stem type): /ket/ 'cat' pi. /ketV /bod/ 'penis' /bwidV /je:n/ 'lamb* /je:n'/ /s'o:l/ 'sail' /soil'/ /ka:bal/ 'horse /ka:bi!7; cf. above Sect. 1.4.13., 2.1.1.1.2. However, as the palat. element became indistinct (possibly due to contact with English where final /nV and /Γ/ at any rate are not found), so did the distinction between sg. and pi., thus giving rise to suffix pi. forms: /ketan/, /bodan/, /ka:balan/, etc. 3. English influence This has occurred in LM in a variety of ways:

87 3.1. Substitution of English for native words The initials and numbers refer to the respective speakers and pages in Broderick 1984 I. cur lesh luck mie : aigh /e:x/, sonnys /son9s/ /kur 1'es' luk 'mai/ HK 328 'bringing good luck' aigh, originally treated as a fern., is found in the Abschiedsgru aigh vie /β:χ 'vai/ 'good luck', and because of this association the English loan was likely introduced to express 'luck' in other contexts. Sonnys 'luck' also has the meaning of 'abundance, saiety', which would not be the sense required here. Mixed Manx Normal Manx v'ad geam each elley : v'ad geam da cheilley /vad g'ebm lit's' 'ela/ (sic) JK 254 /vad 'g'ebm de Verb/ 'they would be calling to each other' v'eh feer fond jeh Ihune /ve fi:a 'fond d'e ludn/ NM 348 'he was very fond of ale'

'Manxification' of English loanwords In some cases loans into Manx have to an extent become 'manxified', in that they have been fitted into the morphology, phonology, etc: tessyn ny ridgeyn : immyryn /imaran/ (pi.) /tesan na 'rid'an/ TC 190 tessyn ny immyryn 'across the ridges/furrows' /tesan na 'himaran/ (application of suffix pi. -yn]

daa vlister vooar .· bolgan /bolgan/ /de: vlistar Vu:o/ JK 248 daa volgan vooar 'two large blisters' /de: volgan Vu:r/ (application of lenition and number rules, i.e. /de:/ occasions lenition in and the sg. of the following noun) 3.3. Adaptation of English syntax and caiques v'ad coamrit ayns jiarg : va eaddagh jiarg orroo /vad komrit' uns d'erg/ TC 168 /va edax 'd'erg oru/ 'they were dressed in reef 'there was red clothing on them' 'wear* is normally expressed by a prepositional phrase with ER On', coamrit usually describes the manner in which one is dressed, e.g. /ve komrit' goris' bod 'gonax/ 'he was fancilly dressed', lit. 'he was dressed like a sore prick'. daa deiney /de: de:n'a/ HB 274 : daa ghooinney /de: wun'a/ 'two men' (for /de:/ + len. + sg. form v.3.2. above). va'n margey ooilley harrish : ... ec kione /ek k'o:n/ /van me:g9 ul'u herisV JK 252 'at an end' OR 'the fair was all over /va k'o:n kurit'era Ve:ga/ lit. 'an end was put on the fair'. (Again a prep, phrase with ER On'). ta shin laccal laa jeh /tas'an la:l la: d'e:/ JK 230 'we are wanting a day off

: ... laa seyr /la:'se:r/ 'a free day',

ny schoillaryn Airt Chiarn : 0 schoillaryn Phurt Ghiarn /na skolaran po:rt'a:rn/ HK 326 'the pupils of/at Port Erin' In phrases containing a definite dependent genitive no preceding def. art. is felt to be necessary. Though this is sometimes found in Old Irish and later its deletion became the general rule for all

89

branches of Gaelic. Its reintroduction is therefore likely to be due to contact with English where a preceding def. art. in such cases would be required. 3.4. English terminations on native words brasnags 'faggots'

: brasnagyn /bra:snag9n/

3.5. Confusion of idiom and other factors v'ee feer cross er ny paitchyn : corree rish 'angry with' /vei fi:a 'krors er no pet'an/ TC 184 'she was very cross with (lit. on) the children' Here the idiom corree rish has been confused with a similar idiom using ER, viz. ta corree er 'he is angry* lit. 'there is anger on him*. ere t'ou laccal aynshoh...? Reue shiu ass shoh! /kre: teu la:l uns'o: ? reus'u as's'o:/ TC 186 'what do you (sg.) want here? Get ye out of here!' : Fow royd ass shoh! /feu'rord as's'o:/ 'get you (sg.) out of here!' Here the use of the sg. imp. (informal) has been used in combination with the pi. (formal) for the same person. This mixture is common in LM. 3.6. Substantive verb for copula Briefly expressions of equation in Gaelic normally require the copula, e.g. 'he is an Irishman* (Ir.) is oireannach ό lit. 'is an Irishman he'; 'he is the doctor* (Ir.) is έ an dochtur e lit. 'is he the doctor he'. In Manx 'we are Manxmen' would be is/she Manninee shinyn lit. 'is/is it Manxmen we (emph. pn.)' or she Manninee ta shin lit. 'is it Manxmen which we are (with rel. constr.); 'he is the doctor* would be eshyn yn fer-Ihee lit. 'he (emph.) the doctor' (with zero copula).

90

To indicate a present state of affairs or function, e.g. a job, the indefinite form can also be expressed in Manx with TA + nn/pn + IN plus poss. part, coalesced + predicate, so ta shin nyn Manninee lit. 'we are/exist in our Manxmen'; ta shin nyn vir-lhee 'we are doctors', lit. 'we are in our doctors'. Depending on the poss. particle used is whether len. or nas. is occasioned in the following predicate. However, particularly in Manx, the substantive verb has since the eighteenth century become more and more pervasive in such constructions, and probably due to the falling out of the prep./poss.part. element because unstressed the following can appear: tra va shinyn pohnaryn beg 'when we were small children' Are: ve s'irpn p&n'aran 'beg/ HK 326 :tra va shinyn nyn Aohnaryn begCgey] lit. 'when we were in our small children' (with nas. after nyn (1/2/3 pi.)) v'eh ooilley Gaelg v'ad taggloo : she ooilley Gaelg v'ad taggloo /vi ul'u gilg vad'ta:lu/ NM 97 /s'e: ul'u gilg vad 'ta:lu/ 'it was all Manx (which) they were talking' In cleft sentences such as the above the substantive verb regularly replaces the function of the copula in expressing emphasis. Here the past tense of VE 'being' + 3 sg. m. pn. replaces the present of the copula IS + 3 sg. m. pn. viz. /s'e:/. The present of the copula functions for all tenses. The separate past/past conditional form by /ba/ (occasioning lenition) appears only in set idioms (cf. BRODERICK 1984 I: 96-97). ta shoh yn chabbal :shoh yn chabbal /s'o: an t's'abal/ /ta s'o: an t's'abal/ JK248 'this is the chapel' The copula is not used before demonstratives. For exx. cf. Broderick 1984 1:93-97. A fuller description of the linguistic decline of Manx is to appear in a forthcoming book on language death in the Isle of Man.

91

B. The Socio-Linguistic Situation of Manx The arrival of Goidelic, or Gaelic, speech in Man seems to have taken place ca. 500 AD,1 and it eventually ousted a British language apparently spoken there.2 The early history of Goidelic in Man is obscure, but it survived four centuries of Scandinavian presence (9th cent, to 1266).3 From 1289 to 1334 Man was contended for in Scottish-English rivalries, and from 1334 to 1405 it was the property of several Anglo-Norman magnates who retained the title "King of Man". From 1405 to 1736 Man found itself in the possession of the Stanley lords of Knowsley (near Liverpool), after 1485 "Earls of Derby" and from 1521 (if not before) styled "Lords of Man". From 1736 to 1765 Man was in the hands of the anglicized Dukes of Athol.4 Though there is likely to have been a bardic tradition in Man5 supported by a native Gaelic speaking aristocracy before and during the existence of the Manx kingdom of the Isles (ca.950-1266), this is unlikely to have continued under a non-Gaelic speaking hierarchy from the beginning of the 14th century, if not before. Though the language of administration from that time would also have been non-Gaelic, it was nevertheless found necessary, for example, for Bishop John Phillips (1604-1633) to translate the Anglican Book of Common Prayer into Manx, ca.1610 (cf. MOORE & RHYS 1895) and for Bible translations (published 1748-75; last edition of complete Bible 1819. of NT 1825) and a Manx version of the Prayer Book (last published 1842) to be made. These facts make it clear that up until the latter date at least the bulk of the ordinary Manx people spoke Manx, or at any rate felt more at home in that language. The earliest reference, so far as is known, to a Gaelic language in Man, occurs in Gamden 1586: Incolae tarnen, & lingua & moribus ad Hibernicos proxime accedunt, ita autem ut Norwagicum quiddam admisceatur (CAMDEN 1586: s.v. "Yle of Man") In giving the various names which Man was/is known by Gamden has: [...IMenaw Britannis, incolis Maning (G. Manamn] [...]

92

This was confirmed in statements made in 1611 (by Speed), in 1656 (Chaloner), in 1663 (Barrow), in 1695 (Gibson), and in 1702 (Sacheverell)6, though Gibson also claimed that: not only the Gentry, but likewise such of the Peasants as live in the towns, or frequent the town markets, do both understand and speak the English language (GIBSON 7 1695:coU064). Tliis comment, however, has to be seen in context. At that time the population of the Island was no more than ca. 14,000, the four towns (in 1726) being thus populated: Castletown (capital till 1869) 785, Douglas 810, Peel 475, Ramsey 4608. The gentry were also able to understand and speak Manx, as Gibson admits.9 The language of government and law (English) would not have affected the everyday lives of the ordinary people at that time.

1. The first measures of Anglicization The first determined effort, so far as we know, to bring in English in a systematic way to the ordinary Manx people was made by Bishop Isaac Barrow (1663-1671). Barrow's appointment in that year followed the restoration of the Stanley lordship after the collapse of the "Commonwealth". Cromwell's forces, it will be remembered, were introduced into Man in 1651 (though it is known they would have come anyway) through the agency of William Christian ("Illiam Dhone"), Receiver-General and head of the Manx militia, as an act of "rebellion" against the then Earl of Derby.10 As his supporters were the ordinary Manx people who spoke Manx, that language was therefore regarded by Derby and his supporters as identifiable with rebellion and its speakers looked on with suspicion. In addition, as the state of the Church (of England) in Man was considered by Barrow as leaving a lot to be desired,11 the introduction of English was to form part of his "improvement scheme". He had apparently found on his arrival that the Manx clergy (almost all native Manx) extemporized from the English versions of the scriptures before their Manx congregations, and considered that a lack of knowledge of English among the Manx populace was preventing an adequate understanding and

93

appreciation of the scriptures. There was, however, Phillips' translation of the Prayer Book (ca.1610; cf. above), but which was evidently unknown to Barrow.12 Instead of providing the scriptures in Manx (through which the people would have understood them better) Barrow, in line with the thinking of his time, resolved to foist English on the Manx population through a parish school system.13 The scheme met with limited success, until it was revamped by Bishop Thomas Wilson (1698-1755) at the start of the 18th century. Wilson's policy, pursued with vigour, of enjoining all Manx parents under penalty of fines to send their children to school to learn English formed part of his greater scheme of creating a theocratic state. Inevitably the Church under Wilson came into conflict with the civil power in Man, and in 1722 Wilson and his two Vicars-General were committed to prison at Castle Rushen. The supremacy of the State over the Church resulted in the decline of Wilson's education system, and by 1736 it was in virtual collapse.14

2. The translation of the Bible into Manx In spite of Wilson's pro English language stance, he nevertheless realized that the scriptures would have to be made available in Manx simply because the bulk of the people (in Wilson's view more than two thirds)15 could not understand English. In 1707 he had printed bilingually his Principles and Duties of Christianity, known in Manx as Coyrle Sodjey ('further advice') and during their sojourn in jail Wilson and his Vicars-General set about organizing the translation into Manx of St. Matthew's Gospel. This translation is credited to Dr. William Walker, one of the Vicars-General and a Manxman (d.1729), but it came into print only in 1748 (by John Oliver, London, printer to the SPCK) at Wilson's expense. Wilson also encouraged the translation of the Anglican Prayer Book into Manx which came out in 1765 (THOMSON 1979: ii). However, it is due to his successor Bishop Mark Hildesley (1755-1772), also an Englishman, that we owe the main drive to having the full Bible translated into Manx and published 1767-73.16 The advent of Methodism into Man at that time also promoted the use of Manx as a medium of converting

the people, and in this way, in spite of contradictory comments on the Manx language by Wesley himself,17 gained considerable ground from the established Anglican Church. The Methodists also actively supported the old Manx tradition of the Oie'll Voirrey (/itl'vura/; Anglo-Manx /i:l'veri/) at which carvals (comprising an extensive corpus of some 20-25,000 lines of original Manx verse, mostly on religious themes, arranged in a series of songs averaging some 35 stanzas in length) would be sung, initially in the parish churches, then (in the course of the 19th century) in the Methodist chapels on St. Mary's Eve (Oie'll Voirrey) or Christmas Eve,18 Methodism discouraged the secular song tradition, however.

2.1 The school as an anglicizing factor After the virtual collapse of Wilson's "cure" (as his education proposals were termed) for the Manx (CLAMP 1988c:198) English schooling in Man thereafter was never set on a firm footing till Man came fully within the English education ambit in 1858. In 1872 the Manx authorities adopted the English Elementary Education Act of 1870 which provided for compulsory schooling (in English) from 5-13 years. The Manx Act made no provision for the Manx language, but by that time Manx was in an advanced state of demise and any hostile intent towards Manx abetted by the 1872 Act was in reality ineffectual.19 2.2 Trade, migrations, language shift

mining and tourism causes of

The decline of Manx results not so much from rigorous action against it from within, but from a changing set of circumstances emanating from without. Until the mid-18th century Man had little contact with the outside world. Given its small population and resources external trade and contact could hardly have been all that great anyway, and English was therefore unnecessary to people outside the small towns, where it was spoken alongside Manx without displacing it (cf. above). There was little incentive or

95

reason for outsiders to come to Man, and so everyday contact between town and country areas was therefore important and Manx would need to be used. The impetus in the direction of English came about the early/mid-18th century largely as a result of an activity many Manx people profitted from - "smuggling"! Because of restrictive English (British from 1707) trading practices Manx seamen reacted by adopting smuggling into England, Scotland and Ireland of such commodities as wines, spirits, tea, tobacco, obtained principally from France, Spain, Portugal, Norway and Sweden, as a major industry. The practice was not smugglinginto Man, but out of it, since duty on the above items was paid in Man at the (low) Manx rate. However, the "running trade", or the "trade", as it was known, also attracted English and Scottish merchants to the Island and stimulated the Manx ports, particularly Douglas, and with it brought new ideas, capital, and an increase in the use of English. In 1765 the British Government stepped in and through an Act of Revestment20 transferred sovereignty to the British Grown and attempted to suppress "smuggling" by direct rule.21 This meant in effect that the Island's finances were controlled by the British; they paid the costs of Man's administration and kept the rest in London. A direct result of this was an onset of poverty through loss of earnings from the "trade" and the ensuing depression resulted in emigration, for which Manx was useless, and the administration of direct rule enhanced the status of English. The contacts with the outside world, particularly during the latter period of the "trade" (about 100 years) and the depression that followed Revestment caused Manxmen to widen their perspective (CARLISLE 1813:11; 22 CAMPBELL 1885-6:177; HINDLEY 1984:18). In addition, during the course of the 19th century a number of changes and developments militated against Manx. First, immigration into the island from north-west England from ca.1790-ca.18U (MOORE 1900:575) of people on low fixed incomes. The settlement was not restricted to the towns. In the north of the Island there was significant settlement from southern Scotland (CAMPBELL 1885-6:177). This immigration, especially in the towns, formed the basis of the Manx (Methodist) bourgeoisie. Second, a second period of depression, this time after the Napoleonic Wars, but especially from 1825-1837, resulted in mass migration, particularly from northern and western areas to

96

Liverpool, Manchester, but mostly to America (MOORE 1900:930-31; BIRCH 1964:20, 79). Additional "peaks" in emigration occurred also in the 1830s due to a depression in the fishing, a vital industry for local labour, in the 1840s (potato famine), and in the 1860s resulting from commonland reorganization which would have affected many squatter-farmers (BIRCH 1964:79-80, 119, 136-7; HINDLEY 1984:29). Third, the first "modern" roads of 1750-1800 brought closer links between town and country areas. Fourth, the establishment of regular steamer services, especially from 1833 (when the Isle of Man Steam Packet Co. was founded) between Man and Liverpool. Fifth, following on from the foregoing, the advent of the tourist industry. From 1830-50 there were ca.20-30,000 visitors a year when the Island's population was ca.40-50,000. By 1870 or thereabouts the number of visitors rose to ca.60,000 per year, and by the 1890s over 250,000 per year. Though most would find entertainment (then as now) in and around Douglas, the building of the steam and electric railways (between 1873 and 1898), facilitated access to remoter areas. The penetration of the innermost parts of the Island by visitors and the immigration of additional personnel to service the tourist industry meant that a knowledge of English was essential everywhere, i.e. during the 3-4 months (June-September) of the tourist season, but that in itself did not make Manx redundant. Sixth, the transformation of the rural economy by improved agricultural methods and ideas from outside, and by the opportunities of an expanded market due to tourism. Seventh, the expansion of the mining industry at Laxey and Foxdale (ca.1870) and the importation of labour, especially from Cornwall, to service that industry. The localization of mining, essentially in those two areas, would not have contributed much to the decline of Manx outside those areas, nor would the fishing industry have done (also in full swing at that time), staffed as it was by a local Manx labour force. The serious decline to both these industries by 1890, however, and the resultant emigration would have had little linguistic impact, as Manx by then had receded considerably. Eighth, the onset of the 20th century and the increase in internal and external mobility (HINDLEY 1984:30-31).

97

2.3 Comments made on the position of Manx In spite of the above developments Manx did not disappear overnight.23 A cursory glance at Manx newspapers (in English)24 for the earlier part of the 19th century makes interesting reading: MANKS ADVERTISER 10.01.1822: Letter to the editor in support of a resolution by the then bishop (George Murray) not: to admit in future any candidate for the Manks Church, even to Deacon's orders, before he has acquired a complete knowledge of the Manks language [...KbecauselC...] the Manks language, owing to a certain peculiarity belonging to itself, is perfectly understood by the most 25 ordinary capacity to be found in an assembly of Manksmen. The same paper for 11.04.1837 also carries details of a "Bill to prevent the Introduction of Clergymen who are not fully conversant with the Manx language to Parish livings within this Island". MANKS ADVERTISER 06.06.-04.07.1822: Heated correspondence for and against the retention of Manx. An example of the hostility towards Manx even then is given in full in Appendix A. MANKS ADVERTISER 25.07.1822: Notice of a speech delivered by Rev. Hugh Stowell (the elder 1768-1835) at the annual meeting of the Peel Ladies' Bible Assoc. on the need for more Bibles in Manx. MANKS ADVER SER 01.01.1824: English and Manx text of a bill for the commutation of tithes. The editorial (p.3) gives as the reason for printing the Manx text: that they [the Manx speaking population] may the more comprehend the purport of them [the proposals]. It is a remarkable fact, that although the Manks dialect or Gailc is gradually falling into disuse, the generality of the people continue to speak it, and love to hear it - more particularly when it concerns their more intimate interest.26 MANKS ADVERTISER 01.01.1833 (also in MANX SUN 01.01.1833): Letter from Rev. Robert Brown of Kirk Braddan, that as he could not recollect during his time in Douglas that a sick person whom he visited could not converse with him in English.

98

He does not consider a knowledge of Manx absolutely necessary for a minister at St. Barnabas's (Douglas), provided he prevails on neighbouring clergymen to perform the Manx services for him (as he did at St. Matthew's) or employs a "pious young man" in the capacity of a curate for this purpose. MANX SUN 06.08.1842: A long letter questioning the assumption that English is understood and spoken by the rural population at large. Emphasises the need for Manx in church services. Regarding the practicalities of having Manx for business purposes the writer adds: It is well known, that in the principle shops in Douglas it is found absolutely necessary to employ a person conversant with the Manx language to transact business with country customers, and I have lately heard a Douglas tradesman declare that one half of the people resorting on Saturdays to the shop, in which he serves, were unable to ask for what they wanted in English (MANX SUN 06.08.1842).27 MANX SUN 21.06.1845: A long letter advocating the appointment to the vacancy at Lezayre of a person competent in Manx "L...]as it is a fact that two thirds of the parishioners cannot benefit from the religious services performed in any other language than Manx". Interesting also are two letters on this subject from Bishop W.A. Shirley of Sodor and Manx (1847 only), an Englishman, from his seat at Bishop's Court: a) to his son 05.02.1847 [...]You will understand one feature of this responsibility, when I tell you that though I am patron of only four vicarages, these livings, with some chapelries recently constituted in my gift, comprise more than half the population of the island, and have not an aggregate income of one thousand pounds per annum; besides which I have the additional difficulty that the Manx language is required in most of them, which limits my choice to men who, for the most part, are behind the English in vigour, education, habits of business, and even piety and their moral standard (HILL 1849:463).

99

b) to his parents 18.02.1847 C...]The Manx papers amuse me now and then with letters from correspondents about what Bishop Shirley ought to be made acquainted with, and how he ought to act. The great point of discussion is whether Manx-speaking clergymen are to be exclusively appointed to livings. I have appointed one to a vacant vicarage; but they are a heavy set, and will soon be exhausted, for their children do not understand Manx. I am glad to hear that the children in the streets play in English. The Manx is a language without a literature, except the Bible and Prayer-book lately translated, and as far as I can make out, has neither dictionary nor grammar deserving of the name. It is an unmitigated portion of the curse of Babel. I will send you a Manx paper - it is sad stuff (HILL 1849:476). (Shirley had obviously not seen, or had not thought much of, Cregeen's Dictionary (1835) or Kelly's Grammar (1804). The towns are probably meant re the use of English by children on the streets).

3. Surveys and census enumerations concerning Manx Though Ravenstein (1879:591-92) dates the decline of Manx from the beginning of the 19th century, the first survey giving a reliable general assessment of the position of Manx was made by Henry Jenner in November 1874, published in 1875. The survey consists of a series of questions directed at the Anglican clergy in all 17 parishes (exclusive of Douglas) as to the numbers of people who spoke Manx and/or English and the necessity or otherwise of Manx for church services. Though in some cases the clergy could not give accurate details for their parish (either because the living was vacant, or for whatever reason), nevertheless Jenner was able to show that the "strongest" areas where, according to his figures, Manx was habitually spoken were (in the North) the parishes of Bride, Lezayre and Jurby, and (in the South) in Arbory. According to his figures, out of a total population of 41,084 for all the parishes 12,340 spoke Manx habitually and 190 spoke no English at all. With the exception of Kirk Arbory, where the language (for

100

church work) was "indispensible", Manx for the others was considered at the most "useful". With regard to the children Jenner comes to the following conclusions: "English and Manx" (Michael, Maughold, Arbory), "English and a little Manx" (Bride, Jurby, Andreas). "English only" (the remaining 11 parishes)(JENNER 1875:23)/8 However, as is known from the last native speakers and their birthplaces (cf. Map 4 ), scattered families continued to speak Manx. In addition Jenner printed the following comments: From the Rector of Kirk Andreas: Children pick up a little Manx when they leave school. Old people, so to speak, "dream in Manx". Servants like to keep it up as a class language not understood by their masters. From the Vicar of Kirk Arbory: Dissenters (?Methodists) make considerable way owing to the neglect of Manx by the [Anglican] Church. From the Vicar of Kirk Lonan: Manx is preferred by the country people (in parochial ministrations), as they can understand every word, which they cannot in English. From the Vicar of St. George's, Douglas: In country parishes one finds three generations in one cottage. The old speaking Manx only, the middle Manx and English, and the children English only (JENNER 1875:24). In April 1875 Jenner, according to his own account (p.25), visited Man himself and attended a Manx service at Kirk Arbory held on the fourth Sunday after Easter. Although the congregation joined in the service "very heartily", he noticed after the service that "such of the congregation as remained talking together in the churchyard and near it, almost always spoke in English. Indeed I heard but little Manx talked during my stay in the Island, excepting when done for my edification, though the English of many of the old people showed plainly that they must be more at home in Manx". The Rev. Wm. Drury of Kirk Braddan told Jenner (p.25) that he sometimes used Manx in his sermons "to clinch the matter" (as Drury put it) for the benefit of the older people. Jenner adds: During the whole of my tour I only met with one person who could not speak English, though I went into a good many Manx cottages on various pretexts of resting, asking the way, etc, so as to find some 29 such person [who had Manx] if possible (JENNER 1875:26).

101

In conclusion Jenner writes: From the shape and situation of the Island, the phenomenon of a gradual receding of the boundary line between the two languages, so clearly to be seen in the case of Cornish, Welsh, or Scotch, is totally absent in Manx. One cannot speak of any district as the Manx speaking part of the Island, though it prevails in some districts more than others, and those furthest from the four towns of Douglas, Ramsey, Peel and Castletown have preserved more of it than the rest. Still there is but little difference on that account, since no place in the Island is more than ten or twelve miles at the most from one or other of these towns. On the whole the "Manxest" parts of the Isle are Dalby, a hamlet in the parish of Kirk Patrick, Cregneash and the neighbourhood of Spanish Head in Kirk [Christ] Rushen, the parish of Kirk Bride and the north part of Kirk Andreas, and the hill country at about the junction30 of the three parishes of Lezayre, Maughold and Lonan. If there ever comes to be such a thing as a single Manx district, it will probably be the west coast from Peel to Spanish Head. [..Jbut there is a decided feeling on the part of the people, especially the Manx speakers themselves, that the language is only an obstruction, and that the sooner it is removed the better (JENNER 1875:26-27). Rh^s, during his visits to Man 1886-1893, painted a similar picture, but added that he had only come into contact with one all-Manx speaking family in Cregneash, where the woman "was an octogenarian who had two sons living with her, together with a granddaughter in her teens. That girl was the only Manx speaking child that I recollect meeting with in the whole Island". He was also of the opinion that "in ten or fifteen years the speakers of Manx Gaelic may come to be counted on the fingers of one hand" (RHYS 1895:ix).31

3.1. Census enumerations The first census enumeration in Man taking into account the Manx language was that of 1901. Subsequent enumerations including this category were made in 1911, 1921, 1931, 1951, 1961, 1971. The 1981 census ignored the matter; by that time no native speakers of Manx existed (cf. below).

Comments 1. Hie number of 59 for the monoglols in the 1901 census, being made up of 57 males and 2 females, may represent some inconsistency on the part of the enumerator, as the censor for 1921 remarks (CENSUS 1921: xv), though the total figure in itself would not be out of proportion with the 190 recorded by Jenner only 27 years before. That Jenner and Rhys met with very few monoglots does not mean that they did not exist (cf. note 29). However, from the figures of 28 and 21 for monoglots in the age-groups 25-44 and 45-64 respectively, particularly for the former, one would have expected greater figures for this age range well into the 1920s and 1930s, if not later. The fact that such figures do not appear would indicate an exaggeration in the relevant 1901 figures, and perhaps we should read something between 7 and 3 for the two groups respectively. 2. The figure of 27 in 1901 for bilingual speakers for the age-groups 3-4, 5-9, 10-14 is suspect, given the fact that the ages of the last native speakers (cf. below) indicate a date of birth between 1860 and 1880, and should either be discounted or drastically reduced. The appearance of such doubtful figures in the 1901 census (and in 1911 for monoglots in the same age range) may be due to the revival in interest in the Manx language promoted by Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh 'The Manx Language Society', founded in 1899 on the model of Conradh na Gaeilge "The Gaelic League', set up in Ireland a short while before.32 3. The sharp decrease in the number of bilinguals between 1901 and 1921/31 would suggest that the language was not being passed on to the children, because the people were not speaking it anymore.33 As Jenner's comments show (cf. above) Manx lingered on in some areas more than in others, but seems to have passed on as a community language around the turn of the century. According to local knowledge Cregneash, probably because of its isolation, was the last bastion of Manx as a community language, passing from there around the time of the First World War. 4. In 1929 Marstrander could only find some 40 people with any Manx at all, though in an island of the size of Man, it would not be too difficult to miss out on potential informants.34 His comments in 1934 that "as far as I know, there is at present only one person left who could probably be described as a native

104

speaker [Harry Kelly, Gregneash (1853-1935)]", though some 3-4 others had good Manx and about 30 others smatterings (MARSTRANDER 1934:292; cf. also 1929/33:74-75) was quite inaccurate as shown by Charles W. Loch in 1946.35 In April of that year Loch visited Man and interviewed some twenty Manx language enthusiasts from whom he was able to produce a list of twenty persons who were regarded as native speakers, i.e. people whose first language was Manx, or who had acquired Manx in early childhood.36 This list was published by A.S.B. Davies in 1948 (DAVIES 1948:89-91). In 1950 this number had decreased to ten and by 1955 to seven (JACKSON 1955:2-3). By the time of the 1961 census only two known native speakers were still alive: Mrs Sage Kinvig, Ronague, Arbory (b.1870) and Ned Maddrell, Glen Chiass, Port St. Mary (b.1877). Mrs Kinvig died on 13 April 1962.37 5. Loch (1946:4) noted that in 1946 there were four classes held in various parts of Man for learners of Manx, which probably accounts for the figure of 355 (including the known native speakers) in the 1951 census. The same would apply to the figures for 1961 and 1971, i.e. that the adults had acquired it in classes (or from native speakers) in their adult life, and the children either from them or at school, where, depending on the availability of a competent teacher, they may learn Manx in some form or other. In any event English would be their first language. To my knowledge, there is no one in Man today (1990), or since 1972 for that matter (cf. note 32), who regularly uses Manx at home or at work, and in consequence no Manx speaking family at all exists at present in the Island. 4. Conclusion The decline and death of Manx could be summarized as follows: after the passing of Man into the English orbit in 1334, but especially after 1405, English began to establish itself as the language of administration and law, and of the towns, where it existed alongside Manx without displacing it. Because of the Island's isolation and because of the necessity of the few English settlers for their sustenance to cultivate the goodwill of the Manx

105

people, the small world in which Manx existed was thus protected. In line with the trend in Western IE languages from synthesis to analysis Manx progressed in that direction more so than her sister dialects in Ireland and Scotland probably due to the absence, almost certainly from the beginning of the Uth century at the latest, of a literary Gaelic tradition and standard. As we have seen, Manx lost the capacity, for example, to express the plural either due to apocope or to loss of the palatalization rule, resulting in phonemic indistinction, and resorted to morphological innovation for clarity (Sect. 1-3). Phonemic indistinction resulting from loss of palato-velar contrast also affected clarity in case marking (1.2.) which in turn, with the exception of some set adverbial phrases and compounds involving a verbal noun (1.4-7) and in survivals of attenuated plurals (2.2.3.), blurred the distinction in gender marking. (Sect. 1). Loss of allophonic variation manifested itself also in the loss of lenition and the collapse of the rules governing it (2.2.1.). It affected labial and velar spirants. One of the first casualties evidently were the velar spirants /χ/ (< /k/) and /γ/ (< /g, d/). The loss of initial /χ/, for instance, is recognized in Manx orthography even in the 18th century (1771) in the title of the Holy Bible itself: Yn Vible Casherick, where the initial c of casherick would represent /k/ and not the expected /χ/, written ch. The lack of recognition of /χ/ in the title of a book of this nature would suggest that even by that date (1771) the contrast /x/:/k/ (and probably /γ/: /g, d/) in initial position at any rate had largely disappeared. The protected world of Manx became more and more exposed to English from ca. 1700 onwards due to a changing set of circumstances brought on essentially by the "running trade". Participation in the "trade" led to Revestment leading in turn to an impoverishment in the Island which resulted in emigration of Manx-men (and others) in the latter part of the 18th century. Simultaneous immigration of English speakers ca. 1800-1820 and further emigration from the Manx heartland during the course of the 19th century began to tilt the balance (ca. 1840-1880) in favour of English.. The advent of and increase in tourism and a more organized system of education imported from England during those years hastened this trend, so that those born to Manx households ca.

106

1860-1880 became the last generation to receive Manx from the cradle. Tlie shift away from Manx towards English is reflected in the Manx-English contact situation in which the latter comes to have an increasing influence on Manx, e.g. substitution of English for native words (3.1.), adaptation of English syntax and caiques (3.3.), English suffixes on native words (3.4.), etc, mostly, it seems, during the course of the 19th century. Nevertheless, Manx had an enormous capacity to absorb foreign elements into its phonological and morphological systems (3.2. and THOMSON, this volume), and it was able to sustain an effective Abwehrkampf, in spite of heavy pressure from English, to the end. Even the numeric system of Manx, counting as it does by twenties: /[ta mi] k'e:9 fid as kweg d'eg sonan dunax/ '(I am) 95 on Sunday, lit. '...four twenties and fifteen...' (Ned Maddrell 18.08.1972, so far as is known the last academic interview before his death (27.12.1974)), unlike Scottish Gaelic, for example, where numbers are often given in English: Ί am 92 years of age' > /hami ninety two bl'iaNa 'yuLsV - is kept intact to the last. The passing of Manx as a community language took place ca.1870/80-1900/10, with the last native speakers living through the 1920s to the 1950s, decreasing in number gradually towards the end, and resulting in the d
