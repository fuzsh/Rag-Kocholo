BY HENRY SWAINSON COWPER, F.S.A., < /« ' Editor of \" The Oldest Register Rook of Hawkshcad. ' Xon&on : BEMROSE cS: SONS, LIMITED, 23, OLD BAILEY; AND DERBY. 1899. [ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.] 574971 TO THE MEMORY OF JAMES SWAINSON COWPKR-KSSEX, OF HAWKSHEAD, AND ACTON, MIDDLESEX, THIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED BY HIS GRANDSON, THE AUTHOR. TO THE READER. COURTEOUS READER, When you take up this volume you are asked to bear in mind that rural England is changing very fast ; that ever since the first steam locomotive started on its smoky journey, the doom of old fashions, old industries, and old ideas was sealed. How radical these changes have been, and how relentless is the impulse which is effacing the old world colouring of rural life, only those who care to hold back the falling curtain can really tell. These are the extenuating circumstances I dare to urge for writing a volume of 564 pages devoted to a single north country parish. For, though changes have come, and though signs arc not wanting that greater changes are at hand, Hawkshead is still a relic of the older England. It is like an ancient painting which the brush of the tasteless restorer has just touched. A little time and he will paint out the mellowed tints. But, meanwhile, let us replace it in its frame and hang it reverently against the wall. Making an afternoon call recently beyond the \"great pool \" of Windermere, my fair hostess courteously en- quired as to the progress of the present work. Ere I could reply, a lady guest (a woman, in the words of Mr. Punch, essentially of the nineteenth century) struck in, \" Hawkshead? What on earth can you find out to write viii TO THE READER. about Hawkshead, except that Wordsworth went to school there ? \" \" Oh,\" I replied meekly, \" there is really a lot. There are the old farms, and the dialect, and the superstitions. Then there's the way the people used to live - \" The way the people lived,\" quoth my fair critic, \" why I thought they lived like pigs.\" Thereupon I collapsed ; but now that time has somewhat effaced the memory of these indignities, I can only assure my readers that there is more to be learned about the parish than these two great facts, vh., that Wordsworth was schooled here, and that the people lived like pigs. And as the thought of these affronts to my parish has put me into greater heart, I will venture yet more, and assert that this book, big though it be, is incomplete. For, in truth, the subjects of some of my chapters, were they handled by one of better parts than, and of equal opportunities with, myself, might be expanded into little volumes themselves — and interesting volumes to boot. But to descend from fancies to facts. How can I essay to thank the band of friends and neighbours who, for over a dozen years, have helped me — ranging, as they do, from the Steward of the Manor, whose courtly copper- plate letter comes in answer to some worrying query, to the old fell shepherd, who greets me with \" I'se gitten a lile bit for ye, Mr. Harry.\" Yet, at any rate, some few obligations I can acknowledge To the kindness of Mr. T. Wilson, of Aynam Lodge, Kendal, I owe the use of the beautiful plate of Hawkshead Hall, originally engraved for Beck's great work. Mr. Herbert Bell, of Ambleside, most kindly gave me for reproduction the three excellent photo- graphs of Graythwaite Low Hall, being part of a large series TO THE READER. ix he has taken of local hall houses. I owe my thanks to the Councils of the Royal Archaeological Institute, and the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian Association, for the use of blocks made to illustrate papers of my own in their publications. My friend, Mr. VV. G. Collingwood, put at my disposal the interesting plan of Peel Island ; while Mr. C. J. Ferguson, F.S.A., and Mr. Daniel Gibson furnished me with the plans of the Church, and Satterhow. Canon Bower has allowed me a transfer from a lithograph of his drawing of the Sandys monument ; and Mr. C. F. Archibald and Mr. Edward Benson contributed photographs of Rusland Hall and the Great Yew. Last, but not least, the Governors of the Grammar School granted me \" free warren \" in the muniment chest, and lent me the ancient Charter for reproduction. But in particular must I say a word about the second map. In this I have essayed to show the face of the parish at the time when the old Northmen had finished their land taking. Of course, such a map must be but tentative, because, in fact, we know not at what date this same landtakc came to an end ; and because it is certain that long after it did, the speech of the dalesfolk must have remained highly Norse, so that farms, intakes, and woods would continue to be named in what was essentially a Scandinavian tongue ; though, probably, one which had become corrupt to the extent of having lost its gram- matical forms. Even in the last days of Monastic rule, we find the Dalesmen baptizing their farms \" ground,\" like the old Icelandic \"grund.\" The map, therefore, must be considered as showing the parish at a date before the Abbey influence had been felt ; x TO THE READER. say the beginning of the twelfth century. Yet, none-the- less, we have thought it best to give (as far as may be) the highly Norse names in their proper grammatical forms. Skelwith, for instance, may not have been so named until \" vidhr \" had become in Furness \" vith \" or \" with.\" But this we cannot now hope to learn. And, as a last word, let me thank the author of \" Thorstein of the Merc \" for the idea of this map— sug- gested as it was by the similar restorations in the romance. And yet more, for while in my map, as in Chapter VII., I am responsible for not a few guesses, yet I acknowledge with gratitude Mr. Collingwood's kind help and advice in the matter of grammatical forms, without which, indeed, this map would have been a wilder compila- tion than it now is.* H. S. COWPER. ll.tvksiifmi, June, 1899. * It has not been possible to place two ancient names, both with a very X<>rse sound, on this map.

The Monk Coniston and Grisedale Hall Estates were in the last century Ijoth in the possession of William Ford, of Monk Coniston. He had two daughters, (l) Catherine, who inherited Monk Coniston, and married George Knott ; and (2) Agnes, who inherited Ford Lodge, Grisedale, and married Henry Ainslie, M.I)., of Kendal and London. The Monk Coniston property was increased by the Knotts and sold to the Marshalls ; and Ford Lodge was abandoned as a residence by Montague Ainslie, son of Dr. Ainslie, when the new hall was built.

YOU, gentle reader, who no\\v perhaps take up this volume, be it either for amusement, for study, or for information, have before you, if through courtesy or interest in our subject you shall follow us to the end, a journey among the by-paths of antiquity, history, and half-forgotten country lore. Yet, although it will be our endeavour to make our excursions as fruitful of interest as we can, we shall in this our first chapter grant you a sort of holiday, in some sort a day or two of light work, before we must settle down in company to the task before us. In these first pages, then, we shall hope to be your guide to Hawkshcad as it is : to show you, in fact, the tract of fair country whose past is to be treated of in later chapters. We shall take you by the hand and bid you turn your gaze at the shining meres with their fair settings of hill and crag. You must toil with us up rocky roads, and force your way by our side through rustling coppice. In our company, you must clamber the rocky beds of rivulet and gill, and we must wander together o'er fell and dale, among the smiling hamlets, and through the quaint old- world town which gives its name to our ancient parish. Were it, then, that an interesting subject forms an interesting chapter, our success in this initial venture is assured ; but — like a lame horse — an ill-chosen companion, or, still worse, an inefficient guide, serves but too often to take away all the charm of a most pleasing excursion. We can, therefore, but 2 2 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. say, \" Reader, we know our theme and love it well. Bear but a little with us where we fail, encourage us if we please, and our best endeavour shall be to make our survey both instructive and enjoyable.\" Right at the northernmost point of Lancashire, blocked in on north-west and north by the barrier of fell which forms the well-known hills of the Lakes, lies the ancient water-girt Parish of Hawkshead. In Lancashire, yet cut apart, with the sister district of Cartmcl, from the rest of the county by the great estuary of Morecambc : in the Lake district, yet not of it; for, though we doubt not our confession will bring upon us the disapproval of some at least of our readers, we acknowledge that to us, the greatest charms of our district are, that it boasts not a tourist centre, that it practically knows not steam traffic, and that the few and scattered industries it maintains neither pollute the sweet air of its hills nor distort the fair landscape we love. The parish of Hawkshead, not the curtailed and dismembered parish of to-day, but the old parish as it existed in its ntirety — the Chapelry of Hawkshead, as it was called in the clays of Furness Abbey — measures in extreme length thirteen and a half miles from Klterwater Nab on the north to Legbarrow point on the south, where are joined the Crake and Leven rivers, the outlets respectively of Coniston Water and Windcrmere. The greatest width is from the (\"rake at Nibthwaitc to a point on Windcrmere nearly due east, where it is nearly five and a half miles, and the total acreage is computed at nearly 36,700 acres. * Let us take up the one-inch Ordnance map of Lancashire North of the Sands, and sec how the Chapelry lies. On the cast, that curving margin of Windermerc forms in its entire length, our boundary ; while on the west, the Chapelry ends on the wooded shores of Coniston. Yet no part of Windermerc, as we shall afterwards see, belongs to * According to the Ordnance Survey the old . parish of Hawksliead is 14,322 a. o r. 36/., and the old parish of Colton 22,330 a. o r. 35 p. e SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 3 Hawkshead, or even to Lancashire, while the boundary line dividing this part of the Abbey possessions from those of the Barony of Kendal was at an early date drawn along the east margin of Coniston or Thurston Water, so that the ancient Chapelry of Hawkshead docs not now, and never did, own, any part of the two beautiful lakes which close her in on east and west. On the north, the busy stream of the Brathay, gathering its waters from the high fells around the Wrynose Pass, forms not only the boundary of the parish from Pierce How to Windermcrc, but also that between Lancashire and her neighbour Westmorland. While on the north- west, the small tributary stream of Pierce How Beck, running through the picturesque slate quarry country, and the Ycwdale Beck, which empties itself into Coniston, make the frontier between the parish of Hawkshead and the Chapelry of Church Coniston or Coniston Fleming, and the rocky manor of Tilberthwaite. On the south-west, from the foot of Coniston, the river Crake divides us from Blawith, Lowick, Egton, all chapclries of the ancient parish of Ulvcrston. Of this fair river of Crake, we shall have more to say, but here where it runs out, it meets, between Greenodd and Legbarrow Point, its sister the Lcvcn, which, taking a south-west course from the foot of Windcrmere, forms the boundary between our ancient parish and that of Cartmel, which, with its neighbour Furness, constitutes Lancashire North of the Sands. So that, as we have said, our district is water girt, for it is closed in by three lakes, Windermere, Thurston Water, and Elterwater ; three rivers, the Brathay, the Crake, and the Leven ; and two streams, Yewdale and Pierce How Becks. Within these limits we find a country of a singularly broken-up and varied character ; for although the hills nowhere rise above a thousand feet, there is hardly a really level mile of road to be found.* On the north, the Berwick Fell * The modern road from Greenodd to Hollow Oak is no doubt far the levellest in the parish : but south of Brantwood a piece of road follows the margin for a short distance sufficiently close to make it moderately hill-less. 4 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. range, the fells about Tilberthwaite, and Claife heights stand out boldly, separated from each other and from the mightier hills of Westmorland by broad and cultivated valleys. But if we draw south by Dale Park, Grisedale, or Graythwaitc, the valleys contract and become, so to speak, a scries of gorges, through each of which rushes a beck, making its way to the Crake or the Lcvcn. Both in the north and south parts, the higher fells arc heather clad ; but while larch plantations arc fairly common in the Coniston and Ilawkshcad dislricts, in Colton, especially in the eastern part, and also in the Graythwaite and Grisedale districts, the count}- is still thickly covered with copse. The pre-Reformation Chapclry of Hawkshead became a parish in 1578, and in 1676 the lower half of it was cut off, and made into the independent parish of Colton. It was probably subsequent to this that each parish was divided into four quarters or townships, which were the recognised divisions until the Local Government Act, when lliL'se ancient boundaries were, in many cases, violated in the formation of the new civil parishes, for Parish Council purposes. Monk Coniston, for instance, was attached to Church Coniston, with which it had never before been associated ; the latter having been from early times a Chapclry of L'lvcrston, and part of a lay Manor, and never in any way connected with the Abbey estates. Obviously, then, we must in this chapter adhere to the older quarters or townships, which will be described in sequence. The quarters or townships of Hawkshead are : — 1. Hawkshead, which included Hawkshead Field and Fieldhead. 2. Monk Coniston and Skclwith. 3. Claife, including Colthouse and the Sawreys. 4. Sattcrthwaite, including Dale Park, Grisedale, and Graythwaite. And those of Colton : — 1. Colton East, or East side of Colton Beck. 2. Colton West, or West side of Colton Beck. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 5 3. Haverthwaite, Finsthwaite, and Rusland. 4. Nibthwaite, including parts of Bcthecar Moor. In describing the parish, however, we shall deviate slightly from the above order, for the purpose of taking them in geographical sequence. We shall take each quarter, begin- ning from the north-west. The order will thus become : — (i) Monk Coniston with Skelwith ; (2) Hawkshead ; (3) Claife ; (4) Satterthwaite ; (5) Nibthwaite ; (6) Colton West and Colton East ; (7) Haverthwaite, Finsthwaite, and Rusland. MONK CONISTON WITH SKKLWITII. Beautiful and interesting as are most of the other town- ships and hamlets of the old chapclry, there is no question that in this quarter we get the most romantic and pleasing scenery. Hence only do we obtain real glimpses of true Lake district scenery. Here on the heath-clad fellsides indeed, we seem to stand on the threshold of the grandest of all English scenery ; and although the black masses of Coniston Old Man and Wetherlam, the ragged peaks of Langdalc, and the sunny slopes of Hclvcllyn and Wansfell are all across the border, still they seem framed as a picture for Coniston and Skelwith folk to gaze at : in truth, there are few places where finer views of this part of the lakes can be got than from the slopes about Tarn Hows, Arnside or Skelwith Fold. In detailing the boundary of the chapclry itself we have already given that of the township on the west, north, and north-east. The inner boundary leaves the margin of Windermere on the south side of Pull Wyke and turning west, near Wray Castle, it crosses, by a fairly straight line, to Barngates Inn, called generally, but for what reason we hardly know, the \" Drunken Duck.\" Thence by the summit of Berwick Ground Fell to Arnside, where it turns south, and passing by Tarn Hows it reaches High Cross, where the Hawkshead-Coniston road is joined by one from Ambleside, whence it ascends the fell and passes 6 SUKVEY OF THE PARISH. along the watershed between Monk Coniston and Grisedale, until, after passing Lawson Park, a bend is made to the west, and it falls into Coniston at Beck Lcven, a short distance south of Brantwood. The township, therefore, forms a sort of elbow-shaped figure, or something like a joiner's square, and its area is greater than any of the other townships excepting that of Satterthwaitc, with which it is probably about equal.* Monk Coniston and Skehvith has three sub-divisions, two of which are given in the name of the quarter ; while the third, which boasts a modern church, is Brathay. Such sub-divisions would elsewhere be called hamlets — the proper name of the sub-divisions of a township, as we know by a statute of 1286. But in North Lancashire the term is but little used, and though we find in the prc-Rcformation documents many references to \" granges \" (farms of the abbey), villages, hamlets, and bailiwicks, the various terms seem hardly to have had any very definite signification ; and any arbitrary sub-division of the quarters (which themselves would appear in our chapelry to be of comparatively modern datej was probably never attempted, until regular surveys were undertaken in modern times. In the ensuing pages, therefore, we shall use \"hamlet\" simply to denote the numerous clusters of farms and cottages which form a con- spicuous feature in the district. Approaching the parish from Amblcsidc, after passing Clappersgate we cross the Brathay by a picturesque bridge and enter the township at the north-cast end of the elbow. This corner is called, from the river, Brathay, and is in itself somewhat featureless. Brathay Hall,! the property * The bovmdaries are taken chiefly from the Ordnance map, and as in many places they do not ever appear to have been defined, it is not easy to get at the tiue areas. It is doubtful if, when these townships were arranged, any attempt at actually defining boundaries was made ; probably they marched with the allotments of estates. If such a farm was placed in Monk Coniston, all its land — even its fell, \" park,\" or intake — was considered in Monk Coniston. When the commons were enclosed, the lines would become somewhat more definite. t Brathay Mall was built about the beginning of the present century by a Mr. Law, who lived in Old Braihay, or Brathay as it then was, the pleasant house at the foot of Brathay Bridge. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 7 of Dr. Hugh Redmayne, has a fine, bold situation on the lake ; but of late years so many modern villas have sprung up about the northern end of Windcrmere, even on its Hawkshead side, that the ancient character of the country is somewhat lost. This is especially noticeable about Brathay. Here stands a modern church built in the Italian style, forming, it is to be regretted, a very marked feature in the landscape, for, unfortunately, it is one totally out of character. \" Pull Barn,\" which occurs often in the parish register, has disappeared, lost perhaps in the out-buildings of the modern house called Wykcfield, which boldly overlooks the road near Pull Wyke, and which is now leased by, and was until recently inhabited by, Sir William Forwood. Opposite Wj kefield, beyond the bay, in lovely woods, lies another and more considerable modern residence called Pull Woods, only recently erected by W. J. Crosslcy, Esquire. This is a fine building of the half-timber style so markedly developed in South Lancashire and Cheshire — a style exceedingly picturesque — but one which naturally never obtained a hold in the Lake district, where timber was not too common, and magnificent building stone abundant.* Formerly, we are told in Clarke's \" Survey of the Lakes,\" there stood at Pull a little inn, the sign of which having become defaced, some waggish bard had inscribed beneath — \" What this sign is, none can tell ; But here's good beer and ale to sell.\" No inn exists here now, but we believe that the position of this was somewhere at the head of Pull Wykc, close to where the roads from Coniston and Hawkshead meet. A little west from here lies the old estate of the family of Bensons, who were the leading family of 'statesmen in this township, and played some part in local history, both in Hawkshead Parish and in the neighbouring county of Westmorland, where they also owned estates. Skelwith Fold passed out of their hands at the early part of the * To the subject of local domestic architecture we shall revert when describing Wray Castle, and of houses in the timber and plaster style when treating of Sawrey. 8 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. present century, and has lately been acquired by Mr. Stephen Marshall, from whose new residence, situated a little cast of the old house, the most marvellous views are to be had. Old Skclwith Fold house still stands, a typical 'statesman's house of the better class, snug and sheltered, with a plain, unpretending rough-cast front and round chimneys. Inside it is cut up into cottages, but some plain old oak-panelling remains on the stairs and in one of the bedrooms. The initials and dates, T ^ 1745, OLD SKP.I.WITII KOI. n. and i. E. H., 1805, are the last surviving memorials of the ancient local family. All, or nearly all, Skelwith was in former days in the hands of small local proprietors — 'statesmen, as they are termed here in the North. Indeed, as we shall see, the only quarters in which squirarchal families existed were those of Hawkshcad, Satterthwaite, and in the lower part of the chapclry which became Colton. In Skelwith, as late as 1723, it would seem that there were nearly thirty landowners, for a deed of that date belonging to Mr, SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 9 Marshall, enumerates properties in the \"ownership or possession\" of the following individuals : — John Hodgson, John Walker, George Holm, William Brathwayte, William Walker, Joseph Cumpstone, John Dixon, William Cowherd, William Holm, John Robinson, Richard Atkinson, Margaret Atkinson, James Jackson, Mary Holm, William Mackereth, Anthony Hall, Jane Mackereth, William Mackereth, Daniell Birkett, William Benson, George Cumpstone, Robert Benson, Thomas Brathwayte, James Cookson, .... Dummcr, John Benson, Edward Park, Launcelot Dobson, and Gawen Brathwayte. Below Skelwith Fold, on the Westmorland side of the Brathay, nestles the snug little hamlet of Skelwith Bridge, with a pretty roadside inn. This bridge was washed away in 1890 by a tremendous spate, following one of those thunderstorms which, accompanied by a tropical downpour, occasionally visit the Lakes. A little cast of Skelwith Bridge, the Brathay forms a pretty force or waterfall, and above this, its course, after traversing a spongy level from Elterwater, contracts into a narrow rocky ravine. This ravine in flood times, was insufficient to carry off quickly the superfluous water, so that being dammed here, as it were, the level behind was liable to flooding, and consequent destruction of crops : on this account, at some date, the rocky bed has been quarried, blasted, and widened, with excellent results as regards the meadows above. At one place where a rock}' \" rig \" projected into the stream a smaller channel has been cut behind it, thus forming a sort of small fortress-like crag artificially separated from the rest of 'the bank. The place is rather a trap for the antiquary, who, noticing the artificial ditch cut behind it, might easily formulate most interesting theories, attributing to it an origin far remote both in date and object from its true one. Elterwater now lies before us, and the nab or point projecting across it from the south is at once the northern- most point of our parish and county. The tarn, or \" water,\" is somewhat featureless, and looks far better from 10 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. some of the fell points above it than from its margin. Probably the prettiest picture is that seen from the neigh- bourhood of High Close on the Westmorland side, whence the view is closed by a grand panoramic view of the Coniston Fells. Here, about Col with and Elterwater, where the noble valleys of Great and Little Langdalc open out to meet the Inn-ness hills, \\vc have features plenty to charm alike the artist, tourist, antiquary, and student of place names. If we clamber over the ling-clad fcllsidcs that rise on the south of the Hrathay, at every turn the splendid panorama of shadowed hill, green plain, and winding river changes and varies both in contour and colouring as we pass. Up the hill from CoKvith drifts with the brccxc the ceaseless song of the force, for the Hrathay, in her long descent from \\Vrynose, has many a trip and stumble before she leaps joyously into the \"great pool\" of Windcrmcrc. We say \" she.\" for rivers are, by the courtesy of poets, fair maidens ; but Hrathay, fair as she is, is no wild school lass, for \" she goes on for ever.\" Many a talc is she telling now, in her rippling tones, could we but understand, of the steel-clad veterans of Rome, of the herds 01 Celtic oxen, of the great lumbering commissariat wagons, and of the groups of British camp followers, apeing, perhaps, the manners of their con- querors, but more than half savage, who toiled along her banks in the olden days, on the road from the Roman camp at Waterhcad to the fort which lay in the pass at Hardknott. Stories can she tell us, too, of later days, when the long- limbed \" sons of the bay,\" brown from exposure, and with the brine of the northern waves still clinging to their curling hair and beards, first forced their way through the tangled scrub and forest of Yewdale, and with their crescent-bladcd axes formed the clearings or thwaitcs for their homesteads, and so drave into the ground, as it were, such landmarks of nomenclature as we find in Tilberthwaite and Arnside. Whoever Ami was, however, we must leave to another page, but while here we should climb to his old dwelling, SURVEY OF THE PARISH. n were it only for the view. There are now two Arnsides— High and Low — veritable hill farms, planted high on the fell, and round them heather and rock and larch plantation — nothing else, except the few green fields laid under cultiva- tion, no doubt a thousand years back, by Arni himself. At one of the farms lives Mr. Gillbanks, the owner, the repre- sentative of an old land-owning family at Wythburn, but who settled here after his own vale had been invaded to quench the thirst of Manchester. Mr. Gillbanks' home is a veritable museum, and to his courtesy we owe more than one pleasant visit to inspect his ancient oaken furniture, china, and other heirlooms. Above us rise the heath-clad points and rocks of Black- fell, Berwick Ground Fell, and Ironkelcl, different parts of the same rough range of hill, a haunt and breeding-ground of wild duck and black game. Ironkelcl is, we think, Ami's kcld, and here no doubt the old Norse farmer found a spring and named it. On one of these allotments is a quarry, one of the oldest, perhaps, in the parish, where tradition says in the old days the immensely thick roofing slate still remaining on our old farm buildings was originally obtained. From the highest points we have perhaps the most extensive views that can be got from a similar eleva- tion in the district. Esthwaite, Windermcre, Coniston, and the Langdales are all before us. Unfortunately, the young larch plantations near the summits are so thickly grown that we have to fight our way through them, with hats pulled over our faces and eyes closed against the sharp spikes of the branches. We have now no time to visit the farms of Park — High Park and Low Park — the names of which tell us of monastic rule, for we must cross the road near haunted Oxcnfcll Cross, close to where Guards Beck, the eastern tributary of Ycwdale Beck, takes its rise. In front of us is Holme Fell, with the farms of Holme Ground and Hodgcclosc ; and the enormous and unsightly masses of tipped rubbish show us that we have arrived at the headquarters of the only I2 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. industry left in the northern part of the ancient chapelry. The quarries are on both the Coniston and Hawkshcad sides of the boundaries, although the splendid stone obtained here is generally called \"Coniston green slate.\" If we follow down the Tierce How Beck towards Stang End, where it enters the Brathay, we find a wood between the road and beck, bearing the curious name of \" Sepulchre \" (with the accent on the \" u,\" if you please). Close to the road, within the wood, we have traced the foundations of a ruined square building seemingly of some antiquity. This building, no doubt, is connected in some way with the strange name of the place ; but what its origin has been we do not know. Possibly, but we think hardly probably, a Roman building stood here, and a tomb of the same date may have been found, and given the name. Stang End was, however, the home of more Bcnsons, ardent Quakers, and, as Quaker burial grounds are in these parts generally known as \" sepulchres,\" the question arises if ever there was one here.' But there exists neither record nor tradition of any- thing of the sort. Just over the Brathay, at Birk How, there is a place called Chapel Mire, and the local story is that a chapel stood here, and its burial ground was at the \" Sepulchre.\" But it seems unlikely, as the two places arc some distance apart, divided by a river, and even in different counties. Tilbcrthwaitc, its gill and waterfalls and its old copper workings, we must pass by, for it is over the beck in Church Coniston. Holme Ground Fell ends in bold crags dominating Yewdale, and parting the streams called Ycwdalc Beck and Guards Heck. At its foot lie two farms : High Yewdale, which is in Church Coniston, a typical dalchcad house, with large barns, and a row of quaintly clipped yews in a line with the front. Yew Tree Farm, close by, is on the Hawkshead side, and till a few years ago was often visited on account * Mr. C. \\V. Dymond, F.S.A., who is well acquainted with the history of local Jriemls, assures me there was never a Friends' burial ground here: but meetings were held, and Quakers might, and perhaps did, bury wherever they liked. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 13 of the wonderful old yew tree standing in a field behind it. This tree is shown in Crosthwaite's map of Coniston, pub- lished over a hundred years since, with a note saying that its diameter was then nine feet. When we measured it some years ago we found it about the same, although, of course, a knotted and gnarled trunk will show considerable variations in diameter according to the point where this is measured. It was, however, a mere shell, up the inside of which it was possible to climb, and it was evident that at \"HOW ARE THE MlGHTY FALLEN.\" some period the top had been lost. In the great gale of 22nd December, 1894, he fell, and then it became evident that not only had his branches dwindled from great age, but his roots also, so that but little was left except his great gnarled trunk. Mr. Marshall, the owner, was approached with the view of getting the old landmark hoisted on end, for it was thought that if fixed with strong tackle he might stand, though dead, for years. The idea, however, was not carried out, and this unique relic of our old forest lies in the field slowly decaying. ,4 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. Traditionally, and perhaps probably, Yewdale is named after the yew, or after him and dead companions. In his full vigour, when his great branches spread far and wide over the turf, and before his great gnarled trunk was much decayed, the Great Yew of Yewdale must have been a magnificent specimen. Yet we must not think of him as standing here when the Romans cleared their Langdale Road, or even in the days of the Norse occupation. His age is computed by one of our best authorities at about seven hundred years, so that he may have just been a stripling when the thirty sworn men marched up Yew- dale delimiting the frontier of Furncss Fells in the twelfth century.* Yet he is venerable enough to have seen a good deal. Perhaps under his shadow the hunted Quakers met ; and many rustic lovers must have sat and sighed beneath his branches. Poor old yew of Yewdale, you are gone '. What tales could you tell us could you speak ! Tales of storm and strife, of love and death, of feudal slavery and peaceful shepherd life. Strange to say, the small farm adjoining called Penny House, from a family of Pcnnys which once resided there, took fire not long after the fall of the yew, and was burned to a shell. Close by stands Yew Tree Farm, where, in the barn adjoining, may be seen one of the few examples of that open timber and plaster work which is practically unknown in this part of Lancashire. Only a small portion of the wall is so constructed, and is of interest only as a curiosity. The farm itself is a good example of the sort, but evidently built at two periods, the back part being the older, of the usual plain type, with round chimney and rustic porch. This was probably built in the seventeenth century, for it contains a large oaken fixed cupboard of the * Dr. J. Lowe, the author of \" Yew Trees in Great Britain \" (1897), to whom the present writer forwarded a good photograph of the fallen tree, sent in reply an interest- ing letter in which he estimates the probable age at about seven hundred years. He points out that when the tree lost its top a rapid increase of the trunk would follow through coalescence of adventitious stems, and that this welding is shown in the corru- gated and fluted appearance of our yew. Decay sets in in the central roots of the yew tree generally after two hundred years, so that the hollowness of a large tree like this is not evidence of very vast antiquity if the tree, like this one, is living ; and yew trees continue their growth alongside this decay.

The latter initials, with some of the carving, is probably a later addition, and we believe G. W. stands for George Walker, of Yew Tree, whose will was proved in 1695. The front part of the farm is an addition of the eighteenth century, and an old lock on the door appears to read, as well as we can make out W through coats of paint, G A '743- The charms of Yewdale, from here to the head of the YEW TREK FARM. lake, are not easy to describe ; nor can we dwell at length upon them here. The beautiful stream which divides the valley, and so gives half Ycwdale to Church Coniston and half to Monk Coniston, is made the scene of a romantic tale by Dr. Gibson, which, though professedly of local origin, is evidently in great part the writer's own.* High above it, on * See A. C Gibson's \" The Old Man,\" 1849, p. 126-7. The tale of Lady Eva and the Giant Willie of the Tarns. It is now almost impossible to say whether the story is altogether invention, or whether Ginson found some slight tradition. \"Great Willie\" was probably suggested by the Willie waterfall on ihe lieck running from Tarn Hows. The present author failed to identify the giant's grave as pointed out by A. C. Gibson, 1 6 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. the west tower are the massive crags of Yewdale Fells, broken and black, scored with milky gills, and tufted here and there with stunted trees. From overhead, in mid air, comes the raven's croak, as with extended sable wings he soars in widening circles. To him belongs to-day the sovereignty of these dark crags, for his noble kinsman, the eagle, who nested here, has gone, driven to wilder climes by the march of civili- sation. \\Ve must turn aside and climb by Tarn Gill, where, in the road, can be noticed masses of iron slag, the scoria; of an ancient smclting-hcarth, till we reach Tarn Hows, beloved, and rightly so, by skaters in winter and picnic parties in summer. Here comes every day in the season at least one char-a-banc load of sightseers from Amblcside or Windermere, for Tarn I lows is a show-place — perhaps the most visited corner in all our chapelry, if we except a point or two on Windermere. \" The Tarns,\" for they are thus always spoken of in the plural, formerly consisted of three small sheets of water : but some years ago the proprietor, Mr. Marshall, raised the level, and converted them into one, adding thus most materially to the great charms with which nature had lavishly endowed the place. Though we have travelled somewhat widely in Europe, Asia, and Africa, we can recall no place with so many varied beauties of colour and contour as this delightful spot, within ten minutes' walk of our own home. We know every inch of the ground, every changing view, every storm-cloud, and burst of sunlight. Yet we have never tired of it, and never shall. If we climb the hill side above the southern end on an autumn morning, what do we sec ? There is a winding sheet of water of no great length, whose shore line is marked with tiny promontories and bays. On each side the shores rise fairly steeply, here covered with autumn heather and golden bracken, there hidden in dark plantations of spruce and larch. A simple, charming scene, we hear the reader say, but what more? Well, there is plenty more, but how SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 17 to tell it ? Somehow or another, this autumn morning, when all tourists are back at their homes, we can imagine here in a way we cannot anywhere else. Here we might be anywhere. In fact, if we were to knock down the one or two walls we see, we might be the only human denizens of God's earth — a very pleasing idea to one of our romantic and misanthropic turn of mind, though possibly a condition which we should not like if it were really the case. This is one of the charms of Tarn Plows — its seeming distance from civilization. It is not a simple basin of water set in a desert of crag, like some of our lakeland tarns, very grand and wild, but somehow a form of scenery which seems to give some folks (not ourselves, dear reader) a cold chill up the spine, so that with buttoned coats the}' rush back to their inn to order tea. It is the marvellous variety of this scene which is so delightful, for beyond this foreground of lakelet and heather rises that panorama we have already seen from Arnside. But here with our foreground the colouring is a marvel. The lake is blue, the banks brown, red, and black, the bracken gold. Behind, through a gray mist rising from Yewdale, lies the purple mass of Wetherlam, damascened in silver, the jagged lines of unmeltcd snow left by the first October snowstorm, white locks, as it were, on her hoary brow. * We now come down to the head of Collision or Thurston Waler, which is parlly enclosed wilhin Ihe boundaries of this township. Here aboul the watcrhead we arc, as at Brathay, again in ihc nineteenth century, for villas and gentlemen's houses cluster thickly. First we have embosomed in beautiful woods Waterhead House, or Monk Collision 1 1 all as il is somelimes called, boughl in the last century by the family of Knotl, and afterwards purchased by James Garth Marshall, Esq., M.P. for Leeds, from whom it has descended to its present owner. The house is a sort of modern Gothic in style, but it is said that some of the old rooms behind * The reader will find this place called in numerous guide-books Tarn haws or Tarnhiuse, inite.id of Tarn Hows or The Tarns. The latler are correct, but we must leave the discussion on this subject to a later chapter. ,8 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. formed part of a house occupied in the days of the Abbey by a monk in residence. A local tradition however, narrated by Mr. A. Craig Gibson, makes Bank Ground on the east margin of the lake the home of a certain monk, \" Father Brian,\" but we have no further confirmation of this. At the foot of the park, behind where the letter-box now stands, and right at the Watcrhcad, stood the old inn, now destroyed, having been replaced in 1849 by the roomy modern establishment nearer the mouth of Ycwdale beck. This older inn was not, we believe, very ancient, as it was called New Inn to distinguish it from a house in the village. We do not know that any representations of it exist, for certain old engravings of buildings at Watcrhcad manifestly represent the old farm of Boon Crag nearer to the present Monk Coniston House. The inn probably only dated from the end of last century, when the earliest tourists began to haunt the district. The oilier houses about the lake head need not detain us long here. The Thwaitc, an unpretending but not unpicturcsquc residence, occupies a commanding position behind the Walcrhcad Hotel, and was built about 1821. Tent Lodge, built by the father of the young linguist, Elizabeth Smith, has but little to commend itself in archi- tecture, for it is built in a sort of Italian style. Tent Cottage, on the road beside it, was originally called Townson Ground, and was Elizabeth Smith's home. Close by is Lane Head, built in 1848, at which time a curious little one- storied public-house was destroyed. This was commonly called \"T'hopenny yall 'us \"—the half-penny ale-house — from its exceptionally cheap tariff for refreshments. A little further south is Coniston Bank, and then comes Brantwood, built about one hundred years ago, and tenanted by not a few talented occupiers, before it was purchased in 1871 by its present distinguished owner, Professor John Ruskin.* • The Author is indebted to the pleasant anil instructive \" Guide to Coniston \"by his friend, Mr. W. G. Collingwood, for not a little information concerning the history of this coiner of the parish ; and to this little work lie would refer his reader for many details. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 19 Leave we the valley and its houses, and pass to the fellside above. The Old Man faces us, the grim sentry of the Lakeland hills to the south. Below nestles Church Coniston and its village, and among the trees stand out the great round chimneys of Coniston Hall, the old home of the knights and squires Fleming and le-Fleming, from whom their manor was sometimes called Coniston Fleming. Here we are at the end of the township, for the boundary dividing it from Hawkshead and Sattcrthwaitc sweeps along the crest of this brown moor on which we stand. Lawson Park is our southernmost house, a solitude of solitudes, once a grange of the rich Abbey of Furncss, now an isolated fellside sheep farm. :;: HAWKSHEAD AND FIELDHEAD. This quarter, or township, is the central one of the parish as it existed subsequent to the separation of Colton. It was, properly speaking, all one quarter, although it embraced two sub-divisions. One was Hawkshead Field, which took its name from the old common field of the early inhabitants, which extended from the town to Esthwaite Lodge, I on the western bank of Esthwaite ; the other was called Fieldhead, and occupied the northern half of the quarter, from the Hawkshead Hall estate up to the boundary of Skelwith. The northern and western sides of the whole township have been described in the boundaries of Skelwith and Monk Coniston. The southern line leaves the top of Monk Coniston Moor, and, crossing the head of the Grisedalc valley, takes a south-easterly course over the fell, passing a little north of Grisedalc tarn, and, traversing the northern part of Dalepark, falls into Cunsey beck, near Eel House, from which point to Windermere the beck divides Claife from Sattcrthwaite. * Lawson Park is included in Monk Coniston and Skelwith on the Ordnance Survey, but it may be doubted if this is correct, because the farm was given as an endow- ment to the chapelry of Satterthwaite about 1677 (see Appendix under Charities). It remained a glebe until 1897, when it was purchased by Mr. A. Severn, of Brantwood. The old spelling and modern vernacular pronunciation is Lowson Park. t In former times called New House in Hawkshead Field. 20 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. The eastern boundary, which divides Hawkshead quarter from Claifc, leaves Cunscy beck at Eel House, and ascends by Out Dubs to Ksthwaite Water. From the head of the lake it follows for a short distance the Hall beck, and then diverging passes cast of Hawkshead Hall and Bclmount, and, leaving Outgate on the left, joins the beck which runs into Blclham Tarn. From the north-cast end of IMclham it skirts by Wray Castle, which is in Claifc, and joins the Skclwith boundary a short distance from Windermcre. All the parish east of this line formed the Claife quarter. The Hawkshead and Ficldhcad quarter is of paramount interest, as containing the ancient town and church which gave the whole chapelry its name. Yet, although its scenery is beautiful in a simple sylvan way, it can claim nothing like the grandeur of the quarter we have already described ; nor can it boast the splendid combinations of hill and lake scenery which may be found in all the other quarters, and in Colton as well. Yet its charms are great, and are peculiar to itself. It has its savour of antiquity and history — its ancient town, with its nooks and corners, its grey old church, and ivy-covered manor-house. Geographically, the leading feature here, and, no doubt, that which led to the early colonization of the place, is a sort of gap in the fells — for it can hardly be accurately termed a plain — which must at an early date have attracted settlers by the facilities which it offered for cultivation, superior as it was to the rougher fells lying north, south, and cast. This question of the early settlement of our chapelry will be hereafter fully discussed, but it may well be pointed out here how an industrious race of new-comers would naturally select the head of Ksthwaite for a clearing. The slopes round Hawks- head would be, we think, once cleared, both dry and good for primitive cultivation, while the fells which rose around were well adapted for pasturage, and would afford excellent sport. Nowhere else within the limits of the chapelry were equal advantages to be found, for Rusland and Haverthwaite, although they possessed some of these features, were probably choked with bog and morass till a later date. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 21 The northern half of the quarter is in aspect somewhat featureless. The ground descends in easy stages from Borwick Ground Fell and the hills about the tarns, and from Hawkshead Hall parks and the lower elevations behind Outgate, to Hawks- head Hall, half-way between which and Esthwaite Lake the Hall beck joins another flowing from near Outgate, and these together form the principal feeder of the lake. This division of the quarter contains beside the ancient manor-house four scattered hamlets, several private residences, and various fell-side farms. The principal hamlet is Outgate, a snug little place of some eight or nine houses, situated on the direct road from Amblcsidc to Hawkshead. Some say that it is so named because, in proceeding from Hawkshead to Ambleside, the cultivated land was here left, and the commons of Claifc reached ; but this appears doubtful, as the high road does not enter Claifc at all, but proceeds more or less parallel with it. More probably Outgate marks the place where enclosed fields joined the common in early times. The other hamlets are Fieldhcad, Borwick Ground, and Hawkshead Hill, the last of which is on the road from Coniston, and boasts an ancient Baptist Chapel built in 1678, and probably formed out of an ancient cottage. In 1876 this was restored, or rather rcfrontcd, in a style which, although without pretensions, does not accord particularly well with the old architecture of the district. The principal modern residences are Bclmount, built in 1774 by Mr. Reginald Braithwaite, a Vicar of Ilawkshcad. It occupies the site, we believe, of an old tenement called Rawes Ground, and has a very pleasing situation between Outgate and Hawkshead Hall, overlooking the Ksthwaite valley. The house is a square block similar to Brathay, a style that had really survived from the Jacobean period. Though by no means beautiful, it is no eyesore in the landscape, for its tints are mellowed by time, and fine old trees have sprung up around it. Behind the house we find a leaden water-cistern stamped with the initials of the first proprietor, and the date of erection R_B'1, 1774. and 22 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. also the crest of the Braithwaites of Ambleside, a grey- hound couchant collared and stringed. Belmount was at a later date acquired by Dr. Whittaker, Vicar of Blackburn, who had here a considerable library, which was dispersed in 1887. It still belongs to his representatives. Ficldhcad House and Berwick Lodge are pretty but unpretentious residences. The old name of the last is Borwick Ground, from a 'statesman family who had lived there for many generations. On the summit of the hill above stands our own home, called in the seventeenth century High House. At a later date it was known as the Castle, but when the old building was pulled down in 1859 by J. Swainson Cowpcr-Esscx, the author's grandfather, he named the new house Ycwficld, whence has risen the present awkward name of Ycwficld Castle. The house was considerably added to, in 1883, by its present owner. High House, the original farm, was owned till about 1697 by the Sawrcys of Sawrcy Ground, a family of 'statesmen, from whom it descended by a female heir to the Swainsons, in whose hands it remained until about 1805, when it passed in the same manner to our own family. On the road from Hawkshead Hill to Ilawkshcacl Hall stands the modern house called Highficld, built also by J. S. Cowpcr-Essex, and now occupied by Mr. Win. Hopes 1 1 eel is. Hawkshead Hall, however, is by far the most interesting feature in this part of the township, for it is the ancient Manorial House of the Abbey, and its old Court House, with work of the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, often forms a subject for the artist's sketch-book or the camera. In this chapter we shall not go into the question of its history or its architecture, for these both find their place elsewhere, but we will content ourselves with calling the reader's attention to the old Gatehouse, the traceried window of which lights the ancient Courtroom of the Manor. This room was used for services when the parish church was being restored. The small rough cast building is part of the old residence, but the large parlour or hall, which formerly SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 23 joined it to the Gatehouse, was pulled down by the author's grandfather, who built the new farm behind. * The old rookery standing by the ancient corn mill of the Manor suffered terribly in the great storm of 1894. On a tract of moorland belonging to this estate, which is still called Hawkshead Hall Parks, an ancient burial cairn exists, which was ' excavated by the present writer some years since, with not uninteresting results. Near this runs in a deep ravine a beck, and this was formerly dammed to feed a bobbin mill at Thursgill, below Hawkshead Hill. Years ago, however, the dam burst, flooding the gill below, and causing considerable destruction, and as the dam was never repaired the bobbin in- dustry here came to an end. The mill still stands, however, a most picturesque building, placed at the head of a singularly deep and romantic ravine, bearing the curious name of Thursgill. This extraordinary spot is little known, for the drop is so abrupt, that from a short distance there is but little indication that a ravine exists at all. Thursgill occurs, in the parish register, as the scene of a drowning case, but the entry does not tell us the cause of the occurrence. The interest of the lower half of the quarter — the districts of Hawkshead and Hawkshead Field Head — is confined chiefly to the low ground about the town, and the peaceful scenery bordering on the Esthwaite lake ; for the remaining part consists cither of breezy but featureless moor, or tangled coppice woods. Hawkshead, as we have said, is not a tourist centre, and is little known to visitors to the district, except on account of its connection with the poet Wordsworth. Yet, as we shall see, it played its part in the history of Lancashire North * Guide-books are notoriously inaccurate, and we are not surprised at ihe queer statements many contain about Hawksliead Hall. Thus, it has often been called a chapel, which of course it is not. And but a few days ago we found it stated in a new edition of Hlack's Guide that Archbishop Sandys was born here. lie was, however, born at Esthwaite Hall. The author of \"Literary Associations of the English Lakes \" makes the same mistake, and in another passage he accurately describes the position of Hawkshead Hall, but calls it Esthwaite Hall. A worse error, orginated in the last century, is that of writing Coniston instead of Conishead Priory. This has been perpetuated by almost every writer since, including some of the most distinguished Cumberland antiquaries. It is needless to say here, that there never was a Priory at Coniston. 24 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. of the Sands, and at the present day has manifold points of interest for the antiquary, the historian, or the artist. The Hawkshcad and Grisedale moors, shelving off north- east towards the valley, end in two remarkable green round hills. Geologically these are moraine matter ; and arc named respectively Kcenground High, and Charity High, the latter name originating with the property having been purchased by the Trustees of the Grammar School with moneys left as a charitable bequest. Near the base of these hills, and sheltered by them from the south-westerly gales, lies our little market town, a compact cluster of rough cast houses, its old-world aspect broken only by a huge and unsightly modern police station, a modern post office, and a village institute, each of which edifices have, it is to be regretted, been built of late years, in a style the glaring incongruity of which, in this quaint old town, is painfully evident. If we except these buildings we find ourselves, on enter- ing Hawkshead, in a town the appearance of which has probably changed as little or less than any other in North Lancashire during the last two centuries. It is true that among the houses a few date from a later period, as docs also the Town Hall, which was built at the end of last century, and has been subsequently enlarged. But, most wisely, these buildings have been rough-cast with lime in the old style, so that their appearance is well in accord with the older buildings, from which they are not indeed easy to distinguish. Yet, although there arc but few poor in Hawkshead, the town has practically remained perfectly stationary in si/.e, a state of things due entirely to the extinction of the wool market, owing to the introduction of machinery. Hawkshead may be said to be composed of two streets, three squares, and numerous yards, alleys, or courts, term them which you will, which lead out of the squares and main thoroughfares. It has its fair share of inns, for they number five, and all of these are well managed and SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 27 comfortable, if old-fashioned establishments. Some of these inns, as the Red Lion and the Brown Cow, have their yards behind — quaint old-world places, full of nooks and corners, and overlooked by low, long windows, which, though they light but ill the little parlours they open from, have, we doubt not, afforded the occupants the sight of many a busy group during the market and fair days in the times gone by. Sleepy though they be, these yards are yet full of life, the old cobble paving still remains, and children in clogs still clatter through them ; and clog clatter, though perhaps unmusical to the Southern, is pleasant enough to the Northern ear, and at Hawkshcad it savours, like all else, of the past. Some of the old squares and streets and even the corners have names, some no doubt old, others given by the inhabitants in a sort of spirit of chaff. Entering the town from the north, we pass first on the left the hideous police station, and then reach the principal inn, the Red Lion, a very old building, although it has been refronted in comparatively recent times. Nearly opposite a narrow lane leads to the right, still cobble paved, and having a few shops.. This is Anne Street, but why so named we do not know.* After this is one of the principal open spaces, not properly a square, and in this case nameless. From this we pass beneath an arch, or, speaking more accurately, through a passage over which has been built a room, into the Market Square, which is of considerable size, with the Town Hall upon its southern side. At the northern corner, at the end of the King's Arms Inn, is another small square, sometimes called Berkeley Square, from which we can pass by a narrow picturesque corner and under another building to the top of Anne Street, and so into Vicarage Lane, where is situated the picturesque cottage called Grandy Nook, once Wordsworth's lodgings, and now a place of pilgrimage to most visitors to Hawkshead. * Probably a modern name, from Wordsworth's lodging-house dame, Ann Tyson, and coined by the townsfolk for the benefit of tourists. 28 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. Returning to Berkeley Square we may visit Flag Street, which till May, 1894, was perhaps the most picturesque corner in the town. Flag Street is an alley running down parallel with Vicarage Lane, and built most strangely on the line of a beck. Until the date above mentioned this beck was only covered with large flags, in some places entirely span- ning it, but elsewhere carried only along one side, so that walking up the street the running water could be seen through the gaps in the flags. Where the street opened into the square the beck was left open, a sort of pool where the townspeople from time immemorial drew water for various household purposes. Of course such an arrangement was not specially sanitary, but it was highly picturesque, and it was, indeed, one of the most attractive places in the town, so that in the summer photographers and artists were often busy at Flag Street. It had its purposes, too, for in heavy rains, when a great spate would come from the moor, the hole at the foot of the street was a safety-valve by which the flood-water could escape without fear of Flag Street being flooded. Yet, in spite of the charm and even utility of the place, the local Highway Hoard in 1892 took measures to have the hole closed as dangerous and unsanitary. At the time, however, so much local irritation was caused among the townspeople that the improvement was dropped. Two years later, however, the owners of the houses on either side closed in the hole and even covered in a great portion of the beck, so that Flag Street exists no longer.* It is needless to say that on more than one occasion our pro- phecy of the flooding of Flag Street has been verified,! and that one of the most charming corners of Hawkshead has lost its attractions. • Flag Street is also supposed to be alluded to by Wordsworth in the \" Prelude,\" but it is hardly a matter of certainty. At the lime of the closing the writer was absent, or he would certainly have again protested against the proceeding. The water was, of course, polluted, but was never used for other than washing purposes, and no record exists of any accident in the hole, which was reported dangerous. t On June 23, 1898 — when the houses on each side were flooded about eighteen inches deep, the road made on the lid-flags washed clean away, and the square at the bottom washed to bits ; and again in the November flood of 1898. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 29 The next turning up from the Market Square leads to a pretty corner where water comes gushing out of a wall into a tank. This is the \" town spout,\" the water-supply for the whole town in old days. It is unused now, but the place is a pretty subject for the pencil. On the south side of the Market Square is the Town Hall, built in 1790, on the site of an older Market House, and considerably enlarged in 1887, in commemoration of the first Jubilee.* The characteristic features of the little town may be said to be the overhanging stories, which remain in many of the older houses, the passages under buildings, the numerous sharp turns and corners, and the rough-cast walls. Yet antique in appearance as it still is, the town has altered much in modern times. Formerly the vicarage beck, which passes under Flag Street, traversed the Market Square uncovered, but spanned here and there by foot- bridges. All the town was cobble paved, and a fine clatter there must have been on market day, when all wore clogs, or when the strings of pack-horses arrived. In those days several of the houses in the Market Square and elsewhere had pentices built along their fronts ; partly, it would appear, for hanging \" garn \" (yarn) in, in the old wool days, and partly as shelters for folk on market days. * It is worth while noticing that Wordsworth, at the beginning of Book II. of the \" I'reliule,\" describes the site of the Town Hall as partly occupied in his schooldays by a big rock, and utilized as a school playground. On revisiting the site — \" Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground That had been ours. \" He had apparently forgotten that in his schooldays an older Market House occupied at least some part of the site. The contract for building the Hall was dated I4th December, 1789, and was signed by thirteen trustees, who had been appointed on the 4th December previous, to represent the four quarters. In it the building is described as '' Market House and Shambles.\" The present tiustees also possess a presentment, dated December 1st the same year, addressed to the jury of the Court Baron, showing that the market shambles and butcher house (47 feet by 1 8 feet) had been long ruinous and decayed, and should be pulled down, enlarged, and rebuilt. The cost of the new building was defrayed by subscription, the principal being two donations of £20, given respectively by the Lords of the Manor and Mr. Wm. Matthews, of London. The following were the first trustees: — The Rev. Reginald Braithwaite ; Thos. Middlefell, Hawkshead Fieldhead ; John Borwick, Borwick Ground ; Thomas Rigge, High Keenground ; George Law, Brathay Hall; David Kirkby, The Thwaite ; John Jackson, Bank Ground ; Anthony Wilson, High Wray ; William Taylor, Manchester ; Matthew Hodgson, Hawkshead ; Myles Sandys, Graythwaite ; William Rawlinson, Graythwaite Low Hall ; John Russell, Force Forge. 3o SURVEY OF THE PARISH. A few of the houses had the lower story deeply recessed and the upper one supported on a rude column. One of these still stands on the Church Hill, while another— a very picturesque old place— was knocked down to make way for the Institute. These recessed fronts were originally the town shops, in days prior to glass windows, for the display of goods, and here, sheltered from storm, was exposed the produce of the farm spinning-wheels to the wool badgers on market day. The house next door to the Institute, now occupied by Mrs. Taylor, is only about forty years old, having been burned down ; but there exists an old painting at the Brown Cow Inn, which shews that its predecessor had one of the pcntices we have mentioned, though unsupported in any way by posts. Behind the Market Hall there rises an isolated and rounded hillock, on the summit of which stands the old gray-towered church, dominating in a most striking way the little town below. It is by no means improbable that this knoll, naturally defensible as it is, was chosen for the original stockaded settlement — the \"saetr\" or \" sidha \" — of Haukr, who gave his name to town and parish. The site is a strong one ; there is some evidence of scarping and ditching, and the theory is in accordance with the rule, that in early settlements the first stockaded enlosurc was afterwards occupied by the temple or church — in early mediaeval times a common hall or fortress for the com- munity.* The church has often been described, and we shall do no more here than point out the most interesting features. It is a very plain building, but it is perhaps the finest example of what may be termed the Lake District style. It consists of a square and somewhat massive tower, a wide nave and aisles, but has neither transepts nor a structural chancel ; and, with the exception of the doors and windows, the entire building is rubble masonry of local Silurian stone. * G. L. Gomme, \" The Village Community,\" London, 1890 (p. 44). SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 33 The tower appears to be the oldest part, but there is nothing by which we can give it a date. The nave is divided from the aisles by immense columns without either capitals or bases, supporting round arches of wide span ; but, curiously, while the columns on the north are round or cylindrical, those on the south arc roughly square in section. These great columns and arches at first sight look like rude work of Norman character, and as such the writer long considered them, until an opportunity occurred for examining the masonry under the plaster. It then appeared that they are constructed of thin quarried local stones, and the half column at the west end of the south arcade is not even bonded into the west wall of the church, which probably is also the case with the fellow half column on the north side. Though no one who has seen the masonry of these arcades exposed would claim a high antiquity for the body of the church, the question of the date remains difficult to decide. The south aisle contained certain windows with simple trefoil heads, and the east window prior to the restoration, in 1875-6, was a plain square-headed five-light window with similar trefoils. All these looked like fifteenth century work, so that probably the arcading was also of the same date, though from the masonry it might be later. Perhaps we may assume that the church in its present ground plan was rebuilt on an older site in the fifteenth century : although we cannot be quite sure about the north aisle, which was certainly built or rebuilt in the time of Elizabeth by Archbishop Sandys ; and the cast end of it was reserved as a private chapel for the use of his family, the \" little quire \" as it is called in the Parish Register. This chapel contains two curious effigies of the prelate's parents, while his own initials, arms, and date are still to be seen over the private entrance. * The fifteenth century church was low and dark, being » See Chapter III. 34 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. roofed under one span, and at some date a clerestory was added to give more light. The windows of this clerestory on the north are oak, and might be Elizabethan ; those on the south arc stone, and there is a date 1633, which may, however, perhaps refer only to the substitution on this side of stone for wooden mullions ; but, at any rate, the clerestory is later than the body of the church. The question arises, Is there any part of the original church (earlier than the fifteenth century) remaining? Unless it be the tower, we believe not. But the opinion of architectural authorities is that in these ancient north country churches the nave represents the six.c of the original church, generally pulled down at a later date and rebuilt with aisles. The length of Hawkshcad Church is 81 feet 8 inches, and the nave width within the columns 23 feet. If these measurements represent the mediaeval church, it was among the widest of the original churches in Carlisle Diocese. Other large churches are Brough, Grcystoke, Warwick, Crosthwaite, and Ulverston. But it remains rather difficult to see why so large a church should be required in so out of the way a district as Hawkshcad/' The church was restored and rc-opencd in 1875-6, and the result is fairly satisfactory, though we cannot but regret the substitution of a pointed window at the east end for the original square-headed five-light one, which was characteristic of the place and period. Before leaving the church we should observe the stained glass inserted in this window by Colonel T. M. Sandys, M.P., and also a smaller modern stained- glass window in the south aisle. The curious ornamentation and texts on the walls and pillars is in great part old, having been discovered at the restora- tion and touched up. The church bells are also worth inspection, and also the ancient oak muniment chest in the * Accounts of HawksheaH Church will be found in : — Baines\" \" History of Lancashire,\" iv. , p. 704. Whitaker's \" Richmomlshire,\" ii., p. 400. \" Transactions of Cumberlan 1 and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society,\" iv., p. 28. \"Hawkshead Church,\" by J. Cory. This gentleman was the architect at the restoration. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 35 tower. There are besides, in the Vicar's custody, some very curious churchwardens' staves, and market measures, which, with the parish books, will receive our attention elsewhere. We cannot but regret that at the restoration of the church the rough-cast which covered the walls externally was removed. No doubt there is something to be said for such a course, as we can study the masonry, which in churches often affords valuable evidence of date. But, from a picturesque point of view, the rough-cast was in admir- able keeping with the town, which the plain masonry is not. Whatever was the fashion with builders when the church was first built we arc not in a position to say, but at the time the greater part of the external walls were erected there is small doubt that rough-cast was in general use, for masonry as an art was then on the decline, and builders found that the only way to keep their walls dry in the humid north was by a thick coat of rough-cast. No doubt, in some ways, this was scamping work, but it served its purpose ; in fact, walls built of local Silurian stone arc not easy to waterproof otherwise, and we venture to believe that even at an earlier date the fashion prevailed. Rough-cast was indeed the necessary outcome of the material used and the climate ; and, as is ever the case, appears both suitable and characteristic of the country. Indeed, before the restoration of the church and the erection of the Institute and police station, the entire town was alike in this respect, while now these buildings give it a sort of magpie colouring which undoubtedly takes away from its appearance. At the foot of the Church hill, on the south-cast, nestles the old Grammar School, the foundation of the good Arch- bishop Sandys, who did so much for his native parish. The building retains its original form, except that the plain windows and door have been replaced recently by sandstone mullions and dressings. Over the door is a great sundial, and below we can read on a tablet an inscription to the Archbishop's memory, placed there in 1675 by Daniel 36 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. Rawlinson, a citizen of London and native of Griscdale, who was himself a benefactor to the school, and whose great marble monument, with that of his son, Sir Thomas Rawlinson, now decorate the western internal wall of the church.\" Hut the school deserves a chapter to itself, and we must continue our general survey of the township. Between Hawkshcad and Hawkshead Hall the road passes over a rounded hill, on which is the hamlet of Gallowbarrow. Here no doubt stood in the days of monastic rule the Callows, erected when the feudal lords had power of life and death ; t and on one of the houses there was formerly the following inscription recording the fact that the building had been purchased in pursuance of the will of another member of the Sandys family : — \" The Rev. Thomas Sandys, Curate of St. Martin's-in-the- Fields, and Lecturer of St. James', London, A.I). 1717, left by will the interest of ^800 to endow the poorhouse and to maintain and educate as many poor boys as the interest will admit of, and the}- arc to be taught at the free school. I749-\" The house was purchased in 1730, and consequently nineteen years before the erection of this inscription, which has now long disappeared. \\ In the fields above Gallowbarrow in a pretty situation lies Keenground, originally built, as its name betokens, by a family called Keen, but now the residence of Mr. J. C. Cowpcr. For man}- generations, however, it was inhabited by a branch of the numerous clan of Rigges, ancestors of the present family of Wood Broughton. In modern times it * These monuments were formerly in the destroyed St. Dionis Backchurch, Fcnchurch Street. See the Author's \" Monumental Inscriptions of Hawkshead, Kenclal, 1892,\" pages 28, 29, and 65. Mr. T. Alcock Beck, in an unpublished MS., alludes to the Church Hill as \" Gallaber,\" but we do not know his authority. The post-Reformation gibbet was, as we shall see, near the head of Ksthwaite. Galloway Lane, near Roger Ground, possibly owes its name to the strings of packhorses or \"galloways\" which came along it. t See Appendix (Charities). SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 37 was acquired by the Reverend John Lodge, Librarian of Cambridge University, who was succeeded there by his nephew, Edmund Lodge, Inspector of Schools in India. His representatives on his demise disposed of the property to the writer's grandfather, who refrontcd it, much altering its appearance. Low Keenground is a typical north country farm house with round chimneys. Below Hawkshead and on the edge of Ksthwaitc lies some of the best land in the parish, and the parallelism of the fences and the farm name Hawkshcacl Field plainly shew that here in old days lay the common fields of the little village community. Next comes Esthwaitc Lodge, a pretty house, somewhat stiff and formal in architecture certainly, but very charmingly placed amidst well-grown timber. This house was the home of Thomas Alcock Heck, whose fine work on Furncss Abbey is yet the most important contribution to the literature of that subject. It is at present the property of his successor, Win. Alcock Beck, Esq., and we venture to think that this gentleman owns perhaps the most beautifully situated house within the limits of the ancient parish. A little further south we reach, on the margin of the lake, an uninteresting-looking farm. This is all that remains of Esthwaite Hall, the residence for several generations up to the close of the seventeenth century of one branch of the Sandys family. Here the good Archbishop \\vas traditionally born, and we cannot but regret that a place with such associations as Esthwaite Hall has been suffered to fall into its present condition. So far we have said nothing about Esthwaite Water, which forms a delightful feature in the townships of Hawks- head and Claife, and is indeed the only lake which really belongs to the parish. Its scenery is gentle and soft, and though its surroundings of green fields and wooded heights are pretty enough, Esthwaite would be a little featureless were it not for the way in which its shore line is broken by promontories, especially those called Ees and Strickland 38 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. Ecs. There is, however, one place where a view of quite exceptional beauty can be obtained. This is a point in the copse-wood on the road, about two hundred yards west of the beck which runs out of the lake at the south end. From here we look straight up the lake, and the promontories, with their trees, give a delightful variety to the scene. The charm, however, is in the colouring — a summer's day should be chosen, for the foliage is the great feature — and in the distant hills about Ilelvellyn, which close the background. We see right through the gap of Dunmail Raise, and beyond we can just discern a blue outline — the slopes of Skiddaw. It needs but a few paces in either direction from the point and the picture is lost. CLAIKE. \\\\'e have now arrived at the third quarter or township of our old parish, that of Claife, the western and north-western boundaries of which have already been defined. To the south it is limited by ('uusey Heck, while on the cast, for five and a half miles, the western margin of Windcrmcrc forms the frontier, not only of the township and parish, but also of the count}' ol I .aneaster. Claife differs in every way from the quarters already treated of, for il is nearly entirely occupied by a range of hill, part moorland, part wood, and part pasture, which runs nearly north and south, and completely isolates the town and valley of Ilawkshcad from busy \\Yindermerc. These heights — Claife Heights, as they are termed as a whole — are considerably more precipitous on the east, and from many of the points over- looking Windermerc wide panoramic views of the lake and \\\\ estmorland fells are to be obtained. Among these summits many delightful rambles are to be had, and the mixture of colouring of heather, gorse, ravine, and larch is, at certain seasons of the year, exceedingly beautiful. Claife, as we shall sec, is not without its history and traditions, its early pre- historic remains, its superstitions, its reminiscences of the rebellion of 1745 ; but in this chapter we must limit ourselves to description. SURVEY OF THE PARISH. 41 Claife is now divided into Upper and Lower Claife, each containing its own church. The first contains the hamlets of Wray, Lonethwaite, and Colthouse. Wray, again, is divided into High and Low Wray, but the latter has disappeared, merged in the estate of Wray Castle. The old houses of Low Wray stood where now are the lodge and church. With Wray Castle presents itself the delicate task of criticising local domestic architecture, but in the interests of our beautiful parish we cannot conscientiously pass it by. Guide-book writers and others have gone into ecstacies over the magnificence of this stately home ; but we, alas, are totally unable to confirm its right to admiration. Wray Castle is conspicuously and outrageously feudal ; its heavy tower and battlements may have, in some misty lights, a certain picturesqueness : but, given bright weather, when the details are seen, its total incongruity to its surroundings is but too evident. To us it is difficult to see what excuse there is in the nineteenth century to build a house in this style. It can but be that same mistaken eccentricity which induced Mr. English to erect that strange enormity in archiU cture which decorates Long Holme, or, as it is now called in exactly the same fantastic spirit, \" Belle Isle.\" Why should an English gentleman in the nineteenth century, in peaceful Lakeland, wish to live in a feudal fortress ? We understand well the charm of fair landscape, and the comfort of a roomy home for those who can afford it ; but may we not look forward to a period at which architects and owners will be content to build for what is wanted, to beautify and bring out detail on the lines of requirements, instead of imitating, and imitating recklessly and badly, buildings the style of which was dictated by needs of long past ages ? Surely this is not much to expect. It is a canon of architectural art which was deeply taken to heart in the olden days, and why not now? Wray Castle was commenced in 1840 for Doctor James Dawson, of Liverpool, and finished at an enormous cost, and 42 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. the same gentleman erected the church, which is decidedly pretty, near the Lodge Gate. The present owner is E. P. Rawnslcy, Esquire, of Girsby Manor, Lincoln, who, however, docs not reside here. * Hlelham Tarn lies near here, a sheet of water less than half a mile in length. If we stand to-day by its reedy margin it is a lonely enough place, for little life shall we sec, unless in spring a heron sails away as we approach. Yet once it was different, and the black \" stour \" of a charcoal iron forge seethed up from its northern margin. There, at a place where a small beck joins the tarn, still lies a great heap of iron slag, evidence of a long dead and almost forgotten industry.! South-east from here, at the base of Claifc Heights, and commanding magnificent views of \\Vindcrmcrc, is the hamlet of High \\Vray, with a pretty old-fashioned house, the residence ot Miss \\\\illson, whose family has lived here since IJ2S, when it was built by a member of the family. Two modern residences. High \\Vray Hank and Ballawray, are well situated on the slopes above the lake. A winding lane round Latterbarrow will bring us back to the neighbourhood of Esthwaite, where near the lake head is the double hamlet of Tollhouse, since the latter half of the seventeenth century a rendezvous of the Society of Friends, whose little rough-cast meeting house lies between the two clusters of buildings. In the first cluster are Green End and Bccksidc, both comfortable, but unpretending, residences, the latter of which was one of the old homes of the Satterthwaite family, who have always been associated here with the Society of Friends. Bcckside still belongs to them, and the present representative is William Satterthwaite, J. P., who resides in the modern house close by. 1 he little meeting house, whose history we tell elsewhere, is worth a visit. It is built on a plan adopted by the Since writing the above, Wray Castle and its estate of 830 acres has been sold June, 1898) to Mr. David Ainsworth at the price of £25,000, the local Press remarking that the house alone cost in building £60,000. t See Chapter V.

There is nothing to suggest religious devotion in such a building ; so rigid was the rule which banished from the observances of this sect every sign of the pomp of ritual, every feeling which, in most communities, leads to a wish to decorate and beautify the houses of prayer, that these little buildings seem on first sight but humble cottages. Plain stone-mullioned windows, with a transom, light it on the south and west, while in those on the cast the mullions have been replaced by ordinary sashes. A heavy oaken door, in the lock of which is the ancient key, opens into the building, and within, a gallery (approached from the porch) appears to be old and its balusters of oak, although now painted. At the head of the lake is a solitary dub, \"Priest Pot\" by name, evidence, we think, that this was a private fishery pertaining to Hawkshcad Hall — a far more probable deriva- tion than the somewhat silly explanations advanced by some writers.* Here, the older guide-books tell us, was formerly a floating island, a phenomenon which the writers of the early half of the century describe with great care as a prodigious marvel.t It seems, however, to have been but a poor affair, a bit of peaty earth, 24 yards by 5 or 6 yards, with a tree or two upon it, which had got loose from the side. Floating islands were a special craze, somehow, of those talented folks who discovered the lake district, but they seem now to have got neglected, and taking umbrage at their treatment have either formed a new and permanent attachment, or else have precipitated themselves despairingly to the bottom of the lake. Close by here, on the south side of the road, and on the ' See Richardson's \" Furness, Past and Present,\" p. 101. + Housman, Otley, and others. The island is now grown to the south-east margin of the tarn. It probably owed its origin to the leverage of wind against trees which had grown on it, the pressure thus detaching a portion of the peaty margin. According to Housman, it broke loose about 1796. 44 SURVEY OF THE PARISH. Colthouse side of the stream, formerly stood the gibbet, the last record of the use of which is to be found in a ghastly entry in the Parish Register in the year 1672. The exact situation was at a place still known as Gibbet Moss, as the Register puts it, \" on the south side of Sawrey Casey (Cause- way) nearc unto the Pooll-stang.\" Though every trace of this gibbet has now disappeared, there were till about 1860, many persons who remembered the gallows-post still standing, anil elderly folks still do so ; while the writer of a common- place book, to which we shall hereafter refer, records the popular dread of approaching the site even by daylight. Lower Claife contains the hamlets of Near and Far Sawrey, or Sawrey Infra and Extra as they are often called in old documents. In general character they are somewhat alike, scattered, rambling villages on broken ground ; but the first has the advantage of pretty views of Esthwaite Lake. Each possesses one or two prettily-placed private residences, Ecswyke * at Near Sawrcy and Brierswood at Far Sawrey being the principal ones. The latter, a modern mansion in the half-timber style, was formerly called the Briers, an estate (like most of the old farms about Sawrcy), till the beginning of this century, of the Braithwaites, who, as we shall hereafter sec, were a regular clan in this corner of the parish. And here we must again face the invidious task of criticizing local domestic architecture. There are many modern houses in the lakes which are truly hideous. This is in no sense the case with the modern half-timber houses of Pullwoods and Brierswood, for the former is a distinctly beautiful building. But the architectural style is foreign, and such houses cannot fall into proper accord with the landscape. The truth is that both owners and architects, when building in a beautiful country, want more than good taste and skill : they want a knowledge of climate, history, and geology.
