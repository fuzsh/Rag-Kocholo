This striking feature was long taken for granted by users of Persian, Turkish, Urdu, etc., and appears not to have been subjected to a successful rationale until the present work (see below under Further References, esp. 1991 book). The study provides examples of the forms incorporated into the langages of the central Islamic sprachbund and their role in derivational morphology.."
