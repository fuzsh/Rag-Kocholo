Much of the information can be covered in an intensive semester course or alternatively, some of the material can be eliminated when a programme is on a quarterly basis. The following paragraphs outline the objectives and approach of this book.\n\nThe subject of statistics Statistics includes the collecting, organizing, and analysing of data for describing situations and often for the purposes of decision-making. Usually the data collected are quantitative, or numerical, but information can also be categorical or qualitative. However, any qualitative data can subsequently be made quantitative by using a numerically scaled questionnaire where subjective responses correspond to an established number scale. Statistical analysis is fundamental in the business environment as logical decisions are based on quantitative data. Quite simply, if you cannot express what you know, your current situation, or the future outlook, in the form of numbers, you really do not know much about it. And, if you do not know much about it, you cannot manage it. Without numbers, you are just another person with an opinion! This is where statistics plays a role and why it is important to study the subject. For example, by simply displaying statistical data in a visual form you can convince your manager or your client. By using probability analysis you can test your company’s\n\nstrategy and importantly evaluate expected financial risk. Market surveys are useful to evaluate the probable success of new products or innovative processes. Operations managers in services and manufacturing, use statistical process control for monitoring and controlling performance. In all companies, historical data are used to develop sales forecasts, budgets, capacity requirements, or personnel needs. In finance, managers analyse company stocks, financial performance, or the economic outlook for investment purposes. For firms like General Electric, Motorola, Caterpillar, Gillette (now a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble), or AXA (Insurance), six-sigma quality, which is founded on statistics, is part of the company management culture!\n\nChapter organization There are 11 chapters and each one presents a subject area – organization of information, characteristics of data, probability basics, discrete data, the normal distribution, sampling, estimating, hypothesis testing for single, and multiple populations, forecasting and correlation, and data indexing. Each chapter begins with a box opener illustrating a situation where the particular subject area might be encountered. Following the box opener are the learning objectives, which highlight the principal themes that you will study in the chapter indicating also the subtopics of each theme. These subtopics underscore the elements that you will cover. Finally, at the end of each chapter is a summary organized according to the principal themes. Thus, the box opener, the learning objectives, the chapter itself, and the\n\nx\n\nAbout this book chapter summary are logically and conveniently linked that will facilitate navigation and retention of each chapter subject area.\n\nGlossary Like many business subjects, statistics contains many definitions, jargon, and equations that are highlighted in bold letters throughout the text. These definitions and equations, over 300, are all compiled in an alphabetic glossary in Appendix I.\n\nMicrosoft excel This text is entirely based on Microsoft Excel with its interactive spreadsheets, graphical capabilities, and built-in macro-functions. These functions contain all the mathematical and statistical relationships such as the normal, binomial, Poisson, and Student-t distributions. For this reason, this textbook does not include any of the classic statistical tables such as the standardized normal distribution, Student-t, or chi-square values as all of these are contained in the Microsoft Excel package. As you work through the chapters in this book, you will find reference to all the appropriate statistical functions employed. A guide of how to use these Excel functions is contained in Appendix II, in the paragraph “Using the Excel Functions”. The related Table E-2 then gives a listing and the purpose of all the functions used in this text. The 11 chapters in this book contain numerous tables, line graphs, histograms and pie charts. All these have been developed from data using an Excel spreadsheet and this data has then been converted into the desired graph. What I have done with these Excel screen graphs (or screen dumps as they are sometimes disparagingly called) is to tidy them up by removing the tool bar, the footers, and the numerical column and the alphabetic line headings to give an uncluttered graph. These Excel graphs in PowerPoint format are available on the Web.\n\nA guide of how to make these Excel graphs is given also in Appendix II in the paragraph, “Generating Excel Graphs”. Associated with this paragraph are several Excel screens giving the stepwise procedure to develop graphs from a particular set of data. I have chosen Excel as the cornerstone of this book, rather than other statistical packages, as in my experience Excel is a major working tool in business. Thus, when you have completed this book you will have gained a double competence – understanding business statistics and versatility in using Excel!\n\nBasic mathematics You may feel a little rusty about your basic mathematics that you did in secondary school. In this case, in Appendix III is a section that covers all the arithmetical terms and equations that provide all the basics (and more) for statistical analysis.\n\nWorked examples and end-of-chapter exercises In every chapter there are worked examples to aid comprehension of concepts. Further there are numerous multipart end-of-chapter exercises and a case. All of these examples and exercises are based on Microsoft Excel. The emphasis of this textbook, as underscored by these chapter exercises, is on practical business applications. The answers for the exercises are given in Appendix IV and the databases for these exercises and the worked examples are contained on the enclosed CD. (Note, in the text you may find that if you perform the application examples and test exercises on a calculator you may find slightly different answers than those presented in the textbook. This is because all the examples and exercises have been calculated using Excel, which carries up to 14 figures after the decimal point. A calculator will round numbers.)\n\nAbout this book\n\nInternational The business environment is global. This textbook recognizes this by using box openers, examples, exercises, and cases from various countries where the $US, Euro, and Pound Sterling are employed.\n\nLearning statistics Often students become afraid when they realize that they have to take a course in statistics as part of their college or university curriculum. I often hear remarks like: “I will never pass this course.” “I am no good at maths and so I am sure I will fail the exam.” “I don’t need a course in statistics as I am going to be in marketing.” “What good is statistics to me, I plan to take a job in human resources?” All these remarks are unwarranted and the knowledge of statistics is vital in all areas of business. The subject is made easier, and more fun, by using Microsoft Excel. To aid comprehension,\n\nthe textbook begins with fundamental ideas and then moves into more complex areas.\n\nThe author I have been in industry for over 20 years using statistics and then teaching the subject for the last 21 with considerable success using the subject material, and the approach given in this text. You will find the book shorter than many of the texts on the market but I have only presented those subject areas that in my experience give a solid foundation of statistical analysis for business, and that can be covered in a reasonable time frame. This text avoids working through tedious mathematical computations, often found in other statistical texts that I find which confuse students. You should not have any qualms about studying statistics – it really is not a difficult subject to grasp. If you need any further information, or have questions to ask, please do not hesitate to get in touch through the Elsevier website or at my e-mail address: [email protected].\n\nxi\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPresenting and organizing data\n\nHow not to present data Steve was an undergraduate business student and currently performing a 6-month internship with Telephone Co. Today he was feeling nervous as he was about to present the results of a marketing study that he had performed on the sales of mobile telephones that his firm produced. There were 10 people in the meeting including Roger, Susan, and Helen three of the regional sales directors, Valerie Jones, Steve’s manager, the Head of Marketing, and representatives from production and product development. Steve showed his first slide as illustrated in Table 1.1 with the comment that “This is the 200 pieces of raw sales data that I have collected”. At first there was silence and then there were several very pointed comments. “What does all that mean?” “I just don’t understand the significance of those figures?” “Sir, would you kindly interpret that data”. After the meeting Valerie took Steve aside and said, “I am sorry Steve but you just have to remember that all of our people are busy and need to be presented information that gives them a clear and concise picture of the situation. The way that you presented the information is not at all what we expect”.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nTable 1.1 35,378 109,785 108,695 89,597 85,479 73,598 95,896 109,856 83,695 105,987 59,326 99,999 90,598 68,976 100,296 71,458 112,987 72,312 119,654 70,489\n\nRaw sales data ($). 170,569 184,957 91,864 160,259 64,578 161,895 52,754 101,894 75,894 93,832 121,459 78,562 156,982 50,128 77,498 88,796 123,895 81,456 96,592 94,587\n\n104,985 96,598 120,598 55,492 103,985 132,689 114,985 80,157 98,759 58,975 82,198 110,489 87,694 106,598 77,856 110,259 65,847 124,856 66,598 85,975\n\n134,859 121,985 47,865 152,698 81,980 120,654 62,598 78,598 133,958 102,986 60,128 86,957 117,895 63,598 134,890 72,598 128,695 101,487 81,490 138,597\n\n120,958 63,258 162,985 92,875 137,859 67,895 145,985 86,785 74,895 102,987 86,597 99,486 85,632 123,564 79,432 140,598 66,897 73,569 139,584 97,498\n\n107,865 164,295 83,964 56,879 126,987 87,653 99,654 97,562 37,856 144,985 91,786 132,569 104,598 47,895 100,659 125,489 82,459 138,695 82,456 143,985\n\n127,895 97,568 103,985 151,895 102,987 58,975 76,589 136,984 90,689 101,498 56,897 134,987 77,654 100,295 95,489 69,584 133,984 74,583 150,298 92,489\n\n106,825 165,298 61,298 88,479 116,985 103,958 113,590 89,856 64,189 101,298 112,854 76,589 105,987 60,128 122,958 89,651 98,459 136,958 106,859 146,289\n\n130,564 113,985 104,987 165,698 45,189 124,598 80,459 96,215 107,865 103,958 54,128 135,698 78,456 141,298 111,897 70,598 153,298 115,897 68,945 84,592\n\n108,654 124,965 184,562 89,486 131,958 168,592 107,865 163,985 123,958 71,589 152,654 118,654 149,562 84,598 129,564 93,876 87,265 142,985 122,654 69,874\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nLearning objectives After you have studied this chapter you will be able to logically organize and present statistical data in a visual form so that you can convince your audience and objectively get your point across. You will learn how to develop the following support tools for both numerical and categorical data accordingly as follows. ✔\n\n✔\n\nNumerical data • Types of numerical data • Frequency distribution • Absolute frequency histogram • Relative frequency histogram • Frequency polygon • Ogive • Stem-and-leaf display • Line graph Categorical data • Questionnaires • Pie chart • Vertical histogram • Parallel histogram • Horizontal bar chart • Parallel bar chart • Pareto diagram • Cross-classification or contingency table • Stacked histogram • Pictograms\n\nAs the box opener illustrates, in the business environment, it is vital to show data in a clear and precise manner so that everyone concerned understands the ideas and arguments being presented. Management people are busy and often do not have the time to make an in depth analysis of information. Thus a simple and coherent presentation is vital in order to get your message across.\n\nNumerical Data Numerical data provide information in a quantitative form. For example, the house has 250 m2 of living space. My gross salary last year was £70,000 and this year it has increased to £76,000. He ran the Santa Monica marathon in 3 hours and 4 minutes. The firm’s net income last year was $14,500,400. All these give information in a numerical form and clearly state a particular condition or situation. When data is collected it might be raw data, which is collected information that has not been organized. The next step after you have raw data is to organize this information and present it in a meaningful form. This section gives useful ways to present numerical data.\n\nTypes of numerical data Numerical data are most often either univariate or bivariate. Univariate data are composed of individual values that represent just one random variable, x. The information presented in Table 1.1 is univariate data. Bivariate data involves two variables, x and y, and any data that is subsequently put into graphical form would be bivariate since a value on the x-axis has a corresponding value on the y-axis.\n\nFrequency distribution One way of organizing univariate data, to make it easier to understand, is to put it into a frequency distribution. A frequency distribution is a table, that can be converted into a graph, where the data are arranged into unique groups, categories, or classes according to the frequency, or how often, data values appear in a given class. By grouping data into classes, the data are more manageable than raw data and we can demonstrate clearly patterns in the information. Usually the greater the quantity of data then there should be more classes to clearly show the profile. A guide is to have at least 5 classes but no more than 15 although it really depends on the amount of data\n\n3\n\n4\n\nStatistics for Business available and what we are trying to demonstrate. In the frequency distribution, the class range or width should be the same such that there is coherency in data analysis. The class range or class width is given by the following relationship: Class range or class width Desired range of the complete frequency distribution Number of grroups selected\n\n1(i)\n\nThe range is the difference between the highest and the lowest value of any set of data. Let us consider the sales data given in Table 1.1. If we use the [function MAX] in Excel, we obtain $184,957 as the highest value of this data. If we use the [function MIN] in Excel it gives the lowest value of $35,378. When we develop a frequency distribution we want to be sure that all of the data is contained within the boundaries that we establish. Thus, to develop a frequency distribution for these sales data, a logical\n\nmaximum value for presenting this data is $185,000 (the nearest value in ’000s above $184,957) and a minimum value is $35,000 (the nearest value in ’000s below $35,378). By using these upper and lower boundary limits we have included all of the 200 data items. If we want 15 classes then the class range or class width is given as follows using equation 1(i): Class range or class width\n\n$185, 000 $35, 000 $10, 000 15\n\nThe tabulated frequency distribution for the sales data using 15 classes is shown in Table 1.2. The 1st column gives the number of the class range, the 2nd gives the limits of the class range, and the 3rd column gives the amount of data in each range. The lower limit of the distribution is $35,000 and each class increase by intervals of $10,000 to the upper limit of $185,000. In selecting a lower value of $35,000 and an upper\n\nTable 1.2\n\nFrequency distribution of sales data.\n\nClass no.\n\nClass range ($)\n\nAmount of data in class\n\nPercentage of data\n\nMidpoint of class range\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\n25,000 to 35,000 35,000 to 45,000 45,000 to 55,000 55,000 to 65,000 65,000 to 75,000 75,000 to 85,000 85,000 to 95,000 95,000 to 105,000 105,000 to 115,000 115,000 to 125,000 125,000 to 135,000 135,000 to 145,000 145,000 to 155,000 155,000 to 165,000 165,000 to 175,000 175,000 to 185,000 185,000 to 195,000\n\n0 2 6 14 18 22 24 30 20 18 14 12 8 6 4 2 0 200\n\n0.00 1.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 11.00 12.00 15.00 10.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 4.00 3.00 2.00 1.00 0.00 100.00\n\n30,000 40,000 50,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 110,000 120,000 130,000 140,000 150,000 160,000 170,000 180,000 190,000\n\nTotal\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data value of $185,000 we have included all the sales data values, and so the frequency distribution is called a closed-ended frequency distribution as all data is contained within the limits. (Note that in Table 1.2 we have included a line below $35,000 of a class range 25,000 to 35,000 and a line above $185,000 of a class range 185,000 to 195,000. The reason for this will be explained in the later section entitled, “Frequency polygon”.) In order to develop the frequency distribution using Excel, you first make a single column of the class limits either in the same tab as the dataset or if you prefer in a separate tab. In this case the class limits are $35,000 to $185,000 in increments of $10,000. You then highlight a virgin column, immediately adjacent to the class limits, of exactly the same height and with exactly the corresponding lines as the class limits. Then select [function FREQUENCY] in Excel and enter the dataset, that is the information in Table 1.1, and the class limits you developed that are demanded by the Excel screen. When these have been selected, you press the three keys, control-shift-enter [Ctrl - ↑ - 8 ] simultaneously and this will give a frequency distribution of the amount of the data as shown in the 3rd column of Table 1.2. Note in the frequency distribution the cut-off points for the class limits. The value of $45,000 falls in the class range, $35,000 and $45,000, whereas $45,001 is in the class range $45,000 to $55,000. The percentage, or proportion of data, as shown in the 4th column of Table 1.2, is obtained by dividing the amount of data in a particular class by the total amount of data. For example, in the class width $45,000 to $55,000, there are six pieces of data and 6/200 is 3.00%. This is a relative frequency distribution meaning that the percentage value is relative to the total amount of data available. Note that once you have created a frequency table or graph you are now making a presentation in bivariate form as all the x values have a corresponding y value.\n\nNote that in this example, when we calculated the class range or class width using the maximum and the minimum values for 15 classes we obtained a whole number of $10,000. Whole numbers such as this make for clear presentations. However, if we wanted 16 classes then the class range would be $9,375 [(185,000 – 35,000)/16] which is not as convenient. In this case we can modify our maximum and minimum values to say 190,000 and 30,000 which brings us back to a class range of $10,000 [(190,000 – 30,000)/16]. Alternatively, we can keep the minimum value at $35,000 and make the maximum value $195,000 which again gives a class range of $10,000 [(195,000 – 35,000)/16]. In either case we still maintain a closed-limit frequency distribution.\n\nAbsolute frequency histogram Once a frequency distribution table has been developed we can convert this into a histogram, which is a visual presentation of the information, using the graphics capabilities in Excel. An absolute frequency histogram is a vertical bar chart drawn on an x- and y-axes. The horizontal, or x-axis, is a numerical scale of the desired class width where each class is of equal size. The vertical bars, defined by the y-axis, have a length proportional to the actual quantity of data, or to the frequency of the amount of data that occurs in a given class range. That is to say, the lengths of the vertical bars are dependent on, or a function of, the range selected by our class width. Figure 1.1 gives an absolute frequency histogram for the sales data using the 3rd column from Table 1.2. Here we have 15 vertical bars whose lengths are proportional to the amount of contained data. The first bar contains data in the range $35,000 to $45,000, the second bar has data in the range $45,000 to $55,000, the third in the range $55,000 to $65,000, etc. Above each bar is indicated the amount of\n\n5\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.1 Absolute frequency distribution of sales data. 32\n\n30\n\n30 28 26 Amount of data in this range\n\n24\n\n24\n\n22\n\n22\n\n20\n\n20\n\n18\n\n18\n\n18 16\n\n14\n\n14\n\n14\n\n12\n\n12 10\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n5\n\n5\n\n18\n\n5\n\n18\n\n5\n\nto\n\n5\n\n17\n\nto 5\n\n17\n\n5\n\n16\n\nto 5\n\n16\n\n5\n\n15\n\nto 5\n\n15\n\n5\n\n14\n\nto 5\n\n14\n\n5\n\n13\n\nto 13\n\n5 12\n\n5\n\nto\n\n12\n\n5\n\n5\n\n11 11\n\n10\n\n5\n\nto\n\nto\n\n95\n\nto 85\n\n10\n\n95\n\n85\n\n75 to\n\n75\n\nto 65\n\n55\n\n65\n\n55 to\n\n45\n\n45\n\nto\n\n35 35\n\nto\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n$’000s\n\ndata that is included in each class range. There is no space shown between each bar since the class ranges move from one limit to another though each limit has a definite cut-off point. In presenting this information to say, the sales department, we can clearly see the pattern of the data and specifically observe that the amount of sales in each class range increases and then decreases beyond $105,000. We can see that the greatest amount of sales of the sample of 200, 30 to be exact, lies in the range $95,000 to $ 105,000.\n\nwhich is an alternative to the absolute frequency histogram where now the vertical bar, represented by the y-axis, is the percentage or proportion of the total data rather than the absolute amount. The relative frequency histogram of the sales data is given in Figure 1.2 where we have used the percent of data from the 4th column of Table 1.2. The shape of this histogram is identical to the histogram in Figure 1.1. We now see that for revenues in the range $95,000 to $105,000 the proportion of the total sales data is 15%.\n\nRelative frequency histogram\n\nFrequency polygon\n\nAgain using the graphics capabilities in Excel we can develop a relative frequency histogram,\n\nThe absolute frequency histogram, or the relative frequency histogram, can be converted into\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nFigure 1.2 Relative frequency distribution of sales data. 16 15.00\n\n15 14 13 Percent of data in this range\n\n12.00\n\n12 11.00\n\n11 10.00\n\n10 9.00\n\n9.00\n\n9 8 7.00\n\n7.00\n\n7 6.00\n\n6 5 4.00\n\n4 3.00\n\n3.00\n\n3 2.00\n\n2 1.00\n\n1.00\n\n1\n\n5\n\n5\n\n18\n\n5\n\n18\n\nto\n\n5\n\n17 5\n\nto 5\n\n17\n\n5\n\n16\n\nto 5\n\n16\n\n5\n\n15\n\nto 5\n\n15\n\n5\n\n14 14\n\n5\n\nto\n\n13\n\n5\n\n13\n\n5\n\nto\n\n12\n\n5\n\n12\n\n5\n\nto\n\n11\n\n5\n\n11\n\n5\n\nto\n\n10\n\n95\n\nto 10\n\n95\n\n85\n\nto\n\n85\n\n75\n\n75\n\nto\n\n65\n\n65\n\nto\n\n55\n\nto 55\n\n45\n\n35\n\nto\n\n45\n\n0.00\n\nto\n\n35\n\n0\n\n0.00\n\n$’000s\n\na line graph or frequency polygon. The frequency polygon is developed by determining the midpoint of the class widths in the respective histogram. The midpoint of a class range is, (maximum value minimum value) 2 For example, the midpoint of the class range, $95,000 to $105,000 is, (95, 000 105, 000) 200, 000 100, 000 2 2 The midpoints of all the class ranges are given in the 5th column of Table 1.2. Note that we\n\nhave given an entry, $25,000 to $35,000 and an entry of $185,000 to $195,000 where here the amount of data in these class ranges is zero since in these ranges we are beyond the limits of the closed-ended frequency distribution. In doing this we are able to construct a frequency polygon, which cuts the x-axis for a y-value of zero. Figure 1.3 gives the absolute frequency polygon and the relative frequency polygon is shown in Figure 1.4. These polygons are developed using the graphics capabilities in Excel where the x-axis is the midpoint of the class width and the y-axis is the frequency of occurrence. Note that the relative frequency polygon has an identical form as the absolute frequency polygon of Figure 1.3 but the\n\n7\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.3 Absolute frequency polygon of sales data. 35\n\n30\n\nFrequency\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n00 0,\n\n19\n\n0,\n\n18\n\n00 0,\n\n17\n\n00\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n00 0,\n\n16\n\n0,\n\n15\n\n00 0,\n\n14\n\n00\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0 13\n\n0,\n\n00\n\n00\n\n00\n\n12\n\n0, 11\n\n0,\n\n00\n\n0\n\n0\n\n00 ,0\n\n0, 10\n\n,0\n\n90\n\n00\n\n00 80\n\n00\n\n70\n\n,0\n\n00 ,0\n\n,0 60\n\n,0\n\n00 50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n,0\n\n00\n\n0\n\nAverage between upper and lower values (midpoint of class)\n\nFigure 1.4 Relative frequency polygon of sales data. 16 15 14 13 12\n\nFrequency (%)\n\n11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 30 ,0 00 40 ,0 00 50 ,0 00 60 ,0 00 70 ,0 00 80 ,0 00 90 ,0 00 10 0, 00 11 0 0, 00 12 0 0, 00 13 0 0, 00 14 0 0, 00 15 0 0, 00 16 0 0, 00 17 0 0, 00 18 0 0, 00 19 0 0, 00 0\n\n8\n\nAverage between upper and lower values (midpoint of range)\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data y-axis is a percentage, rather than an absolute scale. The difference between presenting the data as a frequency polygon rather than a histogram is that you can see the continuous flow of the data.\n\nOgive An ogive is an adaptation of a frequency distribution, where the data values are progressively totalled, or cumulated, such that the resulting table indicates how many, or the proportion of, observations that lie above or below certain limits. There is a less than ogive, which indicates the amount of data below certain limits. This ogive, in graphical form, has a positive slope\n\nTable 1.3\n\nsuch that the y values increase from left to right. The other is a greater than ogive that illustrates data above certain values. It has a negative slope, where the y values decrease from left to right. The frequency distribution data from Table 1.2 has been converted into an ogive format and this is given in Table 1.3, which shows the cumulated data in an absolute form and a relative form. The relative frequency ogives, developed from this data, are given in Figure 1.5. The usefulness of these graphs is that interpretations can be easily made. For example, from the greater than ogive we can see that 80.00% of the sales revenues are at least $75,000. Alternatively, from the less than ogive, we can\n\nOgives of sales data.\n\nClass limit, n\n\nRange of class limits (‘000s)\n\n25,000 35,000 45,000 55,000 65,000 75,000 85,000 95,000 105,000 115,000 125,000 135,000 145,000 155,000 165,000 175,000 185,000 195,000 Total\n\n35 35 to 45 45 to 55 55 to 65 65 to 75 75 to 85 85 to 95 95 to 105 105 to 115 115 to 125 125 to 135 135 to 145 145 to 155 155 to 165 165 to 175 175 to 185 185\n\nOgive using absolute data\n\nOgive using relative data\n\nNo. n No. class Number Percentage Percentage Percentage but (n 1) limit, n limit age n age class limit but (n 1) limit, n 0 2 6 14 18 22 24 30 20 18 14 12 8 6 4 2 0 200\n\n200 198 192 178 160 138 114 84 64 46 32 20 12 6 2 0\n\n0 2 8 22 40 62 86 116 136 154 168 180 188 194 198 200\n\n0.00 1.00 3.00 7.00 9.00 11.00 12.00 15.00 10.00 9.00 7.00 6.00 4.00 3.00 2.00 1.00 0.00 100.00\n\n100.00 99.00 96.00 89.00 80.00 69.00 57.00 42.00 32.00 23.00 16.00 10.00 6.00 3.00 1.00 0.00 0.00\n\n0.00 1.00 4.00 11.00 20.00 31.00 43.00 58.00 68.00 77.00 84.00 90.00 94.00 97.00 99.00 100.00\n\n9\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.5 Relative frequency ogives of sales data. 100 90 80\n\nPercentage (%)\n\n70 60 50 40 30 20 10\n\n0\n\n00\n\n5, 18\n\n5, 17\n\n00\n\n0\n\n0 00\n\n0 00\n\n5, 16\n\n0 00\n\n5, 15\n\n0 5, 14\n\n00\n\n5, 13\n\n5, 12\n\n00\n\n0\n\n0 00\n\n0 5, 11\n\n5,\n\n00\n\n00 10\n\n00\n\n,0 95\n\n00\n\n,0 85\n\n00\n\n,0 75\n\n00\n\n,0 65\n\n00\n\n,0 55\n\n,0 45\n\n,0\n\n00\n\n0 35\n\n10\n\nSales ($) Greater than\n\nsee that 90.00% of the sales are no more than $145,000. The ogives can also be presented as an absolute frequency ogive by indicating on the y-axis the number of data entries which lie above or below given values. This is shown for the sales data in Figure 1.6. Here we see, for example, that 60 of the 200 data points are sales data that are less than $85,000. The relative frequency ogive is probably more useful than the absolute frequency ogive as proportions or percentages are more meaningful and easily understood than absolute values. In the latter case, we would need to know to what base we are referring. In this case a sample of 200 pieces of data.\n\nLess than\n\nStem-and-leaf display Another way of presenting data according to the frequency of occurrence is a stem-and-leaf display. This organizes data showing how values are distributed and cluster around the range of observations in the dataset. The display separates data entries into leading digits, or stems and trailing digits, or leaves. A stem-and-leaf display shows all individual data entries whereas a frequency distribution groups data into class ranges. Let us consider the raw data that is given in Table 1.4, which is the sales receipts, in £’000s for one particular month for 60 branches of a supermarket in the United Kingdom.

The frequency distribution for the same data is shown in Figure 1.8. The pattern is similar to the stem-and-leaf display but the individual values are not shown. Note that in the frequency distribution, the x-axis has the range greater than the lower thousand value while the stemand-leaf display includes this value. For example, in the stem-and-leaf display, 11.0 appears in the stem 11 to less than 12. In the frequency distribution, 11.0 appears in the class range 10 to 11. Alternatively, in the stem that has a value of 16 there are three values (16.0; 16.0; 16.1), whereas in the frequency distribution for the class 16 to 17 there is only one value (16.1) as 16.0 is not greater than 16. These differences are simply because this is the way that the\n\n9.1 10.7 11.5 12.5 13.8 15.6\n\n9.2 10.8 11.7 12.6 14.1 15.8\n\n9.6 10.9 11.7 12.7 14.2 16.0\n\n9.6 11.0 11.9 12.9 14.4 16.0\n\n9.8 11.0 12.0 13.1 14.5 16.1\n\nfrequency function operates in Microsoft Excel. If you have no add-on stem-and-leaf display in Excel (a separate package) then the following is a way to develop the display using the basic Excel program: ● ●\n\n● ●\n\nArrange all the raw data in a horizontal line. Sort the data in ascending order by line. (Use the Excel function SORT in the menu bar Data.) Select the stem values and place in a column. Transpose the ordered data into their appropriate stem giving just the leaf value. For example, if there is a value 9.75 then the stem is 9, and the leaf value is 75.\n\nAnother approach to develop a stem-and-leaf display is not to sort the data but to keep it in its raw form and then to indicate the leaf values in chronological order for each stem. This has a disadvantage in that you do not see immediately which values are being repeated. A stemand-leaf display is one of the techniques in exploratory data analysis (EDA), which are those methods that give a sense or initial feel about data being studied. A box and whisker plot discussed in Chapter 2 is also another technique in EDA.\n\nLine graph A line graph, or usually referred to just as a graph, gives bivariate data on the x- and y-axes. It illustrates the relationship between the variable\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nFigure 1.8 Frequency distribution of the sales revenue of a supermarket (£). 11 10\n\n10 9\n\nNumber of values in this range\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8 7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5 4\n\n4 3 2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n17 to\n\n16\n\n16\n\nto\n\n15\n\n15\n\nto\n\n14\n\n14\n\nto\n\n13\n\n13\n\nto\n\n12\n\n12\n\nto\n\n11 11\n\n10\n\nto\n\n9\n\nto\n\n10\n\n9 to 8\n\n7\n\nto\n\n7\n\n6\n\nto\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\nClass limits (£)\n\nTable 1.6\n\nSales data for the last 12 years.\n\nPeriod\n\nYear\n\nSales ($‘000s)\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003\n\n1,775 2,000 2,105 2,213 2,389 2,415 2,480 2,500 2,665 2,810 2,940 3,070\n\non the x-axis and the corresponding value on the y-axis. If time represents part of the data this is always shown in the x-axis. A line graph is not necessarily a straight line but can be curvilinear. Attention has to be paid to the scales on the axes as the appearance of the graph can change and decision-making can be distorted. Consider for example, the sales revenues given in Table 1.6 for the 12-year period from 1992 to 2003. Figure 1.9 gives the graph for this sales data where the y-axis begins at zero and the increase on the axis is in increments of $500,000. Here the slope of the graph, illustrating the increase in sales each year, is moderate. Figure 1.10 now shows the same information except that the y-axis starts at the value of $1,700,000 and the\n\n13\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.9 Sales data for the last 12 years for “Company A”. 3,500\n\n3,000\n\n$’000s\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0 1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998 Year\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\nFigure 1.10 Sales data for the last 12 years for “Company B”. 3,100\n\n2,900\n\n2,700\n\n$’000s\n\n14\n\n2,500\n\n2,300\n\n2,100\n\n1,900\n\n1,700 1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998 Year\n\n1999\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data incremental increase is $200,000 or 2.5 times smaller than in Figure 1.9. This gives the impression that the sales growth is very rapid, which is why the two figures are labelled “Company A” and “Company B”. They are of course the same company. Line graphs are treated further in Chapter 10.\n\nCategorical Data Information that includes a qualitative response is categorical data and for this information there may be no quantitative data. For example, the house is the largest on the street. My salary increased this year. He ran the Santa Monica marathon in a fast time. Here the categories are large, increased, and fast. The responses, “Yes” or “No”, to a survey are also categorical data. Alternatively categorical data may be developed from numerical data, which is then organized and given a label, a category, or a name. For example, a firm’s sales revenues, which are quantitative data, may be presented according to geographic region, product type, sales agent, business unit, etc. A presentation of this type can be important to show the strength of the firm.\n\nQuestionnaires Very often we use questionnaires in order to evaluate customers’ perception of service level, students’ appreciation of a university course, or subscribers’ opinion of a publication. We do this\n\nTable 1.7\n\nA scaled questionnaire.\n\nCategory Very Poor Satisfactory Good Very poor good Score\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nbecause we want to know if we are “doing it right” and if not what changes should we make. A questionnaire may take the form as given in Table 1.7. The first line is the category of the response. This is obviously subjective information. For example with a university course, Student A may have a very different opinion of the same programme as Student B. We can give the categorical response a score, or a quantitative value for the subjective response, as shown in the second line. Then, if the number of responses is sufficiently large, we can analyse this data in order to obtain a reasonable opinion of say the university course. The analysis of this type of questionnaire is illustrated in Chapter 2, and there is additional information in Chapter 6.\n\nPie chart If we have numerical data, this can be converted into a pie chart according to desired categories. A pie chart is a circle representing the data and divided into segments like portions of a pie. Each segment of the pie is proportional to the total amount of data it represents and can be labelled accordingly. The complete pie represents 100% of the data and the usefulness of the pie chart is that we can see clearly the pattern of the data. As an illustration, the sales data of Table 1.1 has now been organized by country and this tabular information is given in Table 1.8 together with the percentage amount of data for each country. This information, as a pie chart, is shown in Figure 1.11. We can clearly see now what the data represents and the contribution from each geographical territory. Here for example, the United Kingdom has the greatest contribution to sales revenues, and Austria the least. When you develop a pie chart for data, if you have a category called “other” be sure that this proportion is small relative to all the other categories in the pie chart; otherwise, your audience will question what is included in this mysterious “other” slice. When you develop a pie chart you can\n\n15\n\n16\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nTable 1.8 Raw sales data according to country ($).

One column, or row, is the category, and the adjacent column, or row, is the numerical data. Note that in developing a pie chart in Excel you do not have to determine the percentage amount in the table. The graphics capability in Excel does this automatically.\n\nParallel histogram\n\nVertical histogram\n\nHorizontal bar chart\n\nAn alternative to a pie chart is to illustrate the data by a vertical histogram where the vertical bars on the y-axis show the percentage of data, and the x-axis the categories. Figure 1.12 gives an absolute histogram of the above pie chart sales information where the vertical bars show the absolute total sales and the x-axis has now been given a category according to geographic region. Figure 1.13 gives the relative frequency histogram for this same information where the y-axis is now a percentage scale. Note, in these histograms, the bars are separated, as one category does not directly flow to another, as is the case of a histogram of a complete numerically based frequency distribution.\n\nA horizontal bar chart is a type of histogram where the x- and y-axes are reversed such that the data are presented in a horizontal, rather than a vertical format. Figure 1.15 gives a bar chart for the sales data. Horizontal bar charts are sometimes referred to as Gantt charts after the American engineer Henry L. Gantt (1861–1919).\n\nA parallel or side-by-side histogram is useful to compare categorical data often of different time periods as illustrated in Figure 1.14. The figure shows the unemployment rate by country for two different years. From this graph we can compare the change from one period to another.1\n\nParallel bar chart Again like the histogram, a parallel or side-by-side bar chart can be developed.

This illustrates the problems, according to categories, that occur in the distribution by truck of a chemical product. The x-axis gives the categories and the left-hand y-axis is the percent frequency of occurrence according to each of these categories with the vertical bars indicating their magnitude. The line graph that is shown now uses the right-hand y-axis and the same x-axis. This is now the cumulative frequency\n\nof occurrence of each category. If we assume that the categories shown are exhaustive, meaning that all possible problems are included, then the line graph increases to 100% as shown. Usually the presentation is illustrated so that the bars are in descending order from the most important on the left to the least important on the right so that we have an organized picture of our situation. This type of presentation is known as a Pareto diagram, (named after the Italian economist, Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), who is also known for coining the 80/20 rule often used in business). The Pareto diagram is a visual chart used often in quality management and operations auditing as it shows those categorical areas that are the most critical and perhaps should be dealt with first.\n\n17\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.13 Histogram of sales as a percentage. 24 22 20 18 Total revenues (%)\n\n16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2\n\ned\n\nK\n\nSw\n\nrtu Po\n\nrla\n\nU\n\nen\n\nl ga\n\ns nd\n\nly N\n\net\n\nG\n\nhe\n\ner\n\nm\n\nIta\n\ny an\n\nce Fr\n\nFi\n\nan\n\nd nl\n\nan\n\nm lg Be\n\nAu\n\nst\n\niu\n\nria\n\n0\n\nCountry\n\nFigure 1.14 Unemployment rate. 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0\n\nCountry End of 2002\n\nEnd of 2001\n\nU SA\n\nK U\n\ned en itz er la nd Sw\n\nSw\n\nai n Sp\n\nnd s\n\net h\n\ner la\n\nly\n\npa n Ja N\n\nIta\n\nAu st ri Be a lg iu m C an ad a D en m a Eu rk ro zo ne Fr an ce G er m an\n\nlia\n\n0.0 Au st ra\n\nPercentage rate\n\n18\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nFigure 1.15 Bar chart for sales revenues.\n\nUK Sweden Portugal\n\nCountry\n\nNetherlands Italy Germany France Finland Belgium Austria 0\n\n500,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n1,500,000\n\n2,000,000\n\n2,500,000\n\n3,000,000\n\n3,500,000\n\n4,000,000\n\nSales revenues ($)\n\nFigure 1.16 Unemployment rate.

As an illustration, Table 1.9 gives a cross-classification table for a sample of 1,550 people in the United States and their professions according to certain states. From this table we can say, for example, that 51 of the teachers are contingent of residing in Vermont. Alternatively, we can say that 24 of the residents of South Dakota are contingent of working for the government.\n\nCumulative\n\n(Contingent means that values are dependent or conditioned on something else.)\n\nStacked histogram Once you have developed the cross-classification table you can present this visually by developing a stacked histogram. Figure 1.18 gives a stacked histogram for the cross-classification in Table 1.9 according the state of employment. Portions of the histogram indicate the profession. Alternatively, Figure 1.19 gives a stacked histogram for the same table but now according to profession. Portions of the histogram now give the state of residence.\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nTable 1.9\n\nCross-classification or contingency table for professions in the United States.\n\nState California Texas Colorado New York Vermont Michigan South Dakota Utah Nevada North Carolina Total\n\nEngineering\n\nTeaching\n\nBanking\n\nGovernment\n\nAgriculture\n\nTotal\n\n20 34 42 43 12 24 34 61 12 6 288\n\n19 62 32 40 51 16 35 25 32 62 374\n\n12 15 23 23 37 15 12 19 18 14 188\n\n23 51 42 35 25 16 24 29 31 41 317\n\n23 65 26 54 46 35 25 61 23 25 383\n\n97 227 165 195 171 106 130 195 116 148 1,550\n\nFigure 1.18 Stacked histogram by state in the United States. 240 220 200\n\nNumber in sample\n\n180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 California Texas Colorado\n\nNew York\n\nVermont Michigan South Dakota\n\nUtah\n\nNevada\n\nState Agriculture\n\nGovernment\n\nBanking\n\nTeaching\n\nEngineering\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n21\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nFigure 1.19 Stacked histogram by profession in the United States. 450 400 350\n\nNumber in sample\n\n22\n\n300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Engineering\n\nTeaching\n\nBanking\n\nGovernment\n\nAgriculture\n\nProfession North Carolina\n\nNevada\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMichigan\n\nVermont\n\nNew York\n\nColorado\n\nTexas\n\nCalifornia\n\nFigure 1.20 A pictogram to illustrate inflation.\n\nThe value of your money today\n\nThe value of your money tomorrow\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nPictograms A pictogram is a picture, icon, or sketch that represents quantitative data but in a categorical, qualitative, or comparative manner. For example, a coin might be shown divided into sections indicating that portion of sales revenues that go to taxes, operating costs, profits, and capital expenditures. Magazines such as Business Week, Time, or Newsweek make heavy use of pictograms.\n\n23\n\nPictograph is another term often employed for pictogram. Figure 1.20 gives an example of how inflation might be represented by showing a large sack of money for today, and a smaller sack for tomorrow. Attention must be made when using pictograms as they can easily distort the real facts of the data. For example in the figure given, has our money been reduced by a factor of 50%, 100%, or 200%? We cannot say clearly. Pictograms are not covered further in this textbook.\n\nNumerical data Numerical data is most often univariate, or data with a single variable, or bivariate which is information that has two related variables. Univariate data can be converted into a frequency distribution that groups the data into classes according to the frequency of occurrence of values within a given class. A frequency distribution can be simply in tabular form, or alternatively, it can be presented graphically as an absolute, or relative frequency, histogram. The advantage of a graphical display is that you see clearly the quantity, or proportion of information, that appear in defined classes. This can illustrate key information such as the level of your best, or worst, revenues, costs, or profits. A histogram can be converted into a frequency polygon which links the midrange of each of the classes. The polygon, either in absolute or relative form, gives the pattern of the data in a continuous form showing where major frequencies occur. An extension of the frequency distribution is the less than, or greater than ogive. The usefulness of ogive presentations is that it is visually apparent the amount, or percentage, that is more or less than certain values and may be indicators of performance. A stem-and-leaf display, a tool in EDA, is a frequency distribution where all data values are displayed according to stems, or leading values, and leaves, or trailing values of the data. The commonly used line graph is a graphical presentation of bivariate data correlating the x variable with its y variable. Although we use the term line graph, the display does not have to be a straight line but it can be curvilinear or simply a line that is not straight!\n\nCategorical data Categorical data is information that includes qualitative or non-quantitative groupings. Numerical data can be represented in a categorical form where parts of the numerical values are put into a category such as product type or geographic location. In statistical analysis a common tool using categorical responses is the questionnaire, where respondents are asked\n\nChapter Summary\n\nThis chapter has presented several tools useful for presenting data in a concise manner with the objective of clearly getting your message across to an audience. The chapter is divided into discussing numerical and categorical data.\n\n24\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nopinions about a subject. If we give the categorical response a numerical score, a questionnaire can be easily analysed. A pie chart is a common visual representation of categorical data. The pie chart is a circle where portions of the “pie” are usually named categories and a percentage of the complete data. The whole circle is 100% of the data. A vertical histogram can also be used to illustrate categorical data where the x scale has a name, or label, and the y-axis is the amount or proportion of the data within that label. The vertical histogram can also be shown as a parallel or side-by-side histogram where now each label contains data say for two or more periods. In this way a comparison of changes can be made within named categories. The vertical histogram can be shown as a horizontal bar chart where it is now the y-axis that has the name, or label, and the x-axis the amount or proportion of data within that label. Similarly the horizontal bar chart can be shown as a parallel bar chart where now each label contains data say for two or more periods. Whether to use a vertical histogram or a horizontal bar chart is really a matter of personal preference. A visual tool often used in auditing or quality control is the Pareto diagram. This is a combination of vertical bars showing the frequency of occurrence of data according to given categories and a line graph indicating the accumulation of the data to 100%. When data falls into several categories the information can be represented in a crossclassification or contingency table. This table indicates the amount of data within defined categories. The cross-classification table can be converted into a stacked histogram according the desired categories, which is a useful graphical presentation of the various classifications. Finally, this chapter mentions pictograms, which are pictorial representations of information. These are often used in newspapers and magazines to represent situations but they are difficult to rigorously analyse and can lead to misrepresentation of information. No further discussion of pictograms is given in this textbook.\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\nEXERCISE PROBLEMS 1. Buyout – Part I Situation Carrefour, France, is considering purchasing the total 50 retail stores belonging to Hardway, a grocery chain in the Greater London area of the United Kingdom. The profits from these 50 stores, for one particular month, in £’000s, are as follows.\n\n8.1 9.3 10.5 11.1 11.6 10.3 12.5 10.3 13.7 13.7\n\n11.8 11.5 7.6 10.2 15.1 12.9 9.3 11.1 6.7 11.2\n\n8.7 10.7 10.1 11.1 12.5 9.2 10.4 9.6 11.5 7.3\n\n10.6 11.6 8.9 9.9 6.5 10.7 12.7 9.7 8.4 5.3\n\n9.5 7.8 8.6 9.8 7.5 12.8 10.5 14.5 10.3 12.5\n\nRequired 1. Illustrate this information as a closed-ended absolute frequency histogram using class ranges of £1,000 and logical minimum and maximum values for the data rounded to the nearest thousand pounds. 2. Convert the absolute frequency histogram developed in Question 1 into a relative frequency histogram. 3. Convert the relative frequency histogram developed in Question 2 into a relative frequency polygon. 4. Develop a stem-and-leaf display for the data using the thousands for the stem and the hundreds for the leaf. Compare this to the absolute frequency histogram. 5. Illustrate this data as a greater than and a less than ogive using both absolute and relative frequency values. 6. After examining the data presented in the figure from Question No. 1, Carrefour management decides that it will purchase only those stores showing profits greater than £12,500. On this basis, determine from the appropriate ogive how many of the Hardway stores Carrefour would purchase?\n\n2. Closure Situation A major United States consulting company has 60 offices worldwide. The following are the revenues, in million dollars, for each of the offices for the last fiscal year. The average\n\n25\n\n26\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nannual operating cost per office for these, including salaries and all operating expenses, is $36 million.\n\n49.258 34.410 38.850 41.070 42.920 38.110 46.250 38.110 50.690 50.690\n\n43.660 54.257 28.120 37.740 59.250 47.730 34.410 41.070 24.790 41.440\n\n32.190 39.590 60.120 41.070 46.250 34.040 42.653 35.520 42.550 27.010\n\n39.220 42.920 37.258 54.653 24.050 39.590 46.990 35.890 31.080 20.030\n\n35.150 33.658 31.820 36.260 27.750 69.352 38.850 53.650 42.365 46.250\n\n29.532 37.125 25.324 29.584 62.543 58.965 46.235 59.210 20.210 33.564\n\nAs a result of intense competition from other consulting firms and declining markets, management is considering closing those offices whose annual revenues are less than the average operating cost.\n\nRequired In order to present the data to management, so they can understand the impact of their proposed decision, develop the following information. 1. Present the revenue data as a closed-end absolute frequency distribution using logical lower and upper limits rounded to the nearest multiple $10 million and a class limit range of $5 million. 2. What is the average margin per office for the consulting firm before any closure? 3. Present on the appropriate frequency distribution (ogive), the number of offices having less than certain revenues. To construct the distribution use the following criterion: ● Minimum on the revenue distribution is rounded to the closet multiple of $10 million. ● Use a range of $5 million. ● Maximum on the revenue distribution is rounded to the closest multiple of $10 million. 4. From the distribution you have developed in Question 3, how many offices have revenues lower than $36 million and thus risk being closed? 5. If management makes the decision to close that number of offices determined in Question 3 above, estimate the new average margin per office.\n\nChapter 1: Presenting and organizing data\n\n3. Swimming pool Situation A local community has a heated swimming pool, which is open to the public each year from May 17 until September 13. The community is considering building a restaurant facility in the swimming pool area but before a final decision is made, it wants to have assurance that the receipts from the attendance at the swimming pool will help finance the construction and operation of the restaurant. In order to give some justification to its decision the community noted the attendance each day for one particular year and this information is given below.\n\n869 678 835 845 791 870 848 699 930 669 822 609\n\n755 1,019 630 692 609 798 823 650 776 712 651 952\n\n729 825 791 830 878 507 769 780 871 732 539 565\n\n926 843 795 794 778 763 773 743 759 968 658 869\n\n821 940 903 993 761 764 919 861 580 620 796 560\n\n709 826 790 847 763 779 682 610 669 852 825 751\n\n1,088 750 931 901 726 678 672 582 716 749 685 790\n\n785 835 869 837 745 690 829 748 980 860 707 907\n\n830 956 878 755 874 1,004 915 744 724 811 895 621\n\n709 743 808 810 728 792 883 680 880 748 806 619\n\nRequired 1. Develop an absolute value closed-limit frequency distribution table using a data range of 50 attendances and, to the nearest hundred, a logical lower and upper limit for the data. Convert this data into an absolute value histogram. 2. Convert the absolute frequency histogram into a relative frequency histogram. 3. Plot the relative frequency distribution histogram as a polygon. What are your observations about this polygon? 4. Convert the relative frequency distribution into a greater than and less than ogive and plot these two line graphs on the same axis. 5. What is the proportion of the attendance at the swimming pool that is 750 and 800 people? 6. Develop a stem-and-leaf display for the data using the hundreds for the stem and the tens for the leaves. 7. The community leaders came up with the following three alternatives regarding providing the capital investment for the restaurant. Respond to these using the ogive data. (a) If the probability of more than 900 people coming to the swimming pool was at least 10% or the probability of less than 600 people coming to the swimming\n\n27\n\n28\n\nStatistics for Business\n\npool was not less than 10%. Under these criteria would the community fund the restaurant? Quantify your answer both in terms of the 10% limits and the attendance values. (b) If the probability of more than 900 people coming to the swimming pool was at least 10% and the probability of less than 600 people coming to the swimming pool was not less than 10%. Under these criteria would the community fund the restaurant? Quantify your answer both in terms of the 10% limits and the attendance values. (c) If the probability of between 600 and 900 people coming to the swimming pool was at least 80%. Quantify your answer.\n\n4.

Case: Soccer Situation When an exhausted Chris Powell trudged off the Millennium stadium pitch on the afternoon of 30 May 2005, he could not have been forgiven for feeling pleased with himself. Not only had he helped West Ham claw their way back into the Premiership league for the 2005–2006 season, but the left back had featured in 42 league cup and play off matches since reluctantly leaving Charlton Athletic the previous September. It had been a good season since opposition right-wingers had been vanquished and Powell and Mathew Etherington had formed a formidable left-sided partnership. If you did not know better, you might have suspected the engaging 35-year old was a decade younger.9 For many people in England, and in fact, for most of Europe, football or soccer is their passion. Every Saturday many people, the young and the not-so-young, faithfully go and see their home team play. Football in England is a huge business. According to the accountants, Deloitte and Touche, the 20 clubs that make up the Barclay’s Bank sponsored English Premiership league, the most watched and profitable league in Europe, had total revenues of almost £2 billion ($3.6 billion) in the 2003–2004 season. The best players command salaries of £100,000 a week excluding endorsements.10 In addition, at the end of the season, the clubs themselves are awarded price money depending on their position on the league tables at the end of the year. These prize amounts are indicated in Table 1 for the 2004–2005 season. The game results are given in Table 2 and the final league results in Table 3 and from these you can determine the amount that was awarded to each club.11 9\n\nAizlewood, J., Powell back at happy valley, The Sunday Times, 28 August 2005, p. 11.

compare the cost of living worldwide? An innovative way is to look at the prices of a McDonald’s Big Mac in various countries as The Economist has being doing since 1986. Their 2005 data is given in Table 2.1.1 From this information you might conclude that the Euro is overvalued by 17% against the $US; that the cost of living in Switzerland is the highest; and that it is cheaper to live in Malaysia. Alternatively you would know that worldwide the average price of a Big Mac is $2.51; that half of the Big Macs are less than $2.40 and that half are more than $2.40; and that the range of the prices of Big Macs is $3.67. These are some of the characteristics of the prices of data for Big Macs. These are some of the properties of statistical data that are covered in this chapter.\n\n1\n\n“The Economist’s Big Mac index: Fast food and strong currencies”, The Economist, 11 June 2005.\n\n2\n\n46\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nTable 2.1\n\nPrice of the Big Mac worldwide.\n\nCountry Argentina Australia Brazil Britain Canada Chile China Czech Republic Denmark Egypt Euro zone Hong Kong Hungary Indonesia Japan Malaysia\n\nPrice ($US) 1.64 2.50 2.39 3.44 2.63 2.53 2.27 2.30 4.58 1.55 3.58 1.54 2.60 1.53 2.34 1.38\n\nCountry Mexico New Zealand Peru Philippines Poland Russia Singapore South Africa South Korea Sweden Switzerland Taiwan Thailand Turkey United States Venezuela\n\nPrice ($US) 2.58 3.17 2.76 1.47 1.96 1.48 2.17 2.10 2.49 4.17 5.05 2.41 1.48 2.92 3.06 2.13\n\nChapter 2: Characterizing and defining data\n\nLearning objectives After you have studied this chapter you will be able to determine the properties of statistical data, to describe clearly their meaning, to compare datasets, and to apply these properties in decisionmaking. Specifically, you will learn the following characteristics. ✔ ✔\n\n✔ ✔\n\nCentral tendency of data • Arithmetic mean • Weighted average • Median value • Mode • Midrange • Geometric mean Dispersion of data • Range • Variance and standard deviation • Expression for the variance • Expression for the standard deviation • Determining the variance and the standard deviation • Deviations about the mean • Coefficient of variation and the standard deviation Quartiles • Boundary limit of quartiles • Properties of quartiles • Box and whisker plot • Drawing the box and whisker plot with Excel Percentiles • Development of percentiles • Division of data\n\nIt is useful to characterize data as these characteristics or properties of data can be compared or benchmarked with other datasets. In this way decisions can be made about business situations and certain conclusions drawn. The two common general data characteristics are central tendency and dispersion.\n\nCentral Tendency of Data The clustering of data around a central or a middle value is referred to as the central tendency. The central tendency that we are most familiar with is average or mean value but there are others. They are all illustrated as follows.\n\nArithmetic mean The arithmetic mean or most often known as the mean or average value, and written by –x, is the most common measure of central tendency. It is\n\n2\n\n“On top of the world – In its taste for risk, the world’s leading investment bank epitomises the modern financial system”, The Economist, 29 April 2006, p. 9.\n\ndetermined by the sum of the all the values of the observations, x, divided by the number of elements in the observations, N. The equation is, x\n\n∑x\n\n2(i)\n\nN\n\nFor example, assume the salaries in Euros of five people working in the same department are as in Table 2.2. The total of these five values is €172,000 and 172,000/5 gives a mean value of €34,400. (On a grander scale, Goldman Sachs, the world’s leading investment bank reports that the average pay-packet of its 24,000 staff in 2005 was $520,000 and that included a lot of assistants and secretaries!2) The arithmetic mean is easy to understand, and every dataset has a mean value. The mean value in a dataset can be determined by using [function AVERAGE] in Excel.\n\nTable 2.2\n\nArithmetic mean.\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\nJohn\n\nHelen\n\nRobert\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n35,000\n\n20,000\n\n27,000\n\n47\n\n48\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nTable 2.3\n\nArithmetic mean not necessarily affected by the number values.\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\nJohn\n\nHelen\n\nRobert\n\nBrian\n\nDelphine\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n35,000\n\n20,000\n\n27,000\n\n34,000\n\n34,800\n\nNote that the arithmetic mean can be influenced by extreme values or outliers. In the above situation, John has an annual salary of €35,000 and his salary is currently above the average. Now, assume that Susan has her salary increased to €75,000 per year. In recalculating the mean the average salary of the five increases to €39,400 per year. Nothing has happened to John’s situation but his salary is now below average. Is John now at a disadvantage? What is the reason that Susan received the increase? Thus, in using average values for analysis, you need to understand if it includes outliers and the circumstance for which the mean value is being used. The number of values does not necessarily influence the arithmetic mean. In the above example, using the original data, suppose now that Brian and Delphine join the department at respective annual salaries of €34,000 and €34,800 as shown in Table 2.3. The average is still €34,400.\n\nWeighted average The weighted average is a measure of central tendency and is a mean value that takes into account the importance, or weighting of each value in the overall total. For example in Chapter 1 we introduced a questionnaire as a method of evaluating customer satisfaction. Table 2.4 is the type of questionnaire used for evaluating customer satisfaction. Here the questionnaire has the responses of 15 students regarding satisfaction of\n\na course programme. (Students are the customers of the professors!) The X in each cell is the response of each student and the total responses for each category are in the last line. The weighted average of the student response is given by, Weighted average ∑\n\nNumber of responses * score Total responses\n\nFrom the table we have, Weighted average\n\n2 * 11 * 21 * 3 5 * 4 6 * 5 3.80 15\n\nThus using the criterion of the weighted average the central tendency of the evaluation of the university programme is 3.80, which translates into saying the programme is between satisfactory and good and closer to being good. Note in Excel this calculation can be performed by using [function SUMPRODUCT]. Another use of weighted averages is in product costing. Assume that a manufacturing organization uses three types of labour in the manufacture of Product 1 and Product 2 as shown in Table 2.5. In making the finished product the semi-finished components must pass through the activities of drilling, forming, and assembly before it is completed. Note that in these different activities the hourly wage rate is different. Thus to calculate the correct average cost of\n\nChapter 2: Characterizing and defining data\n\nTable 2.4\n\nWeighted average.\n\nCategory\n\nVery poor 1\n\nScore Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 Student 4 Student 5 Student 6 Student 7 Student 8 Student 9 Student 10 Student 11 Student 12 Student 13 Student 14 Student 15\n\nTotal\n\nGood\n\nVery good\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 X\n\nX X X\n\n1 X X X X\n\nX X X X X X 2\n\n1\n\n$10.50 $12.75 $14.25\n\n1\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTotal responses 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 15\n\nIf simply the average hourly wage rate was used, the hourly labour cost would be:\n\nWeighted average.\n\nLabour Hourly operation wage rate Drilling Forming Assembly\n\nSatisfactory\n\nX\n\nTotal responses\n\nTable 2.5\n\nPoor\n\nLabour Labour hours/unit hours/unit Product A Product B 2.50 3.00 1.75\n\n1.50 2.25 2.00\n\n7.25\n\n5.25\n\nlabour per finished unit, weighted averages are used as follows: Product A, labour cost, $/unit is $10.50 * 2.50 12.75 * 3.00 14.25 * 1.75 $89.44 Product B, labour cost, $/unit is $10.50 * 1.50 12.75 * 2.25 14.25 * 2.00 $72.94\n\n10.50 12.75 14.25 $12.50/hour 3 Then if we use this hourly labour cost to determine unit product cost we would have, Product A Product B\n\n12.50 * 7.25 $90.63/unit $12.50 * 5.75 $71.88/unit\n\nThis is an incorrect way to determine the unit cost since we must use the contribution of each activity to determine the correct amount.\n\nMedian value The median is another measure of central tendency that divides information or data into two equal parts. We come across the median when we talk about the median of a road. This is the white line that divides the road into two parts such that there is the same number of lanes on\n\n49\n\n50\n\nStatistics for Business\n\nTable 2.6 9\n\n13\n\nTable 2.7 6\n\n7\n\nMedian value – raw data. 12\n\n7\n\n6\n\n11\n\nTable 2.8 12\n\nMedian value – salaries.\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\nJohn\n\nHelen\n\nRobert\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\n35,000\n\n20,000\n\n27,000\n\nMedian value – ordered data. 9\n\n11\n\n12\n\n12\n\n13\n\none side than on the other. When we have quantitative data it is the middle value of the data array or the ordered set of data. Consider the dataset in Table 2.6. To determine the median value it must first be rearranged in ascending (or descending) order. In ascending order this is as in Table 2.7. Since there are seven pieces of data, the middle, or the median, value is the 4th number, which in this case is 11. The median value is of interest as indicates that half of the data lies above the median, and half below. For example, if the median, price of a house in a certain region is $200,000 then this indicates that half of the number of houses is above $200,000 and the other half is below. When n, the number of values in a data array is odd, the median is given by, n 1 2\n\n2(ii)\n\nThus, if there are seven values in the dataset, then the median is (7 1)/2 or the 4th value as in the above example. When n, the number of values, is even, the median value is the average of the values determined from the following relationship: n 2\n\nand\n\n(n 2) 2\n\n2(iii)\n\nWhen there are 6 values in a set of data, the median is the value of 6/2 and (6 2)/2 or the linear average of the 3rd and 4th value.\n\nTable 2.9\n\nMedian value – salaries ordered.\n\nHelen\n\nRobert\n\nJohn\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\n20,000\n\n27,000\n\n35,000\n\n40,000\n\n50,000\n\nTable 2.10 Median value – salaries unaffected by extreme values. Helen\n\nRobert\n\nJohn\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\n20,000\n\n27,000\n\n35,000\n\n40,000\n\n75,000\n\nThe value of the median is unaffected by extreme values. Consider again the salary situation of the five people in John’s department as in Table 2.8. Ordering this data gives Table 2.9. John’s salary is at the median value. Again, if Susan’s salary is increased to €75,000 then the revised information is as in Table 2.10. John still has the median salary and so that on this basis, nothing has changed for John. However, when we used the average value as above, there was a change. The number of values affects the median. Assume Stan joins the department in the example above at the same original salary as Susan. The salary values are thus as Table 2.11. There is an even number of values in the dataset and now the median is (35,000 40,000)/2 or €37,500. John’s salary is now below the median. Again, nothing has happened\n\nChapter 2: Characterizing and defining data\n\nTable 2.11 Median value – number of values affects the median. Helen\n\nRobert\n\nJohn\n\nEric\n\nSusan\n\nTable 2.12 Mode – that value that occurs most frequently. Stan\n\n20,000 27,000 35,000 40,000 50,000 50,000\n\nto John’s salary but on a comparative basis it appears that he is worse off! The median value in any size dataset can be determined by using the [function MEDIAN] in Excel. We do not have to order the data or even to take into account whether there is an even or odd number of values as Excel automatically takes this into consideration. For example, if we determine the median value of the sales data given in Table 1.1, we call up [function MEDIAN] and enter the dataset. For this dataset the median value is 100,296.\n\nMode The mode is another measure of central tendency and is that value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It is of interest because that value that occurs most frequently is probably a response that deserves further investigati"
