        "text": "Technological advances are making an enormous impact on the combat environment. Greater weapons precision and vehicle mobility are changing the nature of combat operations. New sensors and electronic data processing give commanders a wholly new and unique view of the battle area. Micro-electronic communication systems provide new flexibility for command and control. Changes in technology will generate new tactics, doctrine and, ultimately, new views of combat, war and conflict. There have been notable recent efforts to “re-think” combat doctrine to anticipate and reflect the impact of technology. One such effort is the Army field manual, FM 100-5 Operations. There are problems with this initial attempt at a new view of combat, some involving intelligence and operations, outlined here. Our changing views of combat will eventually have to deal with these. One major problem involves what we are doing and should do to improve our ability to estimate enemy intentions.\n\nWhen Igor Gouzenko defected in September 1945, be brought with him a package of documents, supplemented by what he carried in his memory, that gave a clear picture of the types of agents Soviet military intelligence was tasked to recruit and the information the GRU sought from them. Historians differ on the role Gouzenko and his revelations played at the outset of the Cold War, some seeing it as pivotal, while others pay little attention to it at all. This article sits between those two poles to explore the question: what insights did Gouzenko's revelations give about GRU priorities--and thence Soviet priorities--at the end of World War II? This article examines the categories of information that the GRU sought, including military, science and technology, and political information. GRU collection of this information, the sources it targeted for recruitment, and the urgency it placed on clandestinity of handling those sources, revealed the military and political intelligence the Soviet Union sought to fight the next war. Taken together, Gouzenko's material showed a Soviet Union that was preparing for war against the United States and Great Britain even before World war II ended.\n\nLeaders use their state intelligence systems to supply the information they need to achieve their high-priority strategic objectives. Hence, by looking at the activities of a state’s intelligence system and asking why certain intelligence capabilities are tasked to collect what they collect, an analyst can glean the priorities that form the core of strategic information needs. Understanding a country’s fundamental national security objectives or a non-state actor’s organizational objectives is both a prerequisite to, and a product of, effective counterintelligence work. Counterintelligence is the intelligence discipline that monitors a competing state’s intelligence activities. Consequently, counterintelligence activities are often good sources of information about a country’s or non-state actor’s strategies and priorities, either directly through penetration of an intelligence service, or indirectly through reflections projected by the target of a counterintelligence activity.\n\nThe effort to get classified information from inside the adverse camp was the main objective of both super powers involved in the Cold War. Both the USA and the USSR tried, by all means at their disposal, to be one step ahead of the opponent by knowing their capabilities and adverse plans. This paper approaches the manner in which intelligence-gathering specialized structures from both camps were involved in collecting data and intelligence to win the information battle during the Cold War"
