        "text": "A website is like one big puzzle. The final effect depends on how precisely the separate pieces fit together. In its study, ISOWQ breaks down a web page into these pieces, and analyses each component separately.\n\nISOWQ analyses whether a domain and IP address is a spam spreader. Information about possible risks is very important for the website owner as they will be able to take appropriate steps to rectify the problem. Servers hosting personal or corporate websites that are classified as a source of spam can cause many complications. E-mailing can be severely affected when messages sent to potential business partners do not reach them, being automatically rejected by the recipient's server. When analysing domain data ISOWQ also determines its geo-localization. It specifies exactly where the website is hosted and what the geographic location on the map is.\n\nISOWQ performs a detailed analysis of HTML code, meta tags, graphics and multimedia files, and social network applications. When analysing HTML code it retrieves information about the author from the \"author\" meta tag, copyright details from the \"copyright\" meta tag, and the program/system that was used to build the website from the \"generator\" meta tag. Text and graphic elements also play a part. Text content is one of the most important elements of a page, being often the main purpose for creating a website. ISOWQ searches fo appropriate keywords and determines the most optimal ones.\n\nISOWQ calculates the percentage of substantive content in relation to the entire HTML code. The substantive content is marked as \"Text Zone\", while the size of the entire text is marked as \"Text Size\". The HTML tags give directions to robots how to display a page, and how to describe and format data."
