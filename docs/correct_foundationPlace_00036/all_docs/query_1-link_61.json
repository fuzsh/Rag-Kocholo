INTRODUCTORY. The first word of Volume xi. of the Scottish Antiquary must be an Editorial acknowledgment of the services to History and to the study of Antiquities which have been rendered by the Rev. Mr. Hallen, the Founder, and, till now, the Editor of this Magazine. The second is that although Mr. Hallen has devolved the Editorship on other shoulders, he has been kind enough to hold out a good hope that he will continue to contribute to the columns uf the Magazine. The Magazine will continue to be conducted as much as possible on the old lines. And it is hoped that it will continue also to merit in the future the position it has won in the past J. H. Stevenson. NOTES. PORTKAiTS OF THE MARQUIS OF ARGYLL, HIS SON THE NINTH EARL, AND THE FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD DUKES. * I have to tell you, as a fact of personal experience/ wrote Thomas Carlyle to David Laing, * that in all my poor historical investigations it has been, and always is, one of the most primary wants to procure a bodily likeness of the personage inquired after; a good portrait^ if such exists; failing that, even an indifferent if sincere one. In short, any representation, made by a faithful creature, of that face and figure, which he saw with his eyes, and which I can never sec with mine, is now valuable to me . . . All men, just in proportion as they are Historians (whjch every mortal is, who has a memaryy and attachments, and possessions in the Past), will feel something of the same — every human creature something.'* It is a matter, then, of more than mere curiosity or private interest that these * bodily likenesses ' should be carefully identified and correctly named. Before glancing at the portraits of the great historical personages who were successively heads of the House of Argyll from the memorable year of r638 till after the '45, it may be well to recall the relationship of these {personages lo each other. * Letter, 3rd May 1854, fcgarcUng a 'Project of ft Nfttioml Exbibition of Scottish Fortiaits.'

He married hts cousin, Margaret, daughter of William, Earl of Morton. Their eldest son l^ecame the 9th Earl of Argyll. A daughter married the I St Marauis of Lothian, her cousin. Archibald, 9th Earl, b. 1630 (?), was not restored to the Marquisate^ was sentenced to death for treason in 168 1, for refusing to take the Test without rest-rvatiorc ; escaped to Holland; invaded Scotland in 1685; was cap- tured and executed without further trial His first wife, m. 1650, was Mary, daughter of James, 4th Earl of Moray. Their eldest son became the ist Duke. One of their daughters married the 2nd Marquis of T.othian. Archibald, ist Duke, loih Earl, d. 1652. Fled to Holland in 1685 ; returned in 1688 with William of Orange; was created Duke, 1701; ^. 1 703 ; married Elizabeth, daughter of ^izabeth, Countess, in her own right, of Dysart Their soi 1 came the 2nd and 3rd Dukes. Jolm, 2nd Duke, if. loih October 1678; succeeded, 1703; K.T . T-03. I 7 I o ; K.G., 1 7 10 ; created Earl of Greenwich, 1 705 ; Duke of Greenwich, 1 7 19; served under Marlborough; Ambassador and Generalissimo in Spain; a Field Marshal of Qreat Britain ; commanded the Forces of the Government in Scotland in the 1 71 5 ; celebrated by Pope as 'TIu' State's whf»lc thunder Imrn to wicM, » And siliake alike the Senate and the field.* To the readers of The Heart of Midlothian he is known as ' Teanie Deans's ' Duke. He died in 1 743, without male issue, and was succeeded by his brother. His eldest daughter married Francis, Earl of Dalkeith. Archibald, 3rd Duke; appointed in 1710 Lord Justice-General of Scotland : created, during his elder brother's lifetime, in 1706, Earl of Isla, under which title he is best known In history. At Inveraray there are portraits of all of them. There are portraits of seveial of them at Dalkeith House and Newbattle. In Edinburgh there are two portraits — one in the Parliament House, and one. belonging to Messrs. Graves, on loan in the National Portrait Gallery. Both of them are titled 'John, Duke of Argyll and Greenwich.' Other poitiaits of the personages in question are scattered in different places, and there are well known engravings of more than one of them. The lineaments of the Marquis of Argyll are tolerably well ascertained from the agreement of almost all the portraits which are said to represent him. Fig. i is from the full-length portrait at Dalkeith. Oval face, three- quarter left ; high forehead, lone aquiline nose, slightly arched eyebrows, dark eyes, with a slight inward squint; light-brown hair, worn long; rootuttache on lip and tuft on chia He is dressed in black, with a flowing white lace-edged collar, and holds a firelock of some sort in his right hand. A portrait of him (Fig. 2), 'formerly at Inveraray' (J. M. Gray), and believed to have been done by Jamesone, is engraved in Lodge (vii. it). The features here are thinner and the expression more aim. But tM characteristics of the features are otherwise similar, so far as the high fore- head, the arched eyebrows, the inward eyes, the aquiline nose, ctr.. are concerned. The plam white collar he wears spreads over his shoulders. The Inveraray portrait, Fig. 3, which was engraved — ^not a very faithful Digitized by Google f IG. I Fig. 2 Google 4 Tfu Scottish A ntiquary ; engraving — by Lodge (ix. 8) as the 9th Earl, but was exhibited by the Duke in the National Portraits Exhibition of 1868, London (No. 7x1), as the Marquis, is almost identical with the portrait at Newbattle, Fig. 4, which is also considered to represent the Marquis. The latter portrait was exhibited by the Marquis of Lothian in the National Portraits Exhibition of 1884, Edinburgh (No. 76). The lofty forehead, the aquiline nose, the dark (brown) eyes, and long brown (though dark) hair, and above all the inward cast in the eyes correspond with the former portraits. The face now is clean-shaven, however. He is clothed in black, with a plain white collar reaching half way to the shoulder, the ties of which Fig. 3 end in short tassels close under the collar. He wears a black cap. Bullock, in his Life of /amesone, p. 155, considers that the Newbattle portrait (Fig. 4) 'bears every token of being Jamcsone's work.' Jamcsone died in 1644, at which time the Marquis of Argyll was not more than forty-six years of age, but was probably prematurely old. The late Mr. J. M. Gray, in his ' Art Treasures at Newbattle,' which appeared in the columns of the Scottish Leader newspaper, and was afterwards privately printed, 1885, considers the face reproduced here in Fig. 4 is unlike that of Fig. 2, ' but shows substantial resemblance to the small and much injured, but apparently genuine and autlientic panel portrait belonging to Dr. [Sir] William v.oogle or. Northern Notes and Queries. 5 Fraser, which was reproduced in Napier's Li/e of Montrose.' This portrait, to judt^e by the engraving in Napier's work, has the heavy features and squint even more pronounced than they are in the others, the dress and cap are the same, one of the tassels of the collar, however, hangs at the end of a longish string. There is another |x>rtrait at Newbattle, which is believed there to be a |x>rtrait of the Marquis of Arp)'II. It is described bv Mr. Gray as 'figure to waist, clad in black, white slashed doublet, with white baldrick over the shoulder, long fair hair, shaven cheeks, small features, thin li|>s. and in a very marked degree . . . obli(]ue cast of the liitle eyes.' It should l)e mentioned that, like Fig. 3, this portrait was once held to represent the Marquis's son, the 91 h Karl. These portraits assist perhaps to interpret the title l>orne by the Marquis — (iillespie Grumach. They fwrtray him melancholy rather than morose. The 9th l^arl's features, however, were of another cast. There is a contemporary portrait of him, in the shape of an engraving by David Loggan, Fig. 5, which is inscribed by the engraver * Ad vi\\um.' The Northern Notes ami Queries. 7 illustration is taken from the ropy (No. 44 of the Engravings Catalogue) cxhibiteil in the National Portrait (lallery, Kdinburgh. The features of this |K>rtrait arc totally different from those of the group of {mrtraits which have just been considered. The eyes no longer oblique ; nose straight, projecting and blunt at point ; mouth large and straighter. An Inveraray portrait. Fig. 6, titled the 9th Karl, has a considerable resemblance to the IvOirgan engraving. Consequently the Dalkeith p>ortrait (No. 454 of the Exhibition of 1884), Fig. 7, which is almost identical with Fig. 6, may be considered to represent the 9th Karl. It is at present titled the Fig. 7 Marquis. It has long dark brown hair or wig, and dark brownish ryes, and IS clad in armour. {To hf conlinueti. ) the s.w'ox i.ine.xr.e of the m.\\cfarl.\\nes— the pei)I(;rke of wai.ter mackari.ane of that u.k. antiquary and c.knealogist.

The pieces of l)ank paper which our Scottish ancestors, sometimes wisely, sometimes foolishly, took in exchange ic/c th«r siller, have many lines of interest on them — their connection widi the Scottish system of banking from its first beginnings, tlieir money denominations, the temis in which they are couched, the growth of art in the execution of them, the signatures of the financiers which they bear. They figure, most of them, as the emblems of industry and success, some of them as the memorials of recklessness, disaster, and misery. lJut in any case they represented what were valuable portions of a limited capital with which a people, courageous on the whole and wary, laid the foundations of national prosperity and wealth. In the two hundred years which have elai)se(l since the first Scottish banking house opened its doors, Scotland has seen at least ninety-six dis- tinct banking establishments arise, has seen forty-six of them fail or join banks which afterwards failed, thirteen more pass out of existence from un- explained or unexplored reasons, probably insolvency for the most part, six retire voluntarily,^ and twenty-one amalgamate directly or indirectly with one or the other of the remaining ten banks which are still in existence. The Darien Company's Notes. On the 26th of June 1695, \"^^^ Scots Parliament passed an Act {1695 c 8), incorporating ' The Com^xiny of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies.' This was die Company which was to be known, from it greatest and most disastrous enterprise, as 'The Darien Company.' But while its directors were fitting out their ships for their colony at Darien, they were organising a banking establishment at home. Among the books and papers of the Company which now repose in the strong room in the Advocates' Library, are two thin calf'bound untitled folios containing many printed forms intended to have been converted by signature, etc., into ' Bank Notes,' containing also the counterfoils of those which were completed and issued. Hill Burton rektes that when he was preparing his * Darien Papers' (Bannatyne Club, 1S48), the identical copper plate used in printing these blank forms fell out of one of the books. It is > Sec History of Banking in Sfvtlami, by A. W. Kerr, 1884 : TXtf One AimdJMe, by W. Graham, 1886. Digitized by Google 12 Th4 Scottish Antiquary ; probable that it was after this discovery of the plate that a number or impressions on thin bluish modern paper, whicli arc now in tlu; hands of various persons, were taken from it. 1 he plate, returned no doubt to some safe corner of the Library, measures, by its impression, approximately 12^ inches by 8 inches or thereabout Across it are engraved side by side three i(1cn!!(_al forms with counterfoils. The f rms, as may be seen from the page of one of the volumes which is here represented on a reduced scale, has blanks left for the date of issue, the money amount, the first payee's name, and the Company's signature. These forms have an additional interest attaching to them. The character in which they are written is so close a copy of the handwriting of William Faierson, the projector of the Company, that we may assume that the original model given to the engraver came from Paterson's own pen. The manuscript also in the blank spaces is very like Paterson's. The paper on which the forms were printed is ordinary stout paper such as was used by the Coni- j)any for their business books, and bears a not uncommon variety of the post-hom and crown watermark. The present state of the volumes, into which these forms were bound, may be mure fully described. In one volume the first loo furms have been filled up as tive-pound notes, as the writing on their counterfoils testifies. All of them were issued save the last, which was only partially completed, and lies loose in the book. The notes have been separated from their counterfoils by means of a sharp knife. The division has been made m the form of a wavy line. The scroll-work through which the luie runs, is composed of the words Indian Company in more or less mono* gram form. The second loo were set apart for ten-pound notes. Of these only the first 32 and the last note, No. 100, were even partially filled up, and only the first 31 were issued. Then follow 100 forms set apart for the twenty'pound notes. In the other volume 100 are devoted to notes of one hundred pounds, and the fifty pound notes follow. In no case were the fonns set apart for notes in any of the five denominations exhausted. And the entries in the Cash lx;Uger show that the notes taken ftoxn these books were the earliest and only issue. By this Ledger the issues of the Company stood thus : — In all cases, judging by the counterfoils and the partially completed notes still in the books, the date, * 25 June 1696,' and the payee's name, ' Mr. James Dunlop,' are the same. It will be noticed that the form runs in the first person singular. It is dated Edinburgh, but such wordls as 'at our office here' do not occur. The 'option' clause, to be afterwards met with, was not yet invented. The money is in pounds sterling, and there is no place for an alternative computation in Scots money, as there is in several of the small notes issued by the Bank of Scotland and other Scots banks. And as the Cash Ledger reveals, there were no notes below five pounds. But the Darien Company of bitter memory did not retrieve in banking what it lost at the Isthmus of Darien.

If any completed notes of the Company survival which is unlikely, they may be in the Government Archives, remitted thither by the Equivalent Fund Commissioners after the issue of their Certificates in 1709. Earlier Ndits oj the Bank of Scotland. Though the Darien Company was probably the earliest joint stock bank in Scotland, the Bank of Scotland iras the first Company incor porated for the express purpose of banking. On 1 7th July 1 696, somewhat quietly — 'surreptitiously,' said the Darien projector— it had been incor- porated with a twenty-one years' monopoly of banking in Scotland. On the same day that the Soots Parliament passed the Act founding the Bank, it jmsed another ' allowing the Administrators of the Common Good of Burrowes to Adventure their Slocks' in the Darien Company. In January 1696, the Bank opened its doors and began to issue notes. These were for the same amounts as the notes already mentioned which the older company issued a few months after, and which comprised no note for a smaller amount than ^5. The One-Pound Note, now the popular emblem of the Scots banking system, was thus by no means contemporary in its beginning with Scots banking. There is a doubt as to the exact time of it appearance. It is stated most circumstantially, by the anonymous author of An Historical Account oJ t/u Establishment y Progress^ etc.^ of the Bank (Edinr. 1727), that the note was issued in 1699, and at once became of great con- venience both in Edinburgh and in the country. But Mr. Kinnear, one of the Bank Directors, sn^ s in iiis r\\ i'lLnre before a l\\i rliam en tary Com- mittee m 1826, that the one-poumi note was issued lor the first time in 1 704. Previous to that date, he says, several proposals for the issue of 'tickets' [bank-notes], stamped brass coins, and wooden tallies, for amounts below ^('5, had been proposed, but had been rejected. The author of the History of tlie One-Found Note is inclined to credit the account given by the writer of 1727. He suggests that the first note for twelve pounds Scots may be said to have been issued in 1704, without invalidatini; the statement that a 20s. note in sterling money was issued in 1699. No such argument, however, can be founded on the phraseology of the writers of those times, to the effect of proving that wlien they talked of a or aos. note, the note itself was really marked anything else but * twelve pounds Scots.' In a very few years after the Bank began to issue notes, it discovered that they were liable tn be tampered with. The five-pound note was found capable of being made to read fifty pounds. The foiiger, a man Macghie, fled the countr3fv and the Bank engraved a new set of plates calculated to prevent a repetition of such a fraud. But in 1710 the new one pound, or, let us say, the twelve {)ounds Scots note, was copied by a teacher — a cripple weaver, by another account — at Hamilton. This was a kind of forgery more diflScult to guard against than the former kind. If a sp'-riiDPn survives of any one of the notes of the Bank of an issue earlier than 1716, it must be very rare, if not unique. It would be in- teresting to see the first one-pound notes, the pound notes of 1704, which Avere s( arcdy is!,ued when they were returned in the panic of that year which caused the Bank to stop payment for a time, and to allow interest on Digitized by Google 14 The Scottish Antiquary ; its notes from the date of its stoppage ; or the notes used against — if really against — the Bank in the mysterious run of 1715, while the Bank was being accused of favouring the Rebellion. The earliest Bank of Scotland note available for representation is the ' Twelve pounds Scots ' note of 1 6th April 17 16. And this representation is got only at second-hand. It is taken from a contemporary forgery which is the only presentment of the note now in the possession even of the Bank itself. Less apology, however, need be made for taking a contemporary forger's version for the general appearance of a bank note, than for taking that of an ordinary GoveB«{§>bia<5( Company of tKe£[>JV^^ Scotland ^i\\3X,t^riJ[^o^ Parliament I®icrcty oblige hemrelv4§<^ay to ^'couii C^^>^CC^ot the T^lve pounds ScotS^^n^mand copyist, however artistic and conscientious, who does not mean to deceive. In this 1716 note, which was doubtless to circulate more freely than the larger notes among the common people, there is no reference to sterling money, save in the selection of the number of Scots pounds, which was equal to the unit in pounds sterling. This seems to have l)een held to be sufficient compliance with Article XVI. of the Treaty of Union, which enacted that the coin should be ' of the same standard and value throughout the United Kingdom as now in England.' The notes of 1716, and presumably the notes of the earlier issues of the Bank of Scotland, appear to have been bound, like the Darien notes, or. Northern Notes and Queries. 15 in book form, each note being separated by a knife or scissors, from its counterfoil, through a piece of scroll-work or cypher. This cypher consists of three words in separate monograms, and reads Scots — Edinburgh — Bank. The word Edinburgh — perhaps it is Edenburgh — is impressed without ink, but, in this case, whether it is intended for a water-mark, or merely a new way adopted by the Bank of printing from an old plate, cannot be deter- mined by a study of a forged copy of the note. There is nothing like a watermark anywhere else in the copy before us. Part of the circular out- line of the Bank seal is visible. In the date at the top of the note the spelling Edenburgh is adopted. I'he date and amount of the note are printed, an advance beyond the Darien form which the Bank made at pro- bably a very early stage of its career. We may assume that it was this note which was made the subject of the forgery of January 1723. On June 24lh, 1723, the Bank issued a new twelve pound Scots note. It was a great improvement over the former note, in so far that it provided i6 The Scottish Antiquary ; more difficulties for the forger to surmount, lx>th in labour and skill. In addition to the Roman characters, Italics, and Script of the note of 1716, it has one or two words in old Knghsh, and a word in charter hand. The lines are fmer, and there are some ornamental flourishes. The monograms, ScotSy and Hank are on a groundwork of parallel lines. The word Edin- burgh is now in ink. A water mark, consisting of the words Bank of Scotland in Roman capitals, runs along Ix-tween the Accomplanl's and Treasurer's signatures. The siHximen of this note from which the illustra- tion is taken is m the |><»v»cssion of the .Sx icty of Antu|uaries of Scotland, and is pronounced l»y .Mr. W. (iraham to lie ^lenuinc.

Northern Notes and Queries. 17 These spurious notes are in all likelihood part of the forgery of the ' twenty-shilling notes ' perpetrated in Edinburgh by a man Currie in November 1726, one result of which was that the Bank resolved to call in its notes and substitute a new issue, which should have ' special cheques against forgery.' The Bank of Scotland's notes of 1723 were also, as it happened, among the principal weapons used against it in the great Bank War of 1727-9. The Royal Bank had just received its charter and begun business. Each of the banks now considered the existence of the other to be a menace to its prosperity. The Royal Bank was in a superior position for attack ; it first bought up all the old Bank's notes it could lay its hands on, and then instituted a run which compelled its rival, on 27th March 1728, to suspend payment for a time. There seems to have l>ecn thus the less difficulty in calling in the forgeable notes of 1723; and the thirty-four spurious notes of that year, which are now in the possession of the Bank, are possibly relics also of the nm of 1728. There are quaint incidents in the history of this war. Though the Bank of Scotland had stopped in March 1728, and did not re-open its doors till June at earliest, still it dated a new issue of notes the ' Seven- tenth day of April 1728.' If the twelve pounds Scots note of this date is a specimen of the issue contemplated after the detection of the forgery of November 1726, the 'cheques against forgery 'are neither very apparent, nor were they very successful. There are doubtless some letters with flourishes interlacing with the loops of other letters. But the addition most laborious of imitation is the new embossed seal with the Bank's arms which is impressed on the note. The note from which the illustra- tion is taken is understood at the Bank to have been pronounced a forger)'. The seal appears the most genuine part of it. The 1728 note was succeeded by the note of 4th February 1731, the VOL. XI. — NO. XLI. B .1 i |8 The Scottish A ntiijuary ; last of the twelve |>ounds Scots notes issued by the Hank of Scotland. This note, though much superior to us predecessors, had a short life from another cause than forger)*. The Royal Bank having reverted apain to its policy of harassing the old Hank l>y presenting large numbers of its notes for immediate paj-mcnt, that Bank, in defence, deviswl a new form of note, in which it reserved to itself an option to jwy on demand or to pay, with 2\\ per rent, of interest, six months after demand.

This post he occupied in 1685, f( r .1]): ended to one of the maces is the following inscription, ' Dr. Alexander Skene, Coilegii Sancti Salvatoris nostri propositus me temporis injuria laesum et mutilatum publicis dicti CoUegii sumptibus reparandum curavit An.

His son, for whom apparently the inquiry was being nude, also by name Alexander, was educated at St Andrews, matriculating at St Salvatoi^s CollcLiC there on 26th March 1686. In 1688, though still a minor, he left his studies to join Dundee, for which he was forfeited by a Dcrrcet of rarliament, and obliged to retire abroad. He joined Mar in the rebellion of 17 15, fighting at Sheriffmuir at the head of 500 of his clan, and though taken prisoner, managed to make his escape to France. In the \"45' he was also suspected of being 'out,' but was not convicted. He died at his house at Rannoch in 1749, at the age of 80, and was buried in the Church of Strowan, his funeral, being attended by above 2000 noblemen and gentlemen, showmg the high esteem in which he was held. He was the author of a voiume of poems, published shortly alter hia death, and which Macanlay has described as bdng 'always very stupid and often very profligate.'

Unfortunately only a fragment now remains. R. • Petition of William Fleming to the Secrftary of State. * Humbly shewcth, — That your Petitioner had the honour to serve his Grace the Duke of Athoie before the breaking out of the late unnatural rebellion, and during these unhappy troubles your Petitioner resided at Dunkeld in the shire of Perth in Scotland, whither the person commonly called the Marquis of TuUibardine came with a body of Rebels, and soon after the said Marquis sent a party of armed rebels who seized your Petitioner and carried him prisoner to the castle of Dunkdd. The Marquis then proposed to your Petitioner that he must either inlist as a common soldier in the service of the Pretender's son or enter into his (the Marquis's) as his Gentleman, and your petitioner being imder that necessi^ agreed to serve the Marquis as his Gentleman. ' That your Petitioner, though thus unhappily engaged in the Marquis's service, yet during all the time he continued therein your Petitioner as much as in him lay endeavoured to prevent the Rebels from committing excesses where they passed through ; particularly your Petitioner had the good fortune to save one Mr. Tolmie, Exciseman of Dunkeld, who had been taken up by the Pretender's son, and was threatened to be executed as a Spye, but your Petitioner paid down ^25 sterhng as a security for his appearance when called upon to clear himself of his supposed crime, and Mr. Tolmie was thereupon set at liberty, and by the good offices of your Petitioner was soon after cleared.

All which if required can be attested l)y many of his Majesty's weil-affected subjects, and in particular by the said Mr. Tolmie and Mr. Bisset. ' That upon the 27th of April, after the suppression of the Rebellion, the said Marquis surrendered himself a prisoner to Buchanan of Drumiekill, one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace lor the shire of Dumbarton, and at the same time delivered his arms and riding furniture (a list whereof is herewith annexed) to the said Justice to remain in his custody till called Ux. * That in a short time after the said surrender the Marquis was sent to Leitb, and was put on board one of his Majesty's ships for London, where he arrived on the aoth June thereafter, when he was committed to the Tower, where he soon after died a prisoner. ' That at the time of his committment, the Marquis had in his possession plate and other effects to a considerable amount (a list whereof is also an- nexed), which your Petitioner by the Marquis's order delivered to Mr. Fowler, the deputy Master joalcr of the Tower, and were afterwards deposited in the hands of the deputy Lieutenant of the Tower, in whose custody, as your Petitioner is informed, the same still remain. 'That during the time your Petitioner served the Marquis as above he advanced and disbursed money from time to time for the Marquis's use.

The Tower of Corbet is of ancient date, and being situated close on the borders of England, it was the scene, I lielieve, of frequent encounters between the Border inhabitants. It was burnt by the English in 1522, in retaliation of an inroad into Northumberland by Lancelot Ker of Gateshaw. It was rebuilt and again destroyed in 1 545. Gateshaw Brae, which adjoins the Tower, is the place where the Covenanters of the district worshipped. — See JeftVey's History a/Roxburghshire^ vol. iii. pai^es ^^oU and 307. 2\\st May 1896.

The following royal letter to the Scots Privy Council, concerning the Synod of Argyll, ilhistrates, among other things, the working of the change of church government in Scotland at the Revolution. It men- tions also the venture of the Synod in the publishing of the Psalms in Gaelic metre. Is any copy of this version known to exist ? The Synod of Art^yll had been hard at work for some years translating the whole Bible (see Scott s Fasti). Principal Lee, in his memorial for the Bible Societies (1824, p. 903 note), does not seem to be aware of the existence of this letter. A. R. William R.

Special licence from the local ecclesiastical authority to marry without previous publication of the intention of the parties is practically unknown in Scotland (See report of a Ooal Lecture on YwsKiaxA Theology, delivered in Edinbufgh in February last by the Rev. Dr. Mair.) There is, however, an Act of Assembly, i'^'^-^, Sess. 23--4, Art. 21, empowering presbyteries to dispense with proclamation of banns ' in some neoessarie exigents.* One of these *necessarie exigents' arose in 1659 in the case of Mary, Countess of Buccleuch, who was married at the age of eleven years to Walter Scott of Highchester, a boy of fourteen. The Presbytery of Kirkcaldy, probably on a reference from the kirk-session of the parish of the lady's residence, granted a warrant for the performance^ the ceremony of the marriage without banns, on the representation of her guardians that they were apprehensive of an abduction of the Countess by her kinsmen if her matrimonial project became public On an appeal the Presbytery's action was upheld. After the subsequent restoration of the Episcopal ( jovemment of the Church, the bishops granted ' l icences ' in a manner similar apparently to the 'Special Licences' granted by the bishops of England. Bishop Alexander Young of Edinburgh granted such a licence in 1673 in the following terms : — ' K.DlNK , 10/// of di\\i-iiit<cr 1673. *RKVKRbN'D liKOTHBR, — These are upon good considerations and suffi- cient Information, that there is nothing that may justlie imped the pur- posed marriage of William Rae with Jean Rutherford — To desire & authorize yow that ye celebrat the marriage of the forenamed persones at such convenient lyme & church as yow and they shall think most iitt, And that though their banns be not proclaimed, They alwayes paying what is due to the clerk of the Session and the poor in such cases.

Not far from Coldingham-shore, on the elevated ground south of the mouth of the Milldown £urn, there is an isolated mass of vitrified stone about six yatds in circumference, and about five feet high at the centre (these dimensions ate by guess rather than by measurement). The vitrification is not complete, nor uniform through the mass, but is in horuontal layers, as if a layer of small angular stones had been laid about four or five inches deep, then partially vitrified, and a second layer of the same materials placed similarly in position, and then similarly partially vitrified. In no case hns the heat been sufficient to melt a la\\ er of stone through its whole thickness, save at some point where the layer was much thinner than usual. The stones composing the layers do not appear to have been placed in position w ith much, if any, care. On the Ordnance Survey Map this mass of stone called 'The Deil's Dander' — a name which seems to indicate a forgotten origin. The question which first occurs is — Was this vitrification intentional or not? If 'The Deil's Dander' was the hearth of a signal fire, it might have been a practice of the signallers to lay a floor of small stones under the fuel to ensure n draught from below, and to lay a new floor from time to time» when the uiierstices in the old floor became sealed up.

Dancing is a favourite amusement of this country ; but little regard is paid to art or gracefulness; the whule consists in agility and in keeping time to their own tunes, which they do with great mactness. One of the peculiar diversions practised by the gentlemen is the GofT, which requires an equal degree of art and strength ; it is played by a bat and a ball ; the latter is smaller and harder than a cricket ball ; the bat is of a taper construction, till it terminates in the part that strikes the ball ; which is loaded with lead and faced with horn. The diversion itself resembles that of the Mali which was common in England in the middle of the last century.

The diversion of Curling is likewise I bdieve peculiar to the Scots. It is performed upon ice with large flat stones, often from 20 to 200 pounds' weight each, which they hurl from a common stand to a mark at a certain distance ; and whoever b nearest the mark is the victor. These two may be called the standing summer and winter diversions of Scotland.
