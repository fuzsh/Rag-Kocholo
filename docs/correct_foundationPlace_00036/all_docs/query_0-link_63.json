Einhard, who composed his highly popular biography of Charlemagne shortly after the latter’s death (the text has survived in approximately 129 manuscripts, of which 108 date from the Middle Ages), and Notker der Stammler (Notker of St Gall), who completed his Gesta Karoli Magni in c. 855 in St Gall, together laid the foundation for a generally positive image of this ruler, supported by many legendary anecdotes about his personal care for and dedication to the well-being of his country. This image has basically survived until today, despite some critical works produced by clerics who viewed Charlemagne more negatively.1 Notker in particular pursued the strategy of compiling anecdotes and exemplary tales about Charlemagne, apparently with deliberate disregard for chronology.2 Naturally, the corpus of relevant research literature, and also of more popular texts, about Charlemagne and his time, art, literature, religion and so on is legion, and has been produced in a variety of languages.3 As Karen Pratt points out: Steinen, Notker der Dichter und seine geistige Welt; Goetz, Strukturen der spätkarolingischen Epoche im Spiegel der Vorstellungen eines zeitgenössischen Mönchs; Hageneier, Jenseits der Topik. On Einhard, see the contributions to Eginardo, Vita Karoli, ed. Chiesa. This volume offers the Latin original, an Italian translation and an extensive commentary.

However, the need remains, as ever, for new investigations reflecting innovative theoretical and conceptual models and methods, for we are dealing with a myth based on a historical narrative that has inspired the European imagination throughout the Middle Ages and beyond.6 Myths of historical figures continue to exert their influence on us today, whether we think of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar,7 or Napoleon Bonaparte, or, much less positively, of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.8 Charlemagne stands at the beginning of medieval European history, having been the founder of an empire and hence, deliberately or not, the creator of a myth, both in Germany and France and in other countries on the continent.9 As the personal reflections and anecdotes in De nugis curialum (1181–94), by the English courtier and intellectual Walter Map (b. early 1130s; d. 1209 or 1210), indicate, it was almost natural 4 Pratt, review, http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view /16879/22997 (accessed 7 February 2017). Pratt herself had already worked intensively on this topic: see her introduction to Roland and Charlemagne in Europe, ed. Pratt (1996). 5 Paris, Histoire poétique de Charlemagne. 6 Halphen, Études critiques sur l’histoire de Charlemagne; for more recent studies, see Sholod, Charlemagne in Spain; cf. also the contributions to Charlemagne et l’épopée romane, ed.

This was translated into English as Work on Myth. On the numerous Roland statues in northern Europe from the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, see Pinkus, ‘The Giant of Bremen’. However, Pinkus associates those Roland sculptures mostly with the tradition of protective giants from ancient and medieval times, and dismisses too readily the older scholarly concept of Roland, as Charlemagne’s representative, being a hero who would offer protection and help to the various newly founded cities where he was deeply admired. 7 Taeger, Charisma. 8 Rees, Hitler’s Charisma.

Tihanyi.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nfor all medieval historiographers and chroniclers to insert references to Charlemagne whenever they commented on the past.10 Since the issue of charismatic leadership continues to be of central importance even today, irrespective of the democratic power structures in Western societies, the medieval ruler with his mythical qualities matters deeply for us as well. Likewise, these qualities mattered for medieval rulers. Emperor Otto III searched for Charlemagne’s grave in the Palatine Chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle, or Aachen, and had it opened on the feast of Pentecost in the year 1000 in order to inspect the body of his predecessor and thus to enhance his own political status through a personal association with the long-deceased emperor.11 According to the biographers Thietmar of Merseburg (975–1018), Otto of Lomello (fl. c. 1020–1030) and Adémar de Chabannes (c. 988–1034), Otto III was divinely directed in finding the right spot (anastasis), which associated him with a by-then saintly figure, the founder of the Carolingian Empire, who was himself associated with the relics of Christ’s Passion.12 If we were to seek all the works that contributed to the dissemination of the myth surrounding Charlemagne we would also have to consult the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle from c. 1135, the Descriptio qualiter Karolus magnus clavum et Coronam domini a Constantinopoli Aquisgrani detulerit qualiterque Karlus calvus hec ad sanctum Dionysium retulerit (second half of the eleventh century) and the De sanctitate meritorum et gloria miraculorum beati Karoli Magni ad honorem et laudem nominis dei (that is, the Aachen Vita, composed shortly after Charlemagne’s canonization on 29 December 1165).13 It is little wonder that this mythic veneration of Charlemagne in Latin clerical literature also emerged in late medieval legal literature,14 where he was commonly identified as the originator of the earliest and hence the best laws by, for example, 10 Map, De Nugis Curialium, ed. James, pp. 37, 95, 101, 203 and 225. We learn, for instance: ‘Karolus enim magnus, cum terram illam a Sarracenis conquisisset, omnia preter municiones et castella pro Christo dedit archiepiscopis et episcopis, quos per ciuitates conuersas instituit’ (p. 225; ‘For Charlemagne, when he had won that land from the Saracens, gave everything except the castles and forts for Christ’s sake to the archbishops and bishops whom he had established in all the cities he had converted’); translation from Map, De Nugis Curialim, ed. and trans.

Purkis and Gabriele.\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\n4\n\nthe authors of the Sachsenspiegel (c. 1235) and the Schwabenspiegel (c. 1275). In the second prologue of the former lawbook we read about the laws given first by the prophets, then by ‘the Christian kings, Constantine and Charlemagne’.15 In Book I we also learn of the differences between the laws established by Charlemagne and those followed by the Saxons (p. 74), but this only underscores how greatly the Carolingian ruler was admired even in the thirteenth century as a major lawmaker. The anonymous author of the Schwabenspiegel similarly refers to Charlemagne as the prime lawgiver, as a leader of his people who knew how to judge fairly according to divine laws. The judicial rules and regulations listed here are said to derive from the Carolingian law.16 The formula, in Low German, clearly spells it out: ‘vnde van Karles rechte her komen sint’ (and which [referring to the laws] have come down from Charlemagne’s laws).17 This reference then prompts the writer to recount what he understood to be historical events surrounding Charlemagne, who brought his law to the Swabians after he had defeated the Romans. The Romans were believed to have attacked Pope Leo, in this legendary account erroneously taken to be Charlemagne’s brother, and to have blinded him in both eyes, whereupon Charlemagne defeated them militarily and assumed the throne in Rome. We also hear of the honour which Charlemagne bestowed upon the Swabians by granting them the privilege of fighting in the front line of any of his campaigns, something we will hear much more about in later chapters.18 The author also claims, trying to come up with an explanation for the structure in place at his time, that Charlemagne had created a political system according to which the German princes (Electors) were entitled to elect the king, who then would sit on the throne in Aachen. Once he was anointed by the pope, he would enjoy the rank of emperor: ‘so hat her des riches gewalt vnde keyserlichen namen’ (138r, p. 117; then he wields the authority over the empire and carries the name of emperor).19 These historical references idealizing the founder of the Carolingian Empire find close parallels even in poetic texts in which legal and historical aspects matter, such as in Konrad von Würzburg’s Schwanritter (late thirteenth century) and the song in the tradition of the Meistersinger, ‘Von keiser Karls recht’ (printed in 1493).20 Each time Charlemagne is identified as the avenger of injustice and violence, especially when committed against defenceless courtly ladies. Konrad in particular describes how the ruler arrives to help the duchess of Brabant, widow of Gottfried, The Saxon Mirror, trans. Dobozy, p. 67. Der Schwabenspiegel, ed. Derschka, Ib, p. 24.

In doing so, he creates an anachronistic perspective, probably out of ignorance of the correct historical data. The narrator characterizes Charlemagne as a kind of Roman ruler: ‘rœmscher voget’ (43; Roman governor). But the narrator does not address the military operation; rather, he presents Charlemagne as the universal judge who performs his task as every good ruler is supposed to do (49), inviting everyone with a grievance to come to his court in Nijmegen and raise their issues.21 In fact, the duchess identifies him as a model just ruler: ‘sît iu nie keiser wart gelîch / ûf erden an gerehtekeit’ (304–5; since there has never been an emperor here on earth equal to you in terms of justice). I will return to this important issue later in the discussion of major Middle High German contributions to the myth of Charlemagne in literary terms. Emperor Charles IV, who had originally borne the name ‘Wenzel’ or ‘Wenceslas’, associated himself directly with Charlemagne and had his chronicler Johannes von Marignola create a direct dynastic connection to the Carolingians. In fact, Johannes identified Charles IV as the resurrected Charlemagne: ‘in solio romani imperii resurgeret serenissimus Karolus imperator’ (the most worthy Emperor Charles rose to power in the whole Roman Empire).22\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German Chronicles The focus of the present study is the portrayal of Charlemagne by Dutch and German writers, and hence the further development of the myth surrounding him long after his death. Fictional texts might not be the best medium through which to carry out historical research, but our interest here is not in biographical facts or material aspects relevant to Charlemagne as a historical individual, but rather in people’s perception and general concept of this figure as expressed in heroic epics, courtly romances, ballads and novels, not to mention art works, paintings and other media. Some of those enjoyed considerable popularity, others were less successful, but we can easily recognize that the myth of Charlemagne exerted a strong influence and mattered greatly both in literary imagination and in historiography. Hardly any medieval chronicler or historiographer ignored or neglected to refer to the Frankish king and emperor as the founder of various dynasties, all referring back to him as a mighty source of glory and esteem. The Vita Karoli Magni (c. 1165), which has survived in thirty-four manuscripts, some of which are incomplete, was created for specifically political, or propaganda, purposes to provide a textual background for the canonization of Charlemagne through Frederick I Barbarossa (1152–90).23 Although the author announced that 21 Konrad von Würzburg, Kleinere Dichtungen, ed. Schröder, vol. II; Kokott, Konrad von Würzburg, pp. 17–31. 22 Geith, ‘Karl der Große’, p. 100. 23 Görich, ‘Kanonisation als Mittel der Politik?’ argues that it was not so much the emperor, but rather the canons of the Aachen cathedral and even King Henry II\n\n6\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nhe would focus mostly on the emperor’s religious accomplishments, he still added numerous comments on his wars against the Saxons and the Muslims in Spain. Similarly important were the Marbacher Annalen, composed by Prior Frederick of the convent of St Thomas in Strasbourg, who died in 1201. His work obviously served to support the Hohenstaufen cause amid the imperial conflicts of that time. The chronicler Lampert of Hersfeld (d. 1081) commented in his Libellus de institutione Herveldensis ecclesiae that Emperor Henry III had followed his father on the throne like a second Charlemagne. Humbert of Silva Candida (d. 1061) in his Libri III adversus simoniacos praised Charlemagne as a great role model for a Christian ruler. The same opinion was voiced a few decades later in his Libellus contra invasores et symoniacos et reliquos scismaticos by Cardinal Deusdedit, who supported the Gregorian Reform and looked for a historical model to strengthen his argument. The opposing forces in the universal political struggle of the eleventh century – the struggle between religious and secular power – also referred to Charlemagne, who was appropriated by both sides and emerged as a benchmark for almost contradictory positions. The author of a genealogy of the Landgraves of Thuringia, included in the Chronicle of the Reinhardsbrunn Monastery from the 1340s, remarked: Notandum, quod genus Caroli non ex toto finem habuit, ut dicitur, sed tantum a Romanorum regno finem accepit. Nam, ut in cronicis invenitur, omnes reges Francorum et Germanorum, sed et principes, duces, comites, istarum provinciarum, scilicet in Thuringia, in Bavaria, in Franconia, in Pannonia, in Carinthia, in Bohemia, in Moravia, in Suevia, in Saxonia, in Frisia, in Lotharingia, set et omnes nobiles Alamannorum originem duxerunt a genere Carolum. [It needs to be said that Charlemagne’s lineage did not end completely as it is often said, it ended only in the Roman kingdom. For, according to the chronicles, all the kings of the Franks and the Germans, but also the princes, dukes and counts of those provinces, i.e. Thuringia, Bavaria, Franconia, Pannonia, Carinthia, Bohemia, Moravia, Swabia, Saxony, Friesland, Lorraine, but also all the noble Germans, derive their origins from Charlemagne’s lineage.]24 of England who pushed for this canonization for political reasons strengthening their own cause; see also Salvadó, ‘Performing Sacrality’. 24 Quoted from Bláhová, ‘The Genealogy of the Czech Luxembourgs’, pp. 4–5. For the original text see Genealogia principum Reinhardsbrunnensis, ed. Holder-Egger, pp. 656–8. Bláhová observes, however, that the Luxembourg dynasty under Charles IV and then his two sons commonly referred backwards on their maternal side to the ancient Czech dynasty founded by the first duke, Přemysl the Ploughman, as a more convenient ideological strategy for their own territory in the Slavic east. In a variety of visual art works, such as in Karlstein Castle, on the other hand, the paternal line was still clearly pursued back to Charlemagne. See Bláhová, ‘The Genealogy of the Czech Luxembourgs’, pp. 10–11; see also her study ‘Nachleben Karls des Großen in der Propaganda Karls IV.’.\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nOther chroniclers even included images of the emperor sitting on his throne, as did Ekkehard von Aura in his Chronicon universale from c. 1112–14 (Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Ms. 373, fol. 24r), which he based on the chronicle by Frutolf von Michelsberg.25 The chronicle by Martin of Opava (or Troppau; d. c. 1278/79), the Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum from c. 1260–70, was mostly intended for use in the school classroom, which explains the large number of manuscripts (more than 400). This basically copied and cemented the traditional image of the legendary emperor, and thus became the foundation for countless subsequent chronicles.26 Undoubtedly, and very consistently, this Frankish ruler assumed the function of a political, military and religious role model because of his ‘herrscherliche Gesamtleistung’ (total achievement as a ruler).27 Both literary and chronicle authors collaborated in many ways to propagate this ideal image, as we can clearly observe in, for instance, the Arolser Weltchronik (late fourteenth/early fifteenth century), which relies heavily on The Stricker’s Karl der Große, or in Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Willehalm in the section on the history of the Carolingian Empire (fol. 267va).28 The chronicler was almost more interested in biographical anecdotes than in historical facts, but he reflected thereby the universal fascination which this mythical figure exerted throughout the Middle Ages. This great interest in Charlemagne continued unabated through the centuries. Some 300 years later, almost at the end of the Middle Ages, the famous Nuremberg physician, author and scholar Hartmann Schedel (1440–1514) also dealt with Charlemagne in his Liber chronicarum, or The Nuremberg Chronicle (1493), which confirms that the myth of the famous emperor did not simply fade away by the late Middle Ages, primarily because he enjoyed such central historical significance.29 In Schedel’s text Charlemagne is identified as the king of France – not as the king of the Franks – who ruled for forty-six years (CLXVIIr). His birthplace was Ingelheim, near Mainz, and after his brother Carolomannus’s death he took over his territory as well. He incorporated Aquitaine by means of military force and was then called to Rome by Pope Desiderius, who needed his help against the Langobards, or Lombards. Next Charlemagne had to fight against the Saxons, a rebellious and militant people, as the author comments, against whom only the Frankish ruler could finally achieve a complete victory, which allowed him to force the Saxons to convert to Christianity. 25 Eccardus de Uraugia, Die Chronik des Ekkehard von Aura, trans. Pflüger; see now Pfeiffer, ‘Ekkehard of Aura’.

Brinker-von der Heyde and Wolf, p. 155. 29 Schedel, Liber chronicarum.\n\n8\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nMoreover, Charlemagne then conquered all of Spain (‘Hispania’) and defeated the Bavarian Duke Taxilo (Tassilo). Subsequently he attacked the Huns (‘hunos’, not the Avars, as we know today), which led to the greatest slaughter during Charlemagne’s life: ‘Vnd Carolus hat keinen krieg gefueert darinn mer menschen vmbbracht worden sind. dann ein große mechtige meng der hunier vnd schier die alleredelsten warden erschlagen’ (CLXVIIr; And Charlemagne did not wage any other war in which more people were killed, because a vast number of Huns, especially the most noble ones, was slaughtered). A few paragraphs later Schedel’s narrator explains once again what kingdoms and other territories Charlemagne conquered, which led to his being crowned emperor in 800 (CLXVIIIr). After the catastrophic decline of the Roman Empire, Charlemagne is here glorified as the great individual who succeeded in re-establishing the past glory: ‘den namen vnnd wirdigkeit eins kaisers mit willen vnd frolockung des roemischen volcks emphangen’ (CLXVIIIr; he received the name and the honour of an emperor through the volition and jubilation of the Roman people).30 The narrator then does not hesitate to provide a detailed physical description of the emperor, whom he portrays as a most impressive manly person. It might not be too far-fetched to assume that Albrecht Dürer, also a Nuremberg citizen, looked to this description when he created his painting of Charlemagne in 1510. Following a long narrative tradition, Schedel also emphasizes that Charlemagne enjoyed taking baths in warm spas, wherefore he erected the church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Aachen. Then he remarks: ‘zusambt seiner koeniglichen tugent wz er wolgesprech vnd redper vnd guoter kunst vnderrichtet vil gelert. Er hett bey vil weibern schoene kinder. vnd sunder by Hildegarde seinem gemahel’ (CLXVIIIr; in addition to his royal virtues he demonstrated great eloquence and was well educated in good [important, or useful] arts. He had children with many women, especially with his wife Hildegard). Apparently, for a mythical figure such as Charlemagne, virility demonstrated by the birth of numerous bastards was also highly appreciated, and standard Christian values did not apply. The paragraph concludes with comments on how the emperor finally contracted a fever and passed away – not, however, without first having issued a last will and arranged his line of succession. We could consider many other chronicles, but these few examples suffice to confirm that medieval authors consistently referred to Charlemagne as the founder of the Carolingian Empire, paid him greatest respect and thus contributed to the ongoing growth of the myth of Charlemagne. Schedel’s biographical information does not really differ from that provided by previous chroniclers, but his comments underscore the great importance attributed to Charlemagne even in the late fifteenth century.\n\n30 I have written out all abbreviations in the quotations and translated the superscripta by placing the vowel on the base line.\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nRecent Scholarship on Charlemagne Naturally, we can draw from and engage with a large body of older scholarship focusing on Charlemagne, his time and culture, and also the history of reception. Famous scholars such as Gaston Paris and Robert Folz have already traced the history of the Charlemagne myth throughout medieval Europe.31 Rudolf Köster made the first significant attempt to trace the history of the myth of Charlemagne in medieval German literature, but he emphasized, above all, the national difference between French and German narratives, trying to favour the latter for political reasons – he published his study in 1939 under the rule of the Nazis.32 The Charlemagne theme in medieval Latin literature is addressed by Paul Lehmann’s monograph, and now by the contributors to a specialized volume dedicated to that issue.33 Heinrich Hoffman focused on Charlemagne as a topic in medieval historiography, but limited himself to the period from the early Middle Ages to c. 1250.34 Gerhart Lohse offered a succinct overview and brief discussions of the major texts in medieval German literature where Charlemagne figures, whether as the central protagonist or as a mere reference.35 More recently, Karl-Ernst Geith has presented a critical analysis of Charlemagne in German literary texts from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, including a study of the sources consulted by the German poets. This narrow approach has made it possible for him to pursue many more specific details than ever before, but at the cost of leaving out the reception of the myth into the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.36 Thomas Kraus and Klaus Pabst have collected studies on the representation of Charlemagne in the visual arts, historiography and literature which laid the foundation for this universal myth.37 We can also draw from a compact article contributed by Bert Bastert to the volume Karl der Große, edited by Franz-Reiner Erkens (2001).38 Parallel to Geith, Bernd Bastert has edited a volume dedicated to the image of Charlemagne in the European literature of the Middle Ages. Here we find excellent discussions of how Charlemagne was perceived in Old French and 31 Paris, Histoire poétique de Charlemagne; Folz, Le Souvenir et la légende.

Schilling even explores the fairly thin sprinkling of references to Charlemagne in medieval Arabic historiography.40 Bastert raises the question of why the chansons de geste, where the myth of Charlemagne was most fully developed, did not influence German medieval literature much, but he can only speculate about the deeper reasons for this odd phenomenon (198). He also alerts us to the huge number of Old French texts where this emperor figures very prominently, and this in a rather dialectical fashion, being painted both very positively and very negatively (200–1). Charlemagne appears as an individual chosen by God more to rule over his Christian empire than to lead an army into battle (203). Most recently, Franz Fuchs and Dorothea Klein published the volume Karlsbilder in Kunst, Literatur und Wissenschaft (2015),41 in which the broad spectrum of historical, literary, historiographical and artistic responses to the Frankish ruler receives attention. One group of articles engages with the image of Charlemagne in the early Middle Ages; the second highlights the reception process from around 1200; while the third investigates the development of the myth of Charlemagne from the late eighteenth century to the early twenty-first. Johannes Fried, in particular, observes the curious development of the image of Charlemagne, whose real life and achievements increasingly disappear from collective memory while the name itself – that is, the myth – enjoys considerable popularity in labels for such mundane and trivial objects and institutions as sausages, beer, baby socks, types of tea, wood-processing factories, restaurants, comics and other publications, particularly in the New World.42 But would that not be typical of all great figures, events, texts, sculptures, art or music from the past? And, despite the longevity of the Charlemagne myth, time has not left it entirely unaltered. Recognizing this dilemma, Fried grants that historical knowledge today is fading fast, but he also emphasizes that historical perspectives – such as those on Charlemagne and his works, thoughts, ideals and administrative practices – can also help us today to probe the intricacies of human existence.43 We could consider, for instance, Charlemagne’s extraordinary military successes, his 39 See also other volumes in the ‘Charlemagne: A European Icon’ project: Charlemagne and his Legend in Early Spanish Literature and Historiography, ed. Bailey and Giles; The Legend of Charlemagne in Medieval England, ed. Hardman and Ailes; volumes including Scandinavian with Celtic material (ed.

After all, as Fried underscores, fundamental ideals such as justice, peace, empathy and truth – quite apart from sincere devotion to God – mattered profoundly for this historical figure. Hence, should they not matter for us as well, perhaps even more than ever before? We are, in other words, the avatars of the intellectual elite surrounding and supporting Charlemagne.44 Overall, as Bernd Bastert comments in a more recent article, throughout the Middle Ages Charlemagne emerged as an important but ambivalent figure in medieval French literature, where he was viewed from many different perspectives, whereas the German contemporaries focused much more, though not exclusively, on the saintly emperor and highlighted his direct contact with God, whose instrument he was here on earth.45 But that holds true only if we do not take into consideration the literary examples from the fifteenth century, where the Frankish ruler appears as a rather ridiculous and rancorous figure in some of the German texts. Those fascinating literary works will be discussed at great length in later chapters dedicated to German examples. Finally, we should also mention that Charlemagne appears many times in later narratives, such as in the anonymous Historia von D. Johann Fausten (1587), where the protagonist traverses many parts of Europe and then comments on the city of Aachen, ‘in dieser Statt ist ein gantz Marmelsteiner Tempel / so der groß Keyser Carolus sol gebawt haben / vnd geordnet / as alle seine Nachkommen die Kron darinnen empfangen sollen’ (in this city there is temple all made out of marble, which the great Charlemagne is said to have built who ordered that all his descendants be crowned there).46\n\nTranslatio imperii and Charlemagne To illustrate how the myth-making process worked, and to embark on our first investigation, let us reflect on the verse novella Mauritius von Craûn, where we discover a brief but significant reference to Charlemagne as the founder of European knighthood and chivalry. It might not be possible to trace the specific source used by the anonymous poet, since the myth of Charlemagne was already so well known all over Europe in general and in Germany specifically.47 Yet the message contained in this novella proves to be so symptomatic of the universal phenomenon that it will be worth going into some details here for introductory purposes. The narrative has survived in only one manuscript, the Ambraser Heldenbuch (Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. Vind. Ser. nov. 2663, fols 2va– 5vc), which the Bozen (today in Italian: Bolzano) toll officer Hans Ried copied on behalf of Emperor Maximilian I between 1504 and 1515. However, the original text\n\n44 Ibid., p. 318. 45 Bastert, ‘“der Cristenheyt als nücz kein czelffbott”’. 46 Quoted from Müller, ed., Romane des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts, p. 907. 47 Harvey, Moriz von Craûn and the Chivalric World, pp. 71–2, and passim.\n\n12\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\ndates to the first half of the thirteenth century. We have no idea why Mauritius has not been copied more often or what happened between the time of its creation by an anonymous poet in the first half of the thirteenth century and the time when Ried included it in his massive compilation.48 The central plot of this narrative has little to do with the prologue, in which we hear about the historical development of knighthood from ancient times to the author’s present. However, there are good reasons to interpret the failed love story of Mauritius in light of the message contained in the prologue, since the poet reflects rather sarcastically on the decline of courtly culture.49 Ultimately, this verse novella proves to be so seminal for our understanding of late medieval courtly values because the author develops an intricate and powerful satire in which neither the knightly protagonist, Mauritius, nor his beloved lady, the countess of Beaumunt, emerges as an ideal character. This casts an ominous light on the overall social conditions at that time. The poet emphasizes right from the start that knighthood had its origin in the ancient Greek world but was then destroyed in its ethical foundation as a result of the Trojan War (vv. 12–48, and passim). Once Hector had fallen, the Trojans (whom the poet idealizes as almost everyone else in the Middle Ages did) missed his leadership sorely. This made the decline of knighthood altogether unavoidable. Cowardice and lack of honour set in, both accelerating the disappearance of the ideal (vv. 77ff.). Subsequently, in world-historical terms, Rome rose in power and revived the principles of knighthood, primarily promoted by Julius Caesar, who welcomed them with open arms (vv. 116ff.). However, history is not necessarily progressive, and every empire at one point seems to collapse again, as happened in Rome once the Emperor Nero had assumed the throne (vv. 133ff.). The poet drastically lambasts Nero, who had, indeed, a very negative reputation throughout the Middle Ages, since he demonstrated, as the poet remarks, signs of perversity, homosexuality and insanity. Once Rome had burned down and countless good people had been killed, knighthood had to leave and look for a new home. It found that home in the Carolingian kingdom or empire, which the narrator does not explain in specific terms. However, even there knighthood struggled until Charlemagne himself surfaced: ‘biz aber Karl sider mit kraft / begunde betwingen diu lant’ (vv. 240–1; until Charles with his power began to conquer the land). The two famous figures Olivier and Roland, well known from the Rolandslied, by Priest Konrad (c. 1170; see below), chose knighthood as their companion (vv. 242–3). Once the other warriors observed how much honour these two gained thereby, they followed their model, which increased their reputation altogether (vv. 247–9). 48 Mauritius von Craûn, ed. Reinitzer; see also Mauritius/Moriz von Craûn, ed. Pretzel and Classen; Mauritius/Mauricius von Craûn, ed. Schröder and Klein. 49 Classen, ‘Mauritius von Craûn and Otto von Freising’s The Two Cities’; Classen, ‘Irony in Medieval and Early Modern German Literature’.\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nFinally, the narrator comments that every country greatly improved where the value system of knighthood was adopted: ‘wan diu ir ritterschaft ist guot’ (v. 254; since its knighthood is good). Even though Charlemagne and his accomplishments are not specifically discussed here, he is identified as the ideal figure who understood as much as Julius Caesar did the true value of knighthood, whereas Nero was the very opposite of both of them, being self-centred, narcissistic and perverse. The subsequent events involving Mauritius take place in the Carolingian Empire – or rather, we may assume, based on some historical background, somewhere in north-western France – but the narrative itself uses the reference to Charlemagne and his country as the critical backdrop against which the protagonist’s behaviour and destiny have to be judged. The poet does not return later to his historical references, but the prologue itself sets a clear tone reflecting on the same tradition, idealizing Charlemagne as a glorious ruler of the highest ethical standards. Only when a country is headed by such an ideal leader can there be hope for progress and power, prosperity and happiness. True knighthood, as personified especially by Charlemagne and his paladins, is characterized by extreme generosity, the willingness to risk one’s life for others in need, a drive to pursue the highest ideals in human existence (gloria and honor), and strict respect for women, which also involves the concept of service in love.50 We will subsequently observe how much and how deeply Charlemagne figured generally and specifically in the history of medieval German literature, and hence also in the history of mentality, and German cultural history. When we investigate later verse romances, such as Rudolf von Ems’s Der guote Gêrhart (c. 1220–40), which is loosely based on a historical framework predicated on the time of Emperor Otto I (936–73), we are also told of Charlemagne as a crucial role model.51 Otto’s efforts to be a good Christian are not as well received by God as Gerhard’s were, although he tries as hard as he can to be loved by God and the people, aiming for the highest royal virtues. So he attempts to model his life after the rules and examples set by Charlemagne: ‘begunde minnen sêre / nâch der gerlêrten lêre / die Karlen hôhiu wîsheit / ûf daz gerihte hât geleit’ (vv. 101–4; he strongly endeavoured to follow the learned teachings, which Charles in his deep wisdom had formulated for the court). Of course, the Good Gerhard proves to be a superior individual, as we learn through his life story which he relates to the emperor (that is, to us), but for our purposes here it still matters critically that Otto perceives the model set up by the Frankish ruler to be the ultimate benchmark for the best possible kingship. Although Rudolf did not cover the history of Charlemagne in his world chronicle, in his Guote Gêrhart he indicated at least in passing that he was still very much aware of this mythical character. 50 Fischer, Ritter, Schiff und Dame, pp. 45–51. 51 Rudolf von Ems, Der guote Gêrhart, ed. Asher, p. 56; cf. Ertzdorff, Rudolf von Ems, pp. 160–92. See now Rudolf von Ems, An English Translation of Rudolf von Ems’s ‘Der guote Gêrhart’, trans. Classen, pp. i–xxxiii.\n\n14\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nAs late as 1456 the famous Bavarian court physician, translator, scholar and scientist Johann Hartlieb also included some references to Charlemagne in his highly regarded puoch aller verpoten kunst, ungelaubens und der zaubrey.52 In the section dealing with aeromancy, which the author condemns as superstition (the entire treatise is dedicated to listing the major forms of magical art or ritual, the artes magicae, and then condemning them forcefully), he refers to the history of Charlemagne and discusses briefly how the hero dealt with his Saracen opponents in the mountain pass of the Pyrenees, Roncesvalles. He even quotes a passage from an unspecified source: ‘und Carel wider uß zoch, wie sich der wind uff tett und Ruolannden durch die veind halff ’ (84; and when Charlemagne left again, the wind rose up and helped Roland to get through the enemy lines). But Hartlieb rejects the popular interpretation by the adherents of the ‘manticy’ (84; mantics) that magic was at play then, and he insists instead that all those heroes had been good Christians ‘und nit anders begerten dann seiner genaden’ (84; and did not desire anything else but His [Christ’s] grace). Neither Charlemagne nor Roland nor any of the other heroes had believed in magic, and they had always demonstrated their unwavering and strong faith in God. Undoubtedly, the highly learned Hartlieb, who rendered numerous Latin narratives or treatises into German, must have been familiar with either Priest Konrad’s or The Stricker’s version of the Rolandslied, as this passage proves convincingly.\n\nPilgrimage Writers and Charlemagne Charlemagne was also well known among the wider population throughout the Middle Ages, as the intriguing travelogue, or pilgrimage account, by the Halle Alderman Hans von Waltheym (c. 1422–c. 1479) confirms. He travelled in 1474 from Halle to Provence in order to visit numerous religious sites, especially Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume with its relics of Mary Magdalene, and returned the following year.53 Waltheym took his time to enjoy visits, baths, social contacts and excursions to various religious sites, but his focus remained, ultimately, on the goal of his pilgrimage. Nevertheless, when he visited the monastery (Abbey) of Reichenau on an island situated in Lake Constance, he was deeply impressed by an extraordinary emerald which the Arab ruler Harun-ar-Rashid (d. 809) had sent as a gift to Charlemagne, who had then deposited it in this monastery. In this context we are told that the Frankish king had brought Christianity to the Saxons and that his nephew was called Roland (60). At a later moment, reflecting on the special relics and holy sites which a pilgrim can find in the city of Zürich in Switzerland, Waltheym repeats the same comments about Charlemagne, but adds a legendary account about a deer that escaped from 52 Hartlieb, Das Buch aller verbotenen Künste; Fürbeth, Johannes Hartlieb; Grubmüller, ‘Ein Arzt als Literat’; Schnell, ‘Neues zur Biographie Johannes Hartliebs’. For an English translation see now Hazards of the Dark Arts, trans. Kieckhefer, pp. 21–92. 53 Ich, Hans von Waltheym, ed. Krüger and Krüger.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nhunters and found refuge at a special spot. Once the emperor had prayed to God, it was revealed to him that this was the location where the martyrs St Exuperantius, St Felix and his sister St Regula, all members of the Theban legion under St Maurice, were buried. Charlemagne immediately ordered his people to exhume their bones, and once this was all confirmed, he had a cathedral built, the Grossmünster.54 Paying particular respect to the emperor, Waltheym underscores: Es ist zu mergkin, das keyser Karl alzo vile thüme gestifft hat alzo vile buchstabin yn deme alphabet sint. Und her hüp an dem A an unde stiffte zcum ersten Ache. Und alzo noch allen buchstaben noch eynander, alzo das noch deme Z Zcurch der leczste thüm was’ (216; Note that Emperor Charles founded as many cathedrals as there are letters in the alphabet. He began with the first letter, A, and founded the cathedral of Aachen. Then he followed through with all other letters until the letter Z, so the cathedral in Zürich was the last one).55 Moreover, a local legend about Charlemagne is also mentioned here. Waltheym noted a sculpture showing the sitting emperor, holding a sword on his lap half pulled out of the scabbard. One of the cathedral canons, Dithelm Sturm, informed the traveller/pilgrim that the reason for this curious arrangement was that Charlemagne once had an evil opponent whom he had expelled from the country. After the emperor’s death, the latter returned and stood in front of a wooden sculpture showing the ruler sitting on a chair, holding a sword in each hand. The rogue then said to the figure that he would have to tolerate his presence now after his death. At that moment the sculpture moved and pulled out a sword, which caused the miscreant to flee immediately (216–18). Waltheym thus reflects the great popularity which the emperor continued to enjoy, even at the end of the Middle Ages, since he was regarded as the protector of justice and of the Church. We will discover the very same accounts included in the Zürcher Buch vom Heiligen Karl (before 1471); they must have circulated widely in oral and written form before they entered this lengthy treatment of the Frankish emperor.56\n\nCharlemagne in German and Dutch Medieval Literature Considering the continuous reception and reinvention of Charlemagne as a mythical figure throughout the many centuries after his death, it comes as little surprise that he was also immortalized in countless literary texts, which thus blurred the separation between historical and literary narratives.57 Henceforth our focus will rest on 54 Keller, Reclams Lexikon der Heiligen und der biblischen Gestalten, p. 225; Waltheym confuses the relationship, assuming that Exuperantius and Felix were brothers, when the former was only a servant. 55 Classen, ‘A Slow Paradigm Shift’. 56 Zürcher Buch vom Heiligen Karl, ed. Bachmann and Singer. 57 Grieb, Schlachtenschilderungen, pp. 31–7. This was actually a rather common phenomenon in the Middle Ages, since chroniclers often included fictional elements and poets regularly included historical references, creating a kind of\n\n16\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nthe German- and Dutch-language narratives involving or dealing with this famous Frankish ruler, who, soon after his death, became an iconic figure of universal status, variously deeply admired and feared, ridiculed and satirized, hated and loved. His charisma, however, transcended all attempts throughout time to undermine his status.58 Irrespective of how we might view his actual political, economic, military, religious or artistic–literary accomplishments, Charlemagne continues to deserve our greatest attention because he has filled people’s minds throughout time and has thus triggered a flood of works reflecting upon him in both positive and negative terms. Because his life was translated into a myth, there is no doubt that it has exerted a deep influence on our imagination right up to today. Studying the literary manifestations of that myth during the European Middle Ages thus constitutes a significant task that takes us deep into the medieval history of ideology, mentality, religion and literary history, and also sheds light on the profound legacy of the Charlemagne myth in our present time. All those aspects impact us profoundly and alert us to the continuous need to turn to the pre-modern age for a more thorough analysis of modern conditions, concepts, ideals and value systems, as they are grounded in the medieval past. This book will take us from the early twelfth century to the late fifteenth century and will highlight a number of critical manifestations of Charlemagne as a literary and mythical figure. Of course, there is also the historical figure to be studied from a biographical perspective, especially as we can discover, hidden behind the various chronicle accounts, a complex, fascinating, religiously devout, powerful, but then also brutal, deceptive, hypocritical and highly ambitious personality who never hesitated to repress his opponents, even to the point of executing them or waging genocidal war (against the Saxons, for instance) when the opportunity arose or an emergency occurred.59 Our present purpose, however, is to focus on how posterity viewed Charlemagne and transformed the historical figure into an individual of literary myth in German and Dutch literature from the twelfth through the fifteenth century.60 bricolage; see also Classen, ‘Literarische Diskurs-Bricolage als literarische Strategie (Textallianz) in spätmittelalterlicher Chronistik’. 58 For this topic see, more globally, Jaeger, Enchantment; and the contributions to Magnificence and the Sublime in Medieval Aesthetics, ed. Jaeger. As to the global expectations that early medieval rulers would exert terror in order to keep their people under control and thus to maintain peace see now Schmidt, ‘Schreckensherrschaft’, pp. 119–20. 59 Fried, ‘Karl der Große als Mensch’. See also his excellent biography, Karl der Große: Gewalt und Glaube. Cf. further the contributions to Väter Europas: Augustus und Karl der Große, ed. Haag and Plattner. See also the concise and comprehensive contributions to Herrscher, Helden, Heilige, ed. Müller, Wunderlich and Gaebel. Other major figures of a similar calibre were Attila, Hārūn ar-Raschīd, Richard the Lionheart, Ivanhoe, Saladin, Genghis Khan, Frederick II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Cf. now also Classen, ‘The Ambiguity of Charlemagne in Late Medieval German Literature’. 60 Related scholarship includes Noble, ‘Greatness Contested and Confirmed’;\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nCharlemagne’s canonization in 1165 illustrates impressively how rapidly this process of mythologizing the Carolingian emperor was adopted for contemporary political purposes, which helps explain the continuing interest in this looming figure throughout medieval literature.61 Of course, in each poetic work we can recognize a different image of Charlemagne. In the later Middle Ages we even encounter rather negative presentations of a somewhat foolish and at times almost vicious and wrathful figure, all depending on the individual writer’s interest and perspective.62 While historians must grapple with the question of how we can achieve truly authentic insights into the world of the past, or into the life of a personality such as Charlemagne, who appears in the historical record always in some performative role,63 literary historians may simply and rightly assume that the data that have come down to us has gone through thick filters, such as poetic manipulation and transformation. How many of the historical annals and chronicles reported only what the emperor wanted posterity to know? As soon as we begin to analyse critically those documents, not much of the legendary figure of Charlemagne remains.64 The critical examination of medieval German and Dutch literature does not allow us to shed any more light on the actual biography of Charlemagne. We know that those poets projected an image of the emperor to please their audience and especially their own patrons, be that image positive or, as happened more often in the late Middle Ages, negative. But those fictional accounts, which often are clearly based on historical facts, inform us exceedingly well about ideological concepts, ideals, dreams and value systems, all somehow attached to the account of Charlemagne and Roland, among many others at his court. Priest Konrad’s Rolandslied (c. 1170), for instance, not only differs considerably from the historical account but Roland and Charlemagne in Europe, ed. Pratt; Gabriele, An Empire of Memory; Romig, ‘Charismatic Art and Biography in the Carolingian World’; and the works cited in note 3, above. The literature on this topic is, of course, legion, and here I have referred only to some of the most recent and most salient studies. 61 See, for instance, Folz, Le Souvenir et la légende; Koch, Auf dem Wege zum Sacrum Imperium; Engels, ‘“Des Reiches heiliger Gründer”’. 62 Karl der Große in den europäischen Literaturen des Mittelalters, ed. Bastert. For a rather negative view of this historical figure see Bergmeier, Karl der Große. However, there is the danger of an anachronistic reading when Bergmeier compares Charlemagne’s accomplishments (or lack thereof) with those of a twelfth-, fifteenth-, or nineteenth-century ruler. Certainly, Charlemagne waged war his entire life and, certainly, he did not promote urban and intellectual life as we might expect from such a ruler today. But he promoted the Church, education, the arts, medicine and many other aspects of human life as much as was possible. 63 Bredekamp, Der schwimmende Souverän. 64 Fried, ‘Karl der Große als Mensch’, pp. 369–71. He even uses such terms as ‘trügerisches Erinnerungskonstrukt’ and ‘Vergangenheitsmanipulation’ (370; deceptive construction of memory; manipulation of the past).\n\n18\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nalso sounds a different tune from the Old French Chanson de Roland, transposing the military–political, almost nationalist, theme into a spiritual–religious one (‘Vergeistlichung’) by having Roland fight against the Saracens in order to achieve martyrdom. This again served Konrad’s patron, Duke Henry the Lion, in his own political ambitions for the imperial throne.65 As important as the historical reports about Charlemagne might be, for the historians the literary works provide us with access to the concepts people had about that powerful ruler in the past, and how they wanted him to be presented within the fictional framework. This is, ultimately, the stuff of myth-making, and proves to be just as important as any projections of Charlemagne in historical accounts.\n\n65 Grieb, Schlachtenschilderungen, p. 38; cf. also Hennings, Französische Heldenepik im deutschen Sprachraum, pp. 105–10.\n\n1 The Kaiserchronik: The Emergence of Charlemagne in Chronicle Literature\n\nT\n\nhe topic of Charlemagne as seen through the lens of medieval German literature opens interesting interpretative perspectives, in that we are made very aware of how thin the wall between a literary and a historical approach to our subject matter can be. Both poets and chroniclers demonstrated an interest in this Carolingian ruler who has exerted such an influence long after his death, serving as a mythical figure and commonly representing the ideal royal character, a harbinger of justice and peace, the triumphant successor to the Roman world dating back at least to the time of Julius Caesar and Augustine. In fact, the difference between a chronicler and a poet in the Middle Ages was not as strict as we might imagine today, and by the same token the difference between the historical and fictional texts they produced is negligible.1 As is reflected in many works of art and poetry, Charlemagne has been a huge presence in people’s minds both during his lifetime and ever since. He was, almost from the beginning, something of a mythical figure. The question here is not whether he was known or not – we can safely assume that he was, at least by all those who enjoyed at least a modicum of education in the Middle Ages – but rather how Charlemagne was perceived, what expectations a reference to him might have provoked, and how individual writers modified the image of that emperor for their own purposes or for those of their audiences. The Kaiserchronik, a twelfth-century rhymed verse chronicle (possibly from as early as 1130) was composed by an anonymous Regensburg cleric (or possibly two clerics), and first attracted the attention of modern scholars and editors when the publication of one manuscript in the Scriptores rerum Boicarum was announced in 1765, which never happened, however. In 1783 a fragmentary manuscript appeared in print, followed by the publication of other fragments in 1803 and 1807. A first consolidated edition was printed by Joseph Diemer in 1849, and another by Hans 1\n\nSpiegel, Romancing the Past; Knapp, Historie und Fiktion in der mittelalterlichen Gattungspoetik; History as Literature, ed. Dunphy; Dunphy, ‘Chronicles’. See also Dire et penser le temps au Moyen Âge, ed.

Agapitos and Mortensen.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nFerdinand Maßmann in 1854, but continuous research over the following decades was necessary before the full text was finally prepared and presented in 1892 in a critical edition by Edward Schröder.2 Today we know of exactly fifty manuscripts containing this major text – a masterpiece of twelfth-century German literature – many, of course, only in fragmentary form. This huge number clearly underscores the monumental significance of this chronicle, which was obviously more popular than any other Middle High German text from the same period.3 As Alastair Matthews remarks: One reason for the work’s appeal may lie in its scope and the diversity of the material it contains. The historical span of the first redaction stretches from the founding of Rome to the reign of Conrad III, from Italy to the German lands, and from Iberia to the Holy Land and beyond.4\n\nIn the near future we can expect a fully critical edition of the twelfth-century Kaiserchronik, as announced by a team of researchers in England and Germany consisting of Mark Chinca and Christopher Young together with Jürgen Wolf and Jürg Fleischer. They intend to edit not only the original, twelfth-century version but also the two major reworkings of it that were made around 1200 and 1250, which reflect the long reception history of this major work that appealed to many generations of medieval readers. The three versions will be printed synoptically – that is, next to each other – and then be accompanied by an English translation, along with an introduction and commentary.5 Historians have tried hard to identify the author or authors, but it is not possible to say much more than that they hailed from a monastery in Regensburg, and not from Trier as some scholars once argued.6 As noted by previous scholars, we can be certain that the author and/or the patron of this work admired and glorified Charlemagne, a common and typical attitude in the twelfth century and well beyond. The Kaiserchronik was begun c. 1126 or sometime later, and might have been completed by 1147 or shortly after. Matthews assumes that the earliest date the work could have been started was around 1146 because the chronicle mentions Conrad III’s agreement to participate in the Second Crusade, but there is no reason to take this as the absolute starting point, since many of the sections in the\n\n2 Die Kaiserchronik, ed.

Schröder, pp. 49–50.\n\nThe Kaiserchronik\n\n21\n\nfirst parts could have been composed considerably earlier.7 Frank Shaw claims that the Kaiserchronik dates from after 1146, but he does not give any particular reasons for this.8 The patron of the work seems to have been one of the dukes of Bavaria, or Bishop Kuno of Regensburg (who died in 1132), which perhaps gives us a date before which the Kaiserchronik is likely to have been started. As is to be expected from a chronicle, the Kaiserchronik offers an extensive survey of world history, focusing on the Roman Empire beginning with Julius Caesar and concluding with the German King Conrad III. The account includes the history of thirty-six Roman and nineteen German emperors, and the author offers an exemplary episode for each one, thus mixing historiography with literature. In contrast to the more or less contemporary Annolied (late eleventh century), which was also composed in early Middle High German and represents a mixture of historiographical account and fictional narrative, ‘the accounts in the Kaiserchronik are full and vivid, with much use of dialogue and other techniques familiar from narrative fiction’.9 Scholars have identified a wide range of sources which the author drew from, underscoring the particular character of this and numerous other medieval chronicles in which factual material is closely intermingled with hagiographical, legendary and even literary sources. The frequent exempla do not serve for simple entertainment, but rather pursue religious and ethical goals, instructing the reader/listener to consider past events as models for contemporary conditions. The author explicitly rejects the lies contained in literary texts (v. 27–41) and highlights the didactic value of his own work. As Marta Maria Helff has noted, the Kaiserchronik contains numerous text passages that allow us today to gain an insight into a wide range of ethical and moral attitudes prevalent in the twelfth century, since the author extensively reflects on social and political structures, mirroring the standards of courtly life and indicating in myriad fashions how people interacted with each other in numerous everyday or unusual situations, including mourning, jousting, lecturing, preaching and ruling. Moreover, we can learn much about gender relationships and the interactions between rulers and their courtiers/knights.10 However, the Kaiserchronik does not pursue a strictly historical perspective, and changes many aspects of Greek and Roman history to emphasize the supreme role of the Christian Church in the foundation of the Roman Empire and, subsequently, of the German Empire. The German people matter centrally here, as Caesar is said to have achieved his position as sole ruler only with the help of German troops.11 Some of the main figures in world history are identified as German (or, rather, as 7 Matthews, The Kaiserchronik, p. 2. 8 Shaw, ‘Kaiserchronik’. 9 Dunphy, ‘Historical Writing in and after the Old High German Period’, p. 215. 10 Helff, Studien zur Kaiserchronik. See also Eilers, Untersuchungen zum frühmittelhochdeutschen Sprachstil am Beispiel der ‘Kaiserchronik’. 11 Rubel, ‘Caesar und Karl der Große in der Kaiserchronik’.\n\n22\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nGermanic), and even Emperor Constantine is said to have been of German origin (from Trier), which facilitated the translatio imperii ad Francos (the transfer of the empire to the Franks; see vv. 14282–95) without major difficulties.12 We would not be really wrong in characterizing the Kaiserchronik as a kind of mirror for princes, providing historical examples to teach the present generation politics, ethics and religion.13 Matthews takes a middle ground in his analysis of the narrative quality of this massive text: It should be clear, then, that the Kaiserchronik, both in terms of the statements in its prologue and the literary scene of which it was part, does not necessarily conform to the notion of a rigid distinction between fiction and history that has tended to shape much modern work on the analysis of narrative texts.14\n\nBut it is not enough to confirm or to reflect on this general observation; we also need to study carefully how this Frankish emperor is characterized and portrayed in this chronicle in specific terms, because he already represented a mythical character at that time and was deeply admired far and wide. I am not concerned here with historical veracity and will not try to compare this chronicle with others to observe differences, contradictions, errors and so on. Instead, this is an exploration of a major historical but at times also rather literary account by the narrator, clearly a Regensburg cleric, who describes how a Frankish nobleman was elected as emperor in Rome and how he performed in his public function. He is not only a mighty ruler but also God’s own fighter here on earth, and a role model for all future kings and emperors.15 The starting point, as the narrator emphasizes, is the decision by the people of Rome to select as their ruler a person from another country, so as to avoid internecine strife and other conflicts (14282ff.). At the same time, young princes from many different courts were invited to Rome to receive a proper education before assuming their thrones back home, which thus established an effective political system connecting the different nations to Rome. The author begins with the history of Charlemagne by referring first to his brother Leo, who was appointed pope (14314). Charlemagne stayed at home until a divine voice in his dream ordered him also to travel to Rome. Charlemagne consistently followed God’s wishes, while not necessarily having his brother in mind: ‘er minnete got stille’ (14338; he quietly loved God). Charlemagne is portrayed as a 12 Goez, Translatio imperii; Krämer, Translatio imperii et studii; Wetzstein, ‘La Doctrine de la “translatio imperii” et l’enseignement des canonistes médiévaux’. 13 Nellmann, ‘Kaiserchronik’, cols 949–64. 14 Matthews, The Kaiserchronik, p. 16. For similar issues in another historicizing genre, the heroic epic focused on Dietrich, see Kropik, Reflexionen des Geschichtlichen. 15 Pézsa, Studien zu Erzähltechnik und Figurenzeichnung in der deutschen ‘Kaiserchronik’, pp. 117–21, esp. p. 121; Stock, Kombinationssinn.\n\nThe Kaiserchronik\n\n23\n\ndeeply religious person: he prayed tearfully to God on many occasions, and he deliberately ignored the people’s wish that he serve as their next ruler (14360), since he had travelled to Rome only to attend church and to pray. But, on Pope Leo’s ardent request, Charlemagne finally accepted the crown. He immediately faced a further request to restore many of the lands that had been stolen by neighbouring princes. However, he refused to get involved, postponing all decisions until St Peter himself in a vision instructed him to do so, as the emperor reports (14407). He returned to his home country, soon followed by Leo, who had in the interim been caught by his enemies and had his eyes gouged out. When the two brothers met again Leo bitterly complained about his suffering as a consequence of the hatred that Charlemagne’s enemies had demonstrated. Even though he appealed to his brother to maintain peace, Charlemagne decided that the time had come to defend the Christian Church: ‘mit dem swerte sol ich di christenhait bescirmen’ (14537; with the sword I am required to protect Christianity). A huge army was quickly assembled and moved towards Rome, but Charlemagne delayed the attack for three days, although his generals voiced strong objections, because he was waiting for God’s specific command, which did then come through early one morning (14589–96). After a week’s siege Rome was conquered, and Charlemagne assembled a court to judge those who had attacked his brother. Even though the perpetrators tried to hide and swore false oaths, with the help of young St Pancratius the truth ultimately came out. But first Charlemagne prayed to God and to St Peter, indirectly forcing them to intervene and to restore Leo’s eyesight, as otherwise Charlemagne would return home; Leo’s sight was indeed restored (14725–6), a fact underscoring Charlemagne’s quasi-divine character as a worldly saviour. Leo publicly acknowledged this phenomenon, saying that a miracle had happened that now justified him in crowning Charlemagne as emperor (14751). The narrator emphasizes that everyone present fully approved of this decision, as they all followed Charlemagne’s ceremonial act of lying down on the floor in the shape of a cross and praying. Both clerics and lay people expressed great joy at this development (14755), underscoring, as the narrator explicitly indicates, that Charlemagne was truly a sanctified ruler and deserving of the imperial crown: ‘want er diu rîche habete / mit michelen êren’ (14766–7; since he ruled over all the kingdoms in great honour). He was, as Ernst Friedrich Ohly noted, graced with a vision from God in which he was instructed about his own future steps, which was considerably more authoritative and hence divine than just a dream (such as was received by the Roman emperor Constantine).16 Charlemagne first of all re-established law and order, stipulating in great detail the power of the princes and of the Church, and then he also determined basic details concerning the ordinary people’s dress code (sumptuary laws for peasants), forbade them to carry swords (forks would be acceptable) and regulated their work schedule throughout the week, after which the narrator feels justified in identifying 16 Ohly, Sage und Legende in der Kaiserchronik, pp. 230–3.\n\n24\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nhim as a proper emperor: ‘der gwan den namen scône / daz er der êrste kaiser wart ze Rôme / von Diutisken landen’ (14817–19; he correctly carried the title of being the first emperor in Rome who had originated from the German lands).17 As Christian Gellinek has correctly observed, the author/poet brings to life the past history of Charlemagne and the re-establishment of the empire under the umbrella of the Church not by just recording events but by bringing everything to the narrative stage and himself serving almost as a propagandist for the emperor.18 Charlemagne accomplished the conversion of the Romans to Christianity and thus demonstrated, above all, his leadership role within the Church. At the same time, as the narrator emphasizes, Charlemagne re-established law and order and fought energetically against evil lords in Italy. Nevertheless, his political and military focus lay in the lands north of the Alps, where he subjugated the rebellious Saxons and Frisians, among others (14853ff.). Using missionaries, he also extended his influence to Denmark (14874–5). As was expected and commonly undertaken by medieval rulers, Charlemagne also founded churches, established parishes and created dioceses, such as in Bremen (1483–75). We also hear of Charlemagne’s military triumphs in northern Spain (14877ff.) and of a major siege in southern France (14885ff.), all in the name of God; he is, after all, identified as ‘gotes dienestman’ (14909; God’s servant). As previous scholars have already noted, the poet presents the emperor as the long-awaited and divinely installed new ruler who accomplishes the goal of bringing God’s kingdom here on earth back into order: ‘the prophecy finds its inevitable fulfilment in the God-given structure of the Charlemagne story’.19 Charlemagne serves as God’s representative here on earth and re-establishes a divinely desired order so that peace and harmony can return to the empire, though he has to struggle long and hard to overcome his enemies, who are at the same time God’s enemies – for example, in the war against the Muslims in northern Spain.20 However, the emperor cannot influence specific events as they unfold before his eyes, though he reflects deeply upon them, as shown by his significant dreams about his nephew Roland’s mortal battle in Roncesvalles, which provide a close parallel to the Chanson de Roland.21 In Matthews’s words: ‘His view of events is shaped by the interplay between divine causality (his appeal to God to protect Roland), causal motivation (his supposition about Genelun’s behaviour), and, arguably, final motivation (his dreams).’22 17 Gellinek, Die deutsche Kaiserchronik. 18 Ibid., p. 182. 19 Matthews, The Kaiserchronik, p. 73; see also Neudeck, ‘Karl der Große – der beste aller werltkunige’. 20 The enemy are often qualified as either Saracen or Muslim, but, like other medieval poets, our authors depict a construct of Islam which does not always reflect actual Islamic practice. 21 La Chanson de Roland – The Song of Roland, ed. Duggan. 22 Matthews, The Kaiserchronik, p. 89.\n\nThe Kaiserchronik\n\n25\n\nVirtually every step in Charlemagne’s actions is directed by God via a messenger angel. After most of his troops have been slain the angel orders Charlemagne to collect a vast army of virgins from his empire, who don men’s armour and terrify the Muslims in Spain so profoundly that they surrender, hand over hostages and convert to Christianity (14980–4). In other words, with God’s help Charlemagne does not even have to fight physically, since his enemies are helpless and so daunted by the sudden appearance of a new army that they do not dare to fight any longer – all material directly drawn from the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle. And God then works a miracle when all the spears that the young female warriors have placed in the ground while resting on their way home suddenly turn into living trees (15000–4). But the narrator also emphasizes that Charlemagne was not simply a quasi-divine person here on earth. Instead, he also includes an account of his sinfulness, which makes him very human again. The emperor, he says, committed one sin that he could not confess to anyone because of its gravity. Finally, learning of St Aegidius’s (c. 650–710) (or St Giles’s) saintliness, Charlemagne summoned up the courage to turn to him for help.23 However, even here Charlemagne did not reveal the details, but merely submitted piously and devotedly to God’s will. On Aegidius’s prayer and reading of mass, a mysterious letter, sent directly from God, appeared on the altar. Charlemagne read it, but we are not told any details other than that God had granted him forgiveness because he had demonstrated his complete trust in God’s grace and had completely repented his sinfulness, ‘di gevordert im got niemer mêre’ (15067; then God no longer demands anything else from him).24 Subsequently the narrator cuts short his account, because Charlemagne had achieved too many glorious deeds to relate them all: ‘des zîtes ist nû niet’ (15071; there is no time for that now). But he summarizes all the characteristics that made him such a famous person, creating a list of features that became the building blocks for the Charlemagne myth as it evolved throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. He identifies him as a ‘wârer gotes wîgant’ (15074; a true warrior of God) and praises him for his courage, nobility and mercifulness, for being graced by God, for his honour, loyalty, steadfastness, glory, fear-inspiring power and 23 For the history of this saint and his anecdotal relationship with Charlemagne, see Meier, Handbuch der Heiligen, pp. 136–7; cf. also the excellent survey article online at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Giles (accessed 16 February 2017). 24 A very similar account of this event in Charlemagne’s life can be found in Jacobus de Voragine’s Legenda aurea: ‘The following Sunday, while Giles was celebrating mass and praying for the king, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and deposited on the altar a scroll on which it was written that the king’s sin was forgiven due to Giles’s prayer, provided that the king was truly repentant, confessed his sin, and abstained from committing it thereafter.’ Jacobus de Voragine, The Golden Legend, trans. Ryan, p. 148.\n\n26\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nhis universal fame: ‘Karl lobete man pillîche / in Rômischen rîchen / vor allen werltkunigen’ (15084–6; Charlemagne was rightfully praised in the entire Roman Empire, above all other secular kings). The account of Charlemagne in the Kaiserchronik then comes to an end, with the final remarks that he ruled for forty-six years and nine months and was buried in Aachen. As brief as the section dealing with this emperor might be, it proves to be the central juncture of the entire chronicle because it clearly separates the historical account about biblical times and Roman antiquity on the one hand from the Middle Ages on the other. The following sections treat the history of Charlemagne’s sons and do not return to the founder of the Carolingian dynasty, but the reader/listener would have been fully trained to refer all future events to those that had taken place during the time of Charlemagne. The glory of and admiration for this emperor is fully cemented in the Kaiserchronik, which subsequently served as the source for countless other vernacular treatments of Charlemagne both in verse and prose. For the myth that emerged around this personality it mattered only that God Himself turned to the young man and declared him to be the natural successor to the Frankish throne (14316–20). After that, as the anonymous chronicler emphasizes, Charlemagne conquered the various countries through his own strength and thus established a veritable empire. The Kaiserkronik clearly operates as any other medieval chronicle, laying out the historical events, discussing the ruler’s major achievements and offering a personal portrait, but then it also projects an ideal image of how a king should operate and what values he should hold. There is no doubt that the origin of the subsequent myth of the German (and Dutch) Charlemagne can be traced to this chronicle, as well as to a variety of other similar sources. In a way, we could rightfully conclude that this account of Charlemagne laid the foundations for a great flood of literary reflections about this mighty Frankish ruler who had not only created his own empire but had also laid the foundation for two kingdoms – France and Germany – that were to form central political entities on the European continent.25\n\n25 Bastert, ‘“der Cristenheyt als nücz kein czelffbott”’, pp. 129–31.\n\n2 Priest Konrad’s Rolandslied and the Glorification of Charlemagne\n\nP\n\nilgrims have always needed housing and food, protection and spiritual uplifting, a fact as true in the medieval period as it is today. For the endless stream of pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela in north-western Spain, the third-holiest Christian pilgrimage site in the world, the Church in the Middle Ages made much effort to provide material and spiritual support as well as also to gain from them financially.1 Thriving businesses arose on the long pilgrimage routes traversing France towards the Iberian Peninsula, and the cults of the various saints along the way were of supreme importance for local monasteries and churches, with the abbey of Cluny appearing to have dominated the entire southern French and northern Iberian region in this practice.2 Numerous narratives were created that aimed at both religious instruction and entertainment, with perhaps the most impressive example being the Old French Chanson de Roland, the best-known version of which is that of Oxford, Bodleian Library, Ms. Digby 23, associated with a clerk named Turoldus and probably composed c. 1100. This epic describes the battle between the rearguard of Charlemagne’s army, led by Roland, and their pagan (Saracen) attackers. Charlemagne (Charles) had been fighting in Spain and consolidating his control there when urgent matters called him back north, at which point, according to this literary account, the pagans under the rule of Marsilie used this convenient opportunity to avenge their previous defeat at the hand of the Christians by trying to eliminate the rearguard in an ambush. Furthermore, they prepared to kill Roland and his men to liberate 1 Cohen, ‘In the Name of God and of Profit’; Herbers, Der Jakobuskult des 12. Jahrhunderts und der ‘Liber Sancti Jacobi’; Davidson, Pilgrimage in the Middle Ages; see also the contributions to Pilger und Wallfahrtstätten in Mittelalter und Neuzeit, ed. Matheus.

Achnitz; unfortunately, there is no table of contents; individual entries are arranged chronologically, while pilgrimage accounts are not grouped together. 2 Sumption, Pilgrimage, pp. 119–21; surprisingly, there is no mention here of the Chanson de Roland or other secular texts indirectly associated with these pilgrimage routes.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nCharlemagne in Medieval German and Dutch Literature\n\nthemselves from Frankish rule, as the emperor has already left their country and had appointed Roland as governor. In essence, the poet reflects on the universal conflict between the two world religions while illustrating, of course, the ultimate victory of Christianity as the only true religion.3 Marsilie had offered a deal to his opponent, promising to convert to Christianity and to pay a huge ransom in return for the end of the war and the Franks’ return home. The Saracens were, of course, not at all honest in their promise to accept baptism and to enter a vassalic relationship with Charlemagne, so the proposal underscores the Saracens’ military weakness, lack of prowess, untrustworthiness and evil character, in line with the author’s religious intentions. In short, ‘[t]he prevailing interpretation of Turoldus’s poem is that it glorifies the crusading spirit – Christian militancy wedded to feudal imperatives – and that it centres on the debate between Roland and Olivier’.4 From a modern, but perhaps also anachronistic, perspective we could identify this epic poem as a literary expression of Frankish–Christian imperialism and colonialism, because the emperor triumphs after all despite the fact that his rearguard is completely destroyed. Following Roland’s defeat and death, the emperor is forced to return and to take terrible revenge, now utterly defeating the enemy and taking complete control of the land. In the end, God directly intervenes in the battle and even provides Charlemagne with succour when he is wounded and becoming exhausted in fighting against the heathen King Paligân (ll. 8555–6).5 A Middle High German version of the Chanson de Roland, the Rolandslied, was composed c. 1170–72 by Konrad, a Regensburg cleric, probably on behalf of Duke Henry the Lion, the ruler of Saxony and Bavaria. It consists of 9094 verses in rhymed couplets, very similar to contemporary courtly romances. Although neither the Chanson de Roland nor the Rolandslied can be counted as a crusading epic, both conform closely to the ideals conveyed in that genre: either the Christian knights triumph over their Muslim opponents or their souls are allowed immediate access to heaven if they are killed in battle. This and many other similar epics consistently portray Charlemagne as a new imperator following, after a hiatus of several hundred years, the glorious Roman emperors, though now succeeding as a Germanic ruler controlling vast areas of land north of the Alps, in the northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula and in northern Italy. The poet portrays a truly charismatic figure who triumphs not only because of his superior military and logistical skills but also, in what might well be the most important aspect, because he is God’s direct representative here on earth. 3 Ailes, The Song of Roland, especially pp. 74–5.

Kartschoke.\n\nPriest Konrad’s Rolandslied\n\n29\n\nRoland is Charlemagne’s nephew and one of Charlemagne’s paladins at court. The attack against him is made possible because Roland’s stepfather Genelun betrays him and his small army to the pagans, and when the fighting breaks out at Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees – today a pilgrimage site on the route to Santiago de Compostela – a massive slaughter follows. The Christians finally succumb to their opponents simply because of their small number, but not before killing scores of their enemies. When Charlemagne finally learns about the catastrophe, he immediately returns and takes his bloody revenge. One of the critical issues raised in the text is Roland’s prolonged refusal to call Charlemagne back to help by blowing his horn. When he finally does do so, after the repeated urging of his companion Olivier and Archbishop Turpin, it is too late, and all the Christian warriors die a heroic death, although the emperor arrives to wrest victory from the Saracens and deal them a devastating blow. Both the Old French Chanson de Roland (Oxford version) and the Middle High German Rolandslied specifically served political purposes.6 As Karl Bertau puts it, the Old French author underscores a number of points as highlights of his literary enterprise and as key components of his ideological strategy: ‘Vasallentreue, Christentum, Francia und das hyperbolische Bewußtsein von der Heiligkeit des Christenritters’ (Vassalic loyalty, Christianity, Francia [France], and hyperbolic awareness of the saintly character of the Christian knight).7 It is useful to consider briefly what the chronicles have to tell us about the actual events, as far as we can trace them today. In the spring of 778 Charlemagne organized a military campaign ‘at the request of the Muslim ruler of Barcelona, Emir Suleiman ibn-al-Arabi, who was attempting to rebel against the emir of Cordoba (Abd-ar Rahman I)’;8 Suleiman ibn-al-Arabi went so far as to seek out Charlemagne in Paderborn, in northern Germany, and promised to deliver the city of Saragossa to him. However, Saragossa, held by Al-Husayn, resisted and forced Charlemagne to lay a siege, which was unsuccessful. Two months later, Charlemagne was compelled to return to France to quell a new uprising by the Saxons and in the process his rearguard, led by Roland, was massacred in an ambush; three commanders were killed, including ‘Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus’ (Governor of the Breton Marches),9 who was later identified 6 For the text of the Old French poem, see The Oxford Version, ed. Short, in La Chanson de Roland – The Song of Roland, ed. Duggan, vol. I, part I. 7 Bertau, Deutsche Literatur im europäischen Mittelalter, p. 250; see also ‘Chanson de Roland’ und ‘Rolandslied’.

This ambush, which took place on 15 August 778, was, according to some sources, led by Ibn-al-Arabi’s two sons, who wanted to liberate their father, whom Charlemagne had taken as a hostage on the suspicion that he had secretly collaborated with Al-Husayn.10 The Latin annals do not mention the involvement of Arabs in the fighting, referring only to Christian Basques, or Gascons, but Arabic chronicles affirm that this was a battle fought by Arabs for their own goals.11 At any rate, it was a fiasco for Charlemagne, but he could not afford to return and then stay longer in Spain while the Saxons in the north of his kingdom were on the march and were even threatening the Frankish heartland. A poetic rendering of the events might have served as a cover-up for Charlemagne’s failure in this situation, at least in the eyes of posterity.12 According to other sources, the historical events that were later reflected in the Old French and Middle High German epics took place in a valley traversing the Pyrenees, though the attackers were not Muslims, but Gascons who aimed at looting the rearguard and profiting from their spoils, at least as Charlemagne’s biographer Einhard tells us in his Vita Karoli Magni.13 Duke Henry the Lion, the ruler of Saxony and Bavaria for whom the Rolandslied is believed to have been written, made a great effort to compete with the emperor, Frederick I Barbarossa, and apparently attempted to enhance his political status by connecting himself closely with the mythical aura surrounding Charlemagne. Duke Henry used the Rolandslied and a comprehensive building programme for his residence in Brunswick in northern Germany – a programme that included elements consciously focusing on the Romanesque style for the cathedral of St Blaise, among numerous other church buildings and art works – to display and demonstrate his ancient roots in dynastic terms, connecting him directly with Charlemagne, which granted him a stronger claim to the imperial throne than Frederick.14 Here we find a striking example of a ruler’s use of the combination of a literary text with an architectural and artistic concept to create representational works for political purposes. accessed 10 March 2017). 10 La Chanson de Roland, ed.

According to current consensus, Konrad could have been referring only to the last mentioned, for a number of good reasons that need to be reviewed only briefly in our context. Henry was married to Matilda (1156–89), the eldest daughter of the English king Henry II and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was one of the major patrons of twelfth-century literature and courtly culture. Through her parents, Matilda was most probably familiar with the Chanson de Roland and hence could have requested a German translation for the glorification of her husband’s political aspirations. In the epilogue, the narrator refers to the extraordinary rituals of repentance performed by Duke Henry (ll. 9066–7), who went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land before 1172; this adds further weight to the claim that Henry the Lion had commissioned this text.16 Moreover, the poet emphasizes that Henry’s wife, the daughter of a mighty king (Henry II of England), very much wanted the French text to be translated into German (ll. 9024–5). Henry’s political aspirations coupled with his literary and artistic strategies position him squarely on a European stage, making this Middle High German epic poem of major importance in European medieval literature as a whole, like its source, the Oxford version of the Chanson de Roland.17 It is also thought that Konrad was familiar with the Historia Karoli Magni et Rotholandi) and the Aachen Vita Karoli Magni (c. 1170).18 He was also very familiar with the Kaiserchronik, but he certainly did not contribute to its composition, as older research assumed. There is no doubt that Konrad drew most of his material from the Old French Chanson de Roland (in a version related to that of the Oxford manuscript), but the differences must not be overlooked. Konrad not only expanded the narrative 15 For an English translation, see Priest Konrad’s Song of Roland, ed. and trans. Thomas.
