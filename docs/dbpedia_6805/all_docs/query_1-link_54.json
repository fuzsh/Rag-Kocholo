        "text": "From the 1990s Telugu cinema witnessed a number of major changes in the way films are funded, made, distributed and shown. There is also an unprecedented degree of experimentation with form and genre while a new generation of film stars, both male and female have completed the picture in giving cinema a new look. Simultaneously, the more established stars, especially Chiranjeevi and Balakrishna, have repeatedly demonstrated an inability to move out of the shadow of the 1980s big-budget blockbuster locally known as the mass film. The mass film’s significance for the industry lies in the fact that it is not merely characterized by a limited set of formal features and thematic concerns but, more importantly, production, distribution and exhibition regimes. So what might be seen and even presented by the industry itself as a problem with individual stars, may in fact be a sign of the inability of the Telugu film industry, or at least a major part of it, to Bollywoodize itself.\n\nMost of the film historiography has originated from the cities like Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Lahore. The more recent scholarship has looked at cities like Pune and Kolhapur. In all these histories details of film production happening in cities like Hyderabad is a curious absence. This absence could be attributed to a multiplicity of reasons like the prominence of film production in these cities and the availability of archival evidence. Focusing on the film practises in cities like Hyderabad presents the possibility of bringing alternative histories to the fore which enhances the understanding of cinema as a complex network. The city of Hyderabad was distinct in being a princely city under the rule of the Nizam unlike Madras, Calcutta, Bombay and Lahore which were the colonial cities and also in being at the crucial intersection of the transport and communication networks from the north to the south. The city of Hyderabad under the Nizam rule has also been argued to be a modern city embedded in the international networks by scholars like Eric Beverley(2015). The study of early film history in Hyderabad becomes a way to understand the social history of the place itself. This paper attempts to trace the history of early film production in Hyderabad state by examining the case of Dhirendranath Ganguly. Dhiren Ganguly ran the Lotus Film Company in Hyderabad from 1922 to 1924. The case of Dhiren Ganguly and the Lotus Film Company becomes a site to investigate the patronage networks of princely city of Hyderabad, the industrial networks within which cinema operated and also the politics of film historiography post the linguistic reorganization of states. It is also an avenue to examine Ganguly as an early film artist, his influences and his mobilization of various networks to make cinema. Through the examination of fragmented evidence it tries to understand the different negotiations that were involved film production in the Nizam state in the 1920s and hence on the nature of society under the Nizam.\n\nTracing a fifty-year history of Telugu cinema, as a industry and cultural form, this book shows how film is directly implicated in the rise to prominence of an elite which continues to dominate parts of the country to this day; and, the emergence of a new idiom of mass politics. This book examines in detail the career of Andhra Pradesh’s best known film star, Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR) to show how Telugu cinema re-defined notions of linguistic identity and community for a non-literate public to create complex and multiple linkages between the consumption of cultural commodities and political mobilization. The in-depth analysis of NTR’s remarkable election campaign in the 1982-83 and revisits the “decline of Congress” thesis to draw attention to the larger transformation of electoral mobilisation with to the convergence of film, newspaper and the audio cassette on a performer who carried over his acting style from the screen to the election platform. The book concludes with a discussion of the lasting legacies of NTR in the present times when film has yielded its pride of place to television, the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh is imminent and institution of the star-politician itself appears to be on the wane.\n\nNowhere has the cinema made more foundational a public intervention than in India, and yet the Indian cinema is consistently presented as something of an exception to world film history. What if, this book asks, film history was instead written from the Indian experience? Indian Cinema in the Time of Celluloid reconstructs an era of film that saw an unprecedented public visibility attached to the moving image and to its social usage. The cinema was not invented by celluloid, nor will it die with celluloid's growing obsolescence. But 'celluloid' names a distinct era in cinema's career that coincides with a particular construct of the twentieth-century state. This is not merely a coincidence: the very raison d'etre of celluloid was derived from the use to which the modern state put it, as the authorized technology through which the state spoke and as narrative practices endorsing its authority as producer of the rational subject.\n\nThis dissertation tracks three decades of the relationship between the Bombay film industry and the Indian state as it relates to the question of infrastructural reform. This period is bracketed off by 1939, the year of the All India Motion Picture Congress, and 1969, the year the Indian New Wave burst onto the scene. Briefly, what I show in the dissertation is that the project of reform of the Bombay film industry was always already delayed, missing the mark or slipping by. While the factors responsible for such a state of affairs are too many to enlist, the two main ones can be, at the risk of simplification, be declared outright. One is the failure of the political class which made up the post-Independence state to understand the very nature of cinema: the range of affects it generates, its play with desire. Secondly, and tied to the first reason, is the failure of the Congress-led state to recognize or match up to the dynamics of indigenous capital, which was effectively the determinant economic force within the film industry. In short, what the Congress-coalition missed in its attempt to size up the film industry to the austere ideals of Nehruvian socialism was that this indigenous capital was itself shifting alliances, tapping into newer reserves of popular energy, desire and affect as the 60s were ending. The fast-eroding nationalist consensus between state and capital which, I hope to show, ultimately led to the paradigmatic shifts in the film industry could not in retrospect be contained either by rigorous policymaking, mere censoring of film content or relentless taxing, yet this is what the state unsuccessfully tried to do.\n\nTo what extent is cinema, or any technology, an aggrandizing, autonomous force that demands the reorganization of the environment around it according to its own technological needs? In the US, the railway system demanded the alienation of land and the coordination of time as a condition of its technical operation. Air travel commanded an instant redefinition of the concept of property—particularly air rights over individual plots—to facilitate flying from one part of a country to another without trespass. Technology, in this sense, is a standardizing, overcoding force that erodes local difference according to its own technological needs. The dispositif of cinema, in this light, can be seen as such an overcoding. The architectonics and screening practices of cinema are remarkably familiar, often instantly recognizable whether we are looking at 1920s Iowa City, Ibadan, Sunderland, Lucknow or Chiang Mai. Despite massive cultural, political, and religious differences, the cinematic apparatus takes on a familiar shape and any attempt to analyze the emergence and history of technological media has to take this capacity of overcoding into account. The turn toward materialism in the recent critical thought, represented in such diverse domains as the archaeology of media, new materialisms, and actor-network theory, asserts the agentive, deter-minative power of technologies and rejects the idea that technologies and objects \" are just there to be used as a white screen on to which society projects its cinema \" (Latour, 1993, p. 53). On the other hand, to what extent is this overcoding technology vulnerable and porous to the environments it finds itself growing within? The version of technology presented in the opening paragraph is based on an assumption that the ontology of a machine is formed at its moment of invention, and that once formed, it is simply transported from place to place. This is, particularly, the case with media archaeology whose critical effort is focused on revealing the conditions of possibility from which media emerge rather than the ways in which those media, once existing in the world, continue to mutate and grow. A more infrastructural view of media places emphasis on standardization and extension. The invention, in the work of someone like Gilbert Simondon (1992), is a single phase in an ongoing process of individuation that will have multiple phases. Cinema, in this sense, comes to be. It is a porous instrument whose internal structures are in constant mutual exchange with a host of external forces—other technologies, modes of economic organization, political formations, legal regimes, religious disciplines, and so on.\n\nThis article offers an overview of the exhibition and distribution sectors in Kerala between the late 1920s and the 1940s, and the economic and cultural considerations behind the initiatives to set up production centers within this region by the late 1940s. The incipient industry identified the \" family social \" as a convenient format to negotiate with the industrial and aesthetic terms set by South Indian cinema, mainly based in Madras, and the cultural demands placed on it by linguistic constituencies and elite patronage in the 1950s. The industrial constraints of small budgets and a narrow linguistic market necessitated an aesthetic that could cater to a socially and regionally mixed audience. Strategies of adapting existing popular genres like mythologicals, and subordinating these to the overarching narrative structure privileging an aesthetic of contemporaneity, enabled the early studio films to negotiate commercial and cultural pressures. Jeevithanouka (The Boat of Life; Vembu, 1951) is discussed as an instance where elements from popular mythologicals and stage performances were appropriated to privilege rationalist values. In the scholarship on histories of early cinema produced in regional industries in India there is often a direct relation made between \" what is shown in the film \" and \" what was happening in the region when the film was being made. \" While this dominant approach is limiting in several respects to studies of cinema in general, it is severely inadequate to understand the commercial filmmaking practices of the 1940s and the 1950s in regional industries. The dominant approach is not attentive to the creative engagements through which early commercial cinema in many regions devised signifying practices by borrowing generic elements from film cultures locally and across the world to conjure up new meanings, affects, and energies. One of the focuses of this article is to pay attention to the creative strategies adopted by the incipient commercial cinema in Malayalam to respond to the emerging cultural ethos and demands placed on it as a cultural institution. In the case of South India, linguistic markets were not consolidated until the early 1960s, and film entrepreneurs worked within the possibilities and constraints of often unpredictable markets. They were also engaged in the wider territorial networks of production and circulation stretching beyond the boundaries of specific linguistic regions. Hence, the recurring themes, the dominant aesthetic form and the Article BioScope 4(1) 31–49"
