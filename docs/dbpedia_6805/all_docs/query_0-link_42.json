        "text": "A case has been filed in Banjara Hills police station against D Ramanaidu's grandson Abhiram (Actor Rana's brother) for allegedly manhandling Krishnapatnam Port engineer Raviteja on Thursday night.\n\nA huge noise has been produced due to some renovation works in the Engineer's house since few days. Abhiram lost his cool due to disturbance it has been causing, went straight away to Raviteja's house and beat him up. It's been said that the star kid even argued with the cops who reached the spot.\n\nAbhiram is absconding to escape the arrest and the police were confident of taking him into custody as soon as possible. Cases were registered under sections 223, 342, 447, 506 of Indian Penal Code (IPC)."
