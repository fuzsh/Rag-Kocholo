Prasad, Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Electrical Engineering and Medicine, Institute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics, University at Buffalo and the State University of New York, Buffalo, USA gave two lectures titled Nanophotonics: Controlling the Excitation Dynamics at Nanoscale to Impact on World Energy and Healthcare and Metaphotonics: A new Multidisciplinary Frontier on 15th March 2012.\n\nThe first lecture was titled Nanophotonics: Controlling the Excitation Dynamics at Nanoscale to Impact on World Energy and Healthcare. Prof. Prasad said that Nanophotonics deals with the interaction between light and matter on a nanoscale. Its coverage includes size dependence of optical properties in quantum-confined structures, local field enhancement due to plasmonics that leads to enhanced linear and nonlinear optical responses, as well as nano control of excitation dynamics. The development of inorganic, organic and hybrid materials was discussed. In these systems photon-induced excitation dynamics, energy transfer and nonlinear optical interactions can be controlled and photon localization can be manifested. Several applications of these materials were discussed including solar energy conversion, efficient use of UV photons by carrier multiplication derived from multi-excitation generation as well as the harvest of IR photons efficiently by quantum dots and multipods of a narrow band-gap semiconductor. Application of Nanophotonics in biological systems including in nano medicine was discussed. Examples included photodynamic therapy and gene therapy and their impact on a broad range of healthcare challenges covering cancer, neurological diseases, infectious diseases, addictions, obesity and depression was discussed.\n\nHis second lecture was on Metaphotonics: A new Multidisciplinary Frontier. Prof. Prasad said that Metaphotonics is a rapidly emerging new direction that deals with the manipulation of electric and magnetic fields and their coupling in nanoengineered materials to control the field distribution and propagation of electromagnetic waves. The application of metaphotonics ranges from photonics communications, to solar energy harvesting, to sensor technology, to biophotonics. Metaphotonics covers a broad scope which includes: Chiro-Optics that describes the coupling of electric and magnetic dipoles in a chiral medium; Magneto-Optics that describes the magnetic control of optical fields and involves cross-coupling between electric and magnetic fields; Magneto-Plasmonics that describes hybrid materials and systems with synergistic magnetic and plasmonic functionality; Plexcitonics involves plasmon-exciton coupling in hybrid metal/organic/inorganic systems to manipulate absorption and emission of organic/inorganic counterpart as well as the plasmonic field distribution; Spin-Photonics describes optical control of magnetization; Switchable/Transformable Materials in which electric, optical, and magnetic fields can be used for the dynamic and reversible control of an optical field as well as for linear and nonlinear optical functions.

S. Pandey Distinguished lecture in the Department of Mechanical Engineering: Prof. Jyeshtharaj Bhalchandra Joshi, DAE-Homi Bhabha Chair Professor, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai gave a lecture titled Dynamics of turbulent flow structures and transport phenomena: implications to equipment design on 22 March, 2012. Most heat transfer equipment are operated in a turbulent regime. The flow patterns in these equipments are complex and are characterized by flow structures (“turbulent eddies”) of a wide range of length and time scales. The accurate quantification of these flow structures is very difficult and hence the present design practices are still empirical. Methods were discussed regarding the age, size, shape and energy content distribution of the flow structures. Consideration of these structure properties is important for the accurate estimation of design parameters such as heat transfer coefficient, mixing efficiency, drag coefficient etc. The flow structure information provides useful insights into the views of earlier established analytical and heuristic theories of heat and mass transfer. These studies have led to novel equipment designs, which have already been implemented in the industry.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Prof. J. B. Joshi is a Chair Professor of DAE-Homi Bhabha National institute Mumbai, India and is also the J. C. Bose Fellow in the Institute of Chemical Technology Mumbai, India. He did his BE and ME in Chemical Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 1971 and 1972 respectively, followed by a Ph.D. from the same university in 1977.

Rao Distinguished Lecture: Professor Sanjay Mittal, Department of Aerospace Engineering gave a lecture titled “Using High Performance Computing (HPC) for Understanding Fluid Flows” on 26th March 2012. Prof. Mittal began the lecture with a brief overview of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Then he gave a summary of his group's recent research efforts to understand fluid flows, by using computational tools. Prof. Mittal also discussed his group’s work towards understanding the mechanism of swing and reverse-swing of a cricket ball. Questions such as, 'can a new ball reverse-swing?' were also addressed. In general, Prof. Mittal and his group employ modern stabilized finite element methods for solving the governing equations for fluid flows. They are utilized to compute flows at various Reynolds and Mach numbers including those that involve moving boundaries. Some of the flow problems arise from practical applications while others add to the understanding of certain fundamental issues in fluid mechanics. Most of the applications require large scale computing. To that extent, whereever possible, in-house codes have been parallelized using MPI libraries. Scalability on parallel computers has also been demonstrated. Parallel implementations on the Linux cluster have resulted in super-linear speed-up. One of the several problems that the Mittal group studied is the flow in the air-intake of a high speed engine. A mixed compression intake for a Mach=3 flow is considered. Viscous effects as well as boundary layer bleed are modeled. The buzz instability is observed in certain cases. Both little and big buzz are found. Their frequency is related to the super-harmonics of the intake duct which acts as an open-closed organ pipe. The role of bleed in controlling the buzz oscillations is studied. A brief overview of their work on understanding wakes of bluff bodies was presented.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Prof. Sanjay Mittal did his B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 1988. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, USA in 1992. He joined IIT Kanpur as a faculty member in 1994. He has served as the Dean of Academic Affairs of the Institute. He received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in 2006. He is a Fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering and of the Indian Academy of Sciences. His research interests include unsteady aerodynamics, laminar separation bubbles on airfoils, aerodynamic shape optimization, fluidstructure interactions, bluff body flows, linear stability analysis, buzz instability in air intakes, aerodynamics of sports balls, train aerodynamics, traffic modeling and high performance computing.\n\nAbout the Donor: Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra Rao was born on June 30, 1934 in Bangalore.

Mittemeijer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Stuttgart, Germany gave a lecture titled Unusual Properties of Nanosized Materials on 26th March, 2012. Prof. Mittemeijer said that the term “nanosized materials” is usually meant to indicate polycrystalline material having grain/crystallite sizes (far) smaller than 100nm. Such materials can occur as powder materials, as thin films, as nanosized second-phase particles in a matrix, etc. A main characteristic of such materials is the very high grain-boundary/interface density. Properties of nanocrystalline materials therefore can be very different from the corresponding bulk materials. Prof. Mittermeijer discussed their recent work which revealed that in the case of Ni, crystallite-size reduction first leads to “normal” (in the above sense) lattice contraction, but upon reducing the crystallite size to about 45 nm or below, an abnormal increase of the lattice parameter occurs. A so-called Gibbs-Thomson effect is believed to be responsible for the stabilization of phases as nanocrystals which as bulk material would be unstable. This effect was demonstrated to occur for iron nitrides upon nitriding a nanocrystalline iron film. Prof. Mittermeijer also talked about the mechanism of unusual grain-growth behaviour of nanocrystalline material, as demonstrated by annealing ball-milled, nanocrystalline, elemental powders. He concluded his talk with a discussion of metal-induced crystallization involving amorphous silicon (a-Si) and nano crystalline aluminum (c-Al). This work is likely to lead to novel routes for the growth of nanostructures.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Professor Dr. Ir. Eric J. Mittemeijer is currently the Director of the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (formerly Max Planck Institute for Metals Research) Stuttgart, and is also a Professor (chair holder) at the Institute for Materials Science at the University of Stuttgart. His research is focussed on the relation between the properties and structure of new materials (e.g. nanomaterials) and, in particular, surface layers, and phase transformations of metastable materials. He has published more than 600 papers in international scientific journals.\n\nProfessor G.V. Samsonov (1918-1975): Prof. Grigorii Valentinovich Samsonov was born on 15th February 1918 in a town near Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). After earning his first degree at the Nonferrous Metals Institute in Moscow, he joined the Soviet Navy. At the end of the Second World War, he was stationed in the Soviet occupied zone of Austria. It was here he became interested in the extensive refractory metals and their compounds. After the cessation of the war, Prof. Samsonov returned to Moscow and resumed his higher studies and research under the guidance of Professor M. A. Merson (Institute of Steel and Alloys), a noted powder metallurgist of the then USSR. After completion of his PhD degree, Prof. Samsonov joined the Institute of Metalkeramika (powder metallurgy) in the Ukrainian Academy of Science at Kiev as a senior scientist. The Institute was later renamed “Institute of Materials Problem.” Within a few years, he was elevated to the post of Deputy Director. Simultaneously, he was invited to head the Powder Metallurgy Department of Kiev Institute of Technology. Prof. Samsonov made seminal contributions to the structure-properties-processing-performance relations of inorganic materials such as carbides, nitrides, borides, silicides, germanides, selenides, phosphides. Prof. Samsonov authored nearly 1500 papers. He also authored/edited 50 books and monographs including the seminal book “Configurational Model of Matter”. He has mentored several students who are now spread throughout the world.\n\nAbout the Donor: Prof. Gopal Shankar Upadhyaya joined the Department of Metallurgical Engineering (now Materials Science and Engineering) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur as a Professor in the year 1976.

Prof. Rao spoke of the cell as an organized collection of molecules that interact with each other: a chemical engine subject to physical laws. Essential to the physics of the living cell is that molecules that move around in the cellular environment are subject to forces that arise from energy-consuming active processes. He pointed out that the collective behavior, fluctuations and mechanical response of active matter are fundamentally different from ordinary matter. In addition, molecules in the living cell are carriers of information. The living cell manages the organization and flow of information by means of active mechanical stresses generated within it. Prof. Rao said that this has dramatic consequences for the spatiotemporal regulation of chemical reactions in the cell. He also discussed some recent ideas on how this allows the cell to solve an optimization problem in information processing. This thus brings together two apparently unconnected seminal papers of A. Turing.\n\nAbout the speaker: Prof. Madan Rao is a well-known name in the fields of theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, Non-equilibrium Statistical Physics and Biological Physics. He obtained his PhD from IISc, Bangalore. Prof. Rao joined RRI, Bangalore, in 1994 and he is currently a professor there. He is also an adjunct professor at NCBS (TIFR), Bangalore. Prof. Rao has published numerous research papers during his illustrious research career. In recognition of his pioneering contribution to the fields of theoretical condensed matter physics and biological physics, he was awarded the prestigious Swarnajayanti grant, the B. M. Birla science award in Physics and also the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award. He is an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore.\n\nAbout the Donor: Prof. Jagadishwar Mahanty Lecture Series in Physics has been instituted by Dr. Siddharth Mahanty in memory of his father, Prof. Jagdishwar Mahanty, who was a faculty member in the Physics Department at IIT Kanpur from 1961-1972.

In 1972, he joined the prestigious Australian National University and superannuated from there in July 1995 due to ill health.\n\nTOP\n\nInstitute Lectures\n\nProfessor Ian Angell, Professor Emeritus, London School of Economics gave a lecture titled “Science's First Mistake: Delusions in pursuit of Theory” on 4th January, 2012. In his talk, Prof. Angell pointed out the conceit of modernism and scientism that is grounded in the arrogance of scientific certainty. The message of his book 'Science's First Mistake' is that understanding through scientific theory, and application via its methods, can never expose the real nature of reality. Indeed there is no such thing as 'understanding', only mere description through observation. Science's First Mistake is to forget that its abstractions do not deal with reality. Rather, its models and theories are 'unnatural in nature' and artificial, and indeed quite absurd when viewed from outside of Science. As a controversial postscript, and although an agnostic himself, Angell argued that the arguments of atheists like Richard Dawkins are logically indefensible, and that religion is every bit as relevant as Science for day-to-day living, probably more so.\n\nAbout the speaker: Ian Angell was Professor of Information Systems at the London School of Economics for twenty-five years, where he taught courses on technological innovation and its implications. He is a forecaster of the socio-political and business consequences of Information and Communication Technologies, with over four decades of research experience into the impact of computerization on society. On his early retirement in September 2011, he was made Professor Emeritus at LSE. He now divides his time between research, consulting, lecturing worldwide, writing books and articles, and supporting the Alumnus Office at LSE.\n\nTOP\n\nProf. Jagadish Shukla, Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Earth Sciences (AOES), George Mason University, USA and President, Institute of Global Environment & Society (IGES) gave a lecture titled “Global Warming: Science, Politics, Ethics and Policy” on 14th February 2012. Prof. Shukla's lecture had three parts. The first part reviewed our current understanding of the mechanisms for weather and climate variations, and showed some evidence for predictability in the midst of chaos. The second part showed comprehensive evidence from observations and models presented by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change that global warming is real and caused by human activities. The third part examined the role of science and politics in ethical choices and policy options for adaptation to, and mitigation of, the impacts of climate change. Uncertainty in predicting changes in the Indian monsoon in a changing climate, and India's contributions to greenhouse gas emissions were also discussed.\n\nAbout the speaker: Prof. Jagadish Shukla was one of the lead authors of the 2007 report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Vice President Al Gore. He is a recipient of several other honours and awards including the Padmashree by the Government of India ,the International Meteorological Organization (IMO) Prize, the Rossby Medal and the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal of NASA. He is also an elected Fellow of the American Geophysical Union.
