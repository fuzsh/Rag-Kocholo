        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt is no secret that people in Andhra Pradesh treat film stars as demi-gods, so taking a plunge into politics is a cake walk for film stars.\n\nIt is no secret that people in Andhra Pradesh treat film stars as demi-gods, so taking a plunge into politics is a cake walk for film stars.\n\nTollywood���s date with politics began with late N T Rama Rao launching the Telugu Desam Party in the 1980s and today the mantle is slated to be taken up once again by the reigning star, Chiranjeevi, and a dozen other stars are expected to follow suit.\n\nThe 76-year-old Telugu film industry comes second only to Bollywood in number of movies produced annually. The industry, that shifted its base from Kolkata to Rajahmundry in 1936 and then to Chennai, established its presence in Hyderabad only in the 90s.\n\nOn an average, about 150 Telugu films are produced every year. Last year���s turnover is estimated to be around Rs 500 crore.\n\nWhen NTR took the plunge three decades ago, it was said to uphold Telugu pride in the backdrop of an over-submissive state Congress leadership towards the then Congress government at the Centre.\n\nNTR, who was a popular hero enacting the roles of Lord Krishna and Lord Rama and even Ravana, entered politics at the peak of his film career and could leverage his popularity to become the chief minister within six months of launching the political party.\n\nSince NTR, it has been a rosy picture for Tollywood stars in politics. Many like U V Krishnam Raju, P Jayaprada, Dasari Narayana Rao, M Mohan Babu, D Ramanaidu, G Krishna, K Jaggaiah, N Harikrishna, Vijayashanthi, Dharmavarapu Subrahmanyam, Kota Srinivasa Rao and Roja followed suit, all at the peak of their careers.\n\nAbout eight of them went onto become members of Parliament and two of them also became Union ministers. After a brief hiatus, there is a big movement among Tollywood stars towards the political arena.\n\nWith the general elections next year already gathering interest and battle lines being drawn, close to a dozen stars from Tollywood are chalking out their plan to contest, says political analysts in the state.\n\nThere has been an increasing demand from several quarters that Chiranjeevi, Tollywood���s most popular star and one of the highest paid actors in the country, should make a political entry. Chiranjeevi, who is regarded as Andhra���s Amitabh, has tremendous clout in the entertainment industry.\n\nHis Khaidi released in 1983, was the first major sensational hit directed by A. Kodandarami Reddy and collected a record-breaking Rs 34 lakhs in its opening week after which Chiru, as he is fondly called, has never looked back. It became a major blockbuster and a turning point in Chiranjeevi���s career winning him a huge fan following and catapulting him into the big league which at the time was occupied by Krishna Ghattamaneni.\n\nOver the next two-three years Chiranjeevi consolidated the top slot, a position he holds even 24 years after the release of Khaidi. His Stalin (2006) collected Rs 32 crore while Shankardada Zindabad (2007) collected Rs 20 crore, which speaks volumes about his popularity.\n\nAccording to industry estimates, Chiru commands Rs 30 to Rs 40 crore from celebrity endorsements annually. The actor was paid close to Rs 6 crore for endorsing Thums Up and Navratan Tel.\n\nHis remuneration for a movie is above Rs 10 crore. Whether he will launch his own party or tie up with a political party, is what his fans and politicos are keenly awaiting. Whether it is his own party or he joins an existing one, after NTR, Chiru scores over any other star in Tollywood in terms of popularity.\n\nFactoring all the possible support from Chiru���s Kapu community which constitutes 22% of the state population, several other backward classes and fans associations, believe that Chiru can repeat the NTR magic once again. This apart, several Tollywood stars backed Chiru when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati made a statement in AP that film stars are no good for politics. Mayawati���s statement was addressed to Chiru as he did not show any interest to join her party.\n\nHis younger brothers Nagababu and Pavan Kalyan may take a cue from him. Nagababu has started touring the state and is holding meetings with Chiru���s fans associations and with political parties. Indications are that Pavan Kalyan may contest in the parliamentary polls.\n\n���He will get a ticket when Chiru launches his party. Pavan has been interested in social work. He floated a non-government organization earlier to extend legal help to the helpless,��� said an analyst. Several other actors are also rallying behind Chiru, hoping that they would get a ticket to contest as well.\n\nThey At least five of them including comedian Brahmanandam have chances of securing a ticket. Noted Telugu hero D Venkatesh had also given his support to Chiru���s political entry. Venkatesh is the son of Tollywood director and former member of Parliament D Ramanaidu.\n\nThe other probable faces could be Nandamuri Balakrishna and Junior NT RamaRao. Balakrishna is the son of NTR. Balakrishna���s daughter recently tied the knot with TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu���s son Lokesh. Harikrishna, another son of NTR, is a member of Parliament, while Junior NTR is the son of TDP MP Harikrishna and grandson of NTR, who many say, resembles his grandfather.\n\nThe TDP may field Balakrishna and Junior NT Rama Rao in the polls if Chiru launches his own party. Both of them have been roped in to campaign for the by-elections scheduled on May 29. Two other actors Rajashekar and his wife Jeevita may also join politics. They have already met the state chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy.\n\nThe duo may try for seats in the coming general elections. They hogged the headlines recently after the car in which they were traveling was allegedly attacked by Chiru fans. Several Congress leaders raised a hue and cry. On his part, Chranjeevi had to apologise to the couple.\n\nPolitics worked well for stalwarts like NTR but it was not the case with the other lower rung actors. Actors like Roja or Kota Srinivasa Rao could only prove their existence in the political arena.\n\nRoja may be campaigning for the TDP, but has not made it big in politics. Actress Vijayshanti, popularly called lady Amitabh, has launched a new Talli Telangana Party. Analysts say she is someone to watch out for, though it may be a long way to go for her to become a big B in politics.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nNot TCS.
