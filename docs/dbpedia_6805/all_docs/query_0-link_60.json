He holds a Guinness Record, which he received in 1999, for producing films in maximum number of languages.The company is known for producing memorable Telugu films such as “Prem Nagar”, “Papa Kosam”, “Jeevana Tarangalu” and “Secretary”.\n\nAlso Read – Pic: Another Hero From Mahesh Babu‘s Family\n\nIn Hindi, they have produced films such as “Prem Nagar”, “Dildaar”, “Dilwala” and “Anari”.
