However, political winds were blowing in some other direction in Andhra Pradesh because her political party swept the 2014 Lok Sabha Election.\n\nBJP has no solid hold in the Andhra Pradesh. Andhra Pradesh is presently dominated by mainly two parties, namely the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and YSRCP. Indian National Congress had a solid presence in the Andhra Pradesh. But their grip from the Andhra Pradesh politics has declined after the bifurcation. So, the BJP hopes to make its inroads in the Andhra Pradesh political. BJP has made Daggubati Andhra Pradesh BJP State President. She has been mandated to make BJP a formidable political force in Andhra Pradesh who could take on the regional satraps."
