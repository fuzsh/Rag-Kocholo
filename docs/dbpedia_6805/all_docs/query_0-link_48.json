        "text": "Veteran Telugu film producer Daggubati Ramanaidu passed away in Hyderabad on Wednesday, leaving a movie business empire spanning a famous production house, film distribution and exhibition business, a film school and three studios.\n\nHe was 78. Death came after a battle with prostrate cancer.\n\nRamanaidu, a Guinness record holder for the most number of feature films produced by an individual, made films in 13 languages—Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Marathi, Odiya, Gujarati, Assamese, Punjabi and English—a rare feat in cinema.\n\nHis production house, Suresh Productions Pvt. Ltd, named after elder son, D. Suresh Babu, has 155 films to its credit, and is one of the most successful banners in the Telugu film industry. The production house exhibited over 1,500 films and runs 400 movie theatres across the country, according to its website.\n\nRamanaidu was conferred with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award, Indian cinema’s highest honour, in 2009. He was also honoured with the country’s third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan, in 2013.\n\n“People in film circles used to treat him as a Moghul because he produced so many films,” film critic and writer Gudipoodi Srihari said. “His focus was always on the story. He had a good nose to judge a film’s success… He established producer as the most important person in the movie business.”\n\nHailing from an agricultural family in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, Ramanaidu, a college dropout, dabbled in different businesses—transport, rice mill, tobacco production and brick making, before venturing into film production. His first film, Anuragam, which he co-produced with a relative under banner name, Anuroopa, failed at the box office.\n\nTo recoup losses, Ramanaidu started Suresh Productions in 1964 and produced the banner’s first film, Ramudu Bheemudu, starring legendary Telugu actor N.T. Rama Rao in a dual role. The film went on to become a hit, heralding Ramanaidu’s arrival in the film industry.\n\nOver the next 50 years, Ramanaidu was the name behind Telugu hits such as Prem Nagar, Soggadu, Prema Mandiram, Drohi, Bobbili Raja, Kaliyuga Pandavulu, Aha Na Pellanta, Indrudu Chandrudu, Papa Kosam, Preminchu and most recently Gopala Gopala, starring younger son D. Venkatesh and Pawan Kalyan.\n\nHis Hindi hits include Tohfa, Insaf ki Awaaz and Maqsad.\n\nRamanaidu played a major role in shifting the Telugu film industry’s base from Chennai to Hyderabad. While visiting Hyderabad during the filming of the 1976 movie Secretary, Ramanaidu saw potential in Hyderabad as a movie production base. Back then, the Telugu film industry operated almost entirely out of Chennai.\n\nHe shifted to Hyderabad in 1983 and launched Ramanaidu Studios in 1989 in Jubilee Hills, a rocky terrain back then, in contrast with the plush neighbourhood it is today. Like most film personalities in the South, Ramanaidu dabbled for a brief while in politics. He was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1999 from Bapatla constituency on a Telugu Desam Party (TDP) ticket.\n\n“He used to tell he was a socialist by action and a secularist by mind,” said Srihari."
