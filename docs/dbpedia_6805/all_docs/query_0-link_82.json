        "text": "The Telugu Film Industry is being exploited by noted film producer D.Ramanaidu’s son Mr D.Suresh Babu.\n\nFew Years back suresh entered into Film Theatres LEASE Business starting with few theatres, after seeing the huge profits in that he aggressively concentrated on that leaving film production business taking maximum number of theatres into lease by benami names of his staff and relatives, from then onwards the downfall of the small budget films started.\n\nMany film distributors closed their offices unable to bear the high rentals charged by sureshbabu and his associates, Many small budget film producers stopped making films and new producers are suffering huge losses as the little revenue that comes from theatres are eaten away by sureshbabu&co\n\nUsually he takes lease of the theatre for 80,000/- he charges 2,80,000/- and even more as the rent from buyer/ producer depending upon the situation at that time, so he is paying 10% to the theatre owners and collecting 25 to 30% from the producers or buyers.\n\nEven the theatre owners are unable to run the theatre as they have to run for films each Friday to these syndicate [BIG4] offices and they will trouble him like anything either ask for more advance or some way , he will be fed up within notime and agrees to give theatre to lease to these syndicate, fear of non supply of films also makes him shut his mouth and he says he voulanterily agreed to give the theatre with out any pressure from them.\n\nIn most of the towns of AndhraPradesh state they have 9 out 10 theatres under their lease so any producer/buyer has to come to their terms with out any way, as the big film producers can bear this rental system , most of the small budget film producers are remaining as sufferers.\n\nSuresh with his influence in the govt got the g.o to increase the movie ticket rates, to increase weekend numbers for big films sothat he can further increase rents, which effected small movies badly. Audiences are selective as they cant afford to see more movies.\n\nDue to these selfish methods of sureshbabu many talented technicians are with out job in the industry, unable to bear this a small agitation started by film directors against this theatre lease system which is getting full support from all corners and people realized how much hatred ppl has got on sureshbabu.\n\nNow for small film producers , technicians and buyers this is do or die situation as they are facing survival and existence problems. ANDALL ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST AND READY TO FACE ANYTHING .\n\nWhen questioned by media Sureshbabu says let them make better films, successful films and they make flops , y blame me? He asks, ok then y r u making flop movies and other high budget movies made with the budget of 20 to 25 crores r not able to run for few weeks y, success rate is lower throughout India not only in our state.\n\nHis dad Ramanaidu defends his son saying ‘ if my son stops the lease system then Reliance group will take over or these theatres will b converted into marriage halls, y do u all blame my son when he is making profits out of it, what is wrong in doing business.’ He argues..\n\nYes he is doing FILM BUSINESS but the business comes first for him not the film,\n\nIf what he is doing is legal, then y does he takes lease agreements on different BENAMI names, IS THIS NOT CHEATING.\n\nJust to escape from THE MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT from Registrar of companies.\n\nSuresh babu gives percentage to directors instead of high remunerations for his films 2 gain but he never gives theatres on percentage wow what a DOUBLE STANDARD thinking.\n\nIn any industry the product manufacturer gets more profit bt not here see this ex\n\n‘X ‘ film collected 3,50,000/- for 1 week, the lesse took 2,75,000/- as rent and paid 25,000/- after deducting taxes etc… so suresh babu pockets huge money which actually shd belong to the producers/buyer.\n\n· EASY MONEY EARNED WILL GO AWAY SO EASILY.\n\n· OVER GREEDY PPL NEVER HAD A PEACEFUL LIFE.\n\n· EXPLOITERS ENDING WILL BE VERY PATHETIC.\n\n· THE SUFFERED SOULS CURSES WILL HAUNT HIS FAMILY THROUGH OUT THEIR LIFE.\n\n· HE LOST CREATIVENESS ON SELFISH THINKING AND INSTEAD OF GETTING ACCOLADES AS GUD FILMMAKER HE REMAINED TO BECOME A RAAVAN AS HARDCORE BUSINESS MAN .\n\n· HE IS MONEY MAKING MACHINE WITH OUT HEART.\n\n· HE CANT COME TO ANY PUBLIC FUNCTION WITH OUT FEAR , AS HE IS GUILTY AND HV THE FEAR , ANY BODY CAN INSULT HIM ANY TIME.\n\n· SMALL PRODUCERS SHD FLOAT A NEW ASSOCIATION\n\n· ‘TELUGU FILM SMALL PRODUCERS COUNCIL’ [TFSPC] REGD ORGANISATION, Under the AP [Telangana Areas] Public societies Regd Act 1350 F)\n\nELECTING DASARI NARAYANARAO AS THE PRESIDENT\n\n· TELUGU FILM PRODUCERS COUNCIL [TFPC] HAS BECOME TELUGU FILM BIG PRODUCERS COUNCIL,AS ITS NEGLECTING SMALL PRODUCERS PROBLEMS.\n\nTHE MOMENT SURESH LEAVES THIS DIRTY LEASE BUSINESS AFTER EARNING SO MUCH OF UNHEALTHY MONEY , THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WILL CELEBRATE.\n\nHOPE THAT DAY IS NOT FAR OFF , IF THAT NEVER HAPPENS THEN THIS AGITATION WILL CONTINUE TILL THIS LOOTING STOPS PERMANENTLY.\n\n!q# !q# !q#"
