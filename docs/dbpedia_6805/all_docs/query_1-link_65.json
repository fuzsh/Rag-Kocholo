        "text": "Name: Akkineni Nagarjuna\n\nDate of Birth: 29 August 1959\n\nParents: Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Annapurna\n\nSpouse: Lakshmi Daggubati (married: 1984; divorced: 1990)\n\nAmala Akkineni (married: 1992)\n\nChildren: Naga Chaitanya & Akhil Akkineni\n\nSiblings: Venkat Akkineni & Naga Susheela Akkineni\n\nOccupation: Actor, Producer & Businessman\n\nAkkineni Nagarjuna Rao, also known simply as Nagarjuna, is an Indian actor, producer, TV host, and businessperson. He primarily works in Telugu cinema, but he has also appeared in some Hindi and Tamil films.\n\nHe has received recognition for his work, including two National Film Awards. One was for producing the film “Ninne Pelladata” in 1996, which won the Best Feature Film in Telugu. The other was for his performance in “Annamayya” in 1997, where he received a Special Mention. Additionally, Nagarjuna has been honored with nine state Nandi Awards and three Filmfare Awards South.\n\nEarly Life:\n\nAkkineni Nagarjuna was born on August 29, 1959, in Madras, now Chennai, into a Telugu family. His father, the renowned actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao, and mother, Annapurna, hail from Ramapuram in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna District. Nagarjuna’s father moved to Madras to pursue acting.\n\nThe family later moved to Hyderabad. Nagarjuna attended Hyderabad Public School for his schooling and Little Flower Junior College for his intermediate education, both situated in Hyderabad.\n\nHe began his Mechanical Engineering degree at the College of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University in Madras. While studying there, he was classmates with former Indian cricketer Krishnamachari Srikanth. However, he eventually completed his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan.\n\nIn February 1984, Nagarjuna married Lakshmi Daggubati. She is the daughter of D. Ramanaidu, a well-known filmmaker, and the sister of actor Venkatesh and producer Suresh Babu. They have a son named Naga Chaitanya, who was born on November 23, 1986. However, they got divorced in 1990.\n\nLater, Nagarjuna married actress Amala on June 11, 1992. They have a son named Akhil, who was born on April 8, 1994.\n\nCareer:\n\nNagarjuna started his acting journey as a child artist in the 1967 Telugu film “Sudigundalu,” directed by Adurthi Subba Rao. He also appeared as an infant in the movie “Velugu Needalu,” written by Sri Sri. Both films starred his father, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, in the lead role.\n\nYears later, Nagarjuna made his debut as a lead actor in the 1986 Telugu film “Vikram,” directed by V. Madhusudhana Rao, with Shobana as the female lead. It was a remake of the 1983 Hindi film “Hero” and was successful, giving Nagarjuna a strong start in his career.\n\nAfterward, he acted in movies like “Majnu,” directed by Dasari Narayana Rao, which was well-received. Nagarjuna received positive reviews for his portrayal of a heartbroken man in the film.\n\nHe then starred in “Sankeertana,” directed by debutant Geetha Krishna with music by Ilaiyaraaja. Although the film didn’t do well at the box office, it was praised for its storyline and music.\n\nIn 1988, Nagarjuna starred in the blockbuster “Aakhari Poratam,” written by Yandamuri Veerendranath and directed by K. Raghavendra Rao. He was paired opposite Sridevi and Suhasini in this film. Also in 1988, he appeared in “Janaki Ramudu” alongside Vijayashanti, directed by Raghavendra Rao, which was also a hit.\n\nIn 1989, Nagarjuna starred in the Mani Ratnam-directed romantic drama “Geetanjali,” which won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990. Following this success, he starred in “Siva,” directed by Ram Gopal Varma. This film is considered groundbreaking in Telugu cinema and made Nagarjuna a superstar.\n\nIn 1990, he made his Bollywood debut with the Hindi remake of “Siva,” titled “Shiva,” which also saw immense success at the box office. He then received critical acclaim for his role in “Jaitra Yatra” and appeared in films like “Prema Yuddham” and “Iddaru Iddare.”\n\nAlthough he had some ups and downs, “Nirnayam,” in which he acted alongside Amala again, was a hit.\n\nAfter his earlier successes, Nagarjuna continued to deliver hits like “Killer,” “Neti Siddhartha,” and “Nirnayam,” collaborating with renowned directors like Fazil and Priyadarshan. He earned the nickname “Celluloid Scientist” for his willingness to experiment with different scripts.\n\nSome of his notable hit films included “President Gari Pellam,” “Varasudu,” “Gharana Bullodu,” and “Allari Alludu.” In 1994, he starred in his first Hindi-Telugu bilingual film, “Criminal,” directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The same year, he ventured into comedy for the first time with “Hello Brother,” which became a huge success and was later remade into Hindi as “Judwaa.” Many of his films were also dubbed into Tamil.\n\nIn 1996, Nagarjuna starred in and produced “Ninne Pelladata,” directed by Krishna Vamsi. The movie won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu and the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Telugu.\n\nThe following year, Nagarjuna acted in “Annamayya,” portraying the role of Annamacharya, a 15th-century Telugu singer and poet. This performance earned him the Filmfare Best Actor Award and his first Nandi Award for Best Actor. He also received a National Award for this role.\n\nLater in the same year, he starred in the Tamil film “Ratchagan,” directed by Praveen Gandhi, which was successful at the Tamil Nadu box office. His subsequent releases included “Nuvvu Vastavani,” “Ninne Premistha,” and “Azad.”\n\nNagarjuna starred in romantic comedies like “Santosham,” “Manmadhudu,” and “Sivamani.” In 2003, he produced “Satyam,” which featured his nephew Sumanth.\n\nIn 2004, Nagarjuna had two releases: “Nenunnanu” and “Mass.” He produced “Mass” and it was directed by choreographer Lawrence Raghavendra.\n\nIn 2005, Nagarjuna acted in and produced “Super.”\n\nIn 2006, he starred in “Sri Ramadasu,” his second period film based on the 18th-century Telugu Saint/poet of the same name. For this film, Nagarjuna received the Nandi Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn December 2007, he appeared in “Don,” and a year later, he appeared in “King” alongside Trisha and Srihari.\n\nIn 2010, Nagarjuna appeared in the films “Kedi” and “Ragada.” “Gaganam” was released on February 11, 2011, and its Tamil version was titled “Payanam.”\n\nIn 2011, Nagarjuna signed three consecutive movies: “Rajanna,” “Damarukam,” and “Shirdi Sai.” However, his next film “Greeku Veerudu,” alongside Nayanthara, didn’t perform well. Similarly, “Bhai” turned out to be a disaster at the box office.\n\nIn 2014, Nagarjuna starred in the blockbuster family drama “Manam,” directed by Vikram Kumar. He played a dual role in “Soggade Chinni Nayana,” which became one of his biggest blockbusters. Later, he portrayed a character with a disability in Vamshi Paidipally’s bilingual film “Oopiri,” alongside Karthi. This movie was a hit, and Nagarjuna won the IFFA Utsavam Award for Best Supporting Actor for the Tamil version.\n\nIn 2017, he played a devotional role in the film “Om Namo Venkatesaya,” which received average reviews and was considered a disaster. He then starred in the horror film “Raju Gari Gadhi 2,” which had an average performance at the box office.\n\nIn 2018, Nagarjuna starred in the film “Officer,” directed and produced by Ram Gopal Varma. However, it received poor reviews from critics and became the biggest disaster in Nagarjuna’s career.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, “Devadas,” directed by Sriram Aditya, was released, featuring Nagarjuna alongside Nani. The film also starred Rashmika Mandanna and Aakanksha Singh and achieved moderate success.\n\nAwards & Nominations:\n\nNational Film Awards\n\n1998 Winner in National Film Awards\n\nSpecial Mention for Annamayya\n\n1997 Winner in National Film Awards\n\nBest Feature Film in Telugu for Ninne Pelladatha\n\nFilmfare Awards South\n\n2017 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for OOPIRI\n\n2015 Winner in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Film for Manam\n\n2015 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Manam\n\n2014 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Film for Uyyala Jampala\n\n2013 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugug Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Damarukam\n\n2012 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Film for Rajanna\n\n2012 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Rajanna\n\n2007 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Ramadasu\n\n2006 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Film for Super\n\n2006 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Super\n\n2005 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Mass\n\n2003 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Santosham\n\n2001 Nominee in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Azaad\n\n1998 Winner in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Actor for Annamayya\n\n1997 Winner in Filmfare Award – Telugu Film Industry\n\nBest Film for Ninne Pelladatha\n\nSouth India International Movie Awards\n\n2017 Nominee in SIIMA – Telugu\n\nBest Actor in Leading Role for Oopiri\n\n2015 Winner in SIIMA – Telugu\n\nBest Film for Manam\n\n2013 Nominee in SIIMA – Telugu\n\nBest Actor in Leading Role for Shridi Sai\n\n2012 Nominee in SIIMA – Telugu\n\nBest Actor in Leading Role\n\nTimes of India Film Awards\n\n2013 Nominee in Hyderabad Times Film Awards\n\nBest Actor for Shirdi Sai\n\nCineMAA Awards\n\n2015 Winner in CineMAA Award\n\nExceptional Performance for Manam\n\n2013 Winner in CineMAA Award\n\nBest Actor: Critics for Shirdi Sai\n\n2005 Winner in CineMAA Award\n\nBest Actor – Male for Mass\n\nNandi Awards\n\n2015 Winner in Nandi Award\n\n2nd Best Feature Film for Manam\n\n2012 Winner in Nandi Award\n\nSpecial Jury Award for Rajanna\n\n2007 Winner in Nandi Award\n\nBest Actor for Sri Ramadasu\n\n2003 Winner in Nandi Award\n\nBest Actor for Santosham\n\n2003 Winner in Nandi Award\n\n1st Beast Feature Film for Manmadhudu\n\n1998 Winner in Nandi Award\n\nBest Actor for Annamayya\n\nIIFA Utsavam\n\n2017 Winner in Tamil Cinema\n\nBest Actor in Supporting Role for Oopiri"
