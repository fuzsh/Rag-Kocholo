        "text": "31st March 2003\n\nHarivillu enters Cannes film festival\n\nD Rama Naidu's yet-to-be-released children film 'Harivillu' entered the prestigious Cannes film festival to be held at Paris from 14th May 2003 to 25th May 2003. B Narsing Rao directed this film that has only 5 characters. This film is about a cancer-stuck child who is in search of definition of the term death. This film would be releasing on 2nd of April 2003 as Ugaadi special. D Rama Naidu is going to take the best producer Nandi award for 'Preminchu' on 1st April from CM Chandra Babu Naidu. On 2nd April, another award-oriented film Harivillu is releasing. Two days of celebrations for the Telugu movie moghul D Rama Naidu!\n\nCM to grace the 100 days function of Okkadu\n\nPrince Mahesh Babu is going to give the most precious birthday gift to his father Superstar Krishna on his birthday (31st May) this year. He is going to have the 100 days function of the industry hit of the year 'Okkadu' held at Merchant Association Grounds in Gollapudi, Vijayawada (the same venue where Indra 175 days function was held). CM Chandra Babu Naidu has been invited as the chief guest. The function would start at 6 pm.\n\n30th March 2003\n\nNTR Malli Puttaadu details\n\nThere is lot of similarity in the looks of current hero NTR and the legend NTR. A movie is coming up with a title called 'NTR Malli Puttaadu' that is based on the similarity we are talking about. This film is going to be a full-fledged socio fantasy film with a good political touch. This film would feature both Legend NTR and current NTR. Sunil Narang - the man behind Asian Film Distributors of Nizam area - is going to produce this film. More details later!!\n\nNTR injured in Simhadri shooting\n\nNTR is injured while doing a stunt composed by fight master Vijayan for the film 'Simhadri' on 29th of March 2003. This injury caused 13 stitches to NTR. The doctors asked NTR to take rest till Tuesday. Incidentally, NTR had similar kind of injury while shooting for 'Aadi' and that film went on to become a blockbuster. This sentiment is like a blessing in disguise for NTR. So, sentimentally Simhadri should also become a big hit!\n\n28th March 2003\n\nChiru to clap on NTR\n\nChiranjeevi is going to clap the muhurat shot on NTR on 11th of April 2003. Akkineni Nagarjuna would start the camera for this occasion. Poori Jagannath - NTR combination film 'Andhrawala' is going to have its muhurat on that day. Rakshita is signed as heroine. Raju - Giri would produce this venture on Venkateswara Arts banner.\n\nJohnny music launch in UK\n\nUday Kiran is going to launch the audio CD of Pawan Kalyan's Johnny officially on the evening of 29th March 2003 at 'Pepper Pot Pub' in London.

Telugu cinema music is officially going places! Is it not?\n\nMusic magic on 11th April\n\nThe latest 3-D film 'Music Magic' is going to release on 11th April. This 3-D film is being simultaneously released in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam. Appachan, who produced Chinnari Chetana -the first 3-D film in Telugu -, is presenting this film. SP Balu is acting as magician in a vital role. Dancing star Prabhudeva is also doing an important role. Jose directs this 3-D film that is stuffed with lots of special effects.\n\n26th March 2003\n\nTelugu film celebs for Ugadi in UK\n\nA host of Telugu film celebrities are thronging to UK to celebrate Ugadi with the Telugu community out there. These celebrities include Uday Kiran, Teja, Murali Mohan, MM Keeravani, Chakri, Sirivennela Seetarama Sastry, RP Patnaik, Usha, Kausalya, Ghantasala Ratna Kumar, G Anand and Kavitha Krishna Murthy. These celebrations are going to be held on 30th of March at Stourbridge Town Hall in West Midlands, UK.

The selection of Nandi awards for the year 2002 is currently going on. The results would be announced soon and a function to give away those awards would be held in the month of October 2003.\n\nBhumika in Hindi films\n\nBhumika Chawla, in spite of being a girl from Mumbai, has to prove herself in Telugu before entering in to Bollywood. As per the confirmed reports, Bhumika Chawla is acting in a couple of remakes from south. She is acting in 'Tera Naam' (a remake of Tamil Sethu and Telugu Seshu) and she is paired up with Salman Khan in that film. She is also acting in Hindi remake of Tamil hit 'Run' opposite Abhishek Bachchan.\n\nTaarak calendar\n\nNT Rathnaa's 3rd film - Taarak - is going to release 11th of April 2003. On this eve, the producer has released free calendar that features Legend NTR in 'Maha Vishnu' getup. It also contains many more images of Taraka Rathnaa. The audio of Taarak that was released in the last week has got very good response.\n\n24th March 2003\n\nJohnny audio's break even in 1st batch\n\nLike movie openings, the audio openings also depend more on the star than the substance. When a big audio is coming up, the audio maker tries to cash in the opening craze by releasing maximum number of cassettes. This craze went to the peak when Aditya music has released the much-awaited 'Johnny' album on 24th of March 2003. The official figure of the 1st bunch is 6 lakhs of cassettes, which are priced at Rs. 40/- and Rs 42/- each for the buyers in AP and outside AP respectively. Another bunch of the audio CDs are expected to be dispatched in a couple of days. Now lets come to the statistics. The thumb rule in the music industry is that, the audio producer (who has recording unit and other accessories in his hand) makes a profit of Rs 20/- on each original audiocassette sold in the market. If 6 lakhs of the albums are released, the audio producer is stand to make 1.2 crores if all the cassettes are sold. As per the unconfirmed reports, the rights of Johnny audio are sold for a staggering amount of 1.15 crores (highest when it was sold). This implies that Aditya music is going to make a breakeven with the first batch of the audio itself. After initial frenzy, the sales would again gain momentum after film's release if film becomes a blockbuster. Hence the Aditya audio producer is eagerly waiting for Johnny to become a good hit so that he can mint money.\n\n23rd March 2003\n\nIt's teamwork for Teja\n\nIf you think that the films of Teja are the results of 'one-man-show', you are grossly mistaken. He let the right person do the right job and at the same time involve all the technicians that matter in making of the movie. You can find the choreographer Shankar and editor Shankar on the sets of Nijam most of the time though their presence is not required. They assist Teja in every possible dimension to make their own difference to the film. At the same time, when choreographer Shankar is directing the dances in the film, Teja does not even bother to have a look at the monitor of the shoot, as he believes his technicians so much. With so much of teamwork, Mahesh Babu's Nijam is coming out extremely well to satiate the unlimited expectations and thirst of Mahesh fans all over the world.\n\nIt's like shooting my first film - KL Narayana\n\nKshanakshanam, Hello Brother, Intlo Illalu Vantitlo Priyuralu, Dongodu and Santosham - there are the five consecutive hits delivered by KL Narayana of Durga Arts banner. When we spoke to KL Narayana recently, he opined that he is putting all his track record behind and working for his new venture with Tarun as if this is his first film. KL Narayana felt that though he puts all his honest hardwork in to the film, the luck has to favor in many ways to make the film become a blockbuster. It's nice to see such a humble producers who speak down-to-earth in spite of delivering blockbusters. The term 'hardwork' never betrayed anybody in the film industry.\n\nNavveen has no takers\n\nThe change of name is not changing the fortunes for the hero Navveen. Navveen changed his name from Naveen to Navveen. His latest flick Dhanush has been lying in docks for the past 9 months. There are no takers for his film. And the producer is not daring to release it on his own. Kiran Gill is making her debut in Telugu through this film. Dina - who made debut with disastrous 'Adrustam' - scored music for this film. N Srinivas is making his debut as director through 'Dhanush'.\n\n22nd March 2003\n\nUrvasi Sarada after a long gap\n\nUrvasi Sharada - the most versatile Telugu actress who made a name for herself in all South Indian Languages - is acting again in a Telugu film after a gap of almost 4 years. She last acted in Krishna Vamsi's faction film 'Anthahpuram'. This film is the production number 75 by Usha Kiron Movies. Kasi Viswanath - of Nuvvu Leka Nenu Lenu fame - is directing this film.

Chiranjeevi chose India to be his hot favorite for the world cup. The original choices of the two superstars of Telugu cinema are pitted against each other in the grand finale on 23rd of March 2003. Chiru and Balayya chose two teams and these two teams made it to the final. This incident proves the decision-making power and gut feelings of these two stars (Chiru and Balayya). We have to wait and see who wins the world cup! The AP film exhibitors are making every arrangement to exhibit cricket match live on big screen in each and every town. In Kakinada town, semi final matches were shown in 3 theaters.
