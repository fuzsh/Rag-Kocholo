        "text": "Personal Life:\n\nD.Ramanaidu was born in Karamchedu village in Prakasam district (now in Andhra Pradesh) into an agricultural family on 6 June 1936 to Daggubati Venkateswarlu and Lakshmi Devamma. He had done his schooling in his hometown and finished his college studies in Chirala. Later, he graduated from Chennai’s Presidency College. Ramanaidu married Daggubati Rajeswari in 1958 and the couple was blessed with three children Daggubati Suresh Babu (a producer), Daggubati Venkatesh (Telugu actor) and Daggubati Lakshmi. He had eight grandchildren including Rana Daggubati and Naga Chaitanya who are supreme actors in Telugu cinema. Rana Daggubati recently made his debut in Hindi cinema and has gained a lot of popularity with it as well.\n\nRamanaidu began his career as a rice-mill owner and later shifted to the transport business. Daggubati Venkateswarlu, his father along with one of his relatives, co-produced the Telugu film Nammina Bantu in 1958, where Ramanaidu acted as the dupe of Akkineni Nageshwara Rao in the film. During this while, Savitri, the female lead of the film advised him to go to Chennai and work with film-makers. Ramanaidu closed his rice mill and moved to Chennai in 1962. He initially wanted to start a brick business but later shifted to real estate. He got acquainted with the Telugu film fraternities during his visits to the 'Andhra Club'. He was the member of the Telugu Desam Party from the year 1999 to 2004 and represented Baptala constituency in Guntur District in the 13th Lok Sabha. Ramanaidu lost his seat in the 14th Lok Sabha in 2004.\n\nProfessional Career:\n\nRamanaidu joined his friends and co-produced ‘Anuragam’ in 1963 which was a commercially unsuccessful movie. After his first unsuccessful movie he gathered his strength and established his own production house namely Suresh Productions, and in 1964 produced ‘Ramudu Bheemudu’. He has produced many movies in the Telugu film industry such as Pratigna Palana in 1965, Sri Krishna Tulabharam in 1966, Shree Janma in 1967, Paapa Kosam in 1968 and Sepoy Chinnaiah in 1969. During this period Ramudu Bheemudu remained his only box-office success. Ramanaidu partnered with B. Nagi Reddy's sons in Chennai and established a company named 'Vijaya Suresh Combines' and produced some films under this banner. He produced Prem Nagar in 1971 starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Vanisri and the film was a huge box office success. This film was also remade in Tamil and Hindi entitled Vasantha Maligai (1972) and Prem Nagar (1974) respectively. Ramanaidu produced both the versions and the movies were equally successful. He produced few more Tamil films in 1970s like Tirumangalyam, Namma Kuzhaindagal, Kuzhaindaikaga, Deiva Piravi and Kuzhaindaikaga.\n\nRamanaidu, with the help of the state government, started 'Ramanaidu Studios' (Hyderabad) in 1983. Apart from Tamil and Telugu cinema, he also produced movies in different languages including Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Oriya, Bhojpuri, Punjabi and Gujarati. He has also produced some of the greatest Hindi blockbusters such as Tohfa, Dildar, Anari, Aaghaaz and Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain. Till today, he produced more than 150 films in 13 different Indian languages. He has also acted in few films and for the first time in 2007, he played a full-length role in the Telugu film ‘Hope’. The film was based on teenage suicides arising out of educational stress. The film won the Best Film Award on Other Social Issues at the 54th National Film Awards.\n\nIll Health and Death:\n\nRamanaidu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2014.
