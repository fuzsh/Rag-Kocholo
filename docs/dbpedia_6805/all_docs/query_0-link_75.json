        "text": "If there is one person who has the patent on determination and constant reinvention in the Hindi film industry in recent times, it's Karisma Kapoor.\n\nShe was born with the Kapoor label, and was expected to debut under the best banners. No such luck.\n\nShe chose to opt out of Dharmendra's long-in-the-making Barsaat and made a lacklustre debut in D Rama Naidu's Prem Qaidi.\n\nThe film did well. But the teenaged Karisma came in for a lot of flak for parading around in swimsuits and hot pants. Her looks were criticised as well.\n\n\"She's too fair!\" said some.\n\n\" With her blue eyes, she looks like a foreigner,\" said others.\n\n\"She's got manly features,\" cried some others.\n\nUndeterred, Karisma made her tracks upwards, in a bid to prove her mettle as a capable performer. No parties, no scandals. She modelled herself after her idols, Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit.\n\nBut controversies dogged her in the form of Sexy sexy and Sarkailo khatiya. Women's organisations and the media ripped the actress apart.\n\nThe one good thing that emerged from this brouhaha was the successful Karisma-Govinda pairing. With, of course, director David Dhawan completing the successful trio.\n\nEven though Karisma consistently delivered hits, recognition as a capable actress eluded her. Enter Raja Hindustani, where she turned in a performance with amazing restraint.\n\nThat was the turning point of her career. She won a Filmfare Award for her role.\n\nKarisma's looks underwent a transformation. Out went the gaudy make-up and flashy outfits. In came pastel shades, straight hair and a demure look.\n\nIf she had a Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge, she also had a Dil To Pagal Hai. If she had an Aashiq, she also had a Fiza. If she had a Chal Mere Bhai, she also had a Zubeidaa.\n\nThat is perhaps what is commendable about the actress. The fact that she successfully replaced the nymphet image with that of an actress. The fact that she did not let criticism faze her and worked with single-minded purpose to fulfil her passion for films and acting."
