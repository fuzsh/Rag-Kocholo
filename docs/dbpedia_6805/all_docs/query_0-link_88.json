        "text": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Venkatesh-talks-about-being-Ramanaidus-son/articleshow/46313708.cms\n\nPeople often ask me what it means to be Ramanaidugaru's son. For an answer, I look back at my own life... What do I find? Memories of a simple, happy, magical childhood... Growing up in Madras, running around on the beach, playing marbles, flying kites, winning prizes at birthday parties. Those were the small joys I had as a little boy. You were already on the way to becoming the Movie Mogul back then, but we didn't have a clue. You kept us cocooned from the highs and lows of your film life. For us, you and amma were just that — Nanna and Amma. You always had ample time for us. I still remember those road trips we took in your Ambassador to our village Karamchedu. We'd pullover anywhere enroute and share a simple lunch under the shade of a tree by the road. That's the childhood you gave us. Normal. Happy.\n\nAnd yet, for you, we were always special...\n\nYou would casually ask Suresh and me to share our thoughts about a story that you had just heard. You took our opinion. But you never forced yours on us. You never pushed us into something which we weren't ready for. When I said I wanted to go abroad to study, you let me follow my heart. You gave me the space to be me.\n\nAnd just like that, you inspired me to follow your footsteps...\n\nI had never imagined that one day I would carry forward your great legacy. But you were so inspiring, I guess it couldn't have been any other way. I think it all started with watching you discuss films with friends at home. That costume room on the top floor of our house — that was my window to your movie world back then. i would sneak into it and try out different clothes and practice dialogues in front of the mirror. Those were perhaps the early signs of me embracing my destiny of becoming an actor. And you allowed that process to evolve naturally...\n\nYou never lost faith...\n\nAfter you launched me with Kaliyuga Pandavulu, I had a spate of flops. A lot of people said you made a huge mistake by launching me as an actor. I was confused. But you had faith in me. 'Don't worry about what they say,' you said, and gave me your simple mantra: 'Just be sincere to your job and work harder.' It was a principle that you followed from the day you left Karamchedu to enter film industry back in the early 60s. And you passed that on to me.\n\nYou taught us that highs and lows don't matter...\n\nYou didn't let any of it get to our heads. I can't think of a single day when we were overjoyed by a film's success or unduely sad due to a failure. You showed us how to keep things simple and be honest about our filmmaking. You taught us to take risks and yet, not became too ambitious. Some of the biggest production houses of our time have crashed because of one big failure. But we survived. If it wasn't for you none this would have been possible.\n\nYet you were so humble...\n\nI have rarely come across anyone as simple as you. You taught us that little things matter — like eating together as a family whenever we are in the same city. It is moments like these that have defined my life and taught me the importance of relationships and family bonds. The most important lesson I learnt from you is that 'Money is not a measure of success, people are.'\n\nYou taught us to treat everyone with respect. I follow your advice so seriously, that people often say 'Babu... you've been acting for 28 years, you don't have to be on the sets sharp on time. Others struggle to be as punctual as you are.' The truth is I can't help it. I joke that it's a vyasana (habit) that I got from you. Perhaps this what it means to be Ramanaidu's son.... When I look back at life, I can't thank you enough. Thank you nanna, for the values and principles. Thank you for the family time. Thank you for the life lessons. Thank you for being you...\n\nWe are because of you.\n\n- Venkatesh"
