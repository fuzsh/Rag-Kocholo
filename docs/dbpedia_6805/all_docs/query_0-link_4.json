        "text": "The film industry lost an icon with the demise of the veteran film producer, D Ramanaidu on Wednesday. Amidst personalities from the film industry and politics, the road outside Rama Naidu Studios filled with hundreds of movie fans who waited in long queues to get a last glimpse of the movie mogul, with the funeral being held later today.\n\nActor and Ramanaidu's grandson, Rana Daggubati looked distraught as he accepted condolences alongside his father, film producer Suresh Babu, and uncle and superstar, Venkatesh. He tweeted a picture of his grandfather describing him as his \"superhero.\" Fighting a battle agaist prostrate cancer, Rama Naidu breathed his last yesterday, aged 79.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe chief minister of Telangana, K Chandrashekar Rao offered condolences to the Daggubati family. N Chandra Babu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, who described Rama Naidu's contribution to the Indian film industry with films that he produced in 13 languages including Oriya and English besides southern and Hindi cinema as \"commendable.\"\n\nPolitician and former actor Jayaprada too recalled working with him as \"an enriching experience. From his first film to the last, and with every milestone including the Dada Saheb Phalke award that he was conferred with in 2009, the Padma Bhushan in 2012 and beyond, it has been a truly momentous cinematic journey.\" He holds the Guinness Book of World records for the most number of films produced by an individual, with nearly 150 films.\n\nHe is known for having introduced several new faces to the industry and giving many new directors and technicians a break, \"over a rich journey spanning more than five decades,\" as politician and industrialist T Subbarami Reddy mentioned.\n\nTalking of his two-decade-long acquaintance with Ramanaidu, filmmaker Mani Shankar says, \"besides being a film producer par excellence, I've always known him as a wonderful human being with a golden heart and a humbleness worthy of reverence. A true karmayogi, he was a hands-on producer, wielding the megaphone and involving himself in his films with passion and dedication. It's a privilege to have known him.\"\n\nComing from a family of farmers, Ramanaidu made his mark in the film industry after having taken up various jobs initially. His stint with the film industry came about folliwng his association with legendary actor Akkineni Nageswara Rao and other noted actors of the time including SV Ranga Rao and Gummadi. The Telugu superhit film, Ramudu Bheemudu was the first film he produced under the Suresh Productions in 1964 and since then the production house has produced several noteworthy films including Soggadu, Prema, Indrudu Chandrudu, Prem Nagar, Tohfa, Insaf ki Awaz and Prem Quidi, in which Karishma Kapoor debuted. His last film, Gopala Gopala adapted from the Hindi film, Oh My God, starring Venkatesh and Pawan Kalyan was a hit as well and he was involved in its making despite his deteriorating health."
