        "text": "Early life\n\nD.Ramanaidu was born on 6 June 1936 into an agricultural family in Karamchedu, a village in Prakasam district in the present day Andhra Pradesh. He completed his schooling in the village and had his college education in Chirala and later graduated out of the Presidency College, Chennai. He started his career as a rice-mill owner and later got into transport business. During this time his father joined with a relative and co-produced the Telugu film Nammina Bantu (1958) starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Savitri. He performed the dupe of Rao in the film. The latter advised him to get to Madras (now Chennai) and work with film-makers. He closed down his rice mill as he was not happy with it, and moved to Madras in 1962. He intended to start a brick business but later switched to real estate. His frequent visits to the \"Andhra Club\" got him acquainted with the Telugu film fraternities.\n\nFilm career\n\nIn 1963, Ramanaidu partnered with his friends Tagirisa Hanumantha Rao, Yarlagadda Lakshmaiah Chowdary and co-produced the commercially unsuccessful Anuragam (1963). Following that, he established his own production house, Suresh Productions, and produced Ramudu Bheemudu (1964). Until the early 1970s, he kept to Telugu cinema and made films such as Pratigna Palana (1965), Sri Krishna Tulabharam (1966), Shree Janma (1967), Paapa Kosam (1968) and Sepoy Chinnaiah (1969). Ramudu Bheemudu remained his only box-office success during this period. While in Madras, he partnered with B. Nagi Reddy's sons and formed a company called \"Vijaya Suresh Combines\" and made some films under the house. In 1971, he produced Prem Nagar, starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Vanisri. The film went on to become a \"blockbuster\" and its success prompted Tamil and Hindi remakes entitled Vasantha Maligai (1972) and Prem Nagar (1974), respectively. Both versions were produced by him and became equally successful. Namma Kuzhaindagal, Tirumangalyam, Madhurageetham, Kuzhaindaikaga and Deiva Piravi are some of his Tamil productions that were made during the 1970s.\n\nAs all the studios were based in Madras at that date, he started \"Ramanaidu Studios\" in Hyderabad with the help of the state government in 1983. While frequently making films in Telugu and Tamil, he branched out into the Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Bengali, Oriya film, Gujarati, Bhojpuri and Punjabi industries. His Hindi films include Dildaar, Tohfa, Anari, Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain and Aaghaaz. As of 2015, he had made more than 130 films in 13 Indian languages. The feat earned him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2008. Ramanaidu also acted in a few films, mostly his own productions. He played a full-length role for the first time in the 2007 Telugu film Hope. The film, which dealt with teenage suicides arising out of educational stress among students, won the award for Best Film on Other Social Issues at the 54th National Film Awards.\n\nFamily and personal life\n\nRamanaidu got married in 1958 and had three children, two sons and a daughter. His elder son Daggubati Suresh Babu is a producer; his younger son Daggubati Venkatesh is an actor in Telugu cinema. He had eight grandchildren, two of whom – Rana Daggubati and Naga Chaitanya – are actors in Telugu cinema.\n\nRamanaidu was a member of the Telugu Desam Party and represented Baptala constituency in Guntur District in the 13th Lok Sabha from 1999 to 2004. He lost the 2004 election for the same seat in the 14th Lok Sabha.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nCivilian Honors\n\nPadma Bhushan - 2012\n\nNational Film Awards\n\nNational Film Award for Best Feature Film in Bengali – Asukh (1999)\n\nNational Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues - Hope (2006)\n\nDadasaheb Phalke Award - 2009\n\nNandi Awards\n\nNandi Award for Best Feature Film - Andhra Vaibhavam\n\nNandi Award for Best Feature Film - Preminchu (2001)\n\nRaghupathi Venkaiah Award - 2006\n\nTamil Nadu State Film Awards\n\nTamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film (Third prize) – Namma Kuzhanthaigal (1970)\n\nTamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film (Second prize) – Madhurageetham (1977)\n\nFilmfare Awards South\n\nFilmfare Award for Best Telugu Film – Jeevana Tarangalu (1973)\n\nFilmfare Award for Best Telugu Film – Soggadu (1976)\n\nFilmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South (2000)\n\nOther Honors\n\nHonorary doctorate from Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati\n\nDeath\n\nIn January 2014, it was reported that Ramanaidu had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
