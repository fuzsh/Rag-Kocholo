Chennai, Feb 3: Popular Telugu actor Rajasekar, who is also a doctor by profession, has been attending to producer D. Ramanaidu, who has been suffering from prostate cancer, over the last few months. “He has been on constant medical attention for some time now. We’re trying some alternate therapies on him and the result has been satisfactory. Although the cancer can’t be killed, efforts are being taken to make him feel comfortable,” Rajasekar told IANS.

The actor said that Ramanaidu’s condition is “not bad”. “It’s not good either. He’s reached a point where he has to be medically dependent day in day out,” he said. Popularly known as movie mogul, Ramanaidu has produced films in all Indian languages. Meanwhile, Rajasekar is awaiting the release of his Telugu comedy “Gaddam Gang” in cinemas Friday.
