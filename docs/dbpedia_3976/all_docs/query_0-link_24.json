        "text": "François Fillon belongs to the cohort of political figures of the same post-war generation as Nicolas Sarkozy. He adheres to the tradition of socially oriented Gaullism.\n\nHe was born in central France on March 4, 1954. His father was a notary, his mother was a teacher of history. There were four sons in their family. Francois got secondary education in the town of Le-Mans, and higher education at the law faculty in the University of Le-Mans and Paris University named after Rene Descartes. He has an MA in public law and a DEA public law and political sciences. In his youth he was interested in journalism.\n\nMr Fillon started his political career as an assistant to a member of the National Assembly representing Sarthe department, in 1976-77. He worked in the office of the Minister of Transport (1978-80), then in the office of the Minister of Defence during the presidency of Valery Giscard d'Estaing (1980-81). He became the chief of the legislative and parliamentary activity service in the Ministry of Industry in 1981.\n\nMr Fillon was elected to the National Assembly in 1981 as a member of the neo-Gaullist Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) representing the department of Sarthe. He was 27. Since that time he has been continually re-elected to the National Assembly.\n\nIn 1993-1995 he became Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research in the government of Edouard Balladur. In 1995-97 he was a minister-delegate for mail, telecommunications and space in the government of Аlain Juppé. In 2002-05 he was a minister for social issues, labour and solidarity in the government of Jean Pierre Raffarin. In particular, he pursued a policy of liberalising the 35-hour working week, and was also the author of a liberal reform of the pension fund scheme.\n\nIn the 1980s Mr Fillon was a national defence secretary in the UMP. For a long time he positioned himself as an opponent to Jacques Chirac, despite belonging to his party, supporting instead the more \"orthodox\" Gaullist F. Segen.\n\nHe was included into the election team of Nicolas Sarkozy as a political advisor in June, 2005. He is the author of the programme of the future President, and made a considerable contribution to Sarkozy's election campaign and resulting victory.\n\nMr Fillon was appointed Prime Minister of the French government on May 18, 2007, after Nicolas Sarkozy'a victory in the presidential elections.\n\nAs Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research, François Fillon visited Russia in November 1993, where he met heads of the Russian Ministry of Science and Technical Policy and the Russian Academy of Sciences, and visited some educational and scientific organisations. He is a supporter of deepening Franco-Russian relations in the spirit of traditional policy of partnership between the two countries.\n\nHis personality is quiet, smooth-tempered, cautious, and affable. He tends to avoid conflicts. He has worked at a particular style of communication with Nicolas Sarkozy, which allows them to maintain close and trusting relations even when they disagree. François Fillon has good organisational abilities.\n\nHe wrote the book \"France Can Stand the Truth\" (2006).\n\nHe likes auto racing, hiking, cycling, and mountain climbing.\n\nHe has been married to Penelope Clark since 1980 and has five children."
