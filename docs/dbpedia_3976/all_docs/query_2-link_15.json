        "text": "This fictional case features an expert from France’s Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) preparing the party’s healthcare platform for upcoming national elections. Defeated in the 2012, the center-right political party looks forward to winning the next presidential election. Healthcare is a critical issue. Francois Dubois, a leading health affairs strategist, has been asked by UMP’s leaders to design the party’s health platform. The French consider healthcare a public good yet rising healthcare costs make the current French system unsustainable Hence he must propose an economically sustainable plan that also aligns with conservative UMP values and appeals to the electorate. How can a new plan meet current and future health needs while making appropriate choices about cost reductions, regulations, disease prevention, system reorganization and revenue generation?\n\nThis case was used for the 2013 Global Health Case Competition at Emory University. Student teams made up of multi-disciplinary members present solutions to complex scenarios. In these situations, as is often true in real life, there is no one perfect solution but rather one that involves compromising and prioritizing. Cases from past competitions are available through the Emory Global Health Institute."
