        "text": "He urges young people to embrace Martin Luther King Jr. as a role model. He is a devotee of Hollywood movies, and his favorite author is Ernest Hemingway. He wrote a book preaching the gospel of the American work ethic to a nation that clings to a 35-hour workweek.\n\nNone of which may seem remarkable, except that the man in question -- Nicolas Sarkozy -- is running for president of France, which typically turns up its nose at such flagrant displays of Yankee Doodlism. And he is leading in all the polls.\n\n\"I don't see why my country doesn't take inspiration from its great ally,\" Sarkozy, former interior minister and now candidate of the ruling Union for a Popular Movement, wrote in his recently updated political autobiography. \"I love the value Americans place on work and the desire for excellence that you find everywhere.\"\n\nSarkozy's unabashed admiration of the United States has earned him the disparaging moniker \"Sarko the American.\" It contributes to his image among some French as the most controversial, divisive and contradictory of the mainstream candidates in the first round of the presidential voting on Sunday. If no one takes more than half the vote, the top two will compete in a runoff May 6.\n\n\"He is not the epitome of the average French guy -- he likes mobility, the capacity to anticipate, to change views, which is more American than French,\" said Philippe Ridet, a veteran French political reporter who has written a biography of Sarkozy. \"He likes Capra's and John Ford's America. Their films, in which your future can always be improved, fascinate him.\"\n\nAnathema to the French way of thinking\n\nSarkozy's overt American-style political ambition, coupled with his persona as the country's impetuous and tough-talking top cop, alarms some of his countrymen. They find little to emulate in American politics and complain that Sarkozy seems intolerant and alienating. On the campaign trail, he plugs longer workweeks, affirmative action, tax breaks for business -- American-inspired ideals that are anathema to the French way of thinking.\n\nBut Sarkozy is striking a chord with voters fed up with the political status quo, years of high unemployment and the country's declining stature on the international stage. In a nation that increasingly fears losing its identity to the shifting demographics of immigration, and domestic security to the growing restlessness and anger of the underclasses, Sarkozy's hard line on immigration and security appeals to many.\n\nWith the campaign in its final week, Sarkozy holds a lead over his closest rival, Socialist Ségolène Royal, ranging from three to seven points, according to recent polls of likely voters who have made up their minds. In one survey, 59 percent said they expect Sarkozy to be the next president.\n\nThe two other main contenders, François Bayrou of the small Union for French Democracy party, and Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigration National Front, trail Sarkozy by about 10 and 15 percentage points, respectively.\n\nPolitical analysts warn, however, that as many as 40 percent of likely voters remain undecided.\n\nA study in contradictions\n\nFor many people, Sarkozy, 52, is a study in contradictions.\n\nThe son of a Hungarian immigrant and a French-Greek woman whose father was Jewish, Sarkozy wants to tighten controls over new immigrants to France. He recently proposed creating a ministry for immigration and national identity, which some opponents said evoked images of the Vichy era.\n\nHe supports affirmative action-style programs to give minorities equal opportunities -- a radical departure from the country's traditional stance that inequality does not exist within its borders. But during the riots in the immigrant suburbs of Paris in fall 2005, he referred to rebellious youths as \"scum.\" Critics said that remark fueled the violence.\n\nAs the son of an immigrant, Sarkozy understands that immigrants must integrate into French society, but also the necessity to \"control clandestine immigration,\" according to political adviser Patrick Devedjian, a former industry minister.\n\n\"He is not 'the last one in who wants to close the door,' but he doesn't want the house to explode,\" Devedjian said. More than anything, he added, it is America's history as a \"mythical country for immigrants\" that drives Sarkozy's admiration for the United States.\n\nSarkozy's security detail is so concerned about his safety that he was unable until last week to stage a campaign event in a poor suburban area. When he held a rally in one of Paris's more upscale suburban neighborhoods several weeks ago, campaign workers refused to allow young French residents of African and Arab descent from a nearby community into the meeting, where Sarkozy addressed an audience of white, largely middle-age voters.\n\nYet last month he invoked Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech at a Paris rally and urged French minority youths to look to the U.S. civil rights leader as a role model.\n\n\"That dream of brotherhood and justice he spoke of changed America,\" Sarkozy told thousands of young supporters packed into a Paris auditorium on March 18. \"If the dream could change America, why might it not change France?\"\n\n\"He is indeed full of contradictions,\" said Ridet, the biographer. \"His personality is as contradictory as his ideas. Some people are afraid of him because he is not a reassuring person -- because of his contradictions, but also because he is not easy with people in general.\"\n\n'Fear factor' liability\n\nThat \"fear factor\" is one of Sarkozy's greatest liabilities, according to political analysts, pollsters and aides to the candidate.\n\nHis personal appearance -- hooded eyes framed by bushy eyebrows on an often dour face -- contributes to the stern image. Speechwriter Henri Guaino, one of Sarkozy's most trusted advisers, said some voters see him as \"harsh\" or describe him as \"a neo-con.\" But \"people are contradictory\" too, he said.\n\n\"On the one hand, they want authority, and on the other, they do not want aggressiveness,\" Guaino said during a recent interview at party headquarters, as campaign workers unloaded mountains of boxed posters and fliers in advance of the final campaign blitz. \"We don't know how to answer this fear. The only solution we found is for Sarkozy to be himself.\"\n\nThe candidate frets repeatedly in his autobiography that people who don't know him doubt he has a \"human side.\" Seeking to soften that impression, early in the campaign he opened his personal life to public view, posing with his wife, Cécilia, and their children for magazine spreads and cover shots. (They have one son together, and Sarkozy has two children from a previous marriage.) Such U.S.-style exposure of a politician's family was unheard of in France.\n\nSarkozy's efforts backfired several months later when the magazine Paris Match ran a cover photograph of his wife strolling in New York hand-in-hand with a man it identified as her lover. According to close associates and by his own accounts, Sarkozy was devastated, and rumors leaked of an extramarital affair of his own. French newspapers reported that he was so distraught over his collapsing marriage that he failed to show up for a major cabinet meeting.\n\n\"When Cécilia left him, we saw his cracks, and we realized he couldn't live on his own,\" said Ridet, who has covered Sarkozy for five years for the newspaper Le Monde.\n\nIn his book, Sarkozy conceded that he had exposed his wife to \"too much pressure, too many attacks and not enough attention from me. . . . Our relationship didn't hold up.\"\n\n\"Maybe this event forced me to show a bit of my human side that was no doubt lacking,\" he added. Although they are together again, his wife has no visible presence in the campaign.\n\nSarkozy has been a professional politician most of his life; by his own admission, he earned a law degree to fall back on in the event he failed at politics. He became one of the youngest French mayors in history after the mayor of the affluent Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine died and Sarkozy, his deputy, took over.\n\nHe leapt into the national limelight in 1993 when he helped negotiate a hostage crisis at the town's elementary school, where a man dubbed the \"Human Bomb\" strapped dynamite to himself and threatened to blow up a class full of children. The man was shot dead by police and all the children escaped unharmed.\n\nFrom protege to bitter adversary\n\nSarkozy was a protege of the current president, Jacques Chirac, but they became bitter adversaries in 1995 when Sarkozy abandoned his mentor and supported a party rival, Édouard Balladur, for president.\n\nNow, as much as any of the other candidates, Sarkozy is running against Chirac's legacy, including the way France tried to generate worldwide opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.\n\nEven though he has stated that France's decision not to join the war was correct, Sarkozy said in a visit to the United States last year, marking the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, that \"it's not appropriate to try and embarrass one's allies or give the impression of gloating over their difficulties.\"\n\n\"My devotion to our relationship with America is well known and has earned me substantial criticism in France,\" Sarkozy said in a speech to the French-American Foundation in Washington. \"I'm not a coward. I'm proud of this friendship, and I proclaim it gladly.\"\n\nIn the town halls of provincial France and the salons of Paris, however, Sarkozy plays down his affinity for America.\n\nAmong Frenchmen, said Manuel Aeschlimann, his campaign pollster, \"Sarkozy has to be careful when he deals with his attachment to the U.S. If he becomes president, he will improve French-U.S. relations, but he'll have to do it little by little, because public opinion is still suspicious.\"\n\nResearcher Corinne Gavard contributed to this report."
