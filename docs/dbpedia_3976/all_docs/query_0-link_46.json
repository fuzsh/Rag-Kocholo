        "text": "Charles Pasqua, the former French interior minister, who has died aged 88, was the Gaullist Party’s senior bruiser and a force to be reckoned with in French politics for several decades, until he backed the wrong horse in the 1995 presidential elections and later became implicated in a series of corruption scandals.\n\nA one-time ally of Jacques Chirac, in 1976 Pasqua helped Chirac set up the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and managed Chirac’s failed bid for the Élysée in 1981. Pasqua first served as interior minister under Chirac’s “cohabitation” government from 1986 to 1988, and then again under Edouard Balladur from 1993 to 1995.\n\nA colourful, blunt-spoken former drink salesman with a strong southern French accent, Pasqua was a refreshing contrast to the Grandes Écoles-educated political elite. He championed a “pur et dur” xenophobic nationalism in which law and order took precedence over civil rights. “On m’aime quand je cogne,” (“they love me when I hit hard”) was a favourite boast.\n\nColloquially known as “le premier flic de France”, Pasqua led a campaign for “zero immigration”, passing a series of measures (which became known as Pasqua’s laws) making it more difficult for immigrants to enter France and gain citizenship and allowing random identity checks, unrestricted car searches and summary internment. As a result, during his second term of office he became the government’s most popular minister, his status boosted still further in 1994 by the spectacular arrest and extradition from Sudan of the notorious terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal, and the rescue at the end of the year of passengers aboard an Air France plane that had been hijacked by four Algerian Islamic extremists.\n\nLike that of his hero Charles de Gaulle, Pasqua’s virulent nationalism frequently targeted the United States . In 1994, without informing the French foreign minister Alain Juppé, he summoned the American ambassador Pamela Harriman to give her a dressing-down over the alleged economic espionage activities of the CIA in France, five of whose operatives were subsequently expelled. It was Pasqua who reportedly leaked news of the affair to the press.\n\nA month later he was alleged to have engineered, again without consulting Juppé, a back-room deal to sell Exocet missiles to Iran in violation of a Nato arms embargo . When Juppé complained after the story broke, Pasqua was unapologetic. “What pleases or doesn’t please some other minister is of no importance,” he said.\n\nIt was Pasqua’s combative nationalism, too, that led to a rift with Chirac. In 1992, Pasqua and Philippe Seguin challenged Chirac to lead his party in a vote against the Maastricht treaty. Chirac’s refusal, and his rejection the following year of Pasqua’s advice to boycott a new coalition government (to force a showdown with President Mitterand), infuriated Pasqua. Even worse, Édouard Balladur, a man Pasqua despised as a centrist, was nominated prime minister.\n\nPasqua owed much of his influence, and the mistrust with which he was generally regarded, to his skill in operating behind the scenes. Much of his “parallel diplomacy” was conducted through the military chiefs of Algeria, with whom he remained in close contact. In France he cultivated the image of a man who knew everyone’s secrets, often unsettling visitors to his office with the greeting “Ah, my friend, you remind me that it’s been a long time since I looked over your file.”\n\nPasqua’s influence was clear in the run-up to the 1995 presidential elections, when the US granted political asylum to the dissident French journalist Ali Auguste Bourequat, tacitly accepting his claims that Pasqua’s agents had threatened him and planted listening devices in his Paris apartment. At around the same time it was alleged that, at Pasqua’s insistence, Balladur had approved a police plan to bug the telephone of the father-in-law of a judge who was investigating allegations of illicit party financing in Pasqua’s political stronghold of Hauts-de-Seine, west of Paris. The wiretap was later declared illegal by a French court, which ruled that the scheme was a blatant attempt to interfere with the corruption investigation.\n\nIn Britain, such allegations about a prominent politician would have been a gift to opponents. In France, however, none of the presidential candidates publicly commented on the Bourequat asylum decision and the wiretapping affair quietly vanished from the campaign debate.\n\nPasqua’s disenchantment with Chirac led him to support Balladur in the elections, but the decision cost him his job when Chirac won. After the elections, Pasqua became more critical of the EU and in 1999 he left the RPR, accusing the party of abandoning its defence of French sovereignty, to co-found the Rally for France (RPF) to fight against the influence of Brussels. “The single market,” he said, “is a market of dupes. We’ve thrown open our frontiers but others … are less disposed to do the same. If we don’t make some effort to look after ourselves, nobody else will do it for us.”\n\nIn 2004 Pasqua became implicated in the first of a series of scandals when American officials alleged that he and other senior French figures had received millions of dollars in the “oil for food” scandal orchestrated by Saddam Hussein . A US Senate panel alleged that Pasqua had received “lucrative oil allocations” in kickbacks from Baghdad. Pasqua denied the allegations.\n\nLater the same year a special French court charged Pasqua with offences in three cases of alleged corruption while he was France’s interior minister, involving the granting of a casino licence and hundreds of thousands of dollars of alleged illicit payments from businesses. At the same time investigating judges were reported to be seeking to prosecute him over half a dozen other cases . In 2009, Pasqua was sentenced to three years in prison, of which two were suspended, for receiving payments in return for lobbying for a €530 million sale of arms to Angola in the 1990s, when such sales were subject to a UN embargo. Determined not to go down without a fight, Pasqua accused François Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac, Édouard Balladur and Alain Juppé of having been aware of the deal . There was little surprise when, in 2011, the appeals court in Paris overturned his conviction.\n\nCharles Pasqua was born on April 18 1927 to a poor expatriate Corsican family in Grasse, southern France. His father was a local policeman and his mother worked in a scent distillery. As a clan, the Pasquas set up a wartime Resistance network from the moment they knew de Gaulle had flown to London. After the war Pasqua became a member of de Gaulle’s Rally for the French People (RPF), imbibing his political ethos that French glory is best defined by standing up to the United States.\n\nAfter studying law at university and a period of unemployment, Pasqua was taken on as junior salesman by Paul Ricard’s pastis firm in Marseille. By the time he became Ricard’s national sales director, the anis-based drink had become a market leader.\n\nIn the early 1960s, at a time of far-Right fury at de Gaulle’s abandonment of French Algeria, Pasqua founded the Service d’Action Civique (SAC), a parallel security service known for its violent methods, to protect the great man from assassination. Later on he arranged mass demonstrations in support of de Gaulle. In 1968, following the student uprising, he organised a march of a million middle class protestors on the Champs Elysées, which saved de Gaulle from being forced out of office. Strangely, though, he only ever met the great leader once — for a brief handshake.\n\nIt was Georges Pompidou who spotted Pasqua’s potential. During the student crisis, the prime minister called Pasqua and asked how long it would take his men to seize control of the state broadcasting organisation. “About one hour,” came the reply. Pompidou said he did not like jokes: “If I take the liberty of saying one hour,” Pasqua replied, “it is because my men have already been in there for several days. Everything is already sewn up and locked down.”\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973, Pasqua was deputy to the French National Assembly for the Hauts-de-Seine for the UDR party, of which he became a leading member, helping Jacques Chirac to take the leadership of the party and transform it into the RPR. From 1981 to 1986 he was senator for the Hauts-de-Seine, then president of the RPR group in the Senate.\n\nIn appointing Pasqua interior minister in 1986 Chirac ignored advice from across the political spectrum. The new finance minister, Edouard Balladur, predicted that the whole government would be at the mercy of Pasqua’s verbal and political blunders.\n\nIt seemed Balladur was right when Pasqua’s early promise to “terrorise the terrorists” was derailed by a series of bomb attacks and assassinations. But within months Pasqua had bounced back. His police force arrested all of the top leaders of the Action Directe terrorist group and dismantled another pro-Iranian terrorist group that had planted a series of bombs. At the same time, behind-the-scenes efforts by close allies of Pasqua, bypassing the Quai d’Orsay, led to the release of 10 French hostages held in Lebanon just before the presidential election of May 1988 which Chirac lost to Mitterrand.\n\nAfter Chirac’s defeat, Pasqua began to move away from the man he regarded as his protégé and even flirted with Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front. After founding the Eurosceptic RPF, he allied himself with Philippe de Villiers’s Movement for France (MPF) party for the 1999 European elections, in which he won more seats than the RPR.\n\nIn 2002 Pasqua decided to run for president, but dropped out before the race began. He was re-elected senator of the Hauts-de-Seine in 2004 on the list of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP, successor to RPR) ."
