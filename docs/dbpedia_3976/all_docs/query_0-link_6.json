        "text": "From Jim Bittermann\n\nCNN Senior Correspondent\n\nYOUR E-MAIL ALERTS\n\n(CNN) -- The show looked like a presidential rally, and some in the hall believed it was, but Nicolas Sarkozy, the ambitious, and hyper kinetic follower of Jacques Chirac, had, in principle, simply come to accept the leadership of Chirac's political party.\n\nBut in reality, at the meeting dubbed the \"Sarko show,\" Sarkozy became the French president's rival in chief when he won a ballot to become head of the Union for a Popular Movement.\n\nThe weekend rally of the party faithful, which reportedly cost 7 million euros ($9.28m) was just the latest and most complicated episode in a political love-hate relationship that has kept political oracles here intrigued for years.\n\nChirac has been Sarkozy's confident and mentor. He drew the son of Hungarian immigrants into his private circle twenty years ago, at times, promoting his career by appointing him to high office.\n\nBut Sarkozy backed the wrong candidate, Eduard Balladur, Chirac's competitor in the 1995 presidential contest, and insiders say the president refused to speak to his disciple for the next three years.\n\nStill Sarkozy's ambition to walk through the presidential palace gates and call it home, was not to be denied. And Chirac recognized his junior's popularity and drive.\n\nChirac made him the interior minister, a position some thought was a poisoned chalice, especially because of touchy issues like relations with France's large Muslim community.\n\nBut Sarkozy went from strength to strength, even succeeding at organizing a joint Islamic council for the first time.\n\n\"He is very convincing when he talks with you, he convinces you. That's his talent. That's why people believe in him,\" said Anita Hauser, a political editor at LCI-TV.\n\nAnalysts say that behind the palace gates, it is impossible to say exactly what relationship Sarkozy has with the president these days.\n\nThey were smiling when they parted just over a week ago.\n\nBut the two definitely differ. Sarkozy, who was elected party leader with more than 85 percent of the vote, has great appeal among young people and his remarks emphasized change and the need to modernize France.\n\nDespite his clear intention of becoming France's next president, Sarkozy has stopped short of saying he will directly confront Chirac for the job.\n\nBut between now and the elections in 2007 it seems certain the party Chirac created, will divide between his followers and those who support his protege.\n\nClick Here to try 4 Free Trial Issues of Time!"
