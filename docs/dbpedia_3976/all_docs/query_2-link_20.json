        "text": "September 30, 1962 Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta establish The National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in Fresno California. They adopt the motto “Viva la Causa!” or “Long Live the Cause”. January 21, 1963 The National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) holds a constitutional convention in Fresno California, naming Chávez president and Dolores Huerta, Julio Hernandez, and Gilbert Padilla vice presidents. 1965 The US Government terminates the Bracero Program, and the grape boycott begins on September 16, 1965. August 22, 1966 The Fillipino Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and The National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) are consolidated and become the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). 1966-1970 The UFWOC mobilizes the first grape boycott. Organizers picket outside grocery stores across the nation and Canada and spread awareness of the movement in Europe. March 17, 1966 Chávez and about 100 farm workers commence a 300 mile pilgrimage from Delano to California’s capitol in Sacramento broadcasted on television, passing by vineyards where they had previously worked. The march ends on April 11, 1966 (Easter Sunday) with over 10,000 protesters ascending the UFW flag and images of the Virgen de Guadalupe. April 3, 1966 Schenley Industries recognizes Chávez’ union, marking the first time a major corporation acknowledges a farm union. Schenley agrees to provide the farmworkers with better working conditions and wages. 1967 UFWOC and Teamsters, another labor union, sign an agreement recognizing the right of UFWOC to organize farmworkers and the authorization of the Teamsters to organize among truck drivers, canary workers, and other agricultural laborers. January 1968 UFWOC declares a national boycott of California grapes to bring awareness to the farm workers' struggle against unfair working conditions. February 14, 1968 César Chávez begins to fast in protest of farmworker exploitations. He receives the support of Martin Luther King Jr. and ends his 25 day fast with Robert Kennedy sitting next to him on March 10, 1968. December 1970 About 150 grape growers in California, including Giumarra Vineyards, the largest grape grower, sign labor contracts with the UFWOC, granting farmworkers a rise of wages, healthcare benefits, and protections on pesticide exposure.\n\nAugust 27, 1970\n\nFarm workers from the Salinas Valley protest unfair contracts with Teamsters and mobilize a strike against 40 Salinas Valley growers, who suffered a US $2.2 million loss. August 31, 1970 InterHarvest signs a two-year labor contract with UFWOC contract benefiting 1,000 Salinas Valley field workers who had contracts under Teamsters. November 1970 The UFWOC signs contracts with Freshpict, Pic-N-Pac, and the D’Arrigo company. The UFWOC keeps on mobilizing strikes and boycotts across the Salinas Valley. December 4, 1970 A California court finds Chávez guilty of contempt of court and sentences him to a fine of $1,000 and imprisonment until UFWOC terminates all strikes. He receives visits from Coretta Scott King and Ethel Kennedy. After three weeks, the California Supreme Court orders his release and allows the strikes and boycotts to continue. March 26, 1971 Teamsters signs a three-year contract with UFWOC, transferring all Salinas Valley labor contracts to UFW. This ends the lettuce strike and boycott. 1972 The United Farm Workers Organizing Committee UFWOC renames itself to the United Farm Workers (UFW) and organized to defeat Proposition 22, also known as Agricultural Labor Relations Initiative, which would have limited the farmworkers’ right to protest. 1973 Union farm workers march through California’s Coachella and Imperial Valleys to protest non-citizen farm labor. June 1975 The Agricultural Labor Relations Act enables farmworkers to elect their union representatives. 1979 UFW contracts expire and an upsurge in strikes and boycotts leads to 30,000 new contracts with higher wages, prevention of pesticide exposure, better healthcare plans, and paid vacations."
