        "text": "Since returning to the helm of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (U.M.P.), six months ago, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been looking for ways to distract the nation from the divisive appeal of Marine Le Pen’s National Front, from the small triumphs of what is otherwise a desperately unpopular Socialist administration, and from an accumulating pile of lawsuits. His party’s victory in regional elections in March was a good start, which he helped along by flirting with the far-right National Front’s electorate, promising that, in line with French values, all public-school students would be required to eat pork for lunch. But his latest move is his most virtuosic yet: he is changing the name of the party. Sarkozy’s new outfit will be called “Les Républicains.”\n\nFor the U.M.P., a name change is not an unorthodox play—the party has done it five times in the past seventy years. In 1947, Charles de Gaulle founded the Rassemblement du Peuple Français (R.P.F.), the blueprint for the modern conservative party, which has taken on a new name about once a decade, as party leaders have attempted to consolidate power and occasionally distance themselves from scandal. Sarkozy’s motivation is, in part, an affair that has become known as Bygmalion, in which eleven million euros in false invoices were billed to the U.M.P. to hide overspending on Sarkozy’s unsuccessful reëlection campaign. Bygmalion forced the previous U.M.P. leader, Jean-François Copé, to step down, but it somehow hasn’t yet definitely touched Sarkozy. Since de Gaulle, French conservatives have rallied under three anodyne terms that yield three-letter acronyms (de Gaulle’s R.P.F. and U.N.R., Jacques Chirac’s R.P.R. and U.M.P.). A conservative splinter group called the Parti Républicain was founded in the nineteen-seventies, but for mainstream conservatism Sarkozy is opting for a radical break.\n\n“Why do I hold tight to the word ‘Republic’?” Sarkozy asked during a speech in Nice, in April. “Because each one among us here today must know what he owes to the Republic. And the difference between the left and us is that the left is Socialist first, and then Republican; we are Republicans first, then Gaullist, liberal, centrist, radical. It’s a big difference,” he said, finishing with an authoritative flourish of the hand. This is immaculate posturing on Sarkozy’s part—far-right voters know that the idea of putting the Republic first speaks to their concerns about the changing face of France, while the phrasing allows Sarkozy to avoid charged and xenophobic invocations of “national identity.”\n\nThe difficulty, for Sarkozy, is that any graduate of L’Éducation Nationale can tell you what it means to be a subject of the French Republic—that is, a Republican—and Sarkozy’s attempt to appropriate the term has been viewed as a violation of the social pact, even by members of the U.M.P. “By definition, the Republic gathers together people who have different conceptions of the general interest, but who identify with something greater,” Edouard Philippe, a U.M.P. deputy who is allied with one of Sarkozy’s interparty rivals, told Libération. “In calling ourselves ‘The Republicans,’ it’s as though we are emptying the Republic of its meaning. I find that dangerous.” A group of attorneys and civil-society organizations filed a petition in court to try to stop Sarkozy from “monopolizing” the term, but the court found the claim to be baseless. “When the Republican Guard marches down the Champs-Élysées, children are going to wonder why the Sarkozian Guard is marching!” one of the attorneys complained.\n\nBewilderingly, Sarkozy doesn’t seem to be bothered by the name’s most obvious problems. Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are not popular politicians in Europe, let alone in France, where their party’s antics are often seen as symptomatic of the worst strains of American provincialism. Accordingly, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis, the secretary of the rival Socialist Party, prepared to coat Paris in twenty thousand flyers bearing a red-and-blue-star-studded image of Sarkozy, in jeans and a checked oxford shirt, sleeves rolled back and smirking through blackened Ray-Bans, atop (of all things) a white horse, “Texan-cowboy-style,” as Le Figaro put it. “Nicolas Sarkozy is fascinated by the American right, and George W. Bush in particular,” Cambadélis explained on the radio a few weeks ago, deploying a name that amounts to a virulent insult in French political culture.\n\nSarkozy is putting the name change to a vote at a U.M.P. Party congress in Paris this weekend, though its adoption is more or less a fait accompli. It is also only a preamble to the next movement of Sarkozy’s career, another run for the Presidency, in 2017, which looks increasingly likely to succeed. When Sarkozy ran for President for the first time, in 2007, his populist gloss, his unabashedly capitalistic tastes, and his fearlessness in the face of the unions were seen as a novelty in French politics. “A decade ago, it would have been inconceivable to have found a Parisian intellectual like the writer Pascal Bruckner supporting a rightist candidate like Sarkozy,” David Rieff wrote in the Times Magazine at the time. “But as Bruckner put it to me recently, Sarkozy ‘wants to give a kick in the rear to our old, decrepit country, to put an end to the French feeling of self-hatred.’”\n\nNow Sarkozy’s style is no longer novel, but as a prospective candidate he may be benefiting from a dearth of other options. A recent poll revealed that seventy-seven per cent of French voters do not want Socialist President François Hollande to run for reëlection. Surely, much of the disregard for the current President has to do with his rhetorical deficits: in 2013, in one of the more memorable moments of his Presidency, he made an offer of amnesty to a deported Kosovar child while sounding, as usual, like he was establishing a bureaucratic subcommittee. And yet, Le Figaro reports, he is preparing his candidacy for 2017. Many have proposed that he stand down and allow Prime Minister Manuel Valls, a far more talented front man, to take the lead. Another poll in early May showed that seventy per cent of voters prefer a Valls candidacy, though a current matchup shows Valls losing to Sarkozy.\n\nSarkozy has been reminding the public of the unscripted delights of Sarkozyisme. In one address, he criticized two Socialist ministers, exclaiming that in “the unbridled battle for mediocrity, Christiane Taubira is about to be surpassed by Najat Vallaud-Belkacem.” Both Taubira and Vallaud-Belkacem are women of color, and Cambadélis, the Socialist leader, was quick to remark that Sarkozy’s criticisms were “almost xenophobic.” “I never understood how someone could be almost xenophobic,” Sarkozy hit back. “Cambadélis is not almost stupid.”\n\nAlmost ten years after he assumed the Presidency, however, he has acquired some serious political liabilities. Pending lawsuits allege that Sarkozy accepted fifty million euros in campaign donations from Muammar Qaddafi, and conspired with his lawyer to obtain sealed information about the Qaddafi investigation by promising a judge a post in Monaco. He has picked up other bizarre alliances along the way. Lately, Sarkozy appears to have adopted an apologist stance on Vladimir Putin, putting himself at odds with most mainstream Western leaders. He stated during a party meeting in February that “Crimea chose Russia—we cannot reproach them for that,” and added, “It is certainly necessary to find the means to intervene to protect the Russophones in Ukraine so long as the situation there has not calmed down.” This may be more posturing, an attempt to make a show of support for the conservative values associated with the Russian President, but it will be a big problem for him should he retake the Presidency.\n\nThere is ample room right now in French politics for a serious third-party alternative, someone or some group who could leave behind the most tired strains of both the left and the right. At the moment, that space is being filled not by a credible figure but by Marine Le Pen, who, after a falling-out with her father, is reportedly also considering a name change for her party. Le Pen’s choice might be even more inflammatory than Sarkozy’s: she has proposed dropping “National Front” in favor of “Les Patriotes.”"
