The Union for a Popular Movement was a conservative and Gaullist party in France, founded on 17 November 2002 and dissolved on 30 May 2015. The UMP merged several center-right parties, including the Union for French Democracy and the Rally for the Republic, and President of France Jacques Chirac served as its first leader; continuing the tradition of having a left-wing foreign policy, Chirac refused to commit France to the Iraq War in 2003. Later, Nicolas Sarkozy was also elected as President. The UMP rivaled the Socialist Party of France for control of the government, and it lost 2015 elections; it was renamed to "The Republicans" that same year.
