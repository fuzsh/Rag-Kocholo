I use the term “savage” as a describer of a person/action which is bold, badass, or brutally honest. These are positive traits in my opinion.

I did apologize to the individual in the conversation, and explained to them exactly what I’ve written above. I now understand how the word would be used in a derogatory manner toward Indigenous peoples.
