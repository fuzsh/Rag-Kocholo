        "text": "You can’t top pigs with pigs, but apparently you can top dogs with dogs. At least, you can if the author of the book says it’s okay. Why he decided to write sequel to Old Yeller when the main character and the heart of the story dies in the end is beyond me, but here we are. I think we can put that box of tissues away, though….\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nWalt Disney bought the rights to Savage Sam, Fred Gipson’s followup to Old Yeller before the book was ever published. You’d think having the book’s author, the same screenwriter (William Tunberg, with assistance from Gipson), almost the entire cast, and a whole lot of experience writing Westerns, they’d be able to pull together something decent. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. In the year between Walt buying the film rights and the book’s publication, Gipson’s life took several tragic turns. His son Mike found their family dog clubbed to death and took it so hard he killed himself shortly after. Shortly after that, his wife left him. He turned to drink to cope with these horrible catastrophes and ended up an alcoholic who was often too drunk to work on the film.\n\nWell, that’s promising. The reviews match the film’s troubled production. Savage Sam tanked at the box office and earned overwhelmingly negative reviews for being cliched, melodramatic, formulaic, and dull. They also felt that Norman Tokar’s direction didn’t fit the script at all. One thing’s for sure, the age of the Disney Western is truly over. These things haven’t pleased crowds in a very long time, and that’s not just the bias of a modern-day reviewer who endured like twenty of these things in a row. And that’s not the only end-of-an-era this film marks. Old Yeller was the first time we saw Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran act together as brothers, so it’s only fitting and proper that its sequel would be the last. We’ll see both of them together again a few more times, but not together. If only it didn’t look like they went out with such a travesty of a film.\n\nAlso, the dog-lover in me has a nit to pick. The puppy at the end of Old Yeller was very clearly a purebred golden retriever. Old Yeller was a lab/mastiff mix. Savage Sam here is very clearly neither of those things, but a bluetick coonhound. In fairness, his mother was a coonhound, but the fact remains that the dog should probably look more like this. It’s a stupid thing but it’s been bothering me since I started researching this one, okay?\n\nSTORY\n\nJust like his dad, Savage Sam starts things off by stealing meat from the smokehouse. Little Arliss catches him and scolds him and ye gods Kevin Corcoran has grown up since the last time he played this character. You can really hear his voice crack when he screeches at Jumper the mule for getting into the corn patch. Travis calls him in for a breakfast of bacon and mush, the same thing they’ve had for weeks now. It’s not his fault. It’s the only thing Travis knows how to cook, and their parents are both in San Antonio taking care of their sick grandmother. It’s a pretty good excuse for not being able to get Dororthy Mcguire or Fess Parker back. Parents or not, the chores still need to get done, so Travis uses the promise of the hunt to convince Arliss to milk their cow.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance, Arliss goes out to milk, singing Old Dan Tucker (which we also heard in So Dear to my Heart!) as he goes. The effect the promise of bloodshed has on this child truly amazes me. You’ll see what I mean in a minute. Pretty soon, some kittens creep out of the barn, and Arliss makes a game of squirting milk into their cute little kitty faces. Sam lunges in, barking like crazy, to chase the cats and ends up terrifying the cow and creating mass chaos in the barn. Travis runs out to see what all the commotion’s about, calms the cow down, and rips into Arliss for being a terror. Arliss screams right back that he’s not Mama and he never will be, then threatens to bash Travis with a bucket for bossing him around. When Travis approaches to try to get things back in order, Arliss starts flinging huge rocks at him and sics the dog on his ankles!\n\nTravis takes refuge from his brother’s rather concerning violence in a shed. Lucky for him, their Uncle Beck rides up to check on them. Having an adult around chills Arliss right out, allowing Beck to use a little reverse psychology to convince him he doesn’t actually want to kill his brother. Are you sure about that, kid? He skulks off to finish milking the cow, and Travis emerges to marvel at his uncle’s impressive knack for child psychology. Uncle Beck teaches him a valuable lesson: ordering Arliss around encourages rebellion, but outthinking him gets results. As Travis mulls it over, the bacon burns and fills the whole cabin with black smoke. Now he has to start all over again. As the second batch cooks, Uncle Beck hands Travis a letter announcing that his grandmother is recovering just fine.\n\nArliss storms in demanding food because Mama would never just let breakfast burn, starting another argument about slacking off while Travis does all the work. Travis uses what his uncle taught him to pretend to support Arliss’s plan, and Arliss drops it. With his work done, Beck takes his leave. Just as Travis feared, he ends up doing all the work while Arliss sits on Jumper’s back watching Sam track a bobcat. Suddenly, a bundle of branches catches on a log and spooks the mule and Arliss’s scream here actually physically hurt my ears I’m not kidding. Don’t watch this movie with headphones. Travis promises Arliss they can hunt the bobcat after they finish their work, so Arliss takes off anyway. Instead of chasing him, Travis just goes home.\n\nBud Searcy and his daughter Lisbeth rides up to the Coates house in a frenzy, screaming that a tribe of Apache warriors raided Salt Licks. If the men of the settlement don’t band together to stop them, there will be nothing left! Of course, he very quickly switches gears to ordering Lisbeth around. This change of mood convinces Travis that there’s not really anything to worry about, but he should still maybe check on Arliss. You wouldn’t want him to get kidnapped by Apache warriors. Hint. Hint. Hint. Lisbeth assures Travis that her father doesn’t know what he’s talking about and no one’s seen a Native American here for ten years. Oh, and she’d just loooove to go with him to spend some time with him. Meanwhile, Bud Searcy goes inside and eats all their food. This guy.\n\nAs they ride through the woods, Lisbeth chats with Travis all about a couple they know who just got married. Hint. Hint. Hint. Sam’s barking and Jumper’s distressed braying save Travis from having to respond to that. They find Arliss in a cave, poking a bobcat with a stick. Yeah. You read that right. Travis exchanges exasperated glances with Lisbeth and dives in to save Arliss from himself which makes him a much nicer person than I am. Unfortuantely, Arliss doesn’t see it that way and starts flinging rocks at Travis again for the crime of not letting him poke a bobcat with a stick. Lisbeth tries to back Travis off but even she catches some flailing child limbs. The two teens finally work together to restrain Arliss, but it soon becomes apparent that they have bigger problems. Horse hooves and racially insensitive whooping draw closer and closer. It’s the Apache raiding party! Bud Searcy told the truth after all!\n\nCome on, Disney. You haven’t portrayed Native Americans this badly since Peter Pan. Even Davy Crockett was more sensitive and open-minded towards First Nations peoples! It continues to get worse and worse and guys I’m so tired. I’m so, so tired. As usual, only one of them is Native American (Pat Hogan, actually, who previously played Red Stick in Davy Crockett) and the rest are white or Hispanic dudes in Party City costumes. I should be used to this by now but it keeps making me cry a little on the inside, mostly because they’re all jabbering in gibberish and leering unpleasantly at the three white kids. Travis gets clubbed in the head by a rifle but and gets captured immediately, followed quickly by Lisbeth because why wouldn’t she be completely helpless?\n\nOnly Arliss puts up anything resembling a fight. Flinging rocks and breaking eardrums counts as fighting, right? The Apache overcome his assault and overpower him, tossing him in with his brother and friend. Sam spots his humans in trouble and bolts in, teeth bared and snarling in audio clips taken straight from his father. Like Travis, he gets smashed in the head with a rifle butt, which everyone thinks kills him but it’s too early for that and we all know it. Gunshots ring out over the commotion as Uncle Beck tries to save his nephews from the cliffs above, but he fails and doesn’t even give chase. Good job accomplishing nothing. Pretty soon, the Apache run off with their captors in tow, including poor old Jumper! Sam comes to and takes off following the trail, determined to rescue his beloved humans.\n\nDuring the getaway, one of the Native Americans, a Comanche inexplicably riding with the Apache, digs a piece of buckshot from Uncle Beck’s gun from his leg. The camera lingers on it for a minute, then the whole party comes to a river. Arliss uses the crossing as an opportunity to try to drown the young warrior guarding him, which the other Native Americans find hilarious for some reason. By the way, this young warrior is Rafael Campos, aka Half Arrow in The Light in the Forest and Strong Bear in Tonka. I barely recognized him, mostly because he doesn’t have a speaking role here so I couldn’t hear his distinctive Dominican accent. Anyway, Arliss chomps on the warrior’s ear to get him to let him go and runs back to the rest of the Apache instead of away for some reason. Fun fact: in the book, he actually bites his ear off, then swallows it! Gross.\n\nInspired by the jollity of watching one of their youth almost die, the Apache start a game of keepaway with a dummy that stands in for Arliss’s body. Like, it doesn’t even have a face. It’s really awkward. Finally, they fling him over a tree branch and he watches with delight as they beat the young warrior for getting bested by a white kid. To protect his honor, he grabs a hatchet, but the Comanche pulls Arliss out of harms way and sets him safely next to Travis. Um… what? Travis warns Arliss to stop fighting before they decide to just murder them all but of course Arliss is just physically incapable of listening. Okay, this time, it’s not entirely his fault. The young warrior sneaks up and steals Arliss’s hat and of course we get treated to earsplitting howls of “that’s my hat! you can’t have it! give it back!” etc etc.\n\nWhen the Apaches make camp, Arliss and Lisbeth fill Travis in on Sam’s apparent death. Unless you count Arliss’s uncontrollable anger that’s comprised about 80% of the movie, no one shows any real emotion about losing their beloved dog. This wouldn’t normally be worthy of consideration especially because the dog is alive, but this is a sequel to one of the most gut-wrenching dog deaths in media history. Give us something? Please? But no, the conversation quickly turns to their presumptive fate if they can’t escape. Travis will be enslaved, Arliss will be raised as an Apache just like True Son in The Light in the Forest except here it’s a bad thing, and they can’t even talk about what will happen to Lisbeth because this is a family movie.\n\nArliss wastes no time in coming up with a plan to distract the Apache by making them fight over Lisbeth because this kid is completely insufferable. Fortunately, neither of the older kids pay him much attention. They’re too busy making goo-goo eyes at each other. Pretty soon, the Comanche brings them a small ration of meat that’s similar to horse meat but not quite. Arliss suddenly notices Jumper is missing. That’s a rather tender subject. Everyone loses their appetite pretty quickly but who knows when their captors will feed them again? While he reluctantly eats, Arliss reminisces on all the great times they had with his poor dead mule, including the time he saved Old Yeller from the hogs. This singular, offhand moment is the one and only mention of Old Yeller in the entire movie. It’s actually kind of insulting that they forget their beloved, brave, smart doggo who sacrificed his life for them that quickly.\n\nJumper’s demise fills Arliss with sudden uncontrollable rage, so he leaps up and clubs the young warrior over the head. The rest of the camp stare at him. A beat passes. Arliss tries to run, but they snatch him back. They strip him down and for a second I thought this movie was going to take an even more unpleasant turn. I mean, it does, but not for the reason I thought. They just paint his face and chest up and, sure enough, they want to make him one of them because, quoth Travis, “they admire his spirit.” Big Yikes. After they have their fun, the Apache lay down to sleep without leaving any kind of guard. That leaves a perfect opportunity for Lisbeth to fish Travis’s knife out of his pocket and….\n\nHold up. Why are their hands tied loosely enough that she can even do that? Why did they not check for weapons to prevent this exact situation? I mean, it works out, but these are the worst kidnappers ever. This whole plot is cringe enough without making them terrible villains on top of it. Ugh. They make their way through the camp with no incident, until Arliss just has to turn back for his pants. I mean, I get it, but come on, kid. Luckily, none of them wake up to that, but Sam charges in just as they’re about to get away. His wild barking does alert the Apache. Not only do they recapture them, but they strip Travis just like they did Arliss and almost knife Lisbeth. Sam howls again, catching the Apaches’ attention and sparing Travis and Lisbeth’s lives. They think the dogs are after them, so they pack up the camp and get gone.\n\nThe next morning, the camp comes across a small group of white US Cavalry soldiers just running through the middle of nowhere. The Apache shove Travis to the ground and out of sight before he can call out to them, and the two sides skirmish. The battle ends as quickly as it begins when the white soldiers decide they’ve scared the Apache badly enough for one day. They’re just stealing horses, anyway. It’s not worth the trouble. Yeah, they’re useless. At least Travis got free, though Lisbeth and Arliss are still in trouble. He calls for the cavalry, but they’re too far away to hear, and he soon collapses from exhaustion.\n\nWhen Travis comes to, he’s all alone except for a dead Apache man. He’s stranded in the wilderness, but at least the dead man has a gun and a horse he can use. Wait, no, the horse spooks and runs, leaving Travis unconscious in a creek. Sam finds him and knocks him back into the water with the force of his puppy kisses and waggly tail. He starts to race after Arliss and Lisbeth but Travis can’t keep up when he’s not injured, starving, exhausted, and overheated. Travis holds him back with a leash made of grass, but it only helps for so long before Travis passes out again. For those keeping score at home, that’s three faints in the space of a paragraph. It makes sense why but it’s not exactly thrilling cinema, you know?\n\nWhen Travis comes to again, he’s surrounded by horses and a man yanks his head up by the hair. Understandably, he freaks out thinking it’s an Apache, but no, it’s Uncle Beck! He’s saved! The horses belong to the rest of the search party, neighbors in the Salt Licks settlement: Bud Searcy, Wiley Crup, Pack Underwood, Lester White, and Ben Todd. The latter two do precisely nothing, Pack Underwood is violently racist because his family was scalped and hoo boy, and Wiley Crup exists to be annoyed by Bud Searcy. Other than that, most of these guys run together. They help dress Travis’s injuries and offer him water and clean clothes while Bud and Beck fret over the missing kids. The second Travis can stand, he starts to stumble after Sam because, of course, the dog knows where they are. Uncle Beck agrees to follow the dog because really, what other options do they have?\n\nA problem quickly arises. There are seven men and six horses because apparently no one in this movie bothers to plan ahead. They decide that one of them will run next to the horses like the Comanche man does, taking turns as each of them wear out. It works pretty well and they make their way through the desert this way. The travellers pepper the endless walking scenes with little vignettes of Bud Searcy’s determination to save his little girl even if it means walking while the others pick on him and Pack Underwood snarling that he’s going to murder every single Apache. Finally, they spot a flock of vultures circling over a watering hole and go to investigate.\n\nSure enough, they find Sam locked in battle with a whole pack of wolves, set to growls taken directly from the original movie. The search party scares the wolves away with their ropes. They examine Sam for injuries and find that his paw is pretty badly scratched up. It’s nothing that won’t heal eventually, but he can’t continue. The riders, especially Pack “The Worst” Underwood, want to leave him there in the middle of the desert but they need his nose if they want to have a chance, so Beck hoists Sam into the saddle and off they go. Every so often, they let Sam down to limp along the trail and make sure they’re going the right way.\n\nAlong the way, Pack Underwood starts spewing bile and every racial slur you can think of against the Native American community. It get so intense that one of the other guys on the trail, who I’m going to decide is Lester White, rides up to get him to maybe chill. The Apache have even more right to the trails and the buffalo on them and maybe they only attack and kill the settlers in self defense? Well, Pack “The Worst” Underwood refuses to listen. He just wants to exterminate all of them. Maybe-Lester White shakes his head and says “sometimes it’s hard to tell who the savages are.” I mean, he’s right, of course, but the line feels really out of place in a movie with the worst depictions of First Nations peoples since Peter freaking Pan.\n\nWell, Maybe-Lester White tried but sometimes there’s just no getting through to people. Beck explains why Pack Underwood so gun-ho about slaughtering innocent people for their race. Some time ago, he came home to find his home burned down and his wife and kids scalped inside. And I feel like a horrible person, but I’m like… okay…? I get that he’s grieving and it’s horrible, but that’s no excuse to take it out on every Native American he sees. But they gloss over it pretty quickly, instead letting Sam get the trail again. The dog sniffs out the remains of an Apache campfire, which can only mean one thing. They’re close!\n\nOf course, we can’t just find them and put us all out of our misery. No, we need another obstacle to liven this slogfest up, so a torrential downpour dumps out of the sky and washes away the trail. The deluge forces the search party to take shelter in a cave, waiting and hoping that Lisbeth and Arliss are okay. Beck reassures Bud and Travis that they know the Apache are in the mountains, and they’ll head that way as long as the horses can last. There always has to be a naysayer so Wiley Crup decides he wants out. He doesn’t even make it as far as the cave mouth before Bud Searcy jabs his gun at his chest. No one’s going anywhere until his little girl is safe.\n\nThe weather clears up so off they go. After a while, Sam starts wriggling and crying like crazy so they let him go and he takes off running like he was never injured at all. The riders follow and tie him down, then creep out over the hill for some recon. Sure enough, there are the Apache, leading Arliss around on a leash and forcing Lisbeth to serve them. But they can’t just charge in. They need strategy. Beck asks everyone to keep as quiet as possible so he can make the horses stampede to distract the Apache. If they play their cards right, they can rescue Lisbeth and Arliss without feeding Pack Underwood’s bloodlust.\n\nEveryone gets into position, but of course the plan falls apart almost immediately. Sam pulls free of his muzzle and barks hysterically, triggering Pack Underwood’s fury into shooting an Apache. You know, exactly what Beck told him not to do. The Apache scramble onto their horses and the battle is on. Good job, Pack. Now, in the ten years or so Disney has been doing these Western films, you would expect them to improve on their fight choreography. You would be wrong. Bloodless carnage is to be expected in live action family movies even today but falling over melodramatically when hit by absolutely nothing is not. Travis rides to Lisbeth’s rescue among the chaos, but he falls when her would-be suitor shoots him in the spirit.\n\nArliss sees someone that isn’t him hurting his brother and flips out, seizing a rifle and bashing an Apache’s head in with the butt. He makes a break for his uncle only to be scooped up by the same young warrior. Before he can carry him away, Sam bolts out of the brush to maul the young warrior, while his dad’s snarls play in the background. Meanwhile, Lisbeth spots her dad and calls for help as her suitor hauls her away over the hill. Wiley Crup aims his gun at the Apache but Bud Searcy stops him. He wants to do it. There’s no way the old man can make such an impossible thousand yard shot without risking his daughter, but he takes the chance. And he does it! The suitor falls, and Bud Searcy faints from the shock of actually pulling that off. Lisbeth collapses into Travis’s arms, free at last.\n\nBy this point, the young warrior is the only Apache left, but it doesn’t look good for him. Between Sam’s teeth and Arliss’s rocks (again with the rock throwing!) , he really doesn’t stand a chance. Sure enough, Sam gets the guy on the run, chasing him out into the sunset. Arliss even gets his hat back! All’s well that ends well, so the riding party turns for home. Lisbeth spots her father unconscious beside Crup, but it’s okay, he’s alive. To prove it, Crup dumps a hat full of water on his face. He wakes up spluttering and blathering and not two seconds later, he demands Lisbeth get a fire going to make him some food. Dude! Your daughter just got saved from being abducted! Pack Underwood sees someone else try to take his title of The Worst and snarls that he wants to murder more Apache but Beck puts the kibosh on that. It’s time to go home.\n\nThe riding party, the three kids, and a whole herd of stolen horses make their way back to the Coates family cabin. Travis and Lisbeth spend the whole ride making eyes at each other under the romantic sunset. Bud Searcy spends the whole ride bragging to anyone and everyone about his amazing shot, and Arliss spends the whole ride bragging to Bud Searcy about defeating the young warrior. Arliss wins the war of being annoying, by the way. Beck invites the Searcys in for dinner, which Travis offers to get started. Did we think this movie was done being wildly offensive just because the Apache were defeated? Oh, no. Lisbeth stops Travis, because, and I quote, “Cooking is woman’s work.” I… WHAT?! This is 1963. Not 1957. Woman’s Lib was starting to become a thing. And that’s… that’s… ASJDKASJDJSALK.\n\nWhile I rage incoherently, Arliss hears a loud braying coming from the corn patch! It’s Jumper! He’s okay! He really did die in the book but I guess Old Yeller was traumatic enough that its sequel needs to undo any modicum of emotion. At first, he’s thrilled to see him but that excitement quickly turns into Kevin Corcoran Rage as he flings more rocks at this poor mule for eating their corn. He chases the mule into the sunset as Lisbeth and Travis laugh at how some things never change. Bud and Beck notice they’re about to be in-laws and the adorable way the third kid tries to stone everything he sees to death. The movie ends as it began, with Savage Sam terrorizing a bobcat while Arliss eggs him on and throws rocks. No one has learned anything and I am never getting those two hours back.\n\nHoo boy. Where do I even start with this? Not since Westward Ho! The Wagons have I endured such a noxious cocktail of racism, sexism, and dullness. I mean, even Westward Ho! at least gave its Native Americans a speaking part and portrayed them as civilized. Here, they speak pure gibberish when they speak at all and are reduced to buffoonish, savage caricatures in a way even Davy Crockett (the first Disney Western!) didn’t dare to do. Tonka and The Light in the Forest made strides in portraying Native Americans as sympathetic people with a rich culture, and now, five years later, we’re back here. I really don’t love this backslide.\n\nThat’s not the only problem this movie suffers from. To call Savage Sam a sequel to Old Yeller is insulting, both to the original movie and to the viewer. The only similarities are the character names and one off-hand mention. The emotion and nostalgia that made the first one such a cultural icon don’t exist here. Both boys are reduced to the worst parodies of their original characterizations, bumbling and screeching through a vast, bleak wilderness. The movie is bogged down by long stretches of absolutely nothing happening, which prevent it from really achieving its status as an action adventure film. Worst of all, for a supposed dog movie and a follow up to the dog movie to end all dog movies, Savage Sam himself barely appears in his own movie! It’s all painful to watch and I’m so happy I’m almost done reliving it.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nTravis Coates grew into his role as the protector between movies. Now, there’s nothing inherently wrong about that, especially since the job includes the thankless task of keeping Arliss alive. Any household has chores that need to be done and I really don’t know why they portrayed that as some kind of authoritarian nightmare. However, being the responsible one and the leader archetype kind of becomes his only personality trait. Walt wanted Tommy Kirk to get top billing for this movie because he considered it some of his best work. I kind of disagree mostly because Old Yeller exists and Tommy Kirk’s facial expressions during That Scene make the whole movie. However, Brian Keith ended up with top billing so it’s a moot point anyway.\n\nArliss Coates. Oh boy, where did they go wrong with this kid? He’s taken Travis’s homicidal tendencies from the first one, combined them with his own childlike tantrums, and turned them up to eleven. The end result is unbearable to watch. It’s not Kevin Corcoran’s fault. Disney just completely failed to notice that he’s getting much too old to play the role he’s been typecast in. They wrote in plenty of the screaming rages we saw in Old Yeller and Swiss Family Robinson, ignoring the fact that that a teenager acting like this has completely different implications from a small child. Oh, yeah, and his changing voice makes the screeching both earsplitting and completely incomprehensible. Not an enjoyable experience.\n\nLisbeth Searcy became such a damsel I can’t even handle it. Not only does she do absolutely nothing besides get manhandled, scream, and get rescued, she gets that awful, awful line at the end of the movie. Did I say Roberta was bad in Swiss Family Robinson? I would like to formally apologize for that because it got worse. So much worse. How did we go from Mary Grant and the Parent Trap twins to this? Even some of the heroines from the ‘40s and ‘50s had more agency than this! She was also the only character from the original to be recast. I imagine Beverly Washburn read the script and went “what on earth is this?!” so they cast Marta Kristen in her first film role instead. She’d go on to do pretty well for herself as Judy Robinson in Lost in Space, but this is hardly an auspicious start.\n\nUncle Beck Coates pretty much only exists because Fess Parker fell out with Disney. He doesn’t exist in the book, where Mama and Papa Coates were very much present, but we needed some kind of adult figure. Actually, he gives pretty good advice and uses reverse psychology cleverly at the beginning of the movie, but he falls off later in the movie as the rugged leader type in much the same way Travis does. Brian Keith returns to his element as a cowboy type, though, thankfully, his character isn’t as rage-inducing as Bill Dunn.\n\nBud Searcy hasn’t changed much between movies. He’s still an annoying old busybody who eats everybody’s food and orders people to feed his laziness. However, this time around, we get some hidden depths. He really loves his daughter, despite the way he treats her, and he’s a pretty deadly shot. Mostly, it was just really nice to see Jeff York again for the first time since the original Old Yeller. This was his final film for Disney and his second-to-last movie overall. We’ll miss you dearly, Mr. York. Thanks for being King of the River!\n\nMUSIC\n\nOliver Wallace’s score strongly resembles his previous work for Old Yeller, which makes it the only real connective tissue between the two movies. Only the music makes this feel like a continuation of the previous film. Unfortunately, that also makes this movie feel like a relic of a day gone by, making it feel outdated by 1963’s standards. The world changed a lot in the five years between the two movies, as did musical tastes (and other opinions but I’ve said a great deal about that already).\n\nSavage Sam and Me, strangely enough, actually does sound like something from the 1960’s, which clashes a lot with pretty much every other element of the entire movie. The vocal harmonies and folksy melody reminded me a lot of the Moody Blues or Donovan (not exactly), mostly because they’re the only progressive rock bands I can think of off the top of my head. It clashes pretty badly with the rest of the movie. We previously heard Terry Gilkyson’s work in Swiss Family Robinson with “My Heart Was an Island”, and I have to say this is far from his best work. It’s very relaxing, which is about the last thing you want the opening credits to a rousing adventure film to be.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThis movie was written, scored, directed, and cast like a film from the mid-’50s. Back then, Davy Crockett was all the rage and it made sense for Disney to try to make lightning strike twice… or eight times. I have to wonder, though, did they not notice the reviews steadily declining? Did they not realize people were so sick of these formulaic, samey Westerns that Ten Who Dared was called Walt’s worst effort ever? Savage Sam combines the worst of the whole Western era and makes it all ten times worse, especially the racial and gender politics. I didn’t think it was possible for this project to show me a movie I hated more than Western Ho! but hoo boy are we at that point.\n\nFavorite scene: Uncle Beck using reverse psychology to get Arliss to stop being a little lunatic. It was some A+ parenting, and it worked!"
