        "text": "How does Lenina respond to the things she sees on the Reservation? What aspects of the life of the savages are particularly distressing to her? How does Bernard respond to her criticisms?\n\nLenina does not like what she witnesses on the reservation, and it makes her very uncomfortable and she finds it very \"peculiar\". The things that she finds the most distressing are: the savages being whipped, mother-child relationships, their aging and imperfections, and the fact that they don't know who Ford is. Bernard responds by saying that they (him and Lenina) would be just like the savages if the community didn't condition them.\n\nSummarize the religious ceremony that Lenina and Bernard witness. What do you think the purpose of the ceremony is? Which religions does it seem to be based on?\n\nThe religious ceremony consisted of pounding drums, black hissing snakes, and a young man in the middle being whipped. The purpose was to bring rain so the corn and other food would grow. I believe it is based off of Christianity.\n\nWhen Linda sees Bernard and Lenina she is happy to see people from the community. Her life on the reservation she complains about the dirtiness and isn't respected due to her knowledge of the community. She has also attempted to make John civilized but failed.\n\nAll of John's memories included the fact his mother Linda has messed up several times. The fact that Linda sleeps with almost every man which also sort of prevents them from being accepted.\n\nThe first play that John reads is Hamlet. Explain how this play gives John a way to frame his experience and gives context to his mother's relationship with Popé.\n\nHamlet is a guy who marries someone else after his father dies, he's mad about it b/c he thinks what his mother is doing is wrong (since she won't commit to just one guy).\n\nBoth John and Bernard feel isolated and different in the society they live it. Bernard if scared of rejection and feeling like an outcast and denies it; whereas, John is very strong about his unique beliefs and embraces them.\n\nBernard offers to take John and Linda to London. John is very happy and excited to go, but wants Linda to come as well (Bernard originally only invited John).\n\nBernard appeals to Mustapha Mond to grant him permission to bring John and Linda back into society. He is granted permission because Mustapha believes John and Linda are a matter of scientific interest to the state.\n\nExplain how the works of William Shakespeare influence the way that John frames his experience of seeing the sleeping Lenina? What is ironic about the way he perceives her?\n\nSimilar to how Romeo was watching Juliet on the balcony and was admiring her, John was watching Lenina sleep and admiring her. He sees Lenina as \"trustful\" and \"helpless\" and \"pure\", which is ironic because due to her many experiences in casual sex, Lenina is far from pure.\n\nWhat is John tempted to do when he finds Lenina sound asleep? Why does he stop? Do you think John is noble or just naïve? Explain your answer.\n\nHe is tempted to touch Lenina while she's sleeping, but fears it would defile her. I think John was being naïve because he attempted to unzip Lenina's pajamas and that is very poor judgement.\n\nWhy do you think Huxley chooses to juxtaposition the description of the process of human fertilization in labs at the Bloomsbury Centre at the beginning of Chapter 10 with the scene between John and the sleeping Lenina at the end of Chapter 9?\n\nJohn's feelings for Lenina and the images from Shakespeare he associates with her are filled with emotion. The juxtaposition of the clinical lab is in direct contrast with his feelings and thoughts. John is experiencing things nobody is allowed to experience in the BNW society.\n\nAccording to the director, what is the worst offense a person can commit? Explain the reason that he believes this. Do you agree with him?\n\nWhy has the Director called Bernard Marx in for a public meeting? Why does he want to accuse Bernard in front of upper-caste workers? What charges does he make against Bernard? How does Bernard answer the Director's accusations?"
