        "text": "This film is the story of a sheriff and a crew of gentlemen on their way to hunt down a gang of “troglodytes” in the later days of the wild west. They are grotesque, inbred, cannibalistic cave dwellers who have been terrorizing this town’s people, but the movie does little to differentiate them from other Native Americans. They have one Native at the beginning of the film used essentially as a prop to explain that they’re not the same, but the rest of the movie has the main characters refer to them as savages. There’s actually one character who claims to have killed over a hundred Natives, and the movie portrays his death in an honorable, heroic way. The characters all seem to actually develop a hatred for Natives as the movie progresses, even ones who started as neutral.\n\nThe movie is gruesome, shot gorgeously, and is most of the things that you might want out of a historical horror movie, but it’s impossible to divorce it from the blatant racism."
