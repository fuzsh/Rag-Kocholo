        "text": "The poem \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" explores many themes, the chief of which is the inevitability of death. Death comes to all human beings, rich or poor, high or low. The poet describes a typical evening scene in the countryside. All the creatures of the woods are making their way to their shelters as the lone farmer walks home with his herd. The poet describes the call of a solitary owl, and the ancient elms and yew trees under which the long-dead country folk are buried. This setting gives the poem a somber tone. By setting his poem at the hour of sunset, Thomas Gray invokes a melancholy mood, which is fitting for a poem that deals with the theme of death. By invoking the image of living beings returning to their rest at sunset and connecting it to the image of the village dead \"resting\" in the churchyard, Gray shows that death is part of the cycle of nature. In the last stanza he uses the image of the flower that blooms and withers away unseen to show that the farmers' lives are just as worthy as those of the rich and famous, though they live and die unknown and unpraised.\n\nBoth of William Blake's poems \"The Lamb\" and \"The Tyger\" deal with the concept God as a creator. In \"The Lamb,\" Blake describes a kindly creator who loves all his creatures, especially children. The poet says God himself is a child. \"The Lamb\" also refers explicitly to the Christian god. Through the use of words such as lamb, which is a reference to Jesus Christ, and phrases such as \"Good Shepherd and the Lamb of God,\" \"meek and mild,\" and \"feed,'' Blake describes a gentle and loving Christian god who cares for all his creatures.\n\nIn comparison, the God that Blake describes in \"The Tyger\" is less obviously Christian. Blake describes a fearsome and powerful God who is also an artist. He portrays God as a tiger and uses words such as hammer, furnace, and chains, which conjure up images of the power of a blacksmith. So the God of \"The Tyger\" is powerful and awe-inspiring, unlike the tender God of \"The Lamb.\"\n\nLittle Lamb who made thee? (from \"The Lamb\")\n\nDost thou know who made thee? (from \"The Lamb\")\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye,/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry? (from \"The Tyger\")\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies,/ Burnt the fire of thine eyes? (from \"The Tyger\")\n\nOn what wings dare he aspire?/ What the hand, dare seize the fire? (from \"The Tyger\")\n\nThe tone of the questions in \"The Lamb\" is more innocent and shows a sense of wonder. Blake maintains this innocent tone by using words like little and Lamb and by repeatedly asking the lamb if it knows the identity of its maker. These questions and words suggest the smallness and helplessness of both the subject and the speaker.\n\nIn \"The Tyger,\" Blake creates a more forceful tone through use of words such as fearful, fire, dare, and seize. In \"The Tyger\" the poet uses rhetorical questions to create a sense of wonder but also a sense of fear and awe.\n\nIn his poem \"Tintern Abbey,\" Wordsworth describes the natural beauty of the abbey and the ability of its surroundings to give him peace. Like most romantic poems, it emphasizes the power of nature to heal. The poet also refers to his sister in the poem, introducing a personal detail from his own life. This practice of referring to incidents or people in the poet's life became a mainstay in romantic poetry. Mourning the loss of nature due to industrialization, and the taking over of woods and streams by cities, was also a common theme in many romantic poems. In \"Tintern Abbey,\" the poet mourns the loss of the mountains and gloomy woods he loved as a boy, but suggests that the moments he spent with nature have the power to console him even in the din of the crowded city.\n\nIn the beginning, the crew condemned the mariner for shooting the bird. However, when the weather warmed up and the mist cleared, they changed their minds and agreed with him that killing the bird was wise. When they were tormented with heat and thirst, they again changed their minds and cursed the mariner, forcing him to wear the albatross around his neck as punishment. The ship was then chased by supernatural beings, after which Death took the crew members and Life-in-Death took the mariner. The crew members were inconstant in their morality, and they were punished for it.\n\nIn contrast to Wordsworth's lofty language and complex rhythm, in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Coleridge uses alliteration to create lyrical rhythm and mood. For example, the speaker repeats sounds to describe the perils faced by the ship in Antarctic waters: \"The ice was here, the ice was there, / The ice was all around: / It cracked and growled, and roared and howled.\"\n\nColeridge also uses internal rhyme, or rhyming words within the same line, such as \"The ice did split with a thunder-fit;\" and repetition (\"And round and round it flew\"). This literary device lends the poem a singsong quality, which gives it the flavor of an old \"sailor's song\" and contributes to the seafaring theme of the poem. Much like a lively sailor's song, the poem can be read aloud and enjoyed.\n\nThe frame story and narrative interruption techniques add to the suspense of the poem. The reader discovers the mariner's real identity along with the guest. Every time the guest interrupts the mariner, a new facet of the seaman's identity is revealed. That keeps the story interesting.\n\nIn these lines, Coleridge creates a frightening and supernatural scene. He describes a wild and desolate place, which he calls \"A savage place! As holy and enchanted\" that nonetheless excites him. Unlike Kubla Khan's human-made palace, this place is a miracle of nature, which is free of human restraints. This lack of human control is reflected in images such as the woman crying out for her demon lover, and the mighty, gushing fountain. Coleridge makes use of phrases such as \"was forced,\" \"ceaseless turmoil seething,\" and \"fast thick pants\" to build up the frantic and restless tone of the poem. In addition he describes a waning moon that indicates a place that is gradually entering darkness. Using such imagery Coleridge is able to build a dark and wild picture of nature that is beyond human control.\n\nThomas Gray's poem ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,'' is written in the romantic style. He describes the beauty of the English countryside and its people. He portrays English subjects such as farmers, housewives, and cowherds, and the natural world. He writes of death and its effect on all beings.\n\nBecause he explores the certainty and finality of death, mentioning religion, with its ideal of the afterlife, would take away from the point of the poem. Instead, Gray wants to emphasize that death comes to all in the natural world, and only the names and deeds of people live on. For this reason, he uses the image of the dead lying in their graves (\"each in his narrow cell for ever laid,\" \"Can storied urn or animated bust / Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\") to show that death is not only unavoidable but also final. In the poem, the speaker states that the lives and \"toil\" of humble villagers who are dead and forgotten is equal to that of famous people such as John Milton and Thomas Cromwell. The poet mourns the lost potential of the village folk, who died with their talents hidden and unpraised due to a lack of education and poverty.\n\nGod is mentioned in the epitaph at the end of the poem. But Gray does not mention God in his poem because his themes of lost potential, and the inevitable but natural cycle of life and death, go against the religious ideal of eternal life after death.\n\nThe poet says that his heart is filled with joy whenever he looks at a rainbow. He says he has felt this way about nature ever since he was a child, and claims he still feels the same.\n\nHe believes that he will still love the rainbow when he grows old. He says he would rather die than lose his childlike adoration of nature. He states that childhood has a strong effect on a person's adult personality. At the end of the poem, he expresses his wish that this \"natural piety,\" or reverence for nature, will be present in all the stages of his life (\"And I could wish my days to be / Bound each to each by natural piety.\").\n\nWriting the poem in simple language makes the themes of the poem clearer and easier to understand. For example, the connection between the idea of \"natural piety\" at the end of the poem and the childhood mentioned in the first and second paragraphs, is made clearer when we paraphrase the poem."
