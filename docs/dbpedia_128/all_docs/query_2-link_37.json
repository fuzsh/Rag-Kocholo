        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn much of the extensive literature on the subject, exoticism is considered a form of representation in which peoples, places, and cultural practices are depicted as foreign from the perspective of the composer and/or intended audience. In earlier usage of the term, “exoticism” and “exotic” referred to an inherent quality or status of the non-Western other. More recently, exoticism has been understood to require an imaginative act of representing, perceiving, and classifying on the part of the beholder. In this sense, “exoticism” is most properly considered in its predicate form: to exoticize, both through acts of representation and perception. Postcolonial studies emphasize the political functions of exotic representation in the power dynamics between imperialist powers and the subaltern rather than detailing stylistic influence. Although cross-cultural influence and exoticism are not easily disentangled, the emphasis here will be on representation rather than on issues of contact and appropriation. Scholars differ on the relationship between the term exoticism and such other terms as Orientalism, primitivism, medievalism, and archaicism. For the purposes of this bibliographical article, and reflecting current scholarly usage, we will consider exoticism as a term encompassing the others and as roughly equivalent to Orientalism. Although clearly related, nationalism and folklorism are typically treated separately and will not be included here. The pervasive impact of racial perceptions and realities on the production and consumption of music clearly shapes musical exoticism. Examples of exoticism may be found throughout history and across the globe and in genres ranging from opera seria to ringtones. Though most scholarship on musical exoticism has been focused on Western art music, this article will include citations of work on exoticism in popular music and on alternative forms and sites of exotic representation.\n\nGeneral Overviews\n\nGeneral studies of exoticism tend to offer either a critical overview of the scholarly field and exploration of the term itself or a broad chronological survey of examples from Western music history. Locke 2009 offers both approaches in one volume, as does Taylor 2007, though in a less focused format. Born and Hesmondhalgh 2000 presents the most critically focused exploration of the term, engaging with postcolonial perspectives and the role of exoticism in political power relations, and Head 2003 is a pointed critique of the scholarly field, with Bellman 2011 serving as a rebuttal and critique of postcolonial approaches. Bellman 1998 is a collection that offers focused case studies of major examples of Western exoticism, and Scott 1998 briefly catalogs similar examples, as does Parker 1917, an essay of primarily historical interest. Although not a work of musical scholarship, Said 1978 must be noted here as a foundational text. Said’s argument that the European study and representation of exotic others supported imperialist political projects has been hugely influential in musical scholarship on exoticism.\n\nBellman, Jonathan, ed.

The common chronological divisions adopted here are somewhat arbitrary but do represent stylistic and conceptual shifts supported by the bulk of examples from each period. This periodization reflects the existing scholarship on exoticism in Western art music, but it has not gone uncontested in the literature, and several styles and topics cross these temporal boundaries. The rise of the alla turca style and proliferation of representations of the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the 18th century has long been viewed as a significant turning point in the history of musical exoticism. Likewise, the large number of Orientalist operas produced in the second half of the 19th century have received significant scholarly attention. The pre-1750 period has received a renewed focus in the study of musical exoticism. Scholars continue to debate whether works in the modernist and postmodernist periods represent a continuation of musical exoticism in Western art music or a break with the past and turn to a cross-cultural or transcultural hybridization of music beyond a representational impetus.\n\nPre-1750\n\nTo date, studies of exoticism in this period have tended to focus on but a few topics. European colonial engagements with North America resulted in representations of Native Americans in music and dance. Both Bloechl 2008 and Savage 1983 investigate this subject, but from widely divergent approaches. The prominence of exoticism in dance music of this period—notably in the moresca—is explored in Alm 1996 and Cummings 2011. Harris 2006 and Locke 2015, have recently opened up discussion of exoticism in baroque opera, particularly in works by Handel. The contextual approach found in Salmen 1997 to the relationship between music and chinoiserie in the decorative arts offers one model for exploring exoticism in this period. Whaples 1998 and Locke 2015 offer the broadest surveys of exoticism in this extended early period.\n\nAlm, Irene. “Dances from the ‘Four Corners of the Earth’: Exoticism in Seventeenth-Century Venetian Opera.” In Musica Franca: Essays in Honor of Frank A.

On this subject, Rice 1999 offers a solid historical survey, Hunter 1998 and Head 2000 develop insightful interpretive critiques, and Betzwieser 1993 considers lesser-known French manifestations. Betzwieser 1994 on alla turca in Rossini raises important issues of intra-Orientalist influence and the possibility of parody. Other studies of the period point to examples that either relate to succeeding developments in musical exoticism or to works that diverged from the typical forms of such representation. Lacombe 1999 studies French opera libretti that engaged with exoticism before the heyday of French Orientalist opera in the later 19th century. Gramit 2003 considers exoticism in Schubert’s lieder—a composer and genre not normally considered in such terms. Focusing on Haydn’s operas, Clark 2009 demonstrates that the portrayal of Jewish characters through music has long been a fashionable form of exoticism.\n\nBetzwieser, Thomas.

Examples of Orientalist opera have received the most sustained attention, and the most celebrated publications concerning musical exoticism have been devoted to these examples. Given opera’s particularly public and spectacular nature, it is not surprising that this genre would be most closely associated with contemporary European imperialistic exploits throughout the world. However, significant examples of musical exoticism from this period can be found in nonoperatic genres as well. For instance, scholars have focused repeatedly on the “gypsy” and “Spanish” styles in symphonic, vocal, and keyboard works.\n\nOpera\n\nSeveral of these publications have been highly influential, with Locke 1991 and McClary 1992 proving particularly seminal and offering models for a multifaceted investigation of prominent Orientalist operas. Taruskin 1992 and Parakilas 1993 exemplify a more longitudinal approach, with the former considering exoticism in one nation (Russia) over an extended period and the latter identifying a paradigmatic plot and musical devices common to numerous operatic works. Said 1993 and Locke 2005 both offer nuanced studies of Orientalism in Verdi’s Aida. Said 1993 represents a rare application by the author of his own theories of Orientalism as applied to the interpretation of music, and Locke 2005 exemplifies Locke’s repeated call for a more inclusive approach to the analysis and interpretation of Orientalist operas. Everist 1996 may be viewed as an early and qualified reaction to Locke 1991, McClary 1992, and Parakilas 1993 as it attempts to distinguish the terms “exoticism” and “Orientalism.” Morrison 2001 offers a case study of Rimsky-Korsakov’s Sadko as a parody of Orientalist representation. Weiner 1995 presents a detailed and controversial claim that Wagner coded certain negative characters as Jewish by employing various anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nEverist, Mark. “Meyerbeer’s Il crociato in Egitto: Mélodrame, Opera, Orientalism.” Cambridge Opera Journal 8.3 (1996): 215–250.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/S0954586700004730Save Citation »Export Citation » Share Citation »\n\nConsiders possible typologies for “exoticism” in relation to the Meyerbeer opera.

Composers in the United States frequently turned to “native” sources (“Indian” songs, “Negro spirituals,” jazz, etc.) in the attempt to create an “American” music distinct from European traditions. This process might be considered a form of nationalism, but certainly involved the imaginative work of exoticism as well.\n\nEurope\n\nEuropean examples of musical exoticism are quite diverse in this period. Taken together, the essays in Maehder 1985 and Groos and Bernardoni 2008 provide wide-ranging perspectives on the Orientalist operas of Puccini—a figure central to musical exoticism in the early 20th century. Sheppard 2015 offers a revisionist perspective on Puccini’s exoticism. Chapters in Watkins 1994 present a broad cultural history of musical exoticism in this period, particularly in France and in works by Debussy and Stravinsky, and Garafola 1989 chronicles the career of the Paris-based Ballets Russes and the multiple Orientalist productions by that company.

Everett 2004 investigates the same period and several of the same composers but arrives at different conclusions. The persistence of exoticism in the postmodern period, with the work of John Zorn as its focus, is the subject of Hisama 2004. Both Brett 2006 and Cooke 1998 discuss exoticism in the music of Benjamin Britten, but from strikingly different perspectives. Cooke focuses primarily on details of musical influence in Britten’s works, and Brett addresses connections between Britten’s homosexual desire and interest in the exotic. Sheppard 2001 also discusses Britten’s musical exoticism—along with the works of later British composers, the American Harry Partch, and more recent Americans—exploring multiple forms of exotic influence and representation in works of modernist music theater. Richardson 1999 considers the relationship between exoticism and minimalism in his extensive study of Glass’s Akhnaten.

The year 1950 serves as a convenient, if somewhat arbitrary, point of division between the “golden age” of popular song and popular music in the rock era. Exoticism in Anglo-American mass-mediated music drew considerably upon late-19th- and early-20th-century techniques and signs of exoticism in Western art music. More recently, popular exoticism in the West has intersected with “world beat” and forms of musical globalization.\n\nPre-1950\n\nIn its focus on the 1916 hit musical Chu Chin Chow, Everett 2007 considers connections between British popular Orientalism and imperialist policies. Farrell 1997 addresses this subject more extensively in investigating the place of music in British interactions with the Indian colony. Both Tsou 1997 and Garrett 2004 uncover representations of Chinese Americans in the Tin Pan Alley era, and Lancefield 2004 presents an extensive and broadly inclusive study, rich with reproduced examples, of this and related topics. In its focus on the figure of Salome in Tin Pan Alley and vaudeville, Hamberlin 2006 resonates with these studies. Sheppard 2001 includes a detailed analysis of musical and cinematic techniques of exotic representation of the Japanese enemy during World War II.

McConachie 1994 claims that the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein convinced many Americans of the necessity of fighting to stop communism in Southeast Asia. Both Hayward 1999 and Ford 2008 explore aspects of exotica, a 1950s and 1960s loosely defined genre of popular music, often featuring light jazz arrangements incorporating exotic instrumentation, which attracted renewed interest in the 1990s. Farrell 1997 covers the most prominent form of exoticism in popular music of this period—the widespread fascination with and impact of Indian music and culture in the 1960s. Hisama 1993 presents a pointed critique of the perpetuation of Orientalist stereotypes in 1980s popular songs. The broader and lasting impact of globalization and popular exoticism in the dynamics of world beat are discussed in Erlmann 1999, with Paul Simon’s Graceland album and the ensemble Ladysmith Black Mambazo as the case study.

These forms include examples in which the subject presents him- or herself as exotic through performance and composition, most often in order to engage the interest of a dominant majority audience. Self-exoticism is not a new phenomenon—recall Franz Liszt’s self-presentation through composition and performance in Western Europe—but it was particularly prevalent in the 20th century. In addition, scholars have begun to note the appearance of exoticism in other locations beyond the Western sphere, as in intra-Asian exoticism or in music of African and Asian urban musicians defining their own modernity in contrast to native and rural traditions. Exotic representation of external and internal others continues to prove efficacious globally for artistic projects aimed at asserting superior cultural status and modernity and offering enticing entertainment.\n\nSelf-Exoticism\n\nWatkins 1994 addresses the self-presentation of African American jazz musicians in the 1920s in the United States and Europe, focusing on Duke Ellington and Josephine Baker. Teal 2012 argues that Duke Ellington’s “jungle style” is evident throughout much of his career and thus was not solely a form of self-exoticism. Shank 2001 offers a broad and efficient overview of exoticism in the experience and reception of black music from the late 19th century to the late 20th century. Hisama 2005 represents a growing scholarly interest in relationships between African Americans and Asian Americans and their musical crossings of multiple racial lines, in this case in recent examples of hip-hop music. Sheppard 2004 offers a profile of a Japanese American composer and arranger whose career in Hollywood was profoundly shaped by musical self-exoticism. Aspects of exoticist reception and self-exoticism in the work of Tan Dun are explored in Sheppard 2009. Mitsui 1998 and Hosokawa 1999 launched the study of self-exoticism within East Asian popular music. Rasmussen 1992 is significant as a rare ethnographic study focusing on exoticism, in this case the self-exoticizing through musical performance of Arab Americans in “Middle Eastern” nightclubs in the United States.

A contemporary example of musical exoticism that resonates with older forms of alla turca discussed in Head 2000 and Hunter 1998 (both cited under 1750–1850), in particular.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nTeal, Kimberley Hannon. “Beyond the Cotton Club: The Persistence of Duke Ellington’s Jungle Style.” Jazz Perspectives 6.1–2 (2012): 123–149.\n\nSave Citation »Export Citation » Share Citation »\n\nOffers a revisionist perspective on Ellington’s self-exoticism. Argues that elements of Ellington’s late 1920s “jungle style” most commonly discussed as a form of self-exoticism actually predate and postdate his years at the Cotton Club. Notes that these stylistic features appear in Ellington’s works late in his career in the 1960s and 1970s in pieces for black African audiences.\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nWatkins, Glenn.

Béhague 2006 is a brief essay on exoticism in works by Latin American composers during the modernist period. Saavedra 2012 focuses on Orientalist works by an early-20th-century Mexican composer. Stokes 2000 and O’Connell 2005 focus on Turkish popular arabesk music, noting connections to Western alla turca and the role of musical exoticism in Turkish conceptions of modernity. A clear case of intra-Asian exoticism—of Japan representing China as exotic through music—is presented in Pope 2003. Similarly, Booth 2007 brings the critical lens of Orientalism to the study of cinema in India, noting parallels between Anglo-American exotic representation and the representation of other Asians in these films. Mitchell 2004 considers exoticism and self-exoticism within an East Asian context, exemplified by the albums of Dick Lee, and the collection Popular Music: Intercultural Interpretations (Mitsui 1998) offers multiple brief essays illustrating the more recent globalization of musical exoticism with wide-ranging examples. Sheppard 2014 investigates intra-Asian Orientalism in Chinese-language popular music at the turn of the 21st century. Waseda 2004 presents a case study in which locating exoticism and determining representational vectors proves complex, given that these Japanese songs were consumed by both Japanese and US military audiences and were often performed by Japanese Americans.\n\nBéhague, Gerard. “Indianism in Latin American Art-Music Composition of the 1920s to 1940s: Case Studies from Mexico, Peru, and Brazil.” Latin American Music Review / Revista de Música Latinoamericana 27.1 (2006): 28–37.\n\nSave Citation »Export Citation » Share Citation »\n\nBrief article that opens up the topic of exoticism within works by major Latin American composers. In an attempt to distinguish their music from European models, these composers appropriated native folk sources and romanticized native culture. Could be compared with Browner 1997 and Pisani 2005 (both cited under United States).\n\nFind this resource:\n\nGoogle Preview»\n\nWorldCat»\n\nBooth, Gregory D. “Musicking the Other: Orientalism in the Hindi Cinema.” In Music and Orientalism in the British Empire, 1780s–1940s.
