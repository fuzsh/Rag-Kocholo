        "text": "First saw it on YouTube when a buddy of mine who's also a film buff recommended it, immediately fell in love with it and asked my girlfriend if she'd be OK with watching a \"documentary\" for movie night. The film had her fully convinced up until the scene where it shows the pictures of the little girl, my girlfriend was theorising it was some sort of small town cult or bath salts. Jesus christ if a mockumentary can actually convince someone it's real for a good chunk of the film it's definitely worth a watch, no idea how this film flew under the radar, it's superb.\n\nAnyone else on here seen it? What did you think?"
