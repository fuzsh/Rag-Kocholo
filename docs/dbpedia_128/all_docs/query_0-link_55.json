        "meta_description": "1 print on wove paper : etching with watercolor ; sheet 24.6 x 34.7 cm. | Charles denounces British and Indian depredations on the American frontier during the War of 1812, alluding  specifically to the practice of offering bounties for American scalps. The cartoon may have been prompted by the August 1812  massacre at Chicago and the purchase of American scalps there by British Colonel Proctor. On the left a British officer  receives a bloody scalp from an Indian, who has a purse with \"Reward for Sixteen Scalps\" hanging from his flintlock. The  Indian's knife and tomahawk bear the initials \"GR\" (for Georgius Rex, i.e., King George). The officer says, \"Bring me the  Scalps and the King our master will reward you.\" From a button on the officer's coat hangs a tag or sack labeled \"Secret  Service Money.\" At right, another Indian is in the process of scalping a fallen soldier; another dead, scalped soldier lies nearby.  In the background two Indians and two soldiers dance about a campfire. Below are eight lines of verse: \"Arise Columbia's  Sons and forward press, / Your Country's wrongs call loudly for redress; / The Savage Indian with his Scalping knife, / Or  Tomahawk may seek to take your life; / By bravery aw'd they'll in a dreadful Fright, / Shrink back for Refuge to the Woods in  Flight; / Their British leaders then will quickly shake, / And for those wrongs shall restitution make.\"",

All images can be viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress. In some cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights restrictions.\n\nAs a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image is available. If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference librarian. (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see online where they are presented as positive images.)"
