        "text": "Whether youâre studying english, literature or even language itâs hard to avoid Shakespeare. So, weâre going to take a broad look at: Shakespeareâs historical context, his language, and of course, what this means for interpreting his plays. Since Shakespeare has so many plays chances are your text will be excluded. Instead Iâm going to use Othello as a case study.\n\nBefore you start reading, LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response is a must-read for anybody studying VCE English.\n\nBackground\n\nOthello follows the Moorish general Othello and his relationship with his wife, Desdemona. The antagonist Iago is jealous that Cassio was made Lieutenant instead of him, and seeks vengeance on Othello. Iago attempts to destroy Othelloâs reputation, and uses the rich but foolish Roderigo to fund his revenge plot. Through careful manipulation of his Wife Emilia, Roderigo, Cassio, and Othello, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona is unfaithful, sending him into an obsessive jealousy. When Emilia steals Desdemonaâs handkerchief, a token of Othelloâs love, and Desdemona cannot produce it, Othello believes he has all the information necessary to condemn Desdemona. He smothers her to death, before Emilia reveals Iagoâs involvement. Othello, struck by regret, stabs himself, declaring that he âloved not wisely but too wellâ\n\nContext\n\nSo who is this Shakespeare guy? And more importantly, what kind of a world did he live in?\n\nShakespeare was born in England in 1564, in the middle of the Renaissance Period. This period of ârebirthâ was categorised by the increasing reliance on ancient classical authors for information about the world. This is why Shakespeare plots are famously reinterpretations of Ancient histories and Roman plays. Changes in education resulted in the Elizabethan moral and social customs being questioned. This included the Divine Right of Kings, and notions of gender and identity.\n\nReligion is also significant in this period, and the Protestant Reformation is a subject often alluded to by Shakespeare. It is necessary to contextualise Shakespeare within the Renaissance period, because as you will see, themes, words, and references that make very little sense to us were common knowledge in Shakespeareâs time, and understanding them boosts our appreciation of his work.\n\nThe context and intent of the author are important considerations when studying VCE English or Literature. For more on this, read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\nThe Language\n\nNow that we understand when Shakespeare was writing, letâs look at how.\n\nStarting as broadly as possible, Shakespeareâs difficult-to-read language is actually Early-Modern English, and so many words Shakespeare used are either lost or unused in modern English. Any good copy of Shakespeare will have definitions of these words in the margin or opposite page.\n\nMoving in closer, we have the two types of plays, Tragedy and Comedy.\n\nComedy is tonally more light-hearted, and has an apparently happy-ending. These are Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, or As You Like It among others. Despite being made to entertain, they are rarely unsophisticated, and the genre may mask something more sinister. For example, the character of Malvolio in Twelfth Night is entertaining and presented as self-obsessed, but could be used as an example of Shakespeare critiquing masculinity in Elizabethan society, as Malvolio feels entitled to Oliviaâs affections.\n\nTragedies cannot be defined by their tone, however. They are defined by a tragic hero, who has a fatal flaw or Hamartia that results in their downfall. This may be Othelloâs Jealousy, Macbethâs ambition, or Brutusâ naivety in Julius Caesar. These traits all cause the tragic heroesâ demise, as their hamartia leads them to make bad decisions or fail to address the real evil. Tragedies will usually end in the unnecessary loss of lives and an unhappy ending for all involved. Most of Shakespeareâs plays fit into tragedy, including most of those based on historical figures. An analysis considering the conventions of Tragedy--like hamartia and tragic heroes--is a great way to stand out when discussing Shakespeare, and so when interpreting a tragedy you should consider what about it is tragic. For example, is Othello a tragedy because Iago is able to manipulate Othello, or is Othelloâs jealousy and mistrust ever-present? Either of these options reveals Othello to be a tragedy, however they both say different things about the characters and plot. If Iago manipulates Othello, the tragedy is because a fundamental good person is corrupted. However if Othello was always mistrusting, the play becomes tragic as the audience must watch an unloving marriage slowly dissolve.\n\nNext, we have the two ways Shakespeare formats his dialogue. Students will often focus on what the characters say without considering how it is said. Knowing the difference between Verse and Prose and how they are used is an easy way to stand out in an essay.\n\nVerse is essentially poetry, where one line follows another. It can rhyme, but often doesnât. What Shakespeare verse will ALWAYS do, however, is follow the Iambic Pentameter. This is a line of poetry with 10 syllables where every second syllable is stressed. This creates a kind of bounce or flow like a heartbeat. The easiest way to recognise this is to count the syllables in each line: thus / do / i / ev / er / make / my / fool / my / purse. Pay attention to when it is not followed, or when characters are interrupted during the pentameter. When the pentameter is interrupted by another character, look at who is interrupting it. It is likely to reveal a power dynamic between the two characters. Alternatively, a character finishing the pentameter, literally finishing their sentence, could be a symbol of love or affection between them. Using linguistic devices like the iambic pentameter as evidence shows an understanding of the text beyond the words spoken\n\nThe alternative format is prose. Itâs used quite sparingly so look out for it. Is the way we speak normally in conversation, or how a normal novel is written. You can tell a character is speaking in prose as itâs usually just a big chunk of text. Shakespeareâs prose can reveal different things, so it depends on the context and the character using it. In act 1 scene 3 of Othello, Iago speaks to Roderigo in prose and then transitions to verse once Roderigo leaves. This displays Iagoâs ability to code-switch and manipulate those around him with words. Prose is considered more simplistic, so in order to control Roderigo, who is presented as quite dumb, Iago relies on simple language, bringing himself to Roderigoâs level. This is directly contrasted with Iagoâs use of the complex verse form, which he uses at all other times.\n\nInterpreting Shakespeare\n\nWeâve now covered Shakespeareâs historical context, his play styles, and his dialogue, but what should we look for when reading Shakespeare that allows us to use this information in a text response or close passage analysis. Iâve already given some examples of how Shakespeareâs language is relevant to his themes, but Iâm going to give a rough guide of what themes are common in Shakespeareâs plays, and how they are shown in the language.\n\nFate versus free-will\n\nThis is a theme that can lead to a long discussion and gives you the opportunity to express your own opinion. Are the characters acting with free-will, or is some other force impacting their fate? This isnât really in Othello, so letâs look quickly at Macbeth; if we consider fate versus free-will with the characteristics of a tragedy in mind, then the tragic hero must act freely even though his âfatal flawâ will lead to his demise. However, the inclusion of the witches in Macbeth subverts the tragic structure and implies Macbeth is being toyed with. Even though Macbeth believes he is in control his fate is met, so is it a coincidence that his decisions fulfill his fate, or was the Witchesâ prophecy real?\n\nAppearance versus reality\n\nThe different uses of verse and prose are a good way to show when characters are genuine or performing for others. I have already mentioned how Iago âcode-switchesâ by using prose to speak to Roderigo, appearing simple and âlaid-back,â but his revelatory soliloquy in verse displays his true nature, both in the content of the speech, and the way it is presented.\n\nOrder and disorder\n\nIn Othello, disorder could be represented by Iago, destabilising the lives of those around him through his use of rhetoric and manipulation. Order is then returned when Iago is revealed and Othello takes his life, recognising himself as tragically misused. Analysing the theme of order and disorder would support the interpretation that Othello is a good man controlled and abused by disorder and manipulation.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, hopefully this very brief introduction helps you get into Shakespeare! Even if I didnât cover your text, the use of tragic heroes, prose, verse, and iambic pentameter are things evident in all Shakespeare plays, so you just have to make it relevant to your text. And remember that in order to read Shakespeare, one must first read Shakespeare. It may take several readings or viewings to grasp what is happening in the play, only after that can you start to analyse in the way I have today.\n\nMeasure for Measure is currently studied in VCE English under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nINTRODUCTIONâ\n\nAhh William Shakespeare. That guy. Youâre probably thinking, âGreat. More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you. (Just try not to overcook it, like I have done with this soup metaphor). If you need more help, How To Write a Standout Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare Essay is for you!\n\nSo, you see, thereâs more to Shakespeare and âMeasure for Measureâ than just fancy old language and iambic pentameter (Whatâs that? Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\n\"Hence we shall see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.â - The Duke lowkey suggesting that once Angelo gets power, heâll change into something evil (Act 1, Scene 4, Line 57)\n\nâSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.â - Escalus is sneakily hating on Angelo. This quote shows that power and authority often involve corruption (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 41)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that power is a dangerous weapon and that in the wrong hands, it could be deadly.\n\nMorality and Sin\n\nThis is an interesting theme. What defines sin? For instance, if Isabella sleeps with Angelo sheâs sinning before God. But if she doesnât, then sheâs letting her brother die, which is not good either. Bit of a pickle that one. Some characters to consider include Isabella, Angelo, The Duke, Claudio, Lucio, the Provostâ¦. jeez just about everyone! So many of the characters take part in questionable deeds. Was it immoral for the Duke to pretend to be a holy friar? Is Claudioâs sin of impregnating Juliet really punishable by death if both parties were willing, and no one else has been punished for the same âcrimeâ? Are Pompey and Mistress Overdone being immoral in being in the prostitution business, if itâs the only way to survive?\n\nDeep stuff man. This can be linked back to class divides, women and the contemporary playhouses/brothels.\n\nâWhat sin you do to save a brotherâs life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtueâ - Claudio begs his sister to sleep with Angelo (immoral, especially since sheâs poised to enter a nunnery), saying that itâs for a good cause, and will actually be a virtue/good deed (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 146-148)\n\nâMight there not be a charity in sin to save this brotherâs life?â - Angelo asking Isabella to sleep with him and trying to paint the act as a charitable deed (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 65-66)\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stickâ - Lucio, who represents sin and immorality in Vienna (weâll talk more about this later in symbols/motifs) (Act 4, Scene 3, Line 182)\n\nâTo bring you thus together âtis no sin, sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit.â - The Friar (Duke), encouraging Isabella and Mariana to do the dodgy bed-trick and trick Angelo (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 79-81)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare tries to tell us that there is a fine line between something moral and something sinful. Maybe heâs asking, âwho are we to judge?â, since we all do questionable things sometimes. Everyone from the almighty Duke to a lowly prostitute has committed potentially immoral acts. Perhaps audiences are encouraged to be more understanding of others, and their reasons for these deeds.\n\nJustice\n\nMmm, this theme ties in nicely with just about all of the others. How does one define justice? The play explores this idea; does justice mean punishment? Or mercy? How do we balance the two to deliver the right punishment/lack thereof? Characters that dispense justice include The Duke, Angelo (although they have differing ideas of justice) and Isabella. Since Vienna is a religious place, consider the divine justice system (ie. a perfect, flawless system meted out by God) and the earthly one (ie. the flawed, human justice system). Laws exist in an attempt to ensure justice. But does it always work? Consider also the Old and New Testament ways of thinking - the former strict and punitive, while the latter is more measured and merciful (see symbols/motifs below for more info).\n\nThis theme can be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, Great Chain of Being, Women, and Jacobean Audience.\n\nâJustice, justice, justice, justice!â - (Wait, are you sure this quote is about justice?) Isabella pleads for (you guessed it) justice to the Duke (no longer dressed as a friar), thinking Angelo has, in fact, killed her brother (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 26)\n\nâThe very mercy of the law cried outâ¦ âAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!â Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure, like doth quit like, and measure still for measureâ - The Duke, explaining that itâs only fair that Angelo die for âkillingâ Claudio. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 437-441)\n\nâliberty plucks justice by the noseâ - The Duke tells Friar Thomas that the laws have slipped over the years, and the citizens of Vienna are not being punished for immoral deeds (prostitution, sex before marriage etc)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare says that since we humans are inevitably flawed, that any justice system created by us will too be imperfect. Who are we to decide the fates of our fellow man? Furthermore, the Bard may be encouraging us to be kind when dispensing justice, leaning more to mercy than punishment.\n\nSexual and Gender Politics\n\nWho run the world? Gir- no itâs a bunch of men. This theme contributes to why âMeasure for Measureâ is a problem play. The exploration of the female characters in this play are very interesting, and kind of sad. Of 20 named characters, only 5 are women. Together, their lines make up only 18% of the play. Yikes! There is a lot to unpack here. Our female characters are Isabella, Mariana, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, Francisca (a nun who speaks twice) and Kate Keepdown (who we never meet). Their situations: a maiden poised to enter a nunnery, a prostitute, a pregnant girl about to lose her husband, a nun, and another prostitute. Quite gloomy, isn't it? Meanwhile, the men are leaders (The Duke, deputy Angelo, and ancient lord Escalus) and gentlemen (Lucio, Claudio, and Froth). Over the course of the play, our female characters are put into worse situations by men. Their experiences are dictated by men. Consider taking a âfeminist perspectiveâ and exploring âMeasure for Measureâ from a female point of view.\n\nThis theme links to the Great Chain of Being, Women and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâsee how he goes about to abuse me!â - These are the last words we hear from Mistress Overdone, as she calls out Lucio for betraying her even though she kept secrets for him. All this happens while sheâs being carted off to prison in only Act 3! What do you think Shakespeare is saying to us? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481)\n\nâThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisâ - The Friar (Duke) says to Juliet that she sinned more than Claudio, even though their sin was âmutually committedâ. Even though they were both consenting, the woman is blamed more. Consider what would become of Juliet if Claudio was executed. Sheâd probably end up like Mistress Overdone... (Act 2, Scene 3, Line 31)\n\nâWho will believe thee, Isabel?â - Angelo says this after Isabella threatens to reveal his disgusting request. Ouch. It really goes to show how untrustworthy women are deemed. Â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163)\n\nâWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?â - The Duke says this to Mariana. Basically, he says a woman can only be those 3 things. Jeez. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 196-197)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio. So, perhaps women do have some power. But, itâs due to their sexuality; something evaluated by men. Peachy. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that women are treated unfairly in society. Maybe he posits that women are afforded so few opportunities in a manâs world. The Bard potentially says that such sexual and gender politics do not create a cohesive and just society.\n\nMercy\n\nThis theme, again, connects to many others. It can link to all groups of people (The wealthy, the poor, women, criminals etc). Most of the mercy is dispensed at the end of the play when the Duke does his grand reveal. Characters who choose to mete out mercy over punishment include The Duke and Isabella. Also consider Angelo, who instead of choosing to spare Claudio, decides to kill him to uphold a law that hasnât seen anyone punished for the same deed. We might think this is harsh, but it a legal and lawful decision.\n\nConnect this idea with historical context, specifically Jacobean audience and playhouses/brothels.\n\nâI find an apt remission in myselfâ - Apt remission = ready forgiveness. The Duke says this after pardoning Angelo (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 539)\n\nâpray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to comeâ - The Duke pardons murderer Barnadine, asking him to use it to do better. How lovely! Â (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 525-526)\n\nâlet us be keen (shrewd/sharp), and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to deathâ - Escalus says this to Angelo, who wants to enact all strict laws immediately. The ever-reliable Escalus advises Angelo to be lenient and merciful. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 6-7)\n\nâMercy is not itself that oft looks so, pardon is still the nurse of second woeâ - Escalus says this, defending Angeloâs decision to punish Claudio. He suggests that sometimes being merciful can encourage further wrongdoing. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 282-283â)\n\nâI show it (pity) most of all when I show justiceâ - Angelo says to Isabella that he is showing Claudio pity/mercy by punishing him. A firm believer in the law, Angelo thinks heâs doing the right thing and teaching Claudio a lesson by punishing him. Â (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 123)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare encourages us to look at mercy and punishment from different perspectives. Angelo believes he is punishing Claudio for his own good, and cleaning up Vienna of lechery too. Maybe we ought to be merciful in our opinion of the deputy. Nonetheless, the Bard shows that in the case of young Claudio, mercy and forgiveness is the right path to choose. Finally, consider why Shakespeare may have portrayed a merciful leader to his Jacobean audience. Maybe if he were to portray a leader as fair and merciful, the Jacobean audience would trust that their new king (a man similar in character to the Duke) could be kind and merciful too. Earning the favour of the king and writing a killer play? Heâs killed two birds with one stone.\n\nHuman Frailty & Fallibility\n\nIâve encountered many essay topics about how humans are flawed and imperfect. Itâs a pretty big theme in many texts, not just in our friend William Shakespeareâs. Human fallibility is to blame for a lot of the going-ons in âMeasure for Measureâ. Angelo takes the law too seriously, he gets heart eyes for Isabella and kills Claudio even though he thinks heâs slept with Isabella. Why? He wants to save his own ass, fearing Claudio will seek vengeance. The Duke is flawed too. Heâs a leader, but he just avoids his problems, leaving Angelo in charge to deal with them. Then he plans to swoop in and look like a hero. Kinda dodgy. Consider Claudio and Juliet too. They, like Angelo, succumbed to lust and slept together before they were officially married. (Sigh, humans just canât get it right.) Itâs also worth thinking about the âlow-livesâ and poorer characters. Are the poor frail in a different way? For example, Mistress Overdone keeps Lucioâs secrets for him. In that way she is virtuous. However, she sells her body to survive. Perhaps she is not prone to desire like Angelo, but serves another desire - a desire to survive?\n\nIn terms of historical context, consider the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâThey say best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most become much more the better for being a little badâ - Mariana pleads to Isabella to support her in begging the Duke to pardon (her new husband) Angelo. She is optimistic for man, believing our bad deeds can lead to self-improvement. (Act 5, Scene 5, Line 473-475)\n\nâWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit onceâ - Isabella pleads to Angelo to pardon Claudio. She states that all souls were flawed before Christ offered redemption. (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 93)\n\nâI speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraintâ - Isabella is speaking to a nun as she is poised to enter the ranks of the nunnery. We usually think of a nun as living a very strict life, but Isabella wants it even stricter! Here we see her flaw is that her thinking is too singular and blinkered. (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 3-4)\n\nâLord Angelo is precise, stands at guard with envy, scarce confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone.â - The Duke talks about how unhuman Angelo is. The deputy follows rules very closely, almost to the point where heâs like a machine. His nature is too strict. Â (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 53-56)\n\nâI love the people, but do not like to stage me to their eyesâ - The Duke says this to Angelo and Escalus as he hands over power to his deputy. Even the Duke is not perfect, in that he does not like being before crowds of his people (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 72-73)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that no one is truly perfect, not even a leader supposedly ordained by God, a law-abiding deputy, or a maiden who is poised to enter a nunnery. Yet while Angelo is overcome by his lust and emotion, the Duke and Isabella attempt to better themselves by showing mercy and temperance. Maybe Shakespeare suggests trying to improve oneâs flawed self is most important.\n\nGod, Religion and Spirituality\n\nPhew, weâre at our last theme. So, society in Vienna is very much religious. Their beliefs dictate actions and laws within the city. Some very religious characters include Isabella and Angelo. However, our novice nun, who is obsessed with virtue and chastity, agrees to and takes part in the bed-trick, a deception that is not particularly Christian. Our lusty deputy also succumbs, hellishly propositioning a maiden to sleep with him in exchange for her brotherâs life. Even The Duke, supposedly semi-divine, makes some dubious choices. He spends most of the play posed as a holy man, even though he is not. He plans the bed-trick to deceive Angelo and lets poor Isabella think her poor brother is dead, instead of saving her so much pain. Furthermore, the title of the tale, âMeasure for Measureâ, comes from the Gospel of Matthew. (See symbols/motifs for more deets). The question of how much we should let religion dictate us is another reason this piece is a problem play.\n\nThe theme of God and Religion can link to historical context such as the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nâmore than our brother is our chastityâ - (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 194) and âBetter it were a brother died at once, than that a sister by redeeming him should die foreverâ - (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 111-113) show that Isabella values her chastity and virtue over her brother!! Damn girl!\n\nâAy, but to die, and go we know not where, to lie in cold obstruction and to rotâ - Claudio tells Isabella that he fears the uncertainty of death. Perhaps his belief in a heaven has left him in the wake of his impending death? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 129-130)\n\nâLetâs write good angel on the devilâs horns - âtis not the devil's crestâ - Angelo is talking to himself about his lust for Isabella. Itâs an appearance vs reality (ooh another theme!) kind of idea, where you can try to pretend something is something else (ie. Angelo doesn't lust after Isabella), but it doesn't change the thing (ie. heâs still keen). The deputy is comparing his emotions to these religious extremes. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 16-17)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare criticises religious extremism in his portrayal of characters like Isabella and Angelo. Or maybe he just wants us to remain open-minded about ideas and our spirituality.\n\nYikes, there are so many themes in this play! Letâs move it along, and talk a little bit about characters.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEach character can be viewed in different lights, even more so than themes can be. Weâre going to discuss characters very briefly because itâs up to you how you want to read them.\n\nHere are the characters, in order of how much they speak in the play. To keep things short, letâs pretend these are all tinder bios. Who would you swipe right on? (Hint: not Lucio)\n\nThe Duke\n\nsuper chill (the benevolent ruler of Vienna whoâs let the laws slip a little)\n\nloves dressing up (actually spends most of the play disguised as a friar)\n\nclever/cunning (secretly counteracts the injustices decreed by Angelo)\n\nIsabella\n\nstrong morals (would rather her brother die than she lives in shame)\n\ncan get wild (conspires with the Duke to complete the bed-trick)\n\nholy gal (poised to enter a nunnery)\n\nLucio\n\na gentleman (well, his title is. Heâs rude about the Duke and abandoned a prostitute that he got pregnant, so maybe heâs not that kind of gentleman)\n\nloves attention (legit! Heâs a minor character but he has the third most lines of them all! Lucio loves to stir the pot!)\n\nloves some symbolism (Lucio represents all the bad stuff in Viennaâ¦..see symbols/motifs)\n\nAngelo\n\nplays by the rules (a little too much)\n\nhypocrite (Sentences Claudio to death for sex before marriage, while asking the same thing of Isabellaâ¦. wow weâve found our antagonist)\n\nDeep (Angelo is a bit of a complex character. He seems aware of his misdeeds and struggles to deal with these desires. Itâs hard not to pity him at times)\n\nEscalus\n\nreliable (consistently counsels Angelo against acting too harshly)\n\nvirtuous (heâs merciful, lets Pompey go with a warning in Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nloyal (trusts in the Duke)\n\nProvost\n\nhard worker (heâs a prison ward)\n\nvirtuous (does whatâs right by him, disobeying Angeloâs orders to behead Claudio)\n\nmagician (not really, but he makes Angelo believe that pirate Ragozineâs head is Claudioâs)\n\nPompey\n\nclever (philosophically debates whether prostitution is worse than murder)\n\nfunny (his character is the clown, and heâs got some sassy comebacks)\n\npoor (Pompey is a bawd employed by Mistress Overdone. Not the best dating bio)\n\nClaudio\n\ndown for a good time ;) (impregnates Juliet before they are officially married)\n\ncool family (heâs Isabellaâs brother)\n\ngood hearted (initially is horrified at Angeloâs request of Isabella, saying she shouldnât do it. Unfortunately, his fear of death getâs to him. After heâs calmed down, heâs accepting of death)\n\nElbow\n\na man in uniform (a policeman)\n\na little dumb (he speaks a lot of malapropisms - hilariously using similar but incorrect words)\n\nnot like Pompey (Pompey is a clever poor man, while Elbow is a policeman whoâs a little bit all over the place)\n\nMariana\n\ndedicated (still in love with Angelo even though he called off their engagement because her dowry was lost)\n\na willing accomplice (participates in the bed-trick)\n\nMistress Overdone\n\npoor (sheâs a prostitute, who fears for her livelihood when Angelo announces heâs destroying all the brothels)\n\ngood hearted (kept Lucioâs secret. What secret? Read onâ¦)\n\nAbhorson\n\nworks for the Duke (as an executionerâ¦. thereâs no way to make that sound nice)\n\ndoesn't have a great name (câmon itâs true)\n\nJuliet\n\nalso likes to have a good time ;) (pregnant before official marriage)\n\ndependent (if Claudio dies she will probably end up as a prostitute to survive)\n\nBoy\n\ncan sing (Mariana asks him to sing a sad song about how she lost her beloved Angelo)\n\nFrancisca\n\nholy gal (she is a nun)\n\nKate Keepdown (we never actually meet this character)\n\na colleague of Mistress Overdone (a prostitute)\n\nsingle mum (Lucio got her pregnant and then ran away. He thinks marrying a prostitute is akin to whipping and hanging)\n\nRagozine (we never actually meet this character)\n\ndies (legit thatâs all he does)\n\nSYMBOLS & MOTIFS\n\nThese are people, objects, words etc that represent a theme or idea. For instance, the fact that Iâve used a bad soup metaphor AND a tinder reference means I need to go outside more. But letâs move onâ¦\n\nTitle\n\nThe title, âMeasure for Measureâ draws from the gospel of Matthew. The idea of heavenly justice vs earthly justice is prominent throughout the text. Moreover, itâs worth exploring the Old Testament ways of âan eye for an eyeâ and âmeasure for measureâ in comparison to the New Testament teachings which lean towards forgiveness and mercy. Now, where do the Dukeâs actions fit in? Is he harsh and equalising? Is he just and sympathetic? Â\n\nNew Testament vs. Old Testament\n\nWhen the Duke sentences Angelo to death, he makes a fancy speech which includes the playâs title.\n\nââAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!\n\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure.\n\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.â\n\nAct 5, Scene 1, Line 439-441\n\nThis mimics the Old Testament views, which famously states âeye for eye, tooth for toothâ (Exodus 21:24). These ideals teach that the person who committed a misdeed shall have the same misdeed done unto them. (For example, if you donât like my new Facebook profile picture, Iâm not liking yoursâ¦..but way more severe.)\n\nIn comparison, the New Testament states that we âBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.â (Luke 6:36-37)\n\nSo, when sentencing Angelo the Duke employs the words of the Old Testament. However, he doesnât go through with Angeloâs execution, instead showing the mercy encouraged by the New Testament. Heâs not really following either way. Perhaps heâs instead choosing a middle road; one of temperance and justice.\n\nLucio\n\nWait, who? We havenât mentioned the âgentlemanâ Lucio much in the plot and in this blog post. Thatâs because he doesnât really do that much other than buzz around and annoy everyone. Maybe thatâs why his name rhymes with mosquitoâ¦.\n\nRegardless, we do see enough of Lucioâs character to learn that heâs not a very nice person. He treats Mistress Overdone and Pompey poorly, makes visits to the brothel, doesnât take responsibility for his actions (getting Kate Keepdown pregnant) and bad-mouths the Duke. So yeah, we donât like Lucio, whatâs the big deal? Well, in Act 4, Scene 4 Line 182, Lucio says something very intriguing.\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stick.â\n\nBurr - those little brown prickly things that get stuck to you.\n\nWe can think of Lucio as representing all the sins and misdeeds in Vienna - lechery, immorality, lack of justice, selfishness etc. Hence, Lucio is saying that these shortcomings and flaws will always be present to people and in Vienna, sticking to the city like a nasty burr. Damn, thatâs deep.\n\nProse/Verse\n\nThe metre of the verse (ie. the classic Shakespeare writing) in ââMeasure for Measureâ Â is iambic pentameter. This means that each line is divided into 5 feet. Within each foot, there is one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.\n\nConsider:\n\nIâll TELL him YET of ANgelOâS reQUEST, And FIT his MIND to DEATH, for HIS soulâs REST. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 195-196)\n\nVerse does not have to rhyme, as the above lines do. Shakespeare often employs a rhyming couplet to close a scene and add some drama.\n\nVerse is usually reserved for the higher class citizens, with those who are less fortunate speaking in prose.\n\nProse is language in its ordinary form, with no metre.\n\nCertain characters, such as Lucio, switch between verse and prose depending on who they are speaking to. This could allude to Lucioâs duplicity, or perhaps a deep understanding of class divides in Vienna.\n\nNames: Escalus and Angelo\n\nEscalus is the ever reasonable and loyal lord and close confidant of the Duke. His name gives connotations of scales and balance - characteristic of the rational man.\n\nAngeloâs name has connotations of âangelâ. If we judge him only by his name, he should be a pure and heavenly being. Bah! Thatâs so fake! We can see that appearance is very different from reality. Isabella notices this too, stating that âthis outward-sainted deputy...is yet a devilâ (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 95-98).\n\nAngeloâs Words/Actions\n\nThere is so much to unpack about this douchebag. Let us briefly consider 2 ideas. When he propositions Isabella to sleep with him, he requests that she âlay down the treasures of (her) bodyâ (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 100).\n\nFirstly, thatâs weird. Perhaps Angelo can be seen as someone who is obsessed with the physical - Isabellaâs body and treasure. Maybe this obsession leads to his immorality and poor leadership.\n\nSecondly, Angelo struggles to directly say, âhey, letâs sleep togetherâ. He weaves his way around the request, propositioning Isabella so indirectly that at first, she does not even seem to understand his request! However, once she threatens to tell everyone about his vile demand, he speaks bluntly; âWho will believe thee, Isabel?â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163). Perhaps this shows Angelo is self-aware that heâs being an ass. Or maybe this scene is yet more evidence of a patriarchal society, with the men knowing very well the power they hold.\n\nRagozine\n\nWe never actually meet this fellow. Ragozine is a pirate who dies in jail while âMeasure for Measureâ unfolds. His head is used in place of Claudioâs to convince Angelo of the formerâs execution. Fascinatingly, Ragozine is the only person who dies in the entire play. ALSO, he dies of natural causes. Interesting. It feels like the play is full of death, grief and many heads on the chopping block. But curiously, there is only one death, of a minor character, of natural causes. Perhaps this says something about fate and justice or offers some commentary on life and hope.\n\nElbow vs. Pompey\n\nElbow is a silly policeman who speaks in malapropisms (using a similar but incorrect word for humorous effect). Pompey is a clever pimp who seems to have a deep understanding of justice and the Viennese people. The comparison of these characters, fortunate and dumb to unfortunate and clever, perhaps serves to show that the law is not always apt and that sometimes those who break the law are more clever than it.\n\nMistress Overdone (or lack thereof)\n\nMistress Overdone is a pitiable prostitute. She worries for her survival when Angelo begins pulling down the brothels, and she keeps Lucioâs bastard child a secret, only for him to throw her under the bus to save his own skin. The last we see of Mistress Overdone is her getting carted off to prison, crying âSee how he goes about to abuse me!â (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481) Yes, the last we witness of one of five speaking female characters is of her imminent incarceration. Furthermore, this happens in Act 3 of 5, around halfway through the play! The audience never hears from Mistress Overdone again, and her future is left uncertain. Even Barnadine, a convicted murderer, is given freedom and a happy ending.\n\nConsider writing a few sentences of your essay from a feministâs perspective. Think about the events of the play from the female charactersâ points of view. What is Shakespeare saying by portraying Mistress Overdone (and other women) in such a way? Perhaps he is pointing out the injustices of the patriarchal system, or how uncertain a womanâs life was in his contemporary time.\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ truly is an incredible text. This blog post is by no means an exhaustive list of all its quirks and complexities. This playâs relevance has survived centuries, and I believe it will continue to be pertinent to audiences well into the future. You are very lucky to be studying a text with such universal themes and ideas that you can carry with you even after high school.\n\nAnna Funderâs Stasiland and Kazuo Ishiguroâs Never Let Me Go bring together two complex, poignant worlds of âpersonal storiesâ and subjective narration of what once was, an individual's place in history and its aftermath, especially when the world attempts to move on.\n\nContext\n\nStasiland\n\nEstablishing a literary allusion to Lewis Carrollâs Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland in the title, Funderâs narrator of Anna fills the role of Alice as she stumbles upon and explores the absurd and unjust world of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Driven by an almost naive curiosity, akin to Alice herself, Funder conducts extensive interviewing to uncover not only the stories and experiences of the victims of the regime, but also of the Stasi, the âinternal army by which the government kept controlâ. Through her literary journalism, Funder creates an intimate and sensory experience for the reader, extending beyond factual occurrences to capture the âhorror-romanceâ of East Germany, âa country which no longer existsâ but its inhabitants, victims and perpetrators continue to live on.\n\nâ\n\nTIP - Research the history of the German Democratic Republic, the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall and the influence of the Soviet Union within East Germany, in contrast to West Germany. Understanding the backbone of âthis land gone wrongâ in which Funder delves into gives much greater context for the significance of her work and ideas in which you can explore in your writing.\n\nâ\n\nNever Let Me Go\n\nIshiguro delves into human mortality through the platform of a science fiction world, where the focus is ultimately on the prospect of an existence where oneâs life is knowingly shortened, and what becomes important with such a backdrop. Readers are introduced to the concept of âclonesâ, existing as live incubators of organs that will be later harvested for others. Perceived by society as less than humans, Ishiguroâs narrative focuses on clones who spent time at Hailsham, a boarding school âexperimentâ in England which attempted to provide a more âhumaneâ education and upbringing for clones, and their sheltered perspectives on their existence, their mortality and purpose.\n\nAuthorsâ views and values\n\nWhy have Funder and Ishiguro written what they have written?\n\nFunderâs dogged pursuit to uncover and reveal the âportraitsâ of individuals who lived through the GDR was prompted by West Germanyâs dismissal of, and use of stereotypes when these individuals were concerned, and the assumption that âno-one is interested in these peopleâ. She discovers that âthings have been put behind glassâ, in the forms of museums and metaphorical mausoleums, âbut they are not yet overâ. Stasiland therefore acts as a work that champions the importance of memory, of remembering and of history, as Sisyphean of a task as this inevitably is because it is âworkingâ¦ against timeâ. In addition, Funderâs purposeful choice to include the perspectives of the Stasi themselves opens up another realm of understanding to the reader. It allows the audience to examine the Stasi's motives and justifications, their humanity or lack thereof, of the lessons learnt and unlearnt, as a means of framing the entire regime and of framing the spectrum of humanity.\n\nWhilst Ishiguroâs universe differs greatly when placed alongside Stasiland, his characters also belong to a world that no longer exists, as their Hailsham upbringing evolves into a historical artefact, reflective of a world that âwanted [the clones] back in the shadowsâ and which remained oblivious to the reality of the clonesâ existence. Ishiguro gives voice to the clones; the âpoor creaturesâ who otherwise possessed no voice or recognised humanity in this world, and no purpose apart from their utility as organ donors. These individuals are shown to be no less human than you and I, and it is in their sheltered lives, headed towards âwherever it was [they were] supposed to beâ, which permits the reader to examine their own life purpose and meaning, and how a cloneâs existence is ultimately reduced in not only length, but also ability and capacity. Â\n\nBoth texts confront uncomfortable truths about humanity and reality, the treatment that certain individuals were unfortunately subjected to which resulted in their dehumanising, and which âbrokeâ them, sooner or later.\n\nâ\n\nTIP - Reframe this question for any text you are studying - including text response! There is intent and purpose underlying each and every text that is definitely worthy of thorough unpacking and consideration; the thinking you will do will help to further your analysis and comparison considerably.\n\nâ\n\nThemes and Comparison\n\nWhat are the big ideas underpinning the texts? How are they explored? What sorts of comparisons can be drawn between the two texts?\n\nAt LSG, we use the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy to help us easily find points of similarity and difference. This is particularly important when it comes to essay writing, because you want to know that you're coming up with unique comparative points (compared to the rest of the Victorian cohort!). I don't discuss this strategy in detail here, but if you're interested, check out my How To Write A Killer Comparative. I use this strategy throughout my analysis of the following themes.\n\nâ\n\nDystopian reality\n\nStasiland: As prompted by the VCAA 2015 exam, the GDR is indeed âcruel and absurdâ, especially in the methods the nation constructed and enforced this society, as this ultimately broke the souls of innocent individuals, and left questions unanswered and scars unhealed for many. It showcases how what could potentially be described as 'idealistic' in terms of government control can become grotesque, how otherworldly and Orwellian this recent history seems, and how the perspectives of victim, perpetrator, outsider and more are not restricted to the land of the GDR, but to today as well. In addition, as Funder discovers, these perspectives are closely intertwined, in which certain individuals of the Stasi were victimised too, and could not remain in the \"group in the know [as] one of the unmolested\".\n\nNever Let Me Go: The novelâs context of clones is removed from the reality that readers are familiar with, and as Ishiguro focuses on the clonesâ perspectives throughout, there always remains an element that feels 'off' and ânot quite rightâ about who they are and the purpose of their existence. Whilst the context of Never Let Me Go differs greatly from a regime with \"the most perfected surveillance state of all time\", it highlights an unsettling reality, in which scientific advancement has resulted in a society benefitting from the clones' existence and from organ harvesting, but who are also rejecting of the possibility of their humanity. The clones may never be able to perceive and fully understand this cruelty or absurdity themselves, but this does not mean they are not victims of this, for a fate that they could not choose.\n\nPossible points for comparison: The victimisation of individuals in both texts, whether it was internalised or ushered into oblivion is central to the absurd worlds of Stasiland and Never Let Me Go. The clones are in a way, victims from birth, and unable to avoid their shortened existence and purpose, whereas those in the GDR who were subjected to surveillance, interrogation, torture, etc. became ensnared and damaged beyond repair; the aftermath of which they were unable to escape from. However, the closing of Hailsham and the falling of the Berlin Wall spell out different fates in the two texts - those in Stasiland may be \"fettered\" by their past that is \"not ever, really, over\", but are provided a future in which there is hope for rebirth in the \"green\", \"lush\" city of Berlin and beyond. On the contrary, the clones are only able to move toward their fate, towards \"wherever it was [they are] supposed to be\" and towards completion. Coupled with the naivety accompanying the clones' existence, their acceptance of what is ahead and the lack of awareness surrounding their victimisation, readers are prompted to consider the cruelty of such existence, and whether there is greater tragedy in having your \"soul buckled out of shape, forever\", or in never knowing who you really are.\n\nâ\n\nThe act of remembering\n\nStasiland: In discussing and unearthing a recent history of a \"bygone world\" that many individuals wish to \"pretend it was never there\", Funder's attempt to create and immortalise \"portraits\" of East Germans raises questions about how events and lives are remembered and forgotten. Especially when elements of this past in the GDR could not be \"pinned down by facts, or documents\", the detrimental impact of a lack of recognition and acknowledgement of one's past, especially one filled with trauma, is thereby highlighted by Funder. When the rest of the world deems the GDR and the Stasi to only belong \"behind glass\" in museums and yet it is \"not yet over\" for those who are still suffering and carrying scars, physical and psychological, the purpose of Stasiland rings clear and true. Whilst it is a Sisyphean attempt, \"working against forgetting, and against time\", through Stasiland, Funder ultimately gives a voice to the \"personal stories\" comprising history, before there are \"none left\".\n\nNever Let Me Go: Through the lens of Kathy H's narration and the recollection of her memories surrounding her upbringing, readers uncover the pieces of her existence as moments of her past begin \"tugging at [her] mind\". Memory itself can be fickle, recording and preserving certain experiences but not others, and as time passes, \"fading surprisingly quickly\" before being lost in the ether of one's past. Ishiguro's continual mention of Kathy's memories of an event, of her years at Hailsham and beyond almost lulls the reader into overlooking this element of the narration - in which the reader's understanding is built upon an uncertain and incomplete foundation of facts; similar to how the clones' \"sheltered\" understanding of their world came to be. After Hailsham closes, its existence recedes into the memories of the clones, and although Kathy declares that the memories will be retained \"safely in [her] head\", upon her completion, this will also be lost, and Hailsham will be further diminished in history as a 'failed experiment' and one day forgotten.\n\nPossible points for comparison: The valiant efforts to remember and preserve the once-was is woven into the fabric of both texts, despite the inevitability of forgetting as death and 'completion' claims those who lived through East Germany and Hailsham respectively. When the recent history of the GDR becomes a \"lost world\", and the importance of remembering what transpired is being superseded by the innovation and process of the present, it opens up room for the same mistakes of the past to be made again. Hailsham was an attempt to create a more idealised and humane upbringing for the clones, and to showcase their humanity in a society which rejected this, and the boarding school's closure reflects a failure in which any previous successes will never be acknowledged. Memory, and by extension, one's understanding of the past is what enables change in the future; in attitude, in approach, in the treatment of others, in decisions, in growth, as an individual and as a whole. With its gradual loss, it may also be ineluctable that history repeats itself in one way or another.\n\nâ\n\nSubjective narration, stories and lives\n\nStasiland: Stasiland itself is comprised of the stories of human lives, and includes various individuals' tenacity, strength and courage to their vices, cruelty and cowardice. By seeking out not only those who were victims of the regime but also perpetrators, Funder examines the many complex facets of human nature and the irreversible impact of the GDR on East Germans and who they became or were broken into. However, the personal involvement of Anna as a narrator and most importantly, as an outsider to the GDR provides a subjective perspective of this history. Whilst this has received criticism, it is important to consider how the human experience itself is subjective, as is never being able to truly understand another individual's story as the exact experience is theirs alone to hold and perhaps be \"fettered\" to; both of which are evident in Stasiland.\n\nNever Let Me Go: Ishiguro constructs a narrative in which Kathy H and the clones are assumed human individuals from the textâs introduction, and it is only as the clones uncover how they may be \"troubling and strange\" that the reader gains a sense of how they are perceived in society as sub-human. However, the pre-determined fate and mortality of these \"poor creatures\", especially as they are born and 'complete' seemingly without a scope of awareness beyond their exposure during their upbringing and their sole purpose as organ donors - renders their lives even more heart wrenching and tragic - and human. The simplicity with which Ishiguro details the musings and reflections of Kathy H, and in the concluding moment of her imagined fantasy of Tommy, as not \"out of control\" as she may felt, readers cannot ignore the stark juxtaposition with the circumstances of her existence, in which she ultimately has no control over her identity as a clone. To grasp autonomy, to defy and deviate from being \"wherever it was [she] was supposed to be\", even for a moment, Ishiguro portrays a courage which is undoubtedly human. Â\n\nPossible points for comparison: When faced with the stories of lives not our own, but each individual possessing elements which resonate and resemble us, it is much more possible to understand their struggles, their intentions and their experiences. Consider the story behind each face, each character, each name, not only in these two texts but also other texts and even our lives, as we are fundamentally more similar than different when compared to each other, even in the face of separation and distinction.\n\nâ\n\nUltimately, Funder and Ishiguro's texts probe the existential question of what it means to be human and what defines one's identity, and how it is shaped by experience, fate, intentions and actions. Question the texts, question the characters, question yourselves, and you'll discover worlds and perspectives closer to home than the GDR or Hailsham may initially seem.\n\nContents\n\n1.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSummary\n\nThings Fall Apart is set in a fictional group of Igbo villages called Umuofia, around the beginning of the twentieth century. The first half of the novel is dedicated to an almost anthropological depiction of Igbo village life and culture through following the life of the protagonist Okonkwo. Okonkwo is the greatest wrestler and warrior alive in the nine villages and beyond. He has dedicated his life to achieving status and proving his strength to avoid becoming like his father Unoka â a lazy, improvident, but gentle man. Weakness is Okonkwoâs greatest fear. After men in another village kill a woman from Umuofia, a boy named Ikemefuna is given to Umuofia as compensation and lives in Okonkwoâs compound until the Gods decide his fate. Ikemefuna quickly becomes part of Okonkwoâs family; he is like a brother to Okonkwoâs son Nwoye and is secretly loved by Okonkwo as well. Over the next three years, the novel follows Okonkwoâs family through harvest seasons, religious festivals, cultural rituals, and domestic disputes. Okonkwo is shown to be more aggressive than other Igbo men and is continually criticized and rebuked by the village for his violence and temper. When the Oracle of the Hills and Caves decides that Ikemefuna must be killed, Okonkwo is warned by a respected elder to have no hand in the boyâs death because Ikemefuna calls him âfatherâ. However, afraid of being thought weak, when Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo in hope of protection, Okonkwo delivers the fatal blow. Ikemefunaâs brutal death deeply distresses Nwoye who becomes afraid of his father.Â\n\nAt the end of Part One, Okonkwo accidentally kills a clansman at a funeral after his faulty gun explodes and is exiled to his motherland, Mbanta. During his exile, British missionaries arrive in Mbanta and establish a church. Nwoye, disillusioned with his own culture and Gods after Ikemefunaâs death, is attracted to Christianity and is an early convert. This is a heartbreaking disappointment to Okonkwo. When Okonkwo and his family return from exile after seven years they find that the missionaries and colonial governors have established Umuofia as the center of their new colonial government. Clashes of culture and morality occur, and as the British make the Igbo more dependent on them through introducing trade and formal education, the Igbo way of life is continually undermined. When a Christian convert unmasks an egwugwu during a tribal ritual, a sin amounting to the death of an ancestral spirit, the egwugwu burn down the village church. The men who destroyed the church are arrested and humiliated by the District Commissioner, and Okonkwo beheads a court messenger at a village council in rebellion. When none of his clansmen rise with him against the British, Okonkwo realizes his culture and way of life is lost and commits suicide in despair. Suicide is a crime against the Earth Goddess, Ani, so Okonkwo is left to rot above ground in the Evil Forest, like his father Unoka â a shameful fate he spent his life desperate to avoid. The final paragraph, written from the perspective of the District Commissioner, reduces Okonkwoâs life to a single sentence about his death in his planned book The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of The Lower Niger. Achebe has filled an entire novel with evidence of the complexity and sophistication of Okonkwoâs individual and social life and the District Commissionerâs casual dismissal and belittling of him causes us to flinch with horror and dismay. This is a metaphor for the reduction of Igbo culture in the eyes of its colonizers.Â\n\nThe title gives away the plot of the novel and anticipates the collapse of Okonkwo and his society. Things Fall Apart is about the connection between the tragic downfall of Okonkwo, who fate and temperamental weakness combine to destroy, and the destruction of his culture and society as the Igbo way of life is assailed by forces they do not understand and are unprepared to face.Â\n\nThemes\n\nA Full and Fair Representation of Ibo Traditional Life\n\nThe first part of the novel presents the traditional world of the Ibo with specificity and vibrancy. The imbedded descriptions of the patterns of interaction, daily routines and seasonal rituals of Ibo life creates an overwhelming impression of community and shared culture. We see the established system of values which regulates collective life and how closely related this is to natural cycles and environments. The Iboâs moral values are contained in sayings and stories, rituals and festivals. Achebe depicts a comprehensive and sustaining social, spiritual, economic, agricultural, and legal order. (Chapters to consider: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 19)\n\nWhile Ibo society is marked by the internal coherence of its organization and the poetry of its rituals, this coherence is partially formed by the repression of the individual and the inflexibility of social norms. Achebe shows the violence, dehumanization, and discrimination vulnerable groups experience in Umuofia due to the rigid adherence to tradition and superstition. This includes the customary abandonment of newborn twins, the sacrificial murder of Ikemefuna in the name of justice, and the discriminatory caste structure that denies inclusion to the osu (Chapters 7, 18).\n\nObierikaâs questioning of the stern logic of some customs suggests that many laws are enacted from a sense of duty and inevitability rather than from a firm conviction in their justice or efficacy (Chapter 13). The cultural demand for conformity places a huge moral and psychological burden on individuals who must reckon with the sometimes heartless will of the gods. This internal tension is epitomized in the character of Okonkwo, discussed below.Â Â\n\nClash of Cultures\n\nWhen the Ibo are confronted with rival institutions a mirror is held up to their society. Fall Apart honestly considers and reflects on Ibo practices, customs, values, and beliefs. The novel is a frank articulation of the nature of the African past and its relevance to the present and future. Achebe wants to illuminate Ibo culture to dispense with lingering colonial prejudices, but he is not sentimental or nostalgic for the past. Instead he is shifting through it to identify the valuable aspects of Ibo culture to bring into the future and help define Nigeriaâs post-independence identity.\n\nAchebe recognises that the colonial encounter which led, swiftly and seemingly inevitably, to the disintegration of Ibo culture revealed its profound weaknesses. Achebe suggests that with the arrival and contrast against another culture, a cultural reckoning was inevitable for the Ibo. However, cultural reckoning and revaluation is not the same thing as destruction and erasure. The British colonialists were a hostile force seeking cultural domination. By pointing out some of the weaknesses of the Ibo tradition, Achebe in no way excuses or justifies colonial domination or diminishes the pain and tragedy of the cultural erasure that occurred.\n\nColonial Domination\n\nThe anti-colonial position and purpose of the novel is powerfully clear. Achebe depicts the process of colonial initial establishment and the resultant cultural suspension of Ibo society. The British colonizers believed in their inherent cultural superiority and arrived in Umuofia with the intention to âbring civilizationâ (p.151) to Africa. They wanted to achieve full control by supplanting Ibo religion and culture with their own.\n\nThe British arrived quietly and non-confrontationally with their religion and the clans allow them to stay, misinterpreting their silence as peaceability. An Ibo proverb warns that there is danger in silence and nothing to fear from someone who reveals their motivations (Chapter 15). Obierika recognizes how the white manâs strategy disguised their intentions and gave them the freedom to grow and fortify. He explains the political consequences for the clan, now divided by the new religion, they can no longer act as one (Chapter 20). Without strength in unity, the Ibo are vulnerable to further encroachment of British control in their other institutions.\n\nAs only a small number of Ibo initially converted to Christianity, the church was only able to establish itself firmly in the villages because of the Iboâs religious tolerance (Chapter 2, 22). Mr Brown learns about Ibo religion and his willful blindness to its complexity shows how the colonizers justified their colonial rule and imposition through labelling their subjects âprimitiveâ. Mr Brown understands that Christianity held no appeal for people well integrated in Ibo society, concluding that âa frontal attack on it would not succeedâ (p.132) and thus introduces education as a new method of cultural displacement and erasure. Additionally, trade also increased the Iboâs dependence on the introduced economy (Chapter 21).\n\nFrom the very first introduction of the colonizers we understand that violence and fear were tools of oppression and dominance, forcing the Ibo to submit and keeping them unresisting (Chapter 15, 20, 23). Not only do the British impose foreign rule on the Ibo and judge them by standards they do not recognize, the District Commissionerâs personal brand of âjusticeâ is corrupt and hypocritical. When the elders are arbitrarily and falsely imprisoned, he tells them that what they have done âmust not happen in the dominion of our queenâ (p.141), combining personal corruption with a state apparatus of paternalism, hegemony, and occupation (Chapter 20, 23).\n\nDogmatic zealot, Reverend Smith, encourages fanaticism in his converts, motivating them to insult and humiliate the clan (Chapter 22). Under Reverend Smithâs wrathful guidance, the colonial agenda becomes transparently aggressive. The grief and pathos of the Iboâs situation and collective trauma is displayed evocatively in the final episodes as Achebe depicts this painful moment of acute crisis (Chapter 22, 23, 24, 25).\n\nFate\n\nA recurring thematic question in Things Fall Apart is to what degree the collapse of the Ibo and the downfall of Okonkwo are due to their own internal weaknesses or the whims of a pernicious fate.Â\n\nThe Ibo understand fate to be in a dynamic and somewhat ambiguous relationship with personal agency. This is evident in their proverb âwhen a man says yes his chi says yes alsoâ (p.20) which acknowledges and privileges the role of an individualâs choices in shaping their destiny (Chapter 4). The saying âas a man danced so the drums were beaten for himâ (p.135) also relates this idea â fate is a response to oneâs behaviour. Okonkwo is warned that killing Ikemefuna, his surrogate son, is the âkind of action for which the goddess wipes out whole familiesâ (p.49).This demonstrates the clanâs belief that the goddessâs (or fateâs) punishments are not arbitrary but the result of individual action (Chapter 8).\n\nAlthough there is an element of chance in Okonkwoâs gun accidentally exploding and killing someone, his exile carries the suggestion of just comeuppance in its echo of the guns failure to shoot when purposely aimed at Ekwefi (Chapter 5, 13). Likewise, although the arrival of the Christians was unexpected and chanced, Nwoyeâs rejection of his father is traceable directly to Okonkwoâs choice to kill Ikemefuna (Chapter 7). The desertion of people injured by Ibo traditions is a blow to the clan that feels equally earned (Chapters 16, 17, 18).Â Â\n\nAfter his exile, Okonkwo believes his chi has turned against him (Chapter 14). He renunciates the wisdom of his elders by denying the active role he had in directing the course of events. His refusal to reflect on the connection between his actions and punishment reflect his fatal flaws: hubris and willful lack of self-knowledge. By refusing to self-analyze and self-correct, Okonkwo loses the opportunity of redemption. Comparably, the Ibo, despite believing in a relationship between action and fate, do not reflect on the cause of their kinsmenâs desertion to Christianity. Achebe provides numerous examples of the clanâs dogma and brutal traditions denying people such as Ikemefuna or twins control over their lives (Chapter 2, 7). It was the shortcomings of the Ibo social and religious order that made members susceptible to the attraction of a competing value system with a more articulated concept of individuality. The Iboâs cultural lack of self-apprehension meant they could not adjust their traditions to save themselves.\n\nHowever, just as Achebe shows how individuals in the clan are at the mercy of rigid overarching authority, he shows how the fateful forces of history constrain human agency. The Britishâs hostile intention to erase and supplant the Ibo way of life is a punishment greater than the Ibo deserve and a force stronger than they can rise to. In his description of the grief and trauma of colonial imposition, Achebe demonstrates his compassion and sorrow for the Ibo as they faced the sweeping and unforgiving forces of change in their moment of historical crisis.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. \"Things Fall Apart demonstrates how the values and customs of a society help us to deal with the familiar but not with change.\" Discuss.\n\n2. \"Traditional ideas of honour dominate Okonkwo's life and finally they destroy him.\" Discuss.\n\n3. \"Nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories his mother used to tell.\" How does Achebe explore masculinity in Things Fall Apart?\n\nâ\n\nNow it's your turn!

The frequent beating and violence fortifies the portrayal of him as a man who is governed by his hatred of âgentility and idlenessâ, further showing the terror that his wives are forced to be living in.\n\n\"Do what you are told woman. When did you become one of the ndichie (meaning elders) of Umuofia?\"\n\nHe also sees his wifeâs mere act of questioning as disrespect, as evidenced through the ways in which he implies that she is overstepping her role.\n\nâThere were many women, but they looked on from the fringe like outsiders\"\n\nThis simile also shows how women are often marginalised and treated as outcasts, underlining the overarching yearning for social justice throughout the text. This pitiful image of women looking âon from the fringeâ also helps Achebe relay his criticism of gender double standards and the unfairness that Igbo women are forced to live with.\n\nAchebeâs sympathy for womenâs suffering and condemnation of menâs mistreatment towards are also evident through his depiction of a society that normalises misogyny.\n\nâHis mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew womenâs cropsâ¦ Yam, the king of crops, was a manâs cropsâ\n\nThe personification of the crops, in particular, the menâs crops, the âyamâ, being the âking of cropsâ establishes this gender hierarchy in yet another way. More specifically, the position of men in the social hierarchy is highlighted and the negative connotation attached to the âwomenâs cropsâ undermine their hard work, rendering it in significant.\n\nWhile women are the main victims of Igbo gendered prejudice, Achebe does not disregard the undue burden that societal expectations impose on men.\n\nâHe was afraid of being thought weak.â\n\nAchebe explores the burdens of unrealistic expectations that are placed on both men and women. This quote exemplifies societal expectations on men to be strong, powerful and fearless leaders who never show emotions. Achebeâs sympathies regarding these expectations show us that this is an important critique in Things Fall Apart that we can analyse.\n\nIf you find this helpful, then you might want to check out our Things Fall Apart: A Killer Text Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Neither of them is that close to dying - both are young adults. Charlotte doesnât really want a coffin so she runs away from home, as far as she can while still remaining in Tasmania at least, and Robbie Arnott takes us on this adventure through interweaving perspectives and rich imagery of his home island.\n\nSome of these perspectives are surprising and unexpected, ranging from a hardcore private investigator to a river god in the form of a water rat, but each of them earns their place in the story. Our job when studying this text is to follow these shifts in perspectives and make sense of how they contribute to the overall text. If youâre writing creatively, you may want to play around with this sort of structure as well in your piece.\n\n2. What Is Magical Realism?\n\nBefore we get stuck into the text itself, it might be useful to first discuss its genre. Magical realism books tend to be extremely confusing if youâre not familiar with the genre (and sometimes even when you are!). This is because authors in this genre will typically set their stories in the real world (in this case, in Tasmania), but theyâll add supernatural elements, which vary wildly from story to story.\n\nLetâs unpack the genre a bit more, in particular, what it involves and why itâs used.\n\nElements of Magical Realism\n\nThe most important element of magical realism is that it blends the real world with fantastical elements. In Flames, the most obvious example is gods: gods donât exist as far as we know, but they walk among humans and play key roles in this text. Less obvious examples of fantastical elements include the wombat farm at Melaleuca (fortunately nobody actually skins wombats) as well as the Oneblood tuna and (unfortunately!) the pet seals.\n\nThe fact that these examples are narrated as perfectly normal is another element of magical realism: the author usually operates as if the fantastical elements are perfectly real. We, as readers, enter a world where the existence of these magical things is taken for granted by the characters.\n\nPurpose of Magical Realism\n\nThis blurring of the lines between real and magical is primarily supposed to suspend our disbelief: we canât really be sure whatâs real about the novelâs world and what isnât. All we know is that in many respects, it looks like our own. Within this familiar setting, Arnott lets his own imagination run wild and leaves the reader to figure out the rest. This helps to create a sense of wonder, as if these elements could be real and as magical as described.\n\nThese elements also contribute to the story in other ways: in particular, they open up new possibilities for commentary. For example, the voice of the South Esk god is used to highlight the impacts of colonialism and the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that was brought with it.\n\nOther Magical Realism Books\n\nIf youâre liking the sound of this genre and/or if you enjoyed Flames, thereâs plenty more to discover in the way of magical realism. Itâs a hallmark of Latin American literature (Isabel Allende, Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez), and itâs also been picked up in Japan by the likes of Haruki Murakami. A prominent Australian example is Carpentaria by Alexis Wright.\n\n3. Themes\n\nDeath and Grief\n\nLetâs move more closely into Flames, starting with its central theme of death and grief. Itâs what defines this central point of tension between Levi and Charlotte throughout the novel, since it starts with their divergent responses to their motherâs death (and reincarnation etc.). Their divergent responses suggest that thereâs no one way to cope with death, and their fatherâs reaction on top of that introduces further complexity: he disappears from their lives altogether, ânot want[ing] to be close to them when they [died]â. Between the three of them, there are three very different expressions of grief.\n\nBut Edith McAllister is not the only death of significance in the novel. Another standout is the passing of Karlâs seal, after which he becomes haunted by âclicksâ; he subsequently leaves tuna-hunting behind. The death of the South Esk god is also explored as causing grief, this time in the form of divine emotional outpouring, âa cloudâs sorrowâ. Arnott is thus exploring many processes of grieving, from solitude and callousness to physical and emotional labour.\n\nFamily Relationships\n\nOutside of these moments of grieving, Arnott explores the background relationships between family members as well. Again, Levi and Charlotte are central to this. As siblings, they donât always see eye to eye: âLevi and I have never understood each otherâ. However, that does not diminish their love for each other, particularly as they were left alone after their motherâs death. Their father Jack again makes this dynamic more complicated: he sees an âunbridgeable gapâ between himself and Levi for example, but the omniscient third-person narrator in that chapter knows otherwise. Consider what difference it makes when Arnott writes in first person from within these relationships (as he does with Charlotte) versus when he writes in third person, observing from outside.\n\nWe also see interesting relationships between Karl and his daughter Nicola. Unlike the McAllisters, the two of them are remarkably close despite his ongoing grief for his seal: ânothing could match the blaze of love in her fatherâs smileâ.\n\nRomantic Relationships\n\nNicola crops up again under this theme, as she begins to navigate a relationship with Charlotte. In a book review for The Guardian, Sam Jordison argues that this is a bit trite, but we can think of it as one perspective on how relationships begin: organically and sincerely, and out of a desire to protect someone else. By contrast, the start of Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on something more artificial and manipulative, a âtiny sparkâ which he ignited in her mind.\n\nThis is bookended with romantic relationships that have come to an end, as explored through the eyes of the private investigator: her and her ex-husband, Graham Malik, have settled into something of an âecosystemâ. With these various beginnings and endings, Arnott shows how it can be natural - or supernatural - to fall in and out of love.\n\nColonisation\n\nFinally, this novel touches on the impacts of colonisation. Itâs a few quiet allusions here and there, but they are important: Arnott acknowledges the impact of colonisation on the natural landscape of his birthplace. He does this firstly through the eyes of the South Esk god, who observes the âfoul industriesâ of the âloud, pale apesâ when they first arrived on palawa and pakana land, the land we now know as Tasmania.\n\nArnott also explores colonisation through the eyes of Jack, who experiences racism when taking on the human form of an Aboriginal person. He wanted to learn more about how European colonisers were using fire, but he found âthey reacted poorly to his dark appearanceâ. Meanwhile, First Nations people in Tasmania were being âhunted in their own homelandâ, and he chooses not to intervene.\n\nAs immortal outside observers, their perspectives are the only ones in the novel that can really trace this history. Arnott might be including them so readers take his descriptions of nature with a grain of salt: even as we appreciate Australiaâs beautiful landscape, itâs worth acknowledging its custodians who have kept it that way for tens of thousands of years.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nSupernatural Creatures\n\nWeâve traced the major purposes of these deities already, but to reiterate them here these âgodsâ symbolise different parts of nature and the wonder Arnott derives from them. Although nature is already alive, these figures help it feel even more so. They also serve the important purpose of highlighting and acknowledging Tasmaniaâs colonial history, as well as the disconnect between humankind and nature.\n\nWater\n\nThe one natural element worth discussing as its own symbol is water. There are many bodies of water identified in the novel, from rivers and lakes to the ocean, and they each have their own significance. For example, rivers connect parts of the natural landscape while lakes (particularly Crater Lake) represent a getaway, solace, solitude and peace.\n\nThe ocean is the most complex of these symbols though: itâs all around the island of Tasmania, and it appears to be a vicious and unforgiving place filled with orcas and tunas the size of âmountainsâ. But itâs also a place that brings calm to Edith and Charlotte, and even Levi as a child. Arnott canvasses all of these different relationships to nature through the different manifestations of water. Water even exists as rain, which in the novelâs denouement represents a new beginning, a washing away of past tensions and conflicts.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nLevi\n\nâMy sister is struggling to cope with the lossâ¦I cannot allow her pain to continue.â\n\nâThey (Levi and Jack) were so alikeâÂ\n\nCharlotte\n\nâThe tears were flames, and they were coming from within Charlotte.â\n\nâLevi and I have never understood each otherâÂ\n\nGods\n\nâSome wore fur and feathers and watched over the creatures they resembledâ¦ Some, like a blood-hungry bird spirit he encountered deep in the southwest, were cruel. Most were calm, seeking only to care for the creatures and land that they felt drawn closest to.â\n\nâHe (the South Esk god) continued on, soothing his rage in a simple, humble way - by nipping screws out of the hull of an idle jetskiâ\n\nâLiving with humans did not workâ\n\n6.

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhen talking about the genre of this text, weâll definitely need to discuss magical realism. The question here is about how magical realism enriches or contributes to the story, so it might be worth breaking down the elements of magical realism and thinking through each of them one-by-one. The fact that this prompt is framed as a âhowâ question (one of the 5 types of essay questions) also means weâll have to bring in Arnott and how he chooses to tell the story.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nOne magical realism element Arnott adopts is the gods, who play a few roles symbolically in the novel, but there are other elements too: the seals, the flames, the cormorants and so on. Do these elements add as much as the gods, and if so, what are they adding?\n\nConsider also not just the elements as they appear, but also how Arnott is treating them. The fact that a lot of them are taken for granted as perfectly normal is in itself another genre element.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nInstead of talking about the elements too disparately or separately, I think a lot of them revolve around this central question of how humans relate to the earth and to one another. This will help connect my ideas to one another.\n\nParagraph 1: Elements of magical realism show how humans adversely impact nature\n\nNature is a huge part of the story: around the island, we see everything from beaches and rivers to âundulating moorlands of peat and buttongrassâ. Sometimes, these elements are personified as deities (e.g. South Esk god) â this is where genre comes in, since these deities are supernatural or âmagicalâ, though they are written to exist in our world.\n\nThese voices, made possible by magical realism, highlight the impact of human industry on the environment: for example the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that seeps into Tasmaniaâs waterways.\n\nEven Jack and Edithâs relationship could be seen as a metaphorical take on our incompatibility with nature: âliving with humans did not workâ.\n\nParagraph 2: At the same time, not all humans contribute equally to this pollution, and magical elements also facilitate commentary on this perspective\n\nBefore European colonisers arrived in Australia, the land had been tended to by the First Nations peoples for over 60,000 years - and pollution had been minimal. We cannot blame the entire human race equally for the deteriorating natural environment (see this Instagram post for an explanation!).\n\nThis is pointed out by the South Esk god: it is the âpale apesâ who are trying to âswamp[] over everythingâ.\n\nJack, the deity of flame, also recognises this, although he is far more complicit: âhe liked learning from the pale people more than he wanted to helpâ Aboriginal people.\n\nMagical realism adds this historical and political dimension to the narrative.\n\nParagraph 3: However, Arnottâs use of magical realism also shows possibilities for âidealâ relationships between humans, and between humans and nature\n\nThis paragraph gets to draw on some examples that arenât just the deities: the seals for example coexist really poetically with humans, âthe half of themselves they had been born withoutâ (these were inspired by dogs, by the way).\n\nPlus, even though Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on a lie, Arnott is able to use that as a point of contrast for the relationship between Charlotte and Nicola, born from Nicolaâs âdesire to helpâ, plus her âfast and firmâ attraction to Charlotte. This relationship is highly organic, and the âmagicalâ relationship between Charlotteâs parents proves a useful foil.\n\nEven thoug"
