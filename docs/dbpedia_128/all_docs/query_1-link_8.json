It is also one of the first portrayals of homosexuals on screen, including a scene in a gay bar.[2][3] The film's copyright was renewed, and the film will enter the public domain in 2028.[a]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nA wild young woman, Nasa Springer, born and raised in Texas by well-to-do parents, rebels against her father. She is sent to school in Chicago, where her disruptive behavior marks her as a troublemaker. She marries a rich playboy, who then declares the marriage a ploy and abandons her. She is renounced by her father, who tells her he never wishes to see her again. She discovers she is pregnant and bears a child. Reduced to poverty, she moves into a boardinghouse with her infant, and struggles to pay for the baby's basic needs. Unaware that her grandfather in Texas has died and left her a $100,000 fortune, a desperate Nasa dresses up as a prostitute and goes out in the neighborhood hoping to earn some quick cash to purchase medicine for her child. While she is out, a drunken lout at the boardinghouse drops a match and accidentally sets the building on fire. Nasa's infant is killed in the blaze.\n\nUpon learning that her mother is dying, she hurries home to Texas. There she learns that she is a \"half-breed\", half white and half Indian. The assertion is made that this explains why she had always been \"untameable and wild.\" This knowledge of her lineage would supposedly allow her the possibility for happiness in the arms of a handsome young \"half-breed\" Indian named Moonglow, a longtime friend who has secretly loved her.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nClara Bow as Nasa Springer\n\nGilbert Roland as Moonglow\n\nThelma Todd as Sunny De Lane\n\nMonroe Owsley as Lawrence Crosby\n\nEstelle Taylor as Ruth Springer\n\nWeldon Heyburn as Ronasa\n\nWillard Robertson as Pete Springer\n\nAnthony Jowitt as Jay Randall\n\nFred Kohler as Silas Jennings\n\nRussell Simpson as Old Man in Wagon Train\n\nMargaret Livingston as Molly\n\nCarl Stockdale as Mort\n\nDorothy Peterson as Silas' Wife\n\nMarilyn Knowlden as Ruth (as a girl)\n\nDouglas Haig (uncredited) as Pete (as a boy)[4]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Film Daily praised Bow's performance, writing \"Looking like a million dollars, acting better than she ever did, and playing a role that requires her to pretty near run the gamut of feminine moods and modes, Clara Bow makes a whirlwind comeback.\"[5]\n\nThe film attracted an audience of over 900,000 when it was showcased in 42 first-run cities.[6]\n\nPreservation status\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was restored in 2012 by the Museum of Modern Art and premiered at the third annual Turner Classic Movies Film Festival in Hollywood.[7]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
