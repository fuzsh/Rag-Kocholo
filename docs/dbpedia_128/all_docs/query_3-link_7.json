        "text": "This is a list of films condemned by the National Legion of Decency, a United States Catholic organization. The National Legion of Decency was established in 1933 and reorganized in 1965 as the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures (NCOMP). Under each of these names, it rated films according to their suitability for viewing, assigning a code of A, B, or C, with that of C identified as \"Condemned\" for viewing by Catholics. The C rating was issued from 1933 until 1978. The Legion's ratings were applied to movies made in the United States as well as those imported from other countries. Since it reviewed films when released for distribution, the Legion usually rated non-U.S. films a few years after their first release in their country of origin, occasionally years after. For example, it rated Marcel Pagnol's 1936 César in 1948 and Marlene Dietrich's 1930 The Blue Angel in 1950.\n\nThe rating system was revised in 1978 and the designation \"condemned\" has not been assigned to films since then. Instead, films that would earlier have been rated C or B were all rated O, which meant \"morally offensive\". NCOMP reassigned ratings to old films based on its new system, making it impossible to determine from their own database whether a film it now classifies O was originally B or C.[1] In 1980, NCOMP ceased operations, along with the biweekly Review, which by then had published ratings for 16,251 feature films.\n\nLegion-organized boycotts made a C rating harmful to a film's distribution and profitability. In some periods the Legion's aim was to threaten producers with a C rating, demand revisions, and then award a revised B rating. At other times the Legion, preferring to avoid the notoriety and publicity that films gained from having a C rating revised to B, refused to remove their original rating, which resulted in industry self-censorship that achieved the Legion's aims with less public conflict. For example, Elia Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire was cut by 4 minutes to avoid a C rating,[2] and Billy Wilder cut scenes from the original play to avoid a C for The Seven Year Itch. Spartacus underwent similar editing to avoid a C rating.[3]\n\nMost condemned films were made outside of the studio system, being either exploitation films produced by Poverty Row studios or movies made outside the United States for audiences that were principally non-American and non-English speaking, often distributed by exploitation presenters.[a] Of the 53 movies the Legion had placed on its condemned list by 1943, only Howard Hughes' The Outlaw was the product of a major U.S. studio and it would not receive a wide release until 1946.[citation needed] After The Moon is Blue (1953) and Baby Doll (1956) received C ratings, it was a decade before two more major Hollywood movies received the C rating: The Pawnbroker (1964) and Kiss Me, Stupid (1964).[5]\n\nFilms are often reported to have been condemned in general terms, that is, they were criticized or even denounced, when they did not receive the Legion's C rating. Some rely on a list of films that were condemned early in the 1930s by the Archdiocese of Chicago in advance of the Legion of Decency's rating system,[6][b] Turner Classic Movies, for example, has programmed a festival of \"Movies Condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency\" that included several that were not rated C by the Legion.[8][c]\n\n1936\n\n[edit]\n\nAdolf Strongarm, a Swedish import (Adolf Armstarke).[10]\n\nExtase or Ecstasy (1933), an import from Czechoslovakia.[10]\n\nElysia (1933), an exploitation pseudo-documentary about nudism by Bryan Foy[10]\n\nLes Amours de Toni (1935), a French import directed by Jean Renoir.[10]\n\nCarnival in Flanders, a French import[10]\n\nGambling with Souls, an exploitation film described by The New York Times as \"a so-called exposé of the vice racket\".[11]\n\nLiving Dangerously,[12] an English import produced by British International Pictures.\n\nPitfalls of Youth, possibly an alternative title for the exploitation film Marihuana, by Dwain Esper.[10]\n\nThe Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), an English import starring Charles Laughton.[12][10]\n\nWhirlpool of Desire, a French import originally titled Remous.[10]\n\n1937\n\n[edit]\n\nAssassin of Youth, an exploitation film about marijuana.[10]\n\nClub de femmes (1936), a French import.[10]\n\nDamaged Goods, an exploitation film released by Grand National Films Inc., a minor producer-distributor that operated from 1936–1939.
