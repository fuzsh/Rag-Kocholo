        "text": "„ÄêThe Evolution of the English Over 1,000 Years„Äë The evolution of the English language over a 1,000-year time span traces back to the 5th century when England was invaded by different tribes, including the Angles, Jutes, Saxons, and Frisians. Their languages produced what we know today as Anglo-Saxon or Old English, which sounded similar to German. In the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, invasions by the Vikings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden brought another form of the same Germanic language, Old Norse, which mixed with Old English. In the year 1066, French forces led by William the Conqueror conquered England. Over the next 300 years, thousands of French words entered the English language, especially those related to governance and food. During the English Renaissance, many Latin-based words also entered the language, partly due to English poets, writers, and playwrights. Shakespeare, for instance, wrote plays set in Italy, such as \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"The Merchant of Venice,\" and \"Julius Caesar.\" By the mid-1500s, a modern-day English speaker would be able to communicate with some patience and concentration. While there would be some archaic pronunciations, shifting meanings, and evolving figures of speech, the language overall would be recognizable. The English language has evolved significantly over the last 1000 years. This is due to a number of factors, including: Contact with other languages: English has borrowed heavily from other languages throughout its history. Some of the most significant influences have come from French, Latin, and Old Norse. Sound changes: English has undergone a number of sound changes over time. For example, the Great Vowel Shift, which took place in the 15th and 16th centuries, caused many long vowels to change their pronunciation. Changes in grammar and vocabulary: English grammar and vocabulary have also changed over time. For example, the use of the second person plural pronoun \"you\" to address a single individual became common in the 17th century. Here are some specific examples of how English has evolved over the last 1000 years: Old English (c. 450-1100): Old English was the language spoken in England before the Norman Conquest of 1066. It was a very different language from modern English, with a complex grammar and a very different vocabulary. Middle English (c. 1100-1500): Middle English was the language spoken in England after the Norman Conquest. It was a period of great change for the English language, as it was influenced by the Norman French language. Early Modern English (c. 1500-1700): Early Modern English was the language spoken during the Renaissance and the Elizabethan era. It was during this period that the Great Vowel Shift took place, and the language began to take on a more modern form. Modern English (c. 1700-present): Modern English is the language spoken today. It is a global language, spoken by people all over the world.\n\nDay 1406: How did American English become different from British English?? The United States and the United Kingdom share the same language, English‚Ä¶ formed over many hundreds of years, with its start as Old English (which is mostly unintelligible with modern English) to its modern equivalent. Playwright George Bernard Shaw once said that the US and UK are ‚Äútwo countries divided by a common language‚Äù and Oscar Wilde, the famous playwright, and poet, said, ‚ÄúWe have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language‚Äù. These quotes are reminders of the differences between the two countries‚Äô varieties of English. How did they become different if the language they spoke started in the same place? The main reason for the difference in English between these two nations is how English evolved, as at one point they would speak English exactly the same way. American English is based upon late 17th century English brought from the UK by the first settlers to the thirteen colonies that later became the United States of America. American English preserves certain features of the language that were not retained in British English. Another reason for differences in English between these countries is the vocabulary, as American English colonists borrowed names for the new unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from Native American languages with examples such as ‚Äúraccoon‚Äù, ‚Äúmoose‚Äù, and ‚Äúmoccasin‚Äù. As America is a nation of immigrants and its colonial period saw interest from the Spanish and French as well as the British, it has many loanwords from many other languages and groups of people. Spanish and German are the most common origin languages for American English loanwords along with Dutch and a few other languages. The word ‚Äúcookie‚Äù came from Dutch, the word ‚Äúkindergarten‚Äù from German and the word ‚Äúcilantro‚Äù from Spanish. A key component of any language is its written form, and this is where American English and British English deviate most heavily. This is due to the first dictionaries in both countries being written by two different authors with two different perspectives on language. The British dictionary was put together in London by scholars who just wanted to collect all known English words. The American dictionary was put together by lexicographer Noah Webster, who wanted spelling to be more straightforward and better reflect the pronunciation of words. One theory is that he wanted American spellings to differ from British spellings as a way of showing independence. Another theory is that because newspapers charged for how much space an ad took up on the page, so the more economical spelling was always preferred in the US. Some examples of different spellings include the dropping of the ‚Äúu‚Äù in various worlds like ‚Äúcolour‚Äù and ‚Äúhonour‚Äù which changed to ‚Äúcolor‚Äù and ‚Äúhonor‚Äù or the dropped ‚Äúe‚Äù in ‚Äújudgement,‚Äù which is spelled ‚Äújudgment‚Äù in American English. #learnonethingaday\n\nüëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏èBetween languagesüëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è A few days ago, I had a conversation with one of my Greek-American family members. I hadn't seen them in a while due to Covid. They asked me \"So now you speak better French than English?\" and I immediately replied \"No, of course I don't\". The realization that my French-language skills, even though completely fluent, \"perfect\", near-native and all that, will never be enough hit me like a rock. I do not have an American passport. I have an American nickname I rarely use. I have spent months, years, trying to speak English with a Greek accent, deliberately making mistakes, in order to blend in or because my accent was \"wrong\" or \"weird\", according to my peers. I was never the brightest in the language school where I took English lessons. My teachers laughed at me for using \"wicked\" as an adverb. I couldn't translate words from English to Greek and the other way around (and I still can't, in any language; I use the dictionaryüîé). But I did read Jane Austen's works in English by the time I was 9 years old. In high school I could recite poems by Walt Whitman and T.S.Eliot and was fixed on studying English and American Literature in college. I once went to a foundation that grants scholarships for studies in the States and the consultant was impressed: \"But, you're a native speaker!\" they exclaimed. \"You should definitely apply\". My family didn't have money, not even for the application process. So, I became fluent in French instead, studied in France, conducted research in French, fell in love in French, built a routine in French, learned words in French that I have no idea how they sound in either Greek or English. Still, dreaming in French is hard at times. Dreaming in English is natural and fluid. But I have never lived in any English-speaking country. I don't know everyday words, I don't have a routine in English. I only have bits and pieces from regional accents and half-Greek half-American thinking processes. How can this be? Should I put on \"fluent\" or \"bilingual\" on my resum√©? Then, I realize: I am not the only one. Many people my age, in their late 20s or early 30s, have fled Greece, lived and worked in other countries, maybe have a double citizenship by now, work almost exclusively in English, never dream of writing their CVs in another language; we are, in fact, all ‚ú®bilingual‚ú®. My generation grew up amidst the financial crisis that hit Greece especially hard. We had to adapt, we had to learn new skills, and get accustomed to the fact that home no longer meant a physical space but rather a spiritual state in between moving, packing, unpacking, sending out resum√©s, learning yet another language, being constantly on the move. Maybe that's why yoga is so popular among Millennials, Zillennials and Zoomers. It's an affirmation that our lives can never be similar to the lives of our parents and grand-parents, that we will be fl√¢neurs and fl√¢neuses forever. Maybe the very same thing applies to languages.üßòüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nLinkedIn Post on Spanish Language Myths üö´ Debunking Common Myths About the Spanish Language üö´ Spanish is a beautiful and complex language spoken by over 500 million people worldwide. However, there are several myths and misconceptions that can hinder a true appreciation of its richness. Let‚Äôs clear up some of these myths: 1. Spanish is the same everywhereüåç - Reality: Spanish varies greatly between countries and even regions. Accents, slang, and vocabulary can differ, making each variant unique and culturally rich. 2. **\"Spanish is easy to learn\"** üìö - Reality: While Spanish has some straightforward aspects, such as phonetic spelling, it also has complex grammar rules, verb conjugations, and idiomatic expressions that can be challenging for learners. 3. **\"All Spanish speakers are fluent in Castilian Spanish\"** üá™üá∏ - Reality: Castilian Spanish is just one of many dialects. In Latin America, different countries have their own regional varieties, each with distinct characteristics and linguistic nuances. 4. **\"Spanish is just a simplified version of Latin\"** üèõÔ∏è - Reality: While Spanish evolved from Latin, it has been influenced by Arabic, indigenous languages, and other Romance languages over centuries, creating a unique and rich linguistic tapestry. 5. **\"If you know Spanish, you can easily understand Portuguese\"** üá™üá∏üáµüáπ - Reality: While Spanish and Portuguese share similarities due to their Latin roots, they are distinct languages with different phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar. Understanding one doesn‚Äôt guarantee fluency in the other. Embracing these realities helps us appreciate the depth and diversity of the Spanish language. Whether you‚Äôre learning Spanish or simply interested in languages, recognizing these myths can lead to a more informed and respectful understanding. #SpanishLanguage #LanguageMyths #CulturalDiversity #LanguageLearning\n\nIn my last year before university, I changed high schools. On the first day, my form tutor (and English teacher) asked another classmate and me which school we came from. When she found out, she told us: ‚ÄîPhew, we will see how it goes with English. ‚ÄîWhy? ‚ÄîBecause the level at your school is not very good. üò∂ üëâ At the end of that year academy, I passed my English exam to enter the Degree of Translation and Interpreting at the University of Granada. üëâ I finished my studies, worked as a translator, and, nowadays, can communicate in English \"despite\" my school. Sometimes, you don‚Äôt have the best circumstances to succeed, and you make it. Sometimes, the resistance comes from inside. What are you telling yourself? You‚Äôre not good enough in languages? ‚ùå You‚Äôre too old to learn? ‚ùå Whatever you say to yourself, you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs up to you. But as the quote from Einstein in the picture says, if you always do the same, you will get the same results. My recommendation: ‚úãChange the way you talk to yourself. üëç Include the language you want to learn in your daily life. Watch videos in Spanish in YT, or listen to podcasts, or read in Spanish. 10-15 minutes a day will make a big difference. You can also subscribe to my newsletter. There you will find funny stories in Spanish and learn colloquial expressions. The link is in my profile.

I was very lucky, I think, because my approach to languages never required a lot of work. My mother is Brazilian, my father Italian and I grew up in the US, so straight off the bat I learned to speak three languages. üá∫üá∏üáÆüáπüáßüá∑ Of the three, I feel like English is my strongest, as most (but not all) of my schooling was in English, and Portuguese my weakest because my mom‚Äôs Italian was more fluent than my dad‚Äôs Portuguese so we ended up speaking mostly Italian at home (although for some reason we got yelled at in Portuguese üòÇ). Spanish came naturally as well, I grew up in Texas, where there are many Central and South Americans, so I learned to speak and then I studied it in school, but studying the grammar and syntax of a language you already speak is miles easier than learning it from scratch. üá≤üáΩ At a certain point, my parents, uncertain of where we would end up leaving the US decided to put us in a French school, the reasoning being that at the time there were French schools all over the world so it would be convenient. üá´üá∑ It was a sink or swim approach to language learning, I started the sixth grade (sixi√®me) not speaking a word of French, and I ended up completely fluent. Or rather, I could write a perfect dissertation on Voltaire in French, but the humdrum, every day, ordering at a restaurant or grocery shopping was lacking because it turns out you don‚Äôt actually learn names of foods and very basic vocabulary in middle and high school anymore. A few stints in France solved that issue though. I‚Äôm now studying Russian, from the basics, like a normal person‚Ä¶ and boy, it‚Äôs hard! It‚Äôs making me realize how easy I had it! üá∑üá∫ But enough about me, how did you learn the languages you speak? And are there more you want to take on? Let‚Äôs connect!

I was recently told that no person would embark on learning languages just because, or just to be able to read a book in its original language. üò≥ This opinion truly shocked me. I've been learning languages my whole life, since I started school when I was three years old. I've learned four foreign languages so far, and currently studying two more. üòç I feel profound fulfillment when I get to understand another part of the world population. Yes, I'm a translator, sure, it helps me generating an income, but my true motivation is understanding people, understanding why someone acts the way they act, and being able to help them. üíõ Am I being naive? It has also been a great tool for me as a Spanish teacher for foreigners because I understand people's cosmovision, hence, I'm able to explain in their terms Spanish culture. üá≤üáΩ So, tell me, what does it mean for you acquiring another language. What's the motivation behind? #loveforlanguages #translatorlife #languagegeek\n\nüéâFUN FACTS ABOUT SPANISH LANGUAGE üéâ 1.Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world by native speakers, with over 460 million people using it as their first language. 2. Spanish is an official language in 21 countries, primarily in Latin America, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea. 3.Spanish has borrowed many words from other languages, including Arabic, due to the Moorish influence in Spain.

Share below! ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\nPTE Pills While teaching Spanish students, I've noticed a common issue regarding their speaking skills. As a linguist, I've come to understand the struggle in this aspect. First and foremost, clarity in speech is crucial. It's important not to overlap words while speaking. Yes, there are several letters and sounds in English that can be challenging for Spanish speakers due to differences in pronunciation: üí´ ‚ÄùTh\" sounds: Spanish does not have the \"th\" sound found in English words like \"think\" or \"this.\" It can be challenging for Spanish speakers to produce this sound accurately. üí´ Vowel sounds: English has a more comprehensive range of vowel sounds than Spanish, leading to difficulty in distinguishing and producing them accurately. For example, the \"ee\" sound in \"sheep\" or the \"i\" sound in \"bit\" may be challenging. üí´ The \"sh\" sound in English, as in words like \"shoe\" or \"sheep,\" can indeed be challenging for Spanish speakers. In Spanish, there isn't an equivalent sound, so it's not a familiar sound for speakers to produce. They might initially substitute it with a similar sound from Spanish, such as \"ch\" or \"s,\" which can affect their pronunciation accuracy in English. üí´ Consonant clusters: English words often contain consonant clusters that are uncommon or absent in Spanish, such as \"strength\" or \"twelve.\" Spanish speakers may find it challenging to pronounce these combinations fluently. üí´ \"R\" sound: The pronunciation of the letter \"r\" in English can vary significantly from the rolled \"r\" sound in Spanish. Spanish speakers may struggle to produce the English \"r\" sound correctly. üí´ Stress patterns: English has a stress-timed rhythm, whereas Spanish has a syllable-timed rhythm. This difference in stress patterns can affect how Spanish speakers pronounce words and sentences in English. By focusing on these specific sounds and practicing them regularly, Spanish speakers can improve their pronunciation and fluency in English.
