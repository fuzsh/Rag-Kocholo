        "text": "Implicit meaning relates to the meaning of a scene, while explicit meaning focuses on what is happening at the surface of the scene. These terms relate to onions because ogres, like onions, are made of layers. Every single moment in film art has different layers of meaning, which can be either implicit or explicit. No matter how many different layers of meaning are in a movie, each layer is either implicit or explicit. These terms relate to Fruitvale Station, as the movies explicit meaning is considered to simply be a man trying to make ends meet after getting out of jail, while the implicit meaning is the difficulty of being a African-American male with a criminal record, and how the odds are stacked against him due to his race.\n\nFormal analysis is an analytical approach primarily concerned with film form, or the means by which a subject is expressed. It differs from other types of analyses as these alternative approaches analyze movies more as cultural artifacts than as traditional works of art.\n\n1.) They search beneath a movie's form and content to expose implicit and hidden meaning that inform our understanding of cinema's function within popular culture as well as the influence of popular culture on the movies.\n\n→ The preceding formal analysis demonstrated how Juno used cinematic language to convey meaning and tell a story\n\n→ Given the right interpretive scrutiny, our case study film may also speak eloquently about social conditions and attitudes. For example, considering that the protagonist is the daughter of an air-conditioner repairman and a manicurist, and that the couple she selects to adopt her baby are white-collar professionals, a cultural analysis of Juno could explore the movie's treatment of class\n\n→ An analysis from a feminist perspective could concentrate on, among other elements, the movie's depiction of women and childbirth, not to mention Juno's father, the father of her baby, and the prospective adoptive father\n\n→ A linguistic analysis might explore the historical, cultural, or imaginary organs of the highly stylized slang spouted by Juno, her friends, and even the mini-mart clerk. A thesis could be written about the implication of the T-shirt messages displayed by the film's characters or the implicit meaning of the movie's track and field motif\n\n→ Some analyses place movies within the stylistic or political context of a directors career\n\n→ Another comparative analysis could investigate society's evolving (or perhaps fixed) attitudes toward \"illegitimate\" pregnancy by placing Juno in context with the long history of films about the subject\n\nAn analytical approach primarily concerned with film form, or the means by which a subject is expressed. It dissects the complex synthesis of cinematography, sound, composition, design, movement, performance, and editing orchestrated by creative artists such as screenwriters, directors, cinematographers, actors, editors, sound designers, and art directors as well as the many craftspeople who implement their vision.\n\n1.) The movie meaning expressed through form ranges from narrative information as straight forward as where and when a particular scene takes place, to more subtle implied meaning, such as mood, tone, significance, or what a character is thinking or feeling\n\n2.) Cinematic storytellers exploit every tool at their disposal and that, therefore, every element in every frame is there for a reason. It is the analyst's job to carefully consider the narrative intent of the moment, scene, or sequence before attempting any interpretation of the formal elements used to communicate that intended meaning to the spectator\n\nYou do not have to agree with the meaning or values projected by the object of your analysis; you can learn even from a movie you dislike\n\nUnlike photography or painting, films are constructed from individual shots - an unbroken span of action captured by an uninterrupted run of a motion-picture camera - that allow visual elements to rearrange themselves and the viewer's perspective itself to shift within any composition.\n\n1.) A movies movement extends beyond any single shot because movies are constructed of multiple individual shots joined to one another in an extended sequence. With each transition from one shot to another, a movie is able to move the viewer through time and space\n\nWhen such a transition is meant to covey a passage of time between scenes, the last shot of a scene grows gradually darker (fades out) until the screen is rendered black for a moment. The first shot of the subsequent scene then fades in out of the darkness.\n\n1.) Viewers do not have to think about what this means; our daily experience of time's passage marked by the setting and rising of the sun lets us understand intuitively that significant story time has elapsed over that brief moment of screen darkness\n\nOne of the most common editing techniques designed to hide the instantaneous and potentially jarring shift from one camera viewpoint to another. When connecting one shot to the next, a film editor often ends the first shot in the middle of a continuing action and starts the connecting shot at some point in the same action. As a result, the action flows so continuously over the cut between different moving images that most viewers fail to register the switch."
