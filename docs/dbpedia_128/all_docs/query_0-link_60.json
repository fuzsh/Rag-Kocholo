        "text": "✍ I read an article this month about some female Latin Spanish speakers living in the US and being on the receiving end of micro and macro aggressions for their cultural and linguistic background. 👶 It reminded me of a micro aggression/incivility I received when teaching in Peru. One of my colleagues told me that I sounded like a baby when I spoke Spanish. Even my nephew who lives in Spain was mimicking my English accent! 💬 It does trigger something in me but luckily it doesn’t stop me from speaking because I would rather be fluent than have the perfect accent. I didn’t grow up in a Spanish speaking country, I am not bilingual, I’m not one of those lucky people who can pick up accents seamlessly but I do have a C1 Advanced level and speak Spanish fluently. 👩🎓 I have taught students who were eager to speak English even though they made mistakes and others who wouldn’t speak for fear of making mistakes. Being an English language Teacher, I had to practise what I preached and speak Spanish without worrying about mistakes or my accent; otherwise I wouldn’t have obtained the level I have now. 😔 I have had many students apologising for their accent and of course I told them, that as long as I can understand what they are saying, then their accent doesn’t matter. For me personally, I concentrate on what a person is saying to me, I listen to understand and don’t focus on their accent. 🌐 In our globalised world, it's important to recognise that fluency, the ability to effectively communicate and convey ideas, should take precedence over achieving the perfect accent. 🌉 While perfecting an accent can be enjoyable and culturally enriching, fluency ensures effective communication, allowing us to bridge gaps and facilitate meaningful connections with others and achieve cross-cultural understanding. ❓ Have you had a similar experience when speaking another language or even speaking your first language in your own country? #fluencyoveraccent #effectivecommunication #crossculturalcommunicationskills #languagelearning 🧡 I am Yasmin from Joy of Communication and I help global teams and global customer service teams communicate more effectively and inclusively across cultures.\n\nI was asked to create this video, because I like languages and I like to play with accents. So let's see what I can do here: Languages: 🇬🇧 - As you can hear I speak English and I use English everyday all day at work. 🇮🇹 - I also speak Italian - I've been living in Italy for 17 years now, so even though I've never studied it, I think I speak Italian quite correctly. 🇨🇿 - I also speak Czech - I'm Czech, so of course I speak and understand Czech very well. 🇸🇰 - I was born in Czechoslovakia - of course I speak Slovak as well! 🇵🇱 - I don't speak perfectly, but I understand Polish very well, because I grew up watching fairytales and movies in Polish. 🇷🇺 - I also speak some Russian, because I used to study this language at school, but this was more than 25 years ago. Apart of these languages, I also know some words and phrases in 🇪🇦 Spanish, 🇫🇷 French, 🇬🇷G reek and 🇩🇪 German. And now the funny part: Accents: 🇬🇧🇺🇸 - So, I think that I'm kinda good in speaking English with American accent, and.. between you and me \"American cookies are way better than English biscuits\". 🇬🇧🇬🇧 - Even though, my favorite accent is the British one, because I prefer to say \"A bottle of water\" instead of \"A bottle of water\". 🇬🇧🇮🇳 - Let me tell you something: Basically, I can speak English with Indian accent. And practically, my Indian friends told me that I've really mastered it. 🇬🇧🇩🇪 - Also, this is my German accent, and I think it is very good. Super yeah. 🇬🇧🇫🇷 - Unfortunately my French accent is terrific, so let's turn the page... 🇮🇹🇷🇺 - Oh I forgot, sorry everyone. I can speak Italian with strong Russian accent. 😜 #languages #accents #english #italian #czech #slovak #polish #russian #spanish #french #greek #german #americanaccent #britishaccent #frenchaccent #germanaccent #indianaccent #russianaccent\n\n\" I was not born in France or the UK, so I can never sound like a native.\" Does this ever resonate with you? Like most non-native speakers out there, who grew up learning English as a second or foreign language, never have I realised that having a native American/British accent would mean as much to me as I would speak my mother tongue. However hard I have tried, my accent could never measure up to a standard native accent. Most of us grew up speaking with an accent; although some of us give our best shot to immitate native speakers, it dawns on us at some point that our native accents are here to stay. Likewise, we dream about picking up an accent, but does accent really matter when speaking a foreign language? When it's time to speak up, we tend freeze up out of fear that people will scoff at our accent. But In reality, most native speakers do not care how you sound, as long as you are being understood. First and foremost, it's not just about sounding quintessentially native, but also getting your message across easily and clearly in every situations. Whenever we are mortified about speaking up because of your accent, we must remember that our accent makes us unique. \"When a person speaks with an accent, it means he can speak one language more than you\" - Fernando Lamas\n\nOn Being a Language Concierge What is a language concierge? I recently had the honor of interpreting German to English and English to German for a beautiful couple’s family attending their son’s wedding in the States. It was the family’s first time in the U.S., and the couple wanted to ensure that they were fully included in everything. How does it work? What did it consist of? When they first reached out, I thought they were requesting a translation of the ceremony. When we discussed their wedding, though, it became apparent that what they really wanted was a bilingual facilitator. They wanted to help their family avoid feeling awkward and they wanted to spontaneously share their joy with the entire family! What did they need? The trickiest part was figuring out what was needed. When you encounter a situation for the first time, you most likely don’t know what you need. Ask us—we can help. As always, if we’re not able to help, we most likely know someone who can. When do you need a language concierge? Do you have German- or French-speaking visitors, corporate representatives, maybe friends or family attending an event with you or given by you? Are you unsure how well they understand or can be understood? What about them? Are THEY unsure of their ability to understand or be understood? Sometimes all people need is the security of knowing there is someone troubleshooting for them. Other people relax when they know they are being looked after. Just knowing their needs will be met might be all it takes to change that 'maybe' attending to a 'definitely' attending! But they studied English for 37 years! Yeah, I know. Everybody else got raised with 2-9 languages in infancy. As they say in French, tant pis (it does NOT sound like it looks!) There are many, many people who studied something intensely for years only to forget it. Ask me about my Math skills someday. (Better yet, ask anybody I helped with their 2nd Grade Math homework!) Someone may have an excellent command of written English, for example, but feel overwhelmed by the demands of speaking it. Think about how difficult it can be for non-native English speakers to make themselves understood. Then there are people who master English, but have difficulties understanding different regionalisms. When you are conducting a higher level meeting, the importance of interpreting the subtext of the conversation should not be ignored. Some of the most brilliant people struggle with verbal communication in their native language. Do you need a language concierge for an upcoming event? Do you have a friend or coworker who needs language help? How can we help make your next event smoother than a slippery baby in a bubble bath? Tell us! #interpreter #translator #germanlanguage\n\nThere are double standards when it comes to speaking different languages in the workplace. I have had students tell me that they have been asked to speak slower in their native language but the same opportunity wasn't given to them when they attended an English meeting. My client, a native Spanish speaker, attended a meeting conducted in Spanish. In the beginning, she was asked to speak slowly for the benefit of non-native Spanish speakers. However, in a subsequent meeting conducted in English, no similar request was made to accommodate non-native English speakers. This disparity raises important questions about language equity in international business environments. 🔸 Why It Matters: In multilingual settings, it’s crucial to ensure that all participants, regardless of their native language, feel equally heard and understood. Language accommodation shouldn’t be a one-way street. It’s about creating an inclusive atmosphere where everyone, irrespective of their language proficiency, can contribute effectively. 🌟 What Can You Do? If you notice a double standard, consider bringing it up diplomatically. For instance, \"I noticed we slowed down for non-native Spanish speakers, which is great. Could we consider doing the same in English sessions for non-native speakers?\" Encourage meeting facilitators to set inclusive language guidelines. This might include speaking at a moderate pace or using simpler vocabulary in multilingual settings. If you’re a native speaker of any language, consciously moderate your speed and clarity to set an example for others. Creating a balanced and inclusive environment in multilingual meetings is essential for effective international collaboration. By acknowledging and addressing these double standards, we foster a more inclusive and respectful global business culture. #MultilingualWorkplace #Inclusivity #GlobalBusiness #EffectiveCommunication\n\nI’m often around speakers of much larger European languages, so once in a while I get to witness conversations like this: Person 1: \"Where are you from?\" Person 2: \"[…]\" Person 1: \"I thought so! Because of your *accent*!\" Person 1 usually looks smug and proud of themselves. And person 2? Their smile shrinks, their facial muscles tense up, but they stay polite and mumble something. When I live in touristy places, I enjoy helping German-speaking visitors. I always recognise their accent, but I patiently wait for a clue — a phrase exchanged between them, text on a book or a map, or a chance to ask where they are travelling from. It’s because I’ve had conversations of varying quality in over 10 languages, and I hang out with people from around the world. Nobody, but really, nobody I know enjoys being told \"hey, you sound foreign!\" or \"I’ve already deciphered you and created a story about you in my head before you have a chance to say anything about yourself!\" People like to own their story. Nobody likes to be pigeonholed. Nobody enjoys knowing that you focus on how they say things rather than what they say. They tolerate this behaviour just to be polite. So why do this?\n\nAn interesting topic that came up in a recent conversation with a client: \"Should we change our accent if we are from a non-English speaking country?\" My advice has always been to focus on the clarity of the message and the confidence of delivery more than the way the message is being delivered. This is something that has consistently yielded better results than trying to force a UK / US accent. Moreover, there are several countries apart from these two falling under the \"native speaker\" category including Scotland, Ireland and Australia to name a few. And even in these countries there are several geographically centered accents that would not be considered comprehensible by many others not too far away. Having said that, the take away shouldn't be \"Say what you want, however you want it.\" We should certainly focus on proper pronunciation and phoenetic training but the reason why we speak is to convey our thoughts clearly and that comes before everything else. Check out this article by British Council related to the same topic. Let us know your thoughts on the same. https://lnkd.in/gyK8Yd9Q\n\nCan YOU become a \"native\" speaker? As a bi-lingual I am used to having a different voice, different humor, and sometimes even different reactions in my two native languages. It feels like my personality adapts when I switch languages. It is like having two separate identities that I can turn on or off. Each identity makes me feel \"at home\" in the respective culture and quickly connect to my peers on a deeper personal level than a \"foreigner\" normally can. But here's the thing: ☝️ You don't have to be a native speaker to \"feel at home\" in a culture and quickly make friends with natives and connect to them deeply! The trick is to develop a type of native fluency and cultural intelligence that make natives connect with you on a subconscious level. I was able to do just that by using my own experience as a bi-lingual and building additional \"cultural identities\" in other foreign languages. The results were life-changing. But you can do this, too, and I want to show you how. So I am looking for a few special people who want more than just communicate in a foreign language. I will help turn you into native-like speakers with a \"second identity\", starting next month. Imagine being able to directly speak with natives in their language and be embraced by them immediately as if you’re a part of their culture. If you can already have a conversation in English, French, German, or Spanish about most subjects, then this may be for you. Ready to take your language skills and cultural understanding to a new level? Then let's talk. Comment \"ready\" in your target language and I'll reach out to you. #languagemastery #frenchspeaking #spanishspeaking #germanspeaking #culturalintelligence #languagecoaching #englishcoaching #culturalawareness"
