        "text": "My succinct review of Bertrand Mandico’s She is Connan: it’s a beautifully made movie, which serves as a compelling treatise on the nature of syndicated characters and coming to terms with death.\n\nMy less succinct review: It’s a good sword and sorcery film, reinterpreting and remixing the story of how Conan went from a slave to a soldier to a king…and then a ’85 Buick LeSabre covered in silver armor drives through the afterlife and pins a woman to a rock, beginning an immortal lesbian time travel plot about immeasurable love and loss.\n\nThen it turns from a good film into an absolutely insane film you have to see to believe.\n\nA TAKE ON THE BARBARIAN LIKE YOU’VE NEVER SEEN\n\nThe story is familiar at first: when her mother is killed, Conann is taken captive by the ruthless barbarian horde and forced to become a savage warrior, determined to kill her captor, Sanja. But when the dog-headed crossroads demon Rainier takes a liking to Conann, she is set on a path of endless brutality that Rainier can’t help but document through his low-brow photography. As Conann carves a bloody trail of carnage through time and space, the woman and her dog begin to reflect on the nature of life and the death she’s wrought.\n\nA Variety interview mentioned that She is Conann was the third entry in what you could call Mandico’s “Afterlife Trilogy”, with The Wild Boys representative of Paradise, After Blue being Purgatory, and Conann Inferno. So does Mandico’s cinematography communicate this well, with its monochrome settings varying from a medieval wasteland to the Bronx in 1998, to…well, literally hell? Absolutely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBEHIND THE CAMERA, BERTRAND MANDICO CAN’T LOSE\n\nEverything about this movie just works visually, and even when its props or set design is more fitting for a theatrical production, it has a real charm to it. Its depictions of the ancient world, the rainy city streets, and art deco spaces in a deviant far future have a unique flair in their unreality. Bursts of color are saved for intermittent flashes of emotion Conann has throughout the film. A lesser director would make that feel a bit on the nose or overused, but when the technicolor strikes through, it catches you off guard and hammers home the message of what exactly is happening to Conann without having to say a word.\n\nThe film’s story and editing are much more linear than I anticipated, which means Conann’s most radical choice is the one I didn’t think much of before watching: having six different actresses portray Conann throughout her life. Movies that talk about the radical change of growing as a human rarely make a decision this bold, but Mandico gives form to the struggles of change in a simple but clever way.\n\nPERFORMANCES THAT CUT LIKE A SWORD\n\nIt’s made all the better by the fact that not a single one of the six different actresses who portray Conann fails to deliver. Every one of them is incredible and nails the role they’re given; six distinct iterations of the character, so similar yet so far apart, each with their own quirks and mannerisms that they take on as they age. Sandra Parfait, who plays Conann at age 35, is by and large my favorite: she has this air of true confidence you only see in golden age movie stars (Gene Kelly as Serafin comes to mind), and her smooth, suave performance comes through the camera effortlessly.\n\nRainier’s actress Elina Löwensohn, who also starred in the great 1994 vampire film Nadja, steals the show as Conann’s loyal lapdog of death. She makes a character you love to hate, and even more rare one you hate to like as much as you do; nasty, uncouth, and hopelessly “in love” (if you could call it love). Though stuck in heavy facial prosthetics, Löwensohn’s line delivery is so energetic and comedic timing so impeccable that it didn’t hinder her performance in the slightest.\n\nBLADES, GUNS, AND FISTS DELIVER PLENTY OF GORE\n\nAnd it’s the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival, so I need to mention that the film’s horror elements don’t disappoint. From ripping swords out of people, wounds that never quite heal, and grotesque mutations, the blood flows free like wine into Conann’s proverbial cup. That’s not to mention the existential horrors of war and all the gratuitous bloodshed that comes with it, which drives the film’s more philosophically disturbing aspects. The final set piece, which, from what I could tell, was entirely practical, is no laughing matter either. Since I can’t technically spoil it, I’ll say that between this and Cannibal Mukbang, there’s a lot to chew on this year in the SFX department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT IS BEST IN LIFE? CHANGE\n\nWhen I introduced this film in our BHFF curtain raiser, I mentioned that I was excited because I loved the Conan mythos. By the end of the film, She is Conann is an unrecognizable departure from the source of inspiration. Robert E. Howard could never have predicted his character could inspire such a radical adaptation, and that is ultimately what makes me like it.\n\nShe is Conann reads as a film made by someone who loves Conan the Barbarian but hates the mire of copyright nonsense that has kept such a beloved pop culture figure in a cage. It becomes a story about the cyclical nature of characters who aren’t allowed to truly grow into someone different, and how making the same mistakes over and over is a hell of its own. The same way no one chains Conan and lives to tell the tale, She is Conann and refuses to be limited, and that’s why you need to see it.\n\n***\n\nThis is usually the part where I would say, “Get out and go to the theatres to catch this film right now”, but this is part of our coverage of Brooklyn Horror Film Festival 2023! This is definitely a movie you want on your radar, so keep your eyes peeled for it!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who spent their formative film viewing years in the aughts, I find myself connecting to many obscure films. The weed-protecting, survivalist Jason Vorhees was my Jason. The terrifying, and killer, tooth fairy from Darkness Falls was my kindertrauma. Jared Padalecki was part of my generation’s House of Wax. It feels like I sometimes find myself obsessed with films that no one really cares to talk about nowadays. Upon finding out an overall theme for August, road trips, one film came to mind immediately: Joy Ride.\n\nLewis Thomas (Paul Walker) exchanges a plane ticket back home from college for the chance to drive his crush, Venna Wilcox (Leelee Sobieski), to their hometown in New Jersey. The only problem is that Venna lives in Colorado, while Lewis lives in California…and he doesn’t have a car. After a spur-of-the-moment car purchase, Lewis prepares to embark on the road trip of a lifetime. Only now, he has to make a pitstop in Utah to bail his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) out of jail. Fuller joins Lewis on the trip and installs a CB radio into Lewis’s new car. One fateful interaction with a trucker named Rusty Nail (Ted Levine/Matthew Kimbrough) turns this into a road trip from hell.\n\nOff of a solid run of films, before turning to a life of television directing (no shade, make your money king), John Dahl would slightly pivot from his neo-noir style of film to a grittier horror action piece. Written by Clay Tarver and post(ish)-Felicity, pre(ish)-Alias J.J. Abrahams, Joy Ride is a high-octane, starstudded popcorn flick that puts others of its ilk to shame. While its budget of 23 million dollars (roughly 32 million in today’s money) sounds steep…it is! Joy Ride is a visually well-polished film, but it’s hard to see where those 23 million went. The action and set pieces stand out for their top-notch production value; seemingly, no expense was spared in that department.\n\nJoy Ride’s charm comes from the relationships between Paul Walker, Leelee Sobieski, and Steve Zahn. Each actor embodies their characters with a level of tact and professionalism that wasn’t overly present in the films of this time period. Everything about Joy Ride feels too ahead of its time. Sinking that much money into a project like this seems like it should have been a futile task. But once Rusty Nail hammers his way back into the lives of these three weary travelers, the film gets more sinister than you could imagine.\n\nTed Levine is unquestionably an incredible actor. The tenor and masculine vibrato of his voice could make even the most macho person quake in fear. Rusty’s endless quest to bring justice from this incredibly messed up slight, crosses the lines in too many ways. Could you imagine Rusty Nail caught up in one of those awful YouTube pranks? (Sequel idea!) Once his revenge starts, there is no stopping it. And it’s one hell of a pulse-pounding ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Dahl crafts a perfect balance between action, comedy, and thrills. I mean, you don’t put Steve Zahn in your film if you don’t want people to at least chuckle a little. Zahn’s quips and one-liners are used sparingly, but enough that when the jokes stop flowing, and the horror picks up, you miss the jokes. His role in the film is like that shot you have before you get onto the subway to go on a first date. The comedy is a social lubricant so by the time the film completely shifts to dark and threatening, you’re yanked back in.\n\nIf you have a physical copy of Joy Ride, I highly suggest checking out the almost 30-minute-long alternate ending. Walton Goggins is in it! There are so many endings to this film, and each one surprisingly works just as well as the previous one. The theatrical ending is the most enjoyable and is a great kickstarter to two less enjoyable films.\n\nJoy Ride is a blast from the past and is a film everyone should revisit (or watch if you haven’t seen it.) Incredible performances, exciting action sequences, and a truly terrifying antagonist make Joy Ride all gas and no brakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFull Moon Features is a goliath of B-movies. With hundreds of films to their name, Charles Band created a truly historic production and distribution company. Band would become known for producing large quantities of low-budget genre fare with something for everyone. Some of Full Moon’s most acclaimed series consist of the Puppet Master franchise, the campy vamp franchise Subspecies, and even Stuart Gordon’s Castle Freak! Plus, who hasn’t seen the poster for Gingerdead Man with Gary Busey’s name plastered dead center on the top?\n\nAs someone who has enjoyed Full Moon films in the past, I’d be lying if I said they haven’t fallen off my radar in the past few years. The newest sub-label from Full Moon Features is Pulp Noir, and their first film is here! Quadrant is a bleak look at the future of Pulp Noir.\n\nQuadrant follows Erin (Shannon Helene Barnes), who stumbles upon an experiment for the Quadrant helmet. Designed by “scientists” Harry (Rickard Claeson) and Meg (Emma Reinagel), the helmet will transport the [willing] user into a world of their choosing. For Erin, that is England during the Jack the Ripper murders. Erin also happens to be unhealthily obsessed with said sex worker serial killer. After meeting fellow Quadrant subject Robert (Christian Carrigan), Erin starts to blur the lines between reality and the Quadrant.\n\nLet’s get one thing perfectly clear: I love low/microbudget films. It’s the films with shoestring budgets that pull out all the stops. When working within limited budgets, you must tap into every single source to get the best final product. It’s understandable when films of this nature cut corners when needed. What isn’t understandable or acceptable is someone like Charles Band greenlighting an idea like this. The amount of AI slop flung at the wall here is laughable. But let’s get to the positives of this film before diving into that…topic.\n\nWritten by Full Moon Pictures alumn C. Courtney Joyner, is Quadrant’s biggest asset. Respectively, Full Moon isn’t known for their most high-concept stories and ideas. Quadrant is a uniquely interesting take on true crime; what would happen if those obsessed with a series of murders could go into a simulation to recreate them? Joyner’s script takes the concept to fascinating corners, examining this maybe-not-too-farfetched idea with excellence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuadrant may not be entirely sure who its lead is supposed to be; to me, Erin is the main character. The story revolves around her and her reaction to the world within Quadrant, even if she shares equal screen time with Meg, Robert, and Harry. Though the cast is haphazardly white, Shannon Helene Barnes carries this film with the grace of Atlas. Barnes tackles Erin’s character with extreme charisma and horror, and it’s genuinely entertaining and alluring to watch Erin’s arc. And every shot of Erin going absolutely crazy looks fantastic. Honestly, she’s just trying to find somebody to match her freak.\n\nAnd, yes, I know you’re asking, “Does Quadrant keep with the Full Moon tradition of unwarranted sexuality?” Yes! It even stars adult film star Lexi Lore.\n\nMy goal isn’t to unnecessarily crap on Quadrant. While it’s important to consider the Full Moon Pictures oeuvre, that doesn’t mean there still can’t be care and love put into a microbudget B-movie. Quadrant, and by proxy Band, is upfront and clear with the film’s use of AI. During the opening credits, the film happily boasts credits to AI Art Supervisor Chuck Cirino and AI Artist Michael J. Sechrest. At this point I took a step back and realized the credits were rolling over AI-generated backdrops of black and white London streets. Whenever someone enters Quadrant, they’re greenscreened over garishly atrocious AI images. Each background plate is rife with inconsistencies; windows don’t match up, and the facades of storefronts are crooked and an eyesore. That’s not even mentioning the truly atrocious AI-generated creatures.\n\nThis is where my anger came in. Charles Band was an inspiration to thousands of filmmakers. From the 80s and beyond, Band pushed the envelope of what is acceptable and what should be accepted as a film. Against all odds, Charles Band was a success story. He created some truly memorable genre IPs and was the true definition of independent filmmaking. Puppet Master was a practical film with practical puppets that were practically killing people! It was the sign of a hungry filmmaker. To see someone like Charles Band abandon what made him a success, and what made fans fall in love with him, is incredibly sad to see. As stated, I have fallen off the Full Moon train in the past few years, so maybe this doesn’t come as a surprise if he’s already been on the AI train.\n\nQuadrant is a typical Full Moon Pictures film sullied by a lack of care for creating something meaningful. Just think of how many artists are out there who grew up on Full Moon and wanted to make art because of them. Most importantly, how many would have loved the opportunity to create something for them. From Late Night With The Devil, to The People’s Joker, and now to Full Moon Pictures, AI is a disease that is ravaging too many truly creative filmmakers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the antidote? I genuinely don’t know.\n\nIf you’re a regular fan of Full Moon and Charles Band and don’t care about the use of AI, then Quadrant will work for you. But if you can’t stand to stomach the egregious overuse of fake art and find it sad that someone like Charles Band would agree to stoop to that level, then you should skip this one.\n\nQuadrant will be available to stream across several services starting on August 23rd.\n\nLove physical media?\n\nWell then Full Moon Pictures has you covered, you’ll also be able to pick up Quadrant on Blu-ray, DVD, AND even VHS!\n\nAdvertisement"
