        "text": "I remember we were in Houston with 21 Savage and Metro Boomin, because work on SAVAGE MODE II [the duo’s second collaborative project, ndr] had just started. The second we got the green light and the stems, I started to work on the beats. I made nearly 20 beats for the project, “Spiral” had about four different versions before Savage decided on the one. Meezy was right there with me suggesting I make a couple of different versions from Charlie Clouser’s [Saw franchise composer, ndr] iconic “Hello Zepp” theme, crazy executive production chops there.\n\nI had just connected Meezy, Kid Hazel [and] 21 Savage with all the Twisted Pictures/Lionsgate executives and they immediately put a representative on a private jet to Houston with a physical screener copy for Meezy and 21 Savage to see Spiral. Savage is a huge Saw fan, so he watched it almost as soon as the plane landed. [Spiral’s Music Supervisor and Co-Executive Producer of the Spiral Soundtrack] Scott Greer reached out to Meezy around the same time regarding this project, he sent the stems for all the original scores the next day, and Hazel went straight to work.\n\n21 Savage recorded “Spiral” that night. Hazel soon came out to Paramount Studios in L.A. already loaded up with a ton of beats he made specifically for this project. His work ethic is just incomparable. Thankfully, Savage had just about everybody in Slaughter Gang [the artist’s own label, ndr] fly to L.A. to make things efficient, since we only had a month to do the entire thing."
