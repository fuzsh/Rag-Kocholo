        "text": "Brave New World is a dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley that was published in 1932 as a response to the rise of Hitler and significant technological advances that were changing the world. One piece of technology referenced in the novel is the feelies. The feelies in Brave New World is a movie theater experience that focuses on the viewer's sensory experience. While a normal movie experience uses sight and sound, the feelies add the sensations of smell and touch. This interactive technology brings the viewer directly into the experience that the actors on screen are having.\n\nThe feelies are a technologically advanced movie theater with the addition of scent and touch interaction.\n\nWhile this type of activity is common in the World State, John (who is from the Savage Reservation) has never experienced anything like it before. When Lenina brings him to the feelies on a date, she has an incredible experience, but after the show, it's clear John hasn't received the same enjoyment. He calls the film \"base\" and \"ignoble\", telling Lenina she shouldn't \"see things like that.\" This is not to say these were John's true feelings, as the narrator points out that John was actually \"ashamed of his desire.\" (169-170) The experience leaves him feeling embarrassed and confused, which leads him back to what he knows--his books.\n\nHuxley doesn't provide comprehensive detail about the engineering of the feelies or how they specifically work, but he leaves enough clues for the reader to understand the general concept. Just like a regular movie theater, you'll find individual seats and a large viewing screen with speakers for sound. However, the feelies offer two other pieces of technology:\n\n1. Scent: A scent machine releases different fragrances during the film that correspond to the setting and the emotional reactions on screen. During the film Lenina and John attend, they experience scents such as thyme, basil, sandalwood, and cedar, to name a few.\n\n2. Touch: Lenina instructs John to \"take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of (his) chair...otherwise (he) won't get any of the feely effects.\" (167) These metal knobs somehow transmute the sensations on screen into the viewer's body. For example, when the man and woman kiss in the film, John feels a tingling sensation on his lips. When he releases the knobs, the sensation dissipates. The characters claim these sensations are so powerful that they can feel every hair on a bearskin rug.\n\nHuxley\n\nWhile the feelies were way ahead of their time in 1932, today's modern theaters have adopted some of the same technology. From Dolby Digital speakers within the walls and luxury theater seats to 3D viewings with the help of glasses, film-going has come a long way over the last several decades. Even the advancement of tech with items like virtual reality devices are pushing the boundaries of sight, sound, and the concept of reality. These pieces of technology blur the line between what is real and what feels real, and that was exactly what Huxley wanted to shed light on and warn against with regards to technology.\n\nWhat Are the Feelies?\n\nWhen we want to see a film, we go to the cinema. We are immersed in the vision and sounds of the show, and if we pay extra, we might even get a chair that moves around. Some attractions even offer 3D or have water that sprays the audience at appropriate moments. The whole idea is to get lost in the production. However, for the people of Brave New World, there's a whole new level of getting lost at the movies. The feelies offer a chance to not only experience sights and sounds as, but even feel touch. For a society so obsessed with touch as that of the World State, this is quite the achievement.\n\nHow Do the Feelies Work?\n\nWhile we don't learn a great deal about the engineering of the feelies, we do get that they are quite similar to our own cinemas. There is, however, one major difference. When people go to a feelie, they grab hold of two metal knobs on the armrests. These knobs provide signals to the brain that create the sensation of touch for the viewer.\n\nThough we don't get the technical detail of how they work, we learn that the feelies are quite the technological achievement. Characters claim to be able to feel every hair on a bearskin rug at one point. Still, the level of drama portrayed on screen and through the knobs is not exactly highbrow. Much of what is shown would be considered pornographic by our standards. In fact, John comments that the feelie he sees with Lenina cannot compare to Othello, which John considers to be the superior work."
