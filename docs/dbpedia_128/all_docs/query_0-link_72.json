        "text": "In his novel Lord of the Flies, William Golding depicts a group of young boys, aged 6 – 12, who becomes stranded on a paradisaical island. The boys strive to maintain order at first, and a boy named Ralph is elected as chief. His competitor, a head choir boy named Jack, is assigned to lead his choir to tend to a signal fire and to hunt. Ralph sets the priorities of maintaining a signal fire and building shelters, along with setting other rules, such as that whoever holds the conch shell they use to call meetings is the only boy allowed to speak. The Lord of the Flies boys' structure begins breaking down early in the novel. Ralph and a few of his loyal followers strive to maintain order, but savagery in Lord of the Flies quickly takes over. Without adult supervision and conventional society, the boys socially devolve and succumb to primitive instincts. Jack leads the boys into savagery. He is obsessed with hunting, he challenges Ralph, and he promises fun and meat, which wins over most of the boys when he breaks away to form his own tribe. Jack is not content with having the support of the majority of the boys, and he orders an attack to find and murder Ralph, who, by the end of the novel, is alone on the island.\n\nHunger\n\nThe first primal instinct the boys encounter, which starts the process of them becoming savage, is hunger. The island they landed on has everything they need, including an abundance of fruit trees. Although the trees provide plenty of fruit for the boys, they are not satisfied with just fruit. Their instincts drive them to hunt the pigs that live on the island, so they can have meat.\n\nJack: We will kill a pig and give a feast.\n\nRalph agrees with the other boys that they need meat. However, he still prioritizes the signal fire. Jack and his boys struggle to catch and kill a pig, which fuels Jack's obsession. Jack takes all of his boys hunting, letting the signal fire go out as a ship passes. The band of hunters kill their first pig. The boys come back, chanting \"Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.\" Jack starts telling the story of the hunt, telling Ralph, \"You should have seen the blood!\"\n\nAfter Jack forms his own tribe, he leads another hunt. The boys select a sow with several piglets as their target. This is a savage choice, as, without their mother, the piglets will die, which will decrease the population of pigs on the island. Savagery clouds the boys' judgment. During this hunt, Roger, the most violent of the boys, pushes his spear into the hind of the pig, which the boys find hilarious. They are no longer hunting for meat, but for the thrill of the kill.\n\nFear\n\nA six-year-old boy with a large birthmark on his face tells the others that he saw a \"beastie\" in the forest at night. The older boys are unconvinced that there is a monster, and they pass it off as an irrational fear of a young child. The fear among the younger boys (littluns) continues, and Ralph brings it up at a meeting. He says the boys need to set things straight, so there is no more fear. The speech does not work, and the fear of the beast grows.\n\nRalph: So the last part, the bit we can all talk about, is kind of deciding on the fear.\n\nSimon, a quiet and helpful boy, suggests: \"Maybe there is a beast,\" \"maybe it's only us.\" Simon realizes the boys are becoming savage and that they should be scared of themselves. Sam and Eric, twins who follow Ralph, think they see the beast, and they run to tell the others. Since they are older boys, or biguns, the other biguns' fear increases. The older boys lead a hunt for the beast, and Jack and Ralph think they see it, and they take off running. When Jack is reminded of this, he gets mad and decides to start his own tribe. He uses the fear of the beast to help manipulate the boys into siding with him.\n\nThe Tribe\n\nJack breaks away and forms his own tribe. Where Ralph wants to maintain civility and prioritize safety and rescue, Jack founds his tribe on savagery, and he prioritizes hunting. Jack stops wearing clothes, and he only wears a belt and his paint mask, which he wears to shield himself from societal morals. Jack is not the only savage one, and most of the other boys sneak away from Ralph's tribe, joining Jack's.\n\nIn Jacks tribe, they also shed their clothes and wear paint. Jack commands his boys to break into Ralph's tribe first to steal fire, then to take Piggy's glasses. Rather than allowing his boys fun and freedom, Jack becomes a dictator. He urges his boys to behave savagely and violently. He makes them steal, and he commands them to hunt Ralph. Roger, a violent and evil boy, is used by Jack as a weapon. Roger kills Piggy, and he tortures Sam and Eric into joining Jack and giving away Ralph's location.\n\nRitualistic Sacrifices\n\nTo control and appease his boys, Jack makes a ritualistic sacrifice. After the boys hunt and kill the mother sow, Jack cuts off her head and mounts it on a stick. He says, \"This head is for the beast. It's a gift.\" By leaving the head, Jack creates loyalty. His boys believe he is leaving behind the head to placate the beast. In reality, the act of cutting off the head is savage and manipulative.\n\nThe first sacrifice leads to the second. Jack holds a feast, and all the boys except one, Simon, come to eat. Jack and Ralph argue, and Jack commands his boys to start a tribal dance. Something comes stumbling into the boys' camp, and the boys attack, thinking it is the beast. In a frenzy, they start chanting, \"Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\" Golding writes: \"Simon was crying out something about a dead man on a hill.\" Although flashes of lightning illuminate Simon, and he yells, the savage boys do not stop. The next day Ralph admits that he knew it was Simon they had killed.\n\nWilliam Golding's Lord of the Flies is about the two sides of people—the civil side, and the savage side. Ralph, the elected chief, represents civility, while his opponent, Jack, represents savagery. At first, the boys attempt to duplicate a civilized society. They elect a chief, who sets priorities and rules. The structure quickly breaks down, as the boys are faced with their primal instincts. The first instinct the boys experience that drives them towards savagery is hunger. The island has abundant fruit, but the boys are hungry for meat. Jack becomes obsessed with hunting, not for the meat, but he wants to kill. The boys also experience fear. It is first introduced by a littlun who says he saw a beast, and the fear continues to grow. Simon is the only boy who realizes that the beast is really the boys and that they should fear themselves.\n\nJack uses the hunger for meat and the fear of the beast to manipulate the boys into being loyal to him. He breaks off from Ralph and forms his own tribe, and most of the other boys eventually follow him. Life in Jack's tribe is savage. The boys run around naked and painted, and they spend their days hunting and obeying Jack's commands. They perform a ritualistic sacrifice, where Jack cuts the head off of a sow to leave as an offering for the beast. That night, the boys, whipped into a frenzy and performing a tribal dance, ritualistically kill Simon, who they mistake for the beast. It becomes apparent that the creature they are attacking is a person, but the savage boys do not stop.\n\nSavagery as a Thematic Topic\n\nSome of us watch nature documentaries and grimace at the brutal and savage killings that animals engage in on a daily basis. This is because we have empathy, an emotion that we learn by interacting with our society. If our society did not regard killing as a negative behavior, we would probably kill freely and show no remorse.\n\nSavagery and civilization are common thematic topics in William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies. Thematic topics are universal ideas in a story that the author wants to make a statement about.\n\nGolding focuses on the primitive instincts of man such as hunting, fear, and sacrifice. By depicting children's descent into savagery, even referring to them as such, it's clear that Golding is warning us of the dangers of the absence of a civilized society.\n\nHunger\n\nWhen a group of English boys become stranded on an island, they start off trying to maintain the structure of civilization. They hold meetings, distribute jobs, and work cooperatively. It's only after Ralph is elected as leader that Jack is drawn toward a more savage lifestyle and begins to get other boys on his side.\n\nJack is often described in a dark manner and compared to an animal: ''Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees.'' Jack provides the boys with the temptation of meat.\n\nSimon initially provided the boys with fruit and vegetation, but it proves to be less fun and tasty as hunting pigs. Even Ralph is drawn to the hunting and engages in one of the hunts with Jack's group: ''Ralph too was fighting to get near, to get a handful of that brown, vulnerable flesh. The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering.'' This demonstrates the power of the instinct of hunting to primal man.\n\nThough the boys could have focused on keeping the fire going and sustained themselves on fruits and vegetation, they allow themselves to become distracted by hunting.\n\nRitualistic Sacrifices\n\nThe boys engage in rituals, something often associated with primitive man. Initially, the rituals are harmless. Simon witnesses the boys brutally murder a sow and stake her head as an offering to a beast that the boys think is hunting them. It's later that we discover this event foreshadowed the death of Simon himself.\n\nSimon emerges from the woods and finds himself in the center of a group of boys, chanting in a ritualistic manner. They have recently fed on a pig that they slaughtered, and they are reenacting the hunt. When Simon appears, they continue the chanting and ritual and eventually kill him: '''Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!' Now out of the terror rose another desire, thick, urgent, blind.'' This quote demonstrates that the boys are motivated by primal urges, and their humanity is no longer part of their decisions.\n\nSimon's death is frightening and disorienting. The boys have murdered one of their own, demonstrating the dangers of people existing without ordered society.\n\nFear\n\nFear is a very instinctive emotion; many of us cannot logically explain our fears. The boys are no different. Their eyes are playing tricks on them, and they think that they have seen a dangerous creature in the shadows. Simon finds the truth when he discovers that the beast is nothing more than a dead parachuter, but Jack uses instinctual fear to continue to rule over them. Their fear also contributes to their transformation into a tribe of primitive beings."
