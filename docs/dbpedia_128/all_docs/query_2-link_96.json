        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\nSunday post! I apologize for the delay from the regular Friday post, but let’s just say, it was a personal holiday. Furthermore, the original analysis I intended to post seemed to be more pertinent for this coming week, so I looked through my reserves, and have re-emerged victorious with another Western. Enjoy!\n\nPlot Synopsis: Stagecoach is a Classical Hollywood Western (1939) which explores the dynamics across gender and class of nine strangers aboard a stagecoach, as they come across the elements, warring Indians, and distrust of each other. [Note: This film possesses facets which complicate our modern sensibilities of racial and sexual politics, which is par for the course of most films of the era]. The nine members include the cautious and simple-minded driver (Buck), the marshal guarding the coach (Curly), a prostitute and alcoholic doctor being run from the town (Dallas and Doc Boone), an escaped outlaw looking for revenge (Ringo), a Southern gentlewoman reuniting with her cavalry husband (Mrs. Mallory), a Southern gentleman and gambler (Hatfield), an embezzling banker fleeing his crime (Henry Gatewood), and a meek and quiet whiskey salesman (Samuel Peacock).\n\nWhile Stagecoach provides a litany of features to analyze – structure, storytelling strategies, character set-up and development, depictions of masculinity, innovative use of cinematography and editing, its essential place in the history of Westerns and Western mythology, etc. – this particular analysis will focus on issues of characterizing the feminine identity, a less-studied aspect of film Westerns (a male-dominated genre). First, let’s define a few terms, specifically that of performativity.\n\nPerformativity, although steeped in other disciplines like psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, and philosophy, is basically the theoretical perspective that facets of our identity (like our gender) are not essential or inherent but rather a performance, acts, behaviors, and gestures predicated on a structure of expectations that we ourselves (as well as society) constructs and performs – it is not only what we are but what we do that defines us (cue Hans Zimmer score). For example, as a female, there is a certain way of speaking, walking, and acting that is expected of me – a higher-pitched voice, swaying hips, long hair and shaved legs, sensitive and emotional, nurturing and maternal, etc. – and by performing those acts and that role, I am accomplishing gender. I am performing the role of “feminine” “woman,” just as men are expected to perform that of “masculine” “man” in our hegemonic binary system of gender roles. This transcends gender of course, intersecting with race, class, sexuality, and enumerable other contributing pieces of an individual and collective identity. Femininity within films is constructed very much the same way, across time, cultures, and genres. Taking Westerns, there are certain female stereotypes we expect to encounter: the prostitute or madam with the heart of gold, the virginal damsel, the town ladies, the wise-cracking, gun-toting granny who knows the rules, the alluring and exoticized native woman – women of the Western have their own set of behaviors and roles they are expected to perform, and are characterized, judged, and narrativized accordingly.\n\nIn John Ford’s Stagecoach (1939), the performativity of the feminine identity and symbols of womanhood are explored in the initially dichotomous archetypal relationship between Dallas and Mrs. Mallory, utilizing the respective actresses’ portrayals, and the role of the audience’s expectations as a reflection of contemporary ideology.\n\nFrom the opening scenes, the audience is introduced to a motley group of stagecoach passengers, seemingly ordinary and on relatively equal-footing. However, there is a clear line in behavior towards Dallas (Claire Trevor), a prostitute being exiled from the town by the women’s “Law and Order League,” and Mrs. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), the pregnant wife of a cavalry officer. For a young woman to be travelling alone on a stagecoach journey, in a carriage filled with men, would have been considered risky and often unladylike – the concern is made evident regarding Mrs. Mallory, yet no one questions why Dallas would be travelling alone. Furthermore, Dallas is not even allowed an actual name other than a masculine nickname she was likely given as a prostitute; in contrast, Lucy is always referred to as Mrs. Mallory, a gentlelady and a woman of status. Dallas’ only ally and fellow exilee is alcoholic Doctor Boone (Thomas Mitchell), who the town perceives almost as worse as Dallas; Doc claims that the reason Dallas can’t live in peace is because the upright women prefer to be seen “scouring out the dregs of the town.”\n\nWhen the ragtag group enters the stagecoach, both Southern gentleman Hatfield (John Carradine) and Lucy prefer to sit as far away from Dallas as possible, and when the delicate Mrs. Mallory is in need of refreshment, Hatfield retrieves a small, silver cup for her to drink from rather than the canteen. However, when Ringo demands to know why Dallas was not offered the same hospitality, Hatfield simply tells him that the cup is no longer available. Despite the fact that they inhabit the same physical space, the camera creates two separate cinematic spaces, one for Hatfield and Lucy who sit across from one another, and the other being Dallas on the opposite side and Ringo sitting on the floor below her. The second most prominent scene where Dallas is treated as less is when the stage reaches Dry Fork, and Mrs. Mallory refuses to eat at the same main table where a prostitute is also eating. Another minor female role is that of Yakima (Elvira Rios), a Native American woman married to the Mexican owner of the stopping place for the coach, whom whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek) takes particular notice of: “But she’s … she’s… a savage.” She is dark and mysterious, and even her husband speaks of her interchangeably with that of his horses’ usefulness and wildness (Movshovitz 69). The identification of woman is neither allowed for characters such as Dallas due to her moral impropriety, nor Yakima due her supposed racial inferiority.\n\nThe major turning point in the perception of Dallas as an actual woman is when Mrs. Mallory goes into labor during the journey. When prior, she was not even allowed to sit at the same table or be considered a woman in the presence of a real “Mrs.,” Dallas is only then considered woman-enough when she is helpful in assisting Doc Boone in the delivery process. The men themselves are left in a room with “extremely low light and a fire throwing shadows […] where the men wait impotently for the outcome of an event they do not understand” (Movshovitz 69). After the child’s birth, Dallas is looked on for the first time with respect and acknowledgment when she cradles the baby in her arms – in that moment, she is in fact worthy of the feminine identity, of being perceived indeed as a woman. In the stagecoach chase climax, Dallas is given the sole job of protecting the baby while Lucy falls in between states of catatonia and hysterics, neither is entrusted with a gun. Furthermore, after the men have had their share of kills, action, and agency, it is with Hatfield’s last moments (and by far one of the darkest scenes) that he saves the last bullet not for himself but for Lucy. He believes it is his duty to protect her from whatever rituals may be performed upon her by their potential Native American captors, sullying and tainting a genuine, gentlelady. He ponders no such option for Dallas. In his mind, he must protect the virtue of the only woman aboard the coach – Mrs. Mallory.\n\nBy the end of the film, Mrs. Mallory and Dallas have accepted that though they socially will never be identified as the same gender or quality, their experiences on the coach have created an undeniable mutual respect – evidenced when Lucy apologizes for her initial iciness and when Dallas in return gifts her her shawl. Lastly, for Dallas’ final moment of redemption, she rejects her previous life as a prostitute and agrees to become the wife of Ringo, living on his ranch and having a large family. Even in the arms of a criminal turned revenge-murderer, Dallas is still perceived as more of a woman than if she continued to eke out a meager living as a prostitute.\n\nIn the larger ideological context, the depiction of gender roles in Classical Hollywood was strictly dichotomous – the female character is either Madonna or whore. Mrs. Mallory is the fair, delicate wife of an officer who is carrying a child, versus the unvirtuous Dallas, a character not even deserving of an actual first name, any surname at all, and not even a title of “Miss.” According to film scholars Maria Pramaggiore’s and Tom Wallis’ scholarly article on gender in cinema, “In classical movies, men do the action and propel the plot forward. Women are passive. They are objects of desire, looked at and pursued by male protagonists” (328). The one common thread between Lucy and Dallas is their status as objects, Lucy being that of her General father, then of her Officer husband, and then pursued by Hatfield who “offers his protection to the lady.” Dallas, as a prostitute, is the object of desire for many men, and is eagerly pursued for settlement by Ringo.\n\nIn 1939, the Production Code was in effect, a set of guidelines that fundamentally established the self-censorship of films on a sin-punishment system, with special regards to expression of gender and sexuality. According to the Code’s text, film is “primarily to be regarded as entertainment […] which can improve […] or degrade human beings […].” Therefore, it has “special moral obligations,” and the “correct entertainment raises the whole standard of the nation” (Quigley and Lord). Essentially, the medium of film cannot be used to morally influence the masses in a negative way, and in order to achieve positive influence, it must not show immoral activities (i.e. perversion, sex, criminal activities) in a glorifying light. For example, Dallas as a prostitute has already committed a sin – sexual expression and “choosing” the lascivious and corrupting occupation of a sex worker – therefore, she must be punished and/or find redemption. At the time of Stagecoach’s release, two other films, The Women and Destry Rides Again were also distributed.\n\nIn The Women, an alleged gold-digger and homewrecker played by Joan Crawford is punished in the end for stealing another woman’s husband, and having multiple affairs, by being exposed, extricated from both relationships, and exiled back to her lowly perfume counter. [Note: The cast is entirely made up of women]. In Destry Rides Again, Marlene Dietrich plays a prostitute in an older Western town who falls in love with the good guy for once, changes sides – gaining her redemption – and is accidentally killed in the crossfire. These would have been fates the audiences of 1939 would have grown to expect due to effect created by the perceived differences between men and women, and between different kinds of women, for which the justification of “laws and practices that have denied women autonomy and barred them from positions of social and economic power” would only be reinforced by the repetition of “these familiar representations of male and female” which could to a degree “encourage audiences to accept essentialist arguments about gender roles” (Pramaggiore and Wallis 327, 330). Less than a decade later in the film noir movement, women will become more active agents in narratives, but still retain the reputation of being “threatening and destructive,” and therefore in need of punishment for their great many sins: greed, lust, manipulation, promiscuity, and wrath (329).\n\nHowever, despite these stereotypes depicted in Ford’s film, the dynamics between the inhabitants of the coach provides for a great deal of flexibility and sensitivity. Dallas, despite her presumed social inferiority, is quick-on-her-feet, not unintelligent, and has an appealing vulnerability conveyed in simultaneity with her world-weary strength. Mrs. Mallory, in contrast, is shown as incapable and rather snobbish, and in her indifference to Hatfield’s attentions, she accepts the very same attention that Dallas is scolded for despite its significance to her only means of livelihood. In Howard Movshovitz’s analysis of women in John Ford westerns, specifically Stagecoach (1939) and The Searchers (1956), examines how the “birth sequence […] separates the enduring values from the artificial ones. [In that scene] Dallas and Doc prove wrong the stupid judgments of social stereotypes.”\n\nFord’s Stagecoach, despite its release some eighty years ago, still provides an informed blueprint for the current depiction of femininity and womanhood in Hollywood film, one of marriage versus solitude, maternity versus sexual freedom, sin and punishment versus diversity, redemption, and acceptance, and dichotomy versus flexibility and self-determination.\n\nWorks Cited"
