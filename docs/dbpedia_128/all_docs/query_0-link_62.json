        "text": "From recreating ‘80s slasher flicks to internet-savvy self parody and refined snapshots of Black joy and trauma, 21 Savage has never represented himself as a prototypical southern rapper. On songs, the Atlanta-based MC is known for the contrast between his eerily calm voice and the grisly scenes he paints. But since the beginning of his career, 21 has been using his videos, album covers, and Instagram posts to advance and enhance his persona.\n\nThat certainly applies to his newest project, Savage Mode II, the sequel to his seminal Metro Boomin-produced EP, which features cover art inspired by legendary Houston-based design company Pen & Pixel and narration from Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman. The striking visuals, heavyweight talent and uniform aesthetic all add up to 21 Savage’s most assured and exciting album presentation yet.\n\nSavage’s vision is executed by his photographer and creative director John Canon, but Canon is quick to assure that it all begins with the rapper himself. Freeman reinforces that sentiment, as the Hollywood veteran humbly notes that all seven of his monologues between tracks came straight from a script he was given, with no improvisations.\n\n“Savage had the idea for the Pen & Pixel-style cover,” Canon explained to GQ. “He listens to old Hot Boys and stuff like that.” For a time, Pen & Pixel’s gilded, gloriously ostentatious graphics were synonymous with the biggest labels in southern rap, featuring on covers for everyone from No Limit and Cash Money to the Hot Boys, the supergroup 21 likes so much he once themed a birthday party around them. Looming ominously over a lavish mansion on the cover, Savage and Metro Boomin recall duos like Big Tymers. But this homage is more than just a derivative recreation--it’s another novel attempt at telling Savage’s story.\n\nLike some of the best Pen & Pixel covers–Juvenile’s 400 Degreez or the objectively classic art for Big Bear’s Doin Thangs–the Savage Mode II artwork is richly detailed. Canon was responsible for adding tributes to friends of Savage who have died, as well as to the rapper’s own struggles. “[Most details] were inspired by the Pen & Pixel style, but [I added] the engraving on the dagger, the six bullet holes represent the six times that he was shot. I felt like that was something powerful, and I felt like the engravings were things that really mean something to him,” Canon explains. That’s stylistically consistent with the subject matter of Savage Mode II, in which the spoils of success abut past traumas. Some songs are more sunny and upbeat, featuring high-profile guests and clever samples (“Mr. Right Now,” “Steppin on N***as”). But others are darker, addressing longstanding trust issues (“RIP Luv”), deceased loved ones (“Said N Done”), and the revelations about his London birthplace that dominated the news last year (“My Dawg”).\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the young age of Savage’s core fanbase, not everyone embraced or even fully understood the P&P look, with some fans on Twitter negatively likening Savage Mode II’s cover to an old Playstation game or a low-budget party flyer. Canon says he knew a ‘90s reference like this one, even if it was covered in diamonds, wouldn’t click for everybody, particularly younger listeners.\n\n“When [Savage] first said that he wanted to do the cover like that, I knew people weren’t gonna understand. But, at the same time, I wasn’t afraid to still do it. At some point somebody is gonna pull together an article of all these covers and make it make sense,” he says.\n\nWhen it comes to the youth’s awareness of the 83-year-old Morgan Freeman, the actor immediately lists the classic and cable TV mainstay Shawshank Redemption as their likely access point, and the reason why a 27 year-old rapper might seek him out to anchor his album. “It’s Shawshank,” he muses “Or it’s just, a lot of people call [my voice] the ‘voice of God,’’. Whatever your fondest memory of Morgan Freeman’s soothing, commanding voice, it’s a universally agreed upon national treasure that has led to offers to narrate all sorts of things, most of which he turns down. But he says he jumped at the chance to narrate Savage Mode II because it represents such a stark departure from the “nice guy” roles he’s typically offered. “What happens is you sort of get locked into a position,” Freeman explains. “Henry Fonda was in it, Spencer Tracy was in it, James Stewart was in it, even though he played a couple of bad guys. You don't really don't want to be cast into a mold, but after a few years, it's bound to happen. Every [offer] that’s outside of what you consider [your] mold is fun to do. I got to jump at it.”\n\nStill, the subject matter on Savage Mode II wasn’t as big a leap for Freeman as one might think, interludes about the nuances between a snitch and a rat aside. “I read the copy and was like wow, there's some wisdom in here,” Freeman recalls, explaining that he boiled the monologues down to their core themes and values. “I think this is the way I think. It's basically saying don't suffer fools and when you want something go for that,” he says, adding “If [Savage’s music] is a young people thing, then this is stuff they need to be aware of. So it's a good thing to do.”\n\nSince the project’s release, social media has been peppered with memes depicting Freeman as a part of Savage’s universe, either by photoshopping the rapper’s trademark knife tattoo onto the actor or pairing screenshots from the rare films in which Freeman brandishes a gun. At press time, Freeman hadn’t listened to the music his narration accompanies, nor had he done further research on Savage (“My lady asked me if I’d been living under a rock”). But he intends to. Just don’t expect him to venture out for a visual cameo while we’re still in the midst of this pandemic—all of his contributions were recorded at his house, on his iPhone.\n\nFreeman’s narration does appear in the special effects-heavy trailer that heralded the album’s arrival. Directed by Gibson Hazard, the video is darkly funny and genuinely creepy, playing up the horror vibes to match Metro’s spooky instrumentals before ending with a shot straight out of the Overbrook Hotel. The video for “Runnin,” which accompanied the album’s release, is also striking: Savage and Metro bring 21’s Best Rap Song Grammy to Atlanta, juxtaposing the symbol of music industry success with the realities of the city’s Zone 6. Savage carries that contrast into the lyrics, rapping, “I brought a Hollywood bitch to Club Crucial/I was at the Met Gala with my shooter.”\n\nCanon, who has photographed many of Atlanta’s rap stars (he describes the city as being “like a big high school”), says Savage is especially particular. “He always knows what he wants,” Canon says. “There’s never been a time where I did or shot anything for him that he didn’t know how he wanted it to look.”\n\nCanon is also charged with depicting 21 Savage in his downtime, whether it’s his involvement with the fashion world, relaxing and playing basketball, or being a father.“That’s always been my goal with the day-to-day work that I did with Savage, was to capture moments that show another side of him,” he says.\n\nSavage’s eye for “iconic” imagery has been apparent to Canon since they began working together in 2016, just before the release of the first Savage Mode. He references the A Zae and The Picture Man-directed “No Heart” video, which recreates the Hughes Brothers’ cult classic Menace II Society, as an example of the rapper and his team knowing how to make videos that elevate 21 as an artist.\n\n“He’s not just an ABC rapper, his intelligence comes out in his music.” Canon explains.\n\nIt’s not only evident there, but also in his artwork and videos. There is no stereotypical representation of 21 Savage, because each time we see him he’s careful to show multiple sides of himself. A cursory skimming of Savage Mode II may only catch the intentionally gaudy artwork and the songs about killing, cars and women. But a deeper look reveals those symbolic bullet holes, and the bars imparting the wisdom that makes a guy like Morgan Freeman eager to be a part of the story."
