        "text": "Lord of the Flies - Questions to Consider\n\nCritical Thinking:\n\n1. As you learned in the lesson, symbols give deeper meaning to a narrative by drawing attention to elements of the story relating to theme. The way that symbols work is that an object represents a larger concept or idea. The object, like the conch shell, is the symbol and the concept is the symbolized. Whatever happens to the symbol operates on the symbolized as well. This process is called symbolic action. Choose one of the symbols in the lesson and discuss how the process of symbolic action operates.\n\n2. Piggy's glasses are used as a symbol of intelligence and reason in Lord of the Flies. Choose another of the characters in the novel to describe. Is there anything about this character that might work in a symbolic way similarly to Piggy's glasses?\n\n3. One key message or theme in this novel is that there are parts in every person representing both good and evil. We might also think of this dichotomy as light versus dark. What are some symbols of good and what are some symbols of evil? How might these symbols help the reader to understand the overall theme?\n\n4. Places or settings can also serve as symbols. Think about the various places on the island and what happens in those places. Do any of the specific locations carry symbolic significance in the plot? Explain your answer by considering the process of symbolic action.\n\nSymbolism in Lord of the Flies\n\nThe skull and crossbones. Yin and Yang. The smiley face. As soon as you heard these descriptions, it is likely an image popped into your mind. It is just as likely that the meaning that is generally associated with them also came to mind. That is how symbols work. They are not just arbitrary objects or designs, they represent a larger idea, ideal or concept. The same is true in literature. An author will use symbolism to convey important ideas and messages in the text. In William Golding's classic novel, The Lord of the Flies, symbolic images and objects carry greater meaning than their surface appearance. Let's look at a few of them and think about how the author uses symbolism to support and reinforce the theme of the novel.\n\nThe Island and the Ocean\n\nAs an uncharted, untouched location, the island symbolizes paradise. It is away literally and figuratively, from the destructive nature of humanity. It also symbolizes a Garden of Eden, a pristine and bountiful place where the boys can begin anew. However, much like the biblical Garden of Eden, paradise can be suddenly lost when man is tempted by evil. As the setting of the novel, the symbol of the island is central to the theme that the brutal nature of man destroys what is good. By the end of the novel, this pristine paradise has been set ablaze by the destructive hunters. Ironically, it is only by the island's destruction that the boys are saved. A passing warship sees the fire, comes to investigate and rescues the survivors.\n\nIn many texts, the ocean represents two seemingly opposing ideas. It can represent the fathomless and endless nature of life, where calm can turn to chaos. However, as the site of the beginning of life, it can also represent strength, tranquility and stability, as it has remained largely unchanged throughout time. Given the endless nature of the ocean, it may also represent the possibility for getting lost and then finding one's way in life's journey. In the Lord of the Flies, many of these symbolic representations are present. In the beginning of the novel, the ocean is the vast space separating the boys from all they once knew. Yet, they happily play in its edges, delighted that there are no adults to tell them not to. Later, however, after Simon is killed and his body washes out to sea, the ocean receives him and what he represents: the loss of good to evil impulses.\n\nGolding writes, 'The water rose farther and dressed Simon's coarse hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble.' Here we see a striking similarity to the description of a conventional gravestone, while the symbolism of the ocean represents the end of Simon's journey.\n\nThe Conch Shell & Piggy's Glasses\n\nOf all of the symbols in Lord of the Flies, the conch shell plays a recurrent and important role in reinforcing the theme of savagery versus civilization. From the first chapter through the end of the novel, the conch shell symbolizes civilization and a respect for law and order. It is used to call the boys to their meetings and whoever holds the conch shell is granted the right to speak. Although the conch holds less influence over the boys as they descend deeper into barbarism, Simon, Ralph and Piggy still cling to it as a symbol of order. It is only when Piggy is killed and the conch shell smashed that total anarchy ensues."
