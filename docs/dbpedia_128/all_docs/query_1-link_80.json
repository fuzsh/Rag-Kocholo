        "text": "01/11/2018\n\nFor the first time, Punto de Vista has called upon groups instead of individual filmmakers to make a documentary produced by the festival\n\nThe film groups, Zazpi T’erdi, lacasinegra and Dostopos have been invited to compete in the eighth X Films Project. In its 8th edition, Punto de Vista includes a major new feature in this call, whereby the festival becomes the producer of a documentary film: for the first time, individual filmmakers have not been invited. This is a new thing which is added to others, such as new sections, a new Selection Committee or the redesign of the logo in a year of transition in which Garbiñe Ortega will make her debut as Artistic Director.\n\nThe three invited groups represent the best of the most alternative and groundbreaking film that is being developed on the non-fiction film scene in Spain. Zazpi T’erdi, Lacasinegra and Dostopos have been chosen to raise awareness of their work and, during the festival, present a filmed essay project based geographically in Navarra. This is the only condition that must be fulfilled. They have a free hand for everything else. The X Films Project follows in the wake of the production company created by the entrepreneur and art patron, Juan Huarte, with which it shares a similar purpose: to finance and support film adventures whose starting point is an X for uncertainty.\n\nFurthermore, the festival will host the worldwide premiere of the project selected in 2017, La Cosa Vuestra (Your Thing), in which the filmmaker, María Cañas, proposes a journey towards the most hidden and surrealist side of San Fermin, reflecting on where these festivals in Pamplona are headed.\n\nThe Selection Committee of the eighth edition of The X Films Project will be made up of the Galician film critic, programmer and producer, Martin Pawley, in addition to two other film professionals whose names will be announced shortly. During the festival, they will be responsible for analysing and judging the filmmakers’ proposals by this film groups, who will showcase samples of their previous work in a session that is open to the public and they will defend these new proposals for documentaries filmed in Navarra in another session.\n\nBIOGRAPHIES OF THE SELECTED GROUPS:\n\nLACASINEGRA\n\nlacasinegra is a project that emerged for and from a profound collective consciousness. Perhaps it is a coincidence, perhaps it is through friendship, but the thing is that they only know how to raise their concerns in this space. Up to now, their projects have taken them on very different paths: from the construction of an immediate look at daily life to the creation of audiovisual mapping as well as remixing, reflection on film montage or on relations between learning and audiovisual. However, there is always one premise in all of their work: to reject the answers and raise a new concern which enables them to continue moving forward.\n\nTheir work, which is heavily influenced by the forms of audiovisual consumption on the Internet and the appearance of domestic digital recording devices, materialises in projects such as Expropriations (since 2009), a collection of short films on expropriation; or Anecdotes (since 2009), a series of short pieces that explore reality through single-frame films. They have worked with Centro Centro (Madrid), CCCB (Barcelona), Geneva Contemporary Art Exhibition, the PROGR Foundation (Berne) or the IVAM (Valencia) and have offered workshops at Tabakalera (San Sebastian), Zinemastea (Vitoria), Seville University, Territorios y Fronteras (Bilbao) or Las Naves (Valencia).\n\nIn 2014, they released Pas à Genève, their first feature film, at the Seville Festival. Pas à Genève could be seen at different international festivals and exhibitions, such as Lima Independent (Lima), FestiFreak (Mar del Plata), Márgenes (Madrid) or the Cinema d’Autor (Barcelona) – and now online and free of charge at PLAT. It was also nominated for the Scribe Award 2014.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/lacasinegra\n\nZAZPI T’ERDI\n\nPello Gutiérrez and David Aguilar Iñigo are two filmmaker friends who have worked together under the name of Zazpi t’erdi for the past ten years. Their work moves between documentary, video experimentation and performing arts.\n\nTheir process involves joint work with artists and groups related to the call for what is real. Together, they have directed two documentary films which propose a reflection on collective memory through the eyes of women: Heroínas sem nome (Unnamed Heroines) (2010), which won a Silver Carrot Award at the Malaga Festival, and El Síndrome del Vinagre (The Vinegar Syndrome) (2017), which obtained a special mention from the jury at the 49th Alcances Festival.\n\nIn 2012, they released Biutz, a documentary theatre show on the Melilla border, which was made in conjunction with the French company, Rouge Elea. They are currently on tour with a new theatre production, Heriotza Bikoitza – Double Malta, in which live video is mixed with documentary testimonies.\n\nTheir productions include two films directed by David Aguilar: Nao Yik (2011) and Mara Mara (2016), both of which were premiered at the San Sebastian Festival and exhibited and rewarded at national and international festivals. The short films directed by Pello Gutiérrez: Abuztua (2013) obtained 8 international awards, and Zain, whose premiere is scheduled for 2018.\n\nZazpi t’erdi has produced, filmed and edited the documentary feature film Converso (2017) directed by David Arratibel, as well as his previous film, Oírse (2012). They have organised the Lupa documentary exhibition and the video and music festival, Nokodek, in San Sebastian and Renteria for the past ten years.\n\nwww.zazpiterdi.com\n\nDOSTOPOS\n\nDostopos is a project created by Ana Pfaff and Ariadna Ribas. They both graduated in 2007 from the Film and Audiovisual School of Catalonia (ESCAC), in the speciality of montage. Before completing their studies, they founded Dostopos, where they work on the relationship between music and image in formats such as video-clip, video projection or musical documentary as creators of their own pieces, using techniques such as found footage, animated collage, negative handling or formats, such as super 8 or SD video. They see themselves as collectors. Since 2012, they have given classes in found-footage and animated collage in the Montage Post-Graduate Degree programme at the UPF-BSM.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017 they have made video projections at the Presentation of the Season Gala for the Spanish National Orchestra and Choir (OCNE).Recently, they showed their latest work, Luna cautiva serpiente roja bandeja de plata at L'Alternativa (Barcelona Independent Film Festival). Much of their work can be seen at the Barcelona Contemporary Culture Centre (CCCB).\n\nAs an editor, Ana Pfaff has worked on films such as Estiu 1993 by Carla Simón, ReMine by Marcos M. Merino, El Gran Vuelo by Carolina Astudillo or Els tres porquets by Albert Serra. Ariadna Ribas has participated in productions by Albert Serra since 2012: La mort de Lluís XIV (2016) Singularity (2015), Història de la meva mort (2013), Els tres porquets (2012). She has recently edited Júlia Ist by Elena Martín, Abrázame como antes by Jurgen Ureña, Belén by Adriana Vila or Grab and Run by Roser Corella.\n\nwww.dostopos.info\n\nMARTÍN PAWLEY\n\nMartin Pawley (A Coruña, 1974) is a critic, programmer and film producer (Costa da Morte by Lois Patiño, 2013). He directed the documentary IIusiones visuales (2006) with Marcos Pérez and the experimental short film, Fogos (2017). He is very proud of the film workshops he gives each week at the Metropolitan Forum and the Ágora Centre in A Coruña. Scientific dissemination in the field of astronomy is another of his activities.\n\nX FILMS 2017\n\nLA COSA VUESTRA (YOUR THING)\n\nSPAIN, 2018, 38’\n\nLa Cosa Vuestra is a journey towards the most hidden and surrealist side of the San Fermin festivals. Fun and stark reality working on iconographic cannibalism. What have the San Fermin Festivals become and where are they headed?\n\nThis guerrilla video shows drifting heterodoxies and hybridizations, savage visions and palpitations of the Navarra idiosyncrasy, from the “video machine” and the “laughter technique”. It is a critical montage of the aesthetic, ritual and cultural universe of Pamplona. It is an empowering reflection compared with the violence exerted against women.\n\nLa Cosa Vuestra tries to reinvent imaginaries through activation hacking, video-collage, grotesqueness, futuristic dystopia and the transgression of film, popular culture and the media.\n\nMARÍA CAÑAS\n\nAudiovisual iconoclast, a media savage, she is into guerrilla filmmaking, which she introduces in topics and genres to activate them. She runs Animalario TV Producciones, a creation space devoted to the recycling culture, appropriation and artistic experimentation. She is a firm defender of non-privatisation and the liberalisation of our historic memory and imaginaries and she is an activist committed to the idea of culture as joint construction. She believes in the function of organic archives and audiovisual detritus as tools for cultural development, and in the need to train people to govern themselves and not to be governed by others. Her art has been exhibited at festivals, fairs, museums, national and international art galleries, receiving many awards."
