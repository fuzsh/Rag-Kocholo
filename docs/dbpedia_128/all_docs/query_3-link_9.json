        "text": "It really annoys me when people deride the Last Samurai as a \"white saviour\" film. I don't deny that there are certain films that fall under the category of \"white saviour\" and the most blatant in my memory is \"The Great Wall\" starring Matt Damon, but in my eyes anyone who applies the same label to The Last Samurai is just looking for something to be racist or to offend them.\n\nIf you didn't understand the movie, Nathan Algren is not \"The Last Samurai\" he is just a vessel for the (likely western) audience to witness the story of the Last Samurai, that being Katsumoto. He is not a saviour. In fact the exact opposite is true, he is saved by the Samurai. He goes to Japan depressed, alcoholic and suicidal, and during his time amongst the Samurai they give him a reason to live. The film is a beautiful and respectful showcase of the difference between two different cultures, showing where they differ (e.g. the use of seppuku) and where they are hold common ground (e.g. a warrior spirit). It's a really beautiful and thought provoking film, and I hate when people give such a shallow and dismissive criticism of it just because the main protagonist is white.\n\nEdit: Someone pointed out in the comments that one of the many people \"The Last Samurai\" is based on was a black man. I can't find any evidence of this, the main name that I can find related to the story is of Jules Brunet who was white, however I wouldn't see the film as any lesser if the main character was played by an actor such as Jamie Foxx. So to all the people who say that it is a \"white saviour\" film, would you call it a \"black saviour\" film if nothing changed except for the main character being played by Jamie Foxx instead of Tom Cruise?\n\nEdit 2: I do understand that samurai is also plural, so the title could refer to the last group of samurai, but in my mind I always considered Katsumoto as a stand-in to represent samurai culture as a whole in the same way that Algren is a stand-in for western culture, so that's why I saw Katsumoto as the titular character, but that's just my reading of it."
