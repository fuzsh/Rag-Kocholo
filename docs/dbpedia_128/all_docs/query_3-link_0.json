As Vittorio pursues her through Caracas, she turns for help first to Alex, a previous employer, and then to Martin, a middle-aged French man she meets by chance. Martin drives her to the airport, where she gets a plane ticket to Paris. Returning by boat to his peaceful lonely life on an island off the coast, Martin is surprised and dismayed to find that Nelly has made her way there ahead of him.
