The Under-19 National Team, the current European Champions, drew 2-2 against Sweden in Borås on the final matchday in Group 4 of the Qualifying Round to progress to the Elite Round. The Azzurrini took the lead in the second minute thanks to Simone Pafundi’s fantastic left-footed curling strike from distance, but Sweden then equalised through Adam Stroud after 25 minutes. In the second half, Bernardo Corradi’s side restored their advantage thanks to a penalty from Pafundi (52’) before the hosts drew level through Taha Ayari with six minutes of normal time to go.

It was the match we struggled the most in,” said Head Coach Bernardo Corradi. “Given what we displayed in the first two games, we should have come into this one having already qualified, but that’s football for you. We’ve managed to progress because of a performance full of character. At times, we’ve been excellent and not got what we’ve deserved, whereas we weren’t quite as good today but managed to achieve qualification.”

Italy will be involved in the Elite Round in March and will find out their opponents when the draw takes place on Friday 8 December (11:00 CET) in Nyon.
