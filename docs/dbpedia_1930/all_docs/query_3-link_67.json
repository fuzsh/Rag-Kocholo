        "text": "WARNING: This post includes a mix of personal pride/excitement and a few business lessons learned along the way from someone who never rowed.\n\nOur son arrived in Varese, Italy last evening. A summer abroad after graduating high school? Not quite. I’m very proud to say that he was selected to the 2022 Under 19 US National Rowing Team. He is one of 60 rowers on the U19 US Team that will represent the US in the 2022 World Rowing Under 19 Championships held July 27-31 in Varese. He will be competing in the four with coxswain (4+) event.\n\nI am bursting with pride that he will wear the US colors and have this experience. My wife, daughter, and I are heading to Italy on Monday, with 100+ US parents, to cheer on our athletes. GO TEAM USA!!!\n\nAs an executive and former (very long time ago) athlete, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the life and business lessons to be found in the sport of rowing. I believe rowing truly provides unique insights and comparisons to lessons that can be applied to the management and operations of a business.\n\nLet’s consider four attributes that align between rowing and business:\n\n1. Coordination\n\nIn my son’s boat there are five people. There is a coxswain and four rowers. Each of the rowers holds one oar. The successful boat demonstrates an ability to row perfectly in sync, with no errors, while also pulling harder from beginning to end of the race. The ability to remain in sync between the rowers requires an absolute coordination of their efforts and skill sets. Can you imagine the success of a company that was fully in sync and rowed together throughout each opportunity to execute? Talk about the rarest of unicorn companies...\n\n2. Dedication\n\nWhile my son has rowed typically 4 to 5 days a week for the past 4 years, he has consistently rowed 4+ hours, six days per week, for the past year. That’s roughly over 1,250 hours of practice for an event that lasts under 2 minutes. In this past year, I estimate my son has competed in less than 25 races. That’s the equivalent of 1,250 hours of prep for 2.5 hours of racing (a ratio of 499:1). Is there anything in your life that you are that committed to? Is the Mission of your organization clear and compelling enough for your team to commit and dedicate itself to fulfilling at this level?\n\n3. Communication\n\nThe coxswain is effectively the captain of the boat. The coxswain develops the race plan, sets and adjusts the speed of the boat throughout the race, and adjusts the plan during the race. But, the coxswain does not hold an oar. The coxswain communicates the vision and direction for the boat and the first rower in the boat, the ‘stroke seat’, translates those directions into the actual rowing. Each rower behind the stroke seat watches the rower in front of them and matches their pace. If the communication breaks down between any rower or an individual rower errors in their technique, the boat can ‘catch a crab’ where an oar enters the water inappropriately and the boat’s momentum is immediately impacted. Is the vision from your executive team crystal clear so that every member of the organization understands their role? Does everyone in the company know the goal and direction of the organization and are dedicated to getting their together? Are your CEO and executive team good coxswains?\n\n4. Trust\n\nDid I mention the rowers are going backwards? The coxswain is the only person in the boat looking in the direction the boat is traveling. She (or he) controls a small rudder under the boat, which the strength of the rowers can easily overpower. Each rower has to believe that the coxswain is steering the boat correctly and the rowers are in sync to the point where they are headed in a straight line. Does your organization have that level of trust between management and staff or amongst departments? Does the company trust that management is not going to run the company into a bridge, onto the shore, or simply into the company competing next to you?\n\nOne additional comment related to diversity, equity, and inclusiveness. I absolutely love that the coxswain of our U19 4+ boat is an incredibly talented young lady from Connecticut. She is also the coxswain of the 8+ national championship boat. It is wonderful to see the respect that the rowers show her and the leadership she provides over this boat - on and off the water. I know that rowing has helped to reinforce and teach my son that there is no seat on any boat for discrimination or exclusion.\n\nMy executive team is probably growing sick of my rowing analogies that I apply to our company. As the coxswain of our business (really bad comparison being 6’ 8”, but keep reading - you're almost at the end of this regatta), I am truly fortunate to have an executive team, leadership team, and company that strives to be coordinated, is fully dedicated, communicates well, and demonstrates a high level of trust. Similar to our US Rowing team that is comprised of athletes from 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, our diverse company team has come together for a singular purpose: Grow a successful company that supports healthcare and the health of communities across our country. We are training and rowing furiously to achieve this Mission.\n\nIn a time when there seems to be so much divisiveness in our country and world, I love how the support of our national team can bring us together. I appreciate any opportunity to put down our differences, to raise our flag, and support Team USA! As a proud father, thank you for reading my post and supporting our athletes. As a fortunate CEO, thank you to my wonderfully talented team – I am so lucky to be in your boat! As a patriotic American headed to Italy to cheer our boys and girls as they compete for a world championship… USA! USA! USA!"
