        "text": "Immediately after the draw for two European cups, the draw for the qualifications for the 2024 European Men’s U19 Championships was staged in Barceloneta.\n\nEven 20 teams will participate in the qualifications. Among them are several teams that have never played in the European U19 Championships qualifications or were absent from the international stage in the past years.\n\n2024 European Men’s U19 Championships, qualifications\n\nGroup A (host Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nFrance, Czech Republic, Great Britain, Finland and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n\nGroup B (host Slovenia)\n\nGeorgia, Turkiye, Slovenia, Switzerland, Sweden.\n\nGroup C (host Poland)\n\nMalta, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Ireland\n\nGroup D (host Romania)\n\nNetherlands, Romania, Ukraine, Lithuania, Cyprus.\n\nThe qualification tournaments are scheduled for the middle of March (March 15 – 18). The group winners and 2nd-placed teams will qualify for the 2024 European U19 Championships.\n\nThe European Championships will be held in Burgas (Bulgaria) between September 1st and 7th. Since Bulgaria is qualified as a host, if the Bulgarians don’t finish the competition in Group C in 1st or 2nd place, only the winner of the tournament in Poland will secure its ticket for Burgas.\n\nBesides the host, the top 8 teams at the 2022 European U19 Championships are already qualified: Serbia, Spain, Hungary, Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, Italy, and Germany.\n\nMore than two teams target the top two places in each group, and it isn’t easy to predict the outcome. Still, the teams that were in the first pot of the draw (France, Georgia, Malta, and the Netherlands) are the favorites. These four nations have participated in almost all age-group European Championships in the last several years,\n\nThe European U19 Championships for girls will take place in Zagreb (Croatia) the same week as the men’s tournament in Burgas (September 1 – 7). There will be no qualifications for the Championships in Zagreb. All teams that entered the competition will play at the tournament in the capital of Croatia.\n\nMore articles about the European Men’s U19 Championships"
