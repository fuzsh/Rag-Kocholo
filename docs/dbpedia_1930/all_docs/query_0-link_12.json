These men (no women have been selected) will serve as fourth officials or reserve assistant referees. The full list of names is below.\n\nIrfan Peljto (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nSenad Ibrisimbegovic (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nDonatas Rumsas (Lithuania)\n\nAleksandr Radius (Lithuania)\n\nSerdar Gozubuyuk (Netherlands)\n\nJohan Balder (Netherlands)\n\nEspen Eskas (Norway)\n\nJan Erik Engan (Norway)\n\nRade Obrenovic (Sweden)\n\nJure Praprotnik (Sweden)\n\nMykola Balakin (Ukraine)\n\nOleksandr Berkut (Ukraine)\n\nEnglishmen referees at Euro 2024\n\nIn total, there will be eight English officials involved at Euro 2024. Premier League refereeing standards have come under fire in recent months - in large part due to the use of VAR - but the UEFA Referees’ Committee has chosen the following Englishmen to work at the upcoming tournament.\n\nMichael Oliver\n\nStuart Burt\n\nDan Cook\n\nAnthony Taylor\n\nGary Beswick\n\nAdam Nunn\n\nStuart Atwell\n\nDavid Coote\n\nVARs (video assistant referees) in Euro 2024\n\nThe video assistant referee (VAR) system debuted at Euro 2020 and will be in place again at this year’s tournament. It gives the on-field referee more information than he would have otherwise.\n\nThree video match officials will be assigned to each game. Their job is to review the on-field referee’s decisions with the aid of television replays. They can then advise the referee to reconsider his original decision, but the final word belongs to the on-field official. In theory, at least, interventions are only made for “clear and obvious errors”.\n\nThe full list of video assistant referees picked for Euro 2024 can be found below.\n\nStuart Attwell (England)\n\nDavid Coote (England)\n\nJerome Brisard (France)\n\nWilly Delajod (France)\n\nBastian Dankert (Germany)\n\nChristian Dingert (Germany)\n\nMarco Fritz (Germany)\n\nMassimiliano Irrati (Italy)\n\nPaolo Valeri (Italy)\n\nRob Dieperink (Netherlands)\n\nPol van Boekel (Netherlands)\n\nBartosz Frankowski (Poland)\n\nTomasz Kwiatkowski (Poland)\n\nTiago Martins (Portugal)\n\nCatalin Popa (Romania)\n\nNejc Kajtazovic (Slovenia)\n\nAlejandro Jose Hernandez Hernandez (Spain)\n\nJuan Martinez Munuera (Spain)\n\nFedayi San (Switzerland)\n\nAlper Ulusoy (Turkey)\n\nHow are UEFA Euro 2024 referees selected?\n\nThe 19 referees chosen for Euro 2024 were picked by the UEFA Referees’ Committee. Prominent officials from across Europe had their performances analysed by experts throughout the 2023/24 club season, culminating in their selection for the event in Germany.\n\n\"UEFA EURO 2024 is the pinnacle of European national team football with the best football teams competing and that’s why we have selected the best referees to officiate these matches,” said Roberto Rosetti, the head of the aforementioned committee.\n\n“All chosen referees have performed consistently to the highest standards in UEFA’s top competitions, and also in their domestic competitions. They have prepared exceptionally well to be in this position and we have full confidence in them to show their quality at the final tournament.”\n\nThe role and responsibilities of referees\n\nWithout referees, there would be no football. It is regrettable that officials today are often subjected to abuse from players, coaches, fans and social media users. It is a difficult job and referees deserve more respect from everyone who cares about the most popular sport in the world.\n\nTo all intents and purposes, a referee’s primary role is to apply the laws of the game to the match they are in charge of. This involves awarding free-kicks and penalties when offences are committed, signalling for goal-kicks, corners and throw-ins when the ball is out of play, and showing yellow and red cards when appropriate.\n\nReferees are helped by two assistants on the touchlines and the fourth official in the dugout. When the video assistant referee believes the referee has made a “clear and obvious error”, he invites the official to review his decision with the aid of television replays.\n\nTo encourage fair play and mutual respect between players and officials, the team captain will have key decisions explained to him by the referee. UEFA hopes that this innovation will improve the image of the game.\n\nEuro 2024 referee fees\n\nThe officials involved at Euro 2024 will be paid on a per-game basis. The table below illustrates how much money the referees, assistant referees, fourth officials and video assistant referees receive.\n\nNotable referees in Euro history\n\nRefereeing is a thankless task. Officials are expected to get every major decision right and they tend to be criticised much more than they are praised.\n\nThere are exceptions, though. Here are three notable referees from the history of the European Championship.\n\nPierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\nA referee with a no-nonsense manner who was full of confidence and always in full control of the fixtures he oversaw, Pierluigi Collina is widely regarded as the best referee in football history. The Italian man was involved in a series of matches at the European Championships in 2000 and 2004, and his performances were often given full marks.\n\nMarkus Merk (Germany)\n\nMarkus Merk called the shots in the opening game of Euro 2000 and the final of Euro 2004. A dentist away from the football field, the German was recognised as one of the top-quality referees by UEFA throughout his career in the game. His approach to refereeing was popular with virtually every player, whether a goalkeeper or outfield player.\n\nArthur Ellis (England)\n\nArthur Ellis belonged to the first generation of referees who became household names. He was in the centre of the pitch for the first ever European Championship final in 1960, when the Soviet Union beat Yugoslavia 2-1. The English official also worked at the 1950, 1954 and 1958 World Cups.\n\nWant some Euro offers?

Each referee works with two assistant referees, a fourth official, a reserve assistant referee at the stadium, and a team of three video match officials.\n\nIs there an age limit for referees in Euro 2024?\n\nTo take charge of a Euro 2024 match, referees must have been at least 25 years old on January 1. There is no longer an upper age limit, although officials regularly undergo technical and physical assessments to ensure they are still up to the job.\n\nWhich referee gives out the most red cards?\n\nOf the 19 officials set to work at Euro 2024, Halil Umut Meler of Turkey averages the most red cards per game at 0.48. Many will see that as a sign that he is not shy in sending players off.\n\nWill VAR be used in Euro 2024?\n\nFor the second edition of the tournament in a row, VAR will be used at Euro 2024. Not everyone is content with the system, but regardless of the rights and wrongs VAR is not going anywhere.\n\nEach video assistant referee will work closely with two assistant video assistant referees and three video operators. UEFA has overseen the construction of four video operations rooms in Leipzig that will be used throughout the competition. That ensures there will be links between the VAR team and the match officials at all times. In most cases, English will be the language of communication between them.\n\nThe Var and the referee do not always see eye to eye. When such instances occur, the latter makes the final decision.\n\nRead more about Copa America 2024\n\nCopa America 2024 betting tips\n\nCopa America 2024 top scorer predictions\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.
