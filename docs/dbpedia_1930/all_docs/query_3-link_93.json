        "text": "It was a complete performance from the Netherlands' as it flexed muscles on attack and defense in a 30-26 win against Hungary.\n\nLois Abbingh and Angela Malestein led the Dutch in scoring with seven and six goals, respectively, while goalkeeper Yara Ten Holte impressively saved 40% of the shots taken at her.\n\nOn the bright side for Hungary, the result was still enough for the team to advance to the quarterfinals, placing in third place in Group B. Netherlands finished in second and will also advance.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nHost France continued its dominant run in the preliminary round, this time thrashing Spain 32-24.\n\nAfter taking a commanding eight-goal lead heading into the second half thanks to its free-flowing attack, France was able to cruise to its victory as Alicia Toublanc (six goals) and Pauletta Foppa (five goals) led the team in scoring.\n\nFrance had already secured its spot in the quarterfinals in the previous preliminary round, while Spain was unable to collect any points as the team remained winless throughout the tournament.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nBrazil advanced to the quarterfinals in style after defeating Angola, 30-19.\n\nBoth teams needed a win to move on to the quarterfinals, but it was Brazil's quick and lethal attack that propelled the South Americans onto the next round.\n\nBrazil's defense was also able to limit Angola to only six goals in the first half and 13 in the second as goalkeeper Gabriela Moreschi saved nearly half the shots thrown at her.\n\nThe result eliminated Angola from the tournament.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nSweden secured its spot in the quarterfinals with a strong performance Saturday, topping Slovenia 27-23.\n\nOn paper, it was the Swede's game to lose as they entered the match with three wins already under their belt. After entering halftime trailing Slovenia by three, the Swedish dominated the second half and outscored their opponents by seven to take the win.\n\nThe fast-attacking Swedish offense overpowered Slovenia, carrying a 7-0 fast break advantage. Slovenia also struggled in goal, with Amra Pandzic only able to save 23% of Sweden's shots on goal.\n\nThe loss drops the Slovenians to the bottom of Group A, eliminating them from quarterfinals contention.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nNorway entered the game with its spot in the quarterfinals set, but that didnâ€™t stop the Nordic nation from steamrolling Germany, 30-18.\n\nA pair of early two minutes suspensions for Norway allowed the Germans to jump out to a quick 3-0 lead. However, Norway responded with seven unanswered goals and never looked back.\n\nHenny Reistad led the way for Norway, scoring eight goals on just 10 shots, while Stine Oftedal added four tallies of her own.\n\nGermany still had a shot to advance through to the quarterfinals, but needed to wait for the results of the other group stage games and hope their place in the standings held. With South Korea's loss to Denmark, Germany took the last spot and just squeaked through to the quarterfinals.\n\nMATCH STATS\n\nSouth Korea could have claimed its spot in the quarterfinals with a win, but Denmark showed no mercy, rolling to a 28-20 victory.\n\nAt halftime there was still hope for South Korea, only trailing by four goals. However, 15 minutes later, Denmark ballooned its lead to 10 and rode that lead to an easy win.\n\nAnne Mette Hansen was unstoppable for Denmark, scoring on all six shots she took. Kristina Joergensen was also incredibly efficient, adding six goals on 10 shots in the game.\n\nDenmark already had a spot in the quarterfinals before the game kicked off, but with the loss, South Korea was sent packing from Paris.\n\nMATCH STATS"
