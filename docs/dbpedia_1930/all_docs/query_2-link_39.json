Each year, for more than 25,000 players and leaders this dream comes true.\n\nInternational football\n\nWe believe that matches against other countries broaden the minds of young players and enhance their knowledge of the game. The chance to play against other cultures, religions, and walks of life will give vital experiences that will benefit their performance moving forward. We want Gothia Cup to be an avenue for the football youth of the world.\n\nEvery match is exciting, and challenging and leaves an everlasting memory, regardless of the score. In Gothia Cup, at least 80% of boys matches will be played by teams from different countries.
