        "text": "The men’s beach volleyball field at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 has been narrowed down following the four quarter-finals matches held 6 and 7 August at Champ de Mars under the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe semi-finals on Thursday, 8 August will see the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists Qatar against Sweden and the defending Olympic champions Norway vs. Germany.\n\nGermany wins 2-0 over Netherlands\n\nThe fired-up German team of Nils Ehlers and Clemens Wickler enlisted a fierce jump set to advance past the Netherlands duo of Stefan Boermans and Yorrick De Groot marching into the semi-finals.\n\n“The way we started, the fighting spirit, we did really good,\" said Boermans. \"We came back in the first set and we wanted to improve from there. Unfortunately, we didn't and they played better. They deserved the win.”\n\nSweden wins 2-0 over Brazil\n\nSweden’s Jonatan Hellvig and David Ahman comprehensively beat Brazil’s Evandro Goncalves Oliveira Junior, competing in his third Olympics, and Arthur Diego Mariano Lanci. Despite Goncalves Oliveira Junior smashing the fastest serve of the day at 94km/h, this quarter-final match saw the 22-year-old Swedes at their best, knocking out the Brazilian men’s pair in straight sets with their lethal “Swedish jump-set.”\n\nFollowing the match, the Brazilians admitted that the “old-school” Brazilian style has “to evolve” if they want to remain a force at the top of men’s beach volleyball.\n\nNorway wins 2-0 over Spain\n\nDefending champions, Norway’s Anders Berntsen Mol and Christian Sandlie Soerum, ensured there would be no fairy-tale farewell for Spain’s Pablo Herrera Allepuz in his sixth and final Olympic Games. He and his partner Adrian Gavira Collado were defeated in straight sets by the Norwegian duo, who powered through the match and into the semi-finals.\n\nThe 42-year-old Herrera Allepuz was adamant that for him, this was the end. “I think you have to finish on a high, you have to know when to do it, so I think I have done it well,” he said.\n\nQatar wins 2-0 over USA\n\nQatar’s experienced duo of Cherif Younousse and Ahmed Tijan, who finished with bronze at Tokyo 2020, got the better of Americans Miles Partain and Andrew Benesh, both first-time Olympians with a 2-0 victory.\n\nBenesh felt good about their inaugural Olympic performance, saying, “When you get to the quarterfinals, everyone here is a really class team. We have probably learned more from this tournament than any we have played. That will help us, going forward. We are proud of the way we played.”"
