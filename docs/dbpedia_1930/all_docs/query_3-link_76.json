Viewers can expect a loud crowd as the game is located only 115km (71 miles) from the border between the two Scandinavian nations.\n\nQuarterback Max Lambert and running back Vilgot Valeskog are Sweden’s most dynamic players on offense, while Elliot Lindehammer will be Lambert’s go-to guy in passing situations today.\n\nHead coach Sebastian Brinkenfeldt’s defense will rely on talented linebacker Benjamin Kennedy Chaanhing along with defensive back Rory Nethercott, who is again the team’s captain as he was back in the 2022 tournament.\n\nWatch the game live outside Sweden and Denmark here on AFI.tv: Team Denmark @ Team Sweden, April 9, 14:00 CET (2 pm, 8 am EDT)\n\nDenmark is led by head coach Victor E. Andersen, who brings a deep squad of Danish talent on the road. Receivers Due Moller (Copenhagen Towers) and Westergaard Andersen (Triangle Razorbacks) were impact players last season in the Danish National League (Senior League) and could be impactful in today’s game.\n\nDefensively, Valdemar Enghave and Barkholt Fruelund are two versatile defenders who need to contain a run-heavy Swedish offense if they want to pull off the road win today.\n\nWatch the game live outside Sweden and Denmark here on AFI.tv: Team Denmark @ Team Sweden, April 9, 14:00 CET (2 pm, 8 am EDT)"
