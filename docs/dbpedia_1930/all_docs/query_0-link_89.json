        "text": "BRANDENBURG - The list of players for the European championships in all disciplines, which will be played in the Stahlpalast in Brandenburg an der Havel from April 28 to May 7, is published by the organization. The tournament starts with the main discipline, three cushion, where Torbjörn Blomdahl defends his European title from 28 to 30th April. The Dutch team with Dick Jaspers and Raimond Burgman is the title holder in three cushion for national teams. The tournament will bw closed by the 5 pins on 6 and 7th of May. The ladies won't participate in this European championship.\n\nCEB sports director Jean-Pierre Guiraud, who's facing a tough job with his team at the mega-event, also published the schedules for the juniors these days, when all disciplines were completed. The juniors under 21 in three cushion play their tournament together with the seniors from 28 to 30th April.\n\nJean Pierre Guiraud's tournament information:\n\nX Tournament over ten days\n\nX More than 800 matches\n\nX More than 500 participants\n\nX Participants from 20 countries\n\nX Prize money over 100.000 euros\n\nX Twelve match tables, 8 small tables\n\nX Twelve individual championships\n\nX Four team championships\n\nX Sixty referees\n\nThe European president Bennie Deegens concludes that the preparations are excellent. He points to the new system of automatic registrations, for which Jean-Pierre Guiraud and his team did a great job. ,,We made a big step with the innovation.'' Furthermore, Bennie Deegens assures that, on the organizational level, Helga Blawid with her team in Brandenburg are invaluable for the event. ,,They do amongst others most of the negotiations with the town of Brandenburg, businesses and sponsors.''\n\nThe sponsorship of the city and the business is slightly reversed. ,,That's what we worry about'', says Deegens. ,,The billiard-related companies currently focus very much on Korea and China, leaving the budget in Europe slightly reversed.''\n\n,,The European federations, according to the agreements made six years ago, are obliged to support us. Since then, a significant part of the budget is coming from our members. That's what we agreed. We organize this European championship every two years to continue and to encourage the basis of billiards.
