        "text": "U.S. coach 'devastated' for his team\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia — Team USA coach Vlatko Andonovski said he was \"devastated\" for his team after the Sweden loss.\n\n“I see the players in tears, it hurts,” he told a news conference after his team crashed out on penalties. “If I have to coach this and this team again, I’d do it all again,” he added. “I love them all ... they’re my friends.”\n\nAndonovski, who appeared on the verge of tears himself, added there were five players in his team that had never played at a World Cup before.\n\nAs for veteran Megan Rapinoe, who unexpectedly missed a penalty in the shootout, he said she was \"a legend.\"\n\nTeam USA is out but the tournament continues tomorrow\n\nTeam USA may be out but the tournament will carry on tomorrow, when host Australia takes on Denmark and England faces Nigeria.\n\nIt will be an early start for England's fans as the game kicks off at 3:30 a.m. ET. Along with Japan and Sweden, the “Lionesses” were undefeated in the group stage.\n\nThe “Matildas,” which lost lost 3-2 to Nigeria in the group stage, will kick off at 6:30 a.m. ET.\n\nLoss is 'a bad dream,' Alex Morgan says\n\nLong-time U.S. star Alex Morgan said she was in a state of disbelief, knowing her side was going home without winning a knockout match.\n\n“I’m just devastated, it feels like a bad dream,” Morgan told Fox Sports after the 5-4 loss in penalties to Sweden.\n\n“I feel like we dominated,” she said, adding that the loss “doesn’t feel great.”\n\nMorgan played a strong game before the 34-year-old was subbed out in favor of fellow veteran Megan Rapinoe.\n\n“It’s a tough one to swallow,” Morgan said.\n\nTeam USA coach praises his players 'bravery' after loss\n\nTeam USA coach Vlatko Andonovski defended the team, saying his players turned in their best effort of the tournament — even if they were eliminated.\n\n“I know we were criticized for different moments in the group stage,” he said. “I think we came out today and showed what we’re all about, showed the grit, the resilience, the fight, the bravery.”\n\nThe U.S. had the best of play for 120 minutes but couldn't score a goal and the game was tied 0-0 at the end of extra time. Sweden advanced in penalties, 5-4.\n\n“Unfortunately soccer can be cruel sometimes,” Andonovski said.\n\nAlmost 28,000 people attended the game\n\nAlmost 28,000 people traveled to the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium to watch today's game, stadium officials said.\n\nMore than 1.5 million tickets to games in the tournament have been sold, breaking the record set by Canada at the Women’s World Cup in 2015, according to FIFA.\n\nMatch attendance is also up 54% on round of 16 matches when France hosted in 2019, the governing body said.\n\nAn 'emotional' Julie Ertz fights back the tears\n\nU.S. veteran Julie Ertz fought through tears, summing up the end of this World Cup for the Americans and perhaps her final appearance on this grand stage.\n\n“For me it’s just emotional because it’s probably my last game ever being able to have the honor to wear this crest,” Ertz told Fox Sports.\n\nErtz, 31, praised her teammates for playing their best game of the tournament.\n\n“I mean it’s tough,” she said. “Obviously we’re proud of the way we played but we didn’t put anything in the back of the net.”\n\nA fraction of a centimeter: Team USA crashes out of the World Cup\n\nMinutes after Sweden eliminated the United States 5-4 on penalties, American goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher was still gesturing at her net in an apparent belief that she had saved the match-ending kick.\n\nNaeher appeared to stop Sweden's Lina Hurtig but the video assistant referee showed the ball barely crossed the line as America crashed out in the round of 16, its earliest World Cup exit ever.\n\nHeartbreak in Melbourne!\n\nKelley O'Hara hit the goal post before Sweden's s Lina Hurtig converted as the Americans crashed out of the World Cup round of 16.\n\nIt's the earliest World Cup exit for the Americans, who had won the past two tournaments.\n\nAmericans Sophia Smith and Megan Rapinoe had earlier missed from the spot.\n\nBad Swedish memories\n\nBack in 2016, Sweden defeated the United States on penalties at the Rio Olympics and went on to win silver.\n\nAfterwards U.S. keeper Hope Solo called the Swedes “cowards” and accused them of playing for the penalties.\n\nPenalties will settle the match\n\nThe most cruel tiebreaker in all of sports has arrived.\n\nThe United States and Sweden could not score a goal in 120 minutes, forcing the teams into penalties. The winner will advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nBuckle up, America.\n\nDouble change for Team USA\n\nWith less than a minute remaining Coach Vlatko Andonovski brings on Emily Fox and Emily Sonnett for Kelley O’Hara and Kristie Mewis.\n\nExtra time kicks off\n\nHere we go. Fifteen minutes to find a winner.\n\nHalf time of extra time\n\nStill we await a breakthrough. After 15 minutes the teams remain deadlocked. Fifteen minutes left before the dreaded penalty kicks.\n\nDouble save keeps game tied\n\nAnother lovely break from Team USA. Lynn Williams' drives into the box but Zecira Musovic gets down brilliantly to push her shot out.\n\nLindsey Horan turns and shoots but there's Musovic again to keep the game tied.\n\nRapinoe comes onto the field\n\nShe's saved Team USA on multiple occasions. Can she do it again?\n\nMegan Rapinoe subbed in by Coach Vlatko Andonovski for Alex Morgan.\n\nGreat low drive from Morgan\n\nAlex Morgan drives into the box and hits a lovely low shot. But there's Zecira Musovic again and she palms the ball out for a corner.\n\nAlex Morgan didn't want overtime\n\nU.S. veteran Alex Morgan nearly ended it regulation with a header at close range that forced a diving stop Zecira Musovic stop in the 89th minute.\n\nThrough 90 minutes, the Americans outshot the Swedes, 13-6, and have more shots on target, 6-1.\n\nA U.S. elimination would seem particularly cruel at this point.\n\nExtra time underway\n\nAnd we're off. The first 15-minute half of extra time is underway.\n\nExtra time on the way\n\nWith neither team able to break the deadlock, Stephanie Frappart blows the whistle. Here comes another 30 minutes of extra time.\n\nUnbelievable save from Sweden's goalkeeper\n\nGreat cross from Lynn Williams and a bullet header from Alex Morgan, but Zecira Musovic produces another great save to keep the game tied.\n\nSweden makes its first shot on target\n\nU.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher came up big with her first save of the match, stopping Sofia Jakobsson's shot from the right side of the box in the 85th minute.\n\nSweden make first substitutions\n\nCaptain Kosovare Asllani and Johanna Rytting Kanery are taken off and on come Sofia Jakobsson and Lina Hurtig.\n\nU.S. keeping up the pressure but goal remains elusive\n\nEntering the 70th minute, the United States can smell a potential match-turning goal.\n\nThe Americans are outshooting the Swedes, 8-2, and have the match's only three shots on target.\n\nBut it's still, 0-0.\n\nU.S. makes first subsitution\n\nLynn Williams comes on for Trinity Rodman who had an excellent game.\n\nGambling money following the United States\n\nGamblers like the U.S. chances of advancing to the quarterfinals.\n\nEarly in the second half, the Americans are -220 picks to move through, meaning a bettor would need to risk $2.20 to profit $1, according to FanDuel.\n\nEntering Sunday's match, the United States was -176 pick.\n\nTremedous strike from Horan\n\nA lovely cross from the right and Lindsey Horan strikes the ball perfectly with her right foot.\n\nIt looks destined for the bottom corner but an outstretched Zecira Musovic dives and makes a terrific save. So close again!\n\nU.S. fans outnumbered but confident\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia — Sitting behind the Swedish goal, the sea of yellow was energetic at the halftime break.\n\nBut the small pockets of red, white and blue were all smiles.\n\n“So much better than last time!” one fan yells. “We’re peppering their goal. We feel good.”\n\nSecond half kicks off\n\nAnd the second half is underway.\n\nAmericans will have the happier dressing room at halftime\n\nThe scoreboard belies what's been a near-dominant first 45 minutes of play by the United States.\n\nThe Americans are outshooting Sweden, 5-2, and have the match's only two efforts on target, both by Trinity Rodman. Lindsey Horan’s header also found the crossbar in the 34th minute.\n\nPossession has been favor of the United States, 52% to 34%.\n\nEntering Sunday's play, Sweden had outscored its opponents, 9-1, in three matches, but so far they haven't really threatened.\n\nReferee blows for halftime\n\nAfter two minutes of injury time, French referee Stephanie Frappart blows the whistle and its 0-0 at halftime.\n\nDenied by the crossbar\n\nA beautiful corner met perfectly by Lindsey Horan but her header crashes off the crossbar with the whole Team USA bench on their feet. So close!\n\nAnother great strike from Rodman\n\nTrinity Rodman again. The forward breaks into the right side of Sweden's box and fires a great shot. But Zecira Musovic makes a super save to deny her.\n\nU.S. asking early questions\n\nThe goal-starved Americas have asked most of the questions through the first 20 minutes of play.\n\nTrinity Rodham fired the match's only attempt on goal and the U.S. had the early edge in possession.\n\nStinging shot from Rodman\n\nTrinity Rodman drives at the Swedish defence before hitting a powerful shot. But it's straight at Swedish goalkeeper Zecira Musovic who punches it away.\n\nSmith and Morgan link up nicely\n\nSophia Smith and Alex Morgan are linking up nicely down the right for Team USA but Sweden have defended well so far.\n\nThree U.S players need need to avoid yellow cards\n\nNaomi Girma, Lindsey Horan and Sophia Smith of Team USA and Olivia Schough of Sweden need to be careful.\n\nAll of them have been booked with yellow cards in previous games and if they get one today they will miss the quarterfinal match against Japan if their team makes it today.\n\nTeams keep things tight early on\n\nAs both teams find their feet there is some scrappy play in midfield. U.S. Co-Captain Alex Morgan burst into the box but couldn't get a shot away. Andi Sullivan also goy a shot in but it went wide.\n\nU.S. fans nervous but bouyant ahead of the game\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia — Ahead of the game some Team USA fans were nervous about the team's prospects.\n\nFiona Hollowell told NBC News she travelled with her parents to Melbourne from Asheville, North Carolina.\n\n“I’m nervous for the team.
