        "text": "Graphic: Igor Lazarevic\n\nTeam Sweden will be attempting to reach their second straight IFAF U19 European Championship final today when they take on a dangerous Team France squad at the Ravelin Footballzentrum in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe last time these two teams met was in 2019 when Sweden eked out a narrow 7-0 win over France in the 2019 tournament.\n\nTeam Sweden is the reigning Nordic champion and finished second in the 2019 tournament in Bologna, Italy where they lost to Austria in the title game. Team Sweden’s head coach, Sebastian Brinkenfeldt, has returned for his second stint after leading Sweden to the silver medal in 2019.\n\nUnder head coach Brinkenfeldt, Team Sweden enters the game with a 38-man roster led by quarterbacks Carl Östman and Max Lambert. Other key players for Sweden include linebacker Caesar Winsnes, wide receiver Oliver Langlais, defensive back Rory Nethercott, and offensive lineman Alexander Pellikka.\n\nTeam France were bronze medalists in the 2019 tournament after beating Denmark in the third-place game, 42-15. France has one of the best records in the biennial tournament since its inception in 1992. The French have won the U19 European Championship title twice, 2004 and 2006, finished second five times, 1992, 1998, 2011, 2013 and 2017*. Team France also wound up third in 2008 and finished fourth in 1994, 2002 and 2015.\n\nFrench national team head coach, Emmanuel Maguet, has picked the majority of his 45-man roster players from the two well-known football academies of Amiens and Bordeaux. They are led by quarterbacks Antoine Lefebvre and Dimitri Vercaigne.\n\nClick here for team rosters\n\nWatch the game live here. Team Sweden vs Team France, July 7, 11:00 CET (11 am, 05:00 am ET)"
