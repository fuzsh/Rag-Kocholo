        "text": "The 11th Women’s U19 World Floorball Championships ended on Sunday in Lahti, Finland. This is the 8th gold medal for Sweden at the Women’s U19 WFC.\n\nIt was a very even start from both teams. The main focus was on not making an early mistake. Eleven minutes into the game Finland had the big opportunity to score as they almost had 30 seconds to play with two players more. But both penalities against the Swedish team could not be used to find the back of the net. It got worse for Finland – just six seconds before the end of the first period it was All-Star-Team member Mira Markstrom who opened the score for Sweden.\n\nFinland insisted in trying to find the best scoring opportunities but it was Ellen Lundin who managed to put the ball into the net. The Finish team continued with a lot of discipline to execute their game plan but also did not manage to overcome the Swedish goalkeeper Louranna Jakobsson for the rest of the period. Sweden’s biggest chance to score was a penalty shot which was missed by Mira Markstrom.\n\nThe story of the third period seemed to be told quickly. Finland was applying plenty of pressure but could not manage to find an early goal to bring back any hope to change the nature of this game. It was Elin Dominicus who scored the third goal for Sweden. Only seven minutes later it was Mira Markstrom who scored her second goal of the day. Finland scored their first goal only five minutes before the end; Iida Sinkko reacts quicker than her opponents on a loose ball. It was Elsa Holopainen who scored just another goal for Finland two minutes later. Finland kept substituting the goalkeeper for an additional player however, they could not manage to narrow goal difference further. Therefore it was Sweden who claims another gold medal at the Women’s U19 WFC.\n\nFinal SWE- FIN 4-2\n\nBest players: Louranna Jakobsson (SWE) & Julia Saarinen (FIN)\n\nGame statistics final\n\nWomen’s U19 WFC 2024 statistics"
