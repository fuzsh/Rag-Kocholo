        "text": "All of United’s shots on target were within the Villa box yet all were poor quality. Two were from Greenwood (xG of 0.10 and 0.09) one from Pogba ( xG of 0.03) and one from Maguire (xG 0.02). Ronaldo and Cavani, later brought on, managed one shot off target between them. United’s chance with the highest xG was Fernandes’s penalty (0.76). United were obviously going to dominate possession and so needed to create good quality chances. Had it not been for the penalty United’s xG for a match in which they had 65% possession and 28 shots would have been only 1.17.\n\n‘McFred’ completed 54 passes between them. 27 went forward, which doesn’t seem too bad, but only 10 were in the final third. And as far as destroying goes, they managed only 4 tackles between them and 1 intervention.\n\nThis also meant that, again, Pogba was played on the left of the attacking midfield three. In a previous blog I pointed out how Pogba had flourished playing deeper in midfield against Wolves and Newcastle United. Against Newcastle by himself he completed nearly double (106) the total managed by ‘McFred’ against Villa. Playing Pogba further forward also completely negates one of his best weapons: precise long passes perfect for a pacey forward such as Greenwood, Sancho or a fit Rashford. Against Villa, Pogba had an expected assist of only 0.10 as opposed to 1.58 against Newcastle.\n\nGreenwood did attempt 7 take-ons against Villa but it’s common sense that two pacey wingers would have given the Villains more to think about.\n\nThe decision by the Premier League to revert back to three substitutions last season didn’t make sense and it still doesn’t. The repercussions were felt in this match. After picking a conservative starting line-up Solskjaer then had to ‘spend’ two of his three substitutions on defenders due to injuries: Dalot for Shaw and Lindelöf for Maguire. This decision meant that as United continued to dominate the match yet struggle to break Villa down Solskjaer had only one more substitution to win the game.\n\nIn the 81st minute, he took off McTominey for Cavani. Cavani, like Ronaldo, is mostly a box-based forward. United, therefore, had two forwards sitting in the box yet no way of increasing their service. And in doing so Lingard, scorer of two goals in his previous two United appearances, and £166 million of investment in Sancho, van de Beek and Martial remained on the bench. Of course, rather than replacing Shaw and Maguire like for like Solskjaer could have brought on another midfielder and changed formation. All in all, Solskjaer’s changes lacked imagination.\n\nIt’s tempting to think that with five substitutions allowed two of those players would have been brought on. The amount of talent and expenditure Solskjaer isn’t turning to is piling up. To have van de Beek sitting on the bench is bad enough. To have Sancho there after all the hassle of his transfer would be a tragedy.\n\nAs it was this wasn’t a ‘bad’ match to lose as Liverpool and Chelsea also dropped points. And, had Bruno scored, the narrative could have been of resilient United fighting to the end. As it was this was a defeat born out of the perfect storm of a poor team choice and a mixture of bad luck and lack of imagination when it came to substitutions.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Understat , the Manchester United smartphone app and TheStatZone\n\nFootball, like life, is full of those ‘sliding doors’ moments. What if Ali Bin Nasser had spotted Diego Maradona’s handball against England in 1986 and sent him off with the score kept at 0-0? What if Paul Gascoigne had not checked his run when Alan Shearer played the ball across to him against Germany in 1996? The butterfly effect in chaos theory would have us believe that just small changes can lead to differences far bigger than we could predict. With that in mind, here is a twenty-six-man squad which, had the last decade gone differently, could be representing England at this summer’s European Championships.\n\nGK\n\nJack Butland\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge:28\n\nCaps:9\n\nJack Butland really could be England’s Number One. A non-playing member of the Euro 2012 squad, Butland was also the Number One for Great Britain at the London Olympics. Injury cost him a place at Euro 2016 but in the build-up to Russia 2018 Southgate had a choice between Butland and Jordan Pickford for goalkeeper. It was the latter’s distribution which tipped the balance but Butland could very easily have been the first choice. After signing for Crystal Palace in 2020 he’s spent most of the past year on the sidelines. This year along came Dean Henderson and Butland couldn’t make the squad ahead of West Brom’s Number One.\n\nJoe Hart\n\nEngland Debut: 2008\n\nAge: 34\n\nCaps: 75\n\nIn an alternate universe Joe Hart is still England’s Number One. After the David James/Rob Green debacle of 2010 it felt like Joe Hart could be England’s first choice goalkeeper for the next decade and beyond ala David Seaman. Then, so the story goes, Pirlo scored a panenka against him. Suddenly there wasn’t the skill to match the cockiness as Hart never seemed to fulfill his promise. Pep Guardiola dropped him as soon as he joined City. To Hart’s credit he did seek a challenge at Torino. A move to Burnley followed where he was actually blamed for making them worse. Gareth Southgate’s first Number One, he was dropped before the last World Cup. He was last seen as pundit for the League Cup final between City and Spurs where he trolled Spurs despite currently being employed by them. He did match Seaman for caps, though.\n\nAlex McCarthy\n\nEngland Debut: 2018\n\nAge: 31\n\nCaps: 1\n\nA promising arrival to the Premier League for Reading, including a stunning performance at Anfield, McCarthy received his first call-up in 2013. He didn’t make his England debut until 2018, keeping a clean sheet against the USA. It’s a hard life as a third choice goalkeeper but McCarthy could have expected more. Fraser Forster managed 6 caps, in comparison.\n\nRB\n\nNathaniel Clyne\n\nEngland Debut:2014\n\nAge:30\n\nCaps: 14\n\nYounger than Kieran Trippier and made his England debut 3 years earlier. Clyne was first choice right back in 5 of England’s last 6 qualifiers for Euro 2016 yet lost his place to Kyle Walker. Even in a squad of 10 right backs it is hard to imagine him getting a place.\n\nMartin Kelly\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge: 31\n\nCaps: 1\n\nA late call-up to the Euro 2012 squad Martin Kelly is the answer to the question ‘England player with the shortest playing time’ thanks to two minutes played coming on as a substitute against Norway in a friendly. A fine career has followed at Crystal Palace but not reached the heights he may have hoped for in 2012.\n\nCB\n\nChris Smalling\n\nEngland Debut:2011\n\nAge: 31\n\nCaps: 31\n\nA first-choice centre back in 2016 when John Stones had 10 caps and Harry Maguire was yet to make his England debut. Having been paired with Gary Cahill in France Smalling must have thought he was going to be England’s senior defender for the foreseeable future. It was not to. Southgate sought other options, blaming Smalling’s lack of quality on the ball. A move to Roma and no further caps followed.\n\nPhil Jones\n\nEngland Debut: 2011\n\nAge: 29\n\nCaps:27\n\nIt’s not his fault for the injuries. It’s not his fault he has a meme-able face. It’s not his fault a clearly intoxicated Sir Alex Ferguson said he could be Manchester United’s greatest ever player. Sir Bobby Charlton compared him to Duncan Edwards. Fabio Capello compared him Franco Baresi. In an alternate universe ‘Smalling and Jones’ is a partnership to rival Bruce-Pallister or Ferdinand-Vidic. But it just hasn’t happened. He made the last World Cup, playing the two defeats to Belgium.\n\nJames Tarkowski\n\nEngland Debut: 2018\n\nAge: 28\n\nCaps: 2\n\nPart of the standby list for Russia 2018. He might look at Ben White’s inclusion and wonder.\n\nSteven Caulker\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge: 29\n\nCaps: 1\n\nRemember him? Another member of the Great Britain team in 2012, making 5 appearances, Caulker made his senior England debut in 2012 against Sweden. He scored, making it 2-1 before coming off. Ibrahimovic scored THAT goal as Sweden won 4-2 in the end. And Caulker never played for England again. He’s currently plying his trade in Turkey for Alanyaspor.\n\nMichael Keane\n\nEngland Debut: 2017\n\nAge: 28\n\nCaps: 12\n\nTwelve caps and a goal to boot. Once linked with Manchester United before a £25 million move to Everton. Keane was part of the squad for the 2019 Nations League finals. There’s still a chance for him to feature again but he must also wonder about Ben White’s inclusion.\n\nLB\n\nRyan Bertrand\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge:31\n\nCaps:19\n\nMaking your European club debut in the Champions League final is no bad way to mark your arrival. Bertrand also played at London 2012. He might have hoped to replace Ashley Cole at club and country level. He was part of the Euro 2016 squad but, just as with Clyne, it has not happened since.\n\nDanny Rose\n\nEngland Debut: 2016\n\nAge: 30\n\nCaps: 29\n\nAnother Olympic player in 2012, Rose was England’s left back at Euro 2016. He made the 2018 squad and won praise from Southgate for speaking out about his mental health. However, converted right sided player Ashley Young was preferred to him in Russia. Rose is two years younger than Young was in 2018. In Russia Rose must have had hopes of becoming England’s first choice left back again; at that point Luke Shaw’s last cap was in 2015 and Ben Chilwell was yet to play for his country. Rose announced himself at Spurs with a stunning goal against Arsenal. Yet he will also be remembered for a few awkward scenes on Amazon Prime’s ‘All or Nothing’.\n\nMF\n\nJack Wilshere\n\nEngland Debut: 2010\n\nAge: 29\n\nCaps: 32\n\nThe next Gazza. A future England captain. It felt like we heard about Jack Wilshere’s precocious talent before he even made his Arsenal debut aged just 16 in 2008. In 2011 he dazzled as Arsenal beat Barcelona 2-1. Then it all seems to have gone wrong. Injuries haven’t helped; Wilshere made the Euro 2016 squad despite playing only 3 Premier League matches more than I did in 2015-16. He now serves as the classic example of ‘what if?’ Remember: Wilshere is younger than Jordan Henderson.\n\nTom Cleverly\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge: 31\n\nCaps: 13\n\nIncluded here not so much for his England form as for some of the hyperbole amongst my fellow United fans who would have had you believe that we were looking at the next Paul Scholes and future Old Trafford legend. It of course did not happen. Less the next Scholes, more the English Darron Gibson his last cap was in 2013.\n\nAdam Lallana\n\nEngland Debut:2013\n\nAge: 33\n\nCaps: 34\n\nLallana went to Brazil in 2014 and played in three of England’s four matches at the last Euros. He then scored the only goal of the Sam Allardyce era, finishing as England’s player of the year for 2016. Injuries have hit his career hard since. A quality, skilful player, England’s midfield could be his at an age where Xavi was at his peak. It’s not proven to be so.\n\nLewis Cook\n\nEngland Debut: 2018\n\nAge: 24\n\nCaps: 1\n\nWho? Lewis Cook was the captain of the England Under-20 team which won the 2017 FIFA Under-20 World Cup, the same squad which featured Dean Henderson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. That year a certain Phil Foden scored twice in the final of the Under-17 equivalent. It has not been a similar jump for Lewis Cook. He was on standby for Russia and that summer he captained the victorious England team at the Toulon tournament. However, it now looks like he’ll be stuck on his one senior cap.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n\nEngland Debut: 2012\n\nAge: 27\n\nCaps: 35\n\nMore talented than Henderson. More gifted than Rice. A member of the England squads in 2012 and 2014, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been similarly hit by injury as Lallana. There may still be time for him with England; he’s only a year older than James Ward-Prowse.\n\nDele Alli\n\nEngland Debut: 2015\n\nAge: 25\n\nCaps: 37\n\nA regular starter in 2018 Dele Alli also went to the Nations League finals in 2019. It says a lot about his deterioration in form over the past two years that his exclusion from England’s provisional squad didn’t even cause us to bat an eyelid. Jesse Lingard has shown how it is possible to turn around a career slump. A big season awaits for Dele Alli at club and international level.\n\nEric Dier\n\nEngland Debut: 2015\n\nAge: 27\n\nCaps: 45\n\nThe scorer of England’s first goal at Euro 2016. The scorer of the winning penalty against Colombia. A member of the 2019 Nations League squad. Yet again, as with Dele Alli, his exclusion has not caused any consternation even though he can play in defence and so would offer options to a squad hit with injuries. A versatile player who developed in Portugal, Dier is intriguing and could still play an international role. A crucial season awaits for him, just as with his Tottenham teammate above.\n\nRuben Loftus-Cheek\n\nEngland Debut: 2017\n\nAge: 25\n\nCaps: 10\n\nA frustrating player who featured in 2018 yet has spent the last season in an unsuccessful relegation battle at Fulham. No longer a youngster it feels like his chance may have come and gone already. His last cap was in 2018.\n\nRoss Barkley\n\nEngland Debut: 2013\n\nAge: 27\n\nCaps: 33\n\nAs with Loftus-Cheek no longer a youngster. His big move to Chelsea came by burning all of his bridges at Everton yet he was able to have a solid if unspectacular season at Aston Villa. He played in Portugal in 2019 but the emergence of Mason Mount and Phil Foden has meant he is unlikely to feature in Gareth Southgate’s plans again.\n\nFW\n\nAndy Carroll\n\nEngland Debut: 2010\n\nAge: 32\n\nCaps: 9\n\nComparisons with Alan Shearer were always going to be lazy and set him up to fail. His goal against Sweden in Euro 2012 is one of the finest headers you are likely to see. Yet injuries and accusations of a lack of focus cost him, dear. The deal which took him to Liverpool and Fernando Torres to Chelsea was as devastating to him as it was the Spaniard. Less was made of a Uruguayan called Luis Suárez joining Liverpool on the same day which says a lot. Speaking of other Liverpool strikers: Rickie Lambert has more England caps. And goals.\n\nDaniel Sturridge\n\nEngland Debut: 2011\n\nAge: 31\n\nCaps: 26\n\nYet another London 2012 player. Sturridge will probably be remembered more for his irritating celebration (and Subway advert) than for anything else which is a shame. In 2013/14 he formed a partnership with Suárez which almost delivered the title to Anfield. That summer he scored in Brazil. It has been downhill ever since despite scoring the winner against Wales at Euro 2016. Questions were raised over his attitude especially over playing with injuries and he has been without a club since March 2020 when Turkish club Trabzonspoor terminated his contract with mutual agreement. Southgate turned the page on Sturridge’s England career in 2017.\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nEngland Debut: 2006\n\nAge: 32\n\nCaps: 47\n\nIt’s hard to say which came out worse from Sven-Göran Eriksson's choice to pick a 17-year-old with no top flight appearances for Germany 2006: England’s World Cup chances or Theo Walcott. There have been bright moments since: a hat-trick against Croatia and a goal against Sweden at Euro 2012. But 2006 remains his only World Cup. However, 47 caps is a fine achievement and even more remarkable considering his last cap was in 2016.\n\nDanny Welbeck\n\nEngland Debut: 2011\n\nAge: 30\n\nCaps: 42\n\nDanny Welbeck was in England’s 2018 squad. No, really he was. Check. See? A versatile forward player Welbeck scored a backheel flick at Euro 2012 and was top scorer in qualifying for Euro 2016. With England blessed with regard to pacey winger/forwards Welbeck’s chances at international level have gone. He can look back on a career at domestic level with five major honours including the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nCallum Wilson\n\nEngland Debut: 2018\n\nAge: 29\n\nCaps: 4\n\nScored on his debut against the USA and went to Portugal in 2019. Once linked with moves to Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford, Wilson last played for England in that infamous 6-0 in Bulgaria. His England chances look to have gone but he is far from finished in the top flight: last season he managed 12 goals in 28 matches for a Newcastle United not known for attacking play. In comparison, Jamie Vardy managed 17 goals in 48 matches for high-flying Leicester City.\n\nThe times they are a-changing. The last fortnight has seen the return of knock-out European football. Last autumn it was announced that UEFA look set to change the format of the Champions League in favour of a ‘Swiss system’ with four more matches. This will be a mistake. This is not the change needed. We got an idea of the change needed last summer.\n\n* * *\n\nOut of the horror of the COVID-19 pandemic have been glimpses at something different. Some of this has been profound: pollution reduced or the daily commute eliminated. Another change, albeit meaningless in the grand scheme of things but significant in its own way was the single-legged format of the final stage of the Champions League and Europa League held in Portugal and Germany respectively. As Arrigo Sacchi put it: “football is the most important of the least important things in life”.\n\nThe first European Cup in 1955–56 consisted of 29 matches from start to finish. The following year’s edition contained a preliminary round and tiebreakers and so consisted of 44 matches from start to finish. The 2018–19 tournament, not including qualifiers, consisted of 125.\n\nIn the 2018–19 Champions League, the knockout phase began on February 12th and consisted of twenty-eight matches before the final on 1st June. In the 2019–20 season once the single-legged format began at the quarter-final stage there were only 7 matches including the final between 12th and 23rd August. That was it. None of the coaches or players with one eye on domestic football between two legs of continental football, this was distilled and focused. In a summer where the European Championship was cancelled this was tournament football which, although without fans, was compelling in a way that the traditional format couldn’t achieve.\n\nIt seems every season now fixture congestion raises its head. We debate the merits of the League Cup, the need for FA Cup replays and a winter break. Yet every season we continue to play 28 matches over 3 months in the Champions League without question. In an age of great awareness over travel and its environmental impact as well as ever-greater squeezing of the football fan’s wallet could the knockout stages we’ve just seen be a blueprint for the future?\n\nThe double-legged format of the knockout stages of European club football has been in place since inception. In many ways, it’s a vestige of the competitions at their genesis, before group stages became entrenched in the 1990s and beyond. Back then it was knockout football from the beginning. Without seeding. In 1978 Nottingham Forest were rewarded for their league win with a first-round draw against defending European champions Liverpool. They won. In 1960 defending European champions and five times consecutive winners Real Madrid were drawn against Spanish champions Barcelona. And lost. You played the team you were drawn against home and away. Add up the aggregate score and whoever has the most goals went through. Simple.\n\nThe worth of group stages, wherein the Champions League 96 matches are played so the top-seeded 16 clubs invariably go through and the bottom seeded 16 go out, can be debated but won’t change as it’s UEFA’s concession to their lower-ranked members. With a group stage, even the worst teams are guaranteed 6 matches with all the involved money. That won’t change. Now we have an idea of what is possible with the knockout rounds. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has recently announced that the new format could be the future from the 2025 season. Should it be?\n\nOf course, in order to change from two legs to one, we’d have to look at what we might lose. As a Manchester United fan, I think back to that second leg against Roma in 2007 turning a 2–1 first leg deficit around with a 7–1 win at home. Chelsea fans will point to Napoli in 2012 on their way to glory. Liverpool fans to Barcelona in 2019. The 2018–19 Champions League, in particular, was a season of great comebacks in the second leg for Manchester United, Ajax, Tottenham Hotspur and, of course, Liverpool. This is what romance in sport is made of: a team coming from behind to win against the odds.\n\nBut how often does it actually happen? The Champions League has been in its current format since 2003. The Europa League since 2009. In the 16 seasons between 2003 and 2019 that meant 448 knockout matches, not including finals for the Champions League. For the Europa League, that’s 600 from 2009 to 2019.\n\nLet’s look at those matches and see which knockout fixtures ‘needed’ a second leg. To do that we’ll look at the number of knockout fixtures where a team lost the first leg but won the second. These are the only fixtures where the second leg ‘mattered’. We’ll then look at how many times that ‘changed’ the outcome of that particular fixture i.e. the team losing the first leg came from behind to go through. We won’t include ties where the first leg was drawn because in a single-leg fixture the match would just go to extra time. This is only the matches where a full second 90 minutes changed the outcome.\n\nIf we add up the knockout matches for the Champions League and the Europa League that’s 1048 matches played when the second leg was actually needed only 16% of the time across the two competitions.\n\n* * *\n\nThis is a decision of rationality vs romance. In 2018 after a first-leg defeat to PSG Ole Gunnar Solskjær opined that “mountains are there to be climbed. You can’t lay down and say ‘this is over’.” We then know what followed. A team coming from behind is probably the most powerful image in any sport. That’s why they stick with us. These are moments that define a season. Without a second leg, Real Madrid would have been knocked out by Wolfsburg in 2016 and not won the competition. Same for Liverpool in 2019. But as we’ve seen, they are rare.\n\nThere’s also the factor of a self-fulfilling prophecy here. When Barcelona took to the field at Anfield in 2019 how much was the result against Roma in 2018 playing on their mind? How much was that Barcelona result playing on the minds of the PSG players when they faced Manchester United? Surely it isn’t a coincidence that PSG made the final the season when they only had one two-legged fixture? Having come from behind to beat Atalanta 2–1 in the quarter-finals, would the narrative of bottlers have remained if they’d had to play a second leg?\n\nAnother benefit of switching to single legs would be removing the away goals rule. No change since abolishing back passes could improve the game as much. Away goals skew football: I remember in 2011 listening to Radio 5 Live and a Spurs fan called in to say he was disappointed his team had ‘only’ won 1–0 away to AC Milan and not 2–1 because then they could lose 1–0 at home and still go through. Bizarre. The away goal rule punishes a home team for playing on the front foot: better to win 2–0 and stop than carry on attacking and win 3–1 or 4–2. This is insanity. Think of the cynicism we’d lose in one fell swoop.\n\nOlympique Lyonnais played above and beyond against Manchester City last summer and won 3–1. Imagine the narrative under the traditional format. City would have another 90 minutes to come from behind. If their goal were an away goal City might even be favourites still. What if Bayern Munich and Barcelona had to play a second leg after the 8–2? A pointless 90 minutes which could only have threatened injury and suspension for Bayern Munich and embarrassment for Barcelona. As it was Bayern Munich and Lyon won and were through. Barcelona and Manchester City lost and were out. Done and finished after 90 minutes as codified in 1897.\n\nThe prestige of the Champions League is the jewel in UEFA’s crown. FIFA has looked enviously at Europe’s premier competition which is largely behind its decision to expand the FIFA World Club Cup. To reduce the number of matches would go against the general trend of football: more teams, more games, more money. Yet this summer we’ve had a glimpse of something else. Crisp and succinct. Rather than a bloated competition across countries and months, this was engrossing tournament football. The only thing it was missing was fans. Once they’re back UEFA could be onto something here. One leg is better than two.\n\n30 years of hurt are over. Blackburn Rovers and Leicester City have been knocked off their effing perches. Liverpool have their first Premier League title. In case you were in any doubt: This Matters More and You’ll Never Walk Alone. (Unless you’re the staff they attempted to furlough or Liverpool Women neglected to their fate).\n\nThere have been and will continue to be plenty of puff pieces on this subject. The world according to Steve McManaman or Jim Beglin. Where Anfield is home to special fans who know football better than others who support a club with history; because no other club has passionate fans or history. A world where Michael Owen is suddenly a Liverpool fan again and thinks that the highest point of Atletico Madrid’s existence was winning on Merseyside. A world where a recent BBC programme chronicled Liverpool’s title charge as an almost biblical mission.\n\nAnd so with a snort of derision I find myself wondering: are Liverpool actually THAT good? Yes, I’m a Manchester United fan and yes, this is (slightly) tongue in cheek but are they?\n\nThere was once a role within the Catholic Church to provide evidence against the canonisation of a candidate. The advocatus diaboli or ‘Devil’s Advocate’ would seek out holes in the argument to award sainthood. Consider this playing (red) devil’s advocate against the imperious reputation of Liverpool this season. Before you accuse me: yes, of course I’m bitter. Liverpool won the Premier League at a canter and, rightly, won plaudits. However, I’m going to put their season under some scrutiny and use data to answer the question: Are there reasons to be cheerful if you’re not a Liverpool fan looking ahead to next season? Is there a chance they won’t retain the title?\n\nA glance at the 2019-20 Premier League table is impressive. There’s Liverpool on 99 points; 18 clear of Manchester City. Only once before had a club won the league with more points. Surely there is no questioning their dominance? Enter statistics.\n\nWhilst VAR hogs most discussions regarding recent updates to the world of football, for me Expected Goals (EG) has been a far more interesting and illuminating way of looking at the game. It’s a simple piece of data with far reaching potential. Each chance at goal is given a numerical value, or xG, between 0-1. This value basically reflects how hard or easy that chance is. A shot with an xG of 0.5 means it would be scored 50% of the time. A shot with an xG of 0.9 would be scored 90% of the time. And so on. This BBC Sport article goes into depth about how each chance is awarded a value but, essentially, the closer you are to the goal and the ‘easier’ the shot the higher the xG.\n\nIf you think about it this has the chance to revolutionise how we look at football. Rather than simply measuring a striker’s quality by goals scored we can look at their xG: do they match their xG (score as many as they should based on difficulty of the chance) or do they exceed or even fall under it? The same principle works on a defence. Say a team concedes a lot of shots on goal, we might be tempted to think their defence was poor. However, they may be employing a low block and, as a result, concede a lot of long shots which count as a shot on goal but have a low xG. This would give that team a low EG against and more accurately reflect how well they were defending.\n\nIf we can calculate the EG scored (xGs) and EG against (xGa) for both teams during a match we can calculate the result that statistically ‘should’ have happened.\n\nFor example, Liverpool started the 2019-20 season with a 4-1 thrashing of newly promoted Norwich City. The EGs for both teams was 2.23 for Liverpool and 0.43 for Norwich City. So, actually both teams scored more than their EG suggests but the result would still have been a Liverpool win.\n\nTheir next match was a 2-1 win away at Southampton. A statement of intent. Looking again at the EG and we are given a score of 2.14 - 1.52 in Southampton’s favour. According to statistics Liverpool should not have won this match. Not surprising when you might remember this match contained Danny Ings’s horror miss from a few yards out.\n\nOn September 22nd they racked up their sixth straight win away at Stamford Bridge. However EG shows that rather than a 2-1 away win the chances created would indicate a score of 1.23 to 1.03 in Chelsea’s favour.\n\nBy November 10th Liverpool looked like champions elect already with a 3-1 win against defending champions Manchester City at Anfield 3-1. The EG score? 1.33 - 1.48. Another win that shouldn’t have been.\n\nThrough the EGs for each match we can then calculate the Expected Points (EP) that team ‘should’ have acquired based on the chances they were making and conceding during the season. As you may have guessed, looking at Liverpool’s EP tells an interesting story.\n\nHere’s the final 2019-2020 table as it was:\n\nIncredibly, Liverpool outperformed their EP by 13.55. Once again they were the highest overachievers. In 2017-2018 the highest overachievers were Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United who finished second but should have finished sixth. And we know how that played out.\n\nSo, over the course of 2 seasons, Liverpool have outperformed their EP by a staggering 38.72 points. This is obviously commendable but is it sustainable? The received wisdom was that Leicester City’s fairy story in 2016 was a one-off and so it came to pass. However, they only exceeded their EP by 12.06. By comparison, in winning the Bundesliga Bayern Munich exceeded their EP by only 4.67 in 2020 and actually should have had 4 more points in 2019. Manchester City in their disaster of a season should have won the league this year.\n\nWhy the discrepancy? How did Liverpool finish 18 points ahead of Manchester City when they should have been 12 behind? Of their 32 wins, 14 (44.75%) were by one goal. In comparison in 2018/19 only 9 (28.125%) of Manchester City’s wins were by one goal. Manchester City outperformed Liverpool by 17 goals scored and only conceded 2 goals more. But they lost 9 games to Liverpool’s 3. 5 of those defeats were by only one goal. These are the margins behind the story of the 2019-20 season. A compelling story but not one which should make the chasing pack terrified for the new season.\n\nSo how have Liverpool been able to exceed EP and beat the model? There’s been a bit of talk about this and in my opinion, this is the real question which needs answering and isn’t amongst all the plaudits. Of course, Liverpool played very well but they only have the player of the season if you’ve never heard of Kevin de Bruyne. The number of one-goal wins and their xGa suggests they own a lot more to Alisson than any other player. Of course, it’s not a bad thing to have a good goalkeeper: in fact, it’s essential. We don’t know whether if Liverpool did concede more they wouldn’t have just gone up the other end and scored more rather than seeing a match out. But we can only look at the data we have.\n\nThere is lots of discussion about Liverpool’s style of play and their manager’s tactical acumen. To my mind as long as Pep Guardiola resides on these shores I’d argue that Klopp could only be second in the list of most interesting tacticians in the Premier League. Now Marcelo Bielsa will be plying his trade in the top flight Jurgen is third at best. Maybe the over-performance of Liverpool over the past two seasons shows us that this is not where his strengths lie: rather it is about eking out consistency from his players as well as managing situations within a game. An emotive coach, it was inevitable that he would work at Liverpool: an emotive club. Perhaps only Diego Simeone embodies the very persona of his team in a greater way than Klopp does.\n\nKlopp has shown how he is the master of managing situations and matches. His Champions League triumph in 2019 owed much to managing moments: a knockout round place earned thanks to a 1-0 win against a sleepy Napoli with Arkadiusz Milik hitting an injury-time chance straight at Alisson; a buoyant semi-final against a Barcelona so emotionally fragile they were capable of throwing away a 3-0 lead; a final facing a broken Spurs team which lasted all of two minutes until a dubious penalty was awarded. They managed the match at 1-0 and scored a late second.\n\nIn 2019-20 Klopp then brought this to their league form: securing single goal margins and seeing a game out. This would put him at the pinnacle of the psychological aspect of the game. Gareth Southgate has done much with England to help them manage high pressure situations as well as using emotions for advantage. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United, Frank Lampard at Chelsea, Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid and now Andrea Pirlo at Juventus are all appointments based on emotions. Perhaps their records as players speak more to modern players than tacticians like Jose Mourinho, Rafael Benitez or Maurizio Sarri, coaches with no playing career to speak of. In a game of high-profile moments with season-defining jeopardy, maybe Jurgen Klopp has turned owning the match into an art. Maybe that is where his plaudits should actually lie.\n\nJurgen Klopp is a fascinating character. The general image is of him laughing and joking yet some had a certain Portuguese manager screamed at a linesman, run onto a pitch, criticised the tactics of Manchester United in the league and Atlético Madrid, played a youth team in the League Cup and refused to attend a FA Cup match it is tempting to wonder if the press would remain as positive. He’s winning now and it is easy to be nice when you’re winning. Yet his final season at Borussia Dortmund should serve as a warning. At Christmas, the club he had won two titles with and taken to the Champions League final were in the relegation zone. He took them back up to the Europa League places before resigning. Perhaps when the power to control moments slips so too do the results. Maybe this is the downside of an emotive coach at an emotive club. The first match of the 2020-21 season against Leeds United may be instructive.\n\nOf course, in order for Liverpool to lose the title, someone else has to win it. Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are all in decent places. Mikel Arteta is showing promise, Chelsea are assembling an intriguing squad and Manchester United have their most entertaining group of attacking players since the days of Sir Alex. Yet it is hard to see any of them taking the title just yet. Although based on EP Chelsea and Manchester United were much closer to Liverpool than the table would tell us and should be encouraged. The favourite to stop Liverpool remains Pep Guardiola, though.\n\nGuardiola is entering his first fifth season at a club. This is uncharted territory. Yet the manager who turns diligence to obsession will want to win back the league. And it is closer than you think Turn those 5 single goal defeats to draws and that 18 point gap becomes 8. If 4 of Liverpool’s 14 single goal wins become draws and that 18 point gap is gone.\n\nFinally, this is not an era of eras. Since 2009 only one club has retained the Premier League. For several of those campaigns such as Manchester United in 2013-14, Manchester City in 2014-15 and 2019-20; Chelsea in 2015-16 and 2017-18 and Leicester in 2016-17 title defences were non-existent. Jurgen Klopp did retain the Bundesliga once with Borussia Dortmund but then failed to match Bayern Munich. He would do well to not slip into hubris. To look at the data and perhaps reflect on how this league title was won. And how it might be taken off him far easier than we might think."
