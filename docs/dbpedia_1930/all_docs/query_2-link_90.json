        "text": "While Shamrock Rovers lost the first leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie 1-0 in Slovenia against NK Celje, the Hoops will be reasonably happy with the outcome and will be hopeful that they can progress to the play-off round in Tallaght next week with a win in the second leg.\n\nShould they manage to do that they will guarantee themselves group stage football in at least the Conference League and a shot at the Europa League groups stages if they can overcome the loser of the Malmo and PAOK Champions League tie who will drop into the Europa League play-off round – the first leg finished 2-2 in Sweden.\n\nFor the Hoops it was a patchy performance in the first leg to reflect the patchy surface that the game was played on – UEFA described the pitch as ‘soft’.\n\nRovers had periods where they looked very comfortable against the Slovenian champions but coughed up a number of chances to Celje who managed to convert just the one on the night.\n\nLeon Pöhls pulled off a couple of fine saves midway through the half first pushing away Aljoša Matko shot in the 21st minute after the home side broke at pace and in numbers. A minute later the keeper’s right foot stopped Mario Kvesić close range effort.\n\nThe Celje player did look offside and VAR may have come to the Hoops rescue had his effort gone in.\n\nThis was during a dominant spell from the home side that culminated in scoring the only goal of the game in the 34th minute by Luka Menalo. He nutmegged Sean Hoare just outside the box and drove into the penalty area. His shot went through Pico Lopes’ legs to beat Pöhls low to his right.\n\nThe Hoops had created a chance in the opening moments of the game. Aaron Greene, who scored twice in Prague last week, blazed over the bar.\n\nJosh Honohan then fed Dylan Watts who shot straight at Lovro Štubljar and they got a couple of quick fire corners all during a 15 minute first half spell when they looked quite comfortable before allowing Celje take control.\n\nTowards the end of the first period though, the Hoops did get back on top. Trevor Clarke was wasteful with a cross and then Lopes looped a header over the bar before Hoare from distance forced Štubljar into a super save diving to his right all before the half time whistle.\n\nHoops Head Coach Stephen Bradley brought on Darragh Burns for Trevor Clarke in the 57th minute to add more attacking threat. Rovers went close soon after with Neil Farrugia but, after a fabulous run, he couldn’t convert the chance.\n\nCelje manager Albert Riera only named six outfield players on his bench and had used all five of his allotted substitutes inside the 67th minute which seemed a bizarre piece of coaching by the former Liverpool manager. He was thankful that none of his players picked up an injury on the awful playing surface in the final quarter of the game.\n\nRovers sub Aaron McEneff had a golden opportunity for an equaliser in the 77th minute as he got free on the right but his shot was too close to Štubljar who batted it away.\n\nA Cleary short back pass should have been exploited by Denis Popović in the final five minutes but he snatched a shot high and wide. While the Hoops couldn’t quite find the equaliser in the final period they will be satisfied with a performance and result that very much keeps the tie alive.\n\nThe losers of this third round qualifier will face a long trek in the play-off of the Conference League qualifiers as they will face the winners of the contest between Ordabasy of Kazakhstan and Pyunik of Armenia for a last shot at group stage football. Pyunik won the first leg 1-0 in Kazakhstan.\n\nWin the tie next week and it will be a more straightforward trip to either Sweden or Greece and the knowledge that they will have group stage football already in the bag (plus a cheque from UEFA of in excess of €4 million)."
