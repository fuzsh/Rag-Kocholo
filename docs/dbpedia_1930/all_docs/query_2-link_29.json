        "text": "Who to look out for?\n\nEighteen year old striker Poppy Pritchard made her England Under-19 debut in September 2023, scoring in a 5-0 win over Denmark. Since then Pritchard who recently joined Manchester City has made nine England appearances and scored nine goals.\n\nShe scored the opening goal against Switzerland and a brace against Italy that helped to seal Englandâs qualification for the tournament in Lithuania.\n\nHow to watch?\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nBBC Sport has live coverage from both the Uefa Womenâs and Menâs Under-19 Championships with all England matches from the womenâs tournament and all Northern Ireland matches from the menâs tournament available live alongside semi-finals and finals from both tournaments.\n\nLive coverage will be available across the BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport Website and App along with BBC Red Button coverage of selected matches.\n\nWomenâs Under-19 Championship\n\nBBC Sport\n\nEngland have qualified for the Womenâs Under-19 Championship taking place in Lithuania starting from today.\n\nThey find themselves in Group A alongside hosts Lithuania, Serbia and rivals France. Northern Ireland are the sole home nation to qualify for the menâs tournament and they face Italy, Norway and Ukraine in Group A.\n\nThe Womenâs Under-19 European Championship began in its current guise in 2001-02 and over the 22 additions since then Germany are the most successful nation with six titles to their name.\n\nCurrent holders Spain beat Germany in last yearâs final to win their fifth title. Both Germany and Spain will face each other again this summer in Group B.\n\nEngland have won the competition once in 2009, under the management of current Womenâs Under-23 boss Mo Marley OBE when goals from Jordon Nobbs and Toni Duggan sealed a 2-0 win in the final against Sweden.\n\nEngland have also finished as runners up on three previous occasions in 2007, 2010 and 2013.\n\nGet Inspired: Football\n\nBBC Sport\n\nWhy get into football?\n\nIt's a simple game, easy to start, and exciting to play, it's the most popular sport in the world for a very good reason!\n\nWho is it for?\n\nWhatever your age, ability or fitness level, there is a type of football suitable for you.\n\nIs there a cheap option?\n\nAll you need to play is a ball, and a bit of space. Kit and pitches follow but there's no outlay up front.\n\nWhat if I want a proper workout?\n\nPlaying regularly increases your fitness and improves your skills and balance, while being a good way to see your mates.\n\nIs there a disability option?\n\nNational Associations across Britain are increasingly pro-active in providing disability football options."
