        "text": "They produced another remarkable display at the UKI Arena, Jessheim, thanks to goals from Savannah McCarthy and Megan Connolly to follow up on the wins over Spain and England.\n\nIt wasn’t a great start for Dave Connell’s team as Sweden took the lead after just eight minutes when captain Julia Wahlberg ran onto a through ball and fired in from a tight angle.\n\nTypical of this Ireland team though, they set about responding straight away. With Chloe Mustaki leading by example in midfield and the momentum started to swing towards the girls in green.\n\nClever running off the ball from Katie McCabe, Sarah Rowe, and Amy O’Connor pulled Sweden away from their central base, while Grace Wright and Keeva Keenan got forward from full-back.\n\nThe only thing missing was a measured pass and Connolly provided it on 21 minutes.\n\nA free-kick inside her own half didn’t look like being a threat, but she picked out McCarthy to head in.\n\nSweden goalkeeper Zecira Musovic couldn’t get near McCarthy’s looping header, but she did well to deny McCabe two minutes later when the Raheny United attacker unleashed a shot at goal.\n\nWith temperatures soaring at pitch level, referee Zuzana Kovacova called for a cooling break on the half hour and it was more of the same from Ireland once play resumed.\n\nA shot from distance from Julia Anna Ekholm tested the alertness of keeper Brooke Dunne, although Connell’s team finished the first half on top.\n\nSweden - who needed a win by a two-goal margin - tried to score again with Ekholm firing at Dunne again, however Ireland’s held their opponents at bay and they used the ball well.\n\nA second goal was next on the wishlist and Connolly supplied it on 80 minutes.\n\nAfter McCabe earned a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area, the Cork native curled in an astounding effort via the underside of the crossbar.\n\nIreland then held on to record a huge win and they will be back in action on Thursday against Netherlands, where they will be prepared to write another chapter in history as the final is only one more game away.\n\nREPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Dunne; Keenan, O’Connell, McCarthy, Wright; Connolly, Mustaki, Dwyer; Rowe (Shine 58), O’Connor, McCabe (Carson 88).\n\nSWEDEN: Musovic; Ekholm, Bjorn, E Karlsson, N Karlsson; Andersson (Angeldal 76), Hurtig, Wahlberg, Curmark (Okvist h-t); Blackstenius, Olme (Jansson 70).\n\nREFEREE: Zuzana Kovacova (Slovakia)."
