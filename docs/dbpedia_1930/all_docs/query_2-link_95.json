        "text": "Coach Scott Robertson said, \"They don't get to the final four in the World Cup without having a serious Test team. We're focused on them really clearly.\"\n\nThe All Blacks have arrived at the Championship pleased with their defensive showings in the July Tests which allowed them to win games from that aspect, but he is seeking more progress with the ball by creating more opportunities and executing them.\n\n\"In those first two Test matches [against England], we got a lot of opportunities early but didn't execute. We got into an arm wrestle, and the games got close. So, there's been a focus on executing, but we should keep trusting our skills to be courageous.\n\n\"We want to play it two or three different ways depending on who's in front of us and the weather.\"\n\nRobertson said injuries to locks Scott Barrett (hand) and Patrick Tuipulotu (calf) had given Sam Darry his first starting chance, while Josh Lord's return from injury after two warm-up games proved perfect timing.\n\n\"There's some fresh blood coming through the second row. Sam's been impressive since he's come in, and Josh has worn the black jersey before and he'll get straight up to the mark.\"\n\nThe changes in the post-Whitelock-Rettallick era, while disrupted by injuries, are exciting.\n\n\"We've got a big six-foot eight-inch lock [Darry] coming in and a six-foot nine-inch lock [Lord] on the bench. And they're good athletes. When someone retires, someone gets an opportunity, and it's their opportunity.\n\n\"So we set them up the best we can to perform, and they've done it themselves as well.\"\n\nThe side chosen was the best for this match, so Anton Lienert-Brown was preferred to start at centre ahead of Rieko Ioane.\n\n\"We had a conversation with Rieko, and it's a competitive position. We've got two or three guys now that we can pick. It's a performance-based sport; everyone has areas to work on, and we've gone with Anton.\n\n\"He's been in great form all year, both sides of the ball, and now he's a good voice, a good leader in our group.\"\n\nLoose forward Luke Jacobson had a hamstring twinge during the week, which allowed Ethan Blackadder to come into the blindside flank role. They were also pleased with Wallace Sititi's effort in San Diego, and his being named on the bench was a chance for continuity for him.\n\n\"My job is to create depth in the squad and the All Blacks team so guys can step in, and to create depth, you need to create competition.\n\n\"To create competition, you need to train hard and take opportunities when they are given.\n\n\"It is a competitive market at the moment in the team and the guys are stepping up to it.\"\n\nThe side will also have explosiveness from the bench.\n\nWill Jordan returns from injury and Robertson was an interested spectator in a game he played for Tasman at the weekend.\n\n\"I saw a decent try, a trademark try, and anticipation off the ball. He's in good nick; he's fit and ready to go.\n\n\"Beauden's [Barrett] been exceptional and with Jordan coming off the bench it makes the impact special. So having a couple of guys available for the 15 [fullback] jersey is great.\"\n\nThe bench was explosive, with Ioane also able to play wing while Jordan could cover wing and fullback.\n\n\"The utility factor is critical.\""
