        "text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nSummary\n\nJonathan Howcroft\n\nThank you for joining me tonight, and throughout this World Cup, it’s been a blast. I’ve contributed to plenty of tournaments across a range of sports, and this one has been particularly special.\n\nBe sure to return here tomorrow night at 8pm local time (11am BST) for the World Cup final between England and Spain from Sydney. Hopefully they deliver a fitting finale to this magnificent month.\n\nCheerio.\n\nShare\n\nThere are still thousands of fans inside Lang Park in Brisbane to salute the Matildas. Australia’s players are in tears during their lap of honour but the crowd is giving them a moment to remember.\n\nShare\n\nHere’s Jo Khan’s first take on tonight’s action from Brisbane Stadium.\n\nIt was meant to end on a high. One final box to tick to cap off the Matildas’ record-breaking World Cup campaign on home soil. But from the first whistle of their third-place playoff game against Sweden it looked unlikely to happen. A first-half penalty and a second-half cracker from Sweden captain Kosovare Asllani decisively put Australia in fourth place at this tournament. By no means a failure, but not what they wanted.\n\nShare\n\nThere will be plenty of time to put tonight’s match and Australia’s World Cup in context. Don’t miss a word of it by signing up to the Moving the Goalposts newsletter.\n\nShare\n\nSweden’s players make their way onto a hastily erected dais and accept their bronze medals from Gianni Infantino.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 12.23 CEST\n\n“The Matildas, for understandable reasons, don’t seem to have been able to fire themselves up for the third place playoff. I can’t help but think they’ll be serious contenders at next year’s Olympics, especially with a near miss at glory to spur them on.” They have to qualify first, Kári Tulinius. They won’t guarantee their place in Paris until the end of February next year.\n\nShare\n\n“No complaints about that result,” emails Chris Paraskevas. “Fourth place is what we deserve (and perhaps a little lucky to get that). Deflating, frustrating but Sweden are a good side, and as a football national we’ve furthered our “education”... sometimes you need to take your medicine.”\n\nNot for the first time Chris, I agree with you. The obvious caveat being Australia won’t be hosting a World Cup again any time soon. This was a rare moment with everything to the Matildas’ advantage. As incredible as the month has been, it will be viewed as an opportunity missed on the field.\n\nShare\n\nTony Gustavsson brings his squad together for his customary postmatch huddle. He will doubtless be sending positive messages but he will be left to reflect on three matches in a row in which his side has been second-best in the knockout stages of a World Cup. Extended, over seven World Cup matches the Matildas only showed their best twice – against Canada and Denmark.\n\nShare\n\nAustralia, by contrast, look forlorn and exhausted. They were never at the races tonight, taking an age to get into the game and then offering very little in the second half. A very disappointing end to a magical month.\n\nShare\n\nSweden were much the better of the two sides on the night. Rubensson dominated the scrap in midfield, the attacking trio of Asllani, Kaneryd, and Rolfö were a persistent threat, and Blackstenius was imperious leading the line. They are celebrating their fourth World Cup bronze medal with broad satisfied smiles.\n\nShare\n\nFull-time: Sweden 2-0 Australia\n\nSweden end the 2023 World Cup with the bronze medal, running out comfortable 2-0 winners over Australia in Brisbane.\n\nThe Matildas have given this tournament plenty, but they looked out of energy and ideas tonight.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 12.12 CEST\n\n90+5 mins: Cooney-Cross hammers the free-kick as far as she can, straight to Musovic. Australia have wasted so many of those moments tonight.\n\nShare\n\n90+4 mins: Chidiac is again fouled, this time by Hurtig, and the Sweden veteran is booked for kicking the ball away.\n\nShare\n\n90+3 mins: This second-half has not been a classic and it is ebbing away in forgettable fashion.\n\nShare\n\n90+2 mins: Australia spend a couple of minutes huffing and puffing but there’s no composure despite the crowd screaming them on. Fowler dinks over a nice cross then Cooney-Cross scuffs an effort from range before, finally, Van Egmond drags a shot wide.\n\nShare\n\n90+1 mins:\n\nShare"
