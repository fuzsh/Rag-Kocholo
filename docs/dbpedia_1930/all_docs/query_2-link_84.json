        "text": "Two months after her dream move to Celtic, North Wales youngster Amy Richardson is still on cloud nine!\n\nHaving just been on tour in Sweden with the Scottish Women’s Premier League champions, the 18-year-old left-sided defender from Penrhyn Bay is thrilled at the prospect of Saturday’s 2024-25 season opener at home to Dundee United.\n\nWales Under-19 international Amy, who was recently part of a full Wales squad camp, spoke to Grassroots North Wales about her experiences with the Hoops so far.\n\nIt’s two months since you signed for Celtic. How are you settling in? Do you feel like you are part of a really huge club?\n\nIt was a big move for me to move away from home for the first time, but for the short time I’ve been here so far the club and the team have been really welcoming and supportive which has help the transition easier on and off the pitch.\n\nBefore coming to Celtic I knew it was a big club, but now I’m here and a part of it you can really see how big of a club it really is and now much it means to the fans and also the players.\n\nWhat are your hopes for the season ahead? Are you targeting a first team place straight off?\n\nFor this season I really want to focus on my development, I’m not striving to be a superstar of the team. I’m still young and have a lot to learn, but when I do have my chance on the pitch hopefully I can show people what I can do.\n\nWhere were you before you signed for Celtic? How did the move there come about?\n\nBefore I signed for Celtic, I was at Everton for 2 years as a part of their under 21’s squad.\n\nDuring my first season Elena (my Celtic coach now) came in while our manager was on maternity leave. I worked with her for 7 months before she left for her move to Celtic.\n\nI really enjoyed working under Elena, she really pushed me to better. When my time was up at Everton I spoke to Elena again and expressed how I liked working with her and that I’d like to keep working with her.\n\nLuckily she’d seen something in me so she took a chance on me and agreed to keep developing me. I’m so grateful for the opportunity that I have and I’m so excited for this next chapter.\n\nI believe there is Scottish blood in your family – please tell me about that\n\nYes my grandad was born in Glasgow and when he was younger he was a Celtic fan which is quite special to me because my grandad was the person who got me into football and although he’s not with us anymore I feel very proud to play for the team that he supported and I know he’d be proud of me with everything I’ve achieved so far.\n\nHow are things going on the Wales front? You must be delighted to see the senior women’s team’s progress. Do you think they can make the Euro finals? How do you see your own prospects of breaking into the squad? What has been your best moment as an international player so far?\n\nThings are going well with Wales. It’s always an honour to represent my country and the experiences I’ve had over the years as a Welsh player have been amazing, ones I’ll always remember.\n\nHaving recently been on my first senior camp I’ve seen what it really means for the girls to reach the Euros next year. They have some really great players in that squad and I have no doubt that they can’t do it. I think I’d have to say my call up to the WNT is definitely my most proudest moment so far as an international player and hopefully in the future I’ll get the opportunity again\n\nDoes the recent breakthrough of Mayzee Davies into the first team squad inspire you, does it give you hope that there may was be more North Wales players selected by Rhian Wilkinson?\n\nMayzee is a great player. I grew up playing with Mayzee in previous youth teams. It does give me hope that more youth players will able to break through to the WNT and I think Mayzee has been a great example of what is to come in the next few years in terms of the talent in the youth teams.\n\nAny indication what position you will play in at Celtic? What is your best position?\n\nI think this season I’ll be playing more of a centre back role which is also where I’ve been playing for Wales this last season, so I have a bit of experience there and it is a position I’ve started to enjoy more.\n\nI’d say my best position is either full back or centre back.\n\nDo you spend all your time in Scotland? Or do you get to visit home fairly regularly?\n\nI’m up in Scotland all the time, I’ve only managed to go home once so far because my schedule is very busy at the moment, but it does mean that when I do get to go home or if my family come up to see me it makes it even more special.\n\nCan you just run through your career briefly? what age did you start playing football and which teams have you represented?\n\nI started playing football at the age of 6. I played for Glanwydden fc, Llandudno girls, Penrhyn Bay girls, then a short season with Llandudno boys academy alongside the FAW North trust academy.\n\nThen I had a one year training contract with Manchester United where I trained with the under 16’s and under 21’s. From there I moved to Everton which is where I’d been previously for 2 years.\n\nFinally, what are your overall ambitions for the 2024-25 season?\n\nIn terms of club I would like to win some trophies, help the team retain the league is the biggest one and also try and progress in the Champions League.\n\nFor Wales, hopefully I’ll get to play with the 19’s next season, keep working hard there and help the team get promoted to league A again and also keep working hard to maybe get another chance up with the WNT."
