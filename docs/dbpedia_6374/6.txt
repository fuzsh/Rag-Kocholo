Information

Bangalore (Namma) Metro is an urban Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) with 2 lines and 51 stations serving Bengaluru, Karnataka’s capital and largest city.

Construction for Bangalore Metro Phase 1 with 42.30 km of routes started in April 2007. Its first section, connecting Baiyyappanahalli – MG Road on the Purple Line, opened up in 2011. The 6th (and final) section was inaugurated by India’s President on June 17 2017 and commercial operations started on the next day.

Construction work on the 73.921 km Bangalore Metro Phase 2‘s first new section (Mysore Road – Pattanagere, Reach-2A of Purple Line) started in September 2015. The project faced funding issues due to which a majority of civil construction contracts were awarded only in the first half of 2017.

While the Green Line’s extension to Silk Institute became operational in January 2021, the entire phase, including a 13.9 km underground section of the Pink Line, is expected to be ready no sooner than 2024 after which the metro network will become 116.25 km long.

Bangalore Metro’s Phase 3 project with routes totaling 44.65 km is currently pending approval from the Central Government’s cabinet. Earlier 105 km of routes were planned. From that, 18 km (Central Silk Board – KR Puram) and 38 km (KR Puram – KIAL Airport) of lines have been expedited and are currently be built in parallel with Phase 2 under Phase 2A and Phase 2B respectively.
