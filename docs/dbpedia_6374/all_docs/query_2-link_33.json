        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Central government has declined to grant 'Metro' status to Bengaluru, affecting the higher HRA tax exemption that residents desire. Union Minister Pankaj Chaudhary stated the policy would remain unchanged. Despite Bengaluru’s rapid growth, the government opted to uphold its rational tax policy, leaving the city classified as non-metro for HRA purposes.\n\nDespite being a tech hub and rapid growth, the Centre has refused to grant Bengaluru a 'Metro' status. Union Minister of State for Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, explained on Tuesday that under Rule 2A of the Income-tax Rules, 1962, a distinction is maintained between the cities of Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi, and Chennai, and other places concerning special allowance for residential accommodation under section 10(13A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The four designated metropolitan cities have a 50 per cent salary consideration for computing exemption limits, while other cities, including Bengaluru, have a 40 per cent limit, a Bangalore Mirror report stated.\n\nNo Proposal to Change Policy for Bengaluru\n\nMinister Chaudhary stated, “It has been the stated policy of the Government to rationalise tax rates and move away from exemptions and deductions. Therefore, designating more cities as metro cities and extending the benefit of a higher exemption limit on HRA to such cities contradicts the stated policy.” This means there is no proposal to change the existing policy.\n\nHistorical Demand for Recognition\n\nFor years, there have been demands to recognise Bengaluru as a Metropolitan City for House Rent Allowance (HRA) tax exemptions under income tax laws. If included, residents could claim a 50 per cent exemption on their salary equivalent to HRA, similar to the four designated Metropolitan Cities. This change would provide relief by reducing taxable income in an increasingly expensive housing market.\n\nCentre's Stance\n\nDespite Bengaluru’s rapid urbanisation and significant economic contributions, the government has decided not to revise the tax exemption rules. This decision underscores the ongoing tension between local growth dynamics and national fiscal policies. As Bengaluru continues to expand, the push for metro city recognition may gain further momentum, potentially prompting future reconsideration of tax policies.\n\nPotential Benefits for Bengaluru\n\nIndustrialists argue that classifying Bengaluru as a metro city for HRA purposes would offer notable advantages. Employees would benefit from significant tax savings due to a higher percentage of tax-exempt HRA. “This change would be especially beneficial for those renting accommodations, as it would help them better cope with the high living costs. Moreover, employers would find it easier to attract and retain skilled employees in the competitive job market by offering more appealing job packages that include the revised HRA benefits,” said Satish Jois, an entrepreneur.\n\nMORE STORIES FOR YOU✕\n\n« Back to recommendation stories\n\nI don't want to see these stories because\n\nThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthers\n\nSUBMIT\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
