        "text": "Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha Metro) is proposing to build the 29 km Thane Metrolite light rail transit (LRT) system in Thane, Maharashtra.\n\nThe project consists of one circular line and 22 stations. As the state government awaits central clearance for the Shinde government’s ambitious Thane ring metro project, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) is preparing to issue tenders for the appointment of consultants to plan stations in detail.\n\nAccording to TOI, the Thane Ring Metro project aims to address connectivity gaps between highly populated areas on either side of Ghodbunder Road and the Eastern Express Highway. It will provide an alternative and rapid link to Thane’s congested pockets and railway stations on the Central Railway.\n\nAdditionally, it will serve as a feeder for Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA’s) Metro 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and Metro 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi).\n\nMeanwhile, the 22 stations are – Old Thane, New Thane, Pokhran 1, Upwan, Wagle Estate Circle, Lokmanya Nagar Bus Station, Rayladevi, Gandhi Nagar, Manorama Nagar, Kolshet, Balkum Naka, Saket, Kashinath Ghanekar Auditorium, Manpada, Patlipada, Dongripada, Vijay Nagari, Waghbil, Hiranandani Estate, Bramhand, Azad Nagar Bus Stop and Shivaji Chowk.\n\nThe ring metro is planned to connect with Metro-4 between Wadala and Kasarvadavali, as well as the suburban Thane railway station. Moreover, two of its stations are proposed to be subterranean, with the remaining 20 elevated. Also, Wadavli will see the construction of a train repair depot.\n\nThane’s ring metro project was originally planned as a normal (heavy) metro line but was shelved in 2019 because of cost concerns, and then resurrected as a metrolite or light rail transit (LRT) system in early 2020. Prime Minister Narendra Modi placed the foundation stone in December 2018.\n\nThane Metrolite’s Detailed Project Report was authorised by Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) in December 2020 and is currently pending clearance from the state government. The Ring Road project is anticipated to cost Rs 7,165 crore and is presently pending clearance from the Central Government’s cabinet."
