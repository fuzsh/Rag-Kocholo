        "text": "A farmer was not allowed to use the Namma Metro in Bengaluru after security personnel stopped him when they found his clothes to be \"unsuitable\" for travel. A security supervisor has been sacked after the incident triggered an uproar on social media.\n\nThe farmer, who was wearing a white shirt and carrying a bundle of clothes on his head, was stopped at the security checkpoint at Rajajinagar metro station, even though he had a valid ticket.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a video that has gone viral on social media, the Hindi-speaking farmer is seen standing near the luggage scanner at the security checkpoint. A man, Karthik C Airani, is seen enquiring with the staff about their move to stop the farmer from using the metro.\n\nAirani and another individual told the security staff that the farmer posed no security threat. They said he was only carrying clothes, which was not a violation of the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) rules.\n\nFollowing this, the farmer was subsequently allowed to board the metro. A security supervisor has been sacked in the wake of the incident.\n\nIn response to the incident, the BMRCL said it regretted the inconvenience caused to the farmer and said the Namma Metro is an inclusive mode of transport.\n\n\"Namma Metro is an inclusive public transport. The Rajajinagar incident was investigated and the services of the security supervisor have been terminated. BMRCL regrets the inconvenience caused to the passenger,\" it said in a post on X on Monday.\n\nThe Rajajinagar metro station falls on the Green Line, which connects from Nagasandra to Silk Institute."
