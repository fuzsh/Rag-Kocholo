        "text": "BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2005\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 222\n\nThanked: 64 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nA week before the Metro started operations, I had bought my whole family (including son and his wife who live in BTM) smart cards via BMRCL website. But we didn't travel the Metro due to the enthusiastic crowds!\n\nWe live just 5 minutes walk from Byappanahalli Metro Station so we can wait for our turn, no problem.\n\nThis morning my wife didn't take her car to work and asked me to drop her off at Indiranagar bus stop which is a major round trip for me as we live on the other side of Old Madras Road. Suddenly I remembered the Metro and that we already had the smart card! How silly of us! Instantly she left, and was on the Metro within 10 minutes of leaving home and reached M G Road just 13 minutes later. She called me from inside the Metro; she was so thrilled, usually this time would be taken just to reach Indiranagar!\n\nNow she doesn't need the car for office at least 3 days a week.\n\nYes, the Metro is going to make our dear Bangalore less congested and greener!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by am1m\n\nStarted taking the Metro to work today...\n\nHilarious! Enjoyed your writing style!\n\nDistinguished - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2010\n\nLocation: Pune\n\nPosts: 9,249\n\nThanked: 12,984 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nIt's wonderful that Namma Metro has kicked off and hope that subsequent phases don't take as long as the initial one has.\n\nWhat is disappointing to me is that the IT sector seems to have been completely overlooked when planning the Metro. The fact that neither Electronics City nor Whitefield/ITPL are covered by the Metro even in subsequent phases (refer map) seems to me a shocking omission. Nor are the areas that IT folks commonly reside in, such as Bannerghata Road, Koramangala, BTM Layout, HSR Layout, the entire Outer Ring Road stretch from Silk Board to Kalyan Nagar, etc.\n\nIt's a wasted opportunity- that single move would have got the maximum vehicles off the road. The city centre is already well connected by public transport and autorickshaws so putting the Metro in will probably not create as much value as it would have if the other areas had been covered.\n\nIn any case, we must count our blessings. Will definitely check the metro out first hand when I visit Bangalore next week.\n\nBANNED\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2010\n\nLocation: Bangalore\n\nPosts: 1,262\n\nThanked: 956 Times\n\nre: The Bangalore Metro rail (BMRCL) thread!\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by noopster\n\nWhat is disappointing to me is that the IT sector seems to have been completely overlooked when planning the Metro.

But yes, it hints of a lack of foresight in planning. I don't watch TV or follow the local news - but I am dead certain that after all the noise making and attention grabbing, the news media fails to ask such pertinent questions and its ramifications with what-if scenarios.\n\nOr does anybody recall this question being answered by the Metro planners anytime in the last few years?\n\nIt would also have been nice to extend the Metro right in to BIAL. And from BIAL into the IT corridor ( in the latter phases) ... after all its a revenue generating industry for the economy and the state government. This would have made it compete favorably with Pune and other places as a I.T destination for corporates. And also help the city expand outwards to further encourage de-congestion and overcrowding of traditional city spots.\n\n--Ragul\n\nLast edited by Ragul : 24th October 2011 at 20:43."
