        "text": ".\n\nHighlights\n\nThough platform screen doors may be included in new phase of metro, BMRCL faces three main challenges in implementing them on its existing network\n\nInstalling PSD at single station can cost up to Rs 10 crore\n\nRecent incidents of suicide at metro platforms have underscored the urgent need for enhanced safety measures. Platform Screen Doors (PSDs) are emerging as a crucial solution to mitigate these tragic events. However, implementing PSDs poses three important challenges, particularly for existing metro stations. While the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) plans to install PSDs in upcoming phases of the metro expansion, integrating them into the existing Phase One network is proving to be complex.\n\nA senior BMRCL official explained, “One of the primary technical challenges is synchronising the PSDs with the existing train signalling systems. The implementation requires a sophisticated software upgrade to ensure that the PSDs operate seamlessly with the trains.\n\nThis involves transitioning from the old system to one compatible with PSD technology, a process that is both time-consuming and costly. The integration of PSDs with train signals necessitates a complete overhaul of the existing system. We need to install specialised software to manage this synchronisation, which demands substantial time and technical expertise.\n\nAdditionally, issuing separate tenders for the installation of PSDs introduces further delays.”\n\nCost is another significant hurdle. “Installing PSDs at a single station is estimated to cost around `10 crore. The process must be carefully managed to avoid disrupting passengers, which complicates the installation. Discussions are ongoing to prioritise stations with the highest footfall for PSD installation, but extending this safety feature to all stations will require further planning and resources,” said the official.\n\nConsidering that the financial aspect is considerable, BMRCL is also said to be exploring ways to install PSDs at high-traffic stations first. “Comprehensive implementation will require extensive discussions and budget allocation,” the official added. The Purple Line encompasses 37 stations, while the Green Line includes 29 stations.\n\nThe third challenge involves conducting installations while the metro services are operational. “Implementing PSDs without interrupting train schedules or passenger flow presents a logistical conundrum. Officials need to devise strategies that balance the urgency of the installation with the practicalities of maintaining uninterrupted metro operations.\n\nWe need to carefully plan the installation process to minimise disruption. This involves evaluating various operational scenarios and coming up with effective measures to ensure that trains continue to run smoothly during the installation phase,” the official noted.\n\n.\n\nSafety concerns\n\nPassengers also expressed concern about the ongoing safety issues and support the plan to install PSDs. Suresh Kumar, a frequent commuter, said, “The suicides at the platforms are deeply troubling. While we understand that the installation of PSDs is a complex and costly endeavour, it is essential for our safety. We hope the metro authorities will address these challenges promptly.” Sheetal Rao, another regular passenger, added that she believed that installing PSDs is a crucial step toward preventing these tragic incidents.\n\n“It’s crucial that the authorities find a way to overcome the technical and financial hurdles to ensure our safety. While the installation of Platform Screen Doors in Bangalore’s metro system promises enhanced safety, addressing the technical, financial, and operational challenges is essential for its successful implementation. The commitment to improving passenger safety reflects a broader effort to create a secure and efficient transit environment.”\n\nOne of the primary technical challenges is synchronising the PSDs with the existing train signalling systems. The implementation requires a sophisticated software upgrade to ensure that the PSDs operate seamlessly with the trains\n\n— BMRCL official\n\nNew record\n\nNamma Metro surpassed its previous ridership records with a total of 8,26,883 passengers traveling by Metro on Tuesday, marking the highest footfall to date. Now, Metro officials said that if the ridership continues, it may hit a million by year end once the new phases are operational."
