        "text": "Following a disruption caused by a fallen tree branch on the metro viaduct track between Trinity and M.G. Road stations on the Purple Line of the Bengaluru Metro due to heavy rainfall on June 2 evening, normalcy was restored to metro services on June 3.\n\nTrains started operating smoothly from Challaghatta to Whitefield, adhering to their regular schedule from 5 a.m. In a release on June 3 morning, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), stated, “Today, normalcy of service on the entire Purple Line has been restored, and trains are running as per schedule from Challaghatta to Whitefield.”\n\nBMRCL officials explained that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Forest Department cleared the tree from the track on June 2. “After assessing damages and conducting necessary repairs, train services between the two stations were resumed,” officials added.\n\nOn June 2 at around 7.26 p.m., the train’s loco pilot heading towards M.G. Road noticed a fallen tree on the track shortly after Trinity station. Alerting the operations team, the train was reversed to Trinity Station, where passengers were asked to disembark, and BMRCL refunded their fare.\n\nThe BMRCL stated that emergency protocols were activated to ensure passenger safety and secure the affected area. “The State Disaster Rescue Force - Karnataka, Fire Department, BBMP and the Police dispatched their units to site to ensure safety and clearance of the incident area. Specialized equipment was brought in to expedite the removal process. A team of skilled workers and arborists came into action immediately and worked tirelessly for a period of more than about 4 hours to cut and remove the fallen tree in spite of heavy showers which caused additional hindrances. All the stakeholder’s coordination ensured safety and clearance of the incident area,” the release stated.\n\n“After the removal of the tree from the incident area, a series of comprehensive inspections were carried out under the supervision and guidance of senior officials by BMRCL Maintenance Teams of Fire, Security, Housekeeping Track, Third Rail Traction System, Structural Stability, and Signalling Departments for safe operations. With safety ensured, the operations team conducted trials before resuming normal operations,” the release added.\n\nEarlier in 2018, a branch fell onto the electricity supply line between Lalbagh and Jayanagar stations, causing a power outage and halting train services for around 90 minutes."
