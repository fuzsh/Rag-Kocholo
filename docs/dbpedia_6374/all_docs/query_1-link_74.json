        "text": "New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has flagged-off the Delhi-Faridabad Metro Line that would allow hassle free travel for around two lakh daily commuters between the national capital and the industrial hub in Haryana.\n\nThe extension of the Delhi Metro connects Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar in Faridabad.\n\nThe total cost of the project from Badarpur to Escorts Mujesar is nearly Rs. 2,500 crore. Out of this, Rs. 1,557 crore was borne by the Haryana Government, the Centre contributed Rs. 537 crore, while the Delhi Metro provided Rs. 400 crore.\n\nThe nine stations in this section include, Sarai, NHPC Chowk, Mewala Maharajpur, Sector 28, Badkal Mor, Old Faridabad, Neelam Chowk Ajronda, Bata Chowk and Escorts Mujesar.\n\nbuy kamagra polo online https://lasernailtherapy.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwentytwo/inc/patterns/en/kamagra-polo.html no prescription\n\nAll these are elevated and located on either side of the Delhi-Mathura Road (NH-2).\n\n“The nine-station metro corridor which was 95 per cent indigenously built will provide people a safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable, environment-friendly and sustainable transport facility,” a Haryana government spokesperson said.\n\nHaryana Chief Minister ML Khattar, addressing a press conference on Saturday, had thanked the Prime Minister for “gifting” the Metro service which would take the city to “another level of progress” with better connectivity with other NCR towns.\n\nHe had also said that the Prime Minister would be announcing the go-ahead for connecting Gurgaon with Faridabad by Metro.\n\nBENGALURU (Metro Rail News): Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri Siddaramaiah, announced that the extended Purple Line of Namma Metro in Bengaluru, from Challaghatta to Kadugodi (Whitefield), will start running in September 2023. He shared this news during the Independence Day celebration at Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw Parade Ground on August 15. Siddaramaiah said that the metro train network in Bengaluru is currently 69.66 km long, serving around 6.1 lakh passengers daily.\n\nThe Kengeri-Challaghatta line expansion and the Baiyappanahalli-Krishnarajapura line will be ready by September 2023. The Nagasandra-Madavara extension and a new line between R.V. Road and Bommanahalli are likely to be operational by December 2023. By 2026, Namma Metro aims to have a network of 175.55 km in Bengaluru.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is currently conducting load tests on the Baiyappanahalli-Krishnarajapura line. The BMRCL had previously set a deadline for completing the missing 2-km segment in August. This missing link has led metro passengers to rely on a feeder service to travel a distance of 5 km to reach K.R. Puram after disembarking at Baiyappanahalli. The new K.R. Pura to Whitefield metro line has seen around 27,000 passengers, with higher patronage anticipated when the entire 15.5-km metro line is operational."
