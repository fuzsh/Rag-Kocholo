        "text": "Bangalore Metro's Purple Line is expected to become fully operational from October 6, connecting Challaghatta to Whitefield. The journey across the 42.85 km stretch will be completed in 76 minutes.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nBangalore Metro’s Purple Line is going to be fully operational with the opening of the Krishnarajapuram – Baiyappanahalli and Kengeri–Challaghatta stretches, thereby giving much-needed relief to commuters. The Purple Line of Namma Metro is expected to become fully operational from October 6, according to reports.\n\nThe official inauguration date is yet to be announced, but the opening of the entire stretch of Purple Line is expected soon as the security clearance for the Kengeri-Challaghatta section has been received.\n\nAccording to a Deccan Herald report, the Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) clearance for the stretch has been received recently. CMRS cleared the Kengeri-Challaghatta line for commercial operations on October 3.\n\nOnce these two critical metro lines are inaugurated, the entire Purple Line will cover a total distance of 42.85 km, connecting Challaghatta in West Bengaluru to Whitefield (Kadugodi) in East Bengaluru. The completion of this corridor is anticipated to significantly decongest the notorious traffic in East Bengaluru, which is good news for commuters.\n\nDuring peak hours, commuters can expect a 10-minute frequency between Challagatta and Whitefield (Kadugodi) and a five-minute headway between Pattandur Agrahara and Mysuru Road stations. Additionally, there are plans for short-loop services during peak hours between Nadaprabhu Kempegowda interchange Metro Station, Majestic and MG Road/Byappanahalli.\n\nThe journey from Challaghatta to Whitefield is estimated to take approximately 76 minutes by Metro, with an affordable end-to-end fare fixed at Rs 60. BMRCL officials project a boost in daily ridership from the existing 6.2 lakh to 7 lakh passengers once the Whitefield-Challaghatta corridor is fully operational.\n\nThis development follows the inauguration of the Whitefield-KR Puram Metro section, covering a distance of 13.7 km, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25, 2023. The missing link between KR Puram and Byappanahalli posed significant challenges for passengers, who had to rely on feeder buses to complete their journeys. The completion of these pending stretches marks a significant milestone for Bengaluru's metro system, establishing it as the second-largest metro network in India after Delhi Metro's 350.2 km.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.
