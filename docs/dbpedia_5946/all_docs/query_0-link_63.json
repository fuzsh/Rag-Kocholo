        "text": "Nigeria\n\nPublished on Thursday 23 November 2023 Back to articles\n\nA business profile of Wale Tinubu (b.1967) â the Group CEO of Oando PLC and a nephew of President Bola Tinubu â whose influence has risen since his uncle took office.Â\n\nThe younger Tinubu was part of a government delegation to South Korea in July to discuss collaboration in the mining sector. At the time, his personal interest in the subject was unknown. He has been a major player in the oil and gas sector for decades but has now established a mining company to explore for lithium and bitumen, and is investigating the possibility of manufacturing lithium batteries locally.\n\nThe government has been championing such initiatives. Minister of Solid Minerals Development Dele Alake â who on 21 November revoked over 1,000 mining licences âÂ has insisted that companies mining in Nigeria add some value to the minerals they exploit.Â\n\nAlthough Wale Tinubu appears to be positioned to take advantage of this trend, he is not leaving the oil and gas sector. On 8 September, Oando announced the acquisition of Eniâs subsidiary Nigeria Agip Oil Company Ltd (NAOC) for over a US$1 billion. That would enable Oando to:Â\n\nincrease its stake in oil mining leases 60, 61, 62, and 63 from 20% to 40%\n\nnearly double its oil production\n\nacquire new gas plants.Â\n\nThe deal is similar to one between Seplat and ExxonMobil that was blocked by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd (NNPC) and the Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulation Commission (NUPRC) because of alleged non-compliance with the sectorâs rules and regulations.Â\n\nThe OandoâEni deal is raising hopes that the SeplatâExxonMobil deal will be approved, however, because neither the NNPC or NUPRC will want to deny Wale Tinubu their approval, while neither the President nor the regulatory authorities will want to appear to be favouring his relative. President Tinubu is also the oil minister.Â\n\nOn 15 November, confident that its deal with Eni will be approved, Oando reached an agreement with the pan-African Afreximbank for a US$800 million loan to finance the acquisition. This gives it a line of sight on the cash to conclude the deal, erasing some previous doubts about its capacity to raise the funds.Â\n\nUntil recently the group had been toying with the idea of insolvency after struggling to repay its loans. Now, its fortunes may be changing as it has emerged as one of the main crude oil lifters in recent months.\n\nAlthough the reversal raises questions, there is no evidence that Wale Tinubu is receiving special favours. It appears that he is simply getting more cargoes and is also likely to be granted a mining licence for lithium.Â\n\nThis excerpt is taken fromÂ Nigeria Focus, our monthly intelligence report on Nigeria.Â Click here to receive a free sample copy.\n\nThe November 2023 issue of Nigeria Focus also includes the following:\n\nSpotlight\n\nElectoral malpractice puts Nigerian democracy at risk\n\nEnergy\n\nA favoured nephew?\n\nGetting crude to Dangote\n\nOPL 245 battle dropped\n\nPolitics & Society\n\nOpposition merger unlikely\n\nAPC may gain three states\n\nConcerns about flight safety\n\nThe economy of banditry\n\nProfile\n\nMahmood Yakubu: Compromised or incompetent?\n\nEconomy & Finance\n\nInflation continues to rise\n\nDropping the currency change\n\nSaudi commitment in doubt\n\nRelated articles\n\nNigeria\n\nIs the Dangote Refinery an investment too far for Africaâs richest person?\n\nPublished on Thursday 15 August 2024\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria: Banks raise new money from a challenged investor space\n\nPublished on Thursday 18 July 2024\n\nNigeria\n\nNorthâs âconspiracyâ is unlikely to prevent Tinubuâs re-election\n\nPublished on Monday 1 July 2024\n\nNigeria\n\nProfile: NUPRC CEO Gbenga Komolafe\n\nPublished on Thursday 20 June 2024"
