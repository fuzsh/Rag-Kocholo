        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe business organization or marketing activity can work effectively and profitably in an unhealthy and polluted environment. This means that for oil marketing industry to achieve their (OANDO) corporate and one thrust, survive they competitive environment and advance in the market place or economy, they should take proper recognizance of the environment and its conservation, this effort is mostly called environmentalism. This becomes paramount when it is realized that making profit is no longer they object of industry in today marketing (of product especially oil) world but continuous operations and consumer/public satisfaction. In this research, questionnaire and interviews were used in evaluation of environmental marketing concept in oil and gas industry in Nigeria. Then the data collected from questionnaires and oral interview, 153 respondents were selected from the study., the data collected was analyzed and presented tables, objectives 1 – 3 was achieved using simple percentage while 4 – 5 was achieved using simple regression. The results shows that majority of the respondent were customers and staffs. Giving all the significance, it then becomes an issue that should be absolute and not relative. It should be fully incorporated in the oil industry corporate policy and be properly implemented, otherwise they will be facing a constant negative business operations within OANDO.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTittle page i\n\nDeclaration ii\n\nCertification iii\n\nDedication iv\n\nAcknowledgement v\n\nAbstract vi\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n1.1 Background of the Study 1\n\n1.2 Statement of the Problem 7\n\n1.3 Objectives of the Study 8\n\n1.4 Research Questions 9\n\n1.5 Research Hypothesis 10\n\n1.6 Significance of the Study 10\n\n1.7 Limitations of the Study 11\n\n1.8Definition of Terms 11\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\n2.1 History of Environmental Marketing Concept 11\n\n2.2 Definition of Environmental Marketing Concept 12\n\n2.3 An Overview of Environmental Marketing Concept 13\n\n2.4 The Scope and Implication of Environmental Degradation in Nigeria. 19\n\n2.5 Government and Environmentalism in Nigeria. 21\n\n2.6 The Agonies of the Oil and Gas Communities 25\n\n2.7 Community Reaction to the Oil Companies 24\n\n2.8 Disturbances in Oil Fields 26\n\n2.9.

The objective may be to make profit increase sales volume, increase shareholders interest etc in the list of the objectives of any business enterprise, the one that often come top is to make profit or profit max equation. According to (Udo 2003), oil companies are in the business of prospecting exploring, Gas and marketing both crude and refined oil. But in process of their business, their intrusive activities affect, sometime adversely, the environment and social conditions of carious communities within which they operate.\n\nThough what the companies are prospecting for is a natural endowment, the fact that it is located the people backyard, demands that those affected be accorded some degree of compensation to make up for the devastation of their environment or reduction of the pain of other hazards associated with the company activities. Often, the artisanal activities, upon which the livelihoods of the majority of the people are derived, are disrupted by oil spills which pollute their fishing streams.\n\nThose unaffected by the spills cannot be sure to escape the adversity of gas flares in the environment by oil companies. A situation where the people quality of life contrasts sharply with their status as the goose that sits on the golden egg, is bound to trigger a rash of expectations by the people concerned to redress the trend.\n\nAccording to the Niger Delta Environmental Survey (NDES), in it recent report and findings, the oil companies spread over Delta, Beyelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Abia, Imo Ondo and Edo states suffer large scale deviation and hazardous effects resulting from the intrusive activities by the companies operating in their area (Udo 2003).\n\nAccording to (Ifeanyi 2003) almost every day stories about ugly happenings at these oil/gas communities make newspaper headlines lives are lost, people maimed, farmland destroyed and just as the saying goes, no problem is resolved through fighting.\n\nThis reached a frightening flood tide in 1995 when Ogoni youths protesting alleged degradation of their community by Shell Petroleum Development Company, the oldest and biggest oil and gas industry in Nigeria, took over flow stations, belonging to the industry in the area, held the workers hostage and vandalized some oil installations. This action led to internal violence and murder, which in tumbled to the arrest detention, trial and execution of Ken Soro Wiwa a prominent Ogoni son and eight others of his kinsmen who were convicted to communed murder and causing of civil strife the forced shell to leave Ogoni. It is quite a long time this happened and shell has not returned to the station. There were after effect of the execution against Nigeria. One of Ken was the expulsion of Nigeria from the membership of common wealth (Adebayo 1995).\n\n(Udo 2003) noted that the issues of inadequate compensation to oil and gas communities is as old as history of oil exploration and exploitation in the country. Since the late 50’s the more than 800 communities that make up the Niger Delta area, covering about 70,000 square kilometers of country, has always been the newer of wood and drawers of water used to fire and water the process that generate the energy that sustains the levers of the nations development and growth.\n\nThe several multi-national and indigenous oil and gas companies doing business in the country have over the years been prospecting for gas and crude oil from the area. From where more than 40% of the nation’s earning is derived, yet their rewards have always been unequal to their sacrifices.\n\nThe more than six million population of the region live a life that contrasts sharply with the enormous resources, nature has bestowed in their community or environment.\n\nThey lack the basic necessities of life especially the basic amenities like electricity, portable water, good roads, education facilities and other infrastructures that helps to contribute to their well being (Udo 2003) agreed that is not the responsibility of the companies to cater for the people’s need, but they profitable operations.\n\nThey have an obligation restore to hesitate a process that will demonstrate that they are caring corporate citizens, deserving of an opportunity. It will be fool hardy for the companies to connect the people, having them drilling and carting a ways from their backyard all the crude that fetch billions of foreign exchange would wait for government to provide for all the socio-economic needs.\n\nTo guarantee a cordial relationship, the companies owe the people on obligation to reciprocate their gesture of allowing them exploit the resources in their areas, by identifying with needs for good roads, qualitative education and basic essential infrastructures that will bring about good life.\n\nThe mutually rewarding partnership is the insurance for good business with the community. It is in a bid to redress the glaring neglect of these geese that lay the golden in eggs that this concept of environmental marketing which is the main thrust of this research work in brought to light.\n\nEnvironmental marketing concept has been defined by many people in several ways (Kotler 1987:17) stated that environmental marketing concept held that the organization should determine the needs, wants and interest of target markets and deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors in a way that maintains or improves the consumer, and society’s well being.\n\nThe underlying premises of the concept are;\n\n1. Consumer will increasingly favour organizations which show a concern with meeting their wants and society long run interest.\n\n2. The organization task is to serve so as to get market in a way that produces not only want satisfaction but long-run individual and societal benefit as the key to attracting and holding consumers (Anyanwu 1993:95) noted that this concept has evolved in response to satisfying products/services but also to consider the society’s well being.\n\nThe narrow concept of this concept gave rise to the broad concept of social responsibility of business organization.\n\nIt further emphasizes that is their pursuit of the profit objective, business enterprises have to be able to assemble the resources from local environment and have the stable socio-political and investment climate in which to operate successfully. Social responsibility could also be seen as a duty of business enterprise to ensure that it does not disrupt the life of the communities in which it operates. Others see it as the concern for the welfare of the society which restrains business from engaging in destructive activities, whatever their immediate profitability and their focus on positive contributions to the betterment of the society.\n\n1.2Statement of the Problem\n\nMany years of reckless oil exploration by multinational oil companies seem to have left many communities in Nigeria completely devastated. These communities have as many gas and oil production centres as possible. It is a matter of regret that these communities have nothing positive to show for the gas and oil exploration (Hiliyu 1998) noted that the intensification of oil and gas production activities in these areas has given rise to constant class between oil companies and their host communities. Allegations ranging from socio-economics problems related to unemployment loss of farmlands, poverty and deprivation, inadequate compensation lade of sustained commitment to rural development programmes, deficiencies in existing systems of resources assessments, emanating from the communities with accusing fingers painting at oil companies. Bio-diversity depletion related to aid pollution, soil and water resources degradation, deforestation and water pollution, pressure and over exploitation are also familiar complaints.\n\nThe oil companies however are quick to point out that it is the responsibility o the government to attend to the needs of the communities, since the bulk of oil money filters into government coffers.\n\n1.3Objectives of the Study\n\nThe main objective of the study is to evaluate of environmental marketing concept in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.\n\nThe specific objectives are to;\n\ni.

The research work will help in providing a good environmental friendliness between oil and gas companies and oil gas areas. By so doing there would be improvement in environmental cleanliness avoidance of environmental degradation as well as community development.\n\n2. The communities:- This work will help to reduce the level of environmental degradation and pollution in the oil and gas areas and accelerate the level of development in this areas.\n\n3. The oil and gas companies:- It will sense them to their social responsibilities and as such help in guiding against vandalization of pipelines.\n\n4. Academic:- This work will add to the existing literature on the subject matter for consultation by researchers and students for reference purpose during forth research works.\n\n1.7 Limitations of the Study\n\nThe limitation of the study is element of some problems are;\n\ni. Logistics problems: With the current state of the economy, the researcher experienced difficulties in the research work. Administered to collect research questionnaires.\n\nii. Time constraints:- The time allocated for this research work was not sufficient for a through survey. Hence the researcher was compelled to adjust by reconciling the needed work with the available time.\n\n1.8 Definition of Terms\n\nEnvironmental marketing concept: It holds that the organization task is determine the needs, wants, interest of target markets and to deliver the deserved satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than competitors in a way that preserves or enhances the consumers and the societies well-being, social responsibility: It holds true of those social benefits host communities enjoy from their oil and gas companies."
