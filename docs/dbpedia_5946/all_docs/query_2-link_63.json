        "text": "Our position as a leading integrated energy company operating in Africa gives us the scale and capability to pursue a range of new projects and acquisition opportunities. These include a multitude of farm-in and acquisition opportunities to realise our medium-term to long-term strategy. While our immediate focus is on Nigeria, we are evaluating other opportunities in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nInternational oil companies are increasingly focused on deeper offshore opportunities and have undertaken major onshore divestments, thus offering unique acquisition opportunities for indigenous independents in reserves, resources, and production.\n\nWe are able to identify substantial unused production capacity in shut-in areas which present difficulties to International Oil Companies , but where indigenous companies can operate.\n\nWe stand to benefit immensely from favourable terms granted to indigenous companies that will make previously non-profitable projects profitable."
