        "text": "ECP Investment Earns it Stake in Oando Plc\n\nTuesday, January 8, 2008\n\nEmerging Capital Partners (ECP) announced that is was making a $35 million investment in Ocean & Oil Investments Ltd. (O&OI). O&OI is a Nigerian investment holding company whose main asset is a stake in indigenous firm Oando Plc.\n\nO&OI is Oando’s largest shareholder and provides the company with substantial management and technical support. ECP’s investment was made through subordinated convertible notes.\n\n\"ECP views Oando as uniquely competitive due to its management strength, size, market position, and steady core downstream business,\" said Tom Gibian, CEO of ECP. \"As the largest indigenous company in the market, Oando is poised to capitalize on many opportunities in the market as the Nigerian government seeks to increase the involvement of local companies in the country’s oil and gas sector.\"\n\nO&OI has a major role in developing Oando’s interests in energy services, as well as in the midstream and upstream sectors. The addition of ECP backing is expected to assist Oando in capitalizing on these market segments.\n\n\"ECP’s investment will support Ocean & Oil in its mission to make Oando the premier energy company in West Africa,\" said Navaid Burney, ECP Managing Director. \"We hope to enhance the company’s growth trajectory through our capital as well as our extensive experience in supporting companies with their strategic direction and corporate governance. This company is well placed to experience dramatic growth in the coming few years.\"\n\n\"ECP’s investment in Ocean & Oil validates our belief in the growth potential of Oando PLC in the near to medium- term,\" said Pade Durotoye, CEO of Ocean & Oil. \"Oando has successfully developed a strong operating platform upon which it is launching its dynamic growth and diversification vision. This strategic partnering with ECP is indeed a crucial step in Ocean & Oil’s vision of seeing Oando become the major player in the Nigeria energy sector.\"\n\nThe investment was made through ECP’s $523 million EMP Africa Fund II. The fund was established in December 2005 to capitalize on the numerous investment opportunities throughout Africa in sectors such as telecom, natural resources, financial services, agribusiness, transportation, and power and water.\n\n« GO BACK\n\nYou may also like"
