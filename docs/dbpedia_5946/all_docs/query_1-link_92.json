        "text": "News\n\nGreece expects 70pc fall in gas demand by 2050\n\nGreece expects 70pc fall in gas demand by 2050\n\nLondon, 28 August (Argus) — Greek gas demand will fall by nearly 70pc by 2050 as increasing renewable power installations displace gas in the power generation mix, according to Greece's revised National Climate and Energy Plan (NECP) put out for consultation last week. Gas consumption falls to 44.1TWh in 2030 and then to 16.2TWh by 2050 from 51.2TWh in 2022, under projections in the NECP. This will be driven by renewables displacing gas in the power mix, the replacement of gas units for heating in residential and industrial contexts through electrification, and a rise in the production of biogas and biomethane. Specifically for industry, the NECP assumes that gas demand will gradually decline to just 900GWh by 2050 from 6.6TWh in 2022, while in the commercial and public sector it will drop to 200GWh ( see gas table ). The NECP assumes a \"dramatic increase in the electrification of building heating\" through heat pumps, taking into account the ban on the sale of new oil and gas boilers from 2025, new EU laws on energy efficiency requirements in buildings, and the inclusion of building emissions in the EU emissions trading system. The power sector accounts for the majority of Greek gas demand. The NECP assumes that gas-fired power generation will decline to 10.4TWh by 2030 and 4.8TWh by 2050, far below 19.1TWh in 2022. Gas is displaced by solar and wind, with renewables contributing 96pc of domestic power generation by the middle of the century ( see power table ). But the NECP still foresees installed gas-fired capacity remaining high later into the decade, reaching a peak installed capacity of 7.9GW in 2030 before falling back to 6.4GW in 2050, slightly above 6.3GW in 2022. The government expects Greece to become a net power exporter already in 2035, having been a net importer of 3.5TWh in 2022. Gas-fired plants will remain \"essential to ensure, in all cases, the stability and security of supply of the electricity system throughout the energy transition period\", the NECP says. The plan foresees the need for a national compensation mechanism for gas-fired plants, particularly given the likely expansion of energy storage such as batteries further displacing gas from the power mix in 2030-40. Even some oil plants will potentially need to remain in cold reserve in case of emergency, mostly to ensure supply to some of the Greek islands. And while the plan projects a nearly 70pc drop in gas demand by 2050, it still envisages the expansion of the national transmission system, mostly to facilitate Greece becoming \"the main energy hub of the wider region\". The plan lists seven main gas interconnector projects that are of \"national, regional and international interest\", including the doubling of the Trans-Adriatic pipeline's capacity to 10bn m³/yr, an expansion of the Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria's capacity to 5bn m³/yr, and the implementation of the Dioriga Gas LNG terminal, among others. If transmission system operator Desfa's expansion plans are fully carried out, transit capacity will increase to 8.5bn m³/yr by 2026 from 3.1bn m³/yr at present. However, these plans could be endangered \"if the declared intention to fully decouple the EU from Russian gas is not implemented and if regional needs continue to be met mainly by Russian gas channelled through Turkey\". To avoid significant increases in Greek transmission tariffs, \"only the absolutely necessary investments in the expansion of gas infrastructure\" are promoted, according to the plan. The NECP supports the development of small-scale LNG, enabled through the truck-loading services at Revithoussa and the under-construction bunkering jetty there. Small-scale LNG can displace oil in remote locations not connected to the gas grid, and is also important in decarbonising shipping and heavy land transport, the plan says. Annual biomethane production rises to 2.1TWh by 2030 and 4.6TWh in 2050 from zero at present under the plan. About 80 biogas plants currently produce 1.4 TWh/yr of biogas, and 38 of these adjacent to gas networks could be converted \"relatively quickly\" to biomethane production of about 900 GWh/yr. The remaining 1.2 TWh/yr targeted by 2030 will come from new plants. The NECP also aims to cut Greece's dependence on imports through the development of domestic gas production, if it proves to be commercially viable. Greece has awarded nine onshore and offshore exploration licences, and in April 2022 declared these projects to have national priority. In the past two years, \"investigations have been accelerated\" and drilling decisions are expected in the next two years. If final investment decisions are taken, new domestic production could come on line before the end of the decade. Preliminary estimates put potential and probable reserves in Greece at about 680bn m³, which if exploited would make Greece an exporter already by 2030, according to the NECP. More domestic production increases revenues for the Greek state, which can partly be used to implement the energy transition, the government said.
