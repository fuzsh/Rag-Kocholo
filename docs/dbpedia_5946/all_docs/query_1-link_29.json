        "text": "Oando PLC (referred to as “Oando” or the “Group”), Nigeria’s leading indigenous energy company listed on both the Nigerian and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, in partnership with the Society for Petroleum Engineers (SPE), will be sponsors of the forthcoming SPE Young Professional Forum (YP), themed; ‘Positioning Young Professionals for the Transitioning Future of the Oil and Gas Industry: The Way Ahead’. The event is set to hold at the Wings Office Complex, Ozumba Mbadiwe, Victoria Island, Lagos on March 7, 2020.\n\nThis is the second SPE event, this year, being sponsored by Oando, part of a long term strategy to support platforms of this nature in advancing and building a more robust sector via mentoring, knowledge sharing and networking.\n\nThrough the YP programme, Oando aims to support SPE in the development of young oil and gas professionals of 35 years and below to become tomorrow’s industry leaders; and to establish a resource base of qualified professionals from which the SPE can draw upon to strengthen the organization and industry.\n\nCommenting on the partnership with SPE, Ademola Ogunbanjo, General Manager, Business Support Group, Oando Energy Resources, who will be speaking on the topic “Career Advancement’ at the event said; “The collaboration between SPE and Oando is pivotal to the creation of a knowledge based industry, one where technical expertise and know-how are freely exchanged across organizations through the leadership and coordination of the SPE. At Oando, we constantly seek improved ways of working whilst still delivering value to all our stakeholders. Though we recognize that the oil and gas industry is an old and traditional one, we do not accept that traditional ways of operating must prevail over new thinking and innovation and this is what our partnership will achieve.”\n\nThe YP program is one of many avenues Oando is exploiting to build capacity in the industry. Against a backdrop of a shrinking employment market and rising number of graduates, the Company in 2019 decided to launch the Oando Graduate Accelerated Programme (O-GAP). O-GAP is a bi-annual scheme aimed at up scaling new graduates by giving them hands on experience and structured learning from some of the best minds the industry has to offer through an 18 month training programme. It is one of many ways that the Company believes as a private sector player it can strengthen the local oil and gas talent pipeline and in the medium to long term contribute positively to the economy..\n\nIn addition, the Company was selected by Strathmore University Law School, Nairobi, Kenya in\n\n2019, as the preferred indigenous player for the academia to visit in its quest to acquire sector\n\nknowledge to better equip the students as they enter the new and burgeoning Kenyan oil and\n\ngas sector. The university’s visit to Nigeria was precipitated on a need to take learnings from\n\nleading private and public sector players to enable improved success for Kenya. The selection\n\nof Oando was on the basis of its knowledge pool gained from operational experience across the\n\nfull energy value chain, success stories of pioneering initiatives within the sector, a diverse and\n\nexperienced workforce and finally its impact on both the local and African oil and gas industry.\n\nCommenting further, Ademola Ogunbanjo said; “To remain globally competitive, the onus lies\n\non the continent and indigenous industry leaders both in the oil and gas sector and other sectors\n\nof the economy to collaborate for growth and innovation to move the continent forward. The hope\n\nis that this trend of knowledge sharing and transfer will continue amongst African countries and\n\ncompanies as part of local content development and capacity building.”\n\nAbout SPE YP Program\n\nThe SPE YP forum, aims to provide a forum to engage SPE members with less than 10 years’\n\nexperience, to allow them to stay active in the oil and gas industry and to bridge the gap between\n\nstudents and professionals. To achieve this goal the SPE organizes and promotes technical\n\nlunches, social networking events and career talks. SPE YP programs will aid the acquisition of\n\nprofessional and soft skills, and provide networking opportunities for career advancement.\n\nConference Details\n\nVenue: 7th Floor, Wings Office Complex, 17a Ozumba Mbadiwe, Victoria\n\nIsland, Lagos\n\nDate: March 7, 2020\n\nTime: 8.30 a.m.\n\nTheme: ‘Positioning Young Professionals for the Transitioning Future of the Oil & Gas Industry: The Way Ahead’."
