We operate in an environment that has become more turbulent and the price of oil has significantly declined, returning to a pattern of volatility not seen for years. Global oil prices which commenced a fall mid-2014, as a result of a combination of excess supply and weakening demand across major consumers of energy, continued its free fall in 2015. Oil prices which averaged $52 per barrel in January 2015, slipped to $35 per barrel in December, 2015 (far below the 2015 federal government budget benchmark of $53 per barrel set for 2015). All indicators point to oil prices remaining at low levels in 2016 (at least in the short term), which implies that several adjustments are required in the short to mid- term, while we continue to plan for a profitable long term future that will see increasing demand for energy. The drastic decline in crude oil prices consequently led to various fiscal and economic challenges such as the drop in foreign earnings, strained fiscal budget and huge financial bailout for some state governments, and general cash flow issues in the economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell to 2.84% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 6.23% in the same period in 2014. Unemployment rate which stood at 6.4% in Q4 2014, rose to 9.9% in Q2, 2015 and exchange rate depreciated by over 55 percent from N136/ dollar to N199/ dollar in 2015. On a positive note, the country witnessed a successful and relatively peaceful democratic transition that ushered in a new political administration at the federal level. However, business activities were largely slow for a better part of the year due to uncertainties around the general economic policy direction of the present administration. Our local oil and gas industry is also experiencing positive changes with significant restructuring completed at the NNPC, positioning the corporation for improved transparency and industry engagement. Efforts are also being made to resolve the funding challenges which have hampered production growth in the country. These, coupled with significant reduction in crude oil losses due to improved security of pipelines, provides hope that the operating environment for upstream players such as ourselves will improve going forward. Executing our Strategy In the upstream, the crash in oil prices coincided with our growth into this higher margin upstream sector. Even with the crash in oil prices, the strategic decision taken to partial cash in on our hedge allowed us to pay down ~$224 million of the $900 million of debt utilized for the Conoco Phillip acquisition. Production also commenced at our Qua-Iboe Field. A notable development in our downstream business was the execution of a definitive Sales and Purchase Agreement towards the partial divestment and recapitalization of our downstream business to Helios Investment and the Vitol Group. By virtue of this divestment, we have positioned our downstream business for more capital injection towards a sustained growth and returns for all shareholders. Our Gas and Power business continues to grow from strength to strength as construction works on our 9km Greater Lagos Pipeline Project nears completion. We remain bullish in our commitment to gas and power in this space as the potential the Nigerian market offers is immense. The Oil Field Services business remained challenged by funding issues which have typified the Nigerian Joint Venture operations over the last decade. As such, in line with our goal to deleverage, we took a strategic decision to divest from this line of business in 2015. 2016 Outlook All forecasts point to global crude prices remaining at low levels for 2016, as even the possibility of a production freeze arrangement among oil producers will not be enough to eliminate the current excess oil in the market. Hence, we need to prepare for a period of sustained low oil prices. Cost Management, Risk Management and Disciplined Execution must be our watchwords in 2016. We will focus on deleveraging our balance sheets to create a platform for long term profitability. Cost management will be key and we will ensure disciplined execution of our highlighted corporate initiatives towards achieving long term profitability and guaranteed returns for all shareholders.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT Dear Fellow Shareholder, In recognition of the privilege accorded to me, I hereby present your company’s operational and financial performance for 2015. 2015 was a very volatile year for the oil and gas industry. Oil prices which for the better part of the last five years had averaged $100 per barrel, continued its mid-2014 originated crash (opening at $55 per barrel in January and slipping to $35 per barrel in December, 2015). This unexpected price drop created a new dawn of adversity within the industry as projects which were once economically viable were suspended and global oil companies and services companies, experienced significant asset write downs and impairments totaling billions of dollars. The year was also graced by other challenges that directly impacted our business such as delays in payment of petroleum subsidy receivables, forex scarcity resulting in difficulty liquidating foreign currency loan obligations and liquidity tightness occasioned by shrunk bank portfolio limits in the Oil & Gas sector. Executing our Strategy Against the backdrop of a slowing global growth, and weakening domestic environment we remained steadfast to our commitment to you. We faced each challenge with renewed vigor and recorded significant milestones. In the upstream, we commenced production at our Qua Iboe field at an initial gross rate of 2,150boepd. We also took a strategic decision to restructure our hedge from $97.50/ barrel to $65/ barrel, thus resulting in cash generation of approximately $224 million dollars which we used in significantly reducing our ConocoPhillips debt obligation. We successfully completed the $91 million upsizing of our Reserve Based Loan debt as well as repayment of our $100 million Afrexim subordinated loan facility and also commenced the process towards partial divestment of our Energy Services Company. In the downstream business we entered into a definitive Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with HV Investment, a joint venture co-owned by Helios Investment Partners and Vitol SA. This strategic partnership will significantly deleverage the balance sheet of the business and enable its accelerated growth through increased investment. Furthermore, it will enhance our competitiveness to continue to create value for our stakeholders. Our Gas and Power business continues to be one of our prized and most profitable businesses. We continued construction work on our 9km Greater Lagos Pipeline Expansion (Phase IV) Project which is expected to open up the Ijora - Lagos Island - Victoria Island markets to our gas products. The project is 84.5% completed, with Segment 1 completed and we have started to record new customer connects along the pipeline expansion route. In addition, our pilot Compressed Mr. J. A. Tinubu Group Chief Executive\n\n13. 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 13. Natural Gas offering, which enables customers outside our existing pipeline grid access natural gas for their industrial processes and power generation, doubled its customer base in the year under review. We are in the process of completing the divestment of Akute Power limited, in line with our strategy to move to bigger scale embedded/grid connected power business. 2016 Outlook We expect 2016 to be as challenging as 2015 given the continuous oversupply of crude in the market, driven by the re-entrance of Iran into the export market, increased production from the likes of Iraq as well as a slowdown of the global economy. However, we have pro- actively instituted several initiatives that would enable us face the new oil price challenge with resilience towards maintaining profitability. We have reset your business to deliver value in this new context, scaling back on capital spending and reducing costs while maintaining safe and reliable operations. Our focus is a renewed drive towards cost management, risk management and disciplined execution to ensure every amount spent results in value creation for you our esteemed shareholders. We will continue to actively manage our portfolio and divest from assets where optimal value cannot be derived. Making the right investment choices is of the highest priority in view of the global liquidity constraints. Our three key business drivers remain: Growth, Deleverage and Profitability. The dollar earning upstream and trading businesses will be our growth focus areas while we will achieve reduced leverage via balance sheet optimization. Profitability will be driven through improved cost and capex management focus. In the upstream, whilst the majority of oil producers endure the shock of falling oil prices, we are protected to a certain extent with ~45% of our oil production secured at $65 per barrel. We also have a diversified portfolio, with 60% of our total production being natural gas tied to long term contracts. As the year progresses, we will continue to work with our joint venture partners to execute our development program in 2016, which has been scaled back in response to low oil prices. Our development program is focused on lower risk activities that provide short term returns to our company. We are also actively monitoring oil prices to determine when to cash in our hedge and generate capital towards paying down more of our debt. We will conclude the partial divestment process towards recapitalization of the downstream business by H1, 2016. Post divestment, we will embrace a new and exciting opportunity to further position Oando Downstream as a market leader in the local and global sector. In addition, our Lagos Oando Jetty will be commissioned in Q3, 2016 – a jetty positioned to revolutionize petroleum products supply and distribution within the country. As approved by you our esteemed shareholders, we have commenced the recapitalization and partial divestment from our Gas & Power Business and expect to conclude this process by Q3, 2016. This divestment will result in capital injection to the Group and will create a platform for the Gas & Power business to grow driven by increased investment. We have reset your business to deliver value in this new context, scaling back on capital spending and reducing costs while maintaining safe and reliable operations\n\n14. 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 14.

OANDO ENERGY RESOURCES 2015 ECONOMIC REVIEW: The oil and gas industry is in the midst of a significant structural shift — a move from an era when capital investment decisions were driven by the perception of “resource scarcity” to an era of “abundance”. 2015 was thus a difficult and turbulent time for the industry as traditional energy business models had to be altered in order for companies to survive their new reality. The significant drop in both crude oil and natural gas prices across the year coupled with a high level of uncertainty about their future trajectory challenged oil and gas players in 2015. Crude oil prices, which began the year at US$55 per barrel (Brent), declined to US$37 per barrel by December, the lowest level since May 2004 with natural gas prices experiencing a similar journey. With crude oil production continuing to outpace demand by 2 million barrels per day, and with no clear sign when the market will rebalance, prices have continued to decline in 2016. A range of factors led to greater price volatility. These included uncertainty about the sustainability of US and other production at lower prices, the lifting of Iranian sanctions, geopolitical instability, the economic outlook for China, and concerns about global energy demand. In Nigeria, the newly elected President was quick in taking bold steps which signify that the oil industry is high on his list of priorities. The appointment of a technocrat, gives hope that the NNPC will be run as a company with increased accountability and transparency. The new GMD has been quick to set out his strategy to restructure the corporation, ensure transparency and fully engage with all industry stakeholders. There is a sense of positivity amongst industry players that Nigeria’s oil industry will finally begin to achieve its full potential, albeit tempered by a volatile oil price environment. 2015 ASSET PROFILES OML 60-63 Overview The NAOC JV (20% OER WI; NAOC 20% and operator; NNPC 60%) holds OMLs 60, 61, 62 and 63, located onshore in the Niger Delta and the licenses have an expiry date of June 14, 2027. OML 60 is located on land, in the northern Niger Delta and covers an area of 358 km2 (88,464 acres). OML 61 is also located on land, in the northern Niger Delta and covers an area of 1,499 km2 (370,410 acres). OML 62 terrain varies eastwards from swamp to land and is located in the central Niger Delta, covering an area of 1,221 km2. OML 63 is located along the coastal swamp area of the Niger Delta and covers an area of 2,246 km2 (554,998 acres). OER’s gross share of total production sold from NAOC JV in 2015 was 16.6 MMboe (comprised of 5.7 MMbbls of oil, 58.5 Bscf of gas and 1.2 MMbbls of natural gas liquids). Therefore, in 2015, OER’s gross share of daily production sold from NAOC JV averaged 45,565 Mboe per day (consisting of 15,561 bbls/d of oil, 160,030 MMscf/d of gas and 3,332 bbls/d of natural gas liquids). As of December 31, 2015, OER held a net share in the NAOC JV 2P reserves of 427 MMboe (comprised of 152.3 MMbbls of oil, 12.5 MMbbls of natural gas liquids and 1,573.6 Bscf of gas), gross Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 78.2 MMboe, gross Best estimate of risked (defined as risk for chance of development) Contingent resources of 19.1 MMboe, gross Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 51.5 MMboe and gross Mean estimate of risked (defined as risk for chance of geologic success) Prospective resources of 19.5 MMboe. The assets of the NAOC JV also include extensive infrastructure, comprising 12 Flowstations, an oil processing centre, an oil export terminal, three gas plants (Kwale, Ob-Ob and Ogbainbiri), the Kwale-Okpai IPP, a network of approximately 1,190 km of pipelines and associated infrastructure Upstream\n\n16. 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 16. including, roads, power stations and heliports. Some of the NAOC JV’s main export pipelines are used by third parties and agreements are in place for transportation and processing. In addition, some gas is supplied from the Akri field to the Oguta plant. Reserves have been attributed to Beniboye in OML 62, which is currently not producing. The wells and flowstation are capable of producing but production stopped in 2013 after the asset was vandalized. Prior to that incident, the field was producing about 2,000 barrels of oil per day, which was evacuated to Shell-operated Forcados Terminal 10km away. Capital Budgets and Budgeted Capital Expenditure: During 2015 capital expenditures on OMLs 60 to 63 totalled $41.3 million. Capital expenditures during the period included $11.7 million spent on development drilling and completion activities in the Ogbainbiri Deep 4 well, $27.5 million was spent on pipeline and facility upgrades and $2.1 million was spent on geophysical exploration studies and other assets. The reduction of capital spending in 2015 compared to the budgeted amount was due to project delays and a reduction of spending as a result of the lower crude oil and natural gas price environment. In 2016, the Corporation estimates that a total of $60.0 million will be spent at OMLs 60 to 63, consisting of $44.4 million directed to facilities for asset integrity, water disposal and flare down, and $15.6 million on drilling three development wells and a workover. OML 56 (EBENDO) Overview Ebendo Marginal License (42.75% OER WI; Energia, an indigenous company and operator, 55% WI), was carved from OML 56 in the central Niger Delta, approximately 100 km north-west of Port Harcourt. The License covers an area of 65 km2 (16,062 acres). The License includes two fields, the Ebendo field (producing), Obodeti field (undeveloped) and one prospect, Ebendo North. Ebendo operates under Marginal Field terms that benefit from advantageous fiscal terms. OER’s gross share of total production sold from Ebendo in 2015 was 1.294 MMboe (consisting of 0.623 MMbbls of oil and 4.027 Bscf of gas), hence OER’s company gross share of daily production sold from Ebendo averaged 3,545 Mboe per day (consisting of 1,706 bbls/d of oil and 11,034 MMscf/day of gas). As of December 31, 2015, the Ebendo License held net 2P reserves of 8.8 MMboe (comprised 5.4 MMbbls oil and 20.3 Bscf of gas), gross Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 1.4 MMboe, gross Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 1.0 MMboe, gross Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 2.4 MMboe and gross Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 1.2 MMboe. Capital Projects and Budgeted Expenditure During 2015, the Corporation incurred $1.7 million in capital expenditures at Ebendo, which included the pipeline facility enhancements and drilling site preparation costs. Throughout 2016, the Corporation has estimated $6.7 million in capital expenditures for five well workovers, a storage tank and Umugini pipeline upgrades. OML 13 (QUA IBO) Overview Qua Ibo (40% OER WI and technical partner; NEPN, an indigenous company, 60% WI and operator) is located in onshore Nigeria, near the mouth of the Qua Iboe River, immediately adjacent to the ExxonMobil Qua Ibo Terminal. The License covers an area of 14 km2 (3,459 acres) and includes one producing field (Qua Ibo). The Qua Ibo License was acquired by OER during 2013 and it operates under Marginal Field terms that benefit from advantageous fiscal terms. Production from the Qua Ibo field began in 2015 and the field currently has two producing wells and one shut -in well. OER’s gross share of total production sold from Qua Ibo in 2015 was 0.282 MMbbls of oil, hence OER’s gross share of daily production sold from OML 125 averaged 772 bbls/d of oil. As of December 31, 2015, Qua Ibo License held net 2P reserves of 3.7 MMbbls of oil, gross Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 0.3 MMboe and gross Best estimate risked Contingent resources of 0.2 MMboe. In its capacity as technical services provider, ORPS oversees, together with NEPN, the operations on Qua In Nigeria, the newly elected President was quick in taking bold steps which signify that the oil industry is high on his list of priorities.\n\n17. 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 17. Ibo. ORPS agreed to fund some of NEPN’s costs on Qua Ibo until first oil, following which ORPS will be entitled to 90% of NEPN’s sales proceeds from its 60% share of crude oil production until NEPN’s obligation plus a 10% fee is paid in full. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure In 2015, the Corporation incurred capital expenditures of $3.8 million at Qua Ibo on pipeline and crude oil facility costs. The Qua Ibo field commenced production late February 2015 and realized its first sales from production in the second quarter of 2015. The Corporation revised its 2015 budget from $0.6 million capital spending to $3.8 million to account for additional facility requirements for water handling, in addition to the previously planned facility enhancements. In 2016, the Corporation has budgeted $0.9 million to be spent on gathering facilities and water treatment facilities. OML 125 (ABO) Overview OML 125 (15% WI; Eni, operator, 85% OER WI) is located approximately 40 km offshore from the western Nigerian coast in water depths ranging from 550 m to 1,100 m. The License covers an area of 1,983 km2 (490,010 acres). The License includes one producing field (Abo field), one undeveloped discovery (Abo North) and 13 prospects. OML 125 operates under a Production Sharing Contract. Production from the Abo field began in 2003 and the field currently has four producing wells, two other wells are shut-in pending flowline repairs while another is waiting on arrival of the Xmas tree. In addition there are two water injection wells and two gas injection wells. OER’s gross share of total production sold from OML 125 in 2015 was 1.2 MMbbls of oil, hence, OER’s gross share of daily production sold from OML 125 averaged 3,313 bbls/d of oil. As of December 31, 2015, OML 125 held net 2P reserves of 5.8 MMbbls of oil, gross Best estimate unrisked Contingent resources of 1.1 MMboe, gross Best estimate of risked Contingent resources of 0.6 MMboe, gross Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 16.6 MMboe and gross Mean estimate of risked Prospective resources of 7.0 MMboe. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure The Corporation incurred $36.4 million of capital expenditures during 2015 at OML 125 related to gathering and transportation infrastructure enhancements and facility maintenance. The enhancements included $23.1 million spent on Abo phase 3 gathering and transportation construction, $4.2 million on well completion costs at Abo 12, $5.6 million on its FPSO on capital maintenance, and $3.5 million on other capital maintenance projects. The significant reduction of capital spending in 2015 compared to the budgeted amount was primarily due to delaying planned projects as a result of the lower crude oil and natural gas price environment to ration capital spending. The Corporation has an agreement to divest out of the OML 125 asset in 2016. Therefore, no capital spending has been budgeted in 2016 for OML 125. OML 90 (AKEPO) Overview Akepo Marginal License (40% WI and technical partner; Sogenal, operator, 60% WI) was carved from OML 90 and located in shallow waters (<20m) of the western Niger Delta.

BLOCKS 5 AND 12, EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE OF SAO TOME PRICIPE OER holds its interest in Blocks 5 and 12 through its 81.5% interest in Equator Exploration Limited (EEL). In February 2010, in accordance with agreements signed in 2001 and 2003, the government of STP awarded OER Blocks 5 and 12, located within the country’s EEZ. Block 5 has an area of 2,844 km2 and the water depth within the block ranges from 2000 to 2500 m. Existing 2D seismic data over the block were reprocessed in 2014 and interpreted to identify several prospects. In 2015, 3D seismic data was acquired over an area of 1400 km2. The processing of the newly acquired 3D seismic data was completed in December 2015 and interpretation of the 3D is currently ongoing to further mature identified prospects for exploration drilling in 2017. In December 2015, EEL agreed to farm out 65% of its participating interest in Block 5 for $7.4 million to equalize past costs and will retain a 20% participating interest, with a 50% carry up to $9.0 million each for both Phases II and III. EEL also entered into an agreement to farm out 65% of its participating interest in Block 12, retaining a 22.5% participating interest with a carry of the first $2.0 million of OER’s portion of project costs.

OPL 321 AND OPL 323 Overview OPL 321 and OPL 323 (24.5% WI; operator KNOC) are located adjacent to OML 125, offshore from the Nigerian coast, at a water depth of 950 m to 2,000 m. The Licenses cover a combined area of 2,147 km2 (530,535 acres). The Licenses are presently the subject of a dispute between the operator, KNOC, and the Nigerian Government. Due to this ongoing dispute, since 2008 exploration on these Licenses has not been possible and as a result, OER requested and received a refund of the aggregate signature bonus paid by OER in respect of the two Licenses ($162 million). No wells have been drilled on the Licenses to date. The License includes five sizeable prospects (Gorilla, Lobster, Octopus and Whale (OPL 323) and Elephant (OPL 321)). As of December 31, 2015, OPLs 321 and 323 jointly held gross Mean estimate unrisked Prospective resources of 826.5 MMboe and gross Mean estimate risked Prospective resources of 197.2 MMboe. Capital Projects and Budgeted Capital Expenditure on Non- producing Licences Other than as set forth above, asset capital expenditures include spending on OML 131, OML 134 and EEL. During 2015 the Corporation spent $4.7 million to advance exploration of the respective properties with geological and technical studies. In 2016, the Corporation estimates that $5.7 million will be expended on exploration projects and corporate assets. The exploration is focused on OML 131, OML 145 and Block 5, to assess the geological and geophysical aspects of the project areas, along with the environmental impacts through technical studies and seismic acquisition. OPL 236 Oando Exploration and Production Limited was awarded this block in May 2007 and the PSC was signed with NNPC in February 2008. This conferred OEPL with a 95% working interest and operatorship of the block. RFO Ventures is the local content vehicle (LCV) with a 5% participatory interest. The block is located onshore Akwa Ibom State with a total acreage of 1,650 km2. A Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMOU) was signed with the Ukana community in August 2008. OPL 236 is currently in the exploration stage. In 2010, 2D seismic data for OPL 236 was purchased and digitized. Work is ongoing on a development program aimed at harnessing the gas reserves in line with the proposed industry gas master plan and delivering the much needed clean energy for the growing energy needs of the utilities and power industry within the region. OPL 278 In January 2006, OEPL acquired a 60% working interest pursuant to a PSC between the Group, CAMAC, Allied Energy and First Axis and the NNPC, in respect of OPL 278. OPL 278 is operated by OEPL under a joint operating agreement (“JOA”) made between OEPL, CAMAC, Allied Energy and First Axis.

Oando Marketing Plc (OMP) is a leading Nigerian oil marketing firm with over 400 retail outlets Nationwide and industrial customers operating in various sector of the Nigerian economy, as well as having operations in Ghana and Togo. OMP’s activities cover the sales, marketing and distribution of petroleum products including Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), Low Pour Fuel (LPFO), Lubricating Oils, Greases, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG - cooking gas), and Bitumen. 2015 Review 2015 saw a continuation in the declining oil revenues to Nigeria which began in 2014, due to the global fall of crude prices in the international market. This decline created trade deficits which in turn led to a fall in the value of the Naira. Consequently, the Central Bank pursued an intervention policy that reduced Nigeria’s external reserves. The policy proved unsustainable, therefore leading the apex bank to explore other measures. First of these was to close the Retail Dutch Auction System (RDAS) of bidding for FOREX. The closure led to exchange rate “fixing” thereby inhibiting capital mobility. The economic situation affected many sectors of the Nigerian economy and the Oil and Gas sector was no exception. One of such effects on Oando was the perennial issue of delayed subsidy payments. These became worse during the year, with the government owing backlogs of up to 199 days. This was an increase of 73% from an average of 115 days in 2014. The resultant effect of this was an increase in the interest payable to banks for trade finance by the company. Also, scarcity of FOREX within the economy made it difficult for us to secure financing for product importation. However, despite these challenges, Oando recorded successes, these include: Partial Divestment: In July 2015, we signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with our potential investors. This was an important step in the divestment process which began in 2014. • Improvement in our retail infrastructure: Our continued commitment to market leadership in the retail sector was further reflected in the upgrade of our Falomo & Ijora service stations. • Improved Operational Infrastructure. • Our Apapa marshalling yard was upgraded to ensure more effective loading operations. Trucks can now be coordinated more efficiently, and also transport vendors benefit from improved turnaround time. • Apapa LPG plant filling capacity was upgraded from 15mt/day to 30mt/ day, a 100% increment. • Benin plant was upgraded to best in industry safety standards. IT Solutions (ROMS): The launch of the Retail Online Monitoring System (ROMS) at our service stations nationwide seeks to replace the manual daily sales record book (DSRB) with an automated solution. As at end of the year, 13 service stations ran on this application. Benefits of this solution include: • Improved station efficiency by providing real-time station information to stakeholders • On the-spot insight to station management. • Reduced human errors and irregularities. • Automated OMP’s Retail Outlet’s Daily sales record book. • Remote Head office visibility into sales, pumps and stock performance at all stations. Product launch: The launch of our new and improved Oleum bottle took place in June. This is geared towards improving market penetration for our brand of lubricants, thereby increasing market share. These initiatives are geared towards protecting and growing our existing market share by improving our comparative advantage with respect to other marketers in Nigeria. Product Review PMS sales volumes fell by 29% to 600,000MT compared to 917,000MT the previous year part driven by challenges in securing credit for imports driven by foreign exchange scarcity. The sectorial credit limits for the sector were reduced and this also had an adverse effect on liquidity. AGO volumes sold during the year stood at 199,000MT, a 28% drop from 2014 level. HHK sales also dipped by 70% to 27,600MT due to supply challenges. Other products (Lubricants, Specialties) ATK volumes for the year were 128,600MT, a 9% increase from 2014. This was driven by increased bulk sales to other marketers off the back of competitive product sourcing. Lubricants volumes reduced by 20% to 11,242MT in 2015 compared to 14,029MT prior year. The launch of the Oando Marketing\n\n27. 2015 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 27. new “transformer” bottles for our Oleum brand necessitated a slowdown of sales in order to exhaust stock of the old bottles. This transition period lasted 4 months. LPG sales stood at 31,159MT. This is a 19% reduction from the 38,440MT sold in 2014. 2016 Outlook Despite the general downturn in the Nigerian economy, we have various initiatives geared towards driving our performance in 2016. Some of these include but are not limited to: • Conclusion on the partial divestment of Oando Marketing from the Group. The divestment process is expected to be concluded in H1 2016. This process will offer an opportunity to leverage on expertise of our potential investors in the downstream value chain and create a synergy which will optimize overall shareholder wealth. • Continued deployment of business intelligence tools to improve efficiency of our operating systems and save costs. • Complete the upgrade of our Enugu and Kaduna filling plants to conform to regulatory standards. • Conversion of a minimum of forty restaurants from cooking sources other than Gas to Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) nationwide as well as market storms nationwide to promote our specialty products • Periodic promotions during the festive seasons during the year e.g. Easter, Ramadan etc. to boost sales of all products. • Increase our strategic partnerships with various stakeholders in the oil and gas industry to increase our brand exposure. • Continuation of our African Skills Development Initiative. • Continued execution of our LPG strategies; the Cylinder Exchange Scheme, Secondary Distribution Point (SDP) and Microfinance Bank (MFB) partnerships. 20 additional SDPs and MFBs will be engaged through the year. Our LPG products will also be distributed in Independent service stations signed up as partners • Upgrade of five service stations to increase earnings potential. • Continuous upgrade of our safety standards and ensuring adherence to standards as well as investing in the education of staff and 3rd party contractors to ensure zero fatalities in their operating and physical environments. Supply and Trading Oando Supply and Trading (OST) provides management and advisory services to support the procurement and trades of a broad range of refined products from the traditional white products; Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) & Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK) to other specialty products like Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), Naphtha, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Fuel Oils (FO), Base Oils and Bitumen. Terminals Oando Terminals and Logistics (OTL) is the infrastructure management company of Oando Downstream saddled with the responsibility of: • Monetizing Oando’s Apapa mid- stream Jetty; • Optimizing Oando Marketing’s terminal infrastructural assets to ensure maximum value and return of investment for the shareholders; • Identifying infrastructure gaps in the downstream sector and working with strategic partners to develop the required infrastructure. 2015 Review Key achievements in the year under review include: • Tie-ins of the Apapa Mid-stream Jetty to four terminals via a 2km Horizontal Directional Drilled (HDD) pipeline. • AGO Tank Conversion: Conversion of a 5,500MT PMS tank for AGO storage. Hitherto there was no AGO storage in the South-West region of the country and we had to pay throughput and storage charges to 3rd party facilities to meet our AGO sales volumes. This tank will also improve optimization of the Apapa Mid- stream Jetty and generate income through storage fees charged to 3rd parties. • Commissioning of a 14m Litre PMS tank at Apapa; Features of this new tank include; • Compliance with the most recent safety and operational standards including but not limited to API 650 and NPFA 16. • Use of an internal floating roof which reduces operational losses by 99% when compared with existing tanks in the axis. • Equipped with automatic level transmitters and emergency foam pourers reducing the response time for emergency situations With this, storage capacity in Oando’s Apapa Terminal in Lagos has been increased by 44% to 32million liters. Outlook Key projects and activities planned for 2016 include: • Commissioning of the Apapa Mid- stream Jetty in H1 2016. • In addition to the four terminals already connected, Oando aims to connect the Apapa Mid-stream Jetty to other terminals within the Apapa axis increasing connection to PMS storage of 200,000MT. • Commence the upgrade of our Apapa Terminal increasing storage by 13,000MT. Oando Foundation In line with our commitment towards corporate social responsibility and creating positive impacts in every community we operate in, the Oando Foundation will be expanding the Adopt-a-school Initiative (AASI) to 100 schools across 23 states and the FCT in 2016. In addition to this, we intend to achieve the following activities through the foundation in 2016: Enrolment of 15,000 school children; awards of 500 scholarships; renovation of a minimum of 15 schools; and training of 705 class teachers and head teachers. Conclusion To succeed in the business climate we are witnessing today is both demanding and challenging. Yet our present position is a vindication of our perseverance and dedication. We will continue to ensure we pro-actively identify business challenges and face them promptly with renewed vigor towards achieving sustainable solutions hence guaranteeing returns for our shareholders. On behalf of the board of directors, I thank you for your faith in us during these times and assure you of our continued commitment towards returning our company to profitability in the 2016. Mr. J.

The Company commenced operations in 1956 as a petroleum- marketing company in Nigeria under the name ESSO West Africa Inc., a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation (“Exxon”), and was incorporated under Nigerian Law as Esso Standard Nigeria Limited (“Esso”) in 1969. In 1976, the Federal Government acquired Exxon’s interest in Esso; Esso was nationalised and rebranded as Unipetrol Nigeria Limited (“Unipetrol”). A process of privatisation began in 1991 when the Federal Government divested 60% of its shareholding in Unipetrol to the public. Unipetrol’s shares were listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (the “NSE”) in February 1992, quoted as Unipetrol Nigeria PLC. Under the second phase of the privatisation process, the Federal Government sold its remaining shareholding in Unipetrol. In 2000 Ocean and Oil Investments (Nigeria) Limited, the Company’s major shareholder (“OOIN”), acquired 30% in Unipetrol from the Federal Government. The residual 10% stake held by the Federal Government was sold to the public in 2001. In August 2002, Unipetrol acquired a 60% stake in Agip Nigeria Plc (“Agip”) from Agip Petroli International. The remaining 40% of the shares in Agip was acquired by Unipetrol by way of a share swap under a scheme of merger. The combined entity that resulted from the merger of Unipetrol and Agip was rebranded as Oando PLC in December 2003. In 1999, Unipetrol acquired a 40% stake in Gaslink Nigeria Limited (“Gaslink”); this stake was subsequently increased to 51% in 2001.
