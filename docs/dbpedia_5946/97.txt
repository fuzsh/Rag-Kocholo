Oando PLC is Africa’s leading indigenous energy company operating in the up, middle and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry. The brand has a primary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and it is the first African company to have a cross-border inward listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

Oando’s story started 1956 with the formation of Esso Africa, a downstream marketing company, a subsidiary of the Exxon Corporation of USA. The Nigerian government acquired a controlling stake and then becoming a Public Limited company. The stake was later acquired by Ocean and Oil which gave birth to Oando.

The group is broadly divided into two companies, who are leaders in their categories-

Oando Energy Resources, a leading E&P player in the Nigerian Oil and Gas sector, exploiting unique acquisition opportunities for indigenous independents. It has robust portfolio of oil and gas fields in onshore and offshore producing assets, across the Niger Delta basin and on the continental shelf.

Oando Trading (OTD) is a supply and trading company and a fully-owned subsidiary of Oando PLC. OTD is a key participant in international oil markets with a significant presence in the West African region, and direct access to major energy markets across Africa via its offices in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa.

In the past year, the company exported 57 million barrels of crude oil jointly with its JV partners, and traded just under 3 million metric tonnes of refined petroleum products.

Proudly indigenous and ambitious in its approach, Oando has a home grown understanding of Africa’s unique terrain and is committed to using its work to positively change the continents narrative. Leveraging local insights with a global perspective pivoted on the uniqueness and innovative excellence of a dedicated workforce, Oando audaciously leads the charge to use energy as a transformative tool to engender sustainable development in Africa.
