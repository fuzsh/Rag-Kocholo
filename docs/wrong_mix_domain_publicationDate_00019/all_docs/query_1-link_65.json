        "text": "Science fiction will forever be my favorite genre, and while I love many contemporary works from such a range of diverse authors, I just adore classic sci-fi. From the Golden Age of the 1930’s and 40’s (the pulp magazine era) to the New Wave of the 60’s and 70’s (the sex, drugs, and rock and roll era), there’s something for everyone’s taste. The Stars My Destination (also known as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK where it was first published as a novel in 1956) is an interesting novel to review. While it does contain many of the classic tropes of early science fiction, many of its ideas and plotting makes you feel as though you’re reading a work from a much later period. Often, this book felt like an 80’s cyberpunk novel. Despite it being over 70 years old, it still feels surprisingly relevant. Alfred Bester had been writing science fiction for over two decades when this was published, but he had also worked extensively in the world of comics. In fact, you Green Lantern fans out there can thank Bester for being the creator of “The Lantern Oath.” As a result, many of this novel’s ideas feel like they would fit it nicely to today’s modern comics or even television shows. This author was also well-versed in literature, making The Stars My Destination an exciting novel that pays homage to classic literature while also helping to usher in New Wave science fiction. Bottom line, this book is just so much fun!\n\nThe Stars My Destination takes place in the distant future, and begins with a chapter that chronicles the social changes brought about by the discovery of humanity’s innate ability to teleport, known as “jaunting.” Typically, this ability is limited in most people to very short distances. While it has brought forth many benefits, it has also created some negative impacts on society. The first chapter felt like a short story all on its own, and it was written well enough to already turn me into a hardcore fan of Alfred Bester. The next chapter introduces us to the novel’s protagonist Gulliver “Gully” Foyle. We first discover him as the lone survivor on a spaceship known as the Nomad. Clearly, something disastrous has occurred to the rest of the crew, but we are given no information regarding the events that led to here. Gully has been alone in deep space for several months, but a spark of hope occurs when another spaceship called the Vorga arrives. Gully believes he is finally saved, but after signaling the ship, he is subsequently abandoned. From that moment on, he makes it his life’s mission to extract revenge on the crew of the Vorga. Thus, a modern retelling of The Count of Monte Cristo begins.\n\n“He recoiled in terror as the orderly thrust the picture of a hideous tattooed face before him. It was a Maori mask, Cheeks, chin, nose, and eyelids were decorated with strips and swirls. Across the brow was blazoned NOMAD. Foyle stared, then cried out in agony. The picture was a mirror. The face was his own.”\n\nIf you’re looking for a novel that has a relatable protagonist, I’m afraid to inform you that this will not happen here. In fact, if you do find yourself relating to Gully Foyle, I can only assume you are completely deranged because he is a complete psychopath. Sure, life has been hard, and he suffers more than one traumatic ordeals, but he is a completely irredeemable character. This is a man that has murdered and raped, and he repeatedly uses others throughout the novel as a means to an end in his plans for revenge. Despite being a protagonist with no morality whatsoever, you will find yourself hoping he achieves his vengeance because the people he goes up against are so much worse. You’ll read the novel because of its pace and thrilling action, not because you connect to anyone in this book. They are just awful.\n\nBester manages to create a work that is both daring and innovative, bringing plenty of unique concepts into this novel. Early in the novel, we are introduced to a cult that worships science and marks their members with hideous face tattoos. Organized religion is against the law, so worshipping has to be done behind closed doors in secret. As Gully spends time educating himself, he also enhances his strength and speed through cybernetic implants. Often, this novel feels like a work by Robert A. Heinlein or Philip K. Dick, particularly later when the final pages feel like you just did hard drugs. Most of all the cyberpunk elements are still contemporary, and I can easily see this novel made into a gritty television series.\n\nWhile the end of the novel doesn’t quite hold the potential of the first part, it is an interesting journey along the way. Overall The Stars My Destination shows that Alfred Bester was an explosive talent who can easily hold his own against some of the biggest names in science fiction. In addition to being a great page-turner, its influence on the later movements of the genre cannot be denied. Its a trailblazing work that remains just as entertaining today.\n\n“It isn’t necessary to have something to believe in. It’s only necessary to believe that somewhere there’s something worthy of belief.”"
