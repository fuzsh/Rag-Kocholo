        "text": "August 14, 2020\n\nThis is my favorite classic science fiction novel. It is rich in incident, ambitious in conception, terse and unemotional in style, and fiercely Romantic in theme. Although it is a revenge tale based on The Count of Monte Cristo, its heart is perhaps closer to Frankenstein, but to a Frankenstein in which the monster is capable of self-redemption, of moving beyond isolation and bitterness toward an enlightened humanity. And all the things that are good about this novel are embodied in its hero—Caliban and Hamlet, Satan and Samson, Cain and Prometheus combined—the brute-genius Gully Foyle.\n\nDuring a war between the Inner and the Outer Planets, Gully Foyle—unlettered, unskilled, amoral—is adrift upon the wreck of the space ship The Nomad, the sole survivor of an attack. When the friendly ship Vorga knowingly passes him by, he becomes consumed by the desire for revenge. It is this passion which motivates him throughout a series of crimes—including (but not limited to) blackmail, rape, and murder--as he transforms himself into the elegant Geoffrey Fourmyle, still searching for the person who years ago decided to leave poor Gully Foyle for dead.\n\nFoyle's search takes place in a future world dense with marvels and horrors: wide use of individually initiated teleportation (“jaunting”), heartless mega-corporations, occasional telepathy, vast underground prisons, a cargo cult with cool tattoos, a cathedral housing a circus, a mysterious substance (\"PyrE\") which may either consume or transform our world, and the fragmentation of time.\n\nThis is a very entertaining novel, but also a thoughtful one. Its ending is ambitious and outrageous, exalting The Hero, Democracy and Freedom, and yet acknowledging the ignorance, darkness and oppression from which these gifts inevitably spring. I can give it no better praise than to say I think Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and Mr. and Mrs. Shelley--and, yes, Dumas pere too--would have liked it a lot.\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nThe golden age of science fiction… The Stars My Destination is a golden book of the golden age…\n\nThis was a Golden Age, a time of high adventure, rich living, and hard dying… but nobody thought so. This was a future of fortune and theft, pillage and rapine, culture and vice… but nobody admitted it. This was an age of extremes, a fascinating century of freaks… but nobody loved it.\n\nIt is the book of loving and hating… the story of surviving and avenging… the tale of finding riches and identity… The saga of chasing and being chased…\n\nHe ignited the jets, blew the laterals for three seconds and then the forwards. The Weekender lifted easily, shaking debris from her back and sides like a whale surfacing. As she slid up and back, Foyle called: “Dynamite, Jiz! Now!”\n\nThere was no blast; there was no flash. A new crater opened in the asteroid below him and a flower of rubble sprang upward, rapidly outdistancing a dull steel ball that followed leisurely, turning in a weary spin.\n\nMan needs myths… Ancient man dreamt of gods… Modern man dreams of faraway destinations.\n\nDecember 4, 2013\n\nGully Foyle is my name\n\nTerra is my nation\n\nDeep space is my dwelling place\n\nThe stars my destination\n\nSci-fi from its formative days is funny. Not funny ha-ha (not always anyway), but funny-weird…at least for me. I am often unable to get over the clunky writing and wispy plots despite the many cool ideas on display. Sometimes even a premise as cool as a galaxy-spanning empire held together by the prods and pokes of a few cognoscenti using an arcane sociological science still can’t make a plodding plot with artless prose and paper-thin characters readable to me (sorry, Mr. Asimov). At other times the founders of the genre can suffer by comparison to their descendants who have taken the ideas that, while new and fresh when they used them, seem old and tired when you come to the foundational works after seeing them presented elsewhere, often with more compelling characters and well-crafted prose. Then there are books like this one, written by Alfred Bester, and you understand why some classics are still classics.\n\nGully Foyle is a gutter-boy. A low, brainless brute barely able to act as a Mechanic’s Mate 3rd class on the spaceship ‘Nomad’, oiling and wiping the machines and acknowledged by his superiors to be a human dead end. Then the passing ship ‘Vorga’ left him to rot, the only survivor on a crippled ship in the void.\n\nSo, in five seconds, he was born, he lived, and he died.\n\nAfter thirty years of existence and six months of torture,\n\nGully Foyle, the sterotype Common Man, was no more. The\n\nkey turned in the lock of his soul and the door was opened.\n\nA purpose had been found that could open up all of the potential this beast-man had within him: vengeance. From here we follow Foyle as he lifts himself out of the pit (physically at least) by his bootstraps and ingeniously contrives both his own rescue and the plans that set him on the path that will allow him to fulfill his oath: “I find you, ‘Vorga’. I find you, I kill you, ‘Vorga’. I kill you filthy.” All the while his spirit stews in the morass from which his body could escape and he becomes a rapist, thug and purveyor of violence in pursuit of his goal. No price is too high to reach it, whether it be imprisonment or social isolation; no obstacle can stand in his way, whether it be the most powerful institutions in the world, or the human dignity of those he uses. Beware, Gully Foyle is on his way.\n\nBester’s prose is well-wrought and carries us briskly along with Foyle on his quest, from the gutter tongue of the 25th century into which he was born to the more refined prose of the high society parties which Foyle must infiltrate. Bester also does a fine job of describing his world and his ability to portray everything from the rigours of Gully’s six month survival in a broken hulk in deep space a gruelling moment at a time, to the weird and wonderful portrayal of Foyle’s trauma-induced synaesthesia later in the book is astonishing. I was dazzled. There are also more ideas packed into one slim volume than you can shake a stick at and all of them are foundational in the genre: cybernetic implants for physical and mental enhancement, personal teleportation (with many of the social ramifications of its existence worked out in the story), world-ending manufactured compounds that leave the future of humanity lying on a knife’s edge, a world controlled by pseudo-feudal multinational corporations, a forgotten society of future primitives living on a lonely asteroid, tattooing their faces with hideous designs, and worshipping a debased form of the scientific method…and the list goes on. Why were they able, at their best, to do this kind of thing in the old days in one slim volume, while today a writer would have taken half of these ideas, or even one, and written a two thousand page multi-volume epic out of it? Add to that the cast of characters that are almost all equally memorable and well-drawn: the megalomaniac Presteign of Presteign, a man of wealth and power cognisant of little save his own desires and dignity; his equally powerful daughter, the beautiful blind albino Olivia, an ice-princess who sees the world in the infra-red and electro-magnetic spectrums and carries her own dark secrets; the memorably named Jisbella McQueen (Jiz to her friends, thanks very much) a criminal miscreant both attracted to and repulsed by Foyle; and the man with the death’s head smile, Saul Dagenham, a scientist made ‘hot’ by an accident that has left him a radioactive outcast, able to interact with others in only a limited way.\n\nI must admit that, while I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the start, I was minded to give it a three star rating until I came to the climax and Bester managed to turn a scarred, brutal criminal into an altruistic saviour for a mankind as lost and directionless as he had been. One key had turned and made Gully Foyle into a remorseless machine for vengeance, another equally harsh set of trials then took this driven creature and made him into someone able to see the root of humanity’s need and try his best to give them the key to their own awakening.\n\nI challenge you, me. Die or live and be great. Blow\n\nyourselves to Christ gone or come and find me,\n\nGully Foyle, and I make you men. I make you great.\n\nI give you the stars.\n\nWhat a great read. Highly recommended.\n\n(Bester also gets extra points for having written the silver age Green Lantern oath, a ditty almost as cool as the one quoted above about Gully Foyle.)\n\nAlso posted at Shelf Inflicted\n\nNovember 1, 2022\n\nSF Masterworks 5: On the face of it, the story of Cully Hoyle, a man with limited education, skills, merits etc, and his relentless quest for justice... did I say justice? I should have said revenge. But this book is much more than a Count of Monte Cristo in the 24th century. First published in 1956, one of the seminal cyberpunk stories; first written usage of 'jaunt' to mean teleport; first use of synesthesia in written English language and more! Also Bester unlike almost every other creator really thinks through how a reality would evolve if mankind produced teleportation technology.\n\nIt's one of those tough calls where the story has aged and isn't that good, but the book's legacy is huge. Three Star, 6 out of 12 for the characterisations and plot; a strong Four Star 8 out of 12 for the world building and the book's legacy; so a strong Three Star 7 out of 12 read overall. BUT... I have to say it, a must read for SF completists and/or those researching the roots of the genre. For DC comic book fans, Bester created the Solomon Grundy character!\n\nArt credit: Enrique Corominas\n\n2020 read\n\nApril 6, 2023\n\nAn excellent analysis of the Trump candidacy and events leading up to his election as #45. Uses both his perspective and that of the anonymous supporter to chilling effect. Guest appearance by Ivanka near the end.\n\n***********************************\n\nForgive me my little joke; when I picked up the classic by Bester, I had no idea what I was in for, except a classic sci-fi--in space, with a rather appealing title.\n\nThe main character is Gully Foyle, a spacer with no real motivation in life. Content to be lazy, without purpose beyond existence, he's a bit of a drifter, until a spaceship he is traveling on is destroyed. Gully discovers a will to live and manages to keep himself barely alive, leaving the tiny reinforced space he exists in to scavenge supplies five minutes at a time in his barely functional spacesuit. At last, he sees a ship passing close by. He sends up a signal flare. The ship slows, almost stops, and then turns away. From here, the story takes off, as Gully discovers the heat of revenge as the one thing that can give him purpose.\n\nOne might think that discovering a passion could connect Gully, a previously amorphous blob of a human who was content to vegetate his way through life, to humanity, and possibly even the reader. But no, most certainly, absolutely no; Gully is a psychopath. In his quest for revenge, he meets a woman, Robin, who teaches the previously head-blind the skill of jaunting or limited teleportation. She has the unfortunate distinction of being a one-way telepath, so those around her can hear her thoughts when she isn't concentrating. Gully, it becomes clear, has a moment where he can understand what she is feeling/thinking, but doesn't actually empathize, instead choosing to ignore her humanity in his fit of rage and frustration.\n\nThroughout the rather short book, Gully goes through transformations, each a step on his goal, each transformation followed by a fall back into the depths. He is caught, he spends time in prison, he meets another woman and--dare we recognize it?--falls into his version of love. But as is everything with Gully, his love is the negative side of the emotion, and though it can offer salvation, it is obvious what his choice will be.\n\nIt is an inverse of the levels of hell; each reinvention has Gully reinventing himself to become more surfacely human, moving up the ladder of society into something that appears more socially acceptable but that remains rotten at the core. Depending on the reader's point of view, he may become more accessible, but really he is the same single-minded psychopath, single-minded in pursuit of his goal and unable to recognize or empathize with others. At one point he thinks he 'falls in love' but as with everything, he's fallen in love with an idea, an instant of emotion and not anything real.\n\nIt's a brilliant book. Bester does an unbelievable job at getting at Gully's emotion; I found myself taking a break at each transformation, needing to get a way from the miasma of hate for some untainted air. While Gully transforms, we're offered commentary on each section of 'society' he encounters, from the parody of scientists on an asteroid to the 'high' society of the richest men in the universe and their cloistered women. It's one of those amazing little stories that you understand as you read is offering up a scathing social indictment and yet wraps you up in its fast-paced plotting. I can't remember the last book I read with a main character so filled with hate and rage, that ignores every opportunity for redemptive actions.\n\nThe ending was a little slap-dash and has me wondering if dropping acid at least once during a book was a basic requirement of some of the sci-fi boundary pushers (thinking of Zelazny and Philip K. Dick here). Well, no matter, but I think it would have been more powerful had Bester relied on words instead of word-pictures. The circular nature of the ending is asthetically pleasing, although someone pushing the rules of the book. No matter, it was powerful nonetheless.\n\nWe can all only hope that Trump will experience something similar.\n\nOctober 10, 2011\n\n¡WOW BOB WOW!\n\nGULLY FOYLE IS FAST AND FURIOUS!\n\nA MADMAN OUT FOR VENGEANCE, LEFT FOR DEAD NOT ONCE - BUT TWICE!\n\nHE IS HUMAN JUGGERNAUT, HE IS FORCE MAJEURE, HE IS BOTH ROCK AND HARD PLACE!\n\nHE HURTLES THROUGH SPACE & TIME & MISADVENTURE, HE WEARS MANY FACES, A LOVER AND A RAPIST, THE MOST VIOLENT MAN IN THE ROOM, THE ANGRIEST BOY EVER, A HUMAN TIMEBOMB!\n\nHIS FACIAL TATTOOS:\n\nA TIGER, A TIGER!\n\nBURNING BRIGHT!\n\nTHE ONLY GIRL FOR HIM - ANOTHER SOCIOPATH!\n\nTHE ONLY DESTINATION FOR HIM: THE STARS! LITERALLY!\n\nTHIS HOLY NEANDERTHAL IS HUMANITY'S FUTURE HOPE!\n\na thrilling narrative. a challenging protagonist. a metaphysical and surprisingly hopeful ending. a great classic!\n\nJuly 16, 2018\n\nYou ever have a novel that you know is considered a classic of its genre yet you know absolutely nothing about it other than the title? This is one of those for me. I knew nothing about it other than the vague notion that it was an important sci-fi novel, but when it popped up as a deal on Audible I took a chance on it and went in cold.\n\nHow’d it work out? Pretty well.\n\nA couple of centuries from now humanity has developed the ability to teleport themselves using only their minds in a practice called jaunting. While it has revolutionized society in many ways it’s limited to just a few hundred miles at most so spacecraft are still needed to ferry people and goods around the solar system. Because people are always gonna be assholes there’s a war raging among the Inner Planets and Outer Satellites.\n\nGully Foyle is just a working class grunt with little education and even less ambition who had the bad luck to be on a ship that got blowed up real good as part of that war. For six months he survives by staying in a small storage lock and scavenging supplies in the wreckage using a damaged space suit. Deliverance seems at hand when he sees another ship named Vorga passing close by, but even though Gully sends out plenty of distress signals that couldn’t be missed the other ship simply passes him by. Enraged at being abandoned, Gully begins to show more gumption than he ever has as he first manages to save his own life and then embarks a campaign to find and kill the people who left him to die. When he finds himself caught in much larger schemes of powerful people his obsessive need for revenge puts him beyond any attempts to bribe or bully him.\n\nThere’s a lot of interesting stuff here that gets into some really big trippy sci-fi concepts that seem way ahead of their time in many ways plus there’s a kind of Count of Monte Cristo style story embedded in it too. It’s easy to see why this is so highly regarded and is considered a forerunner to cyberpunk.\n\nGully Foyle is also an interesting bastard of a character. He starts out as this crude and violent man fully capable of crimes like murder and rape, and his journey eventually turns him into something much more than that. Yet because it’s his unswerving desire for simple revenge driving him he’s always got that primitive core just below the surface.\n\nDespite being published over 60 years ago it doesn’t come across as that dated either. Alfred Bester did a lot of well thought out world building as to what this space faring society that has also mental powers like telepathy and the ability to teleport would be like. Some of the stuff he did here like a conflict between factions fighting for the resources of our solar system are still used today in sci-fi like The Expanse series, and the idea of powerful corporations being as much a force as government has been used countless times as well. The ending also seems like a leap forward to a kind of sci-fi that something like 2001 would do a decade later.\n\nIt’s a bold and ambitious story that seems ahead of its time in many ways, and I’m glad that I took the opportunity to fill in a gap in my sci-fi reading.\n\nJune 5, 2017\n\nRe-Read 6/5/17:\n\nReading this is like being on fire, snarling like a Tyger, and being the dumb brute and the intellectual mastermind at the same time. Reading it a second time is like chumming up with a psychopath and learning that he's really the good guy because everyone else is just as crazy as him.\n\nAnd then, what else can we expect when practically everyone can Jaunte (teleport) practically anywhere they want? Society is radically changed in the next five hundred years, and it's not just the tech. It's the human mind and all their baser instincts let loose.\n\nStill a fantastic tale. :)\n\nOriginal review:\n\nWow. I can see now why this is considered one of the greats of sci-fi. It ought to be required reading for anyone setting out to know the history of the field and what sparked the imagination of so many other writers. The very ending was somewhat weak, but the climax was great. The emotions were the strongest part of the whole tale. Gut wrenching and visceral doesn't begin to describe it. Great setup, straightforward adventure/revenge tale, and a great twist. Loved it, loved it, loved it.\n\nI just learned there *might* be a movie in development. Oh, my lord, I can't believe how excited I am about this.\n\nIt gets my heart pumping precisely eight times more than when I learned that Rama was in development.\n\nSQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\n(Ok. I'm not a little girl. But I FEEL like one, and isn't that what really counts?)\n\nDecember 30, 2017\n\n“Gully Foyle, that’s my name, me.”\n\nAlfred Bester has created in Gulliver Foyle one of Science Fiction’s great characters. The protagonist of Bester’s 1956 novel The Stars My Destination is a brutish, driven by internal energies force of nature and provides the most memorable element of this archetypal SF story.\n\nThat and jaunting.\n\nBester describes a future society where personal teleportation – jaunting – has transformed human society in virtually every way, from economic to sociological to legal. This anthropological paradigm shift of society is vaguely reminiscent of Poul Anderson’s 1954 novel Brainwave.\n\nImaginative and surreal, this falls into the Philip K. Dick sub-genre of weird SF.\n\nJune 8, 2017\n\nGrab no guesses you! Read it, is all.\n\nThis book has been quite the ride. Gully Foyle is your guide in a future where teleportation (\"jaunting\") is the main mode of transportation and where interplanetary tensions seem to mount up to an unavoidable Solar System War.\n\nGully Foyle is a guide you might not like very much, but boy, will he take you places. You'll feast your eyes on locations such as Nightmare Theatre, Freak Factory, sub-terranean prisons, a Sedative Garden and an asteroid consisting of salvaged wreckage, inhabited by savage scientists. On top of that you'll be taking short trips to the Moon, Mars and beyond. You'll meet colourful (and some extravagantly colourless) characters on the way, death-head Dagenham being one of my personal favorites. Better be quick though because Foyle isn't waiting up. He moves fast and in straight lines, through walls, through people, through morals, through conventions, through dimensional limits, through action-packed chapters that will make your head spin.\n\nWhy might you not like Gully Foyle, you ask? He's a cockroach. An angry one at that, with a simple mind set on revenge. Anything that stands in his way, anyone who tries to trample him, is in for a surprise. He survives against all odds. And you know what stuff that doesn't kill you really does? Right. Your guide will evolve, his instinct for survival will always be that split second quicker than whatever wants to end him.\n\nAnd as your guide grows stronger you might, despite a very shaky start, grow to like him. Don't be surprised if you would see an ugly, tattooed face next to the encyclopedia entry of \"character development\". It's Gully Foyle, the developing character extraordinaire. He might start off as a man too easy for trouble, too slow for fun, too empty for friendship, too lazy for love, a shell of a man throwing the angry question into the void: \"What's a matter, me? Help, you goddamn gods! Help, is all.\", but as this cockroach grows stronger, he also grows wiser. The cockroach will meet himself. A confrontation that, if handled succesfully, will take him to the stars.\n\nApril 20, 2013\n\nHoly shit, The Stars My Destination is a revelation. How'd this novel get past me for so long?\n\nI picture Alfred Bester as a mad scientist, surrounded by paper and typewriters, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, knocking this fucker out in the mid-50s. Bester writes likes he has to get all of his ideas out of his head RIGHT NOW, like they're going to explode if they stay in his brain too long. People who buy special diseases so they can go into the hospital and hang out with cute nurses? Neurological modification so, when a person tries to tell a particular truth, the brain short circuit and dies? He throws out concepts by the paragraph that less brave writers would save as other novels' cores. The storyline shifts and flows while the main character engages in despicable behavior in the search for the person who ordered a ship to leave him stranded on a fuel-less ship sipping through space. Through the text a thread of dread, hope, faith, and impulse pushes toward a stay-up-late-to-finish ending. I need to read this sucker again and savor the structure.\n\nWilliam Gibson apparently called The Stars My Destination \"perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy,\" and \"dizzying in its pace and sweep.\" I don't think higher praise could be afforded this book. And Bester wrote the book in the mid-fifties! I bow in your direction, sir. You kicked the shit out of this novel. On to your other works.\n\nJuly 26, 2015\n\nI first read this book decades ago under the title of Tiger! Tiger! (British edition). I just reread it recently for the purposes of writing this review. Fortunately I have memory like a sieve so I enjoy this reread just as much as the first time.\n\nThe Stars My Destination is one of the few sf books that is included in almost every all-time best sf books I have ever seen, and I have seen many. If I see such a list without this book I will probably dismiss it.\n\nThe story is centered upon Gully (Gulliver) Foyle a vengeful anti-hero protagonist who thinks nothing of whacking all and sundry with a sledgehammer. It is set in a universe where practically everybody can teleport, the part where teleportation (\"jaunting\") is discovered by accident and developed into a normal mode of transportation is brief yet brilliant, and the social and cultural ramifications are very well thought out. Foyle is not exactly likable but you have to feel sorry for the ordeals he goes through in this book. Abandoned, marooned, kidnapped, tortured, and imprisoned, no wonder he is so bitter and vengeful all the time; at no point does anybody offer him a nice cup of tea or a manicure. Foyle stoically goes through all this ill treatment with a snarl and a promise of payback. Bester's witty and intelligent prose contrast nicely with the gutter language spoken by Foyle in the first half of the book. The author has cited The Count of Monte Cristo as an influence for this book but the similarity is not noticeable until Foyle reinvented himself with an extreme makeover in the second half of the book, the breakneck pace of the book also slows down for the elaborate revenge plan at this point.\n\nAs this is one of the most beloved sf books ever recommendation is not usually necessary for regular sf readers, readers new to the genre will find this an ideal starting point.\n\nThe last couple of chapters are wonderfully trippy, surreal, philosophical and cosmic! I suspect these last chapters play a large part in pushing the book to its classic status.\n\nI love this book, me!\n\nJune 18, 2013\n\nOh I forgot to list this one! Wow - oversight city! (A city not found on any maps). God knows whether this is really a five star novel, but it was when I read it as a young teenybopper, and it bopped all over my teeny brain and imploded it into a zillion sparkly pieces which took many months to gradually meld back into a usable item again - I think that's why I did so poorly in my physics exam. It was called Tiger! Tiger! then, partly because Gully Foyle, the antiest of heroes, has a facial tiger tattoo like this\n\nWell, fiercer than that, so that big tough aliens are scared of him, you know. That was him when he was a lot younger. Or maybe his sister, it's hard to tell.\n\nTiger! Tiger! was written in 1956 so how Alfred Bester could predict both the psychedelic trippiness of the 60s and the extreme facial tattooing of the 90s is beyond me. If you read it closely there's also a reference to Tip-Ex, which wouldn't be invented until 1959, and mouse pads, which didn't come in until years later. What a guy.\n\nSo this is another in the series of I-loved-this-to-death-then-but-I-don't-know-what-the-hell-I'd-think-about-it-now useless reviews.\n\nAugust 18, 2016\n\nI have been trying to write a proper review since the past one week - and I have to give up. There are certain books which impressed me, which resist all my attempts to condense them into a few short paragraphs. However, if I don't write something now, this book will join my \"forever unreviewed books\" list, so I am putting up a somewhat inchoate review.\n\nThis book contains one of the most unpleasant protagonists I have ever encountered. Gully Foyle is totally without ambition, content only to survive. That survival is threatened, however, when he is trapped inside a spaceship damaged in the war between the Inner Planets (IP - Earth, Mars, Moon etc.) and the Outer Satellites (OS - the moons of Jupiter and Saturn): but Gully survives for 170 days, when he sees a ship approaching. His delight is turned to chagrin, and then an insane desire for revenge as the ship Vorga leaves without picking him up. What remains is the story of that revenge and how it changes Gully and the world.\n\nBester has created a rich and complex future in the twenty-fifth century: mankind has spread across the solar system, there is a full-fledged war due to commercial tensions between the settled worlds, people no longer travel but rather \"Jaunte\" - that is, transport themselves at the speed of thought... in a way, it is information overload, and the author does the unspeakable thing of explaining it in detail to the reader in the prologue! (Blasphemy! Show, don't tell!) But he gets away with it by ensnaring us in the intricate tapestry, and immediately diving into the middle of the story.\n\nGully Foyle is a number one blackguard. He is uncouth, sexist, totally amoral and illiterate into the bargain. He uses people ruthlessly - in the beginning, he blackmails and rapes a Jaunte instructor, whom he later kidnaps to help him in his nefarious schemes. Similarly, he jettisons into space another young woman who has helped him escape from an underground asylum, so that he can save his skin. Yet we keep on following him due to two reasons - the story is so powerful, and there is absolutely no attempt from the author's side to justify his character.\n\nTowards the end the novel takes a huge conceptual leap, as perspective shifts over time and space. to create the jagged effect, Bester has used the printed word in very innovative ways - the letters are boxed in, stretched out, strung together to create wave patterns and pictograms... it's the nearest you can come to jump cuts in literature. The narrative becomes almost visual here, and it is this part of the novel which pushed it up from three to four stars for me.\n\nA real classic from the golden age.\n\nJuly 10, 2008\n\nI have two thoughts on \"The Stars My Destination\" by Alfred Bester. One is that it really reads modern for a book written in 1956. The other is that it has some really antiquated ideas about the future.\n\nFirst for the positive. For the first 200 of the 250 or so pages of the story, I couldn't stand the protagonist, Gulliver Foyle. However, he grows as a human being to the point that I ended up spending the last 50 pages cheering him on. Bester did an excellent job of taking Foyle from being almost an animal to a self-educated man with no conscience to a man who cares deeply about mankind and its future. The story is tightly written and the pacing is practically perfect. I had a hard time putting it down even while I was really hating Gully. I can see that this book has had a huge impact on modern science fiction writers. It is nothing like the typical science fiction novels of the mid-Fifties.\n\nNow, for the negative. The things that really bothered me had mostly to do with the sensibilities of the Fifties expressed in the book. Women were protected and kept morally pure. They were more like possessions than anything else. You'd think that 500 years in the future, women would be a bit more equal to men. Also, while I really loved the character of Robin Wednesbury, I hated how Bester felt it necessary to say something about her being a Negro every time he talked about her. It's clear that he thought it would be really cool to have an intelligent, capable Negro \"girl\" character and he acts like it's really remarkable. I think she's a wonderful character and well-written other than the constant references to her race which I found distracting and dated. In contrast, he only mentions Olivia Presteign's albinism a couple of times, not every time she appears. Isn't albinism a much more remarkable trait than being an intelligent black woman?\n\nDespite the racism and sexism in the book, I did like it. The flaws reduced my rating by a star though. I've read enough books from the Fifties and earlier to know that they are not typical of the better writing of the time and I feel that Bester's biases just got the better of him.\n\nJanuary 6, 2023\n\nThis really is a pulse-quickening novel. Because of its idiocy, dreadful writing, horrible cast (if it even has one which I'm not persuaded of).\n\nThis is probably the 1st telepath/teleport book that I've vehemently hated. If I could burn it in my garbage bin right now I so would.\n\nI've no idea whatsoever what this pulp of pulp could ever have to do with The Count Monte Cristo.\n\nQ:\n\nHe started to gather his possessions-a faceless clock which he kept wound just to listen to the ticking, a lug wrench with a hand-shaped handle which he would hold in lonely moments, an egg slicer upon whose wires he would pluck primitive tunes... (c)\n\nQ:\n\n«It does seem unfair. One-way telepathy is a nuisance. I do apologize for shrapneling you with my thoughts.»\n\n«We like it, m'am. You think pretty.» (c)\n\nAugust 29, 2013\n\nThis was a golden age, a time of high adventure, rich living and hard dying ... but nobody thought so. This was a future of fortune and theft, pillage and rapine, culture and vice ... but nobody admitted it. This was an age of extremes, a fascinating century of freaks ... but nobody loved it.\n\nAlfred Bester began his career with stories published in Thrilling Wonder Stories , Startling Stories , Astounding Science Fiction - names that have come to define that brief period known as the Golden Age of SF, when the possibilities offered by science seemed limited only by the human imagination, and the opening of the road to the stars only a couple of decades away. Less concerned with practicalities like deadly solar radiation, terminal cold or the barrier of the speed of light, writers played the game of 'what if ...' and then went on to speculate on the chages future technologies and discoveries would play on the individual psyche and on society as a whole.\n\nWhat if humans could teleport anywhere they want just by taping the unused resources of their brains? What would be the limitations of this new discovered ability? How would it change economic and political relations around the world? Alfred Bester explores the notion in the context of a dystopian future, where humanity has colonized the Solar System but the Inner Planets are in open conflict with the colonists beyond the asteroid belt (sound familiar? it is one of the central issues of the Expanse universe in James S A Corey new space opera). It is the 25th century and society is controlled by dynastic mega corporations with the division between 'have' and 'have not' as sharp as ever and morality has regressed to the point where women are once again locked in castle towers and forbidden to go out without a chaperone.\n\nAll this is just the background setting and it is pretty much laid down in the introduction of the novel in a concise and clear exposition that skirts long scientific explanations of 'how' or 'why' and simply postulates concepts and technologies. Technologies and concepts that have just landed Gulliver Foyle in a deadly trap:\n\nHe was Gulliver Foyle, Mechanic's Mate 3rd Class, thirty years old, big boned and rough.. . and one hundred and seventy days adrift in space. He was Gully Foyle, the oiler, wiper, bunkerman; too easy for trouble, too slow for fun, too empty for friendship, too lazy for love.\n\nFoyle, a slacker totally devoid of ambitions or life goals, discovers that he cares about something after all. When his Earth bound cargo ship (Nomad) gets hit by raiders and all the crew is killed, Foyle realizes he really wants to live and is not ready to give up, not even when a passing spaceship (Vorga) refuses to acknowledge his distress signals and departs without rescuing him. From 'drifter' Foyle becomes 'driven', obsessed with extracting revenge on the Vorga. After jury rigging his gutted ship, Foyle drifts back to civilization. Along the way, Foyle is captured by a sect of space scavengers based on a lost asteroid, where he receives a tattoo illustrating his transformation from prey to predator, from somebody at the receiving end of hard knocks to a mover and shaker of the world, from follower to leader of the pack. The incident also explains the alternate title of the book:\n\nTyger! Tyger! burning bright\n\nIn the forests of the night,\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye\n\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\nThe development of the novel from here owes a lot to The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, as uncouth and violent Gully Foyle evolves into the rich and slick entertainer Fourmyle of Ceres, a new man with a new face but still driven by his desire to exact revenge on the crew of the Vorga. There are complications though, as it appears that Foyle's original ship carried a secret cargo of PyrE (a mysterious and unique material that we might as well label 'unobtainium'), a cargo that could change the dynamic of the war between Inner and Outer Planets in the solar system. So Foyle is hunted in turn by the Earth's Intelligence Agency, by the clan leader of one of the mega corporations, by a radioactive bounty hunter and probably one or two more parties interested in laying their hands of the McGuffin material. it's a bomb, thousands of time more powerful than an atomic bomb.\n\nI liked the novel, but honestly I couldn't see why so many writers and readers hail it as the greatest single SF story ever written. It is a tale well told, with well defined characters, lively pacing, gripping plot. The SF elements are numerous and daring and probably only the fact that they have been used by every writer that came after Bester explains why they had less of an impact on me. At the time the book was written they were cutting edge instead of standard SF concepts. As one commenter remarks : Bester's description of synesthesia is the first popular account in the English language. It is also quite accurate. . Neil Gaiman points out that what we have come to refer to as cyberpunk has its roots here in the pages of Bester : electronic body enhancements (admitedly powered by a nuclear battery inserted into the spine. yuck!) ; a dystopian future controlled by consummerism and corporatism, psionic powers, conspiracy theories that are actually true and last but not least great female sidekicks for the anti-hero.\n\nIt is only towards the end of the novel that greatness is achieved and surpassed and the focus of the novel is revealed as not the fate of Gully Foyle or the revelation of who ordered the Vorga to abandon him, but the destiny of humanity itself, it's moment of choice between self-destruction and 'childhood's end' in the sense that Arthur C Clarke interpreted it : leave the nest of the planet and of the Sun behind and take our rightful place among the stars. The choice between a cynical 'real-politik' world view where 'the weak are meat the strong doth eat' (I believe that's how David Mitchell put it) and faith that transcends organized religion to affirm that people are able to distinguish between right and wrong and choose the best way into the future. Hoping I will not spoil anything, here are a few quotes about the coming of wisdom for Foyle, in a conversation with a household robot:\n\n'That's me,' he said, motioning to the robot. 'That's all of us. We prattle about free will, but we're nothing but response ... mechanical reaction in prescribed grooves. So ... here I am, here I am, waiting to respond. Press the buttons and I'll jump.'\n\n---\n\n- 'Why reach out to the stars and galaxies? What for?'\n\n- 'Because you're alive, sir. You might as well ask: Why is life? Don't ask about it. Live it'\n\n---\n\n'There's got to be more to life than just living,' Foyle said to the robot.\n\n'Then find it for yourself, sir. Don't ask the world to stop moving because you have doubts'\n\n'Why can't we all move forward together?'\n\n'Because you're all different. You're not lemmings. Some must lead, and hope that the rest will follow.'\n\n'Who leads?'\n\n'The men who must ... driven men, compelled men.'\n\n'Freak men.'\n\n'You're all freaks, sir. But you always have been freaks. Life is a freak. That's its hope and glory.'\n\n'Thank you very much.'\n\n'My pleasure, sir.'\n\n'You've saved the day.'\n\n'Always a lovely day somewhere, sir,' the robot beamed.\n\nfinal verdict: it took me until the last page to reach a decision, but \"The Stars My Destination\" is worth all the praise and is rightfully called a classic of the genre. Goodbye for now, hope you'll have a lovely day!\n\nJune 8, 2017\n\nSonunda bir tokat atan kitaplara karşı hislerimi kesinleştirmem çok zor oluyor. Ortalarında bırakmayı bile düşündüğüm bu kitabı sabah bitirdiğimden beri defalarca hakkında düşünürken buldum kendimi. Kitaba olan hislerim kitabın kendisi gibi karmaşık. Okurken ölesiye sinir olduğunuz bir kitaba karşı, bitirince en sevdiğiniz kitaplar arasına dahi sokabileceğinizi hissetiğiniz oldu mu daha önce? Resmen boyun eğdiriyor.\n\nİtiraf etmem gerekirse 'Kaplan! Kaplan!' biraz baştan savdığım bir kitap oldu. Ama bunun en büyük sebebi yazar. Mükemmel başlayan bir hikayeye eklenmiş kuru aksiyon sahneleri bana kalırsa özü öldürmüş. Okuması kolay bir kitap olduğunu düşünmüyorum, en azından benim için öyleydi. Ancak bu okuma zorluğunun ana sebebi dil değil, karakterler. Okuyabileceğiniz en enteresan karakterleri yaratmış Bester. Anlamlandırmak güç. Ve beni bilenler bilir böyle Gully gibi uçuk karakterlere bayılırım. Alışılmadık. Gerçi Gully için uçuk biraz hafif kalır, saykoyu tercih edeceğim.\n\nTekrar okunabilecek kitaplar listesine yazdım kitabı. Tam yıldız veremiyorum kitaba. Dilinden hoşlanmadığım için en başta. Her şey aniden oluyormuş gibi hissettiren bir dili var Bester'ın. Yorumlarda da bundan yakınmıştım...\n\n'Dinleyin lan beni! Dinle insan! Vaaz vereceğim iyi dinleyin bakiyim!\n\nLan domuzlar lan. Domuz gibi çürüyorsunuz alayınız. İçinizde çoğu var ama azını kullanıyorsunuz. İçinizde milyon var ama kuruş harcıyorsunuz. İçinizde deha var ve deli deli şeyler düşünüyorsunuz. Kalbiniz var ama boş hislerle dolusunuz. Hepiniz. Alayınız...\n\nSize harcatmak için savaş olması gerek. Düşünmeniz için sıkışmanız lazım. Büyük olmanız için meydan okumayla yüzleşmeniz lazım. Yoksa tüm gün kıçınızın üstünde oturun. Lan domuzlar lan! Pekala, Tanrı da sizi kahretsin! Size meydan okuyorum lan ben. Ölün ya da yaşayın ve büyük olun. Ya kendinizi patlatıp merhum İsa'nın ardından gidin ya da beni bulun, Gully Foyle'u bulun ve ben sizi insan yapayım. Sizi büyük yapayım. Size yıldızları vereyim.'\n\nSon olarak alıntıyı yazarken aklıma geldi; kitabı okurken elimin altında 6.45 baskısı da vardı çevirileri karşılaştırdım. Daha ilk sayfadan inanılmaz farklılıklar, korkunç hatalar var... Hiç 6.45 okumadım ama elimde kitapları var, nasıl cesaret edeceğim bilmiyorum. Buradan vesileyle İthaki'ye, Barış Tanyeri'ne teşekkür edeyim de bir yere bağlayayım bari. Elinize sağlık.\n\nJune 3, 2012\n\nGully Foyle is my name\n\nAnd Terra is my nation.\n\nDeep space is my dwelling place,\n\nThe stars my destination.\n\nA man is a member of society first, and an individual second. You must go along with society, whether it chooses destruction or not.\n\nHere's the break down:\n\nCharacterization - What a book of incredibly unlikable people. All the female characters are happy to be victims and while they are pretty badass in some regards are totally obsessed with love. Ummm...shut up. All the male characters are power hungry assholes. Not a hero or friend in the lot. The main character, of course, is supposed to be horrible...rapist, sociopath, psychopath, you name it. Its kind of worse once you find out he is locked in a prison of his own making. I think Bester meant to make that some kind of redemption for the character but it kind of made it worse . But as I don't think the author intended for me to like any of the characters (at least not until the end) I can't really fault him on that front but I will say that it's odd to cast a bunch of douche bags.\n\nStory - The central plot is fairly entertaining. It takes a little to long to wrap up and there are far to many tangents that are not fully realized. The book should have been shorter and some of these tangents edited out or it should have been longer with the tangents fleshed out. Either way not quite there.\n\nConcept/story line - Kind of brilliant. There was a really good idea in here. Sometimes it was hard to see. This concept is something I think Asimov would have been better equipped to convey. The story is pretty heady and eventually ends up in a really fascinating place. A really good tale about good and evil and what makes a person good or evil.\n\nWorld Building - Excellent. I liked the description of the different races/planets. I liked how society was described (i.e. the different 'houses' dressing according to the year their ancestors changed history). I loved everything that happened in Gouffre Martel. I would have liked the outlawing of religions to be discussed a little more. There were hints in conversations about things that I would have preferred to have read about over Gully's story like WWIII. And, of course, jaunting was a great idea. Brilliant actually. What happens at the end with Gully and the jaunting through space/time was amazing. I didn't see that coming at all it and opened the book up quite a bit.\n\nTropes/Cliches - Way to much love at first sight bull shit. I hate that crap. I want to understand why people are into each other. If its just physical fine... I can understand that but these characters are all so flimsy. As soon as the relationships form you can actually see the respect for the woman disappear. When a female character would offer advice it was listened to but once a female character became someones 'property' they would get ignored. There is one section where a female character is talking to Gully and she makes a point of telling him she is now Mrs. whatever. It had no bearing on the story, the scene or the character development. But this was written in the 50's so I guess thats to be expected.\n\nBester has a knack for action writing and physical description. That is probably the best part of this book. Its not terribly long. Just 258 pages. The story is interesting enough to stick with. At about 200 pages in I could have easily quit reading it and been fine with it. It was the last 50 pages that made the difference. It was in the last 50 pages that had the best dialogue, the best story line, the best character development and the best writing. Bester designed this book to come together at the end but unfortunately failed to make the reader realize that would happen, so throughout the entire book I'm searching for connections and coming up empty and blaming myself for missing the point. I don't like that. A lot of stories are like that but not all of those stories make you feel like its totally over your head. I had this pegged for a 3 star but I'm pushing it down to 2 stars.\n\nI'm still not sure what the plan was with the cast of idiots and assholes though.\n\nSeptember 25, 2017\n\nI love the thrill of discovering an older work of SF that still rocks.\n\nThe Stars My Destination is one such book, a thrill ride from beginning to end that despite being published in 1955 still hits hard and holds its own in 2017.\n\nSeveral times while reading The Stars My Destination a very clear thought occurred to me- this shouldn't be working. The narrative is flush with odd plot developments, amusing 1950s sci-fi anachronisms (Newspapers being printed in the far future when they're struggling for readers in 2017) non-sequitur story twists (to my mind) and a foundation premise - scientists discover everyone innately has the power to teleport themselves - that is pretty thin. Yet despite all this I really dug Bester's novel, and I raced through it.\n\nFrom the first few pages, where Bester's main character Gully Foyle is trapped for months in a psyche-warpingly small closet (the only sealed compartment left in his crippled ship) and eventually plans his rather gripping escape I was hooked. Foyle goes from zero-to-homicidally-driven-anti-hero over the course of a chapter and what happens to him in the wreckage of his vessel sets him off on a novel-length quest for revenge against the people who abandoned him.\n\nThe book runs at a sweat-inducing pace, dashing from development to development and only rarely stopping to catch its breath. Things happen. They happen fast and they happen big, and as the story progresses Foyle's transformation from listless bottom-of-the-heap loser to implacable, resourceful hunter and beyond is very satisfying.\n\nSome golden age SF can't transcend the period in which it was written, and is mired in concepts that are now outdated, or modes of storytelling that present day readers can find dull (see some of Asimov's short stories for prime examples of this type.)\n\nThe Stars My Destination in contrast, is still fresh. Its flaws are minor and its storytelling is both straightforward and engaging.\n\nIn short, it's well worth your time. I rate the pulse-quickening opening sequence in the crippled ship as being right up there with the best parts of The Martian and I rank this novel as one of the classics of its era.\n\nDecember 24, 2023\n\nI enjoy a good sci-fi romp through space every once in awhile, and The Stars, My Destination fits the mold perfectly.\n\nGulliver (“Gully”) Foyle is an uneducated mechanic set adrift aboard a damaged ship named the Nomad. With his air supply dwindling, a terra ship named the Vorga passes by and, to his amazement, leaves him. Foyle is incredibly angry and vows to track down the Earth-based ship and enact revenge.\n\nFoyle repairs the ship and blasts to a nearby asteroid, where he is captured by a cult, is instantly married to a crew member, and has his entire face tattooed with their signature, a tiger-like design. Fun times!\n\nDid I mention teleportation? The ability was discovered, and it retroactively changed the way Earth deals with logistics, privacy, and the mix of different cultures.\n\nIt has quite a few novel ideas for the mid-1950s. It touches on governmental control, space fairing, cybernetic implants, telepathy, and time travel, to name a few. Those who like a bit of Terminator with their pseudoscience, death-wish-like plotting will be at home here.\n\n// Setting the scene \\\\\n\nFoyle meets a 100-year-old woman whom he falls for in prison. One thing leads to the next, and after they escape, she knows an ex-con/swindler “Freakshow” procurer (yes, it gets kind of convoluted), and he is able to remove the hideous tattooing. It works for awhile, but, surprise! Once Foyle displays complex emotion, the scars return. But do not worry; he undergoes a procedure and becomes half man and half machine. And how does one control their anger after such a transformative body upgrade? Yoga! That’s right, my friends, Namaste!\n\nIt's a wild plot that has quite a few twists and turns. The ending is fairly philosophical, too. Overall, I enjoyed it, but your mileage may vary. If you're looking for a nostalgic sci-fi story that has a mish-mash of plot lines that definitely inspired future writers, this is it.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy holidays, my friends!!!!\n\n🎵| Soundtrack |🎵\n\n❖ KMFDM - Megalomaniac\n\n❖ Pitchshifter - Genius\n\n⭐ | Rating | ⭐\n\n❖ 3.5 out of 5 ❖\n\nFebruary 4, 2012\n\nA teacher told me that we must always think in the time frame: in the context with which a writer wrote his works; okay, I can do that. Bester wrote this in the 50's, 56' I believe, so if the problems in this novel had been based in the technology then that would have been one thing; if the problems had been based in American social standards or concepts of the time that would be one thing; that isn't the thing. The thing is that this is simply a poorly written book.\n\nI will at least agree that Bester had a reason for his book going on rambling tangents and forgetting details that he mentioned earlier; it was serialized. I can understand it being hard to keep all the details together when one is writing a work bi-monthly or however it was written, but I can only extend that forgiveness so far. Deciding you want to write Count of Monte Cristo is fine. Deciding you want to write a novel about ideologies and societal perspectives is fine. Deciding you want to write a work with religious connotations and symbolism is also fine (although god knows it annoys me). What is not fine is mixing them all together - nay, jumbling them together. Whereas most of this book is grounded in simple action with vague undertones of emotional messages (think Iliad), 60 pages from the end, Bester decides the book needs religion - and philosophy, can't forget that.\n\nI wish I could say those were the only problems and the rest of the story was cheese-and-crackers, but it isn't. Bester comes up with an interesting concept of human teleportation but then fails miserably when he tries to turn it into an earth-shattering-societal-reforming change. The changes that this teleportation brings are at best far-fetched and at their worst nonsensical. People must know the coordinates of places they teleport from and to, okay. So to protect their homes people build labyrinths outside of their teleportation sites. Okay. Putting aside the fact that someone could quite easily determine this once they were in a location (many a device could even do it for you), even Bester seems to forget. He decides on an apparent whim that society had regressed, that because people can teleport anywhere women must be locked into rooms without doors lest they be raped. But wait, Bester, you say, if people could just teleport in and rape then that means they could just teleport in at any time, so why the labyrinth? Well I don't know either, and I don't think Bester does either.\n\nTechnicalities aside, the book is full of not only plot-holes and non sequiturs but flat characters with exaggerated personalities and weak attempts at drama and conflict to spice things up. Example: This man is so rich he doesn't teleport, he flaunts his riches by not having teleported in 40 years. Okay. Two pages later he teleports to some launching ceremony. Really? 40 YEARS of dedication and being late to a ceremony is all it takes? Okay Bester. Okay.\n\nOne of the things that bothered me most - except for the terrible characters, plot holes, and child-like drama - is that everyone says, 'Read it in its context!' as if nothing good had ever been written before it. I keep forgetting that 1956 was the dark ages of America and we had none of the works of Shakespeare or Fitzgerald, Melville, Hemingway or anyone else who had ever written real characters without ridiculous plot hooks. My bad. One of the silliest things is that 3 years later Kurt Vonnegut would write \"Sirens of Titan\", which is profound, smart, emotional, and bogged down with real, hurting people. The fact that it makes me want to leap off a bridge does in no way take away from how well written it is. But keep the context in mind folks. Shit got crazy in those 3 years between the novels. We learned how to make coherent stories with admirable themes and symbolism. And then we found out some other guys had been doing it for hundreds of years. Who'd have thought?\n\nMarch 12, 2018\n\nYa son dos los libros que he leído de Bester y si tuviera que resaltar algo de él es que no te deja indiferente. Puedes no estar de acuerdo con todo lo que se le ocurre, su visión de las mujeres y las relaciones amorosas/sexuales es algo problemática a veces, pero tiene imaginación y no le tiene miedo a forzar los límites, no solo en cuanto a historia, sino también en cómo reflejarla en el palabras. Le gusta romper el texto, jugar con las tipografías, reforzar gráficamente lo que está describiendo con palabras.\n\nEste libro es de 1956, solo un par de años después de que Asimov publicara \"Fundación\" y \"Fundación e Imperio\", y si los comparas, parece como si Bester estuviera adelantado una década, como mínimo. En cierta manera, Bester parece un visionario: las corporaciones son la nueva aristocracia y dominan el mundo en un remedo de nuevo sistema estamental. Y además lleva sus ideas hasta las últimas consecuencias, como qué ocurriría si la gente pudiera teletransportarse (\"jauntear\" se dice en la novela) a voluntad. Qué pasaría con esa sociedad, con su economía. Cómo la gente se protegería construyendo laberintos para llegar a sus casas, cómo los ricos y poderosos utilizarían medios de comunicación y transporte obsoletos solo para demostrar lo ricos que son. Y todas esas ideas son fascinantes. Lo es menos que como Bester es un hombre de su tiempo, la conclusión lógica del jaunteo para las mujeres es que las encierran en sus habitaciones, para \"proteger su honra\". Aún así, hay tres personajes femeninos en esta novela y las tres son diferentes y, a su manera, interesantes. Aunque lo de la violación sobraba bastante.\n\nLos personajes de Bester están llenos de fuerza, pero son desagradables, la mayor parte. El protagonista es directamente odioso (y desesperante) la mayor parte de la historia. De todas formas, Bester no trata de convencerte de que es una buena persona. No lo es y Bester lo deja siempre claro. Es el protagonista, vemos la historia a través de sus ojos, pero no es un héroe.\n\nEs en cierta forma una novela controvertida, a partes visionaria, y muy entretenida, no solo por lo que te está contando, sino cómo lo está haciendo. A Bester se le va la cabeza a veces, pero es siempre interesante.\n\nMay 19, 2014\n\nGully Foyle is not a likeable man. But he is a compelling one. And in The Stars My Destination Alfred Bester wrote one of his best. (I do like The Demolished Man a little bit more.)\n\nNote: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement. You can read why I came to this decision here.\n\nIn the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook\n\nJuly 6, 2021\n\nSo, this book is on several lists of classics. It's the rough prototype for the Cyberpunk genre, and it's....really, really odd.\n\nIt has a surreal, skeletal feel that reminds me of Harlan Ellison, or Philip K. Dick. No subtlety, no subtext, just raw ideas (and characters) blasting off the page and squirming into your brain.\n\nIts great if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIf you need more meat and polish, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nApril 19, 2015\n\nThe Stars My Destination: Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright, Intent on Revenge\n\n(Posted at Fantasy Literature)\n\nMuch has been written about Alfred Bester’s classic 1956 SF novel The Stars My Destination (Tiger! Tiger! in the UK edition). According to Wikipedia, it is considered one of the best SF books of all time by many authors such as Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Samuel. R. Delany, Robert Silverberg, and William Gibson. Predating cyberpunk by almost three decades (if you count from Neuromancer in 1984), it features a fully-realized world of ruthless multinational corporations, cybernetic enhancements, and most importantly, the concept of “jaunting”, the ability to teleport instantly between two places if the jaunter knows the exact locations and has seen them before physically. This ability is available to almost everyone in society. As you might expect, this created dramatic upheaval in global society and has completely transformed economies, transportation, and social behavior. For instance, due to the ability of people to jaunt into any known location, wealthy families create impenetrable labyrinths to protect themselves and women are confined to such places in many cases, giving rise to a Neo-Victorian society.\n\nThe story begins in very cinematic fashion with a lone crewman named Gully Foyle, who wakes up to find himself the sole survivor of an attack on a merchant spaceship called Nomad. He initially finds ways to survive but is not pushed into action until a passing ship, the Vorga, ignores the distress signals he has been sending out. This fuels an intense rage in him that will consume and transform him utterly into a single-minded beast driven by the desire for revenge on whomever controlled the Vorga. As it turns out, the Vorga is owned by the same ultra-wealthy and decadent Presteign clan that owns the Nomad, and the further Gully pursues each link in the mystery behind the Vorga’s actions, the more convoluted the plot becomes, and he encounters a plethora of very unusual and intriguing characters. Along the way, he himself changes in dramatic ways and we also get a very detailed tour of this future world where teleportation dominates. There are even some telepaths (echoes of Bester’s previous novel The Demolished Man, which won the inaugural Hugo Award) in the story, a mysterious super-powerful substance called PyrE, a “jaunt-proof” high security prison, a primitive space-bound cargo cult, various assassins and secret societies, and a struggle between the Inner Planets and Outer Colonies, which is a theme that has been explored in the genre many times since, including most recently James S.A. Corey’s THE EXPANSE series.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question for modern readers is, does this classic still hold up today, almost 60 years after initial publication? The answer is ABSOLUTELY! This book is fierce, cynical, lighting-paced, complex, philosophical, darkly humorous, and frankly doesn’t feel dated at all. It’s more exciting as cyberpunk than William Gibson, not as self-congratulatory as Iain M. Banks’ Culture novels, and takes a far more skeptical of the future than Robert Heinlein’s SF novels. Stylistically, it runs circles around the pedestrian prose of contemporaries like Arthur C. Clarke (who I like) or Isaac Asimov (who I don’t). Considering how much impact Bester has had on the genre with only two major books, The Demolished Man and The Stars My Destination, I think every serious SF fan owes it to themself to give this book a try.\n\nAugust 24, 2016\n\n4 stars is a bit of stretch for a space opera with plot holes I could pilot a ship through, but I allowed for when it was written, the ideas contained, & the narration. As a straight SF novel today, it's barely OK - the characters are unlikable, the science magical, & the romance is ridiculous - yet it manages to leverage these weaknesses into a story that is really intriguing & even inspiring, if you can put your sense of disbelief on hold.\n\nGully Foyle, the MC, certainly isn't a hero. He's a beast that slowly becomes not just human, but the epitome of humanity in many ways. His crude, bestial drive leads him to break long established boundaries & eventually inspire all of humanity in a devil's deal delivered in the low class argot of the time.\n\n\"Take a war to make you spend. Take a jam to make you think. Take a challenge to make you great. Rest of the time you sit around lazy, you. Pigs, you! All right, God damn you! I challenge you, me. Die or live and be great. Bow yourselves to Christ gone or come and find me, Gully Foyle, and I make you men. I make you great. I give you the stars.\"\n\nFantastic.\n\nThe neat ideas:\n\n- Synesthesia was known back then, but I've read this was one of the earliest popular novels that used it.\n\n- One of the early, best examples of modern cybernetics. Not just as a prosthetic, but as augmentation.\n\n- Time/space/dimensions as parts of a whole.\n\n- Religion outlawed & become a 'filthy practice', yet people still use its words for profanity. Not explored enough, though.\n\n- The drug 'analogue', not explored enough, but really intriguing.\n\n- What psi powers would do to people & society. The main power is that most can teleport, but telepathy was also used to great advantage.\n\nThere were more. Many weren't explored well enough, but created the impression of a real world, drawn with broad, exacting strokes that teased.\n\nMany of the things I disliked about the novel were also strengths. For instance, Olivia, the pampered daughter of one of the richest, most amoral men on Earth, is 'blind', yet she's not. She simply sees in a different spectrum than the rest & her character makes absolutely no sense. In one scene she sees things no one else can & revels in her power, yet in another she uses this as a reason for hating humanity. The dated treatment of the female characters doesn't help, but her sight was really unique, interesting, & disappointing.\n\nThe elite families of the Earth were ludicrous & dated, but fun both for the way they were caricatured & for the names themselves. While most were recognizable today, I doubt many today would recognize Esso, once a household name, but immersed since the 70s in the Exxon brand. Anyway, it was kind of a blast from the past.\n\nI think I read this way back when, but had forgotten most of it. I recently stumbled across a list in my documents \"The Top 100 Audio Science Fiction Books\". There are actually only 99 on the list & one of those is a duplicate, so it's not to be taken too seriously. Still, it was enough to spur me to listening to this & I'm glad I did. It's not a long book & one of the foundations of SF. It's worth reading, but don't go into it expecting modern SF. It has warts, but should be treasured for them.\n\nAugust 5, 2008\n\nFast and furious and blackly comedic similiar to early Vonnegut or Jack Vance mixed with the bitter surrealism of Finney's \"Circus of Doctor Lao\", this book predicted and influenced trends like the British New Wave,cyberpunk, and new space opera, but retains an oddball flavor of its own. Satirizing 50's anxieties like the red scare and the threat of nuclear annihilation(and unhindered corporate greed and warmongering)and featuring a psychopathic protagonist(loose in world that makes him look like a boyscout) this book has barely dated a day since its writing, especially since everything it satirizes has not left us. Add a truly satisfying conclusion and explanation of the economic impact of teleportation makes this book truly classic."
