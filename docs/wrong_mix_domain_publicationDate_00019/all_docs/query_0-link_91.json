        "text": "The Guardian yesterday (22/1/09) published a list of SF/fantasy works as part of its 1000 books you must read series.\n\nIan Sales has commented on it on his blog from which I got the list.\n\nOut of the 149 I have read 57 (marked in bold.) There are another five of which I’ve read either part of them or the short story on which they were based (marked in bold and italics.) One is on my to-be-read shelf (italics only.) In addition I’ve seen the TV series of Hitchhiker but not read the books. Ditto for the Disney film of The Sword In The Stone which I suspect had little to do with the TH White book, though Wikipedia says it is based on it. I also watched the TV version of Angus Wilson’s The Old Men at the Zoo.\n\nThere are 8 authors on the list of whom I have read other books of theirs (some of them not classifiable as SF or fantasy.)

If any one person is responsible for me continuing to read Science Fiction into adulthood it is him. The Man In The Maze showed me what SF could be, what it could aspire to. Yet it is a relatively minor work. So how can there be no Nightwings, no Son Of Man, no A Time Of Changes?\n\nAnd no Roger Zelazny? Dear, dear.\n\nNot to mention Alasdair Gray’s towering achievement Lanark. (But the list wasn’t compiled by Scots.)\n\nAn amusing aspect of this particular list is that before the turn of the millenium The Guardian compiled various bests of the 20th century. The SF book that topped the relevant list (it was an idiosyncratic choice it has to be said) does not appear in this one! Neither does its author.\n\nEdited to add Brave New World to my read list. I somehow missed it on the run through.\n\nEdited again. Up to 59 now. I’ve also read Lord Of The Flies, but it was donkey’s ages ago (so long I’d just about forgotten.)"
