        "text": "January 23, 2022\n\nPART ONE\n\n* * *\n\nGetting Older\n\nAdvancing into sleepless woods,\n\nEach year the ice getting thinner,\n\nAnd the trapped waters darker;\n\nThe mind's frosty ballet superbly staged\n\nOn a floor of nerves;\n\nBreath shorter, skin veined and rough;\n\nUnderstanding a woman's precarious beauty\n\nFor the first time,\n\nI stand in a frozen year,\n\nAnd hear the whisper of darkened lives.\n\nDo the words come from inside or out?\n\nThat sort of knowledge eludes me now.\n\nSometimes, when I go for a walk,\n\nI see an old man's face smiling without humour.\n\nHis fleshy lips resemble an ear\n\nMoving cautiously without any sound.\n\nHe waits for me at the end of a milky street\n\nWhich turns unpredictably into swamp or rust.\n\nIt is the old man I may never reach,\n\nDistracted by everything that must be lived,\n\nMy hands twitching like butterflies in the brief sunlight.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Hospital\n\nI\n\nWhen you see me driving\n\nThrough traffic,\n\nSpeeding, putting on the brakes,\n\nYou think:\n\n\"He knows what he is doing,\n\nWhere he goes Everything is settled.\"\n\nBut the nights on Rikers Island\n\nAre filled with dwarfish faces.\n\nThey sit up with me on sleepless nights,\n\nBargaining with insomnia.\n\nThey tell me that I am broken,\n\nMended by silence.\n\nII\n\nYou hand over me in the white gloom\n\nLike a pear\n\nThat will not ripen.\n\nYou are my hospital, I ask you for a pencil.\n\nI say: \"I want to write you a letter.\"\n\nYour eyes are shells scrubbed by waves,\n\nWhite sea-prints through which I see\n\nThe wards of predictable terror.\n\nSometimes the doctor comes in\n\nAnd takes my pulse.\n\nIII\n\nI believe the hospital walls,\n\nMy illness\n\nWhich only a stone could diagnose.\n\nAnd I know, quivering doctor,\n\nI know the eyes awake in the stuttering heart;\n\nThe bunched muscles of horses climbing the air,\n\nWild horses, not ridden or seen\n\nBut dying man sees them.\n\nHe cries out for rescue.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Dark Side of the Earth, December 1972\n\nWe don't talk about the war anymore,\n\nLiving on the dark side of the earth,\n\nThe winter side,\n\nYet we do not keep silent either.\n\nWe repeat ourselves until the words\n\nBecome thin as insect husks,\n\nForgetting the stripped faces, the soup of limbs\n\nLeft when bombs have fallen.\n\nIt is dark here, a peculiar winter.\n\nThe ice storm caught us unawares\n\nAnd we froze into body postures and went on living,\n\nBut the inmost room in our bodies was a grave.\n\nHow else could bombers inch across the sunlight,\n\nAnd the earth get drunk with shudders,\n\nAnd the dead be indistinguishable from mud,\n\nIf our most comfortable wealth did not belong to death.\n\nWhen words make nothing happen they turn against the sayer.\n\nWe are eaten by our words, and so are silent,\n\nAnd don't talk about the war anymore.\n\n* * *\n\nUptown\n\nA streak of car paint;\n\nA shopping cart dragged past the window\n\nBy a closed black face.\n\nThe worst is when the sidewalk becomes a mirror,\n\nAnd the woman becomes a mirror,\n\nWith her abstract face, her teeth like thrush eggs.\n\nThin child-body in November, why do you\n\nPass by me? Lovely freckled girl,\n\nNaked inside those wraps of clothing,\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe you are dressed\n\nUnderneath too, like an old armchair,\n\nA crucifix of gray patched cloth,\n\nBut no bare touches where the secrets grow,\n\nSoft as mushrooms underneath.\n\nA boy handing behind the bus wants to fly.\n\nHe squats on the rear fender, wondering\n\nWhat the spread-eagled shape is grinning at him\n\nFrom the scarred pavement, like Michelangelo's Prisoner.\n\nBroknm arms, yellow grin. No wings, but rising\n\nFrom the mirror with the flesible haste\n\nOf internal injuries.\n\nIn the middle of Broadway a tree strips down for winter.\n\nIt reminds me of Robinson Crussoe\n\nWho sat on his island, winter and summer,\n\nMoving his lips with squirrely haste,\n\nWhile cars and buses grunted by him on both sides.\n\nHe too stripped down for winter long ago\n\nNow, alone among the carnivores,\n\nFace creased like a prune, he is master\n\nOf all he surveys, and blind to boot.\n\nThe sky darkens. Old men hurry home before the knives.\n\nIt is odd to think our movements come from within,\n\nAs if gusts of wind blew from each separate bone;\n\nEach of us a hurricane - calm eyes, violent flesh -\n\nMaking memories for windless days.\n\n* * *\n\nAnswering the Storm\n\nMy words are not sung, they are not spoken.\n\nThey crowd under my skin,\n\nThey die and are buried in the graves\n\nOf my skin.\n\n*\n\nI see the unread poems in store windows:\n\nA fire hydrant with two black nipples,\n\nMen kissing in a doorway with lips like razor blades.\n\nAn alarm gallops in the street\n\nSpreading quiet among the deaf who listen,\n\nThinking they hear.\n\n*\n\nThe mourners cannot keep still,\n\nTheir laughter shakes in the grass.\n\nYou can answer the storm only with a storm,\n\nThe quiet only with a deeper quiet.\n\n*\n\nSunset pours in my fingers.\n\nDespair is a room where teeth flash\n\nBut not words,\n\nLips but not hungers.\n\nYou turn over on the bed,\n\nWaves hiss onto the rocks;\n\nNear the beach, a white seal wallows\n\nIn pale water.\n\n*\n\nI answer you, running from the half-opened mouth\n\nWhich brays behind me.\n\nAre those prayers it cries?\n\nI don't think so. Wounds, yes.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Lover\n\nA stone crushes you when you breathe.\n\nYou feel weary,\n\nLike freezing in a snowdrift.\n\nWhat kind of life kills itself anyway?\n\nWhat are its tools?\n\nA few drinks, a little talk.\n\nYou lean against the window\n\nKnowing you could jump\n\nIf you wanted to.\n\nYour feet echo\n\nAs you go downstairs,\n\nWalking stiffly against the wind.\n\nYou don't stop to buy a newspaper,\n\nYou wait absently for the green light,\n\nSmiling at the doorman of the cold house\n\nWhere your lover waits,\n\nHis beak gagged open, his wedge-shaped tongue\n\nTrembling.\n\n* * *\n\nPART TWO\n\n* * *\n\nAfter the Creation\n\nI\n\nBeetle dozing in the moist clay,\n\nYour bright shell\n\nPumping like a heart;\n\nI watched you crawl\n\nIn the striped darkness of the shed,\n\nResembling an eyelid drooped in the dirt,\n\nA wilted prayer\n\nSmelling of pepper and dead books.\n\nRust clenched into brightness.\n\nII\n\nFrom you I inherit my patience\n\nWith pure horror;\n\nMy faceted eyes, all but one of their gleams\n\nTurned inward;\n\nMy self-knowledge; my dread of footsteps.\n\nBecause you scrapes and clicks\n\nAre brothers to the small tongues of earth.\n\nBecause in my solitude you outnumber me;\n\nBecause, like God, you are everywhere;\n\nBecause the world is manna to beetles.\n\nIII\n\nI dreamt my heart was a beetle.\n\nIt brushed my skin with bare wires,\n\nAnd I had the revelation of stone.\n\nIt twitched in the passageways of my throat.\n\nIt ate me from within, creating hunger\n\nAnd the seasons of flesh;\n\nIt died and left me with a book of skin,\n\nMy only honesty.\n\nIV\n\nBut when the beetle unfolds its stubby wings,\n\nWhen its eyes wander like watery pins,\n\nThere will be nothing.\n\nNo children killed over again\n\nBefore your eyes.\n\nNothing to crawl through the insomniac streets,\n\nAdrift in the ominous peacefulness\n\nOf work and love.\n\nThe chitinous claw descends like a snowflake,\n\nAnd the beetle of the first day,\n\nThe life-lode,\n\nStarts over again its countdown toward nightmare.\n\n* * *\n\nRobinson Crusoe's Notebook\n\nWhen I am alone,\n\nThe world becomes an erotic dream.\n\nSex boils in my shoes,\n\nI plunge my penis into every open flower.\n\nBushes sway, pendulous and ripe;\n\nI touch them timidly.\n\nOn my hilltop of erect green leaves\n\nThe other words are gone:\n\nFriends, lovers, acquaintances;\n\nThe quiet surrounds them like a moist palm.\n\nMy skin explores the earth.\n\nPine shadows touch me, and I yield,\n\nWading in their milky darkness,\n\nAfraid to have a name,\n\nAfraid it will search me out\n\nLike a shirt of weariness.\n\nSilence is sex,\n\nSolitude is sex.\n\nThe unused body blossoms into sex.\n\nEarth colour of marmalade,\n\nFailed wells inside me spitting dust\n\nAnd broken stones,\n\nSuddenly you are filled with water,\n\nLike a hand kneading my soft flesh,\n\nDrooped over me by the slow wind of sex,\n\nAnd the warm wind of sex.\n\n*\n\nI remember the smile of a woman\n\nWho hadn't spoken for three days,\n\nHer lips smelling of cold ash,\n\nHer stomach flat as a wish;\n\nA woman with no hungers.\n\nHer hands were tunnels,\n\nShe had faces I had never sen.\n\nHer face of cold grass,\n\nBreasts whispering to themselves;\n\nHer face without music\n\nBent inward like a prayer;\n\nHer face of rain misting slowly, bitterly.\n\nWhen she talked,\n\nLoaves of quiet heaped\n\nIn the green light of the cafe.\n\n*\n\nConvalescing after a deep wound.\n\nIt is June, and they are cutting hay.\n\nThe obedient stalks fall silently all one way\n\nAs the fields are put in order,\n\nI too lie down all one way,\n\nObedient to the memory of pain,\n\nAbiding by its wish.\n\nInside me, the ache of healing,\n\nAs if I prayed with my flesh.\n\nEven the scar resembles a language\n\nI must learn.\n\n*\n\nWhat is left when pain goes away?\n\nNot a body, not even expectations.\n\nThe animal goes on twitching\n\nAfter its dead.\n\nI have been broken,\n\nAs light is broken when it penetrates water.\n\nI don't even frighten birds,\n\nThey settle on my hand.\n\nAll the loneliness in the world\n\nGathers here,\n\nBillowing toward the sun.\n\nIt will rain, they say.\n\nBut rain is food,\n\nAnd loneliness doesn't give,\n\nIt takes.\n\n*\n\nThe scratching noise of a cicada,\n\nBranches floating at different levels in the forest,\n\nAn ant lost on a sea of pink trousers.\n\nSuddenly a deer browsing a few feet away,\n\nMe frozen still, not blinking or breathing.\n\nHe must smell me, because he backs off\n\nCautiously between low-hanging branches.\n\nMeat-eaters are lonely,\n\nThey smell of danger.\n\n*\n\nAfter several days of not talking,\n\nThe words leave you.\n\nEvery sound becomes their voice:\n\nPear tree, wild clover.\n\nA pair of blue wings settle near my foot.\n\nThe stones resist my impulse\n\nTo explore their resistance to pain.\n\nEven peace becomes warfare.\n\nThe insanities taste you, and it is good.\n\nWill you consent to crawl among them,\n\nKnowing your children?\n\nWill you taste the brackish pond water,\n\nWallowing in grass,\n\nYour face covered with green scum?\n\nYou pick your way through high grass\n\nLike a bird confused by headlights.\n\nYou are the image staring up out of the pond,\n\nAnd the space the branches close behind.\n\nYou take the shape the wind takes\n\nWhen it enters a room\n\nYou have learned the charity of talking;\n\nA circle that cannot close, and yet is perfect.\n\n* * *\n\nA Song\n\nI looked at the earth until the earth looked into me,\n\nAnd the smell of chestnut blossoms made me sleepy;\n\nAnd the forest, like a rotten quilt, warmed me and chilled me.\n\nA chestnut trunk shivered beside me\n\nAs rain hit the leaves and rolled free.\n\nMy lives stood up in speckled sunlight and talked with me.\n\nTheir voices were muffled by wrecked leaves and moss.\n\nA breeze crept in their faces, their words were lost,\n\nLike a handful of seeds dropped on the yellow moss.\n\n* * *\n\nThe failure of Narcissus\n\nI\n\nA pool of water\n\nScooped in the flat of a rock.\n\nWhen I look into it I see nothing,\n\nNot even my face;\n\nOnly a trap door of ripples.\n\nDizziness grabs me under my shirt.\n\nIt's a long way into the red weave of trees,\n\nA long chilly way.\n\nThe black wingtips of a hawk\n\nLean against the wind.\n\nII\n\nA chalky quiet seeps under trees\n\nAnd rubs against the white stone cliffs.\n\nMy face opens wide, exposing a face of uncut stone.\n\nPainstakingly I write down these words,\n\nTrying to reach you from the face where I am shipwrecked,\n\nInhuman, recalling the movement of lips\n\nLike waves along a beach.\n\n* * *\n\nKeeping the Peace\n\nI would like to write for nobody.\n\nTo hide my words under a stone\n\nAnd wait for an answer, questioning\n\nThe roar of branches in the night wind.\n\nIs it for me? Is this the criticism\n\nI can expect?\n\n* * *\n\nThe Face of Not Talking\n\nWind whose secrets are told\n\nIn the chestnut wood;\n\nButterfly topping toward me, flower-high;\n\nI hang on to you, needing your help\n\nAgainst the creatures of silence,\n\nSmooth wanderers made of not talking,\n\nOf stumbling day by day\n\nInto the face of quietness.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Encounter\n\nCome close and hug me, strange faces,\n\nFlesh-makers,\n\nTreading down the grass beside me\n\nIn the world, where I am alone\n\nTo be with you, delicate-toothed,\n\nSlack-jawed mothers.\n\n* * *\n\nPART THREE\n\n* * *\n\nTo the Red Angel, Isidore Ducasse, Count of Lautréamont\n\nI\n\nA man reveals himself to a tree\n\nAlong Riverside Drive.\n\nLight falls from his narrow face\n\nAnd his incomplete eyes;\n\nWhile the sperm of lonely men\n\nLie jewel-like on the leaves.\n\nII\n\nDawn of blue milk and rolled newspapers;\n\nDawn of incantations, when the poet\n\nSpits into a dried well,\n\nAnd water the colour of arsenic spurts forth;\n\nYour moth-eaten black cloak,\n\nYour face like the wing-span of a bat,\n\nAre impatient.\n\nThe lamp-carrying vampire has slept too long.\n\nThe crabs in the caves of the flesh\n\nAre anxious and pale.\n\nIII\n\nThe stick woman stands in a glass booth\n\nWith her mouth tilted open,\n\nGiving a piece of her mind to the stale air:\n\n\"I want you to know what's on my mind,\n\nI want you to know about floating.\n\nIt's sleeping out, why don't you\n\nKeep me warm? Are you listening,\n\nAre you a victim?\"\n\nI know you, dark specialist,\n\nKnife-point of trembles,\n\nTelephone with your guts hanging out.\n\nThese are you streets\n\nWhere everything eats itself alive.\n\nIV\n\nLautréamont, my vampire,\n\nMy exile,\n\nI'd give a lot to know what you looked like,\n\nWho your lovers were,\n\nWhat desert baked in your skull\n\nWhen you wrote out fables for the new Kabbala,\n\nThe book of cruelties.\n\nYou walked in the early light\n\nAmong dog turds, picnic wrappers\n\nAnd the astonished green of city grass.\n\nYou said nothing, but your lips moved\n\nAnd a bird leapt out;\n\nFrom the jaws of the bird, a fish;\n\nFrom the fish, a jackal with moonlike teeth.\n\nFrom the open wound crawled a quiver\n\nOf scales and saliva.\n\nIt was your birthright, and your clung sucking\n\nTo its belly.\n\nV\n\nYou possess the key to a room without windows.\n\nAround the table a crowd eats and drinks\n\nWithout sound. There are boys and mothers,\n\nPale ladies in green velvet, lace cuffs.\n\nSometimes the room trembles. You wake up,\n\nAnd peer through half-closed eyes\n\nAt the table where a new guest eats and drinks.\n\nYou see the scar at the base of his neck\n\nWhere you dreamed him.\n\nVI\n\nOnce I found a stone angel.\n\nIts wings were humped,\n\nIts eyes halfway between murder\n\nAnd pleading.\n\nMaybe its chipped face\n\nWas an image\n\nOf the killer sharpening his tools\n\nIn the smiles of happy men.\n\nLautréamont, that angel is the face\n\nI give you.\n\nIt is yours, for nothing.\n\nVII\n\nWhen you died, Paris was at war;\n\nPeople starved in the streets;\n\nThe ghost inside you hugged by a deadlier ghost.\n\nAnd this is what killed you:\n\nThe horror at no longer being alone.\n\n* * *\n\nInsomnia\n\nI\n\nInsomnia is the long way around.\n\nI think of colourless faces, who choose\n\nThe assignation of sweat and smell and too much time.\n\nThey go where the sleepers go, but they do not hurry,\n\nSending each part of their body to a separate death.\n\nII\n\nYou sit beside me on my red sofa,\n\nIt is like sitting alone.\n\nShadows from a passing bus crawl over the floor;\n\nThey remind me of men, lips caked with gray,\n\nWalking limply from streetlight to streetlight.\n\nIII\n\nBut now even the poor are sleeping,\n\nAnd the old people in their green rooms,\n\nFaces almost innocent as they practice\n\nThe leap into death. I watch them\n\nIn torn black coats, athletic and solitary,\n\nLips chewing bits of memory, like old bread.\n\nIV\n\nWe sleep fitfully,\n\nPinned to our beds by an enormous weight.\n\nThe night is soft, pulpy as a bruise.\n\nWe cover over this wound with our faces.\n\nOur ambitions bandage it, our talk soothes it.\n\nWe are a way of forgetting the night.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Sentence\n\nAn eye stares at me\n\nFrom the dark connection, as I head out of December\n\nInto another ending.\n\nSoftly the body fails.\n\nI am the victim in a room, composing letters\n\nTo myself.\n\nIt is the small talk prisoners know.\n\n* * *\n\nPART FOUR\n\n* * *\n\nThe City of Changes, Venice 1973\n\nI\n\nReturning to thunder, white buildings,\n\nAnd a damp smell rising from the sidewalk.\n\nLightning plunges through me, exposing\n\nThe gray wall I lean against\n\nLike Rodin's half-carved statues.\n\nI feel sympathy for the motionless water,\n\nIt is a mirror with no gift for images,\n\nA cat's eye attuned to the miracle of loneliness,\n\nManeuvering in the shadowy space with sure feet.\n\nRemembering too much or too little,\n\nI have the solidity of a rainstorm,\n\nBeating sudden fingers into oily water,\n\nMolding myself minute by minute\n\nTo this beautiful grave.\n\nII\n\nWhat comes from water must return to it;\n\nFirst the image goes, later we follow.\n\nThis passage over black sand,\n\nThis passage between names we know as thirst;\n\nSearching for shadows where the light fails and we begin,\n\nBearing maps, compass, legible stars,\n\nAnd a sound rising in concert that does not touch the silence,\n\nMerging, cell by cell, into one bodily song.\n\nListen!\n\nIt is the city subsiding into patience\n\nUnder rose-coloured bricks;\n\nIt is the green anguish of doorsills;\n\nIt is the tide feeling its way along marble steps;\n\nIt is a floor for echoes;\n\nIt is the impossibility of touching what we see,\n\nCarried further by death, so much further.\n\nIII\n\nThese are the changes we know:\n\nA desert whispering into flower,\n\nA lover betrayed,\n\nA tree choosing its darkness.\n\nEach day we fail, sitting in forgotten chairs,\n\nChanging our sex, our colour,\n\nLoving what we hate.\n\nWe choose death over again.\n\nLike a bride without smiles\n\nWe marry the stone husband who hugs us,\n\nOur perfect shadow, inscribed with our name.\n\nMy exhausted eyes, my face\n\nStaring up at me from the water,\n\nAre traveler's wounds.\n\nBeneath them hides the life the wild man saw\n\nLike a sediment in his cup of visions.\n\nIV\n\nAdrift on the surface of death,\n\nHe caressed its image, and they spoke to him,\n\nStirred by a strange wind which crept out of roots,\n\nRasping and sighing, for they spoke with his own breath:\n\n\"Come into the marketplace,\n\nCome into the city of changes\n\nWhere we live, as in a mirror.\n\nHaving given up your name, you will move\n\nAcross the space of death without hindrance.\n\nYou will be a link between all things,\n\nA road of images.\n\n\"The heavy flesh of dahlias,\n\nTheir translucid green stems,\n\nWhatever smolders in its own sunlight,\n\n- Bird, fish, or man - barters its name\n\nAnd its memory in the marketplace of death.\n\n\"You will be the bridge and the water under it.\n\nYou will be the soil and the root.\n\nYou will be the blood and the vein it flows through.\n\nYou will be the rock and the wind.\n\nThe poem plunges in your flesh,\n\nIts needle wounds you. You are its food.\n\nOnly in your can the poem become alive.\"\n\nV\n\nWe are a soil for violent flowers.\n\nWe eat envy, anguish is our poem.\n\nYet things become beautiful in our company.\n\nThis day is cool and bright.\n\nBehind each gate geraniums burst like glances,\n\nThe ocean extends its patient fingers between the buildings.\n\nThe peace we cannot live surrounds us,\n\nPenetrating the pores of buildings.\n\nIt is our gift to another country,\n\nLike the unburied ghost of heroes\n\nWho walk at night and leave their messages.\n\nThings grow old in it and become human,\n\nAs we cannot do."
