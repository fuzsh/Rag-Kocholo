        "text": "Advertisement\n\nGully Foyle is my name\n\nAnd Terra is my nation\n\nDeep space is my dwelling place\n\nThe Stars my destination\n\nHow's that for a hook? Pretty compelling stuff, isn't it? You have no idea. Wait until you get into the novel. This is what adventure is all about. Adventure and a whole lot more.\n\nYou've probably seen The Stars My Destination included in every science fiction top ten list published. Forty-five years have passed since it was first published and it's yet to be knocked out of the masters' circle. That's a pretty impressive statement. Bester's classic has the stuff to back it up.\n\nMeet Gully Foyle. He's not exactly one of the good guys, but he's your hero for this trip. Foyle's life has never been easy, but as the novel opens he is in about the worst predicament of his life -- stranded in space, alone, with little or no chance of rescue. Like I said, the worst scrape of his life... yet. Things are bound to get better for Foyle; things for the people who betrayed him are bound to get so much worse.\n\nCall him what you want: criminal, victim, have-not, survivor, scoundrel; he is at all times a very dangerous man. If revenge is a dish best served cold, Foyle doesn't have the time or passion to wait around for it to cool. Get ready for some rough stuff. Really rough stuff. But, will vengeance be as sweet as he hopes?\n\nBester's portrayal of a divided society where the rich are the real masters of the universe, is social commentary at its best. It's a lesson that slips seamlessly into the brain, riding on the back of a non-stop action story. This world, where a jaunte can transport a person's body across thousands of miles, is closed to someone like Foyle who appears to be not worth the time and trouble it takes to teach this feat.\n\nThe Stars My Destination holds on to its coveted top ten rating with its dazzling mixture of tantalizing plot, multi-faceted cast of characters, social commentary, and chilling speculation. Thousands of science fiction stories have been published since this amazing novel appeared in 1956. Good, bad, superb -- none has bumped Bester's landmark novel from the list of the genre's true classics."
