I was intrigued therefore when she recommended Winterlong as something she sincerely enjoyed, and something she believed I would also enjoy, given my own love of exploring alien worlds, and stories which highlight the best of humanity against a dark background.Wendy Wande...\n\n9.3/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Galaxy and the Ground Within by Becky Chambers (Wayfarers)\n\nWhen you read a book's cover blurb, and it's clearly just a variation on an author's previous work, your first impulse is usually to groan. Even if you enjoy that author, knowing that you're in for essentially a repeat performance will likely lower your expectations. With Becky Chambers however, having a good idea of what we'...\n\n7.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Hounds of the Morrigan by Pat OShea\n\nLike many people, I tend to find I still enjoy the books I enjoyed as a child now. Of course, that's partly because of sweet sweet nostalgia, however, I also often discover aspects of childhood favourites, such as Roald Dahl's word play and warped sense of humour, or Susan Cooper's poetic darkness, which I can still appreciate as an ...\n\n9.8/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern\n\nErin Morgenstern's first novel, The Night Circus, had been a pretty unforgettable experience, so when my lady informed me her second book involved writing which was just as gorgeous, but exchanged the fantastical circus attractions for an exploration of stories and other worlds, my interest was definitely peaked.Zachary Ezra Rawlins o...\n\n8.8/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nA Sudden Wild Magic by Diana Wynne Jones\n\nIn the early nineties, adults apparently didn't read teen or children's literature without a sense of shame. Throwing a bone to her adult readers, Diana Wynne Jones took all of the things she liked putting in books for children, magic, multiple universes, complex plots with colourful characters and attempted to put them into a book with ...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDark Orbit by Carolyn Ives Gilman\n\nDark Orbit was a book that literally had my name on it. Having grown up on big, philosophical science fiction, from Asimov, Aldiss and Clarke, to Le Guin and Pohl, it was certainly a concept that would've caught my attention, quite aside from the book having some definite personal resonances for me.In the distant future universe of th...\n\n6.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Taking by Dean Koontz\n\nHaving just finished a rather large fantasy epic, I was looking for something short, stand alone, and in a different genre. So, given how much I'd enjoyed Phantoms, I decided it was time to try another book by Dean Koontz. I'll admit I was a little surprised to find apocalyptic science fiction, when I was expecting a more typical horror,...\n\n6.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nA Man Rides Through by Stephen Donaldson (Mordant's Need)\n\nWith The Mirror of Her Dreams not so much concluding as stopping mid-way through, it's not surprising that I moved on to the second volume so quickly. What is surprising, is just how excellent the second volume of this duology is, probably the best thing of Donaldson's I've ever read.Never before has Terisa so much wanted to d...\n\n9.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nMirror of Her Dreams by Stephen Donaldson (Mordant's Need)\n\nI've always had something of a love/hate relationship with the works of Stephen R. Donaldson, and have at times found his books beautiful, baffling, poetic, pretentious, irritating and awesome in equal measure. However, one thing they certainly aren't is run of the mill fantasy, so wanting to explore a different world, I thought it was t...\n\n8.2/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nNo Good Dragon Goes Unpunished by Rachel Aaron (Heartstrikers)\n\nAfter some heavy-going science fiction, I was looking for something light, but perhaps not too fluffy, something pacey and exciting to get stuck into which would thoroughly grab my attention.Whilst the second Heartstrikers book had been as colourful as the first, it had raised the stakes, increased the tension and graduated from popcorn i...\n\n5.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nChild of the Prophecy by Juliet Marillier (The Sevenwaters Trilogy: Book 2)\n\nGiven how good the first two books were, it should be no surprise that my lady and I started Child of the Prophecy so quickly. After all, the titular prophecy has been a looming presence right from the start, not to mention the vengeful sorceress Lady Oonagh, and while each of the previous stories had been complete in itself, it was obvious that...\n\n9.3/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBy the Sword by Mercedes Lackey (Kerowyn's Tale)\n\nHaving enjoyed Brightly Burning, and being in the mood for an easy going bit of fantasy, I decided it was finally time to get back to Valdemar, and what’s more, conclude the story of the war with the horrid prince of Hardorn from Arrow’s fall. Unfortunately, looking at the background material which began Mage Winds, the book that fol...\n\n4.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Merlin Conspiracy by Diana Wynne Jones (Magids)\n\nDiana Wynne Jones has an odd way of writing sequels. Far from carrying on a story in a new volume, or even providing more adventures for her previous protagonists, her sequels are usually told from the perspective of entirely different people, take place in different parts of the world, or even entirely different worlds, and have little or nothi...\n\n8.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nNeverness by David Zindell (The Neverness Cycle)\n\nOne book which had an incredibly dramatic effect on me as a teenager, was Terry Carr's Best SF of the Year Volume 15; oddly enough the only one of the series I could access in audio. Carr himself called it \"a book of epics\", noting how often a short story or novella can capture more horror, wonder or beauty than many a novel, and h...\n\n7.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins (Hunger Games)\n\nFor both my lady and me, the hype surrounding The Hunger Games trilogy slightly put us off reading it. For my part, I only bothered when I was busy with an intensive singing course and needed some light distraction, which is what I believed The Hunger Games would be; something low on serious characters or ideas, and high on action a...\n\n9.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Dark Game by Jonathan Janz\n\nA quick look at the dates of the books I've reviewed will show that I don't care too much when something is published. Since I chiefly choose my reading matter based on recommendations from people I trust; especially my lady, I don't tend to bother with what the latest big thing in the fiction world is. Indeed, when so often I see bo...\n\n8.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nSon of the Shadows by Juliet Marillier (The Sevenwaters Trilogy)\n\nDaughter of the Forest could easily have been a standalone novel. The fairy tale it told was finished, the characters journeys complete, there was even as close to a happily ever after as might be possible in such a realistic world. Yet, there were still loose ends hanging , in particular the marked absence of a certain evil sorceress, and a ver...\n\n8.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDreamsnake by Vonda N McIntyre\n\nVonda N McIntyre’s 1973 short story, the evocatively titled Of Mist and Grass and Sand, was truly beautiful, tragic and compelling, so, when I needed a break from high tension fantasy and wanted something a bit more poetic, I decided to read the novel based on that short story, a story which; since it features a rather unique take on the m...\n\n8.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nPet Sematary by Stephen King\n\nPet Sematary was apparently my lady's first run in with Stephen King at the age of twelve. It scared her so badly, she woke her friend with a terrified 2 am phone call! She was also so captivated, she then proceeded to read every Stephen King she could for the next few years. I on the other hand read Pet Sematary at about fourteen (my own in...\n\n9.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBlack House by Stephen King (Talisman)\n\nBlack House is another book I’ve waited quite a while to read. Back in 2001, when 19 year old me befriended a fellow Stephen King fan at university, who lent me Hearts in Atlantis on audio cassette), he happened to mention he was reading the really awesome new book which King had co-written with Peter Straub, sequel to their previous colla...\n\n8.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDaughter of the Forest by Juliet Marillier (The Sevenwaters Trilogy)\n\nLike many books I’ve read, Daughter of the Forest was a recommendation from my lady. Indeed, I first read it in 2015, just a few days before flying to America to spend Christmas with her family where I got engaged. I was so obviously distracted, I wasn’t really in a state to write a review, which, given how good Daughter of the Fores...\n\n9.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nFate of the Tearling by Erika Johansen (The Tearling Trilogy)\n\nInvasion of the Tearling left me pretty much in the same state as its predecessor, admitting that the book had its issues, but still forced by the cliff-hanger ending and driving style to continue to see what happened. Also, with the second book improving upon the first, there was reason to expect an upswing in quality and an epic conclusion. Un...\n\n3.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nInvasion of the Tearling by Erika Johansen (The Tearling Trilogy)\n\nWhile I was slightly ambivalent about Queen of the Tearling, something I absolutely cannot deny is that the book was extremely compelling, and that it left major questions to which I wanted answers. So, on that basis it isn’t too surprising that I returned to the series so quickly.Kelsea has assumed the Tearling throne and put a sto...\n\n6.8/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Shining by Stephen King\n\nI first read The Shining in 2010; an isolated dip into King's writing between my period reading his books as a teen and young adult, and my rediscovery (and indeed further exploration), of King with my lady since 2015.Though it was Under the Dome which ...\n\n9.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDeep Secret by Diana Wynne Jones (Magids)\n\nDiana Wynne Jones is an author I really wish I’d been able to read more of while growing up, but was unfortunately unable to due to the ever present ogre of my childhood: lack of availability in audio. Happily now that I am grown up (or so people tell me), and said ogre has been metaphorically slain thanks to modern technology, I can not o...\n\n8.3/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nOne Good Dragon Deserves Another by Rachel Aaron (Heartstrikers)\n\nAs with Brightly Burning, I will freely admit that part of the reason I started back into Rachel Aaron’s saga of the world’s nicest dragon was because I wanted something light and fluffy in a time of fairly heavy darkness. Yet, once again I found myself getting rather more than I bargained for.This has been the happiest month ...\n\n8.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBurn by Julianna Baggott (Pure Trilogy)\n\nWith the second book improving upon the first, and a potentially explosive setup for the final conclusion, obviously seeing how things; well Burn, in the last book was something I very much wanted to do.Before getting into my thoughts about Burn, be aware that I'll necessarily have to mention a couple of spoilers for Pure and Fuse, so...\n\n6.8/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDuma Key by Stephen King\n\nFor some reason, Duma Key is another of Stephen King’s books which tends to get pushed to the side. Unlike Rose Madder, it doesn’t seem this is because it’s disliked, or even ignored, most reviews I’ve seen are positive, though perhaps not as ...\n\n8.2/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBrightly Burning by Mercedes Lackey (The Heralds of Valdemar)\n\nAs I was fancying a fantasy novel, and for once was not quite in the mood for something dark, heavy or long, a short standalone trip to Valdemar seemed just the thing.Though set a few centuries after the time of herald mage Vanyel, brightly burning also recounts the tale of a legendary hero Talia read about in Arrows of the Queen.S...\n\n7.8/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nAncient, Strange, and Lovely by Susan Fletcher (The Dragon Chronicles)\n\nWhatever issues I have had with Susan Fletcher's Dragon Chronicles trilogy in the past, the one element which has always been absolutely solid has been the dragons! Majestic and beautiful adult dragons with their overwhelming presence, and of course the antics of exasperating, endearing draclings. So seeking for something relaxing to read in...\n\n6.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nImago by Octavia Butler (Lilith's Brood)\n\nI always expected the third in Octavia Butler’s Lilith’s Brood trilogy to be a difficult book, as the first two were, which is why I took such a long time between Adulthood Rights and Imago. I did not expect Imago to leave me feeling as deeply disturbed as it has done, or that my reaction to the book would be this visceral.In ...\n\n4.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nNight and Silence by Seanan McGuire (October Daye)\n\nOnly a glance at my previous reviews will show that the October Daye series is one which varies in quality quite a bit. While there have been some incredibly good entries, and some merely good entries, sometimes the series has been passable at best and on one occasion (The Winter Long), down right bad. The previous book however, The Brightest Fe...\n\n4.3/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBag of Bones by Stephen King\n\nI have been rediscovering Stephen King over the past few years, and often I find I appreciate his books even more as an adult with a bit of reading and life experience, than I did when I first ran across them as a teenager. This is particularly true of Bag of Bones, which I do remember enjoying, but which didn’t make half as much impressio...\n\n8.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nFuse by Julianna Baggott (Pure Trilogy)\n\nYou might think that with the state of the world right now, reading dystopia apocalypse fiction; (hey look, I made a word!), would be the last thing I’d want to do. Oddly though, it was the fast action, immediacy, and sheer cinematic thrill ride that I remember from Pure, which recommended Fuse to me at this point, since there’s noth...\n\n7.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nTo Be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers\n\nWhen my lady and I were looking for a cooperative reading venture to balance the avalanche of grimness currently sweeping the world, Becky Chambers seemed a very obvious choice. After all, we’d both loved her Wayfarer trilogy, particularly the way they managed to be deeply uplifting and positive without wallowing in sugar, so there was eve...\n\n6.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Cold Moons by Aeron Clement\n\nI have always enjoyed exploring alternative viewpoints and alien worlds; even when these worlds are right here on earth under our very noses. Stories like Tad Williams' Tailchaser's Song or Richard Adams' Watership Down, posseting the idea that animals, whilst still being animals, also have their own society, language and concerns. W...\n\n5.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nPure by Julianna Baggott (Pure Trilogy)\n\nI've generally found the recent YA dystopia boom to be something of a mixed bag. Sometimes as in The Hunger Games or The Maze Runner we end up with something truly dark and compelling full of interesting characters, at others however we simply wind up with a paint by numbers teen romance set at a 1984 costume party. Even before starting Pure...\n\n7.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nBlitzcat by Robert Westall\n\nI first encountered blitzcat as a teenager, working my way through all of my school library's books on tape. I've never been a huge fan of war stories, but there was something compelling about Robert Westall's book, and of course though I'm probably rather more canine than feline inclined, I do enjoy books about animals, especial...\n\n8.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nMagnificat by Julian May (Galactic Milieu Trilogy: Book 2)\n\nMagnificat is a somewhat strange entry to finish the series on. Though chronologically last in the Galactic Milieu trilogy, it also serves as the final prequel before Julian May's Pleistocene Exile series, making it both at one and the same time Return of the Jedi, and Revenge of the Sith, both an ending and a beginning, a triumph and a trag...\n\n8.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Talisman by Stephen King (Talisman)\n\nI was first recommended The Talisman way back in 2001 by a King loving friend. Despite being a collaboration between King and Straub, I assumed, like Under the Dome and The Green Mile,The Talisman was one of the books in the King canon that I’d not yet read, but was well known by King fanatics like my friend.Oddly though, it seems t...\n\n9.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nAdulthood Rites by Octavia Butler (Lilith's Brood)\n\nI can’t exactly say I was “looking forward” to reading the second Lilith’s Brood book. Dawn had been compelling, rich and unique, and also at times incredibly uncomfortable, disturbing and full of hard questions, and so it’s sequel wasn’t the sort of thing you exactly “look forward” to. It was howe...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nNice Dragons Finish Last by Rachel Aaron (Heartstrikers)\n\nAs I have mentioned before, I am a bit of a dracophile (which really should be a word), that is to say, I love dragons. I’m also keen on books with protagonists who are simply nice people trying their best, so the title and premise of this one grabbed my attention right away. I was a wee bit surprised when I found out I was reading a hodge...\n\n6.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nFlowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes\n\nI’m honestly amazed I never heard of Flowers for Algernon earlier, especially considering the work I did in ethics regarding people with learning disabilities. Reading through one of the collections of Nebula Award winners, I ran across Daniel Keyes on account of how he came to write the story, the ideas he had and how Charlie himself was ...\n\n9.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDiamond Mask by Julian May (Galactic Milieu Trilogy)\n\nWith especially complex series, it never pays to wait too long between instalments, and though Jack the Bodiless had been thoroughly enjoyable, there is no denying that it wasn’t exactly an easy book to get into, especially given the rather sad lack of convenient plot details available online. Indeed, a bit of internet sifting indicates th...\n\n8.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Boneless Mercies by April Genevieve Tucholke\n\nI first ran across Beowulf at about four; a fantastically dark and gory version in Robert Nye’s book three tales. So, when an invocation of the god of random numbers landed on The Boneless Mercies, a version of the story featuring lady assassins, I was cautiously interested, particularly since I was in the mood for some epic battles and my...\n\n8.2/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDawn by Octavia Butler (Lilith's Brood)\n\nAs I’ve said before in reviews, one of my absolute loves in science fiction is exploring very alien aliens, beings who do not just look different, but think, react and relate to each other in a truly inhuman way. Therefore Lilith’s Brood was obviously a trilogy I needed to read, as it contains some of the strangest aliens ever writte...\n\n9.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Brightest Fell by Seanan McGuire (October Daye)\n\nDespite a rousing success in Chimes at Midnight, the October Daye series has been a little disappointing lately. With an eighth book that was simply bad, a ninth book which was at best a pleasant interlude, and a tenth book which was barely passable, as well as no real hints of an overall series plot, as I said in my last review my lady and I we...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe White Dragon by Anne McCaffrey (The Dragon Rider's Saga)\n\nReading the Dragon Riders Series in order is not always easy, especially with The White Dragon. Though McCaffery was at work on the sequel to Dragonquest in the mid-seventies, she took time out to publish the first two books concerning Menolly, Dragonsong and Dragonsinger. Just to make things even more confusing, Dragondrumbs, though nominally a...\n\n6.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nJack the Bodiless by Julian May (Galactic Milieu Trilogy)\n\nLike David Brin, Julian May is a science fiction author I managed to miss out on due to the sketchiness of audio availability, an oversight which my lady is thankfully now able to correct. Indeed, also like Brin’s Uplift Saga, May’s Galactic Milieu trilogy is one of my lady’s favourite series, so it was definitely something we&...\n\n8.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nGerald's Game by Stephen King\n\nGerald’s game was a book I consciously avoided as a teenager, even going as far as returning it back to the library unread. Partly this was because the premise sounded disturbingly like Misery, my least favourite King novel, and partly it was because I was suffering extreme genophobia (fear of sex), at the time and the very premise Gerald&...\n\n8.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nHammerfall by C J Cherryh (Gene Wars)\n\nDespite a previous good experience with her book Serpent’s Reach, due to an almost total lack of availability in audio while I was growing up, I’d largely missed out on C J Cherryh, a rich and complex science fiction author so well respected she recently had an asteroid named after her. With my liking for journey stories and explorin...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nAn Unkindness of Magicians by Kat Howard\n\nGiven how awesome Roses and Rot was, it was only a matter of time before I tried out Kat Howard’s next full length novel, a book built on a truly intriguing premise.There is an unseen world hidden among New York’s wealthy elite, a world where old established houses of magicians manoeuvre for power and status. Every twenty year...\n\n6.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson\n\nShirley Jackson is an author with quite a reputation. Favourite of writers such as Stephen King, Harlan Ellison and Niel Gaimen, and author of several landmark stories in the history of horror and weird psychological fiction, despite having passed away sixty years ago her legacy just seems to keep on growing. Indeed, it’s nice to think a l...\n\n9.3/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nDragondrums by Anne McCaffery (The Dragon Rider's Saga)\n\nDragondrums was a new experience for me. While as a teenager I’d read a fair few of the Dragonriders series, thanks to the fickle nature of audio tape availability and the lack of anywhere to look up a reading order I’d somehow missed Dragondrums. So on the one hand, it was my first new McCaffery novel in about nineteen years. On the...\n\n7.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Face of the Waters by Robert Silverberg\n\nIt is rather sad that from being one of the late twentieth century’s most prolific sf authors and editors, Robert Silverberg seems to have slightly fallen off the map these days. Even when other notable past masters like Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke are remembered, people either do not remember Silverberg at all, or dismiss his materia...\n\n8.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nRecord of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers (Wayfarers)\n\nIn my review of Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, I agreed with Michelle Herbert’s assessment of the book as like a hug from a close friend. So when Record of a Spaceborn Few came up, it was as if we’d opened the front door to find that close friend standing outside, suitcase in hand, casually explaining that he was in the area and w...\n\n9.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nOnce Broken Faith by Seanon McGuire (October Daye)\n\nOctober Daye has generally been great fun, both the series and the Fae detective for whom it’s named. While some more recent books haven’t quite been up to scratch, McGuire certainly had built up enough good will for my lady and me to hope matters were going to improve, especially given that Once Broken Faith would be carrying on dir...\n\n5.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThis Alien Shore by Celia Friedman\n\nCelia Friedman’s Coldfire trilogy was recommended to me by a friend in 2015, I liked them, even if I did find their romantic elements a bit overblown. Not long after that my entire life was full of overblown romantic elements thanks to that same friend; who is now my wife, so it’s rather interesting returning to Friedman now once aga...\n\n8.2/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nShadowborn by Alison Sinclair (Darkborn Trilogy)\n\nThe third volume of any trilogy always has a lot to live up to, especially when that trilogy is a single ongoing story spread over three books, and even more especially when the very title of that volume promises the appearance of a menacing enemy which has been waiting in the wings since the beginning.While in Minhorne Telmaine negotiate...\n\n7.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins\n\nPossibly due to growing up with Doctor Who, possibly due to just me being a fairly eclectic individual, I’ve never cared too much about genre boundaries. Oh, there are times I might fancy a change of setting, and might swap modern day horror for dystopia, or exchange some traditional space sf for a bit of high fantasy, but that is just ano...\n\n9.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nLightborn by Alison Sinclair (Darkborn Trilogy)\n\nAs I said at the end of the previous review, given how Darkborn ended; or rather didn’t, I literally picked up Lightborn the second I finished reviewing the last book.

After a run of more traditional sf and fantasy therefore when I was looking for a slightly differe...\n\n8.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nShadow Spinner by Susan Fletcher\n\nLike most people, I probably heard of Shahrazad’s tales long before being aware of the lady herself, since I doubt many children’s retellings of Alibaba and the forty thieves, Sinbad the sailor or Aladdin happened to mention that they were being narrated by the wife to a psychotic sultan who would murder her if the story wasn’t...\n\n7.7/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Chimes by Anna Smaill\n\nIt’s very rare that I start a book, have to stop and then need to go back and try it again later, yet this is exactly what happened with The Chimes.

I loved the writing as poetry, but completely missing nuan...\n\n9.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nMagic's Promise by Mercedes Lackey (Last Herald-Mage Trilogy)\n\nThere is very little good to be said about having a rotten cold, especially when said cold comes with a sore throat that makes it difficult to say anything at all. Fortunately, one of the bonuses of being married to a lady who shares both the same reading tastes and the same cold viruses as you is that you can at least catch up on your fantasy, ...\n\n7.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nMagic's Pawn by Mercedes Lackey (Last Herald-Mage Trilogy)\n\nOne problem with long running series, is that authors don’t always write them in chronological order, interspersing books set at one time period with books set earlier on, then confusing matters by including details from the later earlier books in the later later ones.Thus even though the conflict against Hardorn at the end of Arrow...\n\n6.9/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Long Walk by Stephen King\n\nAfter generations have grown up with Stephen King as a byword for horror and fantasy fiction, it seems incredible to think that there was a time when he wasn’t famous. Yet, eight years before the story of a telekinetic teenager would Carrie him to the heady heights of the best seller list, Stephen King was just a young man studying creativ...\n\n9.1/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nWatchers by Dean Koontz\n\nOne thing I notice when I read other people’s book reviews, is that there is so much polarisation. For every review where the reviewer carefully notes what they thought was good or bad in a book and gives a considered opinion, there are usually ten others that declare a book is the best thing ever!

The first, and probably least important reason is that a book deprived childhood and a generally stubborn streak have left me with an inability to stop series mid way through, however more importantly, I have certainly come across authors whose first books a...\n\n7.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nRed Rising by Pierce Brown (Red Rising Trilogy)\n\nI was quite eager to try Red Rising, partly because of Ryan's review, and partly because I loved the idea of combining dystopian fiction with a science fiction setting, particularly a setting with some rather interesting and colourful themes, (colourful in more sense than one). The setting indeed is one of the book's strongest points, si...\n\n5.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Priests of Ferris by Maurice Gee (The O Trilogy)\n\nThe Priests of Ferris in some ways strongly resembles Lewis's Prince Caspian. In one year of human time a century has passed on O, and the exploits of Nick and Susan have become a legend.

Whereas his first collection involved a uniquely grotesque Dahl slant on several traditional fairy tales, Dirty Beasts contains nine poems which detail the exploits of various creatures and children, from a lion who explains his fav...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nRevolting Rhymes by Roald Dahl\n\nTwo of Roald Dahl’s most enduring qualities, and part of what makes him one of the most loved children's authors of all time, are his profound love of the rhythm and flow of language, and his realization that young children do not in fact need everything sugar-coated, that seeing the villainous, cruel or greedy receive appropriate and ...\n\n8.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Queen of the Tearling by Erika Johansen (The Tearling Trilogy)\n\nI have been reading and reviewing books for nigh on seven years now, and in that time I believe I have noticed a creeping trend migrating from the world of comic books, infiltrating the world of genre literature. No longer is a book written solely for the purpose of entertaining a hoped-for reader, rather, some authors view the book-stage of the...\n\n6.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nInfected by Scott Sigler\n\nInfected is a book with a somewhat unusual publishing history. It began (and indeed can still be found) on Podiobooks.com as a series of freely available audio podcast readings by Sigler himself. It has however since made the leap to being published print novel and to the surprise of many made it on to the New York Times best-seller list....\n\n5.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nTake Back Plenty by Colin Greenland\n\nAccording to some authors such as Arthur C Clarke, the purpose of science fiction is simply to explore the possible consequences, benign or malign, of scientific principles, social trends or the ramifications of new technology.Myself however, while such writers as Clarke or Asimov can be an entertaining intellectual puzzle, I prefer my wo...\n\n8.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nSeaward by Susan Cooper\n\nSusan Cooper is an author who I have had a great respect for ever since reading her Dark is Rising books as a child (and indeed more recently as an adult). When I discovered Seaward at the age of 16, I was incredibly pleased to find Cooper's work did not stop with the Dark is Rising, and that she had in fact written a full stand alone fantas...\n\n9.5/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Carpet People by Terry Pratchett\n\nI don't generally count myself as a serious Terry Pratchett fan. That's not to say I don't enjoy his work, I've read almost everything he's written including all 39 Discworld books, however he's not someone I find myself following obsessively or rereading time after time. This is largely because for all the random humour,...\n\n7.0/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nJoyland by Stephen King (Hard Case Crime Series)\n\nMy lady and I decided to take a break from our Sanderson odyssey and so for our next cooperative adventure in reading she suggested Joyland, a surprisingly gentle story; especially as compared to much of King’s other work.Joyland is the tale of 21 year old Devin Jones.

The first; Schwarzschild R...\n\n7.6/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nThe Stand by Stephen King\n\nI don’t know why it's taken me so long to reread the Stand. Certainly (unlike say The Tommyknockers or Misery) it isn’t because I didn’t enjoy it first time around, nor is it, despite its definitely extended length, because I found its beginning long winded or hard to get into.

Though I was too young to watch it upon its first 1984 release, my junior school showed it in 1987 or so when I was five (I had a very nice junior school).

So I was a little surprised when Mrs. Dark read The Host and n...\n\n7.4/10\n\nRead our full review\n\nA Darkness at Sethanon by Raymond E Feist (Riftwar Saga)\n\nAs Prince Arutha and his companions rally their forces for the final battle with an ancient and mysterious evil, the dread necromancer Marcos the Black has once again unleashed his dark sorcerery.
