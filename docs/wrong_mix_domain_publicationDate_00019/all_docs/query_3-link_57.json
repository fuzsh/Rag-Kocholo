        "text": "More stuff from the archive regarding Vernor Vinge though, in this case, he’s just a small part of a big anthology.\n\nRaw Feed (2002): Explorers: SF Adventures to Far Horizons, ed. Gardner Dozois, 2000.\n\n“Preface”, Gardner Dozois — Brief look at the theme of exploration stories in world literature and exploration stories in sf. Dozois notes that the theme wanes and blooms in interest amongst writers. Ironically, when real space exploration, at least of the manned variety, was winding down, space exploration stories in sf were picking up. They used the new scientific findings for romantic and adventure stories set in space like the old planetary romances used uncontradicted speculations.\n\n“The Sentinel”, Arthur C. Clarke — This is at least the second time I’ve read this story which I did not remembered being set in 1996.\n\n“Moonwalk”, H. B. Fyfe — A man against nature tale that reminded me strongly of Jack London, particularly his “Building a Fire”, and the true story of mountain man John Colter. This 1952 story has the sole survivor of a lunar tractor accident walking away from it, trying to find help from his fellow explorers far away before his oxygen gives out. (His wife is one of the members of the lunar base.) Fyfe even throws in some grandiose descriptions of the lunar landscape.\n\n“Grandpa”, James H. Schmitz — The only other time I’ve read this story is about 25 years ago, but I remembered most of it. It’s still a clever story of the unraveling-a-deadly-secret-of-an-alien-ecosystem variety. It does, however, make me want to read more of Schmitz. He strikes me as just as clever at working out alien ecosystems.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIt’s going to be a while before I finish the thick books I’m reading now and there’s not going to be any weird fiction postings this next week.\n\nYou know what that means: a dive into the archives where I found this Retro Review from 2005.\n\nReview: The Annotated Tales of Edgar Allan Poe, ed. Stephen Peithman, 1981.\n\nThis is an indispensable collection of Poe’s short fiction, and Peithman’s annotations are actually useful.\n\nI will discuss only those stories having a fantastic element.\n\n“Introduction”, Stephen Peithman — A pretty good introduction to Poe’s life and the critical reaction around him. Of course some revere him. Others see him as lacking substance, particularly “no human interest” (critic W. C. Brownell’s words) which is false on the face of it. Poe obviously has a lot of human interest given his keen interest in depicting aberrant states of human psychology and perception. What Poe lacks is modern mainstream literature’s obsession with particular characters. Poe’s interest, as befitting a proto-sf writer, is in characters as types and representatives of man in general. Peithman quotes a bunch of famous writers and critics on Poe. Peithman does note Poe’s keen interest in women but seeming lack of sexual desire. He may not have consummated his marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin. In his last month of life, he became a temperance man. Of course, his death is shrouded in mystery. Peithman speculates that occasional hoaxster Poe deliberately chose Rufus Griswold as his literary executor knowing that Griswold’s deliberate besmirchment of his reputation would keep his name and reputation alive.\n\n“Metzengerstein” — Peithman’s introduction says this is the tale of Poe that is closest to the German Gothic tradition. He also notes the presence of the theme of transmigrating souls in several of Poe’s other works besides here. Peithman helpfully notes Poe’s inspirations and source materials as well as cinematic adaptations of the story.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe look at some Joe Haldeman works continues while I work on new stuff.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): The Hemingway Hoax, Joe Haldeman, 1990.\n\nI have mixed reactions to this novel.\n\nUp to the last two chapters, I enjoyed it a lot. They left me puzzled though.\n\nThis is a fun short novel. The idea of a Hemingway expert attempting to forge some lost Hemingway manuscripts and incurring the wrath of “an interdimensional literary critic with a license to kill” (a great line from the dust jacket that appears nowhere in the novel) was the best part of the novel. The interaction between the agent from STAB (The Spacio-Temporal Adjustment Board) and John Baird, Hemingway expert, was blackly, grimly funny as the STAB agent first tries, unsuccessfully, to talk Baird out of forging the manuscripts and then tries, again unsuccessfully, to kill him (with “Happy cancer”). The conversations between the different entities of STAB have the same quality with their dark, cryptic references to the STAB agent’s involvement with the Manson murders.\n\nBaird is an interesting character not only for his photographic memory but the insight he has into other people’s characters. He fully expects and suspects his betrayal by his wife and con-man Sylvester Castlemaine with their affair. Baird flitting from alternate universe to alternate universe was interesting, particularly in seeing how he varied (he is in full possessions of all sets of memory from all universes that his mind goes to) in each one and how his relationships to others change. Castlemaine changes from semi-lovable, roguish conman to dangerous psychopath.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhile I’m off reading things for the next post, I give you this Raw Feed of a book The Books That Time Forgot covered recently.\n\nRaw Feed (1988): After the Zap, Michael Armstrong, 1987.\n\nAdmittedly this book might have been more humorous, engaging, and entertaining if I’d read it in big chunks instead of gnawing at it for over two weeks.\n\nI found it to be overly complicated and the description at times awkward and/or overdone and tedious.\n\nI found the last part of the book the best when Armstrong was most obviously constructing a political commentary/allegory. If he would have infused the rest of the story with that character, it would have been a better novel.\n\nArmstrong, like Dick, seems to have a good grasp of dialogue. He also pays homage to Dick with the references to The Man in the High Castle, and the final revelation of the narrator being the creator of the Zap bomb smacks of the Dick story I seem to remember reading about in which a robot discovers an A-bomb in his chest.\n\nAlfred Bester crops in with the Nukers proclaiming their desire to put everyone in charge of their destiny via personal possession of a nuke. This sounds like Gully Foyle giving PyRe to the masses. The Order of the Atom sounds van Vogtian.\n\nMy look at pre-World War II apocalyptic romans scientifique continues.\n\nEssay: The Frenetic People, Ernest Pérochon, trans. Brian Stableford, 2012.\n\nThe effects of World War One on literature are vast but usually hidden behind metaphors, displaced into other settings. This series is about the overt use of World War One in fantastic fiction. Pérochon’s novel uses the war in both ways.\n\nBorn in 1885, Pérochon saw combat, briefly, in the war. He was conscripted and went to the front but suffered a heart attack there in 1914 and was discharged. Another heart attack would eventually kill him in 1942 but not before he saw more horrors of the twentieth century. He ran afoul of the Vichy government. His only child and her husband joined the French Resistance, but she was imprisoned in Buchenwald though she escaped.\n\nPérochon was not one of those authors who routinely wrote science fiction. This was his sole venture into the genre. His usual stories were about the French poor working the land.\n\nStableford’s “Introduction” notes that the inter-war years saw no shortage in either Britain or France of stories about civilization destroyed in a future war. It seemed entirely plausible that the next war would see chemical, biological, and even atomic weapons delivered to cities via aerial bombardment. These stories tended to be more extreme in French romans scientifique. The Great War had, of course, been fought on French soil. Those French works tended to displace their future war stories more in time than British scientific romances did.\n\nPublished in 1925 as Les Hommes frénétiques, Stableford contends this novel doesn’t quite match the “sheer brutality of its excess” of José Moselli’s Illa’s End, also from 1925. However,\n\nits far greater sophistication and mock-laconic attention to detail renders its account of superscientific warfare even more effective in its horror.\n\nHaving read both novels, I agree.\n\nOur story opens at the Avernine Institute in the fifth century of the Universal Era. Avernine is a great scientist whose work resulted in an energy grid, using the ether, that extends around the world, a work so important that the time is called the Age of Avernine.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: “Crossroads of Destiny”, H. Beam Piper, 1959.\n\nIt’s another alternate history from Piper though not set in his Paratime series. Like Alfred Bester’s “Of Time and Third Avenue”, this story hinges on a numismatic matter. Piper’s story appeared in the July 1959 issue of Fantastic Universe Science Fiction. Bester’s story was published in 1951.\n\nThe narrator is a history professor. He goes to a “club-car” on a train where there are five men seated. There is a Staff Intelligence Army colonel. There’s a sandy haired man about the narrator’s own age and an elderly man who is either a banker or lawyer. Next to him is a plump and “slightly too well groomed” man. Separated from the group is a man reading a book though he seems to be listening to the conversation.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe posts on William Tenn continue while I work on new posts.\n\nScience Fiction Ruminations gives the parallax on this.\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Of All Possible Worlds, William Tenn, 1955.\n\n“Introduction: On the Fiction in Science Fiction” is William Tenn’s defense of science fiction. First, he argues that, contrary to critics, sf is about people as individuals or representatives of a “collective community”. Second, popular art, which sf is, is helpful in attaining aspirations of artistic immortality. He argues that “a scientific error or two” would not mar classic sf. He explicitly mentions Robert A. Heinlein’s Beyond This Horizon, Frederik Pohl’s and Cyril Kornbluth’s The Space Merchants, Ward Moore’s Bring the Jubilee, and Isaac Asimov’s Pebble in the Sky as classics. Responding to the old charge of sf as escapism, Tenn notes that new literary genres, be they novels or Elizabethan plays are always denounced as dangerous by an intellectual elite invested in the old forms. Tenn doubts that people read any fiction to learn more about their “unfulfilled” lives or gain a moral perspective. He thinks that people read fiction for escape, believable escape. Responding to the old and still present charge that sf has produced no Shakespeare, Cervantes, or Fielding, Tenn notes that Elizabethan dramatists produced nothing equivalent to Aeschylus either though it was the standard they were aiming for. Good popular art has a certain primitive vitality and vulgarity, Tenn argues, which causes it to endure longer than boring art polished to the point of perfection.\n\n“Down Among the Dead Men” — This story, like Alfred Bester’s “Disappearing Act” published a year earlier in 1953, is a satire about the Cold War. Essentially both stories depict a society totally mobilized for war – and the qualities of those societies being destroyed in the act of defending them. I use to regard these stories as somewhat liberal whining about fighting the Cold War, but, in learning more about the total mobilization of America in WWII (which, of course, Tenn and Bester would have known first hand) and the encroachments of the government on liberty during that war and since, I appreciate these stories now. Here a decades long war with the alien Eoti has radically changed Earth’s society. Not only are millions dead and all of Earth mobilized, but, in a satirical point derived from the recycling drives of WWII, human soldiers, dead soldiers, are revived as ever increasingly sophisticated “soldier surrogates” or, in popular parlance, zombies. Sexual mores have changed drastically since Earth’s women need to pump out as many babies as possible. The narrator, his reproductive organs wounded – and the wound one of the few that are irreparable, is excluded from these couplings. I’m unsure whether to be glad, at the end, the protagonist as found a purpose and family (albeit a surrogate one) or horrified that familial and human sensibilities have been so distorted or wonder that humans are so adaptable.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe walk through the Night Land continues.\n\nEssay: City at the End of Time, Greg Bear, 2008.\n\nIt isn’t just Greg Bear saying in interviews that this novel was both a homage to William Hope Hodgson’s The Night Land and Arthur C. Clarke’s The City and the Stars or critics guessing that. Hodgson shows up right on page 398, and Bear subsumes the man and his novel into his own creation:\n\n’Like a battlefield,’ said Glaucous. ‘I walked the trenches around Ypres, almost a hundred years ago, looking for a particular gent – a fine strapping fellow and a poet. He dreamed, so I was led to believe, of a place he called the Last Redoubt. He’d written a book before shipping out, detailing his dreams . . . But the war had already blown him to bits. Lean years for hunters, during wartime.’\n\nGlaucous is one such hunter, or, to be exact, he’s a “chancer”, sort of a man who can unconsciously manipulate probabilities to help hunters like Whitlow find “shifters” and “dreamers”. Continue reading →\n\nThe Charles Sheffield series continues with a . . .\n\nRaw Feed (1997): The Mind Pool, Charles Sheffield, 1993.\n\n”Introduction” — Sheffield explains that this is a revision of his 1986 novel The Nimrod Hunt which, he frankly admits, was greatly influenced by Alfred Bester’s The Stars My Destination.\n\nThe Mind Pool — This is Sheffield’s attempt to imitate Alfred Bester’s The Stars My Destination. As he says in his introduction, Sheffield makes no attempt to imitate Bester’s wonderful style and is not capable of doing so. The lack of Bester’s prose style may explain why this story was not particularly engaging when I read it nor memorable.\n\nTo be sure there are plenty of baroque, Bester-like elements though Bester seems to not only show the influence of The Stars My Destination but also Bester’s The Demolished Man. The element of personality disintegration and reconstruction, epitomized by the Demolition of the latter novel, is the major theme. It is echoed in the novel’s end with the fate of two major characters, the brain-damaged Luther Brachis and the catatonic Esra Mondrian, facing possible reconstruction in the Sargasso Dump.\n\nThe submergence of individual personality into the Mind Pool is another example of this as are the alien Tinker Composites. Closely allied to this theme is the idea of personal transcendence a lá Gully Foyle in The Stars My Destination. Chan Dalton experiences this in the Tolkov Stimulator as do the participants of the Mind Pool. Continue reading →"
