        "text": "----------------------------------------------\n\nAlfred Bester did not write many books, but the stuff he wrote in the 50s was so enjoyable and ground-breaking that his influence can be traced in many great works of SF today. \"The Demolished Man\" and \"Tiger! Tiger!\" are both tour-de-force masterpieces, and his short stories are great examples of fast-paced & intelligent entertainment.\n\nAlfred Bester\n\n\"The Stars My Destination\" (nv)\n\n(revised from \"Tiger! Tiger!\")\n\nÂ© Galaxy, Oct 1956\n\nnovel: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1956\n\n--all time novel : 1975 Locus /7\n\n--all time sf novel : 1987 Locus /10\n\n--hall of fame : 1988 Prometheus W\n\n--sf novel : 1998 Locus /6\n\n--/ second place sf novel\n\n--/ wonder award\n\n--/ adventure award\n\n--/ style award\n\nReading Alfred Bester makes me wonder what the definition of a \"genius\" really is. How could one writer so transcend the boundaries of a genre that his fiction reads better than any bestseller today? There are literary talents out there who are excited about writing new and unconventional stuff, but in terms of reader's experience much of their output is often unreadable. And here is this Bester, who \"bested\" all others while writing in the 50s, in the popular market for the ready news-stand consumption - and yet he single-handedly created the cyberpunk genre (before William Gibson made it obvious), and had given the public the taste of what Philip K. Dick fiction would be like in a few years. If his \"The Demolished Man\" (1952) novel burned through the brains of the majority of active thinkers and raised the bar so high for ALL writers that they could only willfully gaze upon it and go smoke another cigarette in despair - then \"The Stars My Destination\" simply blew all the bars and barriers into an open space... telling everyone simply that \"stars\" are indeed Alfred Bester's destination.\n\nAnd yet the writing here is so seemingly effortless, so playfully indifferent - who cares how this novel would be received? - Alfred Bester just smiles and puts in another sci-fi pyrotechnic that readers would adore and writers would emulate (much like the case with the best of Philip K. Dick's fiction). It is weird, however, that this book did not win any major awards, not even a Retro Hugo!.. - so go find the good old 50s paperback copy and nail it to the judges panel (and another copy to a writing workshop's billboard, while you're at it). Alfred Bester knew how to write intelligent AND exciting stuff in the 50s (though the quality of his output slightly declined later), any or all critics be damned.\n\nIt is also with great trepidation that we hear about the movie rights being purchased for this ground-breaking work. More power to them, but I think I'd rather go and re-read the book. \"Tiger! Tiger!\" (the book's original title) still makes for very compelling reading today. Its \"jaunty\" and visual narrative reveals quite a few deeper questions and ideas - for example, an underlying conflict between \"ruthless\" and \"irresistible\" qualities of (superior) intellect, or the discussion of what it means to be a truly liberated individual - any of that could prove to be more intense than the current cinema producers can handle.\n\nRead an excellent review of this novel at Infinity Plus, written by Adam Roberts, who himself writes wonderfully hyper-active and intelligent SF. Plus Wiki has a good summary of the plot.\n\nreview: 07-Sep-07 (read in 1996)\n\nREAD OTHER REVIEWS FOR THIS WRITER\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLabels: Features"
