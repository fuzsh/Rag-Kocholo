        "text": "Alfred Bester (born Dec. 18, 1913, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Oct. 20?, 1987, Doylestown, Pa.) was an innovative American writer of science fiction whose output, though small, was highly influential.\n\nBester attended the University of Pennsylvania (B.A., 1935). From 1939 to 1942 he published 14 short stories in science-fiction magazines; among these early stories was “Hell Is Forever” (1942), which in its fast pacing and obsessive characters anticipated the style of his major novels. He then wrote scenarios for superhero comic books and scripts for radio and television, and he created English-language librettos for operas by Giuseppe Verdi and Modest Moussorgsky. His first novel was the satiric non-science-fiction work Who He? (1953)."
