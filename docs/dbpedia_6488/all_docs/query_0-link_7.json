        "text": "The foundation is the largest owner of the equity certificates of SpareBank 1 Østlandet. Due to its bylaws, the foundation should always own a minimum of 1/3 of the bank’s equity certificates.\n\nAs a competent owner, the foundation will work to ensure that SpareBank 1 Østlandet creates value for the bank’s equity certificate owners. Another important purpose of the foundation is to supply additional equity capital if the need for capital should arise for SpareBank 1 Østlandet in the future.\n\nSparebankstiftelsen Hedmark is a self-owned foundation. People that reside in the region manage the foundation. All of the elected representatives in the foundation live in Hedmark and are depositors with the bank. The Supervisory Board of the foundation mirrors the former Sparebanken Hedmarks’s pool of customers, other interest groups and community interests in connection to the activities of the foundation.\n\nThrough its strategic ownership in the bank, and grants and donations, the Sparebankstiftelsen Hedmark will contribute in developing the region to the benefit of its people and businesses. The ownership stake in SpareBank 1 Østlandet is the basis of the foundation’s activities in and contribution to Hedmark."
