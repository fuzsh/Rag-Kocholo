        "text": "American rapper (born 1971)\n\nFor the song, see Method Man (song). For the film, see Method Man (film).\n\nMusical artist\n\nClifford Smith, Jr.[2] (born March 2, 1971),[3] better known by his stage name Method Man, is an American rapper, record producer, and actor. He is a member of the East Coast hip hop collective Wu-Tang Clan, and is half of the hip hop duo Method Man & Redman. He took his stage name from the 1979 film Method Man.[4] In 1996, Method Man won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\", featuring R&B singer Mary J. Blige, with whom he currently stars in Power Book II: Ghost, a spin-off of Power.\n\nMethod Man has appeared in films such as 187 (1997), Belly (1998), How High (2001), Garden State (2004), The Wackness (2008), Venom (2005), Red Tails (2012), Keanu (2016), and The Cobbler (2014). He and frequent collaborator rapper Redman co-starred on the short-lived Fox television sitcom Method & Red. He has also had recurring roles in three HBO series, as Tug Daniels in Oz, Melvin \"Cheese\" Wagstaff in The Wire, and Rodney in The Deuce.[5] Method Man also appeared in the TBS comedy series The Last O.G..\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn on March 2, 1971, in Hempstead, Long Island,[6][7] Smith divided his childhood between his father's Long Island residence and his mother's home in the Park Hill section of Clifton, Staten Island, locally known as Killa Hill.[8] Growing up in Hempstead, Smith began playing lacrosse at a young age and continues to be a passionate supporter of the sport.[9] He attended New Dorp High School, where he became friends with Remedy.[10] He has two sisters, Terri and Missy.[8]\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\n1992–1996: Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and Tical\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Wu-Tang Clan ascended to hip hop stardom, Method Man was always one of the most visible members of the collective.[11] He was one of only two members to get a solo song on the group's debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan's unusual contract which allowed its members to release albums under any record label.[11] Method Man chose to sign with rap label Def Jam Recordings,[12] although Elektra Records A&R man Dante Ross initially wanted to sign him around the same time Ross signed fellow group member Ol' Dirty Bastard.[13] Method Man's solo debut, Tical (1994), was critically acclaimed and well received, entering the American charts at #4[14] and eventually selling in excess of one million copies.[14] That album featured the hit single \"All I Need\", later remixed featuring Mary J. Blige, which won a Grammy (\"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need\"). During this time Method Man also became close friends with fellow New York City-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G., and was the only guest rapper featured on his debut album Ready to Die. He was also featured on Spice 1's album AmeriKKKa's Nightmare on the track \"Hard 2 Kill\". In 1995, he was also featured on \"Got the Flava\" off Showbiz and A.G.'s album Goodfellas. He also appeared on the Batman Forever soundtrack: his track, The Riddler, produced by RZA included a video with clips from the film. In 1996, Method Man appeared on Tupac Shakur's album All Eyez on Me, on the song \"Got My Mind Made Up\" alongside his rhyme partner Redman, the Dogg Pound and Inspectah Deck, whose verse did not make the released album version, although his nickname \"Rebel INS\" can be heard as the song fades. He was also featured on Redman's 1996 album Muddy Waters on the track \"Do What Ya Feel\".\n\n1997–1998: Wu-Tang Forever and Tical 2000: Judgment Day\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 3, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan released their Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double CD Wu-Tang Forever, the long-awaited follow up to 36 Chambers. The album has sold over 6 million copies to date worldwide.[15]\n\nIn 1996, the movie Space Jam was released. Method Man, alongside LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, B-Real and Coolio released a song from the Space Jam Soundtrack called, Hit 'Em High.[16] Method Man would go on to feature on LL Cool J's, 4,3,2,1 the following year.[17]\n\nHis second solo album was Tical 2000: Judgement Day, released in 1998, which was heavily influenced by the apocalypse theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and featured myriad guest appearances from his fellow Wu-Tang MCs.[18] Other guest appearances include Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, D'Angelo, Chris Rock, Mobb Deep, Redman, and brief cameos from Russell Simmons, Bishop Don \"Magic\" Juan, Janet Jackson, and Donald Trump.[19] Fueled by the party track \"Judgment Day\" and the D'Angelo collaboration \"Break Ups 2 Make Ups\", the album sold better than his debut, earning Platinum certifications in both the U.S. and Canada.[20] Reviews for the album were mixed and its long runtime and abundance of intermittent comedy skits were widely criticized. Producers on this album included True Master, 4th Disciple and the RZA.\n\nIn 1997, the Scottish rock band Texas, found some success with their single, \"Say What You Want\".[21] In 1998, the band collaborated with Method Man and RZA on a remix of the song titled \"Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)\", with RZA producing. It was later included in the Greatest Hits album released by Texas.[22]\n\n1999–2001: Blackout! (with Redman) and WWF Aggression\n\n[edit]\n\nMethod Man was part of the very successful Hard Knock Life Tour with Jay-Z, Redman, Ja Rule, and DMX.[23] During this tour, Method Man & Redman recorded Blackout!,[24] a light-hearted, bass-heavy, profanity-laced, party record with an EPMD-evoking emphasis on funky beats and the mischievous wit and cool flows and good rhythm of the two MCs. The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by \"Da Rockwilder\", \"Cereal Killa\", \"1, 2, 1, 2\", \"Tear It Off\" and \"Y.O.U.\" This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.\n\nTheir success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success were their co-starring roles in the major motion picture film How High, their endorsement deal for Right Guard, Redman's starring role in Seed of Chucky and a short-lived sitcom on Fox Television entitled Method & Red.\n\nIn 1999, Method Man featured on Limp Bizkit's song \"N 2 Gether Now\" from their album Significant Other.\n\nIn 2000, Method Man performed Know Your Role which was included on the album titled, WWF Aggression. The song is focused on the popularity of professional wrestler at the time Dwayne Johnson whose wrestling name was 'The Rock' and the main line in the song is The Rock's most famous caption \"Do you smell what The Rock is cookin'?\".\n\n2001–2004: The W, Iron Flag, and Tical 0: The Prequel\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Wu-Tang Clan released The W on November 21, 2000, and Iron Flag on December 18, 2001. The W received both critical and commercial success for the group,[25] while Iron Flag did receive some but not to the same extent as its predecessor. The efforts earned two more platinum plaques for the Wu-Tang Clan.[26][27]\n\nIn 2003, Method Man criticized Oli \"Power\" Grant and Mitchell \"Divine\" Diggs, the managers of the Wu-Tang Clan business.[28][failed verification] \"Number 1 on my shit list right now is Divine from Wu-Tang management. He took something major from me that he had no intention of giving back.\"[29]\n\nAside from the financial issues, Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world for a brief period of time with Wu-Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. \"When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit.\"[29]\n\nIn 2004, Method Man released his third solo album Tical 0: The Prequel, which featured the hit party single \"What's Happenin'\" with Busta Rhymes and included guest appearances of pop-rap stars like Missy Elliott and P. Diddy. The album sold well and was certified gold record by the RIAA but did not see the platinum success of his previous solo releases.[citation needed]\n\nP. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. \"On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that.\"[30]\n\n2006–2007: 4:21... The Day After\n\n[edit]\n\nMethod Man's fourth album, entitled 4:21: The Day After was released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuring Havoc, Erick Sermon, Scott Storch, Allah Mathematics, Mr. Porter, and, most importantly to Meth, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv.[31] Despite this being one of Meth's strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang member Inspectah Deck, as well as New York up and comers Saigon, and Gat Murdah. Meth cited various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving in to his record label.\n\nIn early May 2007, Method Man's camp leaked the street single \"New York New York\" which became a popular track on the internet.[32]\n\n2007–2010: Blackout! 2\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET's Rap City: Tha Bassment that a sequel to How High was then being written [citation needed].\n\nIn an April 10, 2007, Onion A.V. Club interview,[33] Redman hinted that there would be a second collaborative album with Method Man, with work beginning in midsummer or early September.\n\nIn early 2008, a remake of the Smooth da Hustler and Trigger tha Gambler classic Broken Language was released to the internet by the duo entitled Broken Language 2008,[34] fueling rumors of an upcoming Blackout! sequel. This rumor was further fueled by the duo while performing in Gainesville, Florida, at the University of Florida. Blackout! 2 was scheduled for a December 9, 2008, release but was pushed back to the second quarter of 2009, with a new release date of May 19, 2009.[35] Bun B confirmed that he guested on Blackout! 2.[36] In April 2009, a single was released entitled \"City Lights\",[37] produced by Nasty Kutt. Erick Sermon, Rockwilder and Pete Rock also confirmed their presence on Blackout! 2[citation needed].\n\nThe duo finished their Still High tour with Termanology, The Alchemist, and Evidence of Dilated Peoples[citation needed].\n\n2011–present: The Meth Lab and Crystal Meth\n\n[edit]\n\nCrystal Meth was to be Method Man's fifth and final studio album.[38][39][40] The album has no confirmed release date. The Crystal Meth album was first announced before Method Man began working on his and Redman's second album together, Blackout! 2, at which time it was tentatively titled The Crystal Method. In the liner notes of that album, it was given a scheduled release date of 2009. The album, however, was further postponed until it was later mentioned in an MTV interview that it would be released in early 2010.[38] At a concert on December 23, 2010, Method Man told the crowd to look for his album in March 2011. However, the album was postponed again.\n\nIn an April 2011 interview with The Come Up Show, following a performance in Canada, Method Man replied to a question regarding his \"weed-loving\" image: \"When you get older and you've got kids and your kids are going to school and you know [their] teachers...and they see how active you are and concerned [you are] with your kids' education or well being, it's hard to sit there and be taken seriously if people are always talking about he's always high...which is totally not the case\", he said. \"When I first came out, I was young, we were doing our thing, we smoked a lot...and we didn't care if the world knew. Now, I have to use more discretion because of my kids. This is not for me; everything I do is for them now, so I use a bit more discretion and I don't put weed as a forefront any more.\"[41]\n\nOn October 5, 2011, a new single from Method Man, entitled \"World Gone Sour (The Lost Kids)\", was released on iTunes.[42] In July 2012, he confirmed that the album would come out in 2013 & would be produced by RZA,[43] although he has also stated that RZA would not produce the whole album, but instead be one of a few producers which would also include Erick Sermon, Rockwilder, and some then-younger producers such as Diggilo.[44] He also expressed a desire to work with Odd Future frontman Tyler, The Creator.[45] Throughout 2013, Method Man worked on material for Crystal Meth and on the Wu-Tang Clan's sixth studio album, A Better Tomorrow. He also toured with Redman throughout the year.[46] On January 1, 2014, Method Man announced that a mixtape titled The Meth Lab would be released in March 2014 and that Crystal Meth would be released in August 2014 on Tommy Boy Entertainment.[47] However, Method Man released The Meth Lab as a mixtape album[48][49] through Tommy Boy on August 21, 2015. In 2019 Method Man featured on the record 'Winnebago' with South London rapper Blue Meth. The music video was directed by Nick Donnelly[50]\n\nCrystal Meth was supposedly going to be released in August 2016 but still hasn't been released as of 2024.\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Method Man began a career in acting. He has had recurring roles in critically acclaimed television shows such as HBO's Oz as Tug Daniels,[51] HBO's The Wire as Prop Joe's nephew Cheese,[52] The Twilight Zone, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, in which Method Man portrays Drops, a wealthy Las Vegas party promoter who clashes with the CSI team (specifically investigator Nick Stokes) in their investigations involving Drops' clubs or entourage, in the episodes \"Poppin' Tags\" (2006), \"Big Shots\" (2007), and \"Drops Out\" (2008).[53]\n\nMethod Man and Redman hosted a pilot on MTV called Stung.[54] Additionally, Method Man has made numerous appearances as himself on TV shows such as Mind of Mencia[55] and Chappelle's Show.[citation needed]\n\nHis first prominent role came in with the film Belly (1998), along with fellow rappers Nas and DMX.

I'm trying to keep this show ghetto, and there's a way for it to be both ghetto and intelligent.
