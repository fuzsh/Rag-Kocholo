It is published by Media Business Insight, a British B2B media company.\n\nThe magazine is primarily aimed at those involved in the global film business. The magazine in its current form was founded in 1975,[1] and its website, Screendaily.com, was added in 2001.\n\nScreen International also produces daily publications at film festivals and markets in Berlin, Germany; Cannes, France; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; the American Film Market in Santa Monica, California; and Hong Kong.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nScreen International traces its history back to 1889 with the publication of Optical Magic Lantern and Photographic Enlarger.[2] At the turn of the 20th century, the name changed to Cinematographic Journal and in 1907 it was renamed Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly.\n\nKinematograph Weekly\n\n[edit]\n\nKinematograph and Lantern Weekly contained trade news, advertisements, reviews, exhibition advice, and reports of regional and national meetings of trade organisations such as the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association and the Kinema Renters' Society. It was first published by pioneering film enthusiast, industrialist and printing entrepreneur E. T. Heron. In 1919 it was renamed Kinematograph Weekly which was further shortened in 1959 to Kine Weekly.\n\nThe title was sold to British and American Film Holdings Ltd in September 1971, which merged it with rival film-trade paper Today's Cinema.[3][4] It was later renamed CinemaTV Today.\n\nLaunch of Screen International\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1975, Peter King purchased the struggling CinemaTV Today from Sir John Woolf for £50,000 (equivalent to £530,000 in 2023) and relaunched the publication as Screen International.[3][5] The first issue of Screen International was published on 6 September 1975. King sold the publication in 1989 to the International Thomson Organization.[3]\n\nMany Screen International journalists have gone on to become major industry figures, including Colin Vaines, who ran production for companies such as Miramax and GK Films, and who has produced many award-winning film and television projects.[5]\n\nScreen Daily\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to its print magazine, Screen International maintains Screen Daily, a website providing a real-time view of the film industry.[6]\n\nEditors\n\n[edit]\n\nThe editors of Screen International include:\n\nPeter Noble (1975–79)[5]\n\nQuentin Falk, Editor (1979–1982)[3]\n\nColin Vaines, Co-Editor (1982–83)[5]\n\nAdrian Hodges, Co-Editor (1982–83)[5]\n\nTerry Ilott, Editor (1983–87)\n\nNick Roddick, Editor (1987–88)\n\nOscar Moore (1991–94)[7]\n\nBoyd Farrow, Editor (1995–98)\n\nColin Brown, Editor-in-Chief (1998–2008)\n\nMichael Gubbins, Editor (2004–09)\n\nMike Goodridge, Editor (2009–2012)\n\nWendy Mitchell, Editor (2012–14)\n\nMatt Mueller, Editor (2015–present)\n\nOffices\n\n[edit]\n\nScreen International has offices in London.\n\nIt has a network of more than forty correspondents around the world. It hosts conferences, including the annual European Film Finance Summit in Berlin and the UK Film Finance Conference in London.\n\nOscar Moore Foundation\n\n[edit]\n\nA former editor in chief, Oscar Moore—who was also a columnist for The Guardian and a novelist—died of an AIDS-related illness in 1996. The Oscar Moore Foundation was established in 1997 as a charitable foundation administered by Screen International. The foundation's aim is to foster new European screenwriting talent by awarding an annual prize of £10,000 to the best first draft screenplay in a genre which changes each year. A foundation patron, Emma Thompson, is an actress and screenwriter who has won an Academy Award for both disciplines.\n\nScreen International Stars of Tomorrow\n\n[edit]\n\nScreen International produces an annual list of up and coming international talent, under its Stars of Tomorrow (a.k.a. Screen Stars of Tomorrow) brand. A special edition of the magazine to highlight up-and-coming talent was established in 2004 in the UK. Since 2010, Stars of Tomorrow has been curated by Fionnuala Halligan, who – as of 2023 – is the magazine's executive editor for reviews and new talent.[8]\n\n2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category List 2004 Actors 2005 Actors Producers\n\nAlastair Clark\n\nRachel Robey\n\nMia Bays\n\n2006 Actors 2007 Actors Producers\n\nAnna Higgs\n\nGavin Humphries\n\nWriters\n\nPeter Harness\n\nJesse Lawrence writer-director\n\n2008 Actors 2009 Actors Filmmakers European\n\n2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category List 2010 Actors 2011[9] Filmmakers\n\nRowan Athale\n\nJay Basu\n\nCharles Henri Belleville\n\nSebastian Foster\n\nStefan Georgiou\n\nScott Graham\n\nCorin Hardy\n\nColin Kennedy\n\nFrances Lea\n\nJohn Maclean\n\nRobert McKillop\n\nMichael Pearce\n\nArjun Rose\n\nAdam Wimpenny\n\nActors 2012[10] Actors Filmmakers\n\nJessica and Henrietta Ashworth screenwriters\n\nMahalia Belo writer-director\n\nFyzal Boulifa writer-director\n\nDominic Buchanan producer\n\nHenry Darke writer-director\n\nStuart Earl composer\n\nRuth Fowler writer\n\nMustapha Kseibati writer-director\n\nAnnemarie Lean-Vercoe cinematographer\n\nDavid Leon actor-writer-director\n\nWilliam McGregor writer-director\n\nJamie Stone writer-director\n\nKibwe Tavares writer-director\n\nDaniel Wolfe writer-director\n\n2013 Actors 2014 Actors Filmmakers[11]\n\nMichael Berliner\n\nSarah Brocklehurst\n\nKeri Collins\n\nDaniel Fajemisin-Duncan and Marlon Smith\n\nChris Foggin\n\nAneil Karia\n\nDawn King\n\nLynsey Miller\n\nRoberto Oliveri\n\nSimon Stephenson\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\n\nKrysty Wilson-Cairns\n\n2015 Actors Filmmakers\n\nBen Aston\n\nFarhana Bhula\n\nAndy Brunskill\n\nCharlie Covell\n\nMarnie Dickens\n\nDaniel Emmerson\n\nRick Galazka\n\nAleem Khan\n\nDan Kokotajlo\n\nEmily Morgan\n\nMatthew Orton\n\nNick Rowland\n\nOscar Sharp\n\nRachna Suri\n\nJorn Threlfall\n\nJoy Wilkinson\n\n2016 Actors Filmmakers\n\nYaw Basoah\n\nFodhla Cronin O'Reilly\n\nToby Fell-Holden\n\nKate Herron\n\nBrady Hood\n\nMelissa Iqbal\n\nBilly Lumby\n\nJoe Murtagh\n\nEva Riley\n\nLen Rowles\n\nChris Urch\n\nRob Watson\n\nSam Yates\n\n2017[12] Actors Filmmakers\n\nFarah Abushwesha\n\nAnwar Boulifa\n\nLoran Dunn\n\nEd Lilly\n\nNathaniel Martello-White\n\nSarmad Masud\n\nHarry Michell\n\nRungano Nyoni\n\nRubika Shah\n\nRory Alexander Stewart\n\nRemi Weekes\n\nLeanne Welham\n\nKat Wood\n\n2018[13] Actors Filmmakers\n\nKoby Adom\n\nBaff Akita\n\nAmrou Al-Kadhi\n\nAmeenah Ayub Allen\n\nPrano Bailey-Bond\n\nGabriel Bisset-Smith\n\nAnna Blandford\n\nHania Elkington\n\nRose Glass\n\nAnna Griffin\n\nMoin Hussain\n\nJohnny Kenton\n\nHarry Lighton\n\nHelen Simmons\n\n2019[14] Actors Filmmakers\n\nChris Andrews\n\nBenjamin Bee\n\nDionne Edwards\n\nFiona Lamptey\n\nNadia Latif\n\nPhillip Morgan\n\nClaire Oakley\n\nRapman\n\nAlice Seabright\n\n2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category List 2020[15] Actors Filmmakers\n\nRienkje Attoh (producer)\n\nAkinola Davies Jr (writer-director)\n\nColum Eastwood (writer-director)\n\nJoy Gharoro-Akpojotor (producer)\n\nElla Glendining (writer-director-actor)\n\nMatilda Ibini (writer)\n\nNaqqash Khalid (writer-director)\n\nDeclan Lawn, Adam Patterson (writer-directors)\n\nCourttia Newland (writer)\n\nJayisha Patel (writer-director)\n\nCharlotte Regan (writer-director)\n\nTom Wood (producer)\n\n2021 Actors Filmmakers Actors and filmmakers Heads of department\n\nHeather Basten\n\nOlan Collardy\n\nGini Godwin\n\nGrace Snell\n\nClaire Anne Williams\n\n2022 Actors Filmmakers Heads of department 2023 Actors Filmmakers Actors and filmmakers 2024 Actors Filmmakers Actors and filmmakers\n\nCompetition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe magazine's international competitors include its American counterparts Variety,The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of film periodicals\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
