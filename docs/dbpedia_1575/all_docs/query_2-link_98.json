He is best known for his leading role as budding author John-Boy Walton in the CBS drama series The Waltons for which he won an Emmy Award.[2] He also received another Emmy nomination and two Golden Globe Award nominations for that role.[3]\n\nThomas later starred as Bill Denbrough in the 1990 television miniseries adaptation of Stephen King's epic horror novel It, and played Special Agent Frank Gaad on FX's spy thriller series The Americans. More recently, he appeared in Netflix's Ozark and is touring with To Kill a Mockingbird as Atticus Finch.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nThomas was born on June 13, 1951, in Manhattan, the son of Barbara Fallis and Richard S. Thomas. His parents were dancers with the New York City Ballet and owned the New York School of Ballet.[4]\n\nThomas has a birthmark on his left cheek. He has stated that this led to his being turned down for a role in a television commercial in his youth.[5]\n\nThomas was educated at two private day schools for boys, first at Allen-Stevenson School,[1] and then at the now-defunct McBurney School, both in his home district of Manhattan, New York City.\n\nHe was a student at Columbia College, the undergraduate college of Columbia University, where he majored in Chinese before switching to the English department.[6] After he landed the role in The Waltons, he left Columbia during his junior year because he had to commit to the role full-time in Los Angeles.[7][8]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1958, at age seven, Thomas made his Broadway debut in Sunrise at Campobello.[4] In 1959, he appeared in the Hallmark Hall of Fame NBC television presentation of Ibsen's A Doll's House with Julie Harris, Christopher Plummer, and Hume Cronyn.[9] He then began acting in daytime TV, appearing in soap operas such as The Edge of Night (as Ben Schultz, 1961), A Flame in the Wind and As the World Turns (as Tom Hughes, 1966–67) which were broadcast from his native Manhattan.
