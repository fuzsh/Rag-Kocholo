The DYK section showcases new or expanded articles that are selected through an informal review process. It is not a general trivia section. The choice of articles is subject to a set of criteria that are set out on this page.\n\nThe other sections of changeable content on the Main Page are coordinated at In the news, Picture of the day, Selected anniversaries, Today's featured list (currently Mondays and Fridays), and Today's featured article. More general discussion of the main page takes place at Talk:Main Page, and errors are reported at Wikipedia:Main Page/Errors.\n\nWikipedia's goal is to build and maintain an encyclopedia covering all branches of human knowledge. Hundreds of new articles are created and many more expanded each day on the English Wikipedia. DYK showcases new and improved content by presenting a series of facts (\"hooks\"), some of them accompanied by images, which link to selected articles. The hooks appear for a limited period in the \"Did you know...?\" box on the Main Page. Editors whose articles appear in DYK will receive an acknowledgement on their user talk pages. The choice of articles is subject to a series of criteria (see DYK rules below). Editors may nominate their own or someone else's work for a DYK appearance.\n\nDYK aims to achieve the following five goals:\n\nTo showcase new and improved content, illustrating to readers the continuous improvement and expansion of Wikipedia's corpus of articles;\n\nTo highlight the variety of information on Wikipedia, thereby providing an insight into the range of material that Wikipedia covers.\n\nTo present facts about a range of topics which may not necessarily otherwise receive Main Page exposure;\n\nTo acknowledge the work that editors do to expand and improve Wikipedia, encouraging them to continue their efforts and thereby contributing to editor retention and ongoing content improvement;\n\nTo encourage readers to edit articles that appear on DYK or start their own, thus facilitating the recruitment of new editors.\n\nDYK is not:\n\nA smaller-scale version of either featured content or good articles, though selected good articles do appear in the DYK box. Articles must meet the basic criteria set out on this page but do not have to be of very high quality. As DYK's main purpose is to showcase new and improved content, it is not expected that articles appearing on DYK would be considered among the best on Wikipedia.\n\nA collection of general trivia. The articles featured are specifically new and improved ones which meet the criteria set out below.\n\nA means of advertising, or of promoting commercial or political causes. While it is fine to cover topics of commercial or political interest, DYK must not provide inappropriate advantage for such causes (e.g. during election campaigns or product launches).\n\nDYK consists of a series of \"hooks\", which are interesting facts taken from Wikipedia's newest content, of the format \"Did you know that...?\" Thus, to nominate something to appear on DYK, an editor must either write or identify new content (see below for what qualifies as \"new\") and propose an interesting hook. Any registered user who is at least autoconfirmed may nominate a DYK suggestion; self-nominations are encouraged. To make a nomination, submit it here.\n\nFour basic criteria are used to determine whether a nomination is eligible for DYK, together with a review requirement. Wikipedia:Did you know/Guidelines outlines all of the criteria that need to be met, but all DYK submissions must broadly meet these key points:\n\nNew – At the time of nomination, an article must be considered new, which means it was created, expanded fivefold, or promoted to good article status in the seven days preceding a nomination.\n\nLong enough – The article must be at least 1500 characters of original prose, which includes only raw text and does not include markup.\n\nCited hook – The facts of the hook need to appear in the article with a citation no later than at the end of the sentences in which they appear.\n\nWithin policy – Articles for DYK must conform to Wikipedia's most important content policies, which include Wikipedia:Verifiability, Wikipedia:Copyright violations, and Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons.\n\nReview requirement (QPQ) – If you have nominated five or more articles in the past, you must review one other nomination (unrelated to you) for every subsequent article you nominate‍—‌this is called quid pro quo or QPQ.\n\nRules (WP:DYKCRIT) – how DYK works\n\nDYK talk (WT:DYK) – for general discussion of the project\n\nIncludes issues with current or past nominations which may need wider discussion than on the corresponding nomination page (in which case add a note to the nomination page).\n\nNominations (T:TDYK) – where nominations are proposed and discussed\n\nThe nomination is checked against DYK criteria; reviewers may also suggest improvements or alternatives to the hook.\n\nBot generated list of promising new articles, a source for potential nominations\n\nPreps and queues (T:DYK/Q)\n\nPrep areas – where hook \"sets\" are assembled and finalized – See How to promote a hook.\n\nQueues – to which finalized hook sets are moved from \"prep\" by an administrator, and where they wait to be moved (by a bot) to the Main Page – The admin moving the hooks to the live template may edit or reject any hook at their discretion.\n\nRotation – if we are at one set per day and immediately after the midnight (UTC) update finishes there are more than 120 approved nominations while at least ten prep/queue sets are filled, we rotate to two sets per day. If we are at two sets per day and immediately after a midnight (UTC) update there are fewer than 60 approved nominations or fewer than six filled prep/queue sets, we rotate to one set per day.[1] The approved nominations page (WP:DYKNA) has a maximum size limit, so it will sometimes not display or count the latest nominations.\n\nDid you know... template (T:DYK) – the hooks currently appearing on the main page; DYKUpdateBot moves sets here from the Queue area according to a schedule.[a]\n\nOld DYK entries are archived at Wikipedia:Recent additions after they leave the main page.\n\nErrors (WP:ERRORS) – to report concerns about DYK items currently or shortly to be on the main page. If necessary an admin may edit or replace a hook on main page by changing the DYK template.\n\nIf a factual error is reported when the hooks are on the front page, try to replace the hook with another fact from the article, rather than just removing it.\n\nIf it is the first hook and hence has an associated picture, you must replace it with another hook with a picture.\n\nAny editor may volunteer and assist with DYK, simply by contributing to the department operations.\n\n(Edit this list)\n\nThe following admins are (or would like to be) actively involved in the DYK process.\n\nAoidh\n\nBorgQueen\n\nCasliber\n\nCwmhiraeth\n\nDaniel Case\n\nGatoclass\n\nGanesha811\n\nI JethroBT\n\nIsabelle Belato\n\nKusma\n\nMifter\n\nLee Vilenski\n\nONUnicorn\n\nRoySmith\n\nSchwede66\n\ntheleekycauldron\n\nWaggers\n\nZ1720\n\nThe following admins are not actively involved, but are willing to lend a hand if needed.\n\n28bytes\n\nBerig\n\nBD2412 - I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.\n\nComplexRational Happy to provide a second opinion or promote a prep to queue as needed.\n\nGraeme Bartlett I have helped out in the past\n\nHJ Mitchell - active around ITN and WP:ERRORS but happy to help if needed.\n\nJuliancolton\n\nKing of Hearts - King_of_Hearts on IRC\n\nKingturtle - If you ever need help proofreading, copyediting, paraphrasing or checking sources, just post a note on my talk page.\n\nKTC\n\nMailer diablo (whenever there's backlog)\n\nNick-D Happy to help if asked - including fixing hooks while they're on the main page.\n\nOrlady\n\nRlendog\n\nSamir (was active in maintaining DYK in 2006, happy to help out anytime)\n\nShubinator\n\nSoWhy - Whenever asked/needed or if I notice that it's needed :-)\n\nStifle - If I'm around, feel free to ask.
