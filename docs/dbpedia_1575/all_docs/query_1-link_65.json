Ava and Sara rekindle their relationship. Constantine tries to warn Sara about the darkness coming, but Sara dismisses him. The Legends end up at Woodstock, where they see a unicorn impale a woman and eat her heart. It then releases magical goo at every Legend minus Sara, making them hallucinate. Realizing he was right, Sara locates Constantine and informs him of the situation. Constantine cures the affected Legends and sends the unicorn to Hell with a spell, using Gary, who loses a nipple in the process, as bait. Meanwhile, Nate and Rory go on an adventure, leading to Nate attempting to reconnect with his distant father Hank. Back at his accommodations, Constantine experiences a dark form of magic throwing him about the place before it writes in blood that it is coming for him.\n\n532\"Witch Hunt\"Kevin MockKeto Shimizu & Matthew MaalaOctober 29, 2018 ( )T13.210520.94[5]\n\nThe Legends wire up the magical detection bones into the Waverider to allow them to track magical fugitives. Constantine joins the Legends as a magical consultant, with their first mission leading them to the Salem Witch Trials. When an innocent woman is accused of witchcraft, her daughter's Fairy Godmother attacks the townsfolk. Zari fights to save the mother, who was executed in the original timeline, while Constantine and the Legends try to separate the daughter and the Fairy Godmother so Constantine can banish her to Hell. However, the Fairy Godmother turns Ray and Mick into pigs and seals Constantine's mouth shut but, when the daughter releases her, the Legends return to normal. Constantine offers the Fairy Godmother the chance to avoid Hell by becoming her new magical conduit, but she refuses, stating that she knows who is after Constantine and would rather go to Hell than anger him. Nate discovers his father is overseeing the committee that funds the Time Bureau and struggles to prove that magic is real to keep the Bureau funded. He is able to do so when Ray turns back to normal in his arms. Ava offers Nate a place at the Bureau and he accepts.\n\n543\"Dancing Queen\"Kristin WindellJames Eagan & Morgan FaustNovember 5, 2018 ( )T13.210530.86[6]\n\nThe team tracks another magical fugitive to London, where a new punk rock band called \"The Smell\" is favored by the Queen. Constantine hypothesizes that the fugitive is a leprechaun and is posing as a member of the band. The team attempts to scope out the band, with Ray earning their trust by stealing one of the Queen's prized corgis, and discovers that, instead of a leprechaun, the fugitive turns out to be a shapeshifter and the band's lead singer, Charlie. Fearing imprisonment, Charlie knocks Ray unconscious (despite him preparing to defend her) and steals his A.T.O.M. suit, using it to try and kill Sara, Zari, Mick, and Constantine when they attempt to catch her and banish her to Hell. Eventually, Ray wakes up and saves the group by deactivating his suit via voice command, leading to Charlie's capture. However as Constantine attempts to banish her, she shapeshifts to resemble each of them, ending with Amaya; she calls them out for not acting like heroes, instilling a sense of sympathy in Zari. Out of annoyance, Constantine casts a spell that renders Charlie unable to shapeshift ever again, leaving her trapped in Amaya's form. They decide to keep her as prisoner on board the Waverider.\n\n554\"Wet Hot American Bummer\"David GeddesRay Utarnachitt & Tyron B. CarterNovember 12, 2018 ( )T13.210540.90[7]\n\nAva briefly joins the team to help with an investigation into kids disappearing at a summer camp in 1995. The team poses as camp counselors while they track down a swamp creature that has been kidnapping the kids. Ava and Sara take a potion that turns them into children in an attempt to lure out the creature. Charlie attempts to escape the Waverider, but is stopped and comforted by Mick. The team is able to locate the monster, known as a Shtriga, and its victims. John uses a spell to banish the Shtriga, but one of the kids remains unresponsive. John uses another spell to give some of his own life force to the child, healing and reviving the child but leaving John close to death. Ray and John are subsequently rescued by the campers. Charlie agrees to help the Legends, officially joining the team, on the condition that they do not lock her up again. Gideon cannot save Constantine, but Ray claims to know someone who might. Nora Darhk is revealed to be working at a Renaissance Faire.\n\n565\"Tagumo Attacks!!!\"Alexandra La RocheKeto Shimizu & Ubah MohamedNovember 19, 2018 ( )T13.210550.91[8]\n\nWith Constantine still at death's door, Sara has Gideon look for Nora Darhk in 2018, with Gideon quickly finding a match. Ray goes to find her at a Renaissance Faire to ask for her help in saving Constantine. Nora agrees and is able to use her magic to heal him. Ray tells her to run and not to tell them where she went, but Nora uses the time stone to travel to the Time Bureau, wishing to repent for her actions. The other Legends, meanwhile, investigate a fugitive in 1950s Tokyo, discovered to be a giant octopus creature that has appeared on a film set. The creature, Tagumo, was brought to life by a magical book which used the imagination of filmmaker Ishirō Honda. Sara and Charlie manage to partially shrink it, but Tagumo still attacks the set. Mick uses the book and his own imagination to create a heroine named Garima that battles Tagumo, eventually defeating it. The Legends confiscate the book. The fugitives almost escape the Bureau, but Nate and Gary manage to find a way to contain them with food. Ava joins the Heywood family for Thanksgiving. In secret, Hank tells someone the fugitives are controllable and gives them permission to execute \"Project Hades.\"\n\n576\"Tender Is the Nate\"Dean ChoePhil Klemmer & Matthew MaalaNovember 26, 2018 ( )T13.210560.97[9]\n\nNate invites Hank to the Waverider and gives him a tour of the ship. The Legends attempt to keep Nate from Charlie, because she looks like Amaya, but fail. The Waverider detects a fugitive in Paris, 1927. Ray visits the Bureau in an attempt to see Nora, but Ava rejects the visitation, although Time Bureau employee Mona sneaks in a letter to Nora from Ray. Nora refuses to read the letter and triggers her cell alarm. This grabs Ava's attention, who tries to restrain Nora, but they end up getting locked in the prison cell. The Legends are joined by Ernest Hemingway to hunt for the fugitive, who appears to be a Minotaur. During the fight with the Minotaur, Hank is injured. Nate and Constantine calm the Minotaur down, but Hemingway attacks it, angering the Minotaur. Nate confronts the Minotaur, who bypasses his Steel powers. Hank picks up a guitar and sings the Minotaur to sleep. Meanwhile, Ray rescues Mona, Ava, and Nora. Ava sees humanity in the prisoners, thanks to Mona. Nate officially leaves the Legends team.\n\n587\"Hell No, Dolly!\"April MullenGrainne Godfree & Morgan FaustDecember 3, 2018 ( )T13.210570.93[10]\n\nThe Legends travel to New Orleans in 1856 to track down a fugitive related to a series of murders. Sara, Ava, Ray, and Mick head off to find the fugitive, while John, Zari, and Charlie scope out the local area. Constantine has a history with the city, where his former lover Desmond made a deal with the demon Neron to protect him and was subsequently sentenced to Hell. The team manages to hunt down the serial killer Mike the Spike, but his consciousness is transferred into the Martin Stein puppet, which stalks the team. Meanwhile, a group of unidentified men attempt to kidnap a Kaupe creature named Konane from the Time Bureau. Mona interferes and helps Konane escape, but is scratched by him in the process. Constantine travels back to 2018 and changes history so that Desmond does not fall in love with him, but this causes a time wave, freezing the Legends aboard the Waverider, breaking the lock on Charlie's shapeshifting abilities, and transforming Zari into a cat.\n\n598\"Legends of To-Meow-Meow\"Ben BrayJames Eagan & Ray UtarnachittDecember 10, 2018 ( )T13.210581.10[11]\n\nIn the new timeline, Constantine never joins the Legends and, as a result, Sara is killed by the unicorn at Woodstock, leading to Mick, Nate, and Ray forming a new, violent version of the Legends called \"Custodians of the Chronology.\" Charlie breaks Constantine out of the Time Bureau and together they return to Woodstock and kill the unicorn. Upon returning to 2018, they discover that Mick, Nate, and Ray have been killed by the Fairy Godmother, while Sara, Ava, and Gideon have formed \"Sirens of Space-Time.\" Another attempt to fix this sees Mick bond with the Fairy Godmother to begin a new criminal career while Sara, Ray, and Nate are now the \"Puppets of Tomorrow.\" After several more failed attempts to fix the timeline result in various other Legends or their allies being killed in increasingly bizarre ways, the restored Zari convinces Constantine to return to New Orleans and restore the original timeline with Desmond. Constantine tells his story to Sara, who agrees to help him battle Neron. Hank is shown golfing with a creature wearing Desmond's face.\n\n609\"Lucha de Apuestas\"Andrew KaschKeto Shimizu & Tyron B. CarterApril 1, 2019 ( )T13.210590.92[12]\n\nMona is blamed for Konane's escape and fired from the Time Bureau. She evades a mindwiping, meets Konane, and sends him back in time to before he was captured by the Legends. Nate and Zari look into the footage of Konane's escape and find it has been altered by Hank. They recover the original footage from Hank's phone, confirming Mona's version of events. Nate confronts his father, pretending to be on his side. Meanwhile, the rest of the Legends find Konane in 1961 Mexico City working as a professional wrestler named \"El Lobo,\" having overshadowed another wrestler named \"El Cura.\" In order to preserve the timeline, they plan to have El Lobo lose to El Cura in a Lucha de Apuestas. Sara confronts Ava about Nate and Zari's suspicions, but she does not believe her and has her team go after Konane. In 1961, El Cura reclaims his old glory by helping the Legends stop the Time Bureau from capturing Konane. Ava breaks up with Sara. Mona is preparing to send Konane back to his time when a Time Bureau agent finds them and shoots Konane dead. An enraged Mona turns into a Kaupe and kills the agent before turning back into a human.\n\n6110\"The Getaway\"Viet NguyenMatthew Maala & Ubah MohamedApril 8, 2019 ( )T13.210600.95[13]\n\nWith Ava on leave, Hank assumes Time Bureau directorship and tries to apprehend the Legends. Nate and Zari feign working with him, but secretly help the Legends escape. In 1973, the Legends, while on the run with Mona, remove a roach, an agent of Ma'at, from Richard Nixon that has left him unable to lie. The roach enters Sara, who blames her breakup with Ava on Mona, causing her to run away. Sara and Constantine follow her and, after a battle with her \"Wolfie\" form, calm her down, making her part of the Legends. Meanwhile, Gary and Nora are brought in on Nate and Zari's conspiracy. They hack Hank's email, but are interrupted by \"Desmond,\" who informs Hank. Hank realizes Nate has deceived him and uses him to capture the rest of the Legends. The roach enters Nate, who confronts Hank about his feelings, leading to Hank promising to trust the Legends henceforth. At the Bureau, Hank attempts to sever ties with \"Desmond,\" who responds by killing him. In her cell, Nora senses the danger, breaks out, and rushes to Hank. Nate enters the room, finding Nora kneeling over his dead father. She tries to explain herself before using her powers to escape.\n\n6211\"Séance and Sensibility\"Alexandra La RocheGrainne Godfree & Jackie CaninoApril 15, 2019 ( )T13.210610.98[14]\n\nThe Legends are at Hank's wake when they get an alert that a magical creature has gone after Jane Austen. The women travel to 1802 and attend a wedding where everyone goes crazy with lust. Zari captures Sanjay, who can cause love and lust with Hindu god Kamadeva's ashes, but fails to fix the anachronism. Ray hides Nora onboard the Waverider after she proclaims her innocence in Hank's death. Sanjay uses the ashes to give the Waverider crew intimate dreams. Mona dreams about Konane and gets into a fight with Zari over their differing views on romance. She turns into Wolfie and goes after Austen for making her a romantic, while Zari takes another dose of Sanjay's ashes and captivates Charlie and Sara. Austen talks Mona out of losing control and she rushes to stop Zari from marrying Sanjay. Meanwhile, at the wake, Nate is initially upset with his father and plans to expose him, but later discovers that he was not torturing the magical creatures, but was training them for a theme park Nate had drawn when he was nine. Constantine senses Hank's spirit and pulls it into Mick's body. Hank tells Constantine he has been working with Neron, who then appears, taunting Constantine.\n\n6312\"The Eggplant, the Witch & the Wardrobe\"Mairzee AlmasMorgan Faust & Daphne MilesApril 22, 2019 ( )T13.210620.85[15]\n\nNate and Ray locate Hank's theme park construction site. Initially wanting the site torn down, Nate eventually changes his mind and has construction continue. The rest of the team discovers Ava has been abducted by Neron. Using Nora's connection to the demon, they track Ava and find her unresponsive. Constantine believes Neron is preparing Ava as his new vessel and agrees to send Sara to reclaim her soul from her personal Purgatory, which takes the form of a supermarket with Ava products. Ava and Sara solve their relationship issues and find a way out. Meanwhile, Charlie, Constantine, and Nora ambush Neron and capture him. Neron tempts Nora with reviving her father if she agrees to become his new vessel, while also revealing he needs a second vessel for someone called Tabitha. Nora seemingly agrees but, when Neron leaves Desmond's body, he is trapped by Nora and Constantine. However, Constantine loses focus when a concerned Ray rushes to the scene, leading to Neron and Nora zapping each other before the former disappears, leaving the latter unresponsive. Desmond wakes up, but leaves Constantine, upset about being sent to Hell. While Constantine believes Neron is dead, the demon is actually now inside Ray.\n\n6413\"Egg MacGuffin\"Chris TammaroJames Eagan & Tyron B. CarterApril 29, 2019 ( )T13.210630.91[16]\n\nSara tries to get Nate and Zari romantically involved by having them go after a fugitive in 1933. They infiltrate the Adventurers' Society, where Gordon Gilchrist reveals his discovery of a golden egg. After Nazis show up looking for the egg, Ava and Sara join the mission, capture the egg, and bring it onboard the Waverider, where it is revealed as a dragon egg. Meanwhile, Ray discovers Neron is inside him and tries to resist his control. Neron looks to seal the possession by having Ray murder a loved one, first targeting Nora and then Nate. Constantine uses a spell to awaken Nora, who reveals that Neron controls Ray. Neron gains full control of Ray when he offers to stop resisting to save Nate's life. Gary, feeling unappreciated by both the Legends and the Time Bureau, accepts his nipple back from Neron and falls under his control. He and Ray teleport away, taking Constantine with them. Ava recruits Nora as part of the Time Bureau to help take down Neron.\n\n6514\"Nip/Stuck\"David A. GeddesRay Utarnachitt & Matthew MaalaMay 6, 2019 ( )T13.210640.94[17]\n\nNeron threatens to kill Ray unless Constantine opens a portal to hell for Tabitha. The Legends track Constantine to the ice age, but are trapped in an avalanche, while Neron and Constantine relocate to 55 BC Stonehenge to meet John's ancestor King Kon-sten-tyn, a mage responsible for the rift between humans and magical creatures. Constantine confronts his ancestor for threatening to send an innocent Púca to Hell and tries to enlist his help against Neron, but the king has him apprehended for practicing dark arts. The king opens a portal to Hell, which Constantine stabilizes to save the Púca. The Legends work together to break free from the ice and travel to Stonehenge in time to stop Constantine from killing Neron and condemning Ray to an eternity in Hell. Constantine decides to save Ray and enters the portal, which Neron then uses to bring out Tabitha, revealed as the Fairy Godmother. Meanwhile, Gary uses his nipple's hypnotizing powers to take over the Time Bureau. Mona turns into Wolfie and bites the nipple off before Neron and Tabitha arrive. Tabitha turns Wolfie back into Mona, whom she, Neron, and Gary then kidnap. Nora chases after them while Ava alerts the Legends.\n\n6615\"Terms of Service\"April MullenGrainne Godfree & Ubah MohamedMay 13, 2019 ( )T13.210650.99[18]\n\nThe Legends' attempt to reclaim the Time Bureau is interrupted when Tabitha begins granting Gary's wishes, occupying Ava, Mick, Nate, and Sara. Neron launches a phone app to track magical creatures, using Mona to publicly prove their existence. Charlie and Zari discover that anyone who downloads the app surrenders their soul to Neron. After regrouping at Zari's childhood home, they infiltrate the Time Bureau to save the magical creatures that Neron plans to use to create buzz for his app. The creatures are saved, but Charlie is captured. Tabitha is freed from having to obey Gary when she tricks Nora into becoming the new fairy godmother. Gary accepts the Legends' apologies and sends his fairy godmother, not realizing it is now Nora, to Hell to save Constantine and Ray. Meanwhile, Constantine discovers Neron is attempting to take over Hell. He seeks out the Triumvirate and offers to stop Neron from usurping them in exchange for the souls of Astra and Ray. Having to choose between the two, Constantine chooses Astra. However, Astra, having grown up in Hell, turns him down and leaves him to be tortured. Meanwhile, the dragon egg, accidentally left in Zari's home, hatches in young Zari's possession.\n\n6716\"Hey, World!\"Kevin MockPhil Klemmer & Keto ShimizuMay 20, 2019 ( )T13.210661.05[19]"
