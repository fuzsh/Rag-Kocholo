        "text": "American musician\n\nThis article is about the rock musician. For the politician and university administrator, see Janet Napolitano.\n\nMusical artist\n\nJohnette Napolitano (born Jonette L. Napolitano; September 22, 1957)[2] is an American musician best known as the lead vocalist, songwriter, and bassist for the alternative rock group Concrete Blonde.[3]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnette Napolitano was born and raised in Los Angeles, the eldest of five children[4] in an Italian American family.[5][6]\n\nHer parents recognized their daughter possessed musical talent when, as a child, she was able to play \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" on piano by ear.[5] Her mother loved show tunes.[5] The family also listened to Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and the Rat Pack.[5] At age five she enrolled in a gifted kids art program at UCLA.[7]\n\nConcrete Blonde\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Concrete Blonde\n\nIn 1986, Napolitano co-founded Concrete Blonde with guitarist James Mankey. She sang and sometimes played bass guitar. The pair had worked together under a variety of names since 1982. They released seven studio albums between 1986 and 2004, and one additional album as a collaboration with Los Illegals. Concrete Blonde had several moderately successful singles, including \"God is a Bullet\", \"Joey\", \"Tomorrow Wendy\", and a version of \"Everybody Knows\" originally by Leonard Cohen.\n\nConcrete Blonde broke up and reformed several times, with Napolitano and Mankey as the only constant members. The band has not been active since 2012.\n\nSolo career\n\n[edit]\n\nShe has recorded as a solo artist, with the albums Sketchbook (2002), Sketchbook 2 (2006), Scarred (2007), and Sketchbook 3 (2010). Napolitano also recorded a solo album titled Sound of a Woman around 1996–1997, and performed many of the songs on a solo tour opening for Paul Weller.[8] The album was set to be released on IRS (a subdivision of Island Records), the label of her old band, Concrete Blonde. 1997–1998 was a bad time for Island, starting with the sudden departure of founder-CEO Chris Blackwell and ending with the total reorganization of the label. Sound of a Woman was, effectively, lost in the shuffle, and at this point is unlikely to ever be officially released. Bootleg copies of this album are rare and highly valued.[citation needed]\n\nBefore Concrete Blonde, Napolitano was a member of Dream 6, who released their self-titled debut EP in 1983.\n\nIn addition to Concrete Blonde, Napolitano was involved with several musical projects including Vowel Movement, a semi-improvisational musical collaboration with Holly Beth Vincent; and Pretty & Twisted, a band that also featured former Wall of Voodoo guitarist Marc Moreland.\n\nShe is one of several vocalists featured on the 1996 album No Talking, Just Head, by The Heads, including the single \"Damage I've Done\". The group was formed by three members of Talking Heads (Jerry Harrison, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth). Napolitano was the primary vocalist for The Head's only concert tour. The Heads was originally intended to become a full-time band, with further studio albums and tours. A live CD-video of the first tour was planned, featuring performances from many of the album's guest artists and Napolitano on vocals for the songs originally recorded by Talking Heads. David Byrne sued the band, saying their name and presentation was too evocative of Talking Heads. The suit was settled out of court, and The Heads ceased activity.[9][10]\n\nAs of 2009, Napolitano lived in Joshua Tree, California.[11] She composes music for films and works as a gallery artist, specializing in working with discarded and reclaimed materials. She also cares for rescue horses.[12]\n\nNon-Concrete Blonde discography\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnette Napolitano and Holly Vincent Vowel Movement (1995, Mammoth Records)\n\nPretty & Twisted (1995, Warner Bros.
