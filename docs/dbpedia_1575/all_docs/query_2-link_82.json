        "text": "American singer and actress (born 1989)\n\nThis article is about the singer. For the singer's self-titled album, see Jordin Sparks (album).\n\nMusical artist\n\nJordin Sparks (born December 22, 1989)[1] is an American singer and actress. She rose to fame in 2007 after winning the sixth season of American Idol at age 17, becoming the youngest winner in the series' history. Her self-titled debut studio album (2007) was met with critical and commercial success; it peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200, received platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and sold over two million copies worldwide.[2] The album was supported by the Billboard Hot 100-top ten singles \"Tattoo\" and \"No Air\" (with Chris Brown)—the latter received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and remains the third highest-selling song by an American Idol contestant—with three million digital copies sold in the United States.[3][4]\n\nSparks's second studio album, Battlefield (2009) saw further success and debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200. Its lead single of the same name reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and made Sparks the only American Idol contestant to have their first five singles peak within the top 20 of the chart.[5] After a five-year absence from music, she signed with Salaam Remi's record label Louder Than Life, an imprint of Sony Music to release her debut mixtape, #ByeFelicia (2014).[6] Her third studio album, Right Here Right Now (2015), was met with continued critical praise despite a steep commercial decline.\n\nThroughout her career, Sparks has received numerous accolades, including an NAACP Image Award, a BET Award, an American Music Award, a People's Choice Award and two Teen Choice Awards. In 2009, Billboard magazine ranked her as the 91st Artist of the 2000s Decade.[7] In 2012, Sparks was ranked at number 92 on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\".[8] As of February 2012, she has sold 1.3 million albums and 10.2 million singles in the United States alone, making her one of the most successful American Idol contestants of all time.[9] Following the release of Battlefield, Sparks ventured into acting, pursuing television and Broadway. She made her stage debut as Nina Rosario in the musical In The Heights (2010), and her feature film debut as the titular character in Sparkle (2012). Sparks has also released several perfumes, including Because of You... in 2010 as well as Fascinate and Ambition in 2012.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSparks was born in Phoenix, Arizona,[10] to Jodi Wiedmann Sparks and former professional American football player Phillippi Sparks. Jordin has a younger brother, Phillippi \"PJ\" Sparks Jr., who played football at Arizona Christian University. Her father is of African-American descent and her mother is of European descent, specifically German, English, Scottish, and Norwegian.[11] She grew up in the suburbs of Ridgewood, New Jersey, while her father played as a defensive back for the New York Giants. After living in New Jersey, Sparks attended Northwest Community Christian School in Phoenix through the eighth grade. Sparks attended Sandra Day O'Connor High School until 2006 when she was homeschooled by her grandmother, Pam Wiedmann, to better concentrate on her singing.[12] Sparks is an evangelical Christian and attended Calvary Community Church in Phoenix. On her American Idol biography, she thanked her parents, grandparents, and God for her win.[13] She won an award for best young artist of the year in Arizona three years in a row.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2006: Career beginnings and American Idol\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore appearing on American Idol, Sparks participated in and won such talent competitions as Coca-Cola's Rising Star, the Gospel Music Association Academy's Overall Spotlight Award, America's Most Talented Kids, Colgate Country Showdown, and the 2006 Drug Free AZ Superstar Search. From the time Jordin was nine years old until her win as American Idol 2007, her maternal grandmother, Pam Wiedmann, managed her. Prior to Idol, Sparks frequently performed the national anthem at various local sporting events, notably for the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Sparks also appeared with Alice Cooper in his 2004 Christmas show and toured with Christian contemporary singer Michael W. Smith in 2006. In 2006, Sparks was one of six winners of the Phoenix Torrid search for the \"Next Plus Size Model\". She was flown to California, where she was featured in Torrid ads and promotional pieces.[14] A full-page ad for Torrid featuring Sparks ran in the December 2006 issue of Seventeen magazine.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, at the age of 16, Sparks auditioned twice for the sixth season of American Idol: once in Los Angeles but failed to make it past the first round;[15] and again in Seattle after winning Arizona Idol, a talent competition conducted by Phoenix Fox station KSAZ-TV. The Seattle audition is the one seen in the January 17, 2007, broadcast of American Idol, in which she earned a \"gold ticket\" and the right to appear in the Hollywood Round. American Idol judge Randy Jackson made the offhand prediction that \"Curly hair will win this year.\"[16] While on the show, Sparks gained a loyal fan base known as \"Sparkplugs\". On May 23, 2007, at the age of 17, Sparks won the sixth season of American Idol. She remains the youngest winner in American Idol history. Cowell said, \"Jordin was the most improved over the whole season – didn't start the best, but midway through this was the girl who suddenly got momentum.\" He included that \"Young girl, likeable, and the singer won over the entertainer [Lewis].\"[17] Four selected songs Sparks had performed on American Idol, including the season's coronation song, \"This Is My Now\", were made available on her self-titled EP, released on May 22, 2007, the day before the grand finale.[18] The coronation song \"This Is My Now\" peaked at number fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Sparks's first top-fifteen hit on the chart.[19] The following summer, Sparks took part in the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2007 from July 6 to September 23, 2007, along with other contestants in the top ten.\n\nSince her win in 2007, Sparks has returned to Idol six times. She performed twice on the seventh season of American Idol, once on the Idol Gives Back results show singing \"No Air\" with Chris Brown and again with \"One Step at a Time\" on May 21, 2008, for the finale. She performed \"Battlefield\" on the May 13, 2009, episode of American Idol.\n\nThe following year, on May 26, 2010, Sparks took part in a tribute to Simon Cowell with other former contestants at the ninth season finale. During the tenth season, Sparks performed her new song \"I Am Woman\" on the Top 4 results show. She appeared on the finale of the eleventh season singing \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" alongside that year's fourth-place contestant Hollie Cavanagh. Sparks was the most recent female to win the competition until the twelfth season.[20] In a comedic clip on the finale, \"We Were Sabotaged\", the boys of the twelfth season realize that she was the \"mastermind\" behind the girls' sabotage because it was five years since a girl had won.\n\nPerformances/results\n\nEpisode Theme Song choice Original artist Order # Result Audition N/A \"Because You Loved Me\" Celine Dion N/A Advanced Hollywood N/A \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" Soul Brothers Six N/A Advanced Top 24 (12 Women) N/A \"Give Me One Reason\" Tracy Chapman 6 Safe Top 20 (10 Women) Dedication Week \"Reflection\" Christina Aguilera 6 Safe Top 16 (8 Women) N/A \"Heartbreaker\" Pat Benatar 1 Safe Top 12 Diana Ross \"If We Hold on Together\" Diana Ross 12 Safe Top 11 British Invasion \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" Ben E.

To date, it has sold over a million copies in the U.S[27] and was certified platinum by the RIAA.[23] \"No Air\", a duet with Chris Brown, was released as the second single from the album in February 2008. In the United States, the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Sparks's best-charting single to date.[19] It was also her first song to appear on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it reached number four.[19] To date, the song has sold over three million copies in the U.S, making Sparks the first American Idol contestant to reach the three million mark.[3] It also became Brown's first song to hit three million. \"No Air\" also charted in Australia[28] and New Zealand,[29] where it reached number one, receiving platinum certifications in both countries.[24][30]\n\nOn February 3, 2008, Sparks sang the National Anthem at Super Bowl XLII.[31] She performed in a tribute to Aretha Franklin at the NAACP Awards in February, as well. She had previously performed in a tribute to Diana Ross in December 2007.\n\nIn support of the album, Sparks opened for Alicia Keys on the North America leg of her As I Am Tour, starting on April 19, 2008.[32] Before the tour, a career-threatening throat injury forced Sparks to cancel a few weeks of the shows. Officials revealed she was suffering an acute vocal cord hemorrhage and was ordered strict vocal rest until the condition improved.[33] Sparks was back on the road by April 30, 2008, and remained on the tour until June 18, 2008. Sparks later joined Keys for the tour leg in Australia and New Zealand in December 2008.[34][35]\n\nThe album's third single, \"One Step at a Time\", was released in June 2008. It peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Sparks her fourth top twenty hit on the chart.[19] This makes Sparks the only American Idol contestant to have her first four singles reach the top twenty of the Hot 100. It also charted in the top twenty in Australia,[28] Canada,[19] and the United Kingdom.[36] In New Zealand, the song reached number two[29] and was certified gold by the RIANZ.[30] In August 2008, Sparks co-headlined the Jesse & Jordin LIVE Tour with Jesse McCartney in the United States and Canada.[37]\n\nSparks received two MTV Video Music Award nominations for Best Female Video for \"No Air\" and Best New Artist at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.[38] While at the award show, Sparks caused controversy by responding to a joke made by host Russell Brand during his opening monologue, in which he held up a silver ring, claiming to have relieved one of the Jonas Brothers of their virginity,[39] saying he would \"take them more seriously if they wore it (the ring) around their genitals\". Sparks, who was also wearing a promise ring, began her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna by saying \"It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut.\" In response to the controversy over her \"slut\" remark, Sparks told Entertainment Weekly that she does not regret the remark, commenting that \"I wish I would've worded it differently – that somebody who doesn't wear a promise ring isn't necessarily a slut – but I can't take it back now.\"[40] At the 2008 American Music Awards, Sparks won the award for Favorite Artist in the Adult Contemporary Category.[41]\n\n2009–10: Battlefield\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Battlefield (album)\n\nOn January 20, 2009, Sparks performed \"Faith\" at the Commander-in-Chief's Inaugural Ball hosted by President Barack Obama during the First inauguration of Barack Obama.[42] Her second studio album, Battlefield was released in the United States on July 21.[43] The album's title track was released as the lead single on May 25, 2009, and reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100.[19] The song peaked in the top five in Australia,[28] Canada,[19] and New Zealand.[29] In the United States, Battlefield debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, peaking higher than her debut album's position of number ten. However, the album was notably unsuccessful compared to her debut, only selling 177,000 copies in the U.S[27] and having failed to earn any chart certificates.\n\nIn support of the album, Sparks opened for The Jonas Brothers on the North America leg of the Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009, starting on June 20, 2009.[44] She also opened for Britney Spears on the second leg of her Circus Tour in North America, beginning on August 24, 2009.[45] Sparks served as a replacement for Ciara. She opened with Kristinia DeBarge, Girlicious, and One Call.[45]\n\n\"S.O.S. (Let the Music Play)\", was released as the second single from Battlefield on September 15, 2009.[46] The song topped the U.S Hot Dance Club Songs chart, becoming Sparks's first number one on the chart[19] and peaked in the top fifteen in the United Kingdom.[36] During this time, Sparks also recorded the duet, \"Art of Love\", with Australian artist Guy Sebastian for his fifth studio album, Like It Like That. The song reached the top ten in Australia[28] and New Zealand[29] and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association.[47] The third single from Battlefield, \"Don't Let It Go to Your Head\", was released in the United Kingdom on January 8, 2010.[48]\n\nIn May 2010, Sparks embarked on her first headlining tour in the United States, the Battlefield Tour.[49] It began on May 1, and ended on July 18, 2010, stopping in over 35 major cities in the United States. In support of the DVD/Blu-ray re-release of the Disney animated film, Beauty and the Beast, Sparks recorded a cover of the film's title track for the soundtrack.[50] A music video for the song was released on October 18, 2010.[51]\n\n2010–12: Record label issues, compilations and films\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, she was also featured on the Big Time Rush song \"Count on You\", and the show with the same name, \"Big Time Sparks\" which aired on June 18. In an October 2010 interview, Sparks revealed she had begun working on her third studio album.[52] During an interview with Good Day New York in November 2010, Sparks confirmed she would be recording the album in New York and Arizona.[53] In January 2011, it was reported that Sparks and John Legend were working on songs in the studio together.[54]\n\nIn March 2011, Sparks recorded a music video for a song called \"The World I Knew\" for the film, African Cats, released on April 22.[55] On May 5, 2011, it was revealed that Sparks would release a non-album single, \"I Am Woman\".[56] To support her new single, Sparks served as an opening act for the NKOTBSB summer tour.[57] On May 12, Sparks performed \"I Am Woman\" on the American Idol Top 4 results show.[58] It debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty-two with 33,000 downloads sold.[59][60] It also debuted on the US Billboard Digital Songs at number fifty-seven.[61] Sparks performed \"I Am Woman\" on Regis and Kelly on June 14.[62][63][64]\n\nOn June 16, 2011, Sparks had her first-ever bikini shoot for the cover of People's Most Amazing Bodies issue. When speaking about her weight loss and diet to Access Hollywood, Sparks said, \"My diet has pretty much remained the same, like if I want a piece of bread, I'm gonna have a piece of bread, but I'm making healthier decisions like instead of a bag of chips for a snack, I'll see if I can find an apple. I've also upped my intake of vegetables and I'm drinking a lot more water.\"[65][66][67][68]\n\nSparks stated in an August 2011 interview there was no scheduled release date for her third album which was still in production.[69] A song, \"You Gotta Want It\", was to be part of an NFL compilation album, Official Gameday Music of the NFL Vol. 2. According to reports, the song would be available to download on iTunes and Amazon on September 27. The song was co-written by Chris Weaver and Matthew J. Rogers while being produced by Cash Money Records' Cool & Dre.[70] On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Sparks (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) would release her future material (including her upcoming third studio album) on the RCA Records brand.[71][72] On November 14, 2011, it was announced that Sparks had recorded an original song called \"Angels Are Singing\" as a part of ABC Family's \"12 Dates of Christmas\".[73] On February 29, 2012, Sparks's boyfriend Jason Derulo took to Twitter announcing the official remix of his single \"It Girl\" featuring Sparks. There was a video released with the remix, which showed home videos, of Derulo and Sparks together as well as pictures.[74][75]\n\nOn September 12, 2011, it was announced that Sparks would be making her feature film debut playing the lead role in the music-themed pic Sparkle, a remake of the 1976 film inspired by the story of The Supremes. The remake was set in 1968 Detroit, during the rise of Motown. The story focused on the youngest sister, a music prodigy named Sparkle Williams (Sparks), and her struggle to become a star while overcoming issues that were tearing her family apart.[76][77] R&B singer Aaliyah was originally tapped to star as Sparkle; however, following her death in a 2001 plane crash, production on the film, which was scheduled for 2002, had been derailed.[78][79][80] Sparkle was filmed in the fall of 2011 over a two-month period.[81] The film, starring both Sparks and Houston, was released on August 17, 2012, in the United States. On May 21, 2012, \"Celebrate\", the last song Whitney Houston recorded with Sparks, premiered at RyanSeacrest.com. It was made available for digital download on iTunes on June 5.[82] The song was featured on the Sparkle: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack album as the first official single.[83] The accompanying music video for Celebrate was filmed on May 30, 2012.[84] The video was shot over 2 days and was released on June 27. A sneak peek of the video premiered on entertainment tonight on June 4, 2012.[85][86]\n\nOn July 24, 2012, it was officially announced that Sparks would star in her second film, an indie drama titled \"'The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete'\".[87] Produced by Street State Pictures, the George Tillman Jr-directed film stars Jennifer Hudson, Sparks, Jeffrey Wright, and Anthony Mackie. Alicia Keys is the film's executive producer.[88][89] Production on the film began on July 23, 2012, in Brooklyn.[90]\n\nOn August 9, 2012, Sparks stated in an interview with Billboard, that she had about seven songs set so far for her third album. Sparks stated \"It's going to be different from what my fans have heard before. With (2009's) 'Battlefield' it was pop/rock and a little bit of pop/R&B, but I'm going for more of the R&B side now, so it's like R&B/pop instead of pop/R&B.\"[91] In an interview with MTV, Sparks confirmed she had recorded a duet with Jason Derulo and it would be on the album and could serve as a potential single.[92] Sparks performed on VH1 Divas 2012 with fellow singers Miley Cyrus, Kelly Rowland and Ciara. The show premiered on December 16, 2012. Sparks joined singers Ledisi and Melanie Fiona in a tribute to Whitney Houston.\n\n2013–14: Solo music hiatus, Left Behind and label change\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2013, Sparks took to Twitter announcing that she and RCA Records had finally come to an agreement about releasing new material. Sparks asked her fans to email her their opinions and frustrations regarding the delay in the release of her third studio album. Sparks later announced that her new music would be released in the fall of 2013.\n\nOn July 22, 2013, it was announced that the first promotional track from her upcoming third studio album would be released in August. The song \"Skipping a Beat\" was officially released on August 1, 2013. The buzz single became available for download on August 13.[93] Sparks was featured on \"Vertigo\" from Jason Derulo's third studio album, Tattoos, which was released on September 24. It was announced that Sparks's third album had officially been completed and was awaiting release. However, it was later announced that new music from Sparks would not be released until early 2014 due to timing issues with acting projects [94] as well as placement issues within her label RCA.[95]\n\nOn August 9, 2013, it was announced that Sparks had signed on to join the cast of the action science fiction-thriller film Left Behind. It was then revealed that Sparks's character was named Shasta, but for the most part, her role was kept under wraps. One of the film's producers Paul Lalonde said that \"She will be a passenger on a plane that the film's main character Captain Rayford Steele is piloting\".[96] It was later announced that Sparks would co-star alongside Nicolas Cage as Captain Rayford Steele, Chad Michael Murray as Cameron \"Buck\" Williams and Nicky Whelan as Hattie Durham. Scheduled for release on October 3, 2014, the film's shooting began on August 9, 2013, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[97][98][99] On October 7, 2013, it was announced that Sparks would guest star in an upcoming episode in the fourteenth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.[100] Sparks played Alison Stone, a high school teacher who somehow found herself scared and covered in blood in a hotel room crime scene.
