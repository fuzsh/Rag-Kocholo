        "text": "Stop the Presses is a quest in Act Three of Baldur's Gate 3. It can be started by speaking with Estra Stir in the Lower City or Lens in Rivington or Ettvard Needle in the Baldur's Mouth.\n\nIf this quest isn't picked up before Gortash's death, it will no longer be available because the newspaper will be solely reporting on the Archduke's death. Ettvard Needle will even call the party \"old news\" and shoo them away.\n\nObjectives[edit | edit source]\n\nWalkthrough[edit | edit source]\n\nEstra Stir and the Baldur's Mouth Gazette[edit | edit source]\n\nSpeaking to Estra Stir, just south of the Basilisk Gate in the Lower City X: 122 Y: -66, reveals that the party is the subject of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette's next issue - the juiciest one to date. Estra refuses to elaborate on what the piece intends to be about, nor hear any arguments about the party's consent to be written about. However, her statements start the quest, to investigate Baldur's Mouth by speaking to the editor. The Baldur's Mouth buildingX: 67 Y: -52 is south of the Elfsong Tavern. Inside, there is the editor-in-chief, Ettvard Needle.\n\nIf Ettvard is spoken to, he reveals that the article being published on the party is negative, and that they should have thought about the consequences before disgracing themselves in public.\n\nThe reason for Ettvard's hatred can vary - if the quest Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders has been started, then he states it’s due to getting involved in a murder investigation immediately after entering the city. If the ambush at the Circus of the Last Days has been encountered, there is a chance he instead places the blame for the murder of the circus performers on the party. If the Disable the Steel Watch quest is completed, he'll state that you were responsible for destroying the Foundry. Otherwise, he may blame them for a tenfold increase in Absolutionist activity, or for the trafficking of refugees into Baldur's Gate.\n\nAfter Ettvard has been spoken to, the party is kicked out of the Gazette and the door locked, making entry significantly harder. However, it’s possible to freely roam about the public parts of the Gazette before speaking with him.\n\nStopping the Hit Piece[edit | edit source]\n\nIn order to stop the hit piece, the party must reach the printing press in the Baldur's Mouth basement. This can be reached by an elevator by the entrance or by metal doors downstairs near Ettvard. There are many ways to sneak into the area. One such way is to use Misty Step or Fly and jump to the roof of the Baldur's Mouth. Then, above the area where the elevator is, there are barricades. These barricades can be destroyed with blunt attacks or spells. After doing this, it is possible to jump down, and use the elevator's lever to sneak into the basement. Alternatively, one party member with Greater Invisibility could sneak in while the rest of the party waits outside.\n\nOnce inside, there are two Steel Watchers who are patrolling the halls. With using Invisibility, Greater Invisibility or Hiding, enabling Turn-Based Mode, and the Dash action, it will be possible to sneak past them without initiating combat. In between the two halls is an iron gate, which can be lockpicked. Otherwise, entering the side rooms to the north - there are barricades that can be destroyed to cross freely between the two rooms. After getting past the gate, there is the printing press.\n\nOnce the party arrives in the printing room, they are able to interact with the printing press, Jelliwig, which starts a conversation.\n\nIf the fairy Dolly Dolly Dolly was freed from the Moonlantern in Act Two, the press recognizes the party, and offers to help immediately. Otherwise, it has to be persuaded through dialogue choices and skill checks.\n\nWhat 'art' would that be?\n\nAre you a talking printer?\n\nTake one step further\n\nChoosing the first two options has the printer speaking up, introducing itself as Jelliwig, the 'artist' in charge of putting ink on the broadsheets.\n\nWhat reputation?\n\n[PERSUASION] I'd love to see an example of your work (DC 7)\n\n[PERFORMANCE] I'm actually a great admirer of your work - may I see? (DC 7)\n\nIf \"Maybe you could do me a favour and stop the presses? Change the article?\" is chosen, then Jelliwig is reluctant to change the article, for fear of angering Ettvard.\n\nThen get out of my way. I need to clear my reputation.\n\n[DECEPTION] Help me change the article or I'll banish you from the printer. (DC 15)\n\n[PERSUASION] Wouldn't changing the article be delightfully naughty? (DC 15)\n\n[BARBARIAN] [INTIMIDATION] Do it, you stupid creature. Unless you want to be ripped apart, piece by piece? (DC 10)\n\n[SORCERER] [INTIMIDATION] Do it, or I'll melt you into a steaming pile of iron and regret. (DC 10)\n\nIf the check is passed and Jelliwig agrees to help, then it states it needs a new printing block to replace the old one. Appropriate blocks can be found throughout the basement, as well as in baskets on the Baldur's Mouth's main floor.\n\nChoosing 'Take one step closer' and 'Take another step further' results in different checks:\n\n[ATHLETICS] Force the printing press open and clear the loaded headline. (DC 20)\n\n[BARBARIAN] [ATHLETICS] Wrench the printing press open and rip out the loaded headline. (DC 18)\n\n[SLEIGHT OF HAND] Reach inside and carefully remove the loaded headline. (DC 20)\n\n[ROGUE] [SLEIGHT OF HAND] Dislodge the current headline with a precise flick of the wrist. (DC 18)\n\nIf these checks are failed, then the press starts printing automatically, and is unable to be tampered with further.\n\nIt is possible to alter the headlines when the party doesn't have the quest, and even when the quest is no longer available because Gortash is dead. Doing so will affect the world the same way as if the quest was active.\n\nPositive Articles:\n\nAdventurers, Our Best Hope for the City X: -1029 Y: 1013 - in a wicker basket\n\nCelebrate the Brave Heroes Who Slew General Ketheric X: 53 Y: -50 - upstairs, in a wicker basket behind Ettvard\n\nMake Big Money by Trading with Adventurers X: -1029 Y: 1058 - in a wicker basket.\n\nNeutral Articles:\n\nCutest Cat You've Ever Seen X: -1022 Y: 1066 - on a counter.\n\nHear the Finest Shanties at the Blushing Mermaid X: 43 Y: -60 - upstairs, in a wicker basket\n\nGraverobbers' Spree X: 58 Y: -42 - upstairs, in a wicker basket\n\nNegative Articles:\n\nA Public Danger! X: -1032 Y: 1035 - on a shelf.\n\nWolves in Sheeps' Clothing X: -1014 Y: 1016 - on a counter.\n\nCurse-breakers or Curse-makers? X: -1032 Y: 1018 - on a desk.\n\nKilling Ettvard[edit | edit source]\n\nIt is possible to end the hit piece by killing Ettvard. This results in the paper covering his demise, rather than the hit piece.\n\nPossible Consequences[edit | edit source]\n\nIf the party uses a positive headline: People around town compliment the party or recognize them positively, and their reputation is improved, resulting in a gain of 10 attitude with some vendors.\n\nOne of those traders is Gloomy Fentonson. The narrator tells the following if approaching him: News of your good deeds has travelled fast. The merchant is all too happy to extend a certain generosity towards you, where the price of goods is concerned.\n\nPossible other traders are Fytz the Firecracker, Vicar Humbletoes, Omotola, Thomas C. Quirkilious and Tolna Tome-Monger.\n\nIf the party uses a neutral headline: Nothing of note changes.\n\nIf the party does nothing, or uses a negative headline: People around town comment negatively towards the party, and their reputation is tarnished, resulting in a loss of 15 attitude with most vendors (Rivington vendors are unaffected).\n\nNotes[edit | edit source]"
