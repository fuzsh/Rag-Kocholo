Zevin's father, who is American-born, has Russian, Polish and Lithuanian Jewish ancestry.[1] Her mother was born in Korea and immigrated to the United States when she was 9 years old.[1] The two met in high school in Connecticut and later worked for IBM.[1]\n\nShe grew up in Boca Raton, Florida, and graduated from Spanish River Community High School in 1996.[2] She enrolled at Harvard University, where she studied English[3] with a concentration in American Literature.[1] While at Harvard, she met her partner, Hans Canosa. She graduated in 2000.[3][1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nZevin's debut novel, Margarettown, published in 2005, was a selection of the Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers Program and longlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Award. In a starred review, Kirkus Reviews called the novel \"a droll piece of romantic whimsy with an unexpected resonance.\"[4]\n\nIn 2014, The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry debuted on the New York Times Best Seller List, reached #1 on the National Indie Best Seller List, and went on to become an international bestseller. It has been translated into over thirty languages.

Kirkus Reviews called it \"the best thing to come out of the Monica Lewinsky scandal since Lewinsky's own magnificent TED talk.\"[7]\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow was released in 2022 as Zevin's fifth novel for adults.[8] It won the 2022 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Fiction.[9]\n\nNovels for young readers\n\n[edit]\n\nZevin has also written books for young readers. Her first young adult novel, Elsewhere, was published in 2005, three months after her adult debut, Margarettown. It was chosen as an American Library Association Notable Children's Book, nominated for a 2006 Quill award, won the Borders Original Voices Award, and was a selection of the Barnes & Noble Book Club. It also made the Carnegie long list. The book has been translated into over 25 languages.\n\nZevin's 2007 young adult book Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac was chosen for the ALA Best Books for Young Adults list. In 2010, she and Hans Canosa adapted it into a screenplay that became the Japanese movie Dareka ga Watashi ni Kiss wo Shita (Someone Kissed Me), starring top teen idol actress Maki Horikita.[10]\n\nOther writing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Zevin was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay for Conversations with Other Women.
