In October 2014, she signed a talent holding deal with Fox and 20th Century Fox Television[3] and was subsequently cast in several television pilots for NBC and CBS, including the medical drama series Pure Genius (2016–2017) and the action drama series Station 19 (2018–2020).[4] She provided the voice of Anne Boonchuy in the Disney Channel animated series Amphibia (2019–2022), starred as Madison Maxwell in the Hulu comedy-drama series Dollface (2019–2022), and provides the voice of Princess Akemi in Blue Eye Samurai (2023–present). She has also headlined the romantic comedy film Angry Angel (2017), the psychological thriller film Secret Obsession (2019), the comedy-drama film Changeland (2019), and the romantic comedy Love Accidentally (2022).[5][6][7] She also starred in the horror video game The Quarry (2022).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBrenda Song was born on March 27, 1988, in Carmichael, California,[1][8][9] a suburb of Sacramento, to a Thai father from Bangkok and Thai Hmong mother from Chiang Mai.[10] Her paternal grandparents were from the Xiong clan (熊; Xyooj in Hmong), but Americanized their surname to Song after arriving in the United States.[10] Her parents were born in Thailand and met as adults in Sacramento. Her father works as a school teacher and her mother, a housewife. She has two younger brothers named Timmy and Nathan Song.[11][12]\n\nWhen she was six years old, Song moved with her mother to Los Angeles, California to support her acting career; the rest of the family followed two years later. As a young girl, Song wanted to do ballet, while her younger brother wanted to take taekwondo. She said, \"My mom only wanted to take us to one place,\" so they settled on taekwondo. Although Song cried all the way through her first class,[13] she now holds a black belt in taekwondo. Song was named an All-American Scholar in the ninth grade. She was homeschooled and earned a high school diploma at age 16,[11][10] then took courses at a community college. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 2009,[14] majoring in psychology[10] and minoring in business.[15][16][17]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1990s: Early roles\n\n[edit]\n\nSong began in show business as a child fashion model in San Francisco after being spotted in a shopping mall by an agent from a modeling school.[18] She began acting at the age of five or six in a Little Caesars commercial,[11][19] and then a Barbie commercial.[11] Her first film role was in the 1995 Requiem, an AFI student short film by actress Elizabeth Sung. \"She came in confident [at the auditions]. She was very focused, and it was very obvious that she loved what she was doing,\" said Sung.[13] The film is about a waitress/dancer named Fong who remembers her loving brother and their bittersweet childhood in Hong Kong. The seven-year-old Song played a young version of \"Fong\", who is portrayed as an adult by Tamlyn Tomita. The film won a CINE Golden Eagle award.[20] She appeared in another short film directed by Elizabeth Sung called The White Fox.[10] Song next appeared in two episodes of the television program Thunder Alley, and was a regular in the children's television series Fudge, in which she portrayed Jenny. Her theatrical film debut was in Santa with Muscles, a 1996 independent film starring professional wrestler Hulk Hogan.\n\nAfter a small role in Leave It to Beaver (1997), she appeared in the Nickelodeon television series 100 Deeds for Eddie McDowd, where she played Sariffa Chung in thirteen episodes. After 100 Deeds, she had a number of small parts in television shows such as 7th Heaven, Judging Amy, ER, Once and Again, The Brothers García, Popular, Bette, The Bernie Mac Show, The Nightmare Room, For the People, and George Lopez.\n\n2000s: Breakthrough with Disney\n\n[edit]\n\nTwo of Song's early roles led to recognition in the Young Artist Awards. Her role in the 2000 Disney Channel Original Movie, The Ultimate Christmas Present, won her the award for \"Best Performance in a TV Movie Comedy, Supporting Young Actress\".[21] The film centers on two teenage girls, Allison Thompson (Hallee Hirsh) and Samantha Kwan (Song), who find a weather machine and make it snow in Los Angeles. Her 2002 appearance on The Bernie Mac Show led to her nomination for \"Best Performance in a TV Comedy Series, Guest Starring Young Actress\".[22] In the same year, she was in the 20th Century Fox family film Like Mike, which grossed over $60 million.[23] The film stars rapper Bow Wow as an orphan who can suddenly play NBA-level basketball. Song portrays the character Reg Stevens, a thirteen-year-old orphan.\n\nIn 2002, Song signed a contract with Disney[13] and appeared in the Disney Channel movie Get a Clue (alongside Lindsay Lohan). Song continued to make guest appearances in Disney sitcoms such as That's So Raven and One on One. She had a recurring role as Tia in the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future, appearing in seven episodes of the series in 2004 and 2005. In Summer 2004, Song starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie Stuck in the Suburbs, portraying Natasha Kwon-Schwartz.[24] The television premiere received 3.7 million viewers.[25] The film is about two teenage girls living in suburbia who accidentally exchange cell phones with a famous teen singer.[26] At age 15, she received an early acceptance letter from Harvard University that she turned down. Speaking of the time, she said, \"My mom got breast cancer for the first time, I booked Suite Life, and I was accepted into the college I'd always wanted to go to.\" Her father encouraged her to take the role on Suite Life.[27]\n\nIn 2005, Song began appearing in the role of spoiled heiress London Tipton in the Disney Channel Original Series, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The role was initially named \"Paris\" in an allusion to Paris Hilton.[11][28][29] She got the role without an audition[30] Song says, \"London is my fantasy person, I wish I could be her. I wish I had her closet.\"[11] The series is about the residents and workers at the fictional Tipton Hotel in Boston and mainly centers around the trouble-making twins, Zack and Cody Martin (Dylan and Cole Sprouse). The series premiered on the Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, receiving four million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for the Disney Channel in 2005.[31] The series earned a 2007 Young Artist Award for \"Best Family Television Series (comedy)\",[32] Emmy nominations for \"Outstanding Children's Program\" (twice)[33] and \"Outstanding Choreography\",[34] and three Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award nominations for \"Favorite TV show\" in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[35] In 2006 Song earned an Asian Excellence Award nomination for \"Outstanding Newcomer\" for her part in the series.[36]\n\nAfter her debut on the Suite Life series, Song became a regular on the Disney Channel, and had a voice role in Disney Channel's American Dragon: Jake Long series. In 2006, Song had a voice-over role in Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen. She later starred in an online series called London Tipton's Yay Me!. Song was part of the Disney Channel Circle of Stars, a group of performers from several different Disney Channel television series. She was featured in the recording and music video of a version of \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\", which was included on the special edition Cinderella platinum edition DVD and on the DisneyMania 4 CD, released in April 2006. In the Suite Life High School Musical-themed episode, Song performed \"Bop To The Top\" and \"Really Great\". \"Really Great\" became the theme song for the online series, London Tipton's Yay Me!. She sang \"Bling Is My Favourite Thing\" on another Suite Life episode. In these episodes, Song purposefully sang poorly in character as London Tipton. In 2008, Ian Scott wrote and produced demo songs for her, credited to Mark Jackson Productions.[37]\n\nSong's first starring role as the title character was in the 2006 Disney Channel Original Movie Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior,[38] which had over 5.7 million viewers at its premiere.[18][39] Song was originally planned to play a supporting role, but was offered the lead after starting training in martial arts. Lydia Cook, one of the films's directors, said, \"She had the perfect combination of wit and martial arts.\"[13] The film was about a Chinese-American teenager whose life is turned upside down by a visit from a young Chinese monk (Shin Koyamada); it also deals with Wendy's culture and heritage.[40] Disney Channel executive vice president Gary Marsh called the film \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and said of Song: \"She's incredibly talented, she's smart. She adds diversity to our network, and she's a real kid.\"[40] Song felt she could relate to the character's struggles with her heritage since she knew little about her own people before making the film.[11][41] To promote the film, she posed for the cover of Seventeen, Teen People, Teen, Seventeen Malaysia, and several other magazines,[42] and traveled to Malaysia, Singapore, and Costa Rica.[43] The film received positive reviews from critics. UltimateDisney.com called the film \"a great showcase of talent in both acting and martial for Brenda Song.\"[38] Allmovie described Song as a \"charming and appealing personality\".[44] Song did most of her own stunt work for the film, with guidance from Koichi Sakamoto. According to The New York Times, the film became a \"star vehicle\" for Song.[11]\n\nSong reprised her role as London Tipton in the Suite Life spin-off, The Suite Life on Deck.[45] The show's premiere on the Disney Channel drew 5.7 million viewers,[46] and it became the most-watched series premiere on Canada's Family Channel.[47] Disney ordered second and third seasons for the series.[48] Song also starred as Paige in an animated television special for NBC, \"Macy's Presents Little Spirit: Christmas in New York\".[49] In late 2008, Song made a special appearance at the grand opening of the RTA HealthLine in Cleveland.[50] In May 2009, the cast of 'The Suite Life' became Disney Channel's longest running continuous characters on air.[2] MSN's 2009 cover story on the series stated: \"Song is one of the main reasons why the \"Suite Life\" franchise remains one of the most successful and highly rated series in the Disney stable.\"[51] Also in 2009, she starred in the telefilm Special Delivery,[52] a film about a bonded courier, Maxine (Lisa Edelstein) and a troubled teen, Alice (Song). The Daily Record called it a \"likeable comedy\".[53] The Australian publication Urban CineFilm gave Song a positive review for her performance in the film.[54] Song also appeared in the theatrical film College Road Trip with Raven-Symoné and Martin Lawrence.\n\n2010s: Mainstream film and television\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2008, Song began filming sci-fi/dance film Boogie Town in Los Angeles.

In 2013, Song had a recurring role as Daisy in New Girl.[58] In August 2013, Song was cast in a leading role in the Fox television series Dads, in which Song portrayed Veronica. The show's pilot episode was criticized by Asian American watchdog groups because Song's character wore a stereotypical \"sexy Asian schoolgirl\" costume, which was deemed \"racist\" by watchdog groups.[59][60][61][62][63][64] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Song defended the show and denied the racism allegations.[65] Fox refused to re-shoot the scenes.[60][66] The show premiered September 17, 2013, but in May 2014, Fox canceled the series after only one season.[67][68]\n\nIn October 2014, Song signed a talent holding deal with Fox and 20th Century Fox Television to star in a television project.[3][69][70][71] In April 2015, Song was cast in a regular role in the NBC comedy pilot Take It From Us.[72] In November 2015, Song was cast in the show Life in Pieces as Bonnie.[73] In February 2016, Song was cast in the CBS pilot Bunker Hill.[74] Later renamed Pure Genius, the series was picked up by CBS and aired during the 2016-2017 television season, but was canceled after one season.[75] In March 2017, Song was cast as a series regular in the CBS pilot Real Life.[76] She was also cast in Seth Green's directorial debut Changeland.
