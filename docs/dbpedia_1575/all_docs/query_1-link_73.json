It was both a critical and chart success, peaking at No. 13 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart. The album has been certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments over ten million copies.\n\nBrooks commented on the album, saying:\n\nThis album was released in April 1989, in the States. Definitely scared to death. I thought the album was very very innocent. And I gotta be truthful with you, every time I hear those songs off the radio or off the album itself, or even when we play them live. I really get that same kind of scared feeling, that I had, way back in 1988, and 1989. Whether you get the album or not, or whether you have the album or not. Thanks, for just, the interest. That first album is always a big one for any artist and I, without trying to sound egotistical, I'm very proud of my first one.[4]\n\nThis album contains Brooks' earliest hits, for instance his first ever single, \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\", which peaked at No. 8 on the Country Billboard Charts in 1989. It put the name of an independent cowboy singer, Chris LeDoux, into the mainstream due to the lyric \"A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux\" Two other strong starts include his first No. 1, \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" and the Academy of Country Music's 1990 Song of the Year and Video of the Year, \"The Dance\" (another No. 1). It also features his first hit he wrote entirely in \"Not Counting You\", another top 10 success.\n\nPunk rock cover artists Me First and the Gimme Gimmes released a version of \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\" as the first track on their October 2006 album Me First and the Gimme Gimmes Love Their Country.\n\n\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" has been covered by Ronan Keating (former lead singer of Irish group Boyzone), and many other famous singers including Barry Manilow.\n\nMoe Bandy previously recorded \"Nobody Gets Off in This Town\" on his 1988 album No Regrets.[5]\n\nGarth Brooks peaked at No. 13 on the US Billboard 200, and peaked at No. 2 on the Top Country Albums. In November 2006, it was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over ten million copies in the United States. To date, the album has shipped ten million copies in the US.\n\nOriginal Release\n\nLimited Series Release\n\nYear Single Peak chart positions US Country CAN Country UK 1989 \"Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)\" 8 9 — \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" 1 2 — 1990 \"Not Counting You\" 2 1 — \"The Dance\" 1 1 36\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United States (RIAA)[18] Diamond 10,000,000^\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone."
