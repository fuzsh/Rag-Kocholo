        "text": "American musician and composer\n\nMark Allen Mothersbaugh ( ; born May 18, 1950) is an American musician and composer. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder, lead singer and keyboardist of the new wave band Devo, whose \"Whip It\" was a top 20 single in the US in 1980, peaking at No. 14, and which has since maintained a cult following. Mothersbaugh is one of the main composers of Devo's music.\n\nIn addition to his work with Devo, Mothersbaugh has made music for television series, films and video games via his production company, Mutato Muzika. He composed the music for the 13-year run of the animated series Rugrats and its three related theatrical films. He has created film scores for Wes Anderson and for Marvel Comics films. As a solo musician, Mothersbaugh has released four studio albums: Muzik for Insomniaks, Muzik for the Gallery, Joyeux Mutato and The Most Powerful Healing Muzik in the Entire World.\n\nIn 2004, he received the Richard Kirk award at the BMI Film and TV Awards for his contributions to film and television music.[4] In 2008, Mothersbaugh received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University, his alma mater.[5]\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nMark Allen Mothersbaugh was born on May 18, 1950, in Akron, Ohio. His parents are Mary Margaret (\"Mig\") and Robert Mothersbaugh, Sr. He grew up with two younger brothers, Bob and Jim, who are both musicians, and two sisters, Amy and Susan, and graduated from Woodridge High School in Peninsula, Ohio.[6][7] His father appeared in early Devo films and fan events as the character General Boy and his brothers participated in the band, although Jim's tenure was brief, appearing only on several early demos.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDevo\n\n[edit]\n\nMothersbaugh attended Kent State University as an art student, where he met Devo co-founders Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis. In early 1970, Lewis and Casale formed the idea of the \"devolution\" of the human race after Casale's friends Jeffrey Miller and Allison Krause were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen on university grounds during what came to be known as the Kent State shootings.[8] Intrigued by the concept, Mothersbaugh joined them, building upon it with elements of early post-structuralist ideas and oddball arcana, most notably unearthing the infamous Jocko-Homo Heavenbound pamphlet[9] (the basis for the song \"Jocko Homo\").[10] This association culminated in 1973, when the trio started to play music as Devo. Following the commercial failure of their sixth studio album Shout, Warner Bros. dropped Devo. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, drummer Alan Myers left the band,[11] causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a Shout video LP, as well as a tour.\n\nIn 1987, Devo reformed with new drummer David Kendrick, formerly of Sparks, to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film Slaughterhouse Rock, starring Toni Basil and they released the albums Total Devo (1988) and Smooth Noodle Maps (1990), on Enigma.\n\nDevo had a falling-out and played two shows in 1991 before breaking up. Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film The Spirit of '76, except for Bob Mothersbaugh. In 1989, Mark Mothersbaugh established Mutato Muzika, a commercial music production studio, hiring Ryan Moore and Bob Casale; Bob Mothersbaugh was also involved.[12]\n\nIn 2006, Devo worked with Disney on the Devo 2.0 project: a band of child performers was assembled to re-record Devo songs. The Akron Beacon Journal wrote, \"Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled DEV2.0, was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for family-friendly airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits. Mothersbaugh doesn't rule out the idea of the band gathering in the studio, eventually, to record a new Devo album.\"[13] The album, Something for Everybody was eventually released in June 2010, preceded by a 12\" single of \"Fresh\"/\"What We Do\".[14]\n\nDevo was awarded the first Moog Innovator Award on October 29, 2010, during Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. The award aims to celebrate \"pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog\".[15] Devo was scheduled to perform at Moogfest, but canceled three days beforehand after Mark's brother Bob Mothersbaugh (lead guitar) injured his hand. He and Gerald Casale collaborated with Austin, Texas, band The Octopus Project to perform \"Girl U Want\" and \"Beautiful World\" at the event instead.[16]\n\nOther work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1989, Mothersbaugh and other members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990.[17] The group featured his then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob's daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh co-wrote some of the songs, and produced the album with Bob Casale. A promotional video was filmed for the song \"Trilobites\". Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film Rockula, as well as on the Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nSince Devo, Mothersbaugh has developed a successful career writing musical scores for film and television. In film, he has worked frequently with filmmaker Wes Anderson, scoring four of his feature films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou).[18] He composed for The Lego Movie[19] and Thor Ragnarok.[20][21]\n\nHis music has been a staple of the children's television shows Rugrats, Beakman's World, Santo Bugito and Clifford the Big Red Dog. He wrote the new theme song for the original Felix the Cat show when it was sold to Broadway Video, some music for Pee-wee's Playhouse in 1986-1990 and the theme song for the Super Mario World TV series for DIC Entertainment in 1991.[22] The character design for Chuckie Finster on Rugrats was based on him.[23] Along with Bob Casale, he produced Heroes & Villains (2000), a soundtrack album with music inspired by The Powerpuff Girls.[24] Mothersbaugh originally sought out to be the show's main composer, but his demo was rejected by creator Craig McCracken, who despite being a Devo fan, had concerns about his cartoon being pushed aside if a big feature film came to Mothersbaugh's production company.[24]\n\nMothersbaugh produces music for video games, including Sony's Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series (both music scores were created by Josh Mancell), and for EA Games' The Sims 2. This work is often performed with Mutato Muzika, the music production company he formed with several other former members of Devo including his brother, Bob Mothersbaugh.[12] Mothersbaugh composed the original score for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.[25]\n\nMothersbaugh composed:\n\n\"Having Trouble Sneezing\", the distinctive music in the award-winning \"Get a Mac\" commercials for Apple Inc.[26]\n\nThe score for the first season of the television series Big Love, though he was replaced after one season by David Byrne of Talking Heads.\n\nThe theme music for the American television show Eureka, broadcast on the Syfy channel.\n\nThe score of the Cartoon Network's TV series Regular Show.\n\nThe score for HBO's Close Enough alongside John Enroth and Albert Fox.\n\nThe score for HBO's Our Flag Means Death.\n\nIn 2013, Mothersbaugh appeared on an episode of The Aquabats! Super Show!, an action-comedy series by the creators of Yo Gabba Gabba! starring the Devo-influenced band The Aquabats, playing the eccentric scientist father of one of the main characters, Jimmy the Robot.[27]\n\nMothersbaugh and Casale have produced music for other artists, including Toni Basil.[28]\n\nVisual art and exhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\nMothersbaugh has also been successful as a visual artist. In November 2014, Mothersbaugh said, \"I've done over 150 art gallery shows in the last 20 years.\"[29]\n\nOn February 6, 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art Denver (MCA Denver) announced a retrospective exhibition to bring together the first comprehensive presentation of Mothersbaugh's art and music. This nationally touring exhibition was accompanied by a publication, Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia, published by Princeton Architectural Press.[30] 50 selections of postcard art from Myopia were published as a postcard book titled Mark Mothersbaugh: Collected Facts & Lies in 2015.\n\nAs a prelude to the Myopia exhibit opening in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mothersbaugh held a concert gathering which included Devo songs and movie scores played in a classical style, an address to the audience with anecdotes, and musical pieces he specifically composed for a six-keyboard hybrid originally used for teaching lessons, that was refurbished by his brother Bob and contained a counter in the center for keeping time. The instrument was played by six people simultaneously.[31][32]\n\nMothersbaugh hosted a drawing segment on the Nick Jr. Channel television series Yo Gabba Gabba! called Mark's Magic Pictures, teaching children how to draw simple pictures. The pictures often come alive at the end of the segment through animation.[33]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the age of seven, Mothersbaugh began wearing glasses to correct his severe myopia and astigmatism. Over the years, he took an interest in designing his own distinctive eyewear for use in Devo shows. He favored a set of stainless steel frames for regular use made by a Los Angeles shop called LA Eyeworks and says he purchased as many pairs as he could find because they tended to break or get stolen by fans.[34][35] In a joint venture with eyewear manufacturer Shane Baum, Mothersbaugh has designed his own branded frames for sale, made of beryllium with a stainless steel chrome finish, in three different styles as of 2015. The Baumvision press release states that the unisex model \"Francesca\" is named for one of Mothersbaugh's pug dogs which is a simultaneous hermaphrodite that is also called Frank.[35][36]\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Mothersbaugh mentioned having attention deficit disorder.[37]\n\nHe has been married twice. His first wife was actress Nancye Ferguson, who can be seen briefly performing with him in the 1999 superhero comedy film Mystery Men. His current wife is Anita Greenspan, who runs the film music managing company Greenspan Kohan Management with Neil Kohan. The couple has two daughters from China, adopted after Greenspan learned of the practice in that country of female children being abandoned because of their gender.[7]\n\nMothersbaugh is a collector and connoisseur of song poems[38] and unusual or vintage musical devices. He is the owner of Raymond Scott's Electronium (although it is currently not functional).[39]\n\nMothersbaugh contracted COVID-19 in May 2020, and was placed on a ventilator in an intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for 18 days. In August 2020, Mothersbaugh recounted that he \"nearly died\" of the disease, and was in a delusional state while infected; he came to believe that he had been hospitalized after being hit by a brick in Little Tokyo, and repeatedly urged his family members to search for his attackers.[40] He described having lasting neuropathic pain as a result of the illness.[41]\n\nMothersbaugh was once a member of the parody religion the Church of the SubGenius.[42]\n\nHonors and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nMothersbaugh was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2004 BMI Film and TV Awards. The award is given annually to a composer of film and television music.[4]\n\nOn May 10, 2008, Mothersbaugh was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University.[43]\n\nOn May 28, 2016, Mothersbaugh was awarded the key to the city of Akron during a ceremony at the Akron-Summit County Public Library.[44]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYears Title Notes 1986–1990 Pee-wee's Playhouse 1991–2006 Rugrats with Denis M.
