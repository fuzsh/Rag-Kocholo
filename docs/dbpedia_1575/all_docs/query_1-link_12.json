This was the final annual countdown in which listeners could vote for songs released in any year.\n\nThere was no poll in 1992, and from 1993 onwards, the poll was restricted to songs released the same year. Supplementary \"Hottest 100 of All Time\" polls allowing songs from any year were held in 1998 and 2009.\n\nThis was also the first poll to feature a publicly announced list of songs in positions #101 to #200.[1] The list was posted on the Triple J website in their Hottest 100 History section until late 2004 under 1992.[2] Despite this, an audio clip from the 1991 Hottest 100 features the announcer jokingly playing \"Black or White\" by Michael Jackson at the number one song before saying it was actually #113[3] (although the actual list shows it reached #112). Triple J would later reveal the #101 to #200 songs from the 2008 list onwards.\n\nFull list\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Australian artists\n\n# Song Artist Country of Origin Year of release Previous Hottest 100 of all time positions 1 Smells Like Teen Spirit Nirvana United States 1991 2 Love Will Tear Us Apart Joy Division United Kingdom 1979 1 (1989), 1 (1990) 3 Lithium Nirvana United States 1991 4 Throw Your Arms Around Me Hunters & Collectors Australia 1985 2 (1989), 2 (1990) 5 Tomorrow Wendy Andy Prieboy United States 1990 6 How Soon Is Now?
