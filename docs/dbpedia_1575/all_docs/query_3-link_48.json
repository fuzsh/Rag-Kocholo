        "text": "You are more likely to develop kidney disease if you have\n\ndiabetes\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nheart disease\n\na family history of kidney failure\n\nWhat can I do to keep my kidneys healthy?\n\nYou can protect your kidneys by preventing or managing health conditions that cause kidney damage, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The steps described below may help keep your whole body healthy, including your kidneys.\n\nDuring your next medical visit, you may want to ask your health care provider about your kidney health. Early kidney disease may not have any symptoms, so getting tested may be the only way to know your kidneys are healthy. Your health care provider will help decide how often you should be tested.\n\nSee a provider right away if you develop a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can cause kidney damage if left untreated.\n\nMake healthy food choices\n\nChoose foods that are healthy for your heart and your entire body: fresh fruits, fresh or frozen vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. Eat healthy meals, and cut back on salt and added sugars. Aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium each day. Try to have less than 10 percent of your daily calories come from added sugars.\n\nTips for making healthy food choices\n\nCook with a mix of spices instead of salt.\n\nChoose veggie toppings such as spinach, broccoli, and peppers for your pizza.\n\nTry baking or broiling meat, chicken, and fish instead of frying.\n\nServe foods without gravy or added fats.\n\nTry to choose foods with little or no added sugar.\n\nGradually work your way down from whole milk to 2 percent milk until you’re drinking and cooking with fat-free (skim) or low-fat milk and milk products.\n\nEat foods made from whole grains—such as whole wheat, brown rice, oats, and whole-grain corn—every day. Use whole-grain bread for toast and sandwiches; substitute brown rice for white rice for home-cooked meals and when dining out.\n\nRead food labels. Choose foods low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars.\n\nSlow down at snack time. Eating a bag of low-fat popcorn takes longer than eating a slice of cake. Peel and eat an orange instead of drinking orange juice.\n\nTry keeping a written record of what you eat for a week. It can help you see when you tend to overeat or eat foods high in fat or calories.\n\nResearch has shown that the DASH eating plan may help you lower your blood pressure. If you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, you may want to locate and work with a dietitian to create a meal plan that meets your needs.\n\nMake physical activity part of your routine\n\nBe active for 30 minutes or more on most days. If you are not active now, ask your health care provider about the types and amounts of physical activity that are right for you. Add more activity to your life with these tips to help you get active.\n\nAim for a healthy weight\n\nThe NIH Body Weight Planner is an online tool to help you tailor your calorie and physical activity plans to achieve and stay at a healthy weight.\n\nIf you are overweight or have obesity, work with your health care provider or dietitian to create a realistic weight-loss plan. View more weight control and physical activity resources to help you get and stay motivated.\n\nGet enough sleep\n\nAim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. If you have trouble sleeping, take steps to improve your sleep habits.\n\nStop smoking\n\nIf you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Ask for help so you don’t have to do it alone. You can start by calling the national quitline at 1-800-QUITNOW or 1-800-784-8669. For tips on quitting, go to Smokefree.gov.\n\nLimit alcohol intake\n\nDrinking too much alcohol can increase your blood pressure and add extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. If you drink alcohol, limit yourself to one drink per day if you are a woman and two drinks per day if you are a man. One drink is:\n\n12 ounces of beer\n\n5 ounces of wine\n\n1.5 ounces of liquor\n\nExplore stress-reducing activities\n\nLearning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve emotional and physical health. Physical activity can help reduce stress, as can mind and body practices such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi.\n\nManage diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease\n\nIf you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease, the best way to protect your kidneys from damage is to\n\nKeep blood glucose numbers close to your goal. Checking your blood glucose, or blood sugar, level is an important way to manage your diabetes. Your health care team may want you to test your blood glucose one or more times a day.\n\nKeep your blood pressure numbers close to your goal. The blood pressure goal for most people with diabetes is below 140/90 mm Hg. Read more about high blood pressure.\n\nTake all your medicines as prescribed. Talk with your health care provider about certain blood pressure medicines, called ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which may protect your kidneys. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan.\n\nBe careful about the daily use of over-the-counter pain medications. Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can damage your kidneys. Learn more about over-the-counter medicines and your kidneys.\n\nTo help prevent heart attacks and stroke, keep your cholesterol levels in the target range. There are two kinds of cholesterol in your blood: LDL and HDL. LDL or “bad” cholesterol can build up and clog your blood vessels, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. HDL or “good” cholesterol helps remove the “bad” cholesterol from your blood vessels. A cholesterol test also may measure another type of blood fat called triglycerides.\n\nAsk your health care provider questions\n\nAsk your health care provider the following key questions about your kidney health during your next medical visit. The sooner you know you have kidney disease, the sooner you can get treatment to help protect your kidneys.\n\nKey questions for your health care provider:\n\nWhat is my glomerular filtration rate (GFR)?\n\nWhat is my urine albumin result?\n\nWhat is my blood pressure?\n\nWhat is my blood glucose (for people with diabetes)?\n\nHow often should I get my kidneys checked?\n\nOther important questions:"
