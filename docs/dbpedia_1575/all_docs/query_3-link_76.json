        "text": "2006 speculative evolution and science fiction book by C. M. Kosemen\n\nAll Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man is a 2006 work of science fiction and speculative evolution written and illustrated by the Turkish artist C. M. Kosemen under the pen name Nemo Ramjet. It explores a hypothetical future path of human evolution set from the near future to a billion years from the present. Several future human species evolve through natural means and through genetic engineering, conducted by both humans themselves and by a mysterious and superior alien species called the Qu.\n\nInspired by the science fiction works of Olaf Stapledon and Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Kosemen worked on All Tomorrows from 2003 to the publication of the book as a free PDF file online in 2006. Kosemen intends to eventually publish a greatly expanded All Tomorrows in physical form, with new text and updated illustrations.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nCenturies following the terraforming and colonization of Mars led by humans, a brief but catastrophic interplanetary war takes place between Mars and Earth costing both parties billions of lives. The two planets eventually make peace with each other, and a large-scale colonization initiative is carried out by genetically engineered humans called Star People throughout the galaxy.\n\nHumans (now Star People) then encounter a malevolent and superior alien species called the Qu. The Qu's religion motivates them to remake the universe through genetic engineering. A short war follows in which humanity is defeated. The Qu bioengineer the surviving humans as punishment into a range of exotic forms, many of them unintelligent. After forty million years of domination, the Qu leave the galaxy, leaving the altered humans to evolve on their own. The bioengineered humans range from worm-like humans to insectivores and modular and cell-based species. The book follows the progress of these new humans as they either go extinct or regain sapience in wildly different forms and gradually discover that the Qu experimented on them.\n\nOne species, known as the Ruin Haunters, replaces their bodies with mechanical forms using the technology the Qu had left, now known as the Gravitals. They begin to colonize the rest of the galaxy while annihilating most life within it, including the other post-human species (except for Bug Facers whom in a similar fashion like that of the Qu are genetically modified by the Gravitals for their own gain). They are, themselves, destroyed by the Asteromorphs, the descendants of the human species who escaped experimentation by the Qu, the remaining Gravitals are then re-modified into less sophisticated machines to serve as a labor by the Asteromorphs. The final chapters of the book detail humanity's rebound as a posthuman species, their first contact with another galaxy's life, rediscovering and defeating the Qu after five-hundred million years, and concluding with the rediscovery of Earth 560 million years in the future.\n\nAll Tomorrows ends with a picture of the book's in-universe author, an alien researcher, holding a billion-year-old human skull and writing that all posthuman species disappeared a billion years in the future, for unknown reasons. The author goes on to state that mankind's story was always about the lives of humans themselves, not major wars and abstract ideals. The author ends by encouraging the reader to \"Love Today, and seize All Tomorrows!\"\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nKosemen worked on All Tomorrows from 2003 to 2006. The work of Olaf Stapledon, particularly Last and First Men (1930) and Star Maker (1937), served as the main inspiration for the work, alongside Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.[1]\n\nAll Tomorrows is written in the style of a historical work, narrated by an alien creature recounting the history of humanity. According to Kosemen, the \"tone of voice is a high school student fanboying on the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon\". The artwork is also reflective of this \"archaeological\" approach, with faded and textured visual effects applied to the paintings. The original reason for adding the faded tint to the paintings was Kosemen wanting to avoid the paintings looking like \"horrible racist caricatures\".[1]\n\nThe book was released for free online as a PDF on 4 October 2006 and has since then, per Kosemen himself, \"had a life of its own as a PDF floating around the backwaters of the internet like a ghost ship\". One of the common links which All Tomorrows has been shared through is a wiki site dedicated to speedrunning.[1]\n\nThe first licensed physical edition of All Tomorrows was published by Time Publishing in March 2024, in the Thai language. This edition included the content of the original 2006 book, with a new chapter on the making of the book and some additional artwork by other artists.[2]\n\nAll Tomorrows is yet to be physically published in English, however in July 2024 preorders on the crowdfunding site Unbound began for official hardback and e-book editions in the English language, including additional materials and artwork and the intent to publish in 2025.[3]\n\nReception and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginally an obscure work, All Tomorrows slowly gained popularity online following its 2006 publication.[4] In a 2021 podcast interview, Kosemen noted that the generation born right after him (Kosemen having been born in 1984) \"really embraced\" All Tomorrows, which he believes might partially be due to the \"myriad disasters\" that have happened in the world since then.[1] The book has received some scholarly attention; in 2020, All Tomorrows was among the works discussed in Jörg Matthias Determann's book Islam, Science Fiction and Extraterrestrial Life, which explores astrobiology and science fiction in the Muslim world.[5] Following the upload of an abridged version of the book's story by YouTuber Alt Shift X in June 2021,[6] All Tomorrows saw a particular surge in popularity online during the summer of 2021.[4] Among other things, there was a surge of internet memes based on the book, primarily on YouTube and Twitter[7] as well as fan art based on the creatures in the book.[6]\n\nReaders have characterized All Tomorrows as \"bizarre\", \"inexplicable\", \"interesting\" and \"fascinating\", and as a work incorporating body horror.[8] Ivan Farkas of Cracked.com called All Tomorrows \"existentially freak-ay\" in 2021 and described the artwork as \"otherwordly\".[9] A 2022 article by Andrea Viscusi on the Italian media website Stay Nerd compared All Tomorrows to Man After Man (1990) by Dougal Dixon, also a work tackling future human evolution, but found the depictions in All Tomorrows to be \"even more disturbing\", yet still possible on an \"almost subliminal level\" to \"recognize as our fellow men\".[10] In a 2022 article in the lifestyle magazine A Little Bit Human, Allia Luzong considered All Tomorrows to be a \"fun exploration of what could be\" but also a serious work with serious themes, particularly noting how humanity's social ills are present throughout the narrative.[6]\n\nKosemen stated in 2021 that though the book had grown popular, he had almost \"disowned\" All Tomorrows, finding parts of it \"a bit cringey\".[1] When designing his website and including his different books and projects, Kosemen purposefully left out All Tomorrows.[4] Following the summer of 2021, he has since added the book to his website[11] and intends to eventually publish All Tomorrows in physical form with new text and illustrations.[4] By 16 October 2022, Kosemen had written the expanded version up until the Qu's conquest of the galaxy. Kosemen stated that the material up until that point amounted to 200 pages, almost twice the length of the entire original book.[12] Kosemen continues to work on the expanded version as of 2024.[2] In April 2024 he has announced the release of a physical copy of the book, but only in Thai language. Although being the original version of the book, it is stated to comprehend a few illustrations made by other artists and a new chapter, with various informations about the species. This new chapter is only available in Thai. At the same time, Kosemen has also stated that he is continuing his work on the new version of the book, that has now reached nearly over 300 pages, with still many species to talk about. Every species has now a deeper lore, and new major plot twists have been added.
