It is based on the 2012 Brazilian series Como Aproveitar o Fim do Mundo (How to Enjoy the End of the World), which aired on Rede Globo in 2012. The show was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. No Tomorrow was canceled on May 8, 2017; five days later, an epilogue to the series was released.[3][4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series follows a woman who lives in Seattle and becomes involved with a free-spirited man who inspires her to make an \"apocalyst\", a list of things to do before the world ends—which he claims will be in eight months and twelve days. With the help of her friends, they try to find out if he can be taken seriously while completing the bucket list.[5]\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nTori Anderson as Evie Covington, a bored middle-manager employed in a supply warehouse who pushes herself into Xavier's carefree world.\n\nJoshua Sasse as Xavier Holliday, an eccentric, free-spirited individual who believes that the world will come to an end in eight months and plots to live life as fully as he can.\n\nJonathan Langdon as Hank Barkley, Evie's cheerful co-worker.\n\nSarayu Blue as Kareema, Evie's grumpy and cynical co-worker.\n\nJesse Rath as Timothy Finger, Evie's former boyfriend.\n\nAmy Pietz as Deirdre Hackmeyer, Evie's shallow boss.\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nGeorge Basil as Jesse, Xavier's cousin.\n\nTed McGinley as Gary, Evie's father.\n\nKelly Stables as Mary Anne, Evie's older sister.\n\nGigi Rice as Gloria, Evie's mother.\n\nVinny Chhibber as Rohan, Kareema's brother.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air dateProd.\n\ncodeU.S. viewers\n\n(millions)1\"Pilot\"Brad SilberlingCorinne Brinkerhoff & Scott McCabe & Tory StantonOctober 4, 2016 ( )1011.51[6] 2\"No Crying in Baseball\"Stuart GillardMaggie Friedman & Tory Stanton & Scott McCabeOctober 11, 2016 ( )1020.74[7] 3\"No Doubt\"John PutchRichard HatemOctober 18, 2016 ( )1030.81[8] 4\"No Holds Barred\"Jeff MelmanJenna LamiaOctober 25, 2016 ( )1040.78[9] 5\"No Regrets\"Ron UnderwoodBill KrebsNovember 1, 2016 ( )1050.76[10] 6\"No Debts Remain Unpaid\"Allan ArkushJustin W.

On Rotten Tomatoes the season has a rating of 91%. The site's critical consensus reads, \"No Tomorrow is a gentle, easy to digest rom-com that serves up a strong supporting cast, charming lead performances, and a hefty dose of fun.\"[19] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 23 critics.[20]\n\nThe editors of TV Guide placed No Tomorrow eighth among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016–2017 season. In its review, Sadie Gennis wrote\n\n\"Tori Anderson and Joshua Sasse are infectiously charming in this offbeat romantic comedy about a woman who discovers that her dream man is an apocalypse truther. It's a weird premise, sure, but No Tomorrow leans into its own absurdity, populating the show with surreal, strange characters (including one who speaks so quietly he needs subtitles) and delightful prop comedy that is rarely seen in one-hour shows. And while it's unlikely that No Tomorrow will help the CW continue its Golden Globes streak, it fits in perfectly on the network alongside fellow genre-pushing rom-coms Jane the Virgin and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\"[21]\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nViewership and ratings per episode of No Tomorrow No. Title Air date Rating/share\n\n(18–49) Viewers\n\n(millions) 1 \"Pilot\" October 4, 2016 0.5/2 1.51[6] 2 \"No Crying in Baseball\" October 11, 2016 0.2/1 0.74[7] 3 \"No Doubt\" October 18, 2016 0.3/1 0.81[8] 4 \"No Holds Barred\" October 25, 2016 0.3/1 0.78[9] 5 \"No Regrets\" November 1, 2016 0.3/1 0.76[10] 6 \"No Debts Remain Unpaid\" November 15, 2016 0.3/1 0.80[11] 7 \"No You Say it First\" November 22, 2016 0.3/1 0.80[12] 8 \"No Rest for the Weary\" November 29, 2016 0.3/1 0.94[13] 9 \"No Truer Words\" December 6, 2016 0.3/1 0.80[14] 10 \"No Soup for You\" December 27, 2016 0.2/1 0.60[15] 11 \"No Woman No Cry\" January 3, 2017 0.2/1 0.51[16] 12 \"No Time Like the Present\" January 10, 2017 0.2/1 0.70[17] 13 \"No Sleep 'Til Reykjavik\" January 17, 2017 0.2/1 0.58[18]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
