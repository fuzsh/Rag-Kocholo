What a wonderful encounter! Yes... I only wish there was a world for just you and I: the Prince and the Princess. Don't worry. I'll set you free.\n\n—Wendy to Jennifer in a letter\n\n”\n\nWendy is a character in Rule of Rose. She is introduced as a sweet and kind girl who is the only one pleasant to Jennifer, and was Jennifer's childhood girlfriend. However, it is eventually revealed she was the secret founder of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. Wendy uses her innocent appearance to her advantage in order to avoid suspicion.\n\nShe is a frail sickly child who often coughs because of her unspecified sickness. She is often bedridden and is known as the \"girl who always lays in her bed\" or, to older Jennifer, as \"The Lonely Princess.\"\n\nAppearance[]\n\nWendy is a little girl with a pale complexion. Her most notable trait is her blonde straight hair and her typically wearing a hat. She also has blue eyes. Clothing wise, her typical outfit consists of a baby blue dress with a white apron atop it, her sun hat, brown shoes and short socks. Whenever she is in the sick room, she instead wears a no-sleeve sleeping gown.\n\nHer Princess of the Red Rose outfit is her most elaborate, bearing resemblance to the doll in the club room. Consisting of reds, she wears a red dress with a white bow and white frills at the skirt area, white tights, brown formal shoes, and a red and white hat tied to her chin. When disguising as Joshua, she puts on a wig alongside black shorts and a white button-up with a green ribbon tie,\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWendy is initially seen as admirable, sweet and caring, and is the only one who is nice to Jennifer - at least for a while. She appears innocent because of her gentle and frail appearance. Wendy and Jennifer were both best friends and lovers. Wendy had to stay in the sick room due to her frail health, which was why she was always lonely and had few friends. This caused her to be unhealthily obsessed with Jennifer, feeling betrayed once the girl focuses on Brown. Wendy hides her jealousy and anger over Jennifer's attachment to Brown, and instead, temporarily accepts it and considers the dog of no importance. Wendy seems very desperate for love and affection, possibly due to being an orphan with no sources of love in her life.\n\nIn regards to the other orphans, minus Amanda most of the seem to show respect towards her. She convinced them all that Stray Dog was real to the point where Meg would record notes on it. Wendy also appears to have an interest in toys. She specifically likes dolls and teddy bears as she traded her brooch for Jennifer's bear. Said bear always sits next to a porcelain doll representing Wendy.\n\nBiography[]\n\nA lot of Wendy's early history is unknown, except that she is an orphan at Rose Garden Orphanage.\n\nIn November 1929, Wendy explored the rural area outside of the orphanage when she found \"The Gingerbread House\" where Gregory M. Wilson lived. She saw a basement window, and inside, saw what appeared to be a boy, who was actually Jennifer dressed in Joshua's clothing. She started to pass notes through the window, presumably through a crack in the window, back and forth between herself and Jennifer, while eventually Jennifer revealed herself to be a girl. She and Wendy were such close friends that they nicknamed each other Prince and Princess, and Jennifer did not mind being the Prince.\n\nOne night (implied to be January 28, 1930), Wendy helped Jennifer escape the house and move into the orphanage. Just before leaving Gregory's house, she took his gun in a bag. She gave Jennifer her rose brooch in exchange for a stuffed bear.\n\nWendy was the girl who started the Stray Dog rumors, leading to the foundation of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. She probably began it because she was bedridden and lonely, and if other children listened to her, she could receive attention. After the incident when she rescued Jennifer, she told everyone in the orphanage the rumors about how Stray Dog would kidnap children. Due to the fright and curiosity that it caused them, they allowed her to become the Princess of the Red Rose. Due to Wendy being bedridden most of time, she was substituted with a doll resembling her.\n\nJennifer eventually found another companion - an abandoned puppy she later named Brown. Wendy became increasingly jealous because Jennifer gradually spent more time with Brown instead of Wendy, apparently considering Brown to be nothing more than a filthy animal. In a fit of rage, Wendy demanded that all of the orphanage belittle Jennifer and treat her poorly, so that she would eventually forget Brown and return to her side. This failed, however, so Wendy demanded that they kill Brown as a last resort.\n\nIn late November 1930, When Brown was killed and Wendy revealed herself to Jennifer as the Princess of the Red Rose, Jennifer slapped Wendy to the ground, telling her to \"go away!\" and swearing to never forgive her. Heartbroken and humiliated, Wendy ran out the room in tears. Wendy was dethroned from the Aristocracy, and Jennifer became the new Princess of the Red Rose.\n\nOn December 20, 1930, Wendy returned to the orphanage disguised as Joshua. Everyone saw Wendy outside, and the orphans of the home ran outside to presumably mock her. However, Wendy had a mentally unstable Gregory M. Wilson (Stray Dog) with her, whom she had trained to act like an animal and obey her orders. Stray Dog kills all of the orphans, excluding Jennifer who was still inside. It is likely that Wendy simply wanted to prove to the orphans Stray Dog as real and that she never intended for him to murder everyone, since Wendy says, \"I brought Stray Dog here... But, I... I...\" with a sad expression when she learns the orphans died.\n\nAfter Jennifer saved herself from Stray Dog, she made it outside, where Wendy apologized in tears, and handed Jennifer the gun she took from Gregory's home. After that, Gregory noticed that the one imitating Joshua was not actually his son and dragged her inside the orphanage, killing her.\n\nRule of Rose[]\n\nYears after the orphanage massacre, Jennifer has grown up but has forgotten her childhood memories. She apparently still carries Wendy's rose brooch with her. Since the game is set in Jennifer's mind and much of it is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood memories, the Wendy seen in the game is akin to a dream character. She is first seen in her Joshua disguise at the bus and leading Jennifer to the orphanage. For the former, she gives her a mostly-blank book before running off. When the teenager arrives at the clubroom, \"Joshua\" asks her to read the story right before the funeral announcement. She then disappears for the remainder of the chapter.\n\nJoshua later greets a tied up Jennifer and explains the gift rules. After which, she frees her from her ropes and later runs off. Undisguised Wendy is first seen on the airship feeding the rabbits, likely one of the chores given to her by Martha Carol, or merely one of her favorite hobbies. Peter was Wendy's rabbit, and she obtained him around the same time Jennifer found Brown, but Wendy eventually got rid of him.\n\nIn the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, Peter goes missing and it is up to Jennifer to find him. Wendy is in bed sick, commenting that 'Mr. Bunny' is gone and was taken by the aristocrats. The sickroom wall now has a drawing by Wendy of a gingerbread house. After Peter is found, Wendy has the aristocrats reward Jennifer by raising her rank and having her punish Amanda.\n\nIn the \"Gingerbread House\" chapter, which is Jennifer reliving her memories of living with Gregory, Jennifer becomes locked in Gregory's basement. In said basement, a variety of letters can be found between the two girls. Wendy, seeing Jennifer in Joshua's room, sneaks into the house and unlocks the door. Jennifer meets with Wendy, and just before they make their escape, Wendy swipes Gregory's pistol. In the rose garden, Jennifer exchanges stuffed bear she found inside Gregory's house with Wendy's rose brooch. Wendy then names the bear Joshua.\n\nIn the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter, Amanda accuses Wendy of stealing Joshua the bear. In Wendy's room, Jennifer finds her lying on the floor, out of bed. Helping her back into bed, Wendy claims that the Aristocrats came and accused her of stealing Joshua the bear. Since Wendy is \"Joshua\", this is true in a way.\n\nIn \"The Funeral\" chapter, when the orphanage becomes swarmed with Imps, Jennifer sees Wendy through a window. The door to the courtyard is shut and after defeating various types of Imps scattered through the orphanage, the door becomes unlocked. In the courtyard, Wendy tells Jennifer that an important Aristocrat Club meeting is about to take place. Jennifer reads the storybook entitled \"The Funeral\", and when she is finished, she realizes that Brown and Wendy have disappeared.\n\nIn the club room, Jennifer has a hallucination of Brown's corpse. The Aristocrats appear, and Wendy reveals to Jennifer that she is the Princess of the Red Rose. Amanda whispers into Jennifer's ear that Brown is dead and points towards a bloodied sack with a large lump inside. Jennifer, fueled with rage, slaps Wendy several times, calling her a liar and vows to never forgive her. Jennifer then stands up to the Aristocrats, calling them monsters for siding with Wendy, and throws her rose brooch towards them. Wendy, humiliated and heartbroken, runs out the room sobbing.\n\nIn the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\", Susan sees Wendy outside the orphanage window. The girls, prepared to go outside and ridicule Wendy, head outside the orphanage. Jennifer, however, decides to stay inside. This is when Stray Dog, who came to the orphanage with Wendy, kills everyone. Jennifer hears screaming outside and silently stands in fear of what to do. Suddenly, the front door to the orphanage opens. Joshua and the \"Stray Dog\" Gregory stand at the entrance. Joshua sets him to attack Jennifer and after a battle, Brown aids Jennifer.\n\nAfter defeating Gregory, Jennifer proceeds outside to find Joshua. Wendy proceeds to remove the wig and reveal her identity. She tells Jennifer that she brought Stray Dog for her own selfish reasons. Wendy apologizes and gives Jennifer Gregory's gun. Stray Dog then silently takes Wendy away and kills her off-screen. He then faces Jennifer once more.\n\nIn the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer seems to feel sorry for Wendy, stating that she was \"always so lonely\". In the end, she locks Wendy inside her memories, as she does Brown and the rest of the children of the orphanage, remembering her for the good times they had together, rather than her wrongdoings.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nJennifer[]\n\nWendy originally met Jennifer when she was trapped by Gregory. As such, she mistook her for a boy. As the two wrote to each other, they began to fall in love. Wendy would soon help Jennifer escape. Although she would later find out Jennifer was a girl, she still felt romantic feelings towards her. The two would declare to love each other forevermore.\n\nAfter Jennifer finds Brown, Wendy grew bitter towards her. She offered to have them both take care of the dog, only for Wendy to declare she just get rid of it. This would result in Wendy enlisting the help of the aristocrats to bully Jennifer for several months. Because Jennifer promised to protect Brown though, nothing changed. As a last resort, she declared Brown be murdered. After his death, Jennifer proceeds to slap Wendy multiple times and got rid of her brooch. Younger Jennifer also proclaimed to hate Wendy alongside the aristocrats and to never forgive her.\n\nDuring the massacre, Wendy realizes her wrongdoings and gives Gregory’s gun to her. As an adult, Jennifer attempts to look more positively towards her. She keeps her brooch and also calls her lonely. She also positively remembers instances of them playing or kissing. While Jennifer is still traumatized from what happened, she doesn't think Wendy deserves to be forgotten. Like the other orphanage residents, Jennifer locks Wendy in her memories and refuses to forget them ever again.\n\nBrown[]\n\nWendy hates Brown. She finds him to be disgusting and an annoyance. However, her primary reason for hating him is Jennifer’s attachment to the dog. Wendy felt betrayed and that she loved him more. Thus, as a last resort, she has Brown be murdered. In regards to Brown’s thoughts, as a dog, he never growls at her. Furthermore, he willingly lets Wendy touch him and take him away during the Funeral chapter. He likely didn’t expect/comprehend what would later happen to him.\n\nDiana[]\n\nAs the self-proclaimed leader of the club, Diana is in charge of enacting the wishes of the Princess. Wendy will proclaim the monthly gift while Diana punishes those who don’t follow. Diana alongside the other children also believed in Stray Dog. This would thus have her listen to Wendy despite being older. After Wendy is dethroned, she has a more negative view on her and leaves to bully her right before the massacre.\n\nMeg[]\n\nMeg is in charge of announcing the Princess’ messages. She was the one to reveal Jennifer’s social rank was increased for Wendy. She also claims to occasionally report to Wendy in regards to slackers or Stray Dog. She uses her abilities to also create torture devices for the club. After Wendy was dethroned though, she instead favors Jennifer. There is cut dialogue where Meg mentions going to check on what Wendy is up to as everyone rushes downstairs.\n\nClara[]\n\nIn various cut animations, Clara is seen taking care of Wendy in the sickroom. Even without this, there are implications she and Hoffman are the two characters who take care of Wendy. Wendy and Clara are both almost always in the sickbay or sickroom. Thus, typically Clara is in charge of helping the younger girl. Their thoughts on each other are unknown though. Clara was not a member of the club, thus she didn’t see Wendy as a leader at least.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe name Wendy was a created name in J. M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan. It was from the nickname \"fwendy\" (friend), given to the author by a young friend. This can relate to the friendship between Wendy and Jennifer, and - ironically - her unfriendly behavior when Brown comes along. Likewise, Jennifer can be seen as symbolic of Peter Pan (for more info, see Jennifer's Trivia).\n\nWendy also relates to the Welsh name Gwendolen, meaning \"white, fair, blessed.\" These elements can relate to her physical looks, or merely in reference to her cruel behavior in the game compared to her innocent appearance. The \"white\" meaning also appears in Jennifer's name.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nW & J Letters\n\n\"To Mr. Joshua, the bear in distress. My name is Wendy. I always watch you from the sky. Mr. Joshua, why are you trapped down there?\"\n\n\"Let's run away together. You can leave it all to me. Everything will be alright.\"\n\n\"...Oh my poor kind prince. You're worried because that man sometimes seems crazy, right? Well don't worry. I know where he hides that awful thing of his. So let's run away together. You can leave it all to me. Everything will be all right.\"\n\n\"Please don't worry, I'll do anything for you. Just... pledge your love for me. That's all I ask.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow night, I shall unlock your shackles. Let us live together forever.\"\n\n\"My Dear Jennifer, there is nothing to fear. I am always by your side. I will never betray you. We made an oath remember?\"\n\n\"Thank you for introducing me to Brown. …But, such a filthy dog is not a good match for you and me. Just give it to Nicholas or something, and let's just be content with the two of us.\"\n\n\"Is Brown that important to you? It's just a dog. A filthy animal. Please stop sharing your wonderful smile with that thing... Please smile only at me.\"\n\n\"Jennifer the Heartless, why didn't you come? I waited and waited for you. Why can't I see you every morning? I think only of you… Are you avoiding me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are my Prince. A Prince and a Princess must be together, after all, Jennifer, you are my eternal companion. Just promise to stay by my side, and save your smiles for me. That's all I ask. We don't need a filthy dog! We can't let anyone come between us.\"\n\n\"You still have that filthy dog? I'll never forgive you. Have you forgotten your oath, the rule of rose? Good-bye, Jennifer. You will regret choosing that dog over me.\"\n\nRule of Rose\n\n\"Jennifer, you know you've been a bad, bad girl. And, bad girls need to be punished, don't they?\" (disguised as Joshua)\n\n\"Now, I'm going to give you your first order. Every month, you need to find a gift and bring it to the Aristocrat Club. If you don't, I'll kill you. Is there anything about this that you don't understand?\" (disguised as Joshua)\n\n\"Hmm. Oh well, it's doesn't really matter what you say. You see, Jennifer, there are really only two kinds of people in the world: those who take orders, and those who give them. And from now on, I'll be giving the orders. Not fair? Well, dear Jennifer, nothing's fair here. You will follow my orders, or else, for I am the Prince, and the Prince rules! This is YOUR life, but you'll play by MY rules! Let the games begin, dear Jen-ni-fer!\" (disguised as Joshua)\n\n\"You're the new girl, aren't you? I'm Wendy. It's nice to meet you.\"\n\n\"No one wants to be alone.\"\n\n\"I came, just like I promised... Stay right there. I'll help you out.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad... Now, we can always be together! Say, I have a favor I wanted to ask... Will you trade your teddy bear with my broach?\"\n\n\"I'm so happy! ...I'll cherish him as much as I cherish you.\"\n\n\"So, let's renew our pact... Everlasting true love, I am yours.\"\n\n\"Thank you... After promising to take care of him... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...\"\n\n\"So this is your new friend, huh? It's so filthy, but adorable... Oh, yes. Jennifer, there will be an Aristocrat Club meeting after this. Today will be the most wonderful day. I hope you enjoy it.\"\n\nBecause you wouldn't love me... Because you were so stubborn... I brought you here. Because you fell in love with Brown... Because you didn't realize it was me... I brought Stray Dog here... But, I... I... Please, stop him with this... Only you and your beloved dog can stop him... I'm sorry...\"\n\n\"Jennifer? Where are you going? Please... don't leave me.\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWendy is symbolic of the \"lying princess\" in the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\" storybook.\n\nWendy drew a picture of herself with Jennifer dressed as Joshua, found in her airship room. She also drew a rabbit, likely Peter. Wendy also has difficulty writing \"rabbit\".\n\nAlthough it is obvious that Wendy is a sick child, due to her coughing fits and the large amount of time she spends in bed, it is not known what illness she has. She appears to have an extremely weak immune system, which could possibly explain why she was so often ill.\n\nIt is possible that her prolonged contact with Joshua the Bear (i.e., the real Joshua's old teddy bear) gave her Joshua's respiratory disease. Thus, it may be the same disease Joshua had.\n\nStory Concepts[]\n\nIn the game's files, evidence suggests that Wendy was originally to be called \"Marie Belle.\" This was in reference to the real life murderer Mary Bell. It was likely changed to prevent connections to real life events.[1]\n\nThere is various cut content regarding Wendy.[1]\n\nUnused audio of Wendy (as Joshua) tormenting Jennifer.[2]\n\nAn unused animation of Jennifer being thrown to the floor and being hugged by Wendy.\n\nUnused animation of Gregory comforting a sad Wendy/Joshua.\n\nAn unused animation of Clara taking care of a sick Wendy.\n\nEarly test models for Wendy gave her a dark blue dress instead.\n\nAfter Jennifer leaves the orphanage in Once Upon a Time, Wendy was to ask “Where are you going?”\n\nSee also[]\n\nW & J Letters - Letters exchanged between Wendy and Jennifer\n\nJ's Diary - A shared diary between Wendy and Jennifer that is not accessible in the game\n\nGallery[]\n\nto see the gallery of Wendy click on Wendy/Gallery.\n\nReferences[]\n\nNavigation[]"
