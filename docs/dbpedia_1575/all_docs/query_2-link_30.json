        "text": "Sessions, sessions, sessions. It was sessions all day for me today. Sunday is usually a big sessions day for me. Tony in Sydney, Doug in Wappinger Falls, Brian in Florida and Mike in New Orleans. Just four today (it was six last Sunday and five so far for next Sunday). I guess Sunday is a day to do this if you work all week and have to deal with the commute, dinner, family, domestic stuff and then getting up early the next morning to do it all again. The weekends must be great! Ha ha, us musician types don’t see the weekends in the same way. If you’re on tour, Friday/Saturday are usually the biggest nights and when you’re not, the significance of the days is not as acute because routine is not the way of life. So for most people, Saturday/Sunday is the free time to get things done, have some fun, catch up with friends, hang with the family, indulge yourself in that secret project in the shed or perhaps speak to me. The sessions are great, communicating about music, analyzing what needs to be done, evolving, studying the creative process and then unleashing the results on the universe. Long may they continue and let me tell you watching the sessioneers progress is inspiring. Also let me tell you, it’s not a competition and if you do this with me and feel that you don’t have the time to put the work in then that’s fine. Loving music is enough, it’s supposed to be fun.\n\nSad to hear Kenny Rogers died. When I was a kid he sang one of my favourite songs, Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love To Town. Before he became a mega country star sensation he was in a band called The First Edition. This song reached No.6 in the USA and No.2 in the UK in 1969, I was 11 at the time. Younger folks may remember the version by ex Heavy Metal Kids singer Gary Holton and Norwegian Casino Steel, released in 1981, a No.1 single in Norway in 1982. Like his super famous hit, Lucille, Rogers knew how to pick a song with a heartbreaking lyric. Ruby deals with a Vietnam vet returning paralyzed trying to convince his wife not to go out on the town to look for a lover, like Lucille, really tragic. The song was written by Country legend Mel Tillis and recorded initially by another country legend, Waylon Jennings. A slew of other country stars have recorded it. Oddly it was also recorded by Leonard Nimoy and German Synth Pop duo Wolfsheim. Then there’s the other language versions – Nana Mouskouri anyone (one of my dad’s faves)? RIP Kenny, I hear you were a good man.\n\nOur friend and local folky singer-songwriter Libby came into the studio today. She’s been trying to get in here for weeks and today it finally happened. She had a lovely song called In This Game. Olivia played violin on it and I ran in between sessions with half an hour to spare and put a solo on it using Dare’s Gibson. Libby is a gem, when she’s not being creative and spreading kindness, she’s raising money for the less fortunate. You can download the song here and check her out on her bandcamp page that Olivia just set up for her.\n\nI’ve been trying to avoid the news today and trying to forget that there’s an outside. I was thinking about the pharaohs and that when they died they were often buried in sealed rooms with their handmaidens and slaves to accompany them as they journeyed into the afterlife. I wondered if they actually had to be dead, too, to do that or they were allowed to accompany them when they were still alive? I guess the concept of we’re all equal in death if not in life had little meaning in those barbaric times when some were gods and others were slaves. Nowadays some people out there still believe this bullshit.\n\nI was playing records tonight by Freedom (good segue). I guess they became little too Hard Rock for some as 1971 approached with their Through The Years album, but initially they sounded a bit more like a cross between a Beat group and Creedence. On the Freedom At Last album (1970) there’s a cool version of The Beatles’ Cry Baby Cry and The Zombies’ Time Of The Season. Drummer Bobby Harrison was the singer and leader of the group, Ray Royer initially played guitar, they were both members of Procol Harum (Royer played guitar on A Whiter Shade Of Pale). They made one soundtrack album in 1969 for an Italian Movie, Nero Su Bianco (Black On White) directed by avant-garde director Tinto Brass before Harrison completely changed the line-up to Roger Saunders on guitar and Walter Monaghan on bass. By some miracle I have Roger Saunders’ album from 1972. I only ever saw it once. According to the sleeve notes Freedom were still together when the solo album was released but they broke up the same year and Harrison went on to form Snafu with ex Juicy Lucy guitarist Mick Moody, who ended up in Whitesnake would you believe.\n\nIn the sixties Keith West was in a band called Tomorrow with Steve Howe who would later join the classic Yes line-up and Twink from The Pretty Things who would later join Pink Fairies. After Tomorrow West had a solo hit with the sixties classic Excerpt From A Teenage Opera. What happened next? Well, he made an album, Wherever My Love Goes (1974), for the German label Kuckuck and then formed the band Moonrider in 1975 before disappearing from commercial sight. The solo album is pretty tame and why Punk Rock was necessary but once he was what Punk Rock was but ten years earlier as a Psychedelic hipster with his finger on the pulse of the vital music of the day. The old people were once the young people.\n\nI also played two albums by Jess Roden’s Bronco, Country Home (1970) and Ace Of Sunlight (1971). Roden had left The Alan Bown Set and after these two albums would go solo. They were some kind of English country version of Free, not as consistently Bluesy. The guitarist was Robbie Blunt who showed up with Michael Des Barres in Silverhead and later played with Robert Plant on those initial post Zep solo albums. What I love about the post sixties and pre-Punk seventies albums is the Rock warmth. Especially the drum sounds and somehow even the shrieking and screaming sounded cosy.\n\nI had an idea tonight that I could add a song to the blog that I’ve either co-written with a project or a song of my own. There’s so many recorded songs out there that it’s hard to know where to start, for me or for you. The saving of the environment will continue to be high on the priority list once we get through the virus fight, as we will, we must, we really have to change the world.\n\nRunning Through Your Fingers\n\nI believe in wondrous things\n\nI can hear the planets sing\n\nAnd they glow in reds and blues\n\nAnd they’re mad at their abuse\n\nAnd we limp to the future\n\nBandaged and bleeding\n\nChallenged by the need for sacrifice\n\nResponsibility and such\n\nBut when you look at what we’ve got\n\nIs it really that much\n\nCan’t you see\n\nIt’s running through your fingers\n\nRunning through your fingers\n\nJust take your hands and stop it\n\nRunning through your fingers\n\nIf I must, I’ll spell it out\n\nWho on Earth could harbour doubt\n\nCan’t you see that just one soul\n\nIs a piece in the crucial whole\n\nI can’t make a difference\n\nSomeone else will fix it\n\nWhen simple acts of habit\n\nAre all you need to change\n\nJust rein in a little bit\n\nIs that so hard to arrange\n\nCan’t you see\n\nIt’s running through your fingers\n\nRunning through your fingers\n\nJust take your hands and stop it\n\nRunning through your fingers\n\n(Willson-Piper/Mason)\n\nNoctorum – Honey Mink Forever (2011)\n\nToday we were finally allowed to announce this year’s Record Store Day release. The clouds rolled across the sky in a stampede of fluff and wet wool…Oh, you wanted to know about RSD? Ok, fair enough. This year it will be a limited (red) vinyl release of Nightjar which until now (or April 18th) has only seen the world as a CD. It’s a lovely gatefold with some more drawings that I did at the time in the same style as the cover art. The first 700 people to buy it will get a free trip to Mars. If you were still looking for Hanging Out In Heaven, released last year, I do believe there are a few left, but they will all be gone by the end of the year, you can get in touch with Schoolkids Records to order it and party like it was 2019. I must get one myself.\n\nOther hot news (it’s pouring in today with the rain) – we got a new sofa in the archive. It’s taken so long to find the right one. It’s the perfect size and red as all sofas should be. Sitting in it now my body can’t believe how comfortable it is. We had a futon couch in here before and the frame was breaking more and more each day till it eventually looked like a spilled pancake mix.\n\nNow we have to dispose of it. I thought chop it up for firewood, but if there’s one thing I don’t have in the archive it’s an axe…actually.\n\nI started today with the sound of a pagan drum and perhaps a silver band? It was as clear as a medieval court and I rushed out to photograph some close ups of French horns and tubas. But when I got into the street they had gone. I saw people walking up from Morrab Gardens and ran down there, but a lady told me that they were no longer there. I ran into the town, frantically searching, listening on the slight wind, but there was no brass, no silver and no sacrificed virgins. They had disappeared into the black mist of tousled locks and spells.\n\nI headed to Simeon’s coffee truck, the alternative centre of Penzance. There, Simeon made me a perfect decaf and I got into a conversation with some locals about the glory days of the Penzance music scene in the sixties and seventies when all the bands would come down here and play at the Winter Gardens. Queen, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Yes, The Sex Pistols, The Vibrators, Talking Heads, The Ramones, Donovan, Mike Chapman, Al Stewart, Bert Jansch, Fairport Convention and then all the other bands I have records by like Family, Strife, Curved Air, Caravan, Gentle Giant, the list is endless. What happened?\n\nI also met David at Simeon’s, he described himself as a dawn photographer. He was telling us about an event he wanted to put on down at the art deco open air pool on the seafront with lasers and blimps. There’s often an interesting crowd gathered around Simeon’s van, for many reasons, he’s cool, the coffee is hot and proper and it all happens out of a Citroen, what’s not to like?\n\nBecause the sofa is so exciting (I’m still sitting here and still comfortable) I must tell you about the job Charlie and Ben had getting it down the stairs as in, it wouldn’t fit. Quite a problem after buying it, getting it delivered and dismantling what we had and clearing everything out of the way so there was a pathway to its final resting place. It was obvious what we had to do, take the bannister off the staircase. This hadn’t been moved since 1896 and the paint underneath told a story of another world. Also the bannister was ‘L’ shaped and a little awkward (I once knew an awkward barrister). The moment of truth, it was like the rescue scene in a disaster movie, the last resort. It slid down those stairs like an ice cream on a plate of glass, 1mm to spare. The risky life we lead with our dangerous big red sofa.\n\nI also had two seshes today, one with Matt in Brooklyn and one with Jed in Minneapolis. How come my sessioneers are so cool? The effort, the listening, the practice and the evolution. Wonderful.\n\nSo running around like a nutter today chasing phantoms, hearing things, seeing things, moving things and specifically listening to things. I finally got to David Axelrod’s Seriously Deep (1970), interesting, but I would say only for completists. Then there was Future Legends by Fruupp, Northern Irish Progressive Rock from 1973. Some Trower at the BBC and Hendrix at the Isle of White on CD. Fun CD of the day was Joe Walsh – Analog Man. Contemporary foray today was Grimes, Miss Anthropocene, I’d like it more if someone else was programming the drums, that’s the flaw for me. So where was I, “The clouds rolled across the sky in a stampede of fluff and wet wool…”.\n\nThe great thing about being in Penzance is that you can go down to the C. I suppose you can do that with any instrument. Today it was too dark to see the C, but at some point I’m sure I will be able to show you, especially the sessioneers. On that subject today Dare and I listened through the Space Summit demos. Jed is my longest sessioneer and we’ve travelled leaps and bounds to find ourselves co-writing songs for this project and with Dare involved we are slowly but surely producing an album. We have 12 tracks, 3 mixed and the rest works in progress. I always knew that somewhere out there, possibly near the C, there would be a talented and creative artist who with help could rise to a new level. I will be very excited to share this with you all as will Jed, probably next year, but we may release some digital singles in the coming months as a stopgap till the album is complete. It’s so nice to be near the C.\n\nOn the walk down to the front, we passed through Morrab Gardens (there will be more on that when we find the daylight). In the tree was the most beautiful singing blackbird. They chirp and twitter but they also sing the most beautiful clear and pure notes. Often you hear them communicating with each other across the gardens, but today this solitary beautiful bird was merrily singing to himself. Was he singing for his mate or because he was lonely? What was he communicating to his kind and I wonder what do other breeds think of each other’s song? Is a thrush call and a blackbird call like Portuguese and French? Some chirrups are the same?\n\nI went up to swim today but was late and had to hit the gym instead. I don’t mind because there I can listen to music. I have an iPod, in fact I have 4 iPods. I really hate having everything in one place (phone), it makes you think that an improved version of your music won’t be as easy as a better listening experience. The point is that the better listening experience should counteract the convenience of the music sounding like crap. Why do so many people not care about this? The whole experience of music in a quality system changes everything. Don’t be sucked in by Alexa, she hates you and wants your experience to be easy and low quality, how can you let her do that to you? My iPods have thousands of albums, the archive on a digital and convenient device that doesn’t sound anywhere near as good, I have to accept it. I have Bose noise cancellation headphones for the plane and I use Sennheiser headphones in the gym that Olivia’s Dad gave me. The bluetooth buds always fall out of my ears. When I’m out of the archive I have a sonic quality issue like everyone else. It makes returning here even more of a pleasure.\n\nToday I listened to Skin Alley but sometimes in a gym you are fighting with the terrible music they are playing over the speakers. I don’t want the music to be so loud in my ears, but I have to get it over the pain of what’s happening in the room. So I might listen to Metal, quietly. That’s the compromise. If I listen to something soft and beautiful it is shadowed by an angry noise in the background. Skin Alley as a seventies sound flit between soft and harder, more frustrating actually because just when you think you’re safe a mellow part comes up in the arrangement and is suddenly ruined by the encroaching banging repetitious nonsense. Skin Alley passed most people by and had little or no profile in the US, but once they were a cool contemporary Progressive band. Two of the members jammed with Hendrix and Stephen Stills and they made 4 albums between 1969 and 1973. Today I listened to their third album Two Quid Deal from 1972. Bass player and founder member Thomas Crimble was involved with Hawkwind, but was also a major part with THE Michael Eavis of growing and establishing the Glastonbury Music Festival. Crimble was replaced by Atomic Rooster founder member Nick Graham who famously (in my house) co-wrote the No 1 US single The Flame for Cheap Trick.\n\nI’m going to try and find my way through the labyrinthine aisles of the archive into the early hours of this morning and file away some of the records I bought on tour. The shelves are tight and I’m going to have to do some rearranging. I may have to move the US Folk into those old fashioned plastic carriers so there’s more room for the alphabet. I wonder what’s going to happen when I get to the C.\n\nThe steely green sea, angry, waves breaking impatiently before they reach the shore. Clouds of sand flare up just below the surface, the white froth is a seeping wound in the sea’s skin. The wind biting your face, a soft push in your back when you turn around. No boats on the horizon, no sea birds, all life has deserted this harsh twilight landscape. Back on land the same thing is happening, fewer people than before, a grey mood in the air. The seagulls and the crows aren’t gathering on the beach, the people can’t gather in the pubs or the restaurants. It’s unnatural. No birds in the sky, a prisoner in your own home, no revelry, no laughter and joy, just fear and anxiety. Nature conspiring, mad at us. We are just waiting without knowing what to expect, unable to imagine how the future will look in a week, a month, a year. It’s unprecedented, the authorities are making decisions for you. You’re not sure if you believe them, but then you look at Italy and the unease returns. But then you think of all those people losing their jobs, people who can’t survive, already struggling and now faced with the greatest struggle of their lives, fighting for survival and who is their guide? Should they just know how to react? What to do? The guidance comes in soundbites. Who has the manual with the instructions on how to be? Will nature forgive us, give us another chance?\n\nToday the pool closed. I swam my three miles and some this week but that’s the end till who knows when. As I’m swimming up and down, ticking off the laps, I’m thinking this is probably the best defense against a respiratory attacking virus, that is fitness, healthy lungs. There’s nothing disease likes more than inactive bodies, even inactive minds. This was my defense, taken away from me, leaving me to stimulate my body on the carpet in front of the computer – it’s not the same. Then it makes you think of all those people who were going through hell when we were all living it up in our cosy homes and secure jobs, a regular income, friends, aspirations, dreams to fulfill. Perhaps now we can get a very small sense of what it’s like to be a refugee, except they were fleeing from war and persecution, at least we still have our families sleeping safe upstairs and the flat screen TV. Perhaps now we’ll realize how lucky we have been. At least we are not being forced into uniform and sent to the front with a weapon, killing for survival, now it’s just a scrap over a toilet roll. Not a bad option considering how it could have been. Still, we don’t know how it will be, we can only hope.\n\nWe didn’t go to bed till 6AM yesterday but today I awoke to lots of responses to the Bandcamp mail and giving us the opportunity to make the most of our online catalogue of music and the occasional t-shirt, tote bag or vinyl record. So thank you so much to everybody who has taken the opportunity to purchase something. The rest of the day was already fading due to the extremely late night and by the time we had finished in the gym/pool, by the time Olivia had returned from the launderette, by the time I had got back from taking the recycling and getting the shopping it was already 8.30PM. Jonas dropped in to say goodbye (and pick up the MOAT record he kindly bought) as he makes the trek back to Germany, travelling through a deserted ghostly Europe. By the time we had eaten and watched the latest episode of Picard, washed up, put the clothes and the shopping away, by the time I sat down to listen to the sessioneers’ music that they have sent me, it was already 1AM. Here I am now in the studio putting records on while I write and before I turn my attention to Tony, Mark, Jed and their work. Lots of emails to answer, too, the whole idea of this being a time where one would be looking for something to do is certainly not true for me. In the studio tomorrow working on Jed’s Space Summit project. Sessions Sunday and Monday, I am extremely busy as things get cancelled around me. Nicklas not coming, Jerome not coming, Atlantaeum Flood not coming, Sessioneer Noel not coming, Canada almost definitely not happening, Swedish Anekdoten rehearsals not happening and then what about June and July and our trip to America in August, the new MOAT album, Record Store Day, Salim’s album, US dates, UK dates, Olivia’s hosting of Night Of The Prog, working with Arno in France, everything up in the air and yet busy as hell.\n\nIt’s been extremely broad on the record front and in three formats and not a lot of time to listen to much. I started off with Spotify as I was running around the studio and I listened to William DuVall from Alice In Chain’s acoustic solo album, just him and a guitar. Interesting hearing a powerful Rock singer accompany himself with a quieter instrument. I followed it up with what is a brand new artist to me, Margaret Glaspy. I am on a Rough Trade records mailing list and they wrote some nice stuff about here so I checked her out. She has a new album coming called Devotion, on Spotify there is only one track but there is another album called Emotion And Math which I really liked. A certain intensity, like her voice and songs, she plays the guitar and fiddle (although I didn’t hear fiddle). The new album is allegedly different but I’m really liking the one I heard. After that I went mellow with a Dionne Warwick Classic CD collection, those Bacharach/David songs, those classic arrangements and her voice.\n\nBefore I go to Sessioneers’ music I thought I’d write and listen to one album. I picked Group 1850 and their Psychedelic Dutch journey into that sixties wonderland that must have been an amazing transition from the world as it was to the Acid, Peace and Love generation of the era. Having just discovered their 2nd album Paradise Now on our recent trip to Concerto Records in Amsterdam I ordered a reissue of their first album online. The album originally came in a 3D sleeve with the glasses included I believe and is called Agemo’s Trip To Mother Earth (1968). Put it this way, whatever you imagine it might sound like, it does.\n\nOk now I’m autographing MOAT vinyl and Noctorum CDs before I get into Sessioneers land. I’ll be back before the night’s end.\n\nIt’s now three hours later and I’ve been listening to Mark, Tony and Jed’s music. The ongoing process of creation, production, arrangement, exchanging ideas, personal taste and direction. There’s a lot of ways to hear the same thing, hopefully we are on the same page. Ok one more album before sleep. I’m in the studio tomorrow and it’s already 4AM. So the pic is of me working with the bass on the Space Summit track that we will continue with tomorrow. The album is the second Group 1850 album Paradise Now (1969). One of the great album finds in recent times, especially an original version.\n\nGet into your books, get into your music, don’t just watch the screen in this difficult time, stimulate your brain in different ways. Don’t sit on the couch eating and watching Netflix (only part of the time). Read, think, exercise, stay alive. This is your chance to break into another world of creativity and inspiration. See you out there.\n\nYay, 7 hours sleep. Dare and I got together for a Noctorum writing session today. We have to take every opportunity we can to work together, because I’ll be travelling a lot with various different projects from May and the days whoosh by like runaway trains. I was talking to Sessioneer Kevin in Atlanta on Sunday about how playing percussion along to songs with an easy beat can give you a better understanding of the rhythmic flow in your guitar playing. I mentioned Soul Asylum’s Runaway Train as an example of a song that you could easily swing a tambourine to. By chance he’d seen them the week before, just Dave Pirner left. Another song to try this would be REM’s Losing My Religion. Whatever happened to Michael Stipe? Just guest appearances, but no solo record yet. I suppose there’s a massive pressure on him to do something successful. As if it matters, as if sales or critics should have any bearing on your work. Too much success or outside opinion badly interrupts some people’s creativity. Leave them alone, let them breathe, encourage them always.\n\nToday I was a bass player. It’s so interesting the turns writing sessions take. Dare’s idea today was to make a rhythm track, then have me come up with a bass line and then the two of us play guitar to get some nice weaving (as Keith Richards calls it). So Dare found some drum sounds and found a pattern which we tweaked together. But when I picked up the bass, the first thing I did was play a random bass line, nothing to do with the rhythm track. There was something about it that we liked and thought we’d better record it separately to the track we were supposed to be working on before we went back to the original idea. By the end of the day we had two tracks, one with drums, adding bass, the other with bass, adding drums. We never got to the guitars. You never know where things will lead.\n\nWe went up to Dare’s house for dinner and football, Liverpool lost 2-0 to Chelsea in the FA cup but the baked potato with baked beans was perfect. Dare cooked, I washed up. In the front room there was a glowing fire, a real fire, where we watched the game with room mate Martin. Olivia brought her computer and while we watched she organized another gig for us in Canada, she never stops. At one point in the evening I asked where was the cat? A short silence ensued, the cat was dead! When we left we met three cats on the way home, one extremely friendly, one weird and uncertain, the other scared, cats are so unpredictable.\n\nI listened to some interesting records today, Chris Spedding’s album Joyland from 2015. Unsurprisingly great guitar throughout and guest appearances by actor Ian McShane, Arthur Brown, Glen Matlock, Robert Gordon, Bryan Ferry, Snips, Andy Mackay, Johnny Marr, Lane, and what must have been the last or one of the last appearances by ex Free bassist and songwriter Andy Fraser as he died the year the album was released. I also listened to Acid Folk band Forest’s second album Full Circle from 1970 (£600 for the original), German/English band Message from 1976 and one of the seventies Tremeloes albums, Shiner, that nobody bought, from 1974. German sixties band The Lords found its way onto the turntable, but left quite soon, a mixture of Beat group, novelty and oompah, they sold 7 million albums in Germany…to somebody. As we speak Olivia has found the fuzzy psych record collector’s dream album, Dark Round The Edges by Dark. Released in 1972, there were only 64 copies made. Apparently it’s the 17th most valuable record ever made (who decides these things?) and has sold for between £6,000 and £25,000. I bought my vinyl reissue with booklet for 25 euros at Concerto in Amsterdam…score.\n\nI could of course just spend the rest of my life sitting in the archive with my nice stereo system, listening to odd records or even not so odd records, any records really, but I have to eat…and buy more records. There is one problem with music though, I can’t have music on and read at the same time. I love to read but can’t concentrate if there’s any music floating through the air towards me. I need to assign more time to reading, try and turn the music off. Good luck with that. I have a new Ian McEwan book to start (Machines Like Me) and the Tony Visconti book and the Patti Smith book and oh yeah the works of Shakespeare. But I suppose that archive/studio land is for music immersion. Oh damn, I have to sleep, what a waste, I could have listened to…."
