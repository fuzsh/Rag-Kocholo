        "text": "American actor (born 1982)\n\nThomas J. Pelphrey[1] (born July 28, 1982)[2] is an American actor. He is known for playing the roles of Jonathan Randall on the CBS television series Guiding Light (for which he won two Daytime Emmy Awards), Mick Dante on the CBS television series As the World Turns, Kurt Bunker on the Cinemax television series Banshee, Ward Meachum on the Netflix series Iron Fist, Ben Davis on the Netflix series Ozark, Perry Abbott on the Prime Video series Outer Range, Don Crowder on the Max limited series Love & Death, Joe Mankiewicz in David Fincher's film Mank, and Jason Derek Brown in the true crime film American Murderer. For his performance on Ozark, Pelphrey received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nPelphrey was born in Howell, New Jersey to Jewish parents.[1] He graduated from Howell High School in 2000, and from Rutgers University (Mason Gross School of the Arts) in 2004 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGuiding Light\n\n[edit]\n\nPelphrey's first notable role was Jonathan Randall, the son of Reva Shayne and her late former husband, Richard Winslow, on the CBS soap opera Guiding Light. He joined the cast in September 2004 and received critical acclaim for his portrayal of anti-hero Jonathan.\n\nHe was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Younger Actor\" in 2005 and won the award the following year in April 2006. He received a third consecutive nomination in the same category in 2007 but lost to Bryton McClure. Pelphrey won his second Daytime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Younger Actor\" in 2008.\n\nAs the World Turns\n\n[edit]\n\nPelphrey signed a contract to play \"Mick\" on As the World Turns beginning in October 2009.[4] His run ended in February 2010 when his character was sent to prison for his misdeeds. Pelphrey earned an Emmy pre-nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Mick Dante.\n\nOther television roles\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 30, 2007, he appeared in an episode of Numb3rs, \"Pandora's Box\".[5] On October 17, 2008, he appeared in an episode of \"Ghost Whisperer\", and the following season in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. In 2015 Pelphrey landed the recurring role of Kurt Bunker, a former neo-nazi trying to reintegrate into society, on Cinemax's action drama Banshee. To prepare for this role he started lifting weights and did research by reading books on the neo-Nazi movement in America.[6] In 2017, he appeared in Iron Fist as Ward Meachum and portrayed Ben Davis on the third season of the Netflix crime drama Ozark which was released on March 27, 2020.[7] His portrayal in the latter received critical acclaim and the lack of an Emmy nomination was perceived as a snub by fans and critics.[8] Nonetheless, Pelphrey received nominations for Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series (shared with the cast). In the final season of Ozark (2022), Pelphrey reprised the role of Ben Davis as a guest appearance, for which he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.[9]\n\nIn 2022, he starred on the Amazon Prime Video series Outer Range as Perry Abbott.\n\nIn 2023, he starred on the HBO miniseries Love & Death as Don Crowder.\n\nTheater\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom September 6, 2007, to September 30, 2007, Pelphrey performed in Kevin Mandel's A New Television Arrives Finally as the title character, at Theatre 54, in New York.[10] Pelphrey starred in In God's Hat at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater, in New York City, through August 7, 2010.[11] In 2012, he appeared in the Broadway cast of the musical drama End of the Rainbow as Mickey Deans; in 2015, he returned to Broadway in a revival of Fool for Love, playing Martin.[12]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2022, Tommy Pelphrey began dating actress Kaley Cuoco. The two made their first public appearance as a couple at a Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony in May 2022.[13] Pelphrey and Cuoco announced on Instagram in October 2022 that they were expecting their first child together.[14] Cuoco gave birth to their daughter on March 30, 2023.[15]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 Birds of America Hitchhiker 2010 The Elastic Marty Short film 2012 Junction David ReelHeart International Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast Excuse Me for Living Dan 2013 Turtle Island Tim Tiger Lily Road Ricky Harden 2014 A Cry from Within Carl 2015 Anchors Denny The Girl Is in Trouble Eric Sam Stephen #Lucky Number Bret Reynolds Blink Actor 2019 Crazy Alien Captain Zach Andrews 2020 Mank Joseph L.
