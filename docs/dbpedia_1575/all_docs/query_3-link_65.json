        "text": "Soliloquy from Macbeth\n\n\"Sound and fury\" redirects here. For other uses, see Sound and Fury (disambiguation) and Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow (disambiguation).\n\n\"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\" is the beginning of the second sentence of one of the most famous soliloquies in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth. It takes place in the beginning of the fifth scene of Act 5, during the time when the Scottish troops, led by Malcolm and Macduff, are approaching Macbeth's castle to besiege it. Macbeth, the play's protagonist, is confident that he can withstand any siege from Malcolm's forces. He hears the cry of a woman and reflects that there was a time when his hair would have stood on end if he had heard such a cry, but he is now so full of horrors and slaughterous thoughts that it can no longer startle him.\n\nSeyton then tells Macbeth of Lady Macbeth's death, and Macbeth delivers this soliloquy as his response to the news.[1] Shortly afterwards, he is told of the apparent movement of Birnam Wood towards Dunsinane Castle (as the witches had prophesied to him), which is actually Malcolm's forces having disguised themselves with tree branches so as to hide their numbers as they approach the castle. This sets the scene for the final events of the play and Macbeth's death at the hands of Macduff.\n\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow...\n\n\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and so Forth\" is a 1955 short story by John Updike.\n\n\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\" is a 1953 short story by Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n\"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\" is the title of an episode (S02 E13, 2019-04-18) of season two of The Orville.\n\n\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\" is the title of an episode (S02 E03, 2023-06-29) of season two of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nTomorrow and Tomorrow by Charles Sheffield is a 1997 science fiction novel, where a man searches endlessly to reverse the fate \"She should have died hereafter...\"\n\nOne of the main musical themes of Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers is titled \"Tomorrow and Tomorrow\".\n\n\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\" is a 1956 essay and book title by Aldous Huxley.\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a 2022 novel by Gabrielle Zevin.\n\n... and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death\n\nAll Our Yesterdays is used as the title of several works, encompassing literature, music and television, including a 1969 history of 1940s science fiction fandom by Harry Warner, Jr,[2] an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series (Season 3, Episode 24, 1969); and a 1994 novel by Robert B.
