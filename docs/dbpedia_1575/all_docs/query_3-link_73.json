        "text": "American weather technology company\n\nTomorrow.io (formerly ClimaCell; legally known as The Tomorrow Companies Inc.[2]) is an American weather technology company. It provides real-time weather forecasting services and APIs.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was founded in 2016 as ClimaCell to develop a real-time weather forecasting service based on cellular and IoT monitoring systems.[3]\n\nIn February 2021, Tomorrow.io announced Operation Tomorrow Space.[4] The company hoped to broaden its business model by launching proprietary radar satellites to improve its forecasting abilities.[5] In March of that year, it announced that it had raised $77 million in a series D round of funding.[6]\n\nTechnology\n\n[edit]\n\nTomorrow.io's primary goal was to use wireless communication infrastructure and IoT devices to collect real-time weather data. The company aimed to report conditions closer to the ground than satellite and higher resolution than Doppler weather radar techniques.[2][7]\n\nThe information includes measurements on temperature, wind and precipitation data. After two years of development, Tomorrow.io's Weather Intelligence Platform (formerly Hypercast) was publicly launched in April 2017.[citation needed]\n\nThe company's Operation Tomorrow Space is launching weather radar satellites to improve forecasting accuracy and coverage.[2][8] The first satellite of the constellation, Tomorrow-R1, launched on 15 April 2023 on a SpaceX's Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket as part of the Transporter-7 rideshare mission.[9] The system operates in the Ka band to detect precipitation and ocean surface characteristics.[10] The company plans to launch 20 satellites with a combination of active radar and passive microwave sensors.[11]\n\nBusiness model\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company's software is designed to provide information to aviation, construction, insurance, sports, and utility services.[citation needed] Clients include JetBlue Airways, Delta, and the New England Patriots.[12][13]\n\nTomorrow.io launched a mobile weather app, ClimaCell Weather, in 2019.[14] The app was later[when?] renamed to Weather by Tomorrow."
