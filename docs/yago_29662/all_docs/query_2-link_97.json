        "text": "Born a Prussian princess, Marie Alexandrine Elisabeth Eleonore of Mecklenburg-Schwerin married into the Russian Imperial Family in 1874. She was called Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna “the Elder” in the family. A prominent hostess in Saint Petersburg, she was known as the grandest of the grand duchesses.\n\nShe was eight years old when her mother died in 1862. Her father married twice more. She married the third son of Alexander II of Russia, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, being one of the very few princesses with Slavic patriline to ever marry a male dynast of the Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov. She had been engaged to someone else, but broke it off as soon as she met Vladimir. It took three more years before they were permitted to marry as she had been raised a Lutheran and refused to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nMaria remained Lutheran throughout most of her marriage, but converted to Orthodoxy later in her marriage, some said to give her son Kirill a better chance at the throne. As a result of marrying a son of an Emperor of Russia, she took on a new style; Her Imperial Highness as her husband did; the couple had four sons and one daughter. All of Maria’s children were born at the Catherine Palace, Tsarskoye Selo.\n\nShe was considered the grandest of the Grand Duchesses, and formed an alternate court in the later years of the reign of her nephew Nicholas II. The Grand Duchess hated the Tsar and Tsarina towards the end of the dynasty (especially the Tsarina). Along with her sons, she contemplated a coup against the Tsar in the winter of 1916–17, that would force the Tsar’s abdication and replacement by her son, Grand Duke Kirill, as regent. In seeking support for the coup, she famously told Duma president Mikhail Rodzianko that the Empress must be “annihilated”."
