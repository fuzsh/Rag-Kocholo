        "text": "When Queen Margrethe II abdicated the throne this month, her son, Frederik X, and his wife, Mary, became Denmark’s new monarchs. Such a move hasn’t been made in centuries: After 10 years on the Danish throne, Christian II abdicated in 1523, but since then, all Danish monarchs have reigned until they died.\n\nAs Denmark’s queen since 1972, Margrethe (who retains the royal honorific “Your Majesty”) built a reputation for fulfilling her role while enjoying the pleasures of regular life. (Infamously, she was still smoking the occasional cigarette up until six months ago.) Together with her husband, the French diplomat Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, she translated works by the feminist writer Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nIn addition to her duties as queen, Margrethe worked as a painter and graphic artist; designed several stamps for the Danish postal service; provided illustrations in 1977 for J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings under the pseudonym Ingahild Grathmer; and designed costumes for the film The Wild Swans based on a fairy tale by the celebrated Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. The ex-monarch’s legacy is undeniably an illustrious one, and while only time will tell what her son’s reign will bring, the new king will enjoy access to the same hallowed halls as his predecessors. Read on for a roundup of some of the Danish royal family’s most lavish castles.\n\nAmalienborg Palace: the capital residence\n\nThe planning for Amalienborg Palace began in 1749 with four medium-sized palaces facing each other, all of them were built according to a general plan by the court architect Nicolai Eigtved. Danish King Frederik V wanted to turn medieval Copenhagen into a Baroque showpiece based on French models. Initially, members of the nobility were given a 40-year tax break to finance the palaces. Gradually, the buildings became the property of the Danish royal family.\n\nMargrethe’s residence is known as Schack’s Palace, named after the first owner, Countess Schack, an ancestor of the Orientalist and founder of the Schack Museum in Munich, Count Adolf Friedrich von Schack.\n\nLevetzau Palace houses a museum dedicated to the royal family. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary lived in the apartment above it for a long time, but it has since passed to his brother, Joachim, and his wife, Marie of Denmark. Moltke’s Palace is open to the public via guided tours. The new King Frederik X lives with his family in Brockdorff’s Palace, in the east wing of the complex.\n\nFredensborg Palace: the Danish Versailles\n\nOriginally a small hunting lodge inspired by French design, Fredensborg Palace was considerably built up over the course of the 18th century. Today, the palace in the north of the island of Zealand is considered “the Danish Versailles,” with the emphasis on “Danish”: It’s a prime example of Scandinavian Baroque style, with features that Danish design also later adopted.\n\nA riding arena and stables for the royal family’s horses are also part of Fredensborg Palace. The grounds were restored in 2018 to mark Crown Prince Frederik’s 50th birthday and reopened in 2020.\n\nThe family prefers to spend time at Fredensborg in the spring and fall. On February 13, 2018, Margrethe’s husband, Henri (or Prince Henrik, as he was known in Denmark) passed away there.\n\nGråsten Palace: a southern summer retreat\n\nThe Danish royal family often spends the summer in the south at Gråsten Palace near the German border. It features a vegetable and herb garden (gifted to the Queen by the community in honor of her 80th birthday) as well as a tennis court and a pool. As in every royal palace when the family is home, the special ritual of the changing of the guard takes place at Gråsten at noon. The guards wear the same tall black bearskin hats as the Grenadier Guards at Buckingham Palace.\n\nMarselisborg Palace\n\nMarselisborg is the Danish royal family’s newest palace. Built by architect Hack Kampmann between 1899 and 1902 south of the city of Aarhus, it was given to the newlyweds Prince Christian X and Princess Alexandrine as a wedding present. This second summer residence gets its name from the Dutch merchant Gabriel Marselis, to whom Frederik III gave the previous buildings located here in 1661. The whole chapter was hardly voluntary: Frederik III was so heavily indebted to Marselis (one of the richest Dutchmen of the 17th century) that he had no choice. But 40 years later, things were back on track as the estate reverted to the Crown when Marselis’s son, Constantin, died childless. The two bronze sculptures in the park, Open Heart and Lovers, were created by Prince Henrik.\n\nChâteau de Cayx: the royal wine estate\n\nAt times, the Danish royal family is drawn quite far south—specifically, to France, and their Château de Cayx near the Occitanian town of Cahors. Grapevines grow on the hills between the narrow bends cut into the landscape by the Lot river, and some of the wine gets stored in the ample cellars beneath the Château.\n\nKing Frederik X, who is also a vintner, inherited the property from his father. The Château de Cayx had long been owned by the de Laborde de Monpezat family. Margrethe II and her husband acquired it in 1974. The building’s roots run back to the 14th century, though it has been rebuilt several times since.\n\nRosenborg Castle\n\nQueen Margrethe II and her son King Frederik X don’t live here, but they do stop by from time to time. Originally located outside the city wall, the building was initially a retreat. It later became a residence—until 1710, when Frederick IV, who was officially king of Denmark and Norway as well as Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, put an end to that. Another century later, his namesake, Frederick VI, decided to convert the Dutch Renaissance brick building into the Chronological Collection of Danish Kings. Today, the museum houses the Danish crown jewels, among other items. The surrounding park is a popular place for a stroll."
