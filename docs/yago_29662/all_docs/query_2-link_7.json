        "text": "(1803 – 1892) was Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nAlexandrine was the seventh child and fourth daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and his wife Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was a younger sister of Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, Wilhelm I of Prussia, and Charlotte, Empress of Russia.\n\nOn 25 May 1822, she married Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He succeeded his grandfather as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1837.\n\nHer marriage was generally considered unhappy; Paul Frederick was a military man who had little time for or interest in his wife and family. Alexandrine, by contrast, was a devoted mother who tenderly raised her children and actively cultivated their cultural pursuits. Alexandrine herself was very cultured but was also described as a stereotypically-remote German princess. She was not considered an intellectual but attended scholarly lectures and read many books.\n\nAlexandrine is the great great great grandmother of the Dutch King Willem-Alexander"
