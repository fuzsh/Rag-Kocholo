        "text": "Christian X, King of Denmark is the King of the Kingdom of Denmark since May 14 1912. He is the King of Denmark that became the first King of Denmark who lost the Danish territories which gave him the name Christian X the Unfortunate or the Poor King who got shitted on by Germany and the Soviets.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nChristian was born on 26 September 1870 at his parents' country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. He was the first child of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands. He was baptised with the names Christian Carl Frederik Albert Alexander Vilhelm in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace on 31 October 1870 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen.\n\nPrince Christian was raised with his siblings in the royal household in Copenhagen, and grew up between his parents' residence in Copenhagen, the Frederick VIII's Palace, an 18th-century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen, and their country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located by the coastline of the Ã˜resund strait north of the city. As a grandchild of the reigning Danish monarch in the male line and the eldest son of the Crown Prince, he was second in line to the throne, after his father. Christian was less than two years older than his brother Prince Carl, and the two princes had a joint confirmation at the chapel og Christiansborg Palace in 1887. After passing the studenter-eksamen (the university entrance examination in Denmark) in 1889 as the first Danish monarch, he started a military education as was customary for princes at that time, and subsequently served with the 5th Dragoon Regiment and later studied at the Officers Academy in Randers from 1891 to 1892.\n\nCrown Prince[]\n\nOn 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died, and Christian's father ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII. Christian himself became crown prince.\n\nKing of Denmark[]\n\nOn 14 May 1912, King Frederick VIII died after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking a walk in a park in Hamburg, Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in Nice, France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to Copenhagen. Christian was in Copenhagen when he heard about his father's demise and acceded to the throne as Christian X.\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nDuring World War I, the country remained neutral and continued the democratization process, introducing a fairly democratic constitution in 1915. However, Denmark's neutrality was encroached on by Germany, who forced it to mine the Skagerrak and other territorial waters against the British. The Germans later on invaded them to invade Norway and Sweden to invade Britain from Norway, Denmark and Belgium.\n\nDuring that time Iceland and Greenland were snagged by Soviet Rus to extend it's communist influence and create territories for European Communists as a refuge so they plot revolutions against their governments without interference from the Secret Polices of Europe's Nationalist Governments. Because of this Christian X became the King of Denmark who lost the Danish territories which gave him the name Christian X the Unfortunate or the Poor King who got shitted on by Germany and the Soviets.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nChristian married Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Cannes on 26 April 1898; she was a daughter of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. She eventually became his queen consort. They had two sons:\n\nCrown Prince Frederick (b. 1899), married Ingrid of Sweden (b. 1910)\n\nPrince Knud (b. 1900), married Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark (b. 1912)"
