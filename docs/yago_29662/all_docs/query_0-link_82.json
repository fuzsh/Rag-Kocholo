[3] He was confirmed on 17 April 1887 in Copenhagen.[4]\n\nHe was married to Alexandrine Augusta von Mecklenburg-Schwerin-Oldenburg 26 April 1898 in Cannes, France. They were the parents of two children, Princes Frederik and Knud.[5]\n\nHe died 20 April 1947 at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen at the age of 76. His remains were buried at Roskilde, Roskilde Municipality, Zealand, Denmark.[6][7]\n\nObituary:[8]\n\nDeath Calls Heroic King of Denmark\n\nWeight of Years and Weak Heart Fatal to Christian\n\nCopenhagen, April 21, (AP)--King Christian X, who ruled his Danish subjects for 35 years and was acclaimed a hero for remaining with the during five bitter wartime years of German occupation, died Sunday of a heart ailment after a 15-day illness. He was 76 years old.\n\nChristian automatically was succeeded on the throne by his 48-year-old son, Crown Prince Frederik, who became King Frederik IX. Under the Danish constitution, Frederik did not have to await a monarchial oath or a formal coronation ceremony before beginning his reign.\n\nChristian died at 11: 04 p.m., eight hours after he lapsed into a coma and his strength began ebbing away. Before he became unconscious, Christian whispered a last farewell to Queen Alexandrine, the crown prince, and his other son, the 47-year-old Prince Knud. [...]\n\nThe towering six-foot seven-inch Christian was born at Charlottenborg, September 26, 1870, and succeeded his father, King Frederick VIII, on the throne May 12, 1912.\n\nAfter the Germans invaded Denmark April 9, 1940, they interfered little with Christian's acvitities at first, apparently seeking to win his cooperation. The always silent often scornful treatment accorded them by the Danes apparently wore on the Nazis' nerves, however, and Christian was interned in Sorgeneri castle in 1943.\n\nHe declared then he was a \"happy man now,\" not only because eh was a German prisoner, but also because \"I am the chief of a large underground army.\"\n\nLoved and respected by his subjects almost from the first days of his reign he became adored by them for refusing to flee to a safer country in the face of German occupation threats.\n\nSource\n\n↑ https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_10.\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Christian_X_of_Denmark\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Christian_X_of_Denmark\n\n↑ \"Danmark Kirkebøger, 1484-1941,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QG8N-VV9Q : 10 March 2021), Christian Carl Frederik Albert Alexander Vilhelm, 17 Apr 1887; Confirmation, Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, , Rigsarkivet, København (The Danish National Archives), Copenhagen.\n\n↑ Wikipedia:Christian_X_of_Denmark\n\n↑ \"BillionGraves Index,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QRBP-T5N2 : 29 January 2019), Christian Carl Frederick Albert Alexander Vilhelm Glücksburg, died 20 Apr 1947; citing BillionGraves (http://www.billiongraves.com : 2012), Burial at Roskilde Domkirke, Roskilde, Roskilde Municipality, Region Zealand, Denmark.\n\n↑ Christian X on Find A Grave: Memorial #8509536 retrieved 20 sep 2016\n\n↑ Obituary from the Oregonian, Monday, Apr 21, 1947 , Portland, OR Page: 1."
