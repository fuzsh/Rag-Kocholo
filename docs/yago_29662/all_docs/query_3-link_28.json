This isn't everyday run-of-the-mill espionage we're talking here. This was genocide plain and simple. If you didn't agree with Hitler and his regime then you had better put on a brave front a try to \"fit in\" with your fellow Aryan brothers or be labeled an enemy of the state to face the same fate as the Jews. Nothing was just, nothing.\n\nWhen Hitler ordered Danish Jews to wear the yellow star, the Danish Royal family wore it too and asked their people to do so too, so the Nazi (not German) troops could not tell who was who. Tha Danish Royal family was brave enough to defy Hitler. Why couldn't other royal houses do the same?

'Predicting' about a book is not always good. Let sleeping dogs lie ...\n\nCheers!\n\nMartin\n\nalejandro_sk said:\n\nYes, that's true. I have not read that book but I know that King Leopold III of Belgium almost lost his throne during that time. What I said about the Royal Danish house is also from another book. There was a bit of everything during that time and I'm afraid we'll never get to know the whole truth.\n\nAlejandro\n\nThe Danish Jews were never ordered to wear the Star of David, thus the legend that King Christian wore it on his daily rides in Copenhagen, is just a myth.\n\nHe did irritate Hitler, though, when he sent a thank you note back in response to birthday greetings, and the note was short and concise \"My thanks, Christian R.\" (Paraphrased.) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_X\n\nBut generally the royal and WWII is an exciting topic, and this book should be a fascinating read.\n\nWe also have a topic in the Royal Chit Chat part of the forum What did Monarchs do during WWII for those of you interested.\n\nnorwegianne said:\n\nThe Danish Jews were never ordered to wear the Star of David, thus the legend that King Christian wore it on his daily rides in Copenhagen, is just a myth.\n\nHello!\n\nI have never been to Denmark and I was born ages after the war, but if the legend you mention is a myth, then it is a very popular one! I have one book that mentions that, here with me (for school):\n\nThomson, David; Europe since Napoleon; Penguin Books Ltd. pp 768-769.\n\nIt doesn't say that the King wore the yellow star on his daily rides but that the whole Royal family stood on the palace balcony (?) wearing the stars and telling the people to do the same.\n\nThank you for the links, the one to Wikipedia too!\n\nAlejandro\n\nnorwegianne said:\n\nThe Danish Jews were never ordered to wear the Star of David, thus the legend that King Christian wore it on his daily rides in Copenhagen, is just a myth.\n\nHi norwegianne!\n\nNow that you mention it, I think there is/was a photo (not picture or painting) showing King Christian wearing the Star of David! I'll see if I can find it. Any idea who took it, where or when? And above all, why?\n\nCheers!\n\nMartin\n\nKing Kong said:\n\nHi norwegianne!\n\nNow that you mention it, I think there is/was a photo (not picture or painting) showing King Christian wearing the Star of David!

Everywhere I've seen, it's proclaimed to be a myth, and I think I remember reading in the latest biography about Queen Margrethe that she also said that it was a myth. But if you have proof - I'd be more than willing to see it. EDIT: As I'm getting anxious to find out what is real, I've ordered a book on \"Christian X and the occupation\" from the library... Maybe the picture could be there?\n\nIt's important to remember, as well, that out of Denmark's 7,500 Jews, only 51 perished in the German camps, due to the Danish population's immensely large rescue operation before the Jews were to be transported to Germany.\n\nFor those interested: There is also a children's book written about this legend: The Yellow Star: The Legend of King Christian X of Denmark, and Number the Stars by Lois Lowry also bears mention of it.\n\nMy father was Jewish and escaped the holocaust by being evacuated to England by the Red Cross; apparently shortly before he died a couple of years ago, when he was reminiscing about things to my mother's Danish sister-in-law, he told her how much the European Jews living in exile in England (and maybe elsewhere) had appreciated the support shown by the Danish king and people. The particular story of the King wearing the yellow star in support of the Jewish community may be apocryphal, but it sounds as though he was lending support somehow.\n\nnorwegianne said:\n\nI'd be interested in seeing it.

All the same, I'll keep on Googling for it. Besides, whatever you may find about King Christian X in the books you ordered, please, let me know. I'm interested, star or no star.\n\nI think that on the whole, the moral behind the legend is that Danish people really helped Jews and the Royal family must have been quite against Hitler if we are to judge by their popularity after the war. Good for them!\n\nCheers!\n\nMartin\n\nChristian X 1912 - 1947\n\nBorn on the 26 of September 1870. Parents: King Frederik VIII and Queen Lovisa (née Princess of Sweden). King on the 14 of May 1912 upon the death of his father.\n\nMarried on the 26 of April 1998 to Alexandrine, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Sons: Frederik IX, Knud.\n\nWhen Iceland became an independant Kingdom in 1918, Christian became King of Iceland. As such he was deposed in 1944.\n\nHe was politically very active, until he lost his functions during the German occupation 1940-1945.\n\nHe died on the 20 of April 1947 and was succeeded by his son, Frederik IX.\n\nMotto: My God, My Country, My Honour​\n\nPhotos of Christian X and family on Brigitte Gastel Lloyd site http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/christian10denmark1870.htm​\n\nGenealogy and not only of Christian X http://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=en&m=NG&n=christian+X&t=PN\n\nalejandro_sk said:\n\nWhen Hitler ordered Danish Jews to wear the yellow star, the Danish Royal family wore it too and asked their people to do so too, so the Nazi (not German) troops could not tell who was who.

I mean, it was possible!\n\nAlex\n\nOkay guys, lets not get carried away, I have a Danish Jewish friend, who's mother was in Denmark at the time of the holocaust, and he told me that the King of Denmark threatened that he and all his fellow Danishmen would wear a yellow star, so the Nazi's wouldn't differentiate between on Danishman and another, in his eyes, all his subjects are the same. The Nazi's then realized that they would have no cooperation from the Danish nation, (like the countries of Hungary, Poland, the Ukraine, Lithuania- the latter 2 being part of Poland and Russia during WWII) and the Jewish people of Denmark were not put through any torment or discrimination, untill they were meant to be deported, and the rest is well known, how they were smuggled to Sweden. I would like to mention another last point, to the credit of the Danish nation, that when the Danish Jewish people went back home after WWII, none of their houses were ransacked, everything was,a s they had left it! It sends shivers down my spine, May the King's memory be blessed, together with the rest of the Danish nation!\n\nflctylu said:\n\nI just saw one of the \"A Royal Family: The Father In Law of Europe\" episodes. I recall it said that she was extremely hard to get along with - one incident, something about saving electricity [Chris X] [?] Marie did the opposite and turned all the lights on in a palace [?]\n\nIt is one episode of their relationship, that is often brought into the light.\n\nMarie/Dagmar was most likely used to the wealth/power she'd had in Russia. Denmark at the time, however, was not a wealthy country, and I've read, in the biography about Frederik IX, that the King even chose to get less money from the state than he'd done before - possibly as to not incite the people's ire."
