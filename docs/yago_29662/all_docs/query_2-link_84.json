        "text": "Engagements\n\nAround her 18th birthday Marianne started to think of marriage. As daughter of the rich King Willem I she was an attractive party for many European princes. Some even say that the widowed Emperor Pedro I of Brazil was interested in her hand. But Marianne wanted to do things her own way and fell in love with Prince Gustav Wasa, 'Prince of Sweden' (son of the deposed Swedish king Gustaf IV Adolf).\n\nThe engagement caused many eyebrows to rise in royal Europe. Not only was Gustav penniless* and without a throne, the Swedish king from the new Bernadotte dynasty had problems with this to advantageous engagement of the rival claimant. Some sources even claim that Karl XIV-Johan threatened with war if the engagement would not be broken of (not very likely, but still). Add to that that there were some doubts about the prince's character, as he seemed to be a mallionet of Prince Metternich, and there were doubts about his mother who lived ith her lover for some years. The general consensus was that Marianne could do a whole lot better, as her sister-in-law, the Princess of Orange explained in a letter to her brother Grand Duke Constantine of Russia:\n\n'To my mind it would be a sad position to have my sister-in-law married in that way; she would have had an establishment in this country and in Vienna, without having a settled position anywhere. And what a source of discord, worry and apprehention in European politics. It is deplorable! '.\n\nIn the end King Willem I relented and broke of the engagement. Queen Wilhelmina quickly started looking for other suitable candidates, and where else would her eyes go first then to her native Prussia, where Marianne had been born to? The most suitable candidate there was Marianne's cousin, Prince Albrecht, fourth son of King Friedrich-Willem III, a general and field-marshal in the Prussian army and an attractive & amiable young man. The couple soon got engaged.\n\n-\n\n* others however claim that Prince Gustav owned around 10 million florins, which was a huge capital at the time.\n\n-\n\nMarianne around 1828:\n\nMarianne and her mother, Queen Wilhelmina, around 1830\n\n'She is a strange being'\n\nIt was no surprise that the spoiled and independant Marianne soon became regarded as an eccentricity by the stiff and dutifull Hohenzollerns. Rigid courtlife didn't make her adapt her opinions (or at least to be silent about them) and the in-laws soon regarded her as everything a Prussian royal should not be. The Princess could afford to do things her own way as she was a financially independant woman with a fortune of her own (with which she bought Schloss Kamenz). Dispite her 'non-confirmist way and showy character' Marianne was a very religious woman who went to church three times a day.\n\nAn example of this eccentric behavior was recorded by the Duchess of Dino. During a dinner given in the honour of the new French King Louis-Felipe I, from the house of Orleans. Marianne appeared with a garland of lilies in her hair, to show her -not to subtle- support to the disposed house of Bourbon. Her in-laws and the french visitors were of course shocked and appaled by this blunt gesture. Apart from recording this episode the Duchess wrote this discription of Marianne: ' I think that of all the persons I have seen here Princess Albrecht has filled me with the greatest curiosity and interest. At first I thought her face was long and narrow, her mouth large, and the lower part of her face very ugly when she laughs, while the want of eyebrows was remarkable. But by degrees I have grown used to her, and find her actually pleasant. Her teeth are white and she is tall, but it is to obvious that she laces very tightly, which is the more noticable as she never rests; she wrigles, gesticulates, laughs, fidgets, and talks somewhat at random. She never crosses a room except at a run or a skip, and does not shine in point of dignity of bearing. But on the whole I think by no means she is unpleasant, and I think that men may find her somewhat attractive. She was very kind to me, with a frankness and good-nature in putting her questions as if she had always known me and poking fun ledft and right at her family to begin with; she astonished me greatly. The fact is that she is a spoilt child, accustomed to do and say anything she likes, and is regarded here as quite beyond restraint. She goes away to The Hague when her family would like her to stay in Berlin and she comes back when they think she intends to make a long stay in Holland. In short, she is a strange being.'\n\nHer position among the Dutch royals became weaker to. Her father abdicated and settled in Berlin and her brother Willem II and his stern Queen Anna Pavlovna reigned. Anna had never much sympathy for people who did not live up to their duties and disapproved of her behavior. The new Princess of Orange, Sophie of Wurttemberg, for once agreed with her mother-in-law and called Marianne 'a morally inferior creature'.\n\nThis picture comes from wikipedia:\n\nSchloss Kamenz:\n\nOn the move:\n\nIn 1849 Marianne started her travels. he first one took her to Sicily and later to lake Como, where she stayed for several years with her son Johannes Willem and her lover Johannes van Rossum. It was around this time that Marianne married Johannes van Rossum, though sources are not clear on the exact year (1852, 1853, 1854 and others claim they were married quickly after the divorce). Marianne always kept a keen interest in her homeland and after her nephew King Willem III became king in 1849 she was alowed back into the country & bought a house in Voorburg, near The Hague.\n\nAs Marianne was Willem III's favourite aunt, it is no surprise that his wife, Queen Sophie, would be one of her severest critics (Willem III and Sophie weren't the most harmonious couple). Sophie stated in a letter to Lady Malet that she thought the Princess was leading an adominable pedestrial life and Í had no choise indeed but to refuse her entry to my house'. According to Sohpie she refused Marianne because she was a gossiped and lied. Maybe Sophie was jealous that Marianne got the divorce that she herself was to afraid to ask for? Sophie must have felt more then disapproval of her aunt-in-law anyway, as she owned a miniature of the Princess.\n\nQueen Sophie's miniature of Marianne:\n\nMarianne at Lake Como with Johannes van Rossum and with her daughter Charlotte (on her left) and son-in-law Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen. The painting still hangs at Schloss Reinharthausen :\n\nMarianne in middle age:\n\nHuize Rusthof, Voorburg:\n\nOld age:\n\nAfter her travels Marianne settled in Reinharthausen again, where in 1860 her son Johannes-Willem died. The princess lived a quiet life. She still visited church often and was involved in charity. Sometimes she was visited by one of her two remaining children, who were still fond f their mother dispite everything. In 1872 both her husbands died and Marianne lead an even more solitairy life.\n\nIn 1874 Empress Frederick met Princess Marianne for the first time. In a letter to her mother she gives a good insight about Marianne's sad life and her ugly appearance. 'It interested me much to see old Princess Marianne of The Netherlands. She looks like an old dutch picture -with a close white cap around her face- and a little snow white hair at the temples and behind the ears. Her face is so covered with wrinkles and her eyesare so sunk in her head that she looks like a study of Rembrandt and might be 80! (...)\n\nShe made a most melancholy impression on me -to see an old lady, so high placed- who has so entirely forfeited all respect and yet I felt the profoundest pity for the thing, mixed with all those feelings. (...) For 30 years she lived with him [Johannes van Rossum] almost. This low wretch was often tipsey and of late he used to beat her on the street when they walked or drove! She stooped to his sphere so completely that she ceased to be a lady at all! It is so terribly sad to think of a life so mis-spent, and of the sorrow and suffering she brought on her children and grandchildren. Perhaps a little kondness and wise advice in her youth might have saved her, but her husband was neither wise, nor good then, and many mischivious people contributed to her fall'. Queen Victoria replied 'That old Princess Marianne shoulkd wish to see her children I find quite natural. But I can not understand her not having more pride than to wish to return to be condescendingly receiving family to which the husband belonged who used her so ill and who in fact forced her -unprincipled as she was- into a most immoral life'.\n\nThe last time Princess Marianne appeared in public in The Netherlands was in 1880, at the baptism of her great-niece, the future Queen Wilhelmina. She gave the little child a portrait of herself on which she wrote 'Oh there are so many things that I wish for this little girl. I know what it is like to be both Queen and woman. It causes such an internal struggle; many a queen may wish only to be born as a woman'. Wilhelmina kept the small portrait of Marianne in her studyroom untill she died, which must say something as Wilhelmina only surrounded herself there with (deceased) familymembers that she admired.\n\nThe grave of Johannes Willem von Reinharthausen:\n\nMarianne:\n\nAlexandrine:\n\nPrincess Alexandrine (Addy), Marianne's youngest daughter, was described as 'neither clever nor pretty' by Empress Frederick and she had to be protected from her 'horrid uncle' (probably Prince Karl) who tried to 'corrupt her mind'. This did not stop her to have a fondness for Addy to and again she tried to marry one of Marianne's children of to a British relative, this time to the Duke of Cambridge, sadly she failed. In a letter to her mother she told: 'such an excellent girl and much admired here; she had plenty of her own one million dollars of her mother, she would have 100.000 from the King if she married, and the same from her father most likely.\n\nIn the end Alexandrine was married to her cousin, Duke Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (Schnapps), who was a son of King Wilhelm I's favourite sister Alexandrine. With this financially advantageous marriage Alexandrine (the elder) probably wanted to give her second some some kind of financial security in the future. The two were most certainly not in love: Alexandrine cried the entire wedding ceremony, she had reason to cry as Wilhelm was discribed as 'a horrid husband'. This is what the always alert Empress Frederick wrote to her mother about the wedding: 'The wedding was celebrated with the greatest pomp, but had something of the solemnity of a funeral about it - nothing gay, festive or bridal. The only thing that made a pleasing impression on me was dear Addy herself, who although she cried the whole time, had such a dignified and touching appearance that I never saw her look so well. She went through it all with the most perfect tenue - though I never saw her smile once. She did not look a bit like a bride but I must say very elegant and distinguee. (...) The bridegroom's tenance looked as evil as possible the whole time. I looked in vain for a trace of softness of feeling.\n\nAlexandrine was far from happy with her husband and she tried to escape several times, only to be forced back again by pressure from the powerfull Dowager Grand Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Duke Wilhelm died in 1879 after which Alexandrine dedicated her life to her daughter Charlotte and played very little part in public life.\n\nAlexandrine with her aunt, mother-in-law and namesake Grand Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin:\n\nAlexandrine as teenager:\n\nAlexandrine, who inherited her mothers pearl and diamond tiara & brooch:\n\nList of descendants:\n\n1 Princess Charlotte of Prussia (1831-1855), m.1850 Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1826-1914)\n\n...1.1 Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (1851-1928), m.1878 Princess Charlotte of Prussia (1860-1919)\n\n.........1.1.1 Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen (1879-1945), m.1898 Heinrich XXX Reuss (1864-1939)\n\n.........1.1.2 Prince Georg of Saxe-Meiningen (1852-1855)\n\n.........1.1.3 Princess Marie of Saxe-Meiningen (1853-1923)\n\n2 Prince Albrecht of Prussia (1837-1906), m.1873 Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg (1854-1898)\n\n...2.1 Prince Friedrich Heinrich Albrecht of Prussia (1874-1940)\n\n...2.2 Prince Joachim Albrecht of Prussia (1876-1939), m.1st 1919 Marie Sulzer (1872-1919), m.2nd 1920 (div 1936) Karoline\n\n........Stockhammer (1891-1952)\n\n...2.3 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia (1880-1925), m.1910 Princess Agathe of Ratibor and Corvey, Princess of Hohenlohe-\n\n........Schillingsfürst (1888-1960)\n\n.........2.3.1 Princess Marie Therese of Prussia (1911-2005), m.1932 Rudolf Hug (1885-1972)\n\n...............2.3.1.1.Alois Hug (1932-1932)\n\n...............2.3.1.2.Friedrich Wilhelm Hug (b.1932), m. ca 1976 Gisela Peschke\n\n...............2.3.1.3.Albrecht Hug (1933-2000)\n\n...............2.3.1.4.Charlotte Hug (b.1935) m.1961 Erich Brehm (b.1930)\n\n.....................2.3.1.4.1.Bernhard Brehm (b.1962), m.
