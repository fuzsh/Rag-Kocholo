        "text": "Foundation’s biggest European event to date will feature talks by Ant Financial, AT&T, Dyson, Etsy.com, GO-JEK, NTT Corporation, NVIDIA, Offerup, Spotify, Zalando, and more\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – March 13, 2019 – T​he Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which sustains and integrates open source technologies like Kubernetes® and Prometheus™, today announced the session line-up for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe on May 20-23, 2019, in Barcelona. The event features real-world case studies using Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies from experts at ADMIRALTY, Booking.com, British Telecom, Carnegie Mellon, eBay, Engel & Völkers Technology, ING, LinkedIn, LSST & French National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3), Mediakind, McKesson, VTT, and more.\n\nAfter the largest ever KubeCon last December in Seattle with more than 8,000 attendees, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe will bring together more than 10,000 technologists from thriving open source communities across the world to further collaboration around cloud native computing. Maintainers and end users of CNCF’s hosted projects – including Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, CoreDNS, containerd, OpenTracing, Fluentd, gRPC, rkt, CNI, Jaeger, Notary, TUF, Vitess, NATS, Rook, Harbor, etcd, Linkerd, and Helm – and other cloud native technologies will gather for four days to share insights and encourage participation in this fast growing ecosystem. Register for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe by March 20 to save up to $300.\n\n“It’s amazing that we’re on track to grow from the 8,000 in Seattle last December – representing the largest open source developer conference ever – to even more in Barcelona this May,” said Dan Kohn, Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Cloud native computing has crossed the chasm so that developers from hundreds of end user organizations are eager to collaborate with the rest of the community.”\n\nA program committee of 110 experts led by conference co-chairs, VMware’s Bryan Liles and Google Cloud’s Janet Kuo, reviewed 1,535 submissions to help create the show’s diverse content slate. The agenda features an impressive mix of topics, including technical sessions, deep-dives, and case studies covering application & development (includes Helm & Telepresence), CI/CD, customizing & cxtending Kubernetes, fostering the community, machine learning & data, networking (includes NATS, CoreDNS, CNI, and gRPC), observability (includes Jaeger, OpenTracing, Fluentd, and Prometheus), operations, performance + scalability, runtimes (includes containerd and rkt), security, identity & policy (includes OPA, SPIFFE/SPIRE, Notary, and TUF), serverless (includes CloudEvents), storage (includes Vitess and Rook) and more.\n\n“While reviewing the Barcelona submissions, we were amazed by the broad adoption of cloud-native technologies throughout the community, and across all verticals from research organizations to banks. We were also impressed by the new tools and technologies built in this fast-growing ecosystem,” said Janet Kuo, Software Engineer at Google, Co-Chair of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon. “We hope this year’s attendees walk away with new knowledge they hear first-hand from the experts and project maintainers, as well as the hands-on experience of using those technologies in the wild.”\n\n“It’s a huge honor to represent such a fast-growing and diverse community that is fundamentally changing the way we build software and digital experiences,” said Bryan Liles, Senior Staff Engineer at VMware and Conference Co-chair. “This year’s schedule features some of the most innovative and informative sessions we’ve seen, and we look forward to the members coming together to share their knowledge.”\n\nThe community-curated schedule will feature sessions from leading open source technologists, including:\n\n“How Spotify accidentally deleted all its Kube clusters, with no user impact” – David Xia, Spotify\n\n“Getting Started in the Kubernetes Community” – Lucas Käldström & Nikhita Raghunath, Independent\n\n“Reperforming a Nobel Prize Discovery on Kubernetes” – Ricardo Rocha & Lukas Heinrich, CERN\n\n“From COBOL to Kubernetes: A 250 Year Old Bank’s Cloud-Native Journey” – Mike Ryan, Epitech BV & Laura Rehorst, ABN AMRO Bank NV\n\n“Panel Discussion: GitOps & Best Practices for Cloud Native CI/CD” – Moderated by Laura Tacho, CloudBees\n\n“Kubernetes the new Research Platform” – Lindsey Tulloch, Brock University & Bob Killen, University of Michigan\n\n“From Snowflake Servers to Snowflake Clusters – The GitOps Journey” – Allison Richardet, Asteris, LLC & Fabio Giannetti, MasterCard\n\n“Panel Discussion: Democratizing HPC & AI: Startups Scale up with Cloud Native” – Moderated by Emily Tanaka-Delgado, Oracle\n\n“Kubectl Apply 2019: Defense against the Dark Arts” – Phillip Wittrock & Jennifer Buckley, Google\n\n“Helm 3: Navigating To Distant Shores” – Bridget Kromhout, Microsoft & Jessica Deen, Microsoft\n\n“Sharing is Caring: Your Kubernetes Cluster, Namespaces, and You” – Amy Chen, VMware & Eryn Muetzel, VMware\n\n“Panel Discussion: Going Multi-cloud for realz.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of cloud native software stacks, including Kubernetes and Prometheus. CNCF serves as the neutral home for collaboration and brings together the industry’s top developers, end users and vendors – including the world’s largest public cloud and enterprise software companies as well as dozens of innovative startups. CNCF is part of The Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization.
