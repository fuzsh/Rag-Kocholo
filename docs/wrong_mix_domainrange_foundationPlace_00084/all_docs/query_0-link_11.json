Other Rules\n\nYour application must be in English.\n\nYou must complete registration to participate in the Challenge. Individuals must be 18 years of age or older at the time of entry to participate by representing an applicant organization. You cannot reside in nor be governed by countries that are prohibited by law, regulation (including United States or other applicable export laws and regulations), treaty or administrative act from entering into trade relations (including export of technology) with the United States of America or its citizens.\n\nYour Entry must meet the application requirements stipulated on this Website. You must comply with all deadlines posted on this Website. Your Entry may not, in the sole and unfettered discretion of the Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT, contain obscene, provocative, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate content. The Challenge Sponsors reserve the right to cancel, modify or suspend Challenge in whole or in part without liability to You. The Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT also reserve the right to disqualify You from participating.\n\nBy participating in the Communities Thrive Challenge, You represent, warrant, and agree that:\n\nYou are the sole author, creator, and owner of the Entry;\n\nthe Entry is not the subject of any actual or threatened litigation or claim;\n\nthe Entry does not and will not violate or infringe upon the Intellectual Property Rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party;\n\nthe Entry does not and will not contain any harmful computer code (sometimes referred to as \"malware,\" \"viruses\" or \"worms\"); and\n\nthe Entry, and Your use of the Entry, does not and will not violate any applicable laws or regulations, including, without limitation, applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. If the Entry includes any third-party works (such as third-party content or open source code), You must provide the Challenge Sponsors with all appropriate licenses and releases for such third party works. In the event You cannot provide all such required licenses and releases, the Challenge Sponsors reserve the right, in the Challenge Sponsors' sole discretion, to disqualify the applicable Entry.\n\nYou may participate by registering, but You may not register more than one true and uniform identity; multiple registrations for a participant using multiple identities are not allowed. The Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT reserve the right to disqualify any Entry made by a participant violating this limitation, regardless of whether all of the respective parties had knowledge of such violation. You may only submit one Entry.\n\nUpon submitting Your Entry, the Entry will be subjected to an Administrative Review, to ensure compliance with all of the requirements. Qualified Entries will then be distributed to other registrants during a Peer-to-Peer assessment of those Entries. If Your Entry qualifies for Peer-to-Peer review, You will be required to assess five (5) other Entries, using the same trait-scoring rubric that the Expert Panel reviewers will use. If You do not complete those assessments, using the tools and process described on this Website, and/or You disclose the Content of those Entries without permission, Your participation may be terminated. Based on normalized scores from each Peer-to-Peer review, a rank order of the Entries will be populated. Informed by this rank order with consideration given to geographic distribution, organizational size, and issue area, up to eighty (80) Entries will be invited to submit a Round 2 application.\n\nOnce the Round 1 applicants have submitted their Round 2 Entries, those Entries will be subjected to a second Administrative Review to ensure compliance with all of the requirements. All qualified Round 2 Entries will then advance to an Expert Panel review. The Expert Panel consists of experts who are identified on this Website. Each of the Round 2 Entries will be assessed by five Expert Panel members, who will be assigned to score these Entries either randomly or after considering any potential conflicts of interest, using the trait-scoring rubric and any other judging criteria that are also described on this Website. In cases where a Judge indicates any potential conflict of interest, the Entry will be assigned to another Judge. Based on normalized scores from each Expert Panel review, a rank order of the Entries will be populated.\n\nInformed by the rank order as determined by the Expert Panel and with consideration given to geographic distribution, organizational size, and issue area, up to twenty (20) Entries will be named as Finalists. The selection of Finalists is at the sole discretion of the Challenge Sponsors. Finalists will receive an award of $5,000 and will be required to participate in a site visit from the Challenge Sponsors.\n\nOnce the site visits of the Finalists have been completed, the Finalists will be presented to the Selection Committee for final consideration. The Selection Committee will meet to review and discuss the top Entries and will determine any Grantees, using judging criteria that may not incorporate the same trait-scoring rubric employed by any previous assessment(s). The judging criteria are to be applied in the sole discretion of the Selection Committee judges. By participating in the Communities Thrive Challenge, You acknowledge and agree to be bound by the final decision of the Judges.\n\nWhile RAMPIT, LLC (âRAMPITâ) is providing an online platform for your participation, RAMPIT is not responsible for the payment of any Award(s). Payment of any Award(s) is the sole responsibility of the Challenge Sponsors, and under the Terms each participant has agreed to look solely to the Challenge Sponsors for the payment of any Award.\n\nBy submitting your Entry, You agree (on behalf of You and Your organization) irrevocably to release, discharge and hold harmless the Challenge Sponsors, The Common Pool, LLC, and RAMPIT and their partners, affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising agencies, agents and their employees, officers, directors and representatives from any Loss arising out of Your participation in the Challenge and the acceptance and use, misuse, or possession of any Award(s).

In the event of a dispute about the identity of any Competitor, an online registration will be declared as if made by the authorized account holder of the e-mail address submitted at time of entry.\n\nTHIS CHALLENGE IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED. Competitors agree that this Competition shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the United States of America and the forum of any dispute shall be in the courts of the United States of America.\n\nIf for any reason the Challenge is not capable of running as planned, due to infection by computer virus, bugs, worms, Trojan horses, denial of service, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures or any other causes beyond the control of Challenge Sponsors that corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity, or proper conduct of this Challenge, Challenge Sponsors reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to disqualify any individual(s) who tamper with the process, and/or to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend the Challenge. If the Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT terminates the Challenge, Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT will not retain any rights in the submitted Entries.\n\nThe Challenge Sponsors reserve the right in their sole discretion to disqualify any Competitor who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Communities Thrive Challenge, to be acting in violation of these Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Communities Thrive Challenge, or to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other person.\n\nEntry into the Communities Thrive Challenge does not constitute entry into any other Rockefeller Foundation challenge, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative challenge, RAMPIT challenge, or promotion that may be offered by the Challenge Sponsors and/or their affiliates.\n\nThe Challenge Sponsors and/or RAMPIT reserve the right to disqualify any participant who violates these Rules, the TERMS and any standards of behavior expressed or implied in them.\n\nThe names of the Finalists and Grantees will be posted on this Website for such period of time as the Challenge Sponsors deem reasonable.\n\nContact Information:\n\nYou may contact us with any questions or comments about these Rules.

Please select from the options listed below.\n\n1 - 10 employees\n\n11 - 50 employees\n\n51 - 200 employees\n\n201 - 500 employees\n\n501 - 1,000 employees\n\n1,001+ employees\n\nPrevious Funding\n\nHas your organization received an investment or grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative or a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in the past 10 years?\n\nNo\n\nNo, but an affiliated organization has\n\nYes, from The Rockefeller Foundation\n\nYes, from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\n\nNOTE: If the answer is yes, your organization is not eligible for the Communities Thrive Challenge. However, we still welcome you to submit your application as a way for both The Rockefeller Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to get to know you better and learn about your most recent work. Your application will not be reviewed as part of the Challenge. If an affiliated organization has received funding, your organization may be eligible subject to The Rockefeller Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative legal review.\n\nOperating Budget\n\nPlease provide your organizationâs annual operating budget, selecting from the options listed below.\n\nLess than $200,000\n\n$200,001 - $500,000\n\n$500,001 - $750,000\n\n$750,001 - $1,000,000\n\n$1,000,001 - $1,500,000\n\n$1,500,001 - $2,000,000\n\n$2,000,001 - $3,000,000\n\nGreater than $3,000,000\n\nNOTE: If your annual operating budget is less than $200,000, your organization is not eligible for the Communities Thrive Challenge.

Which obstacle(s) to economic opportunity do you seek to eliminate? Why is this problem significant?\n\nYour Approach (200 words)\n\nDescribe your organizationâs approach to addressing the problem(s) described above (e.g., a theory of change, strategy, or model).

Potential for Scale\n\nNot every program has the potential for scale â some approaches are expressly designed for specific local contexts or populations. Both The Rockefeller Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative have been honored to support such efforts in the past.\n\nHowever, the Communities Thrive Challenge is specifically looking for organizations that have a model or approach that has great potential for impact at scale with the appropriate new resources, investment, strategy, and partnerships. No organization can achieve impact at scale alone!\n\nWe have a broad definition of scale. Market expansion is one way to expand an organizationâs reach. But scale can also be achieved by disseminating your model to a national network for implementation by others, building an alliance with partners across your region, partnering with government, influencing public or private policy, mobilizing or tapping into a movement, introducing a new product, sharing new data or insight, and by other means.\n\nApproach to Scale (150 words)\n\nHow could your approach be effective at a larger scale? If you had $1M of unrestricted grant funding, how might you scale your approach? What do you think others could learn from your approach?\n\nD.

How does your leadership team reflect the community you work with? Why are these individuals uniquely qualified to lead your organization?\n\nOther Considerations (100 words)\n\nIf there is any other information you would like reviewers to consider, please include it here.\n\nOnly organizations that have been invited to apply to the second round may complete this application. If you have been invited, congratulations on advancing to Round Two of the Communities Thrive Challenge!\n\nPlease read all of the application requirements before completing each section. Applications will be available for download in several languages but must be submitted in English. There are a number of ways to fill out this application.

When you have completed all of the requirements, a confirmation message will be displayed on the screen. At that point, you can submit your final application. Once you have submitted the application, you will no longer be able to make changes. By submitting this application, you agree to the terms & conditions, rules & privacy policy, and you've granted us license to post portions of this application on our website (NOTE: We will never post your financial information or the writing about challenges that you face).\n\nYou must submit your application no later than Monday, August 6, 2018 at 5:00 PM Pacific.\n\nA.

Refer to the Eligibility Guidelines in the Rules for further information).\n\nPRINCIPAL ORGANIZATION\n\nProvide the legal name of the principal organization responsible for receiving and taking accountability for any grant funds, as well as providing the direction, control, and supervision for the work, if awarded. Identify a single point of contact who will assume a key leadership role coordinating dedicated team members and/or affiliated organizations.\n\nPrincipal Organization (Potential Grantee)\n\nOrganization Legal Name:*\n\nStreet Address*\n\nAddress Line 2\n\nCity*\n\nState*\n\nPostal / Zip Code*\n\nPoint of Contact\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nPosition/Title*\n\nEmail Address*\n\nPhone Number*\n\nTeam Applications (150 words)\n\nIf you have chosen to apply as a team, please explain why. How can you ensure this will be an effective partnership? Have the organizations worked together in the past? If you are not applying as a team, please enter âNot applicable.â\n\nB. Impact\n\nWe are looking for organizations that effectively and consistently deliver results that address significant, urgent, and complex problems.\n\nResults & Effectiveness (350 words)\n\nOn the Round One application, we asked you about your results and how you know your approach is working.

Please provide relevant information, data, or evidence. Has your organization run any pilots, evaluations, or other research? How do you incorporate that data or insight into your work?\n\nHas your organization or approach ever been externally evaluated? (NOTE: This is not a requirement for the Communities Thrive Challenge) If so, describe the results.\n\nInformation Sources\n\nWe value a variety of data that your approach is working (e.g. informal feedback, survey, interview, or focus groups). What kind of data, if any, do you collect? Please select all that apply.\n\nInformally check in with the people you serve to see how things are going\n\nFormally collect and document qualitative feedback\n\nRoutinely collect program and other data on progress\n\nPilot or user test new programs, products, or policies\n\nInternally conduct evaluation or assessment of outcomes\n\nExternally conduct evaluation or assessment of outcomes\n\nExternal randomized control trial\n\nOther\n\nC. Potential for Scale\n\nNot every program has the potential for scale â some approaches are expressly designed for specific local contexts or populations. Both the Rockefeller Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative have been honored to support such efforts in the past.\n\nHowever, the Communities Thrive Challenge is specifically looking for organizations that have a model or approach that has great potential for impact at scale with the appropriate new resources, investment, strategy, and partnerships.

But scale can also be achieved by disseminating your model to a national network for implementation by others, building an alliance with partners across your region, partnering with government, influencing public or private policy, mobilizing or tapping into a movement, introducing a new product, sharing new data or learnings, and by other means.\n\nVision for Scale (500 words)\n\nOn the Round One application, you were asked to consider how your approach could be effective at a larger scale. Now, weâd like you to expand your imagination and vision for scale. How would you define âimpact at scaleâ for your organization or approach? Picture 10 years into the future: your organization/program/policy/product/movement has transformed lives and communities. How did this happen? What role did your organization play?\n\nBarriers to Scale or Challenges (150 words)\n\nAside from financial resources, what other challenges or barriers (internal and external) do you currently face in achieving the vision for scale described above? Please identify the top three, including at least one that is internal (i.e., an operating challenge that is not solely the product of outside political, social, or economic forces).\n\nD. Community Engagement, Inclusion & Partnerships\n\nOrganizations that are driven and informed by the community are often most effective at addressing the needs of their target population.\n\nCommunity Engagement (350 words)\n\nIn Round One, we asked you to briefly explain how you collaborate and ensure your work is informed by the community. Now we would like to dig a bit deeper: Specifically, how have you engaged your community (or communities) in your work? What tactics have you used in your outreach and engagement? How are the people you are trying to serve actively involved in designing and improving your work? Please provide an example of how you have modified your approach in response to community feedback.\n\nInclusiveness (150 words)\n\nPlease explain how your organization works to be inclusive of all people, regardless of ability (mental and/or physical), age, ethnicity, gender, migration or veteran status, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and socioeconomic background.\n\nCross Sector Collaboration & Partnerships (150 words)\n\nWho are your most important partners and allies, whether government, businesses, or nonprofits? How, if at all, does your organizationâs current success and your vision for scale depend on these partners and allies?\n\nE. Leadership\n\nWe are seeking leaders who are well-positioned to support the organization through growth and scaling, demonstrate a strong history and commitment to the field of work, and authentically represent the populations they serve.\n\nYour Leadership Team (150 words)\n\nOn application Round One, we asked you about your leadership team. Is there anything we didnât learn about your leaders in Round One that you would like to add now? If this application is being submitted on behalf of a team of organizations, please make sure we know about the leaders from all of the organizations (not just the principal organization that is the potential grantee).\n\nResumes\n\nAdditionally, please upload a PDF file that includes the resumes/CVs for the three most senior leaders of the organization (or primary organization if applying as a team), including the person responsible for your organizationâs financial health. Please combine all resumes into one file as you are only allowed to upload one file.\n\nF. Financial Requirements\n\nCurrent Amount of Funding\n\nWhat is the total amount of current and expected funding (including philanthropic and government dollars, earned revenue, debt, etc.) for the current fiscal year? Please indicate when you fiscal year begins.\n\nPrior Fiscal Year Funding\n\nWhat was the total amount of funding for the prior fiscal year?\n\nCurrent Funding Sources\n\nWhat are your current and expected sources of funding? (NOTE: The total amount of current funding above must match the total amount in this table.)\n\nCurrent Funding Sources Narrative (150 words)\n\nHow did you tap into these resources? Will these resources be available in the future? Describe your three-year funding plan. Is there anything else youâd like us to know about your funding sources?\n\nBudget Narrative Description (150 words)\n\nPlease offer a general overview for how you would use the grant of $1,000,000 if selected. If youâve chosen to focus your application on a particular project, please also include the expected operating budget for the rest of your organization. This should include, in broad terms, total projected needs by function and/or division. You may include any explanations of existing resources you have secured.\n\nBudget\n\nWe understand organizational needs are constantly changing and are committed to offering unrestricted funding to our final portfolio of 501(c)(3) public charity grantees. By law, however, grant funding must be restricted to specific charitable projects of any organization that is not a 501(c)(3) public charity. Depending on your organizational structure, please follow the instructions below:\n\nIf you are a 501(c)(3) public charity, please provide an illustrative line item budget for how you would spend the $1,000,000 if you received it today. (NOTE: Should you become a grantee, you would not be bound by this budget. The grant will be for general operating support -- the illustrative budget is a way for reviewers to get a rough sense of how you would use the grant.)\n\nIf you are not a 501(c)(3) public charity, please provide a detailed line item budget for how you would spend the $1,000,000 grant if you received it today. The budget should include a detailed breakdown of staff hours dedicated to the project to help us understand how your work serves a charitable purpose.\n\nPlease make sure that any funds identified in this table reflect and clarify your general explanations provided in your budget narrative.\n\nFinancial Sustainability (150 words)\n\nThe Communities Thrive Challenge grant will contribute to your organizationâs work, but additional resources may be required. If additional funds are needed, please describe your plans to secure those funds. Describe how you plan to ensure your organizationâs financial sustainability over the next few years.\n\nG. Compliance for Applicants that are not Section 501(c)(3) Public Charities\n\nThis section of the application are only required for organizations that are not 501(c)(3) public charities. Your responses to these questions may be reviewed in order to determine if your organization qualifies to receive a grant, based on whether you can satisfy the policies and standards of The Rockefeller Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the laws applicable to them. As a reminder, grant funds can only be used for charitable purposes. Please see the rules and conditions for more information.\n\nCharitable Purpose (150 words)\n\nWhat is the charitable purpose of your work? Describe how the public or a subset, which is a charitable class, will benefit from your approach. A charitable class must generally be an indefinite number of individuals who are the subject of the charitable purpose and not a limited number of specified individuals. For example, the class can be needy persons within a disadvantaged community but not a specified person in the community, even if the person is disadvantaged. There can be a comparatively small number of individuals, if the individuals are not identified and the class is open ended.\n\nPrivate Benefit (150 words)\n\nWill private interests (such as shareholders, for-profit companies, contractors, consultants, or other individuals) benefit more than incidentally from the work as compared to the public or charitable benefit? If your approach will trigger any private benefit to one or more individuals, provide an explanation of how the public benefit cannot be achieved without necessarily benefiting those individuals and to what degree any private benefit compares to public benefit.\n\nH. Your Video Pitch\n\nYou are required to submit a video presentation that captures your own pitch for why your approach should be funded. You will upload a short digital film using YouTube. Set the Privacy Settings on your video to Public or Unlisted; do not set them to Private. Your video may be extracted from your submission and made available to the public.\n\nYour video should comply with the following guidelines. If it does not, your submission may be invalid and no longer eligible for an award.\n\nA length of no more than 90 seconds.\n\nOnly one to two people should present during the video.\n\nDialogue should be in English, or, if in another language, subtitled in English.\n\nNot contain identifiable children without parent consent.\n\nHere are general suggestions for delivering a high-quality video pitch:\n\nIntroduce yourself and your organization and/or team.\n\nWhat problem are you trying to solve?\n\nWhat is your approach?\n\nWhat is unique about your approach? And how could it expand its reach?\n\nHow would you achieve greater impact if you had the necessary resources?\n\nHone your content:\n\nKeep your description and language simple.\n\nDemonstrate passion through your words and enthusiasm.\n\nFocus on providing a personal connection and telling us about why your work matters; we are not looking for Hollywood production values. This is about showcasing your passion and approach, not your movie-making chops.\n\nI. Information for Finalists\n\nWe expect to name 20 Finalists in late August 2018. If you are selected, you will be expected to:\n\nHost The Rockefeller Foundation and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative teams for a site visit between September 4 and 21, 2018.\n\nProvide up to three years of audited financial records and tax statements for the principal organization.\n\nProvide references.\n\nPossibly answer further questions about your organizationâs operations and financial systems during a due diligence process, including being responsive to request for phone calls or documents (reply requested within 48 hours) from The Rockefeller Foundation and/or Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\n\nIf you are part of a team application, provide a fully executed Letter of Intent (LOI) or other similar agreement, executed by all parties, that a single eligible entity or organization will serve as the grantee and will have direction, control, and supervision of the proposed project and management of all grant funds and reporting requirements.\n\nWelcome, and thank you for your interest in the Communities Thrive Challenge.
