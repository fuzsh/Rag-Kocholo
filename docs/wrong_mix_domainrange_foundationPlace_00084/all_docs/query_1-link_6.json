        "text": "AT&T, Box, Cisco, Cloud Foundry Foundation, CoreOS, Cycle Computing, Docker, eBay, Goldman Sachs, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Kismatic, Mesosphere, Red Hat, Switch SUPERNAP, Twitter, Univa, VMware and Weaveworks join new effort to build and maintain cloud native distributed systems\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 21, 2015 – The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux and collaborative development, today announced the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.\n\nThis new organization aims to advance the state-of-the-art for building cloud native applications and services, allowing developers to take full advantage of existing and to-be-developed open source technologies. Cloud native refers to applications or services that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled and micro services-oriented.\n\nFounding organizations include AT&T, Box, Cisco, Cloud Foundry Foundation, CoreOS, Cycle Computing, Docker, eBay, Goldman Sachs, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Joyent, Kismatic, Mesosphere, Red Hat, Switch SUPERNAP, Twitter, Univa, VMware and Weaveworks. Other organizations are encouraged to participate as founding members in the coming weeks, as the organization establishes its governance model.\n\n“The Cloud Native Computing Foundation will help facilitate collaboration among developers and operators on common technologies for deploying cloud native applications and services,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation. “By bringing together the open source community’s very best talent and code in a neutral and collaborative forum, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation aims to advance the state of the art of application development at Internet scale.”\n\nCloud native application development allows Internet companies to practically scale their businesses. Today this work is resource intensive, requiring companies to assemble a team of experts that can integrate disparate technologies and maintain all of them. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation intends to ease this process for developers and businesses by driving alignment among technologies and platforms.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation plans to create and drive the adoption of a new set of common container technologies driven and informed by technical merit and end user value and that is inspired by Internet-scale computing. This work seeks to improve the overall developer experience, paving the way for faster code reuse, improved machine efficiency, reduced costs and increases in the overall agility and maintainability of applications.\n\nThe Foundation will look at open source at the orchestration level, followed by the integration of hosts and services by defining API’s and standards through a code first approach to advance the state-of-art of container-packaged application infrastructure. The organization will also work with the recently announced Open Container Initiative on its container image specification. Beyond orchestration and the image specification, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation aims to assemble components to address a comprehensive set of container application infrastructure needs.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation will be responsible for stewardship of the projects, fostering growth and evolution of the ecosystem, promoting the technologies and serving the community by making the technology accessible and widely adopted. The Foundation will include a Technical Oversight Committee and an End User Advisory board to ensure alignment of needs between the technical and end-user communities.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation is a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project. Collaborative Projects are independently supported software projects that harness the power of collaborative development to fuel innovation across industries and ecosystems. By spreading the collaborative DNA of the largest collaborative software development project in history, The Linux Foundation provides the essential collaborative and organizational framework so project hosts can focus on innovation and results. Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects span the enterprise, mobile, embedded and life sciences markets and are backed by many of the largest names in technology.
