        "text": "Free enterprise allows for individuals to have large economic freedoms with some regulations from the government. Many entrepreneur have taken advantage of the system and gained immense wealth. A great example is Bill Gate who has made a huge contribution to the technological industry. His investments in companies like microsoft has helped make it one of the biggest companies in the world. Without a lot of restrictions from the government Bill Gates's fortune grew and without free enterprise his companies wouldn't be as huge as they are now.\n\nWhat would a computer be without an operating system? People wouldn't be able to use computers if it weren’t for Bill Gates' innovative and genius invention. Everyone uses a computer some way, whether it's a phone or a PC. Everyone's life would be very different if it weren’t for Bill Gates’ operating system. Bill Gates revolutionized the computer industry in the following ways: his creation of Microsoft, innovative business strategies, building a software platform, the Bill and Melinda Foundation, and the Common Core Standards.\n\n“The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history. And their lives will improve more than anyone else’s” (Gates, Bill and Melinda 1). This is the big bet of Bill and Melinda Gates for the future. In the 2015 Gates annual letter, they discuss the opportunity in accelerating progress towards a big impact around the world. Their four major breakthroughs range from new vaccinations to innovations in technology. The first breakthrough specifically focuses on child deaths and diseases, and how these can be eradicated over time. There has only been one time in history where a disease was completely destroyed. If this is such difficult work, then how are they so sure that it can be done?\n\nBill Gates (William Henry Gates III) was “brought” to this world on October 28, 1955 in the “lands” of Seattle, Washington. He growed up in an upper-class family with his two sisters: Kristianne and Libby Gates. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a shy and promising law student when he met his “future” wife, Mary Maxwell, who was an ongoing student as an athletic in the University of Washington. Mary, at the time, was actively involved in student affairs and leadership. His families atmosphere is very warm and close and all of the three children, including Bill himself, were all promoted to be competitive and academically intelligent by their parents. However, Bill showed early signs of “competitiveness” whenever he plans to play board games, such as Monopoly and Risk, with the family at their summer house located in Puget Sound. In his childhood, Bill had a very close relationship with his mother since she would often take\n\nAfter Gates graduated high school, with a perfect 800 on the SAT, he went to Harvard law school in 1973 (“Gates, Bill” 2) (“Gates, William Henry, III” 1). In 1975 his friend Paul Allen came up to him while Bill was in college and showed him a Popular Mechanics article about a $350 microcomputer, Gates read this article and was convinced that he wanted to be in the computer industry (“Gates, William Henry, III” 1). As a sophomore in college he and Paul Allen made the computer language BASIC compatible to microcomputers, this took much skill and he was the first to do it (Leaders of info 2). He did this for a company called MITS (Leaders of info 2). This shows his motivation to do well in the world, and to be successful. With this new success in the BASIC software, he dropped out of Harvard and went to pursue his new career (“Gates, Bill 1). He went to Albuquerque, New Mexico with Paul and they both founded a new company called Microsoft to mass produce their new software (Leaders of Info 2).\n\nIn addition to his work at Microsoft, Gates was also known for his charitable work. With his wife, Melinda, he launched the William H. Gates Foundation (renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1999) in 1994 to fund global health programs as well as projects in the Pacific Northwest. When Microsoft released Windows, Apple sued them claiming that it was a copy of their operating system that ran on Apple computers. Microsoft eventually won the lawsuit. In 1975, Microsoft had yearly revenue of $16,005. In 2000 that number had grown to $22.96 billion, and Microsoft currently employs\n\nThe major foundation that I chose to talk about is the Bill Gates and Melinda Foundation. Their foundation is one of the world largest philanthropic organization. There is a 43.5-billion-dollar trust which 3 billion is given out yearly in grant payment to help the poor people in developing countries. The foundation place emphasis on getting rid of malaria, polio, and controlling the spread of TB and HIV. This is achieved through prevention, immunizations and vaccinations. In 2010 Gates added two more things to his list by investing in systems that can help remove long lasting planet-warming emission, from fuel that burns carbon dioxide, from the air ( ). He believes that we need to get the carbon dioxide level in the air down\n\nA leader is someone that you can look up to, someone who has a conglomerate of attributes that motivate people to follow them. There are many reasons why you can find someone amusing, intriguing or interesting but the conglomerate of actions performed by them is what makes them stand over others. A global leader is someone who has transcends the geographical limits with their contributions not only to their field but to humanity as well. In this essay I will briefly discussed the attributes of the global leader I selected, his visions and his contributions to\n\nThe next funding source that will be discussed is the Walton Foundation which is Walmart stores. According to Compact.org (2013) Walmart foundation believes in operating globally while giving back locally they can create an impact in the neighborhoods where the reside. Walmart offers several grant opportunities such as community grant program where they provide grants to local organizations while striving to keep a mission where they create opportunities so people can live better lives. The Walton foundation also takes pride on making a positive impact in the communities they serve. There grants are not specific to technology but anyone can apply for whatever their needs are.\n\nLet’s suppose you are walking down the street on a Sunday afternoon when out of nowhere you see a man get shot. You rush over to this man and can tell that he doesn’t have more than a few moments left. As his dying wish he makes you promise to give his fortune of $10 million dollars to his best friend Bill Gates. As you are walking over to Bill Gates house you see a sign for Children’s Miracle Network Hospital asking for $10 million dollars for research on a rare genetic disease that could save 100,000 lives. What do you do? Would you keep your promise to the dying man and give this money to Bill Gates or would you do what would help more people by donating the money to Children’s Miracle Network Hospital? If you decided to donate the money to charity to save an immense amount of lives you would side with teleological theory whereas if you decided to keep your promise and give the money to Bill Gates, you would be agreeing with deontological theory. These theories have deeply divided modern ethics today. I would choose to agree with teleological theory to dishonor my promise with this dying man to be able to bring more happiness on earth. I believe that if more people lived by the teleological theory the world would be a better place today."
