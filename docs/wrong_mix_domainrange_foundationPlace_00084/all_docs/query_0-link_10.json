We are here to make a difference in the world in which we all live. Our diversity is one of our greatest strengths because we appreciate the value that lived experience brings to our work. The right people with the right attitude make us who we are. We come from a variety of backgrounds with advanced degrees in psychology, public health, urban and regional planning, sociomedical sciences, public policy, social work, education, business administration and economics. Joining community Science means that you are joining a lifelong learning and professional development process. Community Science invests heavily in the professional development of its team members to further advance their expertise, research skills, and other competencies. We are active in presenting at national and international professional and practitioner forums.\n\nCross-cultural competence is a core capacity for our company and our people. In addition to their lived experience, Community Science staff are fluent in several languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Malay, Italian, and French. Language proficiency, however, is not the most important element of our capacity to work across cultures. We spend a great deal of time learning about the social organization, customs, norms, and history of the groups with whom we work, enabling us to build upon the strengths of different culture. Because of our cultural competence, Community Science staff members have been able to work effectively with communities and organizations throughout Latin America, Africa, Canada, Europe, Russia, and Southeast Asia, in addition to different ethnic communities throughout the United States."
