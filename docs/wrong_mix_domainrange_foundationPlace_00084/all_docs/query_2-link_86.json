        "text": "SEATTLE, WA — May 4, 2021 — Upbound, creator of the open source Crossplane project, is Diamond sponsor of Crossplane Community Day Europe at KubeCon + Cloud Native Con EU. Upbound CEO Bassam Tabbara provided the keynote address: “Crossplane at the Crossroads.”\n\nTabbara described how Crossplane, an open source project donated by Upbound to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, unleashes the hidden superpower of Kubernetes—its control plane—and extends it to manage resources from different cloud and infrastructure vendors. Operators can encapsulate policies, permissions, and other guardrails behind a custom API line generated by Crossplane, and application developers can self-service from the API without needing to become infrastructure experts.\n\nTabbara also shared several initiatives within the community and CNCF that the community is working on, including a conformance program for distributions and providers, as well as progress toward the Crossplane project being promoted to incubation status.\n\n“We started Crossplane because early on we saw the power of the operating model pioneered by the Kubernetes community and wanted to take it beyond container orchestration. We believe containers are simply the first use case for this model and that this model is applicable to all applications and infrastructure that organizations are managing.”\n\n“We see Crossplane and Kubernetes ushering a new era of application and infrastructure management that will lead to a much higher degree of self-service and automation. These are a prerequisite to increasing the pace of innovation,” said Tabbara.\n\nCrossplane Providers Available Today\n\nCrossplane supports infrastructure from all the major cloud providers, and the community is constantly working on new providers. The current list of available providers includes:\n\nAlibaba Cloud\n\nAWS\n\nEquinix\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform\n\nIBM Cloud\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nRed Hat\n\nTerraform\n\nVMware\n\nCrossplane Community Celebrates Progress\n\nSince the Crossplane project’s initial release in 2018, the community has seen tremendous growth. Daniel Mangum—a maintainer of the Crossplane project, a senior software engineer at Upbound, and a member of the Crossplane Community Day program committee—said, “We have seen folks from all over the world discover the project and identify with the pain points it addresses. These individuals and organizations have come together to shape the direction of the technology, as well as build an open and welcoming community. Over the last year, Crossplane's maturity has been especially evident in its donation to the CNCF, the release of a stable v1.0 version, and its wide adoption in enterprise settings.”\n\nUpbound and AWS are major sponsors of Crossplane Community Day, alongside Red Hat and VSHN.\n\nCommunity Highlights:\n\n3,300+ stars on Github (Get started on GitHub)\n\n2500+ followers on Twitter (@crossplane_io)\n\n30 million container pulls\n\n2000+ Slack members (register here)\n\nEnd-User Adoption (A selection of users running Crossplane in staging or production):\n\nAbsa Group\n\nAccenture\n\nAmdocs\n\nAkirix\n\nAppvia\n\nCloudCheckr\n\nDell Technologies\n\nDeutsche Bahn\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nGuidewire\n\nHumn\n\nInfraCloud\n\nKiratech\n\nMastercard\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nMothership\n\nNTT\n\nNine Cloud Navigators\n\nSAP\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\nVodafone\n\nVSHN AG\n\nAbout Upbound.io\n\nUpbound is the company behind the open source Crossplane project.
