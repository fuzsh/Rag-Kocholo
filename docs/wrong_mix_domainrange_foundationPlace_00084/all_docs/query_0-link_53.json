        "text": "For the first time in a generation a radical agenda for systemic economic transformation is taking shape on the British Left at the level of both ideas and practice. Offering real, on-the-ground solutions to communities and regions battered by successive waves of disinvestment, deindustrialisation, displacement, and disempowerment, it is based on a new configuration of institutions and approaches capable of producing more sustainable, lasting, and democratic outcomes. Rooted in place-based economics, democratic participation and control, and mobilising the untapped power of the local public sector, this emerging new political economy is also striking for being a transatlantic agenda—one that can find and is increasingly finding powerful application in both the United Kingdom under ambitious local authorities, and in the United States via the emboldened left politics of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats.\n\nFor the first time in a generation, a radical agenda for systemic economic transformation is taking shape on the British left at the level of both ideas and practice. Offering real, on-the-ground solutions to communities and regions battered by successive waves of disinvestment, deindustrialisation, displacement, and disempowerment, it is based on a new configuration of institutions and approaches capable of producing more sustainable, lasting, and democratic outcomes. Rooted in place-based economics, democratic participation and control, and mobilising the untapped power of the local public sector, this emerging new political economy is also striking for being a transatlantic agenda – one that can find, and is increasingly finding, powerful application in both the UK under a number of ambitious local authorities, and in the US via the emboldened left politics of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats.\n\nThis book describes how municipal governments all over the world are being asked to do more and more with fewer and fewer resources. National governments are delegating responsibilities to cities and towns, but not the budgets to match. The disconnect between the demands on city administrations and their capacity to provide services means that inequalities are being exacerbated, critical human needs go wanting, and the pressures of crime, poverty, illness, and the deterioration of public infrastructure continually add to the vicious cycle of underinvestment and impoverishment. The book uses the principles of system dynamics to demonstrate how yesterday’s solutions have turned the problems cities are facing today. It points to a new approach for city planning that builds on assets as a starting point for cities to develop healthy social, governance, economic, and environmental systems. It helps communities understand the forces that support unsustainable systems, giving them new ways...\n\nBuilding from the “Progressive Cities” era toolkit, advocates of community economic development (CED) today deploy a wide range of new and well-established strategies. How can planners make theoretical and practical sense of these varying tactics? Using New York as a case and sociological strategic action field theory as a framing device, we find evidence of three distinct CED logics: exactive/concessionary, localist, and transformative/democratic. We differentiate these logics based on their relationship to neoliberalism and globalization, forces which have shaped CED’s historical development. Awareness of these ideal-type logics may assist planners and CED actors in selecting and coordinating contextually appropriate strategies."
