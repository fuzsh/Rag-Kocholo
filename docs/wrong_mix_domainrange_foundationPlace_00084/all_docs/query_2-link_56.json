        "text": "With this new edge computing architecture, developers can build applications for mobile end users and wireless devices, with low latency. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for businesses and organizations of all types and sizes, including next-generation artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), automated vehicles, real-time monitoring and control, and so much more.\n\n5G Edge can provide:\n\nA fully integrated network and computing environment\n\nEase in performing data analytics locally\n\nConsistently lower latency for workloads and applications (e.g., closed-loop control systems, autonomous machines, robotics, AR/VR, IoT performance tracking)\n\n5G Edge private MEC helps support customer data and application sovereignty.\n\n5G Edge could also deliver services specific to an environment and industry, such as oil and mining operations, manufacturing plants, hospitals, universities, public safety and other government facilities, sports arenas, and business campuses. Local computing could be particularly beneficial for organizations with a large number of connected devices. ThingSpace provides the tools, resources and support to help you accelerate development of edge devices and get them to market faster.\n\nExpand opportunities, capabilities and sources of revenue\n\nIndustries across the board could create more agile, efficient and proactive practices, realize new opportunities for value capture and creation, and deliver customer experiences with the following benefits:\n\nLow end-to-end network latencies resulting in fast application response times\n\nReduction in transport bandwidth cost\n\nIncreased data localization and sovereignty, and better analytics\n\nStreamlined, more power-efficient end devices\n\nContext-aware quality of experience (QoE) enhancements\n\nImprove performance.\n\nUltrahigh speed and low latency are requirements for many transformational projects, and 5G Edge is designed to help reduce application response times and increase performance. Private wireless deployments can help reduce response times and increase performance even further.\n\nActivate near real-time data.\n\nData is the new differentiator—the faster and better you can harness, process, analyze and use it, the bigger the advantage. Data is gathered and acted on closer to where it’s created or used to help enable contextually aware applications and more-efficient operations.\n\nAlign mobile and cloud strategies.\n\n5G Edge works with connectivity and device management solutions that can help enable the alignment of mobile and cloud strategies.\n\nRealize the full potential of the IoT.\n\nThe high speed and low latency of 5G Edge can help support the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT)—particularly mission-critical communications. 5G Edge can also help address IoT challenges such as device energy usage and battery life. Verizon Private 5G Network helps support massive IoT deployments.\n\nEnhance security and reliability.\n\nResources at the edge and on-premises means Verizon customers can localize data, which can help them improve security and better execute on data management strategies. Private wireless deployments can help provide even higher levels of security, keeping all critical data on premises.\n\nWe believe many industries could benefit from 5G Edge. Here are just a few of our top picks:\n\nDistribution and Supply Chain\n\nGlobal distribution and supply chain leaders could benefit from near real-time supply chain solutions that deliver end-to-end visibility and control from production through consumption.\n\nGaming\n\nOnline gaming companies could offer subscription-based gaming services, while enabling immersive experiences on mobile devices running on 5G networks.\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nAdvancements in computer vision along with machine learning have given rise to more interactive and convenient fan experiences in venues of all sizes, while providing venue owners and operators more visibility and intelligence thanks to data-driven decision-making as well as near real-time monitoring and analytics. As a result, better crowd management, accelerated ticketing and cashierless payment options are now available.\n\nRetail\n\nRetailers could use 5G Edge to implement granular product tracking, create immersive experiences, automate points of sale (POS), drive interactive signage and smart package sorting, and gather insights about in-the-moment customer behavior.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n5G Edge could enable AI, near real-time connectivity and other leading-edge technologies to fight fraud, power humanized assistants, speed up loan transactions, shorten settlement cycles, and accelerate market forecasting, buying and selling.\n\nHealthcare*\n\n5G Edge may have broad application in healthcare solutions. They could include delivering deep visibility into the pharmaceutical supply chain, supporting faster, more-detailed diagnostics, enabling robotic and remote surgery and near real-time patient monitoring, and providing navigation for visually impaired individuals.\n\nManufacturing\n\nFrom improved 3D modeling, maintenance and supply chain management to automated vehicles, robots, digital twins, materials tracking and quality assurance processes, 5G Edge could help catalyze widespread transformation across the manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nTransportation and Automotive\n\n5G Edge could support smart dock technologies to help improve safety, security and productivity, as well as enhance quality of travel, and improve tracking and auditing of vehicles, packages and people. 5G Edge could also play a transformative role in the field of autonomous vehicles and C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle to Everything) applications for passenger, vehicle, road and pedestrian safety.\n\nVerizon has expertise in building, maintaining and operating both public and private networks, and remotely managing hundreds of millions of devices. We invest billions of dollars every year so that our networks are resilient and future-ready. And just as critically, we understand digital transformation and have the experience and expertise to help organizations evolve and advance. It’s why 97% of the Fortune 500 count on us to help their enterprises thrive. Other advantages include:\n\n5G Ultra Wideband\n\nVerizon 5G Ultra Wideband is paving the way for a new era of business innovations with ultra-fast speeds and low latency.\n\nCarrier-grade\n\nPrivate carrier-grade deployments at the Verizon customer premises provide even lower latency and are complementary with other existing networking technologies.\n\nNetwork density\n\nVerizon 5G Edge is a mobile edge computing (MEC) platform. And MEC is all about moving computing and related infrastructure closer to the end user, so we’re building out service access points (SAPs) across our extensive network. Those SAPs, along with fiber, small-cell technology and other network densification efforts, help ensure that Verizon can support our customers’ next-generation application requirements. Private wireless network deployment solutions provide even more flexibility and availability.\n\nVirtualization from core to edge\n\nHaving virtualized the core of its network, Verizon is taking significant steps forward in virtualizing the radio access network (RAN) edge and moving computing functionality to the edge of the network. This is what makes 5G Edge possible.\n\nSecurity and quality of service (QoS)\n\n5G Ultra Wideband embeds security protocols that help ensure Verizon customer user and development environments are secure, while managing the quality of your experiences based on user type or policy service levels. It’s a more secure, high-performance alternative to Wi-Fi.\n\nVerizon 5G Edge Services\n\n5G Edge Services is a unique platform that provides developers, Verizon customers and partners the tools to build and deploy edge applications across a distributed infrastructure, along with management capabilities for greater visibility and control. It utilizes an intuitive dashboard to easily manage and control performance of the MEC infrastructure as well as device connectivity and application deployment. To simplify development and deployment of applications, there are standard APIs available that provide a plug-and-play experience. The end-to-end visibility enabled by 5G Edge Services provides network-driven insights and services which help Verizon customers better manage their overall experience. Best of all, this platform is available to all 5G Edge customers at no cost today."
