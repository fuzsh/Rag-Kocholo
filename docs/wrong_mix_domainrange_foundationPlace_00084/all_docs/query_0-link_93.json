A disaster is defined as the negative impact of a natural or man-made hazard on society or the environment. Natural disasters occur when natural hazards impact vulnerable areas and can include floods, cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, and landslides. Developing countries are often more vulnerable to natural disasters due to factors like poverty, lack of infrastructure, and environmental degradation. While it is impossible to fully prevent natural disasters, their impacts can be reduced through early warning systems, disaster resilient development, mobilizing emergency resources, and post-disaster rehabilitation. Space technology plays an important role in disaster management through earth observation satellites, communication satellites, and providing data for preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.",
