        "text": "High Performance Software Foundation (HPSF) is an open-source, vendor neutral hub for high performance software projects, working groups, events, and training. HPSF aims to build, promote, and advance a portable software stack for high performance computing (HPC) by increasing adoption, lowering barriers to contribution, and supporting development efforts. Our focus is on providing projects with the resources and connections they need to bring their projects to maturity and to increase usage across HPC, AI, scientific software, security, and other communities.\n\nThe Linux Foundation announced the intention to form the HPSF on November 13, 2023. From January to May, 2024, HPSF founding members and projects met to establish a founding charter and an initial directed fund. With that work now complete, HPSF launched at ISC-HPC 2024.\n\nThe initial HPSF Governing Board (GB) will begin to bootstrap HPSF governance in May, filling elected seats and establishing an initial Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). Soon after, HPSF will establish initial technical working groups, activities, and events.\n\nHPSF will set up a technical advisory committee (TAC) to manage working groups tackling a variety of HPC topics, and will follow a governance model based on the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nInitial working groups include:\n\nContinuous Integration resources tailored for HPC projects\n\nContinuously built, turnkey software stacks\n\nArchitecture support\n\nPerformance regression testing and benchmarking\n\nWorking groups are crosscutting activities, bringing projects, members, and other technical contributors together around activities that benefit the ecosystem.\n\nYou can find more information on the working groups and collaboration model in our launch deck.\n\nGovernance documents are in our governance repo on GitHub, including the HPSF Charter.\n\nIf you are interested in joining HPSF as a member, you can sign up in LFX, Linux Foundationâ€™s onboarding platform.\n\nProjects will need to be approved by the TAC, which is currently being formed.\n\nWe are in the process of setting up mailing lists, but for now, for questions on either membership or project onboarding, contact:\n\nTodd Gamblin tgamblin@llnl.gov and\n\nChristian Trott crtrott@sandia.gov."
