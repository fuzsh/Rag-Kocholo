Foundation’s biggest European event to date will feature talks by Ant Financial, AT&T, Dyson, Etsy.com, GO-JEK, NTT Corporation, NVIDIA, Offerup, Spotify, Zalando, and more

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – March 13, 2019 – T​he Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which sustains and integrates open source technologies like Kubernetes® and Prometheus™, today announced the session line-up for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe on May 20-23, 2019, in Barcelona. The event features real-world case studies using Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies from experts at ADMIRALTY, Booking.com, British Telecom, Carnegie Mellon, eBay, Engel & Völkers Technology, ING, LinkedIn, LSST & French National Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics (IN2P3), Mediakind, McKesson, VTT, and more.

After the largest ever KubeCon last December in Seattle with more than 8,000 attendees, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe will bring together more than 10,000 technologists from thriving open source communities across the world to further collaboration around cloud native computing. Maintainers and end users of CNCF’s hosted projects – including Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, CoreDNS, containerd, OpenTracing, Fluentd, gRPC, rkt, CNI, Jaeger, Notary, TUF, Vitess, NATS, Rook, Harbor, etcd, Linkerd, and Helm – and other cloud native technologies will gather for four days to share insights and encourage participation in this fast growing ecosystem. Register for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe by March 20 to save up to $300.

“It’s amazing that we’re on track to grow from the 8,000 in Seattle last December – representing the largest open source developer conference ever – to even more in Barcelona this May,” said Dan Kohn, Executive Director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Cloud native computing has crossed the chasm so that developers from hundreds of end user organizations are eager to collaborate with the rest of the community.”

A program committee of 110 experts led by conference co-chairs, VMware’s Bryan Liles and Google Cloud’s Janet Kuo, reviewed 1,535 submissions to help create the show’s diverse content slate. The agenda features an impressive mix of topics, including technical sessions, deep-dives, and case studies covering application & development (includes Helm & Telepresence), CI/CD, customizing & cxtending Kubernetes, fostering the community, machine learning & data, networking (includes NATS, CoreDNS, CNI, and gRPC), observability (includes Jaeger, OpenTracing, Fluentd, and Prometheus), operations, performance + scalability, runtimes (includes containerd and rkt), security, identity & policy (includes OPA, SPIFFE/SPIRE, Notary, and TUF), serverless (includes CloudEvents), storage (includes Vitess and Rook) and more.

“While reviewing the Barcelona submissions, we were amazed by the broad adoption of cloud-native technologies throughout the community, and across all verticals from research organizations to banks. We were also impressed by the new tools and technologies built in this fast-growing ecosystem,” said Janet Kuo, Software Engineer at Google, Co-Chair of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon. “We hope this year’s attendees walk away with new knowledge they hear first-hand from the experts and project maintainers, as well as the hands-on experience of using those technologies in the wild.”

“It’s a huge honor to represent such a fast-growing and diverse community that is fundamentally changing the way we build software and digital experiences,” said Bryan Liles, Senior Staff Engineer at VMware and Conference Co-chair. “This year’s schedule features some of the most innovative and informative sessions we’ve seen, and we look forward to the members coming together to share their knowledge.”
