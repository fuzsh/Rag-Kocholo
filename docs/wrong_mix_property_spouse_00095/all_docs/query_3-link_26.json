Insert BOARD OF SELECTMEN GREETINGS To all the citizens of Norwood: On behalf of the Town and the Board of Selectmen, I am privileged to present this 1998 Annual Report for your review. I would like to acknowledge and thank the Annual Report Review Committee who willingly gave of their time and effort gathering and compiling this information that it might be presented to the Town. The Board deeply appreciates and recognizes the hard work and commitment of all other Boards, Committees, Town Departments and staff, and Town Meeting members in accomplishing these goals throughout the year. By all working together, we keep and make Norwood the place we are proud to call home for ourselves, our children and our families. Respectfully submitted, Gary M. Lee, Chairman Board of Selectmen 2 BOARD OF SELECTMEN NORWOOD BOARD OF SELECTMEN Seated, left to right: Thomas A. Riolo; Timothy J. McDonough; Gary M. Lee, Chairman; Domenic J. Fruci; Susan Wilson McQuaid Standing, left to right: John J. Carroll, General Manager; Julia Liddy, Clerk; Frances Jessoe, Clerk; Bernard S.

McDonough 26 Dorset Street 1999 Domenic J. Fruci 285 Vernon Street 2000 Susan Wilson McQuaid 50 Churchill Drive 2001 ORGANIZATION Gary M. Lee, Chairman Julia A. Liddy, Clerk Frances L. Jessoe, Secretary The Meetings of the Board of Selectmen during the year 1 998 were held primarily in the Harry B. Butters Chambers, Room 34, Norwood Memorial Municipal Building, on Tuesday evenings, with some meetings being conducted in other locations from time to time as required. The Annual Municipal Election took place on Monday, the 6th of April, 1998. Susan W. McQuaid and Gary M. Lee were re¬ elected to serve. At the first meeting of the new Board, Gary M. Lee was elected Chairman. During forty three regular meetings and a number of special or emergency meetings in calendar year 1998, the Board of Selectmen conducted public hearings as mandated by statute or policy, as well as innumerable public meetings and conferences on specific problems and subjects of interest and concern to the community, and acted on all requests and subjects presented on each meeting’s agenda for consideration. In 1998, several projects consumed the Board’s and Town’s attention throughout the year including the renovations to the Town Hall and Tower; renovations and expansion of Morrill Memorial Library; the appropriation and ground breaking for the new Senior Citizen’s Center; the beginning of renovations and replacement of the Ellis Pond Dam; the reconstruction of the streets and sidewalks throughout South Norwood along with the planting of shade trees and the work with the South Norwood Committee on enhancements to the Hawes Pool tot lot and Eleanor Brylinski Park; the replacement of the Junior High South tennis courts and final site selection for a skateboard park for the Town’s youth. In addition, a great deal of the Board’s time in the later part of the year was spent working with the General Manager, Town Meeting and the Site Selection Committee on reviewing alternatives, costs and sites for possible relocation of the police/fire station in light of the recent flooding and damage to property, safety and personnel. The Selectmen, along with the Retirement Board, were also able to return a one-time $1.3 million surplus back to the Town. Over the years the Selectmen, Retirement Board and Town Meeting fully funded the system allowing the Town to finally reap this benefit after years of hard work and watchful scrutiny. The Board also, as in years past, was able to keep the tax rate down and attempt to achieve a more equitable balance between residential and business concerns alike. The Town also entered into serious negotiations with competing cable interests to provide the most modern and updated cable services and Internet access for our residents, the schools, Public Safety and municipal offices throughout Town. Meetings were conducted on a monthly basis with certain key department heads to review reports and activities in their respective departments and to discuss problems, policy and recommendations. Selectman Gary Lee continued to serve as the Town of Nonwood’s representative on the Norfolk County Advisory Board. Appointed to serve as Norwood’s representative to the MBTA Advisory Board was Olga Abdallah. Bernard S. Cooper and Anthony Mastandrea were appointed to serve as Nonwood’s Alternates. Superintendent of Public Works, Joseph Welch, and Alternate, Gary Schorer, continued to serve as Designees to the Neponset River Watershed Association. The regular meetings of the Board are televised live by Cablevision as a part of their contract with the Town. The Cable Commission meets on a regular basis with David A. Green, Assistant General Manager, to air subscriber complaints or problems with telecasting. Budget meetings were held on February 10, 1998, and the approach to various items was very cautious. Town Accountant Robert M. Thornton provided an overview before the budget was discussed. The state of the economy was foremost in everyone’s mind and concern for town finances cast a long shadow. Because of budget constraints, a considerable amount of time was spent on the budget. Recipients selected by the Board for this year’s Andrew B. Boch Betterment Fund grants are Four Nonwood/Town Hall signs - $7,800; Optelec Reader for the Morrill Memorial Library - $2,500; Prescott School P.T.O. - community playground at Prescott School - $5,000; Hawes Brook Park Tot Lot - $3,000; Back Stage Boosters for Nonwood Junior High Sound System - $2,000; Meals on Wheels - $1,000; Norwood Historical Society - Day House - $1,000; Caring for Nonwood Foundation - $1,000; Norwood DARE Basketball Program - physically challenged youngsters - $1 ,000; Pop Warner - $500; Nonwood Parents Music Assoc. - $130.

The Board selected 1 8 names with the understanding the first ten would receive jobs if funding is appropriated by Town Meeting. On Friday, May 29, 1 998, the Recreation Department sponsored their eleventh annual all-night party for the Senior Class of Nonwood High School. On June 29, 1998 the Cable TV Advisory Committee held a public hearing to hear comments and receive input from the public as one of the procedures outlined for the renewal of the cable license with Cablevision. The Fourth of July parade was bigger and better than ever. The parade with Grand Marshall George Thomas honored Norwood’s veterans. Each participant received a copy of the official Proclamation issued by the Board declaring July as “Honoring Norwood’s Veterans Month”. Events held were a 5K road race and a doll carriage and bicycle parade. There was a record number of participants in the road race. Residents and former residents turned out to cheer on the various groups and to make it a festive occasion. Selectman Tom Riolo and his wife Janice served as commentators again this year, and it was cablecast live. The Board would like to recognize the following individuals who gave of their time and talent in making this year’s Parade the best: Jim Morris, Gary McNeil, Paul Wasil and Bernie Cooper. The Board also thanks the many volunteers that made it all possible. On Wed., Nov. 11,1 998 at 1 2 noon the rededication of the Town Hall was held with Chairman Lee as master of ceremonies. The original dedication took place exactly 70 years ago. After six months of renovations, the work has been completed. Special Recognition awards were presented to Ernest Paciorkowski and John Egan for their unselfish dedication and devotion serving on the Permanent Building Construction Committee. On November 20, 1998, special recognition was given to our Town Manager John J. Carroll for his over 20 years of outstanding service to the community. The Board presented a chair with the Town seal thanking John on behalf of all our residents. The Annual Holiday Stroll and Tree Lighting Ceremony was held on Sunday, November 29th. The weather was delightful and complimentary refreshments were served at participating stores. Santa’s Procession led by the Norwood High School Marching Band proceeded along Washington St. to the tree lighting ceremony at the Common. Mr. & Mrs. Claus were warmly applauded by children of all ages. A number of Norwood residents, including the Girls Scouts, Cub Scouts, and the Norwood Scholarship Foundation, were able to enjoy the beauty of the Walter J. Dempsey Memorial Bandstand. Joyful brides and grooms used the Bandstand as a background for their wedding vows and photographs. Young and old alike were brought together at the Bandstand on Sunday evenings to listen to the music of our Summer Concert Series. Special recognition by the Selectmen was given to Police Chief Bartley King, Fire Chief William F. Sullivan and Supt. Joseph M. Welch, PWD, for their perseverance in meeting the challenge resulting from the massive flooding which occurred during the torrential rainstorm on June 13th. Chris Woodward, Stephen Hebner, and Randall Booth were recognized because they went out of their way to save a gentleman who was trapped in his car under the bridge on Nahatan Street during the rainstorm in June. They are heroes in every sense of the word. Lt. Philip A. Dziuba, and Firefighters Thomas J. Gover, Daniel J. Harkins, Leslie W. LeBlanc, Jr., Gerald F. Mahoney and Dara O’Malley were commended for their professionalism following a six car accident on Route IA. Arson Investigator William R.Turner Jr. and Police Officer Michael Benedetti were commended for their hard work that went into the investigation of a fire at Windsor Gardens. Dispatcher Susan Morse was recognized for her professionalism and dedication which led to the saving of a man’s life on the E91 1 line. The Board was very proud to recognize the efforts and athletic achievements o the young people in Town for their training, dedication and talent. A letter of commendation was sent to Philip J. McManus, General Foreman, and the employees of the Cemetery Division for the consistently fine job they do maintaining the grounds. Their hard work and efforts made the holidays, especially Memorial Day, even more meaningful. 50th anniversary wedding congratulations were extended to Ernest and Helen Paciorkowski; Roger and Josephine Eysie and Gerald and Anne Memmo.

LEE, Chairman THOMAS A. RIOLO timothy j. McDonough DOMENIC J. FRUCI SUSAN WILSON McQUAID Town Hall Renovations 7 GENERAL MANAGER REPORT OF THE GENERAL MANAGER For me, 1998 was a busy and exciting as my previous twenty years as Norwood’s General Manager. As a matter of fact, on November 20, 1 998, I celebrated the beginning of my 21st year. Several large construction projects occupied my time and the time of my staff last year. Three come to mind: the reconstruction of Ellis Pond Dam and the reconstruction and renovation of Washington Street in South Norwood and the renovation and repair of Town Hall. The dam eventually cost $1,000,000, $350,000 of which was paid for by the Town and the remainder by the State’s Department of Environmental Management. At this writing, in the early spring of 1999, the project is almost done and, because ourTown Department of Public Works’ crews cleared away overgrown brush and dead trees between the new structure and Walpole Street, it is an impressive sight. For some folks, it’s an amazing sight because they never knew the dam and lovely Ellis Pond behind it ever existed. The South Norwood project resulted from a year of planning, and the results continue to receive positive comments from those who saw the finished product last summer. The brick trim, new benches and many new trees and fresh pavement have given new life to South Norwood. The project, which was built using almost all State Chapter 90 funds, cost about $450,000. It’s safe to say that Norwood’s most famous and visible building is its Town Hall. So, it was as a great surprise to thousands of passers-by last spring when the great gothic structure seemed suddenly to be enveloped in a large green plastic shroud. Of course, that event had been preceded by the award of a construction contract of $550,000 and then the erection of a huge lattice-work of staging on which workers crawled like ants to repair the leaky masonry in the 70-year-old building. Finally the shroud came down. So did the staging and the Town Hall seemed to be more handsome than ever. To celebrate the occasion, on November 11, 1998 the building was re-dedicated in an event in Memorial Hall that was attended by hundreds of citizens and Town officials. Co-incidentally, the original dedication of the building happened on November 1 1 , 1928 exactly 70 years previously. The flood of June 1 3th and 1 4th of 1 998 was a major event for the whole Town of Norwood but, particularly for the employees of the Police and Fire Departments. Catastrophic flooding occurred in the basement of the facility - flooding that caused waters to reach the five foot level and which eventually caused damages of $600,000. Luckily, we were insured for the bulk of that cost. However, that one event forced a renewed look at siting the much needed expansion of the Police Station and renovation of the Fire Station. Much of calendar 1 998 was occupied in meetings with a special Committee to look into finding a new site. Unfortunately, at year’s end that effort had not yet paid off. A less publicized project in 1 998 was to begin automated reading of ourTown water meters. Working with an MWRA grant/loan of $200,000 we have now installed devices on the water meters at 600 residences and commercial establishments which will allow the meters to be read twice daily with readings automatically transmitted to a host computer in the Billing Department on Central Street. The new system will allow those accounts to be billed monthly with actual readings each time instead of the awkward present arrangement by which meters are read a maximum of three times a year and billed bi-monthly using estimates for periods in between actual readings. My hope is that once a one-year test period is over, we can begin to extend the system to all our accounts. Planning for the capping of our landfill was completed in 1998 and the expectation is that the actual work will be done by September 1999 at a cost of less than $2,000,000. We also spent a lot of time planning for the Y2K problem and will continue to do so in 1999. During the year we also worked closely on a couple of major private developments which we eagerly await, i.e., the 300,000 square foot Martignetti office/warehouse on University Ave. and the Putnam office development in land they acquired from Polaroid. Of course, this office worked hard on all beautification and cultural projects, too. The beautiful annuals and perennial flowers, Holiday decorations, and events like the Concerts on the Common are all intended to show off the Town and to give pleasure to its citizens and those who visit us. This annual report would not be complete without thanks to my excellent staff here at Town Hall, the various professional Department Heads with whom I work constantly, Town employees, Town Meeting members and, of course, to the Board of Selectmen, without whose help none of the accomplishments listed here, and the many which space prohibits me from listing, could have taken place. I look forward to 1999 and to future years in the service of the Town of Norwood. 8 AIRPORT COMMISSION REPORT OFTHE SEALER OF WEIGHTS & MEASURES Presenting my 50th annual report for the Department of Weights & Measures for year ending December 31, 1998. WEIGHTS & MEASURES DEVICES Gasoline Meters & Computers 219 Vehicular Meters & Computers 1 7 Commercial Scales 196 School Scales 13 Scanners, Computers & Cash Registers 85 Adjustments & Calibrations 1 36 Taxi Meters 50 Devices Not Sealed 7 Devices Condemned 1 Metric Weights 83 Apothecary Weights 125 Avoirdupois Weights 62 TOTAL 752 Inspections Peddlers Licenses 4 Fuel Certificates 21 Food Over 89 Food Under 65 Fees Collected & Paid Treasurer $5,566.80 This has been as awesome responsibility in trying to professionally enforce some eleven Chapters of Mass. Gen. Laws (each having many sections) relating to purchases of the necessities of life by our people and the providers thereof. This past year as previously reported by national media and this department, our state legislators approved a bill which was adopted as Chapter. 295 Mass. Gen. Laws “CONSUMER AND MECHANT PROTECTION ACT” amending some 45 Sections of preexisting laws. This law completely revolutionizes Weights & Measures Departments, some of which requires more new training, recertifying all appointments. Otherwise, the state is authorized, after notification of local findings not being adequately in compliance, they could go in and execute properly at the expense of that city or town. Massachusetts is the first state in our entire country to initiate or attempt to update the old colonial laws of some past 90 years, so as to corroborate the accuracy and errors of present day high-tech computerized scanners etc. This means a search to find and test four or more scanners wherever being used commercially retailing such items as: clothing, shoes, video & cassettes, liquor & wines, hardwares, auto-parts, craft & arts etc. As our town’s first certified Sealer these many years, I’m very thankful for my many blessings and your helpful advice, the assistance of your staff, the Board of Selectmen and all other involved officials. Respectfully, Frederick F. Brown, Sealer REPORT OFTHE AIRPORT COMMISSION The Nonwood Airport Commission is comprised of five members appointed by the Board of Selectmen and is charged with the care, custody and management of the airport. Present members are Joseph Barca, Lawrence Egan, Thomas Judge, Edwin Page and Paul Pazniokas. Paul Pazniokas served as Chairman and Thomas Judge served as Financial Program Administrator. The commission retains an airport management company, Boston Metropolitan Airport, Inc., to handle the day to day management of the airport. The airport manager is Francis “Russ” Maguire, whose office is at 101 Access Road (near the Prop Stop Restaurant), and he may be reached at 781-769-5860. Edwards & Kelcey, Inc. was selected as our new airport engineering consultant in April. Projects completed in 1998 included extensive tree and vegetation clearing, reconstruction of the south ramp and gate one emergency access taxilane, and crack sealing on the west ramp. The Norfolk County Mosquito Control Project aided the airport tremendously by cleaning our storm water drains. The Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission helped produce an information booklet called “Guide to Norwood Memorial Airport” that helps explain the benefits of general aviation airports like Norwood. Ongoing projects included the preliminary design of a safety area and wildlife fence. Respectfully submitted, Paul M. Pazniokas, Chairman 9 CABLE COMMISSION REPORT OF THE NORWOOD CABLE COMMISSION The Norwood Cable Commission is comprised of five members who are appointed by the Norwood Board of Selectmen. Currently, these members are: Thomas J. Cummings, Sr., Chairman; Joan Jacobs, Vice-chairman; Gordon Smith, Richard Kief, and Albert Fisk. The secretary is Christina Petracca. The Cable Commission meets on the third Monday of each month at 7:00 p.m. in Room 1 1 at the Town Hall. The Public is always invited to attend. In 1998, Cablevision and the Town of Norwood agreed to a three year extension of their existing 15-year license. This license now expires in 2001. Also in 1998, Cablevision slightly increased its rates to subscribers. RCN Corporation requested a cable license in Norwood in 1 997. A public hearing was held, and a proposal was received from RCN. Negotiations were on going between RCN and Norwood Cable Advisory Committee (this committee is also appointed by the Board of Selectmen). A provisional license will be signed between RCN and the Board of Selectmen in early 1999. Cablevision has informed the Norwood Board of Selectmen and Norwood Subscribers that they will rebuild their cable system, beginning in late January 1999. Cablevision will begin installing the Optimum Fiber Optic Network which will improve subscribers viewing of Cable television, in the areas of programming, picture quality, audio quality, and will add the feature of high speed Internet capabilities. The Norwood Cable Commission looks forward to 1999. The Commission is confident that major positive changes will take place, such as: • More involvement of the RCN Corporation • Building of the new cable system by Cablevision Respectfully Submitted, Thomas J.
