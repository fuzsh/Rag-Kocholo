        "text": "Sixteen-year-old Ben Kinsella, an aspiring actor who appeared in The Bill, had been in an argument with a gang of black youths.[>\n\n[>\n\nWitnesses heard Ben scream “I’ve been stabbed” before he collapsed unconscious in Holloway, north London.[>\n\n[>\n\nHis murder brings the number of teenagers who have been stabbed to death in the capital this year to 17.[>\n\n[>\n\nBen’s anguished sister was among family, friends and celebrities who visited the scene to lay flowers and tributes yesterday.[>\n\n[>\n\nBrooke, 24, who played wild child Kelly Taylor in the BBC1 serial, was accompanied by boyfriend Ray Panthaki, another former EastEnder.[>\n\n[>\n\nShe was due to star in a new production, Torn, opening today at the Arcola Theatre in Hackney, east London, but has now pulled out.[>\n\n[>\n\nHer publicist said Brooke was “devastatated” and “the family are together supporting each other”.[>\n\n[>\n\nBirds Of A Feather actress Linda Robson was also among mourners who left floral tributes at the scene in York Way yesterday.[>\n\n[>\n\nScotland Yard said the tragedy unfolded at 2am as Ben and a white friend left the party at Shillibeers pub.[>\n\n[>\n\nThe pair are believed to have got into a row with the gang of black youths.[>\n\n[>\n\nBen’s friend George O’Reilly, 19, said: “I saw him being chased down the street.[>\n\n[>\n\n“Ben was a really nice guy. I think he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”[>\n\n[>\n\nAnother pal said: “There was a fight in Shillibeers. I don’t think Ben was involved at first but then it got out of hand and was in the streets.[>\n\n[>\n\n“I think Ben tried to run away but was chased. I heard someone shout ‘Get him, get him’. Then he was stabbed in the back and chest. There was blood everywhere.”[>\n\n[>\n\nAnother friend David Dugdale, 17, said: “He called me on the phone and just said ‘Help’. He sounded really scared. Then it clicked off.”[>\n\n[>\n\nAn 18-year-old youth who saw the incident from his balcony said: “I heard someone shout, ‘I’ve been stabbed’. The area is really rough.” Ben was taken to the nearby Whitting-ton hospital, where he died.[>\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\n[>\n\nAbout 50 people who gathered near the scene yesterday included Joe Swash who played the part of Mickey Miller in EastEnders.[>\n\n[>\n\nBen’s parents George and Debbie were too upset to talk.[>\n\n[>\n\nA friend of Ben said he was “brilliant” at drama and had small screen parts but wanted to follow his sister into East-Enders. The pal added: “They are a really close family.”[>\n\n[>\n\nBob Hamlyn, Ben’s headteacher at Holloway School, said: “He was a bright kid, high achieving, and would have had very good results to look forward to this summer. He was also very sporty.”[>\n\n[>\n\nTributes on Ben’s page on the social networking site MySpace included one from a girl called Charlie reading: “RIP Benny-Boo. Never to be forgotten.” The page included a video clip of Ben.[>\n\n[>\n\nOn it, Ben described himself as: “Down to earth, easy going, get on with just about everyone. I’m a nice guy, not flash/backstabber.” He was a keen footballer and Arsenal fan. He had just taken his GCSEs and was expected to get A-grades.[>\n\n[>\n\nHis sister left EastEnders three years ago after a two-year spell playing Kelly Taylor, best friend of Zoe Slater, played by Michelle Ryan. She began her acting career in the 1997 film No Child Of Mine, in which she played an abused child. She has been seeing Ray Panthaki, who played Ronny Ferreira, for three years.[>\n\n[>\n\nScotland Yard said two 16-year-old youths were being questioned. Officers were still looking for a murder weapon.[>"
