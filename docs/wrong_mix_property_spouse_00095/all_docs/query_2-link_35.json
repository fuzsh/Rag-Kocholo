        "text": "By: Hadley Starkey\n\nWHAT’S THE “ONE” THING I CAN DO FOR MLM SUCCESS?\n\nThousands of people are looking for their own MLM Success these days. Every since I rose to the top of a prominent network marketing company it’s always amazed me how many people come up to me and ask, “What’s the ONE THING” I could do to get myself to the next level in my home-based business? What is it you do for your MLM Success that continually sets you apart from everyone else that I could do to get me where you are?\n\nAnd the Answer IS – The Answer Comes From Within! People who have success have desire!\n\nIt’s NOT the How To’s that leads you to MLM Success. It’s the WAY you DO THINGS! It’s YOUR Philosophy, And YOUR Attitude that ultimately affects your own MLM Success! Who YOU ARE is the philosophy you communicate.\n\nFriends, I have to be honest, there’s NO MAGIC DUST! You already have all that you need to reap the rewards of MLM success in your home-based business! It’s truly within you! You just have to do more of it! And maybe you have to do MORE than the average person does to have your own success in MLM. Trust me, You already have it! You have to get better at the mundane things. And it all comes down to the “YOU” factor, that’s the bottom line. To get there, you have to get better at YOU! And you can get that through personal development. Do the thing and you will have the power.\n\nEveryone has to pay a price for MLM Success! Even worse is the price of neglect! You haven’t taken enough No’s to get you there quite yet. You have to go through thousands of nos. So that only means that you are that much closer to your yeses! Trust me, that’s IT!\n\nHappy are people that dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true! – Leon J. Sulnes\n\nWhat is your Philosophy?\n\nALL of the successful people I know in Network Marketing have the SAME success stories! And one of the most significant common denominators they all have is doing the simple little things time and time again. The simple daily disciplines. Their desire and faith is what pushes them. That also gives you geometric growth. Start where you are now and just go!\n\nYour philosophy is what you believe in. Your core value system. What are you doing to affect your philosophy? Your philosophy develops as you gain experience in Network Marketing and increase your knowledge. You develop further understanding in dealing with people. People affect your philosophy. Experiences change your philosophy.\n\nBoth your attitude and your outlook on life are strongly influenced by your philosophy. If an individual is not reaching the levels of MLM success they’re most desiring it’s because is they haven’t taken an inventory on themselves. So often when I’m working with an individual, I find that the missing piece to their success is a lack of personal development.\n\nFOR NETWORK MARKETING AND MLM SUCCESS, PEOPLE MUST LIKE YOU\n\nIn order to receive, you must first give. Over the years, I have helped scores of MLM Teams and networkers become successful by getting them to work on themselves rather than focus on a product! Focusing on YOU is what attracts people to you! You want to become the magnet that people fall in love with in order to have MLM Success. That’s what “ATTRACTION” Marketing is all about! That’s what sponsoring people “magnetically” is all about! That’s Recruiting! It’s all about YOU! That’s what it takes to recruit!\n\nBelieve it or not, people come in to Network Marketing with a negative attitude. How is that, you ask? Granted, they may have just signed up and they’re very excited about their opportunity but their psyche is negative in nature because the average child sees 200,000 negative acts of violence before they turn 18. Our society, our culture, and our education system here in the US does not teach us to become successful. It’s geared towards employees and is also tragically built on negative attitudes . So everyone needs to have their software (Their Brains) reprogrammed.\n\nDo you want to go from the shack to the mansion? Would you like to Drive a New Car, Live in a new Home, or perhaps travel the world?\n\nThen let me help you rebuild your dreams my friend. There are no age limits to being a dreamer! Having success in your home-based business is a process! Success and failure are all on the same road; however, the road to success takes a little longer to get too.\n\nLets start together because with a little shift in your thinking, I can dramatically change your life and get you on track and lead you to your greatest breakthrough! First let me say, I don’t think you’re lacking in motivation because you’re here! You’re reading this, so you’re definitely taking an interest in yourself! But I think what you could probably use is some “Direction.” Is that right? Well that’s Awesome. I’m proud of you. I can radically change your life if you will start reading just 10-15 pages of a good book every day! Do it first thing, right after you wake up and you’re sitting down with your first cup of coffee, that’s one of the best times, when your mind is fresh. Also it helps you start every day in a positive frame of mind! Plus, as an added bonus it gets your mind thinking at peak performance.\n\nSo lets start with this okay. I want you to go get 3 great books for network marketing today! If you don’t invest in yourself, no one else will! First one is “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert Kiyosaki. Second, “Slight Edge” by Jeff Olson. And third, Napoleon Hill’s Book, “Think & Grow Rich” And by the way, when you get Think & Grow Rich, take a hard look at the 13 Subtitles. The 1st one is Having a Burning Desire but all 13 are philosophical. Now I have a list of some 65-75 super network marketing books I can suggest. But I strongly recommend reading these three first in the order that I’ve given them to you. These first three will lay the FOUNDATION of your philosophy to start getting you on the right track to becoming a successful, purpose driven, lean, mean, entrepreneurial machine! The books you read and the CD’s you listen to form your philosophy. In my 20 plus years of mlm marketing these have been the best first steps to success.\n\nHere’s the concept. It’s one of the strongest MLM success strategies I can recommend for your home-based business is get started reading at least 10 pages of a good book every day for the next year. If you will follow in the footsteps of those who have taken my advice and have found success at a very high level, at the end of the year I will have had you reading 3,650 pages of books. Now if the average book has 300 pages in it, then that means I will have had you reading 15 books over the next year. Now let me ask you, “If I have you reading 15 Books and it’s 15 Books I ask you to read, do you think I can change your life? ABSOLUTELY! Reading personal development books help you transform, or in this case “develop” your philosophy! Reading how others before you have failed helps you shorten your learning curve and avoid the mine fields and the booby traps.\n\nBy developing your philosophy you also develop your vision. Read Proverbs Chapter 29 about No Vision for confirmation. If you develop sound vision then you’ll never feel like you’re ever working a day in your life because you will be doing what you love! Having the right shared vision will attract and unite people around you. Keep your vision in front of you! You deserve an abundant life, it’s what God intended for you!\n\n“Action” is the real measure of intelligence! – Napoleon Hill\n\nSo let’s get on it NOW! Just click on the link I provided herein to go to Amazon.com and buy these books. Start today! Don’t put it off, your future depends on it!\n\nWHAT SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE FOR NETWORK MARKETING ARE DOING THAT YOU ARE NOT\n\nLets face it, We ALL have obstacles, we ALL have issues. And truth be known, life is meaningless unless we have struggles. Opportunities come from our adversities. So embrace your struggles. Embrace the negativity! The price for success in a home based business is pain. And it’s our attitudes and how we handle those obstacles, challenges, adversities, and struggles that will ultimately separate you from the person next to you. Successful people are always working on themselves, sharpening their ax. Successful people in networkmarketing KNOW that in order to help someone else solve their problems they have to be better, calmer, and be better equipped to help someone. Their attitudes, actions, and their demeanor have to be superlative. Being more prepared, more personally developed hones you in to becoming a leader yourself, becoming a leader, becoming a true fledged business owner. Doing so is self-rewarding in that you will now feel like you’re participating in your own rescue! A financially free Entrepreneur. After all this is what you want isn’t it? Great, then NEVER question the process.\n\nFor successful people in network marketing, the one thing they all seem to have in common is their attitudes. Their attitudes are the one common denominator that allows them to shine through. A good attitude breeds success in network marketing! Most people WAIT to do something UNTIL it becomes self-evident. Waiting to do something before it becomes self-evident is often too late. Why is this? It’s mostly fear. Fear of dealing with ridicule.\n\nIs having a “Burning Desire” an attitude? You bet it is. A burning desire is what fuels the confident, Type A individual, the ones that already found success in network marketing. Having a burning desire means having a “Do Whatever It Takes, for as Long as it takes” kind of attitude. Desire and belief have to have congruence. The “inner you” will have a tendency to hold you back. As an entrepreneur in a home-based business, you’re now a self-employed business owner. There’s no looking at the clock anymore like you did when you were an employee, before you fired your boss. You simply do whatever it takes to reach your end goals if you want to have MLM Success.\n\nIn closing, if you don’t know where you’re going, you’re just going to be all over the place. If you’re comfortable with yourself, you’re not progressing or moving forward. Get better today than you were yesterday. Get focused! By focusing I mean following a plotted course until its successfully completed!\n\nSuccessful people do what unsuccessful people are NOT willing to do. Successful people live OUTSIDE their comfort zone. You have to get out of yours if you expect to have something different.\n\nYou have to take action in order to find and enjoy MLM Success, it’s NOT going to find you! To say it another way, your ship is NEVER going to come in, YOU have to swim out and get it! You have to compete every day!\n\nEvery day, we ALL Show up at the starting line in mlm marketing with the same tools and the same opportunities. In network marketing, some of its magic and some of its tragic so NEVER let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game! Get excited about the game of life! This is your chance for real MLM Success! Go out there and seize the day!\n\nIt is impossible to stop and man or a woman who WILL NOT QUIT!\n\nHere’s the equation I just shared with you today:\n\nPhilosophy + Attitude + Action + Results = Lifestyle!\n\nLearn and Earn and Pass It On!\n\nGood Luck to you!\n\nPlease share your comments and like this post if you found it useful to you!

It allows some people to find incredible opportunities, while others just watch from the sidelines.\n\nEffective networking isn’t a result of luck — it requires hard work and persistence. What does it take to be a super networker? Here are seven of the most important habits to develop:\n\n1. Ask insightful questions.\n\nBefore attending networking events, get the names of the people who are expected to attend and search social media sites like LinkedIn to figure out which topics they’re probably most interested in. For people who are already in your network, don’t assume you know everything they’re up to. Find out what they’re currently working on — or perhaps struggling with. This attention to detail can go a long way at your next one-on-one lunch or dinner meeting.\n\n2. Add value.\n\nOne of the most powerful networking practices is to provide immediate value to a new connection. This means the moment you identify a way to help someone, take action. If, for instance, you know someone in your network who can help a new connection with a problem, drop what you’re doing and introduce the two individuals.\n\n3. Learn their ‘story.’\n\nAsk successful entrepreneurs to tell you how they got where they are. Most people think of this as an exercise in rapport building, but hearing these stories can tell you a lot about a person’s approach to business. The more you understand your networking partner’s mentality, the better you can add and extract value from your relationship.\n\nFor example, some entrepreneurs pride themselves on working 16-hour days and doing whatever it takes, while others focus on being strategic and waiting for the right opportunities to open up. These are clues that can not only allow you to see what people value, but also what working with them might be like.\n\n4. Share a memorable fact.\n\nWhen someone asks, “What do you do?” don’t give a canned elevator speech about your company and career. Mention something personal that defines who you really are. Maybe you have a passion for playing an instrument or an obsession with collecting antiques. These are also “things you do,” so make it a point to share them. Such personal details can help lighten the mood and get people talking.\n\n5. Keep a list.\n\nWhat’s your routine after attending a networking event or meal? If your answer is, “I go home,” you’re probably going to miss out on opportunities. Write down important topics that came up at the event. This habit can help prevent opportunities from falling through the cracks and give you something to reference in conversation the next time you meet. You can also develop a reputation as someone who’s on top of things.\n\n6. Make small promises and keep them.\n\nNo matter how small a promise you make — such as sending an email or returning a phone call — delivering on that promise reflects on your character. By following through on your word, you start building a reputation for trustworthiness, which is exactly how every great networker wants to be perceived.\n\n7. Reward your ‘power’ contacts.\n\nKeep a list of your top five to 10 networking partners and do something each week to add value to one person’s life or business. You might send them a book or set up a lunch to introduce them to one of your other contacts. This habit can help you be proactive about staying in touch with your most powerful contacts. Just as with fitness or investing, the most successful people are the ones who choose to be consistent in their actions.\n\nsource: Entrepreneur, 2012\n\nGo Ahead, I Dare You\n\nHow many times in our lives have we heard that? It amazes me how many times people are challenged with those words and then fail to take action on the actual dare. What is that? Mostly it’s fear. People are terrified of failure, rejection, and the repercussions of falling short. And for fear of failure, they never take the first step. And then at the end of the day they are bewildered of their lack of success in their lives, their personal development, and their lifelong accomplishments. In order for things to be different YOU have to be different.\n\nLet me help you shape your thinking a little better. If I told you right now that you were never ever going to find success, would you get upset with me? What different course of action would you start to take? Chances are you’re here reading this today because you’ve reached a point of desperation. you’re finally mad enough about your current situation, you’re finally angry enough you’re looking for quick answers and you’re looking for answers to get yourself out of a lifelong rut. Tired of the rat race. Well how bad do you want to achieve success? Would you become more passionate about wanting to prove me wrong? You have dreams don’t you? Have people close to you told you that you can’t do that? Ask yourself, what have they done with their lives? Have your dreams been suppressed over time by the mental meltdown of corporate America? Winston Churchill’s father told him as a teenager that he was a “social wastrel.” But Sir Winston Churchill went on to become one of the World’s most influential leaders. He stuttered as a kid.\n\nAre you waiting for your ship to come in? That’s like playing the lottery thinking you’re going to win. Chances are you’re not! Let me just tell you, you’re ship is NEVER going to come in! The fact is, you’re going to have to swim out and get it! For you to attain the level of success you desire, it’s never going to come easy. Like everything else, you have to pay your dues. And with that comes lots of trial and error. Failure after failure. That’s what we call “Sweat Equity!” You have to grind, grind, grind and you have to fail, fail, fail. that’s how you WIN! When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he was asked why he was able to persevere since he had failed in previous 2000 attempts. He said, “I never failed at it, I just found 2000 ways it didn’t work!” Different mindset. So let me ask you, how many times have you attempted something and gave up telling yourself, “Ahh, it doesn’t work? Five times, 10 times, 50 times before you finally gave up or someone told you that you were crazy?” And that’s all it is for you to achieve greatness, a different mindset a different perspective. A different path than what you’re on right now. And guess what? You can do it! In order for things to change, YOU have to change. What inspires you? In order for you to become successful, you have to be willing to come out of your comfort zone. Quit worrying about what people think about you. Chances are the voices you think you might hear come from those who haven’t taken action on their own dreams but have succeeded on stealing yours and many others countless times. Successful people have failed, failed, failed, their way to success.\n\nWHAT ACTIONS STEPS SHOULD I TAKE?\n\nGreat question! A significant reason you’re not where you want to be right now is because you’ve never had a game plan. You’ve never had goals. And that’s not entirely your fault either. I’m just speaking the truth here. I know it hurts but in order for you to get where you want to go, you have to recognize too where you’re coming from so you can see your progress and chart your successes along the way. That way as you get to the next level and the next and so on you’re seeing growth and are more likely to see things through to your goals.\n\nSo lets take a few minutes now and define some realistic goals. And since you’ve never done this before, lets start with something easy. A 90-day goal. What’s the purpose of this goal? And what’s the penalty for not reaching this goal. See there has to be a penalty as well as a reward. Growth. We’re taking baby steps here now so we can see progress, so you can get used to defining your road map to success. The easiest way to set an end goal is to discover your “Why.” If the why is insignificant the goal will also be insignificant as well. Most people are struggling financially, Agreed? Ok, So let’s see if we can get you on a path that will start to earn you an extra $500-$1000 per month part time. Would that be nice? Great! That’s simple, that’s easy to do. Oh well you might be saying, “I’ve never done that, how am I going to do it now?”\n\nGeorge Washington was once asked about his plan for chopping down the cherry tree. He said he was going to go sharpen his ax for 3 hours then take 15 minutes to chop down the tree. So my suggestion to you is we need to start sharpening your ax right now!\n\nI’m also going to go out on a limb here first and tell you something I already know about you. You’re not much of a reader are you? Thought so. Most people I find in their struggles is that they’re not readers at all. If they are they’re not reading the right things. See if you’ve never chopped down a cherry tree, you’d need to learn how to do it. And what better way to sharpen your ax and learn how then by reading about how someone else did it the wrong way and then read how someone else did it the right way and then do it the way that was most successful. So you see my friend, by reading, you shorten your own learning curve and find out the right way verses the wrong way to do something.\n\nSUCCESS LEAVES CLUES\n\nHere’s one for you. 99.99% of people who are successful in whatever their profession are for the most part veracious readers.
