The award was presented at a reception in the home of Ann and Gordon Getty.\n\nThe US Dept. of Veterans Affairs awards a contract to Hamilton Families to provide housing assistance and supportive services to veteran families.\n\nGoogle.org donates $1 million to Hamilton Families in support of our innovative partnership with the San Francisco Unified School District to reduce homelessness in our schools.

A steadfast commitment to ending family homelessness remains the driving force of the organization.\n\nThe Heading Home Campaign is officially launched—a $30 million public-private partnership with the City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Unified School District, Hamilton Families, and private philanthropy—to scale Hamilton Families’ existing services to help 800 families experiencing homelessness as part of an effort to end long-term family homelessness in San Francisco.\n\n2017\n\nThe Hamilton Families SOMA office opens in August 2017 to accommodate the scaling of the organization’s staff to meet the needs of the 800 families it will serve through the Heading Home Initiative.\n\n2018\n\nAs Hamilton Families moved deeper into the Heading Home work, the organization learned that a majority of families were choosing to move outside of San Francisco County due to a lack of affordable housing.\n\nTo accommodate this, Hamilton Families pivoted its work toward a more regional approach. Hamilton Families contracted with the Urban Institute to analyze the organization’s efforts in real-time, gauging the efficacy of the challenges in this regional effort. Simultaneously, Hamilton Families invested in data, research, strategic partnerships, and development to keep pace with the scale of the needs in our community.\n\n2019\n\nHamilton Families took what it learned from the Heading Home Campaign and integrated it as the organization’s standard business model, combining all programs and services under the banner of the Housing Services department.\n\n2023\n\nHamilton Families officially moves into their new home at 2567 Mission Street in the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District. Their new office is now home to their Housing Services, Finance, People and Culture, Development, and Administrative departments. The building features trauma-informed design and was constructed to enhance operational efficiency and provide a safe, collaborative, and supportive space for staff and family participants alike. Hamilton Families’ Shelter and Transitional Housing continue to operate in San Francisco’s Tenderloin and North of the Panhandle neighborhoods respectively."
