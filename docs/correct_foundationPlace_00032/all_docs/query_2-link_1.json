        "text": "Here's the Salesforce History over the years, including newsworthy highlights and a timeline of milestones since 1999.\n\nEditor’s Note: This page was last updated in June 2024. For media inquiries about the history of Salesforce, please contact PR@salesforce.com.\n\n25 Years of Salesforce News Highlights\n\nThe below timeline captures the history of Salesforce, including some key milestones along the way, illustrating our record of doing well while doing good.\n\nSalesforce is the global leader in CRM, helping companies connect with customers in a whole new way. Founded in 1999, Salesforce enables companies of every size and industry to digitally transform around their customers by harnessing the power of automation, artificial intelligence, and real-time data to make every customer experience more personal, valuable and memorable. With a global community driven by shared core values, Salesforce is more than a business – it’s a platform for change.\n\n1999\n\nIn February, the Salesforce journey begins with a clear vision to be “A World-Class Internet Company for Sales Force Automation.”\n\nOn March 8, Salesforce incorporates and Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Frank Dominguez, and Dave Moellenhoff begin working on the first version of Salesforce’s CRM. Their base is a rented one-bedroom apartment at 1449 Montgomery Street, on San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill.\n\nAs the four develop their prototype, they also build a distinctive startup culture. They only work on what they believe is important and necessary, to do it “fast, simple, and right the first time.” “No fluff” is their mantra. They wear Hawaiian print shirts, brunch at Mama’s, appoint Marc’s dog Koa as Chief Love Officer, and constantly ask for feedback.\n\nThe company also writes its first V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures) strategic plan, aiming to provide employees with a clear vision and align the organization around common goals. In true startup fashion, the original draft is written on the back of an envelope. V2MOM remains at the core of how Salesforce runs its business, and continues to guide every decision the company makes.\n\nBy the end of its first year, the company has expanded to 40 employees and an 8,000-square-foot office at the Rincon Center.\n\n2000\n\nLike many other tech companies, Salesforce endured challenges brought on by the dot-com bubble bursting, and 20% of the company’s workforce was laid off.\n\nOn February 7, salesforce.com officially launches at an event themed around “The End of Software” at San Francisco’s Regency Theater with 1,500 attendees and a concert with The B-52s.\n\nIn March, Salesforce gets a boost from its first piece of major press coverage, in The Wall Street Journal, when it hires actors to stage a mock protest outside a Siebel Systems conference. The “protestors” carry signs with anti-software messages to drive home Salesforce’s “The End of Software” marketing tagline.\n\nSalesforce.org launches the 1-1-1 model, leveraging its technology, people, and resources to improve communities around the world.\n\nIn November, the growing business moves from the Rincon Center to a larger base at One Market Street.\n\nRevenue hits $5.4 million for fiscal year ending January 31, 2001.\n\nImage Modal\n\n2001\n\nIn April, Salesforce announces its expansion into the worldwide marketplace with headquarters in Dublin and Tokyo.\n\nSalesforce surpasses 3,000 customers, making it the fastest-growing CRM company.\n\nIn November, Benioff is named Chief Executive Officer and Chairman.\n\nSalesforce delivers $22.4 million in revenue for the fiscal year, ending January 31, 2002.\n\n2002\n\nBy end of the year, the company has 5,740 customers, 70,000 users in 107 countries accessing the service in multiple currencies and eight languages.\n\nSalesforce delivers $51 million in revenue for the fiscal year, ending January 31, 2003.\n\nMarc Benioff makes a prediction about the future of Salesforce, CRM, and business: “There were the leaders, but Oracle displaced them. The same thing is going to happen again. It’s the beginning of a brand new technology and business world.”\n\n2003\n\nThe first Dreamforce event is held at the Westin St. Francis hotel in downtown San Francisco. Just over 1,000 registered attendees take part in the event, which has 52 presentations.\n\nsForce 2.0 — the industry’s first on-demand application service — is launched at the event.\n\nThe company’s employees number more than 400.\n\nIt establishes a global presence, opening offices in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Spain, and the U.K.\n\nSalesforce reaches almost $100 million in revenue by year end, files to go public in December.\n\nImage Modal\n\n2004\n\nOn June 23, Salesforce successfully completes its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, raising $110 million at $11 per share.\n\nSalesforce earns $176 million in revenue over the fiscal year ending January 31, 2005.\n\nThe company has 767 employees.\n\nThe customer base has grown to 13,900.\n\nSome 8,000 developers and 150 independent software vendors are using Salesforce technologies to create apps.\n\nSalesforce has 12 offices around the world.\n\n2005\n\nIn September, Salesforce introduces its AppExchange service, offering third-party developers a place to work on their own applications and open them up to Salesforce customers.\n\nBy the end of the year, the company’s customer base stands at 20,500 worldwide, with nearly 400,000 unique users.\n\nThe company surpasses 1,300 employees by end of fiscal year.\n\nIt has earned $309.98 million in revenue for fiscal year ending January 31, 2006.\n\n2006\n\nSalesforce’s mobile journey starts with the acquisition of wireless technology startup Sendia, and the original Salesforce mobile app, AppExchange Mobile.\n\nThe AppExchange ecosystem grows into a vibrant marketplace with 575 apps from 250 independent software vendors.\n\nIn a defining moment, Benioff shares his view that business is the greatest platform for change, publishing The Business of Changing the World with essays by 20 other thought leaders.\n\nThe Power of Us partner program launches, engaging Salesforce’s partners with the 1-1-1 philanthropy model.\n\nSalesforce has 29,800 customers worldwide.\n\nRevenue tops $497 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2007.\n\nImage Modal\n\n2007\n\nIdeaExchange (now Trailblazer Community) launches, inviting customers to contribute new feature ideas for future releases.\n\nAt Dreamforce, plans for the Force.com technology platform are announced, which will allow developers to build applications on the Salesforce platform and create any user interface on demand.\n\nSalesforce reports revenue of $748.7 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2008.\n\nUsers exceed 1.1 million, from 41,000 customers across the globe.\n\nThe AppExchange community has 450 independent software vendor partners.\n\nSalesforce employees log 70,000 volunteer hours.\n\n2008\n\nSalesforce has revenue of just over $1 billion for the fiscal year ending January 31 2009, making it the first cloud computing company to breach the billion-dollar mark in annual revenue.\n\nForbes names Salesforce among the fastest-growing technology companies in the world.\n\nNumber of customers grows to 55,400.\n\nDreamforce in San Francisco reaches a new milestone, with 10,000 registered attendees.\n\nForce.com is released, making it easier for customers to build and install apps on Salesforce’s architecture.\n\n2009\n\nSalesforce launches Service Cloud, bringing customer service and support automation features to the market.\n\nRevenues rise by more than 20% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, ending January 31, 2010.\n\nSalesforce’s global customer base grows to 72,000 customers.\n\nThe first application built on Force.com for the iPhone launches, and it’s the first enterprise partner on Apple’s App Store.\n\nSalesforce.org gives $14 million in grants to support nonprofits.\n\nChairman and CEO Marc Benioff publishes Behind the Cloud, a memoir of Salesforce’s early days and growth to a company with $1 billion in annual revenues.\n\nImage Modal\n\n2010\n\nSalesforce agrees to acquire Heroku, an application platform-as-a-service, to support for the next generation of app developers.
