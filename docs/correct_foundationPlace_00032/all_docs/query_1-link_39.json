Gradually, we moved to additionally suggest and implement Salesforce best practices; propose apps and tools that could serve well; train staff on Salesforce reporting; and build additional custom reports and dashboards.\n\nAs a part of the engagement, Dayspring also helped document existing functionality and processes around Salesforce, putting CalParks in a more resilient place organizationally and ensuring that its mission continues to be fulfilled—and that generations of Californians will continue to enjoy the state’s amazing network of parks."
