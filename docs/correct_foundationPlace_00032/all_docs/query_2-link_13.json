        "text": "Salesforce Tower\n\nAlong with co-development partner Boston Properties, Inc., Hines created an icon on San Franciscoâs majestic skyline with Salesforce Tower, a 1.4 million-square-foot, 61-story office building adjacent to the Transbay Transit Center.\n\nThe obelisk-shaped landmark structure is the second tallest building on the West Coast and the 10th tallest in the country with its crown soaring to a height of 1,070 feet, more than 200 feet above the Transamerica Pyramid. It is the focal point of a massive 145-acre development that includes residential housing, hotels, retail space and a 5.4-acre public rooftop park replete with walking trails, vegetation gardens, lily ponds, an outdoor amphitheater and a grove of redwood trees.\n\nâHines and Boston Properties formed a strong team to produce a superb building that has a transformative impact on the cityâs downtown area. Todayâs leading technology companies are drawn to high-quality, green office space in high-risesâa fact that is demonstrated by Salesforce.comâs commitment to relocating its corporate headquarters to the tower,â commented Paul Paradis, senior managing director for Hines.\n\nHines and Boston Properties formed a strong team to produce a superb building that has a transformative impact on the cityâs downtown area.\n\nPaul Paradis, Hines Senior Managing Director\n\nWith a foundation system consisting of 42 load-bearing elements anchored into bedrock more than 300 feet below grade, Salesforce Tower is the first commercial office building in California designed to an enhanced level of seismic safety, making it one of the safest buildings in the country.\n\nDesigned by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects as a first-of-its-kind workplace that specifically promotes the health and well-being of its occupants, the LEEDÂ® Platinum tower is a fusion of todayâs most cutting-edge achievements in sustainability, technology and engineering.\n\nGreen features include Hinesâ patented floor-by-floor air intake system with high-efficiency air handlers providing significant natural ventilation, plus Under-Floor Air Distribution (UFAD) to enhance indoor air quality, tenant comfort and zone controllability while greatly reducing HVAC and fan-horsepower energy usage. Low-emissivity glass is also utilized to reduce cooling load while increasing energy and light transmission performance, and 10-foot floor-to-ceiling windows afford excellent natural daylight and truly spectacular views.\n\nOther green measures include comprehensive water conservation measures, such as rainwater collection, water reuse and low-flow fixtures, to reduce indoor water use by 40 percent and outdoor water use by 50 percent.\n\nThe stunning urban campus serves as the global headquarters for Salesforce.com, the worldâs #1 CRM platform. As anchor tenant, the tech giant has its own entrance to the building and occupies retail space on the ground floor for a branded presence at street level. The company signed a lease for 732,000 square feet, which represents the largest lease in San Franciscoâs history. The second largest lease on record was signed by JPMorgan Chase for 560 Mission Street, developed by Hines.\n\nâSalesforce is a tremendous partner to our city and our residents, bringing thousands of new jobs to the area and solidifying the Transbay District as a leading destination for innovative companies,â stated former San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee.\n\nSalesforce is a tremendous partner to our city and our residents, bringing thousands of new jobs to the area and solidifying the Transbay District as a leading destination for innovative companies.\n\nEd Lee, former Mayor of San Francisco\n\nSituated on a rare full city-block site, the property is located in the South of Market District with easy access to BART, Muni, AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit and major freeways. Also designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects, the one million-square-foot Transbay Transit Center connects eight Bay Area counties and the State of California through 11 transportation systems including the future High-Speed Rail from San Francisco to Los Angeles/Anaheim.\n\nCompleted in 2017, Salesforce Tower redefines the region with sustainability-focused neighborhood development and unmatched accessibility while helping to expand the districtâs revitalization effort."
