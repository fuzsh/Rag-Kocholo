For media inquiries about Salesforce and its operations, please contact PR@salesforce.com.\n\nYou’ve asked and Salesforce has answered.\n\nThis page answers popular questions about Salesforce, plus some fun facts even long-time employees might not know.\n\n1. How many employees does Salesforce have?\n\nSalesforce has over 72,000 employees globally.\n\nWhile growing at a rapid pace, Salesforce remains intentional about company culture and employee experience.

Salesforce is the #1 AI CRM, empowering companies to connect with their customers in a whole new way through the power of CRM + AI + Data + Trust on one unified platform: Einstein 1. For more, check out this article on Salesforce’s The 360 Blog.\n\n3.

How tall is the Salesforce tower in San Francisco?\n\n1,070 feet. Opened in 2018, the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco is 61 stories and 1.4 million square feet of office space.\n\nFun facts about the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco:\n\nThe Salesforce Tower has one of the largest onsite water recycling systems in a commercial high-rise in the United States — and the first of its kind in San Francisco. The system filters up to 30,000 gallons of water from sinks, toilets, and showers every day then safely repurposes it for non-potable uses. The water savings is equivalent to over 7.8 million gallons a year — about the same amount of water used by 16,000 local residents.\n\nIt takes 39 seconds to travel by elevator from street level to the 61st floor, and 1,762 total steps if you choose to take the stairs.\n\nThe Salesforce Tower foundation is socketed into bedrock, more than 318 feet in the ground.\n\n12,000 tons of steel were used in the construction of Salesforce Tower.\n\nIt took over 2.5 million people hours to build.\n\nLearn more about the San Francisco Salesforce Tower.\n\n7. How diverse is Salesforce?\n\nIn 2017, Salesforce began publishing diversity data. We continue to push ourselves to create a workplace that reflects society and have set goals to drive progress while holding ourselves accountable. By 2030, we aim to reach 45% of employees and 32% of leaders globally who identify as women or non-binary, and 20% of employees and 12% of leaders in the U.S. who identify as underrepresented minorities.\n\nSee our annual equality update from April 2024.\n\n8. How has Salesforce addressed pay fairness in the workplace?\n\nIn 2015, Salesforce was one of the first companies to evaluate and address any gaps in pay among its global workforce across gender globally and race in the U.S. Since then, Salesforce has continued to improve upon its processes and broaden the scope of assessment to include bonuses, promotions, and stock.\n\n9. How is Salesforce a sustainable company?\n\nIn 2021, Salesforce achieved net zero residual emissions across its full value chain and reached 100% renewable energy for its global operations*.\n\nSince first committing to this goal in 2013, Salesforce has been working to accelerate the global transition to clean and renewable sources of electricity with the aim for a future where renewable energy is powering the world around the clock.\n\nSalesforce published its Nature Positive Strategy, outlining specific actions the company will take to accelerate its existing commitment to net zero, nature-positive future. Salesforce has also established sustainability as a core company value and announced AI features for its ESG platform, Net Zero Cloud, and policy principles to make AI more equitable and sustainable.\n\nSustainability priorities to drive toward a 1.5°C future with its Climate Action Plan include: emissions reduction, carbon removal, trillion trees & ecosystem restoration, education & mobilization, innovation, and regulation & policy — offering others a blueprint to accelerate their journey to net zero. In line with our sustainability priorities, Salesforce also co-founded 1t.org, the global movement to conserve, restore and grow healthy forest ecosystems by 2030 and launched an Ocean Sustainability Program to help protect our ocean.\n\nSee the latest Salesforce sustainability news.\n\n10. How much has Salesforce given back to the community?\n\nSince its founding, the company has:\n\nDonated a total of $708M in grants\n\nProvided 8.9M service hours through employee volunteerism\n\nSupported 56K nonprofit and higher education customers through our software\n\nSalesforce is a Pledge 1% founder, member, and champion. Following the 1-1-1 model that Salesforce pioneered, Pledge 1% encourages companies to dedicate any combination of 1% time, 1% product, and 1% profit or 1% equity to improving the world.\n\nSince its launch, more than 18,000 companies from over 100 countries have joined Salesforce in the Pledge 1% movement. Combined, they have set aside equity for social impact, igniting approximately $2 Billion USD in new philanthropy.\n\n11. What is Salesforce’s economic impact?\n\nIn 2023, IDC completed a study that looked at the economic impact of AI-powered cloud solutions in terms of the revenues it creates and jobs generated by those revenues.\n\nThe study showed that between 2022 and 2028, Salesforce and its ecosystem of partners will:\n\nCreate 11.6 million new jobs\n\nBring more than $2 trillion in business revenue\n\n12. How big is Salesforce’s Trailblazer Community?\n\nThe Trailblazer Community is a network of millions of people across the Salesforce ecosystem who help each other learn new skills and succeed with Salesforce. Salesforce celebrates Trailblazers — pioneers, innovators, and lifelong learners. One such Trailblazer is Tony Nguyen, who went from a laid-off restaurant manager to earning a Golden Hoodie, one of the highest honors in the Salesforce Trailblazer Community, given to those who exemplify inspiration and innovation.\n\nTo become certified in Salesforce, anyone can start by checking out Trailhead, the free online learning platform that more than 7 million people have used to learn Salesforce skills and connect with other learners on the Trailblazer Community.\n\n*That means Salesforce purchased carbon credits equivalent to our residual scope 1, 2, and 3 emission, and utilizes renewable energy or renewable energy certificates equivalent to the electricity we use on an annual basis.\n\nMore information"
