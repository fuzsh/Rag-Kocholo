The name changed as of December 2022.Â\n\nTHE MISSION AND SCOPE\n\nRidding the oceans of plastic\n\nThe purpose of American Friends of The Ocean Cleanup is to preserve and protect the natural ocean environment for the benefit of the public. This includes promoting and supporting the efficient and environmentally-friendly extraction of waste from oceans, seas, and other waste areas. It also includes promoting, supporting, and performing the environmentally-friendly recycling of such waste. The American Friends of The Ocean Cleanup raises funds in the US to support its missions.\n\nThe Foundation works closely with Stichting The Ocean Cleanup, a foundation based in The Netherlands, to realize the mission of ridding the worldâs oceans of plastic. The Foundation grants the raised funds to activities aligned with its mission based on grant agreements. The Foundation may also solicit funds for and provide grants to certain Stichting The Ocean Cleanup projects and activities. It is always to the discretion of the Board to determine if and how much funds will be granted.\n\nThe Foundation has supported projects such as the Interceptor project for Kingston Harbor in Jamaica, the Interceptor 004 in Dominican Republic, research equipment for tracking plastic in rivers as well as some of the expenses connected to the operation of System 002.\n\nGovernance of American Friends of The Ocean Cleanup, Foundation\n\nAmerican Friends of The Ocean Cleanup is an independent foundation established under the laws of Delaware and registered in the State of California. It is governed as a US 501(c)3 foundation and holds a public charity status described in IRC Section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) to enable US donors to tax-efficiently support its mission. The Foundationâs sole member is Stichting The Ocean Cleanup.\n\nThe Foundation is managed by its Board of Directors. The Board may delegate the management of the activities of the Foundation to any other person, provided the activities and affairs of the Foundation are managed under the ultimate direction of the Board.\n\nThe members of the Board are not entitled to any remuneration. They are, however, entitled to ask for reimbursement of reasonable costs (such as travel expenses).\n\nStichting The Ocean Cleanup\n\nFor more information on the Dutch foundation, Stichting The Ocean Cleanup, and its affiliated companies, including its annual reports and foundation details click here. For general information on The Ocean Cleanup, we refer to the other website pages related to our mission, technology etcetera."
