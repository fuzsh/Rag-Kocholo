        "text": "Dreamforce 2023 is officially in the books. And we’re happy to announce that Jotform’s first participation in the event went off without a hitch.\n\nSalesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference is a massive event attended by 50,000 professionals from around the world. Other recaps will tell you about the Salesforce product announcements made and this year’s focus on AI.\n\nHere, however, you’ll read about the small part Jotform played at this year’s event. It was a long week, and we’re excited to share our experience with you.\n\nBooth #1912\n\nOur brand-new listing on the Salesforce AppExchange was the reason we wanted to have a presence at Dreamforce, where we could connect with the Salesforce community in person.\n\nThat started with our exhibitor booth. Throughout the three-day event, more than 400 people stopped by to tell us about their business needs.\n\nOur hook to get people to swing by (besides our fabulous product)? Along with our friends and Jotform Enterprise client, the Arbor Day Foundation, we’re planting a tree for every person who paid us a visit. Including a few additional leads we captured around the conference, we’re planting a total of 550 trees.\n\nWe also gave away copies of Jotform CEO Aytekin Tank’s book, Automate Your Busywork. A total of 120 people grabbed a complimentary copy and saved themselves $28 off the retail price.\n\nWine & cheese event\n\nJotform sponsored a wine & cheese event the first night, as a casual way to connect with people and offer a relaxing environment after a long day. Little bit of merlot. Some chardonnay. A variety of cheeses.\n\nImportantly, we were able to take home the leftovers, as well as the slick Jotform-branded napkins and cups.\n\nTeam outing: Foo Fighters\n\nThe Jotform team handed out sales sheets to each and every concert goer who made the trek to the Chase Center to watch the Foo Fighters as a part of Dreamfest, the charity concert offered free to every Dreamforce attendee. We didn’t want to miss the opportunity to get Jotform in front of that many people in one place.\n\nJust kidding. We watched the concert and screamed along with everyone else as Dave Grohl belted his way through the hits. The band pulled up someone from the crowd to play guitar on their closing song, “Everlong,” but we suspect it was all staged. Curious to hear other perspectives in the comments.\n\nTheater session\n\nOn the final day of the conference, we gave a presentation on 5 tips to improve lead capture forms. In the presentation, we talked about the data behind what improves conversions, both from an aesthetic and language perspective, as well as how to turn lead forms into an automation superweapon. The talk was attended by roughly 100 people, many of whom work in marketing, sales, IT, and development, plus a few CEOs.\n\nWere you at Dreamforce 2023? Let us know how your experience was in the comments below."
