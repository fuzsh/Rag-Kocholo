Lee today announced the third year of a multi-year partnership to expand computer science opportunities in San Francisco schools. The Salesforce Foundation is investing $6 million to drastically increase the technology curriculum and resources for San Francisco students—bringing the total three-year investment to nearly $14 million. In addition, Salesforce employees plan to volunteer 10,000 hours during the 2015-2016 school year. Salesforce also announced it will adopt 20 schools in San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) as a part of San Francisco Education Fund and sf.citi's Circle the Schools Initiative.\n\nComments on the news:\n\n\"We know the best investment we can make for our City's future is an investment in our young people, and that's why we are laser focused on making sure our public schools are the best in the nation,\" said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. \"We can't do it alone, and the Salesforce Foundation's continued investment in our public schools through my STEM Leadership Initiative is helping our students gain the skills they need to succeed in the 21st Century economy. Not only is San Francisco-based Salesforce a great partner to our City, bringing thousands of jobs to San Francisco, but they are also giving back through innovative and thoughtful public-private partnerships that keep San Francisco an affordable place and a city where everyone can succeed.\"\n\n\"With leaders like Mayor Lee and Mr. Benioff, San Francisco is the city that is changing the world, with amazing technologies, advances in civil rights and brand-new economies. The San Francisco public schools are bringing that same creativity and forward-thinking to reimagining education to prepare all our students to succeed at school and in life,\" said Superintendent Richard Carranza. \"The 3 year Salesforce investment in our schools is a game changer for us. It is giving the resources we need to provide our students with the best hands-on STEM education in the nation, and to accelerate our ability to expose all students—pre-kindergarten through 12th grade—to rigorous computer science and coding curriculum.\"\n\n\"San Francisco's students deserve access to the very best public education,\" said Suzanne DiBianca, president, Salesforce Foundation. \"By increasing our financial commitment and doubling our employee volunteer hours, the Salesforce Foundation is dedicated to arming a generation of students with the skills to succeed in today's world.\"\n\nContinued Commitment to San Francisco's Schools and Students\n\nBuilding on the Salesforce Foundation's multi-year partnership with SFUSD and Mayor Lee, the Salesforce Foundation's $6 million grant to SFUSD will reach more than 12,500 SFUSD students by:\n\nPiloting computer science curriculum in SFUSD middle schools, giving students the opportunity to participate in daily computer science classes for the first time\n\nContinuing and expanding the Principal's Innovation Fund—granting $100,000 to middle grade principals at 21 SFUSD schools to invest directly into their schools\n\nFunding 14 full-time coaches and teachers to support math and technology instruction in middle schools and five full-time staff members to assist teachers and implement curriculum\n\nPartnering with Common Sense, a national nonprofit organization that provides resources and expertise to families and schools to harness media and technology for life and learning, including a research-based curriculum that's used by more than 260,000 educators nationwide to empower students and parents to be safe, smart, ethical and responsible in the digital world\n\nPartnering with Zynga.org to cohost Game Design Workshops and opportunities to provide students with hands-on technology and computer science education\n\nSalesforce to Circle 20 Schools\n\nAs part of the San Francisco Education Fund and sf.citi's Circle the Schools initiative, Salesforce will adopt 20 SFUSD schools during the 2015-2016 school year:\n\nAlice Fong Yu Elementary School\n\nBessie Carmichael Elementary School\n\nClaire Lilienthal Elementary School\n\nFrancisco Middle School\n\nGeorge Washington High School\n\nHarvey Milk Civil Rights Elementary School\n\nHerbert Hoover Middle School\n\nJames Denman Middle School\n\nLawton Elementary School\n\nMarina Middle School\n\nPaul Revere Elementary School\n\nPresidio Middle School\n\nRoosevelt Middle School\n\nRosa Parks Elementary School\n\nRuth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts\n\nSanchez Elementary School\n\nVisitacion Valley Elementary School\n\nVisitacion Valley Middle School\n\nWilliam L.

The Salesforce Foundation investments in leadership, digital classrooms/ schools, innovation and teacher professional development are dramatically accelerating STEM at the middle grades. The partnership is making profound differences in 21 middle grade schools and for thousands of students every day. The initiative will continue to weave together three major strands of work that will dramatically improve outcomes for middle school students by creating a robust STEM-focused curriculum, instilling a college going/career-focused culture in our students and empowering our leadership to innovate.\n\nAbout the San Francisco Unified School District\n\nThe San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) is one of California's largest and highest performing school districts.
