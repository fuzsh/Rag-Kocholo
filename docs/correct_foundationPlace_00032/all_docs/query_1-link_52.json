The latter had existed as a California public benefit corporation, and now it will be converting into a California business corporation.\n\nSalesforce said that the US$300 million, in turn, will be distributed to another independent public benefit corporation called the Salesforce.com Foundation, which will use it for philanthropic purposes. Salesforce will be making further contributions to the Foundation, but did not specify the amount."
