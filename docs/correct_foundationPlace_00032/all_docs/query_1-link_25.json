        "text": "Main Plaza\n\nThe main plaza of Salesforce Park features an oculus surrounded by a bamboo grove. This open space is a perfect place for people to come and play. There is also a walkable glass floor that is the largest of its kind in the U.S. The main plaza also hosts special events once the sun goes down, such as a music series and immersive fairytales. During the day, there is storytelling with literary artists, fitness classes, and children's activities.\n\nAmphitheater\n\nLocated at the west end of the park, this amphitheater holds up to 1,000 people on its grassy lawn. It's also a great place for a variety of activities, including free yoga classes, concerts and movie nights under the stars.\n\nBus Fountain\n\nA fun feature of the park is this interactive permanent public art installation, a fountain specifically created to correspond with the comings and goings of the buses within the terminal below. Built with more than 1,200 feet of white and gray granite, this contemporary design is one of the world’s longest water artworks.\n\nChildren’s Play Area\n\nLocated between the central lawn and the main plaza is a children's play area, featuring a climbing rope frame on a spongy protective flooring. After romping and frolicking in the play structure, children are free to borrow a book from the Children's Reading Room for impromptu story time, or grab a board game from the game cart.\n\nWalking Trail\n\nThe perimeter of the park is a walking trail that spans half a mile. Along the trail are 13 small botanical gardens with flora and fauna representing different regions of the world.\n\nThe Gondola\n\nThis might not be your normal mode of transportation to a rooftop park, but it sure offers a much more scenic ride than the average elevator or escalator. This one-way gondola ride that takes you from ground level to the park operates 8 a.m.–8 p.m. (May 1–Oct. 31) and 8 a.m.–7 p.m. (Nov. 1–Apr. 30), and is free of charge.\n\nPark Hours\n\nSummer Hours (May 1–Oct. 31): 6 a.m.–9 p.m."
