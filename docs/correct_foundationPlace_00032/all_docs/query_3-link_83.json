        "text": "New grants will benefit high schools and middle schools in cities across the United States\n\nAdditional grantees include nonprofits in the U.S., France, Germany, and the UK that are training students for future careers\n\nSan Francisco — September 11, 2023 – Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the #1 AI CRM, today announced more than $20 million in new grants to U.S. school districts, along with education and workforce development nonprofits preparing students for success.\n\nThese grants come at a critical time when schools, educators, and employers are navigating a rapidly changing world. Generative AI is transforming the classroom and the jobs that will be available in the future. With this funding, students will have more opportunities to take advanced courses, gain in-demand skills, and explore potential new careers. Funding will also support efforts from nonprofits to expand pathways into technology jobs, including AI, helping usher in a more equitable future.\n\nCompanies and schools alike are racing to understand what AI means for young people – whether it be how it’s impacting homework assignments today to how to train students for the jobs of tomorrow\n\nSuzanne DiBianca, EVP and Chief Impact Officer, Salesforce\n\n“Companies and schools alike are racing to understand what AI means for young people – whether it be how it’s impacting homework assignments today to how to train students for the jobs of tomorrow,” said Suzanne DiBianca, EVP and Chief Impact Officer, Salesforce. “This funding will help educators and workforce development organizations prepare the next generations for success now and into the future.”\n\nSalesforce joins high school students and faculty in San Francisco to mark the occasion\n\nAs part of the announcement, Salesforce will today host a “Back to School” celebration at George Washington High School in San Francisco. The education nonprofit aiEDU will kick off the day with a hands-on AI workshop for students, followed by a student roundtable on AI, hosted by Salesforce leaders.\n\nAdditionally, there will be a press conference with San Francisco Mayor London Breed, San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Matt Wayne, Ed.D, Oakland Unified School District Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell, Ed.D, and Salesforce executives Amy Weaver, Chief Financial Officer, and Suzanne DiBianca, Chief Impact Officer.\n\n“As AI continues to transform our schools, workplaces, and society, education has never been more critical,” said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. “I’m proud of our city’s long-standing commitment to the jobs of the future and thankful for Salesforce’s investment to ensure the next generation is set up for success.”\n\n“Salesforce has been an incredible partner to SFUSD for 11 years. Their contributions to San Francisco schools have been instrumental in helping give our students access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses and preparing them for the jobs of the future,” said San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Matt Wayne, Ed.D. “We are grateful to Salesforce for their ongoing commitment to the district and the students of San Francisco.”\n\nThe impact of Salesforce’s 11-year commitment to education\n\nIn 2012, Salesforce made a commitment to support education in our communities and invest in the future workforce. What started as a $2.5 million grant that first year to middle school classrooms in San Francisco public schools has since grown to $233 million in support of education and workforce development around the world – and communities are seeing the impact.\n\nSalesforce continues to invest heavily in the Bay Area, with more than half of this year’s investment going to San Francisco and Oakland schools and nonprofits, to help maintain the progress from the past decade. For example, at San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD), the funding has been used to expand its computer science curriculum.\n\nToday, at least half of its 50,000 students have taken at least one computer science course, and there has been a 3x increase in computer science enrollment for Black, Latinx, and Native American/Indigenous students. In Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), Salesforce funding helped retain high performing diverse teachers, resulting in the lowest staff vacancy rate Oakland middle schools have had in four years.\n\nSupporting the next generation workforce\n\nThe grants allocated specifically for schools this year total $14 million, and will be distributed to districts in San Francisco, Oakland, New York City, Chicago, and Indianapolis. Grantees include:\n\nSan Francisco Unified School District: Supports the district’s efforts to bring career-focused learning to high schools and continues to support improving the middle school experience for students and educators.\n\nOakland Unified School District: Advances the transformation of middle schools through computer science, math, and educator support in addition to wraparound services for newcomer students.\n\nNew York City Public Schools: Builds new high school pathway programs so students are prepared for rewarding careers and long-term economic security.\n\nChicago Public Schools: Improves students’ readiness for postsecondary education with transitional classes, advanced pathway options, and career-connected learning, and creates a pipeline of school leaders.\n\nIndianapolis Public Schools: Prepares students for prosperous jobs in the future and supports students, guardians, and staff for district transformation.\n\nAdditional grants boost AI skills in the workforce\n\nSalesforce will also give $6.8 million to support education and workforce development nonprofits in the U.S., France, Germany, and the UK. With this, Salesforce has given more than $46 million in workforce development grants to date, in addition to $187 million in education giving. These investments aim to equip students with work-based experiences and vital digital skills, including AI, to help students succeed in the changing job landscape and ensure equitable access to tech and AI careers. Organizations include:\n\n3DE Schools (U.S.): Expands career-connected high schools through 3DE’s model, accelerating college and career-readiness, and enhancing teacher effectiveness.\n\nCodePath (U.S.): Reprogramming higher education to create the most diverse generation of engineers, CTOs, and founders.\n\nEducation at Work (U.S.): Helps high-achieving college students gain career-ready skills and financial stability to succeed after postsecondary graduation.\n\nJobs for the Future (U.S.): Improves opportunities for students and workers by expanding IT apprenticeships in San Francisco, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nJewish Vocational Service (U.S.): Helps Bay Area youth explore career paths, learn IT skills, and engage with employers, improving local economic mobility.\n\nMarcy Lab (U.S.): Provides alternative pathways to tech careers for underserved young adults through technical training, leadership development, and employment.\n\nSport dans la Ville (France): Connects underserved youth to meaningful careers through sports, social-emotional skills, digital skills, and career connections.\n\nStart (Germany): Expands access to meaningful education and careers for migrant youth through programs focused on digital skills and career-readiness skills\n\nThe Careers & Enterprise Company (UK): Provides career education in collaboration with primary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and employers.\n\nLearn more:"
