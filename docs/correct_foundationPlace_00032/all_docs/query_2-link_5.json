        "text": "Gupta and team have taken the task of modernizing its legacy core systems to the FedRAMP-authorized Salesforce Customer 360 for Public Sector. This gives the team the ability to support more services, as well as some new, innovative services, across more channels, transforming the DMV from the front to the back office all on one platform:\n\nÂ\n\nDigital eXperience Platform (DXP)\n\nBuilt on Experience Cloud, Public Sector Solutions, and MuleSoft, DXP is the new core system that is enabling agile implementation in parallel to an iterative deployment process. The team is using this to introduce intelligent document processing via integrations with AI/ML and robotics, decision augmentation and automation, and configurable applications that support.\n\nÂ\n\nContact Center\n\nCustomers can visit dmv.ca.gov, a portal environment built on Experience Cloud. If the individual has a question they cannot answer through the website content, AI-driven chat bots serves up answers to FAQs and connects them to a live agent for additional help. These actions and activities are then captured in a personalized profile record in Service Cloud via the Salesforce Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) with the IVR, creating a 360-degree of that Californian. An integration with the language translations services within the live chat.\n\nÂ\n\nVirtual Field Office\n\nIf the customerâs question is too complex for chat or too real-time for email and needs to move to a phone or video call, Salesforce Scheduler automatically moves the customer from the contact center to the virtual field office based on escalation criteria and workflow rules.\n\nâWe let the customer start interacting with us virtually and get them as far as possible using automated workflows. In the meantime, we also put them into a virtual queue so that if they get to the end or still have to go into a physical office, they can pick up where they left off instead of standing in line and starting over,â said Gupta.\n\nÂ\n\nMobile Driverâs License Pilot\n\nCustomers can download the DMV mobile wallet app to their smartphone, where they are then prompted to verify their presence and their driverâs license. MuleSoft then carries that data through to the DMVâs system of record, built on Service Cloud and AWS to perform identity checks, digital signatures and provisioning of the mobile license as a digital credential. The architecture is able to support multiple open source and native wallet platform via an elastic and scalable architecture."
