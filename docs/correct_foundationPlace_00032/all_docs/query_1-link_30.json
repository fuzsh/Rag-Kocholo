        "text": "The Power of Love is RSM’s annual stewardship campaign, where each office selects a local youth-focused charity to support with fundraising and volunteering opportunities. Offices host various fun events to encourage support from our people, family and friends, as well as team volunteering opportunities to maximize our impact on local communities. We amplify those efforts with an additional match from the RSM US Foundation, and the total impact is announced at The RSM Classic each November.\n\nThe Dollars for Doers program supports our people’s passions by magnifying their gifts of time to charitable organizations that support youth in their communities. Individual employees can earn up to a $2,400 grant each. Groups of RSM volunteers have limitless grant-earning potential; the more hours volunteered, the more grant dollars earned.\n\nSince the program’s 2015 inception, the foundation has provided nearly $3 million in grants for more than 2,000 individuals and teams.\n\nIn 2019, RSM launched a national relationship with Junior Achievement USA. This relationship allows RSM to expand volunteer and financial support of Junior Achievement and allows our people to educate and empower youth through financial literacy. With more than $2.3 million in grant funding, RSM supported the development of the Take Stock in Your Future curriculum and the Stock Market Challenge simulation. The curriculum and simulation allow high school students to gain a deeper understanding of investing and the impact of current events on the stock market. As of 2024, we’re supporting programming in more than 27 local chapters in the U.S. and Canada. Through this relationship, RSM fosters confident, competent future business leaders equipped with real-world learning and skills.\n\nRSM's value of stewardship: acting responsibly calls for us to give back and support the next generation of business and technology professionals by backing U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities. We do this through our University Match program and our University Impact Fund.\n\nThe University Match program, including personal donations from our people and a match from the foundation, has infused more than $3.6 million into 25 schools in the areas where our people live and work. The program has created longstanding funding to ensure students and faculty have the financial support needed to excel.\n\nThe University Impact Fund provides one-time grants to colleges and universities that influence communities where our people live and work. Funding supports programming, events and activities that help schools empower future professionals in technology, diversity and inclusion, and innovation. The funds provide students access to speakers, programs, networking and other resources. Since its inception in early 2020, the program has supported more than 70 programs, activities or events across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWe are honored to support business and technology students across the U.S. and Canada by alleviating the financial burden of funding their educations so they can focus on achieving their goals—in school and beyond.\n\nOur University Scholarship program helps build tomorrow’s middle market leaders through one-time campus-based awards that support business and technology students. Each college and university selects and awards winning students on behalf of the RSM US Foundation. Since 2019, we’ve helped more than 420 students pursue their degrees.\n\nIn addition to our University Scholarship program, the RSM US Foundation directly awards 31 student scholarships annually with nearly $400,000 through our Power Your Education, First Generation, Power of Inclusion and Power Your Transition programs. Through these programs, we’ve supported more than 130 students."
