        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Salesforce.com(R), the market leader in online customer relationship management (CRM), today announced that it has received the Award for Excellence in Corporate Community Service by the Points of Light Foundation and Volunteer Center National Network. Salesforce.com, which has been focused on integrating business with the community since it's 1999 inception, was honored for creating a socially responsible corporate culture and making a significant impact on the communities where its employees work in its early stages and in innovative ways. The other honorees include: John Hancock Financial Services (NYSE:JHF), Oracle (Nasdaq:ORCL), SAFECO (Nasdaq:SAFC), IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM) and Universal Parks & Resorts. Hamilton Jordan, former chief of staff, Carter Administration, will be the keynote speaker at the luncheon.\n\nSalesforce.com's 1% model, in addition to offering 1% of the company's equity and 1% of the company's profits, grants 1% of employee work time -- six paid days every year -- to ensure that as the business grows so does its contribution to the community. The salesforce.com/foundation, established as the vehicle that drives this 1% model, initiates and manages a variety of volunteer programs designed to not only have impact on the community, but also inspire a variety of volunteer activities and commitments.\n\n\"Salesforce.com's integrated business model, especially the volunteer program, is a fundamental part of building a culture of service and acknowledges the interdependence of community and corporate success,\" said Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO of salesforce.com and the salesforce.com/foundation. \"The end of corporate philanthropy as we know it is just as important as the end of software, and I am extremely proud of our tireless and dedicated employees and partners, who enable us to push these limits.\"\n\n\"These winning companies are engaging thousands of men and women in volunteer service across America and the world,\" said Robert K. Goodwin, president and CEO of the Points of Light Foundation. \"The estimated value of their combined effort is priceless to those in need.\"\n\nThe Points of Light Foundation, established under former President George Bush, promotes volunteerism and advocates community service through its partnership with the Volunteer Center National Network and annually selects only a handful of companies that exemplify corporate community service through their company sponsored volunteer programs, which meet strategic business goals and target serious social problems. The 10th Annual Awards for Excellence in Corporate Community Service, the nation's premier annual gathering of business leaders supporting workplace-based volunteerism, provides honorees with the opportunity to highlight their volunteer programs. Benioff and other executives will address thought-provoking questions around the trends of business engagement in community service and workplace volunteering. The free event begins at 8:00 a.m. PST, and is open to the public during the Business Leadership Forum from 10:30-12:30 PST.
