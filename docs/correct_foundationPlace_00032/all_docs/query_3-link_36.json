        "text": "Founded in 1999 by American entrepreneur and former Oracle (ORCL) executive Marc Benioff, Salesforce, touting the slogan “The end of software,” differentiated itself from its competitors by offering cloud-based services as an alternative to packaged software and hardware systems. The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\nKey products and services\n\nAs of 2024, Salesforce is the largest global provider of CRM services, with a market share of 24%—more than the next four competitors combined—Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), and Adobe (ADBE). Its most widely used products include:\n\nSales cloud. Salesforce’s flagship CRM platform is designed to streamline the sales pipeline while also supporting marketing and customer support efforts in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) settings.\n\nService cloud. Tailored for service agents and managers, Salesforce’s Service Cloud is designed to support a company’s customer service efforts.\n\nMarketing cloud. Salesforce’s digital marketing platform is geared toward helping businesses create and manage marketing campaigns.\n\nCommerce cloud. The company’s e-commerce platform enables businesses to build their online retail sites and automate processes and services to optimize customers’ online shopping experience.\n\nTableau CRM (formerly Einstein Analytics). This cloud-based platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to analyze real-time CRM data and provide predictive analytics to help businesses make more informed decisions.\n\n1999–2001: Foundation, launch, and the dotcom bubble\n\nIn 1999, Salesforce emerged on the tech scene in San Francisco with a stated mission to revolutionize the CRM industry by automating sales processes and providing Internet-based B2B solutions.\n\nAt the time of Salesforce’s inception, cloud-based CRM technologies were largely overlooked. They were deemed a “fad” technology, best suited for start-ups and small businesses, but not enterprise-level operations due to their lack of scalability.\n\nBack then, standard CRM solutions were software-driven, and hosted and managed locally (i.e., at the customer level). Customers would purchase a license for a CRM software package that would then have to be integrated with the company’s existing IT infrastructure, requiring additional expenses for hardware, implementation, maintenance, and support. In addition, many businesses found CRM ownership to be burdensome because of the cost and complexity to implement and maintain the software.\n\nIn 2000, Salesforce launched its first cloud-based and SaaS CRM platform. The timing was unfortunate, as it coincided with the dot-com bubble and subsequent crash. When the economy fell into a recession in 2001, many of Salesforce’s clients were wiped out. Despite having to lay off 20% of its workforce (of 40 employees), Salesforce managed to survive the economic downturn, taking in an annual revenue of $5.4 million in the 2000 fiscal year.\n\nThe following year, Salesforce upgraded its platform with enhanced automation for sales, marketing, and customer service and support. While in only its second year of operation, Salesforce was awarded InfoWorld’s Top 10 CRM Technology of the Year. That year also marked the company’s entry into the international market, as it opened new headquarters in Dublin and Tokyo. Having surpassed 3,000 B2B customers, Salesforce became, as Morgan Stanley acknowledged, the “fastest growing online CRM company.” Its annual revenue that fiscal year jumped to $22.4 million.\n\n2002–2006: Growth and expansion\n\nSalesforce had already made a considerable impact in the industry as it entered its third year of operation. Having developed its CRM products on the basis of two previously overlooked solutions—cloud-based operation (for small to enterprise-level businesses) and SaaS subscription models—Salesforce was able to create new value and generate new demand, disrupting the industry status quo.\n\nMobile, on-demand access. Because Salesforce offers a Web-based platform, users could access CRM data from almost any device (and from any location) as long as Internet access was available. This provided a mobile and on-demand flexibility that was not available from most desktop applications.\n\nCentralized maintenance and troubleshooting. Software-based CRM systems normally required in-house expertise, which increased operational complexities and costs for most businesses. Platform maintenance became easier as the provider deployed and maintained the applications.\n\nSalesforce’s SaaS subscription model reduced the total cost of acquiring a CRM package by more than half, and eliminated much of the complexity of managing and maintaining the system.\n\nIn 2002, Salesforce expanded its platform’s functionalities with the CRM Enterprise Edition. The company’s global expansion efforts continued well into the next year; the company now had a workforce of more than 400 employees. In 2004, Salesforce filed an initial public offering (IPO) and shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol CRM.\n\nSalesforce’s AppExchange launch in 2005 was another significant step. It marked one of the earliest instances of a company-centric ecosystem and marketplace offering third-party app solutions (similar to Apple Inc.’s popular App Store, but for business solutions).\n\nIn addition to validating and legitimizing SaaS and cloud computing as reliable CRM technologies, AppExchange also enabled third-party developers to create and sell products to Salesforce users, allowing businesses to extend, enhance, and customize their CRM functionalities.\n\n2007–2010: Platform customization and revenue milestones\n\nAs Salesforce continued to transform the CRM landscape, disrupting the standard practice of on-premises software solutions, it attracted a handful of new entrants that were successful in copying Salesforce’s business model, including Zoho, RightNow Technologies, NetSuite, and Salesnet.\n\nIn response, Salesforce launched Force.com, a cloud-based development platform, as a differentiator. Many of the new entrants were not equipped to provide customization services. Salesforce encouraged customers to build their own CRM systems to suit their companies’ needs using both Force.com and AppExchange.\n\nSalesforce’s turn toward customization for its user base also marked a shift toward the developers themselves. In 2010, a year after launching Service Cloud (one of its key platforms tailored for customer service agents), Salesforce also acquired Heroku, a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider. While SaaS provides customers with cloud-based software solutions, PaaS provides developers with cloud-based platforms to build customizable software.\n\nWhat’s significant about this stage, besides Salesforce’s rapid growth, was how it strategically maneuvered its direction to solidify its industry position against both incumbent and new industry rivals. Notably, Salesforce.com joined the S&P 500 in 2008, and in the following year, it became the first cloud computing company to exceed $1 billion in revenue. Its workforce grew to 4,750 employees, and its Force.com platform hosted 185,000 custom applications.\n\n2011–2015: Productivity, digital marketing, and the Fortune 500\n\nIn 2011, Salesforce launched Chatter, a communication tool within its CRM platform that enhanced an organization’s capacity to connect, share files, and collaborate in real time. Although this marked a major advancement in enterprise collaboration, Salesforce’s more pivotal advance came a few years later when it acquired ExactTarget, a company that developed software for digital marketing analytics and automation.\n\nNot only was this Salesforce’s largest acquisition—purchased for $2.5 billion—but it also marked the company’s foray into the marketing space. ExactTarget provided the technological foundation for what would later become Salesforce’s Marketing Cloud.\n\nIn 2011, Salesforce was neck and neck with Oracle in leading the global CRM industry. It also marked another strong consecutive year of revenue growth (37%). Two years later, Salesforce would see its annual revenue surpass $3 billion. In 2015, it joined the Fortune 500 list.\n\n2016–2019: CRM cloud leadership and artificial intelligence\n\nBy 2016, Salesforce established its status as the world’s leading CRM provider, having secured 18% of the global industry market share—a substantial lead over its incumbent competitors Oracle (9.4%) and SAP (7.2%).\n\nAs CRM SaaS became the standard throughout the global corporate sector, Salesforce made another move forward by rolling out advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions on its existing platforms. Salesforce’s Einstein Analytics ushered in a new era of “smart” data analytics, personalization, and automation that gave businesses cutting-edge tools to optimize their operations.\n\nIn three years, Salesforce would combine Einstein Analytics with the data visualization and business analytics capabilities of another acquisition, Tableau. Although Salesforce already held the distinction of being the first provider to integrate CRM with AI capabilities (as early as 2006), its sheer size, market share, and acquisitions gave it a nearly unparalleled advantage in the budding integration of CRM and generative AI technologies.\n\n2020s: Slack, generative AI, and sustainable growth\n\nThe year 2020 would prove to be pivotal for Salesforce, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced a quick transition to distributed workforces, digital headquarters, and real-time remote collaboration. Although Salesforce platforms already had functionalities suitable for remote collaboration, what was missing was the communication piece.\n\nIn December 2020, Salesforce announced the purchase of real-time communication platform Slack Technologies in a deal valued at about $28 billion. The acquisition, which closed in July 2021, turned out to be well timed. Salesforce had previously launched a similar communications tool called Chatter, which only worked within the Salesforce interface. Slack offered broader access in addition to more advanced functionalities.\n\nAfter the Slack integration, Salesforce launched Salesforce+, a streaming service that featured various media programming (including original series and podcasts) designed for businesses operating in a digital-first and work-anywhere environment.\n\nSalesforce’s drive toward continuous and industry-specific innovations saw its entry into new sectors, industries, and applications, such as financial services, health care, and generative AI with cross-industry applications. Since its founding years, Salesforce has strived to identify and open up less-contested market space along the edges of an existing market (CRM).\n\nThe next challenge for Salesforce is similar to that of other entrenched leaders. A generation ago, Salesforce was the intrepid start-up, disrupting the established CRM ecosystem. Now it’s the established CRM leader trying to maintain its position amid a new generation of innovations."
