        "text": "What an interesting year 2019 has been for Salesforce.org so far.\n\nIn January it announced its first-ever acquisition, of RoundCorner. Then two weeks ago, it was announced that Salesforce.org (SFDO) was itself being acquired by its corporate parent Salesforce.com (SFDC). Wow.\n\nIn addressing the announcement on an investor call April 15, SFDC’s co-CEO Keith Block said “this is something that has been discussed and worked on for a very long time,“ a “multi-year effort.” Ok, Mr. Block, but still...didn’t see that coming!\n\nSo far there have been only a few public details. What has been said has been within the official announcement on April 15, on the investor call with Block and SFDC President and CFO Mark Hawkins, and a blog post by SFDO CEO Rob Acker. To summarize:\n\nSFDC will create a new nonprofit and education vertical led by Rob Acker.\n\nThe new vertical will be responsible for the sales, marketing and customer success of Salesforce to the nonprofit and education communities.\n\nThe new vertical will be responsible for the development of SFDO's Nonprofit Cloud, Education Cloud and Philanthropy Cloud vertical applications.\n\nSFDO will continue to provide free and discounted software to nonprofits.\n\nAll of this makes it sound like SFDO will continue to operate more or less as-is but inside of SFDC instead of as an independent entity. To the extent that this holds true, I think this is the best possible outcome of the acquisition.\n\nWhy? Salesforce already has tremendous presence and momentum within the nonprofit space where it plays an important role in providing technology and services. Even if this move is primarily about adding to SFDC’s bottom line, it would just make good business sense for them to keep that momentum going by continuing to serve the sector in a focused way. But if this focus gets diluted as a result of this acquisition it would not be good for their business growth or for the sector. If this acquisition means that there are fewer, rather than more, resources dedicated to nonprofits across sales, customer service, product development, and alliances, that would be bad news for nonprofits.\n\nHere are some thoughts about how the acquisition could (and should) play out in each of those areas.\n\nSales: The How\n\nStarting in 2008, SFDO (operating as the Salesforce Foundation at the time) adopted a traditional sales model to sell Salesforce products into the nonprofit market. This model over time has come to closely mirror the way sales is structured and run at SFDC itself. Therefore, I would not expect much to change in how Salesforce goes about selling into the market. SFDO already pretty much sells like SFDC. It is what it is.\n\nSales: The What\n\nHowever, a couple of things may change. First, on the investor call Block mentioned that the acquisition will give nonprofits greater access to the entire Salesforce product portfolio. Up until now, there has often been a lag time between when SFDC customers were able to purchase new products and when they were available to SFDO customers. Under this new arrangement, it sounds like that distinction may no longer exist so nonprofits may be able to purchase Salesforce’s latest offerings sooner. So this may change what is sold, or at least when it's sold. If you are a nonprofit who is in need of the newest thing from Salesforce, this could be good news.\n\nSales: The Who\n\nSecondly, it will be interesting to see who gets to sell to nonprofits going forward. Again, it sounds like the new nonprofit vertical will continue to own sales into the market. But having this sales function now inside of SFDC may create confusion and blur lines internally at SFDC and externally with clients when it comes to who gets to work with which customers. Hopefully SFDC will keep the lines very clear and nonprofits will be able to continue to work with sales teams who are dedicated to the nonprofit space and who have been trained and equipped to understand and serve the market. However, if you are a nonprofit that suddenly finds itself being on the call list of multiple sales teams, well, that would be bad news for you.\n\nSales: The Why\n\nSFDO has been proud of its own status as a nonprofit and talks about its social mission of taking its profits and giving them to nonprofits in the form of grants. With the acquisition, I assume that SFDO’s profits will now be treated like all other profits at SFDC and accrue to corporate shareholders.\n\nIn his remarks, Block noted that the total addressable market in the nonprofit sector is $13 billion, “so there is a lot of opportunity” and “the market has been underserved.” So clearly SFDC sees this new nonprofit vertical as a way to help drive the company's growth and is not intending to take its foot off of the accelerator. Interestingly, SFDO’s own growth has outpaced that of its parent. On the investor call it was noted that SFDO grew at a rate of 38 percent year-over-year last year. Compare that to SFDC’s own growth rate of 26 percent. Do I detect a whiff of growth envy?\n\nSo, with the acquisition there is ostensibly more at stake for the nonprofit sales team because now their sales performance will affect SFDC’s bottom line and stock performance. And when sales people are under increased pressure to sell, customers need to be ready for increased pressure to buy. So, you know, caveat emptor and all that.\n\nBlock did say SFDC as a whole would continue to make contributions to the Salesforce Foundation going forward but did not provide further details about how much and on what terms.\n\nSales: The How Much\n\nBut the main question regarding sales is how will the acquisition change what nonprofits have to pay for Salesforce technology? Under the current arrangement, SFDC gives the technology to SFDO for free which then resells it at a deep discount. That reseller arrangement will end, but as noted above SFDC has said it will continue to provide free and discounted software to the sector. Making this high-end technology affordable to nonprofits has been the central mission of SFDO and among their greatest contributions to the sector. If this commitment truly does not change, that will be great news.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nOver the past few years, SFDO has instituted and grown its Customer Success Group (CSG). As with sales, this function was modeled on the way “customer success” operated within SFDC, with roles such as Success Managers, Customer Success Architects, Program Architects, etc. being created to serve SFDO customers. So I would not expect to see the model change much. And again, if the nonprofit sector will continue to be served by a dedicated team that is experienced and skilled in addressing the unique needs of nonprofits, that will be good news.\n\nProduct Development\n\nIn its earlier days, SFDO had only one product offering of its own, the free Nonprofit Starter Pack (NPSP), later rebranded as the Nonprofit Success Pack. But in more recent years SFDO has began to rapidly expand its products which now include Education Data Architecture (EDA - formerly HEDA), Salesforce Advisor Link (SAL), Philanthropy Cloud, and FoundationConnect and NGO Connect through its RoundCorner acquisition.\n\nNow it appears the SFDO product development function will work more closely with SFDC. Block spoke of “integrated R&D” between the two entities and the opportunity for SFDC and SFDO to learn from each other.\n\nIf more resources can be harnessed from SFDC for nonprofit product development, then that will be good news for the sector. However, I have two concerns.\n\nThe first is that in the grand scheme of SFDC’s R&D, SFDO's product priorities might fall pretty far down the list and may end up getting less love than they do now. Last year SFDO’s revenue was $250 million, whereas SFDC’s revenue was $13.28 billion. How much additional R&D is SFDC willing to put into a vertical that may represent only 2 percent of its revenue?\n\nOn the flip side, if SFDC were to start aggressively funding nonprofit product development (or product acquisition), that could be bad news for the existing product partners in Salesforce’s nonprofit ecosystem who might find themselves displaced. It would also be bad news for Salesforce's competitors, as it would be hard for almost any company in the space to compete with Salesforce's deep pockets. Even the Charleston Post-Courier, the hometown newspaper of SFDO’s chief competitor Blackbaud, wondered as much in a recent article titled \"Salesforce acquisition in California could spell trouble for SC-based Blackbaud\". So if the net effect is less innovation and/or less choice, that would be bad news for nonprofits.\n\nAlliances\n\nThis topic is close to my heart as I have spent the past eleven years working for and with SFDO partners. SFDO has for many years had a partner program to cultivate and support implementation firms who serve the nonprofit space. Implementing and supporting Salesforce successfully for nonprofits is not easy. Salesforce encompasses a broad and complex set of technologies that is ever-expanding and evolving, most of which is not purpose-built for nonprofits. Helping nonprofits adopt it successfully requires a deep understanding of the technology, nonprofit industry best practices, and organizational culture and dynamics. Therefore, a strong and informed partner network that is dedicated to needs and challenges of the nonprofit sector is critical to SFDC’s success. If the nonprofit vertical will continue to vet, enable and promote its own set of nonprofit implementation partners (and product partners), that will be good news for nonprofits.\n\nCommunity\n\nPerhaps the strongest asset that SFDO possesses is one that cannot be valued in dollars and cents. No, not Sprinty the T-Rex. Or, rather not JUST Sprinty the T-Rex; it’s the whole user community. It is truly amazing to see the passion among Salesforce’s nonprofit users, not only for the technology, but to see one another succeed. This manifests itself in many ways. One is through the Power of Us Hub, SFDO's dedicated online community for customers, partners, and staff where there is an incredible depth and breadth of ideas and information exchanged daily. There are also Open Source Sprints where these same parties (including Sprinty) gather to jointly develop SFDO’s product offerings. SFDO supports nonprofit user groups around the country as well as events like the Higher Ed Summit which drew 2,000 attendees last month. SFDO has also nurtured independent community groups like Amplify which supports and advocates for underrepresented voices in the tech sector (again, including Sprinty).\n\nSFDC would be wise to do whatever it can to keep this community spirit and community support strong and not underestimate its contribution to Salesforce’s success in the nonprofit sector. Do you agree? Then it will come as no surprise that there are already community-led efforts underway on the Power of Us Hub to encourage SFDC to preserve what is best about SFDO. You can add your signature to the open letter here.\n\nPeople\n\nFinally, a word about the people at SFDO. Acquisitions by their nature are disruptive, as the organizations figure out how to work together, individuals figure out where they fit, and new ways of doing business evolve. As part of this acquisition, Block said Salesforce plans to \"streamline areas of operational duplication to create a more efficient model.” Perhaps some jobs will be lost as a result. Perhaps some people will leave because they don’t like the changes that unfold. Just as with the SFDO community, I hope SFDC will recognize what an asset it has in the people of SFDO who are some of the brightest minds and committed advocates in the nonprofit tech sector. Listen to them and take care of them and give them a platform for greater influence, SFDC. And if you are someone at SFDO, take care of yourself. I personally hope you will hang in there and continue to do great work for the benefit of the nonprofit sector.\n\nSalesforce has long been a leader in corporate philanthropy. As this next chapter in Salesforce’s relationship with the nonprofit sector unfolds, the best news will be if that commitment not only does not waiver but actually strengthens. In announcing the acquisition, Block said “By joining Salesforce, Salesforce.org will have the opportunity to tap into our company’s vast resources, driving even greater innovation and efficiency for the nonprofit, education, and philanthropy customers.” If done well, Mr. Block, I’ll be happy to see that coming."
