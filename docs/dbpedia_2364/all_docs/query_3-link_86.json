        "text": "Few things tug at a therapist’s heartstrings as hard as when we trace the predictable steps to the end of a relationship.\n\nOne of the hardest realizations is when a wife enters a marriage hoping for someone to care about her feelings and needs, to be curious about her thoughts, and to share the workload of life and support her, only to discover that her husband wasn't going to do that. Marriages like this often become victims of 'Walkaway Wife Syndrome'.\n\nWhat is Walkaway Wife Syndrome?\n\nCoined in 1996 by journalist Paul Akers, the term rose to popularity in 2023 and 2024 as women, often motivated by social media postings encouraging women to expect more from the type of male partners often referred to as \"one of the kids\". Women in marriages where the wife is called a \"married single mother\". She may have tried to get him to change, or she may have simply pulled back, emotionally, more every time her needs aren't met.\n\n11 signs a marriage may end due to Walkaway Wife Syndrome\n\n1. Her dreams are unfulfilled\n\nWhen the relationship fails to meet expectations for fulfillment and happiness, a wife might lower the bar and integrate disillusion into her mindset. Especially troubling is the disappointment that caused her to withdraw could have been a stepping stone to a fulfilling relationship between two motivated people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. She knows it was preventable — but he doesn't have a clue\n\nIn a relationship, there are many opportunities for her partner to say, “I want to hear more. Let’s talk about it.\" He can also say, \"I have planned something for us\" or \"Let me help\" and even \"I am sorry\". But with each missed opportunity, excuse, justification, or neglect, his wife becomes more negative.\n\nShe thinks, “This isn’t working. He doesn’t care. I deserve better.” Unknown to her, these casual negative thoughts, when entertained regularly, become negative thinking patterns that often catastrophized as insurmountable issues. We are human. When we feed a thought, it becomes a belief to prompt further action. Thus a scenario of poor communication, frustration, or disengagement that might have been solved, instead feeds the belief the scenario at home is intolerable.\n\nLack of communication, everyday frustrations, and unresolved conflict will lead to disconnection if it isn't caught quickly. When her life partner resists her attempts to fix things, she can give up too quickly. When he refuses to hear her concerns time after time, she will likely become even more guarded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. She is aware the problems were treatable\n\nThe therapist tracking a wife on her way to “Walking Away Syndrome” may be concerned by the couple growing apart and emotionally neglecting each other. She recommends an intervention or self-help, but the wife continues to detach emotionally from the marriage and finds it easier to maintain victimhood, frustration, and resentment than to be fully vulnerable. The husband may not know how to change, or he may simply choose not to.\n\n4. She accepts the end as a forgone conclusion\n\nMultiple scenarios preempt walking away. Among those frequently used in our culture are “growing apart” or “not compatible” and while these are justified concerns that demand action, when they cause our disconnection and negativity, our relationship is already over. Individuals change and grow over time, sometimes in different directions, but accepting exit as a foregone conclusion results in unnecessary loss.\n\nsilverkblackstock via Shuttterstock\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Her abruptness becomes necessary for wellbeing\n\nThe decision to walk away can be sudden for the spouse who is unaware of the extent of their partner's unhappiness, and few men are prepared for a decision their wife has nurtured and planned for years. Some men are devastated, feel betrayed, and don’t recover from the trauma before making bad choices, suffering breakdowns, and damaging treasured bonds with others.\n\nWithout disregarding a woman’s need to be with the right partner, and her responsibility for her happiness, walking away can feel like the betrayal of a sacred trust. She likely feels his lack of accountability and willingness to change as betrayal, as well.\n\nSFC via Shutterstock\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne tragic element of a wife’s exit is the broken relationships she has fostered over many years. A couple's separation leaves extended family, friends, and community relationships shocked, mourning, and wondering if their relationship was authentic.\n\n6. She is growing tired of one-sided awareness\n\nOne-sided awareness can contribute to the heartbreak of the spouse left behind. However lopsided the relationship has been, the offending spouse is unaware of the depth of their partner's unhappiness or the severity of the issues in the marriage. The partner leaving can also feel corresponding distress because they have secretly plotted a path to distress.\n\n7. She may experience guilt and self-blame\n\nHowever justified, the departing spouse may experience guilt and self-blame for not being able to fix the marriage, while the spouse who is left behind may blame themselves for not noticing the signs or for failing to meet their partner's needs. One sad byproduct of sudden walking away that leads to the end of a relationship is the painful emotions on both sides and the absence of empathy for the one left behind. A more conscious and thoughtful exit might mitigate these side effects and allow each person a less painful exit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She imagines infidelity or a new relationship\n\nA couple experiencing the levels of disconnection leading to “walking away” faces multiple temptations of infidelity. Considering the length of time and negativity the dissatisfied spouse experiences, she may be able to justify seeking a happier relationship. Infidelity is another unanswered question that spouses have when left behind and likely regret.\n\nThe question of why their partner chose to leave and what they could have done differently gets underscored by the unspoken fear there was someone else. This lack of closure can prolong the grieving process and make it difficult to move on.\n\n9. There have been many lost opportunities for reconciliation\n\nIt is the silent withdrawal over many months or years that lulled him into believing all was well, but it was her stubborn refusal to work on the relationship that left him stunned. He doesn't know she has envisioned, fantasized, and idealized her freedom from the stress he caused. Her feelings have long since exited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision was final long ago and made without his input. Children in the home may also feel neglected by the walk-away wife’s decision.\n\n10. Impact on children no longer matters\n\nThe suddenness of the breakup can have a profound effect on children as they struggle to understand why one of their parents has left. The wife has likely considered the children in her decision, but she may not realize the extent adult children can feel abandoned and confused by taking the side of the parent left behind. Young or older, all children mourn the loss of a parent and long to have a home with two parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Broken dreams appear to be a better option than loneliness and isolation\n\nBoth spouses may experience feelings of loneliness and isolation as they navigate life after the breakup. Even the spouse walking away will deal with the reality of broken dreams, fractured support systems, and social networks. The spouse left behind can feel like a “throw-away,” a loser in relationships and life.\n\nWalkaway Wife Syndrome is especially sad because it represents the breakdown of a once-loving relationship and the loss of once-shared hopes, dreams, and companionship. It's especially sad because there may have been many chances for it to be saved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe typical use of the term \"Walkaway Wife Syndrome\" often overlooks the reality that working through differences is a part of the couple's journey. Many have navigated past their disappointments into a more conscious and intentional relationship, but if one of the partners doesn't think working through differences and growing together is necessary, loneliness and isolation feel inevitable. The woman walking away wants connection, but the silence, withdrawal, and secrecy guarantee further breakdown and a cycle of more withdrawal.\n\nThe growing incidents of Walkaway Wife Syndrome highlight the importance of open communication, mutual understanding, and continuous effort in maintaining a healthy and fulfilling marriage.\n\nReta Walker is a relationship therapist with over 25 years of experience, specializing in helping couples get back on track."
