I wanted to provide a platform for stimulating photographer's imaginations, inspiring them to learn new techniques and approaches to making landscape and nature photography images, and to develop a community where we can showcase some of the best and often hidden talent that can be found in the nature and landscape photography space. The journey has been quite the ride and I had a rough start; however, I believe that this podcast is simply the best landscape and nature photography podcast that exists on planet earth. There are countless podcasts that have tried to copy what I am doing here; however, I think I've set the standard for what makes an interesting, informative, entertaining, and thought-provoking landscape photography podcast. If you don't believe me, see a small handful of our reviews on Apple Podcasts:"
