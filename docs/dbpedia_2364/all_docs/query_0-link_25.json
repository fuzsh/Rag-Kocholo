It served as a reminder that any proposed plans are just that and are not intended to serve as a pre-zoning zoning map. A presentation was made by sev- eral of the consultants hired to assist the village with a Route 173 corridor plan that is available on the village's web site www.antioch-il.org. \"Tliis will ultimately become a revision, of the Comprehensive Plan,\" said Sillian. \"There is a differ- ence between a plan and zoning map.\" He further explained that a \"plan\" will offer a long range view of what the corridor might look like while a zoning map is merely a snap- shot ■ of n particular, segment in time of any given area. ■ ~-^-»i-'\" \"You're missing the whole point if you use the Comprehensive Plan as a pre-zoning zoning map/' lie said. Additionally, Silhan clarified that the meeting with the combined plan commission and zoning board was a workshop discussion and not a public hearing. Silhan said at the last meeting, held specifically to garner public input, that the most discussed item was traffic. \"Traffic came up more than any- thing else,\" he said. \"The main com- ment was 'don't develop until the roads are widened,' but IDOT (Illinois Department of Transportation) doesn't do that. IDOT doesn't build until the need is . there.\" Valerie Kretchmer, who's firm was hired to complete a market assessment, said the projected growth to the area is expected to be 72 percent by the year 2020, and that the majority of that population increase will be in the area of Deep Lake Road. She recommended keeping retail at key intersections such as Deep Lake Road, Savage Road ancl Route 45. \"You want to, avoid a con- tinuous strip of retail along (Route) 173, but lots of curb cuts aren't very ^attractive either,\" she said: -•■■*•— Kretchmer discussed residential uses in the area. \"There's going to be a lot of call for townhouses, condos and upscale apartments for the 55 plus crowd with walk-able develop- ment.\" She noted that Lake County would like to .make the Abbott prop- erty, east of Route 45, the corporate Sheriffs office scouts for boat in hit, run By JUUE MURPHY Staff Reporter Though there were no serious injuries in a hit-and-run boating accident on Grass Lake, July 3, the lake County Sheriffs Office is investigating the incident and searching for the offending boat. \"Two people were hurt in the accident,\" said Sgt. Gary Govekar. \"One passenger was thrown over- board and had an injury to his eye and a girl had minor injuries to her right arm and shin.\" • Govekar said neither victim was hurt badly and both are fine. Reportedly, the victims' boat was traveling north on Grass Lake when the offending boat, traveling southbound, crossed over the lake body and sidesvviped the victims' boat. The accident happened at 11:15 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the Fourth of July. \"The boat stopped a little ways away and looked, and then took off again,\" said Govekar. \"Just like being in a car accident, you're sup- posed to stop and exchange infor- mation.\" The boat is described as a cabin motorboat with a red-colored hull. Govekar said, \"Paint samples were taken off the victims' boat and the crime lab can test the paint of a suspected boat to see if it matches. All paints are just a little different in make up.\" The marine unit of the Lake County Sheriffs Office asked that those with information about this, accident call Sgt. John Crilly at 847- 587-4470. campus of the area. \"Right now, some of this is being lost to Pleasant Prairie across the border and the county doesn't like this,\" she said. Mark Baker, of SEC Consultants, said, \"We want to solicit input from the public and the commission as to what you want to see in this corridor. We want everybody to take a sense of ownership in this plan.\" In short, plan commissioners concurred the \"do nots\" shown by way of photos throughout the pre- sentation were glaring and favored parkways, walkways, fewer curb cuts and keeping the small industrial development on the Route 83 corri- dor. Resident Kathleen Shay said her family has lived in Lake County since 1857. \"This plan is impoverished,\" she said. \"This will just be another obstacle course to get home. I don't see anything creative about this.\" Baker explained this study isn't just about land use, but about the \"visual experience\" of traveling from the tollway to downtown Antioch. Kretchmer added that some of the presentation was to show existing conditions and not the future of the area. Unclear this is the first of tliree phases of study, Shay complained the study wasn't conclusive. Trustee Scott Pierce, sitting in the audience said, \"We're trying to plan realistically for what's going to happen into the future. We're going to tie all of these corridor studies together. We have to know what's going on (currently) before we can plan,\" When the Route 173 corridor study is complete, the village will study the Route 83 corridor and finally Route 173 as it heads west toward Fox Lake and Spring Grove. Lindenhurst resident Victor Giampietro works on a puzzle he created with the help of his wife, Debbie. The puzzle, which depicts the Columbia space shuttle, was created by the Giampietro's to raise funds for NASA research.— Photo by Sandy Bressner Finding answers to tragedy in a puzzle By BRENDA BAUN-BEITSCHER Staff Reporter Lake Villa residents' Victor and Debbie Giampietro were so stunned by the devastating loss of the space shuttle Columbia last February that they literally went to pieces to find a meaningful way to help. Victor. Giampietro, owner of Argus Printing in Nilcs, decided to combine his printing talents, his wife's design talents and their love of jigsaw puzzles to do something con- structive irjjthe wake of destruction. :■- '\"I w^srariving to work when I heard ;auo'(ih it* on;, the radio,\" Giampietro said. \"I was stunned. I remember thinking, 'This can't hap- pen twice!'\" He remarked that, up until then, most people probably took the shut- tles for granted, \"almost like com- mercial flights.\" His sense of helplessness in the face of the tragedy led him to do some research on the shuttle. What he learned impressed him, and strengthened his determination to do something worthy of the sacri- fices made by the astronauts. \"Seven astronauts had 80 exper- iments to perform,\" he said. He decided to find a way to pay tribute to the shuttle and its crew as well as raise funds to support both the work that NASA was doing on that flight' as well as the families of the crewmembers. He also wanted to create something that would bring families together, \"instead of watching television or playing video games.\" His wife, Debbie, is a freelance designer. She got NASA's coopera- tion in obtaining a stunning photo- graph of the Columbia lifting off.

This was in addition to the role the department plays in ensuring residents' safety during the 5K run the parade and during the fireworks display. Chief Dennis Veiling said behind-the-scenes people help the department in its efforts. \"There are a lot of people who - are not in the forefront who really help things come together,\" he said. \"Billie Horton (special events coor- dinator) is one of those people. She works with everybody involved to see things are done properly.\" Each year, the department assists during the race by providing traffic control as well as staffing a mobile medical unit with trained emergency\" medical personnel and supplies an additional automatic external defibrillator to supplement what the Antioch Rescue Squad provides. Deputy Chief Leonard Sakaiowski, who heads the depart- ment's race involvement each year, said, \"We have been working close- ly with the State Bank of The Lakes (race sponsor), the Antioch Police Department and that Antioch Rescue Squad to provide a positive race experience for everyone.\" The fire department responded to numerous weather-related calls and the first of four auto accidents prior to the 10 a.m. parade time. A deck collapse on the Fourth of July at about 7 p.m. was the most serious of the weekend's calls.. Initial reports said two people were trapped under the collapse. Members of the department were met by the homeowner who said her husband and child were injured in the backyard. The deck collapsed under the weight of an inflatable pool filled with water, though neither was swimming at the time. Volling said, \"This was a very busy weekend for lis and our people met the challenge. Village dedicates tree in Lindblad's honor By JULIE MURPHY Staff Reporter For his dedication to the Village of Antioch, a tree is being dedicated in honor of Bob Lindblad at the William E. Brook Memorial Wetland Sanctuary on July 26 at 9 a.m. His name was synonymous with the Lakes Region Historical Society, a museum for the entire Chain O' Lakes area and not just Antioch, as preserving the local history was very important to him. He was a WWII veteran and very active in VFW Post 4551, always making sure there was at least one scholarship competition per year for Scouts with the themes typically being about patriotism. Additionally, Lindblad always helped with the Arbor Day festivi- ties. \"I miss seeing Bob Lindblad's face here,\" said Laurie Stahl, director of tfie parks department for the Village of Antioch at tills past Arbor Day event. \"He was always here helping out with the tree giveaway and whatever else he could do.\" She said an ' Autumn Blaze Maple tree has been planted at the front of the William E. Brook Memorial Wetland in his honor. \"We are v going to have a special dedication of that tree shortly,\" Stahl added. \"We thought it would be too difficult to do today because of the two.diffcrcnt locations.\" Trustee Dorothy Larson, chair of the parks committee, will read the dedication. Anyone wishing to attend the dedication ceremony is welcome to do so. The sanctuary is located on Orchard east of Route 83 behind the stores that line the east side of Main Street. \"He really was a wonderful man who always had the best interests of the village at heart,\" said Stahl.

The entire design was sent to a company that specializes in puzzle conversion. \"I learned about puzzles, too,\" said Giampietro, who assembles about four a year for his own amusement. \"The same die is used to cut all of them,\" he said. In theory, this means that one could take a piece from any puzzle, and place it in any other puzzle of the same size and number of pieces. Giampietro 's puzzle consists of 1,000 pieces. He is selling the puzzle for $14.95, with a minimum of $2 per puzzle going to either NASA's Office of biology and Physics Research or to a charity et up for the benefit of children oflheColifmbiacrew. He is also selling the puzzles at a discount- ed rate to the Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science and Industry (both in Chicago), so they can resell the puzzles to their patrons at the same $14.95 retail cost. Giampietro invested some $10,000 of his own money too get the project off the ground, and pay for the initial printing of 2,500 puzzles, as well as promotional costs. As he recoups his investment, he plans to increase the proportion of proceeds going to the charities. He does not plan to profit from the venture.

''I look forward to coming through the doors each day,\" she said. Musolino worked for various savings and loan offices prior to moving to the area and working for the State Bank of The Lakes. She has spent most of her time here working in customer service. Nearly 25 percent of State Bank of The Lakes' employees, that number more than 150, have worked for the bank upwards of 15 years. m Randy Miles (right) congratulates Helen Musolino at her 25th anniversary celebration.

Bob's Frame Shop in Lindenhurst donated the frame. LETTER TO THE EDITOR Haley was fired Tliis Idler is in response to John and Dee Reeves' letter criticizing me for my remarks about the Gring of Mike Haley village administrator. Let me be the first to admit that when Haley was hired as administrator I was his biggest skep- tic; however over the past two years he has proven to be one of the hardest working employ- ees of the village. He was hired to do die day-to- day running of the village and he did it well. The job of the mayor and board is to legislate, not be involved in every minute aspect of every depart- ment. That's what we have department heads for. I said what I believed and I stand by it; he was micro managed. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves asked where I was when the dolly Spiering money was diverted. A fair question. I was the trustee who made the motion that the Spiering money be put into a special account and be used only for expenses that relate to the Senior Center. I can assure you no one on that board had an inkling that the money was not where we instructed our administrator to put it A system of checks and balances has been put in place to hopefully prevent this from happening again. I never intended any of my comments as a slap in the face to village residents. Instead, I wanted to make sure both sides of the story were told and that the public knew that Haley's firing was just that, not a resignation.

It was the final sectional action for the long-time I.H.S.A. umpire.— Photo by Steve Young Life doesn't necessarily end after retire- ment, especially when someone finds a hobby they're good at. This is definitely true for Antioch resident Dick Kessler. Kessler worked in the engineer- ing division for much of his 42 years at Abbott Laboratories, retiring 11 years ago. About 30 years ago, Kessler became a game official for IHSA activities. It's some- thing he continues to do today, even after retire- ment. \"Most of it for me is being around the kids and the coaches I've met over the years,\" Kessler said from his home in Antioch. \"It's also given me the chance to stay active.\" And Kessler has been very active, officiating numerous high school and college games over the years. Kessler has been a game official in football, volleyball, basketball, baseball and softball, choosing to devote most of his attention to softball. But he actually got his start working Little League games. \"I was very active in little league up here in Antioch and the umpire who worked the games didn't want to do it anymore,\" Kessler said. \"I stepped in and did about five or six games.\" From there, Kessler worked his way into the high school ranks, joining the Northern Tve made a lot of friendships over tlie years with many of the coaches* Sometimes you run across coaches thatarertt necessarily umpire lovers, but Vve met a lot of great people* Long time Umpire Dick Kessler Officials Association for additional training. He eventually became the head umpire for the 1979 softball state finals in Pekin. At one point though, Kessler got stuck In a situation that most Would rather not be in. \"My youngest daughter played softball,\" he said. \"I showed up to umpire one of her games and I had no idea she was going to be pitching. She was only a freshman at the time. They ended up winning though and I tried to be as fair as possible.\" Kessler was also very active in the college ranks until knee problems forced him out in the early 90s. He worked the Division-Ill softball World Series in Grand Rapids, Mich., and also worked for many of the local colleges around the north suburbs and south- em Wisconsin. That blossomed into working softball games at the mid-major level and even games for the Big Ten. Kessler continues to work at the high school level, and he's enjoy- ing every minute of it. \"There's a lot of camaraderie with umpires,\" Kessler said. \"I've had people who are 35-years-old come up to me and say 'hi Mr. Kessler.' \"I've made a lot of friendships over the years with many of the coaches. Sometimes you run across coaches that aren't necessarily umpire lovers, but I've met a lot of great peo- ple. \"It's been a very satisfying hobby.\" Seqtxoit summer baseball looks to muster up its own song By JOHN PHELPSI' Sports Editor • It's kind of two-fold. Of course, players Jn summer league baseball want to win. But it's also time for respective high school coaches to evaluate, or re-evaluate their team all in preparation for next spring. -;, Antioch head coach Paul Petty and his Sequoits lost key players to graduation this year. The result, the team struggled to a 9-win season. Time to start over and get back to the basics, according to the coach. \"We're just trying to make a few marks in the sand,\" said Petty after Antioch fell to host Grayslake 7-6 in summer league action. The Illinois High School Baseball Coaches Association post-season dance starts next week. The Sequoits, seeded ninth, will open play at home on Mon., July 21 against Vernon Hills. Game time is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. \"The summer is basically a time to exper- iment with different signs and different situa- tions,\" Petty continued. \"It's a big learning curve, so to speak. But we're playing'better. We just need to learn to win some of these close games.\" Now Grayslake, on the other hand, is Carmel summer baseball finds groove By ROB BACKUS Lakeland Correspondent With just a week left before the start of post-season play, Carmel's summer baseball team appears to be hitting its stride at exactly the right time. After starting the summer season 1-7, the Corsairs have won nine of their last 12 games, includ- ing wins over Buffalo Grove and Wheeling. Against Buffalo Grove, the game went into extra innings where Carmel pre- vailed .5-4 on a game-win- ning hit from John Bailgeron than scored Jim Robin. Sophomore Tim Johnson pitched well for the Corsairs. I \"It was a very competi- tive summer league game that was pitched well by both teams,\" Carmel coach Chuck Gandolfi said. Against Wheeling, Bryan Dovtci, Mike •O'Leary, Alan Thain, Joe Gaza and Ryan Dunn combined for a shutout at the Corsairs topped Wheeling 7-0. You need both success and failure to evaluate your players and this is my first experience with a lot of tf tern\" Carmel Head Coach Chuck Gandolfi on summer baseball Thain, Dunn and O'Leary all had key hits for Carmel (10-10). \"We played pretty good defense, the pitchers threw strikes and a lot of kids got to play,\" Gandolfi said. According to Gandolfi, playing a tot of kids is the key to the summer schedule. *We certainly care about winning over the summer, but the real key is development for next* sea- son. Carmel will now gear up to host the Illinois High School Baseball Coaches Association tournament, which runs from July 21-24. The Corsairs will take on Round Lake on July 21 at 5 p.m. Whatever happens in the tournament, Gandolfi is still pleased with his team's results this summer. s \"It's been an excellent summer,\" Gandolfi said. \"I've seen what I needed to see; I've seen what the kids can and can't do. \"You need both success and failure to evaluate your players and this is my first expe- rience with a lot of them.\" Antioch's Chad Ori delivers the heater during summer baseball action at Grayslake. The Rams prevailed over the Sequoit.7-6. — Photo by Steve Young pretty experienced in those close games. The Rams are 10-7 this summer. All of those games but two, the Rams have been in. One guy helping lead the resurgence of Grayslake baseball is senior-to-be shortstop Kevin Biederer, The 2003 All-Fox Valley selec- tion has quite a formula for his succes, espe- cially when it comes to batting. , \"It gets me in the rhythm. I flow to it,\" said Biederer, who replays the remix, to the song Ignition by Art Kelly in his mind before step- ping to the plate. \"It seems to work, whether I get the green light or bunt.\" In Biedercr's case against Antioch, it was tlie latter. With die game knotted at 6-6 in the bottom of the seventh, second baseman Kellen Sams led off with a walk. Biederer then laid down a perfect bunt down tlie first-base line. Two batters later, starting pitcher Nolan Jones smacked an infield single that led to Biederer racing around third to score the win- ning run. This after Antioch put a 3-spot on the board to take a 6-4 lead in the top of the sixth. In that Inning for Antioch, Ryan Thamerus doubled home Nate Hughes (single) for the first run. Joe Romani then singled home Kevin Propeck, who earlier walked. Thamerus then trotted home on a sacrifice fly by Justin Weis. \"I'm just really proud of die guys and the way they hung in there,\" said Grayslake skip- per Troy Whalen. \"They're learning how to win the close games. They're also communicating better out there.\" Grayslake had not learned their first- round assignment in the IHSBCA post-season tourney as of Wed. Chances are, though, they will get a home game on July 21, just like Antioch has. The Rams' Adam BuUer pitched the last two-third's inning for the win. Starter Nolan Jones looked good up to that point, allowing just seven hits while fanning five before he was relieved in the seventh with the game tied and Antioch threatening. \"It's all in our approach. Coach Whalen has us thinking a lot more positive, and trying to keep our heads in every play,\" added Biederer. Matt CaJidine smacked two singles, while Propeck added a double of his own for the Sequoits, Jones and Aaron Hall each finished with two singles while Butler had a single and dou- ble to lead the Rams at the plate. Junior-to-be Josh Damdre also doubled. Lead-off hitter Bobby Truckenbrod also got in to the act. Truckenbrod's speed yeilded him a single and two stolen bases on the day. But it was Jones and the Biederer 'chime' that had the last dance on this day.

There, paraplegic Dehiu^Walter treated everyone to a special, as-well as moving golf demonstration. It was all part of WesterjSgJunior Golf Clinic, co-sponsored by Upper Deck Trading Company. Just one of the perks, if you will, for a youth, and aspiring golfer, that is a part of The First Tee of Northeastern fllinbis Junior Golf Association. ^^Jafe to say, NEIJGA President Don Wegrzyn was pleased with the turnout. \"I was very happy with the interest. Our kids represented at least half of the youths that were in attendance,\" said Wegrzyn, also a PGA Master Golf Professional. \"The clinic was great. One of the things they learned from Dennis Walter was how he parks his cart in the direction of where he wants to hit the ball. They also learned a lot by seeing how much the pro's prac- tice, especially on chipping and putting. And theyjook an interest in walking the j course, to watch the action. It gave them a chancelopractice some of thelife L , skills they learn through The First Tee. Overall.tit was nice to see the interest from the kids.\" tBI^ ' - M Life skills and golf?

The Life Skilte portion of HTje First Tee focuses on areas such as honesty, integrity, sportsmanship, courtesy, respect, judgment and confidence. Alexandra Lucas, a 13-year-old soon-to-be eighth-grader at Abbott School in Waukegan, has been involved with The First Tee since its • inception in these parts five.years ago. Lucas, one of The First Tee's leaders on the Junior Advisory Committee, was part of the caravan 'that made the trek down to Lemont. \"it's was really cool. To see (Dennis . Waiter) hit the ball like he does, seeing that he can't walk or stand, was incredi- ble,\" said Lucas, who regularly practices looking one in the eye while sporting a . firm handshake. That happens to be one of the little tid-bits involved with the Life Skills. \"I think, though, the biggest messag he (Walters) had to say was if you per- severe and stick with what you love doing, you can accomplish anything.\" Regarding her involvement with - ;.' The First Tee, Lucas said she likes working with the kids, helping them* learn and grow. Not only was Wegrzyn happy/with ' the turnout of First Tee youths at the: Western, he's happy with the interest overall in the program. \"Our return ratio is about'25 per- cent for advanced students, 40 per- cent for girls returning and that's climbing, and between 35-40 percent overall of students returning for anoth- er year,\" he said. \"This year, we have about 178 new students.

As baby-boomers we were hep to this place. It still had waitresses on roller skates, '50s music, and homemade root beer that you could buy by the gallon. In Tact, most of the folks who pulled up here were our age or older. Maybe that's why the only romance we saw was between a Chihuahua in a Honda and a Golden Retriever in the back of a Jeep. If I weren't so afraid of needing a hip replacement, I'd try serving meals this way at i home. I'd tine the kids up at the kitchen counter, then gracefully inline skate my way through their endless requests — eliciting appreciative applause with my deft pirou- ettes from range, to microwave, to fridge. The only thing missing at the end of my mealtime performance would be flowers — or a tip. Speaking of tips, be sure to set aside plenty of time to explore the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Airventure Museum in Oshkosh. Airventure, the world's largest aviation event, is scheduled for July 29 to August 4 this year. We started off our visit with the muse- um's orientation video. The video itself was an eye opener— literally. It consisted of heart pounding close-ups of the various stunt fliers at die air show, right down to their agonized facial contortions as they subjected them- selves to punishing gravitational forces— kind of like me when I bend over and try to tight- en up my jowls before they hit the ground. The kids loved exploring interactive exhibits explaining everything from the beginning of flight to the state-of-the-art F-22 Raptor airplane. Their favorite hands-on experience was actually taking the throttle as a \"Young Eagles\" co-pilot. So, I sat for more than an hour on a run- way bench in the hot sun while my \"angels\" were up in the wild blue yonder spilling their guts to a grandfatherly pilot. \"Boy, those trees look just like broccoli. My mom makes us eat broccoli, but she just eats junk food!\" You get the idea. I was left to study a Young Eagles fact sheet. \"There are four forces that affect an airplane in (light: Lift, Gravity, Thrust, and Leslie Glazier-Werner Drag.\" It kind of summed up our road trip thus far. My personal \"Wolfman Jack\" was off Lifting more travel brochures to reduce the ' threat of downtime. I've said all I care to about Gravity. Thekids would soon be Thrust back into my sagging upper armj. And we had one more night before our jjeat- nik bunch would Drag into Door County, ripe for action. . .and a shower.
