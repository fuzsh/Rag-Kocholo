        "text": "In your classes, you will discuss politics in local, national and international contexts and explore the ways in which politics influences society. You’ll have the flexibility to design a program based on your interests and that complements your major. You can choose from courses that focus on international relations, political communication, public opinion and presidential politics. You’re also free to experience the political arena firsthand through an internship with the Connecticut Legislature in Hartford or a local campaign. Working at a media outlet, you’ll learn about political journalism. Whatever your career ambitions, a basic foundation in political science will be an effective launching pad."
