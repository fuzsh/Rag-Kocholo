        "meta_description": "Chondrosarcoma is a malignant primary bone tumor that responds poorly to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of alendronate, a bisphosphonate, on the invasion and migration of human chondrosarcoma cells (JJ012). JJ012 cells were treated with alendronate of various concentrations up to 100 μmol/L for a specified period, and then gelatin zymography and matrigel invasion assay was performed to study the effects of alendronate on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 activity and the invasion ability of JJ012 cells, respectively. Our data showed that alendronate exerted a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the invasion and migration of JJ012 cells. Furthermore, gelatin zymography and RT-PCR showed that alendronate treatment decreased the activity and mRNA levels of MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that alendronate may reduce MMP-2 secretion at the transcriptional and translational levels, and inhibit the invasion of chondrosarcoma cell. Therefore, alendronate may be a potential candidate for the systemic therapy of chondro-sarcomas, as well as other malignant diseases.",
