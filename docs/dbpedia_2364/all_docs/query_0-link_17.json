We initially opened a business in 2010 (under another name in the same retail location) with a focus on supporting independent artists from our immediate region, and by 2015 when we became Altar, we had grown that vision into the beautifully curated and ever-changing space it is today. We celebrate independent manufacturers and artists from across North America, with a focus on the stories that are woven into their work. We use the phrase, “objects with meaning” because we believe in sharing the unique stories behind these pieces.\n\nOur clothing brand, Altar Houseline, is proudly made in America using deadstock materials and serves size gradations from size small to 6XL.\n\nCassie Ridgway opened her shop in 2010 with less than $3000 in the bank and a night job. Owning and operating this small business has been defined by labor of love and perseverance. Cassie's passion for sustainably produced and ethically manufactured apparel was a driving force, and has kept her laser focused on making this company better by the year. Her aesthetic sensibilities are always sort of changing (ok, sometimes all over the place), but she has always consistently been inspired by desert color-stories, moody floral motifs, art deco filigrees, and modern art.\n\nfashion sustainability textile reuse\n\nAnne Williams of Atelier Douce France\n\nwww.adfupholstery.com\n\nAnne Williams was born and raised in Normandy, France where she began to learn traditional upholstery at the young age of 15.

Once in the tech industry as a linguistic specialist, she left her day job to pursue a creative career. While she mainly knits, crochet, macramé and weaving are also part of her everyday life.\n\nShe started BlackSheepMade as a way to fund an internship abroad while in college, but since 2014 it has evolved into large public installations, long-term pop-ups and traveling workshops. You can find her latest mural in her hometown of San Jose, California at The Berryessa Flea. She wove a 15 x 8–foot (4.5x 2.5–m) mural with her dad, Francisco, as an homage to her late abuelita and hometown culture.\n\nIn 2018, she ran a two-month long pop-up in downtown Portland via a city-funded program. She was able to test out her idea of a “deli for knits”: choose a style of beanie or scarf, pick your colors and she’ll knit it up in a week. In 2019, Travel Portland and My People’s Market brought Alyssarhaye to Japan to discuss life as an entrepreneur and teach a macrame workshop. In January of 2020, Alyssarhaye published her first DIY knitting book, Chunky Knits: Cozy Hats, Scarves and More Made Simple with Extra-Large Yarn.\n\nToday, she continues her art career as a designer for various fiber brands and local businesses and she teaches fiber workshops in both English and Spanish.

Why? Well, we wanted good looking clothes, ethically made, that would show the world we believed animals deserved respect, love, and to be free from harm. We wanted to spread the word about living cruelty-free.\n\nWe spent a few years in spare bedrooms in Portland, shipping our clothing all over the world before we took the leap to open our first little store. And by little, I mean one lap around without missing anything took about 40 seconds. We stocked our ever-expanding clothing line alongside an ever-expanding line of vegan cookbooks. We filled the rest of the store with cruelty-free belts, bags, and wallets.\n\nThen, in 2007, we got together with Lisa, the founder of Sweetpea Baking Company, Chad and Emiko of Food Fight! Vegan Grocery, and Brian and John of Scapegoat Tattoo, and we moved down to SE 12th and Stark Streets. The Vegan Mini-Mall was born. It started as a joke, but the name stuck.\n\nA lot has changed over the years, but the core belief and drive behind the vegan mini-mall hasn't. Basically, ethical veganism is awesome, you can be one, too! All while eating a donut with one hand, sipping a soy latte with the other, wearing ethically made, fashionable clothing as you wait for your tattoo appointment to begin in a shop that uses vegan ink and supplies.\n\nAs for Herbivore, we have spent all these years designing rad clothing, as well as manufacturing belts and wallets. We have hosted countless events, co-founded an animal rights conference, and spoken at vegfests. We've published some books. We've travelled the country tabling at events. We've donated our time at sanctuaries, and donated our skills to lots of organizations in the form of pro-bono design work. We have raised lots and lots of money for animal rights organizations and sanctuaries, as well as other social justice movements.\n\nWe believe these movements are linked and the oppression of one is the oppression of us all. We believe in animal liberation and human liberation are the same cause, so we fight for both.\n\nOur approach has always been to show veganism as a positive choice that gives you back so much more than you give up.

Embroidery, or tatreez (تطريز), is a centuries-old practice preserved through intergenerational exchange over a cup of tea, or shay (شاي). Inspired by generations of fiber artists, The Tatreez Institute continues the rich traditions of embroidery, textile and storytelling of Palestine, the Palestinian diaspora and Greater Syria from the United States.\n\nIn 2022, The Tatreez Institute was established to expand the scope of Wafa’s research into regional costumes beyond Palestine, produce more publications, as well as ensure that her documentation efforts can secure funding to continue. The Tatreez Institute was incorporated on her son’s fifth birthday, a meaningful symbol to Wafa that reminds her of the intergenerational impact of her work for Palestinians living in the diaspora.\n\nThe Tatreez Institute is founded in the belief that the study of embroidery and textiles in Palestine and Greater Syria cannot be divorced from its historical context. Anyone interested in joining the Tatreez & Tea community must stand unequivocally against the appropriation of arts and culture, for Palestinian liberation, and fight against the oppression of marginalized and oppressed communities equally. Individuals that are not able to meet this criteria must first build their activism and alliance, prior to joining the Tatreez & Tea community. The Tatreez Institute is not a service to the culturally curious— it is an active agent in fighting for Palestinian liberation. Therefore, The Tatreez Institute works to build an informed ally movement that stands against oppression, appropriation, and erasure — not just for Palestinians — but for all indigenous, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities facing the same.\n\nSchools\n\nAssembly | Gather + Create\n\nwww.assemblycreate.com\n\nSince 2016, Liz Wright has been bringing people together to learn new skills in a fun social environment, both in-person and online, with Assembly.

Prior to COVID-19, youth workshops and programs were at the core of the organization.Through a series of hands-on workshops in schools, prisons, and community centers across the country, SJSA used social justice and art education to bridge artistic expression with activism. Many of our young artists made art that explored issues such as gender discrimination, mass incarceration, gun violence, and gentrification. The powerful imagery that youth created in cloth demonstrated their critique of issues plaguing their local and larger communities. These quilt blocks are then sent to volunteers around the world to embellish and embroider before being sewn together into quilts to be displayed in museums, galleries, and quilt shows across the country.\n\nWhile youth programming remains at the heart of SJSA, the civil rights movement of 2020 and the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted SJSA’s programming. Due to no longer being able to provide in-person programming and limited virtual youth workshops, SJSA launched a series of new initiatives to critically respond to the times. With each project, SJSA bridges the differences between age, race,and socioeconomic status to facilitate conversations about and encourage action toward social justice issues in households across the country.\n\ncommunity social justice textile art\n\nVariegated Places\n\nwww.variegatedplaces.com\n\nCydni Carter Lopez is a place-based artist and designer based in SE Portland.

Trained in architecture and graphical textile design she felt in love with textile arts in 2004. Since 2008 she runs her own textile art studio, creating wall-hangings, sculptures, home decor, wearable art and accessories. In her work she combines graphical design and several textile techniques to make outstanding pieces in a fancy and playful style. She paints with powerful colored fibers and creates little stories in a poetic and humorous way. Each item is unique: created by hand, in a time-consuming and artistic process. In each piece Ariane Mariane explores new techniques, association of colors and materials. She describes her process as involuntary, deconstructed and messy. \"My workshop is filled up with fabrics, wool fibers, pigments, papers and findings of all kind. It’s my kingdom from where I travel to imaginary countries, enjoy great adventures and often come back with marvelous treasuries. My best creations \"just happen or as Picasso pointed out:\"Inspiration exists but it must find you working.\"” In Ariane Mariane’s world, clothes and accessories stand side by side to wall hangings and sculptures. \"I do not see any difference in making a garment or a picture,\" she explains. \"My approach is always graphical and somehow storytelling: a combination of colors, shapes and materials. In the beginning“ making art for art seemed pretentious to me and I needed a function to authorize myself to create. Nowadays I play around with both. I may even feel freer when doing wall hangings and sculptures. On the other hand it’s so exciting to see a creation transformed by another human. I love the sparkling eyes when a woman tries out an art vest, a hat or accessory. Something’s happening –the art work and the woman are transformed.” The artist’s goal?
