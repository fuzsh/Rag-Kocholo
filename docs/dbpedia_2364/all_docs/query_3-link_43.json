        "text": "The Mineola, New York, native is super active — with a variety of internships, campus leadership roles, freelance jobs and other career opportunities. Her skillsets vary in social media, music and sports.\n\nAfter visiting the Ben and Jerry’s headquarters in Vermont with her mother and observing the tour guides, Moglia’s sweet, childhood memory became the pinnacle of guiding her into what she wanted to do with her career.\n\n“When I was growing up, I never had a straight answer of ‘what do you want to be when you grow up,’” Moglia said. “Then around middle school after going on that tour, I remember my answer changed. I just want to do something that helps people. I want to be doing something where I have an impact on people’s lives and do something bigger than myself.”\n\nCurrently, Moglia is a representative for Universal Music Group’s (UMG) °1824, a creative solutions team where 18 to 24-year-olds work to promote artists and brands through content creation, ideation, PR, A&R, creator partnerships, experiences and digital marketing. She is also a publicity intern for Big Picture Media and a part-time short-form content creator for Hockey of Tomorrow.\n\n“I don’t think just one of us can win,” Moglia said. “I’m not interested in competing with anybody I want everyone in my circle to win. I want everyone I know at Quinnipiac to go and get great jobs and be successful. I want everybody to have success and °1824 is a great environment for that, so I absolutely love it.”\n\nAt a young age, Moglia already started using Twitter and Instagram. She would create fan accounts for artists and bands like Taylor Swift and One Direction. From then on, she knew she was interested in fan engagement and content creation.\n\nDuring her first year of high school, she was introduced to sports journalism. Fast forward to her high school senior year, she created social media content for the Premier Hockey Federation. Ever since she’s written and created digital content for various sports media companies.\n\nCurrently, she is a short-form content writer for Hockey of Tomorrow, a media organization powered by pro hockey players that advocates for positive cultural and societal progression within hockey. She is also currently serving as the vice president for Quinnipiac’s Association for Women in Sports Media (AWSM).\n\nAccording to Moglia, she and the executive board have been able to revive AWSM after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. She invited guest speakers to speak to the organization who’s worked in the WWE, NHL and MLB. The organization has also hosted bonding events such as dining events or attending games.\n\nThis year, Moglia and a general member attended a Connecticut Whale game, a women's ice hockey league game, where they received press passes to ask questions at the press conference and interview players. Moglia says attending and covering the game was a valuable experience.\n\n“It was just a really awesome experience,” she said. “The Association for Women in Sports Media is really important to me because being a woman in the sports field, you are in a male-dominated space, no matter how you slice it. It’s definitely changing and improving, but we're not at all where we need to be with that. Just having that outlet is different from other sports-related groups on campus because there are no really covering games. There's not a show we put out every week, instead it's just about community, bonding, networking and support, and just being there for each other. When you can walk into a room and see people who look like you and have been through similar experiences as you and they can say, ‘I get it,’ that's something that's just really, really powerful.”\n\nSince that day, Moglia has been advocating for gender equality in sports media and all professional industries. As a gender study minor and advocate for women and the LGBTQ+ community, she wants to continue to use her voice and talents for a greater impact.\n\n“It's just really important to me, based on my experiences, to just make sure people know that your gender identity or your sexuality is never going to stop you from accomplishing what you want to accomplish,” Moglia said. “When you grow up as a woman who struggles with anxiety, who identifies as queer, I've got a whole laundry list of reasons why people would discriminate against me. When you're able to find your voice and do what you love to do, it is just so liberating and amazing.”\n\nMoglia says Quinnipiac has helped support her path and pursuit of opportunities in media. Within her first month of attending Quinnipiac, she covered multiple sports games and now has a full portfolio of sports coverage, she said. As the WQAQ programming manager, she has developed partnerships with local music venues as well as interviewed various musical artists on her radio show. She is grateful for the hands-on experience and support she received within the past two years.\n\n“The School of Communications in particular is just such a welcoming environment,” she said. “All of the professors are so sweet and pretty much every professor I've had, you can tell that they genuinely care about you and they genuinely want to see you succeed. The number of professors whose phone numbers and emails I have who I reach out to when I have a question, even if I don't currently have a class with them, and they'll respond and offer to meet with me or give me advice. That's something that's really important. Dean Roush does a really good job of cultivating that community and making sure that the professors and the deans don't feel so high and mighty to us, they feel very accessible.”\n\nMoglia aspires to work in a digital marketing, content creation or social media role within public relations or marketing. Her dream is to work for the WWE or ESPN music departments, where she can combine her passions of music and sports.\n\nShe encourages all Quinnipiac students to get involved in some capacity to build experience and a network.\n\n“Don’t be afraid to shoot your shot. Don’t be afraid to get involved,” Moglia said. “Pick a couple of organizations that you really want to work on and just go for those things and go for them in as big of a way as you can. A song lyric that’s my philosophy for how I live is, ‘I want to be all the way and unafraid to be,’ and that’s really important to me. That sort of mantra is really true about getting involved at any college, but specifically at Quinnipiac. If you are all the way fully your true self, you can’t go wrong. There’s going to be people who don’t like it and there’s going to be people who love you and see you for who you are and who want to work with you, hire you and help you reach that potential. You have to be fearless about it. What you get out of Quinnipiac is what you put into it. Go for it all the way and unafraid.”"
