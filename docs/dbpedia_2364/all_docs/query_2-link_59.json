However, Werder Bremen required extra time before winning 3-2 away to fifth-tier opposition in Illertissen.\n\nDortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also progressed this weekend, but top-flight sides Mainz and VfB Stuttgart fell by the wayside.\n\nSelected German Cup first round results on Sunday:\n\nIllertissen 2 Werder Bremen 3 - after extra-time\n\nPaloma 0 Hoffenheim 9\n\nPreussen Münster 1 Bayern Munich 4\n\nEintracht Trier 0 Freiburg 2\n\nRB Leipzig 2 Paderborn 1 - after extra-time\n\nMagdeburg 1 Augsburg 0\n\nSaturday’s results\n\nBochum 0 Stuttgart 2\n\nStuttgarter Kickers 1 Borussia Dortmund 4\n\nHomburg 1 Borussia Moenchengladbach 3\n\nViktoria Cologne 2 Hertha Berlin 4\n\nFT Braunschweig 0 Cologne 4\n\nAstoria Walldorf 1 Hanover 3\n\nViktoria 89 Berlin 0 Eintracht Frankfurt 2\n\nFriday’s results\n\nAlemania Waldalgesheim 0 Bayer Leverkusen 6\n\nChemnitzer 5 Mainz 5\n\nChemnitzer win 5-4 on penalties\n\nFollow our sports coverage on twitter at @SprtNationalUAE\n\nThe biog\n\nFavourite book: Animal Farm by George Orwell\n\nFavourite music: Classical\n\nHobbies: Reading and writing\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4\n\nDirector: Chad Stahelski\n\nStars: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, George Georgiou\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nCompany Profile\n\nCompany name: Namara\n\nStarted: June 2022\n\nFounder: Mohammed Alnamara\n\nBased: Dubai\n\nSector: Microfinance\n\nCurrent number of staff: 16\n\nInvestment stage: Series A\n\nInvestors: Family offices\n\nCOMPANY PROFILE\n\nCompany name: Revibe\n\nStarted: 2022\n\nFounders: Hamza Iraqui and Abdessamad Ben Zakour\n\nBased: UAE\n\nIndustry: Refurbished electronics\n\nFunds raised so far: $10m\n\nInvestors: Flat6Labs, Resonance and various others\n\nROUTE TO TITLE\n\nRound 1: Beat Leolia Jeanjean 6-1, 6-2\n\nRound 2: Beat Naomi Osaka 7-6, 1-6, 7-5\n\nRound 3: Beat Marie Bouzkova 6-4, 6-2\n\nRound 4: Beat Anastasia Potapova 6-0, 6-0\n\nQuarter-final: Beat Marketa Vondrousova 6-0, 6-2\n\nSemi-final: Beat Coco Gauff 6-2, 6-4\n\nFinal: Beat Jasmine Paolini 6-2, 6-2\n\nThe Specs\n\nEngine: 1.6-litre 4-cylinder petrol\n\nPower: 118hp\n\nTorque: 149Nm\n\nTransmission: Six-speed automatic\n\nPrice: From Dh61,500\n\nOn sale: Now\n\nAuron Mein Kahan Dum Tha\n\nStarring: Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Shantanu Maheshwari, Jimmy Shergill, Saiee Manjrekar\n\nDirector: Neeraj Pandey\n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nCOMPANY PROFILE\n\nName: SmartCrowd\n\nStarted: 2018\n\nFounder: Siddiq Farid and Musfique Ahmed\n\nBased: Dubai\n\nSector: FinTech / PropTech\n\nInitial investment: $650,000\n\nCurrent number of staff: 35\n\nInvestment stage: Series A\n\nInvestors: Various institutional investors and notable angel investors (500 MENA, Shurooq, Mada, Seedstar, Tricap)\n\nTRAP\n\nStarring: Josh Hartnett, Saleka Shyamalan, Ariel Donaghue\n\nDirector: M Night Shyamalan\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nBORDERLANDS\n\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis\n\nDirector: Eli Roth\n\nRating: 0/5\n\nPathaan\n\nDirector: Siddharth Anand\n\nStars: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, John Abraham\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nWHAT MACRO FACTORS ARE IMPACTING META TECH MARKETS?\n\n• Looming global slowdown and recession in key economies\n\n• Russia-Ukraine war\n\n• Interest rate hikes and the rising cost of debt servicing\n\n• Oil price volatility\n\n• Persisting inflationary pressures\n\n• Exchange rate fluctuations\n\n• Shortage of labour/skills\n\n• A resurgence of Covid?\n\nBiog\n\nMr Kandhari is legally authorised to conduct marriages in the gurdwara\n\nHe has officiated weddings of Sikhs and people of different faiths from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Russia, the US and Canada\n\nFather of two sons, grandfather of six\n\nPlays golf once a week\n\nEnjoys trying new holiday destinations with his wife and family\n\nWalks for an hour every morning\n\nCompleted a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Loyola College, Chennai, India\n\n2019 is a milestone because he completes 50 years in business\n\nHAJJAN\n\nDirector: Abu Bakr Shawky\n\nStarring: Omar Alatawi, Tulin Essam, Ibrahim Al-Hasawi\n\nRating: 4/5\n\n'Saand Ki Aankh'\n\nProduced by: Reliance Entertainment with Chalk and Cheese Films\n\nDirector: Tushar Hiranandani\n\nCast: Taapsee Pannu, Bhumi Pednekar, Prakash Jha, Vineet Singh\n\nRating: 3.5/5 stars\n\nDEADPOOL & WOLVERINE\n\nStarring: Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin\n\nDirector: Shawn Levy\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nCompany Profile\n\nName: HyveGeo\n\nStarted: 2023\n\nFounders: Abdulaziz bin Redha, Dr Samsurin Welch, Eva Morales and Dr Harjit Singh\n\nBased: Cambridge and Dubai\n\nNumber of employees: 8\n\nIndustry: Sustainability & Environment\n\nFunding: $200,000 plus undisclosed grant\n\nInvestors: Venture capital and government\n\n2018 ICC World Twenty20 Asian Western Sub Regional Qualifier\n\nEvent info: The tournament in Kuwait this month is the first phase of the qualifying process for sides from Asia for the 2020 World T20 in Australia.

It offers a more personalised approach to opening and operating an account on their platform,” he says.\n\nFinally, StashAway could work for those who want a hands-off approach to their investing. “It removes one of the biggest challenges for novice traders: picking the securities in their portfolio,” Mr Nair says. “A goal-based approach or view towards investing can help motivate residents who may usually shy away from investment platforms.”\n\n'Gold'\n\nDirector:Anthony Hayes\n\nStars:Zaf Efron, Anthony Hayes\n\nRating:3/5"
