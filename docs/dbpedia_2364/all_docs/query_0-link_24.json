These two mediums have comingled and now evolve and effect the other. Art has changed to reflect the vast improvements technology has contributed to communication and the ability to create using digital space. Technology has also changed with artist pushing the boundaries of what is technical possible in the digital realm. Much of today's art is created and presented in digital formats. The question of whether digital art is truly art has risen among many critics in the art community. Computer art usually refers to any form of graphic art or digital imagery that was created with the aid of a computer. Computer art which curators today call digital art or new media art started to emerge in the 1950 and focused mainly on geometric shapes in random combinations. Many critics at the time questioned whether computer art could in fact be called art. Critics wondered whether computer art could still convey concepts of \"meaning\", \"expression\", and \"form\". Early computer was much different from the computers we know today. Artist were not interested in computers for art in their earliest designs. The earliest computers did not have monitors and were massive machines that filled large rooms. An example of such a computer, the ENAIC that was developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1940s was the most powerful computer at the ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n3. Digital Media And Video Art And New Media Art Pop culture and art have always intertwined, as art often reflect the culture and time of that period. Now in this tech savvy culture of the 21st century, artists are trying to explain this weird new era of technology seeping into our everyday lives, through video art and screen based media. There is no doubt that the Internet has transformed our everyday lives, with useful apps, online banking and social media, the world is not the same as it was 10 years ago. Future generations, wont even remember a time without the Internet or touch screen devices. This type of new Internet culture opens and changes the social dynamic and conventions, into a new language. For artists this opens up a new platform to create, explore and to exhibit their work in a new space. Social media, allows people to connect and to distribute content from all over the world, making it ever so easy to access anything now. However, for the art world this raises questions as to who owns or curates content and whether new media art that has emerged due to advancement of technology is considered fine art? To understand this new wave of art, we first must define what is new media art is. New media art and video art have very similar backgrounds and parallels. Video art emerged during the 1960's, due to the introduction of portable cameras, which allowed everyday people to create their own content.

Information And Communication Technologies And The Present... Abstract: This paper examines information and communication technologies and the present media background. The characterizations of media culture are then explored from the insight of new generation, and the relations between them and ICT are investigated. The dominant educational logic with regard to ICT is outlined, and different forms of the digital divide are presented. Some global aspects of ICT use among new generation are reviewed, using both primary and secondary sources. New forms of modern generation socialization brought about by the coming out of ICT are examined, and the concluded with a set of recommendations.

Regardless of the vast multiplicity in living environments, an exceptional and unifying global media culture has developed that challenges and often places of interest such traditional forms of socialization as family and school. This versatile cultural circumstances in which new generation are under pressure to find route in their lives or simply to survive, to improve their living conditions, and to develop their identities has been given various names. Some call it the information or informational age, while others prefer the term techno traditions or techno entrepreneurship, global media culture, or simply globalization, referring to the dialectic procedure in which the global and the local exist as \"combined and mutually implicating principles\".(1) Labels such as post–industrial, virtual and cyber society are also in use.(2) The idea behind all these terms is that across the globe, ICT are playing a central role in young people's lives and in society at large. Two major assumptions underlie the role of ICT: the first is that the propagation of these technologies is causing rapid transformations in all areas of life; the second is that ICT function to unify and standardize culture. It is on the basis of these assumptions that the term \"media culture\", incorporating the phenomena of informationalism (3) and globalization, This is about bridging the digital divide, it is therefore important to recall that ICT carry a \"cultural package\" of ...

New Media Art With Its Intrinsic Characteristics Crowdsourced Documentation New media art with its intrinsic characteristics (instability and variability)[1] poses complex challenges in documentation, this observation is not new, and initiatives such as DOCAM[2] and Variable Media Network[3] have provided methods and tools to properly document media artworks. Nevertheless, the social phenomena of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, presents new challenges for established documentation methods and standards. This essay aims to address this subject by referencing recent exhibition and art practice frequently involve public participation and interaction, taking an in–depth look at current theoretical, practical, and institutional documentation model, examining crowdsourced documentation as a valid source created by various contributors, can be incorporated as part of formal documentation.

Community Digital Art Many artists around the world work with a canvas, on paper, and many other ways of drawing, even since computers and technology became mainstream artist have also started using the digital world as their canvas. I started digital art when I first started on the computer and I've been hooked ever since. Digital art is a great way of drawing without making a mess on your desk, it's all accomplished in files and programs on your computer. In the beginning there wasn't really any programs that allowed you to freely draw what you wanted. When Windows XP first came out, many creative minds started to realize there was a program called \"Paint\" on their desktop. Paint wasn't a very cutting–edge program but it was advanced for its time and many digital artists started with it.

Participatory Culture Through The Media Old media like broadcasting, print, and film created a consumer culture in the public. Participants would consume the media they could find, and that was the extent of their engagement with a piece of media. But during the digital age, participatory culture has exploded. Participatory culture is a concept coined by Henry Jenkins where consumers take part in both the consumption and the production of media. The advent of computers facilitates a low barrier of entry for creation of digital media and its propagation. With the availability of personal computers and consumer level software to manipulate media as well as the popularity of the internet to spread content, fans have become more engaged with the media they consume. In turn, participants can create forms of that media that comment and expand upon the original content. Participants who used to only consume media now have the avenues to become producers of media. In this essay, I will explore participatory culture through the lense of Lev Manovich's Five Principles of New Media: Numerical Representation, Modularity, Automation, Variability, and Transcoding. The first of Manovich's principles is Numerical Representation. A piece of new media can be represented by discrete numbers. For example, an image file is a collection of numbers describing the color of each pixel in the image. A game is a piece of software compiled to 1's and 0's that respond and react to input from the user. Anything in digital form is at its based ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n13. Digital Media And The Origin Of New Media Art Nowadays, more often than not, we tend to loosely define New Media as Digital Media, primarily because these media's internet–dependency. However, the origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th century such as the zoetrope (1834), the praxinoscope (1877) and Eadweard Muybridge's zoopraxiscope (1879). From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from Thomas Wilfred's 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to Jean Tinguely's self–destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art (Vostell, 2012) There's no doubt that technology is moving art and its creative process over time. The invention of portable paint tubes and art supplies made outdoor painting accessible and Impressionism prevalent, from where we have had the honor to know about Claude Monet through his legendary lily pond from his suburban residence at Giverny, France and on the walls of canvas at Musee L'Orangerie in the city of Paris. More recently in the 20th century, if it is not for the revolutionary invention of silkscreen printing, Andy Warhol would not have become a household name in the art world. The truth is, to artists, technology has been a driving force to constantly provide and inspire new ways of art creation for a long time, arguably since the beginning of art history.

What Are The Stereotypes Of Media Bias Today's media likes to give the appearance of honesty and truth, but it is really still just biased propaganda paid for by the bigger powers that control the news we know today. Many People are easily swayed by big news companies because they think they can trust them, when in reality they are just taking advantage of people. A story I found from CNN talked about How a North Korean missile test earned Kim Jong Un's praise (K.J. Kwon, CNN). This shows that a lot of the stories that media covers seem to be pretty underwhelming, but they use cliffhangers and over hype the story that is, \"Coming up next!\", to make a pretty simple story seem impactful. The media over exaggerates events constantly, making a incredibly small and meaningless story into a devastating monster of a news report. A lot of the news is meant to sway your thoughts about an event or even a person. Sometimes you never even notice that you are being sculpted into thinking a certain way. All of these news providers have been around for years and years so they have perfected the art of manipulating its viewers into thinking exactly what they want them to think. ...

Personal Statement Of Purpose For A Career In Journalism I always knew I wanted to be in Journalism. Growing, up in Cameroon, I had little knowledge of how the media worked or what being a journalist even entailed. I had a passion for telling stories, and zero experience or hope that I would someday be able to do so in a way that effects positive change. As far as I knew, journalism was the ruling government's tool for communicating what it deemed fit for public knowledge, and stifling any information that remotely threatened the political status quo. It wasn't until I moved to the United States with my family in 2010 that I fully understood the power of Media. My educational/professional career since then, has invigorated my love for the media arts. I studied Public Relations and Journalism at Prince Georges Community College from Fall of 2010. I learned about the power of free speech and free media. I gained respect for the First Amendment. It amazed me that here in the United States, anyone could share their opinion, no matter how unpopular and yet be protected by their rights as citizens. This was new and fascinating considering the restrictive nature of press in my home country. Two years and an Associate's degree later, I transferred to Phillip Merrill College of Journalism (University of Maryland College Park) to study broadcasting.

Unlike traditional art, new media art has pieces of work created by digital machines and other technological devices. In addition, digital media art can be in a form of a video, sculpture, installation art ,photography, robotics, audio and many other formulations. In the reading \"New Media Art – Introduction\" written by Mark Tribe,the author talks about technology and art becoming new media art. together.

The Importance Of Media Literacy Indeed, the pervasiveness of media in its abundant forms in contemporary US culture is undeniable. Almost everywhere one looks, one can find forms of media; a magazine at a doctor's office, a billboard alongside a freeway, a painting at an art gallery, a performance on television or on stage. Media, undeniably, is ubiquitous. However, in all the innumerous forms media comes to us in, every one of these forms is created for a single purpose; to communicate an idea or message. Thus, it the individual's ability to interpret these forms and decipher their meaning has become critical. But how are students, as well as educators, supposed to interact and interpret media?

Hoechsmann & Poyntz furthers Buckingham's argument by eloquently writing, \"Rather than being positioned as victims, a focus on media... addresses the complex ways youths become agents in their life and the lives of others\" (Hoechsmann & Poyntz, 2012, p. 109). Indeed, because the singular purpose of media is to convey an idea or a message to the masses, media must have an audience; which is to say a group who consumes it. Further, because of its omnipresence in US culture, media will certainly almost always have an audience; for anyone who is exposed to media may be considered part of its audience; whether they consciously acknowledge their participation or not. Consequently, through a variety of forms, such as access to television and the internet, children today are exposed to media from a very early age. Assuredly, as Buckingham suggests, starting from a young age of even four or five, children have already started interacting with media (Buckingham, 2004, p. 41–45). Subsequently, children, from a very early age, most certainly, are members of the media's audience.

Introduction In the twenty first century, the media has been transformed into a highly influential tool and segmented to aspects such as print, broadcast, film, outdoor and internet etc. The relationship between the media and construction of national identity is apparent with distinctive representation of nationalism in news coverage of politics, celebrations, tourism and country heritage (Leong, 2001).

As such the Singapore flag, pledge and anthem together with the National Day visual display of patriotism and flags on the building are promoted daily in schools and annually on 9th of August with much elaboration and significance. Therefore, it can be seen that media in Singapore are essential tools to promote national identity while supporting the ruling party political regime. Singapore then Prime Minister proposed that the press should support national goals and he states that: \"we want mass media to reinforce, not undermine, the cultural values and social attitudes being inculcated in out school and universities\" (Lee, 1971). For that reason, most of Singapore media today is under control of the government or government–linked corporations and are the principal instrument in creating social and political stability as well as advocating government policies and instilling nationalism (Leong, 2001). Also, the government uses Roger Protection Motivation theory (Severin & Tankard 1992, p.159) by arousing fear to help influence the cognition, attitude and behaviors intention through the severity, probability and efficacy of an event (Rogers, 1983).

Problem Solution : Senoon Street And Sesame Street Sophia Cajigas Ms. Milliner EES21QH–01 01 June 2017 Problem–Solution Essay Many people in the United States grew up with shows like Sesame Street. Fun, 'children' shows that offered important social and educational values. Recently, there have been severe budget cuts to PBS, the program that funds Sesame Street and other educational programs such as the YouTube show Crash Course. While this seems like an issue that shouldn't be brought into the public eye, there are many repercussions to completely terminating very relevant, poignant programs. People may not see the immediate problem with terminating a program such as PBS, but many educators fear for the future after these cuts. PBS offers free videos of educational programming for teachers to use in class. They offer youtube videos, websites with educational games, and toys that offer healthy stimulation for young children. My mother, a kindergarten teacher, even said that she's seen improvement in kids who had these educational programs versus kids who haven't. \"They seem more eager to learn and they seem to actually have fun while their learning since they associate counting with fun characters like Elmo\". Not only are these shows incredibly helpful to young children, but they're also incredibly diverse. Many people who were born in the 90s know about shows such as Static Shock, El Tigre, and Samurai Jack. All three of these shows portray people of color in an accurate, nonstereotyping manner. Static Shock was a black superhero with a white sidekick, El Tigre was a Latino superhero with an art style largely influenced by sugar skulls, and Samurai Jack has a very accurate representation of ancient Japanese culture, with a non–offensively coded Asian male as the lead. These shows from the past offered a chance for people to relate to characters by offering them a character that looks like the person watching, or someone the person knows. Granted you can't have every body type, race, gender, or sexuality expressed in mainstream media, but there has been a severe lack of true diversity in programming.

However, digital industry is often a vague term and does not clearly define the final form of the art work.

I had a passion for telling stories, and zero experience or hope that I would someday be able to do so in a way that affects everyday people, and effects positive change. As far as I knew, journalism was the ruling government's tool for communicating what it deemed fit for public knowledge, and stifling any information that remotely threatened the political status quo. Only in the following years would I come to grasp the power of media and communication, in a journey that has led me to this very moment. In the summer of 2011 after persuading my father that journalism was my passion and not nursing, I enrolled in Price George's Community College. For two years, I studied Public Relations and Journalism. I learned about the power of free speech and free media. I gained respect for the First Amendment; the bedrock for Watergate. Here, anyone could share their opinion no matter how unpopular. This was new and fascinating considering the restrictive nature of my free press in my home country. So the more I learned, the more intrigued I became. Two years and an Associate's degree later, I transferred to Phillip Merrill College of Journalism (University of Maryland College Park) to study broadcasting. There, I learned the tricks of the journalism trade; how to shoot, ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n33.

Paparazzi that were later sighted as the main cause of the crash were among the first to arrive on the scene of Diana's death, making apparent how invasive news and media can be for people especially the royal family. In Banksy's exhibit \"Dismaland\",which itself is a play on \"Disneyland\", one can find a sculpture of Cinderella hunched over a crashed pumpkin carriage, under a tunnel,only illuminated by the lights of crowding paparazzi.Here, Banksy makes a compelling argument and statement about how invasive media can be in a person's live by showing a third party depiction using a national icon depicting a national tragedy. Banksy is a street artist known for his controversy and this art installation is one of his more controversial pieces of artwork Making art pieces depicting brutal events in history is nothing new, yet what makes this piece so shocking is how Banksy portrays it. He depicts it using Cinderella, an iconic fairy tale character who little girls dream about one day being.Cinderella has the connotation of innocence and nostalgia, thus using her this attacks our ethos by taking this symbol of innocence and nostalgia and twisting it into a dark reminder of what a real life princess's life is like.

Since their respective explosions into the new media markets during the mid– twentieth century, film and television have produced consistently growing numbers of viewers and critics alike.

Greater emotional and intellectual responses surface as foreign issues become \"closer to home\" from an instant access to news. As the public receives such unbiased information, it can make more informed decisions, and has a better chance to affect change. (At this time, television and film are the most powerful catalysts for social change.) Thus it can be argued that film and television productions help to create positive social changes, promote multiculturalism and diversity, and create a common cultural identity among viewers. Unfortunately, this utopian argument doesn't account for the countless studies correlating film and television viewing to perpetuated hate and stereotyping, and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Declining SAT scores and library check–outs over the decades have lead critics to believe that film and television are aiding in the international \"dumbification\" effort, in which individuals are losing the ability to think without direction. This phenomenon is closely related to the more recent \"couch potato syndrome\", in which laziness, lack of physical fitness and a passive attitude combine, producing the ultimate unhealthy lifestyle that is currently sweeping the majority of modern America.

The 's Impact On Canadian Constructions Of Heritage And Islam Spectacle and the Universal: ISIL's Impact on Canadian Constructions of Heritage and Islam Context and Research Question: In August 2015, after capturing the ancient Roman site of Palmyra, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) spectacularly exploded the remains of the Temple of Bel and the Temple of Baalshamin. They immediately spread the images of their destruction online by creating videos and news reports. ISIL's acts of destruction mark the largest–scale mass destruction of antiquities by one group since the Second World War (Kulish and Myers 2016), and their videos are extremely effective in disseminating their spectacles outside of the Middle East. Scholars in art history, archaeology, and law consider these acts the destruction of cultural heritage (Harmanşah 2015; Bauer 2015; Brodie 2015; Drasewska 2015; He 2015; Kila 2015). In particular, ISIL's videos seek to defy Western European ideas about cultural heritage which are often cast as universal (Meskell 2002, 568) and engage a worldwide audience through carefully articulated performances. However, the many Canadian journalists using digital media to protest the destruction and reassert their own humanitarian, cosmopolitan, and civilized heritage values clearly mark the success of this strategy (Manley 2016). In fact, a trend emerged where popular news stories claim that ISIL is destroying the heritage that belongs to all of humanity (Harmanşah 2015, 173). Some scholars dispute the validity of this ...

Using a custom drawing tool (Mechanical Turk), thousands of individuals working in isolation from one another painted a tiny part of the bill without knowledge of the overall task. Workers were paid one cent each via Amazon's Mechanical Turk distributed labor tool. The total labor cost to create the bill, the multi–authored artwork being created, and the reproductions available for purchase (to charity) are all $100.

Digital Media Participation: How Fans Interact Online is a short documentary about how fans show their support to their celebrity idols with the emergence of social media. Our group chose this topic because we notice how fans show their support by going to mall shows or by using certain hashtags on Twitter and make them trend worldwide. This documentary film aims to change the perspective people have on fans that they are cheap, desperate, and low class. With this interactivity and digitalization come a new form of community that sprouted from the computer–mediated communication (CMC) (McQuail 150–51), the virtual community. According to McQuail, this virtual community \"can be formed by any number of individuals by way of the Internet at their own choice\" (150) and \"usually based on some common interest\" (150). Fan clubs before are known to be supporters who would go to shows, guestings, and tapings of their idols but now fan clubs could also sprout online. Fans have used new media to interact with co–fans who have obviously have the same interests (their idol or idols). By then, a public sphere would emerge in the new media. What is interesting in the documentary is that some of the fans we interviewed are not really good at interacting personally but are able to make friends online because of the people who understand them and of what they call now as \"feels\" (a superlative form of having so much feelings towards someone or something).

It is well known that finances, media, education and law are fundamental to a society – two of them are also inherently linked through society: media and law. The media affects society's perspective and values which, in turn, shape the law.

Compared with words like \"freedom fighter\" or \"undisclosed plan\" – it is plain that the difference here is perspective: and the one chosen by the media reflects that of the nation. To give an example: typing in \"Muslim terrorist\" into Google yields 247 000 results versus the 202 000 that \"Christian terrorist\" gives. Looking up the phrase \"Muslim freedom fighter\" gives 342 000 results versus the 440 000 that \"Christian freedom fighter\" yields: these are only pages from Canada, the discrepancy increases when the whole web is searched. The perpetuation of words with certain connotations onto certain groups or ethnicities is done through repetition, and the technique works. It creates stereotypes that society adopts – why is it that someone with an Arabic sounding name is more likely to get a special security screening at the airport compared to an English man – or – that a black man is more likely to be suspected of a crime than a Caucasian woman? These stereotypes, largely developed by the media, can have a large impact on criminal trials in Canada. Particularly, criminal trials involving a jury in which their subconscious biases may sway them towards a particular verdict.

Interactive media experience is a special multimedia presentation, that involved interactive media techniques and interactive media arts. Their final purposes are that creating a method of communication with perception by using presenting content such as text, games, animation, video, moving image and audio. In short, interactive media is a method of communication to circularly present a combinatorial information which output from the media and comes from the input of the users. Smuts (2009, p.53) defined \"interactive\" features in two points, he stated, \"First, I look for essential features of this relationship; second, using these features I develop a surprisingly simple definition of \"interactivity\" that can help distinguish the interactive from no interactive arts\". Whether interactive media or new digital media, they both are a division of multimedia. However, compare with new digital media such as multiple images, interactive media is more focusing on the interaction. The key idea of interactive media is that to build interactive relationship between sender and receiver at a specific time and space, in order to complete informational interaction.

The reworking and regeneration of already existing cultural works through the processes of borrowing, stealing, recycling, appropriating and collaging has become a dominant creative strategy in contemporary art and design, particularly fortified by Postmodernity. Martino Gamper, sister duo Soda_Jerk and Glenn Brown are significant artists in this 'remix culture' that redefine the way the world is perceived through the reproduction and recyclability of their works and the works of others. Remix culture, or 'read–write culture' , lets people generate \"art as readily as they consume it\" . In Lawrence Lessig's book Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy, he argues that the contemporary generation's form of 'literacy' is technologically–based . In this contemporary society, technology plays a significant role in the appropriation and 'hacking' of art, music and film making it difficult to distinguish what is piracy and what is creative.

The public has access to this technology, but is the public viewing what the public publishes? Most of the time we are viewing the popular, which is usually a small group of people.

It's role in today's media environment presents an interesting paradox. On one hand, social media is rather limiting. It is incredibly easy to tailor one's online experience to their personal beliefs and perspective. At the same time, social media presents the opportunity to connect with the world at large. To say that new media allows for one but the not the other would be incorrect. Today's society is one that both reveres and fears social media, leaving people in an interesting position. In her essay \"The Turn Within\", Susan J.

This paper aims at addressing the various areas of research associated with the ideas of digital art, starting from the history, through its various dimensions and demonstrations, working and functionalities of computer, significant work in the area and ending with the emergence of various ideas that surrounds this developing discipline. The history of digital art, which can be more broadly referred to as electronic art, is not only written whilst affected by the consolidation of the aesthetic and foundation that Stewart Brand claims for contemporary culture, but also in the very acceptance of digital art by the institutions and curators of the art world. It is a reality that digital art has remained in a transition for a considerable period of time and has yet to be established as a proper discipline. One of the earliest ancestors of digital art is the neo–impressionist painter Seurat. He created a new technique that has a resemblance to what later will become the pixels. A pixel is the smallest unit of a computer image. On this point, the critic Donald Kuspit notes the effect Seurat had on impressionism and especially later neo–impressionism to pointillism and then to inspire pixels.

Anyone who pays attention to the reporting that is going on, they would notice the first question, but do not take it a moment to question why the public or themselves allow it.

Creating an engaging experience which encourages the presence of audience participation as well as a space which facilitates interactions at a human–scale plays a crucial role (Xia & Li, 2009, p. 3). Research regarding anthropometrics and user interaction could assist in the programming of these issues. Exhibiting and archiving new media in the most appropriate manner is an important consideration during the design phase of this typology. Xia and Li (2009) state that \"The essential purpose of exhibition is the transmission of information. We need to transmit the information from the exhibits to the public and improve their understanding\" (Xia & Li, 2009, p. 1). Designing a space which facilitates improved user comprehension could be accomplished through research regarding lighting, air quality, signage, or other interior factors. Poor lighting or signage could affect the users understanding of the works in the museum, therefore attention to detail as well as craftsmanship will play an important role.

Analysis of the State of the New Media Art The article is an analysis of the state of the new media art. The new media uses digital communication to express its artwork and Muir (2002) choses certain works as illustrative examples of their format. Their spectrum was so–called old, middle–aged and modern digital art that spanned the 19th century to the present moment. Their first example was June Paik's \"magnet TV\" 91965). Paik integrated music, video,a nd sculptural forms of objects in order to convey modern relationship to TV. Intending to convey the omnipotence of TV, Paik's aforementioned sculpture consisted of a large magnet on top of a television set. The magnet was manipulated by hand to create abstract patterns of light inside the monitor. The work was deliberately constructed in a simple way so as to arouse discussion and thought regarding the all–powerful influence and, some would say, insidiousness, of TV.

Schoffer's sculptures combining electronics with sculpture included his 52 meter high cybernetics \"Tower of Liege', which consisted of mirrors, projectors, microphones, and photoelectric cells.
