        "text": "After achieving my pharmacy doctorate in 2004, and managing a 700 script a day pharmacy for nearly a decade, Iâve stepped down from full time pharmacy to obtain other educational certificates in hopes of finding more then just medicine to help people heal. Years in the pharmacy profession have shown me the enormous need for more mental health education, and lack of resources for the average patient to learn how to help themselves heal using more than just pills and potions.\n\nI spent 10 years studying essential oils, mindfulness, meditation, attending programs and reading books on mental health. After a messy divorce from domestic violence I still hadnât felt like I found all the things needed to help my own depression and anxiety, until I found RTT hypnotherapy. I attended the classes, was a subject then a student and was amazed. Using hypnosis with the techniques and tricks learned from years of study, I have found the fountain of youth (for mental health)!\n\nI graduated in 2022 with my certification in RTT hypnotherapy and have had nothing but amazing results. I love being able to change peoples lives and help them change their mindset, their mental health and see the changes from physical and emotional healing.\n\nMy hearts purpose is to help women heal after divorce and help them navigate the divorce drama that breaks down healthy women and often leads to anxiety and depression. Hearts can be healed â¤ï¸âð©¹\n\nAfter listening to a pre-recorded hypnosis audio you may see the value in guided meditation but not see the full results you want.\n\nHypnosis audios are great, but a full 90 min personalized session is often needed to break up limiting beliefs, find the root of negative self talk and break down the barriers to the life your meant to live.\n\nHypnosis sessions go deep, dive into your past, present and future limiting beliefs. A full session can find issues and negative programming you didnât even know existed.\n\nA majority of my clients find suppressed fears and false beliefs that shock them."
